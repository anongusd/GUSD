@TrueSoulution @RepMarkGreen Yes, jealous!
@politico Where‚Äôs friend trump now? Was your loyalty &amp; trust for trump worth your life &amp; future of your family
@Stop_Trump20 No, it would be entertaining, celebratory, &amp; time to open the most expensive bottle of champagne &amp; watch fireworks. Then celebrate the dawning of a new day &amp; new beginingsp
@pflinchman1 @MSNBC That‚Äôs where part of the problem lies. When you like the nasty mouth &amp; rhetoric, it speaks volumes of who &amp; what you are. That‚Äôs the danger in bringing that garbage into the light, it incites violence, hatred,mistrust, &amp; division where none should be. We need a united country
@pflinchman1 @MSNBC You would know that how? I live, work, speak with, listen, &amp; watch the news. You know the people who investigate &amp; fact check the authenticity of trumps speeches, rants&amp; rhetoric.The way Americans have for generations, every single past president in history. News &amp; conversations.
@pflinchman1 @MSNBC You‚Äôre kidding right? TRUMP LIES ABOUT EVERY LITTLE &amp; BIG THING. HE HAS NO CONCEPT OF TRUTH. ITS FOREIGN TO HIM. THE LIST IS TO LONG TO GO OVER. IF I WROTE EVERYDAY 24 HRS A DAY FOR A MONTH I WOULDNT BE ABLE TO LIST ALL HIS LIES. Watch the news &amp; be open minded. It‚Äôs clear as day
@pflinchman1 @MSNBC By the way what Clinton was accused of as wrong &amp; despicable as it was the women weren‚Äôt that credible &amp; the 22 year old was not a child. She did it what she did but with an agenda. She wanted him for herself. She was young &amp; unfortunately keeps paying for it more than him
@pflinchman1 @MSNBC And although some of that may be right, all &amp; I mean every politician &amp; president lie about some things. On the scale the they‚Äôre small things. TRUMP LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING EVERY TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH. BIG, SMALL IMPORTANT OR UNIMPORTANT. HES PATHOLOGICAL, CANT BE TRUSTED AT ALL
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs a shame the GOP needs to make up FAKE NUMBERS &amp; FAKE STATISTICS to feed TRUMPS alleged crisis at the border &amp; create a defense for the COURT ACTIONS against them &amp; their border wall. How about the EPSTEIN CRIME OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING &amp;RAPE. That‚Äôs a crisis the gop needs to fix
@realDonaldTrump There‚Äôs PROOF all over the place that THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE A LOT OF THINGS WRONG. HES EXTREMELY CORRUPT and knows how to use people to do his dirty work for him so he can stand back &amp; blame everyone else for HIS CORRUPT &amp; ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.
@pflinchman1 @MSNBC They are absolutely more credible than trump. No doubt. Trump is nothing but a pathological liar. He has no credibility what so ever. When he opens his mouth he lies. For people to want to believe or defend him makes me question their character because who defends that behavior!
@pflinchman1 @MSNBC I never refer to him that way as he does not behave or represent himself with any respect or decency to be addressed with that title. He can hold any position in the world but the truth is he‚Äôs pure garbage with a bad disposition and big nasty mouth.
@Newsweek It‚Äôs a beautiful thing when the defendant gives you your case on a silver platter. It‚Äôs even better when he gives you the whole case wrapped in a bow.
@MSNBC Hopefully Mr. Cohen will report everything he knows about the trumps,the organization, business transactions, money funneling, loans, &amp; all questionable or illegal transactions trump ordered &amp; were followed. Let people know the deceitful man in the $1,000 suits. How he made money
@frontlinepbs @NewsHour Regardless of circumstances McCabe is more credible and trumps a liar every time.
@funder Donald J Trump president of the US of America is FRIENDS with BILLIONAIRE JEFF EPSTEIN who‚Äôs a CONVICTED RAPIST &amp; HUMAN TRAFFICKER OF MINOR GIRLS. Thought TRUMP WANTED TO PROTECT GIRLS FROM THESE ATROCITIES at the border, why not from his homegrown criminal friends on US soil?
@SingingBullets @MSNBC @JoeNBC Learn to read, or are you illiterate. To much meth maybe? What a damn joke.
@NBCNightlyNews @kwelkernbc Worst president &amp; admin in United States history. REPUBLICANS FAILED AMERICANS TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW, JUSTICE, VALUES, PRINCIPLES, DECENCY &amp; AMERICANS RIGHTS TO AN UNCORRUPT INEPT GOVERNMENT. A REPUBLICAN PARTY AFRAID TO BE BULLIED &amp; CALLED NAMES, &amp; AMERICANS PAY THE PRICE.
@JackPosobiec Most likely. What will trump do then?
@thehill Thank you Mr Cohen for bringing the ugly truth of trump to light
@funder An important victory for America. A decent, honest &amp; crucial American ally. Congratulations Nancy Pelosi
@SingingBullets @MSNBC @JoeNBC Ask yourself. If you don‚Äôt like something speak. never sunk low enough to do your meth. So maybe you should stop yourself. I stand by what I say. Deal with it
@GOP @realDonaldTrump How about protecting our citizens from our homegrown terrorists attempting to kill innocent journalists &amp; democrats, instead this damn admin constantly deflects to minor issues of caravans that won‚Äôt make it to the border. WE HAVE A CRISIS AT HOME &amp; ITS TRUMP &amp; ADMIN ALONE.
@funder DISGUSTING AGREED &amp; THE WAY TRUMP DISRESPECTS. &amp; DISPARAGES WOMEN, HOW DEEP WAS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF EPSTEINS CHILD TRAFFICKING &amp; RAPING. WHY DID EPSTEIN PLEAD THE 5,6,14th AMMENDMENTS WHEN IT CAME TO TRUMP. AFTER ALL TRUMP DOES GO YOUNG. BUT HOW YOUNG? DID HE PROTECT EPSTEINS ACTION
@joncoopertweets A DANGEROUS PATHOLOGICAL HOAXTER WHO‚ÄôS WORKING TO DESTROY AMERICA AND ALL OUR ALLIES ACROSS THE WORLD.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC His silence is his way of condoning this mans actions. He doesn‚Äôt speak to condemn this atrocity because down deep it means he‚Äôs pissed the man failed &amp; still has to engage  his political enemies. The opportunity to kill journalists &amp; political competitors for president is gone.
@realDonaldTrump The WITCH HUNT is in your head, STOP LYING TO AMERICA, No one NOT EVEN BURR CAN READ 2 MILLION PAGES..The outrageously crazy LIES YOU PERPETRATE on american people SHOWS HOW STUPID YOU BELIEVE WE ARE. WHEN LYING try to be good at it. YOURE AFRAID THEY FOUND COLLUSION. COWARDS LIE
@tonyschwartz üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôÇ
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Absolutely correct. Scary with him in office
@postpolitics He‚Äôs a pathological liar
@RWPUSA You are right. 25th should be exercised sooner than later, and really it‚Äôs already later!
@CamEdwards So what if he walks 3 blocks or 3 miles. The point is he refuses to patronize trumps establishment. Another person not interested in anything trump. Proud to see, hope you had the best coffee.
@briantylercohen No such thing as 6G exists. Once again trump has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You act like a bunch of saints when your family is corrupt,dishonest, disloyal, thieving liars. Your name is symbolic of hatred, racism, violence, &amp; criminal behaviors. The name you carry &amp; are proud of, businesses &amp; banks run away from. No one wants what you‚Äôre selling. No trust
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump America is behind you. A complete overhaul is needed.
@jaketapper Billionaire.
@Newsweek Afraid of trump &amp; what he thinks.
@funder Again these are people trump associates with. Those like him with no character, &amp; who abuse, insult, rape, traffic &amp; demean women &amp; little girls. Pleading the fifth is as good as admitting guilt. A trump jewel. So really where‚Äôs the bottom to the sewage that is trump &amp; associates
@ReneeHoagenson Of course he has to start finding ways to demean opposing candidates, low life‚Äôs always try to beat down others because they‚Äôre cowards &amp; bullies. Immaturity runs deep with trump. He demeans the office he holds &amp; the country as a whole. Disgusting person. He‚Äôs shameful, pitiful..
@MSNBC I hope you choose to run
@ChrisOpfer The national emergency with regard to crime is the American billionaire Epstein, a rapist, sex trafficker. What‚Äôs trump going to do about this crisis.Silence. Crime doesn‚Äôt matter until re-election, then it‚Äôll be immigrants not home grown sex traffickers who abuse our children.
@jaketapper @MarquardtA @TheLeadCNN No he cannot. He‚Äôs so far out of his league. Un is loving the visit so he can pull the strings on the puppet. Play him like a fool and call him friend at the same time.
@funder Absolutely correct, lock him up!
@NightlyPolitics @joncoopertweets Now it‚Äôs not so funny to stone, but yesterday the law was a joke to him. He needs to be taught a lesson in respect for the law. Being in jail is what he needs for him to understand the gravity of what he‚Äôs accused of. That he can‚Äôt do whatever he wants, there are consequences.
@RepMarkGreen It was done because trumps behavior was such that it made law enforcement question his loyalty to America. That‚Äôs not hard to understand, defending &amp; falling in love with known enemies of this country deserve to be investigated by counterintelligence to make sure The US is safe.
@McFaul Explain that to trump.
@Top_Sergeant @realDonaldTrump Agree get rid of the treasonous trump. He‚Äôs bad&amp; wrong for America &amp; the world. He‚Äôs a cancer that needs to be removed &amp; thrown away. A disease upon the US. Revoke his citizenship &amp; send him to Russia, China or North Korea. He should never be aloud back. He‚Äôs dangerous &amp; volital
@realDonaldTrump How‚Äôs that supposed to work when you‚Äôre dividing this country from the rest of the world. Where do compete &amp; with whom? You‚Äôve destroyed relationships with allies, &amp; every industrialized partner. So once again you‚Äôre bs anyone who believes you. Such a pathological liar you are.
@thehill And you‚Äôre a pos. Always the fool, manipulated by enemies of the country, and idiotic in the way you handle yourself and others.
@dbongino You need to shut up &amp; stop trying to create crap where there is none. Grow up already
@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Suspicious actions are more than enough to start a counterintelligence investigation especially for the position held. That obese individual 1 is not innocent and picked on. He‚Äôs been treated better than he‚Äôs ever treated anyone. Stop trying to defend what cannot be defended
@realDonaldTrump WHY DOES AMERICA HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND LISTEN TO A FAKE PRESIDENT? A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR WHOSE LIES BECOME GREATER EVERYDAY. WHO SPENDS HOURS TRYING TO INCITE VIOLENCE, HATE &amp; DISINFORMATION THAN TO WORK AT ANYTHING WORTHWHILE. TRY SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE. NEWS IS GREAT. INFORMATIVE
@NBCNews She deserves to be thrown in a dumpster w/raw sewage in the marshes w/alligators. It‚Äôs 2019 &amp; no one wants hateful people like that around. If you can‚Äôt deal with bi lingual people don‚Äôt go to a Spanish restaurant. You‚Äôre prejudiced outlook on hard working Americans is hateful.
@joncoopertweets Maybe unwitting, maybe he never seems to see, grasp or acknowledge how easily he gets played or manipulated by everyone. When confronted with it, his position is to aggress, deflect, lie &amp; go on tv to denounce what happened. His ego can only be stroked or you get baby tantrums
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs amazing you think you have the power to destroy businesses &amp; that you‚Äôll be around for six yrs. You have no control of anything. No one‚Äôs going out of business. The press doesn‚Äôt get things wrong about you,but if they do it‚Äôs human error Anything dishonest is due to yourself
@NBCPolitics Ok but it‚Äôs still not finalized, so what‚Äôs to celebrate? It‚Äôs the same position trying to be wrapped up in pretty bows. As trumps abilities to negotiate &amp; get things done still run flat as North Korea hasn‚Äôt done a thing to denuclearize, but grow it‚Äôs nuclear facilities instead.
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre upset w/news media &amp; journalists for calling you out on the lying &amp; misinformation you dish out does not make it fake news. You trying to discredit the news org on their fact checking is ludicrous. YOU DISH OUT THE FAKE NEWS, &amp; don‚Äôt like it when you‚Äôre caught &amp; challenged
@realDonaldTrump Then trump send us our tax paying money for every golf playing, &amp; every trip to Florida &amp; everywhere else we pay for you to go. I know I‚Äôm bothered paying for you to golf ect... I WANT MY MONEY AND I WANT IT NOW!!!! Mr I‚Äôm going to deplete &amp; waste emergency money for a dumb wall.
@RepHarley @OversightDems trump &amp; his administrative circle need to be locked up for crimes against America. Every trump, kushner, pence, mulvany ect...LOCK THEM UP. Let‚Äôs take back our country, &amp; irradiate the swamp. Past politics are looking good now!
@funder Lock him up! It‚Äôs a complete disregard to the rule of law that the judge ordered. He believes he‚Äôs above the law to.
@kylegriffin1 Great, we don‚Äôt need or want garbage coming out of every corner of this country. We need civility &amp; decency to shower the country, to unite what‚Äôs been instigated to be divided. To see each other‚Äôs differences &amp; similarities &amp; appreciate it. Live &amp; let live. Make USA shine again
@NBCNews Doesn‚Äôt this english speaking idiot realize the first people were native Indians, &amp; then Christopher Columbus, a hispanic discovered America. So who should get out of who‚Äôs country. Past time to stop the white superiority bs &amp; treat everyone with respect &amp; common decency. No hate
@RepMarkMeadows No one knows anything yet Mr Mueller is still working the investigation
@jaketapper Warm wishes to the family. Sorry for the pain you‚Äôre experiencing.
@FOXLA How stupid can you be
@realDonaldTrump So if you didn‚Äôt do it then, you did right now on social media. It‚Äôs a bad policy.
@HamillHimself üòÇüòÇüòÇüëçseeing that made me realize even more how stupid this guy really is, &amp; better than that he‚Äôs asking Japan prime minister to nominate him for a nobel peace prize. Hilarious. Name one thing he‚Äôs done or contributed anything good to to the world that he should be nominated!!
@realDonaldTrump Interesting speech, youwant Venezuela president to leave office for the betterment of the people. You‚Äôre wanting to unite them as a democracy under Guaido. What about the American citizens who want you out so we can return to a functional country &amp; democracy. Take your own advice
@realDonaldTrump HERE GOES TRUMP AGAIN ATTACKING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE OTHER 15 STATES ARE SUING HIM AGAINST A BORDER WALL. HE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. STOP BLAMING CALIFORNIA FOR EVERYTHING. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT TRUMP. DEAL WITH REALITY. NO ONE BUT YOU WANT THE WALL. MORE SUITES TO COME
@thehill Members of the Venezuelan government are creating a group of political members from China, Russia, North Korea &amp; other countries engaged with NATO to ban against the United States. And it‚Äôs people are listening &amp; joining them. Shines a bright light on the standing of the US.
@brucehood277 @drevil_philippo @tomradman @hintze_steve @LittleMissFlint @realDonaldTrump So trump should as a responsible &amp; accomplish negotiator take care of the American people in Flint &amp; in every corner of the US. It‚Äôs part of his responsibility to the people. If one president didn‚Äôt get it done then it falls on the next person to follow through. It‚Äôs the job.
@realDonaldTrump Yes people are smart even when you make up numbers to stroke your over inflated ego. You with 93 % rating is w/your unfavorable constituents. The US citizens that want you out. Out of sight out of mind. Do the 93% of the world a favor &amp; resign. Then the next president will MAGA.
@PatsyPr83198381 @funder Write English so someone can understand you.
@realDonaldTrump Treasonous citizen =trump, donald j   Treasonous citizens = trump jr, trump eric trump ivanka, kushner jarod, trump lara, anyone trump insurance policy. Illegal deranged person in the White House who a few people like but who has done extensive damage to the country &amp; it‚Äôs allies
@realDonaldTrump You have the audacity to complain about McCabe &amp; Rosenstein possibly lying &amp; supposedly doing something maybe, but unrealistically illegal &amp; stating they got caught at it. Do you realize everyone catches you lying everyday? &amp; you‚Äôre being investigated for your illegal activities.
@MJGWrites Calling anyone a lardass is respectful, the jokes on you. It‚Äôs disrespecting a disrespectful trump.
@kylegriffin1 Only trump would believe that‚Äôs appropriate, funny, or worthy of print. What a scumbag. So immature, disgusting, vile, &amp; animalistic. Maybe he grew up in the gutter, that might explain his inability to show any decency at all.
@ABC Heartwarming. God bless everyone who risked their lives to save their lives. Good people in the world.
@BradMossEsq @AshaRangappa_ No one has to, trump will come out and say it, applaud it and recommend he continue to do it.
@TheDailyShow This is the best video I‚Äôve ever heard or seen. Great great job. Haven‚Äôt laughed so hard in a while. Thanks
@DavidCornDC He must of thought he could pull a stunt that trump might have pulled. Wasn‚Äôt expecting to be reigned in like the garbage he is, no apology will change this judges mind. Shows how stupid stone really is.
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews Nobody knows that because investigations are ongoing &amp; no one has given any accounting to state otherwise.
@funder He should be dragged out by his hair, in handcuffs &amp; shackled from top to bottom. Thrown out like the garbage he is
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends When there comes time for a coup against this person trump there will be no problem getting it done. It will be an easy assignment. Wish it would be issued &amp; carried out already. A coup against trump! What a thought. That would be a night when everyone could sleep the best ever.
@joncoopertweets Dead last was a no brained Donald trump. So funny &amp; entertaining. You have to love it. What a great way to end the day
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Did you get another order on what to do next from fox &amp; friends?
@amber_athey @DailyCaller @DonaldJTrumpJr No trump should ever judge or provoke anyone about truth or honesty. None of them (trumps) ever apply those two words in any aspect of their lives. It‚Äôs comical when they attempt to call people out on it though. A bunch of low life losers.
@KellyO @realDonaldTrump What an ugly sight
@hardball @samstein The trump initiative is, always lie about plans to do any of trumps agendas then force the American people to pick up the tab. Mexico always stated they would not pay 1 cent for the wall &amp; they haven‚Äôt. Their govt didn‚Äôt lie. The US govt lies everyday to its citizens. trumps lies
@RepMarkMeadows Just Because there‚Äôs a desire to defend trump, doesn‚Äôt make Mr. McCabe or anyone else a liar. The proven liar has &amp; is trump &amp; his supporters. Those who defend liars, lie to validate his positions, so McCabe &amp; every career law enforcement professional is more credible than trump
@RepMarkMeadows If they really knew they wouldn‚Äôt be investigating. Reality check the committees are asking the questions so they can know what‚Äôs going on with Papodopolous, Flynn &amp; collusion with Russia. The truth will eventually come out.
@peterbakernyt His bark is worse then his bite. He wants retribution towards tv, newspaper, magazines,journalists, any person who disagrees w/him publicly, because his mentality is of a ten year old. He‚Äôs a damn cry baby, who bullies, create dissension &amp; deflection from his inadequate abilities
@funder He‚Äôs incredibly stupid &amp; easily offended, due to his lack of insight &amp; immaturity. Time for his bottle &amp; bedtime.
@joncoopertweets @LindseyGrahamSC Mr. Graham as trump is completely out of touch w/reality. More new schools = smaller class size, easier on educators to give extended attention to students needing help. Kids feel secure &amp; protected. A wall = wasted funds, doesn‚Äôt solve problems at the border. Schools deserved!!
@thehill You really want everyone to believe one woman can derail a multi billion dollar company from bringing business to New York? One woman told Amazon not to come so they don‚Äôt. How stupid do you think people are? They have reasons but it‚Äôs not for one woman, there‚Äôs much more to it.
@Newsweek Trump has an admin person ask the prime minister of Japan to nominate him for the Nobel Peace prize. That‚Äôs an honor people work hard for all their lives to achieve, it means they‚Äôve done something positive, productive &amp; good for the world. None of that can be said of trump.
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump He talks about hoaxes, the biggest hoax perpetrated on the American people is trump. Incredible how people feel it‚Äôs ok to back, protect &amp; defend the most incorrigible, hate inciting, egotistic bullying pathological liar to ever hit DC. Can‚Äôt make decisions w/o Limbaugh &amp; Coulter
@JuddLegum @joncoopertweets Do you think he appreciates the hard criticism you‚Äôre trying to express. If you were on fire he wouldn‚Äôt even piss on you to help you out. But to each their own.
@thehill Agree. He‚Äôs afraid of anyone he feels threatened by. You were threatening
@GrnEyedMandy @joncoopertweets And it‚Äôs all at taxpayers expense.
@thehill Trump is a mistake!
@TranslateRealDT He is the lowest person alive. He isn‚Äôt worth the dirt on the bottom of anyone‚Äôs shoe. Pure trash, he‚Äôs not worth acknowledging. Absolutely worthless.
@funder Hope the news media will be there to cover the protests &amp; show the world how Americans are disgusted by this president, that we turn our backs to his ideas, ideology, policies foreign &amp; domestic, &amp; all the rhetoric that comes out of his mouth. Good luck with the protests.
@60Minutes DANGEROUS MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WHEN IS ENOUGH, ENOUGH. DOES HE BRING THE COUNTRY TO THE PRECIPICE OF DICTATORIAL RULE BEFORE HE‚ÄôS EJECTED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. HOW FAR DOES HE GET TO GO? WHEN RUSSIA,NORTH KOREA OR CHINA GET HANDED THE US BY TRUMP WHILE HE LIES ABOUT IT. WHEN?
@TheDemCoalition The CORRUPT DONALD TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE
@KenDilanianNBC People think trump isn‚Äôt a danger to Americans. Putin, North Korea &amp; China are more committed to our nations security than the American intelligence service. Who are we kidding. He needs to be banned &amp; stripped of his citizenship &amp; sent to any of those countries he loves so much.
@karengreenbarn1 Very very funny. Good one.
@peterbakernyt True, other presidents may not like or agree with what the press says or does but they were man enough to accept it &amp; keep going. Trump is the only destructive person who has to use name calling &amp; fake news rhetoric because he can‚Äôt deal with reality. His immaturity shines daily.
@realDonaldTrump Republican President is on another WITCH HUNT against the Mueller investigation &amp; democrats. Again he‚Äôs RIGGING his animosity towards the wrong people. All this coming from a CONFLICTED man who doesn‚Äôt want to acknowledge his actions are what caused the not ILLEGAL investigation.
@funder üëç he is indeed a sociopath but also a pathological liar with no redeemable qualities. Black hearted &amp; soulless.
@joncoopertweets The rigged &amp; CORRUPT TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE &amp; THE WORLD
@TheDemCoalition @IvankaTrump What else.
@realDonaldTrump What are you afraid of? A little joking and your over sensitive ego gets hurt! What a baby, do you need a bottle &amp; diaper change? Amazing how something like that offends you, but you have no balls about bullying &amp; saying vile nasty, disgusting crap to anyone you can. Collusion?
@realDonaldTrump THE RIGGED, CORRUPT, POLICY ABUSING, BULLYING, ENEMY OF THE NATION, EGO RUN, HATE &amp; VIOLENCE FILLED PROMOTER, PREJUDICE, DISLOYAL VENGEFUL SEEKING PATHOLOGICAL LIAR THATS RUNNING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ONTO THE GROUND FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL AGENDA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
@TrisResists @joncoopertweets If that‚Äôs not a slap in the face to pence &amp; trump I don‚Äôt know what is. Haven‚Äôt been that entertained in a while. Does this not tell Americans what the world thinks of this presidency &amp; his administration. You can hear a pin drop, dead silence. What an embarrassment for the USA
@JudicialWatch First show us trumps daily abuses at tax payers expense before trying to berate someone else
@USATODAY No justice for this poor woman.
@NBCNightlyNews @KathyParkNBC Oh is that one of the funds trumps trying to deplete for his national emergency border wall? Hmm!! What administration officials can we trust for an honest answer? Well the president is a liar &amp; so is his cabinet members so no honest answers. The new America.
@washingtonpost Hopefully it all tumbles to the ground, one building at a time so he &amp; his heirs watch &amp; understand how everything that goes up must &amp; will come down including &amp; especially the trump empire. To watch what they thought was untouchable collapse like sand in an hour glass. MAGA üá±üá∑ü§£
@funder Another scandalous republican senator who validates trump and so now is this why? Does Graham need trump to come to his defense now? Or could this be another corrupt situation for the Republican Party to try &amp; debunk. At this point is there one republican who‚Äôs above corruption?
@JoeNBC Someone needs to be accountable &amp; republicans threw trust,capability&amp; the desire to keep a rouge president in check. They‚Äôre afraid to stand against the bully in office, it shows their weakness &amp; inability to do what‚Äôs right &amp; just. They defend &amp; protect everything wrong in govt.
@ACLJ Get a life &amp; stop trying to incite hate w/religion. Isn‚Äôt it time to accept everyone for their differences. No 2 people are the same nor do we think the same. This topic is old &amp; bothersome. Don‚Äôt you think 2019 should be a turning point for civility towards everyone everywhere?
@Big_crusher1000 @amjoyshow @AyannaPressley Just because you can‚Äôt &amp; don‚Äôt want to deal with reality doesn‚Äôt make others loony, It makes you unwilling to deal with facts. He‚Äôs a liar &amp; destroying America one slice at a time. He‚Äôs ignorant &amp; incompetent. He‚Äôs a danger to the fabric of this country
@amjoyshow @MichaelSteele The great gift that is trump. Is this who republicans are? We &amp; the world are watching, worrying, laughing &amp; preparing. Do we have allies? Not sure due to trump politics, we have enemies, when &amp; if he depletes DOD funds would we be able to deal w/ an actual national emergency.
@amjoyshow @MichaelSteele I believe every day the Republican Party is selling America out. The prize trump, the long term cost, detrimental. What are they gaining? Tax cut created a trillion dollar a yr deficit, manufacturing co aren‚Äôt succeeding, car plants closing, govt shutdown,draining emergency funds
@thehill Let‚Äôs not vaccinate anyone anymore. We can bring back measles, mumps, polio, chicken pox ect. why are parents behaving irrationally &amp; believe they‚Äôre entitled to expose the vast majority of people to these diseases again. Why are we going backwards as a society? What‚Äôs happening?
@Newsweek He‚Äôs making all kinds of records, &amp; everyone of them hurts America &amp; her people. Why don‚Äôt senate republicans stop the bleeding? What are they afraid of? What can this incompetent ogre do to them? He isn‚Äôt God. He thinks he is, but he‚Äôs not. Why won‚Äôt senators put the brakes on?
@amjoyshow @AyannaPressley He vilifies all who disagrees w/his assessment of anything. But senate republicans decide to back up the lunacy of this pres, so why? Why this guy who‚Äôs damaged professionally, politically, personally be protected, validated &amp; followed they see the damage he‚Äôs done to the country
@CNNPolitics Problem is, he truly believes he‚Äôs above the law, will go to any length or level tochallenge his desires, what the rule of law &amp; justice say. Problem America has is there‚Äôs a rouge, unstable person &amp; admin in high office derailing our country for their continued personal gain.
@ananavarro Where‚Äôs the hilarity. People have walls &amp; fencing for their homes. What you‚Äôre trying to exploit as an excuse for a border wall is absolutely stupid &amp; disgusting. For your own sense of decency look up your ancestry, we‚Äôre all immigrants somewhere down the ancestral line, everyone
@ananavarro It‚Äôs always been about whatever he wants at someone else‚Äôs expense
@Acosta He‚Äôs nothing but a pathological liar
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre problem is you want everything now as if you‚Äôre a child. You have an expectation of getting what you want when &amp; how you want. How about paying your loan notes &amp; employees their wages, instead of hiding behind the bankruptcy courts. Keep your ugly comments to yourself.
@funder No one cares. Hopefully he‚Äô dying.
@realDonaldTrump From the man destroying the country. Pillaging resources needed for real emergencies natural &amp; militarily. A stupid wall that accomplishes nothing but throw money away. To prove he can go around the law &amp; govt securities for a bad agenda. It‚Äôs always something to show off. EGO
@RepMarkMeadows You should stop. The reason you‚Äôre saying that is because you want trump to use executive means since day one. You forget what he tries to take from DOD is money needed to protect US in natural relief situations &amp; our military. So he should bankrupt that fund for a wall? Really
@tedcruz Everyone shut up about the anti Semitic crap. Keep your opinions good, bad or indifferent to yourselves. This is kindergarten behavior. Be proud of who &amp; what you are, &amp; where the hell you came from. Live &amp; let live. There‚Äôs more to life than this &amp; trump nonsense.
@RepLeeZeldin You both really need to shut up and stop all this. Grow up already!
@davidmweissman @joncoopertweets Glad for you. It takes a lot to admit when you were wrong about something, that you were willing to keep an open mind &amp; get a better perspective of people. It‚Äôs refreshing to see what you wrote
@JuddApatow Thanks for sharing your disgust over that article. Everything you said is spot on accurate &amp; true. Unfortunately with this guy there never seems to be a bottom, he opens his mouth and goes lower still.
@bin_saayed @MichLKosinski So tired of the ‚Äúfake news ‚Äú statement. Say you disagree with the news. Be original.
@GOP Hire more agents, use K-9 dogs to help, upgrade technology, add infrastructure. Make decisions that are attainable &amp; effective. A wall is ineffective as the resources &amp; wasted military personnel &amp; time spent putting barbed wire fencing. Efforts fail because it‚Äôs not an easy fix
@bin_saayed @MichLKosinski It‚Äôs one report given to the Saudi prosecutor from an app, stating no discussion of murder. Do you believe it was done that way. No. He‚Äôs smart. You want people to believe he‚Äôs innocent, don‚Äôt believe the evidence from several govt investigations. Can‚Äôt hide behind your finger.
@bin_saayed @MichLKosinski The fact you regard news &amp; intel personnel information as fake news is telling. Support, align, &amp; validate Saudi &amp; it‚Äôs government. Nothing wrong with it.But don‚Äôt expect the world to believe the prince didn‚Äôt order the murder of the journalist.Trump can be fooled, not everyone
@bin_saayed @MichLKosinski No ones saying don‚Äôt follow or believe in your leaders &amp; policies.  When there‚Äôs evidence a leader of any nation ( including US) ordered &amp; followed through with a criminal act, no one from anywhere should turn a blind eye, pretend it didn‚Äôt happen or be offended when addressed.
@thehill The White House is full of shameless liars,manipulating people to believe them. Unfortunately believers in trump will wake up when they get a pre- existing condition &amp; realize no one will insure them. The reality of having no healthcare, going bankrupt, or dying for lack of meds
@GOP A lot of noise to attack an idea. Why?  A Dem put out a proposal. Oh no! Why no outrage at trumps ideas.This proposal like everything else would be read, dissected, reviewed, discard portions, amend &amp; If it goes anywhere it‚Äôd look very different by the time it goes for any vote.
@realDonaldTrump Never happen, you‚Äôre in a bubble of delusion. Afraid to admit how people see you. Negativity scares you, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre on the Clintons til now. Speak the truth, conspiracy theories deflect. You‚Äôre not the best candidate ever You‚Äôre the worst. Pop the bubble already. Accept it
@thehill You want a wall? Remember the Berlin Wall, when created, it divided a nation for a time. Then it failed. The public tore it down yrs later,families separated became reunited.Political conflicts began to communicate, the Cold War ended quickly.The Soviet Union fell, Russia emerged
@CNN What a nightmare. A compromised, foreign enemy friendly US President capable of nominating anyone for director of a classified organization spy satellite position. It‚Äôs wrong. Mr. Scolese could become an unwillingly compromised director if nominated due to trumps actions.
@MichLKosinski Trump/admin should be regarded as defenders of crime. Won‚Äôt stand up against foreign criminal enemies &amp; actions. Instead stands behind them, protects, defends,lies, covers for them&amp; condemns the US government‚Äôs attempts to stand against these criminals.MBS got lucky w/ trump
@funder Great comparison. So true, a positive statement. Long overdue
@lyn6591 @JaySekulow You say that like you know they haven‚Äôt
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS To bad neither one of you felt that way about our veterans.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs been wanting to do from day one. Look what has already happened to our government, values &amp; division in the country. No one has worked harder to destroy what America stands for than trump.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Better we stand behind the man who‚Äôs trying to make America the new Russia. A man who lies about his involvements with Americas foreign enemies. That‚Äôs who we should stand with &amp; behind. That‚Äôs a really bad joke right? How do you say something so incredible with a straight face?
@nytimes He brings it up to scare people, show the need for a wall, that he‚Äôs a protector from gangs. Why then isn‚Äôt he concerned about our homegrown gangs &amp; the violence, drugs, &amp; vicious takeover of neighborhoods. Why isn‚Äôt that a crisis to be dealt with? What he did &amp; said was a show.
@thehill Something different to listen to
@DailyCaller The address was awful,full of lies, pretence &amp; trump believing his subtle threats went unknown. It was 1.5 hrs wasted but necessary to hear, see &amp; try to gage where &amp; what‚Äôs going to happen to the country &amp; it‚Äôs people next.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The supposed greatest country US ripped children from their parents, denied it, did nothing to keep track of families for unification. Trump wants them out, but to who?Now the govt with all it‚Äôs resources say it‚Äôs to hard to reunite, don‚Äôt you mean they‚Äôre to lazy to get it done.
@JaySekulow Yes she will.The committee from both parties will find a compromise. Neither side gets everything they want. Pelosi shouldn‚Äôt accept 5.7 b for a wall but could accept it for security, tech, &amp; other security measures.But will trump step up &amp;sign the proposed deal set by both sides
@TPM What an incredibly insensitive &amp; stupid statement from any Vice President I‚Äôve ever heard. The indifference to people‚Äôs pain &amp; suffering. It‚Äôs telling how far out of touch the administration, especially those making decisions really are. This isn‚Äôt what Americans signed up for.
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong He‚Äôs never offered amnesty. He offered to prolong their stay 3 yrs then kick them out. Legal immigrations good when done correct but he can‚Äôt be racist,rigid &amp; paint all situations the same. They‚Äôre not. He should never be allowed to interfere with immigration bills or protocols
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong It‚Äôs not a harmless plant, it‚Äôs a plant with certain properties that can help people under Dr supervision. But smoking street pot has been proven to cause damage to the brain, to effect learning because it stunts the brain. It‚Äôs a cause of paranoia. So yes even pot needs penalty
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Exactly, they don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt learn any trade. They‚Äôre being sent out early to commit worse crimes learned inside then use it on law abiding citizens. Some don‚Äôt, they take advantage of their freedom &amp;never go back. They work hard to get a job &amp; they succeed.The majority don‚Äôt
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Part of trumps security is the war on drugs, you want to tell to stop that.
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Un‚Äôs having fun at trumps expense, he just doesn‚Äôt see it. Un will be engaging &amp;friendly to trump,tell him denuclearization is going to happen. It takes time but he‚Äôll get it done. Trump comes back, mimics his words for people to believe. Result he keeps building nuclear weapons
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong We had a surplus during the last admin. Now we have a trillion + dollar deficit. What‚Äôs happening with this administration is incredible.  Regarding the N &amp; S Korea deals it means nothing. It matters only signed &amp; applied, &amp; isn‚Äôt a threat to the US. Trump didn‚Äôt make the deal
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong A plant? Don‚Äôt understand the question.
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong He doesn‚Äôt know how. It‚Äôs a game he plays for people.
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong What‚Äôs the compromise? A concrete wall. That‚Äôs no compromise. Technology, more border agents, fix what needs repairing. No taking peoples earned property w/ eminent domain. Those can be compromised on &amp; even some fencing if everyone agrees is needed. No eminent domain takeover
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Problem w/trump is he says what he thinks he can bs congress &amp; America with. He has a demands,not options or advice, if it‚Äôs not added to proposals made by both houses, he flat out lies &amp; refuses to sign, tries strong arm tactics to make people bend to his will,and has tantrums
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Who will pay for rehab. They don‚Äôt have money or insurance. It would be a solution but who‚Äôs going to do it?
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Maybe ridiculous to some, but what‚Äôs going to happen when it starts again because life is more difficult than before. When incarcerated did they learn to work or a trade. Before releasing them to go back to nothing, they‚Äôll take back to the streets again, maybe next time kill
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Weren‚Äôt joints illegal? So they were doing their jobs &amp; taking drugs off the street &amp; punishment was filed out for the crime
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong It‚Äôs always been up to him
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong He wants a wall yesterday. The economy is ok but he didn‚Äôt do it, both houses of Congress did. He created a trillion dollar debt a year on tax reform that 1% benefit from.He‚Äôs done nothing with N Korea. No deals are made or signed. In fact they‚Äôre building more nuclear facilities
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong He doesn‚Äôt want bipartisan compromise. It‚Äôs known there‚Äôs issues at the border. He doesn‚Äôt want reform, just a wall. He refuses to accept most problems are at points of entries &amp; hundreds of tunnels,a wall will do nothing to stop drugs. Give common sense solutions not stupidity
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong I believe both houses need to work with sincerity, compassion &amp; reality, this group of people should be naturalized &amp; given the gift of knowing what their lives can be. It‚Äôs been to long &amp; the issue isn‚Äôt hard. Trump doesn‚Äôt care about the heartache these kids live with every day
@Crackhead__joe @Edgyalert911 @byHeatherLong No problem
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Drug addiction isn‚Äôt a mental health condition.When it‚Äôs used it manipulates the brain &amp; obscures reality. But it‚Äôs an artificially caused mental alteration. Used by normal functioning people who decide to use illegal drugs,&amp; when addicted it becomes a mental health issue. Wrong
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong You‚Äôre accusing police of corruption is 99% a problem. Distorting peoples views, lying about who‚Äôs there to help them brings distrust &amp; keeps criminal activities high, When you take trust away from them. Law enforcement isn‚Äôt the problem it‚Äôs people threatened for calling police
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong He will lie &amp; go back to the way he is. He doesn‚Äôt want unity, it goes against his agenda. Chaos, infighting, deception, deflection keeps Americans looking for answers &amp; while govt chambers are trying to do work he‚Äôs blaming everyone for not being allowed to do his job, a wall
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Daca &amp; TPS people are protected under the govt rule. This issue is because trump wants a white america &amp; is working to accomplish the goal. These kids have been here all there lives. They don‚Äôt know anything else. Give them citizenship. Judges don‚Äôt sue presidents. Trump lies
@Crackhead__joe @Edgyalert911 @byHeatherLong No one speaks for you, or asked you to hate. We live in a country w/freedom of speech, people hate to but it‚Äôs a negative &amp; nonproductive way to accomplish anything meaningful. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs dividing our country especially since trump started spewing hate &amp; racism  since in office.
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong The neighborhood needs to come together, reclaim their areas w/the help of law enforcement. They‚Äôre there to help but you can‚Äôt claim you don‚Äôt want to be a snitch. That‚Äôs how criminals win. Talk &amp; accept help from everywhere, defeat criminal element before they ruin your safety.
@betherzam @Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Give them their citizenship and let them have their lives and futures
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Until they offend again. Will you feel the same way if you‚Äôre caught between it. Now we‚Äôll hear about it on the news, along with rest of the criminal issues people deal with daily. Crime will rise again. Sucks. How about real help, job training, education &amp; the ability to change
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong No she didn‚Äôt, trump rejected everything. He says he wants reforms &amp; when both parties agree, trump flips, changes his mind. Blaming dems as ones not working is wrong the republicans in the senate are as complicit in passing a bill. But trump won‚Äôt sign anything he can‚Äôt control
@thehill Dems stood united &amp; that was beautiful. Nancy‚Äôs strong &amp; a powerful leader with a lot of dignity &amp; respect. I believe she‚Äôll accomplish much. I have alot of confidence in her. I wish she‚Äôd run to become president .She has the ability to counter act the damage trumps admin created
@cocobadu @byHeatherLong Wow
@cocobadu @byHeatherLong How would you know?
@PeetsDonald @CNNPolitics Extremely different. He‚Äôs a compromised, judge mental, uninformed, refuses to be informed of policy &amp; procedure. Feels society should bow down and follow crazy. No other president in US history has ripped this country apart for the good of our enemies &amp; the detriment to ourselves
@Golfin_I @thehill Did not consider that possibility. But it could explain some things. He‚Äôs already got one foot in the grave.
@Edgyalert911 @Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Everyone has their own opinions. If they don‚Äôt agree with someone else it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs conversation in which people learn the opposite position of yours. Broadens the mind. Doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre opion has to change, you just see someone else‚Äôs point of view. A learning situation
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Daca has never been illegal. It was put in place to protect innocent kids from unlawful &amp; harmful deportation. A three year stay is not a resolution it‚Äôs instability, &amp; uncertainty. The resolution demands both legislative branches to pass a law for them. . Democrats &amp; republicans
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong If what you say &amp; believe is true isn‚Äôt the parents obligation to teach, watch &amp; defend their children from harmful influences &amp; situations. Shouldn‚Äôt that be a high priority. The issue is.people do crime then blame everything else for it &amp; don‚Äôt want punishment. Is that justice
@Bruce51022248 @cocobadu @byHeatherLong You‚Äôre sick,twisted  &amp; pathetic to show something this disgusting &amp; revolting. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into keep it for yourself. Shameful
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong If they did a crime it still caused harm to someone. They don‚Äôt have to be violent to be held accountable for their crime. Why should we support people who do wrong to not get punished for it. Jail is a deterrent for committing crime. It‚Äôs ineffective if they don‚Äôt serve the time
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Daca &amp; TPS deserve a permanent resolution. The govt has two legislative bodies. Any bill for this situation lays.equally on both sides. Legislators could‚Äôve passed a bill when republicans controlled  govt. Making false crises  for a wall &amp; neglecting real threats is irresponsible
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong Daca &amp; tps immigrants don‚Äôt need temporary status from a liar who will iquickly, sneakily &amp; quietly deport them regardless. It‚Äôs not a compromise to offer the thing he took away first of all. Immigration is his dream scare tactic, he has no idea how to secure any of our borders.
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong An offender is just that. You don‚Äôt want punishment don‚Äôt be a criminal. There‚Äôs no such thing as a non violent offense. Whatever is done affected others negatively, hence the punishment
@Crackhead__joe @byHeatherLong She didn‚Äôt pass anything up. He lies, says one thing does another &amp; his focus is the border wall, not on real dangers to the American people. He lied so much. Prison reforms a joke , healthcare he‚Äôs still trying to take pre-existing conditions away, little to compromise with.
@byHeatherLong He‚Äôs not fooling her one bit. She‚Äôs doing the  best to represent her party. She‚Äôs a strong woman with a lot of dignity. Good for her &amp; the ones who stood with her.
@voxdotcom Trump is full of empty words and lies. This speech was a joke made to endorse the border wall. Same ol story. üí§üí§üí§
@RepGosar @POTUS Playing into people‚Äôs undocumented fears
@AriMelber No, not even close. But who could predict this catastrophe
@thehill Seems like trumps losing his mind. What kind of man has no control of his temper, mouth,&amp; the shit that comes out. Does he feel this temper tantrum makes him look presidential or competent. It doesn‚Äôt.His mental health needs serious evaluation. He‚Äôs a disgraceful person in office
@funder Trump is bullshit that‚Äôs why he feels that way.
@funder He doesn‚Äôt care the damage he does to American tax payers. He wants what he wants &amp; expects everyone else to flip the bill for the billionaire president. Put those millions towards something important
@sahilkapur Sounds more like an intimidating threat. Your way or their out. Who are you to decide that?  Trump tactics don‚Äôt work for everyone. You sound like a tired old record. A Puppet. Compromising is a better strategy than threats from you
@AriMelber Prime time news from a liar. Nothing he says will be honest. If he sticks to the script some people may buy it, but in reality it‚Äôs an act to make him appear to want to unite the country when he‚Äôs the one who ran with dividing it. It‚Äôs  a load pretense someone else wrote for him
@RepMattGaetz Start with trump
@CNNPolitics Our armed forces &amp; allies are suffering, not because of their superiors,because their superiors are circumvented by an unknowledgeable, dangerous, unqualified person who knows nothing about war,strategy,tactics, or what‚Äôs been accomplished. Bad decisions made w/o regard for lives
@ThisWeekABC It will be another long rant about immigration,how well this &amp; that is doing. Will not address the issues of real threats to the American people. Maybe attack Mr. Muellers investigation. Lies from when he opens his mouth till he stops. Wish the media wouldn‚Äôt run it. Hate liars.
@realDonaldTrump Find something,anything else to do during executive time except lie to exploit a bs situation. Tired of lies, claims of people coming to our borders, making human wall, really. Beyond ridiculous. Do something worthwhile to protect US from your friends Russia, China, North Korea.
@maggieNYT Needs to be done, along w/every cabinet member in trumps circle. Most of them are threats to the US. None of them qualified under career FBI officials determinations, except that a trump appointed supervisor allowed it to happen. They need to go through proper vetting processes.
@B52Malmet Must be dead inside. Nothing seems bother or affect him. Nothing at all.
@Newsweek Trump administration should never talk. You traumatize children by giving them to their parents? What kind of insanity is this? The insanity of expecting people to buy this crap. What a dangerous place the US is becoming. No one is safe with this president &amp; administration. Nuts!
@aravosis Agree 100% with your assessment.
@chucktodd @SenRickScott Should be glad the committee working on immigration is trying to do something, Instead you‚Äôre pushing trumps agenda, attacking efforts being made &amp; accusing democrats of not doing anything. Trump said anything he gets he won‚Äôt sign. He killed all offers before seeing anything.
@thehill It‚Äôs a ploy. He knows it‚Äôs going to be challenged in court &amp; won‚Äôt resolved before the 20 campaign. It gives him something to if he loses,  that he tried w/ the wall. This is an act, a show a dangerous game being set. The fact it affects thousands of people is irrelevant to him
@thehill That‚Äôs where the money to pay the treasury Dept will come from. The national emergency fund he plans to try and eviserate. He can now pay a bill!!!
@washingtonpost Putin is playing trump for his stupidity. He‚Äôs going to show the world how easy it is to trick, play&amp; manipulate the US government. Once powerful &amp; respected, now being brought to our knees. A proud legacy for the trumps their allies, believers &amp; followers. Quite the ugly legacy.
@HuffPost Rush really needs to shut up, grow up &amp; get a grip on reality. Just because he can get loud &amp; intrusive doesn‚Äôt mean he knows much about anything. He has his feelings, his perspective &amp; his agenda he wants people to follow. Shut up, listen, you may learn something more than crap.
@joncoopertweets That‚Äôs why he backed up trump &amp; refused to open the govt, &amp; why he voted to lift sanctions on derepaska. Investigate those who voted the same &amp; see how many are in bed with the Russians. Corruption is thick in this govt.
@thehill Trump is the last person who should open his vulgar, racist, lying mouth about anything. He condones racist activities all the time. He embraces it for himself, a nationalist. The media &amp; journalists shouldn‚Äôt give him any platform to report on his views. He‚Äôs a lying manipulator
@AJentleson McConnell needs to resign already. He‚Äôs 100% unamerican &amp; a hypocrite.   Non patriotic, out of touch with reality, and clueless to American values &amp; what they represent. RESIGN
@NewYorker @sbg1 About time
@dbongino Or not, it may just be coming out now because of whatever. At least he didn‚Äôt lie about it after he was confronted. So many politicians lie every time they open their mouths. He has consequences to face like anyone else.
@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump How do you spew out more lies for trump. He‚Äôs 1 day into Feb &amp; goes to the air to say if he doesn‚Äôt get money for the wall don‚Äôt bring anything to him he won‚Äôt look or read it. He $&amp;@! all over everything that‚Äôs being worked towards. He‚Äôs not allowing things to progress at all.
@realDonaldTrump Like Cohen.
@dbongino And it‚Äôs because of trump, &amp; NY citizens republicans &amp; democrats both who voted for the abortion law. Be honest!
@realDonaldTrump You want to see who‚Äôs an embarrassment to the country, look in the mirror. Grow up &amp; quit looking for people to attack. You‚Äôre Russia‚Äôs compromised puppet, your inept @ running the country, clueless of needs,racist, bully, unfocused, immature,stupid clown. YOUR THE EMBARRASSMENT!
@realDonaldTrump Stupid ass
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Your tweets are bothersome.The economy took a hit because of your shutdown trade deals made prices jump up for everyone, tax cut creating a trillion dollar a year deficit, the military you made sacrifice their lives &amp; families, millions of others negatively affected. Your 2yrs.
@StevenTDennis @GOP @realDonaldTrump That statement is true. Trump&amp; admin lie so much. He kept the govt closed, McConnell, &amp; republicans stood by&amp; watched millions of people struggle &amp; hurt. No one did anything to end. or condem it. Dems had to force this to an end. Thanks dems for  the effort. He‚Äôll do it again.
@dbongino Can you stop trying to diminish the reality of what‚Äôs going on. Special Counsel office doesn‚Äôt get an arrest warrant on a hoax. All the deflecting doesn‚Äôt change what it is.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump People aren‚Äôt stupid, it was caused by trump &amp; he had to open the govt. he didn‚Äôt do it because he wanted to he was made to. Public doesn‚Äôt forget especially the ones hurt &amp; made as sacrificial lambs.Those millions of Americans who are affected today &amp; for a long time remember.
@brianstelter @KatiePavlich @hogangidley45 Yes he caved. He had to. He harmed the American people, and he will again. He never tried to protect anyone. We‚Äôre pawns in his schemes. That‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs nothing but a liar.
@VP @WhiteHouse @BetsyDeVosED @POTUS They need to be fairly funded with teachers who know what their doing. Stop taking away from this arena. Give American students real quality education. That comes with more finances. Do what‚Äôs right for teachers/students alike. Empower our children all of them
@NancyEHoffman2 @qanon76 @realDonaldTrump could care less about anyone‚Äôs concession speeches. They‚Äôre all Bs even hers. Did she feel she couldn‚Äôt lose who knows,She‚Äôs not president. You‚Äôre bothered by something that changes nothing, it‚Äôs a distraction tactic, let it go it‚Äôs been yrs. life goes on, don‚Äôt be sidelined
@NancyEHoffman2 @qanon76 @realDonaldTrump As a matter of fact I do &amp; as to examining the man I make my own decisions based on what I hear &amp; see, &amp; for your information it does you no good to be bothered by other people‚Äôs opinions whether they are good, bad or indifferent it changes nothing. Bias, no bias you chose.
@Mikel_Jollett Decency vs compromised sociopathy
@qanon76 @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs a sociopathic narcissist. They thrive on creating chaos, drama &amp; incredible harm. He has no empathy for others, lies about everything to boost his ego. Why he would risk himself &amp; family. He won‚Äôt that‚Äôs what the secret service is for. They‚Äôre covered. Not everyone has that
@RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Stop threatening Pelosi &amp; democrats with the executive order of this president. It‚Äôs known, trump will use any excuse to blame someone else for the lousy choices he makes. He‚Äôs not man enough to stand behind those choices. It‚Äôs blame the other guy &amp; a few people buy the rhetoric.
@bennyjohnson Because he‚Äôs being treated like any other indicted criminal. Simple. Criminals are unpredictable. All of them regardless of who they are. No one gets indicted because their innocent. They have something on him they can prove.
@dbongino He can pull the deal &amp; once again show how immoral &amp; amoral he is. He‚Äôs to unpredictable to pretend he won‚Äôt pull the deal tomorrow. He‚Äôs disloyal, a liar &amp; worse than that, has no sense of loyalty to anyone. If Schumer wants to gloat it‚Äôs ok. Why do you care it‚Äôs an opinion.
@RepMarkMeadows They‚Äôre  more for the American people than republicans &amp; trump. So far they‚Äôve shown more strength &amp; compassion towards american people &amp; their lives.than anyone else. Thankfully they made it possible to open the government, &amp; I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôll do what‚Äôs right at the border
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Let it go already
@dbongino No we‚Äôll thank trump and his supporters for working overtime trying to discredit law enforcement, &amp; procedures. No one gets treated differently. If they don‚Äôt like the tactics taken, don‚Äôt be a criminal. Law enforcement deserves the countries support &amp; belief in what they do 100%
@realDonaldTrump Who cares, they were there &amp; reported the news. No one is surprised, we all new this was coming. If reporters being there was a problem then he shouldn‚Äôt have put himself in the spotlight, or do criminal acts to be indicted. Problem is he‚Äôs banking on trump to get him out of it.
@eviefordham @DailyCaller Good for him, what‚Äôs wrong with having your own opinions and applying it?
@kelseyjharkness Better to go down than overflow
@CNN This bill shouldn‚Äôt pass. It‚Äôs insane! Now your trying to force teachers to work w/ bad wages &amp; bs &amp; they can‚Äôt strike. A legalized  practice. Do we have so many teachers you can throw them out &amp; take their certifications, &amp; never let them teach again. What happened to the govt
@senatemajldr Then why do you consistently vote not to pass legislation to open the government? You‚Äôre in trumps back pocket as much as he‚Äôs in Putin‚Äôs back pocket. Both of you are shameful &amp; unrepresentative of most Americans. Don‚Äôt ever try to say you‚Äôre for US citizens, it‚Äôs not true. Lies.
@realDonaldTrump N. Korea is playing you like a violin. You‚Äôve accomplished nothing noteworthy. We know Un is your friend, you like him &amp; bow down to him &amp; his arsenal keeps growing. Progress right? Nothing‚Äôs being accomplished really, at least nothing worth mentioning.
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS How about the games trump plays with peoples lives every single day.  Where‚Äôs the damn emergency to fix the mess the creature created. Blaming everyone other than the person responsible. It‚Äôs trump! He‚Äôs the cause of all the problems. Open the government already. Enough is enough
@HouseDemocrats Because republicans aren‚Äôt willing to help open the govt or stand up to trump. They‚Äôre afraid to call out McConnell &amp; instead this administration is starving hard working, law abiding citizens. How difficult is it to know that. Do you not live in the real world? What a statement.
@latimes @latimesopinion Agree. Teachers deserve better pay &amp; our children deserve a much better, higher level of education. These kids are the future of what America will become. They deserve better than what they‚Äôre being given.
@nytimes Just like Pelosi said. Stings huh?
@USATODAY One for Pelosi!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Feels ugly for you to concede right. You must be hating life to have to write that statement. But feels great to know you‚Äôre bothered to the core of your existence. Feel the sting of shame. Be miserable, like you‚Äôre making millions of others feel it. Open the govt or no speech.
@thehill Same ol thing Mitch, shameful
@thehill And that‚Äôs not criminal behavior worth indictment? When anyone else commits this crime it‚Äôs jail time. Now it‚Äôs trump &amp; he gets a pass. Sickening
@realDonaldTrump Resign &amp; let America heal
@senatemajldr Now you‚Äôre trying to push his agenda again. You‚Äôre a frightened puppet for trump. Shameful.Trumps deal is once again just posturing. Americans are sick of this continual bs. Open the damn govt &amp; let people work or you &amp; him resign &amp; let Americans heal.
@KirstenPowers @washingtonpost Trump &amp; kids are wrong!
@realDonaldTrump GOVERNMENT CLOSED FOR MORE THAN A MONTH FOR NO GOOD REASON. AMERICANS SUFFERING. Big accomplishment
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre lying, And Pelosi knows exactly what‚Äôs going on in the world. Do you? It‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt care. Highly doubtful the state of union speech constitutionally required, regardless. No one wants to hear more lies from you. Forget the stupid fake speech no-one believes you.
@GOPLeader What‚Äôs to address? That he‚Äôs turned the country upside down. Releasing criminals early &amp; refusing to let law abiding citizens to get back to work &amp; be pd. Refusing to allow states to fund employees through unemployment. Threatening Cohen, aligning w/racists. What else can he say?
@GOP Democrats keep doing what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish
@nprpolitics Narcissist need to be seen.What‚Äôs the best he can say. He‚Äôs put a million plus people in financial hardships, refused to open the govt, making us work for nothing, lose our homes, healthcare, savings etc. the economy is failing. America is falling apart for a wall, makes no sense
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @senatemajldr Cute, you put your name on a bill to release criminals early. Remember, your drug addicts. Those who commit crimes like rape, murder, burglaries &amp; dirty our country w/syringes, crack pipes &amp; other drug paraphernalia to get their fix. What will your wall do to protect against them
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Tell trump &amp; republicans to stop lying to us. Sick of the same song &amp; dance. You guys are lying &amp; you know it. People are not as simple minded &amp; stupid as you think. Open the damn government already. You‚Äôve made enough people suffer for absolutely nothing but lies &amp; scams. ENOUGH
@IvankaTrump Then if that‚Äôs true have daddy trump open the government. Do you think We federal employees forget how difficult lives are with the government closed, or that doesn‚Äôt matter
@realDonaldTrump Explain yourself, why did you create the humanitarian crisis? What was the point? Why‚Äôd you do this, except to create the illusion of a crisis. Now there is&amp; you‚Äôre clueless how to fix it so you go to default &amp; blame dems. Open the govt &amp; let law makers find a solution you can‚Äôt
@realDonaldTrump You sound so stupid
@realDonaldTrump You easily sit &amp; watch all of us suffering, &amp; act like everything is good in the world. Clueless. All for this made up border situation &amp; republicans backing you. This is a black era for Americans. The nationalist are here. How do we get them out? Is that why he won‚Äôt open govt,
@realDonaldTrump Lying, You‚Äôll never stop but you‚Äôve been exposed. Humanitarian crisis you created it, dangers @ the border, wildly exaggerated, wall useless, millions of Americans are used as slave labor which is illegal,Losing homes, etc.Your bills are pd,have a home, healthcare. You‚Äôre fine
@Jim_Jordan Do you feel good to sit there &amp; spew out lie after lie to defend a pathological liar! he‚Äôs a train wreck, dishonest, disloyal, compromised, inept,inefficient, &amp;  completely untrustworthy. He needs to sign a contract promising to sign a negotiated proposal, or he won‚Äôt, he lies
@realDonaldTrump Ask yourself, every problem in Washington and the entire country is because of your doing. Every last one. All you bring is harmful choices, decisions &amp; an apocalyptic ending to America &amp; what she‚Äôs always stood for. You‚Äôre a clear &amp; present danger to this country &amp; the world.
@BarackObama Beautifully said
@realDonaldTrump So you can push the North Korean agenda while Putins in your.back pocket. What a treasonous individual. What does the rest of the world think when they watch &amp; hear what‚Äôs happened to the US. Fallen prey to 1 person with an agenda to make the US the next Russia/ NK/ China.
@doggiemomx3 @tedlieu @POTUS Love it.
@marcorubio @POTUS Their not being unreasonable. Trumps so called offer was a fake attempt to get you to believe he‚Äôs trying to move this along, the reality is he believes Americans are stupid enough to believe his fake statements so he can save face. No offer was made from him. Smoke &amp; mirrors.
@realDonaldTrump Stock market doesn‚Äôt go up or down because of trump. If he‚Äôs impeached &amp; removed pretty sure the stock market was go sky high.
@FamilyTrumpGolf @dcexaminer He was elected to run the country in the best interest of Americans. All he‚Äôs done is run the US into the ground &amp; create bs crisis so he can run his real agenda, Russia &amp; what he can do to help their agendas. He‚Äôs unfit to be in this position. He‚Äôs a lunatic that needs to go
@KRS8822 @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Hello, this country is in the most vulnerable state of affairs ever because of trumps decision to close the govt. He‚Äôs bringing the US to a collapse. His decision to attack &amp; force millions of Americans into financial hardships &amp; losses is anti- American. He‚Äôs what your praising
@dcexaminer He‚Äôs anti-American, it was his goal all along. He‚Äôs ripping America as a united country into pieces. Everyday something new to tear at. Law enforcement, government at large, stoking hatred towards everyone outside the country. Pledging loyalty to Putin &amp; Un by decisions he‚Äôs made
@dbongino You‚Äôre so disgustingly stupid it‚Äôs sickening. Trump is less than the garbage on the bottom of my shoe. He‚Äôs anti-American, pro Russia &amp; China. He‚Äôs lawless, a coward, inhumane, an uncaring lunatic who can‚Äôt deal with reality. And you‚Äôre praising &amp; brown nosing this thing. Crazy!!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs another lie born of the administration blatantly showing the American people are so stupid we can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs being done here. This pres offered nothing. All games, lies &amp; pretence. Nothing for American federal workers &amp; all American lives. Lies &amp; games over border wall
@GOP @realDonaldTrump After all these yrs, talk to democrats. you continue to pretend republicans didn‚Äôt control the government for two yrs prior to democrats taking the. House. Where was the crisis at the border then. This won‚Äôt help the re-election move to your side. You‚Äôre a cruel, dangerous,tyrant
@realDonaldTrump You can say it a million times, still isn‚Äôt true, the govt would be open &amp; we the  people wouldn‚Äôt be made to give a penny towards something not needed or wanted. But here we are our pay held hostage &amp; you trying to force us to pay for your wall. You think people are that stupid
@realDonaldTrump Just not if you‚Äôre low income scale
@Ask_WellsFargo That‚Äôs extremely helpful. Thank you
@CNN .No one can stop immigrants from crossing borders 100%, whether criminals or those wanting a better life. Trumps agenda, to have people afraid of immigrants, but doesn‚Äôt mention killers, drug dealers,gang members &amp; traffickers, legal citizens &amp; neighbors willing to kill us to
@HouseGOP So a point can be made that even though we have the barrier or wall  or slats it‚Äôs not 100% capable of keeping out illegals. However more personnel &amp; better equipment we may be able to do more to stop illegal repeat offenders.
@realDonaldTrump @RepGosar Did these.workers  get paid to stand with a lunatic to draw attention to a non problem. Or are they promised to get paid. Believing the worlds most insidious &amp; significant pathological liar?
@WellsFargo What good is that with a shutdown, how would you pay the mortgage
@RepLeeZeldin TRUMP is the one who condoned white supremacy in Charlottesville, &amp; TRUMP is the one who at his own rallies called himself a Nationalist. Never heard any democrats condone either scenario. TRUMP PROUDLY ANNOUNCED HES A WHITE NATIONALIST &amp; invited Americans to join him.
@realDonaldTrump How sad is it that we‚Äôre being held in limbo with our livelihoods at risk, hunger &amp; inability to purchase every day necessities because trump can‚Äôt get a win. Only a low life, inept, sociopath with no common sense &amp; decency would do this like Putin, Un, Assad, Saddam Hussein etc.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @SteveDoocy You rule for the few who brown nose you @ fox &amp; friends &amp; republicans, not for the country as a whole. Not in a democratic &amp; compromising govt but as a dictatorial regime willing to sacrifice millions of people to get what he wants whether it‚Äôs right or wrong. Is this new america
@realDonaldTrump With such a critical issue on the table, so many hurting, that‚Äôs what was irritating &amp; what you took away from the conversation  That you didn‚Äôt slam the the table. Wow, what a mind blowing thing to say! You‚Äôre completely shallow, narrow minded &amp; inept person for this position.
@realDonaldTrump Get out of office. It‚Äôs the only way
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump While you‚Äôre getting pd! what happens if a tragedy strikes, now deal. A stroke of a pen can open the govt. Do it. &amp; let‚Äôs work because federal workers matter if we get attacked by real terrorists. Are we willing to stand by quietly watching a lunatic president run &amp; hide his face
@dbongino But Americans aren‚Äôt willing to pay for it with their lives, or doesn‚Äôt that matter to those of you unaffected by the needs of weekly paychecks. Remember the economy grows when people spend. When there‚Äôs no spending the economy stalls, recession starts &amp; times get harder still!!!
@bsunnebrook @RepRonEstes Trump mimicking minion
@RepLeeZeldin They won‚Äôt negotiate to fund a wall but will negotiate to security. Tell the truth!
@realDonaldTrump Again you‚Äôre making Americans suffer &amp; leaving America vulnerable to threats across the globe, as real enemies of the US contemplate attack knowing this country is asleep at the helm. We‚Äôve been lucky but for how long? That‚Äôs on you. All for a wall &amp; nonexistent threats. Shameful
@realDonaldTrump Only trump could say something outrageously stupid, pathological, indefensible, &amp; prejudicial,is he trying to bend Californians to his will before he aggresses against us. The issue is the 1000s of homeless families who need femas help to rebuild. Not threats from a tyrant
@soccermomjenn @tedcruz @RepMarkMeadows B
@bsunnebrook @RepRonEstes I say my truth. Not dyslexic, not stupid to but trumps lies. Poor anyone else. I‚Äôm great
@bsunnebrook @RepRonEstes Ok thanks for the medical diagnosis
@SenTedCruz Bothersome when you don‚Äôt get your way, problem is you &amp; other republicans criticize democrats for not doing enough to protect security in the US. Now you‚Äôre blaming democrats for not providing security to foreign countries even trump doesn‚Äôt want to help. damned either way. Why?
@RepRonEstes Same old bs rhetoric w/o a mention of a solution or attempt at realistic conversation. Lies upon lies upon pretense of threats. Sickening. undesirable for any President, worse for the US president. the entire world‚Äôs watching, listening &amp; laughing. Security problem w/ no threatüò™
@RepMarkMeadows He‚Äôs blocking the path forward because he‚Äôs keeping the government closed and harming a lot of American families.  Facts are always facts. Lies demand a lot of lying, deflecting, inflating, corrupting, &amp; defending. Tell the truth. He won‚Äôt be foolish.
@HouseGOP Go outside your homes &amp; you‚Äôll find drug dealers, manufacturers, rapists, murderers, child abusers, human traffickers, heroin &amp; opioids, drug addicts..... everything, &amp; guess what, it‚Äôs American made, &amp; distributed. Doesn‚Äôt all come from the border.
@dwilki2 @esaagar @DailyCaller Cupcake really. Damn
@realDonaldTrump Trump is victimizing hundreds of thousands of us &amp; I don‚Äôt hear republicans demanding justice or help for those he swore to protect. It‚Äôs proven there‚Äôs no threat @ the border but America is vulnerable to terroristic situations now that the govt closed. Give trump a pen. Sign now
@JohnBoozman @POTUS Everyone‚Äôs been to the table. Give trump a pen &amp; conscience.
@HouseGOP Shame on non productive republicans who continue to promote trumps lies instead of standing with democrats to demand opening the govt&amp; making plans to negotiate with realistic solutions to border security on both sides. Only ones suffering&amp; paying the price are American citizens.
@BigBrotherNut @RepGosar Crime whether by legal citizens or illegal aliens is still the same. Splitting hairs doesn‚Äôt change the issue. Both way crimes are committed need to be resolved. Pretending there‚Äôs a crisis of criminals at the border is lying. 5.7 b in law enforcement would help. A wall won‚Äôt.
@BigBrotherNut @RepGosar That was the question. No answer?
@BigBrotherNut @RepGosar What about our home grown crime. What‚Äôs different? None should exist. Blaming immigrants solves none of it. It‚Äôs a cheap excuse for a lack of results
@BigBrotherNut @RepGosar Either is different nationalities
@esaagar @DailyCaller Great stand. Tell tell trump to step to the mantle and act like a man. Open the government
@BigBrotherNut @RepGosar That‚Äôs not a resolution it‚Äôs an excuse. Constantly blaming democrats is deflecting. Govt has 3 parts congress, senate, &amp; a president. Blaming &amp; deflecting isn‚Äôt resolving. It‚Äôs passing the buck &amp; waiting for next election to hang unresolved issues on the other side. Who‚Äôll win
@RepGosar Where have republicans been or done relating to crime, drugs, gangs, human trafficking, border security, &amp;  protecting us. Look around we have Am. illegal drug manufacturers, gang members, human traffickers, rapists, murderers, terrorists. Why was nothing done by rep control govt
@CNN He wants prime coverage to stroke his ego, lie about impeachment &amp; his ability to be. Gloat about the shutdown because mostly dems are affected &amp; that‚Äôs ok. Rep aren‚Äôt affected.Everyone wants a wall. He‚Äôs not corrupt no collusion, past cabinet members lie,not him. We‚Äôve heard it
@esaagar @DailyCaller @POTUS And yet potus didn‚Äôt sign it.
@MSNBC Question, can he just declare a national emergency w/o proof of it or does he have to have validated &amp; true evidence of a national emergency. Something legitimate &amp; concrete or just what his imagination thinks is an emergency?
@SenThomTillis Congratulations
@RepLeeZeldin No one wants to give trump a win! It‚Äôs a win to open the govt &amp; put 800,000 of us back to work. It‚Äôs not  a win get our pay, it‚Äôs not a win to have national security in our lands, seas, and air? This isn‚Äôt about not getting a win, it‚Äôs about how long he can take a bully stance.
@GOPLeader End the gridlock ask trump to open the govt. we need to work
@GOP @PressSec From threats. theres no threat at the border. Where are the militias, cannons, explosives, weapons, threats of violence, tanks, artillery preparations, anything? A  handful of poor, hungry, criminally violated against victims asking for asylum, asking to work &amp; live peacefully
@DailyCaller If it‚Äôs done he again leaves the country vulnerable to disaster. Earthquakes, floods, wildfires, natural disasters those funds could rebuild the country. Worse thought, if terrorists watching the turmoil attacked while govt‚Äôs closed &amp; undermanned those funds would help us rebuild
@RepMarkMeadows The wall is secured. Maintenance here and there, personnel is needed. Advanced technology needed. Expedition for returning to or allowing asylum seekers through is needed. Separation abolished. Jails &amp; tent cities abolished. Humanitarian resolutions &amp; compassion deserved. Resolve
@realDonaldTrump You make America sad
@realDonaldTrump Trumps the enemy of the people. Journalists report what he says, unfortunately he lies on every issue. He knows this while he‚Äôs on air &amp; answering questions. Then when journalists try to confirm whats said &amp; can‚Äôt because it isn‚Äôt true. It becomes fake news. Stop lying trump!
@ABC Why should we have to. But again as long as you‚Äôre unaffected keep punishing Americans. Manipulate those who follow you and when your decisions affect them they may wake up to the destructive choices forced on everyone. Open the govt! You‚Äôre wrong with what you‚Äôre doing.
@realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt know how truth works. Every time you open your mouth you pathologically lie deliberately. You‚Äôre a dishonest, amoral  male. You should never talk or complain about anything truthful The concept is lost on you.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn Sign the damn bill. Easy
@soccermomjenn @tedcruz @RepMarkMeadows What the hell are you referring to?
@SenSanders You just don‚Äôt care.
@HuffPost The fake news coming from the trump White House is finally challenged. A step in the right direction. What‚Äôs hard about being honest, it‚Äôs actually appreciated. Almost no one believes what comes from this administration. Where‚Äôs the gain? You gain distrust, anxiety, &amp; vengeance,
@GOP @marc_lotter @VP We haven‚Äôt received our paychecks. The statement is a lie.
@soccermomjenn @tedcruz @RepMarkMeadows Since there‚Äôs a wall in place right now why is he saying he needs to build a wall 1+1=2. He‚Äôs expecting another wall of concrete or Steel makes no sense the border wall is made with steel right now. Making a joke of the US
@soccermomjenn @tedcruz @RepMarkMeadows No mention of stupid wall. Said it‚Äôs convenient that Cruz offers a term limit now, only after dems took control. Why didn‚Äôt the bill come up in the years republicans controlled the entire govt. people voted them out for ineffectiveness. Scared, now asking for term limits. New US.
@IQ138Raleigh @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Low life‚Äôs. Raised in a sewer &amp; brown nosing a man who if you were on fire wouldn‚Äôt piss on you,he‚Äôd say something derogatory of you &amp; keep going. Pride means all things to people, vulgarity shows lack of respect for yourselves &amp; everyone  you know Mom,dad,kids, friends. ABUSIVE.
@KTLA Put it for a vote
@MSNBC Finally you realize
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Parroting trump makes you as dumb &amp; foolish as him. Unbecoming of you. Be yourself, if you‚Äôre determined to be a trump minion you‚Äôll lose respect &amp; friends, you‚Äôll never be appreciated. Chances are trump will defame you for fun, just to stroke his ego. And kick you to the curb.
@soccermomjenn @tedcruz @RepMarkMeadows I agree with republicans that are speaking up. They seem to cautiously realize their actions speak LOUDLY. They‚Äôre retreating from lunatic trump propaganda, trying to strengthen the party &amp; move forward with compromise opening the government.This is the best. Lose the extra wall
@Tetrimas @HuffPost True
@Mayes71Mayes @DailyCaller Grow a thick skin
@CNN Looking foolish is a no no, pathological lying, harming families, furloughs, working people w/o pay, weakening the countries security, being a know it all, defaming people etc... that‚Äôs ok though.
@AmbJohnBolton @StateDept Talk is cheap. Actions speak volumes.
@JudicialWatch And?  Is that really shocking. They‚Äôre terrorists. They were welcomed by other terrorists. Not surprised.
@SenThomTillis @thehill Voice of reason.
@carolwa29331980 So you want to follow up, then what? There will never be a complete resolution. Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs a crime, it goes to court, is litigated, lawyers will use delay tactics keeping the case going for years. End result nothing. Money talks bs walks. Beating a dead horse. Lawyers win.
@larryelder @BarackObama @RepRashida But Obama is a decent caring and honorable man. That can‚Äôt be said about trump. Obama is like a rose, trump is more fertilizer.
@MSNBC @maddow He wants to turn this country into an extension or a second Russia with him at the helm.
@JudicialWatch They‚Äôre out of office. Why is it important to drag this bs on. It will not be productive for trump or improve his status. It‚Äôs like beating a dead dog, fixes nothing. Sue trump to open the govt.Sue for moral and legal justices. There‚Äôs more to write about than trump &amp; Clinton‚Äôs.
@CNN It‚Äôs a great big SHUTDOWN. A pitiful excuse from trump to deny the reality of people‚Äôs suffering. This is no strike, no way. A SHUTDOWN affecting everything about the country. National Security, Tax Refunds, Paychecks, air traffic, national parks &amp; forestry. A 100% SHUTDOWN.
@TeamCornyn @JohnCornyn And trillion dollar deficits a year that middle &amp; lower class Americans have to carry on their backs.Good job! Forget about that.
@MSNBC He wants to call a national emergency on what basis? A handful of immigrants at the border? When America was attacked on 9/11 President Bush didn‚Äôt declare a national emergency &amp; drain the govt. He took retribution. President OBama finished it. How is this a national emergency?
@realDonaldTrump There‚Äôs a real problem for you to address. Let‚Äôs see how you take care of this situation. How will you rectify it for US citizens? Save us money. Show your skills where it matters.
@realDonaldTrump Imaginary problems. The problems in your head. The invisible enemies coming to the trump white america. Those problems.
@CalebJHull We care why?  Is trump scared or trying to mock? It‚Äôs not a competition, it‚Äôs an event she‚Äôs entitled to. Take the 1/1024 attitude &amp; lose it. Disgusting how everything is judged against the garbage that is trump. He‚Äôs not a meter to measure by. He‚Äôs a scared bully. Not a rally!
@ABC Amazing, trump so comfortable &amp; proud to make our govt institutions weak &amp; vulnerable, our people weak w/o pay, our country weak w/o proper security, our air space vulnerable to disasters, Hardships everywhere, &amp; doesn‚Äôt care. America the great. Why? A wall!
@KTLA Pass them.
@JudicialWatch Whats wrong w/ supporting trump?stories like this. A coup against trump, really! These are investigations of corruption &amp; the DOJs doing it‚Äôs job. Never has a president tried to discredit the DOJ/FBI It‚Äôs law enforcement. He wants us to believe it‚Äôs corrupt, not him. Incredible!!
@soccermomjenn @tedcruz @RepMarkMeadows Who said 30 yrs? I don‚Äôt hate trump. He‚Äôs not worth the energy. He‚Äôs 73 yr old with the mentality of a 2 yr old. He lacks knowledge, common sense, morality, decency, sympathy, compassion, understanding, cooperation, judgment, and an understanding of what it is to be an American.
@realDonaldTrump Working. If Americans mattered you‚Äôd signed the offers &amp; open the govt. But you‚Äôre big dumb mouth keeps going. Dems aren‚Äôt the only ones not paid. Republicans aren‚Äôt either. Easy for you to dump on dems, don‚Äôt they eat, have bills, or kids, but starve Americans. Your motto.
@NBCNews Can this be more disgusting. No one would accept or condone pedophilia ever. What a  disturbing action. Racist at heart. An article like this can get people killed. Damn. That type of trolling &amp; conspiracy creates such damage for people. It should be criminal.
@rachelbovard Jealous. The news can‚Äôt be light hearted for a minute. Oh wait, republican side get the spot light so condemn the other side. Pretty sure there‚Äôs a combination of religion, farmers and others on both sides plus more diversity on the democrats side. Just what it is. America
@johncardillo @TheRickWilson Great!! So true and entertaining.
@panhandledad1 @RepMattGaetz In English. Don‚Äôt get random letters
@CNN Thank you for your honesty. At least you admitted what so many see. For every republican who speaks up renews my hope for the redemption of the party.
@AP @colvinj How considerate, considering you won‚Äôt allow working class federal  citizens to get a paycheck, or pay raise because it‚Äôs too much (2%). However I‚Äôm sure the pay raise for the administration is more than 2%. Why &amp; how? Suck up to trump you‚Äôll eat &amp; pay bills. Everyone else suffer
@RepMattGaetz Now you know what it feels like to be scammed. It‚Äôs ok for republicans, but not so much for anyone else. Double standard. By the way democrats never said they wouldn‚Äôt consider impeachment, they‚Äôre waiting for the investigation to end to see if it‚Äôs appropriate. No fake news now!
@RepMattGaetz He‚Äôs more than corrupt &amp; contemptible. Any way anyone can get him out of office they should. He‚Äôs the shame of America &amp; American politics. A disgrace we forced upon the world, a clear &amp; present danger to American lives. US democracy feels like a dictatorial regime anymore. Sad
@RepMarkGreen Stop blaming democrats for what republicans didn‚Äôt do. Border issue hasn‚Äôt been a huge problem until the nutcase in the Oval Office made it one. Stop the stupidity. We have a wall &amp; it works. Republicans need to quit dragging the country into a nonsensical hysteria. Amazing!
@LouDobbs @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Maybe, but Americans voted for a democratic congress because republicans failed to do their jobs correctly &amp; efficiently. Followed the wrong ideology and lost. Democrats are not the only people who want trump out. Anyone with a 1/4 brain wants him out. He‚Äôs wrong for the US
@VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS Yes it‚Äôs a state of emergency caused by trump. He‚Äôs closed the govt, furloughed workers, holding paychecks hostage, harming Americans, prolonging tax refunds, not allowing border workers to work, coast guard not fully staffed. He‚Äôs made the US vulnerable to bad situations. Trump!
@tedcruz @RepMarkMeadows Now you want to attack congress, 3 days ago it was a republican led congress, there was no bill. All the yrs republicans had control &amp; accomplished little, Now you try to derail what Democrats may be able to do given a chance. Is this the new era Republican Party we‚Äôre to follow?
@MSNBC He‚Äôs a scam artist. Crooked all the way. Doing what most dictators do. Their way or no way. Forcing their will on all citizens. A dictator. Cold War, the Great Wall of Russia who thought the USA would be that way. Another Saddam Hussein in the making
@sendavidperdue Because he has a mind &amp; opinion of his own. Or because decency is a bad word for republicans. Decency in govt is essential.  Romney has no need for jealousy, the division in the party is trumps doing. At least Romney has guts to say what republicans won‚Äôt. Trump is trash.
@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC @RepMarshall So leverage is more important to you than the workers who‚Äôs lives are being hurt. Who have no income to live with. Funny how that doesn‚Äôt bother you all but, it‚Äôs always easier to ruin people lives while you‚Äôre still receiving paychecks.The house and senate should not get paid.
@JudicialWatch Mueller has to stay &amp; complete his job! He hasn‚Äôt overstepped his authority. What he has done is shown Americans the kind of criminal element in the White House &amp; swamp dwellers that came with it. Don‚Äôt be afraid,If your not involved in criminal activity he won‚Äôt investigate you
@latimes Govt shutdowns should be criminalized. No justification for this to happen. All this because trump won‚Äôt get what he demands. Waa. No protecting Americans and our way of life. He‚Äôll keep the govt closed because it doesn‚Äôt affect him or his life 1%. Selfish, hateful, vindictive!
@SenateGOP @SenShelby And a trillion dollar trump debt
@WhiteHouse Do right,open the government. Forget bullying to get your way put us back to work. You said you wanted to put America first well people working is putting America first. Building 2 walls is lunacy!Furloughs &amp; working for nothing is unamerican. Holding paychecks, a crime.
@WhiteHouse Unfortunate. he won‚Äôt admit the harm he‚Äôs doing to workers. As long as the government stays closed we don‚Äôt have enough people protecting the border wall or secure the waters so no one gets in that way. So trump, why can‚Äôt we get to work protecting borders? Secure the borders. Ok
@Jim_Jordan And republicans are destroying &amp; vocalizing loudly their approval of trump to destroy, harm &amp; devastate the American people, no reason other than to prove a tantrum &amp; bullying may be a win. Forget the damage done with the shutdown. Wow, And that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre proud of &amp; defending
@ABCWorldNews Horrible human, worse president in history, no empathy for the American families he‚Äôs destroying. Families he‚Äôs forcing apart. Lost work, &amp; pay, when we can‚Äôt pay our debts we lose everything. We‚Äôll lose our kids home. Dark, black days ahead. Help us from the devil trump in DC üôè
@realDonaldTrump Trump! success, keeping Americans furloughed and w/out an ability to live. Successful for you if we can‚Äôt pay our mortgages &amp; get foreclosed on? Or you‚Äôre successful when we send our kids to relatives so they can eat &amp; have utilities while our paychecks are held hostage. Success!
@SenTedCruz @RepRooney Again trying to screw the other side. First the lame duck session screwover now this. We‚Äôre not a country of only republicans. Feels like a takeover of free government &amp; down a road to a dictatorship run by nationalist majority. Germany 1939 except it‚Äôs 2019. 2 party democracy.
@realDonaldTrump All your greatness is in your head. You‚Äôve never been great, except at lying &amp; deflecting. You have never had 90+% rating on anything!! You‚Äôre pathetic old delusional man with a desperate need to feed your ego. That‚Äôs who the trump is. Open the government &amp; then stroke your ego
@RepMarkMeadows America wants me government open!!! Maybe they‚Äôll be able to use impeachment to get it done ‚úÖ. no one in the world deserves impeachment more than that individual. He knows it. He won‚Äôt resign to help the country. His big, dumb ego won‚Äôt allow it so get him out however. Go for it
@ABCWorldNews Yes he does, he created it. Own it. Tired of him making gross &amp; horrendous choices against Americans then blaming anyone and everyone else. He pretends to be a big man, let him accept responsibility  and act like a man. Open the government. Let Americans work again.
@KTLAMorningNews Die in jail
@APWestRegion @AP Keep him locked up
@AP Thank you democrats. We‚Äôre ready to get back to making a living. Stop trumps veto!!!
@NBCNews McConnell not bringing the measure up to vote says volumes about the bad, horrendous actions of republicans. Not allowing this vote to take place or encouraging trump to pass it speaks volumes. Put us Americans back to work and give us our paychecks or pay in 2020. Let us live!!!
@NBCNews It‚Äôs the nightmare trumps been hoping against. Reality check is not so fun.
@marcorubio Let‚Äôs hear it and start helping
@realDonaldTrump @cvpayne Not a hero. An over exaggerated ego and that‚Äôs the problem.
@SteveScalise @HouseGOP TRUMP SHUTDOWN
@GOPLeader @SpeakerPelosi TRUMP SHUTDOWN. Don‚Äôt shift blame. It‚Äôs TRUMPS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND FAMILY DECIMATION. trumps attitude problem &amp; temper tantrum is destroying lives and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supporting. We need our paychecks to live, keep our homes, utilities &amp; buy food. Let us work &amp; get paid!!!
@WhiteHouse IDIOT!!!!!!!!!
@WarrenDavidson @RepMarkMeadows @USTreasury @BrianKolfage There‚Äôs a wall already!!! Shame on you who deceive people stating horrors are at the borders. It‚Äôs fabricated &amp; untrue. We have homegrown terrorists, human traffickers, drug manufacturers &amp; dealers. Let‚Äôs stop these, then deal w/ those trying to cross the made border barrier.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Agreed
@SenTedCruz @StateDept Good to know. Thanks
@dbongino üòÑ funny
@HouseGOP Then stop being reckless also.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre lying! This statement made is a flat out lie. Shame on you for making this statement.
@Jim_Jordan republicans keep referring to the swamp, did you forget it was trump who promised to drain the swamp, and then he brought with him the largest amount of trash to load the swamp! He created the largest swamp problem ever. He‚Äôs the first member of the swamp that needs to go. Do it!
@maddow Figures. Is this the new Republican Party. What happened to the world. Shameful
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This is a sick and disturbing act from the president!!! An overgrown bully. Add personnel and upgrade equipment. That‚Äôs what is being asked for from border workers. The workers who know what they need.
@dbongino Because what‚Äôs said resonates with decent people. What‚Äôs  wrong with voicing their beliefs?Trumps immoral, corrupt, a liar &amp; dangerously inept. You‚Äôre comfortable supporting that but not everyone is. Romney is expressing what so many feel. Doesn‚Äôt make him a joke or unrepublican.
@SenThomTillis @SenFeinstein @SecPompeo @StateDept üëç
@Tetrimas @HuffPost 20/20 vision and the mind, well clear as a bell. You need not agree but deal.
@HuffPost Small price to pay, if you‚Äôre the lucky ones getting a paycheck.We eat and pay bills to. To say he wants protect us while we sleep from immigrants killing us, crazy, lies,we have Americans who kill us everyday in our homes. Let‚Äôs fix this problem. Or is it a different standard?
@dbongino describing trump to a T. He brought in everyone corruptible &amp; added them to the swamp. He has become more corruptable and contemptible. He‚Äôs dangerous &amp; unstable. It‚Äôs about time republicans started speaking up. Get the egomaniacal crook out of office. Anyone is better than him.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs the other way around. The infantile attitude needs to be dropped. There‚Äôs been too many offers made and trump is being the bully at Americans expense. Shame on him! Open our government. Stop the temper tantrum and do what‚Äôs right.
@dbongino Anyone who disagrees with the lunatic trump doesn‚Äôt make him wrong. Shows he sees the big picture. This administration is a disgrace for all Americans. Like it or not. Trump is bringing this country down. Fast!
@Tetrimas @HuffPost Really!!!!
@FAIRImmigration We‚Äôre out of balance now
@ABC Stay respectful Mr. McChrystal there aren‚Äôt enough men like you left in Washington
@BarryEhlert Beautiful baby. She‚Äôs great
@ABC @MarthaRaddatz Refreshing
@Mayes71Mayes @DailyCaller Bothered
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre so ineffective and insecure. Deep down I think you‚Äôre jealous of Hillary Clinton. Why is that I don‚Äôt know, but you can‚Äôt leave her alone. You‚Äôre no better.And though McChrystal was let go and has an opinion on you grow up and leave him alone to. Makes you sound stupid!
@realDonaldTrump Open the government and put our border security personnel back to work. YOU trump shut the government down &amp; put the borders at risk. YOU,made America unsafe the last 2 weeks. Migrants and terrorist have a golden opportunity now because YOU, trump made us vulnerable. You proud?
@realDonaldTrump Stop lying. Democrats care as much as anyone else, only they make sense in having a security budget, not a budget for a wall that‚Äôs useless &amp; unnecessary. we already have a barrier, man it! Upgrade what‚Äôs needed, stop lying about drugs &amp; criminals coming in on a large scale. Lies
@realDonaldTrump You are DERANGED.
@NBCNews It‚Äôs bad enough the way migrants are treated, but to then abuse the most vulnerable who have no say about anything in their lives is sickening. Get these kids justice. They‚Äôre human beings, treat them with respect. How hard can that be?
@DailyCaller I hope more union workers do the same. Trump needs to stop his nonsense and let everyone get back to work and pay them what they‚Äôre owed. His actions and attitude are destroying this country &amp; people. He‚Äôs hurting America and devastating all of us. We eat, and have bills to pay.
@DailyCaller It has never been a darker time ever. Our government was created during bad horrible times but none as bad as the last 2 years. America has been brought so low during this administration, it‚Äôs disgusting. Trump has done so much damage, scary to think what he‚Äôs going to do next!!!
@ABC Good luck to all you workers. I hope you get everything you ask for.
@realDonaldTrump The wall you want so badly is not a defense but a waste of money. As with the Great Wall of Russia during George H W Bush years any wall that goes up must come down.Eventually everything that goes up will come down! Everything! Understand your idea is wrong. Stop being a hater!
@GOP We DONT want the damn wall. Add extra security to the border, upgrade what they‚Äôve asked for. No, to a wall there‚Äôs already one!. There is a dramatic influx of immigrants because they are showing YOU they can come, and they‚Äôre proving their point! Stop your racist actions!!!
@CBSNews You and trump need to shut up!There‚Äôs a barrier there already. How about giving jobs to Americans to help protect that barrier. But it‚Äôs not good enough because ONE man says so. Stupid! Protection is one thing but building another wall is financially irresponsible and useless
@MSNBC A DICTATORIAL move. Americans are unwilling to live in a dictatorial society.
@MSNBC absolutely stupid! If everyone being hurt are democrats that‚Äôs alot of them. Good for democrats, dangerously bad for you. Positive for Americans though. What a tragedy America is in. What a tragic little, petty insect you are. Sorry to the insect. Don‚Äôt talk, shows your stupidity
@washingtonpost 100% accurate title
@KamalaHarris We have a commander and chief with no common sense. Unfortunate for Americans paying the price of a shutdown.Why the president gets pleasure in harming Americans? We need our govt employees working to protect our streets, &amp; borders, from foreign terrorists. Border security right?
@GOP Stop the insanity. Democrats hold your positions and don‚Äôt give the overgrown infant with a temper tantrum bully you into a wrong decision. He can‚Äôt shut the govt for long. Stand up to this insane bully
@realDonaldTrump You are no ones favorite! You are informed but dismissive , lying about ISIS, lying about border security, You,the bad and egregious decisions you make are destructive to the USA. These choices will bring terrorism to our front doors. Thanks! Worst president ever!! Disgraceful
@The_Trump_Train @DineshDSouza You are amazing. Lying is first nature to you. This garbage you make up and throw out makes peoples head spin. Stop lying and try concentrating on a job, at this point any job will do
@RepMarkMeadows The doj and fbi never had such supposed malfeasance under Mr. Comey. It‚Äôs being made this way to deflect the criminal actions of trump. The trumps goal is to divide the country and prentend how his lying family is getting unfairly railroaded. Then he‚Äôll blame democrats.trumps lie
@FOXLA Too cute
@MSNBC The only people that advanced themselves on the trump name advanced themselves to jail and out of their careers. Most pathetic statement she could make. Trump name is synonymous to trash
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump To little to late. Publicly stunt that proves 0
@realDonaldTrump A trump scam. You‚Äôre a crook and you want to get away with it. Always deflecting never can man up and admit to your crimes. Admit and stop blaming everyone who went out of their way to protect you. They‚Äôre doing time, you should do yours. That‚Äôs how to make America great again!
@realDonaldTrump Never in history has a president been  so dishonest, criminal and a liar. Complain all you want about the press. If it‚Äôs dishonestly reporting the news it‚Äôs because the liar of the free world is talking faster than the news media can fact check. Stop lying and the issue goes away
@MSNBC You would be proud of such a low blow. But that‚Äôs who you are. Remember though turn around one day and maybe even an overturn by the judicial system. But if not republicans will be paid in kind at some point. Don‚Äôt be so smug. It‚Äôs a low life move. True to your forum
@realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs not what he said or that it‚Äôs illegal. The only illegal action that‚Äôs been done is what you and your associates did
@realDonaldTrump Liar
@realDonaldTrump COLLUSION
@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera You‚Äôre in it up to your neck. You‚Äôre drowning on what to do next. Resign like a real man and never look back
@realDonaldTrump You have the audacity to downplay anyone‚Äôs service record, you ran from military service. You are a coward, and attacking anyone‚Äôs service records should never come out of your mouth. You don‚Äôt have the right.
Leave this beautiful classic the way it‚Äôs supposed to be. A Christmas special. Children don‚Äôt need to grow up being cynical about a beautifully created program. Sit and watch it,let them get a thrill from it. Give them popcorn and laugh when it‚Äôs funny and enjoy
The 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' Special Is Coming Under Fire for Its 'Disturbing' Themes https://t.co/dt9i1w1wZL
@NBCNews A good and respectable man Bob Dole. You‚Äôre a great example of dignity and honor. Salute to you too.
@CBSNews God Bless. May you have eternal peace
@realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt worry about Mueller. He knows how to do his job. It doesn‚Äôt matter what he might say or do it only matters what the end result shows. He‚Äôs obviously well at taking care of the crooks you surround yourself with and put in office
@realDonaldTrump Congress needs to fund a way to shut your mouth permanently
@realDonaldTrump Anyone who disagrees with the baby trump is fake. Grow up already
@realDonaldTrump No democrats didn‚Äôt create situation it‚Äôs been policy since the country was formed. You are making it a problem because you‚Äôre a hateful little man and you want other racists to come out and help divide the country. What.are you so scared of?sick of this nonsense!
@NBCNews Because he‚Äôs a hateful, vicious and racist person
@washingtonpost But at the gratitude of many more millions.
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre costly and dangerous. You should be detained and deported, problem is no one an no wher will accept you
@realDonaldTrump Shut up already. This is as disgusting as you. Find something else to do. You will never stop the immigration process, it‚Äôs unamerican. This country is based upon immigrants of every race and culture. That‚Äôs what makes America a great country. Not you. You bring us down.
@maddow Great
@Wesley_Inman @StateDept @SecPompeo Like the Berlin Wall it would eventually come down to. Instead of billions on a wall use the money to feed our homeless
@Curly_Renard @HuffPost Ok.
@Curly_Renard @HuffPost No sense in responding to nonsense. Unfortunate
@Curly_Renard @HuffPost Do you know how stupid that sounds? And by the way trump is a proven liar. Pathological in fact. Try looking at things from behind a fog
@realDonaldTrump How about dealing with today‚Äôs issues and stop criticizing issues of the past. They‚Äôve been resolved and you had nothing to do with it. Seriously you can‚Äôt stop complaining about anything?
@Tetrimas @HuffPost Nice excuse but that‚Äôs all it is. An excuse, someone to blame because you don‚Äôt like a result. Legal citizens voted, just differently.  That‚Äôs why democracy works for everyone.
@Suzdee1 @realDonaldTrump brain dead, sociopathic, no empathy he bullies etc..no decency,he‚Äôs corrupt,temper tantrums. Disgusting! Can‚Äôt interact with people. He‚Äôs the devil in your face. He tries acting knowledgeable so his stupidity stays hidden. He‚Äôs a lie,deny, deflect. Deny death tolls. Predator!!
@Tetrimas @HuffPost What you‚Äôre saying is an Unproven theory. Why let us count everything. Fair elections are for everyone who registered and voted must be counted.Americans there‚Äôs a corrupt, nationalist with criminals around. This man we let take away our rights because he‚Äôs afraid to lose.TRUMP
@Tetrimas @HuffPost Florida‚Äôs countings BEEN last.They realize every ballot NEED be COUNTED FREE DEMOCRACY in the WH. Democracy must SHAME NATIONALIST OUT Let‚Äôs rebuild our UNITED COUNTRY,AND EMBRACE THE CONSTITUTION. WE FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW. (THE GOV) RETURNS IN JAN. COUNT EVERY BALLOT IMPORTANT
@realDonaldTrump Yes he was. Twice!
@LakerGMC @TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC Yes
@realDonaldTrump @VP No one asks you because they‚Äôre tired of being lied to. We all know your answer ‚Äúyou like the man, you work well and you trust him blah blah blah. And then there‚Äôs the truth
@HuffPost It‚Äôs a scare tactic, he knows the people who are embracing his views will believe, It‚Äôs amazing how never before has their been fraud and corruption at this level. Why is trump the only one who knows how bad things are. It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs in his head, he wants mistrust.
@Curly_Renard @HuffPost Stop with the fake news It‚Äôs the president saying it because he knows those who repeat it are basically uniformed and parrot his crap with out knowing what their talking about. Trump is the only one who spews fake news. Journalists fact check so they don‚Äôt give fake news. Learn
@WSJ Please leave the classics the way they were originally created. Don‚Äôt take the innocence of what it is to make it ugly.
@beverly88keys @realDonaldTrump True intentions are poor people walking thousands of miles to ask for asylum from the greatest country in the world and knowing it‚Äôs not guaranteed but still willing to make the effort in hopes of being able to work, and have a safer life. Those are the intentions.
@Suzdee1 @realDonaldTrump I know who he is and what he has said and done, I‚Äôm so disgusted with trump as president. But we as Americans need him to know the hatred he spews is intolerable and we don‚Äôt want to hear it. He should keep his belligerent views to himself and work or go back to the public sector
@scubashawn21 @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm home
@realDonaldTrump So full of it. You can be proud of where you were born &amp; of your country and still flee from violence, hunger, crime, and poverty by asking for asylum. One doesn‚Äôt take away from the other. It‚Äôs more than ok to fly their own flag and ours too. Don‚Äôt be so hateful
@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC It‚Äôs outrageous. How this isn‚Äôt considered criminal is beyond me. The new session doesn‚Äôt start til Jan. Why can‚Äôt these votes be counted?People waited for hours to vote, they wanted to be heard so because trump is afraid of the outcome US citizens don‚Äôt get their votes counted.
@maddow We need to know who‚Äôs being put into government positions and what type of person they are. Credibility matters and yours isn‚Äôt good
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not COLLUSION. Like you say. There was NO WRONG DOING on behalf of the dnc, if there was they would have the server/ harddrive and investigation, indictments all of it. You‚Äôre angry and having a fit. Get over yourself. Do some work and drop dead issues. It doesn‚Äôt work.
@realDonaldTrump College kids will know the President is a pathological liar who surrounds himself with corrupt  people creating situations where special councils needed to be brought in to keep democracy safe. None of the people he named are corrupt that‚Äôs why their not investigated. Stop lying!
@realDonaldTrump There‚Äôs no witch hunt. It‚Äôs just that the DOJ isn‚Äôt going to waste time, money, resources and personnel to run an agenda which is to bully others because you‚Äôre vindictive. Work and let everyone else work. Get off Twitter. We pay you to be productive not sit on Twitter and rant
@HuffPost The US isnt the envy of anyone since trump became president. Even our allies are backing away from us and questioning if we can be trusted. That‚Äôs not envy. That‚Äôs uncertainty. And that‚Äôs a shameful stain to these United States. A dark spot in kids history classes and on you
@realDonaldTrump This is what I mean. The Mueller investigation is on target no one is hearing about screaming and all the other ridiculous arguments you say. These things are happening in the WH. Muellers investigations are moving forward as needed. STOP DEFLECTING. Go work let Mueller work
@TIME President is a CRAZY OFF THE CHART LUNATIC. This kind of  CONSPIRACY THEORIES exsists in his mind only. He cannot accept reality, he can only accept what is, or appears to be because of him. Everything else is a hostile, and inaccurate account on him. GROW UP THIS IS DISGUSTING
@realDonaldTrump No they don‚Äôt, stop whining. Go to work. Life has a pattern quit trying to change it. Go with the flow. Stop blaming the NEWS. THEY FACT CHECK!!!!and that‚Äôs because you lie so much so they have to protect their reputations and make factual news. Stop lying problems fixed
@realDonaldTrump No you won‚Äôt. The real news media already brought it to the surface.
@Mike92882 @latimes @CNN Asking questions isn‚Äôt causing a problem. That‚Äôs the job. An over reactive trump afraid of being asked legitimate questions created the situation to avoid answering. It‚Äôs what he‚Äôs afraid of. He didn‚Äôt want to be called out when he lies
@latimes Proud of CNN for protecting Mr. Acosta‚Äôs right to cover the White House . It‚Äôs unfortunate that trump did what he did then tried to pretend an assault took place. He‚Äôs crazy nuts. But maybe this will show him he needs to keep his personal hatred to himself &amp; stop being foolish
@latimes I‚Äôm glad to see that CNN has filed suit for Mr. Acosta. I always appreciate a company that defends their journalists especially when they are being targeted for doing their job. President should know you can‚Äôt hurt someone‚Äôs l car
@ABCWorldNews @MichelleObama Yes I agree and thank you for helping to put the word out
@NBCNews Once a BULLY always a BULLY
@realDonaldTrump Always threatening, it‚Äôs always don‚Äôt hurt trumps tender and delicate feelings or you‚Äôll be the next target of something. No military help, tariffs, sanctions whatever the hell he feels like saying just so he can make his ego feel better and make the US look stupid and dangerous
@realDonaldTrump Not fake news, it was too little to late. Not only that but everyone else made it. So what you say makes no sense at all
@realDonaldTrump Deflect and try to accuse someone else of being more disgusting than you. Didn‚Äôt see that coming. Haha. We all knew it was coming. Accept who you are and stop trying to make people fit your mold. People who call you out as a nationalist don‚Äôt make them nationalist
@realDonaldTrump Doesn‚Äôt like being called out as the nationalist that he is so what does he do next attack an ally with tariffs. What the hell. Let‚Äôs just enjoy our wine. But no, for trump it‚Äôs about payback.
@HuffPost He blames everyone for everything. Remember in his little head he‚Äôs always right everyone else wrong
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs causing you big problems. The stock market is just fine. And life is fine go complain to your family
@CNN The blame game is old. Be a man and grow up already
@washingtonpost You lost because people lost confidence in you
@SecPompeo @JZarif Stop acting like trump. News is not fake because you don‚Äôt like what is said. News is fact checked!!!! And if by some reason something is wrong the news always makes their corrections. Don‚Äôt follow the trump way. It‚Äôs sickening. Down right disgusting!!!!
@NBCNews This is so disgusting, 73 and having a fit. To let him circumvent the election is criminal,in America every vote gets counted. It‚Äôs been that way for hundreds of years. Because you may lose doesn‚Äôt give you the right to make up your own rules. Democratic rule runs this country.
@realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs exactly why the Europeans are calling to protect themselves even from the US. Because this president is a loose cannon and the world is afraid of the unpredictability of the president. So the world is reacting to trump and are preparing to protect themselves.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC No! Trump is an embarrassment to himself but also to Americans. He was supposed to be a representative to our fallen soldiers. All he had to do was read a script giving respect to our fallen heroes. A few well deserved words and he failed. Like always. FAILURE trump
@realDonaldTrump According to trump and his lackeys the whole world is unfair to the US. Trump can be a cry baby how long. How about  coming together with those you feel so strongly about and COMPROMISE for a solution instead of acting like a dictatorial nationalistic money hungry sociopath
@NBCNews Thank you President Macron. So far you are the only political person to denounce nationalism to the world. To bad it had to come on this day but I‚Äôm glad it was said. Unfortunately our American politicians were to afraid of being ostracized but you did and survived. Thanks.
@realDonaldTrump Quit talking about mismanagement of funds. You don‚Äôt know that to be true. What is true is that we have plenty of fire engines to be on scene, firefighters to work the scene, ability to get the water they need. The list goes on. Mismanagement? Uncorroborated statement trump!
@realDonaldTrump No one can STEAL an election. People lose. It‚Äôs called democracy. Get educated and let it go already
@NBCLA Again stating something he can‚Äôt verify. How does trump know there‚Äôs any mismanagement of funds? He doesn‚Äôt!!! However it‚Äôs a convenient way to threaten California, a state in which he holds in very low regard. A state he has attacked too many times. I know he‚Äôs all talk but....?
@TIME Well he surely can‚Äôt get his hair wet
@NBCLA Even natural disasters are being called into question by this president. Let‚Äôs pretend he‚Äôs right and there‚Äôs mismanagement of money. How does that change the issue of a wildfire? Thank God we are well prepared to fight the unexpected and unpredictable events that are occurring.
@NBCNews It shouldn‚Äôt bother anyone. These veterans deserve to have a respectful and dignified president visit these sights. Not this one. Let these vets rest in peace
@realDonaldTrump Nice of you to say. But you‚Äôre also threatening to cut funding for California firefighting efforts. So which way is it?
@realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt ever get tired of LYING? Do you think everyone is stupid? Oh my God you must be mentally ill or some kind of  psychopath!!!! I‚Äôm living in  an Alice in wonderland nightmare. Do you understand the damage you‚Äôre doing to this country? Do you care. I know NO!!!!!!
@NBCNews Because he‚Äôs trying to control something he can‚Äôt. He‚Äôll keep trying. He‚Äôs trying to be dictatorial. Trying it on for size because he‚Äôs wanting to move the country in that direction
@hardball @MSNBC @JosephSakran NRA cares only about $. Lives are just casualties that happens. But how would they feel if it happened to some. You gf them, would their perspective change? $$$$$
@ItWorksbyJenni @realDonaldTrump No it‚Äôs not surprising. Those ballots are being carefully counted and that takes time plus factor how many are being counted. Nothing suspicious about it. Open your eyes and mind
@jonswaine @maddow Criminals connect.
@Sir_D_Duke @jonswaine @maddow @LauraAJarrett You as trump are lunatics. President is corrupt and associates with corrupt people. This is what they know. People who are naive and uninterestied in seeing reality for what it is believe in trump and his administration. Try to broaden your mind. Stop hiding behind your finger.
@realDonaldTrump Well why shouldn‚Äôt they? With such an irratic and irrational US president every country is probably thinking the same thing. You really shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. You hurt America. Now allies are fearful instead of thankful. Your decisions our consequences.
@realDonaldTrump Republicans did get votes as you know. You‚Äôre afraid they won‚Äôt get enough. They may still. Calm down. It‚Äôs not the end of the world if Democrats win either.
@Forbes He‚Äôs as corrupt as the people he surrounds himself with and that makes him a dangerous leader to Americans and the world in general.
@realDonaldTrump Signatures get tweaked by many people every day. Let it go. Not only that minutes ago you were complaining about ballots still being counted and now you want Az to recount ballots,Learn to live with the results. You‚Äôre not going to win everything.
@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Time to count all ballots
@CBSNews You‚Äôre just an incredibly immature and vindictive person. You are doing all this to suppress journalists who don‚Äôt agree with you. In essence you‚Äôre trying to control what is said &amp; written in your favor only. Unamerican!!!
@realDonaldTrump Why are you so afraid of what the polls will show? And get over the Russia subject what are you afraid of there?
@realDonaldTrump No, this is democracy hard at work. Everyone knows that states are still counting. This is the Americans way. Thought you were American?  73 years old and you don‚Äôt know this yet, really?
@MSNBC Trump has the audacity to tell Mr Acosta that he‚Äôs rude and not a good person. Does he see the hypocrisy? Look in the mirror mr trump. Just listen to the things you say to and about people, are you kidding
@HuffPost If you are think your loyalty is going to be appreciated by this president. You‚Äôre wrong, so why do you keep doing his deceitful bidding. Why not say the truth. Is it really that hard?
@brithume It‚Äôs great to ask the hard questions but when you have a president with a personal grudge and who is afraid to answer those questions is disrespectful to journalists the other journalists should wait their turn and show solidarity with the 1st journalist. Same could happen to you
@HuffPost You need to grow up to. It was rude disgusting and disrespectful for the so called young woman to go up and grab the microphone from Acosta. He did nothing wrong. Quit defending the wrong!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôve been on the news saying you he economy is the best ever and we have more jobs than unemployed so how do immigrants wanting to come work hurt our economy, schools, hospitals and communities?  Liar
@realDonaldTrump They laugh at you and the stupidity of Americans voting you into office. We are a laughing stock of the world
@MSNBC Trump seems to know little to nill about birthright citizenship. He needs to know how to do his job and leave his rude and unwanted opinions to himself. Other people have opinions also and it‚Äôs ok to hear them. Other people matter
@MSNBC Send our troops where they are needed. It‚Äôs overseas to help protect innocent people looking for their salvation against crime and violence on them. Let‚Äôs try to help others in the world find they‚Äôre democratic existence without the violence they endure and the real threats.
@MSNBC You‚Äôre CRAZY!!!!! What the hell kind of bs lies are you expecting people to believe! You‚Äôre INSANE!!!!! Men, women and children looking for a peaceful place to call home. You‚Äôre a FANATIC LUNATIC RACIST. We need to LOSE YOU QUICK!!!!!!!!!!!!! The DANGER IS YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@NRCC Why? If we don‚Äôt do we become targets of his venomous rants. Does he get the ok to bully those people? Why would anyone want to be a part of this?
@realDonaldTrump They quote you. Hello. So stop lying and then the information will be right
@FoxNews @PressSec No he looks for ways to control what his ideal Americans look like. That we  can‚Äôt temporarily use government assistance, that we‚Äôre not Black, we‚Äôre not Middle Eastern, Asian, especially Hispanics. But blond, and blue eyes that‚Äôs different. Fair skinned that‚Äôs ok to. Sick perver
@CNN Please spread the news on tv, radio, newspapers, and magazines anywhere people can get information. We need to do so much more for our wildlife and our climate. Keep on communicating, we have to learn
@NRCC No!!!!!
@FOXLA You‚Äôre such a lowlife individual. Look at your own heritage go back as far as possible and see that your ancestors immigrated from somewhere and you think you have tha ability to take that God given right away from others. Who do you think you are?
@MSNBC You‚Äôre so hateful and wrong. You don‚Äôt get disgusting with yourself? This is not 1939 Germany. You can‚Äôt wipe out a group of people with a swipe of a pen. What are you afraid of?
@CNN Yes, please keep it quiet
@MSNBC Hey Trump. YOUR NATIONALISM is feeding the country. Clashing with the FBI and trying to encourage fear and disruption. Sleep well tonight!!! Is this what you call unification? Not good old man. What else is there to be a witness to. üëé
White nationalist accused of violence at political rallies surrenders to FBI https://t.co/IOcskMuKL3 via @NBCNews
@realDonaldTrump You still don‚Äôt get it. IT IS ABSOLUTELY 100% YOUR FAULT. There‚Äôs no such thing as fake news. That‚Äôs your lie. Your trashy, ugly lies and deception is what‚Äôs causing the circumstances in our society. Be a decent human being and follow a script and don‚Äôt deviate.
@Forbes Looks beautiful. Very rare, but great to watch
@chrismaffia2 @TheView Are you brain dead or unaware of reality. Every presidential and midterm elections throughout history brings out the ugly side of candidates but never has a candidate promoted violence and rejoiced in it. Only Trump!!!!!! Yes others participate but to defend.
@MSNBC Didn‚Äôt agree with everything Grassley did at the confirmation hearings, but this I agree is a correct decision. Their accusations were atrocious and if she knew as she said she knew of what happened at the party‚Äôs then she is a conspirator for not warning other women
@ABCWorldNews You don‚Äôt help Americans by lying to try to protect Trump. He is absolutely 100% more to blame for the bombing attacks than anyone. His position is not to divide, reak havoc, demean, threaten, promote violence, or attack people. He does it all, and people want to please him
@realDonaldTrump Stop attacking the media already. You have no credibility on the things you say. They fact check!!!!! You on the other hand lie like you take in oxygen. Not credible!!! Grow up. 72 and still afraid of honesty. You should be very quiet on the subject.
Shameful that the leader of the United States is authorizing US border patrol agents to shoot immigrants at the border if they come in. Remenisant of 1939s hitler era. Fear, hate, distrust, anger, dishonesty,and blame. These people a life. That‚Äôs our solution? https://t.co/UR7lQhpTeV
RT @FoxNews: .@SecNielsen: "Everything is on the table to make it very clear that we have a sovereign right to protect our citizens." #TheS‚Ä¶
@FoxNews @foxnewsnight Desperate for a better life and the greatest country is afraid to let them in so they can work and live better than they were. How disgraceful a government we have today.
@IvankaTrump @FOXLA @CNN @SecretService Too bad Trump senior can‚Äôt acknowledge the sacrifices of these institutions. These are the same law enforcement agencies he constantly condemns and talks so badly about, does he see now how valuable they really are. They‚Äôre not corrupt like he accuses them to be
@latimes @KTLA Adorable and beyond sweet. Hope she had fun.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS How would you know. Just another lie. The way you said we Californians are rioting. Lies. All lies all the time. Who can trust what you say anymore. The cost of dishonesty!
@VP @WhiteHouse Trumps rhetoric will destroy any chance. We all know it
Trump points finger at opponents, media on day when bombs sent to Democrats and CNN  @CNN https://t.co/oBN6fyFywX
@realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs so special about Kemp. Can you tell me one thing he‚Äôs done for Georgia. Oh you can‚Äôt it‚Äôs just that he claims republican status ‚òπÔ∏è
