To lure #AmazonHQ2, Northern Virginia promises taxpayer-funded “incentive” packages. Deals like this stick taxpayers on the losing end. https://t.co/fiJ5EKjv3Y
NC taxpayers have already been forced to cough up hundreds of millions of dollars in handouts to big companies under Gov. Cooper. But if Amazon picks Raleigh for its new HQ, they’ll be on the hook for even more. https://t.co/0GvtML91oI
