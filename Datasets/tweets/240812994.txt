The @OfficialCBC is fighting to restore our voting rights, empower workers, boost educational opportunities, improve access to affordable housing, and more. We know what's at risk for our commmunity- but that's why we know we can't, and won't, give up.
In 2016, Trump asked Black voters "What do you have to lose by voting for me?" Black voters knew the answer would be "A lot." We've lost more than we could have imagined - but the @OfficialCBC will not back down.
I am so grateful for the hard work of our District office interns here in Brooklyn. Thanks to @DelStateUniv @AmericanU and #HSTAT in Brooklyn for bringing their best and brightest students to #TeamClarke. https://t.co/pWnvIFiAHb
Nearly 70,000 people in my District are small business employees - their jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by the #GOPTaxScam's poor and underdeveloped policies.
The #GOPTaxScam will cost the federal government $2.3 TRILLION dollars. Who will bear the costs of this law? Small business owners.

I am deeply troubled by the brutality exhibited at a local nail salon in my District. No business owners or their employees should ever be allowed to attack, maim, or humiliate any customer. This type of behavior should not and will not be tolerated in our community. https://t.co/17HgHfNSSP
I support equal pay because I know the worth of a hard-working Black woman. We are the fastest growing entrepreneurs and the most educated group in this country. Our communities witness our impact, so we must be paid at our value. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay #DemandMore
The average Black woman makes 38% less than the average white man. If you were paid fairly, what would you do with 38% more? #replytweet #BlackWomensEqualPayDay #38PercentCounts
Today is #BlackWomensEqualPayDay. This means the average Black woman must work until August 2018 to be paid what the average White man was paid at the end of December 2017. We should all be outraged.

#BrettKavanaugh upheld South Carolina‚Äôs restrictive voter ID laws, has challenged affirmative action, wants to overturn Roe v. Wade, the #ACA and more. It's emerged that Kavanaugh was against a unanimous decision by #SCOTUS, which forced Pres. Nixon to disclose Watergate tapes.
I am blessed to have politically aware constituents who are concerned about the current #SCOTUSpick. As a black woman, I know how critical the Supreme Court is to American liberty and freedom. That‚Äôs why I vehemently oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.
I signed a letter to ICE Acting Dir. Vitiello on telephone access policies for parents who are detained &amp; separated from their children. Parents are being charged $8/minute to talk with their children. I strongly believe no parents should be charged to speak with their children.
I'm a co-sponsor of H.R.6361, @RepJayapal's bill to #AbolishICE. The GOP pulled a political stunt, refusing to bring this bill to the Floor for a vote. They held a vote on H.R. 990 - Supporting the officers &amp; personnel who carry out the important mission of ICE. I voted no.
Nearly 3,000 children are STILL separated from their families ‚Äì and the GOP are blocking our efforts to solve this.

I am a co-sponsor of H.R. 5476- Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act and H.R. 3654 - Special Counsel Independence Protection Act. These bills are crucial because Congress must take a stand against 45's attacks on the Special Counsel &amp; his investigation by protecting it.
My constituents are concerned about the security of our future elections and our democracy, as it is crystal clear that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. To make matters worse, the entire world watched 45 defend Putin and undermine Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation.
#ChatWithYDC is starting now‚Äî join me on my telephone townhall where will cover the key issues impacting us from foreign affairs to domestic issues.

I've also asked Mr. Zuckerberg what Facebook has done to stop these kind of racially divisive tactics from being exploited on the platform.
I've asked Mr. Zuckerberg if the lack of diversity in Facebook's C-Suite is a reason in which the company could not investigate these claims that incited racial division.
Those ads specifically targeted African-American groups particularly, Black Lives Matter in which ads suggested they were a rising threat.
There have been media reports about how more than 3,000 Russian ads were bought on Facebook to incite racial &amp; religious division &amp; chaos in the US during the 2016 election.

I am glad to have connected with my #NY09 constituents during tonight‚Äôs #ChatWithYDC focused on the #GOPTaxScam &amp; the #TrumpBudget. I thank my constituents for participating, and for my policy experts from @amprog @CAMBAInc @FiscalPolicy00 &amp; @taxmarch for the thoughtful dialogue.
@SalonDeLaGuerre Hi Liam, these tweets are live from my #ChatWithYDC to educate #NY09 on policies within the GOP tax bill that my constituents have questions on. Check us out at https://t.co/wabx77gdC9. Q&amp;A happening now! All are welcome.
Thank you to policy expert Jonas Shaende from Fiscal Policy Institute for joining us. He describes the #GOPTaxScam as a ‚Äúlong-term hazard for the disabled and seniors.‚Äù
Lawmakers in Congress need to look out for all Americans when creating legislative decisions that directly impact their Districts. I will only support a tax plan that reflects what‚Äôs best for #NY09. Your voices matter.
The tax bill should be a reflection of the needs of the average American. Instead, the #GOPTaxScam ensures that the 1% is protected, while the middle &amp; working class suffers from 20% deductions &amp; the corporate tax rate being lowered from 35% to 21%, @SethHanlon reminds us.
The GOP tax bill scams the majority of Americans, except for big businesses and the 1%. Small businesses owned by people of color and the middle class will be the first businesses hit by the #GOPTaxScam.
Brooklyn is a hub for small businesses. From restaurants to tech startups to art galleries, and more, our local economy is driven by the success of small businesses.
The #GOPTaxScam puts the benefits that hard-working Americans deserve directly into the pockets of corporations.
‚Äú50% of NY State tax cuts will go to the wealthiest 5%.‚Äù -Nicole Gill, @taxmarch. Where does that leave the majority of hard working New Yorkers? #NY09 deserves better than the #GOPTaxScam.

Both Congressional and Mueller investigations should run their course without interference.

45 created the DACA crisis by ending the program in September.  He called on Congress to act by March 5, but his vulgar and disgraceful rhetoric, contradiction, and a lack of urgency are the cause of the uncertainty and fear among #DREAMers and their families.
I am a co-sponsor of @RepJudyChu's #ReunitingFamiliesAct because:	 	1. It would reduce family visa backlogs.	2. It promotes humane and timely unification of immigration families.		#ASPIRETPS #DREAMers #DACA
#TPS has received bipartisan support, but Trump ended yet another program. I introduced the #ASPIRETPS Act, which would protect eligible immigrants to the U.S. who would otherwise be sent back to life-threatening conditions.	#ASPIRETPS #DREAMers #DACA #SaveTPS
The State Department offers 500K visas a year, and in the last 5 years, 40% have gone to African immigrants. 45's framework attacks immigrants by eliminating the #DVL. He's on the record as preferring Nordic immigrants to African immigrants. This cannot be ignored.
45's use of the term "chain migration" rather than 'family reunification' is a divisive and harmful dog whistle for the Alt-Right.	 	There are over 4.4 million families stuck in limbo, waiting for their government to act. This is why I co-sponsored the #ReunitingFamiliesAct.

#ICYMI The #USCIS will now prioritize new asylum-seeking applicants ahead of the 311,000 applicants already caught in our backlogged system. This is another harmful Trump immigration policy that puts thousands of people at risk of deportation back to life-threatening conditions.

Worst of all, it would also curtail family reunification and it fails to provide a plan forward for TPS and DED-eligible individuals. #SOTU
The framework also cruelly attacks black and African immigrants by eliminating the Diversity Visa Lottery program which serves as one of the main sources of immigration from Africa.
Donald Trump‚Äôs immigration framework is discriminatory, anti-immigrant, and holds #DREAMers hostage to his extremist vision of border security.

I stand with the overwhelming majority of Americans in opposing 45's attacks on our history, indigenous groups, favorite outdoor pastimes, and cultural and natural treasures.
45's decision stands as the largest elimination of protected areas in U.S. history and it will put Native Americans, natural resources, archaeological treasures, and key wildlife habitat at risk to benefit corporations and the fossil fuel industry.
45 backpedaled on the long-term effort to conserve the environment for the betterment of future generations when he introduced his plan to remove protections for over 2M acres of public lands. I am beyond appalled, and the American people should be too. https://t.co/x5rDUJYReM

Communities of color shouldn't be twice victimized by negligent medical care, selfish leaders and irrational laws.
Fannie Lou Hamer was given a hysterectomy w/o consent in the state of Mississippi's attempt to reduce its population of Black children. https://t.co/SOKwAXqTIr
On what would've been her 100th birthday, I salute Fannie Lou Hamer for being an agent of change for the advancement of Black people &amp; WOC.
The livelihood of women, especially the health &amp; reproductive rights of women of color &amp; the poor must be at the forefront of our concerns.
This directly attacks women's health &amp; will leave women of color &amp; low income communities at an immense disadvantage. 45 is appalling. https://t.co/7enPk2jugK

Threatening the lives of POC, and seeing swatiskas &amp; white nationalist symbols in 2017 on American soil isn't what makes this country great.
To 45: is this what you intended when you told the world that you wanted to make America great again?
They were white supremacists and Neo-Nazis, and many of them spewed hate in the name of the 45th President of the United States.
45, there were NOT any "good people" amongst the crowd of hateful participants in the #Charlottesville rally.
We must learn from history. We did not forget the harmful impact of evil and white nationalism, and we must not forget now.
The Holocaust taught us to #NeverForget after 11 mil innocent lives were lost for the sake of pure evil.
