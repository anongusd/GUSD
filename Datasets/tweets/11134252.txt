One thing remains crystal clear after today’s Democrat political charade: Michael Cohen is a liar.	 	When asked about the testimony, Dianne Feinstein - the TOP DEMOCRAT on the Senate Judiciary Committee - said Cohen clearly “has a credibility problem.”

The invitation by Democrats for Michael Cohen to appear before Congress was nothing more than an attempt to distract from the monumental achievements of President @realDonaldTrump’s administration and his historic Vietnam summit.
Today’s hearing proves Cohen is using his publicity for his own personal ambitions:	—Refused to say that he would not pursue a book, movie, or TV deal	—Declined that he wouldn’t provide comments to news networks	—Wouldn’t commit that he would not pursue political office

Don't forget: disgraced felon Michael Cohen has a documented history of lying to Congress.	 	According to the Special Counsel’s Office, Cohen made a “deliberate effort to use his lies to set the tone and shape the course of his talks” with Congress.
This week, Michael Cohen is testifying before multiple Congressional Committees.  	 	It’s obvious that Democrats have scheduled these hearings as a way to distract Americans from the historic progress President Trump is making with North Korea.	https://t.co/7lJnY9gZ6h
Progress towards denuclearization is because of President @realDonaldTrump’s maximum pressure campaign on North Korea aimed at halting North Korea’s illicit missile &amp; nuclear activity. 	 	The Trump Administration has sanctioned AT LEAST 229 individuals, entities or vessels.
Since President @realDonaldTrump's 1st summit w/ Chairman Kim, relations between the two countries have improved.	- North Korea hasn't launched a missile in 457 days	- North Korea hasn't conducted a nuclear test in 543 days	- North Korea destroyed a major missile engine test
Ahead of today's summit, @realDonaldTrump's leadership has led to real progress towards a denuclearized peninsula: 	-4 Americans detained in North Korea were released	-Remains of 55 American servicemen were returned home
During President Obama’s last year in office, North Korea launched a missile EVERY 24 DAYS.	 	Now, it’s been 457 days without a missile launch from North Korea.	 	@realDonaldTrump has made great progress easing tensions and working towards the denuclearization of the peninsula.

Yesterday’s Quinnipiac poll ➡️ 53% of American voters approve of the President’s work on the economy, his highest grade ever.
.@RepAndyBiggsAZ: The campaign for the 2020 elections starts now, with the leadership team we put in place. I urge my colleagues to recognize that our leaders will reflect whether we are going to fight for our values of faith, family and freedom.	https://t.co/pFroMqnKNs
🚨JOBS, JOBS, JOBS🚨	 	A quarter million jobs were created in October and unemployment continues at a near-50 year low of 3.7 percent.
"Unemployment has hit its lowest level in nearly 50 years. For the first time ever on record, our nation has more job openings than job seekers. Worker wages recently logged their fastest year-on-year growth since the Great Recession." -@senatemajldr
Mike Espy went on Ivory Coast state-run television to be the “English-speaking mouthpiece” for the dictator saying he was “not going to abdicate” – for a dictator now standing trial for war crimes. Mississippians can reject this type of radical record on Tuesday, Nov. 27. #MSSen
Mike Espy was paid $750,000 – and lied about it – from a foreign dictator who is now on trial for crimes including torture, rape and murder. That’s who Espy represented. Do Mississippians really want him representing them in the U.S. Senate? #MSSen
Mike Espy had 39 felony charges, resulting in the convictions of 14 individuals, and more than $10 million in fines from his time under President Clinton. Mississippi does not need a Senator who’s in this to enrich himself at the expense of the taxpayers. #MSSen
Mike Espy claims that he’ll be an “independent Senator for the state of Mississippi”, but just this past September he said “I’m going to caucus with Chuck Schumer.” That means he’d be a vote to block President Trump’s judges, roll back the tax cuts and endless obstruction. #MSSen
Mike Espy’s loyalty is to the Democrat Party, not to Mississippians.  He can’t fool voters with his "independent voice" campaign rhetoric. Let’s send @cindyhydesmith back to Washington where she will actually vote for Mississippi values. #MSSen
