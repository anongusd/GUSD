Senate approves hate crimes law without specific categories of victims: https://t.co/2S6gttFr4A #INLegis
Senate passes the hate crimes bill 39-10, with @RonAlting being the only Republican to vote against it, joining all nine Democrats. #INLegis
Sen. Aaron Freeman, who authored the amendment, says he did so to keep the issue alive. Suggests that it would have died otherwise.
Even though he won't support the bill in its current form, @RonAlting thanks senators for keeping the issue alive.
Alting: "I personally believe, and it's just my belief, that I like the list... But you know what? Democracy spoke. I lost. I didn't get the votes.‚Äù
.@RonAlting, also an author of the bill, is speaking now. He says he will vote against the bill because the list was important to him.
Young is also the first senator to speak in favor of the bill today.
Young says Utah and Georgia had criminal laws, and those have to be specific. Indiana is considering a sentencing law. "The standard is different."
Sen. Mike Young talking about the differences between Indiana's proposed law and the Georgia and Utah laws that have been struck down. Supporters of having the list have cited those cases as proof Indiana's would end up in court.
Taylor to Bohacek: "I can't imagine being in that room. You did a brave thing and you continue to do that.‚Äù
.@Sen_GregTaylor is speaking now. He also had an emotional speech on Tuesday. He made author Sen. Bohacek come up to the front of the room and says he respects him for his work on this. Bohacek voted against the amendment on Tuesday.
.@SenatorRandolph is speaking now. He gave an emotional testimony on Tuesday before the amendment was voted on.
.@SenJeanBreaux spoke before Ford. She said the vote on Tuesday was personal to her and started to tear up during her remarks.
.@SenatorJDFord, the state's first openly gay senator, says Indiana still looks like a backward state with the amended version of the bill. Says he won't vote for it. "This is not a hate crimes law."
Sen. @Jim_Merritt, who is running for mayor of Indianapolis, spoke on the bill. He voted against the amendment that gutted it on Tuesday, but did not speak on the floor that day. "We must leave no doubt that Indiana welcomes all.‚Äù #INLegis

The amendment passes 33-16 with a few Republicans joining Democrats.
Senate doing a roll call vote on the amendment. It has enough votes to pass.
Democrats are back too. Should find out what the fate of this amendment is soon.
Republicans are returning to the Senate floor.
Update: Senate Democrats and Republicans are both still in caucus. Will be interesting to see what happens when they return.
Both parties are in caucus now.
Senate President Pro Tem @bray_rodric moved to delay the vote on the bill for 30 minutes. Seems like there's debate over whether they will do a roll call vote. @TimLanane requested a roll call.
Other than @RonAlting asking a couple questions (and obviously Freeman), no other Republican spoke on the amendment.
Randolph: "What do we have to do to earn your respected recognition?"
The testimony from Democrats has been very emotional. @SenatorRandolph speaking now. Accusing Republicans of not recognizing him and that he got elected like they did.
RT @WIBC_EricBerman: Sen. Lonnie Randolph (D-East Chicago) more emotional than I‚Äôve ever seen him on the floor: ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you support this‚Ä¶

.@SenatorJDFord says yesterday he supported the bill; now he's not so sure.
.@RonAlting, one of the authors of the bill, asks Freeman to clarify whether religion, sexual orientation and gender identity are removed from the bill. Freeman confirms all three are removed with his amendment.
Senate Minority Leader Tim Lanane says he doesn't think the amendment is well written because it's not giving clear instruction to judges. Just tells them to consider bias, but doesn't explain what they mean by bias.
RT @marybschneider: After that emotional speech by Taylor, Senate Minority Leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson, now up. He notes that Freeman ame‚Ä¶

Taylor asks if Freeman thinks the sentence should be aggravated for someone who attacks someone for being an IU fan the same way it could be aggravated for someone who attacks someone for being in a same-sex relationship. Freeman says the law should apply equally to all.
The amendment is authored by Republican Sen. Aaron Freeman from Indy. This is the amendment: https://t.co/rDy6sRrkYK		Democratic Sen. Greg Taylor is grilling Freeman on why he removed the list, specifically why he removed race from the bill.

Noblesville Deputy Mayor @CookeCom says they are not interested in just checking a box to get the state off of the list of 5 without hate crimes legislation. He says it needs to include a list.
A group students from Goshen College spoke about various specific categories in the bill - race, sexual orientation, religion.
We've heard from several mayors in support of it and now hearing from multiple higher education institutions.
Representatives from Anthem and Cummins have testified in support of the bill. @ScottFadness is speaking now in favor of it.

Ann Murtlow, from @uwci, speaking in support of the bill. Says 2019 needs to be the year that Indiana passes a comprehensive hate crimes law.
This bill would allow judges to consider whether the crime was a hate crime committed against someone who falls into one of the categories included in the bill when determining that sentence length.
Indiana law does give judges some leeway when determining sentences. For example, if a crime allowed a sentence of 5-10 years, the judge can decide whether the person receives the low end or high end of that, but has to justify it.
Ryan McCann, from Indiana Family Action, says Indiana already has a law that "really should be the envy of the nation" because it protects everyone. This is what many of those opposed to the bill have said.
RT @nkellyatJG: Several people testifying say the bill is unconstitutional. 		The U.S. Supreme Court upheld bias crime laws in 1993.
Parvonay Stover, legislative affairs director for the Indiana Attorney General's office, says they are against the bill because it doesn't give judges any more power than they already have today. Says the bill has no teeth and wouldn't help victims.

Conservative Jim Bopp says current law already gives protections to everyone‚Äîthis bill would limit protections to only certain people. Curt Smith, from Indiana Family Institute, also speaks against the bill. Similar reasoning.
Committee amended the bill to get rid of political affiliation, status as a public safety official or relative of a public safety official and service in the military; adds age as specific characteristics.

Sandlin talked a lot about a TIF district that the city would have to create, but the bill also would allow a Professional Sports Development Area to be created and capture tax revenue.

Several individuals from the horse racing industry all testify in support of the bill.
Dan Emerson, chief legal officer for the Colts, says you'd be surprised how often different data sources can vary. That's why official league data is so important. He said it would be "a prescription for disaster" if multiple data sources were allowed to be used.
But Bell says they don't support being restricted to only using official league data, because that creates a monopoly and leagues could then control who can offer sports betting and who can't.
No surprise here‚ÄîMatt Bell from the Casino Association of Indiana says the casinos do not have consensus on the overall bill. But they do support sports wagering.
Mark Miles, CEO of Hulman Motorsports parent Hulman &amp; Co., is speaking in support of the sports betting part of the bill.
Mayor of East Chicago talks about concerns about gaming revenue decreasing. But Messmer says they are adding a clause in the bill that will help those communities if revenue goes down.
So far everyone who has testified against it has either been from Hammond or East Chicago or involved in one of the casinos there.
.@SenatorRandolph asks him if he'd rather Gary just go down, because then those residents would move somewhere, possibly to Hammond. Officer suggests they are tired of bailing out Gary.
A police officer from Hammond is the first to testify against the bill. He talks about how no one wants to go to Gary; no one wants to re-locate their business there. Relocating the casino could cause more work for them in Hammond.
Sen. Ford briefly talks about the sports betting section.
Messmer says they are keeping in mind the impact a casino relocation could have on other communities and will continue to work on that.
Messmer hits the highlights‚Äîwould allow a casino to relocate to Terre Haute and would allow all casinos to compete for that opportunity, not just the Gary licenses; removes limitation on number of casino licenses one entity can control
Messmer is now talking about the entire bill. Calls it a "once in a generation" opportunity to update the state's gambling laws.
Messmer has another amendment that eliminates the sports betting language in the bill and instead inserts the sports betting language from Sen. Ford's separate bill. Messmer said he likes Ford's language better.
Sen. Messmer, author of the bill, supports the amendment. The bill is amended.

Onward and upward. The speech has concluded. #INSOTS
RT @nkellyatJG: Definitely more standing ovations this year than in past years. Overall clapping seems similar.
This speech included the words Big Mac and cow manure. But it did not include basketball.
Nearing the end of the speech for those of you who have had enough politics for one night.
He got a standing for ovation for that too, but there were some GOP lawmakers who did not stand (or really clap).
Holcomb reiterates his position on hate crimes legislation‚Äî"it's time for us to move off that list" of five states without it.
Holcomb mentions another agenda item‚Äîreducing infant mortality.
"It‚Äôs still early, but the investment we‚Äôve made to increase caseworker salaries and improve the workforce culture is making a difference."
Holcomb says he's proud of the progress they've made with DCS.
"We will keep working 24-7-365 to get more of our Hoosier neighbors on the road to their recovery."
Holcomb says the state has better data, but still has a long way to go.
Another ongoing priority for Holcomb‚Äîaddressing the opioid epidemic.
Holcomb mentions a workforce training program for inmates that has already graduated 1,000 students.
@PeteSeat I do not know what you‚Äôre talking about.
Holcomb is also creating a Next Level Teacher Pay Commission to continue studying the issue/solving the problem.
.@GovHolcomb says schools should use 100 percent of that money to increase teacher salaries. Gets another stand ovation.
The state will use surplus funds to pay off a teacher pension liability. That will free up $140M for schools over next two years.
Here's what @GovHolcomb is announcing on teacher pay tonight: https://t.co/frVYIhSjgT #INSOTS
Here comes the teacher pay news. #INSOTS
"A strong economy depends on a world-class workforce. That workforce depends on a great education."
We're on workforce development now.
"Nothing against large coffees and Big Macs. I‚Äôm a fan of both. But all students should be doing their homework at home."
Holcomb talking about the need to expand broadband. Says he's heard from people who tell him kids go to Starbucks and McDonald's for internet access.
He said "next level" again. For those who want the count, he should say it nine times.
First guests being introduced‚ÄîCommander Colin Kane of the Indianapolis and Commander David Grogan of the Indiana
Holcomb mentions one of his agenda items -- exempting military pensions from income taxes. Gets a standing ovation.
"We cannot just maintain our course. Instead, we must throttle up." #INSOTS
He says they can't stop now. #INSOTS
He gets big applause as he talks about how Indiana has turned its economy around over the years.
Holcomb says that "take Indiana to the Next Level" isn't just a slogan or a bumper sticker to him. "It's an action-oriented aspiration..." #INSOTS

Updated story: @GovHolcomb's budget includes increases for DCS and K-12 education and maintains a surplus. https://t.co/wtbdRVmOK6
The increase in funding for K-12 isn't *specifically* for teacher pay, but OMB director Micah Vincent says they hope and expect some of that new money does go to teachers.
Gov. Holcomb's budget includes increases for DCS, K-12 education: https://t.co/ePAMOzGOWl
So, the proposed budget covers these increases and still has a surplus. The math error means there's actually more than $1B in new money over the two-year budget.
Top budget-writing GOP lawmakers previously said the state would barely have enough new money to cover increased costs at DCS, K-12 and Medicaid, but those estimates did not include the new revenue from the previous forecast in Dec. 2017.
Here's a quick look at how the governor plans to spend money the next two years. https://t.co/nnX95IHFlq
The budget includes the $286M per year that the Department of Child Services had requested, plus increases in Medicaid and 2 percent increase each year in K-12 funding.
Governor‚Äôs office is presenting its budget this morning. Goal is to keep AAA credit rating and 11 percent in reserves.

@hollyvhays It is Nov. 20. Why is this press conference outside?
Senate has been honoring people in the chamber. New Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has not spoken.
Talking to reporters after House adjourned, Bosma said we can expect an announcement from @GovHolcomb regarding workforce development soon. Bosma wouldn‚Äôt elaborate on potential workforce development plans for the session other than to say that.

Bosma says they will "work on some real solutions this time‚Äù on workforce development.
Bosma says they expect $325M-$350M in new revenue for upcoming budget, but $275M of that needs to go to DCS.
On to the challenges: locating skilled employees that can pass drug test, increasing teacher pay, improving school safety.

I'm back in the newsroom now, where we're wrapping up coverage.
After Ford spoke, that was the end of the speeches for the Democrats.
"And it's my birthday!" Ford shouts as the crowd sings "Happy Birthday" to him as he walks off stage.
Ford pledges to work for the public good and be a voice for his district.
Ford thanks his campaign manager. "This is your victory tonight."
Ford thanks his volunteers.
Ford talks about all the doors he knocked on and people he talked to during the campaign.
Ford says the race hasn't been easy, but it's been a lot of fun.
Ford is Indiana's first openly gay state lawmaker. "Ladies and gentlemen, we just made history and no one can take that from us."
Ford: "Now you have a voice in the Indiana General Assembly."
Ford: "I wanted district 29 to be heard and with our win tonight, they will be."
Ford: let me start by saying thank you.
Crowd excited to hear from Ford. Really the one big win they have tonight.
Zody on stage now, introducing J.D. Ford.
I've been told J.D. Ford is expected to take the stage soon.
Forestal thanking a list of people.
Lots of Forestal supporters here. @kerry_forestal is on stage now.
Curry says he's made his resolution for the new year -- devote all his energy to make sure Trump is no longer president after 2020. "I swear to God, I don't know how Mike Pence looks in the mirror every day."
Curry talks about how great the extra opportunity for early voting was this year.
Curry won re-election tonight.
Prosecutor Terry Curry addressing the crowd.
Looks like their families are joining them too. So it's a packed stage. Sheriff candidate Kerry Forestal is on stage.
Candidates in Marion County taking the stage now.
Whitticker thanks her volunteers and supporters.
Whitticker says Democrats have an opportunity to move to the next level. (Odd phrasing, since "next level" is Gov. Holcomb's slogan.)
State auditor candidate Joselyn Whitticker addresses the crowd. "Hello, family."
Aguilera: "This has been the opportunity of a lifetime."
Aguilera: "We gave it all. We worked as hard as we could."
Aguilera: Latino voters need to stand up and say they deserve to be treated with respect.
Aguilera: "I know this is a great state."		"We are not done."
State treasurer candidate John Aguilera on the stage now. He lost to Republican @VoteTeraKlutz.
Harper: "There is far too much on the line for us to give up now."
.@JimHarperIN says the party has to persevere. Reminds them that the party had a record number of candidates this year. "We should be proud that we gave Hoosiers a choice where they did not have a choice before."
Jim Harper is on stage now. He lost his Secretary of State race to Connie Lawson. He says he just called her to wish her well.
One bright spot for Democrats tonight may be the Ford v. Delph race. Ford is still up 57-43 with 64 percent reporting.
Dee Thornton, who ran in the 5th congressional district against Susan Brooks also encourages people to look toward 2020. Seems to be the theme tonight. They lost tonight, but there's always 2020.
Donnelly says he‚Äôll do whatever he can to help people still. Only spoke for two minutes.
Donnelly says he‚Äôs the luckiest guy in the world. Best family, campaign manager, etc.
He says he called Mike Braun. Said he wants there to be a smooth transition.
Joe Donnelly is on stage now.
‚ÄúI want you to be encouraged. I want you to feel empowered,‚Äù Carson says. And asks the crowd if they‚Äôre ready for 2020.
Carson says you‚Äôll see Donnelly again. And tells the room not to give up. ‚ÄúWe have more fights to win.‚Äù
Carson gives a shout out to @JoeforIndiana. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fought for Hoosier families.‚Äù
Carson says being in public service is a huge task.
Carson is on stage now.
Andre Carson supporters take the stage. I‚Äôm assuming we will hear from him soon. He won his race.

According to @hayleighcolombo's reporting, @JoeforIndiana has a small lead in Hamilton County. That's a big deal. Democrats were hoping to swing the suburbs more in their favor this year. HamCo is historically a strong area for GOP.

.@nytimes shows @JD4IN29 up over @MikeDelph with 26 percent reporting. This is a state-level race to watch tonight.
Democratic congressional candidate for the 4th district Tobi Beck is here. CNN shows Republican Jim Baird as the projected winner right now, with 46 percent reporting.
.@Andre4Congress has also been declared the winner in his race.
.@NBCNews has called the 2nd congressional district race for Republican @jackiewalorski. This had been one of the races to watch in Indiana as a possible seat that could flip. https://t.co/LvKxjQC1t7
Zody tells people to get a drink and some chips. ‚ÄúLet's prepare for a long night, possibly.‚Äù
Zody thanks the people in the room for the work they did this election season. Says there are still people voting in some parts of the state because of the long lines when polls closed.
John Zody just took the stage.
I‚Äôve been told Indiana Senate candidates Derek Camp and J.D. Ford are here, although I have not personally seen them yet.
Cheers from the room as MSNBC talks about ‚Å¶‚Å¶@JoeforIndiana‚Å© doing well in southern Indiana. And cheers from results in Virginia and Florida. https://t.co/5PRu4HM4Sz
With 10 percent of precincts reporting, @braun4indiana has 58 percent. @JoeforIndiana has 38 percent. But this still doesn't include anything from northwest Indiana, where Donnelly is expected to do well.
The room has definitely become more crowded.
Gabrielle McLemore, communications director for the Indiana Senate Democrats, is also here. McLemore is one of the women who accused AG Curtis Hill of inappropriately touching her at the post-legislative session party earlier this year.
State auditor candidate Joselyn Whitticker is here, talking to supporter Mary Rowley.
With 6 percent reporting, @braun4indiana has 57.7 percent and @JoeforIndiana has 38.4 percent, according to @nytimes.
John Zody gets ready for a TV interview at ‚Å¶@INDems‚Å© party. https://t.co/r7OAtjJXhm

@Jim_SullivanIN It was before 5 p.m., so definitely before it was completely filled.
Speech is over. He ends it on his usual statement - together we will make America great again.
‚ÄúNot too many. I don‚Äôt see any," Trump says.
Trump asks if anyone is going to vote for Donnelly. The crowd boos.
Trump tells the crowd they need to vote for a Republican House and Senate so they can continue this great political movement.
Talks about getting rid of the individual mandate. "So many people have thanked me."
Health care has been the biggest issue in the #INSen race, and Trump is just now focusing on it.
Now we're on women. Trump talking about how great he did with women, and he'll do well with them again.
@nkellyatJG I am too, but I'm still here.
Trump is back on stage and talking about immigration again. Says Democrats want to allow all the illegal immigrants into the country so they can get more votes.
Interestingly, there is a small stream of people leaving already.
Braun says Donnelly calls himself the hired help, but he's not effective, so it's more like the tired help. And Indiana should make him the fired help.
Braun says he never thought he'd share a stage with president, VP and Bob Knight.
No surprise here - @braun4indiana wearing a blue button down shirt.
.@braun4indiana introduced to come on stage.
Just kidding. I'm watching CBS-4 live stream and that showed the crowed.
Trump asks the media to turn their cameras and show the crowd. I don't think any of the TV cameras moved.
Trump bashes Donnelly for not being an effective senator. "That's why they call him sleeping‚Äô Joe... just get out and vote.‚Äù
A different tone from his earlier rally in W.V. when Trump said Democrats could take back the House... now he says election day will be "interesting." And then asks how great 2016 was.
Trump says @GovHolcomb and @ToddRokita have both done a great job.
That's it. Knight has walked off the stage. He left his paper and pen at the podium. Trump says he's going to keep it, because he can sell it for a lot of money.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been a great defender of the United States of America,‚Äù Knight says about Trump.
Knight says Harry Truman was a great president. Gets crowd to chant "Go get 'em, Donald."
He is wearing the classic red sweater.
Knight coming on stage now to address the crowd.
"I like Larry Bird. I don't know if he likes me, but I don‚Äôt really care,‚Äù Trump says.
Trump just called IU "the University of Indiana." That is not correct.
"I just lifted it up and there it was," Trump says about picking up some paper and finding the number.
Once he was running for president, he had to search through thousands of pages to find Knight's number. (Spoiler alert: he found it.)
This call was before Trump had officially decided to run for president.
Trump is introducing Bob Knight. Telling the story about how he got a call from Knight. (He's told this story before at rallies.)
‚ÄúBetween Justice Kavanaugh and the caravans, you people are energized,‚Äù Trump says to applause.
On to immigration. Trump says Democrats want totally open borders. Crowd doesn't like that.
‚ÄúAmerica is winning like never before because we are finally putting America first," Trump says. Crowd helps him finish the statement.
Trump continues to talk about the economy and jobs, talks about creating jobs in the steel industry.
Trump says Bob Knight will speak tonight.
Trump brings up the jobs report from earlier today‚Äî250K jobs were added in October.
U-S-A chant from the crowd.
Trump shaking hands with supporters before coming to the podium.
Crowd is roaring.
Pence introducing Trump now.
Pence says the same lines from the TV ad where he talks to the camera about Joe Donnelly. Crowd chants "Joe's gotta go!"
Crowd chants "Build the wall" when Pence brings it up.
Pence brings up the jobs report that was released this morning. Jobs are back.	America is back, and we‚Äôre just getting started Indiana.‚Äù
Internet doesn't seem like it's going to work. Live tweeting may not happen.
Pence says it's great to be back near where he &amp; Karen raised their kids.
Mike Pence just got introduced. Seems like we've got everyone in the right gym now.

@adamwren Just because it wasn't asked about doesn't mean it wasn't noticed. I know I caught the comment, and so did some others in the room.
So, was there a Mourdock moment? What was your take away?
And that's it, folks.
Brenton says she would reduce size of government.
Braun talks about health care and hits his big talking point tonight - that he's done it in the real world.
Final question - top priority? Donnelly says ending opioid crisis.
Brenton tells everyone to get their bingo cards ready. It's hemp talk time.
Braun says we need clean air and water. He's pressed for a more specific answer - says we need to be more energy independent.
Donnelly says he works with utilities to reduce carbon footprint which can reduce greenhouse gases which can reduce the global temperature.
I love it when voters get sassy. They weren't happy with answers from last debate on climate change, so the question is back.
Braun talks about being a job creator and diversifying staff.
Donnelly talks about having an Indian American and African American on staff - but they do an amazing job.
How would they diversify their staffs, if elected? Brenton says she doesn't see color.
Donnelly: "We need to fully enforce the law at every single turn.‚Äù
Brenton says she had her own #metoo experience and that society needs to remove the stigma.
On sexual assault: "There is no place for that period in our society," Braun says.
Donnelly says he can't believe Braun thinks fed govn't doesn't need to be involved. Talks about kids who show up to school hungry and how they need to be fed.
Braun says we shouldn't rely on federal government. Too dysfunctional to solve hunger issues.
What will they do to alleviate hunger in Indiana? Donnelly says he's helping write the farm bill.
Donnelly really seems to be trying to pull at heartstrings tonight. Keeps referencing mothers, daughters, sons, etc.
Pretty much in any answer we get back to it. Will be interesting to see how they pivot now that we‚Äôre on foreign policy. https://t.co/lqb8mBwR2W
Donnelly brings up the tax cuts. "We cant have tax cuts that only help the wealthiest."
Brenton: "They talk about this but as soon as they get elected, it doesn't matter if they‚Äôre wearing a red shirt or blue shirt, they still vote to raise your taxes.‚Äù
Reduce spending or find ways to increase revenue? Braun says we need to live within our means - cut from government agencies.
Brenton reminds everyone that she has 10 children.... maybe some days when those kids don't do the dishes she wishes that contraceptive was retroactive. "Of course contraceptives should be affordable.‚Äù
And Braun pivots to talking about being pro-life.
Braun: "When it comes to contraceptive coverage, I think everybody is on board with that.‚Äù
What's their position on low-cost or free contraceptives? Donnelly says it's included in Affordable Care Act, which he supports. But then reminds viewers that he is pro-life.
Moderator Amna Nawaz doing a good job at reminding candidates what the question was.
Donnelly brings up the lawsuit that would get rid of pre-existing condition coverage, uses an example with an IPS kid on a school bus with asthma. Braun says he's the only one up there who understands health care.
How will they keep health care costs down? Brenton says get government out of it.
Second question - would they support legislation that gets rid of birthright legislation? Donnelly and Braun say they'd have to review the legislation. Brenton says she wants to know if it's going to be good for country or will it violate constitution?
First Q: Why don't candidates answer the questions? Will you tonight? They all say yes. (I'm skeptical).
.@lucy4senate reminds everyone that Election Day is a week away (yay!) and says your individual rights are at stake.
.@braun4indiana went negative too, saying Donnelly takes orders from the party leadership. ‚ÄúJust like I take care of my employees, I'll take care of Hoosiers.‚Äù
"Mike‚Äôs after your health care and your social security and your medicare. That's what this election is about," @JoeforIndiana says.

@HoosierJonFord You're welcome. Thanks for following.
FFA convention back to their usual business. My full story on Trump's speech will be posted soon.
Standing ovation as he walks off the stage.
Huge roar for him as he ends his speech.
He tells the crowd you've heard my phrase "Make America Great Again" and you will help us do that.
‚ÄúThe greatest and most important days for the American farmers are yet to come, and you‚Äôre going to take us there,‚Äù Trump says.
"They jumped out of those seats so fast," Trump says.
A few FFA members are being called to come up on stage and shake his hand.
"You have no idea how important the farm and the farmers are,‚Äù Trump says. "People tend to take things for granted‚Äîyou‚Äôre truly great and important people.‚Äù
Trump says he will probably never get the Nobel Peace Prize, despite all the work he is doing. "You know why? Because they don't want to," Trump says.
One person taking "just one" step, one opportunity, etc. can change the world forever, Trump says.
Trump uses the FFA slogan "Just one" and gets a big round of applause.
Probably not surprising, but the crowd has been very pro-Trump. He brings up Elizabeth Warren and says it turns out he's more Native American than she is, and the crowd cheers and laughs.
He brings up the changes to the estate tax. Makes it sound like it was eliminated, but the tax bill did not eliminate it. The exemption was doubled.
Trump continues talking about trade deals with various countries - China, Japan, etc. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a trade dispute. But you know, what, we‚Äôre going to win‚Äù ‚Äúbecause we always win.‚Äù
Banks is running against @CourtneyTritch, who has out-raised Banks the past two quarters.
Hollingsworth is in one of the few potentially competitive U.S. House races in Indiana. Bernie Sanders was recently in Indiana to campaign for his opponent @LizForIndiana.
Trump pulls Rep. Trey Hollingsworth and Rep. Jim Banks on stage. Tells people to vote for them.
Trump talks about "a cotton farmer who works his ass off his whole life‚Äù who the federal govn't needed to help. Says we spend "billions of dollars" helping other countries that don't respect us, but we don't help farmers.
"He loves his farmers... and he‚Äôs done some great job,‚Äù Trump says about @SecretarySonny.
Trump talks about when he interviewed Sonny Perdue for the role of ag secretary. Says the others he interviewed didn't know anything about farming.
Back to talking about trade deals... ‚ÄúYou have very unfair trade deals, folks.‚Äù
"In the meantime, it's my honor to be with you right now.‚Äù
Trump had been considering canceling his rally in Illinois tonight. But he says he is still going. "We can‚Äôt let evil change our life and change our schedule. We can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù
"Great people. Not a lot of notice," Trump says. He arranged this from Air Force One on his way to Indy.
The three men hug on stage.
Listening to the prayers. https://t.co/eZ2RTxzKS0
Now Trump has invited a rabbi and a pastor to the stage to say prayers.
Trump:"If I can fly on air force one, then you can be a very, very successful farmer.‚Äù
Trump tells the crowd they are going to be so successful, "especially after I open up all those countries to you with our great trade deals.‚Äù
Trump: "We mourn for the unthinkable loss of life that happened today.‚Äù
Trump: "There must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism anywhere in America.‚Äù
Quickly addresses the Pittsburgh shooting. This "wicked act of mass murder is pure evil, hard to believe, and frankly something that is unimaginable.‚Äù
Trump: "When I hear the word future farmer, that's a very, very important term.‚Äù
Trump is at the podium now.
"God Bless the USA" is playing. Trump is shaking hands of FFA members on stage.
"God Bless the USA" is playing. Trump is shaking hands with FFA members on stage.
Crowd is roaring.
Trump is walking onto stage now.
He says Trump understands the American dream, understands agriculture and understands the work ethic of farmers.

It will be a 35 percent increase, as of Oct. 1.
All of these projects will be funded by an increase to toll road fees for heavy vehicles- class 3 and above - so large trucks, like dump trucks or trucks pulling trailers, and bigger.
And $20 million will fund efforts to attract more direct international flights to Indy. Paris flight started earlier this year.
Another $190M will go toward projects on U.S. 20, 30 and 31.
Biggest portion of the $1 billion will be $600 million to accelerate the last leg of I-69 from Martinsville to Indy. Section 6 is expected to be done by 2024 now rather than 2027. (Section 5 is supposed to be done in days.)
Both grant programs are in the early stages. @GovHolcomb says they will meet with stakeholders this month.
$90 million will go toward a grant program to expand biking and hiking trails. @GovHolcomb says he wants everyone to live within 5 miles of a trail.
$100 million dollars will go toward grant program to expand broadband to rural areas.

Part of @AGCurtisHill's statement: "The allegations against me are vicious and false. At no time did I ever grab or touch anyone inappropriately. The lack of fairness and the failure to recognize my constitutional rights are a complete travesty."
In his statement, Hill requests an investigation from @MCProsecutors. He says an investigation by the Inspector General would not be fair, because the position is appointed by @GovHolcomb, who has already called for Hill's resignation.

More from the statement: "We do not believe that Curtis Hill, as chief law enforcement officer of the State of Indiana, can continue to perform his duties, nor should he, and we call for his immediate resignation."

OK. Romeo Langford picked IU. Now, let‚Äôs all pay attention to the #INSen debate.
.@LukeMesserIN and @ToddRokitaIN both attacking @braun4indiana for his past voting record (pulling Democratic ballots in primaries.) #INSen
.@braun4indiana says he can fix the budget problems at the national level because he's managed his businesses for years. #INSen
.@ToddRokitaIN says we need to cut spending. It's not a revenue problem. It's a spending problem. #INSen
Next question is on national debt and how to stop the projected future increases to it. @LukeMesserIN says he doesn't agree with CBO estimates and that Trump is taking the right steps. #INSen
.@ToddRokitaIN says the first person you should question is the person who says "I am who I say I am" aka @LukeMesserIN. And says he is the only one who can beat @JoeforIndiana. #INSen

The question was actually on how the candidates disagree with Trump. @AttyAbdul trying to get them to answer it in the rebuttals. None of the three had a specific example. #INSen
.@braun4indiana hitting the "career politician" strategy hard tonight. Keeps repeating it in his answers. #INSen
The attacks and interruptions have started. #INSen
.@braun4indiana doesn‚Äôt directly answer the question. Instead talks about how he‚Äôd be different than @LukeMesserIN and @ToddRokitaIN and because he‚Äôs different, he could get things done, like health care. #INSen
.@ToddRokitaIN lists more than three‚Ä¶term limits, lobbying bans, end illegal immigration, end sanctuary cities, get English as official language. #INSen
What are the top three priorities for you during first six months in office? @LukeMesserIN says it‚Äôs increasing paychecks for Hoosiers, strengthening military and securing borders and reforming the Senate. #INSen
Well, it didn‚Äôt take long for the ‚Äú85 percent‚Äù stat to get mentioned. @LukeMesserIN references it in opening statement. Here‚Äôs my fact check on it: https://t.co/O0MvzeXkto #INSen
Also, no campaign is supposed to tweet out a victory before the event is over. But I bet they all still win‚Ä¶ even if they have to wait a few minutes to declare it. #INSen
Moderator @AttyAbdul says the debate will NOT touch on issues the candidates clearly agree on: building a wall, arming teachers, gun rights, etc. #INSen

And then you‚Äôll make her watch the #INSen debate, right?? https://t.co/ZfjD5fYIQM

And that‚Äôs it folks. We really stuck to the timeline. And that‚Äôs great for everyone sweating in this room. #INSenDebate
Braun: ‚ÄúWe had a robust discussion here.‚Äù Says we need less career politicians in D.C., so he‚Äôs the best candidate. #INSenDebate
Rokita also focuses on who is the best to beat Donnelly in his closing statement. ‚ÄúWho do you trust to beat Joe Donnelly?‚Äù #INSenDebate
Messer closing statement: focused on Donnelly. #INSenDebate
Braun says there are hundreds of jobs available, and it‚Äôs frustrating industry leaders. Says it‚Äôs an important issue. #INSenDebate
Rokita says businesses should work with schools. Messer says this is why welfare reform is so important - every able body should work. #INSenDebate
Last question is about workforce development. Rokita is up first. #INSenDebate
Terrorists? Tariffs? Same thing. https://t.co/IQS1Ktd3Xu
On Medicaid, Medicare: Rokita says we need to strengthen these programs so they are around for years to come. Messer says they need to look at possibly increasing the age. Braun accuses both of not doing anything about this problem for years.
Braun says in DC you need to have a backbone and can‚Äôt just go along with everything. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do what‚Äôs right.‚Äù #INSenDebate
The federal spending bill increases the deficit, so how are the candidates different from Democrats? Messer again says they were asked by the president. And says political divide in Congress makes it difficult to function.
Rokita also says ‚Äúof course‚Äù he wouldn‚Äôt support an increase in gas tax. #INSenDebate
Would Messer support raising the federal gas tax? He would not. #INSenDebate
Rokita says he won‚Äôt vote for a bill that spends money that hasn‚Äôt been printed and calls it ‚Äúa false choice.‚Äù
Messer and Rosita have a back and forth exchange over the latest spending bill. Rokita voted against it; Messer voted for it. Messer says he did it because @POTUS asked them to and accuses Rokita of not supporting Trump.
Still on paid family leave, Messer says he‚Äôs open to it, but it can‚Äôt raise taxes. Braun says he doesn‚Äôt think government should dictate to businesses. #INSenDebate
Paid family leave? Rokita says it shouldn‚Äôt be the government‚Äôs decision. It should be up the individual businesses. #INSenDebate

.@braun4indiana says the issue is rising costs. And the answer isn‚Äôt in D.C. #INSenDebate
First question: What is the problem with health care and how do you fix it? #INSenDebate
‚ÄúWho do you think looks more like Donald Trump?‚Äù @braun4indiana says. #INSenDebate

@msanserino @saamato @MichaelReschke1 I guess the average age of @theheraldtimes newsroom is younger than 18. Oh well. No shame.
@saamato @msanserino @MichaelReschke1 Normal = Ketchup.
@msanserino Has @MichaelReschke1  brainwashed you and @saamato?
@saamato @MichaelReschke1 What are you talking about? Of course it does.
#theblock has voted. @MichaelReschke1 is wrong to say that it's weird or un-American to put ketchup on hot dogs. #newsroomdebates

Work session for Friday and meeting Nov. 5 have been canceled. Meeting adjourns. #btowngov
Update to the vehicles and traffic code passes 8-0. #btowngov
Also didn't see many cases of cars having trouble turning left onto Gentry from Kirkwood. #btowngov
@BloomPlanTrans director Tom Micuda talks about Gentry Street. Says he observed it -- didn't see pedestrian crossing issues. #btowngov
@rachel_bunn What? Have a cool name for our election coverage? Haha
Amendment passes 8-0. Motorists can keep turning right on red at Grimes and Walnut. #btowngov
Staff would consider other options in the meantime. Neher cites concerns of traffic congestion on Grimes. #btowngov
Council member Darryl Neher proposes an amendment to remove the "no turn on red" on Grimes and Walnut from legislation. #btowngov
The no parking zones that overlap with neighborhood parking zone 11 are removed from the ordinance. Staff wrongly added it in. #btowngov
The unsafe building code update passed 8-0. Council member Susan Sandberg is absent tonight. #btowngov
Next up is the exciting update to traffic and vehicles code. Debate likely to center around a "no turn on red" sign on Grimes. #btowngov
Only one question from council, no public comment. Wrapping it up now. #btowngov
On to council business now. First up is an ordinance updating the city's unsafe building code. #btowngov
Story on that coming soon. #deerdebate #btowngov
As expected, #deerdebate is taking up the beginning of this meeting. The Humane Society of the U.S. issued site eval of Griffy this week.
