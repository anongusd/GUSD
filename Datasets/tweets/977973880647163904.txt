Tell me why are we sending 10 billion to Mexico use that for the wall. Stop paying all countries aide and use it to build the frickin wall. Stop all this crap and send all illegal immigrants home now. We don't want to pay for them anymore.
If walls don't work then why do we have walls at all our prisons and jails. Come on people use your brains if walls don't work why do Pelosi and Schumer and Feinstein, Harris and others have walls around their homes. Hell even Obama has one. Come on open your eyes not our taxes.
Look what it costs to keep illegals here. Money better spent to build the Wall. Taxpayers wake the HELL UP! What's wrong with your thinking. https://t.co/xUTqqFe006
@seanhannity Let's do this every Democratic must take in 10 illegal immigrants and take care of them by paying totally for their needs and take them off taxpayer backs. Bet you go broke in 30 days. They are draining our economy and our lives. Wake up Dems want to make America broke again.
