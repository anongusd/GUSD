These patient protections are under siege by insurance cos. We will keep fighting for patients as long as these issues exist. Thanks for hearing us out. We also encourage anyone who gets denied emergency coverage to tell us their story https://t.co/LwEoMrbCrG 11/11
cover emergency care based on symptoms, not final diagnoses. That's the Prudent Layperson Standard. Which Anthem and others openly disregard by refusing to cover patients who think they could be having an emergency 10/11
federal law - EMTALA - requires that every patient who visits an emergency dept be treated or stabilized. Insurers have no such mandate. What they do have is to  9/11
So there is room for reform and dialogue. But we wouldn't be so quick to give insurers a hall pass. Won't get too deep into the weeds BUT 8/11
Emergency docs support transparency and fair charges. Emergency bills include hospital facility charges - which docs don't control. And insurance cos need to provide #FairCoverage for emergency patients. 7/11
Some background on Fair Health - database was born when a large insurer settled a case where they were accused of fraudulently calculating and underpaying for OON services 6/11
But insurers cry foul and refuse to provide meaningful data 5/11
The Fair Health database (supported by many docs, patient groups, lawmakers, more) should help with that - independent source of health cost info where insurers report competitive rates for procedures 4/11
State and fed policymakers should compel insurance plans to provide reasonable numbers of In Network docs AND fair pay for emergency services 3/11

@DrHowieMell This predates our reaching out to @BPEricAdams to discuss, which we are doing this week w/ @mravenEM, a diagnosis/symptom expert!
@GeriaSonoMD @DrHowieMell @NYCEMSwatch Very aware of burnout and OF COURSE ER docs are the best, wherever they practice!
@GeriaSonoMD @DrHowieMell @NYCEMSwatch @DrHOwieMell @everydaymed can offer examples.Some UC staffed by EPs, some by physicians' assistants, internists. UC lacks full hospital svcs
@GeriaSonoMD @DrHowieMell @NYCEMSwatch UC didn't delay them. They delayed themselves by going to UC for ER-appropriate problems. Can be dangerous. Our docs see it daily.
@GeriaSonoMD @DrHowieMell @NYCEMSwatch 71% of our docs see patients on a daily basis who are referred to ER by UC.  Not all chest pain but all too sick for UC. Scary time wasted.
@emempathy @DrHowieMell @GeriaSonoMD Nope - our job. Never want to lose a patient who started at UC but should have been at the ER. Let the ER doc decide. Safe/sorry trade-off.
@emempathy @DrHowieMell @GeriaSonoMD People w/o medical training can't distinguish b/n potentially deadly CP and non-deadly CP. Why ER is the best place for chest pain.
@GeriaSonoMD @Libbyextra @DrHowieMell @NYCEMSwatch They do indeed - is it denial or fear of the bill? Scary when CP patients go to UC that isn't staffed by ER doc, as many aren't.
