Further, I never try to reform a whole group with rage and hate. I‚Äôd much rather convert or at least work with those who can be reasoned with. Use a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer. You‚Äôll get more done.
Oh, yes, rage is so much better than hate. You can hate a group, which is racism, etc., and which is wrong, but how can you rage against all individuals in a group when most specific individuals have done nothing to you or your kind? https://t.co/CWkNdXx0Tr

If we are truly going to move on, we truly need a color-blind - across the board - society, the evils of slavery notwithstanding. We don't need to have a "serious" (i.e., one-sided) national debate about it. We just need to do it.
It only serves to advance an agenda.
If we are ever going to move back to where we were in race relations (yes, we have regressed) and proceed forward from there, we have to get rid of double-standards and race-baiting. I regularly see news stories where the skin color is mentioned when it adds nothing.
If a white disagrees with a black, we want to enslave them and put them back on the plantation; black looting and rioting over things they disagree with is exercising their civil liberties.
Proper English is a symbol of white supremacy; ebonics and testing to race-based standards even the playing field. Ditto most affirmative action programs.
All whites are racists; blacks can't be. If you're white you can't truly understand the black experience; if you're black and act white (i.e., are conservative), you're an Uncle Tom.
What I really like about Trump: No one else would have rocked the boat the way he has in his first term. They would have had their eye on 2020 in every calculus. He doesn‚Äôt care. Good for him.
