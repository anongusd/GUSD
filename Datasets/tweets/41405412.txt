Starting this month, 1.4 million Puerto Ricans on the island will struggle to put food on the table if Congress fails to approve an additional $600 million for the Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP).  See @CenterOnBudget  &gt;&gt;  https://t.co/i6TE6PCZAr #FoodFri #TakeAction4PR https://t.co/vzIOIcAuWK
A4d: Recovery has been slow, in part, because assistance from FEMA to repair bridges and roads, clean debris, and rebuild homes has been difficult for some parts of the island, and for every resident, to access. #food4 #TakeAction4PR
A4c: This contributed to the majority of the island experiencing food insecurity right after the hurricanes. Unfortunately, the island still faces ongoing challenges to help residents overcome hunger. #FoodFri
A4b: For 1 year, families had limited opportunities of earning money for their basic needs such as food, water, and shelter—let alone the additional resources needed to rebuild their homes, farms, &amp; businesses. #FoodFri

A2b: Unlike Guam &amp; the Virgin Islands that have SNAP benefits, as a territory, the island has different laws &amp; regulations than states. Several of these weaken Puerto Ricans’ ability to prepare for emergencies &amp; limit access to nutrition assistance &amp; other supports 4 basic needs.
