@upchuckbuck @bridget_joy_ It's the definition. It's Karl Marx. It's a known and knowable thing. Like pregnancy - either private or public ownership of the means of production. A bright line test. The Constitution says private ownership countervailed by regulation. It works when the balance is right.
@CleDonnelly @brianmacian @EnBuenora @RWPUSA Capitalism counteracted by regulation in the public interest, resulting in a mixed economy. European nations do this - but they regulate and tax more in their balanced economy. The balance here is to less regulation and taxation. Especially of the rich and big business. Balance!

@williamlegate Let's proclaim you the new president. Since we're now getting into the "I proclaim it and thus it is so and everyone must accept it" game, let's play! I'm #Gesus, BTW. Back and updated after 2000 years and what a mess I find!
@therealsteppish Let's try it. #BenedictDonald is out of control and his #Complicit Party has collapsed. They're mere sycophants. There is no Senate. It's sick and bizarre. So, drastic action. They can't fire and replace everyone. After all, there's no money to hire. The government is shut down.
