Conclusion: tariffs do support SOME jobs and economic output. BUT they also reduce corporate and household spending, and thus economic output and jobs, in other sectors of the economy. 		OVERALL losses far outweigh the gains.		Full report link: https://t.co/g5pHvcYfYg

Scenario 1: current 232 steel/alum tariffs + 25% tariffs for all China 301 products + retaliation. March 2nd?		Impacts:		-Costs 935,000 NET US jobs, w/net losses in every state		-Over 8 lost for every 1 gained		-Reduces GDP by 0.37% annually		-Costs family of four $767 annually

@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC @TariffsHurt But none of it happens on day 1, or even day 200. There are lots of moving parts and it takes time for impacts to spread through the economy.		Our estimates capture the interrelated nature of such changes in a way that short-term BLS employment figures simply cannot. /END
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC @TariffsHurt Paying more for stuff and/or exporting less means fewer dollars available to spend on other services – education, housing, vacations, dining, retail – that drive the US economy. This is bad for long-run US employment growth.
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC @TariffsHurt In just a few months, steel/aluminum retaliatory tariffs reduced US exports by billions of dollars, including October declines of: 		 - $30 million for herbicide exports to Canada	 - $26 million for whiskey exports to the EU	 - $19 million for pork exports to Mexico
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC This doesn’t address harm to US companies from retaliatory tariffs. 		Most of those retaliatory tariffs took effect in July. The graph below, based on data compiled for @TariffsHurt, clearly shows the immediate damage to subject US exports. https://t.co/R9JLB5SKUs
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC Some companies are already there, overall job growth notwithstanding. Many others likely are just trying to hang on, praying the tariffs go away before really hard decisions must be made.
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC The decisions – and time it takes to make them – vary greatly by company. But they get harder, and layoffs become more likely, the longer tariffs stay in place.
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC Current workers may feel many impacts short of job loss: fewer hours, cuts to 401k or health care contributions, salary freezes.
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC If sales fall or margins get squeezed, they may postpone – or scale back – capital purchases. Similarly, they may slow or stop planned new hires.
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC Companies may (try to) raise prices to cover new costs. Again, some will be more successful than others.
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC Companies may look for new suppliers, domestic or foreign, that are not subject to tariffs. This takes both time and money, especially for products that require technical or safety certifications.
@DanAnthonyDC @CNBC First, companies may push back on suppliers to try to get them to lower prices. This tends to work better for big companies, since small businesses have less purchasing power, but no guarantees.
As @DanAnthonyDC told @CNBC, no company wants to lay off workers. It’s the last step when other options are exhausted, not the first. What happens in the meantime? https://t.co/SSzmrYaNWP
The big reason: it takes time for tariffs and retaliation impacts to work their way through the US economy. Our estimates are based on impacts after 1-3 years.

@ScottPaulAAM @dcjohnson ...avg monthly trade deficit w/China jumped from $530M to $1.1B, but mfg jobs up 23K, or 6%
@ScottPaulAAM @dcjohnson No broad, sweeping statement about deficits and mfg jobs is accurate. Look at semiconductors...(1/2)
@ScottPaulAAM @dcjohnson There's so much more to the equation, can't just say that trade deficits = mfg job losses (3/3)
@ScottPaulAAM @dcjohnson Avg monthly trade deficit in auto parts (NAICS 3363): $1.3B from Oct'08-Dec'09; $2.5B since Jan'10. (2/3)
@ScottPaulAAM @dcjohnson Avg monthly trade deficit in autos (NAICS 3361): $4.6B from Oct'08-Dec'09; $6.5B since Jan'10. (1/3)
@ScottPaulAAM @dcjohnson FYI, meant Dec'09
@ScottPaulAAM @dcjohnson mfg jobs have increased (and unemp rate fallen) since Jan 2010, same time that trade deficit started growing again
@ScottPaulAAM @dcjohnson but business cycles/recessions are when mfg job losses are largest-when trade deficit is shrinking (Sep'08-Dec'10)
