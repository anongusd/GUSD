@malavemark @Hafington @leahkrevit @Theo09130050 @widlits @paulosophia @VictoriaVanHor7 @MomsDemand @NRA Duh. What part aren’t you following?		If it becomes illegal to sell a gun to someone without a background check &amp; safety training, those sales become crimes, those sellers criminally prosecuted &amp; those sales reduced. 		No law eliminates 100% of the problem; reduction is the goal.
@malavemark @Hafington @leahkrevit @Theo09130050 @widlits @paulosophia @VictoriaVanHor7 @MomsDemand @NRA Again, your ‘question’ is based on predictions of what the court will rule. 		If you refuse to acknowledge other court rulings &amp; their predictions, rewrite your question.
@malavemark @Hafington @leahkrevit @Theo09130050 @widlits @paulosophia @VictoriaVanHor7 @MomsDemand @NRA Criminals, by definition, ignore laws.		Better gun laws identify criminals before they become murderers.
@malavemark @Hafington @leahkrevit @Theo09130050 @widlits @paulosophia @VictoriaVanHor7 @MomsDemand @NRA I didn’t say a word about race.		I’m comparing one court ruling to another as it relates to will &amp; expectation of the people.		No one is arguing against self-defense. We’re arguing IN self-defense. For responsible law that protects all citizens, including responsible gun owners.
@malavemark @Hafington @leahkrevit @Theo09130050 @widlits @paulosophia @VictoriaVanHor7 @MomsDemand @NRA That was already covered. You’re arguing on what you hope and/or predict will be allowed by courts.		People hoped &amp; predicted Brown vs Board would go the other way.		It didn’t because it was wrong. What’s right will eventually prevail,	in the courts, for the people.
@malavemark @Hafington @leahkrevit @Theo09130050 @widlits @paulosophia @VictoriaVanHor7 @MomsDemand @NRA My argument is that restrictions are lawful, currently in place and necessary.
@leahkrevit @malavemark @Hafington @Theo09130050 @widlits @paulosophia @VictoriaVanHor7 @MomsDemand @NRA Before it’s argued, yes killing is already against the law. The distinguishing factor with guns is that 3 year old children can &amp; have killed with guns.	No other item or tool or weapon has that capability. Guns are uniquely dangerous &amp; demand laws that respect that reality.

@DogginTrump @SeriousSwill Trump has reserved ‘kindness’ for oppressive rulers &amp; those willing to lie, cheat &amp; murder on his behalf		That’s not kind—it’s deeply wicked &amp; corrupt		Continue being kind to women, POC, journalists, workers, farmers, all humans &amp; the planet we share by demanding truth &amp; justice

@marybar41015771 Indeed!
@nebhuskergma @RWPUSA Bill Clinton broke his commitment to his wife and this entire country.		Bill Clinton is still respected &amp; maintains ongoing financial success.		If you don’t want to hear about Monica Lewinsky, don’t talk about her.		She can’t move on &amp; out of the public eye until YOU let her.
If you don’t care about it, shut TF up about it.		And hire her do something that doesn’t require her to be ‘that woman’ from 20 years ago.		So many Americans REFUSE to let Monica move on &amp; then blame HER for their ongoing obsession.		it’s appalling &amp; remarkably sexist.		Enough!
Bill Clinton was literally the most powerful man on the planet.		HE broke his commitment to his wife.		HE enjoyed an affair instead of focusing on his job as president.		HE lied about it—forcing a nationwide distraction in the form of impeachment.		HE maintains respect &amp; success.

@melandray2 @robertrea @sandralhanlon @kaitlancollins Haha, agreed! Wishful thinking.	Trump only tells the truth accidentally!
@MzJayFord @krassenstein @StormyDaniels This is the story they published: 		https://t.co/YpIc9EgoVt
@MzJayFord @krassenstein @StormyDaniels #1 it’s Avenatti srsly blaming J Wohl	Krass bros agree &amp; say he’s “basking in the glory...” &amp; give him more w/this		#2 Every DV vic has had a big FU. Worse is disbelief so abuse continues. Nothing here indicates *possibility* of a real victim, ONLY angle is that MA is innocent
@krassenstein .@StormyDaniels responded appropriately &amp; respectfully to all parties involved		You &amp; Ed gave Wohl a headline &amp; didn’t once mention the real possibility there is a real abuse victim here		You promoted blind faith in Avenatti &amp; his unbacked theories just as MAGAs do for Trump 😟😤 https://t.co/YWufb525z4
@RadioFreeTom @QueenBertRoyal He’s also a grandfather, father of a 12yo boy &amp; husband of a woman w/a campaign against online bullying. 		It almost makes him seem human, but if cared for &amp; respected any of these people, let alone the ppl of this country, it’d #BeBest to choose words that invite honor &amp; unity.
7/ vs seeking similarities &amp; holding accountable those in power;	they’ll control &amp; benefit from self-serving myth &amp; division. They’ll thrive &amp; enhance their own ‘freedom’ while trampling each of our freedoms &amp; rights.		We must stand together &amp;	Stand for each other	or we all fall.
6/ Overwhelmingly they claim all of these groups ‘have it better’ than you bc Democrats—that’s projection.		The overlapping target groups, fueled by lies, fear, hate &amp; false envy drive ppl to vote GOP, though very few truly benefit. 		As long as we keep focus on our differences..
5/The GOP perpetuates these as tools to keep us divided. Powerful, wealthy, mainly white &amp; mainly men in top GOP roles are driven by greed to grow only their own wealth &amp; power.		They rely on lies, hate &amp; division.		They work against all women, all POC &amp; all non-wealthy.
4/ The same applies to today’s white ppl. We did not create racism, but we must see &amp; use our unearned power &amp; privilege to end it.		Ending hate requires ALL of US.		Like patriarchy &amp; racism, all forms of degradation, discrimination &amp; hate existed long before before our country.
3/ Blaming ‘the other women’, (white women) for patriarchy is the exact same concept		All women suffer from it while men benefit		An end will come when women stand together &amp; men stand WITH us		Today’s men did not create the problem but have power &amp; responsibility to change it
2/ That same idea	-denies women sexual freedom	-forces women to carry the burden of men’s broken commitments	-claims only men are trustworthy by falsely redirecting blame	-denies women the right to be treated w/respect		It is powerless against cheating bc the cheater has control
1/ The idea that women hold more blame for patriarchy than men IS a patriarchal view benefitting men.		It is the same idea that says when a man cheats, the ‘other woman’ is to blame, not him		That grants men sexual freedom, removes accountability,	prioritizes men &amp; their desires
Patriarchy is men holding power over women		In each of these, women voted w/their own patriarchs		WW chose same cand. as WM	WOC chose same cand. as MOC		Within race, More women voted DEM than men w/2 exceptions:		BW -10% vs BM on Gillum	WW 0 to -3% vs WM on Abrams	(3% WM no ansr) https://t.co/LRLHSpxoeV

@ispreadliberty @alllibertynews @LaurenTaylorMI @justinamash How can you ask citizens to engage in ‘thoughtful civil debate’ when elected officials refuse to do the same?		They refuse by maintaining a gridlocked govt, lying to voters &amp; devaluing votes via gerrymandering &amp; blatant suppression		How do you reduce govt while bowing down to it?
@ispreadliberty @alllibertynews @LaurenTaylorMI @justinamash I’m on board w/that		How do claims citizens ‘riot like f*cking animals’ when facing elected GOP oppressors work to meet those goals?

@DIPGparent @CoryBooker Politicians are never going to be non-partisan.

@mrwinchester200 @jax_rene @ScrubbedCTSurg @cubedreamer @NRA I’m not anti-gun, I’m pro-responsibility. I am personally ok w/the idea of gun safety taught in schools. Gun violence is a chronic public safety issue that must be addressed with educated voices. Laws must support that same responsibility—why not require addl training w/purchase?
@FreedomTruthJoy It’s NOT okay AT ALL that racism is not seen/taught as impactful reality #NoExcuses	It’s disturbing that white-man-victim mentality is promoted by GOP, Fox	etc to increase systemic abuse	Voices of hate MUST be silenced—even if by same mere self-preservation that propagates it now
@friends_guns I’ve been shadow-banned too; it’s infuriating. Twitter could easily flag tweets that will be marked by algorithm *before* they’re posted.

@nprpolitics “House Dems are working together to determine how to make the most of their 2019 majority”		This SHOULD happen. Just going along w/tradition got us where we are today. 	They SHOULD *ALL* talk about it, including Pelosi and together determine the most effective plan of action.

The level of corruption that’s baked into our govt is absurd &amp; demands correction.		Loopholes have become the law.
@myserenity69 A woman patient kicking a male doctor/nurse is really not the best message... *??*		Women ARE the doctors &amp; nurses	Women’s strength &amp; all the People’s strength comes from building each other up	Kicking people around is what oppressors do		Men—stand WITH us, your balls are safe 😀
@rcmwandering @TrumpDog1 @merrichristi @JustJen2015 @bendoll1 @kylegriffin1 Power belongs to the PEOPLE.	Individuals with singular power are anti-democratic.		Money as it’s own voice directly opposes the strength &amp; power of the PEOPLE.		Dems don’t attack—they defend.	They stand for democracy.	They stand for EQUAL rights.	They stand for ALL of the PEOPLE.
@TrumpDog1 @merrichristi @JustJen2015 @bendoll1 @kylegriffin1 I disagree.		Repubs see themselves as one group &amp; stand for one group.	They deliver one BS message—	the delivery method itself is their strength.		Dems see themselves as everyone &amp; stand for everyone.	They deliver many strong messages—the delivery method itself is their weakness.

@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio I have no doubt whatsoever your intentions are good; I just think using one faulty system to fix another faulty system is unlikely to have the positive impact that’s needed &amp; could potentially delay that or even make things worse
@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio Outside of individual lawsuits, do patients &amp; their families have any role in determining if their care has improved and/or on how successfully their needs are being met?
@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio Who wouldn’t allow it? Seems never more apparent than now that when ppl are driven by greed, there’s little they won’t do 😟		if passed, results will rely on govt compliance agents enforcing rules that comps will either adhere to as minimally as possible and/or fight in court...
@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio Ok ty—Regulation doesn’t seem to be stopping them. Time/$$ spent on lawyers &amp; court, they lose, still few improvements		Is there/ has there been any attempt at smthg like independent surveys of *patients &amp; staff* on specific issues w/instant harsh fines if a threshold isn’t met?
@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio Right; so say they try—I think it’s fair to assume they’ll try everything they can—they roll out something like this slowly, meanwhile, patient care doesn’t change. Eventually investigation.	If CMS finds wrongdoing, whats the process for appeal? Can the companies sue if disagree?
@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio Re-reading the RT, again my concern is how this will truly end up impacting patient care..		For example—What stops them from rewriting manager titles &amp; descriptions to include patient care (only on paper or mostly paper) so they meet the law—but in practice change nothing at all?

@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio That is awesome, thank you for doing that &amp; also for being patient &amp; informative with me here— 		Last Qs &amp; I’ll stop bugging you 😊	Are you part of SEIU-UHW? Are they as much a force behind this as the ‘No’ endorsements indicate?

@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio Thanks!! Will take a closer look at all of these
@ProudResister @GOP I’m not sure its fair to say #GOP *gave* us Trump		He rolled over them like a tank in 2016 They not only took his abuse lying down—when they dusted themselves off, they shamelessly joined his greed brigade		It’s almost as if their words have no meaning &amp; their backs have no spine
3/ Additionally, black men are among least likely to commit suicide		In my (non-legal) opinion, a state/fed/FBI investigation is needed		Even if self-inflicted, the personal &amp; community impact of police brutality &amp; injustice is tangible &amp; demands a closer look		 #JusticeForDanye https://t.co/j0biwtgcZJ
2/ Jones’ is the latest life lost in a series of deaths of black men in #Ferguson, many of which have clear connections to prominent protesters following the death by police of Michael Brown in 2014		(Note—Reader View recommended for images to load)  	https://t.co/DBL9hXSGiG
1/ @AP released a story regarding the death of #DanyeJones		Officials say the cause of death is not yet determined, but the investigation is labeled a suicide		It’s possible the autopsy will reveal more than what’s consistent w/suicide, but seems unlikely		https://t.co/QnM6oE5u2s

@EmanuelSpeaks @itsbelilupercio Hi—I’m trying to learn more about Prop 8 too. It seems like there’s a lot of gray area about what is included in ‘quality patient care’ 	So that could end up being decided by insurance company lawyers; always scary, possibly much worse if reps manage to overturn ACA...		Thoughts?
@daydream_lamb @Ange_Amene looking into Prop 8 rt now &amp; saw your tweet		it seems like 8 is written in a really muddy way so will be up to lawyers &amp; judges to determine how it actually plays out		I’m still digging but plan to vote NO—they should rewrite it so it’s clear before changing patients lives &amp; care
@bringfriends4u It appears the focus was US history vs history of humankind.	He said 👇 &amp; did not block me—	A fair response IMO. Of course you’re welcome to disagree. https://t.co/DjLSnJgHmT
@CurtisIP1 @stevendavidwils @thatcolinbell @TheRickWilson @JacobAWohl 😂 people will find a way to take anything as a personal attack or insult		No doubt that’s the conditioning effect of Twitter ...😒		An edit button vs trying to explain what you *meant* within character limits to a vengeful/passionate?retweeter ganging up on you...		@jack please!
@freddyatton @Ginafurlynn @realDonaldTrump This one right here pitting people on the same side against each other		Someone could literally be in every single one of those categories		They aren’t competitive,	they all have the same oppressor—a government run on #Greed &amp; not by the people
@CurtisIP1 @stevendavidwils @thatcolinbell @TheRickWilson @JacobAWohl Mistakes are totally fine— Ive never wanted to edit anyone else’s tweet 😊 With limited characters, autocorrect &amp; exacerbated tension here, one word or the absence of a word can send a totally different message than intended, esp within a thread when ppl only see one RT’d reply
@jdmar3 @NuclearAnthro @bringfriends4u Of course you don’t need to, I didn’t say you did, I asked if you were open to it and you’re not. That’s a totally fair response. 	Thanks for responding 🙏
@NuclearAnthro @jdmar3 @bringfriends4u The thread started with a call out that I said seemed only to serve division. I don’t think a polite request to reconsider discussion in a public forum crosses a boundary. @jdmar3, I am sorry if that’s how you feel. My intention was to unify, dialogue &amp; reduce personal attacks.
@NuclearAnthro @jdmar3 @bringfriends4u Please tell him— I’m not an expert &amp; said so many times. The article I shared said the same as you. 		We can’t succeed if we don’t support each other &amp; at least attempt to dialogue about issues that matter to us. We are on the same side here, attacking each other gets us nowhere.

Hi @jdmar3!	I inadvertently volunteered to do HR for #TheResistance lol 🙂		My friend @bringfriends4u was looking to discuss history of tribes, but it seems you may have got another impression &amp; blocked him		Intentions are good all around—open to giving him another shot? 	Thx! ✌🏼 https://t.co/6bl2sDBLQV
@bringfriends4u What did he say that was wrong?	It doesn’t look to me like he was stating any facts... am I missing something?		It looks like he was reiterating the sentiment here: https://t.co/5LkOdx3XYc
@bringfriends4u Lol both what? 😊	Agree? Disagree? Just History Info? Your recommendation?
@JWMcQuatchi @PracticalLefty @phillywom96 @KarenHBStanley @Elsjuhc1 @LongAsUCan2 @peterdaou No idea... I won’t get alerts about some likes &amp; replies but then someone will RT &amp; I’ll see replies from hours or days ago 🤷🏻‍♀️ 🤷🏻‍♀️
@bringfriends4u Cool, will be interesting. 	So I can reiterate... what was your POV? 	Just for him to know more history or do you think what he said was wrong? If so—what do you recommend?
@bringfriends4u If he blocked you, he can’t see you.	What’s the point of the call out?		We all know people are dicks.	We know it’s easy to take things completely wrong, especially on Twitter.		Idk much about tribal history, I’m interested—Tell me more &amp; I’ll pass it on to him   (not sarcasm)
@PracticalLefty @phillywom96 @KarenHBStanley @Elsjuhc1 @JWMcQuatchi @LongAsUCan2 @peterdaou (??) I know you know... we walked through it all yesterday &amp; agreed 100% completely that the people have more power than they know &amp; kicking the cable is one great way to show it		—	Side note: My notifications are f’kd right now... Are yours too?
@bringfriends4u Yeah that was a dick move		So was making the effort to call him out as a coward &amp; not share your thoughts &amp; knowledge on the topic		You know Twitter is hostile—opening w/ “you do realize...” is often a gateway to crazytown		He should have given you a chance, we can all do better
@bringfriends4u What is your goal with this?	It is NOT the time to divide people. 		We stand *together* and fight the #Greed that rules in government, 	that rules against every single one of US born without a silver spoon,	or we all fall.		Educate—YES	Humiliate? No.

Lastly—simple solutions would keep gvmt out of bdrns &amp; doctors offices WHILE reducing abortions AND Improving sexual health:	non-abstinence-based sex ed, easy access to birth control &amp; quality, universal maternity &amp; child care resources—any oneof those would alter the debate alot
2/ Demonizing abortion literally forces women in that mindset to choose motherhood or murder; ‘legal’ blockades for all women risk jobs, education, independence, health &amp; safety; ignore a future child’s life while completely freeing equally responsible fathers from accountability

4/  #Humanism's goal sees individuals as the sum of their own choices &amp; actions. #Equality means everyone has the same #opportunity to move up from where they started.	As Americans WE are so focused on indv. financial success, we applaud doing whatever it takes to get to the top.
3/ False competition &amp; tunnel-vision keep these groups separate &amp; prevent them from standing together	This self-centered approach fuels Trump &amp; his supporters. 	They blindly, wrongly &amp; hatefully BLAME the fight for others' rights for their own inability to advance in society.
2/ Race Color Sex Gender Sexual Orientation Age Nationality Religion Ability/Medical Cond. Citizenship		None of these are by individual choice	All of the people they include can face discrimination	None of their rights *compete*	#LGBT #BLM #MeToo are ALL about #HumanRights
1/ The thread below is a clear example of what is at the core of American division. Even if the specifics aren't your personal experience--this trend impacts you.	Groups that have been forced to demand their civil rights have lost sight of the common experience of oppression. https://t.co/O3jrhG5mzm

@RRN3 @maddow @realDonaldTrump It was a total fail	If Dems don’t immediately work to dismantle electoral college upon gaining congressional control it’s our failure too	Electoral college is UNbalanced, UNchecked &amp; makes our govt a GAME to WIN or LOSE... apparently more important than real success or failure
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SecNielsen 1) They are UNarmed refugees who are NOT a threat and NOT ‘invading’		2) The SAME people means OUR Troops		Helping w/paperwork,Telling them explicitly what will happen here		Give them a well-INFORMED option to come or NOT		Start processing paperwork HERE so we have answers FAST
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SecNielsen The same people who’d be funding 100s of troops &amp; gear &amp; food &amp; housing &amp; medical care when they *get* to our little line in the sand &amp; while they wait for us to decide if we will imprison, kidnap or deport them		Exchange facts now—WE EACH make more informed, efficient decisions
@FoxNews @SecNielsen Of course, that would only be the humane, sensible &amp; cost effective option.
@FoxNews @SecNielsen They have no home.

@a_j_stansbury @MSNBC She has been called out for rasicm many times in the past		It’s a stretch to call it ignorance,	but if you can, it’s willful ignorance—as wrong as intentional racism		At the VERY least she AND her producers should seek to inform her BEFORE she spews ‘ignorance’ on a natl stage 🤦🏻‍♀️
@MSNBC Too late—Say goodbye.		At best, @megynkelly failed her obligation to learn wtf she’s talking about when she speaks on a national stage. She’s been called out for racism *MANY* times before.		At worst, she is knowingly spreading ignorant, hateful racism—as is anyone who hires her.
@HelmerRivera @JKamin20 @amber_athey @pnjaban Wrong.		Dialogue is conversation &amp; discussion—I can’t do it alone		If @amber_athey was interested in dialogue, she’d respond		NPCs spread false information—	Trump regularly calls women &amp; POC dogs &amp; animals—That’s a fact		If you’re interested in facts,	you can’t also support Trump
@VerySmartBros @TheRoot She’s a white supremacist—actively using her platform to spread, excuse &amp; normalize racism—maintaining systemic white supremacy in our nation		She should be shamed &amp; ignored out  of earshot		Freedom of speech doesn’t mean we must listen		Turn off the TV, block her, shut it down

@jimmybuttler81 @CNNPolitics So actually... since Trump allowed Melania’s parents to immigrate...		“Trump is behind chain migration”
@jimmybuttler81 @CNNPolitics You’re saying one non-sourced alleged democrat involved proves “democrats are behind” an migrant caravan		So by the same logic, multiple Republicans guilty of multiple crimes= 	Republicans are behind crimes, 	aka Republicans are criminals
@jimmybuttler81 @CNNPolitics I didn’t said it did. These Republicans all plead or were found guilty of criminal charges—so according to your logic, it must mean all Republicans are criminals

@queer_i_am @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @BravenakBlog @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina I think it’s a stretch—based on your own comparison to dental work, but it doesn’t strike me personally as extreme.		For someone who thinks of abortion as actual murder, however—it sounds purely homicidal.		That’s the person/POV I was replying to. Picking an in-fight is on you 👍
@queer_i_am @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @BravenakBlog @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina I have had several conversations with pro-lifers who had never previously considered what leads to abortion &amp; support the ideas I mentioned. Some will never budge but arguing extremes isn’t getting us anywhere either.
@queer_i_am @BravenakBlog @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina I agree—It’s entirely totally 100% ok &amp; absolutely necessary option		Say you like it if you want to,	I think it alienates reasonable people who have a gut reaction to the word,	but do or would support more access to birth control &amp; better sex-ed—benefiting all &amp; reducing the need
@queer_i_am @BravenakBlog @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina Yes of course it is,	You’re not following me at all.		I’m saying there are several ways all of those things can be avoided without reducing rights or choices &amp; instead actually enabling more people to make the best choice for themselves, including that of abortion
@queer_i_am @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @BravenakBlog @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina Saying you like it supports the thoughtless idea behind pro-life arguments that suggest pro-choice folks enjoy it		It can be necessary &amp; must be available, but like the dental work example—brushing your teeth is a better option—if everyone sees that we might actually move forward
@Felgraf_Physics @KFILE @lorrainemiller7 That’s what you thought, but that’s not what I said. Next time, ask me.
@queer_i_am @BravenakBlog @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina I 100% support the right to choose. 		My point is that choice is difficult &amp; comes with more risks &amp; burdens than not having to make it at all.		There are very simple ways to do that, w/o any additional burden on women or anyone else. Access to abortion should remain &amp; increase.
@queer_i_am @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @BravenakBlog @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina My entire point is that going to the dentist is necessary &amp; having that opportunity is necessary. 		But you don’t ‘like’ it enough that you refuse to brush your teeth—do you?
@BravenakBlog @queer_i_am @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina She can speak for herself. 	I’m asking her.	It’s one thing to say you like having the choice—it’s a fucking necessary option &amp; im not suggesting it should end. When you ‘like’ something, that’s something you enjoy &amp; look forward to. That’s very different.
@queer_i_am @ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @BravenakBlog @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina Are you saying you’d prefer to have an abortion over not getting pregnant in the first place? 		If everything else stayed the same in your life—you’d prefer to take the time, physical toll, expense &amp; risk that goes with any pregnancy so you could get an abortion?
@ThickAsABrick72 @MarkWarner @SenatorLeahy Actions speak louder than words—MUCH MUCH louder		If they care about PECs they would pass a law RIGHT NOW to cover them		Until then—They are *ACTING* ONLY to kill protections for PECs
Why the fuck is #WhiteFeminism trending?		WF does NOT EXIST	A #feminist supports ALL women &amp; stands for rights of every woman—incl those who won’t stand for themselves		If you draw a line at how women are treated by race—that is pure #Racism &amp; it immediately ceases to be feminism
@ConservaGrrl @LizEClark @BravenakBlog @Sigmundine2 @khaleesikhaldro @RantyAmyCurtis @PolitikMasFina Nobody *likes* abortion		It could be dramatically reduced w/non-abstinence-based sex ed, easy access to birth control &amp; quality, universal maternity &amp; child care resources		If you care about life, make that happen		Otherwise you’re just punishing women for the ability to conceive
@ThickAsABrick72 @MarkWarner @SenatorLeahy Dismantling ACA dismantles protection for PECs		If GOP cares about PECs they can pass a law RIGHT NOW to cover them		‘Minions’ like yourself are fine with dismantling ACA without a PEC solution *ONLY* because you hate Obama more than you love the people in your life w/PECs

11/ Truth, Justice &amp; Human Rights are being shot down in the middle of Pennsylvania Ave &amp; we’re just watching 😳		We cannot standby—	#TheResistance MUST STAND UP		HOPE will survive	WE MUST carry it		For ourselves &amp; each other	WE STAND TOGETHER NOW	—OR—	WE ALL FALL APART		#RESIST
10/ A MAGAs ‘elite’ status lies not in personal wealth, but in unified power of Regressive Christians &amp; White Nationalists		They’re ‘winning’ bc they see themselves as ONE		WE are losing 	bc we’re *STILL* focused on differences		We MUST SEE &amp; MUST ACT	On our common, severe threat
11/ Reporters, citizens of the people, who work to deliver the #truth		have been threatened, ridiculed &amp; called into merciless doubt &amp; criticism by POTUS-driven,	false accusations of ‘fake news’		They have been shot &amp; killed on US soil; another brutally murdered by foreign agents
10/ Most of this is NOT new		What’s new, what’s alarming—	is how rapidly these things have risen to the surface of American culture		All in one moment—driven by our own elected ‘leaders’ &amp; 	without a STRONG &amp; UNITED FIGHT From US—for basic human rights, for order, for respect.
9/  White Nationalism is legalized w/ —blatant voter suppression + gerrymandering, espc toward POC &amp; Native Americans	—Through failure to respond to white crimes of baseless hatred	—including preventable, violent gun deaths of innocent citizens, children, students &amp; teachers
8/  White Nationalism is legalized, normalized &amp; promoted via:	—failure to recognize US history of abusive practices	—destructive &amp; false depictions of immigrants as harmful threats, an excuse for inhumane &amp;       inexcusable policies of separation &amp; wrongful deportation
7/ Core 2–White Nationalism	has a wide range of expressions, from proud supremacy to total denial 		Most common under thin disguise:	“America First”	“Build the Wall”	“Respect ICE”	“Better than Obama”	“Respect the Flag”	“Blue Lives Matter” 	And of course... “MAGA”
6/ You see inequality w/abortion	—no paternal responsibility for unwanted pregnancy	—all blame &amp; burden falls to the woman	—‘choice’ is positioned as opposition to ‘life’		—Men are faultlessly ‘unable to control sexual urges’	—Sexual predators enabled,	#MeToo #Survivors mocked
5/ It discredits women’s rights.	It defines her purpose as little more than a vessel for maternity—		You hear it in: 	“Better than Hillary”		You see it in:	-Kavanaugh’s demeanor change w/Klobuchar &amp; Harris	-The absence of policies supporting equal pay &amp; healthcare etc
4/ A constant in the oppressive code is that sex is purely for procreation		It denies human nature.		It snowballs into narrowly defined gender roles, wielding sexuality as a tool of power &amp; shame.		It’s the pathway to denying basic human rights to the LGBT community....
3/ Regressive values are driven by patriarchy &amp; teach believers strictly to ‘obey’ commandments with unquestioning faith		That’s created:	—religious elitism: “My rights are more important than yours, bc my God is better” 	—religious discrimination: i.e. the Muslim Travel Ban
2/ Every explanation, excuse &amp; defense of Trump boils down to two core motivators:		White Nationalism &amp; 	Regressive Christianity		WN needs no explanation. By RC I’m talking exclusively of Christianity that oppresses it’s own believers &amp; defends cruelty as God’s will.
1/  Two years ago Trump was elected &amp; we’re still trying to diagnose his supporters		Day after day we ask—	“HOW can they believe that!?”	“WHY!?”		It’s time to accept MAGAs are exactly who they say they are.		They have shown us everything we need to know.	We MUST move forward.

@shaunking Appreciating all the likes &amp; RTs on this 🙏 It’s been on my mind, so I posted short thread on ML, HRC &amp; how it relates to #metoo &amp; #feminism —pinned to my profile. 		#VoteBlue #WomenRiseUp #Resistance
RT @bluewavegal: @disentidealist @Shehon01 @brycetache The followers returned! He’s all back!!!
#Women must stand together:		as #feminists for justice &amp; rights	in support of #meToo	against oppressive patriarchy	w/respect for individual experiences	w/respect for differences among race, age, religion, ability etc		willing to learn &amp; to teach	willing to #persist	—&gt;#WomenRiseUp
8/ Society obsesses over others’ sex lives while shaming sexuality in women &amp; promoting harmful, ‘traditional’ norms of #patriarchy	—&gt;#Feminism’s battle		Norms shape HRC’s words, forbid Monica from moving forward &amp; keep BC successful		They maintain #rapeculture	—&gt;#MeToo’s battle
7/ HRC still defends her husbands choice to stay in power.		She chose to accept his infidelities for her own reasons. 		It could be lack of self-respect, could be forgiveness. It could be an understood &amp; accepted, welcome, part of her relationship.		If so, could she say that?
6/ ML did not choose to be seen almost exclusively as that one, self-serving, but not criminal, choice for the next 20+ years. 		As a society, we unjustly choose that for her.		Love her, hate her or forgive her—Hillary was a strong contributor to that.
5/ Yes, the impeachment process was harsh. But BC kept is role &amp; has faced little accountability in the long run. He remains respected &amp; well-paid.		ML remains defined by one choice she made as a 22-yo to enjoy the affection &amp; attention of a man she admired &amp; found attractive.
4/ ML made a choice &amp; she owns it.		Bill Clinton made choices: 	HE chose monogamy w/HRC	HE chose to break his vows	He disrespected his wife, ML &amp; the presidency	HE took advantage of a woman while in a position of power, elected to serve	HE chose to lie under oath, a crime
3/ Bill Clinton—A US president &amp; married man in a position of power &amp; influence, chose to engage in a sexual relationship w/a young intern &amp; lie about it		Yet—the common phrase describing that event is “the Lewinksi scandal”		HERS is the name paired w/ scandal &amp; disgrace, not HIS
2/ Monica Lewinski is not a victim of sexual assault &amp; doesn’t claim to be She’s not a #metoo survivor.		She is a #woman whose opportunities have been limited.	Not by her choices, but by judgement of them through the harsh lens of gender &amp; sexuality.	That’s what #feminism fights. https://t.co/KMwgNqBEaw
Misunderstandings abound...		1/ #MeToo is specifically dedicated to advocacy for survivors of sexual violence		It gave women a new voice and helped drive a surge in #Feminism 		The two partner in supporting #women &amp; #survivors but are not one in the same https://t.co/4P5NjvFNqj

@Phil_P_Saliba Also a definite possibility!	I’m in defense mode against haters &amp; in need of sleep. Gonna try to get some of the latter ready to face another day of then former. 	Consider my judgement withheld. 🙂
@Phil_P_Saliba Nah. I’ve had enough games.		TBH, it seems more like a setup to prove someone wrong; which for them probably won’t be fun or eye-opening at all.
@HShagan1962 @BeavisImposter @WSJ You’re not arguing at all. You’re agreeing that privilege often offers more protection than the law and you’re providing an example that supports exactly that. 🙏
@HShagan1962 @BeavisImposter @WSJ Alleged false accusers should be treated to a thorough &amp; unbiased investigation &amp; public trial. Unless proven guilty, they are innocent. That’s the law. 		Same applies to alleged sexual predators. Unless privilege frees them from accountability. That’s the reality we witnessed.
@HShagan1962 @BeavisImposter @WSJ Oh there’s another one of you. Wonderful. I never brought up accusations. I said she was treated badly. Trump admitted to mocking her and credited it with Kavanaugh’s “win”.  That’s bad treatment. https://t.co/8cvb1Jikgw
@BeavisImposter @WSJ I was in the observation room in the building at the moment it was happening. 	It makes no difference whatsoever. You are being dismissive when you describe her like that, as if the voice of a victim, sounding like a victim, is discrediting.
@BeavisImposter @npwest @WSJ In all likelihood they will be dismissed because he’s no longer a DC court judge. Because he now has the seat Republicans stole for him, in multiple ways, on multiple occasions. He’s practically untouchable. It’s filthy &amp; sick.
@HShagan1962 @BeavisImposter @WSJ It’s really this simple: She was not up for a seat on the Supreme Court. 	He was. He failed.	He failed in his response to her. He failed in accepting initial proceedings w/ a fraction of documents released.	He failed when he lied about stolen info in prior hearings &amp; in this one.
@BeavisImposter @npwest @WSJ His “immaturity” “outbursts” &amp; “obvious republican favoritism” show he lacks self-control.	He cannot exercise or display good judgement under pressure. 	Forgive him, fine. Believe him even, fine.	Put him on the Supreme Court for the next 30+ years? No. Entirely unacceptable.
@BeavisImposter @WSJ If you had a credible point, you wouldn’t feel the need to belittle her to prove it. You are saying much more about yourself than you are about her.
@BeavisImposter @npwest @WSJ Additional, credible complaints filed against him BEFORE DrBlasey’s testimomy, about his time as DC judge, referred *after* his swearing in—making them all but dismissed.

@BeavisImposter @WSJ 😑😑😑 She lied about FFFFFlying?That makes for a smear campaign?		The US president doubted &amp; mocked her &amp; is now bragging about it. That’s a smear.

@BoldlyTweeting I’m super light-sensitive, suffered from migraines lasting MONTHS.

@WSJ ICYMI @WSJ, Kavanaugh was treated like a potential SCOTUS Justice, except with ZERO accountability, as if he was a victim &amp; as if he were the only option.		The way #DrBlasey was treated is what WILL impact the midterms.		#MeToo	#WomenRiseUp	#BelieveSurvivors	#VoteBlueNoMatterWho

@NBCNews Brunson hasn’t been in the US since Trump was elected. If he has a degree of humanity, it won’t be long until he’s praying for Trump, not with him.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Seems pretty clear &amp; not at all a coincidence that Brunson’s release was related to the ‘disappearance’ of #JamalKhashoggi on Turkish soil.		Trump has made it quite clear he values money over human lives, especially the lives of—as he indicated of Khashoggi—non-citizens.
@MrDane1982 @janny_mous The millions so disconnected from reality to think Trump is ‘one of them’ work in her favor. Until critical thinking is the #1 educational outcome &amp; ‘News’ reports actual events—not headlined lies &amp; pundit editorials, for-profit &amp; w/o objectivity—reality will remain subjective.
@DougRothman @luzmerygaviria @SaysHummingbird OK until ‘wiped from the records’. History must be learned from. Comparisons to Hitler are significant bc they’re based on reality.

@TeaPainUSA @JaneBrook13 @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Meh. It’ll just give him another reason not to. He’ll say ‘he doesn’t take orders from her’... etc. Someone would likely stop him before he says ‘he will if she does’, though that’d be the place for her to start.

“It’s a dangerous time for men”		Example: In which Trevor &amp; Brett feel threatened by someone who watched  ‘A Star is Born’—the 4th version since 1937—&amp; offered some reflections on society		Be alert people	Art should reflect life but	women shouldn’t talk about either,	apparently https://t.co/aQWrZA1avL
@McBainsGoggles @bonacum_brett @voxdotcom Victimization is singling someone out for unfair treatment—that’s what you are attempting to do by calling me pathetic &amp; my ideas stupid &amp; pointless.
@McBainsGoggles @bonacum_brett @voxdotcom An artist makes art for themself. Nobody can tell anyone else how to feel or when or why.		Likewise, everyone decides for themselves what art means to them		It is wise to contemplate &amp; relfect on the ideas that art inspires
@McBainsGoggles @bonacum_brett @voxdotcom It’s possible to enjoy a movie AND acknowledge that it reflects aspects of society that need improvement. 		This one is in its 4th iteration since 1937—It’s subject to reflective  criticism. 		Our choices as a society are always up for review. That’s how we get better.
@McBainsGoggles @bonacum_brett @voxdotcom Does it? You’re equally free to write your own article outlining the details of your observations.
@McBainsGoggles @bonacum_brett @voxdotcom The article *is commentary* 	ABOUT how a movie 	adheres to patriarchal structures and seems to promote rape culture.		That’s art imitating life.		That’s the whole fucking idea, Trevor. Thank you for so unnecessarily stating the obvious.
@eddyredrex @bex0760 @CNN Do you have a story of survival?		Women will listen	We will hear your pain &amp; your truth	We won’t compete or compare	We offer compassion, comfort &amp; wish you the peace we deny ourselves		Thats how we’ve survived—	in silent strength	NOW our strength lies in numbers &amp; our voices RISE
@ElieNYC @newtodagame Very well said! 		Dems sit atop the same gilded &amp; gated hill as Repbs		they look down with casual pity &amp; want everyone to be treated equally—In theory—		the urgency &amp; truth behind what we want, need &amp; demand is lost in the comfort &amp; distance of the super wealthy &amp; powerful elite
@bonacum_brett @voxdotcom Again, you responded to my real life observations to tell me how inaccurate they are		The way you’ve approached this discussion make it quite clear that if anything, the conversation about how women &amp; our concerns are treated needs to be bolder, more agressive &amp; more widespread
@bonacum_brett @voxdotcom Nobody asked for your advice, Brett		If you wanted to debate the presence &amp; impact of patriarchy in a specific portion of the movie, you should have started a thread about that—		you decided instead to tell me that my observations about real life are ‘extremely inaccurate’
@bonacum_brett @voxdotcom YOU missed the point		The article &amp; what I said are specifically about gender norms—	”masculinity &amp; rape culture” is part of the title 		it was a study focused on feminist prospectives, likely chosen because of 1:1 comparisons that can be made over time with very similar content
@bonacum_brett @voxdotcom the relevance of social norms is present within the scope of all film, art &amp; music—-they represent life as we know it		culture is continually shaped by its own &amp; outside messages of norms &amp; expectations		Social change happens when people recognize injustice and work to end it
@bonacum_brett @voxdotcom What on earth are you saying?		The article specifically assesses gender roles in the movie &amp; the messages they send		If the roles would be reversed, the messages would also change		Do you think women &amp; men are identical, expected to be and/or treated as if they are in real life?
@bonacum_brett @voxdotcom It’s silly TO YOU because you refuse to see it &amp; accept it		It’s just ONE example of the ways women are treated &amp; represented—certainly not the epitome or worst offender		It’s broken down into small pieces to help you recognize how prevalent they are and how they add up
@bonacum_brett @voxdotcom You asked for a recent example		He’s a fucking joke, but he’s not a cartoon or product of somebody’s imagination		As much as I detest him—he is the actual current US president— a relevant current example		Disagree? Ask a Trumper why he’s not included in the swamp of wealth
@bonacum_brett @voxdotcom Gender roles are only ‘irrelevant’ if you think you’re not negatively impacted		So ‘congrats’ on your choice to be born with a penis—-👏👏👏		Hint—If women weren’t subject to rape culture &amp; patriarchy we’d have the option of sexual self-expression over constant self-protection

@EnglAdvantage @McFaul @NNag23 Agreed, but I haven’t seen the “whataboutism is a distraction &amp; danger” argument change the mind of a Trump supporter—Have you? 		Today Trump was asked if the swearing-in was political as suggested by HRC	He didn’t answer the actual question at all—went full “Whatabout-Hillary”

@Americansoaring @JTHam7 @McFaul @NNag23 That’s true—	Ivanka &amp; Jared are both in active &amp; official leadership roles right now. 	No Republicans have expressed concern, why would they change their minds?
@HieronymusMcG @gorskon @AdamSerwer @MaxBoot You are right— 	2 Dems—Booker &amp; Harris	1 Republican— Tim Scott		My mistake, thank you for calling it out
@EnglAdvantage @McFaul @NNag23 Perfect example! TY So their argument will be Ivanka can do this bc Hilary was in charge of that. 		Is there a counter that will register? Is that possible for anything at all? 		I’m posing the question—Is it battle worth it or possible to fight? If so, how?
@EBOlady @utfeen @McFaul @NNag23 The title is the same—it’s not about HER—im not comparing her to ivanka on merit—I’m talking about making a real case against it TO REPS. I’m convinced it’s a bad idea. But for all the same reasons Trump is; that obviously means nothing to opposition.
@TaoJonesing @McFaul @NNag23 Totally agree—but she already IS a Presidential advisor and has taken an active role in WAY more events than she should have. We have to go deeper.
@SpinningRonnie @McFaul @NNag23 Make a better argument! I would love one! Telling me to shut up isn’t useful at all.
@utfeen @McFaul @NNag23 😂 I’m not happy about it... Samantha Power was a Advisor to Obama before UN Ambassador... same position Ivanka has		I’m only saying arguments against have to go way beyond the surface for any chance they won’t fall on deaf ears... which is unlikely anyway
@Beckymsm @McFaul Agree on Trump, but not sure it’d be beyond Dems before now. And that repbs wouldn’t say exactly about Trump what you did about Obama. 😬 Eek. 		Maybe the better angle is the idea part of Repbs dislike for HRC was bc Clinton name in politics too long...?		1 def answer= #VoteBlue!
@McFaul @NNag23 I can’t imagine there’d be a lot of Dem pushback for Chelsea in that position—or Bill; Michelle Obama as UN ambassador—I’d back 100%		Ivanka in any political role is as bad an idea as Donald—but nepotism is a weak argument, merit is equally weak or worse—Trump won bc he lacks it

@curt_inabnit @PaulMayATL @Deeliberatrix @SenFeinstein The FBI did not even talk to Dr Ford. 		‘Pressured’= they asked her to publicly acknowledge that she believed Dr Ford &amp; she did. 		She wasn’t threatened—she was *asked* and she chose to do so.		Don’t make it out to be more than it is.

@curt_inabnit @PaulMayATL @Deeliberatrix @SenFeinstein Nope. You don’t get to decide.

@curt_inabnit @PaulMayATL @Deeliberatrix @SenFeinstein They said she needs to file charges		She is *STILL* receiving death threats for speaking out—	She has been ridiculed by the president MULTIPLE TIMES	she cannot return to her home, Kavanaugh is ON the Supreme Court		And you expect her to trust the “Justice” system?

@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR Kris has been polite, straightforward, honest &amp; reasonable. She has shared her very personal &amp; moving reasons for her choice &amp; I respect her for that.		You have not, Comrade.
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR I’m just one person Comrade. No one else arguing with you on this thread. You can talk to me directly.
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR Show me.
Today’s twitter win ladies &amp; gents! 		It’s even better if you try to read it outloud to your neighbor...	to explain why you’re suddenly laughing out loud at your phone instead of screaming at it for being a foolish misogynist dirtbag... 💯😂💯 https://t.co/vGCAGcfjKJ
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR I’m not attacking you personally, I’m 	debating the merits of this approach. I can only address the points you offer.
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR I’m sorry you feel bullied. I thought we were debating the best way for our actions &amp; our votes to get the results we want and deserve; that’s been my intent all the way through.
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR You’re suggesting that after 20 years of Klan rule we’ll have the right to vote &amp; that vote will have value &amp; impact?
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR You’ve offered IF AND &amp; BUT— nothing more. https://t.co/gUCWoIXSLm
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR You aren’t standing up, you’re sitting on the sidelines crying to yourself that your team will never make the playoffs
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR Both of you acknowledged that 3rd party vote can’t win—or at least not for a very long time—while refusing to demand rank voting or eliminating the electoral college—the only way it could win. There is noting redeeming in that combination either.
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR Is it? I see what you are doing — encouraging people to throw away their votes &amp; their ability to make the changes they want to see.
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR I would be more embarrassed about sounding like a troll. You have yet to say anything except declaring your dissatisfied resignation to sit around and complain about other people’s consciences.
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR No it’s not an assumption. 	I have asked you several times how you are going to make this possible—you have no answer. I offered suggestions that you emphatically declined. Be clear about what you are doing if you are doing something. You’ve been given the opportunity.
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR Yeah you covered that already. Paired with everything else it sounds like something a Russian troll would say... be actively inactive; ensure division without change... 		Who exactly is Putin’s buddy here? 🤔
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR That’s the case regarding literally any topic. You are insisting on dramatic change but are unwilling to lay the groundwork. A lack of action has the same results as a lack of conscience.
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR Again, I’m very sorry about your grandson &amp; how his death was ignored.		If there’s no path established that enables 3rd parties to win,	they will never win.
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust I don’t think he would have either, the GrabHer tape would have eliminated him without RNC support		I totally understand feeling that way, but in practice it divides the forward-thinking voters &amp; ends up giving traditional (backward) thinking voters the upper hand 😓
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess So what solution are you actually promoting... if any?
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust I support rank choice voting too, what do suggest as a path to establishing it?
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess That’s exactly the kind of resignation that allows them to do that!		That’s the fear you talk about 		You can’t just demand a 3rd party mindset &amp; expect it to buck the system on its own		Pave the way! Even when voter support for EC is high, it’s below 50%		https://t.co/vWAmMrlVHg
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess Even if one of them could win the popular vote, the electoral college stands firmly in the way of an election win		Eliminating the EC would give the power &amp; voice back the to people &amp; pave the way for 3rd party win 		I am 100% on board w/demanding that initiative start 11/7/2018!
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust @BarackObama @vanitaguptaCR Again, that sucks. I’m extremely impressed with your dedication &amp; activism—very few are willing to take on that kind of challenge.	An entirely serious question: Have you considered running for office?
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess Running as an outsider &amp; running as 3rd Party are very different things though. Many voted for Trump reluctantly because he was the GOP option. Do you think he would have won as a 3rd party candidate?
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust I’m very sorry for your loss. The unwillingness of the police to act is  unacceptable.		I see &amp; agree that the system failed, and agree it often does—change must happen.		Is there a 3rd party you support that’s focused on the changes you want to see?
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess I agree the disgust with the corrupt status quo is what helped get Trump elected. However, he didn’t run as a 3rd party—he took over the existing Republican Party.
@SarcasmStardust @Good_Guess 😑 I’m not enjoying the place of mathematical reality I’m coming from. I’m open to other options—please outline how it’s possible &amp; you intend to make a 3rd party a winnable option.
@Wedomat @SenJeffMerkley 👏👏👏👏👏👏
@realflip44 @bustedboutique @staceyabrams Women will rise *together*		Recognizing differences is important. Fixating on them instead of uniting behind shared goals weakens the fight, weakens the fighters &amp; buries those goals in division.		Stand apart to stay apart. Stand together to fight for each other.
@Good_Guess @SarcasmStardust I wish more people were open to that. Most just aren’t—least of all voters w/traditional values. They’ll be the last to change. Simple math gives them majority vote in the meantime, emboldening that base. The approach to progress must recognize that &amp; work within it to succeed.

😂 *THIS* one I have sympathy for. 		This one IS without-a-doubt innocent and yet threatens no one with retaliation or accusations of conspiracy 		Good work ‘Good Brett K’! https://t.co/Wd3y0sTLPs
@north_villain @FoxNews @SenMikeLee I said she had no knowledge, no memory. That’s what Dr Blasey &amp; each of her witnesses said		‘pressured’ = someone *asked her* to clarify &amp; she chose to do so		She wasn’t FORCED into use as a throwaway token of self-gratification—unlike every survivor this vote attempts to silence
@Wedomat @SenJeffMerkley He was NOT on trial 	He was NOT the only option to fill this seat		Repbs say they believe her *except* her 100% certainty about who it was???		If they believe her, they should have picked someone ELSE		His job, his lifestyle, his income would remain WELL above the avg American’s
@Wedomat @SenJeffMerkley He was NOT proven to be anything but a boofffffing liar who threatened retaliation against those who honored HER Right to HER Voice		We RALLY because HER Voice was not only shutdown, it was MOCKED	HER Life was *actually* threatened		HER Life &amp; HER Voice is that of EVERY Survivor

@north_villain @FoxNews @SenMikeLee NOT ONE refuted her story—		It was a normal, typical, regular, weekday, drunken, teenage party for them—not a memorable one		Exactly as she described	Exactly as has happened to countless women	Assaulted—swiftly &amp; behind closed doors		Keyser publicly stated she BELIEVES DrBlasey
@Wedomat @SenJeffMerkley He was just made a SUPREME COURT JUSTICE! 		His life is RUINED?????		MILLIONS of American lives 	ARE RUINED by Sexual Assault and apologists like YOU 		YOU put a man’s career promotion over MILLIONS of LIVES		We PROTEST &amp; 	We RALLY against YOU https://t.co/LuilueQ8v8

@tonyposnanski Kavanaugh is absolutely the nail in the coffin that will ensure the fall of #GOP—the Gutless Old Patriarchy WILL NOT survive the 2018 nor 2020 elections.		REAL #Survivors &amp; every decent human being who stands with us WILL restore democracy.
@TheRepLawyer @pnjaban Shame on both your houses—	the White House &amp; the entire Legislative branch		The #GOP Gutless Old Patriarchy WILL FALL on November 6th
@Opulent_Bastard @TheDemocrats Absolutely correct!	They need to take REAL action and take NOTHING for granted.		Every single democrat who considers themselves a leader—or was elected as one—MUST be ON THE GROUND powerfully rallying citizens to stand for their rights and VOTE to restore Democracy.

@EMainze @grandpooba5440 @_mywitsend @StephenKing Trump mocked Franken &amp; DrBlasey in the same speech:		“Boy, did he fold up like a wet rag, huh? He was gone so fast..

@north_villain @FoxNews @SenMikeLee There’s nothing new in expecting a potential justice to respectfully respond to a credible claim.	There is precedent for that experience &amp; expectation.	Kavanaugh’s planned &amp; written statement—NOT emotional kneejerk reaction—threatened retaliation &amp; made accusations of conspiracy.

@transscribe Agreed. Chances of GOP flip remain constant at slim to none. Opportunity was mainly in informing &amp; motivating voters.
@north_villain @FoxNews @SenMikeLee 🤔 Wait—are you saying if you knew how other people reacted it would influence your assessment?		➡️ Nearly 2/3 of of sexual assaults are NOT reported	   ➡️20% feared retaliation	   ➡️15% believed police could not or would not help		🚺 #Believe bc 1-of-6 of us have been there https://t.co/m6hV2V4GpF
@transscribe Thanks for that!	Back to the orig post—	I believe they failed to take ownership of engaging w/&amp; guiding voters nationwide.	Plus failed to coordinate questioning among them in a way that’d make it most impactful &amp; drive focus on the biggest issues.
@transscribe Call it a fundraiser &amp; they can partner w/anyone 🙄		Please share reporting/video of the rallies you refer to—that may give me hope		I am afraid dems are missing a huge opportunity to empower, motivate &amp; unite supporters	Everything about this is unique &amp; demands a novel approach
@transscribe What’s to stop them from partnering with an outside organizer? 	If they promoted it &amp; showed up in front of a large &amp; passionate crowd— exclusively &amp; clearly for a single purpose—that would send a bold &amp; undeniable message to all Americans, Senators &amp; Republicans.
@transscribe Approaching a crowd that gathered on their own, again, is not leadership—it’s convenient. 		What calls to action have they provided to voters? 	What have they told us we can do?		I’ve signed “petitions” that seem only to be email collections. 🤦🏻‍♀️	I see them ask for more money. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@transscribe Walking in their own office building &amp; being approached by voters—who took it upon themselves to be there—is NOT outreach or leadership. 		Thats responsive, NOT proactive.		Rallies &amp; protests are outside, loud &amp; impossible to miss—they inspire &amp; encourage people to take action.
@transscribe Please show me the protests they lead. Please show me the action &amp; direction they offered voters.		I watched every minute.	I was in the Hart Building during DrBlasey &amp; Kavanaugh’s testimony. 	I saw dozens of women get arrested. No democrat elected official was there. Not one.
RT @thehill: GOP senator's hometown paper rips him for "medieval attitude toward all women" https://t.co/3p6ffECKaE https://t.co/0DGbK3SWsZ
@transscribe From Day 1 they could’ve acted as a team of leaders—		rotating min # in the room,	rest outside—speaking to voters &amp; press, rallying a crowd &amp; creating ONE loud &amp; powerful message from an activated people		They played by Grassley‘s rules while we watched helplessly from sidelines
@voxdotcom Interesting to see the entire office universally react by muttering a collective ‘ugh’ + 🤦🏻‍♀️ 🤦🏼‍♂️ 🤦🏽‍♀️ 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🤦🏿‍♀️
@catsatira @emrazz Girls are watching us.	Girls see how their mothers live, how they’re treated, how they could be happier &amp; should be heard.		Many women actively protesting now came from families like that—I’m among them.		Keep pushing forward—	The more light we shine,	more people are drawn to it.
RT @thehill: American Bar Association re-opening Kavanaugh evaluation due to "temperament" https://t.co/D7QKoLxlnG https://t.co/V2xqcB0y7z
@emrazz Yes! TY!		Her vote carries the exact legal weight as each of theirs		THEY didn’t even *consider* voting	NO &amp; I haven’t seen a single call for voters to demand they do		Just because we expect these men to let us down doesn’t mean we should excuse it—-it’s the exact opposite
RT @emrazz: The irony is that 46 male senators voted to confirm Kavanaugh but that was expected so Collins will be the one to burn.
