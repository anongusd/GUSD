@JMilesColeman @Polit_eurOpines Yup. Maybe there's an argument to be made that term limits there have made the rural D seats go R faster than elsewhere? There are lots of seats in other states that Ds have no business holding but they do because of local popularity, which gets wiped out when turnover occurs.

@SenhorRaposa “Regardless of what happens this election cycle, the judges said they won’t allow future elections to be held using these maps, which they deemed unconstitutional.”
@SenhorRaposa So even if they don’t get changed for the 2018 cycle, 2020 will assuredly have new maps?

@ChazNuttycombe There are some really awful people in any group, I chose to become a DSA member because I think their vision of America aligns with mine. But I certainly don’t think all the members are perfect or even fighting for the right chance.
I encourage my fellow members of the @DemSocialists who are not paying their respects to a fallen hero to understand that love for this country and love for your positions are not mutually exclusive and work to change people's minds about their policies rather than berate JM. https://t.co/vy24YWsaod
@Hasneeeee @DemocraticLuntz @ChazNuttycombe Don’t know why the feel the need or have the reasoning for that statement. You can disagree with someone and think they don’t share your vision or how to build a better America without shunning them as they pass away.

@DemocraticLuntz @ChazNuttycombe I think there are a lot, a majority of 🌹 folks that have a heart and understand that you can disagree with JM and still see him as a veteran, hero, and patriot. He loved America just as much as we do, he just had a different vision and a way of achieving that vision than we do.
@ChazNuttycombe This DSAer will make it known that not all DSA folks are reacting poorly to this. I disagreed almost always with John McCain but he was more of a hero than I’ll ever be and gave more to this country than I’ll ever give.

@BruneElections I’m not an #ElectionTwitter expert, but IMHO they should be considered pickups, PA-18 is right now a Dem seat and if it’s most natural successor, PA-14, goes red, it’s a pickup, and vice versa with PA-5. PA-5, at the time PA-7 right?, voted red so it going blue is a flip IMO.

-You are voting for the first time in Massachusetts in a federal election;	-You are an inactive voter;	-You are casting a provisional or challenged ballot;	-The poll worker has a reasonable suspicion that leads them to request identification.
6) While you typically do not need an I.D. to vote in Massachusetts, you can be asked to display identification for the following reasons:
5) If you are already registered to vote, you DO NOT need to re-register specifically for the primary election.
3) If you are unenrolled, you may vote in any primary.		4) If you are registered in one party and would like to switch to unenrolled or another party so you can vote in that party's primary, fill out a new online voter application using the same link as from item 1.
2) To vote in a party primary, you must either be enrolled in that party OR be unenrolled in any party. For example, to vote in a Dem primary, you must be a registered Democrat OR be unenrolled and then you ask your polling place staffer for a Democratic ballot.
1) You MUST be registered by August 15 to vote in a primary election. You can do so here: https://t.co/5t7xF7LfMT

We can't make canvassing even harder by letting subconscious racism affect how we treat canvassers of color. Canvassing isn't fun, but it is a critical element of any successful campaign. And we can't make it an all-white sport, as politics too often is. https://t.co/G84cxfgdLO

@lnsiebert @SenhorRaposa 2014 for seth*
@lnsiebert @SenhorRaposa Seth mouton has a much larger national profile and the district is slightly more dem so he should be almost always fine. But he had a decently tough time of it in 2012. There are definitely gop years in ma, ask charlie baker and Scott brown.
@lnsiebert @SenhorRaposa Yes, but MA-9 is the least safe and definitely flippable during a GOP wave.
@SenhorRaposa I live in MA-9, lots of conservative pockets but overall it was drawn to have a Democrat. Dems in the redistricting probably showed the most restraint here, they could’ve drawn a completely safe MA-9 but instead drew a dem favored district. It was close in 2010, the gop wave year
