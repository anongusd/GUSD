There are other things, too. Like playing an instrument and learning a second language. Also, living in different parts of the country, too.		To have empathy one must have experience, or, it helps.

@physicsgeek Well, it's absurd. Right now, the anti-women forces are winning, though.
And the testosterone fueled boys competing as girls could never compete on an even playing field.		They would lose against people with their biology and DNA. So they run as women. 		And our P.C. culture looks away and deprives girls of opportunities for the sake of it.
Transgenderism reduces womanhood to make-up and long hair--a cliché. 		And lots of feminists are okay with it because they hate women, too. Specifically, they hate the unique ability to bear children.

Or don't vote. I don't really care.		Everyone is free to vote their conscience.		What I don't appreciate is the sanctimony and then turning around and voting for people who straight up are antithetical to everything you profess to believe in because reasons.
Also, I found the Evan McMullin thing laughable and still do.		He struck me as a weirdo creep (still does, something is wrong with him.) Why would he be a viable alternative esp since he had no chance?		Just man up and vote for Clinton. Gimme a break.
Maybe it helps to understand my POV to know that I distrust all politicians. I think they're human w weaknesses.		I'm not looking for a savior. I'm looking for someone to represent my interests as closely as possible.		I wasn't sure Trump would. I was damn sure Clinton wouldn't.
@JesseKellyDC Was it good? I'm going with the kids this weekend.
@ThatElJefe @AG_Conservative I actually agree with Tom which is why I don't understand why he's so intent on undoing the vote via institutional means.		And the Dems are better? No. No, they're not. Obama was like a sainted King and the GOP Congress sat there.
@ThatElJefe @AG_Conservative Yep. And the voter's will matters, too. Suck it up.		Listen, I wanted Ted Cruz or even Marco Rubio, but the voters voted.		They should get the consequences of their votes good and hard.		They did w/Obama and he was a disaster. Why is Trump different? Because, ew.

And it's been rich being lectured by people about how amoral I am.		Give me a break. Romney went back and forth on abortion and that sickens me more than some nasty thing Trump said.		Why is it so hard to get that?

@baseballcrank Oh I don't know, Dan. The first six months were spent falling all over themselves about whether they're happy Trump won or not. 		The next six fumbling legislative priorities.
Republicans can't even be clever. Obamacare repeal should have been tee'd up. Do some modest fixes. Incrementalism. But no.		Lots of flouncing around for the cameras.
Republicans had two years to do something worthwhile and they mostly blew it because they didn't want to give Trump a win and are like headless chickens in charge. They didn't expect to win, enjoyed being losers because it spared them responsibility, and fiddled.		Ugh.
Trump is president. He's not above criticism but this incessant navel gazing is so incredibly worthless.		When you're a Freshman Senator keep your yap zipped and work to get some legislation passed. https://t.co/pXKslaABKl

@_Drew_McCoy_ Maybe. I would make a picture of a Maserati with the elites in it on one side and a Chevy suburban with the rest of America on the other side and America in the middle.

@_Drew_McCoy_ That *IS* you right now.
@charnetzki3 That's right and that's why no one wants to have this conversation with the American people. It's unsellable.
@_Drew_McCoy_ Be careful...you're going to overdose.
@trscoop thanks
Good video on reasoning to stay in Syria. https://t.co/ZsRcu15g2E

This is clearly stated.		This case has never been made to the American people. https://t.co/rfC5JHINLN
The American people are closer to being of a mind to pull troops back from everywhere--out of Asia, Europe, Middle East.		This would be bad, but when all these countries show contempt for the U.S. and American taxpayers foot the bill, the reaction can be, "Fine, you fix it."

I still haven't seen a solid case for why we're in Syria.		It should have been made in a clear way. Any value I've seen has boiled down to this:		1. A check on Iran/Russia power.	2. Moderate Turkey's actions towards the Kurds.		And I'm probably wrong about these two things.
@Major_Skidmark Did we? I don't remember that case being made to the American people.
@Neoavatara Btw, because he's of the narcissism, that's why I don't buy the racism. He thinks everyone is stupid.
Here's the thing, though.		I still don't understand the strategic value of being in Syria 1/2 way. It's just a mess.		This was my position through the Obama admin, too. It's a difficult thing, that engagement, and I don't get it.
@Neoavatara He's a classic narcissist.

@Cristotokos @GaltsGirl That's true.
Also, I adopted my cat. He's a full-bred Ragdoll. The rescue place had multiple gorgeous hoity-toity breeds that people had given up or left behind or lost.		Knowing what I know now, I would never buy a cat.
I've always had dogs and I like them.		I'm surprised by how much I like this cat. He's fantastic.
