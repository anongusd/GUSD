@DawgsByNature You win Twitter for the day. Congrats!
RT @JeffDLowe: Just a little throwback to Mel Kiper and #Browns fans at the NFL Draft not liking the Baker Mayfield pick. Thank goodness we…
@SWTheory66 Congrats brother.  Appreciate all you do 👍🏻
@JackDuffin Thanks Jack 👍🏻

@ChuckGobrowns @dawgpounddaily @chrismarkoch68 P.s. Go Browns
@ChuckGobrowns @dawgpounddaily @chrismarkoch68 Ahhh I see.  Thanks Chuck 👍🏻.  Yet, changes nothing at all honestly. Two words are import here....”Winning Culture”. You can’t create that by making Mayfield a healthy scratch due to fear.  It’s just plain silly.  Never let fear rule your life, or your organization.
@dawgpounddaily @chrismarkoch68 This question is straight up blasphemy.  Can’t even believe it’s being asked. For 2019, Baker’s continued development, team momentum, and positive finish greatly out weighs a higher draft pick. To whomever even asked this, where have you been for the last 19 years???
@PFF_Browns @PFF @Browns Your work doesn’t go unnoticed. Thank you guys for all you do 👍🏻.
@illstr8r I’m in utter shock that this thought has even crossed a Browns fans mind....	Great post Eric.  Agreed
@ddkjr26 Happy Birthday DK!   Love that you’re a Brown. Thank you! 	And Go Browns 🎊🎉🎁

Hey @TheWalkingDead. You totally nailed the first Whisperers scene 100%.  Love it! Well done a great job 👍🏻
@Jol_E_Roger @slurmed Awesome lol
@RandallTime That first step is insane.  Not to mention the anticipation in comparison to the others on the DL
@ValleyJoe_ @NathanZegura @KenCarman @BeauBishop Congrats Joe, you have won twitter for the day.
@PumpkinNation Done. Schobert, Randall, Chubb, Zeitler, Bitonio, Garrett, Colquitt, Ward should all be a lock.    Love to see Baker, and Ogunjobi make it in.
@RichEisenShow @bakermayfield @richeisen Love your take on it Rich! 👍🏻 We don’t know what happened over time in the everyday organization. These guys would have a better argument if Baker snubbed him and walked away. Instead he shook his hand like a man. Don’t ask him to be phoney. Great job Baker. Behind you 100%.
@LedyardNFLDraft Beautiful.  Thank you!
@BaldyNFL @Browns @NickChubb21 Need more #BaldysBreakdowns in my life.  Go Browns.   Thanks Double B! 😊

@NathanZegura @TheRealTRizzo unfollowed for pathetic, and clearly ignorant comments like that because he clearly doesn’t listen to the show daily.  Wonder if it’s jealously? Know what you’re talking about before you just throw out random, unwarranted opinions little man.
@NathanZegura @Browns Rizzo is clearly a joke, and ignorant.  He clearly doesn’t pay attention or listen daily but feels he can comment like he knows what he’s talking about.
@joehaden23 Still love you buddy.  Thanks for everything you gave to CLE. We learn as we age. Thanks again 👍🏻 Go Browns
