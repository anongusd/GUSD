Patients deserve health insurance that is affordable, accessible, adequate and understandable. That’s everything short-term plans are not.
The very population the law is designed to protect could again face barriers to quality health coverage at a cost they can afford - a common occurrence before the law was passed that kept many patients from getting critical care.
Those who need comprehensive coverage will be forced to pay drastically higher premiums or go without insurance.
The rule effectively allows short-term limited-duration (STLD) plans to serve as replacements for comprehensive coverage in violation of current law. Allowing these plans to exist in contradiction to their intended use as stated in their name – ‘short-term.’
#ICYMI: The evidence is clear that individuals who are uninsured and underinsured are diagnosed later and face poorer outcomes. That's why we're urging the federal court to issue a preliminary injunction against the short-term inusrance rule https://t.co/TqMfbTR2Qw

Quality insurance coverage improves patient outcomes and allows Americans to stay healthy and remain financially secure. The vulnerable communities we represent simply cannot afford to lose access to health insurance that protects their livelihood and wellbeing.
Recent data indicates that the number of Americans who are uninsured is on the rise again for the first time since 2008. At the end of 2017, 12.2 percent of U.S. adults lacked health insurance—up from 10.9 percent at the end of 2016, an increase of 3.2 million people.
Congressional leaders must include provisions to stabilize the health insurance market in the March 23rd omnibus government funding bill to prevent millions of Americans from losing health insurance coverage.
Today, @American_Heart joined 19 other patient/consumer groups in issuing a joint statement urging Congress to include legislation in the forthcoming omnibus spending bill to steady the health insurance market
&lt;THREAD&gt; #UPDATE: Both parties in Congress have pledged to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but recent regulatory actions taken by the Trump administration to expand association and short-term health plans could undermine existing protections. https://t.co/yn3fQucrQr https://t.co/vQBTDBGEgI

Heart disease &amp; stroke are the among our nation’s most costly &amp; common killers. Passage of these 3 legislative provisions in the Medicare extenders legislation would go a long way to provide crucial treatments for Americans struggling with CVD &lt;END THREAD&gt;

Secondly, #Congress can aid Americans who struggle with stroke by passing the #FASTAct in the extenders legislation. This bill would require Medicare to reimburse for telestroke services, regardless of where a patient lives.

RT @CSPI: A6.3: RT if you agree: @USDA @WhiteHouse @SecretarySonny should NOT roll back school nutrition standards. Keep our kids healthy.…
A6: Together, we should raise our voices in support of every child having access to nutritious school meals: https://t.co/irlz3jpfw4 #FoodFri https://t.co/6GLcTIxSXp
A6: 31 million children eat school lunches, and nearly 15 million get school breakfasts on an average day – we need to make sure we step up and ensure they have a healthy school meal #FoodFri https://t.co/lPlQ78Rcub https://t.co/6GLcTIxSXp
So true @healthyschools! What we serve children in school are the building blocks for lifetime eating habits. What message are we sending them if we provide high calorie, unhealthy options? #FoodFri https://t.co/UBr2gsnxf5
A5: Allowing 1 percent flavored milk is inconsistent with current dietary advice and school needs #FoodFri https://t.co/Fkj6UG8tNf https://t.co/wOvlVWW4YI
A4: This new rule from the @USDA promises “flexibility,” but the truth is it would stop the great progress we’ve made to help kids attain long-term health and academic success #FoodFri https://t.co/UqEaBh6M6U
Q4: With the updated standards, the number of elementary schools offering fresh fruit and whole grains has increased by nearly 20% since 2006. #FoodFri https://t.co/G8cqe1ISUW https://t.co/UqEaBh6M6U
@tischfoodcenter @dianalimongi @NYCSchools Even something as simple as changing the lunch time has been proven to reduce food waste. We've already come so far, we can't afford to rollback progress with this proposed rule #FoodFri
Amazing point @Praxis_Project! These decisions about children's nutrition can have long lasting effects that can even carry into adulthood #FoodFri https://t.co/EuEf8GlBKO
Q3: Whole grains are an important part of children’s well-rounded meals, as studies show children who receive healthier school meal options actually perform better on tests #FoodFri https://t.co/Rv1DIFPXPd https://t.co/J7odSjJtse
@tischfoodcenter That's incredible! And a great example of the wide spread impact these healthy food initiatives can have on the community. #FoodFri

So true @CSPI. Kids get 30% of their daily sodium at lunch - our kids need us to ensure that these meals are healthy and nutritious. @MomsRising #FoodFri https://t.co/uOTRtnCOfR
A1: By 2025, it’s estimated that healthy nutrition standards for all foods sold in schools will decrease the number of childhood obesity cases by more than 2 million – our kids deserve healthy sodium options #FoodFri @MomsRising @cspi https://t.co/TI3fcztmqv https://t.co/yZwmlqUK9Y
@MomsRising High sodium not only affects heart health – it can also increase the risk for stroke, kidney disease, stomach cancer and osteoporosis #FoodFri
@MomsRising It means we're putting our children's long-term health at risk. Children who eat high levels of sodium are about 35% more likely to have elevated blood pressure as children who eat lower sodium diets. #FoodFri

Although there are no perfect solutions to this problem, we call on Congress to swiftly consider both short- and long-term ways to lower costs for consumers and to stabilize insurance markets.
We have raised the alarm about the consequences of repealing the individual mandate for patients and their families, but our warnings have been ignored.
Today's actions will cause premiums to rise by 10 percent per year, on average, for some of the most vulnerable citizens and lead to million more Americans without insurance.

@American_Heart @NancyatHeart Strike three: Unless Congress acts soon to waive them, this legislation will result in huge federally-mandated cuts. Medicare support could be slashed by $25 billion, and the Prevention Fund could cease to exist.
@American_Heart @NancyatHeart Strike two: Under this legislation, more than 30 million taxpayers will not be able to claim the charitable deduction. As a result, it's estimated donations to charities could drop by $12 to $20 billion annually.
@American_Heart @NancyatHeart Strike one: The section of the bill that would dismantle the health insurance mandate of the #AffordableCareAct. If this requirement disappears, so will the the health care coverage of many Americans.

We firmly believe #HR5003 wld roll back yrs of progress on school nutrition &amp; its provisions could intensify the childhood obesity epidemic
Again, thx 2 all MOCs who spoke yesterday about #ChildNutrition &amp; the dangers of #HR5003. Children deserve a chance to be healthy &amp; vibrant!
Currently, said @RepDeSaulnier, the US spends $14bil on the health costs of childhood obesity. W/O access 2 healthy foods, this # could rise
.@RepDeSaulnier pointed out that decreasing access to healthy foods could further increase the health costs of obesity-related illnesses
.@RepMcGovern expressed outrage @ #HR5003 calling it a "terrible terrible terrible bill" that "attempts to undermine child nutrition prgms."
.@RepMcGovern:"A nutritious school meal is just as impt 2 a child's success...as a textbook. Hungry children cannot lerarn. That is a fact."
.@RepBarbaraLee: "Child hunger &amp; lack of nutritious food is a prblm that affects..every ZIP code Every MOC has constituents who are hungry."
.@RepBarbaraLee,"When we take away access 2 these meals we jeopardize children's health &amp; their future. School meals really are a lifeline."
Thankfully, said @RepBarbaraLee, there was help. "I don’t know what I would have done if my children did not have access to school lunches."
.@RepBarbaraLee also spoke about her own experience w/ school meals, calling the issue a "bridge over troubled water" 4 her family. #CNR2016
"It would turn the clock back on years of progress and prevent children from eating healthy meals every day," @RepBarbaraLee  added #CNR2016
.@RepBarbaraLee said #HR5003 would "roll back critical evidence-based nutrition standards made in the 2010 child nutrition bill." #CNR2016
On the floor, @RepMarciaFudge said, "Our children's health and education are not budget-saving gimmicks." We AGREE! https://t.co/G57QRc34yn
Each Rep. made compelling points about the disastrous #HR5003. A common theme? That it would roll back years of nutrition progress. #CNR2016
