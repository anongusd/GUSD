@Frankie__2 If she finally said yes no harm was done? If a woman cannot make logical decisions that is her fault. Usually the girl you are referring to will get mad if you stop trying because her saying no does not actually mean no.
Okay I am tired of #Metoo. I believe a lot of these men are innocent. Flirting is not harassing. And no does not always mean no. No is quite often used in a playful manner or as a hard to get method. We are seeing a witch hunt in Hollywood. Men are immediately punished if accused
Anyone who defended @BillClinton cannot go after @realDonaldTrump. They Clinton situation threatened our national security. The Trump situation was wrong. He should not have cheated. However if the payment was made with his own money he did not break a law in any way. #TrumpTapes
@AynRandPaulRyan Actually if the payment was made with his personal money no laws were broken. Silly libtard.

@uarcee_2000 @FoxNews Taking a knee for our national anthem is disrespectful to the country as a whole. Not to one person or type of person. Yes, you do have a right to free speech. Why use that right to disrespect the country that is giving it to you in the first place? It is counter productive.
