THREAD Fact-checking another key stat the Trump administration is using to back up its case that there is a "crisis" at the southern border üëá https://t.co/E049tLnxkn
The context is important on this because while the Trump administration has thrown around a lot of figures in making its case about a "crisis" on the southern border, this is one of the only ones -- if not the only one -- that is based on what has been happening in RECENT months
For example: From October to December 2016, the total number of individuals apprehended or deemed inadmissible at the southern border surged to an average 62,000 per month. But by February 2017, that number was back down to 23,557.
Border apprehensions DID increase in those months, but they didn't surge in an unprecedented fashion.		Even if you lump in the number of individuals denied admission at ports of entry, we've seen comparable increases - &amp; subsequent decreases - in previous years.
Same goes for the 60,722 figure for October. It includes 9,771 who were denied admission at legal US ports of entry.		And these are the numbers the Trump administration is presenting to make its case that there are "crisis" level surges of illegal immigration at the border
That's because he's lumping in people who presented themselves at ports of entry.		Of the 62,456 individuals apprehended or deemed inadmissible at the southern border in Nov, 10,600 of those presented themselves at legal US ports of entry and were ultimately denied admission.
In each of his 3 interviews this am, @VP led his argument that there is a crisis on the Southern border with one figure: 60,000.	"60,000 people are now attempting to come into our country illegally every month," he said.	But Pence's use of the statistic is misleading at best.

Trump cancels his meeting with Putin. About an hour ago, he said of the same meeting: "I think it's a very good time to have a meeting." https://t.co/APOMYfpatT
Trump on why he kept Michael Cohen as a lawyer &amp; adviser for so many years: "Because a long time ago he did me a favor."
Trump on Manafort: "It's very sad what's happened to Paul, the way he's been treated."
Trump on not meeting MBS: "I would've met with him, but we didn't set that one up."
Trump on Putin: "I think it's a very good time to have a meeting."
Trump on China deal "I think we're very close to doing something with China. But I don't know that I want to do it." Points to $ millions coming into US via tariffs. Those are costs that US consumers will bear of course.
So Trump is claiming that Michael Cohen is lying. But he's also insisting everyone knew about the discussions for the Trump Tower Moscow deal at the time...
Trump: "We had a position to possibly do a deal, to build a building of some kind in Moscow. I decided not to do it. The primary reason...I was focused on running for President. There would be nothing wrong if I did do it. I was running my business while I was campaigning."
Trump: "He's a weak person and by being weak unlike other people that you watch -- he's a weak person and what he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence...He's lying about a project that everybody knew about."
Trump on Michael Cohen's new claims about the Trump Tower Moscow discussions: "It lasted a short period of time. I didn't do the project. I decided not to do it."
And @fscutz, former senior adviser to H.R. McMaster, called the Trump-Putin meeting Putin's "best chance" to sway Trump.	"Even silence on that topic would be a huge win for Putin. Anything short of the President coming out and condemning his actions in Ukraine to his face..."
.@RNicholasBurns predicted: "Once again the United States is going to be in a position of looking weak, of not acting strongly in opposition to what the Russians are doing."

Trump advisers acknowledge losing the House is likely, and acknowledge Trump's efforts have focused on holding and perhaps expanding the Senate, which they believe is now likely thanks to Trump's efforts.
BUT -- lots of R strategists of course disagree here &amp; believe Trump has hurt Republican chances of holding the House by exacerbating the gender gap &amp; ostracizing voters in those key suburban districts that could swing control of the House.
One senior WH official told me Trump was enthusiastic as he flew back to Washington after holding 3 rallies on Monday, believing he's "left everything on the field."
Several Trump advisers credited Trump's midterm rally blitz, his stalwart support for Kavanaugh &amp; his heated immigration rhetoric with boosting Republican enthusiasm and ultimately, they hope, turnout.
"Unless something changes we‚Äôre going to see historic turnout for midterms on both sides. We‚Äôve completed eliminated the enthusiasm deficit," one Republican strategist close to the White House told me.
The case Trumpworld is making today: Trump has helped more than he's hurt, crediting the President with narrowing the enthusiasm gap in particular.	Rs have faced as high as a double-digit deficit in the enthusiasm gap, which is now down to 4 points in the latest CNN poll.

And then Trump goes after the media: "The media also has a responsibility...to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories. Have to do it. They've got to stop."
"There is one way to settle our disagreements, it's called peacefully, at the ballot box."
"No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains, which is done often, it's done all the time. We've got to stop. We should not mob people in public spaces or destroy public property.

It all comes back to Trump's ability to connect &amp; his skilled branding: https://t.co/FbEbmDLVbR https://t.co/IYIdTteIZz
During 2016 campaign, I was always struck by how Trump supporters spoke about issues in nearly the exact same way as Trump, mirroring his language, framing &amp; rationale.	Trump is now putting that to work in 2018 for Republicans as he activates his base: https://t.co/VJc491NsnA

Trump weighs in on Kavanaugh confirmation: https://t.co/GlvGLqeV78
Manchin announces he will also vote yes. Kavanaugh now expected to be confirmed with 51 votes.
Collins: "I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh"
Collins: "My fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5-4 decisions."
Collins so far has said she believes all of these things:	1) That Prof. Ford is a survivor of sexual assault	2) But that Ford's allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her did not "meet the more likely than not standard"	3) That leaking Ford's letter was "unconscionable"
Collins, after indicating she won't oppose Kavanaugh over sexual assault allegation because it doesn't meet the "more likely than not" standard: "The Me Too movement is real. It matters."
Here it is: ‚ÄúI do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court." https://t.co/3boEnSYqit
Collins on Ford's allegations of sexual assault: "The allegations fail to meet the more likely than not standard"
Collins: "I listened carefully to Christine Blasey Ford's testimony...I believe that she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life. Nevertheless the four people that she named could not corroborate anything..."
Collins: "We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy. The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent function when the accusation departs from a nominee's otherwise exemplary record."
Collins: "The presumption of innocence and fairness do bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them."
Collins: "I have always opposed litmus tests for judicial nominees with respect to their personal views or politics, but I fully expect them to be able to put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the cases that come before them."
Collins: "Our Supreme Court confirmation process has been in steady decline for more than 30 years. One can only hope that the Kavanaugh nomination is where the process has finally hit rock bottom."
Sen. Susan Collins: "Today we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of a gutter-level political campaign than a solemn occasion."

And now Murkowski says she‚Äôs on board with Flake plan. Looks like WH will have to direct FBI to investigate Kavanaugh allegations for a week

Flake says he'll advance Kavanaugh nomination to the floor, but with an agreement that this FBI investigation will happen: https://t.co/XFHaCsVUmK
Flake: "I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote to up to but not more than 1 week in order to allow the FBI to continue do an investigation limited in time &amp; scope to the allegations that are there."

Sanders didn't respond to emails about what article she was referring to. But in 2005, Pres. G.W. Bush &amp; 9/11 commission claimed a 1998 Washington Times article was responsible. The article ONLY mentioned that bin Laden used a satellite phone -- something widely known at the time
Sanders today said "1 of the worst cases" of the media reporting on classified information &amp; damaging national security was reporting in the late 90s on the US govt's ability to monitor bin Laden's phone. "Because of that reporting, he stopped using that phone," Sanders said.
About @PressSec's claim that news reports in the late '90s thwarted US monitoring of Osama bin Laden's phone...The claim is false. And it has been repeatedly debunked.
.@PressSec: "The President is not obstructing, he's fighting back."
Rudy Giuliani statement re: Trump's tweet saying Sessions should end the Mueller probe: "We have been saying for months that it is time to bring this inquiry to an end. The President has expressed the same opinion."

Trump: "I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal." Says US will reinstitute sanctions against Iran
Trump: "I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement." Says US has engaged extensively with allies...
Trump: "The deal does nothing to constrain Iran's destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism." Says Iran has grown only more brazen in those actions
Trump: "The deal's sunset provisions are totally unacceptable. If I allow this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East."
Trump: "At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction, that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program." Except that the very belief Iran's nuclear program was not peaceful is the reason why P5+1 pursued deal w/ inspections
