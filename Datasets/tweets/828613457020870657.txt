In the last 10 years, homelessness has declined by 100,000 people, but it is a tragedy that in a nation as prosperous as ours anyone is forced to sleep on the streets. Christ House here in D.C. is working to make sure those without a home are receiving the care they need. https://t.co/3J0lwoOX5k

The budget lays out a vision for a gov't that is efficient, effective, and accountable. It provides for a strong nat'l defense, lays the groundwork for further economic growth through reduced regulations and taxes, and recognizes the importance of addressing our fiscal challenges
The proposed budget is focused on moving more people toward self-sufficiency through reforming rental assistance programs and moving aging public housing to more sustainable platforms.
The proposed budget seeks stable or increased funding for direct rental subsidies to the elderly and disabled, as well as to homeless assistance and lead hazard control, in less targeted programs, local gov'ts are best positioned to address specific needs in their communities.
The President’s 2019 Budget represents a commitment to fiscal restraint, with a modest one percent increase in discretionary funding over last year’s request.
The Trump Administration’s 2019 Budget proposal for @HUDGov continues and expands support for vulnerable populations including those experiencing homelessness, the elderly and persons living with disabilities.
.@POTUS showed true leadership on today's budget deal ensuring our military is fully funded, veterans and their families are taken care of, and those fighting opioid addiction get access to the help they need.
