"I have a home in Charlottesville. A lot of people don't know." -Trump, obviously.
Trump says he openly called for unity and love. "You know where my heart is."
Trump: They don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence
Then Trump slams the "very dishonest media" and, on cue, the crowd turns and jeers.
"What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America," Trump says. Denounces the "thugs" that perpetrate hatred and violence
"We are all on the same team. We are all Americans," Trump says.
Trump is re-upping some of the language from his speech last night - "when one part of America hurts, we all hurt."
"He's talking about you! YOU, WOMAN!" a man screams and points at me, while Trump implores the cameras to show the crowds.
People are still filing into the venue to see Trump, but the room is not yet full.
