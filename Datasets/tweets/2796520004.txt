@TuhLiv @TravisNextLevel @markofbattersea @CNN And will it probably get worse before it gets better?  Unfortunately, yes - history provides a pretty strong indication that it will.  Change is hard but inevitable and taking steps in the right direction will get you there faster than standing still.	Just do it!
@TuhLiv @TravisNextLevel @markofbattersea @CNN Right.  Change in laws produces change.  By the end of the assault weapons ban's 10 year run, the guns being confiscated were less lethal with lower ammo capacity because of availability.  So will the change happen tomorrow?  No, but it will happen.
@TravisNextLevel @markofbattersea @CNN Guns.  Duh.		The shooting was illegal how?	The stray bullet was shot from a what?  A gun.  Right.  Focus travis.  Guns are part of the problem so let's make gun control part of the solution - they're not an effect, they're a cause.

#WeChooseBoth 	Pro-life vs pro-choice?	WE choose both-to ensure the parents (both if available) know their options and the consequences of all their choices and to support the potential  new family with guidance, care and assistance while teaching self-sufficiency.	#WeChooseBoth
@HillaryClinton Very relevant and insightful.  I appreciate the discussion taking place and only hope it can also extend to the bullying that is also an issue.  Women are still learning how to be a part of this world...and that is a sad commentary on humanity.  Till then...

@PennyPerilous @Mikel_Jollett @Mindcryme @Kindred29 His actions are not punishable by law - not criminal.  You are reaching.
@PennyPerilous @Mikel_Jollett @Mindcryme @Kindred29 And from inside.
@NoteFromSELF @Mikel_Jollett @realDonaldTrump He is not discounting their feelings or calling them liars. Would it be better if he attacked them?  What is the right way to deal with This?  Perhaps that is the next step.
@hdot42 @dismont_lisa @Mikel_Jollett @samo_rocky This.		It's not that he didn't do anything wrong - it's that he didn't do anything criminal.  An apology is warranted.  Period.
@Mikel_Jollett @Mindcryme @Kindred29 This is an opportunity to inform not to reject.  It's a chance to show regret for past rudeness and teach the next generation to be better.  But pushing him out is wrong.

@clairecmc No.  Inappropriate behavior vs criminal sexual misconduct.  An apology is warranted and offered.  If the ethics committee can show continued aggressive disrespect as a pattern in his congressional tenure - then you might have a point.  But you have the opposite. Just no.
@SenBobCasey Criminal sexual misconduct vs inappropriate behavior.  Take it to court - then revisit your opinion. Apologies are warranted and offered.  Nothing more.
@TomPerez No.  To compare inappropriate behavior to criminal sexual misconduct is asinine.  His actions merit apology and he's graciously offered them. 	If you want a tit-for-tat party, then start harping on the actual criminals in Congress...ones who have broken laws not hearts.
@SenKamalaHarris No.  Intention matters.  These women deserve an apology for being made to feel less than, but there is nothing criminal in his actions and nothing predatory in his behaviors.  Just no.

@Code3000 @AdamSchiffCA @Derekle30414249 And I worked for EF Hutton back in the day - dad was a broker too.  This is unsustainable and will crash bigly.  Trump has a proven record of being wrong and this tax plan is too.
@NBCNews Sounds like someone else I know...
@KatrinaPierson And...might want to work on your number skills.  Trumps poll was on the same page and NO - all 3 were not lower.  And his DISapproval rating? Well...you know.	And it's an online poll of less than a thousand people so...duh.

@bagan_jujubeans @Code3000 @AdamSchiffCA @Derekle30414249 We used to laugh at a broker with "DOW3000" on his licence plate - that was in 1990.  He was young and new.  This crash will be a mighty equalizer...
@ClintHampton @babs_to_you @hohlfeld_james @gcg72785 @VivRockMasney @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro She just said "yeah, that's what I thought"...	Keep doing your thing Clint!	 Happy holidays!!

@rach_brunt7 @gcg72785 @babs_to_you @VivRockMasney @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro Right?!?  I grew up in a new church...	dad's still a member back home.  Still has only about 300 members but thrives on good fellowship and community service.  I now live in a town of 347-to say my church is small, well...	But there must be a threshold to be part of society too.

@rach_brunt7 @gcg72785 @babs_to_you @VivRockMasney @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro Actually no.  They wouldn't necessarily. Especially if there was a flat church exemption - say $500k.  Anything under is not taxed...and the mega Churches, well...

@VivRockMasney @babs_to_you @moknows5150 @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro Churches are a different beast.  You are comparing apples to oranges. https://t.co/dWHneOcS2m
@VivRockMasney @babs_to_you @moknows5150 @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro And they are.  Churches have been non-taxed for all time, before the IRS even.  Non profits have to prove themselves as such and be open and ready for audit.  Churches do not. Churches do not file non-profit tax forms.

@Dante3355 @coton_luver @Rosie @alfranken @SenFranken Because she said she was horrified.  He reacted to her "feelings".  He didn't discount them - he didn't make excuses. He apologized and asked for an ethics investigation.  He knows what they'll find.

@babs_to_you @irvingmuller @VivRockMasney @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro No, no.  They pay sales tax to their city, if it exists and payroll taxes - but the business profits are church income and not taxed.
@babs_to_you @JanicePriest @gcg72785 @VivRockMasney @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro No...it's awareness.
@babs_to_you @irvingmuller @VivRockMasney @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro Perhaps like the business they are - with the allowable write offs as every other business enjoys.  What do you suppose most small congregation would actually pay? Let's say we give them a $500,000 exemption.  Add that up.  Would these soup kitchens and AA meetings end?
@babs_to_you @JanicePriest @gcg72785 @VivRockMasney @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro Does that seem in line with the institutions we've mentioned?  No. You need to think through your argument and not just play devil's advocate.
@babs_to_you @a2z_social @VivRockMasney @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro All businesses have write offs.  If your expenses and charity exceed your income, then you wouldn't pay a dime.  That's pretty much how taxes work.  Everyone helps everyone.  When my neighbor does well, I do well...and when we have decent roads - it's benefit to all.
@JanicePriest @babs_to_you @gcg72785 @VivRockMasney @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro Not enough.
@irvingmuller @VivRockMasney @babs_to_you @a2z_social @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro I get it, but if they don't "make a profit" then they wouldn't pay.  Mega is a different beast.
@babs_to_you @a2z_social @VivRockMasney @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro Yes - it is whataboutism.  Almost any Mormon Temple, you know - here in the US is more than what's needed for fellowship.   More whatabouts???
@babs_to_you @a2z_social @VivRockMasney @KathyAMorelli @ananavarro Then why bring it up? It's just more whataboutism...

@djmlaw1 @jne7043 @PaulaReidCBS So firing Mueller is easier if trump puts a pasty in Boente's place? Am I reading this right?!?
