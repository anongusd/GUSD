@AliAbdelaziz00 You are basically letting him off the hook for free if that fight isn‚Äôt made.
@AliAbdelaziz00 Why would you not want your fighter to destroy him in the cage then??
@MMAdamMartin Finally someone speaks the truth about Woodley! And his pre title shot UFC run was not impressive whatsoever.
@TonyFergusonXT vs @USMAN84kg
Johnny Walker KOs Jon Jones within 30 seconds.
@JedKMeshew He would have.
@bokamotoESPN Have y‚Äôall not followed Woodleys UFC career??  This is his true self.
This is the Woodley we all know. The same one who got destroyed by Rory. The same one who got a lucky judges decision against Wonderboy. The same one who bored us to death against Maia. He was never close to being the greatest. #UFC235
@espnmma @Grabaka_Hitman I THOUGHT HE WAS OUTTTTT
Johnny Walker is the real deal.

@DamonMartin His resume is NOT insane. Condit knee injury, Lawler coming off 3 wars. Gastelum (SD that most argue TW lost), WB 1&amp;2 you could argue he lost both, and Maia was the worst fight of all time. The only convincing win was a shot Robbie Lawler.

Dana said on UFC unfiltered he is obligated to offer Nate 3 fights a year by contract. He hasn‚Äôt fought since 2016 so that‚Äôs at least 4-6 fights he has turned town and a year + of inactivity.  Obviously a double standard for @panteraufc  #UFC224

Scott Israel claiming he knows how to keep people safe is laughable. My Sheriff provided us with the training to where we wouldn‚Äôt stand outside of a school while a shooter is massacring students, unlike his deputy.

@UFCONFOX @TWooodley @RdosAnjosMMA He couldn‚Äôt knock out Demian Maia. The only people he‚Äôs putting to sleep are the fans watching his boring ass fights.
@paralakz @TWooodley @WonderboyMMA @danawhite @ufc Amen.
I wanna see Darren Till or Kamaru Usman shut Woodleys cocky ass up by putting his lights out. He is truly delusional.
Listening to Tyron Woodley criticize RDA and Lawler is infuriating. He was gifted a draw and a decision against WB and looked terrible against Maia. Before that he was 4-2. Woodley backs up for 25 minutes and throws predictable right hands. @UFCONFOX
@UFCEurope @Ruthless_RL Who is running this account???
Oh yeah...Tyron Woodley put in so much work to get a title shot. His hypocrisy is sickening. @UFCONFOX #UFCWinnipeg https://t.co/DMS23qFNm5
TYRON YOU DIDNT PUT IN THE WORK!! YOU SAT OUT A YEAR AFTER BARELY WINNING A SPLIT DECISION OVER KELVIN GASTELUM! #UFCWinnipeg @UFCONFOX
Tyron is such a hypocrite. He was gifted a title shot based off a 4-2 record without beating top contenders.  Not to mention he sat out for over a year! @ColbyCovMMA @USMAN84kg @MMAFighting @arielhelwani @darrentill2 https://t.co/0edk39sGOQ

@JESnowden That was bothering the hell out of me.

@arielhelwani Rogan is full of it
Joe Rogan needs to stop with this nonsense about Max Holloway being the greatest featherweight ever. He beat a past his prime Aldo twice. The old Jose Aldo defended the belt numerous times, fought all the number one contenders from WEC to UFC.
Aldo can‚Äôt continue to fight at 145. The weight cut killed him #UFC218
He took his head clean off..... https://t.co/hph5khj9yU
@kennyflorian What‚Äôs scary is Overeem landed first....
@BrendanSchaub @francis_ngannou Now you believe!!!
Overeem seemed to fight a bit afraid. I can‚Äôt blame him tho. Francis Ngannou is absolutely terrifying. #UFC218
Stipe should be afraid. Very very afraid.  #UFC218
Francis told Overeem ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to sleep‚Äù at the media weigh ins and that‚Äôs what happened. #UFC218

This fight is insane!! Two warriors! #UFC218
How does anyone think Casey lost the 3rd? #UFC218

20-18 Casey #UFC218
1-0 Casey #UFC218
Rewatched and scored Shevchenko vs Nunes 2 and it‚Äôs disgraceful that Nunes is still wearing that belt. Incompetent judging.
There needs to be a joint session of commissions to establish an oversight committee for mma judges. Incompetence should be punished. #UFC
It‚Äôs hard to see how Nicco Monta√±o wins against Valentina Shevchenko. #TUFFinale26

There‚Äôs been a lot of terrible decisions today. Tiffany Timebomb lost by an egregious 49-46 &amp; Barb loses 29-28 both in two judges scorecards

@ClaudiaGadelha_ y'all are crazy if y'all think Claudia lost that first fight against Joanna. That was the biggest robbery I've ever seen.
@christineXxvi I don't think he one, I think he won! Maia literally did nothing with those positions. Masvidal lit him up on the feet.

@SoozieCuzie You used a direct quote from McCabe, &amp; are still claiming that someone is referring to the senate investigation as adequately
@SoozieCuzie then why did you include McCabes comment as if he was referring to the committee??
@SoozieCuzie who is using the "adequate" definition in reference to the Senate investigation? Clearly, not Director McCabe.

My theory is that Trump is an inexperienced politician &amp; is prone to knee-jerk reactions. His advisors seem to be unwilling to tell him no.
However, I do not believe the "cover up" conspiracy that the President fired Comey because he was about uncover evidence of collusion.
Now we are expected to believe that this was the basis for his dismissal? Clearly it isn't!
AG Sessions stated Comey had NO CHOICE, but to inform congress about the reopening of the Clinton investigation...
Both Democrats and Republicans are being hypocrites about the firing of James Comey.
@Eitakreut the FBI agents conducting the investigation are still working. This doesn't change that.
@Eitakreut I disagree with his decision to fire Comey, but it is far from a constitutional crisis.
@jimmisimpson did you know that Planned Parenthood aborts over 300,000 innocent babies per year?
I don't understand why people claiming the firing of Comey is a constitutional crisis? I wonder if they even know what that means?

Scientific theories cannot be proven, only disproven. Some people seem to forget that.
There's a big difference between being pro life and disregarding women's reproductive rights.
@Eitakreut and for you to say that it isn't a human, shows just how little empathy you have for human life. Maybe you should join ISIL.
@Eitakreut but that's my feeling and it isn't about that. It's about the fact that a human has rights to life, liberty, and POH.
@Eitakreut but for any woman who gets knocked up to be able to abort, just because of her circumstances is not right!
@Eitakreut now if the mothers life is on the line, like I said that's a rare circumstance where it should be allowed.
@Eitakreut successful, also there's a thing called adoption. Plenty of families would be willing to step up.
@Eitakreut ok, but what becomes of that child is not up to you to decide! Plenty of examples of kids who were meant to be aborted becoming
@Eitakreut I've seen those too, have you seen the video where a doctor claimed if the baby was born he would let it die??
@Eitakreut I've seen the videos what are you talking about???
@Eitakreut your opinion, let's rely on science here. Homo sapien is human according to science, not your feelings/opinion.
@Eitakreut might be overturned soon. Plus the executive branch could disregard SCOTUS opinion anytime they want. It's happened before.
@Eitakreut what about those fetuses that attempt to fight off the scalpel. Does that sound like a bundle of cells to you??
@Eitakreut the hell it doesn't. You claim it's not a human. Species defines it as one.
@Eitakreut and one humans rights end where another's begin.
@Eitakreut the constitution guarantees the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, federal law states murder is illegal...
@Eitakreut again what species is a fetus if not homo sapien??
@Eitakreut Ever heard of superseded scientific theories?? Happens all the time.
@Eitakreut you just throw out the word science as if there is 100% consensus on the issue.
@Eitakreut how can you say that a fetus is not a human?? Tell me what species science defines it as.
@Eitakreut of course there are rare circumstances where it should be allowed (mothers life, rape, incest). Beyond that, I think not.
@Eitakreut also, If you notice in my first tweet I was referring to those who argue ALL abortions should be legal.
@Eitakreut no I would hope not. Don't confuse me with radical religious folk, who base their argument simply off morals.
@Eitakreut so they aren't homo sapien species after death??
@Eitakreut it has nothing to do with my feelings. Im simply stating that the argument for abortion is flawed.
@Eitakreut it shouldn't have MORE rights, but EQUAL. Constitution guarantees right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
@Eitakreut what about abortions past the first trimester? Still not human?
@Eitakreut how is it not a human? When a person dies and their organs no longer function, they are still considered human.
@Eitakreut right, but does that change the fact it is still a human and has rights?
I realize this is a sensitive subject, but a fetus is still a human, and the law is clear, when it comes to the murder of a human.
How is "a woman should have the right to choose" a logical defense of ALL abortions? If I choose to kill someone, that's a capital offense.

@FarmerMJ @elverkonge don't tell me what I do and don't believe. I never said it was out of control. Actually my argument was that

@elverkonge another thing we agree on. See there is common ground.
@elverkonge which says a lot about our country. There are opportunities. You just have to seek them. It's not gonna be handed to anyone.
@elverkonge I also believe in the pursuit of happiness and this is a country in which an African American was able to become president.
@elverkonge I couldn't sign up for Obamacare because I'm was a student and "didn't have enough income" so how is that fair??
@elverkonge I do believe in common sense regulation. Im not calling for complete deregulation, even tho it may sound that way.
@elverkonge poverty is a disease that carries on from generation to generation. It's up to the people to cure themselves of it. Not the GOV.

@elverkonge regulation, taxes, and the administrative state are your job killers.
@elverkonge @silkyfrost @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett 100-0. You butted into this convo and now you don't wanna talk about it?
@elverkonge @silkyfrost @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett people claim he's for the corporations. Yet he was confirmed to the federal judiciary
@elverkonge @silkyfrost @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett obviously you don't have a clue what is going on. This whole debate is over Gorsuch.
@elverkonge @silkyfrost @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett If corporations r so awful shouldn't we celebrate when they close plants &amp; outsource?
@elverkonge Libs would rather the rich be poorer even if it means the lower class becomes poorer!
@elverkonge Inequality created by the free market isn't a moral issue. Oh btw, the 1% pay 46% and the bottom 60% pay 2% according to CNBC.
@kellylyric001 @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter OK drama queen. You got me there. Lol. Fear mongering at its finest.
@SouthJerzMick @Deadspin yes it does. whether you like it or not he has the presidents ear, and the troops have valuable input.
@ronniesandel @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter well I appreciate you at least being respectful and offering a discussion.
@dingusbutts @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter I can assure you they woulda done the same.
@dingusbutts @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter and don't say "well they left the Supreme Court out" had they needed to confirm someone
@dingusbutts @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter dems didn't change the rules in 2013???? You must be mistaken.
@SouthJerzMick @Deadspin you won't hear an argument from me against that. However, Im happy to see he's engaging tho. It makes a difference
@SouthJerzMick @Deadspin Ok, but would you rather him ignore the troops?
@ronniesandel @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter Not you individually, the Dem party. The American people decided, not me.
@Deadspin what is so "asshole" about this??
@queensue31954 @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter I honestly feel bad for every single one of you. It must be a miserable life.
If a judge likes every ruling he/she makes, chances are they are not a very good one. Neil Gorsuch is one of the best. Stop cherry picking.
@silkyfrost @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter it must be nice to call people names instead of having a rational discussion.
@brucefanjoy @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter I've had to watch him suffer because the VA isn't up to par.
@brucefanjoy @accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter don't even go there with me. My dad spent 5 years in Afghanistan and was shot.
@queensue31954 @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter which will probably come in the summer.
@queensue31954 @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter obviously this course of action makes it easier for the majority to confirm his second pick
@queensue31954 @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter I see the hypocrisy coming from the left and it disgusts me.
@queensue31954 @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter it's funny how you automatically assume that I'm some die hard Trump supporter.
@accidntlmystic @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter actually the president doesn't determine whether I win or lose. I do.
@justinreb21 @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter lol typical. Instead of having an intellectual discussion you result to petty insults.
@justinreb21 @Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter can you be anymore dramatic??? That's why the dems keep losing, y'all pick the wrong battles.
@Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter you lost, get over it. This isn't even the pick Dems should be willing to fall on the sword for.
@Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter stop fear mongering. Is that what the dems were trying to do in 2013???
Would these ppl claming #Pepsi is offensive, rather Jenner throw the Pepsi in the cops face?? Would they rather it be a message of hate??
I've read all the arguments against  #Pepsi and they are BS. I'll tell you what allllllllll these people need to do.... GROW UP!
Obviously #pepsi wasn't making light of recent protests, rather they were conveying an image of unity! People don't want that.
The fact #Pepsi had to pull its ad, amid a swell of backlash is pathetic. Ppl need to stop making issues out of nothing!
@crazietalker @BradyBuck tell me, did y'all just win the national championship??? Exactly, sit down! Hahahahaha

Judge Gorsuch believes in applying the law as it is written. He's not an ideologue who is going to make decisions based off his feelings.
Chuck Schumer does not care about the American people. He consistently puts party before country. Senator Schumer, you should resign!
Senate Dems should be ashamed for opposing Judge Gorsuch, he is obviously a fair judge and has major support amongst his colleagues.
When will Senate Democrats and Republicans stop playing childish games that hurt the American Public?? Two wrongs do not make a right.

@shaunalshatti I enjoyed the article &amp;obviously you included several quotes of Jimi saying he will fight Jones. It's just that title man.
@shaunalshatti I feel as if the title of your recent article about Jimi Manuwa is misleading, by implying Jimi won't fight Jon Jones.
@donlemon you lambasted  @scottienhughes discrediting her, &amp; making her seem deceitful. &amp; in certain terms stated the reports were false.

@LynchOnSports can you be anymore sensitive? I def didn't attempt to make you look stupid. You did that to yourself.
damnit Scoggins!!!
@LynchOnSports @mousasi_mma suck up to a fighter? really? i've actually got a life. I was simply making a point. you sir are a dick.
#KovalevWard tonight! I'm 50-50 on that one!
@LynchOnSports don't forget @mousasi_mma KOed Jacare with an upkick before that.
pulling for my fellow myrtle beach native @ScogginsFlow tonight! #UFCSaoPaulo
@TheGoat_BS @TalkMMA yes!!!!
that being said...@YoelRomeroMMA is definitely the next champ! Bisping had a good run, but it's coming to an end. very soon.
I see @mousasi_mma challenging for the title in 2017 for sure!
future champ @mousasi_mma up next! #UFCBelfast
@Renato_Laranja why you wanna know my bra??? you tryna slide into her guard???
RT @arielhelwani: I'd argue that was Lobov's best round in the UFC thus far. Relaxed, effective, dare I say, flowy.
@TheTruthJackson @raidergrad2000 it came across that way. people despise Trump for his generalizations, yet they do the SAME thing!
Im not impressed with Kevin Lee. He was getting chewed up on the feet and luckily he was fighting a dude with horrendous takedown defense.
@MoTownPhenom has freakish long arms!
Lee wants no part of those body kicks from Mustafaev!
@MoTownPhenom vs @mustafaew_mma is a sleeeper! someone's going night night!
@UNC_Basketball with the dominate performance over Hawaii early this morning. The boys are in top form this season!
What was @ABCnation115 thinking? Dissing Dan Hardy is not gonna win you fans.
RT @BloodyElbow: 30-27, 29-28? Either way Amanda Cooper won it. #UFCBelfast
Coopers weight placement on top is a major factor in her lack on ground control.
@littleroo1two you would be the champ right now if not for that cut!
@BelizeanBruiser will dance all over @bethecorreia #UFCBelfast
I've got @mousasi_mma by obliteration tonight. #UFCBelfast
Brett Johns looks fantastic and Kwak is definitely game! #UFCBelfast
#UFCBelfast to start a great evening of MMA events.

@revstevening @FrontRowBrian he stated about himself "the godfather is the guy you call when in a jam or to take care of a problem" ok Gotti
@FrontRowBrian Chael has got to get rid of Joel. Have you heard what he did to Sid Vicious and how he ruined the interview with Ric Flair??
YES! Cam connects with Benjamin! First down baby!! #KeepPounding
the #Panthers cannot win a game without making things difficult on themselves. it's ridiculous. anyway #KeepPounding
@UpstateKarateSC so proud of you and WB. it's only a matter of time now before WB finishes the job and takes that title!

RT @SBNLukeThomas: History. https://t.co/OLrrEjD6tm
@TheNotoriousMMA is a legend.
RT @BringerOfRain20: TWood got lucky with one punch ran backwards all fight. Enjoyed the fight both fighters are good Wonderboy is better i‚Ä¶
T Wood does absolutely nothing except land one big punch yet he retains his title?? @WonderboyMMA out classed him!
RT @day_spartan: Bullshit call! @WonderboyMMA won that fight rounds 2, 3, 5
@WonderboyMMA won that fight!!! a lapse in judgment in the 4th cost him the belt. REMATCH!!
THERE HAS TO BE A REMATCH!!
THAT WAS BULLSHIT!!! #UFC205
@WonderboyMMA 48-47!!
@WonderboyMMA it's your time brother!!!
@KarolinaMMA you are amazing!! looking forward to your return!

RT @JayPrimetown: Yoel -600 / Bisping +450
RT @LanceFischel5: Yoel is going to end the career of Bisping
@MikeBohnMMA if he doesn't he should vacate the freaking belt!!!
RT @MMARoasted: Michael Bisping just dropped to 170. #ufc205
we love you @ChrisWeidmanUFC you will be back!
@bisping cannot run from @YoelRomeroMMA anymore!!!
YAMASAKI SHOULD NEVER REF AGAIN #UFC205
@YoelRomeroMMA is on another level when it comes to pure wrestling skill.
Romero vs Weidman up next!!! This is a hard one to call!

easily 29-28 Edgar, but I could also see 30-27.
@FrankieEdgar is the man!!!
Khabib is a savageeeeee!!!!!
Khabib vs MJ is an intriguing clash of styles. Stoked to see how it plays out.
AMEN. You can't reward someone who who fights like Carmouche. Laying in someone's guard should be a neutral position. https://t.co/dJLZt2oORn
RT @Cronikeys: Here's a rare President Trump for you all :3c https://t.co/B0hHpfc3Lx
if @WonderboyMMA implements a game plan similar to @rory_macdonald against TW, I believe he will dominate. Rory was brilliant that fight.
RT @UFCEurope: RT if you're with @TheNotoriousMMA at #UFC205 tonight!! https://t.co/0xlzrxXxZ7
Ronda isn't fookin' about!!#ufc205 #UFC207 https://t.co/uDPPG5Aido

To the people assuming Trump's presidency will be a disaster; It's not the end of the world, stop being so dramatic. #Elections2016

@JD762011 @mousasi_mma @ufc @bisping @danawhite Chris and Luke are already booked tho. Gegard vs Bisping at 206 would be perfect timing.

@Patrick_Wyman are you not suspicious of the fact that Bill Clinton spent over a half hour on the AGs jet, days before the announcement?
@Patrick_Wyman Thats the million dollar question. Why have so many others been indicted under the same statue, but she wasn't? Corruption.
@Patrick_Wyman @JNSmit16 my father spent an entire career in the intelligence field and i can tell you ANYONE else woulda been indicted.
@Patrick_Wyman it's not simply threatening to throw a political opp in jail, but someone who BROKE THE LAW.
