@RailbirdJ @HomeFreeGuys I literally had a smile on my face for the entire show. So fun!
“@HomeFreeGuys: We're in Cleveland tonight @ the Playhouse Sq Theater. 3,000 seats! http://t.co/7NPyhaPW8R” SQUEEEEE!!! So excited!
Ladies: there is a line between "bold lip" and "clown."
@LennieBK Dewey's is fun for the kiddos to watch them make the pizza. Jack just yells through the glass at them, "Again! Again!"
@cornfedwarrior @AllanFee @Q104Cleveland Sigh. I don't even remember what @AllanFee looks like it's been so long since I've seen him.
@RailbirdJ kinda gets old, no? But I agree, I can only be positive after copious amounts of coffee and/or happy pills. :)
@RailbirdJ I dunno, people saying it's warm today but it's going to be cold again...it's Friday, but it's going to be Monday again...
Hey guys, it's going to be 54 degrees today! And it's Friday! How about a little positivity? #weathertweet #fridaytweet

A woman at the airport asked if Jack (2.5 years) and Piper (10 weeks) were twins. O_o
@divotjr We had a blast! Got home a few hours ago. Jack exclaimed "no snow!!!" as soon as we landed.
@divotjr Nope, one more week to go!

Piper just slept for 6.5 hours. I know you're not supposed to have a favorite child, but....
@ritapita kickboxing on the door would be way cooler.
Maybe @danieltosh was on to something. http://t.co/R90JPc9a6a
Full belly from the @peckfoodservice trade show. Trade shows are fun when your trade is ice cream! #tremontscoops #tremont
“@runnersworld: THE LIST: Conversation starters for your long run this weekend http://t.co/5j3hEv1deu” FYI @masongoodman @cornfedwarrior.
@RailbirdJ Rioting would ensue!
The way everyone remained so calm* during the gmail outage gives me hope we could handle a REAL crisis well. O_o
@ItsAHero I know! I'm hoping if I get something a little more up to date I will wear them...?
@ItsAHero I got my glasses in 1999! I think it's time for a new pair. :)
@LiliaLipps @masongoodman Dinner somewhere there won't be screaming kiddos (so nowhere I'm going to be!). @EdwinsCLE or @albatrosCLE...?
@masongoodman @LiliaLipps Uhhhh jinx, Mason!
@LiliaLipps Go to a nice dinner, see a movie and sleep in!!! #thingsimiss
@divotjr Thanks! She's finally starting to look more like a tiny human and less like a newborn alien. :)
@divotjr Just 13 weeks (1 before/12 after) this time...maybe the ONE thing I miss about JD...
Morning snuggles with Piper. Not sure if we are getting out of bed today. http://t.co/jm7r7xrHoc
@WKYCSports Go home, Channel 3, you're drunk. #thisisnotnews
@poiseinparma And our favorite place was Alan Wong's - we had our wedding night dinner there.
@poiseinparma Absolutely! I will send it your way - it is just collecting dust on our bookshelf now. :)
@poiseinparma I have a Fodor's guidebook from Oahu if you want it. I can drop it in the mail to you.
@cleshopaholic @holliesmiles @wkyc @johnWKYC Honestly, does anyone care who's "tougher"? We're Clevelanders, we're all tough.
@masongoodman Consider it my hug to you on National Hug Day.
The house smells delicious as we heat up eggplant parmesan - thanks @katiemomoftwins and @masongoodman!
Can't believe I paid $60 for 8 beers. Won't be able to send my kids to college, but at least I'm helping the Conway kids go. #BABOS

“@LennieBK: Homemade snickers bars. So good. http://t.co/f9Q3I6Myeb” They were delicious!
Loved my meal at Katz Club Diner, but the service definitely left something to be desired. But I gotta head back to try a faux ho...
@JoeGramc So did you get her digits or not?
Happy 1 month birthday, Piper! xoxoxo http://t.co/wVwSbk938t

@406Northlane Please tell this to my 4 week old. :)
Jared Leto was amazing in Dallas Buyers Club, and I'm normally hesitant to praise any man who wears a "messy bun" hairstyle un-ironically.
I'm pretty sure we have a 'Weekend at Bernie's' situation on Fox 8 today with Dick Goddard....
Thanks for the visit today @AmyMartin216 and @clevelizabeth. It was great to catch up (i.e. gossip). :)
@JoeGramc Can you find an article about what was in our food last night? (cc: @NikkiSchiro)

@dlayphoto @dougtrattner @Square Seriously. Our customers @TremontScoops love Square. People pay for a $2 sale with credit/debit.
@dlayphoto @dougtrattner In what universe is cash only the new trend? Is the grand opening taking place in 1960?
@willgoldstein When I opened the 26 mo one it actually said "your child is 26 months and 4 weeks old"... What is that?!? He's 2ish.
@willgoldstein I got 2 emails today, one saying "your 26 month old" and the other "your 27 month old" thus prompting my attempt at math...
@dlayphoto @Sushi86_CLE Absolutely! We LOVE Sushi 86 and order takeout from there every week!
Spent way too long trying to figure out if @babyweinzimmer is 26 or 27 months old. F it, he's 2+.
Talking turkey with @DeliciousPies. Turkey = pie. I like these kinds of business meetings.

@JoeGramc I scored a 92 as well. So this means I'm not acting my age...? Young at heart...?
@LovinTheTribe That was uncomfortable to watch.
@JoeGramc Deagan's mac &amp; cheese is no joke!
@jagxjr99 Confession: this pic was taken moments before he face planted off the booster seat on to the floor. #motheroftheyear
@deaganskitchen enjoying the delicious mac &amp; cheese! http://t.co/F2DZNxiPMx
Said commercial. Should contain a warning for new mothers. http://t.co/ZbxSunNAF0
No, YOU just cried during the Johnson's Baby "You're doing OK, Mom" commercial. #hormones #parenthood #arghhhhhhh
@dlayphoto @cornfedwarrior Of course we are huge nerds and bring our own aprons. BYOA.
Is that a sugar cane or are you just happy to see me? @GatheringsLKWD @cornfedwarrior http://t.co/cMqrICq6ZP
@TamarieKeehn Aww, it's because you didn't get to see Miss Piper after all. Have a great session today and see you soon! :)
@LennieBK @DCapriato Well of course in my sleep deprived state I read that as you getting tattoos ON Simon and Elise... O_o
