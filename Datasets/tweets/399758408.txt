@amanduh37604 @MarshaBlackburn Never said that the numbers don‚Äôt revise up and down; however, average for 3 months is 241,000. January 304,000 probably just like December 312,000 could be more overstated than the norm. At least looking through 2018 Revisions.
@IvankaTrump I applaud positive numbers; however, average over 3 months is 241,000 and December revised down 90,000 (largest revision in 2018, if not ever) to 222,000. January numbers will most likely be revised down and only hope the margin of error isn‚Äôt greater than the last.

@TPPatriots Weren‚Äôt you about #FiscalResponsibility and why did @HouseGOP add $4 Billion above @DHSgov and @POTUS request.
@SenatorCarper @chillinphx @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs lost on most that @POTUS and  @DHSgov request was for $1.6 Billion not $5.7 Billion. Since @HouseGOP thought they could #Sneak more in despite #Zero evidence of #CostBenefit and careless impact to @NationalDebt.
@ScottCoyne1 @DannyZuker That‚Äôs the same poor attitude #Congress and @WhiteHouse has because they fund to a date that gives them 10-14 days before the next paychecks.  Just the prospect of not being paid on-time is #Unconscionable.
@RepJoeKennedy #UnemploymentRate and #Confirmations might be @WhiteHouse last talking points.
@Jim_Jordan False. $4 Billion was added to the @DHSgov budget request and @HouseGOP overrode their objections every time.

@jaketapper @Phil_Mattingly @TheLeadCNN Not when @DHSgov asked for $1.6 Billion and the @NationalDebt is near $2 Trillion more in less than two years! Similarly, his thinking it‚Äôs total cost is $25 Billion is foolish. Bet it‚Äôs $100 Billion+ to complete and maintain over next 10years.
@WhiteHouse @SecretarySonny Why is a program that you‚Äôre trying to reform for the benefit of those struggling only #Measure being used is #TaxpayerSavings?

@GMA @LanaZak Why ‚ÄúActing‚Äù, it‚Äôs an appointed position not needing confirmation. Tells me it‚Äôs temporary.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Understanding the Judges ruling, it was @WhiteHouse stopping the tax consequences of going uninsured that made it ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù.  Congress needs to reinstate the tax.
@HuffPost @USRepKCastor @FLGovScott @marcorubio Let‚Äôs be reasonable. Federal Minimum Wage should be balanced with state and programs. Incremental change is better than drastic reaction.
@ABC It‚Äôs a start but @DHSgov @CBP should have initiated this last week.
@RepWilson @DHSgov @WhiteHouse My error, just read the @DHSgov statement on #Facebook but sounds like minor was in the care of @CBP for 7 Hours before presenting a medical issue. Too much time thus unwise to make comment until it‚Äôs been investigated.
@RepWilson Too early to make a statement but since it fits @DHSgov and @WhiteHouse narrative they‚Äôll not wait for facts to freely comment. No #Compassion or #Retrospection!
