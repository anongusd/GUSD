a hot meal,getting a shower and much more. My dream one day is to have a actual store front office along light rail in both downtown these offices would contain,,,, lockers,restrooms,showers, job training skills and much more
Now winter weather is upon us I am trying to get free hats and gloves and jackets for as many people I can. Also the holidays are around the corner and making small gifts to pass out to all homeless people. To show them all Someone cares and wants to make a difference for them .

When you‚Äôre homeless foTrying to find a place to sleep before the sun went down made things even worse and it took me a few weeks before I finally found somewhere that I felt comfortable staying for a while.
When you‚Äôre homeless for the first time, figuring out where to sleep is one of the most stressful problems that you will most likely deal with. When I first became homeless, it was bad enough trying to figure out what I was going to do to get on my feet.
