@CaryKennedy: Need to pass permanent #TABOR reform so we can keep up with changing demographics, provide healthcare for citizens. #HIHC17
@MikeJohnstonCO : Should protect gains on CHIP and go farther - cover every income-eligible child. #HIHC17
@LtGovofCO : Block grants are subterfuge for cutting our Medicaid funding. #HIHC17
Colorado's low level of education funding is a topic of conversation for panel of Democrats at Hot Issues in Health. .#EdColo #cohealth #HIHC17
@LtGovofCO Patient education is important; health care costs more because we consume it. Says lifestyle is important. Says that high premiums in mountains are a problem but affect relatively few people; . #HIHC17
@CaryKennedy education is a health issue. #cohealth #coedu
@LtGovofCO Some of other Democratic ideas have been tried; have to have things that work in legislature. #cohealth #HIHC17
@NoelForColorado on costs: move towards a Medicare for all or public option; or partner with other states #cohealth #HIHC17
@MikeJohnstonCO on reducing costs: increasing choice, pricing transparency, and paying for outcomes rather than procedures . #HIHC17  #cohealth #copolitics
@CaryKennedy: #Colorado should have a public health insurance buy-in program to address costs. #HIHC17
Four Democrat candidates for governor are here to talk about #healthpolicy: Thanks for joining us, @LtGovofCO @MikeJohnstonCO @CaryKennedy and @NoelForColorado. #HIHC17 #copolitics #cohealth https://t.co/GWgia66qpA
@cynthiacoffman: "The data is bodies washing up in Cherry Creek." Says we may need to take approaches that aren't "particularly palatable;" local communities should have ability to explore solutions. #cohealth #HIHC17 #OpioidCrisis
@dougrobinsonco and @vic4co both say needle exchange programs are worth exploring, pilot in some places; not ready to say that's a statewide approach. #HIHC17 #OpioidCrisis
GOP candidates on #OpioidCrisis :@vic4gov says federal government has some responsibility. Talks about hard-hit rural counties:. "It has a lot to do with economic insecurity." State should use resources to get this under control. #cohealth #HIHC17
GOP candidates on #OpioidCrisis :@dougrobinsonco We have opioid crisis; also have marijuana problems. Says we need to work on prevention; that doctors need to check database re: prescriptions; and look at other pain management approaches.  #HIHC17
GOP candidates on #OpioidCrisis :@cynthiahcoffman says a lot of work has been done on heroin, opioids in state; will also look to other states. Says MAT (Medication-Assisted Treatment)  can help. "We have an antidote but we don't have a solution." #HIHC17
@vic4gov said he is not interested in a single geographic rating zone.  @dougrobinsonco and @CynthiaHCoffman say it is an interesting idea. Coffman: Could bring premiums down. #Colorado #cohealth
@dougrobinsonco says more competition and allowing people to be consumers will bring down costs. Says he wants to expand HSA flexibility, think about reinsurance, allow insurers to work across state lines. #HIHC17
@Vic4Gov focuses on #ACA and its benefits to pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and hospitals. Says he would get Colorado out of the exchange and that primary care should be available without insurance. #cohealth  #HIHC17
@cynthiahcoffman: Calls for more transparency in prices for healthcare and talks about local needs #cohealth #HIHC17
Three Republican candidates for governor are here to talk about health issues. Thanks @cynthiahcoffman @vic4gov and  @dougrobinsonCO for joining us. #cohealth #HIHC17 #copolitics https://t.co/d6pQpkNuv0

Audience member: Health insurance literacy is the next frontier, addressing the "dazed &amp; confused" findings. #2017CHAS.
67,000 Coloradans tell us they need alcohol/drug services but can't get them. would nearly fill Mile High stadium. #2017CHAS.
Douglas County has state's lowest uninsured rate at 1.4%. We don't think many counties across the nation could beat that. #2017CHAS.
Self-reported health by Coloradans is changing very little, even with more health insurance. #2017CHAS.
Coloradans aren't using more preventive care, even though it's covered under ACA. Suggests need for more education. #2017CHAS.
Dazed &amp; confused: 1 of 7 uninsured Coloradans say they don't know how to get insurance, even w/outreach efforts. #2017CHAS.
Colorado Medicaid members are happy with the program, including services and choice of docs. #2017CHAS.
Many Coloradans tells us insurance and health care both still cost too much. #2017CHAS.
Covering Colorado's kids still a success story! Only 3% don't have health insurance. #2017CHAS.
CO's young invincibles still have highest uninsured rate at 12.3%. But rate has fallen by half since 2013. #2017CHAS.
Hispanic Coloradans still have highest uninsured rate at 10.4%. But headed in right direction. Dropped from 26.3% in 2011. #2017CHAS.
Between 2013 and 2017, Colorado has 600,000 more residents w/insurance. That = populations of Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. #2017CHAS.
Colorado has hit a new high: more than 5 million Coloradans have health insurance for the first time. #2017CHAS.
Vulnerable populations still have highest rates of uninsurance, but gaps are narrowing. Income, race/ethnicity, age. #2017CHAS.

Another ACA problem: high deductibles and out of pocket costs. Gets worse with incentives for cheaper coverage in Senate bill. 7/
