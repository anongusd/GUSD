HR 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, would address the Charleston loophole that allows licensed dealers to sell a gun after 3 business days even if a background check has not been completed. Congress MUST vote against procedural motions that could derail the bill.

So out of respect for America‚Äôs gun violence victims and survivors, don‚Äôt say ‚Äúthere is no tragedy that would have been prevented by [#HR8 , nor evidence to support the claim that related homicides are driven by legal private transfer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lie based on greed.
Since the introduction of the federal background check system 25 years ago, the Internet emerged as a massive, unregulated marketplace. Investigations show that, in some states, as many as 1 in 10 would-be gun buyers on https://t.co/t25KAqmKZi have prohibiting criminal records.
Millions of guns change hands each year through sales by unlicensed sellers. A 2015 survey found that nearly a quarter of Americans who acquired a firearm within the past two years did so without a background check.
By contrast, when Missouri decided to repeal its purchase permit law requiring background checks, the state experienced a 25% increase in its firearm homicide rate and a 16% increase in its firearm suicide rate.
We know these laws work. When Connecticut passed a law requiring handgun buyers to pass a background check at the point of sale and as part of a permit process, it was associated with a 40% reduction in the gun homicide rate and a 15% reduction in the gun suicide rate.
Or another woman who was shot and killed by her ex-boyfriend in May 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The killer, who also seriously injured her two children in the shooting, had a prohibiting restraining order against him, but was able to purchase a firearm from an unlicensed seller.
It could have saved a woman, her husband, and six children‚Äîaged 6 to 13‚Äîwho were all killed by her former partner in August 2015 near Houston, Texas. Despite an extensive prohibiting criminal history, the killer was able to buy a gun from a stranger he met online.
A background check requirement for unlicensed sales could have saved a woman who was shot and killed in January 2018 in Appleton, Wisconsin, by her husband, who was able to purchase the firearm from a seller he met online, despite his prohibiting felony conviction. https://t.co/w1hefxSyPo

@DavidCornDC I disagree. I think media have run out of ways to tell the story and not bough (male) lawmakers care. But Americans do. It‚Äôs why we won so big in the midterm elections.
One way to do that would be to follow through on this commitment from one year ago - a week after Parkland - to support background checks on every gun sale. 		After #HR8 passes the House, support its passage through the Senate and sign it into law. 		https://t.co/HhmuQvkhht
Let‚Äôs be clear: The mass shooting in a Parkland, Florida, high school wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúschool violence‚Äù - it was GUN violence. Even $30 million from the @NRA won‚Äôt change that fact.		Gun violence in U.S. schools reached a new record in 2018. We honor all victims and survivors by acting. https://t.co/1lzQSsqoK5
On the one year mark of the mass shooting in Parkland, State Rep. @ChristyClarkNC - former North Carolina @MomsDemand chapter leader - is cosponsoring a gun safety package that prohibits high capacity magazines and bump stocks, and includes safe storage requirements. #NCPOL https://t.co/fu33TEewuL

@Will_Bunch Agree with all except Perriello‚Äôs progressive credentials. He was once entrenched with the NRA and less consistent on gun safety than Northam (this was the number two issue in exit polls). Perriello was also less consistent on abortion than Northam. Two issues important to women.

Northam should resign because he‚Äôs a racist. But he was elected - in part - because he was better on gun safety. And exit polls showed gun safety was the second most important issue to voters in the 2017 Virginia governor‚Äôs race. https://t.co/D2PHoqP5Ge
Here‚Äôs a reminder. And I know not all Democrat lawmakers prioritize gun safety - including those who endorsed Perriello - but polling shows that women, people of color and marginalized communities do. And that‚Äôs a big part of why Northam won in Virginia. https://t.co/4I4D50Jix2
Worst take: Out-of-state men who say women (Northam won women voters by 22 points) and people of color (Northam won 8 in 10 nonwhite voters) should have been psychic.		Many Virginians objected to Perriello‚Äòs historic opposition to gun safety and his allegiance to the @NRA. https://t.co/Yb7bzlJIaL

It‚Äôs been six months since Maria Butina, an admitted agent of the Russian government and @NRA ally, was arrested. The walls are closing in on the NRA as Americans - and Congress - demand answers about their relationship with Russia.
Last year, the @NRA told the Senate Finance Committee that since 2015 it had brought in roughly $2,500 from ‚Äúpeople associated with Russian addresses‚Äù or Russian nationals living in the US, leaving open the question of money from shell companies or less overt sources.
The @NRA spent $55M ‚Äì or over $70M, according to McClatchy ‚Äî to influence the 2016 elections. That‚Äôs far more than they ever spent during a previous election. But the NRA doesn‚Äôt have to disclose all of its donors, making it difficult to tell where most of the money came from.
David Clarke, then a member of multiple @NRA committees, was on the trip. The NRA paid for David Clarke‚Äôs airfare to Israel, the first leg of the delegation trip, and Brownell paid for the second leg, from Israel to Russia.
Joe Gregory, a charter member of the @NRA‚Äôs high-dollar donor program, was also part of the delegation. As was Hilary Goldschlager, an executive member of the NRA‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Leadership Forum. Former NRA president and current board member David Keene was also on the trip.
Pete Brownell, as then the @NRA‚Äôs first vice president, was next in line to become NRA president when he led the delegation trip in December 2015. In May 2017, he officially became president of the NRA.
Wayne LaPierre‚Äôs attempt to minimize the @NRA‚Äôs official involvement with the now-infamous 2015 delegation trip to Moscow is inconsistent with basic facts that have been well-documented and reported by media for more than a year. 		https://t.co/w9zdtUqpj3

Ask yourself why the @NRA is opposed to background checks on unlicensed sales when they‚Äôre already required on licensed gun sales. Because the NRA - like any lobbying organization - sees regulation as a bad and unnecessary thing that will drive up costs. Regardless of lives lost. https://t.co/7OcmssqqNM

@bschapiroMD @davidhogg111 The relationship is that the sheriffs receive good NRA grades (and in some cases, campaign donations) in exchange for promoting the NRA‚Äôs goal to arm teachers, which profits gun manufacturers and solidifies their ‚Äúguns everywhere‚Äù agenda.
Go here to learn more about @MomsDemand‚Äôs Be SMART campaign, created to bring together all responsible adults to reduce suicides and the number of unintentional shootings that occur when children get ahold of an unsecured firearm: https://t.co/cShDhHepi9
From 2012 to 2014, 1,300 children died annually from a gun-related injury in the US, and 6,000 were injured. A federal analysis of school shootings released in 2004 found that 65 percent of perpetrators used a gun owned by a relative.		This is a crisis.		https://t.co/0ztcmziAy4
An estimated 4.6M American children reside in a household where at least one gun is kept loaded and unlocked. The share of child-rearing gun owners who don‚Äôt secure all their firearms more than doubled since the last time similar research was conducted. https://t.co/v05nTKnsGo
And, really, it takes nerve for @NRA gun saleswoman Dana Loesch to tout the success of gun locks given that the @NRA opposes safe storage laws and their ‚ÄúEddie Eagle‚Äù educational program has been found to be completely ineffective (and actually just markets guns to kids).
In addition, unintentional hunting shootings may also be down because the percentage of Americans who hunt has declined. States that have high rates of gun ownership and strong traditions of hunting also have the highest rates of unintentional shooting deaths.
Spoiler alert: CDC data doesn‚Äôt capture all unintentional gun fatalities because it depends on how local medical examiners classify deaths. Only 31% of US homes reported having a gun in 2014, down from 48% in 1980. The @NRA just convinced a segment of Americans to buy arsenals. https://t.co/7mnXJ6Rcxm

Be sure to mention that there is zero evidence that this would be effective; that highly trained police hit moving targets 30% of the time; that teachers don‚Äôt want to be armed; and that arming a fraction of 3.6M US teachers would enrich gun manufacturers and pay Dana‚Äôs salary. https://t.co/okBPqGuEgG
