Inspectors are assessing the entire building today, and the City had already begun a comprehensive effort to eliminate rodents — including treating tree wells and burrows, setting rodent stations, increasing street sweeping and comprehensive cleanups of the entire area.
But that issue is separate from the issue of rodents we are experiencing at City Hall. We've all had pests and rodents and City Hall is no exception, sadly. Council President @HerbJWesson has taken aggressive effort to rid our building of these pests and we fully support him.
Upon learning about the typhus outbreak that was declared in Skid Row last year, we immediately directed $300,000 to enhance cleanups within this area and are continuing to work aggressively to contain the disease. No new cases have been reported in that area in 2019.

Es oficial: ¡nuestros maestros aprobaron el acuerdo de hoy! Cuando el mundo a veces se siente como si se estuviera separando, L.A. encontró una manera de unirse. Nunca podemos parar de darles a nuestros hijos lo que merecen: una educación pública excelente y gratuita.
It’s official: our teachers ratified today’s agreement! At a moment when the world sometimes feels like it’s pulling apart, L.A. found a way to pull together. This illustrates why we can never give up on giving our kids what they deserve: a free, excellent public education.

In 2016, we charted a path toward debt-free higher education with #LACollegePromise. I have been proud to see the state follow suit, and thank Gov @GavinNewsom for proposing a 2nd year of free tuition in his budget, along with smart new investments in early childhood education.
Last year, I worked with my fellow @CABig11 mayors to fight for hundreds of millions of state dollars to end the crisis on our streets. We’re expanding affordable housing, shelter and services across @LACity. Gov. @GavinNewsom has shown that he stands with us. Let's get to work.
Governor @GavinNewsom is stepping up to the challenge of ending homelessness and increasing housing, with nearly $2 billion in his proposed budget. Look forward to working with Legislature and @CABig11 to bring this funding home, and keep pushing forward.

A city that's more innovative, fair, prosperous. A place where everyone has a fair shot and everybody belongs. A destination with a strong middle class and opportunity for all, regardless of ZIP code.		This is L.A. today: https://t.co/eVAZrjOyDN https://t.co/Iz9ymGLLl8
Exciting news! L.A. has been awarded $23M in State funding for environmental projects, zero-emission transportation &amp; workforce development in Pacoima-Sun Valley — to improve public health, create good jobs &amp; enhance the quality of life in the community. https://t.co/PURl76rh2x
We started #LACollegePromise to give students like Michelle a shot at the American dream. Making college affordable is just smart — putting a degree in reach for local students, paving their path to a middle-class future, strengthening our economy.		🎓 https://t.co/HtQq3PZYlF https://t.co/ebUJbiF0Y5
Investing in our students invests in our families, our communities and our city’s future. That’s the #LACollegePromise. https://t.co/k0omoCeFBW
It is an honor to celebrate 51 Angelenos who are joining the ranks of the @LAFD! Today we are graduating five female firefighters — only one other class in the last decade has graduated that many. 👩‍🚒👩‍🚒👩‍🚒👩‍🚒👩‍🚒		Congratulations, Class 18-1! 🎉		@LACity is lucky to have you. https://t.co/wNYWXRv1Uu
So proud of the inaugural class of Evolve Entertainment Fund interns! It’s all about giving incredible young Angelenos like Erin the chance to make it in Hollywood and ensuring our most famous industry reflects the face of our city. 		Learn more ⟶ https://t.co/r8WuathRk5 https://t.co/VfX7mc36V4

'Tis the season! https://t.co/Uc29QEIA08
Now the McCues are all settled in their new apartment, one of the thousands of units of new supportive housing we’re opening for people in need. Angelenos like the McCues are why we’re fighting to make sure all our neighbors have a place to call home. https://t.co/YiNZzsLn6u https://t.co/Xvdo44VLW2
The McCues were working full-time — but housing costs and a medical emergency forced them out of their home and into their car. https://t.co/HfXCkfLyjX
The time is right for sensible criminal justice reform. I urge the House of Representatives to take up the #FirstStepAct passed by the Senate. This is a rare opportunity to unite for meaningful reform that improves our criminal justice system and keeps our neighborhoods safe. https://t.co/SYnwp4LPIT
An honest day’s work deserves an honest day’s pay.		Proud to be the 1st big city in America to lift the minimum wage to $15/hr — giving a raise to 550,000 workers, like the people on Iris &amp; Carolina’s team at EVERYBODY WORLD. 		How we raised the wage ⟶ https://t.co/wP6R2tSCus https://t.co/vMBr5BRKiF

We worked to expand @LAsBEST so more kids have a place to learn and play after school. For a single mom like Amber, the program is also about peace of mind, knowing her children are safe, helping her juggle parenting and providing for her family. https://t.co/Xd3slIpGtI
We led the charge to pass CA’s Film and TV tax credit. The credit has pumped nearly $6 billion back into the economy, put almost 500,000 people like Brian to work, and resulted in $2.25 billion in wages for L.A.’s middle class. 		📽️ https://t.co/ipIAAfqdST https://t.co/WDYcqaNg4n
We’ve created nearly 200,000 jobs since 2013, cut unemployment in half, and helped Angelenos get the training needed to get hired and reach the middle class.

We can never do enough to give back to our servicemembers. That's what I talked about with Andrew, a vet transitioning to civilian life with a job at a local ridesharing company.

When we expanded Domestic Abuse Response Teams to every community in L.A., it was for a simple but powerful reason: No one in Mery’s situation should ever feel alone.		We'll never stop fighting to end domestic violence ⟶ https://t.co/p7fq8i2V7I https://t.co/wAmcIY3NrN
Everyone should feel safe in their workplace. With Executive Directive 23, we implemented a huge shift in improving how we handle sexual harassment and discrimination reporting in City Hall, setting an example for all of L.A.’s workforce. 		📜 https://t.co/KNntRl5d3v https://t.co/xmR964oLgU
Every child deserves equal access to sports, no matter their ZIP code or gender. We expanded @GIRLSPLAYLA to give girls like Hannah a shot to stay active and safe after school — and in 2 years, girls participation jumped from 25% to 40%. 		Learn more: https://t.co/S9NpAFU78c https://t.co/zFTS4xz8Ss

That is simply wrong and un-American, and leaders in this City and across our country will fight tooth and nail to keep this anti-family policy off the books.
Los Angeles communities stand to be hit the hardest by this change. Hundreds of thousands of our neighbors may be unable to see their doctors, keep a roof over their heads, or afford a trip to the grocery store, if they wish to remain in the United States.
Our federal government should not be in the business of penalizing low-income parents, punishing kids, or targeting immigrants who work hard, strengthen our economy, pay taxes, and play by the rules.

Nothing will stop Los Angeles from remaining a welcoming destination for families fleeing violence, persecution, and desperation in search of a better life.
The Administration's refugee cap rejects American values, undermines American leadership, and betrays America's role as a beacon of hope and opportunity the world over. We know refugees are not security threats — they're our neighbors, co-workers, colleagues, and friends.

This Administration wants us to pay more at the pump while ignoring the constant dangers that climate change poses to our country, to our children &amp; generations ahead — another example of the disconnect between the thinking in Washington &amp; the everyday needs of American families.

We cannot sacrifice the future of our planet on the altar of short-sighted &amp; dangerous policies that serve narrow interests.

Cities and the #CABig11Mayors are on the front lines of the homelessness crisis. Now we need the state to step up. #AB3171 gives our cities the resources we need for urgent solutions to deliver help to people on the streets faster. https://t.co/BGJPpLOEIP
@YoungCannibal_ Ending homelessness requires both short and long-term solutions. We’re working to build 10K units of housing that offer the services and support people need for long-term stability. Meanwhile we’re working to expand temporary shelters that get people off the streets now.
There’s no feeling quite like watching your favorite players take the field at the ballpark, and we can’t wait to welcome baseball’s best to Los Angeles for the 2020 @AllStarGame.

Our @LA_CRT was deployed to provide support to the family throughout the night as they waited for news of Jesse. Thank you to the Hernandez family for your patience and optimism during this harrowing experience. We’re keeping Jesse’s health and recovery in our thoughts today.
This rescue is a testament to the incredible work and collaboration of @LAFD, @LAPDHQ, @LADWP, @LACityParks, Park Rangers, @CHPsouthern, and the Bureaus of @LACitySAN, Engineering and Contract Administration.
Over the course of a 12-hour search, 2,400 feet of pipe were inspected — and more was underway — when a maintenance hatch west of the 134 Fwy under the 5 Fwy was opened to insert cameras. There Jesse was found and immediately given a phone to call his family!
Yesterday at 4:30 p.m. @LAFD received reports that Jesse fell approx. 25 ft into a sewer pipe. The pipes are 4 foot in diameter, filled with liquid at varying depth moving at 15 MPH. This network of pipes parallel the L.A. River and cross under freeways.

@Jason_Honeycutt Hi Jason the initiatives voters passed (Prop HHH &amp; Measure H) are being put to use to building thousands of units of housing &amp; expanding services for the homeless.
