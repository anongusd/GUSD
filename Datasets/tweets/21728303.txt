@SBalaghi @D_Anthony36 Thanks for the info. I just looked at the Florida statute cited in the CNBC article.

20. And Democrats won all 6 Senate and gubernatorial races in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the three key states Trump needed in 2016 to win the presidency. 		Trump won:	Michigan by 10,704 votes.	Wisconsin by 22,748 votes.	Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes.	TOTAL 77,744 votes
19. Ran strong, competitive campaigns to flip long-held southern red seats in Florida (Andrew Gillum), Georgia (Stacey Abrams) and Texas (Beto O'Rourke) in races where Democrats have failed to be competitive for decades.

14. Finally defeated Scott Walker in Wisconsin.		15. Elected Nevada's first Democratic governor in decades.		16.  Appear to have ousted the only two black Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives: Will Hurd in Texas and Mia Love in Utah.
8. Sent the first two Latinas from Texas to Congress.		9. Elected a Latina governor of New Mexico.		10. Flipped a Senate seat in Nevada.		11. Forced a Senate runoff in Mississippi.		12. Flipped a GOP House seat in South Carolina.		13. Elected the youngest woman ever to Congress.
Democrats:		1. Won the House.		2. Flipped at least 7 governor's seats.		3. Elected the first openly gay governor.		4. Elected 3 black lieutenant governors.		5. Elected 4 black attorneys general.		6.

After Election Day, presidents pivot from campaigning to governing. Even George W. Bush did this once the contested 2000 election was decided by the Supreme Court.		Donald Trump never did.		He spent the past two years attacking his enemies and threatening to lock up his opponent.
To those trying to justify Trump's rhetoric because people criticize him:		All presidents get criticized.		President Obama was even criticized by a famous liar who spent 5 1/2 years claiming his birth certificate was fake.
Bernie Sanders never:		1. told supporters to "knock the crap out of" protesters,		2. offered to pay legal bills for people who commit violence,		3. praised someone who threatened politicians with a machine gun,		4. praised someone for bodyslamming a reporter.

(2/2) The problem is Obama started from a negative. Net domestic investment was negative $11.7 billion in Q1 2009. By the end of his first 6 quarters, it rose to positive $144.6 billion. So, how do you (or can you?) calculate percentage change when the base number is negative?
(1/2) I have a question for my math experts. Trump's economic adviser Larry Kudlow says business investment increased in Trump first 6 quarters in office. He's right. It has increased by 28.54%. But it also increased far more in Obama's first 6 quarters. https://t.co/y5OHGipXwU https://t.co/tw7gSmRBb0

Unbelievable! Trump says he has no reason to distrust Putin on Russian election interference and changes the subect to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. https://t.co/CS3yDOIdsl
So much for Trump standing up to Putin. https://t.co/GSb788F8lE
This is a shameful abdication of leadership by Donald Trump. https://t.co/gmpHOLkhIY
So Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump both now want to investigate Hillary Clinton. That should tell you everything you need to know about this #TreasonSummit.
Asked if he blames Russia for election interference, Trump actually blames the United States, calls the Russia investigation a ‚Äúdisaster,‚Äù says there was ‚Äúzero collusion,‚Äù and brags that he beat Hillary Clinton easily. This is shameful.
Trump‚Äôs opening statement with Putin was an outrage!
So far in this press briefing, Trump has attacked Democrats but has not criticized Russia for election interference.
