@GussRuralWA @AWarriorsgarden @Giunchigliani @SteveSisolak @robertshill I don’t know @SteveSisolak or @robertshill or you but, the point he made is a valid one, money went to the same household. Now quit trying to play the victim game. Nevadans are so sick of that. Own it! I’d respect that more.

@ChrisVanHollen These in itself means very little, the important thing to look for is what happend for Citigroup if anything. Otherwise these guys have nothing and I think Kushner has his interests in the company under a blind trust anyway.
@BrettEHouse @paulkrugman @BrettEHouse Thanks for the reply I was thinking the same and maybe affect other industries that depend heavy on export. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.
@DanikaLagorio @paulkrugman @DanikaLagorio  don;t assume I’m against it just tying to spark intelligent convo.  Get opinions! President Trump Rocks!!!
@brandiiiilion Ok you’ve peaked my interest. Ill have to research the web vs the dark web vs the deep web vs spider webs

@tedlieu Wrong.
@brandiiiilion @GuyfromDetroit I actually agree with you and coming from a guy who joined at 17 and ended it at 33.  Driving a massive hunk of metal requires more training than owning a gun smh.

@thecourtneyhurd @coffeeshopjihad Hahah Right? Better be perfectly ripe too.
@paul_dalen @michigan_latino @rmayemsinger I’m gonna let this slide because you’re Army but about three times a minute average. Unless it was rifled then maybe twice if you were good.
@traytaymakeup @rmayemsinger @seagal_lori Technically an average rifleman could load and fire about every 20 seconds. Get it right lady 😉 but I get your point.
@Defencebrief @cherrymoon @TheOnechanabra @rmayemsinger I’d change professions 😉
@rmayemsinger @thecourtneyhurd I’ve always said if the USA votes to change 2A, I’ll respect it, not saying I agree, but finally someone who brings up a point/argument well worth some thought, instead of the old musket argument. Different time, evolving/devolving society.Thanks.
@LVGully Your a great dad and a great guy all around. Miss ya man.
@872Laborers How do get one of those?
@KamalaHarris So quit tweeting and start leading
@LVGully They are astray for lack of leadership, lack of focus, their leaders are busy playing politics and sadly the President share’s a little bit of the blame as does the Congress and FBI leadership. Let cops be cops get rid of the ones who aren’t.
@lvraidersreport @LVGully @OfficialPeterG_ The right guy for the job.
@LVGully You have to look at in the context of hundreds of calls sometimes thousands to regional offices. The focus since 9/11 has been terror. You can be a supporter and admit that cops don’t always get it right, and still demand better, and it doesn’t make you or them bad, just human.
@MichaelaOkla The whittyness (is that a word) is strong in this one...
