#DemDebate lowlight: Attacks on capitalism. Free markets &amp; free people have created more prosperity than anything else in human history.
The #DemDebate turns to energy. Now isn't the time to give up on the American energy renaissance in favor of pipe dream policies.
Obamacare hasn't come up much at #DemDebate. Small business owners I talked to today raised it often -- it's increasing costs, killing jobs.
Glad #DemDebate candidates are having to answer how they'd be different from President Obama. Short answer: even more spending!
Wish @DanaBashCNN was asking more questions at #DemDebate. I and my colleagues can attest -- she always has tough questions.
Would be curious if any of the #DemDebate candidates have any programs they think we should spend LESS money on. I have some ideas.
Wow! Surprised it took candidates at #DemDebate so long to get to raising taxes. They all agree on that, at least.
Waiting for the #DemDebate question that the candidates don't answer with "We need more and bigger government".
If Hillary &amp; Bernie don't think emails are an issue, will they let federal employees have classified info on basement servers? #DemDebate
Would love to see more Western questions at #DemDebate. Ask about the President's &amp; EPA's proposed takeover of small waterways, #WOTUS.
None of the candidates mention the militant, nuclear-armed regime in Pyongyang as a threat to the United States. #DemDebate
Hillary asked about tragedy in Benghazi, says "I'll get to that." Better than her old position, "What difference does it make?" #DemDebate
Glad to see China &amp; South China Sea be raised. Administration (and former Sec. of States...) haven't paid enough attention to the region.
Hillary says the President valued her judgement as Secretary of State. Not sure that's really worked out for either of them. #DemDebate
Be concerned whenever candidates start talking about which businesses deserve success. The government shouldn't make that choice. #DemDebate
The fact that capitalism is up for debate tonight is sad. Nothing's done more to lift billions out of poverty &amp; into prosperity. #demdebate
Hillary says she absorbs new information before changing her mind. Mostly poll numbers, apparently. #TPP #FeltTheBern #DemDebate
A shorter intro: "Hello, I'm Hillary Clinton. I can't believe I have to be here, frankly." #DemDebate
A shorter intro: "Hello, I'm Bernie Sanders. I'm why Hillary flip-flopped on TPP". #DemDebate
Hopefully these East Coast candidates at #DemDebate will be asked about Western issues. I wonder if they know where Vegas gets its water.
Excited for the portion of the #DemDebate when the candidates will tell us how much of our money we'll be allowed to keep under their plan.

The Senate is proceeding with their plans to raid a company for its cash. This must stop.
The Governor just signed SB09-147, a bill I worked on and sponsored to help farmers on the South Platte.
In an unprecedented move, the Senate has referred the budget bill back to committee for a "re-do."
Wasn't it supposed to rain today?
#redco Budget Cmte member just said $7 million isn't a lot of money.  Since when did millions of dollars become "not been a lot of money?"
Budget Committee is basically saying the state needs to raid a company because they are too good at what they do?  Doesn't make sense.
Our jobs bill passed Appropriations this morning. This bill could help restore 28,000 jobs and mean $50 million in economic development.
The Governor is signing our water bill tomorrow - the bill will help farmers on the South Platte survive.
My economic development bill - designed to create Colorado jobs - is up in Appropriations Committee tomorrow morning. Its # HB09-1298.

The budget hires 1,441 new employees. It's tough to pay for the budget we have now, how can we pay for part or all of these new employees?
The JBC has proposed a bill that is equivalent to a government takeover of a business - nationalization by a state. This is a bad idea!
We are meeting with the Joint Budget Committee (JBC) now to go over the state's budget bill. The JBC has some bad ideas on the table.

Off to capitol this morning. With all the snow, and 14 degrees outside, hard to believe the Rockies open their season today.
We made it home. Scary drive. At times we could only see a few feet ahead. Let's hope everyone else on the road tonight is safe.
Just closed I-70 - this will be an interesting drive home...or an unexpected vacation in Burlington!
Made it to Burlington! Still snowing...sideways!
As windy as it is, if it keeps snowing like this, eastern Colorado could be in for it.
Alright - I'll eat my words. The weather is actually pretty nasty now on the roads. I don't think I can make it to Greeley and back.
Scratch that - now its sleeting and getting a little nasty. Shouldn't have jinxed it.
Why is Jay Cutler taking the "high road" now? Seems a little late...
No snow on the eastern plains yet...I'm heading to Greeley for a radio show on 1310 am then to Burlington tonight.
@svandoren Maybe I should add a an evil sounding "muuaahaha" in front of my updates on "Evil Democrats!"  Thanks for following.
Just got home from Sterling - starting to get pretty windy and a little rain.  Think its really going to snow as much as they say it will?
The lesson learned today - when you stand up to the Joint Budget Committee, they get really mad! But I will always fight wasteful spending.
The bill to create universal health care in Colorado passed and will soon be on the floor. This is a massive expansion of government.
Appropriations approved my bill to protect children from predators. It now goes to the floor for a vote.
Appropriations, after trying to hijack the bill and increase taxes, just killed my rainy day fund bill.
A bill to repeal the death penalty just passed committee and is on way to floor.
While not voting for veterans to get mandatory in-state tution at all schools, the majority wants in-state tuition for illegal aliens.
Appropriations just voted against allowing in-state tuition at all state colleges for military veterans.
I've got two bills up in Appropriations Committee today - a bill to protect kids from Internet predators and a rainy day fund bill.
The majority plans to introduce a bill that will dramatically increase health care costs. The bill is a massive trial lawyer payback.
Still in ag committee - snowing outside now. We may be here a while! Dealing with big game damage payments and prevention materials now.
Just passed a bill in ag committee to protect landowners in Pinon Canyon.
Ok - my mom totally got me on April Fool's this morning. I should've seen it coming!
I will be voting no on the bill (SB09-170).
The Senate Appropriations committee approved the bill granting in-state tuition to illegal aliens. The bill passed 5-4.
The legislature increases fees and moves them to cash funds, then raids them to balance budget. Its time to fight back.
I've got 3 bills in Appropriations Friday. A bill to protect kids from Internet predators, a rainy day fund bill and a job creation bill.
The School Finance Act has been introduced with a provision that basically prohibits local districts from lowering taxes. Another bad idea.
We were able to defeat the fee increase amendment - as a result, the bill ended up dying. Good news for Colorado water!
Am now talking to a reporter about the twitter craze!!
I am helping lead the fight against the fee increases.
The majority leader is now trying to increase fees on farmers and water users for water permits - something the ag committee had defeated.
The majority party, in a major abuse of power, just crammed a 3rd reading amendment on to a bill that was never vetted by committee.
The House passed 35 bills on 3rd reading today. The most debate happened on the so-called bubble bill for bicyclists.
The water infrastructure bill passed on 3rd reading 63 to 1. For small towns struggling to pay for unfunded mandates, this bill is huge.
Great turn out in Fort Morgan for our town meeting. The drive was tough in the wind. Felt like driving at an angle just to keep on the road.
If you are in the Fort Morgan area tomorrow (Monday) come on by Frankie's at 6:30 am to join Sen. Brophy and I for our monthly town meeting.
They do a great job keeping the community center going. Its got a great gym with old championship banners hanging - some dating to 1926.
Just left a fundraiser for the community center in Eckley. All you could eat rocky mountain oysters and frog legs...now that's a night!
And hopefully not too much trouble for ranchers. We certainly needed the moisture. Lots of cars in the ditch on the way home, though.
CDOT has done a good job clearing the roads on the plains. Good cover of snow on the ground. Should make the wheat happy...
Our daughter is in pre-school. And already she's asking if she will get a snow day today. How early they learn!
439 small towns in Colorado have a $750 million backlog in water projects. A lot of the cost comes from unfunded mandates.
My bill to fund small community water systems passed the House on second reading. The bill increases funds without raising fees or taxes.

Just got back from the Lincoln County Lincoln Day Dinner, held in Hugo at the VFW.  I love my House District! The greatest people!

Between the transportation bill and the hospital fee, Coloradans will be paying $860 million more in new fees every year.
The hospital tax passed - a $600 million "fee" increase. I helped lead the fight against the massive spending increase.

The vote was unanimous. I am an original co-sponsor of the bill.
