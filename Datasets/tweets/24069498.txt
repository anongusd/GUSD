@krassenstein I don't hate anyone, not even Donald J Trump. But I do very strongly dislike him for what he has done to this country.
@krassenstein Mind you, I don't hate him. I am glad he is trying to make amends before he meets his maker in the future. But there is a lot more he must do once he is out of prison. Such as so much charity work for the poor and the multitude of races in this country.
@krassenstein Personally, I am not proud of him. He has a lot to make up for, look at what he helped Donald Trump do ever since the fat orange blob got into that seat look at what Donald J Trump has done to this country with all the sickness and hate. The human life span isn't long enough.

@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein And as far as a civil war it most likely would not come to that if the Democrats would only understand that the majority of Republicans are not racists bigots such as Trump and his supporters. They are the minority in the Republican party but have the louder voice due to media
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein Most of us are not Bat shit crazy like Trump and his supporters are.
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein exactly what I have been saying. We also need to stand up and fight together instead of always tearing apart ALL Republicans when most of us don't think the way that Trump and his base do. We are not all equal in our values of any person no matter who they are.
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein They hardly gave any of the other Republicans a voice that is how he won the RNC. The Country did not hear the rest of the GOP candidates or their platform a lot of this is due to the fact that American's need to be entertained no matter the cost.
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein This country is about entertainment. We are the entertainment capital of the world. The media gave Trump a bigger voice by going to all of his rallies because they knew he was going to say some crazy shit. They covered him more than any other candidate and still are.
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein and no I did not misunderstand any thing but you misunderstood me
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein Which is exactly why Trump ran as a Republican instead of the crazy that he is. It gave him an even bigger voice.
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein Just because they changed their platforms does not mean that they changed their names. Changing names means a whole lot more work to be heard. Look at the Independent, the Green party and so on. It takes so much more work to be heard and they are looked at as crazies &amp; yes some r
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein If you have ever watched the Movie Idiocracy that is where we are headed and it started with Reality TV which is and was anything but REALITY
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein this is what reality tv shit has done to this country. if there had never been the reality tv show The Apprentice then Donald J Trump would not have had his voice heard as loud as it was heard.
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein because actually, NO those Old School Republicans like myself and my husband are not in the minority. Somehow the ones that are in the minority has gotten the bigger voice thanks to hating to say it but the media. They give the crazies the bigger voice because they entertain us
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein That also means that this country is doomed to no longer be a democratic country we are now a totalitarian country and should just lay down and die like dogs
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein So Your party has also been corrupted and maybe the old school dems should change their party name as well
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein and won't help us in return. We are NOT ALL HATEFUL MONSTERS  AND WE ARE STILL FIGHTING TO SAVE WHAT IS OURS. IT IS ALMOST LIKE A CIVIL WAR WITH OUR PARTY BUT WE ARE NOT GIVING UP EVEN IF YOUR PARTY HAS
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein That is only because the Democrats have decided that ALL Republicans are these monsters when we are not and has just decided to not help those who are still fighting to save their party. We are fighting by voting Democrat in order to save our party. But you have forsaken us
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein That also goes for the Electoral College as well. That is a broken system that needs to be upgraded properly to reflect the actual numbers of the population of each state properly

@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein It actually would be nice if Democrats would actually help us try to take back our party from the ones who are hateful. The #OldSchoolRepublican is about proper fiscal spending no matter the skin color, religion, or sexual orientation. The GOP has never been about hate
@JumpsuitWedgie @krassenstein no, actually it isn't. It has been taken over and twisted but the actual true Republicans are not tainted and we are fighting like hell to get our party back to the way it was #CountryOverParty

@Babygirlxx8 @krassenstein @ikagirl Was watching Netflix last night. A show of documentaries that consisted of ppl who made dirty money. Trump was in tje dirst episode involving German Cars being sold in USA and climate change. And how Trump is trying to discredit an emission testing CO.
@Babygirlxx8 @krassenstein @ikagirl All true.
@krassenstein This Old School Republican understands. However, it was my Old School Republicans who put Robert Muller into the scent of DJTrump not the New Wave Hateful Republicans.
This #OldSchoolRepublican understands. And it was actually the #OldSchoolRepublican who put Robert Muller on the scent of DJTrump not the #NewWaveHatefulRepublicans https://t.co/5tl4XfH1Qx
@LaurieS83 @krassenstein That is going to be the season finale but the problem I think is that if it is done too soon then Mike Pence will be POTUS. I think that the Muller team is waiting so that Pence won't have that kind of power. It's all in the timing.
@LaurieS83 @krassenstein I think k the last indictment will be a big combo shot D. Trump, D. Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump all in 1 shot.

@MatthewWolfff I do not advocate what this boy has done but I don't blame the school for what he has done. It was his choice. The other boys protesting for their anti-abortion protest is a bit different. There is much more to the story that hasn't been told. They did disrespect the war vet
@MatthewWolfff Social Media is getting out of control in my opinion. It has taken on its own life and it has a mob mentality. There are plenty of other men who have raped women who also did not get that moral instruction from home or school who did not attend a Catholic school.
@MatthewWolfff However, it does not fall on the school alone to instruct the boys on American History or moral instruction. Moral Instruction actually starts at a much younger age. Moral Instruction starts at home.
@MatthewWolfff Also there is much more to the story and most likely there is more to the story to come out as it is further investigated. https://t.co/qMLbFeoFo1

@daire_shaw @danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow Yeah, I didn't think that you lived in America if hate speech was a crime. I think I might suggest that if you don't know the laws of a country that you are talking about don't say something is a crime. Because it might confuse the ignorant.
@daire_shaw @danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow If it were a crime then every Trump Rally would have everyone arrested for this crime.
@daire_shaw @danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow and actually NO it is not a CRIME. They did 0 physical harm to anyone. People have a right to voice their opinion just as you have a right to voice your opinion. You don't have to agree with it and it can be hate-filled as long as 0 physical harm is done it is not a crime.
@daire_shaw @danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow This is their exact wording and this is also being investigated by the school. The students can face expulsion "This behavior is opposed to the Church's teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person." https://t.co/0z1l0nAdQ6
@daire_shaw @danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow Now if they had made any type of physical contact in a hateful or harmful manner then it would be different. But that is actually a line they did not cross.
@daire_shaw @danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow Being hateful is not a crime. Stating just how hateful is not a crime. The unreserved apology is for the fact that they are not teaching the children how to be respectful, or this countries history.
@joylladiebnx @donderoen @wendow @TruthIsKey2019 I understand I too was responding to the person who does not know American History and who doesn't understand who the true Native American's are.
@AaronK___ @wendow no, because the grown men did not bully them. They were singing one of their cultural songs while the kids were spouting hate-filled rhetoric. Singing is not bullying, however, the rhetoric the kids were using is bullying and taunting.
@AaronK___ @wendow I also want to know what the hell that school is teaching those kids about America and it's history and what most of those boys ancestors did to the Native American's when they took over their land. I know my Ancestor was one of those POS. My ancestor is William Clark.
@AaronK___ @wendow I also do believe that the school should, in fact, punish the children for first making their school look bad. They should also punish the Chaperones for either not being there or being there and letting the taunting happen in the first place.
@AaronK___ @wendow I am not advocating to actually make their names public to the Nation. It is the policy for the media to not release a child's name first of all. I actually agree with that policy. I also never said they did anything illegal. But they were disrespectful to the Native Americans

@AaronK___ @wendow by their taunting of them
@AaronK___ @wendow And no the Native Americans were not the most racist of any of the groups there. They did not like being called Savages because the word Indian does not mean savages.
@AaronK___ @wendow and they did disrespect the Native Americans and they did disrespect men who were Vietnam war veterans of the American Military.
@AaronK___ @wendow Actually, I have and the Native American's did not push their way into anything. They were there first of all with a permit and they were scheduled to be there. Yes, there was a small very small group of black Muslims so I did find that. But the kids did taunt the Native American
@joylladiebnx @donderoen @wendow @TruthIsKey2019 Phillip the Native American in front of the stupid kid with the stupid MAGA hat was also a Vietnam Veteran. So not only was he disrespecting an elder he was also disrespecting a War Veteran of the American Military
@AaronK___ @wendow But I have seen plenty of footage of these kids that are being posted on YouTube from people who were there and saw what the kids were doing.
@AaronK___ @wendow what is Fake News? What footage are you talking about? About the black Muslims footage or any footage of the Chaperone? Just asking because yeah I didn't see any black Muslims in any of the footage and can't find the supposed chaperone egging the kids on.
@danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow the name of the kid also has to be lawfully obtained. The school is not going to release the kid's names, the parents aren't going to release the kid's names and it looks as if the kids are not going to release their classmate's names. So how would they lawfully obtain the names?
@danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow These boys also committed no crime first of all. They were just hate-filled and disrespectful but no crime was committed. Everything in your Studen Press Law shows that a crime is committed by the kid or they are trying to identify the kid for the safety and well being of the kid
@PaulRevr1 @wendow just disgusting of any type of school to have this as their cover photo on their website. Private school or not!
@wendow However, apparently, at least one of the ADULT Chaperones was there and cheering the boys on to continue their taunting.
@wendow https://t.co/kPY9DzxZf9
@wendow I just read a report saying that the mother of the boy standing right in front of Phillip who is also a Vietnam Vet is the one saying that the kids were harassed by black Muslims in all of the videos I see 0 people of color other than the Native Americans.
@danahaswell @UrszulaGajko @wendow I don't know the exact law but minors are not allowed to be identified unless permission is given by their parents to be identified or if they themselves come out and say it was them. Even idiot children are to be protected.
@donderoen @wendow @TruthIsKey2019 Here is a new question for you... Is the moon real or is it just a disk being held up in the night sky to make us think there is something else out there?

@donderoen @philip_fairey @wendow @TruthIsKey2019 oh so you are one of THOSE people. the bat shit crazy ones.
@philip_fairey @donderoen @wendow @TruthIsKey2019 Thank you. I know my ancestor William Clark (you know one of the men who was part of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition) was not a nice man to Pocahontas. ( Which waa also not her given name.) I know what my ancestor did.
@donderoen @wendow @TruthIsKey2019 You are an idiot. Go read a history book.
@UrszulaGajko @wendow They most likely are minors and by law would not be allowed to be publicly named.
@wendow Because if true then OMG THAT IS AWESOME.
@wendow I have not heard that? Can you show me something such as video. Or witness accounts so I may read it please?

@AdamSKutner and stop taking stupid penalties when you stop skating and have to reach out to stop your opponent from scoring. if you stop skating that is going to happen. you mess up twice by not staying on your guy and then committing the penalty you are punishing the whole team doing that.
@AdamSKutner don't get me wrong I am ecstatic that they won. but they need to keep their skates moving no more gliding to the puck they need to keep their sticks on the ice so that they don't fan on shots or lift the puck up over the goal. also what happened to their speed?
@AdamSKutner they haver serious issues with their Power Play. they might be getting goals on net but they are not making goals. they need to stop lifting their sticks when making the shots that will prevent them from constantly going over the net with their shots. keep sticks on the ice.

@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS also, it's hard to do trade with any country with a wall in the way especially when someone keeps saying that all Mexicans are criminals, animals, rapists, and murderers.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS That cracked me up because that isn't how trade between 2 countries works and it showed just how ignorant he really was and you and others fell for it. Hook, Line, and Sinker.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS and besides what happened to Mexico paying for the wall? We aren't supposed to be paying a penny for that wall with our Tax Dollars. Mexico was supposed to be paying for it LOL. I thought it was funny when Trump first said this. Then the whole well they will pay for it with trade
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS oh so everyone has to have insurance sweet we are going to see just how much they are going to have to pay us then will set the first year at $600 a month then the next at $800 a month and so on.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS not when the insurance companies don't have to play ball. They set the prices and don't compete because they all seem to just keep going up and up and up none go down.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS yeah I do. I just told you I was laughing my ass off at FOX. I also do research and find the actual bills and read them along with the actual laws as well. Why don't you do some of that research instead of just taking any news source as fact/truth
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS yes I guess we have 2  things we can agree on Medicare does suck. however, with the ACA if the GOP hadn't had the amendment in there stating that Insurance Companies dind't have to play ball in lowering prices then there wouldn't be this issue.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS actually watching FOX right now and laughing my ass off at the total idiocy of it. If you ever have seen the movie idiocracy this is how it starts.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise Any person can enter the United States at any point along any part of the border and ask for Asylum that does not make them a criminal. It also does not mean that they entered the country illegally either. Read the law.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS IE: Proper Health Care Coverage
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS POTUS is only making it even more difficult for those who do need it to get what they need in order to survive.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise @POTUS and that is probably the only thing we will agree on but POTUS isn't doing shit about it
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise because the Gov stopped giving them their pay and their Medical care is still all out of wack there is still no accountabilty
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise Just stating facts that they are White. Mexican's are not all criminals but apparently with "You Folks" you belive that they are. You are nothing but a fearmongerer. Why is our Government more worried about a wall that isn't needed vs helping the Vet's most are going homeless
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise and I am guessing it is due to Opioid abuse because the doctors just got them hooked and now they need more but can't get it from their doctors anymore because they weren't treated properly to get off the stuff after they got hooked.
@SAusra1 @SteveScalise You're right I don't have scores of homeless illegal criminals trying to get into my home. Instead, I have scores of WHITE American Homeless Vets trying to get in and steal from me.

@realDonaldTrump @DeanHeller The tax cuts for big business killing the middle class and poor and the health care cave in is exactly why he is no longer a Nevada Senator. The whole state is now being run by Democrats. This was a Purple State. Meaning it was an Independent  State. Now it is a full-on Democrat
@realDonaldTrump yeah, great job in Nevada. You and Pence spent a lot of time here and Jacky Rosen is now our Second Senator. What it was that lost Dean Heller the job was his caving into you on Health Care for Americans.
@realDonaldTrump Republicans wasted taxpayer money to fix an investigation into the FBI. They also wasted a ton of taxpayer money on a ton of other crap. Republicans in the Senate and the House killed taxpayers by giving Big Businesses huge tax cuts.
@DeanHeller It had better be an easy transition for her and her team. If you fail to make the transition easy then you are even more of a slimeball and a spineless man. Currently, you are just spineless.
@krassenstein Well looks like he is going to have a really hard time doing that since it was 7 or more not 7 or fewer.
@krassenstein Democrat Steve Sisolak is going to be taking over the current Governor's seat and I think he will replace Jacky Rosen with someone deserving and who will do a great job for NV and the Country for that House seat until the next election cycle.
@krassenstein I voted early for Jackie Rosen in the Senate for Nevada and as of today Nevada now has 2 Democrat Senators and the State of Nevada is now pretty much run by Democrats. So I think we are good to go for who is going to replace Jacky Rosen for the House seat she is vacating.

@Alp_B @Mamaknits3 @HillaryClinton @girlsreallyrule As for Hillary rooting on to get people out to vote is not doing more harm than good. Yes, she is rooting for the Dems. However, letting people know valuable information such as the Hotlist is not doing more harm than good.

@amsmadwoman @HillaryClinton This Rep is voting Dem for the Senate in the next few weeks. Early voting starts soon. Vote Jacky Rosen for Nevada to replace Dean Heller. Need to find a good Dem for the House to replace Jacky though.
@HillaryClinton @meg_Y12 I am also not on the hot list. BTW I voted for you over Trump as well. I am so sorry that you lost. All politicians and Wealthy businessmen have an agenda but yours is the and was the lesser of 2 evils imho
@HillaryClinton @meg_Y12 I am a little focused on the Senate. Mostly because Dean Heller is my Senator and he is a POS. This old-school Republican votes Country over Party. Jacky Rosen needs to be voted in for that Senate Seat. And I am 1 Rep that is voting for the Dem in that seat.

@Biker_Bot1 @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain And now that he is in the Public lime lite he can't do anything to harm her for coming out. Before he could have had her killed if she came out. Because there wasn't as much attention on him then.
@Biker_Bot1 @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain She can't press charges statute of limitations. When it is not to investigate a crime it is to get to the Truth before someone has a lifetime appointment THEY DO.
@Biker_Bot1 @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain she wants the FBI to investigate and the GOP wants to blame the victim. Which has been going on for Decades and needs to STOP. Also there is something called the Statue of Limitations. He can't be charged. Women and Girls are made to feel ashamed like it is their fault,

@jon_wirth @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain that is only true when you believe someone who lies every second of the day like Donald J Trump and Devin Nunes because they are the only one who is saying that they are corrupt and they literally have 0 proof that the FBI is as corrupt and Nunes and Trump are saying.
@ScotchGrey @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain and you don't have to be under oath with the FBI it is a crime no matter what when you lie to an FBI investigator in ANY investigation.
@ScotchGrey @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain she wants the FBI to investigate. It is a crime to lie to the FBI. I see you are very educated because you have resorted to name calling. How adult of you.

@JuddLegum Everyone who has such a horrible experience should have their day in court. There should not be any statute of limitations when it comes to sexual assault in any state and in the federal government. Especially in the Federal Government.
@JuddLegum hmm 35 years ago I was 10 years old. I rode my bike, roller skated, I never tried to attempt rape on anyone and I never stole anything. I was a good girl. Even though I had horrible things done to me.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain It isn't a crime to lie to the press but it is a crime to lie to the Senate in a hearing format. That is why he won't testify in the hearing. All allegations of any crime at any time should be investigated by the FBI RULE OF LAW
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain After all the accused attempted rapist's friend who was supposedly in the room refuses to testify in a Senate hearing... why? He claimes he doesn't remember anything like that however, he isn't under oath right now. He is only speaking to the press.
@LindseyGrahamSC It is the proper order that should be done according to the rules. Are you again ignoring @SenJohnMcCain's request to bring back proper order?

crisis more lawyers need to step up and take on these cases to help these parents and children. Hell, Avenatti has now proven that you don't have to actually specialize in immigration in order to help. Apparently, you just need to get your nose to the grindstone and read books
through. Good for him. There aren't enough immigration lawyers just like there aren't enough immigration judges to process these children and the parents of these children. Trump states that there are thousands of judges when there are only hundreds. I believe that in this
So Michael Avenatti is getting into Immigration law. He has taken on the cases of over 60 immigrant mothers and 70 children over the course of the last two weeks. He also has a whistleblower in ICE getting him information and images and audio of what these children are going

AMERICAN LAWS STATE THAT AS SOON AS THEY ARE ON AMERICAN SOIL THEY CAN CLAIM ASYLUM AND GET A HEARING AND BE VETTED AT THAT TIME AS WELL. LEARN AMERICAN LAWS. TRUMP IS BREAKING OUR LAWS BY TAKING AWAY THOSE RIGHTS BEFORE THE LAWS AR CHANGED.
@jsull123 @Paul65691822 @CGTNOfficial learn the law before you spew. They have a right to due process under American laws. They don't have to cross at the port of entry to claim asylum under American law they are not breaking American's laws. However, Trump is breaking our laws.
@CGTNOfficial @Paul65691822 So those who are crossing and claiming asylum have every right to ask for an asylum hearing to go see a judge and have due process and be vetted which is what happens in these asylum cases. So these people who are disagreeing are wrong they do have rights under American law.
@CGTNOfficial @Paul65691822 They actually don't have to cross the border at any port of entry to be able to claim asylum. People who disagree have a right to disagree with the laws that we have in place however, that is the law of this country.
@CGTNOfficial @Paul65691822  you are correct. What Trump and these supporters who are saying that these ppl have no rights don't understand is that American immigration laws state that if you come into America any place over the border and ask for asylum they are not breaking our laws.

This white woman who is a Republican voted for Hillary Clinton because she was the lesser of 2 evils. She would not have hurt America the way this ass hole has and I am not ashamed of my vote
@realDonaldTrump Funny how they actually care about the United States Economy because you sure as hell don't care about it unless it only affects yours and your families pocketbooks.
@realDonaldTrump It is YOUR fault they are having to move. YOU started the Trade War. I honestly hope that Canada and the EU figure out how they can go after yours and your family business all alone. They are looking at the Magnisky Act as a way to go after YOU and not the whole USA.

@davidaxelrod @POTUS Nevada is one of those more diverse districts. Senator Dean Heller is running for re election. Is Trump cutting his throat? Trump was just here on the 23rd giving a nick name to Hellers opponant. He doesn't have nick names for all the other opponants of the Republicans.
@davidaxelrod @MaxineWaters that does include voting but it also includes protesting them to show them that we wont sit back and take it anymore.
@davidaxelrod @MaxineWaters The Trump Administration is a huge bully to ALL Americans (even his supporters who are not in the 1% club of the weathy) It is time to fight back and not just take it. It is time to Protest them from being bullies to immigrants and American's.
@davidaxelrod @MaxineWaters As much as I also don't agree with what Maxine Waters said, however, I disagree with what you are stating as well. We were divided before all of these protests. I don't agree with harassment of the people of the Trump Administration but I DO agree with Protesting them @ evry turn

Agreed. However, the "Spygate" rhetoric is only a PR stunt because it seems Trump and his team only think the Muller investigation is to get him impeached. But no it isn't. The Muller investigation is to get him with Criminal Charges. Much more than just impeachment. https://t.co/ZGCmpqp9EU
Agreed https://t.co/ZGCmpqp9EU
@JillWineBanks the reason Muller and his team doesn't leak or let the press know what is going on in the investigation except through court orders is that they are not investigating for impeachment proceedings. They are investigating to get CRIMINAL CHARGES.

@JMillerCongress And as a White woman, I am disgusted by many in my own race as well. Not just because of their hate for anyone of different skin color but because White people seem to be the fasted ones to try to find a backdoor to not have to work hard for their money.
@JMillerCongress Getting rid of the programs that are helping people get back on their feet is wrong. I have seen the majority of those people that use those programs are mostly white people btw not Hispanics or African-Americans or any other race for that matter.
@JMillerCongress Trump is taking all programs that are actually helping people even though most Rep's don't think so they are actually helping most Americans to get back on their feet. They seem to want to stop the programs because of the minority of small bad apples.
@JMillerCongress While I didn't like some of his policies he still did a lot to protect the American people. Now is the time to stop giving the Reps a taste of their own medicine and to start working together. Get Dumb Trump out of office as well because he is destroying America

@ChrisCuomo It should be easier to vote and not harder. But laws do need to be in place in order to make sure that they are legally able to vote in those elections.
@ChrisCuomo Election Days also should be a Federal Holiday so that everyone can get the chance to vote if they want to vote. Also, every state should have the option to vote from home with the mail-in ballots if the Election days are not a Federal Holiday.
@ChrisCuomo In Nevada, every single person who turns 18 has to get their ID no matter what. So why would it be radical to say everyone has to be registered to Vote? It isn't saying that they have to vote but just be registered to vote.
@CyrusMMcQueen Saying their are colorblind when it comes to peoples skin color means that they look at people as people no matter skin color because everyone is different and human.
@CyrusMMcQueen Sorry, you feel that way. But then you truly don't understand the meaning of the term colorblindness in this case. It is not disingenuous or problematic. It is a shorter way of saying that they don't see a difference in people just because of the color os their skin.
Vote Dem or for those who do not support Trump and his crime family ties. They can start the impeachment process in November.
First of all, there are term limits on the President of the USA. He won't be a sitting President the rest of his life. He can always be indicted after this. But that report also can cause him to be impeached before his first term is up. https://t.co/ZD3TU9fdBz
