On September 15, 1971, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew presented Anderson‚Äôs family with a Congressional Medal of Honor. Anderson is laid to rest at Forest Park Cemetery in Houston. God bless this brave Marine who gave his life for our freedom.
He did not relent, providing heavy fire against the enemy. He was wounded again before a fellow Marine made it to him to administer first aid-he continued to fire at the enemy. When a grenade landed between Anderson &amp; the Marine, Anderson hurled his body onto the grenade.
The TX Veteran who was selected as the honoree for this home‚Äôs designation gave his life in Vietnam to save a fellow Marine. LCpl Richard A. Anderson died valiantly on August 24, 1969, in South Vietnam. Reports tell us Anderson was on patrol when his unit was suddenly attacked.

This study is about protecting people, our economy and our national security. The options selected are proven to be effective in mitigating the deadly effects of storm surge on our state. I thank @USACEHQ and look forward to continuing this vital cooperative effort.
The Coastal Texas Study provides solutions to safeguard and revitalize our coastline, thus protecting our public safety and economic drivers. Texas‚Äô coast is home to 1 in every 4 Texans and 30% of the American oil refining sector resides here.
Texas is not just a state that happens to have a coast. Texas is a true coastal state. One storm can cost many lives and billions of dollars in damage, so the expense of doing nothing far outweighs the investment to protect and enhance our coast.
