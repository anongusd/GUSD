Deep down, you know exactly what you are capable of. 		There are even moments where you get a glimpse of all of the potential you have. 		You can get there.		You just have to be willing to sacrifice the habits, things and situations that are standing in the way of your success.

@RagnarC30 Yep cause it doesn’t really mean anything. It’s not even an olive branch. It’s bullshit really lol.
If it’s true that #Trump plans to offer a Bridge Act for #Dreamers it would not provide a pathway to citizenship. It would only allow ppl eligible for—or who already have— #DACA to receive work authorization &amp; provisional protected presence.
Longest shutdown in US history. 800,000 federal workers w/out pay rn b/c #Trump wants to spend billions of taxpayers money to build a wall, disparaging a beautiful country and promoting fear &amp; racism. 		We don’t need a wall. 		We need an honest leader that evokes unification. 💯

There will be a new film adaption of The Witches. That film terrified me as a kid and now they’re remaking it with  Anne Hathaway. Nightmares do come true. https://t.co/A6tYD9OOGZ
#GilletteAd... watching it again and not sure what the big deal is... there are men out there that feel a certain way about this? Why? Just be a man with class and integrity. Have a nice shave. I love the msg. Makes me wonder about the ones who don’t.
My mind drifts again... wtf is going on with Soulja Boy and wtf does he keep showing up in my trending topics?... Cardi B has a new music video...😳...
@FlyingPhotog I heard that’s quite the mindf*ck
I realize it’s 2019 and I’m typing this one a smartphone. I can just google it. I choose not to because I’m afraid the real answer might be one of those “it’s up to you” endings. I need definitive endings to this particular film though. Just this one.
My mind drifts... to... Inception. I watched it again the other day, realizing movies change meanings to you over time. Then I think about the ending. Does the stop spinning I wonder. Does it? DOES IT?
The owner and the waiter disappear for a “talk”. It is what it is. But kind of surprised about how friendly it got between man/waiter. I wish the world was always like this. Ppl being more respectful to one another vs the opposite.
The waiter apologies for what happened earlier. Literally explains that he’s new and hates working here. The owner is in earshot, gives me a beer (but I asked for sake?).
Not judging per say but I must admit... the man rubbed me the wrong way off the bat and now I’m amazed at how polite he is with the waiter. The waiter must have noticed the shift because he jokes around with the man. Tells him a story. They’re friendly with each other now.
The man sits somewhere else. The waiter comes. The man isn’t ready to order. But he’s actually incredibly polite now. He’s checked himself. Now THE waiter is annoyed. They have another exchange. The waiter and this man are not feeling each other one bit. I watch closely.
If I were the man I would turn up. Butc what the man doesn’t know (that I do... I come here too much I’m realizing). The waiter is new. Like “2 days in” new. He had a confrontation with the owner the other day and hates this place. The only waiter here tonight.
A man enters with his daughter. He waits to be seated next to a dirty table. But the waiter takes a while... a long while to come back. Actually never does. The man is annoyed as all hell. I wonder why he doesn’t just sit somewhere else. I’m nosey af.
It’s raining in Los Angeles. It rarely rains. But it’s been a pain in the ass the last few days. I decide to walk to a nearby sushi bar so I can read a book over a drink. It’s been quite a day.

Real issues...		Climate change is a threat. 	Racism, sexism, anti-semitism is a growing concern. 	Mental health is an issue.	Gun violence is a problem. 	30 mil Americans have no health insurance. WTF?	40 mil Americans are being waxed by student debt. HUH?
So is this wall going to be concrete or steel? 	Paid for by Mexico or honest tax paying Americans? 	Will it cost $5.7 billion to create or $67 billion? 	Who. The. F**k. Asked. For. A. Wall? 	#TrumpAddress
These lies and distortions of reality from #Trump come from a mentality of hate and fear. We don't need that. The US is a nation of immigrants. We don’t need to make up any fake crises. We have enough real ones we need to get serious about tackling.

@JamesVirtus I think this year we’ll see more to attack those very concerns you have.
If you have any trends of your own you’d like to share from your respective field, please share. 🙏
12. A.I. and predictive analytics will not replace the human when it comes to delivering the customer experience. While there are definitely some great opportunities ahead for #AI will not be a true game-changer (at least in 2019).
11. #InfluencerMarketing delivers 11x higher ROI than traditional forms of digital marketing and 94% of marketers thinks this is an effective tactic. Also, Nano Influencers (as low as 1,000 are being courted).
10. #Marketing becomes increasingly personal. No longer will stock images, generic nurturing campaigns or impersonal calls to action convince consumers. In order to succeed, you'll have to provide high-value and personalized content every step of the way.
9. (Cont’d) ...spirituality providing an alternative lifestyle; a new era for teenage hedonism. An intuitive approach to visualizing stress and anxiety; how to prepare for an opt-out internet; controlled stimulants offering intoxication for health-conscious consumers.
9. Mental Health is a key topic of concern. This is what’s going to happen to respond: educational platforms to promote self-care; peer-to-peer news networks; reclaiming flaws to fight cyberbullying; pocket money for underaged entrepreneurs;
8. #DigitalNomad life on the rise - 4.8 million Americans describe themselves as digital nomads. Among traditional U.S. workers, 27% said they "might" become digital nomads in the next 2-3 yrs. 11% said they planned to.
7. Growing public consciousness of #sustainability issues &amp; political leadership gaps will increasingly open the way for businesses to step up to the challenge. Customers are also increasingly likely to look for a brand that better aligns with their values.
6. Social Media - The Facebook Newsfeed will shift to Stories, there will be less emphasis on follower counts, elimination of spam accounts and fake followers. With growing fatigue we will also see a trend of monitored use.
5. Will #crypto rise? According to PwC, the demand for services related to blockchain advisory was as high as $1.7 billion in 2018. Out of the 2000 cryptocurrencies almost 1000 are found to be dead and/or a scam.
4. The economic strength of Black &amp; Latino consumers is on the rise, representing the two largest multicultural market groups &amp; accounting for a combined $2.5 trillion in annual purchasing power .
3. 80% of what we consume online will be video content in 2019.
2. #Chatbots make it easy to quickly interact with audiences in a way that feels personal. By 2020, more than 85% of all customer service interactions will be powered by #AI bots.
1. In 2019, CEOs and other company leaders need to use social media to share their insights, connect with their community, and listen to their audience.

15. Always have gratitude. 		Bonus: remember what you put out into the universe is what you get back in all things in life.
14. Always show compassion. Especially for the people you think don’t deserve it (we all deserve it btw). We’re all going through our own journey. Remember that.
13. Social Media wasn’t created for us to show a highlight reel. It was created to connect with one another. Connect more. Show off less.
12. Don’t worry about what you get out of it. Worry more about what you’re contributing.
11. Think back at the toughest moment of your life. If you’re reading this, know that you survived it and you can survive anything moving forward. 💯
10. The most common regret people have on their deathbed is not going after what they really wanted in their life and caring too much about what other people think. 		Do you, champ.
9. You’re going to fail no matter how much you don’t want to, put something off, plan ahead, etc. Might as well go for it. At least then you’ll have nothing to regret.
8. The treasure you seek is in the work you’re avoiding.
7. Don’t talk about plans. Just do it. Show the results.
6. When you’re faced with obstacles that you think will destroy you... remember it’s an opportunity to apply what YOU learned and show the universe what YOU are made of.
5. Expect nothing in return. Nothing is ever guaranteed or owed to you (even if you think it is). 		Accepting that gives you freedom.
4. You are worthy of happiness. Even if at times you think you’re not. You are.
3. Sunrises and sunsets are gorgeous anywhere on the planet. https://t.co/AMX9KLQNqJ
2. There are 365 days in a year. 86400 sec. in a day. Which means you have more time than you think you do to create the live you always envisioned for yourself. Every second is your own and no one else’s.
1. The past has already happened. Great memories are what they are. Painful ones too. The future has not been written yet. You have the power to create the life you want for yourself at any given moment.
I learned some valuable lessons in #2018. I’d love to share with you. (A thread? 🤔😂)
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.

@ann_eliza56 @JamesGunn He did hold himself accountable and issued an apology yrs ago when you didn’t know who he was. Now you do and you want to go in on him for some dumb shit that doesn’t reflect the man today. Silly.
This trailer was hard af. Been waiting for this for a hot minute. https://t.co/Crvr1eA9pl
RT @noctokaz: @cjjohnsonjr @JamesGunn Not to mention he had apologized back in 2012 and Disney knew this.
ESPECIALLY after he helped Marvel grow into a new direction just as it was starting to get whack. Gunn is good ppl and helped a lot of indie filmmakers like myself back in the day. So, I’m more than annoyed at how this situation evolved.
I’m a HUGE supporter of @JamesGunn &amp; if you followed his career before Marvel came into the picture you would know he had a very provocative/edgy style. He’s evolved since then as a person &amp; as a creative. Lame ass tweets from the way back machine shouldn’t get him fired. https://t.co/ye6kacRx1I
