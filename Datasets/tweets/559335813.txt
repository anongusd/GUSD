A6. In the book - what we did was seek out writers who had access to communities that none of the editors had intersections in, so that we would communally understand more. This is important. Knowledge is not individual. #RecLaPressAuthors
A6. Another thing was the neuroqueer stuff - you can see the intro writings on that -especially https://t.co/QPzlaKfrE8 #RecLaPressAuthors
A6. Probably the best thing I wrote was directly about my intersectionality. For the book @Criptiques https://t.co/7GFhfMZ22E (which you really want to buy a copy or your library is incomplete - but they let you have a pdf at that url) see page 11. #RecLaPressAuthors
RT @RecLaPress: Q6. How do you address intersectionality in your writing? Do you include your own intersections?  #RecLaPressAuthors

A5. For us in education writing in disability we particularly wanted to hear from a wider range of voices, to make the questions larger and bolder. #RecLaPressAuthors

@inaspectrum I don't think so. "They know not what they do" seems to like they're too ignorant to be blamed, not that they are inoffensive.
@CocoPazzo lol!
Important question: does anyone know what "this has been a post" means? I often see it after a post was posted that was obviously a post.
@GOPofToday a symptom of my disability is that I am rarely able to get bored. You are boring me despite my impairment. Congratulations!
@GOPofToday yes, I do have a disability. Does that make you feel superior? I'm sure your mother is very proud.
@GOPofToday there you go. Finally you are honest. Now you can go home.
@GOPofToday are you bragging about corrupt police who kill white people too? It is lucky for police you are not in charge of their PR!
@GOPofToday it is actually not witty to use insults made of ableist slurs. I do have a developmental disability. And you have ignorance.
@GOPofToday he didn't call me, but now that he is dead it looks like running was a very logical choice indeed.
@GOPofToday because he is Black. Really. Google is your friend.
@GOPofToday so he called you and told you this, or are you psychic? By the way, even if you're pro-deathpenalty, are these capital offenses?

@GOPofToday or because he was afraid he might die in custody. Did he call you and tell you why he ran?
@GOPofToday it is complicated and systematic. I think you should Google it. Twitter is too brief to say much.
@Edwardsthegreat Chicago has problems and therefore it is "hypocrisy" to see problems anywhere else? Unfortunate logic for today's world.
@GOPofToday false arrest and false imprisonment due to racial profiling are wrong. Killing people "accidentally" when abusing them is wrong.
@GOPofToday I think you are confusing noticing something with creating it. It was a racial issue long before I was even born.
@VanityByNature thank you!! The trolls lol: Apparently more injustice shows that injustice is just, and saying murder is wrong=killing cops.
@Edwardsthegreat are you trying to show that the system is not corrupt by citing more corruption? Interesting logic.
@GOPofToday I'm not sure where injustice comes from. That doesn't make it just.
@Baracademy101 of course cop lives matter. Are they being put to death? What is your comparison?

I never watch debates. Why waste my time when I can just tally up the votes of the major journalists in "who won" listicles?
I thought I knew what I thought about things, but on the way to work I saw some lawn signs. This changes everything.
I have to keep constant tallies of tweets and posts to know who to vote for and what to believe. Thank goodness there is an app for that.
I'm totally changing my vote and all my beliefs since someone made an announcement on Facebook that they might unfriend people who disagree.

@AuerbachKeller @jmwhiteSYR adding: watch Wretches and Jabberers, read Typed Words Loud Voices, brush up on how IEPs really work. More later
@AuerbachKeller @jmwhiteSYR OK. So far: look closer at what Pam Block said to quote her right, interview typers, don't rely on known fraud.

@AuerbachKeller I have to go now but will check back in later in case I can help. Have you seen book Typed Words Loud Voices? Read it please
@AuerbachKeller do you have a list of who is involved that you tried to contact? If I'm connected with any of them, maybe I can get answers
@AuerbachKeller I should look into that. If people are forcing, they are doing bad action, not best practice at all. They should be stopped
@AuerbachKeller also "direct instruction" (scripted behavioral training) and ABA should not be forced- nor high-stakes testing.
@AuerbachKeller that is actually very important. I agree with you. Nothing should ever be forced on students. Is this happening?
@AuerbachKeller Many others use minimal support or none now. Their testimony is what got me to see it is sure not harmful to hear them.
@AuerbachKeller also wish you'd interviewed Hope Block and quoted Pamela Block more precisely, with less error.
@AuerbachKeller I think it was a mistake in your article to rest so much on believing a known fraud who was caught. Of course she deflects.
@AuerbachKeller I have a friend for whom FC was useless, who now thrives with RPM. It really does matter who the person is, what they need.
@AuerbachKeller such as high-stakes testing and one-size-fits-all curricular thinking.
@AuerbachKeller medical EBP looks at the patient, also anecdotes &amp; case histories. If educators understood that, many ills would be fixed.
@AuerbachKeller yes. He is an educator rather than a medical doctor, so I believe he's using it in the narrow, less useful way I described.
@AuerbachKeller we still allow people to go to talk therapists &amp; use sign language - not true that one bad apple spoils all: remove bad ones
@AuerbachKeller or the fact that also in the 90s, regular talk therapists were reporting extra unreal memories in the satanic ritual fad.
@AuerbachKeller and I sure don't believe frauds are able to cause a think never to work. Think of the sign language debacle in South Africa
@AuerbachKeller it is harmful when wrongdoers pervert practices, but I'm not sure I believe them when they say their fraud was "unwitting"
@AuerbachKeller I can tell you about my position and how I came to it. Preview: https://t.co/q65JzrNWyk
@AuerbachKeller it is as if educators are trying to test math skills with spelling tests: just doesn't fit. Medical tests are medical.
@AuerbachKeller 2/2 and justify silencing and depriving people who benefit from teaching that does not fit the drug protocol paradigm.
@AuerbachKeller by designing quasi-experiments and defining "what works" in particular ways, educators can show that abuse "works" 1/2 (ABA)
@AuerbachKeller ..2/2 idea was detrimentally oversimplified. What EBP means in my field is thus narrow and not very useful.
@AuerbachKeller you asked about evidence based practice. In medicine, EBP takes into account the actual patient. But in education 1/2 cont..
@AuerbachKeller not at this time, but when they are done writing about it and solidifying with their board I will.
@carolinehearst @Doktor_Huh I'd ask you to produce evidence that you're speaking for yourself, but I think you're better off disavowing hate
@carolinehearst so you talked at her when she obv wasn't feeling well. You're right: you are more of an expert on her than she is /sarcasm
@WileyAutLibrary @carolinehearst perhaps you believe you'll make more money as an "expert" if you cater to #ableism. Perhaps, but it's evil.

@AuerbachKeller will respond more then
@AuerbachKeller I will have more time Sunday. Thanks for contacting me. Now must go feed the kids :)
@AuerbachKeller I do hope they will. It is within the mission. They should. But not yet, no.
@AuerbachKeller ABA, which is abusive and can cause PTSD, is on the other hand, "evidence-based." Sometimes people know their own experience
@AuerbachKeller it is not harmful to people who learned typing from it. Wish you'd researched deeper.
@AuerbachKeller waiting to see what their new statement says. I hope they do, but we should wait and see. Why didn't you interview typers?
@Plinz I do not know the people in that case, but I edited a book with typer @AmySequenzia called Typed Words, Loud Voices so am up on topic
@Plinz not you, sorry. I was talking about the lazy, unresearched hatchet job Auerbach did in Slate. Now he's trolling people to top it off.
In which @AuerbachKeller interprets "human rights &amp; quality of life" as "FC." He's closer now, but still half-cocked https://t.co/lBXizaVBz8
@AndrewBLeh @AuerbachKeller @TASHtweet @SWIFTSchools don't give this "journalist" ideas - he may decide to create expert lies and quote you.
@AuerbachKeller @Plinz what is your angle? Why the vendetta against people already marginalized? It's a shame.
@NYMag @AuerbachKeller sad &amp; enraging that this "journalist" refused to interview typers who made themselves available, misquoting others.
@RCScience @AuerbachKeller @Slate please stop bullying disabled people and our families now. Also, learn to do responsible research.
