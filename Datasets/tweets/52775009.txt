Maybe if the funds from #Prop29 instead went to help ensure our K-12 edu. system doesn't fall apart, CA kids would know why not to smoke.
@Wakida2012 My point is why not alleviate the state's medical debts now before we start trying to prevent medical debts in the future?
#Prop29 logic: Let's take $735million from CA's ailing economy and spend it on programs w/ intended results w/ no guarantee of materializing
@Wakida2012 Wouldn't the money generated from Prop 29 be better used to help the poor get those cancer treatments?

If only smokers are taxed, shouldn't only smoking-related cancer be researched? Vote NO on #Prop29
