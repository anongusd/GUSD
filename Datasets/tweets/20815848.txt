@BobLogIV Very unlucky. Hey, tippet without injuries might have been an amazing player.	Luck is a huge factor. So i'll happily concede that. 	Agreed with Naismith over Nank as well.	But if we didn't have Tippett on the books, we might have kept both.	And had the $$ for titch.
@BobLogIV Yeah, he ended up being a decent ruckman. Fair call. 		So we then trade out Nankervis... for him to get injured again and Nank to be the engine to roll the tigers to a premiership.		And half a season of decent ruck play... was that really worth the huge salary cap hit?
@BobLogIV It's true... you're right.	He's a polarising figure.	Can't be too harsh because he's been injury prone.	But he's been a HUGE cap hit for the production. Esp during the COLA reduction period.	I can't really recall any games he's won off his boot.

@RalphyHeraldSun The @AFL is missing the point of the head high contact rule. To protect the head.	If the umps see any player (esp a selwood) FORCE a high contact to the head they should be penalised for it.

@TheLadfromAus And he's now gone.	Concussed.	#AFLDonsCrows
@stevenjamesmid1 @RalphyHeraldSun Spat out blood. 	Pretty good indication he's been hit in the head.	Also now out of the game.
@healyhp Ok, blood in the mouth from the hit... pretty good indication it did hit his head.	Vid doesn't look like his head was hit though.
@BeefaBeyer06 Ok, blood in the mouth from the hit... pretty good indication it did hit his head.
@TheLadfromAus Punishment against the victim is huge with one player less.
@BeefaBeyer06 That was a solid hit though. I don't blame him for being down for a while.	At least he didn't get stretchered off like in soccer üòÇ
@TheLadfromAus I'd say yes.	Even if it happens 10 mins later.
@BeefaBeyer06 Yeah, take that back. That was a good hit! üòÇ	Lucky merret turned :)
Ump needs to pull merrett OFF the field. NOW!	He's concussed!	And the bloke that hit him... should get a red card and be sent off too.	#AFLDonsCrows
This ain't the NFL where a no one knows what a catch is...	That was a bloody mark!	#AFLDonsCrows
