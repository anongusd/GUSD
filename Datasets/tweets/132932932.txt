A6: 1/2 We’ve been working with HIV advocates across the country to share resources &amp; raise awareness. We sent letters to all state Attorneys General and Insurance Commissioners urging them to investigate the lack of transparency associated with copay accumulator.  #CoPaysCount
A5: 2/2 If you are comfortable, share your story with your local news outlet and contact your state’s Insurance Commissioner to submit a complaint on the negative impact accumulators have on patient health. #CopaysCount
A5: 1/2 File a complaint with your health insurer and if you receive your coverage from your employer, speak to your HR department and tell them how harmful these polices are for employees.  #CoPaysCount

A1: Due to high deductibles &amp; patient cost-sharing, copay assistance makes #Rx for #HIV treatment and prevention, like #PrEP, &amp; #HepatitisC cures affordable. Without copay assistance, patients face thousands of $ in unexpected costs, impacting adherence &amp; health. #CopaysCount
