@dcexaminer @DonaldJTrumpJr @jaredkushner I don't think it will come from Mueller, Barr is stopping the investigation because Trump wants him to.

I don't know if that is the reason, I think it's more that he doesn't want to piss off his base because the White nationalists/supremacist is his base.  That's why he only mentions the (any race but white) who do something wrong. https://t.co/6LDZGX7vR9
@djrothkopf @Kris_Sacrebleu True, but Trump just pay's them off with thousands of $$$$ and a NDA contract. . Because the girls are desperate for $$$$ or have been threatened into signing, they just do it because they want it all to be over.  Problem is, they don't stop and never get punished

@LcarlleyLora @HillaryClinton Oh geez, get over it!  Do you think it's her fault?  NOT!!  It's an IT Network Security person that should be blamed for this.

@SethAbramson unless someone admits to it, which I doubt anyone will admit to it.  According to Trump...Repubs had better security on their network for less money.
@SethAbramson ...Basically, this is a huge IT breach and can be brushed off as the Dems didn't have good Network Security which in turn will blame just the Russians for the breach in data from the Dems servers, they will not be able to prove any Repubs called for the hack...
@SethAbramson https://t.co/IrQiptEATn  I don't think they will ever find out who asked the Russians to get the data, I work in IT and had to deal with Data Breach prevention PCIDSS and PII and HIPPA which all has to do with personal data.

@SpeakerPelosi Their Compliance officers can come out and evaluate the network and come back with a report on what needs to be done and they will even help your Network Security Officers get the network secure.

@SenJackyRosen What is going on with the Mueller Investigation?  Barr comes on staff now it's all over.  You can sure tell where Barr's loyalty is.  I'm ready to protest, TRUMP NEEDS TO GO!
@SethAbramson I understand we don't know everything but Barr comes on staff and all of a sudden Mueller is giving his final report.  This is Trump calling the shots, he has taken over our country and is doing what ever the Fuck he wants. Trump is the biggest piece of shit.
@SpeakerPelosi What is going on?  Mueller can't be done!  Trump is trying to make the investigation go away with Barr (who obviously gave his loyalty to Trump)  This is total BS and the American people are going to want answers or Trump gone.  i'm really pissed right now.

@SenKamalaHarris Wouldn't it be cool if all Democratic Presidential Hopeful's ran against Pence and never even mentioned Trump's name, like completely ignore him?
@realDonaldTrump You're approval rating is no where near 50%, you're loosing Republicans too.  Bye Bye Putin Puppet, you will be trading in your XXX Large tailored suits for XXXL Striped ones soon.  Maybe they will put you on the chain gang and we will get work out of you.

@realDonaldTrump @tommcclintock You're just about as idiotic as the POTUS re-tweeting his crap tweets
@realDonaldTrump lol
@realDonaldTrump you wish
@realDonaldTrump @tommcclintock NO WALL
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump This seriously makes me laugh.  Trumps new suit will be stripes.
@dbongino @realDonaldTrump LOL how you feeling with all the indictments?  shocking how wrong this book is huh?  you're next Putin Puppet, you can believe the words of people who don't know the facts all you want.  When your new suit is stripes, maybe reality will sink in!!!!!!!
RT @JustCurious37: And this is really upsetting former Trump supporters who voted for the snake oil salesman based on this policy alone. Pe‚Ä¶
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump humm, wonder how you're going to look in strips, all the while, protecting daddy dearest from his new striped suit.
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump LOL, are you kidding me?  You have opened the US up to Dictators looking to harm US and to producing Nuks to kill us, that WALL will never protect us against a NUK.  You're an idiot!!!!
@realDonaldTrump You need to get off the WALL and start doing something positive for this country.  Like fixing the Tax Policy you put in place, glad to see it only top 1% benefited and you don't care about the rest of the 99% of Americans.
@realDonaldTrump By the way, stop separating the Democrats out of the American people, your own party is turning on you too, maybe instead of causing separation, you should focus on bringing America together.  I am tired of your tweets, go to work and do your job.
@realDonaldTrump Where is the link to this so called gallop poll...or are you making shit up again?
@realDonaldTrump I actually believe it's you that wants a Shutdown.
@realDonaldTrump Trump, you need to give up on the Wall.  We need border security!  Instead create a path to return the children to their families that you separated.  You need to become a different president or you will loose in the end.
@SethAbramson Made me cry
@realDonaldTrump We want border security, we don't want a Wall, get that straight
@realDonaldTrump Stop calling people names, degrading people is not becoming of the POTUS.  Why do you continue to this?  As long as you keep calling people names, I will continue calling you names.
@realDonaldTrump You disgust me, sick, perverted, narcissistic, bipolar, uneducated, fake bone spur, horrible president, horrible person, bully, name calling, and dividing our country, person.  You haven't done one thing that has been good for the American people, you only think of yourself.
@realDonaldTrump did Mueller say this?  No, quit grabbing at straws, you know you and your family did wrong and you will do anything to cover your wrong doings up.
@realDonaldTrump Can't we just call American's American's?  Every ones blood is red, we are uniquely the same, yet uniquely different looking, but we are equally American.
@SethAbramson üëá	https://t.co/Cz6UZ4uSwf
@realDonaldTrump You are a cheater and liar.  You need to resign so the American people can start the recovery process and regain our standing in the world.  Go away now, I am so done with you.  You don't belong in office, you are harming us not helping.  RESIGN
@realDonaldTrump You sold us out to the Dictators of the world, we are now the weakest country in the world because of you.
@realDonaldTrump You will never be a dictator in America Trump.  Once everyone starts doing their taxes, the American people will realize you lined your pocket's and the top 1% but the rest of us got F'd.  You are a horrible person who only thinks about himself and his own pocket book.
@HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseGOP  We need Tax Reform for the Poor and Middle Class, Trumps Tax Reform only gave the top 1% relief but now we in the Lower 99% have to pay more.  This isn't what he promised.  Please fix this.

@AOC How many of the American Middle Class got their taxes done and were disappointed when they found out they couldn‚Äôt take deductions they used to get and their tax return amount was way less then last year?
@realDonaldTrump All the different polls I‚Äôve seen this week show you in the 30ish percentile.

@SenateGOP @houseGOP Its horrible to know that if you are born into wealth you have more opportunity then average Americans and only few average Americans are offered Scholarships to get the Higher education.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP We need Higher Education for all without the American people going into debt to get Higher Education.  More programs for Single Mothers/Fathers, more programs to help the poor get the Higher Education.  Rich get Richer, Poor get Poorer.
@SenateGOP @USDOL Low paying jobs, SMH.  Rich are getting Richer, Poor are getting Poorer.  More Homeless then I have ever seen here in Reno, Nevada.  Disabled, Elderly, Vets on the street because they can't afford a place to live.  Reality Check yourself, we are still suffering down here.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP You all are so out of touch about what is really going on, it amazes me that you are all tweeting how good things are when we don't see it down here in the lower half.  We can't afford to live anymore, housing is too high to afford with the low wages.
@SenateGOP @housegop The companies being brought into Nevada and the people moving here has drove our housing market and now we have more homeless then I have ever seen before (Reno) older people, disabled people living on the streets because they can't afford housing.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP In Nevada, they brought in all these Tech companies here, but the problem with these companies is they only higher for the low wage jobs from the local population, all the high paying jobs are being filled from outside Nevada.
@SenateGOP @DHSgov @HouseGOP The wall would have never caught this, border security and dogs did.  Wouldn't it be nice to have more surveillance equipment that would catch more?  The wall makes no since, they just climb over or dig under the wall.  Forget the Wall.
@SenateGOP 3% LOL  and how much did the Top 20% gain?  Way more then that!  Results for whom?  The top 20%, we down here in the lower 80% still have to work 2 and 3 jobs to make ends meet, our families suffer because we are not around, we are working long days/hours.  Help!
@SenateRPC @SenateGOP The Pay for said jobs is not keeping up with the cost of living, people have to work 2 to 3 jobs just to make ends meet.  Meanwhile, the Rich get richer.  We are still struggling down here in the lower 80%, help us so we don't have to work so hard to make ends meet.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP What about Tax relief for the lower 80% of the population, the Rich are getting Richer and the Middle Class and below are getting poorer.  It's not fair!  Trump needs to go!
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP What about getting a real Republican Candidate to run for office that has some intelligence, who doesn't lie on a daily basis, who isn't into bragging on himself, who doesn't dog the CIA, DOJ, etc.  Sick of this man!  Get him out!
@HouseGOP With Trump consuming all his time with the Wall.  What about other things that are more important, like Healthcare, like background checks to purchase guns, etc.  I'm about sick of the unneeded wall talk, lets get down to business and get some real things done.
@SenateGOP With Trump consuming everything with the Wall, I hear nothing on the issues that really matter, what about Health Care, what about extensive background checks to Purchase Guns, what about the issues that really matter?  What are you doing about these issues?

@realDonaldTrump I watched the UN Meeting today and other countries have taken in thousands of people and helped them, why can't you?  You've seen the crisis that is happening in the Central American countries and you know why these people are fleeing their country.
@realDonaldTrump By the way, their is no Emergency except a humanitarian one at the border and you are so Hell Bent on the wall you can't see the desperate need of the people sitting in Tents on the Mexican side of the border.
@MikeTokes @realDonaldTrump LOL, are you delusional?  He can't do anything but watch himself sink to the depths.  All he can say is "Witch Hunt" and calling Hillary "Crooked Hillary".  He's good at being childish.

@roesel_steve @timkaine No it wasn't, it was McConnell, he wouldn't let any bill go to the house floor to be voted on.  Pay attention!
@timkaine You need to remember this in 21 days and compromise.
@realDonaldTrump You really need to show your compassion, you're loosing ratings fast and will continue to loose ratings if you keep the path your currently on.
@realDonaldTrump You need to suck it up and forget about the wall, we need border security personnel, surveillance equipment, more humanity towards the people seeking asylum, doctors that are more readily available, more Immigration personnel.  COMPROMISE!
@steph93065 @tygergem @ClayRyder4 @realDonaldTrump The majority of illegals in the US are people who overstayed their Visa's, the number is actually very low at the Southern Border.  Canadian Border has more Illegals coming in then  the Southern Border.
@SenateGOP We the Ppl of the US, in Order to form a more perfect Union, est Justice, insure dom Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the gen Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Libty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and est this Constitution for the USA
@SenateGOP I ask you all to please stop dividing the country by party lines and do what is right for this country.  Frankly, I am tired of the politics of our government.  We are counting on you to represent the American people, not Trump.
@SenateGOP America doesn't treat people like we are treating the people seeking help.  Why are you allowing this to happen?  Why don't you all go down to Mexico and find out why they are coming here, these people are families with Kids that need our help
@SenateGOP from 2000 the amount of immigrants has dropped 80% with the exception of this year and that is due to the turmoil of the Central American Countries.  I believe that what we are doing to the people at the So Border is horrible
@SenateGOP To Senate Republicans, I do not feel a Wall is going to protect us, we already have spent a lot of money on the existing wall.  It doesn't stop people from getting into the country.  They climb over it or dig a tunnel under it, what's the point
@realDonaldTrump I don't think in the history of this country have we had a worst president then you.  You really need to suck it up and forget about the damn wall, it isn't necessary.  They just climb over it or dig tunnels under it, but it doesn't stop them from getting in the country.
@JayBrow69431904 @malakusi @CamphorLaevca @KBetter52 @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Any color who is against any other color is a racist.  We all bleed the same color, red.

@TerryPulford @casual2coastal @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump It's working, why fix something that's working.  Since 2000 immigration at the south border has dropped 80%.  Had it increased 80% ,I would say, Yes we have a problem that needs to be addressed.  Plain and simple, Trump Trumped this all up and his ego is so big he can't giveit up
@TerryPulford @casual2coastal @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Its not logical to think that you will be able to stop crime by building a wall.  They just climb over it or dig under it, it doesn't stop them from coming in.  What has stopped them from coming in is Surveillance camera's and Border personnel.
@Funwithpaul @Mom2369738149 @mattboi78 @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump You all keep paying attention to the Wall.  Obviously it's all you think about.  I'm paying attention to the Mueller Investigation now.  Stone is just the scratch of what's to come but the most damning information yet.
@LaineLemon1 @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump And you must listen to Trumpty Dumpty who lies daily to you.
@casual2coastal @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Nope, its that the crimes are committed by every race, quit caping on the Illegals.  They commit less crimes in the US then other races.  It makes no since to bring it.  Believe me, the Family of one of the Reno Murders doesn't like the fact that this is being brought up for Wall

@mmrtyg81 @steph93065 Ok lets bring another subject in...Divert Divert, Kind of like Trump is going so you all Trump Supporters don't see what's happening with the Mueller Investigation.  Now that is a subject we all should be talking about.
@tpiwholesale @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump LOL It's a Humanitarian Crisis.  In 2000 it was worse, it's dropped 80% since then with the exception of this year and those people are fleeing violence in their country.  Trump is treating them as if they are Criminals, but most are families with kids.
@ShariGoedhart @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump I know about this, one of the ladies who was killed was my friends Mother In Law.  This one killer, there was at least 10 other killings here in the last month who were not illegal aliens.  Oh and me was just charged with the Murders today.  and your point is?
@rayetxkl @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump in any bathtub with products you can by at CVS or Wallgreens.  Believe me, I know.  I had one family member die from Herion and I have 2 others addicted to Meth.  I'm not dumb to the Drug thing.  I have had to research a lot about it.  The Drugs are coming in Ports of Entry
@rayetxkl @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Guess what, they dig whole under or climb over the walls, they don't work.  More personnel and more equipment would help.  Most of the drugs Fentana (Spelling?)l is coming in from in from Cargo Ships from China.  and Meth as POTUS said, that can be made...
@rayetxkl @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Most of which got addicted from Prescription Opiods prescribed by a doctor here in the US.  When they got cut off without weening them off, they turned to Herion because Opiods were to expensive to get on the streets.  650 Miles of Walls were build by Trumps predecessors
@SenJohnKennedy Why do you want the Wall, this is a political ploy from Trump that is unnecessary.  You work for the American People not Trump.  You should have voted Yes on the Dems Bill.
@SenMikeLee You should have voted Yes to the Dems bill.
@SenMikeLee I sure wish you all would work for the American People, I don't believe that you are.  If you have a plan, put it on the table.  My thoughts, Trump is a Liar and this isn't a crisis.  Since 2000 the amount of immigrants at the Southern Border has dropped 80%.
@SenTomCotton Why did you not vote for either Bill?  Don't you care about the Government workers who can't feed their kids or pay their Rent/Mortgages?  I think that is week of you do vote no on both bills.
@tapley_kim @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Really, Look at the guy who just killed 5 women in a Bank in Florida.  Look at all the mass shootings that have happened.  White Supremacist!!!!
@realDonaldTrump OPEN OUR GOVERNMENT
@realDonaldTrump SINCE 2000 the amount of people crossing the southern border has dropped 80%, NO CRISIS TRUMP!
@dessndave @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump YOU CAN'T STAND DEMS?  WHY?  I'M A DEMOCRAT AND MY HUSBAND IS BLACK.  REALLY?  YOU ARE NUTS
@dessndave @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump YOU ARE NOT A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE AND CAN'T FEED YOUR KIDS RIGHT NOW
@realDonaldTrump PAY OUR PEOPLE NOW
@realDonaldTrump YOU NEED TO PAY OUR GOVERNMENT WORKERS NOW
@realDonaldTrump YOUR JUST USING THIS WALL TO DIVERT THE AMERICAN PEOPLES THOUGHTS BECAUSE OF THE CHARGES LOOMING OVER YOUR HEAD THAT YOU DON"T WANT THEN TO KNOW ABOUT.  YOUR A CRIMINAL
@realDonaldTrump TRUMP YOU ARE RUINING OUT COUNTRY
@KMCS721 @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump OK Do this, put your paychecks in a new Savings account and don't use it for a month and just live off of what you currently have in your checking and regular savings, how long would it be before you start to suffer and struggle.  Don't be stupid
@Lilly37090961 @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump The majority that I know, they are hard working people just wanting a better life.  SMH
@DonWilson8 @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump MORE ILLEGALS ARE OVERSTAYING THEIR VISA'S
@JohndogDoe @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump YEAH AND THEY GOT THEM USING SURV EQUIPMENT
@Eric45994034 @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?
@JohnRBowers2 @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump THEY WANT BETTER SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT, THERE IS ALREADY 650 MILES OF WALL STARTING FROM THE OCEAN IN SAN DIEGO.  STOP LYING
@JamesJTG @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE COMING IN FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER HAS DROPPED 80% SINCE 2000.  THE MAJORITY OF ILLEGALS ARE PEOPLE WHO OVERSTAY THEIR VISA'S.
@Ruthie96384681 @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump YOU DON"T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, GET OFF FOX FAKE NEWS
@bryanboyne @OMGno2trump @realDonaldTrump I'm listening to them right now live, guess what.  Everyone of them is telling @POTUS to Open the Government without the Wall.
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump More Whites are killing people then Illegals
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump You obviously don't pay attention, what do you think built the existing wall.  MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM WHITE SUPREMACIST EXTREMIST that have come out of the wood work since TRUMP came to office.  Look at the guy who just killed 5 people at the Bank in Florida.
@realDonaldTrump OPEN THE GOVERNMENT NOW!  WE THE PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A SH!T ABOUT YOUR STUPID WALL NOR YOUR REASONS FOR HOLDING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOSTAGE FOR THE WALL.   OPEN THE GOVERNMENT NOW, OPEN THE GOVERNMENT NOW, OPEN THE GOVERNMENT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@senatemajldr Trump's Bill didn't get enough votes to pass, Option 2 Democrats Bill without border wall with 2 weeks funding for Government to negotiate the wall, this one needs to pass so Gov Employees can get paid and work 2 weeks more.  Praying
@Louisebucher3 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi LOL, this has nothing to do with Speaker Pelosi, she has been working hard to get something to the Senate but McConnel wouldn't bring anything to the floor for a Vote because of Trump, well today, McConnell finally decided to bring the vote to the Senate Floor for Vote.  :)
@DianeTroyDiane1 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, I am very well aware of the Murders, I live here.  But when Trump was condeming him, the Washoe and Douglas counties hadn't even charged him yet.  They did this morning.  Did you also hear about the White Supremacy Zeppen Xaver killed 5 people in the back in Florida?
Yes, Finally Senator McConnell is going to bring the bill to the Senate Floor to be voted on.  Thank the Lord! https://t.co/2GAgkYd2RB
@senatemajldr @McConnellPress Thank you for finally bringing the bill to the Senate Floor Senator McConnell.  We the people thank you!  Lets get past this Government Shut Down.  @SpeakerPelosi @SenJackyRosen
@realDonaldTrump @DougWead Action not Talk
@realDonaldTrump They are still finding Nuclear Plants, why are you so trusting of our enemies and not so trusting of our allies?  Putin, Un, Saudi Prince, and others are not looking out for our best interest.
@realDonaldTrump You need to put down your ego and do what is right.  You are punishing our government workers and only harming your chances of ever being re-elected.  Your ratings have dropped to 35% and this is only going to get worse for you.  Your own party is turning against you.
@realDonaldTrump It's time to give up Trump, do it for the American people.  You're not going to win this battle and you are putting not only the American people in peril but also our National Security.
@realDonaldTrump 2/No Speech until the Government is back open.  You need to be respectful of the fact that you are ruining peoples lives right now, they're loosing their places to live, can't feed their families and all you are worried about is being on TV?  SMH
@realDonaldTrump You are addressing Congress with the State of the Union, the Invite comes from the Speaker of the house, you should be respectful of their time as the Government is currently shut down because of you and they are trying to work on a resolution to get the Government back open.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/EtM3ihIv31
@realDonaldTrump You need to RESIGN!
@realDonaldTrump You are about to cause civil war in this country.
@realDonaldTrump DICTATOR!  YOU WILL BE IMPEACHED
@KeepOnTrumpin20 @AntonioOrtizC @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump That is where you are wrong, I want peace for Venezuela.  I also want peace for USA and Trump isn't giving us peace, he is trying to be a dictator.
@AntonioOrtizC @NegriCheli @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Yes, but the people sitting at the US/Mexican border are families, they're not criminals.  Why do you say they're not your people?  They're from your country.
@AntonioOrtizC @NegriCheli @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Trump isn't treating your people right, he is calling your people criminals, drug dealers, terrorists when in fact they are families wanting to escape the violence.
@AntonioOrtizC @NegriCheli @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Trump has separated the kids from parents when they are allowed in and then he deports the parents and the kids remain in deplorable conditions and in cages with only a foil blanket to keep warm with.  Several kids have got sick and died.
@AntonioOrtizC @NegriCheli @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry that your country is having these issues.  I know that the thousands of people sitting at our border would like peace too, Trump wont let them in our country and they are sleeping in Tents unhealthy conditions on the Mexican side of the border.
@AntonioOrtizC @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I do hope peace comes to your country, pray that USA will soon have peace too.
@AntonioOrtizC @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You do realize we don't recognize President Trump and Legitimate and we want to Impeach him?  Him saying this means absolutely nothing.
@realDonaldTrump The latest letter you sent @SpeakerPelosi Nancy Pelosi is uncalled for, it's at her invite for you to speak and she cancelled due to the shut down.  You should respect the request to postpone.  Nancy, please start impeachment on this weirdo.
@realDonaldTrump you need to resign, how you act isn't becoming of a POTUS.  Nancy Pelosi asked you to postpone the State of the Union that is hosted by the House and you are just being a tit for tat @ss.
@SethAbramson I've been saying that all along, he is using the Wall to divert attention to his criminal acts.
@realDonaldTrump You should be uniting the American people, not just the Republican party.  You are tearing our country apart because you do not have the ability to bring the country together, create a calm environment, and look out for all peoples best interest.  You work for all of us.
@realDonaldTrump Give it up, your own party is turning against you, well except McConnell. You need to re-think your position on this.

@senatemajldr What do you not understand, Trump made up a fake crisis at the border because he made campaign promises, but in those promises, he said Mexico would pay for that wall.  We the people don't want to pay for that wall he said Mexico would pay for.

@realDonaldTrump Softer but you should just admit you made up the Crisis because it really was massively on the decline from your predecessors.  I think you just hate admitting you're wrong.  Humility is a fact of life and only makes you a better person in the eyes of the American people.
@realDonaldTrump OMG, you are so into yourself.  Why do you feel you have to tell/show everyone, let your actions speak for itself.  That's what the American people want.  This constant I'm so great attitude is getting OLD!
@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump You didn't give anything, you just gave back what you took away to begin with.  SMH
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You can tell more about a person by what he says about others than you can by what others say about him. ~Leo Aikman
@GeraldoRivera You're a good investigative reporter Geraldo, maybe you should Fact Check BuzzFeed.  Start by cross referencing the BuzzFeed Report to Indictments that have already been made public.  How far off is their claim?
@realDonaldTrump You are the worst President the United States we have ever had.  You are full of fluff with no data to back up your claims, you consistently lie to the American people on a daily basis.  You belittle people on a daily basis.  So unbecoming of the POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump We are a democracy, you can not apply dictator ways to the US of A.
@realDonaldTrump OMG what is wrong with you?
@realDonaldTrump I do not approve of you calling people names, you are the President of the United States and as such you should act accordingly.  I don't care if it suits you to do so, it's just not right for an acting president to act in this manner.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/W5dqIIxEvJ
@piccini_judy @thechicolini Well Trump didn't tell Cohen directly, but the inaccuracy may be that Trump told someone else to tell Cohen to lie.  We shall see when all information is released from Mueller or when Cohen testifies on the 7th.
@obrienjs @BuzzFeedBen Maybe Trump told someone else to tell Cohen to lie.
@CurtisScoon Well Mueller didn't discount the entire report, I'm guessing that Trump didn't tell Cohen directly to lie, but instead indirectly to lie through someone else.  Most of the report is validated from Cohens Indictment.
@bigbill_ontw Not the entire report, and Mueller didn't exactly specify what part of the buzzfeed news report was inaccurate.   What I'm more concerned with is which 2 people are leaking information to the press.
@realDonaldTrump What is Mexico supposed to do?  You as president should be getting a summit together with the Central American countries to discuss the situation, but instead you just place blame on Mexico.  SMH
@realDonaldTrump The information on the buzzfeed yesterday, maybe instead of placing blame on buzzfeed, you should figure out who is leaking the information to the press.  They only reported what the two inside sources said and most was validated from Indictments
@realDonaldTrump Mueller didn't discount the report entirely, don't count your chickens before they are hatched.  You really need to check yourself to bring you back down to a humbled state, if that's even possible.
@realDonaldTrump Quit bragging about yourself, it's so unbecoming of a president.  You are not the best President.
@SpeakerPelosi DId you see the latest post, what is going on tomorrow at 3pm from Trump?
@SethAbramson The Trumptards don't want to listen to anything but the wall.  They are not paying attention to anything but Fox Fake News.  Unless it's on Fox, they won't believe anything.
@MichaelCohen212 Thank you for coming clean, honesty is always best.  :)  I will pray for you while you service out your sentence.
@realDonaldTrump We don't care about you trying to make yourself look right, just OPEN OUR GOVERNMENT
@realDonaldTrump If I were you, I would resign.  It's much better then getting impeached.   Don't embarrass the country by trying to fight what you already know you did wrong.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Trump, you are the worst president we have ever had.  Your a lying treasonous horrible person.  The American people voted you in and trusted you and you betrayed them.  The Presidency is a position in which you serve the American people.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Stop bragging, its unbecoming of a President.  Proof is the real data only Analysts can provide, let the data brag for you.  And by all means get our government back working, concentrate on that.  Forget the wall for now and sign.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 	Are you serious?  You're really going to go here again?  You need to stay off Twitter for a while, this is what gets you in trouble.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS and the American People		 the border security would get exactly what they need to keep us safe..		Thank you
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS and the American People:		the American people to come up with the policy as none of us are the experts Once they are done, they would then submit it to Congress to review and sign off on and then to President Trump to Sign. This would stop the argument and
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS and the American People:		Security/Immigration and let them come up with the new immigration reform, let them tell us the amount of money/extra personnel they will need, let them decide if we need the wall, take it out of the Presidents hands, Congress and
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS and the American People		I don't think that there would be the kind of divide we are now.		Second: I think we should split out the Border Security as Polosi recommended to stop the shutdown.		Third: I say we listen to the experts Homeland Security/Border
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS and the American People		First: I am going to throw out a positive, that was the very best speech #45 has given and the kind of speech he should give each and every time he addresses the American people, had he done this from the start of his presidency,
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS and the American People:  		I posted this on Facebook just moments ago and I thought I would share as I am not a big fan of you, but I thought you should know my thoughts after the Address and Congress speeches:  to follow this tweet
@BetoORourke Please run for President in 2020, our country needs a refreshing voice.  Your run for Senate impressed people from around the country, even though we couldn't vote for you (because we were in another state), we were listening to your message.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, someone spread the news in these countries that we were taking families with kids into the US about the time of the mid term elections.  I would bet it was you or one of your cronies so that the caravan you were talking about would come and prove you right.  a big scam
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You mean Fake and Friends
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS People were on you about not visiting our troops so you decided to visit them the day after Christmas...SMH, you didn't impress anyone
@realDonaldTrump Of course you will tweet about this, how many other crimes accord the same day as this from white americians?  I can guarantee you a lot more then one crime.  But you just have to tweet about it to try and make a point.
@realDonaldTrump You're an idiot, I can't wait for you to be impeached.
@realDonaldTrump Your so full of yourself SMH
@realDonaldTrump Waste of our tax payer dollars, and you are the biggest liar.  You said Mexico was going to pay for the wall, where is Mexico's money?
@realDonaldTrump Hey Repubs, donate to the wall here https://t.co/45p8AxP5zL
@realDonaldTrump Hey, sign away.  You're getting your funding on GoFundMe https://t.co/45p8AxP5zL
@realDonaldTrump I believe in Border Security and I am a Democrat, but remember you are the one that said the American people wouldn't pay for the wall, you said MEXICO would pay for the wall.  Don't make promises you can't keep
@realDonaldTrump None of that matters when you open your mouth and stupid sh*t comes out, if you want the respect of the American people, GET OFF TWITTER.  You're making yourself look stupid and childish.
@realDonaldTrump You can't stop us from looking into you and your family's actions, this isn't a dictatorship, again you work for the American People, we have every right to investigate everything you do or say.
@realDonaldTrump DIvert, Divert, Divert blame you are such a liar, no one believes you anymore 65% don't believe you and that includes people from your own party.  You need to resign
@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @trish_regan LOL FoxFakeNews SMH
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews So you are saying your a lawyer now and you know the law?  How convenient is that?  You know the law when it suits you.
@realDonaldTrump In order for a person to be considered a RAT they have to be telling the truth.  It's not a witch hunt "baby TRUMP", you work for the American People, we don't work for you.
@realDonaldTrump Never in the history of Presidents since i've been alive has a president been so childish and a liar.  It's not the press, it's you that is dishonest.
@realDonaldTrump @RyanZinke You have high turnover in your Administration.  Maybe you should stop making yourself look like a child throwing a tantrum every time someone says something against you and act like an adult
@realDonaldTrump people have for you.  I think the best thing you can do for yourself is just to resign from office and save what reputation you have left.
@realDonaldTrump Trump, You and your Son, Daughter, and Son in Law all were working with RUSSIA to get your hotel tower and to get info on Hillary.  You can lie all you want, we don't believe you and every time you back peddle on a lie and then have to tell the truth later, the less respect
@realDonaldTrump Doesn't sound like a witch hunt to me, sounds like you are in real trouble.
@TeaPainUSA lol Mueller will not be firedüòÜ

@realDonaldTrump A day Late #45, you should have put this tweet out prior.  I have no respect for you because you have a big fat mouth that doesn't know when to have respect for people who lost everything.  SMH  You talk about Colin Kemp... not having respect for the Flag, you have no respect!!!
@realDonaldTrump My friends have been affected by the fire in Paradise, some are saying PG&amp;E Power caused the Fire. This area of California has been in Severe Drought for years and to say that they have Poor/Gross mismanagement of Forest only tells me how uneducated you really are.  Stop Tweeting
@patrickdehahn Then call them what they are #AsylumSeekers
@RebekahWorsham Have you bothered to research why the #asylumseekers are heading to the US?  Migrant imply's they are headed here for work when in fact they are headed here because of violence in their country.  They are asylum seekers. There is a difference
@patgaz That's why we should stop calling them #MigrantCaravan and instead call them #AsylumSeekers , Migrant caravan = people traveling from country to country seeking work, Asylum seekers = someone who has left their native country as a political refugee most likely due to violence
@passantino Call them Asylum Seekers please	mi¬∑grant	1. a worker who moves from place to place to do seasonal work.	asylum	1. the protection granted by a nation to someone who has left their native country as a political refugee.
Call them what they really are "Asylum Seekers":  		mƒ´…°r…ônt		1. a worker who moves from place to place to do seasonal work. 		asylum		1. the protection granted by a nation to someone who has left their native country as a political refugee.	@realDonaldTrump
