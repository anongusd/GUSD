@marsden1991 Try again: there are several people with work and plans. You may not like them but that does not vitiate their existence. I had a GND resolution a year ago - perhaps I should keep just yelling at everyone the way you are tweeting at me — or maybe I should listen. I’ll listen.
I just published Want a Real Deal on Climate? Meaningful Climate Action Will Take All Of Us Together https://t.co/8TAkUuDXws
Hello @threadreaderapp unroll please and thank you ✌🏽
@hughbradyconrad Or maybe it’s union leaders voicing the concerns of their members. We could always LISTEN and find out then try to work TOGETHER.
@shelly2161 @Alyssa_Milano Please read the thread. Sure telling people they are WRONG feels good but it is partly why Democrats and progressive independents have LOST many communities who are seeking a path forward.
@edgeoforever @ManInTheHoody Big #ClimateReality fan here. Am making a different point in the thread — we are discussing the Green New Deal TODAY and what to do TODAY — and to my mind the good faith objections stakeholders have TODAY are the ones GND proponents must address + overcome. That’s the video.
@rojawi @laureldavilacpa Read my next teeet - it’s a thread
@AmySeeksTruth It is! I don’t always remember to follow it but when I do ... life and love are in synch.
@LauraJoy70 In its current form the federal resolution does not include as many indigenous or industrial communities. That’s why working on projects TOGETHER is better.
@kasthur66 Rather than shame the unions for voicing concerns of their members let’s listen to what union workers are saying about their existential needs. We can’t do this without each other.
@awelab1956 The point  is to have a dialogue with ALL stakeholders and lawmakers. When I wrote my DNC resolutions last year the goal was to advance climate action and campaign finance reform in our party as well as in the country at large. I still believe we must do so.
@BradParker_ Thanks Brad! We #CA Democrats were indeed engaged in this in the 2000s  — some fresh recruits and fresh ideas may get it done this time!
Last (for now) - let me add this piece here from June 2018 - it remains my view that being clean and green on climate and in politics is both an aspiration and a necessity. ✌🏽 https://t.co/E13Ija2bHO
A twitter flame war is so much more engaging than the ACTUAL WORK that some of us have been doing for years... 		But I’m telling you as one with political scars from the climate and money fight, we need to talk urgently and respectfully or we are doomed. #ThereIsNoPlanetB
And rather than attacking the unions — go to the communities and ask the workers what they see as a path forward. Engage them for solutions to their own situations. We are all in this TOGETHER and need buy-in from all stakeholders - from indigenous to industrial - to succeed.
Thst said, I’m telling you the path forward on climate action is to LISTEN. The UN report says irreversible damage in 12 years. Some workers say the Green New Deal transition eviscerates their livelihoods in 2-5 years. So they need to come TOGETHER and LISTEN to each other.
Should Senator Feinstein have been more diplomatic with the GND kids before offering one an internship rather than arguing? Absolutely. When I got married the advice to me was Dear Abby said when in-laws lecture you say “you’ve given me a lot to think about.” Diplomacy helps.
TBH the most important video about climate came from the head of a union talking about immediate impact on workers. 		As the author of a DNC #GreenNewDeal &amp; fossil fuel ban A YEAR AGO, I can tell you both of them failed in large part due to these concerns. https://t.co/hNgD5Mnczl

What is the motive here? Money. It’s always about the sanctions that were placed on Russia after Putin invaded Ukraine — such as the ones Donald Trump is lifting against Paul Manafort’s Russian creditor. 		#FollowTheMoney - you can bet Mueller has! https://t.co/zW75ijve57
To recap: the reliably Republican Ukrainian-American community saw Donald Trump pull the #GOPplatform switcheroo on Ukraine in favor of Putin the invader and reacted with “DESPAIR”		As we are learning, the facts behind a political betrayal reveal a criminal act. #collusion https://t.co/BiSYJJC89S
So let’s not look past the #GOPplatform because it marks the #Trump Campaign directing @GOP to formally trade something of value - its position on Ukraine &amp; standing among Ukrainian-American voters - to pay Manafort’s debts or oblige Putin. 👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽 https://t.co/DPJU2J6Jka
Mueller likely has digital and financial trail leading to the #GOPplatform change. 		Remember, this is the Trump Campaign Chair changing the Party Platform in a big way at the last minute. As a former state platform chair I know — people notice! There are records. #collusion
Let’s remember this key role Manafort played in changing long-standing #GOPplatform views on Ukraine and ask “was it for money? For Putin? Why did Trump agree?” https://t.co/eyzlHxEdOm
Still waiting on info about why Manafort changed the #GOPplatform on Ukraine: 		“prosecutors did not reveal new info about Manafort's activities in 2016 and later, which have become a focus of Mueller's inquiry into Russian influence &amp; the Trump campaign” https://t.co/bx2FmQ8SdD

And remember what was said of Adlai Stevenson on his second run for President: “a soufflé only rises once”		In 2015 Bernie entered as Challenger — In 2019 Bernie is Establishment due to  #OurRevolution and people they  elected. So he’ll have to show force AND freshness. Exciting!
As a repeat candidate - Bernie has a dual challenge — 	#1 show a deep and broad coalition AND 	#2 avoid being a victim of his own success as more candidates adopt and adapt his ideas in their own 2020 presidential campaigns.  	So far his launch achieved #1 - the race is about #2
... so rather than ask 2020 #DemocraticParty candidates and voters “who is pulling whom to the left or the right?” ask “how deep is the commitment? How broad is the outreach?” Becomes depth shows authenticity and outreach equals respect.
#DemocraticParty presidential candidates must internalize what the late Ron Dellums said at our 1st @PelosiBootCamp in 2005 - “you have to meet people where they are, not where you want them to be.” 		It’s not necessarily going right or left - it’s going deep and reaching out...

@WilkowMajority It’s a crime to file a false police report. In the Duke Lacrisse case the prosecutor was disbarred and fired. The wrongly accused students were paid by Duke in a private settlement. So there were - rightly - consequences.
@WilkowMajority And last, look at what MANY men are wondering anew “what if I did something before and now it will come back at me?” IMO there is a difference between unwelcome vs criminal behavior. Most people are wary of “I never” statements because there’s rarely just 1 victim. 3/3
@WilkowMajority Also look at what the individuals are risking by coming forward or denying; look at statements about the event before this week or when the person from long ago is in the spotlight; weigh contemporaneous statements and evidence. 2/3
@WilkowMajority Look at the what expert witnesses in science say about why people report and when. (See eg SPOTLIGHT or ask a genX or older Catholic). I litigated some of those early priest cases - neither trauma nor reporting is linear. 1/
@WilkowMajority and as I wrote, if he is going to stay for impeachment it should be trauma-informed (with the latest applied science we have about abuse and consent); respectful of due process for all - including not re-traumatizing the rest of us with needless repetition of lurid details.
@WilkowMajority ... fully preoccupied by an investigation. His law job and Duke U already asked him to step aside pending investigations. As his #DNC colleague I asked him to step off our committee where he serves by virtue of representing all the Dem Lt Govs. The quandary is his public job. ...
@WilkowMajority We don’t disagree on the fundamentals Andrew which is why I said there should be trauma-informed due process. The Q is what to do when a public official is accused of rape. Private citizens go on leave. Public officials can lose the confidence of their colleagues ...
Agree a mess. As I wrote, private sector leaders would be on leave pending rape accusations. Just as he has been asked to leave his law job and Duke position pending investigation, Fairfax should also step away from Democratic Lt Governors Assoc and step OFF the #DNC. https://t.co/vy8bhBn16F

Is it better for the survivors and the accused for Fairfax to resign as Lt Governor? YES HE SHOULD RESIGN and cooperate in an investigation. 	But if he stays, make the impeachment process trauma-informed and respectful of the somber task. This is a teaching moment for all. END
And while he is fighting the charges Justin Fairfax should step aside from his leadership role with the Democratic Lt Governors Assoc, and by extension his seat on the #DNC. He’ll be too busy fighting impeachment this week to effectively represent Lt Governors at our 2/14 mtg 10/
In Virginia it’s going to look like impeachment starting Monday unless Fairfax heeds the call of many of his supporters to step aside. Due process must be trauma informed and respectful of survivors. Give it a short deadline for a preliminary report. 9/
“What does due process of an accused rapist in elected office look like?” DID I JUST HAVE TO TYPE THAT SENTENCE? Well yes because the system is premised on the clearly faulty assumption that an elected official accused of rape would step down to fight the charges. 8/
That’s how they work in the private sector - a person goes on leave while an investigation takes place. We can’t really do that with elected officials — we have rehab and family leave but otherwise we essentially cancel an election. So we have to ask ourselves ... 7/
I wish when we first heard the harrowing rape accusation from Dr Tyson that Lt Gov Fairfax had agreed to an immediate investigation. Now days later we’ve heard the horrific rape accusation from Ms. Wilson and he’s been asked to step away from his legal job and Duke position. 6/
And I’ll be honest. It’s impossible to separate the need for due process and the need to respect and believe survivors. We have to do both in my view because our society needs transformative justice. We don’t throw people away but we can’t trust suspected abusers to lead us. 5/
That is my deepest resentment - that people in my party; my movement; my tribe DON’T understand the depth of the pain they re-inflict when they attack victims or casually repeat lurid details without regard for its impact on people they are supposed to care about. 4/
No matter how far we think we have come, each time a new sexual assault story roils our community - especially involving someone we think we know  - we revert back to exactly where we were when we were assaulted. The mental memory never fades. 3/
We fought so hard to put #metoo politics on the national radar. Lost friends along the way as @WeSaidEnough insisted that we had to put principle over party and address our own complicity in a pervasive culture of sexual harassment in politics. And yet we still have raw pain 2/
At #SaturdayMorning workout I thought through the texts and emails received all week from survivors angry and shaken about #JustinFairfax. Range from “who will protect me?” to “this is why we don’t come forward” to “where are the networks to help us when we relive our trauma?” 1/

@amydipa @WeSaidEnough Yes.
@donnabrazile Yes let’s hear from Virginians. And I’m leery of an Al Franken-like stampede while Northam’s family and supporters are just hours into processing this ugly truth. But resignation is inevitable. It shouldn’t matter that we have a fantastic LtGov in the wings - but it sure helps.
@N5F_B Yes that was the bizarre part to me. 1984.  Med School. Not the olden days. Not a theater page — it’s his personal message to the future. 		That’s why I don’t see him staying. I’m for due process - he deserves that - but can’t wrap my mind around how he could earn forgiveness.
@kological @WeSaidEnough @Buisson2020 Though I don’t know the facts of her situation, I definitely agree there is MUCH more housecleaning to do. It’s tough but necessary work.
Do you have a scintilla of evidence that the Senator knew about the Governor’s yearbook when she tweeted a him over a year ago?

@chicawgodog @amore20188 “In camera” review means in the judge’s chamber. 		So if you subpoena my phone records, I ask the judge to limit your subpoena to the relevant contact. The phone company  sends my records to the judge who privately looks at my info and decides what may be used or made public.
@amore20188 Yes they can subpoena. That process takes longer and requires in-camera review by a judge to limit what anyone can see. 		Many people would prefer these safeguards to simply handing over our records for fear of leaks or concern for contacts and their messages etc. I sure would!
Now this woman was a provate citizen not a TV star. And this was pre-Twitter so her diary wouldn’t have blown up on social media. 		So imagine that calculus for her today - and expand it exponentially for #JussieSmollett before assuming what it implies about the facts he alleged.

Watching LIVE - @SpeakerPelosi on CBS https://t.co/5W9m9pOjEF
@OverUnderClover Yes! And advising someone from a marginalized community to prioritize their emotional energy appeasing enemies over loving friends keeps them marginalized. 		Advising someone to prioritize a beloved community gives them the strength to build equity, respect, and decency for all.
Raise discourse? Of course!

Twitter is lousy at nuance but here goes: it’s not THAT Trump is leaving #Syria it’s HOW. 		His move leaves our allies to die and exacerbates the refugee crisis. 		We can (and should) shift the US mission from combat to diplomacy - but Trump didn’t - and people will suffer.

4 We must support #unions in renewables		This may seem obvious, but  “renewables” is as nails-on-a-chalkboard grating to workers in union-busting energy corps as “all of the above energy policy” is to environmentalists. 	We need everyone at the table TOGETHER to work this out.
3 I prefer to ban all Corp PAC $  but lost that at DNC so went industry by industry, passing a Resolution Banning Predatory Givers (guns tobacco payday lenders etc) with huge boost from @MoveOn and @MamaRedfield 💜 At a minimum I think ALL candidates + committees should do this! https://t.co/k1q6fxliio
2 For candidates Q is “what is your limit (zero? $200?) and how will you vet that?” Campaigns will have to pick a dollar limit and get a good vetting system to answer this. 1000+ of us took the #OilMonryOut pledge. Easy for me as a small PAC; harder for a POTUS PAC.
1 Limiting personal $ was a non-starter at DNC.		Committee did not want to vet every individual contribution of $200 (federal minimum reporting threshold). 	Also some on DNC asked “what if you are working in solar for an “all of the above” energy corp? Can you give more?”

@rweingarten @CA_Dem @DNC @TheDemocrats You were AWESOME!	#Red4Ed  🍎❤️
Hi @threadreaderapp can you please unroll my #PuertoRico @DNC Outtakes so people can get my report from “the room where it happens” ?? Thanks 💙
And that’s a wrap! Remember that #Democrats must organize, mobliloze &amp; inspire to build TRUST and keep engaging with transparency and results to keep the trust.  Thank you again @CA_Dem and @DNC members for sending me to @TheDemocrats to serve you. #WhenWeFightWeWin #ForThePeople https://t.co/UszDKk1lv4
.@AFSCME’s Saunders: When #labor is being attacked, Dems have to speak up and say “you are attacking people’s rights to a seat at the table.  You need to show up at the picket lines. You need to call employers like University of California and tell them to pay living wages” 👏🏽
.@AFSCME Saunders urged #DNC: ACCOUNTABILITY: if the people do not see us engage them to fight with us we will lose them. We have to hold our friends and enemies accountable. We have to hold them accountable and make adjustments. If we keep organizing together we can win in 2020.
... @AFSCME’s 50th anniversary MLK in Memphis event did not end there. We started a digital program for 18-34 year old black men so we could talk to them and they could talk to each other. 		Also it’s about ACCOUNTABILITY- all but especially our friends need to say #UNION ...
From @AFSCME’s President Lee Saunders to #DNC: We realized we could not do this alone. We hired local organizers to keep up the work and we will keep the investment gong. We will engage in communities year round. We have to change the way we think about relationships....
From @rweingarten to #DNC: Engage our members 24/7 on the issues the matter that are found in the values and building trust.		There is huge anxiety in people who feel stuck with higher costs and don’t want a hand out but a hand up. #Education and #labor rights are key.
Labor Lessonsnfor #DNc from @AFTunion and @AFSCME presidents		Our members asked ourselves “could we find a set of values?” We did these FIVE	-economic dignity 	-health care	-public education &amp; affordable college	-save our democracy	-fight against bigotry &amp; hate		We built TRUST.
#WI did a constituency outreach program organizing Native American, Hispanic, Black, Hmong communities.		“We keep the operation going and now that the #WIleg GOP want to curtail the powers of the incoming Democratic gov our folks are calling into the Capitol to protest.”
Nevada Wisconsin and Minnesota leaders described the #DNC role in expanding the electorate and investing early in 57 (50 states &amp; 6 territories &amp; DC) partnership for field outreach to rural, base, millennial voters (some falling into more than one category).
#DNC vice chair @TeamKCP brought the realness: White Democrats can’t figure out why White people don’t support them - so they chase the 4/10 voters not the 9/10 voters. Why do they make these decisions? 		Guy Cecil It is possible to reach out to both - #MT’s Jon Tester did &amp; won.
#DNC talked about the bill for 8 years - finally we got to talk about the policy and how it was helping people’s lives and how Trump’s GOO were taking it away	#HELLO @LittleLobbyists @votevets @HealthCareVoter @AFLCIO @AFSCME @SEIU @AFTunion @MoveOn @PPact @peoplefor etc ❤️
I asked what role the 10,000 grassroots #ProtectOurCare events by Little Lobbyists health care voters and Democratic House Members played in this victory?		Guy said we have to do it all - grassroots, targeted ads &amp; talk about health care as a policy issue not a legislative issue
🚨CAUTION 🚨from @prioritiesUSA data		Trump is still very strong in the Midwest and Democrats need to campaign on our positives not his negatives to beat him in 2020.
.@prioritiesUSA data: people think Trump is endangering #SocialSecurity #Medicare and health care and he’s using fear and division to tear the country apart.	Democrats won the argument on health care taxed and #immigration in House races.	 	Ads are up at	https://t.co/cIeqaUiYSz
More from @prioritiesUSA polling that we the #DNC now get to know post-election: 	HEALTH CARE 	For the first time they understood that preexisting conditions were part of the ACA. 	TAXES	People did not see a personal benefit to the #GOPtaxbill - its favorability is only at 30%
.@guycecil gave a @prioritiesUSA report to #DNC about what they learned about Persuasion and Turnout. Most Persuasion was NOT about Trump because voters did not want to hear about him - they already didn’t like him and wanted to hear about their personal ecomony. AMEN
In many states we won due to the #DNC $10 million SPIF (State Party Innovation Fund) went to 3 areas of focus:	-Rural	-Base	-Millennial	Will give a detailed breakdown of where the money went so we can map out outgoing engagement going forward
#DNC noted that In states where we won we see Republican legislatures now trying to curtail powers of  incoming Democratic governors with sudden requirements like confirmation votes they never met themselves. Our volunteers are calling them up and calling this out in #MI #WI etc
TX Chair Gilberto Hinojosa		#DNC should look at our state voting systems and make it easier for people to vote.	We are doing this in Harris County, Texas to have early voting and easier voting access.	Beto lost by 200,000 vote deficit  - those additional voters are in Harris.
[#NC09 is where a Republican campaign went to the houses of older Democrats, claimed to be voting officials, took their absentee ballots and got rid of them. The Republican “won” by 900 votes in that Congressional district]. #DNC wants a review.
2. Republicans are making up the term “vote harvesting” though usually they WANT Military Ballots to be counted as cast if mailed on/before Election Day. We saw it coming in CA where we picked up 7 House seats &amp; we note that there is ACTUAL voter fraud by the Republicans in #NC09
1. The 3 Mar-a-lago Members shadow running the VA hurt our our veterans - just failed to pay out Forever GI Bill $ until. outrage from @VoteVets, other Veterans groups, and Members of Congress made them reverse course. Vets shouldn’t pay the price of Trump cronyism!
From the #DNC Veterans &amp; Military Families Council, I reported 2 concerns:		1. 3 Mar-a-lago Members shadow running the VA are causing harm to our veterans 		2. Republicans are making up the term “vote harvesting” though usually they WANT Military Ballots to be counted as cast!
Speaker-designate @TeamPelosi is leading electing a historic majority - 40 seats - with a historic vote total - that is diverse and powerful. We won because so many Democrats worked on these Congressional races.
We also talked about ELECTION results. DNC invested early and worked hard with DCCC DSCC DLCC.	We worked to elect more Secretaries of State.	We now have a majority of Democratic State Attorneys General!
The PLEO Party Leader Elected Official designation is for pledged delegates who are Members of Congress Governors etc who want a first round #DNC convention vote but don’t want to run against activist to get there.
We have worked hard to rebuild trust on our presidential process. Rules and Bylaws Cttee working with early states on rules. A key rule change ends superdelegates voting 1st round absent consensus candidate BUT elected officials can still be PLEOs &amp; not run against constituents. https://t.co/j3I1278fPC
Outtakes from the #DNC Executive Meeting in #PuertoRico (thread) 		Chair promises a 2020 process that is fair. Will release a protocol on debates soon; expect debates in summer 2019 . Will decide by March 2019 the Host City for 2020 Convention: Houston, Miami Beach, or Milwaukee.

I have heard from people from the #SFGiants organizations and fan base incensed and agonized about this. We need to find a path forward with respect and equity. Not only because the racist donations harm the @SFGiants financial brand - but because they decimate our goodwill.

As for me, because I was asked by complainants for confidential advice early on, I won’t comment on the substance of the personnel investigation — and as a potential juror (in my capacity as a #CADEM Executive Board Member) I will recuse myself from any removal votes.	6/
Anyone who has information regarding the investigation or their own situation should contact @CA_Dem Human Resources via email to Amy@cadem.org  (to preserve the record even as they farm the work to the independent investigator) 	5/
As to the particulars of the allegations, a @CA_Dem Vice Chair has called on the Chair to resign. The Chair has 10 days from registered mail receipt of that demand to resign or respond per #CADEM bylaws	4/ https://t.co/eJVPcU2ian
As to the “due process” we demand in our caucus statement today, please know that @CA_Dem policy has improved due to the bipartisan work of @WeSaidEnough and the partisan organizing of the @CA_Dem Women’s Caucus.
