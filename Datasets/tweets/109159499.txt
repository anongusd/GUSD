@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden History cannot be summed up in a 1 line. Too many facts that support America was built by Christian principles and in recognition of God to argue away. INCLUDING the separation of church &amp; state, which is a CHRISTIAN principle though many misconstrue.	https://t.co/JSo0eVpkU8
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden Liberty = freedom to do what is morally correct. United States Supreme Court Justice James Wilson‚Äôs marvelous dictum: ‚ÄúWithout liberty, law loses its nature and its name, and becomes oppression. Without law, liberty also loses its nature and its name, and becomes licentiousness.‚Äù
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden This conviction manifests itself n their abstract reflections (James Wilson‚Äôs law lectures) &amp; practical decisions (e.g., all but one Supreme Court Justice prior to John Marshall argued publicly that the Court could strike down an act of Congress if it violated natural law).
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden The Founders of the American republic were influenced by Christian ideas in significant ways. They firmly believed that God ordained moral standards, that legislation should be made in accordance with these standards, and that moral laws took precedence over human laws.
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden Founders‚Äô use of Christian rhetoric &amp; arguments in Suffolk Resolves, Declaration of Rights, &amp; the Declaration of Causes &amp; Necessity of Taking up Arms, + dozen explicitly Christian calls for prayer, fasting, and thanksgiving issued by the Continental and Confederation¬†Congresses.

@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden Also notice that one "unalienable right" is "life". LIFE. Which is what is extinguished when abortions are performed. It's all there. God is mentioned more than a few times in founding documents &amp; so are His laws and morals.

There is no evidence that anyone in congress is taking actions to impede the Mueller investigation. People know it's a waste of time &amp; are losing patience.
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden Ignorance is bliss.
@judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC The IG also allowed Strzok to filter his own messages, for which he is under investigation. The FBI? Are you serious? Let's just let all accused criminals in America sort thru their own evidence b4 it's presented &amp; use their families to corroborate their innocence. What a joke!
@judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC What does this have to do with the select agents, whom I've named, that are in fact Democrats and are the agents responsible for this particular investigation? Elude and water it down all you want. It doesn't erase the pertinent facts.
@RHunter20 @enelson6 @judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC This is not fact.
@central_intrig @enelson6 @judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC They were questioning Srtzok as they should. The Dems were not. It's really quite simple. Benghazi? U sure r taking Hillary's word on this. Unsurprising. Do you know anything about the Clintons? They are hardly trustworthy. Just bc the evidence wasn't found doesn't mean a thing.
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden You literally are stuck in some sort of obsessive mind loop, unintelligently repeating the same illogical comments in the face of scientific evidence. You are seriously not worth my time &amp; are likely the most closed-minded ignoramous I've come into contact with in a long time.
@RHunter20 @Om4rSd @ABC Ur problem is that you can't see the difference between defending an individual &amp; pointing out a flawed comparison between two separate entities. I never claimed to defend either one. Just highlighting the err in logic of statements made conflating the two &amp; revealing hypocrisy.
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden You call Princeton University laughable? Google it, there are many more legit sources. The only joke here is you. You are not only a fool to believe an eating, peeing, pooping, somersaulting, kicking, hearing baby in the womb is not alive but you are a science denier. üëèüëèüëè
@judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC The most important part is no matter what opinions they express they don't hold the reins of the investigation and don't have any power to influence it such as what Strzok had.
@judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC I can't comment on your allegations over GOP taking actions to hinder Mueller investigation. I haven't researched any of that yet. It's more likely that they agree that this is a waste of time and tax dollars and want Mueller to either indict or give it up already.
@jaimejet @enelson6 @judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC Well at least they got in one valid question. As far as rebuking him over using government phone, that's pretty obvious and just redundant. It doesn't accomplish anything.
@Om4rSd @judeEcooper @ABC Furthermore, your insult makes absolutely no sense. I am not the one calling Strzok's integrity into question, &amp; his lack of fidelity is fact. Also, you do not know me and literally know nothing about my life, my fidelity or integrity. What a baseless load of crap. üëèüëèüëè
@Om4rSd @judeEcooper @ABC Personal insults really r all the left has..left. All it does is reveal your desperation &amp; lack of legitimate thought. How do U know that he upheld the standards? Apparently, for you, just taking Strzok's word is enough. I take in all resources &amp; employ facts &amp; critical thinking.
@Om4rSd @judeEcooper @ABC And how could anyone know whether or not Strzok took any action on his bias since he evaded every question necessary to find out AND was given the right to vet his own texts prior to the hearing and to refuse to release them at his own discretion.
@Om4rSd @judeEcooper @ABC I didn't say that Strzok did anything to violate the constitution. I said that his integrity as a FBI investigator into Trump was called into question. I also repeated your comment stating it is the responsibility of the commitee to uphold the constitution, not act as defense.
@Om4rSd @judeEcooper @ABC Why is the actual point so elusive? It doesn't matter what half of the Republicans (as u say) believe, they do not work for the FBI which upholds the principles of fidelity &amp; integrity, AND they weren't integral in an investigation against the individual biased against!
@judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC You could take that entire sentence &amp; replace "GOP" with "DNC" &amp; "Trump" with "Strzok" and it would make a whole lot more sense given the hearing that I saw today.		"How about the DNC's bias in the hearing? They took an oath to defend the Constitution, not Strzok."!
@judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC I disagree. The hearing was not about perjury it was about Strzok's integrity as a FBI investigator in the Hillary email investigation as well as in the Trump/Russia Collusion investigation. Your last sentence makes no sense. The only members who actually stayed on topic were Rep
@eddie1961 @Om4rSd @ABC You are going to have to be more specific. I literally found nothing about this on Google nor by clicking on your #Hawker hashtag.
@enelson6 @judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC Didn't see the Bannon hearing so I can't comment. On the flip side, why did't any Democrats ask any relative questions of Strzok in the hearing? They merely voiced their own agendas, praised Strzok &amp; used their lines of "questioning" to defend him like they were his defense team!
@mrdefender1983 @Om4rSd @ABC Another left field comment by a leftist. Nice stretch. But you are obviously oblivious otherwise you'd have something less myopic to add to the discussion.
@judeEcooper @Om4rSd @ABC The hearing was not about perjury it was about the question of Strzok's integrity given is blatant bias. Gohmert's remarks were right on the mark.
@Om4rSd @ABC It has nothing to do w believing Trump. It has to do with facts. The facts are, again, that Strzok conducted an affair with a fellow FBI hire WHILE serving in the FBI. Big difference. Plus, did you see all of the past presidents who have had affairs? You can't just cherry pick.
@Om4rSd @ABC You completely ignored the entirety of my point.

@Om4rSd @ABC Strzok's infidelity to his wife, (flying straight in the face of FBI motto, btw, "Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity"), is a totally legit example of Strzok's lack of integrity. He has no fidelity nor integrity whilst serving in a position which requires it.

@chrisbaileyguy @48sleeper @RVAwonk Furthermore, Hillary's email investigation has been closed and she was cleared so what sense would it make to release texts biased against her? From whom would you demand those texts? The only ones that matter are those directly from the investigators &amp; overseers involved.
@chrisbaileyguy @48sleeper @RVAwonk It sounds 2me like u r implying that there was some sort of conspiracy within the FBI which helped Trump win the presidency. If u can believe that then why is it such a stretch for u 2 believe that Strzok might have taken action whether directly or indirectly on his obvious bias?
@chrisbaileyguy @48sleeper @RVAwonk "Nobody in the history of ever has texted at work?" - The fallacy of ur point is obvious. Strzok is not just anyone. He was a FBI head investigator specifically for the Trump/Russia collusion investigation, as well for Hillary's email investigation &amp; must uphold higher integrity.
@ToastNButterGuy @48sleeper @RVAwonk For you to make that assumption you are obviously vacuous.
@ToastNButterGuy @48sleeper @RVAwonk Here we go again. A leftist assuming they know all about a stranger. How asinine you ppl are. I literally never get my info from Fox news &amp; only recently have I even looked at anything they have to say bc I examine all sources. Most of the left has zero originality of thought.
@MorrisMichaelB @48sleeper @RVAwonk How is he supposed to know the details as to what Strzok was specifically lying about? This is a dumb question. The premise of the hearing is based upon whether or not he has any integrity in his work due to his obvious bias which he spewed ON THE JOB at his own admission.
@48sleeper @chrisbaileyguy @RVAwonk Not to mention his admission that these texts were exchanged during working hours and on his FBI phone as well as his personal phone. If he has nothing to hide why not disclose his private phone messages?
@ToastNButterGuy @48sleeper @RVAwonk No. The left has always been nasty. Just look at their history. Not saying some people aren't ugly on the right but the left definitely took a head-start and continues to be the champions of vitriol.
@ToastNButterGuy @48sleeper @RVAwonk &amp;for pete's sakes! Can u people discuss anything without name calling? It just makes your ideas look weak. You're like school children w nothing better to say when faced with something you don't like so you resort to bullying &amp; repeating derogatory names you've heard from others.
@ToastNButterGuy @48sleeper @RVAwonk There is no evidence, only the left's manipulation of the truth at every step of the way.

@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden Wtf is wrong with you? Are you illiterate? These are SCIENTIFIC STUDIES. SCIENCE, not religion, confirms my point with these sources.
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden So far, science has found that a child in the womb can feel pain at 20 weeks. They have to inject anesthesia into the womb prior to aborting in some states. Gender is determined at fertilization &amp; can be seen as early as 14 weeks! Does that sound like a non-living object to you?!
@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden As you can see, there is a multitude of evidence that aborting a child is murder that has nothing to do with religion. I hope you realize that women are not aborting in zygote stage but way beyond - up to 24 weeks! I'm currently pregnant &amp; have felt my baby kick since 10 weeks!

@JNE4KLPK @RonWyden So u don't believe murdering an innocent child is harm? Also, how can u assume u know 1 iota about my "bible studies" or that I've ever even attended a church? You are an idiot to do so. Also ur interpretation of the Bible based upon what you've said clarifies you have no clue.
@Ratzoff2ya1 @I_am_Carnage @LALewman @NancyPelosi @FPepoon Your argument holds no water bc  children who are wanted are also abused &amp; murdered. People can become sick in their mind &amp; soul, but this happens no matter what the law on abortion. Abortion is certainly not a constitutional right. But it is against the law to murder the living.
@Ratzoff2ya1 @I_am_Carnage @LALewman @NancyPelosi @FPepoon "Life is misery. Not a miracle." This is a very telling &amp; very sad picture of ur mindset. Murder has been committed since the dawn of man. Does that make it justified? U say "often" &amp; "sometimes" but what about the majority? R u saying their murders r justified bc "sometimes"?
@I_am_Carnage @Ratzoff2ya1 @LALewman @NancyPelosi @FPepoon I agree. Abortion is murder. Would the majority of people aid and protect a murderer? With power comes responsibility. Women must respect their own awesome power and quit making pathetic &amp; tragic excuses to murder their own flesh and blood.
@Ratzoff2ya1 @I_am_Carnage @LALewman @NancyPelosi @FPepoon The very large majority of these murders aren't due 2 situations that qualify 4 exemptions but 4 women who simply shirk responsibility &amp; rely on abortion as a fallback plan. Is that the kind of society u want 2 live in? Where innocent lives r created &amp; thrown out with the trash?!
@Ratzoff2ya1 @I_am_Carnage @LALewman @NancyPelosi @FPepoon Do you think murderers should be aided in their endeavors and protected? Women have a great power &amp; with great power comes great responsibility. The real issue here is the impetuousness of society &amp; the abdication of responsibility.	https://t.co/25VmmriRLK
@Ratzoff2ya1 @I_am_Carnage @LALewman @NancyPelosi @FPepoon U r naming various political figures who also happen 2 be Christians. How r these people in complete control of govt? What laws have these Christians passed that endangers anyone? Do u know how low the % of women who'd be considered exceptions truly is? Zygote=LIFE. Abort=MURDER.

@acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris How delusional does someone need to be to think that holding people temporarily who have BROKEN THE LAW, which has been done by past administrations as well, implies America is entering an era of Nazism?!

@CooperJ1099 @MORNINGSTARdj @acampors @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Fyi, you have repeatedly accused me of taking my news from sources like Fox &amp; others you listed above.

@CooperJ1099 @MORNINGSTARdj @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Naivety is your strong suit. You really think that such a humane &amp; fundamental belief is born from some political dissent &amp;/or conformity? Your world must be a cold place. I feel sorry for you.
@CooperJ1099 @MORNINGSTARdj @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Lol! That makes zero grammatical sense. And what were you belly-aching about yesterday? Something about regurgitation of thoughts? Have you run out of words?
@CooperJ1099 @MORNINGSTARdj @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris The conflict arises when the left tries to exploit the separation of church &amp; state, as they do most things. The Dem party is certainly the party of self-interest and exploitation.
@CooperJ1099 @MORNINGSTARdj @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Here we go. I bet you believe separation of church &amp; state was created by Jefferson? Wrong. It was created by a religious minister named Roger Williams. This law is just &amp; is supported by religion. It protects both parties. Once again, you are looking at things as one-sided.
@MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @acampors @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris For you to compare a temporary situation where the care of the children far surpasses Obama or their original homes to Nazi camps is vile. But don't take it from me.. https://t.co/iktOiWMrPe
@MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @acampors @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris That's why Democratic Clinton saved all the whites in Bosnia &amp; allowed the Africans in Rwanda to be massacred. 800,000 to be specific. That is only one example of the deception by the Democratic party.
@MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Your comments just continue to get more and more infantile, fatuous &amp; futile.
@MORNINGSTARdj @acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris I'd suggest you do some research into the origins of Nazism but I can gather that reading impartial history is not your strong suit.
@MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris This is a perfect example of how inane you are. Using memes in lieu of words only highlights your  vacuousness.
@MORNINGSTARdj @acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris You are obviously a closed-minded half-wit if you cannot see how racism works both ways. The only thing people like u care about is whining about ur perceived injustices &amp; demanding handouts. I know the type. My minority friends know the type. Nobody respects u. You know nothing.
@CooperJ1099 @MORNINGSTARdj @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Bullshit. The left refuses to respect anything that is not of their self-serving interests. What Rep care about is God. Remember? The invisible guy that our country was built upon that the left so vehemently despises bc you can't see Him? Everything the left does is antichrist.
@CooperJ1099 @acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris You dare to tell me why I believe what I do? You are treading on thin ice. There is good &amp; evil in this world whether Dem choose to see it or not. Only a self-serving, evil spirited person would fight to murder defenseless babies. Period. I've believed this since I was a child!
@CooperJ1099 @acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris I don't care what charts you dig up, that is a ludicrous statement! How could you even use babies as a rationalization?! Pathetic. Rep care about babies bc they are tiny human beings but the evil Dem only care about what they can see &amp; what affects them. Rep respect values.
Overwhelming. Yet there is so much more to be said. I learn more every day. I too, once considered becoming a Democrat. I was young &amp; dumb too! I registered Independent for a few years before deciding to register Republican. I hope people read &amp; #walkaway https://t.co/ihVwaEbNMQ
@acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @MORNINGSTARdj @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Today, there is no "party of racism". The Republucan party was literally founded upon the principles of equality. Republicans have always, as they still do, upheld the principles &amp; values of the US Constitution. The only party of racism was the Democratic party. Exactly my point.
@acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @MORNINGSTARdj @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Yes, I was "implying that Democrats were the party of racism" because they were!
@acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris The vast majority of imprisoned Americans are in public prisons. Only 8% of all state &amp; federal prisoners are held in private prisons. Cooperations always profit from inmates whether prison is private or public - food, clothing, etc. Another misconception perpetuated by the left.
@MORNINGSTARdj @acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Compare minority well-being of Dem controlled cities vs. their well-being in Rep controlled cities. You may be surprised. Actions speak louder than words.
@acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Just look at the stats of the minority well-being in Dem controlled cities vs. Rep controlled cities. Dem agenda is pretty clear.
@acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Facts remain the same. The difference is today Dems are doing what they've done throughout history. They have no core principles. They change like the tides in order to appeal to who they have to so they can win votes. Their policies do not reflect their love for minorities.
@MORNINGSTARdj @acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Racism works both ways. Many of my diverse friends would disagree with you. Once the leftist starts resorting to personal attacks &amp; assumptions I know I've already won. All you have to do next is block me.
@MORNINGSTARdj @acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris This is a minority and has nothing to do with the Republican platform. Most Rep would not vote for a Nazi &amp; Cruz even publicly advocated for the Dem opponent for this reason. Nazi's literally have Dem roots in the 1st place &amp; socialism &amp; fascism is their thing too, just like Dems
@MORNINGSTARdj @acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Totally irrelevant. It's sad that the race card is all the left seems to think about. Racism is not a majority issue in America today, despite the left always trying to make it into one. Welcome to the 21st century.
@acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris "These positive things"? Can you be a little more clear? What happened in the past seems to be very important to Dems who wish to refute their party's position on slavery, civil rights, KKK. Guess who Martin Luther King, Jr. affiliated with? Not Dem. Rep uphold values not hate.
@acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @MORNINGSTARdj @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris It has everything to do with it if you wish to perpetuate the claim that the 2 parties switched &amp; the racists are the Rep as a result! The fact that Rep did not control the South until the '90s has nothing to do with Carter. If you think that Rep platform is based on race ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Rep defend our constitution, &amp; the morals and values our nation was founded upon. Slaves in the US?! Many slaves still in existence are in Africa where slavery ultimately began. Africans enslaving other Africans. Rep today are in no way ant-civil rights. That is a leftist ploy.
@acampors @MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Have you been paying attention?! Our entire conversation is about the fact that Dems fought civil rights, perpetuated slavery, etc. 50+ years ago and did not magically transform into Rep based on racism no matter what mainstream biased media will claim.
@acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @MORNINGSTARdj @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Nixon lost the South in 1968. 12 years post Civil Rights Act,  Dem Jimmy Carter overwhelmingly took the South in 1976. 30 years post 1964 Act, in 1994, Rep won majority of southern congressional seats for the 1st time. Rep stronghold today is long after racially-charged politics.
@MORNINGSTARdj @acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Accusations don't reinforce your mythological version of the truth. I have no preconceived notions, just facts. What you have is a biased spin on cherry picked facts. It is all too obvious that you need to do a lot more independent research.
@acampors @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @MORNINGSTARdj @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris This is a very linear way at looking at a more complex matter. I can't emphasize reading more than 1 or 2 sources of info enough. The idea that parties switched based on racism doesn't hold water. If so, why was the South predominantly led by Dem until 21st century, post slavery?
@MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris Clearly, you are a sheep.

@MORNINGSTARdj @CooperJ1099 @CryptoMob @KatDancing5 @viewsfordays @KamalaHarris You are thoroughly deluded. Honestly, how can I argue with such blatant factless statements.

@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 I check facts. U all r obviously so angry nothing will ever be good enough. Tell me, what good does it do anyone to be angry all of the time? What are you so angry about? The left perpetuates hate &amp; anger &amp; refuses to cooperate to consider the real facts (not emotion) 4 solutions
@scottdesigns @DSleeper33 @Whatsthetruth7 What was the left's early rhetoric? They came right out in the beginning with the name calling, accusations, personal attacks, factless claims, etc. I can't tell you how many times I have presented a fact they don't like but can't refute so they just start calling me names .
@scottdesigns @DSleeper33 @Whatsthetruth7 I don't recall conservatives threatening the left with guns unless you are talking about random comments on social media &amp; news sites discussing gun control. Both sides say crazy things. But the left has leaders who have spoken out &amp; encouraged hostility &amp; violence.
@scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 @DSleeper33 I hope you have a good day as well!
@scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 @DSleeper33 Of course, you are entitled to your opinion about him, I'm just sharing mine. I will watch the interview when I get the chance.
@scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 @DSleeper33 I did not see the interview &amp; do not agree w his personality at times but I highly doubt he was breeding contempt or division. He has been under attack since b4 he took office in ways unprecedented. The left has constantly badgered &amp; provoked him from day 1. He wants cooperation!
@scottdesigns @DSleeper33 @Whatsthetruth7 Not getting sucked into anything. Been paying attn &amp; the left is extremely hostile &amp; vitrolic. More times than not, they are in attack mode &amp; throwing the punches. I've experienced the enmity myself &amp; their favorite ploy is to ignore or cherry pick facts then personally attack.
@SHoff83845516 @DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 Are you serious? That is the most ridiculous comment I've seen all day.
@scottdesigns @DSleeper33 @Whatsthetruth7 Not to mention all of the leftists who encourage violence against conservatives and their families including their children. They even suggest violence against those whose jobs they don't agree with and their families! #WalkAway is well-deserved.
@scottdesigns @DSleeper33 @Whatsthetruth7 I'm not talking about protests, I'm talking about the leftists who literally violently attack conservatives at said protests and incite riots, such as the one that just happened in Oregon.

@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 It was #4 earlier today. They must change quickly. That would explain why I've seen some past tweets claiming the walk away was trending at like #3, etc. but when I checked it wasn't on the list. Either way, thanks for having a civil discussion.
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 Perhaps, but why would #WalkAway, which currently has 1660 tweets in the last hour not counting its variations such as #WalkAwayMovement or #walkedaway or #WalkAwayCampaign NOT be in the top 20 trending list, while #impeach45 only has 40 tweets in the last hour &amp; is like #4?! ü§î

@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 #TwitterCensorship does work. I couldn't get it to pop up as a hashtag so I wasn't sure if it would. Interesting..ü§î. Also, searching like I said above for just the phrase will bring up different complaints from those who did not hashtag.
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 #TwitterCensorship if that doesn't work search "Twitter Censorship" in the Twitter search box and it will pop up. Many more whom I follow have had these issues.
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 It's just interesting that they tend to think all of the "foerign agents" are conservative, ESPECIALLY seeing as how the right are not the side known for inciting riots! Lol!
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 The fact that you think there is no bias is just a theory. And a naive one at that.
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 They did not deny bias. They eluded questions concerning bias. You're obviously going to think what you want to either way. After all, all that you gleaned from the UK article is the demographics of their user base! Accounts are being locked, followers systematically removed, etc
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 "We analysed 5,000 tweets that were posted while the Bill made its way through parliament"		 "near-complete lack of support on Twitter for the Bill stands in contrast to a poll which found that the UK public tend to be in favour of the kinds of restrictions placed on immigrants"
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 'Surveys &amp; polls consistently find that British adults have a generally negative attitude toward immigration. Not so on Twitter. we analysed thousands of tweets over 18 months - &amp; found Twitter users tended to be substantially more supportive of immigration than the general pop'
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 Now you are telling me what I think and why. Classic. These are just supportive references to something I think because of the hundreds of people who have experienced it in some way. I trust personal experiences more than "news" sources.
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 And before you go on to quote "a Twitter spokesperson", vague as that is, and that they deny the allegations as well as "shadowbanning", well, duh. Of course they do.
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 "When asked whether the company unilaterally denied¬†the allegations of ‚Äúunwritten rules‚Äù &amp; political bias in its content review teams that determine what content is considered a violation of its rules, the company responded to several other questions, but did not issue a denial"
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 "However, when asked about the specific claims made in the video regarding content moderation, Twitter would provide comment only¬†regarding "shadowboxing"."
@DSleeper33 @scottdesigns @Whatsthetruth7 No. It highlights that when asked pointed questions about its bias Twitter declined to answer AND they ignored requests for independent review of their guidelines for content considered in "violation". I already knew this was coming bc you obviously did not read it critically.

@AvontePayne @CNN Character limit makes it hard for me to say what I mean. "Detached from common slavery", meaning slavery was a common part of life in those times albeit as wrong as it was. I'd assume just about everyone back then owned a slave but that shouldn't overshadow their accomplishments.
@AvontePayne @CNN I'm truly sorry you had to deal with such racism in your life, it isn't right. This is a very subjective issue for you. But when I look at a monument of a war hero I don't think about them owning slaves, I think about what they did for our country, detached from common slavery.
@WomensCEO @ZaCook325 @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Because it is unlawful to cross the border illegally and there are legal repurcussions. Due to Flores settlement children cannot be held more than 20 days &amp; must be separated pending parental prosecution as is the effect. https://t.co/JMUfUZIKo9

@kellymays @ZaCook325 @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle No matter the policy the outcome was roughly the same. Obama either marooned &amp; scattered families or did nothing &amp; the problem persists. Either way everyone loses in the long run. There has to be some order. Overturning Flores would allow families to stay together.
@AvontePayne @CNN To clarify, many important historical figures also did some fkd up things but I don't think it's right to erase &amp; discredit them based upon the errs of the times. We gladly accept what they provided for us yet ignore their contributions due to cherry-picking what we don't like.
@AvontePayne @CNN I'm looking at things objectively on a large scale. I see things on a much larger scale than many people seem to, it's just the way I think. I don't mind agreeing to disagree w/ you on this bc I'm truly not trying to defend slavery. It's an apples &amp; oranges thing to me.
@AvontePayne @CNN I can sense that you take slavery as a personal thing for whatever reason but it is wrong to make sweeping statements that white people don't care about mistreatment of human beings. Can't you see the racism inherent in that very statement? Slavery was not the point of America.
@RPappas333 @GOP Even Canada has a merit based immigration policy. Why America cannot implement a similar approach is beyond me. There has to be some form of control over this situation. The wall would help keep the illegal crossers out &amp; we could focus on who to allow in.
@RPappas333 @GOP It's not just about the wall. It's about fixing the Flores settlement to allow for families to be detained together while they await court proceedings. The only other alternative is just to let them all walk free (catch &amp; release). That sounds like open borders to me.
@AvontePayne @CNN So why does the issue of slavery always come up whenever people want to tear down monuments and disrespect those who fought and sacrificed so that we could be here today? Does the fact that they, along with "everyone" else who owned slaves erase their contributions to America?!

@RPappas333 @GOP If Democrats would get over themselves long enough to agree to a border solution other than doing nothing the families would be reunited. What I see is Dems using these kids as a political foothold. Holding these kids is not doing Reps any good so I can't see how they are a tool.

Democrats have to let go of the "catch and release" and open borders bleeding heart mentality. Their stance only deepens the issue. Ignoring a problem allows it to grow. The proof is undeniable.
@Morgan37628089 @CNN Also, they are not separating babies nor children under the age of 5 unless they are traveling with gang members or other adults which are falsely posing as guardians and using these kids as a cover.
@Morgan37628089 @CNN Of course I feel for these families but at some point action must be taken to establish order. I'm hopeful these families will shortly be reunited and have faith that this is a temporary situation. At least they aren't being repatriated amongst gangs with nothing and scattered!
@Morgan37628089 @CNN It is unavoidable if and when the parent breaks the law. This applies to American citizens. Immigrants can claim Asylum into the U.S. from ANY country or at the border - legally. Obama's ATEP was much crueler! It scattered families in dangerous areas and many never reunited!
@JakeSchott2003 @egrock89 @DavidTardiff18 @CNN https://t.co/3JSnDVO8Ph
@JakeSchott2003 @egrock89 @DavidTardiff18 @CNN Also, Obama was dubbed, "Importer in Chief", as it was actually very common in that he separated more families than any other president.

@rkdowner @HappyinazLyn @RileighO @manuntdlove @EllenCFitch4 @RyanAFournier I'm not arguing or fighting for myself or to propagate beliefs.

@rkdowner @RileighO @HappyinazLyn @manuntdlove @EllenCFitch4 @RyanAFournier Not a scientific fact? Science is often wrong, firstly. It is a man-made institution. It is built on failure.
