@starryawsten And that is a conservative estimate.
@starryawsten The odds of a biological woman sexually assaulting my daughter is less than 1/2 of 1 percent. While the odds of her being attacked by pervert in the women's restroom is 1 in 10
@starryawsten It does if my daughter is a victim of a sexual assault in the restroom.
@starryawsten Uh no. Men dressed as women.
@starryawsten I do not and will never condone men in the women's restroom. Ever.
@starryawsten Then you had better be careful what you wish for. That Me too hashtag, everyone was yelling last year... is just the beginning. There are too many perverts who are recording women already. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
@starryawsten If a man started wearing women's clothing just to be able to use the women's restroom, and then yelled IM A WOMAN... you'd be ok with that??
@starryawsten And people are just supposed to take their  word for it that they are TRANS, yet remain the same way they were born... simply because they FEEL different? That makes no sense.
@Ievltate @starryawsten Who said I was mad?? Just pointing out the obvious
@starryawsten The very word TRANS means to transition.  Where did you learn that bs?
@starryawsten As for TRANS people... they are changing from one to the other, but still remain the same on the inside. Can't change your genetics.
@starryawsten Actually... It's a stated fact that there are only two genders. Everything else is made up and irrelevant. Even the letters in LGBTQ do not prove more than two GENDERS. Last time I checked, those were sexual preferences. Not GENDERS.
@starryawsten You mean like... President Trump is a better president than Obama ever was?? Or, there are only two GENDERS?

@LilyOliviaBell @OhMyJessi you dont want to be considered a hypocrite, do you?
@LilyOliviaBell @OhMyJessi if pronouns matter... then you should also use them, address me as YOUR MAJESTY.

@LevyNeptune_ And if the 1 billion dollar mark is reached... Congress has to realize that we mean business. It's what the voters wanted.
@LevyNeptune_ Even at 400 dollars a person... small sacrifice to make for border.
@LevyNeptune_ Even so... 400 dollars per person is a small sacrifice for the wall.

@LevyNeptune_ Trump asked Congress for 5 billion... try again.
@Notawitchhunt It's called BYPASSING THE MIDDLEMAN

#GoFundTheWall President Trump asked Congress for 5 billion to fund the wall, they refused. Even if President Trump lost some of his supporters, he could still get the wall. 63 million+ voted for him. Ok, 5 bil ÷ 63 mil = about 80 dollars a person.

@ledelamora @Barb81146 @mluckovichajc Khashoggi's writings sometimes defended groups such as the Muslim  Brotherhood, considered a terrorist group by many, and in the 1980s, he  developed a relationship with Osama bin Laden. He may have lived here, but he was NOT an American Citizen.
