@smcanall Build the drive train in US and assemble everything in Mexico, and this requirement is met.  USMCA isnt much different than NAFTA.  It appears this is mostly an update rather than a wholesale rewrite, but I am still studying it. #justthefacts
@smcanall So, the agreement is that at least 40% of the value of a car will be produced by workers earning $16/hr or more.  Lots of wiggle room there.
Will you fight for MS timber to be included in new N. American trade pact? Canada has unfair advantages.  @cindyhydesmith @SenatorWicker @StevenPalazzo @espyforsenate @dbaria @JerameyForMS
@smcanall Here is a take that I think really puts it into macroeconomic perspective.  	https://t.co/dFAjDlmaPN
@smcanall Wait, I thought it was the Democrats.....
@smcanall China is likely to be a see/saw back and forth.  They just imposed $60B in tariffs last week.  Some of these tariff reductions Sunday are on machinery and raw goods they need to to produce other products.
@smcanall You can't believe everything you hear.  "Measure twice, cut once", you know.  The $16 auto wage in Mexico is fine with the Mexicans.  The Toyota plant in Baja is a lot closer to California $$$ than Blue Springs, MS is.
@smcanall I am proud of the slow and steady progress Mississippi continues to make.  We have come a long ways, and yet have a lot further to go.	I believe most honest Mississippians would agree with that appraisal.		Now , about you correcting your massive error....
@smcanall Don't let the facts get in the way of your pom poms.  You are dead wrong about the "5% to 75%".  Why not be a man and acknowledge your error, rather than double down on it?
@smcanall And it is 75% North American content, NOT US content.
@smcanall @RealDonad_Trump Fake news.   You are incorrect.  You check it out.
@smcanall https://t.co/czReJU9DRC
@smcanall https://t.co/MwdJ0H7rQW
@smcanall Get your facts straight.  Domestic content requirement is currently 62.5%.  This new agreement would increase it by 12.5%
@smcanall @RealDonad_Trump @NissanUSA @Toyota When he does something meaningful to level the playing field for Mississippi timber, beef, fruits &amp; vegetables, grain and cotton, ask me again.

@smcanall @paulgalloshow We have a lot of employers that can't find qualified workers and a lot of workers that can't find jobs to fit their qualifications.  Fixing that disconnect requires bipartisanship and vision.

@MScoastrat @smcanall @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @BillClinton You greatly underestimate the intelligence, industry, entrepreneurship, and long term strategic thinking of the Chinese.  Deng's vision put China on this path while the Clintons were still shopping at Mr. Sam's Ben Franklin store.

@smcanall @TheDemocrats Read up on the Belt and Road initiative.
@smcanall @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Any man looking at the global situation who does not make the Chinese a central concern is simply not paying attention.  When your president is an asterisk, your great-grandchildren will be speaking Mandarin in kindergarten.
@smcanall You are the one bragging on cash you got back from Trump.  I have been a deficit hawk for 35 years.  But your grandchildren will paythat debt for you, Pawpaw.  Their Chinese bankers and bosses will make sure that they do.
@smcanall All this over a guy who in all likelihood would sustain Roe for another 45 years.  "settled law."
@smcanall @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi It is not just a matter of personal finances.  Your share of the national debt will be foisted upon your grandchildren, and they will be struggling to pay it long after you are gone.
@smcanall @realDonaldTrump Congratulations on your tax cut.  Thank your grandchildren for their future labor to pay the debt and interest your tax cut created. I am sure the Chinese will appreciate taking your grandchildren's payments on your part of the debt they own long after you are pushing up daisies

@frankcorder there's no shame in my game, Frank!
@frankcorder repetition is crucial to  effective messaging.
@frankcorder you're welcome. Only silver lining from #mssen is that people are learning @ process. Elections are worth caring about.
@frankcorder I like this Twitter "debate" format.  Maybe Cochran would agree to "debate" Childers on Twitter!
@frankcorder slow down, Frank. Take your time and get it right. Thad Cochran is Haley Barbour's puppet. The recent campaign proved that.
@prchrbbc the Republicans won't have votes to override President in either chamber. The numbers aren't there.
@frankcorder that's the key difference. Travis will follow "Boss Mississippi" , while Cochran is Boss Haley's puppet. We finally agree!
@frankcorder "prospective", Frank. If Travis is 50th Democrat, he will hold balance of power. Staying uncommitted is the power position.
@frankcorder the word is "toe".  Sen. Childers will vote as he chooses. That's the beauty of being a Democrat: No Boss Haley.
@frankcorder if there is a contested vote for Democratic Leader, I would expect a freshman to keep his options open until caucus meets.
@frankcorder who else is running?  I've not heard of any leadership challenge planned in the Senate Democratic caucus.
@frankcorder Come January, I expect Mr. Reid will remain Democratic Leader, &amp; expect Mr. McConnell will no longer be a Senator.
@frankcorder who else is running for Democratic leader other than Sen. Reid?  It isn't like a Speaker vote.
@MSyallpolitics Frank, do you not understand how the US Senate is structured?  Ask Boss Haley to explain it to you.
@sanders_e that is a decision for the people of Mississippi to make, not Boss Hogg Barbour, his puppets, flunkies &amp; footmen.
@MouthoffYall no, we were taught not to play with our food.  But clearly Ole Uncle Thad has a taste for chevre &amp; mutton.
@sanders_e campaigns matter. Have you ever been a candidate, or are you just a watcher?
