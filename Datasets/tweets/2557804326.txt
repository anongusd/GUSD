@LadyThriller69 You get it! Yes!
@RyanAFournier @DeasonJeannie You're not kidding!
@FoxNews @jayb6203 @David_Bossie I can only speak the truth!
@FoxNews @jayb6203 @David_Bossie It should! It was horrific to live through!
@mark_olberding Good Question!
@Bible_Time @mark_olberding I love this!
@_LoveLike_JESUS @TrumpetOfGod1 Amen to that!
@nxtfazemjr @WayneDupreeShow Exactly!
@plaPRpro @WayneDupreeShow Sounds about right to me!
@deplorablem1ke It makes me sick!
@RealJack Absolutely!
@RealJamesWoods Too funny!
@BobForsman @RealJamesWoods That's Good!
@Gameonearth1 @RealJamesWoods @ArmyOfTrump1 Absolutely Agree!
@down45stairs @RealJamesWoods Let's hope so!
@deplorablem1ke @RealJamesWoods I truly believe that, whether you call it Karma or Divine Intervention, they'll get their's, no  one escapes in this life! I have chosen not to react to people that betray me, but I am starting to see that they will pay for it one way or another!
@RealJamesWoods I don't like to say that I hate anyone, but John Legend comes as close to hate as I can feel!
@CorrectWinger I don't know if sick covers how disgusting that is!
@CorrectWinger I totally agree!
@girl4_trump @SecretService @POTUS I am replying to John Cusack and I might have hit the wrong button. Sorry
@girl4_trump @SecretService @POTUS You're sick! I don't know how you celebs can sleep at night? You don't have a clue what living in the real world is like! Get a life!
@om2912 @RealJamesWoods @1stAirDel_USMCR I hope you didn't just figure that out! He couldn't have been more against us than he was and so blatantly too!
@zachbaron We all know this happens way too often! No man, including Brendan, would ever come forward with this info if it wasn't true! I grew up in 1 of those homes where little girls were prized! Brendan, I applaud you and welcome you back, I know it takes a ton of work! üôèüôè

@IvankaTrump Everyone loves to play the blame game, but no one will take responsibility for their actions! If you don't think the Big O didn't damage this country almost beyond repair, than you are clueless! We have come a long way in a short time if you're for America!
I am sick of the nonstop mudslinging, especially when we put up with 8 years of our country going down the tubes and you never heard a word about it! https://t.co/MrQLTI6dZ8

@laurielew1966 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump I'm glad you were so happy for 8 years!
@kwilli1046 @LjHaupt Oh, what a shame!
@DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump I love you guys! You definitely brighten my day!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS How many people did the previous President care about bringing home? After all, in his opinion, they are just volunteers!
@RexTillersom @LjHaupt Unbelievable!
@realDonaldTrump I am sorry, but you libtards need to get a life and get over the fact that Crooked Hillary didn't win! We had to put up with your horrific so called President for 8 grueling years! You will survive and probably prosper! https://t.co/wXb2Sds49B
@politicallynuts @MontyBoa99 @realDonaldTrump Sorry, but I totally disagree!
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Those libs have probably already voted 5 times each already! I still can't believe that they don't see how much Barry contributed to the downfall of our country! It's like he could walk them straight to ISIS &amp; they would say, 'Yes Sir!' Mind blowing!
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Those libs have probably voted 5 times each already!
