@MichellePangle When the cameras are on her the only thing going through my head is she's a snake
@PinkGlitz_84 She doesn't look like an idiot for standing up for Stephanie. Stephanie looks like an idiot for throwing her under the bus when she stuck out her net for her
@fenthecity Did you see how she turned back to her and kind of puckered up her lips and rolled her eyes. But she don't pull that shit when the doors are unlocked

@sejeeks Keep in mind a couple episodes ago she said that she fit in and that Jaclin didn't and that if something went down they would have her back because she's a inmate.
@monicaalexiea now hopefully jaclin we'll see you. Stephanie is a coward who means her no good. I feel like jaclin came in with good intentions. And Stephanie came in so she can get some Street cred for being looked up. ugh Dumb take it from me getting locked up is nothing to be proud of
@lola_lovebird I caught that I was like damn she's so hard but she ran to the cops
@Prettyassmyyaaa I agree 100%
@rennrob amen he makes me want to shove pencils in my ears
#60DaysIn I've been locked up many times and I would never turn my back on somebody that stuck neck out to help me. I hope swole beats Stephanie ass
#60DaysIn I bet any friends that Stephanie had on the outside she will no longer have when they see how quick she is to throw somebody under the bus that tried to help her.
