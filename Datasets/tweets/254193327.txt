@wrapmymind @kie_means @lindanoto47 @realDonaldTrump So, when unemployment was counted it didn't show true because if you're not active in the state department of unemployment you are not considered unemployed. The true numbers are in the participation rates. Obama wasn't interested in the participation rate. It made him look bad.
@wrapmymind @kie_means @lindanoto47 @realDonaldTrump As far as proof goes. If you want it bad enough it's there you just have to look for it. You won't find it if you don't want to. Look for employment participation statistics. The last administration ignored these because so many ppl dropped off when their unemployment stopped.
@wrapmymind @kie_means @lindanoto47 @realDonaldTrump So, libs want ppl to shop local, they back American unions, want cheap goods from china, want raw milk sold in stores &amp; free healthcare. Libs claim they're not racists or sexists but always use minorities to push their agenda's. Libs wear them till they're not useful anymore.
@wrapmymind @kie_means @lindanoto47 @realDonaldTrump I've seen that libs complained about products made in china when they're the ppl who raised corp tax rates that forced companies to move so they could compete. Now libs are all saying that Trump is making everything more expensive because he raised tariffs. So libs want china?

@kie_means @wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @realDonaldTrump I'm just bored &amp; thought I'd have a little back &amp; forth. You spoiled  my fun.üòõ
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump "Wholly shit" a very very rare lib.	That must be awfully difficult so you better concentrate carefully so you don't get hurt playing video games &amp; doing online surveys.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump If you knew the real truth we wouldn't be tweeting each other.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump At least he got a lib that wipes. Your very rare.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Wow, you must be a real catch.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Your so sweet. Like a wood tick.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Can't ever tell.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Just mocking your libness.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/E0zwzmTTIE
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Seriously seriously seriously seriously seriously. WOW
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump All factual.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump You sure are a head shaker.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Obviously you are a little young person.otherwise you wouldn't have started playing that juvenile game.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Lib turned liberal into with other people's money.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Look it up. Special one.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump If all these libs had more personal responsibility with a job they wouldn't be protesting or paid to protest.	Which they are working more now so these stupid protests &amp; riots are much less now. MSM misses it though because they love reporting worthlessness. https://t.co/eym3eF5ZyR
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Conservatives get shit on all the time. Look at msm &amp; npr. We just keep going about our business.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/BT6PZTahfI
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump You defend and forget. I see. Same old lib shit.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump I know the difference it's the libs that don't when the libs provoke violence.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump Well then, your one of the few libs that disapproved lib riots then.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump You forgot how obama made fun of special Olympic bowling. You spout &amp; forget huh?
@lindanoto47 @wrapmymind @kie_means @realDonaldTrump I don't protest bs. That a lib thang.
@lindanoto47 @wrapmymind @kie_means @realDonaldTrump If that is so. Why riot over lies, play race cards, sex cards &amp; any card that you think will get ppl angry &amp; violent. Libs are always trying to get others to hurt them so they can prove that others are violent. Libs always have to bully the violence out of people. Libs are SAD.
@wrapmymind @lindanoto47 @kie_means @realDonaldTrump When some lib says that the conservatives divided our nation when more ppl of all races &amp; sexes are working. I find they r part of the problem &amp; not the solution. If you want division keep voting for libs &amp; their blame games. Conservatives create jobs &amp; makes ppl proud &amp; usefull. https://t.co/VCDWf2tAHZ
@lindanoto47 My poor wifey voted for obama the 1st time &amp; she slowly learned he was an antisemite &amp; against the State of Israel through his actions &amp; statements.

@lindanoto47 @kie_means @wrapmymind @realDonaldTrump Real is the $$'s obama bribed insurance companies with that wasn't approved by congress.

@beauty_88 @andrewkurtser Just stating facts.
@beauty_88 @andrewkurtser Dems praise to this day, progressive Woodrow Wilson. Wilson came into office when congress was "NOT" segregated &amp; he REsegregated congress. He had also kept at least 1 black person to show he wasn't racist. He was also a leading individual &amp; very active in the KKK. Still praised?
@beauty_88 There was a time when everyone knew all black ppl were Republicans. That's one reason Democrats had their militant group the KKK.	Now Dems are calling Republicans hitler &amp; KKK. When we all know that both would never lower taxes, reduce government or defend the Constitution.
@beauty_88 @andrewkurtser I'd like to know what kind of racially insensitive games the Republicans are playing. Give me something I can check for credibility.
@beauty_88 @andrewkurtser We had less racism before Obama. Why do so many say they voted for him because he's black? If everyone is jealous of employers why don't they all take the financial &amp; physical risks &amp; start companies just to have ppl say they didn't. They can't really believe what they're saying?
@beauty_88 @andrewkurtser Unemployment is down &amp; employers are bringing jobs back &amp; they are starving for employees. They're willing to train &amp; some ppl just don't want to work after having yrs of tax payer funded vacation. It's time to quit blaming ppl who provide jobs &amp; get back some self respect.	Work.
@beauty_88 @andrewkurtser I've seen ppl claim racism when they don't get what they want &amp; I've seen people claim racism when they get what they want. But when Democrats throw it out there to get votes, that's racism to a degree most won't sink to. But they've learned it works. Republicans don't do that.
@beauty_88 @andrewkurtser The left runs the schools.	The left demonizes employers.	The left destroys jobs w/over taxing &amp; over regulation.
