@TrivialGravitas i mean i wouldn't be opposed to bumping up and seeing what happened but even then i suspect you wouldn't see many built without georgia style interventions to minimize investor risk
@TrivialGravitas in 2018, the federal production tax credit for wind/solar was 2.4 cents per kilowatt hour. for nuclear it was 1.8 cents per kilowatt hour. would be fine to bump up the latter, but that's not the main reason nuclear is struggling to get built.

@jacklienke how hard/time-consuming would it be to rewrite the regulation with new targets, i wonder? (though obviously it still needs to get through the courts, which seems less likely now than it did three years ago.)
@chezrebellion yeah i don't really understand the political calculus here. it's not like her resolution has a much easier path to 60 votes or whatever
Although the call to restore the Clean Power Plan in its original form is odd — doing so today might cut emissions a bit, but it's obvious to anyone paying attention that the original reg is quickly being outpaced by market trends.
I'd missed that Feinstein made her own climate resolution. Not as ambitious as the Green New Deal, though the difference between this and the GND is pretty small compared to the vast gulf between what we're doing today and what either bill calls for: https://t.co/qFu7utmTLF

@Noahpinion I like this piece and it makes a lot of smart points but I don't really see how it's an "alternative" Green New Deal. It's more or less the same thing being proposed in the GND with an emphasis on R&amp;D spending and tech transfer (the latter is the biggest overlooked point).
@BenjySarlin that would also make sense!
Is there any consensus on whether the Green New Deal calls for a 100% carbon-free grid within 10 years or instead calls for a 10-year mobilization with the aim of reaching that goal at some unspecified point? The resolution text is a bit ambiguous here: https://t.co/Hb7QtDi3b8

@seanilling @dwallacewells not a big deal. it was a really good interview! (also congrats and best of luck on impending fatherhood — i'm about a week or two away from it myself.)
@dwallacewells @seanilling yah, i wouldn't have phrased it that way but i'm definitely not trying to be anyone's editor! was really just curious where this came from
@dwallacewells @seanilling That's a bit different from saying the warming itself will kill 150 million from air pollution. The deaths are a function of PM/ozone, not temp levels		(For instance: We could avoid most of those pollution deaths by replacing coal with gas—but still blow well past 2°C.)
@dwallacewells @seanilling Ahhhh, I see. This paper is about the health benefits from reducing fossil fuel emissions in two different scenarios—the faster 1.5C-compatible scenario avoids more deaths from less PM/ozone.		(Which makes sense: Air pollution already leads to 9 million premature deaths/year.)
@seanilling yeah fair!
@seanilling Yeah sorry the timeline for 2C is fine. I was asking about the deaths stat
@seanilling This paper says that if we cut fossil fuel emissions enough to hold to 2C we’ll *avoid* 150 million deaths thanks to reduced air pollution
@seanilling Where does that stat come from? That does not sound correct
@peteirvine that's a huge gap between SSP3—7.0 and SSP4—6.0 — sort of feels like somewhere in there is a very plausible "policy failure" outcome
@ElephantEating @JustinHGillis this is the only piece i've seen that tries to quantify what's happened so far but i can't find the underlying data? https://t.co/Ronxhfr4Q1		in any case, @andrew_leach surely knows a lot more
@ElephantEating @JustinHGillis Alberta might be the best place to look — they implemented a ~$20 (and rising) carbon tax in 2017 and, unlike other Canadian provinces like BC, have a FF-heavy grid.
@jmcurtin @ElephantEating which proposals, in the US?
@ElephantEating Australia is a weird case. Emissions did fall from 2012-14 though mainly because utilities were (unsustainably) tapping existing hydro reservoirs and scaling back coal burning in anticipation of repeal. And then the backlash came and the gains vanished. https://t.co/e8Jusg4SoQ

@ElephantEating @jg_environ It seems like carbon prices work extremely quickly when there are mature pollution control techs ready for widespread adoption (coal-to-gas in the UK, scrubbers/PB coal in the US).

@DustinMulvaney @JasonBordoff Though I will say, the fact that everyone now remembers Waxman-Markey as merely cap-and-trade and not also a massive government-directed overhaul of America's energy infrastructure/economy says a lot about the politics and selling of that bill.
@DustinMulvaney @JasonBordoff i'm admittedly lumping both bills together. all the stuff in my last tweet was in waxman markey though. https://t.co/vXRyyL31je
@JasonBordoff Things like national transmission planning, national vehicle charging reqs, advanced manufacturing spending, a clean development bank? I guess it's a fine line between correcting market failures and industrial policy. I'm curious if the GND will be a difference of degree or kind.
@DustinMulvaney @yayitsrob there were also a bunch of grid investments too though i forget what the end result was there. the HSR piece obviously didn't pan out so well.
You could argue that stuff was overshadowed by a convoluted carbon-trading scheme, or that the spending piece was too small, or that the bill's politics were bad (it failed. after all!). All fair. I'm just not sure green industrial policy is as new an idea as it seems?
Waxman-Markey often gets cast, as here, as a "narrow market mechanism" (cap-and-trade!). But the actual bill proposed a ton of industrial policy too—a nationwide RPS, huge amounts of spending on infrastructure, R&amp;D, worker transition programs, etc. https://t.co/ouanQ8OqDs

@TamarHaspel @atrembath @tomphilpott @ramez @yayitsrob and i certainly don't know if the GND can overcome that. but presidential candidates are a good place to look—i suspect they'll now face more pressure to start articulating climate policies than they did before. which at least plays some role in platform development.

@ScipioAcheronus @EnergyInnovLLC mostly yes, although i believe there are some important nuances here. this is a much more detailed explanation of how the model avoids double counting https://t.co/jTFIbVkEQq
@futurepundit @ScipioAcheronus Yep, and that's going up over time as cars get more reliable. (Also, a big mandated ramp-up of EVs could conceivably spur a lot of people to keep older gasoline cars around even longer because they don't want to go electric. Hard to model, but could further blunt the CO2 impact.)
@ScipioAcheronus @futurepundit other factor is that light-duty vehicles are only ~60% of US transportation emissions today and declining over time. 		the grid stuff is a smaller factor but matters. even with the current grid, EVs still cut emissions, but the impact gets bigger as you clean up the grid
@ScipioAcheronus @futurepundit sorry i missed this. biggest issue here by far is that turnover is slow. last year new car sales only represented 6% of the total fleet, and older cars can last 15+ years on the road. so even if new EV sales rise very quickly, it takes awhile for the total fleetwide % to catch up

@simoncarreau yep, constant. looked at adjusting for inflation and even fluctuating exchange rates but got overly messy projecting out and doesn't make a large difference to emissions. but key underlying point is higher tax = bigger cuts.

@simoncarreau i went back and forth on whether to *keep* the price rising after 2033 or stick with what's on the books. ultimately decided on the latter but if you keep increasing linearly through 2050 you do get a bigger effect on emissions. (same goes if you start with a higher price.)
@simoncarreau BC's carbon tax started in 2008 and will reach max in 2021. our carbon tax basically starts in 2020 and reaches the same max in 2033—keeping to the same schedule but reflecting a later start.

@LFFriedman @JessePesta 😱😱😱
@ramez great questions and i am super curious about 1 — how much consumers are swayed by total cost of ownership vs upfront cost comparisons.
@MBazilian @LFFriedman in fairness, a vast many things in climate policy have been clear for some time!
@mlaz_sei @RichardMeyerDC yes to both, it does look like the efficiency standards are modeled as having a smaller effect if there's a carbon tax in place as well.
@1gregdotson @atrembath @BlackiLi @nytimes @EnergyInnovLLC yep, the model accounts for the interactions. biggest extra effect a carbon tax gets you if layered on top a CES is that it cuts coal emissions much much quicker in the early years (through fuel switching/efficiency)
@Innovabo @dana1981 @citizensclimate yes, though it's a bit of a idiosyncratic design that exempts electricity and has a lower rate for industry. i looked at sweden but decided BC's was simpler to translate to a US context.
@dana1981 @citizensclimate yep, as noted, we tried to stick closely to things that have already been enacted in at least analogous form around the world. but there are tons of other policy ideas out there — some, like a much higher carbon price, that could have a bigger impact.
@busbyj2 i do think the cost of a norway style push might be unpalatable in a us political context. but we tried to limit to things other places are already doing, which made it hard to include shifting diets. (though possibly i could've tried to find an existing model for that.)
@jmbanks @JustinHGillis @EnergyInnovLLC thank you!
@jmbanks @JustinHGillis @EnergyInnovLLC i'll be honest, i completely missed what mexico is doing on methane and wish i had dug in more. is there a good starting place to read up on?
@RL_Miller @atrembath @BlackiLi @nytimes @EnergyInnovLLC i had a link in the piece but it might be a little hard to find. it's.... extensive. particularly the high VAT on gas/diesel cars that EVs are exempted from: https://t.co/7VxsL3u9iI		Also a paper from 2016 here that delved into the details more closely: https://t.co/1gRLlCQRUw
@atrembath @BlackiLi @nytimes @EnergyInnovLLC in fairness, probably the single biggest thing the US could do to cut emissions is a $300/ton carbon tax (or whatever) but we wanted to limit to things that are already in progress place in the world today
100% agree with this. I mentioned this explicitly at the end of the piece but worth emphasizing more loudly. The effectiveness of climate policies is hugely sensitive to tech advances that are tough (or impossible) to predict more than a decade or so out. https://t.co/9HgQg0m7v2
@noahqk yep, agreed 100%. (it's explicit in the very last paragraph of the piece but i could completely see an argument that it should be much higher and louder.)
@RichardMeyerDC yes, the turnover issue was hard. (it's also possible we were way too conservative in aiming for energy use reductions but even doubling would leave the same basic shape.) also, crucially, we didn't touch appliances which is something that could act much more quickly
@tjl also looks uncannily like christopher walken in case it's not too soon to plan the biopic
@SEI_Erickson fair! there were definitely quite a few we left out and that's a big one
@JasonBordoff absolutely. and it does seem of those 7 the EVs are going to be the real outlier in terms of cost per $, at least early on (i looked into modeling alternatives like a france-style feebate for cars, but had a tough time passing up EVs.)
@DrJaneFlegal admittedly i was just trying to sidestep that tech question as much as possible — it doesn't really matter for modeling emissions, though obviously it could matter hugely for cost/feasibility/implementation
@gilbeaq @alannogee oh interesting. has anyone tried that yet?
@alannogee yes, to some extent there is overlap between the two although adding the carbon tax tends to lead to faster emissions reductions in the early years (from fuel switching/efficiency) than a CES alone would. (plus the revenue)
Anyway, you can check out our piece for more on the methodology and assumptions used: https://t.co/ZDmoSiLuoI		For more fun, @EnergyInnovLLC has a fascinating policy simulator that lets you design and model your own climate policies: https://t.co/g09uw7u1Z5 /end
By far the biggest caveat here is that we're assuming all these policies work as intended—which, as we note, is hardly assured.		For much more detail on smart climate policy design (and keeping costs down), it's worth checking out this book: https://t.co/SnWm5MSam5 /12
Final takeaway: Even after some really big (and not easy!) climate policies, we're only halfway to zero. Deep decarbonization would require going far beyond what any country anywhere has tried to date. Industry and agriculture in particular are two hard, oft-neglected areas. /11
Curbing HFCs and f-gases has a potentially large impact on emissions (though the exact amount is sensitive to projections of future HFC use). Worth noting that this is a policy that a fair number of Republicans support: https://t.co/HhGYiMDB29 /10 https://t.co/zixiZsCyy9
Which is just a way of saying that if you want to decarbonize transportation quickly, you'll need a lot more than just electric cars (reducing driving miles is one big area to look at). Plus there's still trucking, shipping, aviation... /9
Meanwhile, it's really, really hard to cut transportation emissions quickly. Even with an aggressive push to ramp up electric car sales (and Norway-style policies are extremely aggressive!), the long delay in fleet turnover means that vehicle emissions fall relatively slowly. /8 https://t.co/UY2ZQjpW7k
Elsewhere, getting to 100% carbon-free electricity in the next few decades would take a large bite out of US emissions — but is still only one piece of a much bigger puzzle. /7 https://t.co/0KGIUNRVZD
On the other hand, few policies work as *quickly* as a carbon tax to cut emissions. In the modeling, many policies take years before they have a big impact. Carbon pricing makes a dent right away — partly by spurring utilities to switch away from coal much more rapidly. /6
A few points I noticed: The models suggest you can make big, rapid cuts to emissions with a high carbon tax. But if you're limited to the lower carbon pricing levels that have so far been attainable around the world, you'd need a bunch of additional policies to get deep cuts. /5
Many thanks to @robbieorvis, @megmahajan and @silvio_marcacci for working with us on this, providing smart advice, and doing the modeling. And @BlackLi did the great visuals /4
This obviously isn't the *only* way to tackle climate change (and probably isn't even the best). It's more a way of seeing that there are already a bunch of policies being pursued around the world that could really add up if adopted more widely. /3
One big takeaway: With just 7 actions, they estimate you could cut US emissions roughly in half.		That includes a moderate carbon tax (like British Columbia has), a clean electricity standard (like CA or NY are doing), a huge push on EVs (Norway-style) plus a few others. /2
Our latest: We were curious to see how far the US could cut emissions if it adopted just a handful of the most ambitious policies that are already in place around the world.		So @EnergyInnovLLC helped us explore, using their energy policy model: https://t.co/ZDmoSiLuoI /1

This is also a fair point. Climate policy is inevitably going to be much, much broader than just emissions policy — whether it's done proactively through something like a Green New Deal or reactively in a thousand different ways. https://t.co/QZ2Go0K2lC
@gilbeaq depending on what you do with the revenue it could be broader than just an emissions policy but otherwise yeah

@gilbeaq yeah. this has made me realize i should be much more consistent about separating out "climate policy" from "emissions policy." you'd expect the former to be much broader than the later.

@archibaldcrane @CostaSamaras but you'd still expect efficiency to shave off those winter/summer peaks regardless of whether you shifted to electric heating or not
@joshdr83 i bet you could make some of those device curves steeper if everyone were legally required to have one though
@jg_environ @CostaSamaras yes even if you had 100% clean electricity you'd still (probably) have to deal with direct heating emissions if you wanted to get to net zero
@mattyglesias maybe i'm miscounting but i don't think he had a staff of eight either?
@jneeley78 yeah, as others have pointed out, if you can shave off winter/summer demand peaks, that's less capacity you need to build
@AriPeskoe this tweet is triggering, to me

A question about the Green New Deal. If we got to 100% clean electricity by 2030 (a big if, sure, I know), how important would it be to retrofit buildings to make them more efficient? At that point, you really just ("just") have to tackle heating systems, right?

@fsholars i don't think you could reasonably replace *all* air travel by rail
@vt2tamu there is a big gap between "more high speed rail than exists today" and "high speed rail in every single state, including mississippi."
@planktoncounter oh interesting. the tricky part, of course, is that the very longest flights (about 20% of the total) are responsible for about 60% of aviation emissions, and that's by far the toughest bit to crack.
@gilbeaq i think you could readily decarbonize a lot of short-haul flights with things like rail (and maybe even electric one day?). the tricky part is that the longest 20% of flights are about 60% of aviation emissions—that's the toughest to crack.
@jneeley78 i'm sure people fly between a lot of those cities!
I'd be curious if anyone's figured out how many short-haul flights in the US you could reasonably replace with high-speed rail. (Getting those routes built is, obviously, a harder question...)

@chrisnelder @RichardMeyerDC i don't quite think any of @jessejenkins papers answer this but i could've easily missed it.
@chrisnelder @RichardMeyerDC fair point. i wonder if anyone's modeled what power emissions would be if you pushed WWS + plausible storage tech as far as it'd go and kept gas to bridge the remaining gaps.
@KevinSLeahy @RichardMeyerDC yes that's what i was referring to in my parenthetical
@RichardMeyerDC because modeled WWS scenarios are unable to handle winter heating peaks like this? (i'm familiar with the broader skepticism around these systems, but more curious what the specific issue here would be.)
@lowerthetemp possibly, though that depends on how a supreme court that's now shifting to the right views CAA authority
Also, it's not enough for climate legislation simply to pass into law. It also has to be durable in the face of future Congresses that may try to amend or repeal it. (That is possible—e.g., wind/solar tax credits have had serious ups and downs but have been relatively resilient.)

@hausfath @rhodium_group yep, we covered that too. but I did appreciate the extra detail here
@JosOlivier @RichardMeyerDC 😱 i did not realize this, thank you!
@climateMorrow @RichardMeyerDC it looks like wind/solar grew at approximately the same rate in 2018 as it did in 2017. but electricity demand fell in 2017 but rose sharply in 2018. so... gas made up the difference (plus a little bit more nuclear output, it looks like).
@ericgrote yep, only for CO2. which is usually about 3/4 of GHGs. (but agreed that monitoring methane is incredibly important.)
@alannogee @RichardMeyerDC i would guess that's part of it though would love to see better data on this. to the extent that's happening, possibly not as bad news for global emissions/climate change
@RichardMeyerDC frustratingly, the NCDC page is down, but to add: my understanding is that 2018 winter wasn't *that* cold on a historical basis, but was a very large change from the extremely mild 2017 winter.
@RichardMeyerDC that's fair! although eyeballing the EIA data it does look like there's been a significant increase throughout the year.
@CoddingtonKipp if we want to move toward deep decarbonization i think gas CCS is looking pretty necessary
@ScottLuft certainly after this year's increase, i think you're a lot more likely to be right about this!
@madmanx89 That could certainly be part of the big increase in industrial emissions, though unfortunately it'll take awhile to get good consumption-based emissions numbers. But to the extent that's happening, it'd certainly be not as bad news for climate change.
@KevinSLeahy genuine question because i don't know and would be interested in hearing your take — isn't there a moral hazard problem if ratepayers are on the hook for wildfire costs? does it reduce incentive for utility to take preventive measures?
(Oh, last caveat: This is only a preliminary estimate, and EIA/EPA will release their own official numbers later this year/next if the government ever reopens. But Rhodium was pretty close to the mark in its preliminary estimate last year, so I wouldn't expect a huge difference.)
@planktoncounter oh wow, i wonder if any of that due to rising capacity factors in new installations (presumably most of it is not). that's a really striking variation.
Also, it doesn't look like the emissions increase last year was primarily a result of Trump's policy rollbacks (those will take time to have an impact). But the dismantling of climate policy puts us a lot farther away from any sort of deep decarbonization trajectory. /that's all
As @rhodium_group notes, to meet that Paris pledge, America's energy-related CO2 emissions would have to fall about 2.6% per year, on average, over the next seven years — twice as fast as the average rate of decline between 2005 and 2017. Possible? Of course. Easy? No. /5
Anyway, it's only one year, and emissions could very conceivably fall again in 2019 (a recession could do it, though let's hope not). But it's becoming extremely hard to see how the U.S. meets its Paris pledge (~26% below 2005 levels) without a massive course correction. /4
Also notable: Electricity demand rose last year as the economy grew, but much of that demand was met by natural gas. Wind and solar power didn't expand fast enough to fill the gap. We'll see if 2019 is different, with a rush of projects before tax credits wind down. /3
Part of last year's emissions increase was weather-related, but one big story here was a surge in emissions from the industrial sector, trucking, and air travel — all areas that have gotten relatively little attention from policymakers to date: https://t.co/i4m1Fe2rMW /2 https://t.co/G1IXzqWf93
Yeesh. U.S. carbon dioxide emissions appear to have increased by ~3.4% in 2018, the biggest rise in eight years, according to a preliminary @rhodium_group estimate. 		And that was *despite* a record number of coal plant retirements last year: https://t.co/i4m1Fe2rMW /1

@noahqk @rypeterson yeah, to be clear, everything in this thread is separate from the debate about the usefulness of carbon taxes as a policy tool. (one can certainly believe that we'll never know the SCC, we should stay below 2C as a precaution, *and* that carbon taxes are the best way to do so.)
@Pr1nceOfDarknes yes, though in their models they don't cover the entire reservoirs — only about 27% of the total to get 10% generation. but you'd still want to do much closer analysis for other potential conflicts.
@FrckngQrtrly it started at $15 but would've reached roughly $55 in 2035. not that high compared to what you'd probably need for deep decarbonization. but high relative to what most countries have!
@scianalysis @yayitsrob @JustinHGillis @samori8 @RyanMKellogg @globeandmail fair points, though this piece was awfully persuasive that the knock-on devastation in indonesia will probably overwhelm any other possible benefits. (though i realize US policy wasn't the only driver here.) https://t.co/Ei3iXyCoJ3
@ersatzverite oh gotcha. on that definitely agree!
@ersatzverite yes, carbon taxes can be an effective emissions reduction tool, not sure that's in question. but if you think paranoid climate advocates are satisfied with UK levels of emissions you need to spend more time with paranoid climate advocates!
@daveregrets @benserrurier @MichaelWWara tagging me in at this late stage seems plainly unfair. i was excited to read the original troll tweet and now it's gone!
@ScipioAcheronus no, it was quite clear! i think my quibble derailed the thread!
@ScipioAcheronus yeah, agreed. but the *rates* of growth still matter to a lot of people living today. (although at this point i confess i'm not sure what we're arguing about or if we're even arguing!)
@ScipioAcheronus i do genuinely wonder what would be the right advice. the loss of ecosystems since 1600 has been *staggering*. but the improvement in human welfare has also been staggering. there'd be some incredibly tough trade-offs to think about.
@dontmeanathing @emahlee @MichaelEMann @PopovichN @nytclimate still true two months later!
@croselund @gwsolar @NREL in the big picture that seems certainly true although i do wonder about local areas where there might be conflicts (as others have noted in response). but seems good that there's a promising alternative here if so
@ScipioAcheronus not entirely sure about this one. we wouldn't know because earth only gets one model run, but life would certainly be very different if countries had decided to keep coal in the ground from the start.
@gilbeaq yeah, preventing evaporation and (i'd assume?) bromate formation seem like decent side benefits worth quantifying for a lot of reservoirs, esp. in places like california.
@DaveScottSC completely agree.
Interesting. I'm not sure how big a constraint land actually is for solar power, but NREL finds that there's enough space in existing reservoirs to put floating panels worth ~10% of US electricity demand. Plus, helps reduce evaporation: https://t.co/3O8uIxJ0Ro
@rexeudank yes! as i said in tweet #10, that's how most climate advocates see the policy nowadays. but the original concept was about aligning costs and benefits, not necessarily deterrence as the ultimate goal.
@flyingless yeah, the division isn't perfect — marty weitzman, who's been hugely influential in critiquing the nordhaus view on this stuff, is also an economist!
@electronecon yeah, it's certainly not a perfect division. (for one, marty weitzman is an economist!)
@morfca to be clear, i agree!
@RyanMKellogg absolutely. and some of your colleagues are looking at trying to fold in adaptation too. i think i mentioned in another reply somewhere here but i do think SCCs can be really useful, though their limitations are also important
@JimmyMayfield yes, i'm purposefully ignoring lots of things. it's a short twitter thread!
@alannogee @RogerPielkeJr I'm not convinced the social cost of carbon is useless. If the EPA is regulating coal plant pollution and needs to tally climate benefits, using the best available SCC seems like it gets you closer to the mark than using nothing. But that doesn't mean it's THE answer.
@yayitsrob @JustinHGillis @samori8 @RyanMKellogg @globeandmail To me, the worst thing about mandates is that they run a high risk of being poorly designed and completely counterproductive. Europe's diesel disaster or America's ethanol experiment are cases in point. But that's more a pitfall to watch out for than an argument for pricing only.
@TopherTBrennan the world bank did a big report a few years back on 4°C. i've seen very little on 6°C — which, again, does not look super likely but is not completely out of the question either. https://t.co/QNbXh7afC9
Economics and science can help shed light on these questions, but they're probably never going to give us THE answer on how much warming is optimal. It's a huge judgment call, under a cloud of massive uncertainty, with the fate of civilization possibly at stake. Fun times... /bye
One drawback with the insurance view is that we're still in fuzzy territory, economically. It's hard to say exactly how much insurance we need, or when mitigation costs become unacceptably high. (Most people agree that staying below 1°C seems too costly, but after that...?) /11
Most climate hawks see the problem in roughly this way, even if it's not always articulated like that. For them, a carbon tax is a *tool* for reducing emissions to a certain level, usually to zero. The social cost of carbon is not an end in itself. /10
If so, then we probably want to keep total global warming below a certain level. (Many people see 2°C or 1.5°C as a safe level.) It's not enough to say, "Let's just impose a social cost of carbon on polluters and if people want to pay it, that's still economically efficient." /9
This is essentially an argument that it's inappropriate to think of global warming merely as a giant cost-benefit problem. Instead, we should think of it more as an insurance problem: We want to insure against truly catastrophic outcomes. /8
(Plus there are a bunch of other problems with figuring out the "right" social cost of carbon. How do you value the destruction of ecosystems? What about discount rates? What about potential climate impacts we don't even know about yet? Etc.) /7
There's also a non-trivial chance that 4°C or 6°C of warming would destroy human civilization as we know it. Maybe it's only a 5% chance. But do you want to get in a plane with a 5% chance of crashing? How about a planet? /6
But there's good reason to doubt anyone can calculate the "correct" social cost of carbon. As Marty Weitzman argues here, economic models basically become guesswork at high levels of warming. We have very little clue what 4°C or 6°C will cost. https://t.co/77Sd5bfruE /5
So what's the problem with this way of looking at things? One critique is that it requires faith that policymakers can get a decent handle on what the social cost of carbon actually *is* — on how much damage global warming will cause — and set the tax at a proper level. /4
Importantly, this view does *not* require getting emissions down to zero. If people are willing to pay the tax and keep burning fossil fuels, fine! That just means the benefits exceed the costs. We're at an economically optimal level of emissions and warming. /3
The original economic rationale for a carbon tax was that polluters should be required to pay for and internalize the damage they cause by polluting. So: Let's figure out the economic cost of global warming and tax fossil-fuel users accordingly—ie, the "social cost of carbon." /2
Okay, why not. One more thread on carbon pricing because I think this below is an important point worth expanding on. Economists and climate advocates often *do* think of carbon taxes very differently. https://t.co/mRMVhJJgvH /1
@alannogee @JustinHGillis yep. and on that i totally agree. it's a bad thing to fetishize!
@EDimantchev i do think it is clear that renewable portfolio standards are an easier lift politically than carbon pricing.
@seanholeary1 yep, agreed, that's what i said in tweet #6 (and justin explains well in his piece).
@RogerPielkeJr a carbon tax only addresses the green paradox if it's universal, right?
@jdeely @SolarInMASS @jtemple in retrospect, underestimating the sheer range of things george church is involved in at any given time was an *obviously* unwise thing to do on my part
But you can also imagine plenty of scenarios where the choices are more nuanced. I'm not sure there's a universal rule to follow here! It's probably dangerous to *obsess* over carbon pricing, but it can still be quite useful. /that's all
You could imagine a scenario where a political party has only two choices: Push a clean electricity standard likely to pass (say) or a carbon tax that isn't. In that case, sure—the former is more effective at cutting emissions. A policy that exists beats a policy that doesn't. /8
But whether some level of carbon price makes sense as part of a bigger package of policies... depends. Does the tax make the politics harder or easier in that specific moment? Could the tax be swapped out for other, more palatable policies that cut emissions? /7
So, I dunno! If anyone suggests that a carbon tax alone will solve the problem, that's almost certainly wrong. For one, as @JustinHGillis explains, it's unlikely to lead to sweeping changes in sectors like transportation or buildings — two big sources of emissions. /6
It's clear that a high carbon price can be a political loser, as Washington State showed. But the same goes for lots of ambitious climate policies — like Arizona's proposed 50% renewable standard. Ambitious policies, in general, are hard and attract fierce opposition. /5
You can definitely design a lot of policies to cut emissions that *don't* feature a carbon price. CAFE standards, clean energy standards, etc. But a carbon price can also do things—and spur cuts—that those policies can't. (CAFE standards don't affect older cars at all, e.g.) /4
But as part of a package of policies? Maybe! The RGGI cap-and-trade system in the Northeast has used a (low) carbon price to fund efficiency programs, home weatherization, R&amp;D, solar/wind investments. It seems to work decently well, if modestly. https://t.co/XJgfXcApPl /3
On the one hand, it's *extremely* unlikely that any real-world carbon tax, on its own, will ever be totally sufficient to get climate change under control (as Nordhaus once argued). The price would have to be way, way higher than political constraints would likely allow. /2
Smart piece, though I'm still conflicted about the question. To me, it's hard to judge whether a carbon tax proposal is good or bad unless you actually drill down into specifics! Depends on what exactly is being proposed and where. https://t.co/DcsUnBi81A /1
@SolarInMASS @jtemple ha, yeah. i don't think george church is going to switch gears and invent a better battery at this point in life. i would be curious to see actual numbers on the climate impact of this mammoth business though — have only seen a lot of hand-waving so far

@dotcommodity it all depends on how the program is designed. RGGI also had a "cap," but my understanding is that the biggest effect it had, at least early on, was to raise revenue (through pricing, which is what cap-and-trade is) for efficiency/renewable programs, etc.
@Ritysayo ha, fair! "9 states from the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and possibly, depending on what geographical boundaries you favor, the Southeast"
The background is that states are making a lot of headway on cutting electricity emissions, but even blue, climate-focused states are really struggling to deal with vehicle emissions. And that task gets even harder if Trump rolls back CAFE standards: https://t.co/I04g8F4XA4 https://t.co/tOYLJnREMk
Lots of details still need to be worked out, but at a very basic level, this could end up being a program that puts a price on transportation fuels and then uses the money to, say, invest in public transit, transit-oriented development, electric vehicle infrastructure, etc.

My rough sense is that tax credits can be a useful tool for helping to deploy early-stage technology and driving down costs (as has happened with wind and solar), but past a certain stage it's an extremely expensive way of getting more clean energy.
@jgkoomey what do you think of reforming the EV credit so that it's not 200,000 *per automaker* but rather something industry-wide? probably there's been discussion of that but i've missed it.

@noahqk @DrJaneFlegal yeah, good point. i know there's been a kerfluffle around that 10% number, but honestly, the idea that 8°C (!) of warming would *only* take a 10% bite seems a ludicrous way of thinking about the risks that that massive an increase would pose

@jimrwalsh Thank you! Could not get the bill to load
@RichardMeyerDC makes sense! have you or anyone else done an analysis of how that compares to electrification?
@RichardMeyerDC or is the main advantage that it makes carbon capture easier for things like home heating (because you can just do CCS at the hydrogen plant itself)?
@RichardMeyerDC does blending in hydrogen decrease emissions if the hydrogen is being made from natural gas in the first place?
Hmmm, I guess a lot's changed in two years. It looks to me like in 2017 wind power RECs were by far the biggest source of compliance RECs for DC's program. https://t.co/yKcq3fH26u https://t.co/IJM2ryq253

@b_fung hmm. i can't load the bill so i can't tell if the solar-specific target has increased.
Interesting. DC hardly generates any electricity in the city, so it buys up RECs from power plants elsewhere to meet its renewable targets.

@basil1025 i am absolutely *not* saying that climate change won't have devastating effects — it's something i've written a lot about over the years. but it sounds like my original tweets were unclear on that point.
@elliot_padgett @jswatz yeah, agree with all that
@basil1025 what would i say differently?
Though that's definitely *not* an argument that every upward tick in temperature will be a smooth, linear change. It won't be. Just that there's never going to be a moment where it makes sense to say "welp, we failed, we're fucked, time to give up."
@6point626 yeah, those are fair points. as i said upthread, that third objection is the one that i'm most persuaded by.
Yep: “Climate change is not pass-fail. There is a real continuum of futures, a continuum of possibilities.” https://t.co/AJmJAp5OrO very nice piece by @jswatz
Yep. In foreseeable future, I'd guess the only practical differences of a 100% CES over a RPS would be 1) more incentive to keep existing nukes open 2) maybe tech like Net Power or NuScale gets a small boost. But wind/solar grow massively in either case. https://t.co/uIj1D4Y0kg
@alannogee agree and suspect that's what we'll see in california. but if the end result of a CES + a lot more RD&amp;D is that it's mostly just a big fat RPS in practice, doesn't seem like a bad outcome to me.
@alannogee yep. and maybe something like net power or nuscale gets a boost under a nationwide clean energy standard (versus a nationwide RPS) in the next two decades. but otherwise that seems exactly right.
@drvox yeah, i think my third objection is the one that bugs me the most (and fits in with the deployment point). and might be hard to overcome, which would might mean in practice that a zero-carbon standard doesn't look much different from a big fat RPS
or: a tech-neutral standard sounds fine in theory, but in practice there are million different obstacles to technology deployment so at some level policymakers have to be more active in picking winners and losers
or another objection: we're unlikely ever to see a perfectly comprehensive tech-neutral policy, we'll always have to make do with kludges, so we've *gotta* focus our bets and [pick your favorite techs] seems best right now.
i guess one objection might be: we only have limited funds/time, so can't afford to waste $ on dead-end technologies. (though the odds we'll guess right on what's a dead end seem not great?)
agree. i'm still not sure what's wrong with:	1. set a 100% zero-carbon power standard	2. accelerate R&amp;D on a wide array of zero-CO2 tech, 'cuz who knows the future	3. if we end up 100% renewable because that wins despite naysayers—great! if it's some other mix—great!	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ https://t.co/fXpVp44RsT

@Arnesenanton that's a good point. there seems to be a tension between the "hey gov'ts need to do much more to get below 2C" and "hey gov'ts need to invest much more in oil capacity to avoid price spikes in the 2020s"

@LetsFishSmarter thank you!
@LetsFishSmarter oh totally. talking with the twin rivers district (which monitors data pretty closely and found big fuel/maintenance savings) it doesn't seem like we're there yet. but certainly coming — and likely to come before ebuses hit price parity
@LetsFishSmarter yes, total cost of ownership would likely go below diesel before price parity. though you still need to be able to finance the upfront investment to enjoy those savings over time. for a lot of school districts, that's not easy. (for large private bus operators, more possible.)
@beerbarren absolutely, though where it gets tricky is that propane buses (for e.g.) also cut tailpipe emissions dramatically compared to older buses (if not quite as much as electric) but are also about one-third the cost. which is where the debate about how to spend limited $ comes in.
Which means, until battery prices fall much further, there may be some tradeoffs between near-term air pollution cuts and investing in a tech that will ultimately be crucial for getting to zero emissions. States are pondering how to strike that balance: https://t.co/dAWz9g16pV
The health debate is also notable. There are great reasons to retire old diesel buses and limit kids' exposure to harmful exhaust.		Yet some states argue they can still get far more bang for buck by upgrading to cleaner diesel/propane than going electric… https://t.co/tToXpiMVNa https://t.co/SuXb6oSdCS
A downside of electric school buses is that—unlike transit buses—they don't run very often, so it takes longer to pay back the higher upfront investment.		But on the flipside, school buses just sit around in midday/summer—so their batteries *might* be more useful to the grid.
And there's an intriguing experiment in White Plains, NY: The local utility, ConEd, subsidized the purchase of 5 new electric school buses in exchange for using their batteries in the summer to power the grid. Still early—but maybe a model for the future? https://t.co/dAWz9g16pV

@seanholeary1 it is impossible to tell from that chart how much of the pink wedge is due to energy efficiency.

@elliot_padgett like you said, in that situation, you're probably better off just burning fossil fuels for jets and capturing CO2 directly to offset? (but question is which would be easier to finance.)
@elliot_padgett So seems like tech like this only makes good climate sense if you had a 100% clean energy system, no good alternatives for jet fuel, and were capturing CO2 from the air to recycle into liquid fuel?		If so, I guess the question is whether this helps advance that tech at all or not
@elliot_padgett that does make sense in an ideal world. (with the caveat that in the short term it may be easier to finance recycling, since there's a revenue stream, than pure sequestration.) will have to read that bellona report.
@elliot_padgett but what if you are capturing from a steel mill, as here?
@elliot_padgett (that said, i don't feel strongly about this and am open to the idea that it's unworkable/unscalable/whatever. i'm just not sure the energy penalty is a fatal flaw. there's value in converting energy to more useful/portable forms.)
@elliot_padgett depends. if you used clean energy for the recycling process you'd get less CO2 emitted overall. there is an energy penalty, but the problem is it's tough to power planes directly with clean energy at the moment.

A huge challenge laid out by the IPCC: If we want to stay below 2°C, we may need to set aside *lots* of farmland for forests and bioenergy crops (for CO2 removal).

@kaleekreider ha, i read that part before it came out and mentioned it in this piece! just figured it was worth highlighting again: https://t.co/1FOn6XBcXo
There's still uncertainty as to *when* those ice sheets will destabilize and how quickly sea levels will rise as a result. But we're basically mucking around with forces that could continually reshape coastlines for the next tens of thousands of years: https://t.co/TdiFB78yrO https://t.co/xZsFjzUwhv
One of the more striking bits of the IPCC report. Even warming of 1.5°C or 2°C runs the risk of destabilizing large portions of the Greenland/Antarctic ice sheets... potentially locking in multiple meters of sea level rise for future generations: https://t.co/wKvwGkPbkS https://t.co/edEP6gHQAy

@gabriel_weil That's a good point, yes, you would.
@andrewsalzberg hm. that is a weird way of presenting it in the study then. presumably if TNCs didn't exist the number of VMTs from TNCs would be... zero.
@spookyoverlord that bit of text highlighted in blue in my tweet is called a hyperlink. if you click it, you get a new web page that provides more information. it is here: https://t.co/pys9T8K1m8		hope that helps.
@MichaelEMann @guardian okay, that's fair. if twitter had an edit function i'd amend to say 20% can be tied to SLR!
(And yes, I realize that the initial storm surge was only a small part of the damage that Florence caused.)
@MichaelEMann don't disagree at all. the statement was specifically about the storm surge damage.
Anyway, this isn't exactly breaking news. Hurricanes are getting more expensive both because of climate change but also because we're building a lot more stuff in vulnerable areas. But this bit of research was a nice way of illustrating that. https://t.co/pys9T8K1m8 /3
But this isn't *just* a climate story. It's also a coastal development story.		If, conversely, sea-levels had kept rising but housing development along the Carolina coast had been frozen at 1970 levels, only 23,000 homes would've faced flooding from Florence's surge. /2
The storm surge from Hurricane Florence flooded about 51,000 homes.		About 20% of that damage can be tied to global warming — if sea levels had stayed at 1970 levels, 11,000 homes would've been spared from the surge, per this First Street research: https://t.co/pys9T8K1m8 /1
@KateAronoff not a perfect analogy at all, but sorta what california did with the ARB
@twjpdx23 @mateosfo no i'm saying what you said earlier is correct. 83.5% more VMT than if TNC didn't exist
@twjpdx23 @mateosfo yep, that's right: "we estimate that ride-hailing leads to approximately 83.5% more VMT than would have been driven had ride-hailing not existed."
@hoffsbeefs agree. am curious how much we'll actually learn from this CA programs
@hoffsbeefs fine with me.
California has started giving grants to farmers to sequester more CO2 in their soils. In theory, there's a fair bit of potential here for mitigating climate change, though it's still unclear how much can be done in practice: https://t.co/q4FLCOgtms https://t.co/RNlNqXGwnw

@shiftourpower well, hard to find cleaner options. but cheaper? absolutely.
Here's the key section. Georgia Power agreed to take on a greater share of the cost of any future overruns, and it has the option to buy out the other partners if there are more than $2.1 billion in additional cost overruns. (Or it can cancel the project.) https://t.co/qlhqJ7qjss https://t.co/fzjZ64xQns
Here are details of the agreement from Southern Company: https://t.co/qlhqJ7qjss
@MikeGrunwald right, that's why "will there be more cost overruns" is not the biggest question!
@ADowling34 would imagine the DOE threat weighed heavily on georgia power/oglethorpe too
Estimated cost of these reactors is already at around $27 billion. Biggest question is what happens if there are *more* cost overruns. Who pays? Do the owners still agree to move forward? SEC filings will be posted later today. https://t.co/pgZlXX2g6p https://t.co/r4dKAEqO1e

This is true across lots of tradable sectors. There are huge variations in the carbon intensity of different industries, depending on where around the world they're located. https://t.co/WCGc0TIYBs /end https://t.co/ChPpzrfXE8
Was also interested to learn that the building industry is starting to focus on using low-carbon materials. Something to keep an eye on. Not all concrete, for instance, is equal — strikingly large variations in CO2 footprints: https://t.co/jqV8bGB03H /7 https://t.co/lFpwHEjLwg
Unclear if these "buy clean" policies will catch on, but if they did, they could conceivably help clean up sectors like steel and cement, which together are about 10% of global emissions. (They're tough to decarbonize entirely, but there's plenty of room for improvement.) https://t.co/2ZT6UGBoK9
No easy answer as to who should bear responsibility for these outsourced emissions. But a few places — California and the Netherlands — are now experimenting with standards to reduce the carbon footprint of the materials they use (and import): https://t.co/jqV8bGB03H /5
Meanwhile, it does appear that the outsourcing of CO2 from wealthy to developing countries is now slowing — possibly that phase of globalization has run its course? The big recent trend is developing countries outsourcing to each other: https://t.co/Jqp5UnCI0x /4
Also, this obviously doesn't mean that *all* progress on cutting CO2 emissions has been illusory. Electricity and vehicle emissions (mostly) don't migrate overseas, so any clean-up efforts there tend to be real and lasting. /3
One point that didn't make it in the story: There's not great evidence that climate policies themselves are driving factories overseas (i.e., "strong carbon leakage"). This appears to be driven by shifts in the global economy — "weak carbon leakage." But still significant! /2
Wealthy countries have "outsourced" a big chunk of their carbon footprint overseas — masking how much progress they've made on climate. An updated look at the global trade in CO2 emissions: https://t.co/jqV8bGB03H /1 https://t.co/RGb7GQnVWI

@cohan_ds @noahqk @GavinBade we talked about this before, but could a future EPA do something like requiring coal boilers to repower with natural gas as the BACT? (Obama's EPA did examine this and found it would have high costs—though also large pollution benefits:  https://t.co/6fYUFACkWq)

@mike_niven oh totally agree! though i do wonder if this ratchets up the pressure for DOE action
@taykuy or ratcheting up the pressure for a DOE bailout?
As best I can gather, if this CPP replacement *does* help coal plants stay open, it'll be those that aren't facing immediate financial pressure to close (in regulated markets, say) but will face reinvest-or-shut-down decisions down the road. Still not clear how many, though.
FWIW, the coal folks at ACCCE estimate that ~10% of the remaining coal fleet will close between 2018-2020 and told me they don't expect this EPA proposal to change that near-term picture much. Would need market interventions/bailouts to save those plants. https://t.co/GRHUQQsBFc
It would be really surprising if Trump's CPP replacement helped any coal plants that were facing *near-term* pressures to close. It's going to be years before any rule is finalized, survives legal challenge, state plans drawn up, etc. Too much uncertainty. https://t.co/cR2WNJVwIr

@PJCavan @chrisnelder @azevin yeah, and i know there was a recent NRDC/ICF study that disputed that. either way, can't imagine the economics of palo verde improve if they could no longer sell to CA (which iirc is around a quarter of the plant's output?)
@chrisnelder @azevin @PJCavan potentially relevant to how long palo verde continues to operate, no?
The bill requires utilities to get to 60% renewables by 2030, then is tech-agnostic on the rest (as long as it's zero-carbon).

@KevinSLeahy @MichaelWWara the CPP also would've given a bit of extra incentive to keep the VC Summer project going, though not at all sure that would've been decisive...
@noahqk @ADowling34 @timothyjwyant @JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff yeah, i think given that the CPP's original targets are nearly being matched by the market, a nationwide carbon trading program would have pretty low prices. (unless, of course, the EPA came back and ratcheted the cap down further.)
@KevinSLeahy @noahqk @timothyjwyant @JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff that could be right, although a cap-and-trade system would've only prevented 3 GW of retirements?
@timothyjwyant @sskutnik @JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff no, it was a question of baselines. new nuclear would clearly count for compliance in the CPP (as would new renewables). but maintaining existing clean energy sources would not.
@timothyjwyant @sskutnik @JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff I vaguely recall that that was done for legal reasons more than for policy reasons (the Clean Air Act is a pretty blunt instrument) but I have forgotten so many of the details of this.

@drajem @JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff not quite the right comparison to use: nukes run closer to capacity than most other plants. 		for generation, that is the loss of ~144 thousand GWh of carbon-free electricity by 2030, or about twice as much as produced by all solar panels in the US today.
@sskutnik @JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff this table comes from the newest EPA analysis for the replacement rule, so it looks like they've updated the at-risk numbers. (but of course they could change in the future.)
@timothyjwyant @JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff yes, if states adopted rate-based targets (less of a concern if they went mass-based). i wrote about this years ago — also i forgot this piece mentioned it might give incentives for about 2 or 3 GW of uprating: https://t.co/mZiaSAOUHX
@JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff Though I don't know why they think the Clean Power Plan would boost nuclear capacity slightly — it didn't really provide any incentives to keep existing plants open. Uprates, probably?
@JesseJenkins @JasonBordoff EPA projects that, without any climate regulations, nuclear capacity would decline from 100 GW today to 84 GW in 2030. 		With the Clean Power Plan, they project 87 GW.		With this new replacement rule, they project even less — 82-83GW, probably because coal takes market share. https://t.co/wGkaNAcBnV

Jesus. This has like three more plot twists than I was expecting (I was expecting at most two). https://t.co/dISnh1WydK
@evidentialdread for sure, though generation vs capacity is a five-face-palm fire
Of course, it's possible EPA is overstating how helpful this rule will be for coal plants. Lots of variables here. But that's what the analysis says.
My earlier tweet, which I'm deleting, confused capacity and generation. (Yes, I'm terribly embarrassed.) Trump's rule would reduce coal *capacity* compared with doing nothing but increase coal generation as plants run more.
Sigh. I was wrong in an earlier tweet because I looked at the wrong table.		EPA estimates that Trump's replacement rule *would* increase US coal generation by about 1-4% by 2035, compared with doing nothing. Extra coal comes at expense of gas and nuclear. https://t.co/yBFJBAGSSc https://t.co/Og01lq1JEx
I've seen this comparison a lot and it's not correct, fwiw. EPA projects that electricity emissions will be:		35% below 2005 levels in 2030 with the Clean Power Plan.	33% below 2005 levels with Trump's rule.	32% below 2005 levels if we do nothing		p. 3-14: https://t.co/yBFJBAGSSc https://t.co/51ws9sH5sI
That said, even small differences in the amount of coal power can have huge implications for human health — the difference between the Clean Power Plan and Trump's replacement is about 470 to 1,400 premature deaths in 2030. Coal pollution is nasty stuff: https://t.co/AyvVfOzIF0
Which is just another way of saying the Obama-era Clean Power Plan was pretty weak in retrospect, and has been nearly outpaced by existing market trends.		It's also another way of saying that Trump's replacement rule won't save coal, at least per EPA's analysis.

@hamandcheese that's what they say they're aiming for, sure, but that doesn't mean it will actually happen. for e.g., china and brazil are currently pushing to use existing CDM credits which would very likely mean few real reductions at all.
@hamandcheese that second part is not really true. there is an offsetting scheme for CO2 emissions that's currently under discussion. depending on the details (which are still being hashed out), it could have minimal impact.

@JustinHGillis @jgkoomey @noahqk oh gotcha. that's totally fair. it's at least plausible that people would react (somewhat) more drastically to policies that they viewed as permanent and expected to increase than price fluctuations. but still just that, a hypothesis.
@jgkoomey @JustinHGillis @noahqk well, to each his own. but the possibility that a $50/ton tax would cut gasoline use by 8-9% in 5 years (rather than the 1-3% = models tend to assume) seems mildly dramatic to me. but obviously no one policy is going to solve everything.
@JustinHGillis @noahqk noah's making the argument that we shouldn't do a swap, though.
@neilgundel @noahqk good time for a "it works in practice, but does it work in theory?" joke. (in fairness, he does offer a hypothesis two paragraphs down...) https://t.co/B2McvCD3pj
Many energy models assume that a carbon tax would have a minimal effect on driver behavior. But @noahqk offers some reasons to think that might be wrong — and that a carbon tax could have a bigger impact on vehicle emissions than thought: https://t.co/l7cGO1dLL9 https://t.co/OVT55MV43e

Yes, this is a good summary of this paper — I thought that's what I was saying but maybe not clearly enough: https://t.co/AU2cj12txX
Ultimately, there's only a finite amount of land on Earth available for some combination of food, bioenergy, and forests. We still don't have a clear sense of what the optimal mix of uses is for reducing emissions. This study is a step in that direction, but it's… complicated. https://t.co/aq4vzZqQK8
@JustinHGillis a fantastic piece. i think what's new here is that they try to weigh possible BECCS uses against forestry. and in certain cases, it seems, BECCS is not the way to go.
A reminder that most scenarios for staying under 2°C or 1.5°C envision *lots and lots* of carbon removal even though the tech to do so doesn't exist at scale and we still don't all the ins and outs very well. It's a huge blind spot: https://t.co/ChdtAJ3Yd0
What's the best way to take CO2 out of the atmosphere? The IPCC has suggested using bioenergy with CCS to build "negative emission" power plants. But this new paper argues that forests could be more effective in some cases, given limited land availability: https://t.co/S5ZIMFUbto

@jneeley78 in what way? CO2 concentrations would presumably be the same in both the geoengineering and no geoengineering scenarios.

@samori8 Fair point that there are much more cost-effective policies than CAFE, but I don't quite understand the framing here. We are more likely to get those policies if CA drops its opposition to this rollback? That seems unlikely?
Relatedly, I took a look at ways that cities can cool themselves down and prepare for heat waves, from the high-tech (phase-change materials) to the low-tech (plant more trees). But nothing packs the same punch as limiting future warming: https://t.co/cHraRhgaLl

@GernotWagner i feel like it's more true for some studies than others, but that could easily be journalistic bias!
@slcboston story of my life
@jtemple totally agree (though this doesn't seem like the last word on the food question anyway)
(fwiw, I'm undecided on solar geoengineering myself. We've committed the planet to so much global warming at this point that it seems crazy not to at least consider it in conjunction with emissions cuts. But there are still soooo many questions. /end)
Obviously there are exceptions. @carbonbrief always does a fantastic job of coverage and I'm sure I've missed other good stories: https://t.co/EAJnf6F0W6 /8
Anyway, @GernotWagner has the most accurate headline for this study, though sadly it's not very sexy: "Important new research points to importance of more research." Some of the other headlines have been bad or outright misleading, like so: https://t.co/pAI8kKoxAC /7
What's more, the paper doesn't look at how solar geoengineering might affect things like drought frequency — it's possible there could be additional benefits for crops there. Or maybe additional risks! Can't say for sure. /6
That said, this paper isn't the last word on the crop question. It relies on data from past volcanic eruptions, which are not a perfect analogue for most geoengineering ideas. See this thread for other critiques: https://t.co/EyA9SkFPfe /5
Now, this clearly isn't an argument *against* using solar geoengineering to mitigate global warming. Geoengineering might still have other benefits elsewhere (say, reducing heat waves or protecting glaciers). Or risks! The *only* contention here is that it's neutral for crops. /4
Why? If we put aerosol particles into the atmosphere to reflect more sunlight into space, that could slow the rise in global temperatures — good for crops. But it could also lead to less sunlight hitting Earth — bad for crops. Those two effects, the study says, balance out. /3 https://t.co/6aA2iTZtwm
The basic argument of the paper is that future global warming is expected to be bad for crop yields worldwide and those harms might be difficult to minimize through solar geoengineering alone. /2
This new Nature paper on solar geoengineering and crop yields is quite interesting, although some of the coverage of it has not been great: https://t.co/bg1pcDDPRV /1

Very important scientific questions about the Hulk: https://t.co/bvf5YxX6yj https://t.co/OHUUfSMq59
@Guay_JG @Revkin right. it's not like the only two possible alternative histories were "china stays poor" or "china burns exactly as much coal as it actually did and not one ton less." not hard to imagine more nuanced possibilities in between that would've had a meaningful impact.
@Revkin like i said explicitly in the thread, no, i don't think anything could've stopped china from going on a major fossil-fuel-powered growth spurt i also don't think the precise CO2 trajectory china went on was set in stone, and small shifts downward would've made a big difference.
This chart illustrates the broader point vividly. The longer we delay in cutting emissions, the harder it gets to stabilize the climate (no matter what temperature target you choose). That was true in the 1980s — and it's still very much true today. 		/end https://t.co/E8VK9iYvAK
So sure, we probably couldn't have "solved" climate change in the 1980s — it was a different problem then the ozone layer and tech availability has to be factored in. But even if we had moderately shifted our CO2 trajectory, the problem would be that much less daunting today. /12
But even here, technology matters. Say the US had invested in clean tech R&amp;D during that span, and as a result, China had been able to harness coal tech that was 15% more efficient. That would've made a huge difference, in terms of how big a carbon budget we have left today. /11
But wait! What about China? That was a big omission in the NYT Mag piece, and like @revkin, I doubt that any Western climate agreement signed in the 1980s would've stopped China from going on a coal-fueled growth binge in the 1990s/2000s. https://t.co/cIfgbMSO7u /10
Note that at a fundamental level, the basic technology for solar photovoltaic panels hasn't changed *that* drastically since the 1980s. We almost certainly could've started deploying at scale much earlier. /9
Meanwhile, it's true that solar and wind weren't quite ready for primetime in the 1980s. But how much faster might clean tech have advanced and spread if we started a crash R&amp;D/investment/deployment program earlier? Some great discussion here: https://t.co/iKo4JlhalB /8
Then there's energy efficiency. In the 1970s, California started aggressively tightening building codes and other standards. The state's per capita electricity use fell way below the rest of the country. Another "what might've been." https://t.co/hGqIiCWHmh /7
Also: imagine if we'd spent the last 30 years building city/transit systems with an eye toward reducing driving miles. Those infrastructure decisions have a massive long-term impact on emissions — and they're extremely hard to reverse once made. /6
If standards had instead kept rising over those three decades, fuel economy of new cars would've increased ~60%, and the task of decarbonizing transportation (the #1 source of US emissions) today would be much easier. https://t.co/K7AUwVora6 /5
Transportation was the most obvious example. We let CAFE standards stagnate from 1980 to 2010. As @KnittelMIT has shown, automakers kept improving engine technology during that time, but used it to build bigger, more powerful vehicles instead of improving fuel economy.  /4 https://t.co/UxKSbEwJQr
But what if the US *had* made a major climate policy push in the 1980s? There was still a lot we could've done at the time to push down emissions and make the task of decarbonization today much easier. /3
I agree with @russellgold that you have to consider tech availability. In the 1980s, we had substitutes that let us phase out CFCs and heal the ozone layer. But fossil fuels/climate change was always going to be a harder lift. Fewer clean energy options at the time. /2

@evidentialdread @JustinHGillis @russellgold @NathanielRich @NYTmag yeah, i think you can argue both "there was no montreal protocol-type comprehensive solution available for climate in 1989" but also "maybe taking a 30-year breather from CAFE wasn't, in retrospect, the smartest course"
@JustinHGillis @russellgold @NathanielRich @NYTmag oh absolutely. the argument that we could've solved climate in 1989 is flimsy (neglects tech picture and neglects china/india/other developing countries). but i do think we could've made things considerably easier on ourselves. we weren't totally helpless.
@JustinHGillis @russellgold @NathanielRich @NYTmag and transportation would probably look very different today if fuel economy standards had been rising from 1990-2010 instead of flatlining and/or highway funding/development patterns had taken climate into account.
@JustinHGillis @russellgold @NathanielRich @NYTmag suspect that the biggest effect of pricing or other stronger public policy starting in 1989 might've been lower energy use/higher efficiency compared with our actual trajectory. which still might've made the task of decarbonizing in 2018 easier than otherwise.
@noahqk @russellgold @NYTmag that would be a fascinating counterfactual to read.

@samori8 oh that's interesting. i guess they'd also have to calculate the odds that the ZEV might come back in 4 years or so.

@RogerPielkeJr in fairness, CFCs were a huge chunk of global greenhouse gas emissions back then, no? IPCC estimated that the reduction from 1980s to 2000 after Montreal Protocol was roughly equal to about 10% of global fossil emissions: https://t.co/1utNLQJRKV

@nongnonghead in fairness, i wouldn't bet the farm on that startup either

@RogerPielkeJr interesting and makes sense— if global GDP growth outpaces emissions growth the cost obviously shrinks as % by 2100. (though this is all assuming there is enough storage.)
@MarkPalko1 sigh, me too.
@AshLadBlog agreed on all counts
I guess you *would* save some CO2 by cutting the tree. 		Roughly: A 6kw rooftop solar system in NY that displaces gas probably saves, what, 2-3 tons/CO2 per year? 		While a tree absorbs ~50 pounds of CO2 per year, and releases ~1 ton after it dies?		Still a dick move, though.

@_KenStokes oh that could be true! i'm just clarifying what the specific study referenced in the highlighted passage found...
Update: I'd misread that initial post. Looks like it's more like 35-38% of Uber/Lyft miles driven in NYC are without a passenger, which would be more in line with California. (It's 50% of the *growth* in miles since 2013): https://t.co/AKKD55owcH
@Bruce_Schaller @mslaurabliss ah, that makes sense!
Just roughly: At these prices, to offset *all* of humanity's CO2 emissions in 2017 would cost between $4 trillion and $9 trillion — about 5-10% of global GDP. Now do that every year. (Assuming you had enough space to bury the CO2 underground.)
@Halfpasttuna that is certainly easier and cheaper, though we might need to end up doing both
Er, for those who think this tech is going to stop climate change singlehandedly, note that this is still *way* more expensive than a ton of other more boring ways to cut emissions. Could definitely prove useful as part of a broader strategy though.
@mattyglesias eh, probably no need to worry about that. it'd be incredibly expensive — and possibly technically infeasible — to get rid of *all* extra CO2 this way. could help at the margins though.
New paper suggests that the costs of capturing CO2 directly from the air are coming way down: "They are coming within striking distance of making this interesting economically." https://t.co/4xvNMoRZQ7
@mtaylor_nz https://t.co/y8bWtYwcAV

Best piece I’ve seen yet on China’s sudden pullback of support for solar. Could mean way less Chinese solar (~20 GW) gets installed in 2018, with ripple effects around the world: https://t.co/KGaMVHov4m
But bottom line: they're basically arguing that it's cheaper to add a bunch of new wind+solar+storage+gas than it is to keep its existing coal-fired plants running. A sign that we've hit a real inflection point for clean energy.
To be more precise, here are the two paths Xcel could take. The one on the left keeps the two coal plants open through 2033/2035. The one on the right closes them in 2023/2025, replaces them with additional solar/wind/gas/storage, and saves money. https://t.co/vVlMnKJThQ
@samboykin there seem to be some points in favor
(Deleted earlier tweet to clarify that this is only a proposal by Xcel — still under review by PUC.)
Wow. Colorado clean energy proposal would retire 660 MW of coal by 2025 and replace it with 1,131 MW of wind, 707 MW of solar, 275 MW of battery storage, and 383 MW of existing gas.		All while reducing emissions 59% below 2005 levels and *saving* customers $213 million. Not bad. https://t.co/rpSPPt4VW2
@TechHerbal At least the California study I mentioned in a follow-up tweet only looks at drivers when they are on and working (i.e., when they have their app on and are between fares).
@shanedphillips oh yeah, on that i don't have a strong view (mostly just don't know enough). though the idea that they may be cutting into transit/walking/bikeshare does seem significant.
@shanedphillips oh that's fair! i saw this mentioned on twitter somewhere earlier today which is why i went googling but hadn't realized it was a whole thing
@MatKautz was a different report than the original article—but yeah, it does seem like there are some significant uncertainties involved
@shanedphillips why is that the implication from this report? that seems like a leap
@MatKautz yeah, that was one of the big caveats mentioned here https://t.co/0ojWonp1uK

@ElephantEating i am hoping to take a look at that later this week, though if anyone has that data offhand that'd make life easier!
@drajem technically it suggests either!
@brendanpierpont @ctraywick @RichardMeyerDC would coal plants run at any price in that case?
@gilbeaq was thinking carbon pricing but now we're talking!
@gilbeaq i was thinking even more neoliberal
@ctraywick oh, hm. would assume that is the case when PJM does reliability must run orders, right?
@gilbeaq hmmm, that might be right. welp, too bad there is no way to preserve competitive electricity markets while reducing emissions and avoiding the loss of zero-carbon generation.
(This is all separate, granted, from the arguments that this whole plan seems legally dicey and would distort competitive electricity markets and appears to be an action in search of a policy rationale.)
Interesting. If ailing coal/nuclear plants just get extra capacity payments, the nuclear plants would run more, coal plants likely wouldn't —&gt; emissions maybe go down.

@leahstokes @duncan__c i think the theory is that EOR could help capture technology scale up in the short term but eventually to get CO2 to zero we'll need incentives/regs requiring permanent sequestration.
Anyway, China's coal use is still below 2013 levels. Though if we want to stop this whole climate change business, it needs to drop much faster than it's currently doing.
@duncan__c absolutely you need to figure out storage. but one big challenge to CCUS in the power sector is that the "capture" part is expensive and requires extra energy to perform. this tech claims to at least eliminate that concern. we'll see.
I keep reading that China's debt-fueled stimulus programs are unsustainable, that they're just creating overcapacity in steel/cement that no one needs. And yet... they keep doing it.

@kdrum right, but that can only happen if people are getting richer as a result of increased density. (which seems like a good thing.) no?
Looks like this is a significantly more expensive way to make steel, but the gap could shrink if carbon prices under Europe's cap-and-trade system rise: https://t.co/er4yqYsffo https://t.co/pAZxCCMUqd
@kdrum that could be. but if that's true, a person moving from suburbs/rural area to a city should see the decrease in driving emissions without the offsetting increase in consumption emissions.
This looks promising: Sweden is building a pilot plant to manufacture emissions-free steel using hydrogen and renewable power. (Steelmaking accounts for ~5% of global emissions.) https://t.co/er4yqYsffo
Hmm. @kdrum says that boosting urban density doesn't really make people that much richer but *also* isn't that great for the environment because city dwellers are wealthier and consume more. Surely both can't be true, right? https://t.co/4rL3JBUWde

@jdeely @gilbeaq @kidcongo @croselund @johnrhanger @mateosfo @chrisnelder @RichardMeyerDC definitely doesn't make sense for PG&amp;E to keep it open under current market/policy rules. though the CEO has said he would've kept DC open if the RPS had been redefined to include nuclear (and that that would've been the lower cost route) https://t.co/8phERGVn2j
@croselund @kidcongo @jdeely @johnrhanger @mateosfo @chrisnelder @RichardMeyerDC for sure. though still a question is how long the bottom of that curve extends
@JohnSemmelhack yeah, that's definitely more descriptive!
@kidcongo @croselund @jdeely @johnrhanger @mateosfo @chrisnelder @RichardMeyerDC i was also speaking generally. but on san onofre, of course it could have been fixed/extended instead of shut down — the question was at what cost. (and obviously that cost didn't make sense for SCE at the time.)
@jdeely @kidcongo @johnrhanger @mateosfo @chrisnelder @RichardMeyerDC though replacing nuclear generation with equal wind/solar/hydro just means we're running in place on CO2.		seems like the right counterfactual is what generation would have looked like if nuclear had stayed and wind+solar had grown at the same rate to displace fossil generation.

One thing that's clear, this is a *lot* of new rooftop solar being mandated here: https://t.co/U1kwSTvvMV
5) Other pros of rooftop solar: Reduce conflicts over solar siting in the desert, especially in fragile ecosystems.		Other cons: California housing costs are already extremely high and even a modest increase certainly adds to the pressure there.
4) In some places, rooftop solar could be more valuable than utility-scale solar if there are transmission constraints, though it seems better to sort this out through market mechanisms than flat regulations: https://t.co/2O60VmmRoj
3) That report might well overstate the costs though — @solarmj points out that installing solar upfront is much cheaper than installing solar retroactively. (Though there's still the question of what the optimal amount of rooftop solar is.) https://t.co/Sn6vWwCfca

@Adam_S_James are there good analyses of what drives electricity price changes in different states?

@JigarShahDC @mattlichtash @gilbeaq yeah, to be clear, i 100% think the funding of such projects (assuming they can be verified, etc.) is an important step. i'm just less convinced that carbon neutrality is the right way to frame this (and maybe even harmful).
@i8dc @MilesGrant @kdrum @ArlingtonVA @ggwash ohhh, i gotcha. those are really great points!
@gabriel_weil those are both really good points
@karlbykarlsmith yeah, that could be— if you assume that these offsets were the only way these projects were going to get funded over the next X years.
@ADowling34 yeah, that's a pithier way of putting it

@benserrurier i dunno. they are still meaningfully adding to the total amount of renewable energy. that seems different?
@blkahn to be clear, i started thinking about this while reading your story!
I guess what I'm saying in emoji form is...		Lyft: "We are going to spend some money on outside projects to curb emissions. But every gas-powered car ride still contributes to climate change." 👍		Lyft: "All our car trips are now carbon neutral." 🚫
@Guay_JG @janvmaz @CarbonWrangler yeah, to be clear, i can absolutely see the value of the funding here. it just seems weird/maybe wrong to say "because we're spending this money, X activity that emits CO2 is now carbon neutral"
@samboykin oh you can absolutely make the case for the value of funding. it just seems wrong to say "because we've spent this money, X polluting activity is now carbon neutral."
I mean, it can still be worthwhile to fund those projects (like afforestation). It just doesn't seem like "offset" is the right way to think about it.
Question: Don't carbon offsets just fund projects that will almost certainly need to happen anyway if we want to get to net zero emissions? Which means they aren't really "neutral" from a carbon budget perspective?

@DanBiancoNYC @kdrum my question is which would be worse for traffic in that urban area: greenlighting more development nearby or increasing surburban inflows (assuming that failing to do #1 leads to #2)?

Also many thanks to @apbandiv for walking us through this all (and updating the data for us). ICCT's recent report on international car standards is really insightful: https://t.co/lTlTr7tSdn
Also note that Canada has harmonized their auto standards with the US, and Mexico/Saudi Arabia have basically modeled their rules on ours with a few year's lag. So any weakening in the US could have ripple effects in other countries.
One note: Europe's standards are technically more stringent than America's, but their cars are also smaller. It would require more technology for us to get our bigger cars up to EU standards that quickly. Which is all to say that our current rules are pretty ambitious.

@bedwardstiek depends on leakage rates (and also what time scales you care about). 		in the US, most recent work i've seen suggests that gas is very likely lower impact than existing coal: https://t.co/IWJlpoGul1 		but i'd worry a lot more about leakage rates in russia
@hausfath sure. nothing about this excludes a push on renewables, nor should it
It's a good reminder that carbon taxes are tools — not magic wands. Under the right circumstances (like in the UK, where there was a ready substitute for coal), they can lead to drastic changes very quickly. But that's not always the case — it depends.
Also notes that you'd want to target carbon pricing in areas where coal-to-gas switching is readily feasible. In places like Poland or Japan that lack energy infrastructure, the carbon tax obviously wouldn't have the same effect.
Of course, nothing's ever THAT simple. In Germany, for instance, a switch from coal to gas would increase dependence on energy imports (from Russia), which they may not want to do. Plus there's methane leakage to consider.
Basically they find that the world could cut CO2 emissions by about 3% just by using existing gas infrastructure + an appropriate carbon price to displace coal. No new plants would need to be built.

Much more in this smart thread from @ElephantEating on the limitations of that UCS map above — figuring out the incremental emissions from an EV turns out to be a lot more complicated: https://t.co/JcGEj25lcz
@pdiff1 i mean these hydroelectric plants already exist. so presumably using them to charge EVs would not change the negative impacts of the dams. or would they?
@pdiff1 fair, though i wonder: would electric cars affect existing hydro's impacts one way or the other?
@GarthHeutel not sure i fully understand this paper at first glance but will read through!
@B9lyEquivocal @gabriel_weil this analysis does — it uses Argonne's life-cycle model. but the point about average vs marginal emissions is a good one.
@0Sundance yes, that's what UCSUSA used — argonne's life-cycle model: https://t.co/xpJ8wJmRU1
Also a good point here — it'd be great to figure out the incremental emissions from each new EV added to the grid: https://t.co/BWkPBxx7R7
As several people pointed out, there's a key caveat here: These maps show crude averages, but it can matter a lot *what time of day* you charge your EV. 		Would really love to know if anyone's done that analysis, though I imagine it can get a bit complicated.
@gabriel_weil looks like average, but that's a good point!
Whoa. Check out the green-ass grids in British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec. Electric cars there are *incredibly* low-emitting. Thanks @JoeHomsy: https://t.co/TvYlgJOrL6 https://t.co/LLbqS45XZf
Does anyone know if there are similar maps for China or other countries?
And note that as the grid gets cleaner over time, electric vehicles do too, as @bslotterback shows here: https://t.co/if9586SgVJ
In the US, electric vehicles are typically greener than conventional vehicles *even if* they're powered by a grid that still uses fossil fuels.		Nice map here showing the mpg equivalent for the average EV plugged into different grid regions: https://t.co/GrfVbkOZLw https://t.co/ogWTEJBN7E
Also worth noting that the U.S. nuclear power agreement with Egypt comes up for renewable in 2021, and with Turkey in 2023. Curious how much the precedent set in any Saudi deal would matter here.
(The argument that SA could just build solar panels instead of reactors is pretty thin, but it's a good overview of the politics otherwise.)
Saudi Arabia wants foreign help building nuclear reactors for electricity — but without strict nonproliferation conditions attached (i.e., no uranium enrichment). Will the Trump admin go along? 		Overview here by @ZeeshanAleem: https://t.co/9zxMfuwhz8

If this actually worked — and they discuss all sorts of potential obstacles — might allow removal of 0.5 to 4 billion tons of CO2 from the air per year by 2100. (For context, humanity emitted about 41 billion tons in 2017.) https://t.co/39yaZrH57c

@drvox these 11-dimensional nested twitter threads are bewildering and yes I partly blame myself
@drvox Not even sure who or what you’re arguing against but no.
@mateosfo @CostaSamaras oh i agree that it's underappreciated. and probably the collective wishcasting about staying below 2°C contributes.
@Oliver_Geden sadly, that sounds right. and while you've done incredible work on the ways that countries (and scientists!) have managed to fudge the 2°C target, i suspect we'll all be equally creative in finding ways to fudge the net zero target.
@Oliver_Geden that essay was great, but i'd love to better understand how this might work in practice. it seems like as long as you use both metrics it'd end up looking a lot like the situation now.
@TedNordhaus @ForeignAffairs i know, i read it, it was good! am still ambivalent about the whole thing, hence the additional tweets.
@ericgrote yeah, it seems like most people just play it safe and use "pass," but surely there's gotta be something better here!
5. Anyway, I don't know the answer here, but I was staring at a blank word doc trying to write and figure out whether container ships "sail" through canals or some other verb and figured I'd tweet instead.
4. You could argue that having such a yardstick is pointless and doesn't actually spur countries to decarbonize any faster. Maybe! But I could also imagine that having no yardstick leads to a lack of focus, to aimless policy drift.
3. The 2°C goal at least provides a useful yardstick, however arbitrary, a way to show that current efforts to cut emissions are moving much too slowly and to help us think about the consequences of such slowness.
2. Because what do you replace it with? Vague calls to decarbonize "as quickly as possible"? How quickly? By when? Getting to zero emissions in 2200 is *wildly, massively* different from getting to zero in 2100, as far as climate change as concerned.

Not really. US is a net exporter of natural gas/coal, but still a net importer of crude oil. Overall, we still import more energy than we export.

@SolarInMASS @Ed_Crooks sure, insofar as those chinese companies will lose some business to their overseas ventures, it will hurt china. but again, the losses are tiny compared to the global market.
@bdylan234 about 95% of our panels are imported. china's a small fraction of that — our imports shifted to other countries like malaysia, south korea, vietnam, thailand after the 2014 tariffs.
@Ed_Crooks yeah, that's what i was referring to — last data i saw was that about 8% of US panel imports came from china last year. malaysia was about 36%, korea 21%, etc.
@realNinjan am writing about this now! seems like the consensus is it will slow but not kill. but, again, when we're so far from where we need to be... even a little slowdown is not great
Not sure Trump's solar tariffs are a big blow to China. It'll shrink US installations by ~8 GW total over next four years, of which China supplies ~8% of panels. 		Meanwhile, China installed *52GW* domestically in 2017 alone. US market is a blip for China. https://t.co/2f8V77aOYN
What's frustrating is that this often gets framed as a pissing match between wind/solar and other solutions. It shouldn't. But it does seem like recent (impressive!) trends in clean energy can breed a certain complacency about the scale of the climate challenge.
Basically agree with this by @portereduardo. What's happening with wind, solar, EVs, and even the Paris talks is encouraging. But the gap between where the world is now and what needs to happen to keep global warming close to 2°C is still *staggering*: https://t.co/am3gvQqp5P

@GernotWagner @noahqk but what if non-C&amp;T policies continue to drive emissions below the cap ceiling (as i think they've been doing so far)? then it gets more complicated, no?
@noahqk i honestly don't have a good sense for how that plays into it. in theory you're right. in practice, idk.
@arvindpawan1 @jdeely @benpaulos @jgkoomey oh definitely agree that under current policy it'd be crazy for PG&amp;E to keep DC open. question is whether it'd make sense to modify those policies.
@arvindpawan1 though curious what you make of the counterfactual question. could that additional clean energy have been used to displace gas instead? (realize it's not that simple since gas/nuclear have different characteristics/economics, etc)
@timothyjwyant @GavinBade well, there is the intermittency argument (that gas complements wind/solar better), though i'm still not totally convinced that's insurmountable (with different policies, e.g.)
Also remember there are two questions here:	1) Will Diablo Canyon be replaced with zero-carbon power or no? 	2) What's the counterfactual? Could CA have found a way to keep DC open and push emissions down even further than it otherwise will? (Say, by squeezing out gas instead.)
Hmm, on p. 21 the CPUC says that it intends to avoid any increase in GHG emissions from the closure. But will depend on how the integrated resource planning shakes out: https://t.co/9dlyzXm2An via @GavinBade
@GavinBade Am I reading this right? It just says that PG&amp;E should submit scenarios that don't really raise emissions, not that it necessarily has to adopt those.
To be clear, I definitely get the case against letting this plant close. But am genuinely curious what shutdown proponents think about the terms of the deal being altered — specifically the part about replacement power
@julie_kelly2 i don't think anyone does right now? it will be part of the utility's future integrated resource plans. enviros had hoped for a firm deal to focus on efficiency/renewables, but that got thrown out. so... possibly some gas? i'm honestly not sure.

@cohan_ds @mammuthus worden et al address precisely that in the new paper ("Recent publications have also shown...") although I can't really judge the argument https://t.co/TJ1uezMBT8
@vt2tamu of course. the question here is why have methane concentrations spiked since 2006 after staying flat the decade before that
@mammuthus ha, yeah. at this point there seems to be agreement that both agriculture and fossil fuels are behind the rise, and now just debating exact fractions
Some background in this earlier piece below. Seems this new study was able to resolve discrepancies by properly accounting for wildfires. https://t.co/NLMjnEHqPv

@past_is_future it is not a substitute for reducing GHGs as far as possible. big question is whether it could be a useful complement.
Also, no one likes to talk about it, but this is one case for considering solar geoengineering on top of sharp emissions cuts.
Which means that coastal communities need to think about adaptation no matter what.
Cutting emissions will slow the pace of sea-level rise and avoid huge increases down the road, but the biggest differences come post-2050.

Rep. Olson: What are you trying to accomplish with this FERC rule? Perry: "For us to have this conversation as we're doing" on resilience.
For that matter, he seems pretty lukewarm in defending his FERC proposal. Keeps calling it a conversation starter on reliability.
Not the first time he's done this. Perry never seems super interested in defending Trump's DOE budget cuts to Congress.

@ADowling34 at least according to that RHG analysis, texas is not. georgia probably isn't, but *could* under favorable assumptions for gas/solar/nuclear
Without the Clean Power Plan — and without additional measures that Trump certainly won't be proposing — that's further out of reach. /end
Even before Trump, the US would've been hard-pressed to meet its Paris goals — cutting overall GHGs 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. /14
There's also the bigger climate context. The US is nowhere near on track to cut emissions deeply enough to avoid drastic global warming. /13
The CPP also would've acted as a backstop if market conditions became more favorable to coal. (Hello, Rick Perry's new FERC proposal.) /12 https://t.co/ugyMkXPsFq
That said, the original CPP did push some states to start thinking about climate anyway—like Arkansas: https://t.co/6XwY9edSfD /11 https://t.co/ydiNazNKqL
And the CPP would have forced every state utility regulator to start thinking about climate change, which is no small thing. /10
The solar industry expected the CPP would've opened new markets for renewables beyond strongholds like CA: https://t.co/YneDJoQCvg /9
(It also depends on whether states would've set up carbon trading systems under the CPP. See here: https://t.co/zN2YQAtRti) /8
The precise effect here depends on assumptions about how cheap natural gas prices stay and how fast renewables expand. /7
California is going to cut emissions with or without the CPP. But the rule would have pushed states like TX, WV, GA, PA, to go further. /6
The real action was in the state targets. If the CPP had been enacted, up to 21 states would've needed to cut *more* than they're doing. /5 https://t.co/SUM5qYxZ36
But that *doesn't* mean the CPP was meaningless. That original 32% goal was a forecast, not a hard target. Many get this wrong. /4
That's basically because market forces and state-level policies are pushing utilities away from coal and toward gas/renewables. /3
Even without the CPP, power emissions are on pace to fall ~32% by 2030 anyway—the plan's initial goal. Striking! https://t.co/zN2YQAtRti /2 https://t.co/WFN1Sg8yuD

@cohan_ds @narayansub @arvindpawan1 @rhodium_group that was just a projection. if the CPP had been implemented we'd almost certainly see deeper cuts than current trajectory
@cohan_ds @narayansub @arvindpawan1 @rhodium_group the CPP did not set a national target.
@robbieorvis @arvindpawan1 again, i really think it depends on the state.
@DavidKonisky @arvindpawan1 exactly. for some states it would've driven fairly significant changes. that's why there was a lot of opposition!
@arvindpawan1 (certainly CPP could've been stronger. i just think it's wrong to say it would've had no impact.)
@arvindpawan1 if CPP had been implemented, power emissions almost certainly would've fallen more than 32% below 2005 levels
@arvindpawan1 that graph is a little misleading. compares current emissions to what was initially projected for CPP, not what CPP required.
@arvindpawan1 that's not quite right. it would have made a big difference in some states (like ND or WV), less so others (like NY or CA)

Well then it'd be awfully irksome for wealthy climate advocates not to share the pain. You'll have to fly less, but they won't have to, etc.

@hamandcheese vox has been transparent about it! https://t.co/QANvudYS7L
@hamandcheese just eternal glory (or shame, as the case may be!)
@hamandcheese nah, i wrote that back in december — they just re-upped it for today's news
@alannogee haha, that exactly covers the gamut of emotions
useful advice for journalists who enjoy banging their heads against their desks repeatedly in despair: write about electricity markets!

@granlund_aarne yes

@Silvio_Marcacci yes, that's one reason why i think it's too pessimistic
@richardcaperton oh that's a great point

@colinmeehan hmmm, so sounds like it's not obviously a better approach and not enough reason for other RTOs to rethink their own capacity markets etc
@colinmeehan yeah. i'm a little curious if any other RTOs have looked at texas and said, hmm, that seems to be working well, maybe we should emulate
Q: Why don't other grid operators set up "energy-only" wholesale markets the way Texas does? What's the downside? It seems much simpler.
