@Fisterh @SethAbramson It is the people that are pushing the Globalist agenda.
@3kindsBlue @hoppingpony @Fisterh @SethAbramson Agreed that is absolutely correct
@hoppingpony @Sweetling @SethAbramson It‚Äôs not whataboutism it is what is actually happening
@hoppingpony @3kindsBlue @Fisterh @SethAbramson It‚Äôs not a far right term. The idea goes all the way back to Nimrod. The Globalists actually want to finish what Nimrod started
@3kindsBlue A conspiracy simply means two or more people planning something malevolent or illegal in secret. The world is nothing but conspiracies.

@Sweetling @SethAbramson Mueller will be one of the indictments unless he has made a deal to save himself. You are going to be pissed at Seth and the MSM for lying to you.
@Sweetling @SethAbramson Oh it‚Äôs going to bring indictments but not of who you think.
@Cassiopia27 @steven_metz @SethAbramson What is happening is an updated version of the Soviet plan to destroy the West. And they are doing it from the inside
@Cassiopia27 @steven_metz @SethAbramson It is the basis of the NeoMarxist Postmodern ideology that they are pushing. Deconstruction and Critical Theory.

@KathyMerry2 @SethAbramson So there were good people on both sides.
@joyvabeach @SethAbramson Are there any other variables other than race that could have made him come to that conclusion?
@KathyMerry2 @SethAbramson Was there only Nazis on the right side? Was there only Antifa on the Left side. See if he was just talking about Nazis then by defintion he was just talking about Antifa
@SethAbramson He never called NeoNazis fine people. See the difference is you are lying about Trump and the accustations against Northam are demonstrably true.
