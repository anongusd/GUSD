Last tweet on this for today: #SelfCare is more than ordering take out and watching Netflix. It’s actively engaging with your self-development &amp; habits so you can stay on top of new challenges. That means looking for teachings to learn &amp; practices to do, throughout your lifetime.
So at the ashram, we’d say Om instead of Hello.	Or Om Namah Sivaya.	Or Om with the person’s spiritual name. Om Anandi (my name). Because it’s all OM so it’s not like you’re really saying Hello. Maybe you’re just passing by; saying Om is like “H/T whole universe, all of creation!”
So at first you’ll just be saying	OM OM OM Does this work?	Then maybe	OM OM OM i am so angry. Over time you’ll say	OM OM OM why did I forget this?	Or	OM OM OM hey it’s gonna be okay... and		Eventually you’ll just be like 	“HaHaHa OM OM OM Peace Peace Peace 🙏🏻”	...To everything 😂
Here’s a #selfcare trick:	Try using a mantra, prayer or affirmation to re-direct your mind in challenging moments. Essentially you surrender your mind to the mantra, prayer or affirmation—until it overrides the negative thoughts. Eventually, the meaning will import automatically.
AUM represents the primordial sound, returning to the absolute source of creation. It represents all the levels of our consciousness - sleep, dreaming, unconscious and conscious awareness. It’s also called Pranava - energy. AUM is the union of self &amp; God.	 https://t.co/GLcjbgk4hw

However, I do unequivocally endorse Senator Sanders due to putting four years into the political revolution he inspired.	It goes without saying that Berniecrats will support the nominee. Stop with the BS pushback. We are all adults here. The quicker you all get that, the better..
I don’t care who you support for President. I am a big supporter of Cory Booker, since I helped on Hurricane Sandy. The problem as I see it is Democrats who refuse to believe facts, based on what they want. It’s about the wide swath of America, not your little bubble o’viewpoint.
Prime example. Now, multiply it by all the progressives elected nationwide in 2016, 2017, and 2018 - who openly ran as Democratic Socialists. I believe Bernie is going to crush the primary. Folks should think twice about the dirty things they are putting out there. It’s not cool. https://t.co/BXt8wjCPDu
There’s a lot of adamant posts by Dems who don’t support Bernie. Fortunately, we have nothing to justify or defend as Berniecrats. We *already* have a nationwide system of organizers working through multiple channels that have increased ranks since 2016. I am not worried one bit.

The executive class - the people who run universities and make $100-$200+K while professors make $50K. I really have a problem with that system. We live in a very selfish and greedy capitalistic world. Turn your back for one second and people will cross you. Don’t ever forget it.
Personally I would rather be dirt poor or filthy rich. The upper middle class stinks of BS. That is just my personal opinion. I find a lot of solidarity with the poor and working class, and get some help from the wealthy. I think we should flatten all salaries to $40-$50K. IMHO.
Sometimes it’s just better to deal with the truly rich.	The middle class (typical retirees/mainstream Dems) are obsessed with protecting what little they have. They demand free labor, act bougie, and look down at activists. I’m not a fan of or trying to get into the middle class.

Text of the Green New Deal. It sounds a lot like the “Old Green Deal” that many unsung folks have been organizing around since the 1960s. We owe it to the naturalists and hippies for keeping the dream alive. We call this Transition, aka: The Great Turning. https://t.co/SYD0hPuYcD

If you are not in a constant practice of working on yourself, you are a detriment to whatever you are involved in. That’s the opposite of what Paolo Freire called “conscientization.” It’s a deep engagement with literacy, the word, logos.	Like how Rastafarians use the word. Depth.
What you know will help you “do” better but if you are always doing and never studying, you aren’t conscious. That’s why feminism is called “consciousness raising.”	I think reading/engaging/ journaling about whole texts is a critical part of that process. Not only social media.
That’s why we have entire huge philosophical movements after Marx, and the idea of socialism: the subject of power is vast.	Take a few years to read up on Continental philosophy,	post-structuralism, deconstruction,	cultural studies, hermeneutics, postcolonialism &amp; postmodernism.
Marx is useless without Hegel. The dialectic is always operational. Like Gandhi’s “satyagraha” -wielded in conjunction with the “constructive programme” -they are inseparable. Power simply dictates that we are in a constant state of democratization.	Practice that... ☝️#PhDTalk

I think if Democrats want to lead in rural areas then they need to commit to long-term service there. It takes decades to gain respect, and you get that by working on the ground &amp; proving yourself. Democrats need to manifest something for people in rural areas, not talk about it.
Rural Democrats can win —when they are dynamic people who connect with voters. Our problem is that it’s a big hill to climb, so we often get the lackluster candidates who have nothing to lose, or really to offer. Left candidates who win are dynamic and involved in community.
Rural organizing = isolated people, cumbersome land-based issues, generational poverty, outdated and extreme mentalities.	It’s rough.
I came up extremely anti-establishment with 20 years in the Green Party. Obama turned me into a Democrat.	I realized I could help my community by working with established people. Punching left is no longer my strategy, especially working in a rural area. I now leave it to others.
Good Luck to @CoryBooker. Phenomenal dedication, real experience, massive ideals. Huge fan. There’s some campaign finance issues with him, but this problem has been endemic in our system, and he is not alone in that regard. He’s proven he can rise above. Thanks for stepping up!

The INF Treaty eliminated all nuclear and conventional missiles, as well as their launchers, with ranges of 500–1,000 kilometers (310–620 mi) (short-range) and 1,000–5,500 km (620–3,420 mi) (intermediate-range). By May 1991 2,692 missiles were eliminated, followed by inspections.
Important:	The USA plans to pull out of the INF treaty this weekend.	The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (Agreement on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles) is a 1987 arms control agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The United States will stop complying with a landmark nuclear pact with Russia, as soon as this weekend, after last-ditch talks with Moscow to save it fell flat, a senior U.S. arms control official said on Thursday. https://t.co/wEEW0pz2Dn

That was a huge lesson for me and I have talked with MANY people about it. I explained this actual situation to a group of maybe 6-8 people on Jan 12th this month. And what I learned from it. Because I am mature and I care and I’m evolving. And I’m a leader, and people trust me.
Oh come on. That’s not true. Name one. I never saw you - never even met you. I worked with hundreds of activists in this region, and I still do. Because it’s what I do.

I’m not a politician or a political candidate. I’m a teacher and a community leader. I’m an organizer. My work speaks for itself. I admit my mistakes and apologize for them, and work to find solutions to prevent them in the future. That’s leadership. That’s what real leaders do.
I never made anyone’s life hell. That was a reaction to people attacking me constantly for how OTHER PEOPLE scored. Because they were pissy about their candidate LOSING. Not in my control. Our primaries are open. Get a candidate who can win and people will elect them. It’s magic.
I did say some things but I never did do that, obviously. 99% of the things that I said were AWESOME and VERY NICE. Ask the majority of people in the region I actually help. I never worked with you, and you don’t know me. Your insistence on berating me is aggressive and shameful. https://t.co/Ma07VTQASv
It’s a state party rule, not local, &amp; applies to members of DCCs, clubs who are “bound” to their DCC’s endorsement (by their bylaws or their DCC bylaws), and DSCC (State Party) Delegates.

@HoferFan @stephtruckee It's really good. i never knew any of this existed!! until i was a bernie person and somebody told me to run. crazy hidden elections....
@HoferFan Is LisaLFlys a delegate? Lisa Larkin? That's the only one i see. Some are twitter handles, so I don't know the person's name. Their profile is anonymous. If they are a delegate, they need to use their name, not a Twitter pseudonym. We need transparency.
@stephtruckee Well I think we need a better process like - not forcing people to drive such a long distance, maybe electronic voting?? OR - open up all day long, like the regular polls. If e-voting is insecure, we could expand the hours at least. More people are voting now, thankfully!
I don't know what E-Delegates are. We have 14 elected delegates in each CA Assembly District	The superdelegate reform was at the national level at the DNC. They did not eliminate superdelegates. They did remove their ability to vote on the first ballot for presidential candidates https://t.co/AjF8sWu00V
@HoferFan same!
You are referring to endorsement, not delegate elections (ADEM). Endorsement votes are public because delegates are elected. All votes are read out loud. 	(This is governed by state election code, not our bylaws). 	All Democratic party members can vote in ADEMs = a secret ballot. https://t.co/Rt1jyPnRn2
@HoferFan There's no reason. It's just how it is done / archaic tradition. I believe we need a group to analyze the process and propose a complete overhaul. That was started actually, but the reforms got broken up and a few made it through and others did not. Long and tedious process
@HoferFan I believe we should expand voting hours to a full day. More people will be able to vote. We only have it open for 2 hours and it causes so much chaos. I work the regular polls and we have 13 hours for a much smaller group of voters. ADEM covers an entire Assembly district.
@HoferFan Having to drive too far to vote. Regular elections only cover one precinct and you can vote in your neighborhood. For these, folks have to travel a large distance (almost 2-3 hours in some cases). Need to figure out a total reform by a delegate supergroup.
Every delegate should choose 2-3 things to work on. You will get pulled in many directions by policy and candidates. Choose a focus. e.g. I tabled my progressive interests and went into the Rural Caucus. I hope to continue serving there b/c that's the community I want to focus on
There are a ton of problems with the ADEM process. We need help to fix many things in the CDP bylaws and Rules Committee. We wanted to reform it when we came on board as Berniecrats, but were confronted with a lot of priorities that were emergencies. Turnout is up. Help us fix!

Change is hard and I want you to aggressively work through this. It’s what I’m doing LOL. I want you to get in the ring and wrestle. Do one thing. Then switch to mental mode and THINK. You need to be creative. Draw it out. Keep a notebook with you. Times require us to rise higher
Doing more isn’t going to get you brownie points with the universe or your followers! Focus on what is right in front of you, knowing that it’s a one big mess. Yes it is. Now pull out a sheet of paper and vomit. Write how you feel.... until that transforms into a strategy.♥️🙏🏻♥️
We’re moving form historical to historic. Next few days are going to be over the top... eat your Wheaties.

It’s beyond the pale.... it’s about to get very wild out here. Look, it’s *been* wild. But when you take paychecks away from a million people ~overnight~ and just because - that’s going to put a squeeze on The Economy very fast. It won’t affect RU but 45 will find out quickly..😎 https://t.co/ivMYydmriS

No offense to Hon @narendramodi but as a matter of fact: BJP has taken on a bad reputation in the U.S. amongst The Left. Hindu nationalism is unpopular here, have tied Tulsi Gabbard to it and will reject her over this. Folks not updated on major reforms BJP has brought to people.

Yoga means equanimity. You are stable/open. You don’t imagine other people’s motives. Engage with reality. Stop generalizing/ categorizing. It means take in absolutely everything equally. Don’t overreact. Be an old British professor about it: “Ah yes fascinating. Tell me more...”
You do you and I’ll do me and it will be awesome. No disrespect but I know what works for me. I’m around people all the time and my alone time is sacred. I was taught to do my practice at home before I go out or before I teach. We also don’t do the yoga when we teach.	Just saying
It’s great if YOU like your yoga class. I LOVE chanting w/200 people but I don’t want to be in a room w/other people when I meditate stretch and do daily practice. It’s been that way for a few years. I don’t want somebody talking while I’m going through my process. It’s annoying.

Going to a “yoga class” is like scrolling through Instagram or Facebook.	Yoga means: withdraw from the world, and find your own truth. You cut everything, you renounce cushy things, dwell in truth, be neutral and easy in everything. Yoga is 24-7, not a class. It’s a way of life.

@PGE4Me has caused incredible upset here in the foothills. 24 hours without power, for one hour of wind. People have no idea what’s going on, and no leadership words from anyone on this. Absolute fail. What about special needs people? I’m hearing about this all day long in Amador
@scottlay @joshua_harder @KatieHill4CA Jessica Morse just announced that her campaign raised $1.3 Million this quarter. Tom McClintock raised only $360,000. She out-raised him for the 5th time, by a more than 3 to 1 margin. This is very bad news for Tom.
Yikes. Nail meet coffin: Jessica Morse just announced that her campaign raised $1.3 Million this quarter. Tom McClintock raised only $360,000. She out-raised him for the 5th time, by a more than 3 to 1 margin. This is very bad news for Tom.
Folks are saying the wind blew through in about an hour to 90 minutes. Then it was done. Power is still out 24 hours later. Honestly, rather difficult to believe. I am lucky I have power and two towns over / no power. And for what? People are really baffled at PG&amp;E right now!
@soundslikepuget Good to know! Thank u
Freezers full of meat, animals butchered after the fair, people paid hundreds or thousands of dollars for whole animals. PG&amp;E needs a better system. This had really caused some hardship.

@catherineburr @GavinNewsom KQED
John Cox (R governor candidate on the radio with @GavinNewsom right now) doesn’t know anything about CA law. Reporter repeatedly asks “like what?” Or “how would you do that” he says I don’t really know or - he’ll tell you later. Gubernatorial candidate! It’s all Govt corruption..
He belittled her repeatedly and she slug him right back!
Tom McClintock repeatedly referred to her as “Jessica” — zero respect from these guys.
What’s actually tragic is when McClintock uses bursitis as the example for Pre-existing conditions that insurance writers want to eliminate from health plans. Who doesn’t cover bursitis?!!  It makes absolutely no sense.
Hard to believe McClintock is criticizing El Dorado ID! They are a model for forest development (where I took my tour). Unbelievable! Someone needs to fact check his claim that EID will go in debt $11 million because they “can’t sell excess timber.” LOL the project cost $11mill.
“Having worked on the federal budget first-hand....” @Morse4America sounds so reasonable compared to McClintock, speaking of wise investments, safer community, growing the economy. He is really out of control. #CA04
McClintock doesn’t want us to have ANY grants. She reference repeatedly everything that he has voted against and he starts talking about the deficit. And claims she wants to spend spend. He doesn’t want us to have any funding for ANYTHING.
McClintock says average family will save $1900 because of tax bill. Morse replies that is only if you make over $200K and most families make about $30,000. She says “We need a tax bill for real families in or district.” McClintock doubles down that @USCBO 	is wrong.
“We’ll get you a sense of humor when we send ya home.” Morse with a swat back. She’s not taking his mansplaining lying down.
He goes off on theoretical sidetracks. So he mansplains (two times) what slander, libel and perjury are — without talking about victims, women, sexual harassment or anything. He doesn’t care.
Tom McClintock is so rude. He’s completely mansplaining the reporter.

CA GOP - $22k to Poythress. His ads on country radio in Merced (folks w:Latino accents say he advocates for equality) couldn’t be more disingenuous.

@xManuel209x Not, but I wouldn’t nor would she call herself one ☝️ just isn’t her platform or a term she’d self-identify with. She is more the non/bipartisan, problem solver type. She was a field director for HRC Campaign in Colorado. Etc
TM trying to paint Jessica Morse as a democratic socialist in closing comments 😵
TM repeatedly attacked The Democrats but Jess was quite serious about bipartisanship. The difference could not be more stark. You can hear a pin drop when she speaks.

According to the CDC, 4,654 Californians died from opioid overdoses in 2016.		In 2015, doctors wrote more than 24 million opioid prescriptions for Californians. Sacramento County had the highest number of prescriptions at 1.2 million.
In 2017, the suit reads, Amador County ranked third statewide in emergency room visits due to opioid overdoses, and that doesn't include heroin.		In 2016 an estimated 5.7 percent of the population aged 12 and up in Amador County misused opioids – and 1% had an opioid use disorder

Seeds are kept at 2 degrees F. Some of them can survive for 25-30 years at this temperature. https://t.co/7FhUWidDxc
Native grass seeds to be used for erosion control. Trying to add the grasses too with tree planting so there’s more Native grasses that grow and less shrubs (which attract bigger fires). https://t.co/f4wpsyHrKh
A lot from one seed zone would be all the same species with like a 500 foot elevation differential. Then they process those all together and determine their specs.
Pine cones ripen quickly. You have about 7-10 day windo to get them. They processed over 2,000 bushels last year (like a Home Depot bucket full). You can get 1,000 seeds per pound. This facility was built in the 60s. Everything is old here. Good grief we need to invest in forests
Seed extractory. We need a big seed bank. So they collect cones off of the trees and run them through this. https://t.co/1Zlj7Z1ZAr
Nobody speculatively grows anymore. So this partnership is critical. All these trees are sold when there is a post-fire demand. This group works with NRCS foresters and 28 local RCDs (out of 150?) to educate on this issue. RCDs work with local groups to organize&amp;truck trees there
Tree nursery for El Dorado National Forest (157 acres). A regional entity works with RCD and forest service. Lots of talk about seeds here. This is federal but they work with private landowners in the state to reforest. Gave away 1 million+ trees over past three years (b/c fires) https://t.co/YCDZKq81fP

Local conservation districts have a really hard time to service grants that are reimbursable — the state needs ronfive the grants - make the money flow in an easier way would help a lot. Don’t have enough fund to front for the reimbursement.
The ARbs want a windy day (so smoke will move) but fire managers don’t want windy days to burn on 🤪
Local air boards need to work together with fire managers - “Fire is inevitable.” Ok so we’re gonna burn when the wind conditions are good. Which way do you want your fire? Air Boards (ARB) are fining the fire managers, so working on regulations. Usually - Get permits from ARB
Q on Prop 3 but the guy answering it obviously hasn’t studied Prop 3 🤨
We should be doing 30-50,000 acres projects, not 2-3,000.		We need a more open forest because the water stress is getting more extreme over the past 5 yrs		Private companies are very adept at finding the near-dead trees that can be commercially viable before they completely die.
You want the Goldilocks principle: if the trees are too small or too big, you lose snow.... we should create a kind of “groupy, gappy infrastructure.”
“You need to create variability out there. Topography influences water availability and what happens when fire hits. “Where you got water is where you have big trees.” Steeper slopes burn hotter and faster. We need: wetter, high density areas and have thinner places in dry areas.
There’s a really tight linkage between the structure of the forest and it’s functions. Really high heterogeneity is good — combination of structures and variability — helps us think about how to handle the situation. Check out these models: https://t.co/isHDWbxIOX
Fuels deduction vs. Wildlife Habitat vs. Drought resilience— conflicting  demands 😐
Conflict over speaciss mgmt. the spotted owl. They tend to be associated with dense forest conditions and high canopy. Thinning decreases their habitat.
We’ve had a binary response to the forest. Fight fires and try to thin out way out.” There are other ways! Other ways to put a dent that doesn’t just involve logging and fire suppression.
The forest service talks about it, but they’d have to increase treatment by 12-fold to achieve this amount. Right now, we are chasing the fires (seems like Lake County Fire at 100,000 acres is doing the job). We should do this ahead of time.
Pre-European times (they use fire rings to calculate past burns). Half a million acres used to burn each year. You want to be treating a half million acres a year on forest service land, if possible
The trees we are trying to hang onto because they are the backbone and infrastructure - we lose in the big fires.		In prehistoric times, when Natives managed the forest - we had 60 trees per acre. Now it’s 3-400 trees per acre. Those are all straws in the ground, pulling water.
Cost and size of fires is going up - $2.8 billion for 2017 (figures for federal agencies) https://t.co/MH8vCIcYNh
“Do nothing / hands off management is not an option.” #ForestHealth
The key word for this talk is restoration. We’ve altered and changed the “fire regime.” Most of those forests used to burn every 5 to 15 years historically. When you keep the fire out of the system, it gets more severe.
Now we’ll hear from an ecologist from UC Davis John Muir Institute (Malcolm North) — all talks were similar so will keep it short. I’m at a meeting on California #foresthealth today
Cal Fire, UC and Forest Service are working on new seeds and (we’ll visit the nursery later today to take a look).
Also due to climate change, what do you replant? Something more resilient? Try to mix it up? Plant a few genotypes.. the forest service is giving this a lot of thought and discussion.
“To the extent we can, both state and federal need to contribute to reforestation.” —Cal-Fire Rep
If left untreated or unreforested, it becomes high Chappell. The carbon sequestration potential becomes much lower. The private owner timber will reinvest. Private landowner - it’s a crap shoot
Q on replanting after fires, what’s happening? A: the forest service budget is set by federal Govt. The fire side has been boring for fire suppression and there’s no funding for prevention. The vegetation that comes in may be different
If we can leverage the private sector to be able to make a living from prescribed fire and prevention, that is the holy grail. Non-industrial privet lands are the “tough but to crack”- we’ve tried to incentivize them but it’s difficult.
The utilities: many people assume they are responsible even if they do due diligence. We have about 55% of our forest is federally owned and ? %is private, non-industrial, they use it for recreation, often absentee. Industrial timber property is 20% and they have incentive
Goats - are getting a lot of laughs and attention today. Grazing etc
The less live vegetation left, the higher the severity of the fire. With the new fires, large chunks of land which are all high severity - something will grow back but it may not be a forest. 		Ground fire vs crown fire (crown is the high severity where it crawls up high)
People compare biomass energy to solar and wind. It can’t compare but if you compare it to open burning, then yes it’s competitive.
UtiliIng small materials is important because thinning is smaller trees. When we get serious about thinning, we need an infrastructure issue— are the sawmills there and can they utilize this material? Burning /burying this material is not good. 	Also, some biomass energy starting
Fuel reduction, thinking, prescribed fire, restoration, sustainable timber harvest.		Mass timber structure - glue small pieces of wood into panels that become building assembly for buildings. Uses wood. Replaces steel and cement. Growing interest in this. An alternative 2 burning

The forest health panel is taking questions from the Food and Ag board members now. Q on how fire affects health of the soils.
The forest and natural resources community knows what to do—if we don’t manage the forest, the climate will do it for us. The timing couldn’t be better. There’s more whining now, wish we would’ve done it earlier. But it’s happening and so let’s do it - take care of the forest.
Let’s not miss this chance we have to make a difference. We’re ready to go. The resource consecration district is the connection to the local community. You’ll see later today the good work they’ve done and how we can replicate that elsewhere. We need Ag at the table &amp; to partner
Permit streamlining is critical. We have folks from environmental community now at the table, asking: How dow we undo some of this structure we created? We have to work together.
We need people with skills to do this work. Equipment. Training. Tree mortality brought attention - amagnet for fellers, resources. We’ve been thinking more about workforce development and job training. Folks have left this field. How do we draw these people back in?
Policy alignment and funding are unprecedented right now. We need to do more active management and put fire out there. We have a strict air quality program in CA and we may have to accept that we will be putting smoke in the air in a managed way. Compete with Ag for burn days...
We are just entering a period where we are going to see more of this and that’s scary. Many of us have a little bit of a sore throat from the fires —that’s just the start of this.
Now comments from a forester. Local Ag comes together with the forest here. And the watershed. King Fire was right here. A very high severity fire. Sedimentation in the watershed is lost storage. &amp; debris - spent tens and hundreds of millions dealing with it.
There’s not enough funding though. We need to involve the private land owners. To break even and make a small profit. We need private initiatives - to work together. We won’t solve this quickly. It will take a decade or longer. Focus on large areas of forest land, we can do it.
The forest mgmt task force created by Gov Brown has a wide range of stakeholder groups. We have a real chance to make a difference. Got cap and trade funding recently. In the old days, $200K was big money. Now we are getting $200 million. I think we can make a difference
We have 40 Million people in the state. We don’t know what the future will hold. We need to create ecosystems that are robust and adaptable to as many different conditions as possible
Up til now with CEQA and NEPA, we focused on zero impact.	We need a paradigm change: to accept some negative impacts now such as smoke from prescribed fires. Cut down and remove about half of our trees in order to achieve longterm resiliency. That’s a lot of timber harvest though
Rim Fire came close to ruining the reservoir due to erosion etc. Fires also affect our watershed and water resource infrastructure.		Need:	Fuel reduction, land use planning
Fuel reduction - does create short-term Lower levels of carbon storage but safer and more resilient carbon storage. (ESP consider g how fires set us back vis a vis carbon)		Need better land use planning. People like to live in these areas. But need better more coordinated effort
“Overall we know how to solve the problem, we just need to allocate the resources.” -Cal-Fire on forest health		Fuels reduction - go in and mimic the role of nature either mechanically with equipment or with prescribed fire. Downed trees and some limping. Stop the fire ladder.
Starting in late 80s, forest management infrastructure starting deteriorating. There’s fewer lumber mills now - and transportation of wood becomes prohibitive.		One sawmill in CA south of Sonora- Terra Bella in Tulare
Warmer temps, dryer, longer summers. Protecting headwaters is important— it’s worth so much. There are ways to manage forest to protect water  - Roger Bailes (sp) at UC Merced has researched
As a net emitter of carbon, so it’s a vicious cycle
Between 5-10	Million acres need to be thinned to a fire resistant and resilient level. It’s the challenge facing us. Climate - carbon storage is an important part of the forest. Our largest terrestrial source of carbon storage. One bad fire season can put us over the edge (cont)
Forests are overly dense, overstocked in Ag terms. Stand density index. If you pack too many trees on one acre, you run out of resources - water, soil, light etc. you get spontaneous mortality. So many acres of forest in CA - 33 million acres. A large number
This year - we’ve lost 12 lives and last year it was only 4 lives. Due to fire. “When we start losing double digit numbers of Human lives, it’s clearly a crisis and not something we can co-exist with.”
100 years of active fire suppression started in early 1900s with formation of Forest Service. Accumulated fuels. We shut down Native American use of this land which added to this problem. Past forest management reduced species diversity and removed larger trees - not healthy
Cal Fire now: Fire protection is intertwined with forest care in Cal-Fire budget. We have some definitive problems after 5 years of drought and bark beetle - widespread tree mortality. Change of climate and weather is impacting our forests in a major way. Longer, hotter summers
CA Climate investment funds- Got $220 million last year. More this year, inc Prop 68. New Gov budget Cal-Fire crews for prevention, not suppression. Watershed management program. Prop 68 - lots of new funding for parks and to support wood products getting to market.
Innovate wood use and biomanagement. Urban forests-shading and cooling and carbon sequestration. Want to support. The way we do this is to - Work collaboratively across all forest types. Ways: Sierra Nev Conservancy, good neighbor authority agreements between state and federal,
Forest Carbon Plan goals:: increase pace and scale of improvements on non-federal forest lands. Double from 250K to 500K treatment - clearing and reforwatjng. Forest Service also looking to increase to 500K acres of treatment also. UAFA has 20 million acres here. Imp partner
129 million dead trees due to bark beetle. Concerned about health and resilience of our forest. Major policy reports PPIC has one last fall. LAO has one. Now Carbon Plan. Never seen more policy side understanding this much about forests (good)
5,600 Structures burned in Santa Rosa fire
Major fires this year have taken 8 lives and about 850,000 acres. In recent years, a number of new records. Rim fire was 260K.
The CA Forest Carbon Plan came out in May. Ties in with national plan. Many agencies involved. CA forests incredibly important—largest land-based carbon storage. Concern due to drought, fire, insects, and climate change — major concern right now.
At board meeting for CA Statewide Board of Food and Ag. Meeting reports were short and I did not understand a lot of the acronyms. A lot of focus on sustainable Ag, soils, broadband, etc. 	Now we’ll get some training from Forest Service, foresters, and Cal-Fire—on forest health.
Due to tariffs &amp; trade war: Ag Commodities will need to re-focus on other Asian markets besides China, as well as more domestic promotion.
Updates:Farm Bill was ready to go in conference committee, but apparently is not ready now.		Ag Board met Gov Brown last week. Losing markets overseas. Looking for mitigation and help.		Healthy soils: $5 mill for healthy soils inc in the budget, as well as some $ from parks bond.

It’s the height of white supremacy to say that “if our young people were more educated, the cops wouldn’t be shooting them dead on sight.” Yes - educate our people and develop our communities, but stop blaming them for this nonsense. Respect the sanctity of life. @Mayor_Steinberg
I beg to differ @Mayor_Steinberg,	To prevent tragedies, the police need to stop shooting. Stop shooting our brothers multiple times. Stop shooting them in the back.

@dadofthree @RepMcClintock @smokey_bear There was also something called The Economic Recession (caused by the banks bundling fake loans, skyrocketing real estate and unchecked lending, along with the Iraq War).

@dadofthree @RepMcClintock So you know the history of logging up here? And why the companies actually pulled out and the lumber mills shut down? Hint: Ot was because the companies said it was unaffordable—not the spotted owl or @smokey_bear.	&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;History matters.

@dadofthree Logging restrictions aren’t the problem. It’s funding. US Forest Service keeps taking funds (for clearing-thinning) for cash to fight the fires. We need to seal those funds for prevention. There’s a bipartisan bill, but @RepMcClintock has his own bill (that is dead in the water.)

Candidates that are unelected should have no more right of representation or influence than any other registered party member. The right to represent more than one person comes with being elected, not just mere candidacy. IMHO their advisement is out of order and a bit crass.
Congressional candidates don’t have a say in how CDP Executive Board members vote. The voting privilege is solely granted to those who are elected or appointed delegates. Candidates should immediately stand down on advising elected board members on how to vote on the U.S. Senate.

Terrible news 😢 what a fighter and progressive champion. I’m sure @CA_DaveJones will be up to something incredible very soon. https://t.co/w8RO4YjjYA
With 43% of precincts reporting, 6,300 R’s (7%)  voted for a Republican besides McClintock, who dropped to 51.4%. This is such great news so far... Morse is 7% ahead of Bateson right now. We *can* take this seat. Please up our rating in CA04!! @CA_Dem We did it	@dccc @cnn @msnbc https://t.co/FEYF6dnoPD

Our goal in CD4 was to get second place, whether that was by 1 vote or 1,000 votes. That’s what I’ve said all along and so every voter contact really mattered. It’s the Morse Force that pulled this off—lots of dedicated follow up &amp; relentless travel. Confident she pulls through!
Huge. Amazing news. This lovely smart creative dedicated servant leader has taken the lead for Merced County DA. Her experience is phenomenal and she’s an utter dear who cares and knows what she wants to reform. Pretty stoked on this -	@RealJusticePAC https://t.co/KcRjuYJMAr
@CarrilloA1 Wowow 😲😲
Why work the polls?	So that when bad stuff happens, we have people on the inside getting info, handling business and helping people VOTE! We will need vote chasers, poll watchers, election workers and more... in November. We need people at every level—to take back our country.
Today was pretty wild - our turnout was 30-60% higher than calculated. I will be at Elections at 8am for more info.	Some Amador County precincts have run out of ballots, voters say https://t.co/EUxEva5g1q		I did not run out, because I requested more ballots at 12 noon.
Just got down the hill. Thrilled to see McClintock &amp; Denham drop in % which bodes so well for November. Nothing but great news out of CD4&amp;10. So proud &amp; grateful for everyone’s hard work. &amp; Saddened by what’s happened in LA with voter purge. Congratulations, all. Round 1 &amp; Done.
Phone bank, lit drop, knock doors — we’ve reached over 50,000 voters in CD4 and it’ll be another long day. Every second is precious!
When I get happy and excited I start crying haha —wait 15 hours, Champ. On my way to the polls v psyched!!

6 weeks without coffee. Life goes on!! Keep moving, folks. Your addiction probably isn’t doing that much for you after all. Some of you are going to need to smash a few walls in the next ten days. Let go of whatever is holding you back, so you can fully align with your future.
Yes there is much to despair, but keep your eyes open for pockets of the movement. Open your heart. Don’t forget that the movement changes, as it moves through you—your heart &amp; mind—becoming that something you put your hands upon. And—	Always remember:	The Resistance is Strong.

The RU &amp; SY making the war don’t care about the refugees and it affected the entire world economy. This is a very big war with millions of refugees. Way above Trump’s paygrade. But, It must end ASAP by any means necessary. Look for the end to this one. It’s been a very long ride.
Protest the war when it starts, in the middle, and at the end. War is the big one: ongoing and always there. Good luck if you try to stop a war. Try to help the victims and refugees instead of just talking about how sad it is. Love and war - easy to start, impossible to stop. -AC
