@larkrieger7 @MissKlessing @GrannyT4Jesus @freedom_moates @Cowboy_Kn It is the people. But no one must think exactly the same way. The Jesus story is a beautiful one and people accept it as Gospel. But I think it’s just that, a story. I believe in power of the story. Does that make me not Christain? I think I am. I believe in the Golden Rule.

@GrannyT4Jesus @larkrieger7 @freedom_moates @Cowboy_Kn Shamed into? What does that mean? There ARE Christain Churches who believe abortion is not murder.
@Pameladfaulkner @MickeyFisher73 @freedom_moates It’s called a higher power and NO ONE knows for sure. Everyone can believe what they want and who are WE to judge? I believe in God (a higher power) but the story of Jesus i just don’t know. However, I have FAITH. That’s what it’s all about.
