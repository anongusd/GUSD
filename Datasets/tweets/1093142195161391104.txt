Blue Flip Flops	Blue Flip Flop is one of my favorite photos. It is not the best photo of her but it is still one of my favorites. She was very sad that day I was being a jerk and I am sorry. My photos are memories the good ones and even the bad ones. 		All rights reserved https://t.co/B3vtgkIkgR

What is worse somebody who hurt you for somebody who sits back and watch somebody hurt you
I think for the most part we all know wrong from right we all try and do right but sometimes we all will f****** when you f****** you own up to it

"Modest Mouse"	I'm the same as I was when I was 6 years old	And oh my God I feel so damn old	I don't really feel anything
"Modest Mouse"	Coyotes tiptoe in the snow after dark	At home with the ghosts in the national parks	Mankind's behavin' like some serial killers	Giant ol' monsters afraid of the sharks

I think carbon monoxide poisoning you just go to sleep and never wake up
I think about killing myself alot think about how where when will find me how long will it take before they find me
When's a good day to die my father died I'm my mom's birthday I wonder if it was her birthday wish
I often wonder does most people think about suicide as much as I do
I want to run away from all my problems the truth is I'm too poor to go anywhere
One day I fear I might kill myself
