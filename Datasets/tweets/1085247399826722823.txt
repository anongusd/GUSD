@WhiteHouse Would the wall really stem the flow of drugs if they mostly come through existing ports of entry?  Immigration at the southwestern border is down so what made it an emergency? https://t.co/03UXlKOMyp
@GOP @realDonaldTrump At the SOTU the President made it sound like things were improving at the border already so why is it a crisis?  The majority of new undocumented people are overstaying their visas, not crossing the southwestern border. https://t.co/ubEuSEYSNZ

@USATODAY As the article mentions, its not like Trump doesn't know that Democrats would move to pass a resolution saying there was no emergency.  Seems like it should be 'how a veto-proof number of Republicans' could block a national emergency.  Democrats couldn't do it on their own.

@mchap100 @senrobportman @POTUS I just hope this "border walls are just like walls at your house" analogy dies.  Who couldn't find a way over their neighbor's wall if they really wanted to?  Residential walls are mostly for privacy and keeping things (kids/dogs) in, its just not a good analogy in my opinion.
@senrobportman @POTUS Would he sign that compromise even if his base hates it though?  Seems like the biggest question, wouldn't be the first time he has changed his mind late in the process.
@ABC I kind of think it should be a bigger deal that he essentially said the economy will stop being good if he keeps being investigated.
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I think all Americans hope more true compromise can be had, rather than thinking compromise means the other side agreeing with your demands.
@CNNPolitics Is there any info about whether nominees themselves have been more partisan?  Could the slowly pace of confirmation be that some view the nominees as more extreme than in the past or is that just a partisan  cop out?

@priceclub01 @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Much of it does come from Mexico, no doubt, but it isn't smuggled across on foot.  Its huge quantities coming in so they use trucks, planes, boats, etc. that go around, over and through ports of entry.  That is a different solution than a wall. https://t.co/8eFuph3Vcj
@politico Right, import tariffs are a tax on the importer, in this case American companies importing things from China.  Tariffs might still accomplish what you want but its important to be honest about who they affect and how.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump Will there also be discussion about how trade has helped many American consumers or is this purely a protectionist speech?
@PattyMurray With as prominent as healthcare policy was in the 2016 campaign it really has taken a back seat aside from attempts to repeal and/or hinder Obamacare.  Would be nice if more serious conversations were had about how to protect everyone.  Hope you can help with that.

@UnbiasedFriend @mahoneypaul1 @ChrisMurphyCT @ArtAcevedo Fair enough, don't know that I agree with your conclusion (I would consider the NRA more pro-gun than many gun control groups out there) but thank you for your thoughts.
@pollreport Of course if those 31% are the only ones the President cares about it might seem like 100% support to him.  Sadly that seems to be the gauge for public approval these days, either "does my base love it?" or "does my opposition hate it?"
@UnbiasedFriend @mahoneypaul1 @ChrisMurphyCT @ArtAcevedo Is being in favor of any gun control the same as being anti-gun or is there more nuance than that?
@redinbluestate5 @ChrisMurphyCT @ArtAcevedo Well only like 1-2% of the population is in the NRA so the odds of one of them committing a particular type of crime compared to the odds of it being the other 98-99% are pretty low, yeah.
@UnbiasedFriend @mahoneypaul1 @ChrisMurphyCT @ArtAcevedo The NRA is anti-gun?

@Jim_Jordan Not like that amount can be transported on foot over the border.  The wall isn't going to help at ports of entry where this quantity of drugs come in.  At least be honest about how it would help. https://t.co/8eFuph3Vcj
@ABC Surely there is a political win to be had if he gets Democrats to agree to securing the border in other ways.  He could still say "the Dems tried to stop me but I'm found another way to stop drugs". Wall wouldn't even have the effects he says we need. https://t.co/8eFuph3Vcj
@jdawsey1 Do we have any reason to think he is drawing on a different set of facts when disagreeing with them or is this more of a gut-level disagreement?

@MarshaBlackburn For context since raw job numbers can be hard to interpret BLS data suggests that while employment rose from Dec 17 to 18 so did the workforce as a whole and the unemployment rate (3.3-3.6) https://t.co/BRJr5p6QuM

As Congress works to keep the gov open for more than 3 weeks hopefully both sides can recognize reality about immigration:  It's falling already at the SW border and most new people here illegally are overstaying visas. @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi https://t.co/eDTFcocOAC
@jrokstar19 @MMViverito The majority of new people here illegally are those that have overstayed their visas as opposed to crossing the border with Mexico.  If your goal is reducing the number of people here illegally the wall might not work as you hope. https://t.co/S9ad3gL1h3
@keith_moehring Its not racist to prevent immigration but its also important to recognize that immigration on the southern border is already declining and the majority of people here illegally are now coming from those overstaying their visas.  Policy should reflect that. https://t.co/S9ad3gL1h3
@JohnBoozman @USDOL For context it looks like from Dec 2017 to Dec 2018 the unemployment rate held pretty steady (3.7-3.6) but the size of the workforce in Arkansas actually shrunk as did the total number of jobs.  Probably matters how you slice the data. https://t.co/MlADXlJa4K
@DoctorPlato @Anthony_Russo97 @LindseyGrahamSC People like to make this point but does the comparison work?  Not that hard to hop a fence if you really wanted to, seems like most people want walls/fences for privacy and to keep things in (kids/dogs).  Surely there is a better argument to be made.

@HuntingRE @SenatorCarper "We" wouldn't have saved anything.  The government neither spent the $5.7B for the wall nor the $11B lost by the economy during the shutdown.  I'm not sure the lesson here is 'give in to anyone who threatens a shutdown', its 'shutdowns are really bad, don't start them'
@apbeaton @Austan_Goolsbee @POTUS There are certainly many industries/companies that like the tax cut and will be more profitable under it but at the same time any broader benefits may get overwhelmed by tariff wars and global economics.  Ppl should stop thinking you can boom the economy with the push of a button
@g00dneighbour @amyklobuchar We really need to get back to a place where shutting down the government doesn't seem like a reasonable/normal thing to do
@BLA94650398 @amyklobuchar Seems unlikely that a wall would do much to stop meth from coming in (drugs aren't really carried on foot over the border but through existing ports of entry or planes/boats/tunnels that a wall wouldn't affect) but you are right that some serious action is needed to deal w/ drugs
@bj_brownlee @ABC @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Only if you only care about cost and disregard policy (Democrats clearly don't think the wall is good policy) and politics (i.e. if shutting down the government works to get what you want, why not do it all the time?).  But clearly the shutdown hurt everyone.
