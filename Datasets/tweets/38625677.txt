Resilience to environmental disasters; through traditional methods such as intercropping, soil protection, locally-adapted seeds &amp; higher agricultural biodiversity, #agroecology has proved more resilient to extreme weather due to #ClimateChange than conventional farming.[11/11]
Harnessing food systems to stop climate change; substantial evidence shows that agroecology‚Äôs holistic approach can contribute to global efforts to mitigate #ClimateChange. [10/11]
Preservation and renewal of genetic resources; cornerstone of #agroecology is the dynamic management of agricultural #biodiversity, to preserve and renew natural resources. [9/11]
Restoring ecosystems, soil health and preserving #biodiversity; #agroecology restores and regulates key elements of ecosystems, for example soil and water quality, nutrient cycling, pest prevention and pollination. [8/11]
Central role of rural women; they have played an historic role in gathering and sowing seeds, producing vegetables and medicinal plants, rearing animals, preserving knowledge about crops and in safeguarding biodiversity and genetic resources. [7/11]
Transparency and access to information; an important part of raising awareness and building the #agroecology movement is the #reconnection of people with food production. [6/11]
Preserving and sharing of cultural diversity and knowledge; traditional #agroecology systems have been developed based on principles of cooperation, integration and dialogue among communities and with nature. [5/11]
Nutrition, health and sustainable livelihoods; #agroecology and territorial markets can ensure diverse and healthy diets, rooted in traditional food cultures, and access to affordable, nutritious, high-quality, fresh food for rural and urban populations. [4/11]
Linking food to territories; territorial markets are better equipped to deal with agricultural challenges than global commodity markets ‚Äì largely due to the multi-functionality of territorial markets involving smallholder agriculture and diversified farming systems. [3/11]
Providing stable yields and tackling hunger; #agroecology systems achieve more stable total yields and even outperform high productivity systems. If supported well, agroecology can double productivity in entire regions within 10 years. [2/11]
A growing body of evidence shows that #agroecology is best placed to deal with the monumental environmental and agricultural challenges ahead. Our new report points out the multiple benefits: https://t.co/9So8bj4jMS [1/11] https://t.co/UqmjLbPSLs

#FoodSovereignty sees food, agriculture, ecosystems and cultures as intrinsically linked; it touches upon lifestyles, development paradigms and geopolitics and its relevance extends far beyond food, to the very survival of our civilization. [15/15]
Scaling up #agroecology would allow more people both urban and rural, to produce and access healthy, nutritious, diverse food at a local level in a way that is environmentally sound and culturally appropriate. [14/15]
#Agroecology and industrial agriculture are not interchangeable. They cannot coexist. They represent two fundamentally different visions of development and well-being and the latter destroys the former. [13/15]
#Digitalization in #agriculture contributes to the dispossession of peasants‚Äô knowledge and their access to resources. It concentrates power in the hands of agribusiness and the financial sector.[12/15]
Agribusiness seizes some elements of #agroecology and combines them with #FalseSolutions such as patented seeds and transgenic plants. The intention is business as usual; accumulation at the cost of nature and workers. [11/15]
Access to and control over natural resources, based on collective rights, for small-scale food producers and workers in rural and peri-urban areas, is the cornerstone of #innovation for #FoodSovereignty and the reconfiguration of food systems.[10/15]
If supported by the right public policies, #agroecology can double agricultural productivity within 10 years. Family farmers have to be at the heart of #innovation in agriculture to ensure they benefit. [9/15]
Smallholders &amp; territorial markets are better equipped to deal with agricultural challenges than global commodity markets ‚Äì largely due to the multi-functionality of territorial markets involving smallholder agriculture and diversified farming systems. [8/15]
Most of the food consumed today around the world comes from 2.1 million peasant-bred plant varieties of 7,000 domesticated plant species, all largely produced without agrochemicals. [7/15]
Through traditional methods such as intercropping, soil protection, locally-adapted seeds and higher agricultural biodiversity, #agroecology has proved to be more resilient to extreme events due to #ClimateChange than conventional farming. [6/15]
Women have played a historic role in gathering and sowing seeds, producing vegetables and medicinal plants, rearing animals, preserving important knowledge about crops and safeguarding biodiversity and genetic resources. [5/15]
Indigenous peoples, peasants, fisherfolk, forest dwellers and others are custodians of thousands of years of research, creation, improvement and skill-sharing. Their #agroecology is based on cooperation, integration and dialogue with nature. [4/15]
Transformation of #food and #agriculture systems is not just about introducing breakthrough or disruptive innovations, or new needs, markets and application spaces. It must include the adaptation and improvement of existing practices. [3/15]
Agricultural innovation shouldn't only be about technology. A holistic approach is needed, cutting across social, economic, cultural and environmental dimensions. Change and innovation must have positive impacts for small-scale food providers! #Agroecology [2/15]
Innovation is not a goal per se. Some innovations will contribute to environmental degradation, disrupt livelihoods and exacerbate inequalities. It‚Äôs important to understand which ones will work, where and for whom. [1/15] @FAO @UN_CFS #AgInnovation https://t.co/9So8biMIVk https://t.co/W0aZGC3ODh
