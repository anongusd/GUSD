We face serious threats to our democratic institutions, our security, our values, and our economies.		The path ahead may be rocky, but only together can we overcome them.
The US and Europe have spent decades working to build a rules-based international order that supports stability, preserves peace, &amp; advances economic opportunity for all. Yet these rules are under assault by #Iran‚Äôs support for terror, a revanchist #Russia, and a rising #China.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The dialogue between the US and Europe, at all levels, must deepen.		We need engagement not just between heads of state, but from legislature to legislature, party to party, civil society to civil society, business to business, and citizen to citizen.
3Ô∏è‚É£ We must consistently act in support of #NATO. ¬†That means that all political leaders in the United States, including the president, should never waver from a robust and rock solid commitment to the Alliance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Likeminded public servants on both sides of the Atlantic must renew efforts to support the democratic process, civil society, and #humanrights abroad.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Change begins at home. We must defend our alliances by making clear to our people exactly what is at stake: nothing short of peace, prosperity, and #democracy itself.
What can we do to strengthen the transatlantic bond? I have a few ideas...
Instead of attacking our friends in Europe (as President Trump has done), we should redouble our efforts to find areas of common ground.		In a world where we need to work together to face real threats, I for one humbly believe that the US should LECTURE less and LEAD more.
We can point to actions of the Trump Admin‚Äîits decision to withdraw from the #ParisClimateAccords, its imposition of steel tariffs, its downgrading of long-held universal values of democracy and #humanrights‚Äîthat put our translatlantic relationship under serious strain.
It‚Äôs also the 5th anniversary of the start of #Ukraine‚Äôs Revolution of Dignity. I want to express my solidarity with the #Ukrainian people as this conflict grinds into its 6th year. May it be the last.

The President has said that he has ‚Äúzero investments in Russia.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the problem: Donald Trump may not have investments in Russia, but it‚Äôs quite possible that the Kremlin has an investment in him.		What does Putin have on Trump?		WHY WON‚ÄôT HE HOLD RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE?
While we need to let investigations pan out, the possibility of a counterintelligence investigation against a President should shake us to the core. Instead, we‚Äôre barely surprised.		The American people deserve to know WHO they elected to be their president.

I urge the Admin to try a new approach &amp; develop a strategy to stabilize our arms control regime. The relationship w/ the Russian Federation remains a challenge, but we must address these arms control issues and negotiate an agreement that ensures stability in our nuclear forces.
Trump CLEARLY lacks an appreciation or understating of the importance of arms control treaties and today‚Äôs withdrawal from the INF treaty is *yet another* geostrategic gift to Vladimir Putin.
Throughout this process however, I've had serious concerns that the Trump Administration lacks a coherent strategy to address the threat new Russian cruise missiles pose to the interests of the United States and those of our allies.

Citizens brave enough to criticize their gov't must know the U.S. supports their right. If #JamalKhashoggi was murdered for exercising his fundamental rights, we must act.

The Trump Admin is targeting those w/ preexisting conditions again - this time with #JunkPlans. These barebones insurance plans are, well, junk. They can deny you for a preexisting condition &amp; not cover basic health services. Yet the GOP just denied our effort to stop them...
Health plans that don't cover prescription drugs or ER visits are #junkplans. Yet Trump wants them on the market so you could spend thousands on a plan, &amp; find out it doesn't cover what you need. We banned these in NJ, now I'm wrking w/ @SenatorBaldwin to ban them nationally https://t.co/77DbIuTBPt
The Trump Admin's #junkplans rule doesn't cover those with preexisting conditions - and while I'm thankful we don't have junk plans in NJ, no one should buy insurance only to discover it doesn't really cover you. Proud to join @SenatorBaldwin to stop this reckless rule

As for me, I grew up in a tenement in Union City. I got elected to my school board to fight for underprivileged classmates, worked hard to graduate from @saintpetersuniv &amp; @RutgersLaw and rose to be a U.S. Senator. That's my #HispanicHeritageMonth story. That's the American Dream
My mother, Evangelina, immigrated from Cuba &amp; worked as a seamstress. She built an amazing family. This #HispanicHeritageMonth, let's never forget: there‚Äôs no American Dream without Hispanics. We are a fundamental part of this nation - essential to our economy, society &amp; culture. https://t.co/L4L7MBUZ0a
I look forward to working with the State Department to ensure the Senate Foreign Relations Committee fully exercises our power and authority to conduct a thorough, accurate, and vigorous confirmation process for Ambassador Haley‚Äôs successor.
The Admin commit to a pragmatic path forward that embraces America‚Äôs history of shaping the international institutions that have elevated America‚Äôs role in promoting peace, human rights, and security around the world.
This administration‚Äôs continued inability to adequately or appropriately fill key national security positions puts our nation at risk. The President and Secretary of State must immediately name a new ambassador to the United Nations for the Senate‚Äôs consideration.
I want to thank @nikkihaley for her willingness to express moral clarity to the world and to President Trump, and promote American values and leadership on the global stage, even when she lacked the backing of the White House or State Department.
Deeply concerned about leadership vacuum Amb Nikki Haley leaves &amp; the national security impact of her departure at a time of continued disarray for this Administration.

We will keep up the incredible energy that has been building across this country by young people, by women, by good citizens who know in their hearts that America is better than this, and we deserve better than the likes of power hungry men like Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh.
But to those who feel tempted by these events to give into despair, who feel that gut punch of hopelessness, I promise you all is not lost.	 	The burden on all of us to continue fighting for progress just became a little bit heavier. But we can share in that burden together.
I shudder at the thought of Justice Brett Kavanaugh casting the deciding vote in Supreme Court cases that determine whether the President is above the law, whether Dreamers have a future in this country, reproductive rights, civil rights, gun safety, workers rights &amp; so much more
I‚Äôm frustrated that our nation's progress towards women‚Äôs rights, civil rights, LGBTQ equality and so much more could be stalled by a Justice that far-right interest groups have groomed to do their bidding.
I'm angry for the survivors of sexual assault who were told that we may have heard you, but we will never believe you. I‚Äôm disappointed in the travesty of this process, and Republicans who endanger the reputation &amp; credibility of the Supreme Court to advance a right-wing agenda.
Like many NJans, this vote has left me angry, disappointed, frustrated, and fearful for the future. And yet, I am resolute. I am determined. And yes, I am hopeful. Justice Kavanaugh‚Äôs vote is not the only vote that matters in this democracy. My thoughts - https://t.co/mt7kM9TCkJ
Remember Merrick Garland, and how Republicans orchestrated the theft of a Supreme Court seat w/ over 9 months left in President Obama‚Äôs term		Apparently, being nominated by President Obama is more disqualifying than being credibly accused by multiple women of sexual assault.
My daughter has grown up never knowing what it was like to live in a country where women were denied reproductive choice.	 	I fear my granddaughter may grow up never knowing what it was like to live in a country where women HAD reproductive choice.	 	#VoteNo
In casting Dr. Ford's brave testimony aside, the message sent to survivors is clear: they heard you. But they do not believe you.	 	We must make sure Dr. Ford‚Äôs courage to step forward will not be in vain. It is up to us to empower survivors and speak truth to power. https://t.co/xX4etITESe
Let‚Äôs remember what‚Äôs going on here - why Trump didn't just pick someone else. Judge Kavanaugh has expansive views of executive power. So President Trump is overlooking credible allegations of sexual assault because he views Brett Kavanaugh as his get-out-of-jail free card. https://t.co/LBdsxE4Faj

Jonathan, here's how I translated Trump's tweet: "You are not a survivor. You are not a person with pain. Your memories are not credible. You must be mistaken. Your voice doesn‚Äôt matter."  	 	It was despicable. https://t.co/fEuFw30PTa

Two takeaways from today‚Äôs hearings: 	1.  I  am more confident than ever that Brett Kavanaugh is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court. 	2.  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford is not only to be believed, but as my friend @CoryBooker said, she is a hero.

If Brett Kavanaugh refuses to withdraw, then at the very least we cannot move forward until there is a complete and thorough investigation of what appears to be a disturbing pattern of behavior by this nominee.
The courage Deborah Ramirez and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford have shown is remarkable. Their treatment by Republicans and right wing pundits is despicable. These brave women deserve an FBI investigation, a pause on the nomination process, and basic respect.

Instead it took 8 days for the President to put someone in charge &amp; nearly 2 weeks to issue a disaster declaration for the whole island. Never in my life did I imagine a President who would display such callous disregard, disrespect &amp; outright contempt for 3.5 million Americans
We don‚Äôt expect the President to be able to stop a storm, But when millions are in grave danger, a capable President would have had a three-star general deployed, had medical evacuation vessels, aid and relief delivery systems on standby, and the USNS Comfort ready for deployment
We knew one year ago that Hurricane Maria would be dire.	 	But we had no way of knowing that the pain and suffering unleashed by a natural disaster named Maria would be prolonged by a man-made disaster named Trump. https://t.co/4lwO7pOzZp

4. For decades, refugee resettlement was a bipartisan point of pride. I call on Republicans to join us in demanding the reversal of this decision, and put forth refugee policies that not only reflect our fundamental values, but also serve our humanitarian &amp; strategic interests.
3. As Seasoned &amp; qualified civil servants are being pushed out by anti-immigration hardliners, I‚Äôm concerned that Secretary Pompeo has either been unwilling or unable to be voice of reason in the room when the President has grinded the refugee program to a halt.
2. This jeopardizes our moral leadership on the global stage, and eliminates the critical role our refugee resettlement program plays in global stability. This is a time to defend our values and ideals as Americans, and alleviate the biggest refugee crisis since World War II.
1. Truly repugnant to see the Trump Administration double down on rejecting our foundational values &amp; drastically decrease the number of refugees we accept. This rejects our humanitarian duty of providing those escaping persecution the opportunity to seek protection &amp; safe haven

2 yrs ago @CoryBooker, @BillPascrell &amp; I were at @sjh_nj for an opioid summit to announce the Alternatives to Opiates program. Their program worked so well, that we fought to make it part of this legislation to combat the #OpioidCrisis. So proud it was included in today‚Äôs bill. https://t.co/j0PP5PgkQo
We have to make researching the opioid epidemic as easy as possible. Glad my bill to create annual reports about opioid issues in Medicaid made it into the Senate bill so third party researchers can use it to help end the epidemic https://t.co/WYiaMPKcEX
The rules regulating treatment facilities are often arbitrary and ridiculous. I wrote sections of the bill to remove unnecessary barriers to treatment and expand the number of facilities that can provide treatment for opioid misuse. https://t.co/SoYnOUgu4G
I wrote three different bills that were incorporated in the Opioid Crisis Response Act so that best efforts can be made to keep children out of foster care and with their families if a parent seeks treatment. https://t.co/biZQ9WkqjD
THREAD: Proud to have authored provisions to the Opioid Crisis Response Act that will keep children out of foster care, expand treatment opportunities, fight trafficking, expand the drug Court program, support opioid alternatives, and more. Here are the details
SUCCESS! We have blocked Senator Lee‚Äôs proposed amendment and passed the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act. Patients should be able to learn how to get medicine for the lowest price - that's just one way to lower prescription drug costs. Here's others I'm working on üëá https://t.co/3hSGVNeDBw
UPDATE -Sen Mike Lee is attempting to amend our Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act to limit the gag order ban to only *some* health plans. We just want to tell people their medicine could be cheaper! What's the problem? I urge my colleagues to join me &amp; vote down his amendment
Heading to the @DSenFloor to vote for the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, which simply lets pharmacists tell you if there's a cheaper way to buy prescription drugs. This should be an easy one - I don't see why anyone would oppose it (but I've been surprised before...) https://t.co/d68HgZUzuQ
Nothing's impossible. #OTD last year, Republicans tried to resuscitate healthcare repeal.

The Senate unanimously passed the Know the Lowest Price Act to stop pharmacist gag orders for Medicare two weeks ago. This bill would simply expand the ban on gag orders to cover patients with ACA coverage. I've fought for both bills and will work to pass this tonight.
The Senate has an important task tonight. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Patient Right to Know Act. Pharmacists shouldn't be banned from telling you how to save money on prescription drugs - that's common sense. https://t.co/IgvSpTIf7r
Now, I recognize the bill isn't enough. I fully support a larger, comprehensive bill to tackle this crisis. I‚Äôm disappointed Republicans let political concerns ahead of an election stop them from working w/ @SenateDems to do something truly groundbreaking. https://t.co/TDhvkzseb5
As I head back to the senate tonight, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the Opioid Response Act so we can begin to crawl out of this #opioidcrisis. I've been trying to pass several bills to tackle the #OpioidEpidemic, so I'm proud many of my proposals are included.

If you‚Äôre not a parent, ask a parent how much they pay for #childcare. I bet you will be stunned. We need the Childcare for Working Families Act. We need #ChildCare4All. Read about our bill here: https://t.co/9D6b4V7ZUd https://t.co/nyzWzY7oRq
Too many American parents consider leaving their job when they don't want to, simply because child care costs eat half their income anyway. They fall behind in their career, and lose out on future earnings. That's why we need our bill to make #ChildCare4All affordable at last. https://t.co/EuOth7N7VO
$44 a week for child care. That‚Äôs the most a typical NJ family of 4 would pay for child care under our Child Care for Working Families Act.

The Govt received 2,431 requests for funeral assistance after #HurricaneMaria - so they KNEW at least 2,431 lives were lost - and STILL insisted it wasn't that bad. We must #StandWithPuertoRico - not deny the facts on the ground. https://t.co/dZE2dMyK6L
This is how you #StandWithPuertoRico, Mr. President. I visited after #HurricaneMaria to assess the damage, I fought for serious investments to rebuild, urged airlines to help victims, fought for health &amp; housing assistance &amp; more. Scroll to read the list https://t.co/O7jghXVBmS
Noteworthy on Trump‚Äôs Puerto Rico tweets: he‚Äôs essentially saying Puerto Ricans tried to game the system -  saying they included anyone who died "for any reason, like old age."  This simply reflects his most insidious views about Hispanics. #StandWithPuertoRico

@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre right, Mr. President. The Hurricane didn‚Äôt kill 3,000 people. Your botched response did.
Main reason I just voted against Trump IRS Commissioner: he wouldn't defend NJ's charitable deduction tax credit program. The Trump Admin is so intent on sticking it to NJ that they‚Äôre willing to jeopardize longstanding programs in 32 other states, and Rettig is ok with it. https://t.co/6SH52BZZTV
So I can‚Äôt in good conscience support Charles Rettig. He won‚Äôt respect perfectly legal state-based programs that offer tax credits in return for contributions to nonprofits that do critical work in their communities. He‚Äôll rubber stamp Trump‚Äôs politically motivated tax policies.
We've always worked to ensure Americans don‚Äôt pay taxes twice on their hard-earned money - that is, until Donald Trump came along. Republicans abandoned their so-called fiscal conservatism, and passed a #GOPTaxScam that subjects hundreds of thousands of NJans to double taxation. https://t.co/elNp7Ero88
Voting against President Trump‚Äôs nominee for IRS Commissioner, Charles Rettig. He won‚Äôt protect New Jersey‚Äôs middle class from higher property tax bills. He‚Äôll be nothing more than a Republican rubber stamp for President Trump‚Äôs politically motivated tax policies.

As someone who worked tirelessly in 2014-15 to get FEMA to reopen Superstorm Sandy claims reviews, I can tell you that $10 million is A LOT of money to take from FEMA- esp. as #HurricaneFlorence approaches.

5/5. In the last year and a half, it has often been the courts that save us from some of Trump's xenophobic &amp; vindictive policies. That protection could end if Kavanaugh takes a seat on the court &amp; bends the arc of justice backwards to a time &amp; place none of us want to go back to
4/5. And making their way through the courts now is a case arguing that protections for pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional, and a case that could result in deportation for 800,000 Dreamers.
3/5. When a South Carolina law that could have blocked 63,756 minority voters from the polls came before Judge Kavanaugh, he thought it was constitutional.

For those naively saying there's no reason for concern about 3D printed guns because 3D printers are expensive - well, 3D printers once weighed hundreds of pounds &amp; cost thousands, but today you can put one on your desk for less than 1k, and they're only getting cheaper.
These so-called ‚Äúghost guns‚Äù are as terrifying as they sound. They can pass through metal detectors undetected. They have no serial numbers, so law enforcement can‚Äôt trace them. And anyone can buy a 3D printer and make themselves a firearm with no background check at all. https://t.co/n6BgRJUMqV

Americans must let every member of the Senate know that a vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to make abortion illegal, end protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, and further rig our justice system in favor of rich and powerful corporate interests.

(2) how the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime will be rebuilt without a coalition of the willing; 	and (3) how the Administration plans to address the range of ways in which Iran continues to threaten the security of the United States and our allies.
The President must immediately send his national security team to Congress to explain (1) how his Administration will continue long-standing U.S. policy to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon outside of the JCPOA without partners...
And let's not forget, Congress is still waiting for the Administration to deliver the legally-mandated strategy for countering Iran that was due in January.
The governments of Iran, Russia, and China will seize this opportunity of self-imposed U.S. isolation to continue major weapons sales, deepen economic ties, and further challenge the United States and Europe not only in the Middle East but in other areas like North Korea.
The President initially had an opportunity to work with our allies and build follow-on agreements to address serious concerns with the JCPOA, including Iran‚Äôs nuclear capacity after certain restrictions expire. But now, President Trump owns the consequences of today‚Äôs decision.
While I strongly opposed the JCPOA, it is a grave mistake to walk away from this deal without a plan for ensuring that Iran does not restart its nuclear weapon program, without a strategy for countering Iran‚Äôs dangerous non-nuclear activities, and without our allies and partners.
I remain proud that I helped lead the bipartisan work in Congress to pass a series of sanctions that - more than anything else ‚Äìwere responsible for Iran‚Äôs willingness to come to the negotiating table in the first place.
With this dangerous decision, Pres. Trump is risking US national security, recklessly upending foundational partnerships with key European allies &amp; gambling with Israel‚Äôs security		Today‚Äôs withdrawal makes it more likely Iran will restart its nuclear weapons program in the future

So...the lesson learned here is that while the progress made is encouraging, we need to follow the old adage, "trust, but verify." 		I want a denuclearization agreement, but one that NK won't back out of...again.
2013-2015: NK once again tests a nuclear weapon and does so two more times in the following two years. Sanctions widely supported by the international community are levied by the U.S. and China against North Korea for their provocative actions.
2011-2012: Kim Jong Il dies and is replaced my Kim Jong Un. The US and NK soon agree to an end in nuclear enrichment and weapons testing in exchange for food and aid. This deal collapses after North Korea launches a satellite, violating the agreement.
2007: A new agreement is reached with NK. They agree to disarm &amp; let inspectors into the country	 	2008: NK doesn't meet requirements agreed upon in the previous treaty, and reopens closed reactors.	 	2009: NK launches a rocket, removes inspectors, tests another nuclear weapon...
2006: North Korea rejects denuclearization, testing their first nuclear warhead. In response, the UN implements economic sanctions.
2005: After two years of negotiations and frustrating set-backs, North Korea finally agrees to a statement of principles that banned their nuclear weapons. But problems arose again when NK could not accept U.S. inspection protocols‚Ä¶
2001-2002: President Bush reviews NK policies &amp; deems them ineffective. Evidence is found that NK continued building nuclear weapons after signing a prohibitive treaty. When confronted about this, NK expelled nuclear inspectors and withdrew from disarmament treaties‚Ä¶
1993-94: North Korea tried to bar nuclear inspectors from inspecting waste sites. In response Pres. Clinton threatened sanctions. With tensions high, President Jimmy Carter went to negotiate a new deal regarding nuclear inspections, he was successful and the crisis was averted‚Ä¶
1991: President George H.W. Bush announces he will withdraw nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula, and North and South Korea sign a treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons and their testing in the future‚Ä¶

Finally, after committing to transparency in his opening statement, Director Mike Pompeo was not forthcoming when I questioned him about his involvement in the Russia investigation.
Past statements indicate he has a preference for military action before exhausting diplomacy. He was unable to satisfactorily explain some of the more egregious statements he's made about Muslims, or defend his positions denying women &amp; LGBTQ individual‚Äôs fundamental human rights
While Director Pompeo was certainly constrained by the Administration‚Äôs lack of vision, his own personal record is deeply troubling...
When I asked what the Administration‚Äôs plan was for unilaterally withdrawing from the Iran deal, and whether it was in our national security interests, he again offered a series of goals but no strategy on how to achieve them.
When I and others repeatedly pressed him to outline specific policies to counter Syrian, Russian and Turkish efforts in Syria, he gave me a series of goals.
More broadly, Director Pompeo did little to assuage my concerns about the Administration‚Äôs deafening lack of strategic vision for any of our major global challenges.

The American ppl &amp; our allies are still questioning if the President is willing to fully #DefendOurDemocracy &amp; national security. The CAATSA law I co-authored offers the framework for a comprehensive strategy through a range of powerful mandates which would do just that.
I welcome today‚Äôs sanctions on Russian oligarchs &amp; gov't officials, which I called for many months ago.

Swipe to see my fact check of the President‚Äôs DACA tweetstorm, which was simply devoid of facts.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/36REEjAaqB
Mr. President, these are children‚Äôs lives you are playing with here. Stop the bogus claims to excuse your anti-immigrant agenda. Instead, you could reinstate DACA immediately. 		That‚Äôs right, YOU ended DACA and YOU could bring it back.
Then the President said ‚ÄúDACA is dead because the Democrats didn‚Äôt care or act.‚Äù 		Again, wrong. In this article alone, you can see 5 separate times where Trump rejected a bipartisan solution we proposed (including ones he previously supported!) https://t.co/cxxuKoiWwj

I said no to bringing back the days of risky mortgage lending practices that created a wave of foreclosures, displacing families, destroying home values, and destabilizing neighborhoods.

Deputy Secretary Sullivan is a capable leader whom I trust will keep the Department afloat during this tumultuous time of transition.
I remain convinced that the best person to serve as the nation‚Äôs top diplomat must be someone who can rise above partisanship, and commit to promoting core American interests, including values-driven diplomacy.
Director Pompeo has served his country in multiple capacities, and I look forward to a rigorous confirmation process to consider his nomination.
President Trump has demonstrated yet again that he is the Commander-in-Chaos. The State Department is in disarray because of President Trump and Secretary Tillerson‚Äôs misguided efforts to reform a Department they fundamentally do not understand.  https://t.co/3qnZQJF8pg

Pyongyang‚Äôs track record in past diplomatic engagement leaves considerable room for skepticism about their intentions in this negotiation.  Nevertheless, testing diplomacy is far preferable to the risks of a catastrophic and costly war.
But I have deep concerns about President Trump‚Äôs ability to engage in the clear-eyed diplomacy necessary to achieve a verifiably denuclearized North Korea and protect American national security interests and those of our allies.
I welcome any opportunity to forge a diplomatic pathway and prevent a possible military misadventure with North Korea, and commend President Moon for his efforts. https://t.co/4kWL9pt71P

March 5th should have been the day President Trump fullfilled his promise to #ProtectDreamers &amp; signed #DreamAct. Instead, Dreamers are forced to live a nightmare Trump created. Despite court injunctions, many Dreamers aren't protected.  End the uncertainty. Pass the #DreamActNow

Then a courageous employee dares speak her mind and speak up for the American people she works for, and Secretary Carson demotes her?? This is truly outrageous, and Congress must take action to defend the American taxpayer.
Is anyone going to live under that dining table Mr. Secretary? Does it help solve our affordable housing crisis? Does it help hardworking Americans buy a home and enter the middle class?
Ben Carson could have spent $31,000 on:	-Supporting a 35-bed homeless shelter for a year 	-Rent assistance for three low-income families 	-Daily Meals on Wheels delivery to 13 homebound seniors for a full year 	 	But he spent it on a single table.	https://t.co/1kYI5ctyuh

@SueBee0619 Thank you for your kind words. Trying to fix their error legislatively now.
Taxpayers shouldn‚Äôt have to subsidize corporate sexual misconduct‚Äì nor should victims be taxed after enduring traumatic experiences. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing a bill to fix this mess. And I will personally write that language so Republicans don't screw this one up too.
It‚Äôs infuriating. My amendment clearly stated I wanted to stop businesses from getting a tax write-off for sexual misconduct and continue protecting victims, but Republican negligence during a haphazard drafting process could now force victims to pay taxes on settlements.
That‚Äôs apparently when things went wrong. In their mad rush to draft this bill, the GOP erroneously included the clause ‚Äúthis chapter‚Äù that some experts say could potentially force victims to pay taxes on settlement awards they receive.
My amendment clearly referred solely to business expense deductions for sexual misconduct payouts. To my surprise, Republicans adopted it. BUT Finance Committee amendments are offered as concepts. Once adopted, Republicans are in charge of writing the actual language. https://t.co/hPdLaF7dSY
During the Finance Committee markup, I offered an amendment to stop corporations from writing off sexual misconduct payments as business expenses. That's right, settlement payments for sexual harassment were actually tax deductible.
I wrote a provision to end corporate tax write-offs for sexual misconduct settlements. But Republicans got sloppy in their mad rush to pass their #GOPTaxScam, and their maddening error may now end up hurting victims.  Here's what happened:

@kengumbo Ken, 	I know how to work with Republicans to get things done, and have done so many times. But that tax bill was nothing but a scam, hiking taxes on the middle class to pay for huge giveaways to corporations and the top 1%. I was proud to vote AGAINST it.

NJ‚Äôans can‚Äôt afford to subsidize the rest of the country more than we already do, and this highway robbery threatens to drive down home values and decimate our state‚Äôs ability to invest in public schools, infrastructure, law enforcement, &amp; vital economic priorities. #GOPTaxScam
#GOPTaxScam takes billions from hardworking NJ families by gutting the SALT deduction they rely on to deduct a combined $34 billion every year. And our children get stuck w/ trillions in debt these ‚Äúdeficit hawks‚Äù will use as an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid
Ive always believed our tax code needs simplification for small businesses &amp; the middle class, but Republicans made it crystal clear they werent serious about a real reform like that. Instead they wrote a plan that hurts NJ families &amp; brazenly benefits corporate special interests

Republicans say middle class taxes won't go up, and investments in local services won‚Äôt go down. All I suggested was that SALT deductions return if they're wrong. But they wouldn't have it. I guess they don't trust what they're saying any more than I do.

Just intro'd this measure we're now voting on because GOP says gutting SALT deduction to pay for corporate tax breaks won‚Äôt force cuts in local investments.

Now I voted for an amendment I cosponsored that would have permanently expanded the child tax credit. Republicans, again, said no. #GOPTaxScam
I just voted to stop future cuts to Medicare and Social Security that may be triggered by #GOPTaxBill, but not surprisingly the Republicans rejected it. It's almost like they know those kind of painful cuts is exactly what their deficit will lead to. #GOPTaxScam
