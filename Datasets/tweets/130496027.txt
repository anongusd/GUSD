RT @WesleyLowery: Imagine going back to politics twitter 2012 to explain the 2019 split screen of ‚ÄúPresident Donald Trump‚Äù ‚Äúranting at CPAC‚Ä¶
@leahmcelrath Yes, and a lot of this involves subtlety and signaling and a willingness to listen and empathize, which doesn‚Äôt come natural to every politician or campaign (though I feel pretty good about a lot of our current candidates, and the ‚Äò18 crop were quite successful as well)
@leahmcelrath But, as Josh points out, we should still be careful to then discuss our policies in the most persuasive way.
@leahmcelrath Definitely powerful. Has helped a minority win elections and cling to power for many years. I‚Äôm just saying they‚Äôll make that powerful argument regardless of what we actually propose, so we might as well propose what‚Äôs necessary to meet the challenge at hand.
@leahmcelrath Oh, I‚Äôm well aware of why they‚Äôre doing it. I did spend a few years working for the madrassa-educated Kenyan socialist.
@jbarro And I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd agree that a debate about the real costs and transitions necessary to achieve net zero emissions would be far more productive than arguing over a poorly phrased line in a FAQ
@jbarro For some reason you‚Äôve morphed Trump‚Äôs lies and exaggerations into the more substantive criticism of the GND that is an entirely legitimate debate to have. I agree that those are pernicious impulses, but ‚Äúthey always lie‚Äù isn‚Äôt a talking point, it‚Äôs a factual political dynamic.
RT @AriMelber: Trump emphasized he was serious about his request to Russia *during* the press conference. Legally, to pretend he is joking‚Ä¶
@jbarro The fact sheet explicitly said they wouldn‚Äôt be abolishing cows, but the point is, as usual, Republicans will make that the focus instead of more believable, substantive criticism. 		I still recall them making ‚ÄúYou Didn‚Äôt Build That‚Äù the theme of an entire day of their convention
@ira my car will not miss next time 		Big fan of the show though
I can‚Äôt believe Trump‚Äôs still speaking. This is like a SOTU on LSD.
In 2016, the immigration message was central, but Trump also talked about corruption in Washington, trade, job loss, etc. It was all bullshit, but he said it. None of that this time around.
Trump‚Äôs re-election message is that America has no problems except for an imaginary invasion of violent immigrants - no economic challenges, no health care challenges, no foreign policy challenges, no climate crisis, nothing. 		That‚Äôs quite a bet to make.
When you‚Äôve been calling your opponents and their policies socialist for the last few decades, the attack sort of loses its bite.
Trump saying that the Green New Deal will eliminate all cows, planes, cars, and buildings is why Democrats should never make policy based on what we think Republicans will say. They will never criticize the policy on the merits. They will always tell the craziest lies.
I‚Äôve never thought Democratic candidates should make their message about Trump, but this was one of the best parts of Bernie‚Äôs speech and a reminder that figuring out some kind of contrast with Trump is important. Highlights the choice for voters. https://t.co/VT5WuxlVap

@annehelen This is the most joyfully nostalgic I‚Äôve been in months
@bhueypdx @BenjySarlin Not at all. The divisive figure they were complaining about was Trump.
@BP_Diamond No one specific - definitely some nostalgia. And they didn‚Äôt directly ask for inspiration, it was more like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sick of all the yelling and name-calling. Trump does that and we‚Äôre tired of it.‚Äù
@BenjySarlin Yeah for sure. I should also say that I don‚Äôt see Warren as divisive, and I think her rhetoric can often be inspiring and unifying. But the right, and Trump, have clearly had their sights on her for a long time now.
@BenjySarlin It can sound discordant, and can drive you nuts because what stands in the way of an economically populist agenda isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdivisiveness‚Äù but ‚ÄúRepublicans.‚Äù And yet, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs perceived to people who aren‚Äôt strong partisans.
@BenjySarlin I think there‚Äôs a split on substance and style. When I talked to Obama-Trump voters in Michigan for The Wilderness, they were very amenable to economic populism (Medicare for All, big infrastructure plan), but wanted that populism to come from a more unifying figure.

@yeselson @jmartNYT Yeah I think the path for Ds in the South has to be driving up turnout and margins in the suburbs and among black voters, though I think it‚Äôs also worth trying to make sure that the floor in rural areas doesn‚Äôt fall too much further.
@jmartNYT Though, Florida, as @steveschale points out, has its own problems that don‚Äôt quite fit any of this analysis
@jmartNYT You wrote that Gillum, Abrams, and O‚ÄôRourke electrified black and progressive white voters, but had an equal and opposite effect on rural voters. But since they actually improved on Hillary‚Äôs performance, it seems as if they cut against the overall trend against Ds in rural areas
@cameron_kasky I learned it from watching you Cameron.
8. Anyway, people who are smarter and more experienced than me talk about all of this and more in https://t.co/t6D9XGbrcf, so check it out. And JMart is a great reporter - I just take issue with some of the conclusions implied in this piece.
@steveschale @NateSilver538 Absolutely! I see it all as persuasion - we need messages and candidates that persuade our voters it‚Äôs worth turning  out, and swing voters that it‚Äôs worth giving us a chance.
7. What 2018 did prove is that Democrats can win and/or make gains everywhere with a progressive, policy-focused message on issues like health care without giving an inch on issues of equal rights and social justice.
6. Clearly, polarization is real, as we can see from the growing divide between urban/suburban areas and rural/exurban areas. But evidence simply doesn‚Äôt support the implication that a) it‚Äôs caused by progressivism or b) it‚Äôs irreversible.
5. And yet, there was evidence that progressive policies did quite well, even in red states: MO voters approved a minimum wage increase; UT, NE, ID approved Medicaid expansion; FL approved voting rights for the formerly incarcerated; MI approved legal weed and automatic reg, etc.
4. @NateSilver538 points that out here: https://t.co/uJiDgSsyjY 		In 2018, there was no evidence that moderate or conservative Democrats did any better in red states/red counties than progressive Democrats.
3. Of course, many of the bigger rural gains came in the Midwest, not the South, and younger voters were largely responsible, but at the very least, it doesn‚Äôt support the causality implied in the piece: that it‚Äôs progressive policies or candidates that have caused the decline.
2. We know this because of another NYT story by @StanGreenberg: ‚ÄúDemocrats cut the Republicans‚Äô margin in rural areas by 13 points, according to the Edison exit poll and by seven points in one by Catalist.‚Äù Full piece: https://t.co/MmHQcpxxH4
Few thoughts about this @jmartNYT piece:		1. It‚Äôs true there‚Äôs been an overall, long-term decline in Democratic performance among rural voters. But it‚Äôs odd to make 2012 the reference point when Dems made their biggest gains between 2016 and 2018 among...rural voters. https://t.co/9AeNYVFNSt

@JayCaruso Well, everyone else has access to the actual speech and the actual decision, so I‚Äôll let them decide. Have a great Thanksgiving.
Our annual Podsgiving Mailbag episode is up! ‚Å¶@danpfeiffer‚Å© and I answer your questions, and then I talk to ‚Å¶@DorisKGoodwin‚Å© about her new book ‚ÄúLeadership: In Turbulent Times‚Äù https://t.co/EF0qp45hQt
@JayCaruso Nope. Didn‚Äôt accuse. Said he believed the decision would lead to that kind of spending. Which is exactly what Stevens said.
Hey Jay - maybe read the link you sent me. Obama said he believed that would happen, which is exactly what Justice Stevens said he believed would happen in his dissenting opinion. https://t.co/DdU9CYcRtk
Just want to get this straight: the great offense here is that Obama publicly agreed with Justice Stevens‚Äô dissent and asked Congress to pass a law to remedy the situation. 		What a tyrant!
Yeah Jay it‚Äôs a good thing we haven‚Äôt had any problems with unlimited spending from unknown sources influencing our elections. Great call. https://t.co/kgh5rWm1mt
@brhodes Now that was a highlight
@tomselliott Yes that‚Äôs right he began the sentence with ‚ÄúWith all due deference to the separation of powers‚Äù and ended by asking Congress to pass a law
@blueWRL @jmartNYT Tbh I felt like I needed to say something nice about DC
@jmartNYT But it‚Äôs all still right here on my phone! 		Except for all the good bars and restaurants.
Well worth your time - especially what Obama has to say about race, politics, and 2020. https://t.co/GKmurBNMQV
@KenTremendous It was Alito, but yes!
Here‚Äôs a sample of the hyperventilating from CNN: https://t.co/8Qf4VJdz4x
Remember when Obama politely said that he disagreed with the Citizens United ruling during a State of the Union and Official Washington lost its mind because the Justices happened to be in attendance?

@RadioFreeTom @SchrodSnoFlake @ryangrim @saletan @Ocasio2018 @Sen_JoeManchin Yeah, but what I‚Äôm saying is, there were a number of more progressive challengers who took on incumbents in safe blue districts in 2018.

@BioTurboNick @spiceychicken7 @RadioFreeTom @ryangrim @saletan @Ocasio2018 @Sen_JoeManchin Exactly
@RadioFreeTom @ryangrim @saletan Yes, having 2018 midterms with a bunch of competitive primaries that gave us everyone from @Ocasio2018  to @Sen_JoeManchin led to the disaster of...the best Democratic performance in a midterm since Watergate.

The rest of the media has generally done a commendable job calling out Republican lies and conspiracies. But they‚Äôve done a good enough job in exposing the strategy and motivation behind those lies, lest they be labeled partisan by Republicans.
Some did this before Trump, but Trump showed them all that it works. 		Even in the instances where the legacy media refuses to play along, they know they have a massive propaganda network that helps to protect them and demonize Democrats.
Republican politicians violate norms, abuse power, commit crimes, and then, to muddy the waters in the media, accuse Democrats of the same things. 		They know their lies will get fact-checked, but the game is getting the Both Sides Police to hit the Dems too.
