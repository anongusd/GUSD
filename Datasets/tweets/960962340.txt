Senate Dems want to shut down the federal government and deny health insurance to children across America over an arbitrary DACA deadline. Call your Senators and tell them you don't want a #SchumerShutdown.
The American people need to know the extent to which the FBI and Department of Justice colluded for the political gain of Hillary Clinton. The committee must vote to #ReleaseTheMemo immediately.
The memo prepared by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence must be declassified and released to the public. Our government was built on the principle of transparency. Releasing the memo is vital to maintaining the American people’s trust in our government.
RT @GOPLeader: #TBT @SenSchumer in 2013: “A [government shutdown] is the politics of idiocy, of confrontation, of paralysis.” https://t.co/…
Senate Dems to need to stop playing political games and start governing. https://t.co/L12dN5T0Yv
The House of Representatives passed a freestanding 5-year reauthorization of CHIP on November 3, which all seven of Maryland’s Congressional Democrats opposed, and it is now dying in the Senate because of liberal obstruction. Hopefully the Senate will reauthorize CHIP this time.
Once again, the Democrats in the House have demonstrated that they care more about political games than actually governing. 186 Democrats just voted against a bill that reauthorizes the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years and keeps the government open.

For those that were asking for sources on the marijuana data I tweeted earlier - the data came from the head of DEA during a hearing today
Since Col. legalized pot, more young kids have gone to the ER after being poisoned by marijuana "edibles" (candies, brownies), acc to DEA.
DEA Administrator cites another study: From 2007 to 2011, there was a 48 percent increase in marijuana-related emergency room visits.
DEA Administrator: More teens are entering treatment for marijuana addiction than for alcohol and all other drugs COMBINED.
DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart: Veterinarians are having to put down more and more pets who have ingested "edibles" made with marijuana
DEA Administrator cites study: If you start smoking marijuana in your teens, by the time you're 30, your IQ will have declined by 8 points.
DEA Administrator testifying before a CommerceJusticeScience Subcmte: More teens smoking pot now than there are teens smoking cigarettes.

My initial thoughts on the SOTU speech http://t.co/OmgKMu03
During the President’s speech tonight, America spent $450 million dollars, much of which was borrowed from places like China.
Instead of focusing on getting Americans working again and reducing our debt President Obama focused on gun control and climate change.  3/3
Four straight trillion dollar deficits under the President’s watch clearly show we have a spending problem. Pt 2/3
Like so many of President Obama’s other lofty speeches, his words do not match his actions. pt 1/3
