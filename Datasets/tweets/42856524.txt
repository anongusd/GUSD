@ConstanceWu I’ve never related so much to a character on TV... and I’m okay with that 😂 #Jessica
@SouthwestAir if your going to put people on hold for over 90 minutes why not have the option for a call back?
@SouthwestAir I’ve been on hold for a half hour. Why such long wait times?
@IMAO_ Oh my goodness! That smile! That precious angelic smile!!!
@AllEarsNet Goofy’s Sky School
@SJosephBurns Precautious
@DesireePech @LuvgvsUwngs That’s why what they have is not a real marriage. It’s a chauvinistic dictatorship. I had to stop watching this show because it was such a disgusting display of narcissism on Kody’s part fed into by codependent women. It actually made me sick to my stomach so I removed myself.
@bellasue24 @Mackandcompany @TheStalwart I graduated high school in 04’. I relate 100% to this but I’m not waiting around for anyone to fix my problems. Take the bull by the horns and get to paying that debt down. I’ve been following @DaveRamsey for over 5 years now. I am debt free and saving now. Best of luck!
@TheStalwart This is what happens when everyone is told to go to college and that trades aren’t respectable work. I personally am more of an academic but I wish I was good with technical and mechanical knowledge. Paying for an electrician to make a small fix is no chump change!

@dmag1127 @Alyssa_Milano Both should be protected. This child’s pain is real. Spoken from a Christian, a mother, and a conservative!
@Alyssa_Milano I’m a conservative. I’m a mother. This is unacceptable and sickening. No child should ever have to feel this pain.
@guyselga You should! It’s Mickmazing!
@lruskin @mj_lee I prefer white, but I agree with you otherwise 😉
@TMZ He seems like such a nice guy!
@KevinKyWilliams @froglette1969 @Richard_Schiff @RachelBros @kevinpollak @AlexBorstein @ZegenMichael @MaiselTV I think the point to take away here is that the children seem to be forgotten by both parents for the sake of their careers. Ideally parents should find a better equilibrium between work and family.

@nayroftownsvill @Mephitus_Skunk @jlowen55 @UkrainianBot @StefanMolyneux I agree, he is not helpful to what has been a constructive conversation. You asked what you can do. The answer is don’t cut your sons. End the madness when you are given the choice someday with your own baby. Do research so that you feel comfortable with your decision.
@MarketWatch What a crappy son. I take care of my grandmother’s finances and I’m not hoarding it for myself because I am not a terrible person.

@GlennHowerton I’m really liking AP Bio. My husband and I binge watched last weekend and were genuinely sad when we ran out of episodes. Definitely took the edge off of missing Dennis in Sunny.

@JoyAForsyth As much as I love a "joy"full update, you don't owe anyone social media activity updates.
@MeganCortney @cameraneubanks Same. I almost passed out. Had to lay down on the exam bed other wise I would have definitely blacked out.
@cameraneubanks When I drank that I felt like I was going to pass out. It made me so nauseated. The whole room was spinning! Luckily no GD though.
