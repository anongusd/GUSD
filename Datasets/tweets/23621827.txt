I‚Äôm just arriving @AmericanU to speak about the most impactful story set of my career: the lead contamination of DC‚Äôs drinking water and government coverup in 2004. Stories with great team including @CarolLeonnig @Jo_Becker @dveracohn https://t.co/Vjqd7OXCkm
@John_McKelvey That‚Äôs in the story
@mikefreemanNFL i had no idea it wasn't called Div. I-AA anymore and had a devil of a time writing around that.
The Minnesota Lynx, whose coach said the WH snub was clear gender bias, did a day of community service at a DC elementary school instead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like the Michelle Obama statement, ‚ÄòWhen they go low, we go high,‚Äô‚Äù a Lynx official told me.
Trump hosted Bison after being asked by North Dakota congressional delegation including @SenJohnHoeven. Trump said not only did he say yes right away; he claimed to have watched the Division I-AA title game, even tho he left the Division I title game a year earlier at halftime.
I did a Reddit #AMA today on covering the White House and Trump's summit with Kim Jong Un. Here's a transcript in case it is of interest. I answered w/o fear or favor, incl the question: 'How does it feel to be a fame hungry opportunist?'  https://t.co/B1SvSsyjRr
Today was the first time since 1995 that a Division I-AA team visited the White House. The past two WNBA teams weren't invited nor was the Notre Dame women's basketball team, who won title front of crowd of 19,599. The North Dakota Bison won before 17,802. https://t.co/1MJhFdpaLX

@Bondosan007 @JChengWSJ Yeah that was in GQ. Interesting story.
@DreamsUnderfoot Both!
Trump might sincerely have felt for the Warmbiers, but he also used Otto's death to build an emotional appeal to the American public about the urgent threat of the Kim regime. That emotion is now boomeranging on Trump as he switched from fire/fury to embracing Kim.
Some analysts said it was an unfortunate strategic necessity to separate human rights from the nuclear talks after Trump and Kim got to the bargaining table. Others called it a strategic mistake because the U.S. can't fully normalize relations with a murderous regime like DPRK.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump @brianstelter @CNN @Playboy Thank you Brian!
@annpfau Good catch will fix
I had contacted the Warmbier‚Äôs for this piece in January about Trump‚Äôs silence on human rights but they were not ready to talk amid nuclear summit prep https://t.co/gNWiWBbbSv
I‚Äôm told that Pence and Matt Pottinger at NSC have maintained contact with Warmbiers and that they attended WH holiday party at Flotus invite but Trump‚Äôs public embrace of Kim Jong Un has been increasing difficult for Otto‚Äôs family. Yesterday was the breaking point.

I overheard their argument and put it in pool report with added detail that Obama had delivered ‚ÄúAsia pivot‚Äù  speech in Canberra a day or two earlier in which he held up free press as pillar of American values. That angered Obama WH press shop; they called it a cheap shot.
Press pool vigorously objected to the decision with either @carenbohan or @cparsons leading the argument with @joshearnest (then deputy press sec).
FTR, the Obama WH explanation for keeping out reporters was that the Wen meeting wasn‚Äôt a boost because he was not head of state.

Pompeo and Mulvaney will join Trump for dinner with Kim Jong Un, who is bringing Kim Yong Chol (who visited Trump twice in Oval) and Ri Yong Ho, per WH.
Alrighty then, I just updated my North Korea summit story with the usual discursive grafs that stray from the main theme of high-stakes nuclear talks to explain why Trump was tweeting about Da Nang Dick
Odds that Kim Jong Un enters meeting tonight with Trump and immediately bashes Dick Blumenthal to soften up Potus.
Also despite Trump‚Äôs tweet, a bilateral discussion of Richard Blumenthal was not included in @PressSec readout of Trump‚Äôs meeting with Vietnamese officials cc: @GlennKesslerWP https://t.co/63xw0yKGJO

FWIW, Trump, who arrives Tuesday night Hanoi time, is at the JW Marriott (where I‚Äôll be staying Wednesday night for WH pool duty Thursday).
One interesting note is that the Melia is one of the WH press hotels, mostly housing the TV networks for live shots. (I and many others are at a different hotel around the corner.) If he is staying there, Kim can pop down and do some cable hits each day.
There is a luxury brand store with Fendi, Dior, Gucci across the street from the Melia hotel where Kim Jong Un is thought to be staying for #HanoiSummit and where (mostly South Korea) press corps has staked out hours before his arrival. https://t.co/sk8hDfJeIe

VP office also did not reply when I asked about reports that Pence canceled NK human rights speech in Dec. over concerns it would hamper already fraught bilateral talks. Stephen Biegun, State's special rep for NK, gave speech at Stanford last week w/no mention of human rights.
Why the administration wouldn't engage is a mystery to me, but it kind of affirmed the frame of my piece. The president and his aides don't want to risk talking about North Korean human rights as Potus tries to keep Kim aboard for second summit and cast NK strategy as a win.
I contacted State. A spox said "we don't have anyone that can speak with you at this time" and sent along the anonymous quote: ‚ÄúHuman rights remains a key aspect of our North Korean policy.‚Äù I asked why they had no one available. I got no response.
So a year after Trump made Ji centerpiece of 2018 SOTU, I wanted to know why Trump doesn't talk about North Korean human rights anymore. An NSC spox declined several requests for interview/comment, saying State was best positioned to discuss it even though story was about Potus. https://t.co/WHViL3JMNv

‚ÄúThis is the triumph of symbolism over policy solutions‚Äù: Trump cried wolf for years on immigration as he touted a border wall. Now a true crisis is building, with two kids dead, but there is little political urgency to deal with it. w/‚Å¶@NickMiroff‚Å© https://t.co/s3jsWKBVnR
"This is not really about immigration now." Trump delivers hour-long defense of border wall during Rose Garden appearance as fight for funding becomes defining moment in his presidency. w/@jdawsey1 https://t.co/79tgjrYAja
Trump summarizing shutdown talks 14 days in: "We'll see what happens. It may get solved. It may not get solved."
Trump is now calling on reporters for a second turn, incl @MajorCBS @HallieJackson  ... Trump looks into sea of reporters in Rose Garden: "Okay, who else is out there?"
Trump confirms he's considering declaring a "national emergency" to try to get funding for wall w/o Congress. I wrote about his loose use of the phrase "national emergency," which is what he called the migrant caravan ...  https://t.co/d7YHUpt9Og
Trump loving the show. At 53-min mark of outdoor presser, he laughs and says: "Should we keep this going?" Kevin McCarthy tells him "none of us brought a coat." Trump: "Are you cold? Get out of here." Then offers his overcoat.
FWIW, I think three CNN reporters/contributors have gotten questions at this presser @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan @kaitlancollins (but no sign of @Acosta) .. CNN had this great split screen during Kaitlan's question with two of their reporters in the shot https://t.co/RO3pE5vBxs
In this Rose Garden presser, Trump has said he has a great relationship with Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un and that he dared Nancy Pelosi to impeach him.
He also says he asked Nancy Pelosi why she's not using the shutdown to impeach him. "She said, 'We're not looking to impeach you.'"
Trump responds to question about @RashidaTlaib call to impeach him: "I thought her comments were disgraceful. I think she dishonored herself and her family... Using language like that in front of her son."
. @HallieJackson: "Are you still proud to own the shutdown?" 	Trump looks stumped for a moment: "I'm very proud to be doing what I'm doing."
Trump says Dems offered him a "mythical" $25 billion in past negotiations a year ago over wall funding for DACA/Dreamers fix. Says government could only guarantee $1 billion for the wall.
Trump touting that he stayed in White House during shutdown over holidays: "I didn't even find it to be a lonely place. I find it to be a special place." .. He tweeted over holidays "poor me" about being all alone.
Trump confirms he told Schumer/Dems the shutdown could go on for a year or more. "I did," Trump responds. "I hope it doesn't go on even beyond a few more days."
CNN cuts away from Rose Garden as Pence takes mic, says they'll return to live coverage if Potus takes questions.
Trump has 'acting' officials in six Cabinet jobs and CoS but DHS Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen, whose administration obit has been written many times, is right there in Rose Garden with him. https://t.co/fc8xSjuVve

DHS officials said some contracts will soon be awarded for new wall in Rio Grande with construction to begin summer 2019. DHS has identified 215 miles of new wall, replacement wall and secondary barriers that they hope could be covered with $5.7 billion in House spending plan.
On DHS call, officials said Trump admin has completed 34 miles of replacement wall/barrier and some gates with FY17 funding, have awarded contracts for 13 miles of levee wall in Rio Grande w/FY18 funding. But no new border wall construction has begun since Trump took office.

.@presssec downplays urgency of administration‚Äôs climate report saying it was modeled on most extreme possibilities. Yet Trump galvanized international support on North Korea over most extreme case: that Pyongyang had ICBM that could deliver nuclear warhead to US mainland.

Kudlow says strong US economy in much better position to weather drawn out trade war than is China‚Äôs. But WaPo quoted Chinese gov think tank expert saying China economy would sprain ankle from fall out of 2-story building while US economy would plunge off World Trade Center.
Kudlow said Trump emphasized to aides that there‚Äôs a good chance a trade deal with China can be struck and that POTUS remains ‚Äúopen to that.‚Äù

RT @brhodes: This is exactly right. There was always a bad weather call option. You were a part of some of those @DavidNakamura! https://t.‚Ä¶
My source is very experienced in WH planning. He was adamant: "I'm 100 percent sure they would have had a way to get there by vehicle." END/
"With 43 (Bush) every city we went to, we always had a few options about what do that would be unplanned and the security theory being if nobody knows we're coming they can‚Äôt plan do anything." Trump could have conceivably called an audible. 7/
I asked whether Potus could have done an impromptu, unscheduled event, known in WH parlance as an "OTR" (off-the-record), in Paris, such as at a local memorial. Source said yes, element of surprise would allow Sec. Service confidence to let Potus do it w/o long-lead planning. 6/
The source said US president would travel with a much larger motorcade footprint than would other leaders, such as Macron, Merkel and Trudeau, who all made it out of Paris for other events. Abroad, U.S. motorcade could be 60-70 vehicles incl locals. "No one rolls like we do." 5/
Timing is a factor. If the Potus schedule is packed, driving might take too long. "That would have been something you take all the way up to the president. Hey we can‚Äôt fly, instead of a 20-min helo ride, it'll take a hour and a half drive. You give him the option to cancel." 4/
The military would make the bad weather call to ground Marine One. The key is having enough time to scramble the backup plan -- usually at least an hour is needed, source said. WH would work with locals to put it in motion, predetermined street closures, police escorts, etc. 3/
WH has an big "advance" team that scouts out countries/cities weeks ahead to set up itinerary. "There‚Äôs always a backup plan to drive. He could have gotten there," my source said. Sometimes local officials fret about traffic but "no place would say no you absolutely can't go." 2/

Good question from @HallieJackson: "At what time does a national tragedy take precedence over the president needing to punch back?" Sanders says Trump has "risen to that occasion and worked to bring our country together" after Las Vegas, Pittsburgh shootings and hurricanes.
Sanders is asked whether Trump will enact more tariffs on China if his meeting with Xi Jinping doesn't go well at G20 next month. "I'm not going to get ahead of the president." Sanders keeps avoiding actual policy questions.
. @acosta pressing Sanders repeatedly to state for the record which specific media outlets Potus considers the "enemy of the people" .. She won't do it.
. @PressSec criticizes media for focusing too much on politics. Then, when  @stevenportnoy asks pointed policy questions about caravan, she says: "I'm not going to get into specific policies that we're considering."
Sarah Sanders is asked how Trump administration could stop mass shootings: "If anybody knows the answer this administration would be all ears." This is in contrast to plan to send up to 5,000 military troops to border and potentially strip asylum protections for migrants.

Trump making case in Oval that immigrants from Central America are unfair to immigrants around the world waiting to enter thru legal channels (though many of the CA families are legally seeking asylum). But Trump's plan would have slashed legal immigration 40 percent.
Trump still can't pronounce @AbeShinzo's family name properly. Keeps saying "Prime Minister Ah-bee" sted "Ah-bay."

Pence calls on Goggle to "immediately end development of the Dragonfly app that will strengthen the Communist Party's censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers."
Pence says China "made it harder for our journalists to get visas. It happened after the New York Times published investigative stories into the wealth of Chinese leaders." Two days after @presssec said NYT credibility "at an all time low" over investigation into Trump's wealth.
Pence says a senior career intel official told him this week that "what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what the China is doing across this country."
Pence hits Beijing on another sensitive area, says the United States "always believes Taiwan's embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people." More applause at Hudson.
Pence highlights plight of Uighurs in reeducation camps in China, citing reports that described it as a "deliberate attempt by Beijing to ‚Ä¶ stamp out the Muslim faith." Trump has not publicly mentioned the Uighurs or the persecution of the Muslim Royhinga in Myanmar.
Days after near collision between Chinese and US naval vessels in South China Sea, Pence says operations won't halt: "We will not be intimidated and we will not stand down." Draws applause @HudsonInstitute

Trump arguing with PBS's @yamiche trying to ask about Kavanaugh. "Fake news!" he says, trying to cut off her question. He quickly adds: "I think you do a good job, by the way. I do watch you."
Trump said UN members "weren‚Äôt laughing at me. They were laughing with me. The fake news said people laughed. People had a good time with it. We were doing it together." ... This in a speech whose theme was American sovereignty and going it alone.
Trump calls on NYT: "The Times -- I think they're going to endorse me." Adds CNN&lt; WaPo, others: "They're all going to endorse me because if they don't they'll go out of business."
Trump on one of his top foreign policy issues: "It doesn‚Äôt matter what world leaders think about Iran. Iran‚Äôs going to come back to me and we‚Äôre going to make a great deal. Or not. Deals ‚Äì you never know."
Trump talking about the percentage the Chinese stock market has dropped -- then looks at TV reporter for validation and says, "I think I watched you talking about it." It always comes back to his TV viewing habits.
Trump's 45 minutes into this presser; top was focused on Kavanaugh but we've reached the grab-bag and lightning round stage.
Trump calls on foreign reporter who tells Trump he's a Kurd: "Great people, great people!" Trump replies. "Great fighters. I like this question already."
It's very hard to keep up with all the stuff Trump is saying.
Trump's desperation to sell progress on North Korea seems counterproductive. Kim Jong Un sees how desperate Trump is to get a political victory and Trump keeps making clear he's not considering a military option. Trump used to accuse Obama of publicly revealing his strategy.
Trump refers to "Little Rocket Man" era and says casually: "I guesss you could call it the rhetorical contests with Chairman Kim -- which we both laugh at now, we both smile at."
Trump makes wildly unsubstantiated claim about North Korea: "President Obama thought you had to go to war. You know how close he was to pulling the trigger."
Trump just did that rhetorical sleight of hand and again inflated how much of border wall money has been secured. In passing, he just said the administration has spent $3.2 million and soon will get another $1.6 -- three times actual total so far.  https://t.co/s3qYUTbRtE

Quite a moment when CBS's @weijia tries to ask Trump several times whether allegations against him of sexual misconduct affects his judgement on Kavanaugh. Trump tells her to "sit down," but she persists -- and Trump eventually feels compelled to answer.
Trump then calls on @HallieJackson who asks if Trump thinks all 3 women accusing Kavanaugh are liars. "I've been very busy with Japan, South Korea, China and many other countries, so I don't know about today's person who came forward," Trump says, adds he'll watch Senate hearing
Trump calls on @acosta, who before asking a question requests that Trump call on a female reporter next to ask a question after four men already have had a chance. "What does that mean?" Trump responds, saying after some back and forth that he's fine with that.
@FrankJannuzi @suedanim @observingjapan I agree with your first half, the second half seems to me to sell the moment short.

Trump goes on tirade against Beijing reiterating his belief they are meddling in midterms, cites the China Watch supplement in Des Moines newspaper. "They look like editorials, but they're not. They're made up by China. .. I don't like it when they put out false messages."
Among other things, for Trump to drag Abe into this crisis over Kavanaugh is really out of bounds diplomatically for any country but especially for the Japanese who are protocol obsessed.
Trump responds to reporter question about new allegations against Kavanaugh. Trump calls it a "con game. People are wise to it. [Democrats] are bringing people out of the woods. They could do that to anybody -- except Prime Minister Abe, because he's so pure."
Trump says he would speak for Abe and then said Abe "very hopeful and thinks there's a good chance we can do something with North Korea." Adds Abe wants to help Kim Jong Un on econ development. Most Japan experts said Abe is wary of Trump's strategy to have second summit.
Trump says US-Japan will start bilateral trade talks, which "for many years they were for some reason unwilling to do. Now they are willing to do. I'm sure we will come to a satisfactory conclusion." #UNGA
Japan PM Abe laying it on thick in photo-op with Trump, saying the two had dinner Sunday and "enjoyed the great view from Trump Tower and a wonderful discussion over wonderful dinner you prepared for us. You kindly celebrated my birthday." Trump still mispronouncing Abe's name.

Of course I picked a show that includes Twitter/social as a main character. But I was more impressed that Zoe was reading my favorite author Hermann Hesse.

Here's @AaronBlake: "On Tuesday, Trump got subtly called out for a whopper that he often tells ‚Äî and by his fellow world leaders, no less." https://t.co/Vd6PhCIXmw
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect that reaction, but that‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Trump said to the laughs at UN. But the president appeared somewhat deflated after that, even as he faithfully recited lines from the teleprompters. Full story from me and @agearan of Trump's #UNGA speech. https://t.co/G97nMsyhRx
Trump said he US would not tell world how to live, work or worship, then later calls on nations to "resist socialism and the misery it brings to everyone."
Trump's few ad libs during UN speech sound like he comes upon a line in a speech someone else wrote and he is not familiar with and then adds his own reaction for emphasis. "OPEC nations are ripping off the world." Pauses and adds: "I don‚Äôt like it, nobody should like it."
Trump again at odds with himself: "I have great respect and admiration for my friend, President Xi. But I've made clear China's market distortions and way they deal cannot be tolerated."
@ishaantharoor he got mocked in the room for his first sentence. seemed to deflate him
Trump called Iranian leader Rouhani a "lovely man" on Twitter this morning then spent 5-6 paragraphs of UN speech just eviscerating the regime in Tehran. #UNGA
Trump hammering Iran: "Every solution to the humanitarian crisis in Syrian must have a strategy to address the brutal regime that has fueled and financed it -- the corrupt dictatorship in Iran. They sow chaos, death and destruction." #UNGA
Trump calls for end to Syrian military conflict through political process that respects will of people, warns US will respond if Assad uses chemical weapons. #UNGA
Trump also thanks by name SK's Moon, Japan's Abe and China's Xi for efforts on North Korea.
Trump on UN stage: "I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and the steps he has made." #UNGA
Trump on overall theme of his UN speech: "The U.S. will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control and domination." #UNGA
Trump: "In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than any administration in the history of our country." Audience of world leaders laughs audibly. Trump says: "I didn't expect that reaction but that's okay." #UNGA
Here is what Trump just said about Iran and what Iranian leader Rouhani said to CNN about whether he ever asked Trump for a meeting. https://t.co/pRN8ubW3hc
Live video feed appears to show Trump ran into Macron on the way into UN speech. (they had a bilat last night)
More Trump: "Venezuela is a very sad case. We want to see it fixed. What‚Äôs happening there is a human tragedy."
Trump talking to reporters as he arrives at UN: Says Iran "has to change its tune before I meet with them. They want to meet. It will happen. I believe they have no choice. We look forward to having a great relationship with Iran but it won‚Äôt happen now."

Trump's #UNGA speech is set for 10:15 EST Tuesday.
At UNGA, Trump's aides said the president aimed to promote "American sovereignty"  -- the idea that the U.S. will handle its affairs without impositions from foreign nations. But the backdrop was a White House struggling to manage its own chaos. w/@agearan https://t.co/2x4KT5ez7s https://t.co/KwwmCyZdxq

@EmyParham There are very few women and racial minorities in the highest ranks of this administration. It's not a coincidence. It was built that way on purpose. That's the issue.
@EmyParham in fact, I'm working on (another) story about it.  stay tuned. Here's one from last year  https://t.co/yXUZSSu30S
@EmyParham It's just a fact, for one thing. Also, there's a point of view that diversity is worthwhile because women, and racial minorities, might offer valuable expertise and points of view for the federal government. This administration does not have many at high ranks. Worth reporting.
Trump again calls Kavanaugh an "outstanding person" and adds: "Hopefully, he'll get confirmed quickly."

. @Rachel_Chason spoke to Trump supporters at his rally in Springfield, Mo., about the allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh https://t.co/WbEYeLhqsF https://t.co/PGxfC8fIuj
Here's a paragraph of scene from Trump's rally in Springfield, Mo., sent in from our reporter at the event @Rachel_Chason https://t.co/Z79MOqgP0n
Springfield, Mo., seech runs nearly 70 minutes and Potus didn't even recite a list of accomplishments from pieces of paper as he did last night in Las Vegas. Trump seemed energized by very enthusiastic crowd.
Trump is winding up his speech with some flowery teleprompter prose about the nation's courageous forebears when he goes into an ad lib and calls his election "maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country."
Trump just crossed the one-hour mark at his rally and proudly announces "Space Force" --drawing a big cheer.
There's a little kid dressed like Trump in the crowd behind him. https://t.co/BxXyBJRvDD
Trump is boasting at the rally that he just ignored a bunch of calls from "kings, queens, presidents, prime ministers, dictators" who didn't want him to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. "I just didn't take their calls. I said, 'call them back in a week.'"
In Missouri, Trump touts a record number of immigrant families trying to cross the border illegally as a victory even though it shows his efforts to stop illegal immigration have failed. "We took in and arrested more illegals coming across .. than we've ever done before!"
Trump appears to be wistful he can't roundup Antifa: "I would never suggest this, but I will tell you, oy, they‚Äôre so lucky that we‚Äôre peaceful."
Trump gets to the point: "Get out in 2018 because you‚Äôre voting for me in 2018."
Trump: "Look what's being exposed at the Department of Justice and the FBI ... You have some real bad ones. You see what's happening at the FBI -- they‚Äôre all gone, they‚Äôre all gone. But there‚Äôs a lingering stench and we‚Äôre going to get rid of that too. "
Trump on Kavanaugh: "Talk about central casting. He was born for the Supreme Court."
Senate candidate @HawleyMO touts Trump for nominating "pro-Constitution judges to the Supreme Court. Judges who love the Constitution. Judges who love our country. Judges like Brett Kavanaugh."
Big "CNN Sucks!" chant from Springfield, Mo., crowd. "You're right," Trump tells them.

Trump is reading off four pages of what he says are his administration's accomplishments. https://t.co/vFbsvGu6jb
Four days before he participates in the United Nations General Assembly gathering of world leaders, Trump tells Vegas crowd of 2016: "The American people voted to reject this corrupt globalism. Hey, I'm the president of the United States. I‚Äôm not the president of the globe."
Trump really trying to tie press corps to the Democrats. "That's their best partner. Without them, they wouldn‚Äôt be getting 5 percent of the vote."
This crowd is quick off the mark with all the chants, "Lock her up!" "Build that wall!" "CNN sucks!" ...
Crowd again chants "Lock her up!" Trump then asks, "How is our Justice Department doing?" Crowd boos.
Apropos of nothing, I happen to be watching Trump's rally on a Fox News feed on YouTube and there's one of those live message boards and people are using little mushroom emojis in some of their comments about Trump.

@shearm i'm looking back at youtube feed and see only one Polish Press Agency reporter getting a question, first for Trump and then same reporter for Duda?
There are so many things to ask Trump about. But among the topics not asked was Trump's reaction to @moonriver365's visit to Pyongyang and when/where Trump expects to meet Kim Jong Un next given WH saying they have begun talks for second summit.
FTR, normally when foreign leaders visit the WH both sides get two questions, known as a 2-and-2. But today was a rare (unprecedented?) 2-and-1, with Trump just wrapping it up after the U.S. side's second question and failing to offer Polish side a second chance.
Trump on trade war with China: "Our market is up like a rocket ship. I don't want their market to go down but their market is down 32 percent."
Polish pres Duda says he talked to Trump about a new US military base in Poland called "Fort Trump." Trump reacted by pursing his lips and nodding. https://t.co/h5aM2GiJwk

@ngjennings yes! a hard copy! I should probably scan it...
I submitted it to @geneweingarten when he ran Sunday Style and the old "Noted With" essays. He considered it a few days but I heard back that it was too navel-gazing about WaPo and that i could just solve it by telling Woodward. I still have a printout in my attic somewhere.
Except that Woodward, of course, was at the center of it. And that my mind was now playing tricks on me. And maybe my dad, who had been in the military at the Pentagon in the mid-70s, did know Woodward after all. Yes, the kicker was that ... my dad was Deepthroat.
He seemed to think he new my dad but no matter what I told him it didn't seem to phase him. So it got worse and worse and it became harder to get out of it. So I wrote an essay that I was caught in a Washington web of intrigue-- coded words in hallways--only Woodward could solve.
True fact: The best story I ever wrote was never published. It was in mid-90s and Woodward started chatting with me every time we crossed paths and I realized at some point he mistook me for someone else and, as a newbie, I was too intimidated to correct him. https://t.co/eZwvzRK17G

Mark Merritt, a Clinton-era FEMA official now consulting for Puerto Rico government, said Trump is right that PR was a lot more challenging than Texas or Florida but that Potus got caught up in the moment and treated it like a campaign rally. ‚ÄúIt did more damage than good.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur sense was that it was a good trip, the president did well, and a lot of the coverage was unfair,‚Äù said one former administration official told my colleague @AshleyRParker. The paper towel moment ‚Äúwas relatively minor and the media exploited it.‚Äù
I spoke with chef @chefjoseandres today. Of Trump‚Äôs towel tossing, he said: ‚ÄúOne could argue it was nothing but then you could argue it was everything. It showed such a lack of empathy.‚Äù Some WH aides grimaced at it but others saw it as gallows humor that went over well in room.
At airport hangar in San Juan, Energy Sec. Rick Perry ‚Äúbro‚Äôd it up‚Äù with Gov. Rossello, who had been supportive of Trump, per pool report. They exchanged ‚Äúa half-hug and a pound as well as a big ole handshake.‚Äù Trump marveled that Rossello was a Democrat who supported him.
Trump went to San Juan two days after the Las Vegas massacre of 58 people. On South Lawn w/@flotus, Trump responded to questions from reporters about both issues. He called mass-shooting a ‚Äútragedy.‚Äù On PR, he declared victory in feud with a local mayor and gave his team an A+
The pool reporter called it a ‚Äúsurreal scene‚Äù and said Trump was doing his ‚Äúbest Stephen Curry impersonation‚Äù as he shot the rolls into the crowd. The pooler said the crowd ‚Äúenjoyed‚Äù it. People cheered, took photos and strained to shake Trump‚Äôs hand.
I spent today reading pool reports from Oct. 3, 2017, and watching videos of Trump‚Äôs paper towel toss in San Juan. He threw 6 rolls in 20 seconds, during which he also managed to pose for a selfie with a man in front row.  https://t.co/MAqJwphwcu
I asked a Puerto Rico resident what he thought of Trump throwing paper towels to Maria victims. He thought Trump‚Äôs message was: ‚ÄúIf you want to cry, dry your tears with this.‚Äù https://t.co/MAqJwphwcu

Immigrant rights groups say there is no "crisis" b/c overall border numbers are historically low and they accuse Trump of fanning fears. But the rising numbers of families and unaccompanied children in recent years vexed Obama and now Trump: https://t.co/nQLh1U72cl https://t.co/N5jV1V9vcz
Most of the sprinting I've done on WH beat was from the press van to catch up to Obama, a dozen cars ahead, doing an unannounced stop at a diner, pumpkin stand, or boutique shop. Trump doesn't really do this sort of thing so fewer chances these days. https://t.co/OJ07jYhpjx
So far, with a month to go in FY18, nearly 91,000 family members have been arrested crossing the southwest border illegally. In 2016, there were 77,700 -- the highest number under Obama.
Whoa, more evidence of what I wrote about last month -- despite all the rhetoric, Trump has struggled to deal with illegal immigration and is having trouble touting progress (on border numbers, wall, deportations) ahead of midterms: https://t.co/URY4Ae6oAd https://t.co/5nw8GPuOGF

You know what would be an entertaining e-book -- a collection of all the debriefs about Trump's presidency. Here's @AshleyRParker on how, to Trump, "the presidency is not about consolation or inspiration but has the production values of an infomercial." https://t.co/0gsCmLWpRE
@dmartosko as someone who played soccer thru high school I definitely appreciate it but you're probably right. maybe unforced errors (tennis?)  would work or for an American football crowd something like "false starts" or "fumbles," but those don't really have the same meaning.
@flaneurie @LaurenSFPhilly Thanks for reading. I loved Hiroshima, for the history and the livability. All the Japanese in DC were inevitably from Tokyo and would kind of talk about Hiroshima as a backwater. Then I spent a year in Tokyo and returned to visit Hiroshima and was stunned how small it seemed.

@dmartosko Soccer, er football, metaphor‚Äîlove it!
@LukeRussert It is a speech that is worth rereading for the poetry of it and, yes, the message of the horrors of war and nuclear weapons and the theme of reconciliation. But even as he spoke it there was a sense it was not realistic and discordant over the actual direction of global affairs.
Post-postscript: in 2016, Obama became the first president to visit Hiroshima. I was in the travel pool that day, riding in the presidential motorcade through the city to Peace Park. I think my year there helped me better understand why the Japanese had yearned for that moment.
Postscript: in 2010, my editors asked if I would do a tour in Afghanistan. I had not pursued the job but I decided to do it because it was a part of the 9/11 story and I wanted to do my part as so many of my colleagues had.
...and taught me and helped me grow. I think I made the right decision by taking the chance, even though sometimes I still wonder if I kind of ran away from the biggest story of my life.
When I got back to DC, I was definitely a change man. I don‚Äôt mean politically or morally but just more worldly. I missed out on what it was like in the US in that year when so much changed. But I saw it through the eyes of our closest foreign allies, in ways that surprised me...
It hurt to hear these things and I usually tried to explain what I had seen in the days before I left for Hiroshima. But over time I just tried to listen more and understand their point of view. Hiroshima‚Äôs legacy from 1945 is a powerful one, palpable still today in Peace Park.
Many I spoke to said they loved America and Americans and fully supported us but they expressed some misgivings about how the United States would respond militarily. Though I left by summer 2002, some Japanese were predicting Bush would pursue a war in Iraq.
I would get angry and argue with them but eventually the rawness of the moment faded against the bustle of our daily lives. But the local Japanese, too, had a view that challenged my assumptions. Theirs was revealed more quietly and slowly but clearly.
Not just the invasion of Afghanistan but I also remember saying a few words during a makeshift Thanksgiving about appreciating our blessings. They responded by criticizing a Hollywood fundraiser featuring Jim Carrey et al: ‚ÄòJust like America to make it about celebrities.‚Äô
There were teachers from Britain and Scotland and Australia and other English-speaking countries. They had arrived in Japan far earlier than I and had seen the coverage of 9/11 from afar. By the time I arrived some were cynical about the American response.
When I arrived in Hiroshima, the Peace City, which knows of horrifying trauma of war, my emotions were raw. I had seen military numbers on the streets of DC and pancaked, ash-covered cars in NYC. What shocked me, though, was the attitudes of some other English teachers.
I asked @JETProgram for a delay of two more weeks to decide if I would follow through on my commitment. It would be difficult to leave the U.S. and family and life here at that moment but in the end, I decided to go ahead and do it.
I was supposed to leave for Japan at the end of the week so I took a train to New York to see her. I was there three days after the Towers fell and saw the devestation of downtown but also the camaraderie and goodwill and group spirit that pervaded NYC in the midst of the crisis.
My girlfriend at the time, also a reporter, was in NYC covering Fashion Week for her paper. She was immediately redirected into coverage of the terror attack by her editors. I couldn‚Äôt reach her by phone but saw her in the background during a live shot on one of the TV networks.
I was in my DC apartment the next morning packing when the planes struck the Twin Towers and Pentagon. It was the biggest story of my generation and I was a journalist w/o a paper. After watching coverage for hours I went outside in a daze and saw a colleague rushing to a mosque.
In summer 2001, I asked my bosses @washingtonpost if I could take a year leave to teach English in Japan. I had applied to @JETProgram and was offered a late spot in Hiroshima. My editors said yes. I signed a letter stipulating the terms. We agreed my leave would start Sept. 10.

When will Trump, who is fundraising in North Dakota today, find out about these Obama remarks and when will the tweet storm come?
Obama on author of NYT op-ed: "That's not how our democracy is supposed to work. These people aren't elected...They're not doing us a favor by actively promoting 90 percent of the crazy stuff coming out of this WH and saying, Don't worry we're preventing the other 10 percent."
Obama says the modern GOP is not what Lincoln "had in mind when he formed the Republican Party. It sure isn't normal. It's radical."
Obama: "Sometimes we hear 'a pox on both your houses' but ... over the past few decades, the politics of division and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party."
Obama: "Appealing to tribe, appealing to fear ... That's an old playbook, as old as time. And in a healthy democracy, it doesn't work."
Obama on economy: "Let's remember when this recovery started. I'm glad it has continued."
In Illinois speech, Obama says: "It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause. He is just capitalizing on resentments our politicians have fanned for years." This comes as Trump tells reporters on AF1 he wants Jeff Sessions to investigate author of NYT op-ed

Trump riff on NYT anonymous op-ed: "Nobody knows who the hell he is. Or she. But they said he. But probably that‚Äôs a little disguise."
Trump telling a story about how he had six people in the Oval talking about Canadian trade talks and he asked his aides what the cable tv pundits were saying unfairly about him on TV.
Trump goes from Kim Jong Un summit, to talking about Putin meeting and complaining about his press coverage. "The truth is, with these people, you can't win. But we're winning. I'm president." Then finally gets back to telepromter speech, reading a few lines attacking Jon Tester.
Trump says he gets along with Kim. On denuclearization, he says: "I think something‚Äôs going to happen. Take your time."
Trump: "I was just told Kim Jong Un said terrific things about me."
Trump still holding a grudge against conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, who died two months ago. Tells crowd Krauthammer questioned why Trump ran for president against a stellar field of GOP candidates in 2016.
Trump having trouble finishing his point about Tester and Ronny Jackson, at one point just blurts: "Do we love Sean Hannity?" Crowd cheers.
In the middle of this, Trump went on a tangent about how he likes books written by allies Judge Jeanine Pirro and Dan Bongino, former Secret Service agent turned conservative pundit. "The media doesn't talk about those books."
Trump hits Dem. Senator Jon for treatment of Adm. Ronny Jackson, the former WH doctor who Trump nominated to lead the VA but withdrew amid questions raised by colleagues over his professional conduct.
GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale comes to stage and pledges to "stick with president Trump" to advance his agenda -- cites repealing Obamacare, protecting public land and "fighting liberals trying to grab your guns." Touts NRA endorsement, promises to "build that wall."

‚ÄòGutless‚Äô is the WH‚Äôs go-to adjective on this one. Potus, Vpotus and @PressSec have all used it. https://t.co/i5rfUtyES3
The WH added the "pool spray" (photo-op) to the Potus public guidance around 11 a.m. today (somewhat unusual). Appeared to be a presidential drop by to a pre-scheduled meeting of sheriffs and other WH officials. Then Potus was able to exploit the moment to react to NYT.
I wrote after the live Pena-Nieto call about Trump's need to conscript everyone around him in service of the reality-show spectacle of his presidency https://t.co/L8YG0yMzFf These sheriffs seem more willing to play the straight man but surely had no idea they'd be used like this. https://t.co/UtSdaLDCD7
Sarah Sanders statement on anonymous NYT op-ed leads with Trump winning 62 million votes, 306 in Electoral College, then goes on to call the op-ed "gutless, anonymous" just as Trump did in East Room. Sounds like Trump dictated at least some of the statement to her.

Trump hits Dems who opposed ICE: "They have no courage, they have no guts. They just have big, loud mouths. We don‚Äôt want to put up with that. I just want to know you are loved and respected."
Fox and MSNBC have both cut away from Trump's event as he continues talking.
Trump says the amount of crimes by immigrants and threats to ICE/CBP  that is reported on in newspapers and on TV is "nothing compared to what it really is."
Not surprisingly, Trump's event on ICE/CBP is heavy on painting undocumented immigrants as criminals, mentions "Operation Matador" against MS-13, hails four fallen border patrol agents and asks families to stand.
Trump's penchant for unexpectedly calling up people at his rallies and events to offer first-hand testimony (and some praise of him) is interesting. https://t.co/aqlni6Cmme

@brianpklein Lot of question about whether he's just sounding off to distract, etc. but @BonnieGlaser told me prevailing view in Beijing is Trump doesn't really want a trade deal but wants to fundamentally weaken China. He and his aides used the word "China" 26 times in the Cabinet meeting.
In the past week, Trump cited China as justification for ‚ÄúSpace Force‚Äù, warned Beijing could meddle in elections, blamed China for easing N. Korea sanctions, asserted China has flooded the U.S. w/opioids, and gloated over China's 'terrible' economy. https://t.co/2naNRKvlek

For Trump to attack local governance as an excuse for his terminated military parade is a particularly low blow for a city that has worked to shed its ‚Äò90s reputation for mismanagement and corruption.
The question of whether a president would use the Taxation Without Representation license plates on the limo had been viewed as a litmus test: Clinton put them on The Beast, GWB removed them, Obama put them back in second term. Trump uses them but might not even know.
The animus/resentment between federal Washington and local DC has persisted for decades given lack of voting rights and especially since the federal control board era in the ‚Äò90s.

Here's one you might like, which holds Josh Earnest to account on his first day for failing to read out an Obama call to Putin (and, like Spicer, noted that he sought to change up order of questions). I got a 20 min angry call from a WH aide on this one https://t.co/OvvWYSn8FW https://t.co/n00w7CE5RJ
Who is the "we've" in this statement? https://t.co/PZjdRQk2hQ
I was thinking about Spicer's other point here that the WH press briefing was like a cabal run by the @AP which traditionally got the first question. That was b/c AP serves the widest audience--domestically and abroad. Calling them first was viewed as an endorsement of democracy.
Philippines Pres. Duterte never accepted Trump's invite to visit the White House last year https://t.co/ZwY3xrRUiB, even though Trump met with him in Manila. (Obama canceled scheduled meetings with Putin in 13 and Duterte in '16) https://t.co/RjzKalAtHX

@Mark_Kawada I'm curious whether knowing the woman was Asian American would have changed the meaning of the photo for viewers over the past 50 years?
@KatCapps The initial story framed it as a photo whose power came from the idealistic and youthful spirit of the two, so maybe it wasn't considered relevant. But their perceived racial juxtaposition had to have some bearing in the power of the photo.
I have a white mother and Asian-American father. I identify as Asian and am viewed as such by others. In the photo, she has been white for 50 years, but in real life...? Maybe it doesn't matter. But her being white is what presumably gives the photo some of its evocative power.
Turns out, she's the daughter of a French woman and a Chinese Hawaiian man who grew up in Hawaii and was raised by her Chinese grandparents. So...is she white or Asian? How does she self-identify and how was she viewed by others -- growing up, in 1968, and now?
The story concerns a photograph from a demonstration in Washington of an anonymous white woman and black man dancing in the Reflecting Pool and the photographers search, 50 years later, to find them. The mystery is half-solved when the woman reads a WaPo account and come forward.
This story from @RoigFranzia is fascinating, for a lot of reasons, including the question of race that jumped out at me, but is not addressed in the piece (or by the protagonists). https://t.co/d4JSV9R8m6

Telling that, even as he makes some ad libs, Trump reading off a prepared statement/notes as he tries to walk back Helsinki damage.
Trump struggles with punctuation in his statements and they don't come out quite as he might have intended. Of NATO, he just asserted he convinced members to boost spending and then added: "When I left, everybody was thrilled."
No, his walk-back doesn't mean anything ... except to demonstrate he believes the blowback over his performance in Helsinki could hurt him politically. https://t.co/k5mXMOehCi

Asked by @PhilipRucker about Trump's "harsh words" on G7 nations, Pompeo downplays it: "There are always irritants in relationships. I'm confident that the relations between our country and the G7 countries will move forward on a strong basis."
Pompeo says the Trump-Kim summit will "set the framework for the hard work to follow" in negotiations to come. "There are only two people that can make decisions of this magnitude and those two people will be sitting in a room tomorrow."
Pompeo directly counters NYT report on administration's lack of technical expertise on nuclear issues, says interagency working group of 100 experts has been meeting regularly. Any suggestion otherwise "is mistaken."
Trump spoke to both South Korean President Moon and Japanese PM Abe, Pompeo says.

Taking final question in Quebec before boarding AF1 to Singapore, Trump attacks the press corps as "unbelievable dishonest. ... I came up with the term, 'Fake news.'" Then adds to reporters: "Thank you very much. I appreciate it."
Trump says he'll know quickly if he can do a deal with Kim Jong Un, the leader of world's most opaque authoritarian regime. "Within the first minute I‚Äôll know. My touch, my feel. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do."
Trump says of Kim Jong Un: "I think he‚Äôs going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside." Says his team already working well with North Koreans in "Shanghai" before correcting himself and saying, "Singapore."
"You can tell that to your fake friends at CNN," Trump said, boasting that his relationship with G7 leaders is a "10."
"Fake news CNN, the worst," Trump says on foreign soil, in Quebec, after complaining about a reporter's question about his poor relationship with G7 leaders.
Trump blames Obama for letting Russia invade Crimea. "He was the one who let Crimea get away." Trump also has blamed Obama and other past presidents for allowing North Korea to get nukes.
Trump extols the historic nature of his North Korea summit, says Kim Jong Un should seize the moment: "It‚Äôs a onetime shot."

WH official says Trump did not speak personally today to leaders of South Korea and Japan, altho Potus had indicated he had. Aide said dialogue was "just below" the presidential level.
Asked why South Koreans said two days ago there was 99.9 percent chance summit would happen, WH official says Trump explained to Moon at WH "some things they may not have been aware of." But Trump had spoken to Moon by phone last Sat night and explained those things.
WH official says aides briefed Trump on NK statements last night. "He took it in stride, he slept on it." This morning he spoke with nat sec team, incl VP, CoS, Pompeo and Bolton and then dictated letter to Kim.
WH official said NK statement last night included "implicit threat" over nuclear showdown and added "the president sought to remind North Korea of the real balance of power here."
WH official says North Korea's statement last night was the first communication in a week from Pyongyang.
WH official said administration has negotiated in good faith but Pyongyang has offered "a trail of broken promises that gave us pause."
WH official says Trump dictated "every word" of  letter to Kim Jong Un.

Trump says he's got this: "In the end it will work out. I can't tell you how or why, but it always does."
By contrast, Trump calls Moon "a very capable person," an "extremely competent man," and a "very good person."
Moon really laying it on thick with Trump, saying he's the one "in charge," praising his "peace through strength" vision and saying he has "every confidence" Trump can "achieve a historic feat" by ending Korean war and denuclearizing the North.
Trump said he's not happy with China appearing to influence Kim Jong Un to a more hardline position then puts Moon Jae-in on the spot by asking his opinion in front of reporters, adds with a grin:  "I don't want to get him in trouble. He lives right next to China."

There were coins produced and paid for for Trump's planned trip to two South American countries last month -- a trip he ended up canceling, purportedly to stay in Washington to monitor response to Syria gas attack.
This has been true for past administrations as well. They are distributed to U.S. government officials involved in the "advance planning" of Potus trips as mementos for their hard work. On Trump's 5-nation trip to Asia last year, there were 5 DIFFERENT coins, one for each country
I'd heard about the North Korea summit coin a few weeks back and was surprised. But I spoke with someone involved in the production who explained that such coins are minted by the WH military office and WH communications agency for all Potus foreign trips. 2/

As @VictorDCha told me, NK wants normalized relations with outside world. Hard for U.S. to get there without addressing human rights, NK labor camps, so might as well get it on the table at the outset.
Trump promised Japan PM Abe at Mar-a-Lago last month that he would raise cases of Japanese abductees. Otto Warmbier's family has sued North Korea. But already equivocations from the administration. https://t.co/F0amcwksrW
I didn't mention it in my story today but Singapore in 2005 was an original member, along with Brunei, New Zealand and Chile, of what became the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which of course Trump torpedoed U.S. support for on third day in office. https://t.co/J4vWdKG7KF
WH says Trump spoke with Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong to thank him for being willing to host the US-North Korea summit. The two reaffirmed what the WH calls "one of the United States' closest partnerships in Asia."
Reports from South Korean activists were that these men were moved from labor camps to "reeducation" facilities in Pyongyang ahead of release. So they were already coached by the North Koreans, one presumes. Very unsettling, all of it. The man spoke thru interpreter, VERY softly. https://t.co/PRjcGCltoB
But I found the whole thing a bit uncomfortable. They guys were released 20 hours earlier after more than a year each in captivity. Pence later said one of the men hadn't seen daylight during detention. Then they get off plane to dozens of media, cameras, floodlights, etc.
Full disclosure: I was there at Joint Base Andrews and I was shouting to the three Americans questions such as "how were you treated?" which Trump encouraged one, Kim Dong Chul to answer. He said he had to do hard labor but also got medical attention.
My colleague who traveled to Pyongyang with Pompeo says reporters were not allowed to speak with freed Americans to respect privacy. But first thing Trump did on their arrival was trot them over to talk to media and listen to him boast about TV ratings.  https://t.co/0Jp0wt9LMT

Singapore has a track record for sensitive third-country diplomacy leading up to Trump-Kim. In 2015, S'pore hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, the first meeting between those nations in seven years. https://t.co/1V8jopM8Ad
Great pic... https://t.co/3uXkwRvFPr
South Koreans had hoped Trump-Kim would be in demilitarized zone in part so they could have a Trump-Moon meeting right after. Won't happen with summit in Singapore. But maybe better for U.S. not to have direct pressure from Seoul.

I'm starting to keep a tally of how administration officials refer to Kim Jong Un. Pompeo has been referring to him as "Chairman," Sarah Sanders calls him "leader", Trump has been just using "Kim Jong Un" on Twitter.

Acosta: "Does the president still believe that torture works as he said on the campaign trail?"	Sarah Sanders: "I haven't had a conversation with him about that recently."
Flotus and Pence will also be at Joint Base Andrews at 2 a.m. with Trump to welcome back the three Americans from North Korea.

@feline_cannon Japan still seeking answers on 13 unaccounted for citizens abducted in 70s and 80s... South Korea has a lot more than that.
Sarah Sanders statement: Potus "appreciates leader Kim Jong Un‚Äôs action to release these American citizens, and views this as a positive gesture of goodwill." Says the Americans appear in "good condition," all able to walk on plane w/o assistance.
Pompeo brought two American reporters with him -- Matt Lee of AP and Carol Morello of Wash Post. They pushed for more (incl. TV, radio). But at least Pompeo had some unlike Tillerson trip to China, when he brought one hand-picked reporter under embargo not to publish until end. https://t.co/J3xy5nlfG6
The Americans flew out of Pyongyang with Pompeo less than an hour after their return to U.S. custody, seated with medical personnel on the plane, which has now landed at Yokota Air Base in Japan.
State dept pool: North Korean official calls the release of the 3 Americans "granting amnesty" (for bogus charges). Tells Pompeo; "You should make care that they do not make the same mistakes again."

It's amazing the Trump administration disclosed this Pompeo trip to NK with so little apparent certainty of the outcomes. Doesn't know who he meets with, if prisoners are freed, how long he'll be there. Makes it look like Kim Jong Un is calling the shots.
Obama emphasizes the multilateralism of Iran deal. Trump appeared to try to use Pompeo's trip to NK to blunt criticism that he turned back on allies by stating the U.S. with help of "China and South Korea and Japan" will achieve "a future of great prosperity and security" in Asia https://t.co/M2fsI5fI4Y
Yes. This is the danger of Trump, Rudy et al talking so publicly last week about the prisoners being released soon -- ramps up their value to NK. WH raised expectations and it will look like US being played if Pompeo leaves without them a second time.  https://t.co/IFrqAot2H4 https://t.co/JifzhagpPP
FYI: the two pool reporters with Pompeo are @CMorelloWP and @APDiploWriter. No TV or radio reporters. Pompeo left Joint Base Andrews late Monday night on unannounced trip; reporters were not allowed to report it until after Trump's WH speech and Pompeo landing in Japn for refuel.
Pompeo also said no deal has been made to free 3 American prisoners, despite Trump hinting last week their release is imminent: "We've been asking for the release of these detainees for 17 months. We'll talk about it again. It'd be a great gesture if they'd agree to do so."
Pompeo told pool reporters on his plane headed to North Korea that he doesn't know who he will meet with in Pyongyang: "We're prepared to meet anyone who can speak on behalf of the North Korean government and give us solid answers so we're prepared. "
Trump says Pompeo is headed to North Korea to continue preparations for the summit, but he makes no mention of the three American prisoners.
WH says Trump spoke with Xi Jinping to discuss Xi's second meeting with Kim Jong Un. Trump and Xi "agreed on the importance of continued implementation of sanctions on North Korea until it permanently dismantles its nuclear and missile programs."
Also in this story: analysts are wondering if summit prep for Trump-Kim has hit snag given lack of details. Trump said Fri date/location is finalized but sources said that surprised some aides. South Korean media reported it would be Singapore in June but WH declined to confirm.

Also worth noting that, contrary to Trump's tweet, two of the Americans were detained in the North since he took office, not during the past administration. Here's a good piece on the three from @annafifield https://t.co/cHKy1lSxSr
It's certainly possible it will happen today or soon or by the summit. That would be great news. But so far I've not seen any credible reporting that the North is on the precipice. More than a month ago, South Korean press was rife with reports of an imminent release.
By last evening, Trump tweeted to "stay tuned" https://t.co/dmEK1zVhFy And Giuliani this morning said it would happen today https://t.co/06aKxro05S
At that point yesterday I spoke with a senior administration official who was aware of what the South Korean advocates had said but told me administration had heard nothing from North Korea and South Korean gov had no direct word from Pyongyang either. https://t.co/T6kgonqUn3
Drudge Report tweeted the Business Insider "story" https://t.co/9IZkn2k8GJ
Other outlets aggregated this story, including Business Insider, which termed it "another big win" for Trump in the headline.  https://t.co/pxElXClHQy
The story's sources are three "campaigners" from South Korea who advocate on behalf of South Koreans abducted by North Korea. Those sources quote anonymous NK sources and said Trump can get hostages back on day of summit with Kim Jong Un or maybe send envoy for them earlier.
Quick thread about how this North Korea-releasing-hostages news seems to have, um, blossomed into a story in which Rudy Giuliani is saying they'll be released today (caveat: I hope he's right and they're released). It seems to have started w/this FT story https://t.co/MLI4nt1axg https://t.co/zcqsXHUZe4
The fact that we're asking the WH about Giuliani's comments on Trump and Cohen is remarkable, but perhaps even more so is that we're asking WH about Giuliani's "role" in dealing with North Korea
Sarah Sanders on three U.S. citizens held hostage in North Korea: "We can't confirm the validity of any of the reports currently out about their release. But we would see this as a sign of goodwill if the North Koreans would release the three Americans" before summit.
Asked by @jonkarl about trackrecord of lies and untruths from Trump and WH aides, @Presssec said: "We give the best information we have at the time. I do that every single day."
Sarah Sanders cites U.S. talks with North Korea as a reason Senate should confirm Gina Haspel as CIA director.

@NiranjanAjit @vmsalama Here's some of that chain: https://t.co/yPP5Wq7AEm
@NiranjanAjit @vmsalama You might have seen it but there was an amazing day on Twitter -- it might have been the day of the Trump story or perhaps some time after -- when many Twitter users were all tweeting their crazy stories of being asked "where you from?"
@NiranjanAjit @vmsalama I'd say yes but I think that might be in part because I'm older, married, interact with fewer people than before than as a young, singleton. Though my essay also happened to be about being asked by other racial minorities, which kind of flips the script.

i asked about the discrepancy from literally the night before. Didn't get a very clear answer. So either Kelly was confused or there was an internal fight overnight and the WH adjusted/changed what had been planned to make the plan (a little) more lenient.
Not sure Graham/Durbin used those figures, but Kelly canceled backgrounder that night as reporters filed on Trump's remarks. The next day, WH briefed on Trump plans and said, in fact, that 1.8 million dreamers would eligible for citizenship (entire population eligible)
Trump told reporters he was open to path to citizenship for DACA dreamers. When he left, Kelly indicated it was just for the 690,000 who had enrolled in program "not the 2 million, 4 million, 7 million" that he said Graham/Durbin said were eligible but didn't sign up.
In light of NBC story saying John Kelly told colleagues that Trump doesn't really know what DACA is, I was thinking back to Jan. 24 when Trump dropped by immigration background briefing for reporters by Kelly in his office, as was subsequently reported https://t.co/PBCB2pNsHA
This also means, implicitly, that Kelly blocked Trump from getting his border wall. https://t.co/5UDjU61VgP

But Patrick Cronin, an Asia-Pacific security analyst, tells me that's fine: "This process has momentum. Trump wants to use the theatrics to continue the momentum to see if we have a turning point here. It‚Äôs up to Trump to keep the momentum going to see if diplomacy can work.‚Äù
In eyeing the Korean demilitarized zone as the site for a meeting with Kim Jong Un, Trump is viewing the summit more as an event promoter than as a deal-maker  https://t.co/8tJ7qmdOad https://t.co/cgtrsPCSEc
I was thinking back to the emotional crescendo of Trump's SOTU address in late January when the North Korean defector raising his crutches in the House chambers as Potus railed on Pyongyang's brutality. That's how fast things are moving.
VP Pence said he traveled to DMZ last year so North Koreans could see the "resolve" of the Trump administration in his stare across the border. Now Trump is foreshadowing a "celebration" at the DMZ.
Calling for a possible "celebration" on site seems risky. Any kind of deal with North Korea would require numerous details to be worked out in followup negotiations and years to implement to ensure compliance. https://t.co/BK50fwoHw9
Trump adds the U.S. has "never been closer" to something happening on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula
Trump says US looking at Singapore and DMZ for summit with Kim Jong Un. Calls "Peace House" site "intriguing." "There's something I like about it because you're actually there. If things work out there's a great celebration to be had on the site."
Asked by @Jordanfabian if he asked Trump about the "shithole countries" remarks, Nigerian Pres Buhari replies that he's "very careful" about what press writes about him so the "best thing I can do is keep quiet." Trump jumps in to add they didn't discuss it b/c Buhari "knows me."
Here are some of the photos I took of the suicide bombing aftermath, at the end of this Facebook album from 2010. (I did not post the photo of the severed leg.) https://t.co/a5YTsRDdU1
Which is to say, just because reporters attend the WHCD doesn't mean they don't understand the importance of a free press and of defending our institution from illiberal assaults on it. Many of us have seen the dangers of places where such notions are literally under attack.
The family met with me and brought photos of Hafizullah, one of which was published in the print edition with my story: "Azizi's mother buried her son in the family graveyard near his father, an Afghan soldier who died in battle 17 years earlier."  https://t.co/z9Ya2dTT7x
I asked the fixer to set up interviews with the family of the dead drivers. I thought it would take a week and much trust-building. I was wrong. By the next afternoon I was meeting with family of Hafizullah Azizi, a 22 y/o who financially supported his mother/5 siblings.
This was part of a pattern that revealed a trend: Well-fortified foreign compounds were protected from attacks but ordinary Afghans who worked for them were being slaughtered, creating more distrust and anger amid Obama's surge. I decided to put a face to the numbers.
In my shock, I snapped a photo of it (which of course did not run in the paper). Interviews with people in the area revealed the bombers had killed themselves -- but also two Afghan drivers who worked for the Brits who were waiting outside. None of the Brits was killed.
Bullet pockmarks were visible on the walls of the British compound and windows were blown out. At one point, an investigator came toward the media scrum and tried to shoo us away. But then he stopped, reached down and picked something up. It was a leg, torn off at kneecap.
At some point amid what seemed like chaos, there were so many journalists that we were able to break past the initial police blockade to get a closer view of the scene. A couple bodies, being covered in sheets, were visible. The blast had damaged a security wall and cars nearby.
Journalists began pouring into the area too. At first we were held at bay by authorities around a bend in the road from the attack. Two Taliban insurgents had attacked a well-fortified British security firm, prompting a shootout that ended when the attackers blew themselves up.
They were not from the bombers but from the military/police who responded. So many weapons, AKs but also other rifles mounted atop vehicles. Felt like every time I turned around a weapons was kind of being pointed at me--not intentionally but just because it was hard to avoid.
I heard the blast while returning to our WaPo house/bureau from another assignment. Our fixer told me it was a few blocks away. We jumped in a car and took off to the scene. We were among the first people there. It was very chaotic. The thing I member most were all the guns.
FTR, I attended the #WHCD. But in 2010, working for WaPo, I covered a suicide bombing in Kabul. It was my first week in our bureau there. Suicide bombings were old news in the 9th year of the war. I volunteered to cover it to acclimate myself to the human costs. https://t.co/CULYrx4zPl
Changing the format or scrapping the jokes/roast aspect is fine. Banning cameras seems antithetical for a journalism organization. (Especially if a Potus attends and speaks as they have in past.) https://t.co/ZJr4NnTMpc
The early thinking was that Trump would want something more glitzy than DMZ, especially since it would look like repeat of inter-Korea summit. But the DMZ obviously holds a raw emotive power that a third country would not, as POTUS saw in Moon-Kim moment. https://t.co/iX3mUIVqps

Final note: Adm. Harry Harris, former head of US Pacific Command, is thought to be Pompeo‚Äôs choice to fill long-vacant Ambassador slot in Seoul. I‚Äôm told he‚Äôs also hawkish on North Korea and has in past been more receptive than others to the ‚Äúbloody nose‚Äù military strike idea.
Other experts have called for capping and limiting the North‚Äôs nukes to start with and said only reasonable part to complete denuclearization is over 5 to 10 years or more. Would Trump, ready to blow up Iran deal next month, have patience and vision to set that in motion?
On denuclearization, most expect this to be a lengthy, difficult, rigorous and fretful  process if it is even possible. In Tokyo there has been speculation Trump wants a deal with North to get rid of nukes by 2020 re-election. A Japanese reporter asked Trump about this last week.
The hopeful optimism is that Kim will release the remaining three American hostages around his summit with Trump. Question is whether Trump will give anything in return. Kim wants easing of sanctions but Trump NSC day they‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned from past mistakes‚Äù and will maintain them.

As Cha pointed out, US foreign policy community, Congress and media are likely to be more skeptical or cautious about the current moment. Also, Pompeo and Bolton are North Korea hawks. But Trump, as his morning tweet made clear, wants a historic deal.
Cha said Moon would cast his summit as a victory ‚Äúno matter what happens‚Äù and that conservatives in SK have been completely marginalized by liberal Moon government. Notably we seem to have heard about peace treaty and some general denuclearization talk but nothing on human rights
Moon wants to continue momentum and set stage for a successful Trump-Kim summit. As @VictorDCha, who was in Seoul this week, told me yesterday, mood in SK is ‚Äúparty-like atmosphere‚Äù over potential for breakthrough with the North.
I‚Äôm told discussions are underway for South Korea‚Äôs Moon Jae-in to visit the White House in the next couple weeks to brief Trump on the inter-Korea summit. This will be a very different tone than Shinzo Abe‚Äôs visit to Mar-a-Lago last week. Abe skeptical of Kim Jong Un‚Äôs motives.

These aides can and do assist other WH personnel but their main job is to be ready in case the president needs assistance.
The chief WH doctor flies in on AF1 with the president. Ronny Jackson assumed that role in 2013. Prior to that, he was sometimes among the advance or pre-advance teams. Typically there are WH doctors and nurses from the medical office staffing the president on the trips.
As the Potus trip nears, the 'advance team' begins to arrive about two weeks in advance of president's arrival with it building into hundreds of support officials from the various agencies. The WH med team typicalloy sends reps 5-7 days out.
The pre-advance trips are very brief, in-and-out of each location in a day or two. The one I was on in Mexico was a single night. (Reporters accompany to assess our needs and also to brief those who travel on what to expect. We pay for our own trips.)
The WH medical team is there to assess the level of trauma centers in the foreign country. A POTUS requires high-level trauma surgeons in case of emergency. If a location lacks it, the WH med team arranges alternatives (on some trips, a Navy ship 'floating hospital' is procured).
The WH medical unit sends a representative on the "pre-advance" trip to scout locations months in advance of presidential trip. That person/people fly on a State Dept. plane with other U.S. gov officials, as well as reps from WH press corps. (I went on one such trip to Mexico.)
Having covered the Secret Service's Cartagena scandal in 2012, I learned a lot about POTUS foreign trip operations. Obviously, it's a huge operation, involving USSS, DOD, WH, State, DEA, etc. But I'd never known the role of WH doctor. Short thread on what I learned today.

FWIW, I spoke today to four people who knew and worked with Ronny Jackson--two from GWBush era and two from Obama's first term. Two traveled overseas with him, incl one who estimated 15 trips. All spoke on background. All spoke highly of him, said they never saw him drunk.
(FTR: The additional circumstances of that incident itself later suggested the initial reports were perhaps overblown  https://t.co/EgAYbwLBqg )
I don't know the veracity of these allegations. But as @CarolLeonnig wrote in 2015, two Secret Service agents were investigated after allegedly driving a car into WH security barricades after a goodbye party. But Jackson was not implicated then.  https://t.co/zq0Asy8v5d https://t.co/7XK7ctDIse
I hadn't really thought that would be a consideration and it sort of made the tradition of political wives (spouses) doing soft-power, cultural stuff seem a bit antiquated. He said it's still possible they pose for a picture together.
The diplomat responded that it's not been decided yet but added that one factor was that the summit is in Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, and so there's no good photo-op thing for the wives to do. Nothing cultural like Melania and Brigitte Macron going to the art museum.
I was just talking with a diplomat about the inter-Korea summit between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un on Friday. This person was saying there will be a 'state dinner' and I asked if the wives would attend.

Trump loves to call on Reuters and Fox at formal news conferences.
Trump suggests Senate is trying to block Ronny Jackson's nomination to the head the VA because it failed to block Pompeo. Also says repeatedly he told Jackson, "Why do you need this?" as though he's laying groundwork for Jackson to withdraw
Trump rips Iran deal and ruminates on whether a better deal is possible. Adds: "If Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid."
Trump is asked what "denuclearization" of North Korea means: "It means they get rid of their nukes. It would be very easy for me to make a simple deal and claim victory. I don't want to do that."

@elamison I see that's around July of last year. He'd certainly been on some AF1 flights by then (I rode with him on his first) but not sure how many. Everyone needs to learn the protocols.
From my understanding, if there were an attack on Potus, the counter-assault team (CAT) would lay down heavy cover fire as the 'beast' limo makes a high-speed exit. Counter-snipers positioned on roofs. Tech squad can jam cell service in area. Medical team also in motorcade.
@elamison actually there are two limos, one visible in the video you shared and another in the direction trump walked. In the video Trump shared that I retweeted, you can see both limos. One is for staff.
This video gives a good sense of how close the presidential limos stay to Potus on the tarmac. It's not just for convenience, but for security. An agent usually stands with the door ajar in case of an attack and the need to get him into bulletproof car in emergency. https://t.co/zy2olFhc7j

Reporters goad Trump into answering another question after he tries to end 2-and-2 news conference (two questions aside), asking why he held off on more Russia sanctions.
Trump: "The media has not covered the TPP correctly. I don't want to go back into TPP. But if they offer a deal that is better for the United States, I would do it. But I like bilateral better."
"We will be very loyal to Japan." -- Trump ... Abe is swimming in scandal in Tokyo and hoping some of his gains at this summit can help his low approval ratings. Japanese reporters tell me it hasn't so far.
Trump cuts off Abe, who would traditionally answer first during question from Japanese reporter, says he will work hard on North Korean abduction issue because it's so important to the Japanese. Said Abe showed "unbelievable enthusiasm" on topic at dinner last night.
Trump on Kim Jong Un summit: "If I think it‚Äôs a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we‚Äôre not going to go. If the meeting, when I‚Äôm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting."

@nathanking Yeah, Abe seemed delighted that Trump promised to raise Japanese abductees with Kim, though I have to say that if Trump got the 3 Americans out I doubt he'd insist on resolution in the Japanese cases to give Kim something in return.
The fact that Abe changed his tie might seem superfluous. But to me it speaks to the attentiveness of Japanese diplomats and also to Abe's willingness to play beta to Trump's passive-aggressive alpha, as I wrote last fall https://t.co/xsjdaD8D5T

I was joking to another reporter in WH press pool that if we got a few more photo ops, Trump was liable to tell us everything there was to know about North Korea prep. But the confusion around his latest remarks show the risk of his indiscipline on messaging and at photo-ops.
"Friendship walks" and Trump/Abe are a recipe for misunderstandings. In Tokyo it was the koi pond moment, today it was confusion on whether Trump has spoke/communicated directly with Kim Jong Un (it appears he has not).

Trump and Abe are about to do a ‚Äúfriendship walk‚Äù to dinner at Mar-a-Lago. I was pooler in Tokyowhen their walk ended with false narrative that Trump has offended Abe by dumping a bowl of fish food in koi pond. In fact, Abe had also done so with his fish food, per custom.
He's said this before. And it's true that South Korea's Moon has gone out of his way to praise Trump (as a strategy to get his cooperation). Abe did more of it today, lavishing Trump with praise, esp after getting Trump to promise to raise Japanese abductees with Kim Jong Un. https://t.co/ttsF2FB4zG
@BogusC ha i've been called worse.
He did this last year, too, I think in Pennsylvania, to counter-program. But this year Trump has said he will encourage aides, incl @presssec, to attend the dinner. https://t.co/vOpgczg0df
In any case, I assume that revealing those things was not on Trump's prepared talking points. Abe was very carefully scripted, hitting his marks each time he spoke. Trump hit some talking points, mostly his own: ML is 'winter WH', trade deals bad, Olympics a success b/c of Trump
...Did Potus start talking about it at the 2nd photo-op b/c it was on his mind b/c I had asked? Or because he knew we wanted answers to those questions so he was playing to us? Or because an aide showed him coverage of the first photo-op in-between bilats?
...at the second photo-op, Trump himself raised that they were looking at 5 sites and he also said, unprompted, there were already high-level talks underway between U.S. and North Korea. Which made me wonder...
Kind of interesting: At first Trump-Abe photo-op, I yelled out to Potus as WH aides were pushing us out to ask where his Kim summit would be. Trump responded they were looking at 5 sites. I also yelled out if he had communicated directly with Kim but Trump didn't answer. Then...

One other observation about the U.S. delegation. Pottinger, on far right in pic, took copious notes. But Bolton also took some notes. The other Americans did not.
I asked Trump if any of the five potential sites for the Kim Jong Un summit were in the U.S. ... Potus shook his head and clearly mouthed the word, "No."
Abe hewed closely to his talking points, bringing up the Japanese abductees every chance he could with Potus. Abe was visibly delighted when Trump promised to raise it with Kim and thanked him profusely for his "deep understanding." (Trump met with abductees in Tokyo last Nov.)

Kudlow plays down split in Trump administration on Russia sanctions, says Nikki Haley "got ahead of the curve." He said: "We have a set of sanctions and additional sanctions are under consideration but have not been determined."
I also asked Pottinger to provide some insights into how John Bolton is shaping preparations for summit talks with North Korea. Larry Kudlow cut in to say they'll let Bolton "speak for himself."
I asked if 3 Americans in North Korea will be released as part of summit talks. NSC Asia director Matt Pottinger said the 3 are "on the mind of all Americans serving in this administration right now...It factors very much into future interactions." Won't call it a precondition.

In lunch shifts, patrons are in and out in 20 minutes. In the Abe-Obama meal, they lingered for a couple hours. Jiro just kept sending out more and more sushi and, purportedly, Obama just got full. This is the same guy who purportedly ate 7 almonds a night, per @shearm, after all
That led to a mini-controversy over whether Obama had snubbed his hosts or didn't appreciate fine sushi. But a senior WH official later explained to me that Jiro is a subway station sushi restaurant and in Japan the finest sushi is to be eaten quickly to appreciate the freshness.

It raises the question of whether Trump was not particularly committed to the Summit of the Americas and this trip in the first place and had no interest in being gone as the Mueller investigation tightens.
WH said yesterday Trump would decide on US response w/in 24-48 hours. Seems he could make decision and still keep Thursday evening departure for Lima and monitor from there. He authorized/presided over first Syria strike last April over chocolate cake with Xi in Mar-a-Lago.
Now, Trump. Just days ago he said it was no longer worth it for the U.S. military to remain in Syria given the gains made against ISIS. The chemical attacks by Assad regime are horrifying but not an immediate domestic problem for most Americans.
@MarcBodnick i'm getting there.
Back home, Ted Cruz, Trump and others responded to the Paris attacks by calling for a ban on Muslim immigrants from Syria, elsewhere. Obama reacted angrily from halfway around the world in a debate over American values as I tried to capture here; https://t.co/Txlacbj7BG
In 2015, on the night before Obama was to leave for a trip to Turkey, Philippines and Malaysia, terrorists slaughtered 130 people in Paris. The U.S. presidential election campaign was in full swing. Obama decided to keep his commitments in Asia and left town.
In Oct. 2013, during 16-day gov shutdown, Obama canceled week-long Asia trip. He had committed to visiting Asia for several key summits every year as part of his "pivot to Asia." (He made up the trip in spring 2014.) Xi, Putin showed up as RT noted. https://t.co/2OG9NwtUJn
In 2010, Obama first postponed an Asia trip to stay in town and lobby ahead of the health care vote. Then he canceled outright after the BP oil spill. The first was a huge legislative priority/legacy issue; the second a domestic environmental and management crisis.
There is also the difficult decision to skip out on foreign commitments, multilateral summits, face-to-face bilateral discussions. And if a U.S. president skips, it usually takes up to a year to reschedule -- and he risks being upstaged at the events by rival world leaders.
Presidents travel with their national security advisers and have secure communication equipment at all time to have calls back to Washington and with foreign leaders. Yet there is, of course, the question of 'optics' and how things look if a president is gone at a time of crisis.
I was thinking a little more about presidents canceling foreign trips. On one hand, Syria is a pressing, important and complicated issue. On the other, all White Houses insist that "the office of the presidency" travels wherever the commander-in-chief goes. (Vacation, etc) https://t.co/UDs7rjtjRk

Kim Jong Il was afraid to fly. By contrast, Kim Jong Un has staged photo-ops to suggest that he is a trained pilot. In 2015, NK state media showed him in "Air Force Un" sitting behind a polished wooden desk, on the phone, with a cigarette in his hand.
. @SueMiTerry, a former CIA analyst under GWBush administration, told me: ‚ÄúWe used to make fun of what they have ‚Äî it‚Äôs old stuff. We would joke about their old Soviet planes.‚Äù

Trump was scheduled to leave Thursday for Peru and be done in Colombia by Sunday and head directly to Mar-a-Lago got summit with Shinzo Abe on April 17-18

@seungminkim there's never a slow news day for a "bright" anymore. took a literal snow day for me to publish my story on WH typos.
I spent much of this week reporting a very offbeat story. Given the news flow I have no idea when I'll be able to publish this.
Trump thinks military wars should be quick and decisive and he wants to leave Syria against advice of Pentagon generals. He thinks trade wars are good and easy to win and is escalating one with China against advice of former chief economic adviser.
Trump statement from WH says president is considering $100 billion in additional tariffs in escalating trade war with China.
This retweet constitutes an endorsement. https://t.co/jk3FK2nLuF
@TomJawetz Yeah I wrote about that in my story. But as you know the numbers in Obama's last year were higher than 2014 crisis. Not that it could be fixed in 3 years but the Obama solutions were harshly criticized on the left.
You can pretty much bet that when you're working on a complicated analytical story, Trump will immediately overshadow it by saying or doing something far more flamboyant and ham-fisted, often on the exact same topic.
Today was another classic on the Trump beat. I tried to write a nuanced immigration story and w/in hour of publication Trump says immigrant women are being raped at record numbers with no evidence and then blurts out to 4,000 Nat Guard troops a day after aides said no details yet
@farhip Have a thorough confidence based on significant understanding of someone's work. In Atlantic's case, Goldberg acknowledged in a staff memo that the hire was controversial for the very reason Williamson was later fired.
I tried to explain this in a story today. Trump's National Guard solution is likely misguided. But he does have a very vexing illegal immigration problem that Obama also couldn't fix. https://t.co/85bLSI3TJE https://t.co/eKe2jBilVs
@farhip Right and NYT didn't know about tech columnist who was friendly with a Nazi. These are high-profile decisions and then un-decisions that are damaging to the brands and deserve scrutiny. Yes, we're in era of anyone publishing anywhere so hard to vet. But that's why they make big $
This is all true, but Trump also just can't resist talking to reporters. He took questions on lots of topics and made news on Pruitt, Stormy, Amazon, National Guard (2,000 to 4,000 at border). And unlike Obama he almost always talks on record in AF1 cabin and even allows pics. https://t.co/rHbuhQzVDK
@farhip I'm not necessarily singling out Goldberg. I don't know all the facts. I'm just saying that these decisions need to be scrutinized (not by you, by all of us) as we see this happening. There are many qualified people out there. Due diligence is required to find and hire them.
Another factor was creating a newsroom environment were minority journalists could thrive and succeed, which also was a recurring problem. Those who did stay often burned out or were stunted in their growth. They faced other challenges but didn't get additional support.
My view was: What about the editors who did the hiring in the first place? Many had no idea what to look for or where to look, didn't read minorities or pay enough for the best. Even if they had good intentions, their management skills lacking. That never mattered.
I hold this view in part by what I saw in the fight, esp in the '90s, over diversity in newsrooms. Editors would go out to minority journalist conventions and hire minorities. Some would not, uh, work out. Those who didn't succeed would leave amid backlash to their hiring.
My view is that there is also management question in some cases. Editors are making questionable hiring decisions, which are controversial. Then they are second-guessing themselves after public backlash, which is also controversial. Their judgement should be scrutinized. https://t.co/y1ifwiTvQZ
@TomJawetz I noticed this too - not in the data you're linking to but other numbers I was looking at yesterday. Worth us doing a story on this at some point.

Both sides agree on this. Trump aides want Congress to change laws to offer the women and children fewer protections, speed deportations. Advocates say they‚Äôll keep coming until US and other countries systematically address root cause: gangs, drugs, violence in Northern Triangle.
US policies had long focused on more agents, border barriers and deterrence measures (workplace raids). The new migrants turn themselves in to border patrol and seek asylum and the law allows them due process. Our current policies do not fit the new paradigm, experts say.
However, in recent years ‚Äîsince about 2012‚Äîa subset of migrants crossing illegally has increased significantly: women and children, mostly from three troubled Central American nations. Tho those numbers plummeted shortly after Trump took office, they‚Äôve shot back up over 6 months
Illegal immigration rates, traditionally driven by Mexicans seeking jobs, were far higher in the 90s and have dropped due to better border control and improvements in Mexican economy. Rates of border apprehensions are at longtime lows.
I‚Äôm writing on this today. The messages are contradictory because the issue of illegal immigration is complicated and nuanced and Trump is not a man of nuance. https://t.co/SHH3cjZF3w

DHS stats showed the boom came in spring, which experts said was due to good weather for treacherous journey through Mexico to US border. Trump WH said stats to be released today show spike in March from Jan and Feb. (but numbers were also high in Nov an Dec.)
In 2012 but dramatically in 2013-2016 the rates remained relatively low overall but there was a surge of Central Americans, esp, women and children. Advocates said they were fleeing deteriorating conditions re: gangs, drugs, domestic abuse in Northern Triangle.
In Clinton, Bush eras and Obama first term, overall illegal immigration, which had been driven by economic migrants from Mexico, declined precipitously due to US deterrence efforts and improving Mexican economy. As data shows, it was not clear that such rates spiked in April.
I'm not taking a side on whether the Trump administration is acting in good faith on the National Guard announcement. But some of the discrepancy on whether illegal crossings spike in spring could be related to the shift in the kind of immigrants who are coming in recent years. https://t.co/5DGdB40wLH
From first-class travel to homeless... https://t.co/BMWWRWl9iM
The upshot, most people I talk with say, is that there is no chance Congress will change immigration law in the near term, little WH appetite for long-term strategies and highly unlikely numbers of children and families from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras will abate soon.
Advocates say Trump's hardline approach can't work because the "push factor" from Northern Triangle nations, wracked with gang violence and drug cartels, is worse than any deterrence measures from US. They say only fix is to address root cause -- foreign aid, investment.
Trump aides say illegal immigration dropped after he took office b/c of tough campaign talk but smugglers have adjusted their tactics to better exploit the "loopholes" in immigration laws that only Congress can fix. In meantime, Trump team wants to double down on hardline tactics
Interesting moment in immigration debate right now. Both immigrant rights advocates and Trump administration are in agreement on something: Trump's hardline immigration stance has not really worked over 15 months, esp. with rising influx of Central Americans. They differ on why.
Official also said more executive actions will be coming, suggests administration eyeing more penalties for US families who pay smugglers to bring their children
Senior official says Trump administration will mount public campaign to pass legislation to close immigration "loopholes" and warns that Dems standing in the way "would be extremely unpopular."

Shifting goalposts: Nielsen says admin considers everything they are building "new border wall" b/c replacing existing barriers to make them stronger also counts.
"What he meant was...." -- DHS Sec Nielsen, after being asked about a Trump tweet.
Nielsen says she won't release details, which are still to be worked out with governors in border region.
But experts I've spoken to say changes are due to rising violence, gangs, drugs in Northern Triangle. They note there is not a similar influx from Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua or Belize. Women/children coming over fear, not just economic pull that drove Mexican influx in 90s.
Nielsen is reciting stats that far more undocumented migrants are from Central America, rather than Mexico, and are women/children, not adult males, because human smugglers know those groups have more legal protections and want to exploit the loopholes.
Trump will sign directive to dispatch National Guard troops to border regions, says DHS Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen

No clear need for National Guard. In 2014 when Rick Perry mobilized Texas National Guard it was because surge of migrants overwhelmed border stations which is true. (Though many saw it as political move to upstage Obama.) More capacity from feds added since then.
The thing about the Central American migrant influx is that it has been driven, as Trump admin acknowledges, largely by asylum seekers. They turn themselves in to Border Patrol and then file for asylum and await immigration hearing. The border in these cases isn‚Äôt lawless. https://t.co/KMXLzNCX51

@SchoffJ definitely but a visit to @CIA could be potentially more fruitful.
Trump is wrong here. But he could be referring to DACA, DAPA, sharp reduction on deportations in Obama's final couple years, prosecutorial discretion, refugee cap increase (though modest).

@PatriotMinear * you're *
Not sure I see Trump particularly concerned with 2 or 3 expect that the short-range missiles could strike U.S. forces in the region. But if NK is no longer a direct threat to US a reduction of troops would square with other Potus priorities ('rebuild' U.S., cut foreign aid costs)
. @VictorDCha told me today that PM Abe's three messages to Trump in two weeks will be 1. maintain economic sanctions on Pyongyang; 2. press for elimination of short- and medium-range missiles along with ICBM; 3. press for release of Japanese abductees along with Americans.
Though Bolton and Pompeo would probably oppose it, Trump's position on Syria has me wondering if he would agree to remove/reduce U.S. troops in S. Korea and Japan in exchange for N. Korean elimination of nukes/ICBM, which most analysts say is a terrible idea.
One thing I've noticed is that, like today, Trump sometimes chuckles when he calls the WH press "fake news" as though he knows it's an in-joke, charade simply done for propaganda and that everyone in Washington is in on the joke. Even though we're not.
Not sure what this means but @acosta was speaking on CNN live from East Room when technical difficulties cut off his live feed. Hmm. ...
Trump did his usual: I can have a good relationship with Putin. Or maybe not. Who knows? We'll see... He's nearly 15 months into his presidency and has had a face-to-face meeting with him. We're past the hypothetical stage. What is his relationship like?
Resolved: Pool spray produced a lot more news than did formal joint news conference.

Trump is asking Baltic heads of state to praise his leadership on NATO in one of those cabinet room roundtables that are filmed by news cameras.
Trump says he spoke with Gen. Mattis about "guarding our border with the military" at least "until we have a wall." Adds: "That‚Äôs a big step. We really haven‚Äôt done that before, or certainly so much before."

In some ways it‚Äôs like immigration reform: Path to citizenship v. what cost on border security. On DPRK, denuclearization comes at what cost to other side? Impossible to see how Kim ever feels secure enough to really drop nuke program. No sweet spot exists, no deal ever possible. https://t.co/CalZxOW48f
WH says Chinese informed them of Kim visit (afterward) and Xi also sent a personal message to Trump. Kim is successfully presenting himself as an equal to major power leaders now, his family‚Äôs longtime goal. https://t.co/LuzjEILYpB
Experts I‚Äôve talked to give Trump/admin credit for sanctions and other pressure on North Korea over 14 months. But seems like Kim is taking summit prep more seriously or is certainly more focused on it and has more integrated strategy than Trump. https://t.co/SoGbno7OqA
Romney advocated ‚Äúself-deportation‚Äù for undocumented in ‚Äò12 campaign just as Obama launched DACA. Obama won 70% of Latino, Asian-Am vote prompting RNC‚Äôs Reince Priebus to advocate GOP to support comprehensive immigration reform. Trump obliterated that idea. https://t.co/5Svm6UUg9A

@NeilWMcCabe I get that you are trolling but 1. The Chinese tarmac issue happened months after the Hiroshima trip and 2. It has nothing to do with what I was tweeting and writing about. 3. I‚Äôm not judging whose policies were ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù I‚Äôm just reporting.
@AnnGerhart Yeah I‚Äôm curious
Obama tried to set a tone for Asia-Pacific reconciliation in his final year on trip to Hiroshima. Asian historical grievances more difficult to resolve than Europe‚Äôs. https://t.co/8oj7wlRNEG https://t.co/foYC0O2lTB

This is a good point. May just be the wind over past couple weeks. https://t.co/W6kMCmy2BA
@AndrewBeatty @jeneps i can't really remember Obama using them -- did he during that mixup in Beijing? but other than that... maybe during a hard rain once or twice.
@bpmckeon64 can't imagine it was windy by chance 3 times in past two weeks (he used them last week as well). would be quite a coincidence
@jeneps right i remember tweeting on it then.
@AndrewBeatty is it that windy today? I half-wondered if he doesn't like too many stairs?
Looks like Trump used the non-ceremonial, below-belly stairs to board AF1 again. He did that a week or two ago. I almost never saw Obama do it. Wonder what that's about...
@Eugene_Scott @JaneTheDragon @AaronBlake Yeah, you know, he is basically using his column to complain about others' complaining. So he's the complainer!
@Eugene_Scott @JaneTheDragon @AaronBlake me too
Turns out he's already on M1... didn't talk to reporters, but the good news is he'll just keep tweeting provocative things all weekend.

@PostScottWilson I read it first as "stormy's misery" which is a whole different story...
@JaredRizzi i know, right? you'd think he'd want max press and would give more notice, tho could have just been a whim of a tweet and staff had to scramble
@ByBrianBennett bill singing sounds more interesting, tbh
And if he's not doing it in front of whirring blades of Marine One or with a foreign leader in East Room or in Rose Garden with Mitch McConnell or on Andrews tarmac or on AF1 press cabin -- we news media have a lot of rules! https://t.co/4pP9HcfxCr

Obama‚Äôs WH comms director pining for the good ol‚Äô days of the Trump era. https://t.co/HkT8UNPABR
Many Asia experts make the point that one of the great risks of a Trump-Kim summit is that if diplomacy fails there's only one option left -- military action. If summit fails, as most everyone believes it will, Bolton (and Pompeo) will be more empowered to make hawkish case.
Bolton talks in other ways a lot like Trump does -- we're running out of time, past administrations failed to act. Is he parroting Potus or vice versa? "We have to ask ourselves whether we‚Äôre prepared to take preemptive action," he said.
The North "can sell nuclear technology to Iran, to ISIS or al-Qaeda if they‚Äôve got the hard currency, to any wannabe nuclear power around the world," Bolton said.
Bolton addresses some of this in the Breitbart radio hit. Of the North, he said; "The day it gets deliverable nuclear weapons the bazaar will be open, and the highest bidders will be welcome."
Such as the potential proliferation of nuclear materials and weapons out of the North to other bad actors or the quickly advancing nuclear capabilities the North was developing to strike the continental United States.
But in reporting this, one NSC official told me the WH did not believe the think tank community, which warned against military options, thought enough about the consequences of inaction.
Three weeks ago, @GregJaffe and I wrote about the rumors that the White House was developing "bloody nose" strike options on the North. WH and NSC denied it. https://t.co/UuUXidobyP
