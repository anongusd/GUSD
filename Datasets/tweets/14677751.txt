And for more information about what we've learned so far about Trump's reliance on illegal workers at his clubs, here's a download from @fahrenthold @partlowj: https://t.co/TGbBMdDX09
Read the piece here: https://t.co/otoVzLXhXE
“This situation is not unique to Trump Organization — it is one that all companies face,” @EricTrump told The Post last month. “It demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”
One former groundskeeping manager responded only by sending The Post an animated image of Trump saying, “I have great relationships with the Mexican people.”
The Post contacted two dozen current and former managers at Bedminster — including those identified by the workers as their supervisors — and asked if they were aware that the club employed people without legal status. Most either declined to comment or did not respond.
Franklin Mora, who quit after a year on the grounds crew, said that his manager would mock his limited English and spoke harshly to the Hispanic employees. 	“They treated us like slaves,” he said. https://t.co/2dVItHlwSu
The illegal workers earned about $10 an hour or less as employees of Trump's club, they said.		Around that time, a licensed heavy equipment operator in central New Jersey would have received an average of $51 to $55 per hour in wages and benefits.
Some of the first Costa Ricans hired to build Trump National Golf Club Bedminster remember it as punishing work. They labored from dawn until late evening, seven days a week, raking and hauling mountains of earth moved by heavy machinery and shaping it into golf holes. https://t.co/ivxI6rH0ZG
In 2011, Hank Protinsky, then the club’s head of security, was warned by local police that an employee could be using fake papers, according to a police report obtained by The Post through a public records request. https://t.co/riXRElRJm9
Housekeeper Gilberta Dominguez said her manager filled out her application in 2016 because she didn’t speak English. 	“And I said, ‘Listen, we don’t have good papers,’ ” Dominguez, of Oaxaca, Mexico, recalled telling her. “She said, ‘It doesn’t matter; don’t talk about that.’ ”
The Trump workers told us their supervisors knew they did not have legal status.
Some of the workers came illegally into the United States across the border with the help of smugglers. But other flew here and overstayed tourist visas. One Bedminster worker arrived as a cabin steward on a cruise ship that docked in Miami. https://t.co/DZdXF96PCs
In one small Costa Rican village, The Post spoke to six former Trump employees. Dario Angulo, who worked seven years on the Bedminster ground crew, said he used his “Trump money,” as he put it, to buy land and some cattle back home. https://t.co/JfHKleUS5u
The Post spoke to 16 men and women from Costa Rica and other Latin American countries who said they were employed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, some as far back as 2002.
As @realDonaldTrump heads to El Paso to renew his calls for a border wall, here’s a look at the deeply reported examination by @partlowj @nickmiroff @fahrenthold of a pipeline that provided illegal workers for Trump’s Bedminster golf club for 17 years: https://t.co/pKTQyZNsMl

Higdon “is extremely interested in noncitizens who vote and made a huge deal out of that and subpoenaed all kinds of documents, but he has no interest in this other matter? It’s cherry-picking,” said Marshall Tutor, a retired investigator for the state elections board.
Reports of voting irregularities in Bladen burst into the open after the November election, prompting the state election board to decline to certify the 9th District congressional race. The state investigation is still ongoing.
Frustrated state investigators said that while Higdon’s office was going after noncitizen voters, they tried without success to get his prosecutors to pursue a separate alleged fraud: an effort run by a GOP operative to tamper with absentee ballots in Bladen County.
Still, those convicted said the experience sent a powerful message. “I want to tell my people: Don’t vote,” said Jose Solano-Rodriguez, a legal resident who lives in Raleigh with his U.S.-born wife and three children and runs a successful landscaping business. https://t.co/HVltSEjw0T
So far, the voting-fraud prosecutions have netted minimal penalties: The five defendants who have been sentenced received minimal fines, misdemeanor convictions and no jail time.
All but one of those arrested are legal residents, including a man from Italy who had passed the citizenship test but had not been sworn in. Four others said they had been urged to vote by campaign workers or election volunteers and did not realize they were breaking the law.
“It was a nightmare that I will never get over,” said Hyo Suk George, who was feeding her rabbits and chickens when the agents showed up. https://t.co/cwKZuowxck
Federal authorities rounded up 20 immigrants in North Carolina over several days last August. Two were still in their pajamas. Many were handcuffed and shackled.
But under U.S. attorney Robert Higdon, there has been only one known federal prosecution that has resulted -- an operation focused on the noncitizen voting.
North Carolina officials also found more than 400 suspected felons voted improperly, two cases of voter impersonation, 24 cases of double-voting and “irregularities affecting absentee by-mail voting in Bladen County.”
.@realDonaldTrump has claimed “millions” voted illegally in 2016 and sought to portray voting by immigrants as a widespread phenomenon. In North Carolina, state officials took a look and found 41 noncitizens had voted out of more than 4.5 million total ballots cast.

Margarita Cruz, a housekeeping employee from Mexico who was fired after eight years at the club, said, "When they take our taxes, we count as people. Why don’t we count in other things?”		She feels, she added, that, “we don’t exist.” https://t.co/kLsY6oEICA
He added that it is one of the reasons “my father is fighting so hard for immigration reform. The system is broken.”
In a statement, Eric Trump said, “We are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment."
Eric Trump did not respond to questions about whether executives had previously been aware that they employed undocumented workers.
Alejandro Juarez, a native of Mexico who had worked as a server and food runner since 2007, said Eric Trump greeted him by name at a party in December.  “I was serving hors d’oeuvres,” Juarez recalled, “and he told me, ‘Thanks, Alejandro. Thanks for everything, Okay?'”
One former Westchester manager characterized the attitude at the club as “don’t ask, don’t tell.”		“It didn’t matter. They didn’t care [about immigration status]. “It was, ‘Get the cheapest labor possible.’ ”
https://t.co/u2PoMRWPfB
Gabriel Sedano, a former maintenance worker from Mexico who was among those fired, said he had been employed by Trump's company since 2005. “ I’d given the best of myself to this job," he said. "I’d never done anything wrong, only work and work."
Garcia and other workers said many had worked at Trump's Westchester club for years. https://t.co/qp5PQgoc1q
She was fired by the Trump Organization on Jan. 18.
Before Trump's speech, Adela Garcia, an undocumented worker herself, vacuumed the carpet inside the club, as captured in this Reuters photo. https://t.co/Yg6GBTuqbB
Trump delivered one of those campaign speeches at his club in Westchester, vowing to U.S. citizens, "we’re going to protect your job because, let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we’re babies.”
Incredible reporting by @partlowj @Fahrenthold provides the best look yet at how Trump's private business has relied on the labor of undocumented workers -- even as he railed they were stealing jobs from Americans.		https://t.co/KwxBEFkf0m

One Human Rights Watch official recalled talking with a key congressional aide about civilian casualties in Yemen and realizing that the aide was simultaneously receiving texts from Otaiba, the UAE ambassador who is a key advocate for the Saudis.
Earlier this year, during the seven weeks leading up to the crown prince’s visit and a vote to end US involvement in Yemen, lobbyists reported 759 contacts with members of Congress, staffers, academics and reporters on behalf of the Saudi government.
A 2017 op-ed by Assisi published on https://t.co/pPJajlTapO was entered into the congressional record by Rep. Edward R. Royce (Calif.), the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who praised his “support for intelligence sharing.”	https://t.co/3ssfdrQLJd
Powerful government figures — including deputy intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, who was fired for Khashoggi’s killing — have visited Washington to court reporters and think tank analysts.
The kingdom is savvy about harnessing social media. When MBS was in DC in 2017, the embassy’s @ArabiaNow Twitter feed — run by Qorvis MSLGROUP, according to lobbying records — offered a sunny view of the oil-rich kingdom and its role in Yemen.
Earlier this year, Saudi officials offered Super Bowl tickets and chartered flights to media stars such as CNN’s @jaketapper and Fox News’s @BretBaier (they both turned them down).
Saudi ambassador has hosted intimate dinners in Washington and even occasional galas, such as a lavish event at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium honoring this year’s visit of the crown prince.
The Saudis have found a receptive audience in Trump, who has done business with its wealthy citizens, and in Kushner, who developed a close bond with MBS as he crafted the administration’s Middle East policy.	https://t.co/Fc4CBdfer5
But the kingdom’s power goes beyond lobbying muscle and think tanks.
.@ChrisMurphyCT said that "everybody who is smart and knows about foreign policy" tells him that "the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have a special, unbreakable relationship....But as it turns out, a lot of those people are getting gulf money.”
Saudi money — and funds from its close ally, the United Arab Emirates — have also flowed into think tanks throughout Washington, including the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Brookings Institution and the Middle East Institute.
In an effort to defeat bill pushed by Sept. 11 families, military veterans were recruited by Saudi consultants to lobby the Hill. Some did not know the kingdom was behind the effort. “We realized we were pawns,” one vet said.
Money is no object. The firm of one former Trump campaign adviser was paid $5.4 million -- for an engagement that ended after one month.
https://t.co/Y1KxlFF21s
Saudi spending on U.S. lobbying and consulting, which had dropped from $14.3 million in 2015 to $7.7 million in 2016, surged to $27.3 million last year, according to public records.
