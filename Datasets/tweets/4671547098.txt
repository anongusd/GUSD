There is no honest way to argue that republicans are motivated by anything other than racism and homogeneity in their (cruel) approaches to immigration.
This, and also at a price tag of $72m and $100m+ for earlier national guard deployment ($200m+ total), we could have easily provided years worth of social services to all arriving migrants in need while reaping offsetting taxes from their economic impact. https://t.co/yHtyoIjnLs
RT @fivefifths: no more water, but fire next time
so, if the democratic party were to shift talking points that allow for republicans to scream "tax and spend" to instead say "let's cut 99% of Americans' taxes by a huge amount," then many republican voters of all varieties below the $500,000 income bracket would probably defect.
it would, of course, be very unpopular with the 0.1% and beyond.... but that is less than 160,000 households, all of which are already earning a minimum of $1.6 million annually, and they pay lower average income taxes (as % of income) than most middle class americans.
the implications for a progressive tax like this would be monumental for economic stimulus, fighting poverty and hunger, and increased quality of life. the minuscule revenue loss could be easily made up reduced need for social service spending and increased consumer spending.
tax decreases of such an extreme amount would probably be wildly popular. exactly 99% of the population would see a significant decrease in taxes and a significant bump in income, with the biggest changes occurring among the bottom 75% of earners.
top 10%-top 5% ($128k-$180k)	--&gt; 20% tax cut 		top 5%-top 1% ($180k-$430k)	--&gt; 10% tax cut		top 1%-top 0.1% ($430k-$1.6m)	--&gt; 0% change		top 0.1%-top 0.01% ($1.6m-$7.5m)	--&gt; 50% tax hike 		top 0.01%-top 0.001% ($7.5m-$60m)	--&gt; 100% tax hike 		top 0.001% (&gt;$60m)	--&gt; %300 tax hike
using 2015 figures, we could do the following* to tax rates and end up with very little net revenue loss: 		lowest 50% of incomes earners (&lt;$38k)	--&gt;100% tax cut		top 50%-top 25% ($38k-$75k)	--&gt; 60% tax cut		top 25%-top 10% ($75k-$128k) 	--&gt; 35% tax cut		*my math might be off

"racism is a protected political belief" was the predecessor to "homophobia is a protected religious belief".......  the invocation of the 1st amendment to deprive others of equal rights is the worst legal argument you could possible make, and yet
defending racism w/ premise that it is a political belief while also attacking vulgarity/porn/sexuality w/ premise that it is not a political belief is........ a concession that blatant racism contributes more to national dialogue than queer perspectives.
Yes, rural white people are often either racist or indifferent to racism. Still, if we can achieve racial justice and build a non-white voting coalition, provide them access to the polls, and ALSO deliver obvious economic justice to rural white folk, we will retake the South.
if we can create pathways for disenfranchised and otherwise disadvantaged voters , energize POC voters , and deliver lasting economic revitalization to rural communities as a result, we will see a shift.
it's true that rural white folk seem hellbent on prioritizing racial discrimination over their own economic wellbeing. so a purely populist economic message might not be the best way to win them. 		Instead, imagine if we prioritized racial justice AND economic justice
"the south can't turn blue w/ progressive politicians" is exactly the wrong way to think about southern politics. 		the south is in dire need of progressive politicians.
by all means, Criticize the stupid immigration comment. Criticize her from the left, point out her flaws. but don't do it more than you do the men who have more power, more influence, and are more conservative democrats than she. be fair &amp; learn recognize your own prejudices
i'm not saying she's infallible, of course she's wrong re: immigration in europe in that interview. But the disproportionate energy that goes into attacking her (not an elected official) is INSANE and so so obviously rooted in sexism that even progressive women seem unable to see
it's like she's expected to be more progressive than she is b/c she's a woman. maybe. but she's further left than all of our past party-leaders and you're still shitting on her for not being the perfect progressive vessel.
the media outrage gap btwn obama, biden, bernie, bill, kerry, etc. and hillary is fascinating. she is w.out a doubt the most progressive of all of these except bernie (who i won't go into rn), and yet the left attacks her far, far more.
the democrats have moved left (good). she has moved left, too, but not as far left as we have. Sure, she's not what we need right now, but she would have been an incredible president.
you don't have to LIKE her. it's just ridiculous that so much media energy goes into HATING her for things that other democrats (men) do or say with impunity daily. She is a left-of-center democrat icon of the 2000s. She has flaws. She is still relatively progressive tho
still v confused by people's hatred of hillary (except, of course, that it's all internalized misogyny) . no, she is not the perfect progressive. yes, there are issues on which i disagree w/ her. Still, she is better than bernie. Still, she is better than most powerful democrats.

Ruth Bader Ginsberg isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúbadass feminist,‚Äù no matter how nice it looks on a t-shirt. She‚Äôs an intersectional feminist and a pioneer of judicial social justice. Making a myth out of her will not carry on her legacy, it will allow others to appropriate it. (See MLK)
But ‚Äúbadass feminism‚Äù is the logical extension of the appropriation of queer culture, of black culture, etc. It‚Äôs feminism as a costume, and though of course women have every right to wear that costume, it distracts from the real issues.
Badass feminism, though, seems to be more a comment on the popularization of feminism, the appropriation of feminism into quotidian culture and the corporate mainstream. It‚Äôs not wholly bad, and the representation is probably a net positive.
I like the pejorative ‚Äúbadass feminist‚Äù  much better than ‚Äúwhite feminist‚Äù because it digs a little deeper into the problem of popular feminism. White feminism implies a feminism that isn‚Äôt race conscious, or at least that doesn‚Äôt prioritize intersectionality

@CeeJayCraig they are partially to blame. In the grand scheme of homophobia chik--Fil-a is partially to blame. Any homophobic company is.
@CeeJayCraig no I'm not. This is not in any way a contradiction to what I previously said.
@CeeJayCraig they doesn't excuse Christian homophobia in the United States.
@CeeJayCraig I don't think they are directly responsible for the attack. I think their attitude leads to the hatred that leads to murder.
@CeeJayCraig He was clearly homophobic. Chik-Fil-A contributes to a culture of homophobia. They deserve no praise for helping LGBT people.
@CeeJayCraig I never said that. I said that Chik-fil-a fostered an attitude that led to a hate crime under the guise of Islamic terrorism.
Lmao. This is bullshit. Chik Fil A spreads hate. Hate leads to violence. Chik Fil A is partially to blame for this.  https://t.co/XhIT93d35k
