Americans are going without lifesaving meds to save money, while Rx companies are bringing in huge profits.		That‚Äôs not right.		It‚Äôs why I support the FLAT Prices Act - so Rx companies can‚Äôt drive up costs and put these lifesaving meds out of reach of those who need them.

Karin Housley‚Äôs elder care work was a win for exactly what the ‚Äúarmy of lobbyists‚Äù wanted: a bill that senior advocates said would have moved our state ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù and ‚Äúweakened‚Äù protections for seniors -- and one that never became law. https://t.co/UIOuuaKx1v

I voted NO on Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court.
He's anti-consumer rights, and anti-collective bargaining, anti-abortion, anti-gay rights. - Tyler
If Kavanaugh is nominated, it reinforces my growing fear that I can‚Äôt bring a baby girl into this world that could share the rights I have now. Being female, my anxiety grows each day, and I fear for the future. - Annika
I'm very concerned about the LGBT gains that have been made being overruled or rights being taken away in the name of "religious freedom." - Dennis
I am 15 years old. As a teenage girl, I oppose many of Kavanaugh's personal stances. The way that men in government talk about women's bodies and abortions makes me feel like men like Kavanaugh disrespect women's bodies, opinions, and choices. - Meredith
My best friend died from an illegal abortion in 1966. She was only 19. She was from a very strict Evangelical family &amp; felt as though she had no choice. 3 days after this botched abortion, she died of blood poisoning. I have been marching for pro-choice since. -Lynne Marie
I oppose Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination because he will strip the women of America of their reproductive rights, like my mom and sisters. He will take away coverage from people with pre-existing conditions, like my grandparents. - Kyle
Workers' rights to collectively bargain are part of economic justice, and Kavanaugh has shown that he sides with employers over workers, a move that will further disempower those who are often already living at the margins. - Uyenthi
I work in health care and I have a pre-existing condition. I have patients who will most likely lose their insurance, and their lives, if this man becomes a Supreme Court Justice. - Christina
If Kavanaugh was confirmed, I would fear that my family members would face discrimination at the ballot and it would be harder for them to vote. - Alexandra
I just left the Senate floor, where I shared why I‚Äôm voting no on Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation to the Supreme Court. Over the past few weeks, you‚Äôve been sharing with me why YOU oppose Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination. So today I want to share a few of those stories with everyone:

My opponent was asked about her plans to address climate change. Her answer: ‚Äúnone have been placed in front me.‚Äù Sound familiar? She said the same thing about protecting Social Security. It's a troubling, casual disregard for issues that matter to Minnesotans. https://t.co/Nxfa704CyK

All across Minnesota, parents are faced with rising child care costs. We need more affordable child care options for families, so parents can focus on their kids‚Äînot worry about how they‚Äôll pay the bills.

The GOP passed a tax law ‚Äúfor‚Äù working families. In reality, it adds $1.5 trillion to the national debt &amp; risks major cuts to Social Security &amp; Medicare. My opponent can‚Äôt name a single change she would make to the law. MN expects Senators to do the work to understand the issues.
I tucked my daughter in &amp; told her to, "promise me you'll always stand up for yourself." She said, "okay Mommy, but first I need to get some sleep."

Minnesotans are being priced out of prescription medications, so I‚Äôm taking on Big Pharma.

There is no reason to rush this vote. We need a full FBI investigation.
I have been incredibly moved by the testimony of Dr. Blasey Ford, and the honesty, courage, and conviction of both her actions and her words. Let this be a turning point - on the Supreme Court and in the lives of every American, men included.

Judge Kavanaugh is up for lifetime appointment &amp; faces a 3rd accusation of sexual misconduct. I see no reason that the FBI shouldn't conduct a quick &amp; thorough investigation except one: Republicans will stop at nothing to get their man on the Court. And that ain't a good reason.
My opponent claimed she was running ‚Äúto make sure we have Social Security &amp; Medicare in the future.‚Äù But when asked about plans, months into her campaign, she didn‚Äôt have an answer. It‚Äôs more than not knowing how to answer a question--it‚Äôs a casual disregard for doing the work. https://t.co/1I1QAnDJHO

In the highest court, you should be held to the highest standards.
To build a healthier Minnesota, we have to include mental health resources for our students. Proud of the bipartisan act I wrote with Sen. Murkowski that passed the Senate this week. This will support increased access to mental health resources for students and their communities.

In 3 days, confirmation hearings for the SCOTUS nominee will begin. We‚Äôve been fighting this, but we *must* keep raising our voices. Our reproductive rights, affordable health care, ability to hold the executive branch accountable‚Äî the list goes on‚Äîare on the line.
Pres. GW Bush said, "He respected the dignity inherent in every life, a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators...He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots. There was something deep inside him that made him stand up for the little guy.‚Äù
Pres. Obama said, ‚ÄúSo much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small &amp; mean &amp; petty, trafficking in bombast &amp; insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage...John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that.‚Äù

Lena‚Äôs legacy has played a profound role in shaping our state‚Äôs civil rights. Her work is a reminder that our fight for progress and equality is never over. Like Lena, we must all always strive to do our duty. https://t.co/goSyTNBszL
On the first day of #WomensHistoryMonth, I'm remembering Lena Olive Smith. In the 1920s, Lena opened her law firm in Minnesota, becoming the state‚Äôs first black woman to practice law. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, she boldly challenged racial barriers throughout the Twin Cities. https://t.co/qaGy5W4JxX
So I'm working hard to reduce drug costs, because as your Senator, it's my job to improve the lives of ALL Minnesotans. Sign on to become a citizen co-sponsor of my first bill: https://t.co/JtsTRDmnUU
See, giant drug companies are gaming the system by paying money to keep affordable generic drugs off the market. It makes it harder for you and your loved ones to afford life-saving drugs.
Big pharma makes plenty of profit. And I don‚Äôt work for them‚ÄîI work for you. That‚Äôs why I've introduced my first bill as senator to help address the cost of prescription drugs.
I started out this campaign with less than ten months. Now, I have just eight. Help fuel our fight to November: https://t.co/UCywE4VSrY https://t.co/uTkNIibRjU
President Trump‚Äôs proposed budget calls for the elimination of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Minnesota alone, 126,000 households rely on this program to make cold winters tolerable and keep their homes warm. I will not stand for this. https://t.co/3HgXToq4Jd
I want you to know how proud and grateful I am to you for representing our country with such strength and grace. Your hard work and persistence are being revered worldwide -- and you never cease to amaze and inspire me.
I would especially like to congratulate the eight Minnesota women who helped our Women‚Äôs Hockey Team win gold -- incredible athletes who have done our state and country so proud. In fact, Minnesota produces more girls and women hockey players than any other state by far.
Here‚Äôs to all of the incredible U.S athletes who represented our country at the Winter #Olympics these past few weeks. https://t.co/6UtVOntCDX
Ensuring health care for our most vulnerable will always be my top priority. 		https://t.co/PAxazeWGw8
Recently, I held a discussion with local parents of children who depend on Medicaid. Many of the people I spoke with are worried -- especially our seniors. President Trump‚Äôs proposed reduction in government health care spending would leave many without a safety net.
James Baldwin was condemned not only for his race but also for his sexuality. His essays on racial discrimination in America helped shape the civil rights movement. May we continue to lift up his voice this month and beyond. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/Rotgh0YW5j

I wanted to share her story because I‚Äôm inspired by her. Both through Planned Parenthood and in her own right, Faye has always been a fearless fighter. Her story is exactly the example we need as we embark upon our own fights for progress, equality, and change. #BlackHistoryMonth
In 1978, Faye became the first African American to be elected President of @PPFA -- the first woman to hold the position since its founder Margaret Sanger. Under her leadership, Planned Parenthood grew into the politically-engaged health care provider it is today.
Faye Wattleton is one incredible woman. https://t.co/RHwh4sAKsW
In the Senate, I‚Äôm pushing for measures that would help protect this investigation from further partisan attacks, and our future elections from further foreign interference.
These indictments are the first step, but offer a stark warning. If the 2018 midterms are going to be free and fair elections, we need to protect ourselves against Russian cyberattacks now. This is not a partisan issue -- this is a national security crisis.
The Justice Department today announced its first indictments for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. They‚Äôve charged 13 people with executing a massive effort to mislead American voters with Russian-fed propaganda. https://t.co/j7MWgCwYnL

@AngieCraigMN Proud to support your campaign, @AngieCraigMN!
I heard from a range of perspectives -- and now, I‚Äôm eager to take those ideas and transform them into meaningful strategies and ways that the federal government can help.
That's a problem that plagued communities like Rochester, where I held a discussion with community members about the issue. https://t.co/brlEFSF8cd
If you don't have a safe affordable place to live, then you can't go to work, and you can't get your education. Really, nothing works in your life.
I want to clarify something. The 20-week-ban contains no exception to protect a woman‚Äôs health. That's a fact. The bill does include exceptions for survivors of sexual assault, but they are wholly inadequate. I should have been more precise by describing the bill that way. https://t.co/ZQga4ZUNHo

Donald Trump refuses to be a leader for all, and he showed us that once again in tonight's address. In the Senate, you can count on me to hold him accountable -- and to continue being a fierce fighter for ALL Minnesotans. #SOTU
Because when the president talks about economic gains, he needs to make sure those gains are going to ALL Americans, not just the wealthiest few. When he talks about public safety, he needs to make sure ALL Americans can feel safe in their communities and homes. #SOTU
Minnesotans want these things too. But what I hear from the people of Minnesota is serious concern about where this president is taking our country. I agree. #SOTU
Tonight, President Donald Trump outlined his vision for America. He spoke of the need for bipartisanship, job creation, and infrastructure investment. #SOTU
This bill is just another part of an out-of-touch GOP agenda to undermine Roe v. Wade and interfere with a private and deeply personal decision that should be between a woman and her doctor. Minnesota, I want you to know that I voted NO on this unconstitutional bill. #StopTheBans
Not only is later abortion rare, but when it does occur, it is often because a woman faces a serious risk to her health and her pregnancy. This bill is an attack on women facing desperate circumstances.
Today, Senate Republicans launched their latest attack on a woman's constitutional right to decide whether or when to start a family. It would ban abortion after 20 weeks, with no exception to protect a woman's health and no exceptions for survivors of rape and incest.

Sad to be in DC this weekend but continue to be heartened by the energy of people participating in women‚Äôs marches across the country -- including my 87-year-old dad, Harlan, in New Mexico. https://t.co/lc3VCAo24M
So with all the energy and momentum displayed by everyday citizens across our communities and country today, I can't help but be optimistic. We are all part of this long arc of history -- together.
As I said at the march last year, it's easy to be optimistic when things are going our way. This past year -- this week -- has indeed called on us to find optimism and hope through immense challenge. More than ever, it's clear that the path to progress is not a straight one.
Yet even as we see yet another example of failed leadership in DC, I can‚Äôt help by feel inspired by the energy of the @WomensMarch anniversary events taking place all across our state and country this weekend.
There‚Äôs a clear solution that protects CHIP, protects DACA, and has bipartisan support -- a solution we have right in front of us. But Republicans stubbornly refuse to act.
Real leaders take responsibility. Republicans control the House. They control the Senate. They control the White House. Today, our government is shut down because of their inability to lead.
Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House, so how can a government shutdown possibly be anyone's fault but their own? Especially when there's a bipartisan path forward that protects children's health insurance and Dreamers. https://t.co/7UXsscTDQJ
Tina Smith here, Minnesota's new Senator. I've only been in Congress for two weeks, so I need a little help understanding something:

There will be no easy solutions to this. But I can promise you that I will keep up the pressure.

It is incumbent on each of us to find an opportunity to act on Dr. King‚Äôs words and keep fighting for progress -- each and every day.
I‚Äôm often reminded of this quote when I think of Dr. King: ‚ÄúSomewhere we must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals.‚Äù
Today, we remember and honor the hard work and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the many other leaders who fought before him, marched with him, and have stood on his shoulders since.
