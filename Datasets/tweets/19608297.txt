Trump says he loves troops and veterans, but he continues to defend his discriminatory ban on transgender troops.  		Brave trans service members and veterans deserve to have their constitutional rights protected and service respected. #CPAC2019

This seems like an appropriate time to remind everyone that the Trump-Pence administration has rescinded and undermined protections for LGBTQ students, youth of color, people with disabilities and survivors of sexual assault. #CPAC2019

Pence claims that America is succeeding on the world stage at #CPAC. The reality is Trump &amp; Pence have repeatedly failed the test of leadership abroad.		Since news broke ~2 years ago, the Trump-Pence White House has refused to publicly condemn anti-LGBTQ violence in Chechnya.
When Mike Pence claims he wants to defend personal beliefs, what he really means is allowing medical providers to deny lifesaving care to LGBTQ people, licensing discrimination in the foster system and turning away trans children from the Department of Education.		#CPAC #CPAC2019

10/ Additionally, research consistently shows that #LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the foster care system, due to many factors including family rejection because of their LGBTQ status.		Once in care, LGBTQ youth are especially vulnerable to discrimination &amp; mistreatment.
9/ Statistics suggest that an estimated two million LGBTQ adults in the U.S. are interested in adoption, but the LGBTQ community often remains an untapped resource when it comes to finding families for children and youth in foster care.
8/ Most of all, the HHS waiver &amp; these licenses to discriminate 𝐡𝐮𝐫𝐭 𝐤𝐢𝐝𝐬 in need of a loving home.		It isn’t in the best interest of a child to deny them a qualified, loving family simply because that family doesn’t share all of the tenets of the placing agency’s faith.
7/ This could include:	✖️ single parents	✖️ LGBTQ individuals 	✖️ same-sex couples	✖️ parents who previously have been divorced	✖️ interfaith couples	✖️ people of faith that happen to be of another religion
6/The waiver was about making sure an agency in SC wouldn’t lose its federal funding because it refused to work with Jewish people.		🚨The HHS waiver then opened the door to federally-funded discrimination justified by religious belief against any number of prospective parents.🚨
5/ @HHSGov recently granted a waiver to South Carolina’s foster care program to excuse it from requirements that the federally-funded program not discriminate on the basis of religion. https://t.co/OED4ZKgatb
4/ At the state level, these licenses to discriminate are anti-LGBTQ.		𝑩𝑼𝑻 the framing of these bills as being about a provider’s religious objections means that the discriminatory impact can go much further, including interfaith couples, single parents, etc.
3/ These state laws allow agencies to refuse to work with #LGBTQ people, and some also allow them to refuse various medical treatments to LGBTQ children in their care.		𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐜𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐫𝐲.
2/ Nine states, including 5 states in the last 3 years, have passed laws allowing taxpayer-funded child welfare programs (adoption and foster care services) to pick and choose to whom they provide the services the government has paid them to provide.

14/14 It doesn't appear that any of this -- the misogyny or the anti-LGBTQ extremism or credible allegations of actual vote tampering -- bothers @mike_pence. 𝗛𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝘀 𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝗺𝗲𝘀.
13/ That same year, @MarkHarrisNC9 expressed sorrow over fewer women doing household chores: “Even basic things, like how to prepare a meal, how to sew on a button, how to keep a home, how to respond to a husband, just basic things; we've lost them!” #NC09 https://t.co/JZBK5c6zXZ
12/Harris once questioned whether women should have careers: “In our culture today, girls are taught from grade school...that what is most honorable in life is a career...Is that a healthy pursuit for society? Is that the healthiest pursuit for our homes?” https://t.co/wa7c1lTzxW
11/ That same year, @MarkHarrisNC9 claimed transgender people are simply “facing some other psychological issues.” #NC09 https://t.co/18QDYi9wU4 https://t.co/0kenjdlX4z
10/ In 2015, @MarkHarrisNC9 claimed that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom that aligned with their gender identity would permit “a guy with a skirt and wig” to go into the women’s restroom. #NC09 https://t.co/quiMEa5fm6
9/ On the campaign trail, @MarkHarrisNC9 fondly remembered the days when homosexuality was criminalized: “We have watched in one generation where homosexuality was once criminalized, to now, we see the criminalization of Christianity." #NC09 https://t.co/l3fyU0uQQd
8/ It is no secret why. 𝐌𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐏𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐯𝐮𝐥𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬, 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐲 𝐋𝐆𝐁𝐓𝐐 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐰𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧 — just like @MarkHarrisNC9. 		Here are some examples…
7/ Meanwhile, @mike_pence — who Donald Trump tapped to lead his infamous voter suppression commission last year — has yet to say anything about these extensive claims of election fraud against @MarkHarrisNC9’ campaign. #NC09
6/ Yesterday, @MarkHarrisNC9 fled local media as they tried to ask him questions pertaining to the investigation — even setting off a fire alarm to escape. This doesn’t seem like the reaction of someone who is innocent. #NC09	https://t.co/DOX2fBG40Z
5/The claims against Harris are so severe that congressional leaders have refused to seat him until the conclusion of the investigation. 		To date, the state elections board has also refused to certify the results pending the investigation’s outcome. #NC09	https://t.co/r6yIAiQ9T9
4/ This is the same Mark Harris who is currently embroiled in an investigation by North Carolina’s state elections board for credible allegations of vote tampering, which is said to have involved the theft of ballots by Harris campaign workers. #NC09
3/ The Pences said of @MarkHarrisNC9: “He’s the kind of strong, principled conservative leader who will stand with this administration to deliver results. He’s a husband, a father, a pastor, a leader. He has devoted his life to his service to others … a devoted servant of God."
2/ @mike_pence and his wife, Karen Pence, are longtime friends of the embattled #NC09 Republican congressional candidate @MarkHarrisNC9. 	 	In fact, they only campaigned for a handful of candidates, 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐇𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐬. https://t.co/ix8nAflWfZ
1/ Remember when @mike_pence chaired a voter suppression commission that investigated bogus claims of voter fraud? 	 	It turns out he's doesn't have the same passion for democracy when his friend @MarkHarrisNC9 is facing credible allegations of vote tampering. #NC09

9/9 From spreading misinformation about condom use, to contributing to a major outbreak of HIV &amp; AIDS in Indiana, @mike_pence has been reckless with the health &amp; lives of those he has sworn to serve.		Check out @HRC's report about the #RealMikePence. https://t.co/R75vxKRVeB
8/  Last December, Trump &amp; Pence fired all remaining members of the President"s Advisory Council on HIV &amp; AIDS -- and have left the council vacant in the year since. https://t.co/Pyq0gneMVD
7/ The Trump-Pence administration said it was committed to ending the HIV epidemic, but redirected millions of crucial funds for HIV treatment and cancer research to fund their unconscionable family separation policy. https://t.co/xq0pUWPQqZ
6/ @TheNation took an inside look at Pence’s response to the outbreak:  “Pence is now vice president in an administration that is gutting HIV/AIDS resources and further criminalizing drug use—two paths that will increase HIV prevalence across the country.” https://t.co/8ZBenU3vx9
5/ As the outbreak went out of control, Pence was “reluctant” to lift a ban on needle exchanges that could mitigate the spread of the virus. Pence waited a year to sign off on funding, leading to an outbreak that included 190 victims of HIV &amp; AIDS. https://t.co/R75vxKRVeB
4/ As governor of Indiana, Pence’s cuts to public health funding helped fuel the worst outbreak of HIV &amp; AIDS in the state’s history. The outbreak in Scott County was enabled by the closure of a local Planned Parenthood clinic, which was the county’s only HIV testing center.
3/ In 2003, responding to the HIV &amp; AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, @Mike_Pence argued for the Bush administration to 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐚𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞-𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 over condom distribution. https://t.co/R75vxKRVeB
2/ In 2002, Mike Pence said, “Frankly, condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases...” In the same interview, Pence claimed condoms have “zero preventative value” and are “too modern of an answer.” https://t.co/R75vxKRVeB
1/Today, Mike Pence, 𝐰𝐡𝐨 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐫 𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐛𝐲 𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐇𝐈𝐕 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, will deliver remarks at a World AIDS Day event at the White House. https://t.co/myTGypFNev
