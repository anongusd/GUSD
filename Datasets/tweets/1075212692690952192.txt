Don't let your kids talk to strangers!		Don't let that controversial book be read in class!		Let's protect the :"traditional neighborhood" from urban encroachment!		The sanitized world must be upheld at all costs.
Suburbia created a false utopia for white middle class America, and it made a vast swath of America unable to handle the real world. 		Any semblance of societical problems like drug addiction, homelessness, it all had to be eradicated with strict Law &amp; Order policies.
Suburbia definitely helped manufacture the "stranger danger" scare. While European parents will let groups of kids walk onto a busy plaza unattended, American parents face prosecution if they let their kids play on a playground unsupervised 4 blocks from home.
When I visited Barcelona and Berlin, single family housing was rare. Everyone lived in 4-6 story dwellings, including families with kids. Playgrounds existed down side streets, kids walked in groups on wide pedestrian paths for safety.		Kids thrived in that environment.
American pop culture has placed horse blinders on vast swaths of the population, creating a perception that no middle class person with a family can or would want to live in a multifamily dwelling, that homeownership is a must, and that kids need space.		It's a narrow worldview.
I have a working theory that NIMBYs don't ever travel abroad and see the kids thriving in European cities. 		They think it's impossible for kids to live in urban environments, that playgrounds don't exist in urban areas, and that a yard is necessary for children to grow up. https://t.co/L7OqCQcvA1

Another benefit of community colleges is that they frequently use open source textbooks. You often don't have to pay for a textbook. If you take the identical class at a 4-year university, prepare to shell out $70 or $80 for a book you might use only three or four times.
One of the most frequently given reasons students give for dropping out is because they can't afford college. Take the cheaper option. You're more likely to complete college.
Oh, and while it's nice to finish college as soon as possible, barely half of full-time bachelor degree students complete in six years. Not only are dropout rates high, but many often leave school before coming back. Both my brother and mother did that. There's no shame in it.
Among other things, the report from FiveThirtyEight found that less than 1/3 of college students are full-time, degree-seeking students at four-year residential universities. Yet the overwhelming media narrative is that they're the majority. https://t.co/QNXqTvrJZg
Oh, and you can stop stressing, too. Not that grades aren't important, but they're not something to obsess about or things meant to dominate your life. Enjoy your high school years. Community colleges don't care about your high school grades. There's no selectivity.
There's a reason teen suicides are rising, even as teen drug use and teen pregnancies decline. There's a reason South Korea has an insanely high teen suicide rate. Much of the blame can be placed on extreme academic stress. We need to stop stressing our teens out.
Pushing our kids to attend the Ivy League or high tier universities, regardless of the emotional and physical cost is extremely detrimental. We're setting kids up to fail. Your life isn't over if you're in community college with a 3.1 GPA. You're doing yourself a favor.
I understand the desire to escape home and visit somewhere new. Do that with all your savings from attending college in-state. You can save tens of thousands by staying in state. How many vacations is that?
Oh, and traveling thousands of miles away for college sucks. You won't be able to come home for the short Thanksgiving break, and you'll have to pay for a plane ticket to visit home only once or twice a year.
Additionally, many states are now making the first year of community college free, and sometimes both years, if good high school grades are kept. Don't pass up on that opportunity.
Also, there's no shame in attending community college. The instructors there aren't obsessed with research, actually want to teach you, the class sizes are smaller, support staff actually watches out for you, and the classes are a fraction of the cost.
Also, the friends you make at community college are more interesting. They're of a variety of ages and have much stranger backgrounds. Talking to disabled combat vets and 35 year old single moms going back to school is different than talking to another middle class whiz kid.

Humanity's impact on the surface of the Earth shouldn't be ignored just because we're focusing on cutting carbon.		Hell, the two issues are intrinsically linked. Environmental restoration MUST be a crucial element of climate policy. Forests, wetlands, grasslands sequester carbon.
Hell, even in supposedly "green" areas like the Pacific Northwest, growing monocultures of trees like crops doesn't sequester carbon or support life like a native forest does, because of the millions of biological interactions disrupted by management.		https://t.co/wMTa0GbgXW
Regarding the Amazon.		Even if we stopped cutting now, we may have already killed it. The evapotranspiration from trees helped keep the Amazon moist, preventing droughts, etc.		Less forest means more droughts. The forest literally supported itself.		https://t.co/T4tZpl24Uu
This is true. We've already created ecological feedback loops that will continue long after we stop emitting carbon. 		Methane hydrates are releasing GHG's. The fragmentation of the Amazon is changing local weather patterns, killing off swathes of rainforest. https://t.co/0dwUfYKdkA
The science has only gotten more damning over the past 20 years that preventing habitat fragmentation and preserving ecosystems in their natural state yields enormous dividends in the form of ecosystem services. 		Moreover, it's not like there are fewer endangered species now.
I miss the environmentalists of the 1990s, which were fundamentally conservationists, emphasizing the protection of animal habitat and old-growth ecosystems to protect the best unexploited sites.		The nearly exclusive focus on climate has had consequences.
It's one thing if people are just using it to try to score political points.		It's entirely different if people actually believe it. And that's what worries me about the far left. They actually believe we are nearing the end times if we don't adopt their policy positions.
You need to be out of touch with actual science to think that climate change has a specific deadline by which point we're all dead, and if we solve it before the deadline, we survive.		Climate change is a slow-motion disaster with exponential impacts that is already happening.

The obsession Holocaust deniers have with the gas chambers really shows how ahistorical they are, and how they prey on the not very informed.		Millions died in the Holocaust due to death squads in the Holocaust by Bullets. But deniers never even mention those people.

Hell, I would argue that wealthy suburbs are only breaking towards Democrats right now because they actually believe in respectability politics and want to turn on the TV without hearing about the president doing crazy shit.
American suburban culture is why the puclic pushed for "Law &amp; Order" policies against crime, why the MPAA fights sex in movies, why sex-ed is poorly taught in schools, the demonization of homelessness and poverty.		We created a culture of scared people in a sterile place.

The fear of technological unemployment from McDonald's ordering screens is a perfect example of people looking at headlines, panicking, and making assumptions about technology ruining lives.		When in reality the technology is improving everyone's lives.
In conclusion, McDonald's locations that have digital ordering have seen increases in employment, improved service, and increased sales, while still offering counter ordering for people who hate screens. Stop predicting doomsday.
The reduction in labor taking orders has allowed employees to be reassigned to do other tasks. 		Thirdly, the digital ordering process has allowed for food to be purchased online, increasing the number of workers in the kitchen, to meet the increased demand.
We need to stop pretending that McDonald's new digital ordering screens are going to kill fast food employment. 		Firstly, there are still some counter workers. 		Secondly, table service has started at locations with digital screens.
Privatization is neither inherently good or inherently bad. It's a tool that should never be written off or overused. It should be evaluated on a case by case basis, with an focus on identifying what the created incentive structure will be.

The fifth reform was the establishment of a flat proportional income tax, to increase investment in the economy. It reduced tax evasion dramatically, causing the reform to surprisingly pay for itself.
The fourth reform was to privatization of state owned enterprises. That was intentionally done after reforms to establish rule of law, to ensure that the state industry didn't fall into the hands of criminal gangs or friends of government officials, as it did in many nations.
The third reform was to establish rule of law, a process that took time to develop and involved technical reforms. Examples include reforming courts to handle civil disputes, rooting out corruption, and improving regulatory transparency. Doing that increased foreign investment.
The second reform was to open the economy, removing subsidies, reducing or removing tariffs, and taking other measures to improve competition in business and industry.
Their first reform was monetary reform. To stop hyperinflation, Estonia became the first former Soviet republic to create its own currency, which Estonia pegged to the German Mark.
It's hard to overstress how young the new government in newly democratized Estonia was, too. The minister of the interior was 26. The minister of foreign affairs was 27. The head of government was 32.
Over 90% of Estonia's trade was dependent on Russia in 1992. They were even talking about evacuating the capital because there was expected to not be enough money to buy gas to keep the city warm in the coming winter. It's insane how strongly Estonia rebounded.
When Mart Laar became the leader of Estonia in 1992, the economy was set to decline 30%, unemployment was projected to be 35%, and inflation was 1,000%. He had no economics experience except for reading one Milton Friedman textbook. Within 5 years, the GDP growth rate was 11.8%

The primary reason I hate HOAs is because they're a textbook case of the upper middle class rent seeking. 		Suburban voters revolt against property taxes, then establish HOA's, private governments that only distribute collected taxes among same-income people in the neighborhood.
@TylerMorrisHOU Only structures over 15 years old.		So I'm presuming occupied.
I have a love of municipal policy, but I likely hold the most unelectable policy positions for local government. 		- HOA's are bad 	- Toll Roads are good 	- Upzoning is good 	- Most economic development spending is rent seeking 	- Water fluoridation is good 	- Rent control is bad

@jeastery Good article.		Fracking may be on an unsound financial footing, but it's not going to start a global financial crash, and declines in production are not the same thing as peak oil.
Fracking is a bubble. Balance sheets are making the companies look profitable, even if they are hemorrhaging cash and can only stay afloat if they continue to receive more investment.		As soon as production rates fall enough to where investors pull out, the sector will crash.
Fracking has a terrible secret:		It loses money. Over $270 billion in negative cash flows recorded since 2007.		Its continued expansion has been due to accounting tricks like inflating reserves and understating depreciation, defrauding investors.		https://t.co/3wKVl2kc0T

In general, we don't talk enough about democratic traditions of East Asia. We view it from a sense of illiberalism (monarchy, warlords, Park Chung-hee, Japanese fascism, Maoism), or from a sense of the West "bringing" democracy to Asia. We should talk about the Kongsi republics.

Furthermore, tariffs encouraged industrialization in the Northeast, which served as an economic multiplier.		Tariffs today may be regressive and long-term result in uncompetetive industry, but that was not always the case.
There weren't many other ways to raise revenue at the time. Excise taxes like alcohol taxes hurt the poor disproportionately, and the first income tax wasn't until the Civil War.		Tariffs were about as progressive as you could get.

Is there a single city in human history that had economic and population growth like Schenzhen?		The city's economic growth rate was 40% annually between 1981 and 1993. The city's population was 30,000 in 1980. It's over 12 million today
I don't trust any Democrat who signs on to a "Green New Deal" that promises 100% renewable energy by 2030.		It's a clear signal that they are willing to sign on to something for media attention, but don't actually care about feasibility or pragmatism.

The protection of open space and habitat is often forgotten in the environmental movement, because of the increasingly narrow focus on climate.		Remember, biodiversity freaking matters.		Even if you don't believe so from a moral standpoint, it provides natural services.
Expansion of tourism infrastructure and environmental restoration are not talked about enough as ways to revitalize rural areas.		Rural areas don't have the access and services of urban areas. But they have the natural world around them. Utilize that.

I'm no expert on tax policy, but it seems like a gross receipts tax is a perfect example of a perverse incentive.		It would incentivize higher profit margins from businesses, hurting consumers.
The far-left conflates revenue with profits a lot.		Unions in Oregon tried to pass a gross receipts tax on the ballot in 2016.		Thanks to people pointing out that groceries and lower profit businesses would be decimated, it was resoundingly defeated. https://t.co/ZXaF2LGJ7T

College students:		If you want tuition to not increase rapidly, don't push for minimum wage hikes and expansions to student services.		Yeah, the 24 hour library, rock climbing wall in the gym, and mini-concert at the beginning of term may be nice, but they're raising tuition.
One of the big problems universities face is that big donors love paying for new buildings to put their name on.		The problem is, they don't pay for upkeep and maintenance of the building after construction. The buildings become liabilities for the university over time.
