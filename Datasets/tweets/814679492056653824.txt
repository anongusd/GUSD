@TheRickWilson @thedailybeast Bravo.  Not sure which is more impressive, the writing or your analysis - I guess both are.
@wyethwire @chrislhayes this needs to be plastered on billboards, broadcast on radios, and in general shoved under the noses of the American people.  Personally, I have deactivated my FB page.

@chelseahandler They are going to get us all fucking killed.
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre nuts.  Also a moron.
@McFaul Portola Valley
@McFaul Not likely that a guy with a knife or an axe could kill 17 people before being apprehended.
@McFaul Actually, a guy in Portland Valley CA owned a bunch of ‚Äòem.  Used to scare the crap out of the horses that were boarded at the nearby boarding stables when he shot their cannons.
@sendavidperdue How many dollars in campaign contributions have you accepted from the NRA? If it‚Äôs more than 0, then you shot those kids.  SHAME ON YOU!!!
@Lesdoggg Because you‚Äôre strong, confident and successful.  I recently had a man tell me I shouldn‚Äôt use so many big words around men.  After that I decided I didn‚Äôt need men.
@TimDuy @conorsen @ModeledBehavior Watch ‚ÄúInside Job.‚Äù  I think he didn‚Äôt want to screw the pooch for when he would get out of government.
@NFL You are the worst sort of scum: sacrificing kids so as not to contradict the BS that keeps you solvent and allows you to escape liability for the lives of the athletes who‚Äôve lined your pockets at the expense of their lives.  Shame!!!

@CarmenYulinCruz any effort to use offshore wind turbines underground power lines decentralized grid and/or small turbines and solar panels in individual homes? Conventional infrastructure is Ill-suited to tropical island realities.
@TheRickWilson Can we get him a tiny little moustache too?
@TheRickWilson See @Incognito comment below.
@TheRickWilson Maybe real point was to destroy trust in intelligence community and FBI.  I expect few Trimp (he‚Äôs an orange baboon) supporters will actually read it.
@DrDenaGrayson Please tell us that Ryan, Pence and McConnel are going too?
@SenJohnMcCain You talk the talk but don‚Äôt walk the walk - you are enacting his agenda, and not actively trying to remove him from office.  #talkischeap
@tvonetv @YvonneOrji @UzoAduba @TichinaArnold @marsaimartin @Lesdoggg And this is a very elegant picture.
@tvonetv @Lesdoggg @YvonneOrji @UzoAduba @TichinaArnold @marsaimartin Leslie - I hope it‚Äôs you!  I‚Äôm a big fan.
@DouxDux @TheRickWilson Also he was apparently married.
@TheRickWilson Drake and Clifford too.  45 got around.
@TheRickWilson That‚Äôs all the followers you have?  I‚Äôm shocked it isn‚Äôt more.  You have wonderful insights and a wick d sense of humor, note sorely needed.
@sendavidperdue If your family didn‚Äôt come over on the Mayflower,I suspect they did the same. #TheGOPAreTraitors
@dark_wisdom_ üò≥üò≥üò≥ good point.
@SteveVantsis @sendavidperdue @SenTomCotton He apparently has dementia, and should be removed from office.
@sendavidperdue @SenTomCotton You are full of shit, you treasonous asshole.
@washingtonpost Whataboutism.  Nonetheless, absent mitigating circumstances, this is just as wrong as commuting by jet - just less expensive/more grubby.
@maddow Are you surprised?  I suspect not.
@rebeccaballhaus @maddow I would have been more shocked if it wasn't.
@CarmenYulinCruz Oh Jeezus.  You guys can't catch a break.	Elon Musk should help you implement a de-centralized power grid using solar and wind power (could reduce the force of future hurricanes), w/ underground transmission lines.  Fingers crossed for your guys.
@SethMacFarlane No more science deniers in the white house!!!  Please!!!  I'm not sure she wouldn't be a more palatable version of Trump: arrogant and convinced of her own infallibility, and unwilling to seek the counsel of or defer to people with real expertise.
@altNOAA She may well be a more palatable version of Trump: convinced of her own infallibility and unwilling to listen to real experts. #NoOnTheO
@altNOAA Then there's the non-trivial matter that, given her peddling of pseudo-scientific woo and promotion of people who practice psychology without a license, she is clearly a science denier.  We NEED science to help us solve problems like climate change.
@AHamiltonSpirit It would be awesome if it were Flynn after all...
@maddow I‚Äôm glad the Dems didn‚Äôt waste any time arguing or seeking consensus, but instead acted decisively.
@TheRickWilson @DRUDGE_REPORT She peddles the most egregious pseudo-science imaginable.  Already too much of that with Donny-the-Cheeto (all the old Italian gangsters had slightly pejorative nicknames, and he certainly fits that mold).
@svdate @TheRickWilson Nichole Wallace says whack-a-mole.  Best line I‚Äôve heard on cable news all year.
@RobertReichLove @paulkrugman what do you think of Branco Milanovic‚Äôs ideas that higher quality public education and increasing employees‚Äô ownership stakes are better tools for addressing income inequality than more school and restoring unions?
@ClemsonColorado @ckassis @brianefallon @nickconfessore @mmurraypolitics No you lame-brains. RVH‚Äôs point is that I like 2016, the Dems will not shoot themselves in the foot by dividing themselves.
@samswey Right now I‚Äôm willing to vote for an older white man if it means taking back the White House.  Let‚Äôs put out the dumpster fire that the GOP has created first, then we can see about getting a woman of color into the White House.
@tribelaw Maybe someone has something on Ryan that‚Äôs worse than whatever the Russians have on him.  Which you can be sure they do.
@ericgarland Notably, you didn't try and lie about it being true - unlike the current administration.
@ericgarland Only if it didn't show the gorillas fighting  But they are reputed to be relatively gentle animals (if not pissed off), so I'd be surprised if much footage of that exists.
@ericgarland The post was highly entertaining, and totally plausible.
@realDonaldTrump Keep telling yourself that.  I can't wait to see your perp walk, and then see you in a prison uniform that will match your make-up. #45WillHangForTreason #45WillDieInJail

@lawhorn06 I'm not so sure, at at any rate he is just as lacking in morals and compassion.

@lawhorn06 Oh please oh please oh please...	Actually, I'm wondering if instead, Ryan told Rosenstein to stand down "or else"?

We see what you‚Äôre doing	(1) refuses signing tax bill unless small concession made 	(2) even smaller concession made 	(3) signs bill 	(4) admits shit bill does.

@AnneWorner @SaylesJon @margaritateresa @JoyAnnReid @malinablue @nytmike Watch it - many of us are Democrats, and sometimes grudges are warranted.
@reeve_geary @TheRickWilson 2 probably smothered him.
@TheRickWilson I like public edCAUTION.  If it was funded adequately, that‚Äôs what it would do: teach people to be critical thinkers who would be cautious about accepting bullshit propaganda such as is spewed by Trump and his minions.
@CVoellinger @TheRickWilson If he could care less, he would.  But I think he couldn‚Äôt.  üòâ
@TheRickWilson I kinda like public edCAUTION.  Because if it were adequately funded, that‚Äôs one thing it would do: teach people to be cautious about accepting bullshit propaganda from the GOP - and anyone else that spews it.

@Khanoisseur My medical expenses in 2016 were $750,000.  That included 6 infusions of a drug that cost $84,000 per infusion.  I am kept alive by a drug that is $10,000 per month.  Without the ACA, I would have been bankrupt then dead soon after my diagnosis.  @BarackObama, bless you.

@roger_duggins @SenKamalaHarris Because, dumb-ass, for insurance premiums to remain affordable for everyone, young healthy people have to pay in so that benefits are available th e when they‚Äôre old and having health issues.  That‚Äôs how insurance works.
@SenKamalaHarris 9.2 mil last year, 9mil this year enrolled. Maybe people are motivated more by the carrot (affordable health insurance) than the stick (tax fine for not participating)? If so I‚Äôm not surprised - and I‚Äôm happy!
@realDonaldTrump You are exactly right - Fox and Breitbart and not reporting the truth.
@SpeakerRyan Many of us will have a sense of wonder about whether we‚Äôll have food in or stomachs or roofs over our head.  You traitorous fuck.
@MarkSalter55 @christmas_brent @paulkrugman How else to explain their voting for something so cruel (ultimately) and fiscally irresponsible, unless she perpetrates further cruelty on the American people by voting to destroy Medicare and steal Social Security?
@JoeSammonsAnew @Sliebs69 @paulkrugman a thoughtful asshole is still an asshole.  And she is an asshole for voting for something so downright cruel as this bill is.
@Sliebs69 @paulkrugman The best defense is always a good offense.  And her vote is at least as offensive as her claims of sexism
@jazzmessenger @LouiseMensch @spurscad @jbchuman @paulkrugman Maybe not - apparently participants are motivated more by the carrot (affordable insurance) ithan the stick (tax penalties for nonoarticipants.  In other words, the mandate is in large part irrelevant.
@paulkrugman @MalcolmNance Maybe the Russians payed her off.  Or threatened her.
@maddow They represent the greatest potential for incriminating Donny-the-Cheeto?
@YoMellyMel @JodiRankin1 @realDonaldTrump Keep drinkin‚Äô that Koolade. You clearly aren‚Äôt aware of the copious economic studies that show corporate tax cuts benefit shareholders and executives. The extra money is never invested nor used to create jobs.
@realDonaldTrump Commrad Trump, you are nothing but a useful idiot to both the GOP and the Russians.  #45WillDieInJail #DJTprisonbitch wait‚Äôll you see how it feels to be fucked up the ass.
@SpeakerRyan You ducking poor excuse for an American.  You should be deported straight to Russia, to see what living in a kleptocracy is like. Maybe then you‚Äôll think twice about being Trump‚Äôs bitch.
@SenatorStrange @POTUS You are a fine example of the lying GOP liars and the lies they tell.  Go straight to hell.

@WSJ @wsj Each class needs only one professor to lecture a huge number of students crammed in a big lecture hall, and grade just a single test to determine the final grade.  Acceptance criteria are designed to accept 20% more students than the school intends to graduate.  Shameful.

@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 17/ drafted a bill that substitutes a corporate agenda for sound public policy based on verifiable facts. The bill will cause real financial damage to a large number of citizens - although prospective, that harm is monetary, measurable and not speculative.	&lt;END&gt;
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 16/ By shutting out the Democrats, not allowing debate, and failing to obtain expert testimony or bonafide public input, the Republicans have denied representation to constituents of Democrats, have acted on behalf of people who didn‚Äôt elect them, and
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 15/ Nor doesn‚Äôt it reflect any of the input or debate that characterizes a bonafide effort to represent the interests of the electorate and embody sound public policy.
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 14/ The bill is not the product of a legitimate exercise of power by the people who drafted it and finalized it.
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 13/ an illegal exercise of power by Republican legislators that exceeded the scope of their Constitutional authority.
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 12/ written by a man who is beholden to corporate interest and appointed for the purpose of advancing their agendas. 	Drafting the tax bill outside of regular order and without full participation of all the member states in both houses, was therefore
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson	11/ the conclusions of the OMB regarding the likely effects on the economy and the deficit were completely ignored in favor of a laughable one-page report that assumed what it purported to prove,
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson	10/ The current tax bill had none of that. The bill was drafted in secret by Republicans only, the provisions were not subject to debate or modification by Democrats, no expert testimony was obtained, and
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 	9/ information-gathering from experts where appropriate, real opportunity for public input, consideration of policy findings by non-partisan committees, and perhaps most importantly, vigorous debate.
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson	 8/ So, prerequisites for the legislative process to be legitimate exercise of power, and for the resulting laws to be Constitutional, are that the legislative process involves full participation of ALL members of both houses in drafting &amp;/or amending it,
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 	7/ full participation of the electorate as a whole, through participation of ALL Representatives and Senators in crafting it.
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 	6/ an understanding the underlying issues and consideration of the potential consequences for the entire electorate, not just special interests, and
@SethAbramson 5/ It is obviously impractical for all members of both houses to draft bills, however implicit in the way the legislative process is designed is that bills should be the result of a bona fide effort to embody sound public policy, which requires
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 	4/ The people from other districts are represented by the representatives who were elected to represent them.
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 	3/ Our Constitution provides for a federal government with limited powers. The Legislative branch is meant to represent the people. Each representative‚Äôs power is limited to representing the interests of the people in the district that elected home or her.
@SethAbramson @SethAbramson 	2/ any debate on its merits, or any testimony by experts.
@SethAbramson 	1/ (thread) I think there is a strong argument to be made that the tax bill, if enacted, is invalid because it violates the Constitution, and it does so because the legislation was drafted entirely without any participation by the Democrats,
@EliezelCarrasco @realDonaldTrump Pack your bags, sweetheart, and good riddance.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Nor do you ever read a book.
@realDonaldTrump They most certainly did the right thing.  #wawawaaaaa

@MikeSkory @michael_w_busch @mauggie @SenFeinstein If you believe that then you are a special kind of stupid.

@ericgarland Why a PD - are all his assets frozen, or did he just not have time to find an attorney because Mueller team moving fast?

@SarahPalinUSA Given that you have only an 8th grade education, you should just shut. the fuck. up.

@SpeakerRyan Medals aren't roofs/meals/medical care.  You are a fucking traitorous hypocrite.
@JudgeJeanine RU KIDDING?! DJT Jr. was happy to meet with Russians (ILLEGAL) to get dirt on Hillary.  You're not just a hypocrite - you're a traitor.
@SpeakerRyan Did you type that with a straight face?  There are nearly 50,000 homeless veterans in the US.  Remembrance is worthless without support.

@Khanoisseur @TrueFactsStated @20committee 5/ he'll take Trump down, and Trump can't escape.
@Khanoisseur @TrueFactsStated @20committee Then he'll flip them and gather direct on Trump, who won't be able to destroy his leverage b/c Trump won't be able to pardon his cronies.

@grantrobertb @RonWyden @SenateGOP Libertarianism is fundamentally unsound. We need gov't to pay for infrastructure, public ed (benefits society) envivornmental regs etc.
@grantrobertb @RonWyden @SenateGOP governments are not business - they exist to benefit citizens not turn a profit. privatization is anathema to that.
@grantrobertb @RonWyden @SenateGOP Single payer best - money not going to pay salaries &amp; bonuses of ins Co execs; also leverage to negotiate pharmaceutical prices.
@grantrobertb @RonWyden @SenateGOP I'm not - still have cancer. Obamacare is imperfect, but let's fix it not kick millions off insurance to give tax breaks. That's kleptocracy
@grantrobertb @RonWyden @SenateGOP And oh yah - my medication is $120,000 per year.  I'll take it indefinitely.
@grantrobertb @RonWyden @SenateGOP Less than $10,00 per year.  I had over $500,000 in medical bills in 2013, of which I paid $4,000. I'd say the ROI was pretty good.
@SpeakerRyan I'm going to die of cancer if the ACA is repealed.  I know you don't give a shit, but I thought I'd mention it.
@Broadsword_6 Stay in school kids.
@grantrobertb @RonWyden @SenateGOP Yah no. I couldn't get health insurance before.  Obamacare prevented me from dying of cancer.  Trumpcare will be literally a death sentence.

@SarahPalinUSA shut your pie hole and go away and stay there.
@RachelLarris @ericgarland See Dr. Garland's tweets made contemporaneously w/ SEssions testimony, to whit: "I had a stroke."  "I'm having a stroke right now."  etc.
@SpeakerRyan @repdavidkustoff Start acting like it, you traitor.
@Broadsword_6 what's a rendition?  Asking for a friend, since I don't want to reveal what a dumb-ass I am.
@EWErickson chicken/egg.
@SarahPalinUSA Your social media presence qualifies you.  Get a better lawyer.
@SarahPalinUSA @nytopinion Sorry - once a public figure, always a public figure.  You need a better lawyer.
@realDonaldTrump They should call it a warlock hunt.  And you're the warlock.  And they will catch you.  And you will die in jail.
@realDonaldTrump You are a traitor.  You will die in jail.  Or hang.  I'm rooting for the latter.  (Google "latter").
@SethAbramson Why not use FB or some other type of scoial media that doesn't limit you to 140 characters?  Tedious to follow long threads.
@speculawyer @SkinnyDogDesign @TheRickWilson Purely a matter of goods, how effective a brand identifier, and associations created in consumers' minds.
@paulkrugman Nowhere and everywhere.  You're Schroedingers economist.
@SkinnyDogDesign @TheRickWilson IP lawyer here - TMs relevant only in context of product/services branding.  Copyrights an option.
@RachelMaddowSho Please consider making statement re: Megan Kelly's Alex Jones interview. Profit-driven "journalism" that got Trump elected.
@ThePlumLineGS @washingtonpost Apparently that "cloak of secrecy" is a bit threadbare.
@therealroseanne I am MASSIVELY disappointed.  I thought you were smarter than this.  History will prove Donny-the-cheers &amp;a GOP traitors.
@SarahPalinUSA Fake news.she is no GOP apparatchik.
@SarahPalinUSA Traitor.
@SarahPalinUSA I hope you choke.
@Cats4Lunch @LoisCWinkler @Broadsword_6 Bilbo Bigot.
@jk_rowling @Rosie I can think of a more deserving victim.
@AnnFowlerAvery @20committee Never too late.  It gets easier once you pass 50.
@Anon0Mouse @Broadsword_6 Know what else makes us look bad? Bickering about stupid stuff that distracts from resisting the fast-advancing Trump autocracy.
@Anon0Mouse @PrincessBaklava @w4rd @Broadsword_6 It's incongruous and funny and he wasn't bragging.  Lighten up.
@Anon0Mouse @Broadsword_6 great parents can differ. Some data correlates cussing w/ hi IQ. Son scolds me for cussing in public. More important things to worry about.
@stephencree @KERRY_LL0YD @SenKamalaHarris I know torch = flashlight, but image of Bilbo Bigot fumbling around his netherparts with a kerosene lamp made me laugh out loud.
@Beth_Cox_2 @EpiphanyPoet @Andy @Mikel_Jollett Um - the handicapped guy mocking thing?
@Beth_Cox_2 @Andy @Mikel_Jollett getting back to the mocking a handicapped thing for a moment...
@IvankaTrump You were saying? https://t.co/iLf0KJSxxr
@Spicerlies @jeffsessions I think to hold in contempt in context of congressional hearing, testimony must be pursuant to a subpoena
@ericgarland That moment when you realize that even China's ethics are better than the Trump administration's.  üò°üò•	We're doomed.
@CaliKingfisher @SarahBKHere @yangstigram @butlerfetish @matthewamiller Wrong.
@SarahBKHere @yangstigram @CaliKingfisher @butlerfetish @matthewamiller First listen to Angus King and Henreich, and tell me how they're different.
@matthewamiller @RepDonBeyer She's smart and aggressive, so they need to treat her like an uppity black woman cause they have no other way to attack her.
@TonyHealy4 @SethAbramson Also he was not testifying pursuant to a subpoena.
@senecatrust @SethAbramson They can't unless under a subpoena.
@rdonevans4_don @RMJunkie @SethAbramson Destroy it?  Wow.
@SarahPalinUSA You traitor.
@SenKamalaHarris Schroedinger's privilege &lt;&lt;nerd joke&gt;&gt;
@KamalaHarris No matter how many times one is treated with disrespect, no matter how tough &amp; experienced you are, it must still sting.
@KamalaHarris If he had any brains, he'd resign, lawyer up, and start squealing.
@KamalaHarris Memo to GOP: No assertive questioning of white males by uppity black women.  		Obviously they're scared of you. Great job.  You're my shero.
@PalmerReport I love her, but too many Americans will refuse a female president. Let's get WH and congress back first.
@JoyAnnReid @MalcolmNance Cotton I mean.
@JoyAnnReid @MalcolmNance Scumbag lying liar apparatchik.
@Broadsword_6 Bilbo Bigot is a lying liar apparatchik scumbag.
@SethAbramson He did ask about written policies re: protecting confidential communications
@mitchellreports @IvankaTrump Why on earth do people assume she has a soul?
@SarahPalinUSA Shut your pie hole, traitor whore.
@ericgarland Longstanding policy doesn't give right to refuse to answer.  This douchebag.
@DavidCornDC Which is different from not doin it.
@JudgeJeanine @jeffsessions You GOP slut whore.  Go suck Trumps dick some more.
@Spicerlies Was that a threat to defund IC if Russia investigation continues?
@washingtonpost What has this woman done to improve the world that would merit $1,000,000 per DAY?	#corporateUSisnotyourfriend
@Spicerlies Seth Abramson @SethAbramson	"...he can't assert executive privilege unless he can represent the WH told him to."
@Spicerlies I have cancer -Dax's at Stage IV.  Without the ACA, I'm a dead woman.
@Spicerlies They know a good thing when they have one.  Keep tweeting. I hope all those GOP mfuckers choke.
@MichelleObama Here's what one of the first woman tech entrepreneurs accomplished: https://t.co/IcImc487qJ
@Spicerlies A whole other set of incredibly valuable and essential skills.
@Spicerlies So my brother.  I could never do what you do.  I tried, and got fired after 3 weeks.
@Spicerlies That's cheap.
@Spicerlies $450/hr
@Spicerlies I'm a lawyer (patent)  too and lots of our bad rap is deserved.  3 years in law school, an MS too, &amp; I need to live.  Not sorry for $45/hr.
@th3j35t3r A little head bashing works wonders towards subduing enemies of the state.  Permanently.
@Spicerlies Firms charge a differential for administrative tasks to cover overhead and yes because they are in a for-profit business.
@WSJ @EPAScottPruitt I'm skeptical. Another spineless trump minion with no balls, &amp; in the pocket of the industry he's supposed to oversee, just like the rest.
@realDonaldTrump You traitor.  I hope you choke.  You will die in jail.  Can't wait to see you be someone's prison bitch.
@realDonaldTrump Your traitorous prick.  You'll die in jail if someone doesn't kill you first.
@jaketapper Obstruction of justice seems to be in the job description for Trump's minions.
@EricBoehlert @susanemoney I hope they keep him there and put him in the zoo with all the other exotic critters.  He is one dumb bastard.
@TheRickWilson Kim Jong Dong.  Free free to use that.
@TrueFactsStated MT was actually a scumbag - read Christopher Hitchen's book.
@McFaul @IvankaTrump What a dimwitted bimbo. Oh yeah, and a traitor.
@SarahPalinUSA you lying traitorous Jezebel. #deathtotraitors #45willdieinjail
@SarahPalinUSA You're a traitor.  Also a moron.  And nuts.  And a TERRIBLE mother.  0 for 4.
@realDonaldTrump 1) not illegal to reveal non-classified notes; 2) if it's a leak, that means its true. You're a lawyer's nightmare: dumb and a blabbermouth.
@SpeakerRyan So how 'bout funding VA hospitals and programs for vets? Or does that get in the way of tax breaks for your buddies.
@realDonaldTrump Hey dumb-ass. The economy is showing the effects of OBAMA'S work. Also, bills are different than EO's.  You must have ditched Civics classes
@VP @POTUS You are a gay traitor, Putin's cock holster, and no Christian.
@SarahPalinUSA You shameless traitor.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends #thetrumpswilldieinjail
@lpackard I had over a half million dollars of medical expenses in 2016 - the ACA paid all but $4,000.
@lpackard Quite variable. I have SLL, treated with rituxan (6 treatments @ $84,000 ea.) and ibrutinib ($120,000 per year). Trial pays for ibrutinib.
@lpackard Oh I misread.  Treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma are much better than for non-Hodgkin (that's what I have).  Good luck.   Rooting for you.
@cheisenfelt @meechebucco @lpackard @shannoncoulter Go suck Putin's dick.
@cheisenfelt @lpackard @shannoncoulter In what universe?
@lpackard I do too.  Sending good juju your way.  Consider a clinical trial - DM if you want more info.
@SarahPalinUSA You are a traitor. #deathtotraitors #45willdieinjail
@TheRickWilson what is your position on Obamacare?  I'm self-employed &amp;I have cancer.  If I don't have insurance, I'm bankrupt then dead.
@JudgeJeanine @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump is a traitor.  #deathtotraitors 45willdieinjail
@JudgeJeanine You're a moron.  Check out @ericgarland 's thread on what Donny-the-Cheeto's REALLY been up to. #45isatraitor #45willdieinjail
@ericgarland Oh PLEASE let mcconnel be somebody's prison bitch...
@ericgarland I don't understand what you are trying to say here, but then, I'm not that bright.
@mirandadied4u @beerwxsports @bonitarosekemp @TrueFactsStated @NoConversions We needed some good PR for a change.
@bran_mac117 @ChinaFile Correction: wombat.  Otherwise, Id.
@bran_mac117 @ChinaFile Koala.  Probably.  Nothing is sacred with them.
@PressSec If you don't abandon the Trump train now, you're even stupider than I thought.
@HeyHeySarahJNE @JeremyConQueso @mattzap @maggieNYT Only when it's annuppoyy nlacknwoman asking.  	&lt;&lt;sarcasm - Kamala is my shero&gt;&gt;
@ericgarland We went off track with Raygun; hope we return to our post-WWII selves and stay there.  Most of my tribe never left - I hang with good peeps.
@ericgarland Oh please tell me there's some on McConnel.  I hate him with a white hot passion.  If I wasn't  an old lady with cancer I'd kill him myself.
@CDReisswriter @ericgarland I don't remember hearing ANYTHING about this from MSM.  Not. One. Fucking. Thing.
@lemonseinfeld @ericgarland Or maybe a diversion, because there's still more work to be done to make case? 		Hope springs eternal...
@alt_labor @SecretaryAcosta why is that a pejorative?
@SarahPalinUSA The real story is that Donny-the-Cheetoh attempted to obstruct justice.  Ms. Palin, you are no patriot.  What you are, is a moron.
@SethAbramson Probably some clause in his prenup
@Reuters Whatever.
@TrueFactsStated If under federal law,  all he needs is admission pro hac vice.  Any US attorney can practice federal law.
@SeekerofTruth0 @Rosie @DonaldJTrumpJr They do, but fix the ACA, dont throw 42 million Americans under bus &amp; give huge tax cuts to insurance execs. Do you know AHCA does that?
@maddow That ain't how the GOP will spin it.  He looked unwell and confused.  Doesn't bode well.
@SarahPalinUSA You are a traitor.  #deathtotraitors.
@SeekerofTruth0 @Rosie @DonaldJTrumpJr It didn't double premiums etc. Concessions made to GOP so it could pass did. Co-ops tanked, premiums high b/c uncertainty created.
@SeekerofTruth0 @Rosie @DonaldJTrumpJr I have cancer and am alive without being bankrupt because of the ACA.
@alt_labor cockroach, looks like.  There're many different species.
@JonNiola @shannonsaul1 @20committee Many miles beteeen the lines here.
@20committee Maybe the gloves will come off this afternoon.
@DavidCornDC Traitors.  Obstructing justice.  Cowards most of all.
@SpeakerRyan #45isatraitorandsoareyou #deathtotraitors #youwildieinjail
@SpeakerRyan You fuckers.  We're coming for you.
@Yair_Rosenberg @CAIRNational @AnshelPfeffer @jkirchick Unless you're someone who values universal healthcare.  then it's the smart thing to do.
@SpeakerRyan that's what happens when you intentionally create uncertainty for the insurance companies, asshole.  See you tomorrow afternoon.
@SpeakerRyan I'll be in DC tomorrow. You can tell me personally that I should die from my cancer because I can't afford insurance without the ACA.
@realDonaldTrump Kirkland represents RJ Reynolds.  Sad if firm representing company that kills millions, refuses to represent you.
@realDonaldTrump Go home, you're drunk.  #45isatraitor #deathtotraitors #allthetrumpswilldieinjail
@TheNewTiresias @TrueFactsStated How 'bout just invalidate the electoral college and put HRC where she should already be.
@20committee Israeli attack designed to destroy surveillance revealing their plan for attacking Syria despite acceptance of cease-fire?
@SarahPalinUSA You mean your smutty daughter who had a kid out of wedlock despite your religious posturing?  #PalinisapuppetoftheGOP
@realDonaldTrump They are for sure saying how dumb YOU are. #45isaytaitor #deathtotraitors #45willdieinjail
@realDonaldTrump #45isatraitor #deathtotraitors #45willdieinjail
@realDonaldTrump @susanemoney So you've talked to them.  What else did they say?
@SarahPalinUSA You are a moron.  Please go far away, and then stay there.
@TomiLahren You are a moron.  Please go away, and then stay there.
@TrueFactsStated I'm fortunate: my family and friends have brains, and commone sense, and a fully developed sense of compassion. How 2 reach those who don't?
@ddale8 45 is a moron.  The sky is blue.
@CrystalR95123 On what basis do you say this?  Have you accounted for decrease in copays, deductibles, costs that aren't covered?  Where's. The. Data?
@CrystalR95123 Sounds like something an insurance company shill would say.
@AltHHS @Alt_CDC That last part isn't in the GOP's vocabulary.  It assumes compassion.
@JamieMcCall @MalcolmNance I can't wait to see 45's temper tantrum.
@theoannemerry @dparkinson45 @JoyAnnReid And how was he stupid enough that there is any?
@JoyAnnReid @MalcolmNance The GOP is a bunch of scumbags.  Full stop.
@McFaul $$$ and that's it.
@realDonaldTrump I hope you die.
@realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  @EricTrump You bunch of scum-sucking greedy asshole traitors.  #45isatraitor #deathtotraitors
@TrueFactsStated Me too.
@20committee At least Kathy has a sense of humor.  Which wasn't evident from the head thing.
@20committee When was the last time a traitor was executed - the Rosenbergs?
@washingtonpost She is smart and funny and she calls out BS.
@RadioSasquatch @President_Mommy you first.
@SarahPalinUSA The only thing there is for Hannity to expose is his Johnson.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He wasn't picking on Barron, you stupid moron - he was calling your father expired deli meat.  Keep up.
@PalmerReport Hey Donny Jr.: don't bring a knife to a gun fight.  #traitor
@realDonaldTrump You, your family members, your administration, and a good % of GOP are TRAITORS.  #deathtotraitors #45willdieinjail
@Lawrence Third time in as many days.  She's ok, hopefully.
@SarahPalinUSA "Cons" is right.  Trickle-down economics, the AHCA, and all the rest of it is the biggest con job this country has ever seen.
@Chimera_Gothic @SethAbramson I have health insurance under the ACA.  I didn't before.  HOW did he destroy America? Or is that just what someone told you to think/say?
@SethAbramson Is there ALREADYcivil war? white nationalists + fundamentalist christians + corporate interests + ultra wealthy, vs. educated liberals?
@SethAbramson More than one person has suggested the pace of investigations is glacial to avoid civil war.
@Spicerlies The time for snark was when he followed you around the stage; shoulda looked at him and asked, "what ARE you doing, Don?"
@RadioSasquatch @President_Mommy You're like 14, right?
@Brenda_Duk @Rosie @jaketapper Both are political speech, which our Constitution affords the most protection.  But I don't like that sort of thing either.
@Rosie @jaketapper Hatred of Trump shouldn't make us forget that 2 wrongs etc.  But I hope he's drawn and quartered then hung up on meat hooks on the WH lawn.
@PeterPrinciple2 @20committee Umm,big they are federal employees, wouldn't they OPPOSE outsourcing?
@20committee This policy, and others like it, are how the Dems sold out.
@Rosie @DonaldJTrumpJr If the AHCA, he'll cause the deaths of many more. 0
@Gibberishone @ScottAdamsSays Yes, she did.  In a way that accepted responsibility vs. dismissing other, implicitly, for being thin-skinned. #45willdieinjail
@SenatorStrange @POTUS B/c we need to decimate fish stocks faster than we already are.  The GOP is immoral and the handmaiden of corporate interests.  And Putin.
@james_o_photo @paulkrugman You're a moron who doesn't understand science.  I say that with the utmost respect.
@HypocrisyNowCO @paulkrugman Stats that the contribution of individuals is minimal - corporate entities and commercial agriculture, China, and India account for most.
@ericgarland Is it possible that the delay reflects efforts to bring the largest number of trai... er, people possible to justice?
@nazani14 @ericgarland You are a bigger person than I - respect.
@ericgarland It really sucks that I'll not be able to get treatment for my cancer. Tell my son the GOP win is worth not having a mom, 'k?
@Broadsword_Six @TrueFactsStated @20committee Think NOAA deleted all the responses to 45's #covfefe tweet before he deleted it?
@Mean_Adam @Rosie And contact congress if the collective's has gone on more than 100 days. Maybe some of the Repub members will finally give a sh*t.
@espiers @Rosie Sadly they won't read it, or care. There's been a species divergence in our lifetime.
@washingtonpost Shame on you WaPo. Gratuitous footage of a child suffering a debilitating disease unnecessary  to tell the girl's story or her parents'.
@SarahPalinUSA When will you tire of being a laughing stock?

@heinen69 @M_R_1977 @KarenEDeering @RepAdamSchiff PSA: stay in school kids, or else you'll end up an illiterate Twitter troll, like this mook.
@SarahPalinUSA Not as sick as throwing 42 million Americans off of healthcare insurance.
@kylegriffin1 @Rosie nevertheless, covfefe persisted.
@reidepstein @EliStokols grammar much?
@RVAwonk @Rosie and conservatives STILL give her shit.  Geesh.  Some people.
@Rosie Trump likes Ikea!  Who knew?
@hierroyluz @JustinCaffier @jules_su @midnight0r0ra @realDonaldTrump ohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohplease...
@realDonaldTrump Despite the opulence of his Trump Tower penthouse, 45 lusts for Ikea.
@NamasteCathy @JeffGrubb @realDonaldTrump I think I speak for the country when I say, EWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!  Because you know he typed this on the toilet.
@Niki7a @Jaku Nevertheless.  Still.
@drmistercody @realDonaldTrump This question assumes that he is EVER OK.  And you know what they say about making assumptions...
@drmistercody @realDonaldTrump Let's hope not.

@Fusion Cov-FEE-fay.  It's too good for kids.
@bdgrabinski @realDonaldTrump It will inspire more great comedy than all of the Trump SNL skits combined.
@bdgrabinski @realDonaldTrump apparently he didn't hire from top-tier schools.

@spbuck61 @oliverdarcy @kathygriffin @realDonaldTrump Just as soon as he apologizes to Rosie O'Donnel.
@Rockwell @oliverdarcy @allahpundit @kathygriffin How great do you look without make-up?  Assuming you're over 30.
@husseymichael @oliverdarcy @Popehat @kathygriffin Classy.
@oliverdarcy @kathygriffin Mad respect for apologizing.  Most people wouldn't have.
@DDiamond411 @mitchellreports @McFaul Obstruction, however reprehensible, is not treason.
@DDiamond411 @mitchellreports @McFaul Actually, I never watch CNN.
@kylegriffin1 @ericgarland @RichardEngel Because look where our own safeguards got us.
@kathygriffin new hair style is awesome. I went to OPRF too, and we had PE together - tough to swim while I was laughing hysterically.

@RanttNews @susanemoney @realDonaldTrump 4,999,999?  Give or take.
@MikeLevinCA @DarrellIssa JUMP!!!
@SarahPalinUSA A bit over the top.  What's sicker? Throwing Americans off of health insurance.
@SpeakerRyan @RepWalberg @dreamfound If you're still planning on getting the AHCA enacted, you should have just strangled him then and there.
@DDiamond411 @mitchellreports @McFaul Clinton's conversation wasn't treasonous. Trump et al.'s communications very well could be. #45willdieinjail
@McFaul Certainly squares with use of fake news, and approach in other countries.  Susceptibility of Trump et al.  is a bonus.
@Crushers_Coach @mitchellreports @McFaul You're a bot.
@Jenny_Jenny1008 @mitchellreports @McFaul That's why she is an award - winning journalist- she doesn't.
@DDiamond411 @mitchellreports @McFaul False equivalence.  Google it.
@McFaul Maybe Russians figured Kishner could keep his mouth shut/refrain from Tweeting.
@mitchellreports @McFaul Perhaps BECAUSE he wan't part of inner circle, thereby attenuating impact on Trump if meeting was discovered?
@reverendkoosh @LynEpar @remmingtondrod @EdRT @thehowie @RepAdamSchiff B/c work benefits or don't participate in ACA?  OK with me IF you stay out once you're sick.  Do you understand how insurance works?
@RepAdamSchiff How many people will die, such as cancer patients like me. Dx'd at Stage IV, life-saving drug costs $120,000 annually. W/out ACA, I'm dead.
