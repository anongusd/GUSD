@mare6367 @kylegriffin1 Just because she is a woman does not make her immune to proper behavior. Even if every Senate male was just as big a an asshole, it would not make her behavior correct.  There is no equivalency test where this behavior is acceptable. Ever hear of Obama mistreating anyone ever?

@shaunacoralee Hey did God write that thing? If not then you don't need to follow it like it is a set of marching orders. if a single human being had a hand in its creation it is just words now.
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump You are pretty great...and I dunno which horse you are backing...but I am excited to see the candidates start to differentiate themselves from one another. As an example I have no idea why @SenGillibrand is running...
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump Lol so did Bernie, I guess not enough. Still Trump won without spending much money, with a poor organization, on the strength of twitter and massive rallies and 30 years of demonization of HRC by the Republicans, She was also an exceptionally poor candidate to be honest
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump Fine yes vote for whoever in the primaries, hell waste a vote on Tulsi if you want to if she is even on the ballot by the time it rolls on to your state (which is doubtful), thanks for clarifying!!! https://t.co/78PReFCuzb
@Badababa @brycejacksoncvt @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC Bub you being so mean. I hope you don't think there is an award for snark on twitter?
@brycejacksoncvt @Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC Hey I got a big backyard come on down...you would need to like dogs though. I;ll cover your taxes just for the entertainment value
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump Tell that to Donald Trump, he rallied Hillary into early retirement
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump I don't believe you would not vote for @BernieSanders in the general. I can't believe someone like you would stay home. Anyone that would do that, IMO, is not true progressive but is captured by bitterness and a slave to the pain of 2016.
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 Ah thanks much better hashtag #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump SO push your candidate, I totally respect that. But I will tell you as a pretty keen political observer that Warren can't win, Tulsi can't win, Castro cannot win, Pete can't win, Gillibrand can't win and yet I will watch the debates and listen to their prescription for the nation
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 Ahhh now you making me blush. Please let's all agree to #SupportWhoeverTheDemNominee2020
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump 2/2 who personally I think has wonderful policies but has already shot her own dick off with the Native American self inflicted wound. Don't get me wrong, I am undecided as to who to support but we owe so much to @BernieSanders-he has pushed the party to the left
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump 1/2 Who cares if he is a Democrat? Plenty of shitty Democrats out there. He is running for the Democratic nomination for President. Sounds like he isn't Party Apparatchik enough for you. Sanders has a much broader path to victory than Tulsi who won't make it to SC or Warren
@MadisonKittay @_WeStandUnited @BeatlesCat Shame on you for even postulating such nonsense. Might as well vote for Trump then eh if ends up a choice between bernie and trump. At least the White House would not have to change the stationary
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 You two ladies ARE HILARIOUS...cliche really...I hope that didn't sound sexist, I've seen two men do the"my dick is bigger thing too". It is funnier when two ladies do it though. Equality, women can play the bigger dick contest too! I love it https://t.co/iLBWWI8ozu
@_WeStandUnited @one4REALchange @abigailstern1 So nice to see progressives/liberals who should be united picking each other apart. You never @BernieSanders types are a problem. @realDonaldTrump is going to pick at the scab till it gets infected. You should, imo, promote your own candidate and not trash ANY Demo nominee
@_WeStandUnited He sure fooled a lot of people in 2016. Hey are you allowed to critique the personality of male candidates because if we do it with women candidates that is considered sexist.
@brycejacksoncvt @Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC Yeah NH is kind of the crazy step Uncle of states, nobody would know it existed if it didn't have the first in the nation primary
@Beltology @PhyddleDD I thought Star is Born is once of the most engaging, sweet, sad movies I have ever seen. Then I saw Bohemina Rhapsody and was blown away. Toss up for me, they are both sensational works. I lean towards Star is Born as it is more nuanced to me.
@brycejacksoncvt @Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC Yet government grows every year regardless of who the President is. I can’t see that changing in the near future. There us too much that cannot be done at an individual or micro collective environment.
@Badababa @brycejacksoncvt @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC It distresses me to see conversations turn personal. I respect everyone’s right to disagree. The fact that no libertarian candidate ever gets a meaningful vote share would tend to make me believe thats not a direction the world is moving towards regardless of incremental growth
@brycejacksoncvt @Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC That’s unrealistic and not practiced anywhere nor will it be. Why you couldn’t even tax people to pay for roads, schools, hospitals under your libertarian nirvana
@brycejacksoncvt @Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC Doesn’t matter what you choose, you live here. And in America we have certain limits out on our freedoms. Pretty sure all countries do the same to different degrees.

‘He is not going to be the nominee’: Dems slam Sanders over Maduro stance - POLITICO. Interesting take...surprised to see Warren supporting the overthrowing of Maduro. Bernie’s stance is principled...it may not be the right stance but I reword him for it. https://t.co/5k5ePWDygv
@Khelevaster_ @native719 @WakingUpFrank @RealTimBlack @AndrewYangVFA Right is right, there is no left and right when it comes to social justice and equality. Not in my book. Everyone can be a warrior for what is morally right
@native719 @Khelevaster_ @WakingUpFrank @RealTimBlack @AndrewYangVFA I don’t think the minimum wage applies to tipped employees does it? It never  has before
@mutex7 @mtracey An ejection is not a coup. If Maduro has the love of the people as he clams then he will win. Is this not so?
@mutex7 @mtracey That makes sense but at this point it may be that the ship has sailed. Maduro should call for new elections. The people are certainly suffering whether caused by Maduro or not. What else can happen to resolve things peacefully?
@native719 @Khelevaster_ @WakingUpFrank @RealTimBlack @AndrewYangVFA To view Bernie like Trump makes me doubt your commitment to social justice and your sense. But I am interested in yang and am halfway through his book right now
@Khelevaster_ @native719 @WakingUpFrank @RealTimBlack @AndrewYangVFA here here
@kolys @jasm_jo @OhNoSheTwitnt @BernieSanders I could not agree more and I will also be voting for #WhoeverTheDemNomineeIs2020 I think we gotta put dem in there too eh?
@mutex7 @mtracey Right but that does not say why Maduro created a rump organization to invalidate the National Assembly which was not only duly elected but was in opposition to his government, you know like how the Democrats oppose Trump here in the states
@adribbleofink Shapeless, shiftless, soundless, so he had been described. He had a certain quality of impermanence so that upon leaving none could really be sure that he had been there at all. Even light seemed to bend around him so that staring 2 long at the Gray Man was said to hurt ones eyes

@native719 @rustyy @NicholasBonjour @_TsunDairy_ @AndrewYangVFA Id never get UBI then....booo.....
@mutex7 @mtracey David what none can explain to me is the dissolution of the legitimately elected National Assembly by the constitutional assembly-which was boycotted by all the opposition and seems to e to have been created expressly to seize and consolidate power-that is where I have an issue
@rustyy @NicholasBonjour @_TsunDairy_ @AndrewYangVFA The Finland experiment is not UBI, giving it only to unemployed people is not what Yang is saying.
@NicholasBonjour @native719 @rustyy @_TsunDairy_ @AndrewYangVFA I need to see how or if this impacts medicare, social security, etc. It will certainly drive down 401K and retirement planning if this is in addition to social security then mot everyone can retire without additional savings if they are currently middle class and up.
@KamalaHarris Thats a pretty good response...nicely done @KamalaHarris
@mutex7 @mtracey Thank you I will review it
@CalebJHull Really good to see all those UCB students standing around with their thumbs in their butts. Shameful. I hope the young man in black is arrested for assault and battery. People have died taking a punch.

@HowieCarrShow @MikevsMoonbats Uh yeah...no....not a good excuse. Let it go. He is a shitbag and that happens evenon the left.
@RealTimBlack Tim you can't edit that so it doesnt look so bad the first few seconds?
@mtracey Pretty sure there aren't enough troops there to topple even Venezuelas wretched military unless they are going to surrender to CNN helicopters like the Iraqis did. As for your real point I have mixed feelings, still doing research, any good links to share?
@LisaTalmadge @BernieSanders Lol ok you got me there. Nice use of tropes. Seriously though, all that energy wasted on tearing down a progressive...you are smarter than that

@OhNoSheTwitnt Oh hey can men say Liz Warren too or should we go with Dr Warren? I don't want to get crotch slammed for being disrepectful.
@LisaTalmadge @BernieSanders Bully for you. Man hating is not a policy just fyi-at least one not likely to win too many elections at the federal level. I respect your passion and your knowledge. Blessings..blue in 2020 is all I really need to see
@LisaTalmadge @BernieSanders Hey I bet there is a chance if enough people asked for it you could draft HRC and she could lose again? Would that work for you?
@LisaTalmadge How about you promote a candidate you like and not waste your passion and your energy (and I see you have a fuk ton of both) dragging a candidate for the Dem nomination. I assume you would prefer @Bernie to @realDonaldTrump or does that stick in your craw too much?
@LisaTalmadge https://t.co/gXim73LhQa
@LisaTalmadge @BernieSanders I know this, division is bad, cohesion is good. Knocking supporters of Sanders isn't going to get Trump out of the White House. Your preferred candidate has won and lost multiple times. Give it a rest -promote the candidate you love. They all have warts. By the way I am undecided
@LisaTalmadge @BernieSanders record is nuanced but it is definitely not a bad one. It certainly matches up to Hillary's. The Clintons have never led the charge on progressive issues-not that I can recall.
@LisaTalmadge https://t.co/GqkSrCgDNV
@Badababa @brycejacksoncvt @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC You don't want the dream don't move here. Californians don't resent folks living in flyover country, pity them a bit maybe, but never resent
@LisaTalmadge Hillary was years after @BernieSanders , get your facts straight.
@LisaTalmadge While Sanders generally opposed measures to ban gay marriage, he did not speak out in favor of it until 2009. That’s still ahead of Clinton, who released a YouTube video announcing her support in 2013, as well as most other Democratic Senators
@LisaTalmadge , another President Bill Clinton-era policy, and supported civil unions in Vermont in 2000
@LisaTalmadge He was one of just 67 members in the House of Representatives to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act, a politically tough decision he prides himself on and points to as a key progressive bona fide. Sanders opposed Don’t Ask Don’t Tell in 1993
@LisaTalmadge Not sure where you get your information from but here is what Time says-By all measures, Sanders was ahead of his time in supporting gay rights. In 1983, as mayor of Burlington, he signed a Gay Pride Day proclamation calling it a civil rights issue.
@b140tweet @stellaaaa @LisaTalmadge That's utter nonsense. He ran fair and square in 2016 and then threw his support behind HIllary, I like many of his followers voted for him in the Primary and then voted for HRC in the general. Don't be a sore loser. Promote your candidate don't knock other peoples-that's sad
@politvidchannel https://t.co/r3V15XgqdL
@politvidchannel Y'all know @BillClinton flew on this guys private plane 26 times right? Money and power crosses the aisle.
@Agenthades1 @snarkytoes I probably wouldn't gloat about this too much considering how close @BillClinton was to this guy
@bourgeoisalien @AOC There are alot of real ones out there sadly. Not promoting their own preferred candidate but savaging @BernieSanders . I guess a combination of sore loser and some serious anti man stuff going on. I have not decided who I am going to support but I am not going to drag any of em!
@LisaTalmadge @stellaaaa @BernieSanders Who cares, he is running as a Democrat. Want him to run as an independent so we can lose in 2020? Sounds like CCCP appatchik nonsense. Man hell hath no fury eh? https://t.co/k8UFdEblHw
@ClareGibert @LisaTalmadge @stellaaaa I voted for Hillary in the general election but keep on keeping on with your divisive bullshit. I hope you enjoy another term with Trump in the White House because this kind of garbage is what gets you a loss in 2020. https://t.co/IbCfNhlCX6
@stellaaaa @LisaTalmadge It is precisely that. Don't be a sore loser. And as a Democrat how can you obsess over physical appearance? That is so Trumpian.  Shame https://t.co/QUQLT6vsDk
@stellaaaa @LisaTalmadge Better read number 7 again then
@LisaTalmadge @stellaaaa @BernieSanders Sorry I meant you 'can't" dig up Hillary
@LisaTalmadge @stellaaaa Dragging one of the Dem candidates is a self defeating thing and not good for anyone. You can dig up Hillary and get her to run for the 33rd time and a good chunk of the Dem policies are mainstream now because of @BernieSanders .
@TibblesTimothy @HappyTexans @amcnal @TPUSA Let me tell the kid, I am great with kids
@LisaTalmadge @stellaaaa Who cares? Policy over face lift anytime. Concentrate on what matters. This superficial internecine bullshit is what the Republicans are salivating over.
@LisaTalmadge @stellaaaa Sure hate on Sanders....who is your candidate, let's see how smooth their skin is...what a stupid waste of time

1/2 I am going to say it again. I donated to this guy. I think you should too. His is a voice we need to hear in the Democratic debates. Donate to your candidate of choice of course, but shave off a couple of bucks and donate to this guy please. And read his book-it is scary...

@JCrockett623 @krassenstein @jack @AnnCoulter Hey JCrock, I like you but respectfully there are way worse tweets every day here. And there is some value to hearing from the enemy so that they don't end up sneaking up on ya.
@AMHotFlash @Bellatrixx2020 He'd have a better chance at the White House than Texas Senate, Coryn is not as unpopular as Cruz he will have major donor support and RNC aid.

@native719 @SimonRadio1776 @WHORadio @newsradio600 @TheDemocrats @AndrewYangVFA Cuz he will drain the swamp
@JCrockett623 @krassenstein @jack You reported Ann @AnnCoulter ? I'm in general against muting people even when heir opposing viewpoints are beyond silly. Provided they do not advocate for violence or deny the holocaust or stuff like that. If only people like us were on Twitter why would we bother going on at all
I'm old and white so wtf does intersectionalist mean? How about cis? What about binary? I mean in terms of their relationship to a human or a human's sexualisty? I am too lazy to look it up. TWITTERVERSE enlighten me!
I donated to @SenSanders today and to @AndrewYangVFA , why does Act Blue solicit a fucking tip every time I donate? It is a website. I'm not tipping a web site. Sure the web site works but it is not supporting three children on minimum wage plus tips.1.6 billion last year
@colleencmcgill @mommamia1217 Close but no cigar eh?
@ellievan65 @Bellatrixx2020 Hilarious when the aid or bodyguard or whatever repeats it word for word...like a Coen Brothers Movie
@TitaniaMcGrath hey you are a snekay one Titania, I argued with you the other day till I realized what was going on. Brilliant!
@ellievan65 @Bellatrixx2020 Ivanka is a big deal in China. The Chinese value wealth and entreprenurialship and so this is neither surprising nor particularly indicative of some kind of quid pro quo or other underhanded relationship.
@coleyworld @KamalaHarris @mecjamd My son is about to become a History teacher, I want him to be treated with the respect that vocation deserves and the commensurate income.
@Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC I don't want to ever find myself in an echo chamber where all I hear is what I already believe, on that road is intellectual death
@Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC I follow a lot of righties, I voted for Bush twice for crissakes. Only in the last five years or so have I had an awakening. The whole 1% demonstrations back in the day really woke me up, that and partnering with a #metoo survivor and watching her daily struggles.
@coleyworld @KamalaHarris @mecjamd Love your pigeon analogy by the way-spot on!
@RareVirtrue @native719 @BrettRo48152865 @C_C_Rafferty @Alysonesque I am pretty sure UBI is left of anything proposed by Bernie et al. I'm not saying Andrew is left of them but UBI is waaaaay more radical and daring (and left) then any proposals I have heard so far.
@coleyworld @KamalaHarris @mecjamd Pretty sure every Democratic Senator would say the exact same thing. Talk is cheap. California is an overhwelmingly Democratic state, let's see them put up the doh ray me!
@TheLightPours @AndrewYangVFA I have not finished Yangs book so I don't know yet, I know we need to do something and someday soon to address inequities.

@TheLightPours @Badababa @beinlibertarian @AOC Now you are being silly. It is  pretty great state. And they illegals don't come here to go to High School they come here to make money so it does kind of matter.
@Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC I think you are really reaching for it. I venture to say folks with doctors/masters etc no matter where they are from are not counted as not having finished high school. You are making a big assumption there. Nobody said anything about US High School or US College
@TheLightPours @Badababa @beinlibertarian @AOC Not if they live in the top ranked state of quaity of life-NORTH DAKOTA..........
@TheLightPours @Badababa @beinlibertarian @AOC I gotta give this one to The Light...on points....now I actually live in California and it is a great state for those who can afford to live here. I am not sure I can afford to retire hire but....
@TheLightPours @Badababa @beinlibertarian @AOC Come on Light...North DaFucking Kota? Puhlease...that should only be number 1 on a list of where can you live now that will not change in a zombie apocalypse or something similar. I've been to ND....ugh
@Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC Look childhood citizenship does not equate (to me) with lack of education. Now you and I know that immigration (illegal and legal) probably accounts for most of the education and the poverty rankings but it is what it is.
@TheLightPours @Badababa @beinlibertarian @AOC Wow North Dakota? I am going to have to disagree with those quaity of life rankings. If you have money (and I do) then California is pretty close to paradise as far as living.
@Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC According to new data from the Census Bureau, California is the least educated state in America. It ranked number one for the percentage of those over 25-years-old who have never completed ninth grade. Plus, it ranked 50th for the percentage who have graduated from high school.
@Badababa @TheLightPours @beinlibertarian @AOC Hey she responded with legitimate sources unlike most people and she is correct in what she said (two out of three). Now demographics and crazy housing costs are probably the main cause nonetheless we should respect folks who contribute to a discussion and don't just mouth off?
@TheLightPours @Badababa @beinlibertarian @AOC https://t.co/X12Uql9ZQ4
@TheLightPours @Badababa @beinlibertarian @AOC Illegal immigration undoubtedly accounts for California leading in those two categories...but thanks for the links...do you have one for quality of life too?
@SaysHummingbird I don't trust the professional opinion of a doctor or a psychiatrist who hasn't actually spoken to and seen the person they are evaluating, It is unprofessional even with the wealth of data available on Trump.
@IntEngineering Wow very nice

@Mikel_Jollett Oh crap...21st century...my bad...read The Windup Girl-phenomenal novel. Read Oryx and Crake. Read the Road by Cormac McCarthy. Read Wool by Hugh Howey. My all time favorite 21st century is The Windup Girl
@Mikel_Jollett OMG so many bad answers, read Ursula K Le Guin, read Heinlein, read Enders Game, Handmaids Tale, A Canticle for Leibowitz....The Martian was nice it is not great science fiction. Great Science Fiction is like a great movie, you think about for a long time afterwards

@SenGillibrand Really? I have never heard that the best way to beat a bully is to talk past him.
@TheLightPours @Badababa @beinlibertarian @AOC Come on lady, best schools in the world are in California. Our poverty rate is 16.6 % better than Florida and Texas amongst the states-do some research before you just spot off. You will get called on your bullcrap.
Watching #RussianDoll on Netflix, pretty damn good so far...kind of a sexier Groundhog Day
@BernieSanders What a bunch of asswipes, do you hold everyone to the same standards. You sure as hell weren't complaining in 2016 about one of the wealthiest people in politics-Hillary Clinton. Bernie is not close to the top in Senate wealth, in fact I bet he is closer to the bottom
I watched 60 minutes last night-the McCabe episode.  I found McCabe completely credible until he explained why he had been fired for lack of candor. His excuse that he was confused, and that he was under pressure doesn't hold water. Not for three separate offenses and dates.
I just donated money to @AndrewYangVFA campaign, not because he is my choice (frankly don't know alot about him) but I am reading his fascinating book and I want to see UBI at least mentioned in the debates. Give the guy a buck through Act Blue let's see what everyone says UBI
@MattWalshBlog I watched the one with the big battle scenes in it, still pretty good, much better than re watching Star Wars, omg that stuff is wretched
@TitaniaMcGrath OMG that's rich!
@DavidRutz He wants to believe (tail end of interview mashup) that there is something called Justice. Oh yeah jussie (wtf kind of name is Jussie anyways), you will seeing some justice pretty soon I am thinking.

@cmkagenda @PalmerReport @DebbieGT18 @BernieSanders I’m saying what Trump,thinks....I’m not saying I won’t vote for a woman candidate.
@90LesSW @JStein_WaPo @ewarren Why try something that won’t work. Get to the money we can count and count on. Corporate profits, estate tax, and capital gains.
@cmkagenda @PalmerReport @DebbieGT18 @BernieSanders Trump is salivating at the thought of facing any of the ladies believe me...except maybe Klobuchar
@cmkagenda @PalmerReport @DebbieGT18 @BernieSanders What makes you think I or @BernieSanders thinks these things will be easy? You are setting up straw dogs...
@RyanAlan33 @KamalaHarris Ryan the Mexicans aren't gonna overwhelm us in 12 years either are they (wall)? Also you can't wait to do something about climate change or it won't matter what you do later. That ain't how planetary warming works. https://t.co/yOctCJFMyz
@BIGPartyOne @KamalaHarris Yeah that's just dumb. Gun violence isn't even a blip on the screen, it has just been over politicized. Economic security? No such thing my friend and it is going to get alot worse with AI and automation replacing millions of jobs. Nothing abstract about destroying the planet
@KamalaHarris Harris has received only just under 30,000 from energy sources life to date. of course she hasn't been in the Senate long and that amount is really pretty paltry. https://t.co/QjZk26rmq2

@Abreus @ciccmaher Well it is making me think....and that’s a good thing I suppose.
@cmkagenda @PalmerReport @DebbieGT18 @BernieSanders I fail to see why Dems will do now what they didn’t do then....when they controlled the house and executive. I’m not,saying Bernie would have more luck but coopting his policies and then pretending. They were always yours is just bull. And if Germany can afford free college?
@ciccmaher And it was surprisingly rational and fairly informative (the BBC interview). I still think it doesn;t matter how we got here and if Maduro's government is popular it should win and not be afraid of an election but I am no longer convinced the West is close to blameless in this
@ciccmaher I gotta admit Maduro is a ballsy guy. The government has also pledged to distribute 20,000 subsidised CLAP food boxes to the Colombian border community between Friday and Sunday. Giving away food when the supermarket shelves are bare. I listened to an interview he gave the BBC
@allmylovin1 @Amy_Siskind OMG he stood there with a smirk? Do you realize how that sounds like lunacy? I am pretty sure there is no definition of bullying that includes standing silently with a smile/smirk. If he had a Cubs hat on nobody would be saying shit. I'm no MAGA guy believe me but give it a rest
@Ryanilbasso @JamesBa34175632 @MattWalshBlog I don't disagree though I'd prefer to retire to the Amalfi Coast, but the wife ain't having it. But America is not so unique that we can't learn from other countries and we can't do better for our people.
@cmkagenda @PalmerReport @DebbieGT18 Free college, medicare for all, nobody was talking about that, nobody with any influence, till @BernieSanders. I do agree with you that Trump has helped more than anyone in shifting the narrative. And I agree we will fall short, to not recognize what Bernie's done is shortsighted
@PurlLeslie @atDavidHoffman I doubt it, that is not the way it happens,not right away. But we shall see. I am afraid it may not be what everyone hopes for though.
@cmkagenda @PalmerReport @DebbieGT18 Yeah @BernieSanders ideas. Not Hillarys, not anyone's really till Bernie started talking about it. You just proved my point!

@Ryanilbasso @JamesBa34175632 @MattWalshBlog Policies are what matter not labels. Labels are used to demonize and to frighten people. Unlike most Americans I have traveled all over the world and see the way people live in other countries and this is NOT the greatest place in the world to live but it could be-it is close!
@BernieSanders is not a Democrat! So what! Abraham Lincoln was not a Democrat,, are you telling me you would not support Honest Abe? Stop the labeling and the party obsession. Vote for the best man or woman who believes in what you believe. Anyone but Trump, https://t.co/r3Lr85b1rH
@cmkagenda @PalmerReport @DebbieGT18 Really? You know this because you and Bernie are so tight right? Bernie has driven the Democratic party left and you should thank him for it! We are miles away from Clinton's platform and all to the good! I voted for her but Bernie's ideas are the right ones!
@JStein_WaPo @90LesSW @ewarren You CANNOT tax wealth. It is the stupidest thing I have ever heard of. First of all anyone with wealth knows how to hide it. Secondly how do you evaluate/value wealth when much of it is tied up in fluctuating values? Tax income, tighten loopholes, raise capital gains, estate tax

@_rutrho_ @Bravewriting @msdeehj1 @ResistResource @SarahKSilverman @notcapnamerica @SallyAlbright @LisaTalmadge @docrocktex26 @BernieSanders is a racist eh?

Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury. https://t.co/3hwAWoWPes
@atDavidHoffman BS, the DOJ has long standing rules, this is not a game. Congress will be the venue to turn to if the report is heavily redacted. This will probably end up before SCOTUS and we will lose there (more than likely) either way likely to never know the whole truth
@mommamia1217 @ABC He is a garbage human...I hope he gets help...after serving some time. Think of the resources devoted to this case that could have been solving real crimes or protecting non low-lifes....makes my blood boil https://t.co/XA9bIVsB1K

@AtortieA @MrDane1982 Oh yeah let's make sure only REAL DEMOCRATS can be the nominee because we all know it is more important to have the right party label then to have the right policies and passions.  I like Harris too but you don't need to bernie bash to support your candidate.

@JamesBa34175632 @Ryanilbasso @MattWalshBlog He is a Democratic Socialist like in Denmark and Sweden where some people do quite well. Socialists don't say you can't do well they just try to make sure no one does horribly. So no, not hypocritical at all
@TheFreshTrumpet @PatrioticEllie @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman And stop sounding like a jilted lover. Party Scharty, both party structures are part of the corporate oligarchy in this country anyways. Vote principle and person not party
@TheFreshTrumpet @PatrioticEllie @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman I never said the DNC made it impossible for Bernie to win but they made it harder and they should not have. We might not have Trump in office if they had not. I voted for Hillary in the General Election like most Bernie supporters.
@TheFreshTrumpet @PatrioticEllie @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Yes well that doesn't matter, heck she got three million more votes than Trump too but guess whose fat ass is sitting behind the Resolute Desk? I would hope you'd vote for a Praying Mantis if it was the Democractic nominee.
@AdamParkhomenko Nice Adam stirring up the hate, trying for a repeat pf 2016. United we stand divided we fall. How about just supporting your candidate of choice and not denigrating others.
@TheFreshTrumpet @Cshanahan150 @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Move to Cali bro, then your vote won't count either but the weather is sooooo much better
@PamKeithFL I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle as it usually is in life. He certainly did NOT deserve the approbation and the terrible tweets and social media posts that he got any more than apparently Jussie deserved all the support he got. I am ambivalent re the suit
@dawnsaffron @LivesKuato I did in 2016 and I am going to hold my water for now in this election. I will defend him though when I see gratuitous nonsense tweets by sore losers from 2016. That stuff does not help whoever our eventual nominee is.

Stop bashing @BernieSanders and his supporters. You like someone else - promote them. You disgruntled Hillariastas are going to hurt the eventual nominee.

If your product is worth buying (your nominee worth supporting) then talk about why. Stop sobbing about how @SenSanders cost you 2016. Comey had more influence than @SenSanders and Putin probably did to. Y'all ought to be ashamed with those #NeverBernie tags, how about #ANYDEM https://t.co/HeD9p2ozij
or cry about him being too white and too entitled and too whatever, like Hillary wasn't the absolute epitome of entitled. Move the f*ck on from 2016 will you? Talk up your candidate don't talk down other Dem candidates. That is what a shitty salesman does-talks the other guy down
Again I won't vote for @SenSanders because he is too old and his policies have been coopted by more appropriate standard bearers. But the vehemence of the Hillariastis is apalling. Bernie moved the Party to the left and all you want to do is bitch about him not being a Democrat

@Knowledge2Seek @MrDane1982 @BernieSanders Why would they distance themselves from her supporters? Kind of a generally obvious and stupid thing to mark. Why not say Dem candidates who who distance themselves from Obama will not win. You people have to get over 2016...move the hell on please. Let’s just win this thing!
@SanGringoCorp @MattWalshBlog Do some research he made the appropriate stink considering he was going to have to support the Democratic nominee which of course he did.
@_mythogenesis_ @MrDane1982 @BernieSanders That’s bullcrap. A divisive campaign? Bullying behavior? That isn’t the campaign I saw. I will tell you that rehashing these old wounds does us no good though. I’d vote for a neutered dog over Trump in 2020 and I hope you would too.
@HightowerPDX @chicola_nola @LRBitisnot @1feralkat Now that is some truth. Being a middle aged white fuy I have not experienced much of this firsthand but I believe it to be true. #FightthePower

@MattWalshBlog Do you mean stand up FOR?
@MattWalshBlog That's an awful thing to say and unsupported by any actual data. He is not nearly as rich as most Senators-that is a fact.

I won't take your argument any more seriously of you call me a bitch or pissy kitty (I kinda liked that one) and if you don't want to change minds when you argue then why not just spare your fingers and not bother tweeting https://t.co/bLZOcKNO23
@EaglezFan @BernieSanders @SenWarren Why you gotta get personal? It is ok to be wrong. You can't be right about everything. I understand the frustrations of the Hillary backers from 2016 I just don't validate false data. Kisses
@madison03aidan @krassenstein Well don't shoot me then....I like all my GSW to be treatable by doctors.
@TheFreshTrumpet @PatrioticEllie @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Forget Party you sound like an apparatchik when you talk about Party. It is the person and the principles that matter. If Jesus ran as a Libertarian you wouldn't vote for him? DNC job is to be fair and impartial during the primaries not anoint another Clinton
@LukeRussell1281 @PhyddleDD So can we count on you to join the #BernieBros sir? I have you decoder ring and secret handshake instructions ready.
@madison03aidan @krassenstein I pick the crappy old one on the bottom, it looks like it takes awhile to reload
@krassenstein God I hope the FBI doesn't investigate tweets, don't they have enough to do what with all the lying and firing and investigations and books they are writing?
@libertyncognito Did you have a good excuse for not chatting with him?		Kidding		Dox away https://t.co/tv2tO9IbeF
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Cuz it is in the constitution and that is something we should only change when it is dramatically and painfully necessary.
@TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Yeah not gonna happen probably but fun to talk about
@TheFreshTrumpet @PatrioticEllie @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Pay attention, DNC rigging it for Clinton....come on dawg do I look like a #MAGA guy?
@EaglezFan @BernieSanders @SenWarren Well you are WRONG...so I guess that is just something we will both have to live with. How about them Eagles huh? https://t.co/fKcTzHcwOJ
Besides the fact that he is too old, which is why I won't be voting for Bernie this time and that his policies are mainstream now, I wonder why so many @BernieSanders haters out there? He didn't cost the 2016 election, Hillary did that (with Putin's aid) on her own! Explain it! https://t.co/QoRS5mkwZs
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Oh and Colin once they get elected they don't 'represent' dick that's just a charade while they are running.
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman I give up...and I have to admit I have stopped caring, it is what is and it isn't going to change since it would take a constitutional convention and god knows what could happen with one of those..ugh!
@EaglezFan @BernieSanders @SenWarren Your not talking about Sanders either or shouldn't be since it is laughable to accuse him of Kremlin pandering
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman It is only due to the EC that states count at all. Under your scenario there are no blue or red states only pockets of voters, regionalized, that are campaigned for. And hey have you noticed how few people vote at all? I bet those numbers would fall in a popular vote scenario
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Popular vote campaign will be all about massive and expensive television buys and staged rallies in major metropolitan areas. Candidate will no longer have to listen to concerns of farmers in the Midwest or suck up to the ethanol clique in Iowa.
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman That makes my point not yours...at least in the battleground states you can reasonably assume your vote matterm it has not mattered in NY and CA in long time
@EaglezFan @BernieSanders Sen. Bernie Sanders misses the vote; his spokesman says he was meeting with women who accused his 2016 presidential campaign of sexual misconduct. And it didn't lose by one vote so calm down. https://t.co/BQZxr8leOP
@EaglezFan @BernieSanders Come on...loosen the tinfoil on your head. Sanders is also a tool of the Kremlin? How about @SenWarren, did she sabotage her run for President with the ridiculous Native American debacle at Putin's direction?
https://t.co/NCoxjaszmN
@HightowerPDX @chicola_nola @LRBitisnot @1feralkat You are a one trick pony aren't you Sunshine? https://t.co/bSKHWKmHDW
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman 79.95%v 2,191,869 Democratic Votes as opposed to 17.04%v 467,254...so Colin not so many Republican votes in the five boroughs
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Well Collin you get to pick your poison because the EC makes stops in Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan,Arizona, New mexico, Colorado, Virginia, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire all necessary and the candidates go to NY and CA plenty so they can suck in cash from the bloated oligarchy
@TwitterMoments @BernieSanders @fshakir See? @BernieSanders reaching out to African American voters so he doesn't get steamrolled in South Carolina!

@TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman yes and in a popular vote contest no point in going to those contested states because states don't matter only votes do so say goodbye to Missouri, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, etc. The election would be much more costly too with national tv ads.
@E_A_Swearengen @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Also if you are Al Swearingen shouldn't you drop a see you next tuesday in there when you are tweeting? As I recall Al never went for too l long before uttering that vulgarity. #DEADWOOD
@E_A_Swearengen @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman They are a contested state Al that is the only reason anyone gives two shits about Missouri. My first wife was from Jeff City, she could not wait to leave.
@HightowerPDX @chicola_nola @LRBitisnot @1feralkat I don't need that ignorant sidekick of yours calling me Piss Kitty because I don't agree with her then bragging about becoming a lawyer that is any great statement about her intellect.
@Cshanahan150 @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman Because it always votes Republican, Dems spend very little time in Texas and Reps spend little time in New York. Nothing to do with votes in that case correct?

@KMR31871 @realAliTweets His involvement with Russia? Oh my god you people see Russia behind every action or statement. @BernieSanders is as involved with Russia as Sarah Palin was. Though at his age with is bad eyesight I doubt he can see it from his porch
@E_A_Swearengen @TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman If your fix means that States like NY and CA and FL and TX will get more power electorally then again it will mean less campaigning and attention paid to Missouri, Ohio etc. I personally don't want more political ads in Ca where we basically just run dems vs dems here anyways
@TheFreshTrumpet @PatrioticEllie @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman I'm no Republican star child I just see no use in wasting energy whining about something that isn't going to change. And you know who screwed us over in 2016, Hillary and the Democratic Party by trying to rig the game for another machine politician. Thankfully 2020 looking good
@pleasherparty @abibascencio Oh and nothing brave about harassing someone who disagrees with you politically.
@pleasherparty @abibascencio I completely disagree with this bullshit and this kind of behavior costs votes it doesn't gain any.

@TwitterMoments This NOT news, we'd probably shudder at alot of 50 year old interviews. At some point you have to let the past be the past.
So here is what is going to happen. Trump will be impeached by the house, he will then use the 25th pass the Presidency to Pence, be pardoned by Pence, and resume the Presidency. All completely legal. You heard it here first-master stroke by the orange baboon! https://t.co/cfoJCcpzyk
@TheFreshTrumpet @PatrioticEllie @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman I guarantee you if the Dems had won the electoral but not the popular we wouldn't hear much from this side of the aisle. Just win em both, crush that doofus!
@TheFreshTrumpet @SandraS89943393 @vinjville @atDavidHoffman I disagree....the electoral college forces candidates to campaign and pay lip service to a much greater number of states than if it were strictly by popular vote. Win both in 2020 which we should do!

@RobbinMilne @BernieSanders He is just regrettably too old for me
Oh and I won't vote for Bernie because he is too damn old. I will vote for him if he is the nominee but I will probably look elsewhere in the primaries. This has nothing to do with him not being a registered Democrat-that's just stupid!
To all you morons that won't for Bernie because he is NOT a Democrat. Who cares? Why does the label matter more than the policies you agree with? You are as bad as the GOP who let Trump debase them because he is labeled as a Republican. Shame on YOU! https://t.co/BDxx8fG0C5
@maryaoden @BaxterPamela @atDavidHoffman who cares if he is not a Democrat? He is not a Republican, THAT is what is more important.

@RawStory @whenyourastar Yeah I think @realDonaldTrump is the worst President ever but there is no chance the Kremlin is controlling him.

@JoeBarri We didn't have @BernieSanders as the Democractic nominee. Plus there was fatigue after Obamas two terms, Murika often goes back and forth like that. Hillary did not run an inspiring campaign and frankly Murika probably was tired of Clintons and Bushes (and I don't blame them)
@LeviGratton @KamalaHarris Jesus Christ does that mean something in the Great White North? What are you doing  on a gun control tweet are you not Canadian? You seem to be doing ok with your guns there...mostly anyways
@LeviGratton @KamalaHarris Glasses with either two diff prescriptions or no prescription on hair of the lense. NRA contributions are a drop in the bucket compared to many other lobby’s that is what I’m saying
@LeviGratton @KamalaHarris It’s actually quite clear perhaps you are not wearing your bifocals. I listed other lobbying groups that contribute far more money than the NRA to support my contention that with the NRA it is not the money.

@LeviGratton @KamalaHarris Did you really laugh your ass off? Can I see? But again it is not about their political contributions which pale in comparison to Pharma, Wall Street, Hollywood, etc. Or do you disagree?
@KamalaHarris Lets be accurate, more money is spent on gun control advocacy then opposition to it. The NRA is not successful because of money it is successful because it can mobilize millions of single issue voters who WILL vote. We should be accurate when identifying the problem.
@docsmoon @KKsHacienda @KamalaHarris That's just semantics and you know it. The POLICE have no obligation to concern themselves with your safety UNLESS you have been arrested-then they have a duty of care. It is all accessible to anyone with fingers. Search online and educate yourself.

@BellerGreg @glasmel @KamalaHarris Yeah and in countries without many guns (you know the civilized world) successful suicide attempts are much lower. What that means my friend is that some of those people end up NOT DEAD and presumably living a decent life. In Murika it is less likely you will fail-GUNS!
@AspiringVulcan @KamalaHarris hey Wyatt Earp you don't need to defend yourself with a gun. Odds are any gun you own would be used against you or by you against your family then used to defend same family. And all violent crime is on a diminishing trend.
@BellerGreg @glasmel @KamalaHarris But ur ok with us licensing drivers and making them get insurance right big guy? So I gotta assume you would be perfectly ok with us doing that with guns and gun owners too?
@BellerGreg @KamalaHarris All it takes is the continued death of the GOP Sunny Jim and you will see 5-4 decisions the other way on SCOTUS. I'm no constitutional Scholar but I am pretty sure a court with 5 or 6 RBG's on it is going to read the 2nd amendment like a normal human would. "To form a militia"
@BellerGreg @glasmel @KamalaHarris And let's admit something. We don't really care about the majority of the gun violence which is gang member A shoots gang member B and possibly bystander C. Because none of the proposals address those criminals and their (mostly) illegally obtained firearms.
@BellerGreg @glasmel @KamalaHarris The laws on the books would not stop most mass shooters or casual criminals, you know the dad who comes home and shoots up his family, the mom tired of getting whupped on who shoots the dad, the kid playing with poppas gun who shoots his sister...ad infinitum
Require gun owners to maintain liability insurance and change laws to make them criminally responsible for what their gun does unless it is locked up etc. Oh and no matter what you do here, gang bangers and criminals will continue to shoot themselves and innocents in crap hoods.. https://t.co/zgvB7HloCf
Ban magazines over 6 rounds, tax bullets (that should pass 2nd amendment muster) at 5000%-exception being rounds used( fired) on a authorized range. Make it easier to take someone's guns away for criminal acts, forbid sales outside of licensed gun shops (no more parking lot bs)
Every day a new tweet about Gun Control. It is all bullshit till someone offers real solutions. BG checks will help a tiny tiny bit, banning Assault Weapons is a complete red herring-ban semi automatic weapons period if you want to BEGIN to make a difference.
@BellerGreg @KamalaHarris At least I was getting you some benjamins for your strap, instead of just confiscating them. #MOLONLABE
@BellerGreg @KamalaHarris Geepers @BellerGreg you really think criminals are after you? Do you have like diamonds at home in your safe, or do you live next door to a crack house? Relax homie, this is a very safe nation statistically speaking. I bet you will never use that AK-47 in defense of ur home
@lisaannherman @SethAbramson I just don't get how an attorney can use 'Proof of Collusion' as one of their tag lines when he should know more than most that that is not even a crime. Unless he thinks Trump is colluding on hotel room prices or bad toupees? Why dumb it down, call it what u think it is.
@AspiringVulcan @KamalaHarris How is someone going to die because they couldn't bull a rifle with a bull pup stock or a pistol grip or a expanded magazine or a flash suppressor? I agree it won't do dick to bring down violent crime but it's even more stupid to suggest it will cost a life
@KKsHacienda @KamalaHarris Believe it or not it is NOT Law Enforcement personnel's job to protect you, they have no duty of care, none, it is true!
@KamalaHarris Almost none of this will make any difference. No such thing as an Assault Weapon just political lazy talk. You want to make a difference-ban all semi automatics especially pistols, buy back as many guns as you can afford, tax guns 1000%, make owners carry liability insurance, etc

My dog Sully found this little  baby monkey in our yard. The baby monkey smells like Tequila. We will not allow anchor baby monkeys!

BBC News - Poland PM cancels Israel trip after Netanyahu's Holocaust comment https://t.co/uMUc6nhkyh. Many Poles did cooperate with the Nazis as did many Czechs, Hungarians, Romanians, Finns, Dutch, French, etc etc. However many fought back and saved lives and died themselves.
@MadeGreatest Maybe so, all that matters in the end is that it is over one way or another and that we stay within our institutional norms.
@MadeGreatest @adamgoldmanNYT Yeah I'm thinking you are no psychiatric expert. You could very well be right but probably aren't and either way that isn't how we are supposed to do things in this country. I think stupid and narcissistic is more likely than crazy.

@TomthunkitsMind @MrsRabbitResist Police free schools eh? Then who is going to stop that girl the next time she wigs out? I am sure there is racial discrimination in policing and enforcement, there always has been. Removing police is not the answer, educating and training them better might be.
#NotesFromNationalEmergency  Day 4 of this infernal National Emergency. My iPad fell from my grip and cracked. It still works but it is ugly now.

In the CRS report, Neale also noted: “It can be further suggested that Section 4, like the impeachment process, is so powerful, and so fraught with constitutional and political implications, that it would never be used, except in the most compelling circumstances
president disabled. If the president is able to disagree with that decision, the vice president then can start a procedure where two-thirds of the House and Senate must agree that the president can’t perform his or her duties, and the vice president remains as acting president.
25th Amendment-section 4  wording makes it clear that “the Vice President is the indispensable actor in section 4: it cannot be invoked without his agreement.”  Under Section 4, the vice president, either acting with the Cabinet or a group designated by Congress, can declare the

@MadeGreatest @adamgoldmanNYT He is plainly able to discharge the duties of his office-we don't like what he is doing but there should be no question right now of mental incapacity. People can disagree but that is how I see it

@LRBitisnot @1feralkat @HightowerPDX Well that is utter bull crap, all cops cannot be racists. No over generalization such as that is believable. You now have zero credibility. He violated a protective order and he was in jail overnight-big deal. Honestly much ado about nothing.
@timpplex @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Well then I guess all the folks at the FBI are not selfless dedicated public servants, some are scumbags-but not the ones we believe in. You could be right Tim. Let me do research, watch 60 mins. and use Occams Razor if I am still torn...hoofbeats equals horses not zebras right?

I wish trump would fire me I could use a book tour and some softball interviews. Where is my 15 minutes!
@timpplex @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC I don't believe the IG would do that just because Trump wanted it. We should not be able to pick and choose which FBI personnel we believe just because of our political beliefs. The same with Comey-an arrogant, grandstanding fool-he may be a patriot but he is not a good man

That is totally wrong. Investigation is what you do to prove or disprove a crime. The 25th is pretty much reserved for Presidents that cannot fulfill the duties of office...not Presidents we hate or disagree with. Presidents that get shot or get sick or lose their minds
@realDonaldTrump is making a revolution in America possible. No other President, not @SenSanders  (who I love), not @HillaryClinton (who I vogtef for) no one would have cleared the way like Trump has for a radical transformation of this nation for the good. Tell me how I am wrong https://t.co/A0Z5mICGwW
but do not despair. THIS TOO SHALL PASS. You want to get all excited about impeachment go ahead. i won't hang my hat on that happening. The election of AOC and others is thanks MAINLY to Donald Trump and his incredible drag on the GOP (which they deserve) but it is a good thing!
Now he has done 100 other things that suck and he has done lasting damage to our country and our reputation. But NONE of what he has done cannot be overturned in a couple years with a Democratic President and House. NONE of it, So keep fighting, keep shining the light of truth...
Here are some things this awful President has done that I agree with and applaud. Getting tough on China-about time. Troop withdrawals-about time. Prison/Sentencing Reform-about time. Pull out of the Iran deal-I support that. Iran is a net exporter of violence and terror.
A Clinton Presidency no matter how much better it would be than this charade would do nothing to advance the cause of equity and equality in this country. We have a chance now to use this Presidency to catapult America into a freer, more equal, more just society. https://t.co/soVOuOiT8y
Those of you (us) who are progressive who are democratic socialists should be thanking @realDonaldTrump. I am dead serious. He is enabling a swing to the left like no one else could. The New agreen Deal, wealth redistribution, real changes are becoming possible due to him 1/2
@adawgbite4you @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC They have no duty to vet the presidents policies or opinions. You really don’t believe Trump is taking orders from Moscow do you?

@yellowpaiges @MaryWills612 @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Yeah your passion is admirable your facts are not. But we shall agree to disagree....same side by the way. I prefer logic and evidence to speculation and hope.
@yellowpaiges @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Not when you do it that way Becky. The end never justifies the means, on this road lies damnation. We have a Soecial Counsel, let’s hope for a good solid meaty report that will convince a dozen GOP senators to end this reign of error.
@timpplex @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Something I happen to agree with by the way. Generals never want to get out of any conflict. Obama didn’t listen to his generals either, in fact he fired McChrystal. I’m ok with that, this isn’t South America. But I get most of your point and agree.
@timpplex @RobbinMilne @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC There is nothing to indicate unfitness for office based on the 25th. I’ll admit he’s the worst President ever, and he is a clear and present danger but we need to do this the right way. Mueller investigates, reports, the House impeaches and then we see.
@timpplex @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Many people doubt his sanity? If only that was an actual thing and not just rhetoric. Do Presidents have their mental capacity examined regularly by a doctor? How did Reagan manage his last couple of years. Come on Tim, he’s an awful human he is not insane.
@kolta_ruth @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC That would not be good optics....Obama rightfully imo decided to downplay it...it would have looked really bad to hav come from the Obama DOJ
@timpplex @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Elections have consequences he is neither insane nor physically unable to perform his duties. He is an awful man with bad policies...so what...we shall make it through this. We don't get to extralegally toss him out because of what he might do. We want him gone...prove a crime

@jsrrayburn @DineshDSouza @Debber66 There was no reasonable doubt in that trial, there was a tired jury, race baiting, and so much obfuscation at the end that there was no search for the truth just a rush for the exits. With almost any other jury it is a conviction

@April19136742 @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC April I agree it is not a coupe or even probably a sedan. I did not hear any talk of warrants and neither did you. I'd be pretty stunned to see such a warrant granted. I at least can spell coup....grin....just kidding
@MaryWills612 @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Tell yourself whatever you like so it makes sense to you. if we caught someone taping Barrack you'd have no problem calling it an attempted coup. Not that they would find anything because he was a kickass man and President but still-this is a dangerous slope for the country
@SSGT_940815 @krassenstein Yes we all know that but the House can impeach them for pretty much any reason and the constitution in the form of SCOTUS is only going to get involved if it is invoked-though doesn't the Chief Justice act as judge in the Senate?
Y'all are fooling yourselves if you think McCabe/Comey are good honorable men just because they don't like Trump. The enemy of our enemy is not necessarily our friend. They both seem like lying opportunists who can't let go of their 15 minutes of fame-buy their book-not their bs
@timpplex @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC The traditional way like we did with Nixon and later Clinton...you now somebody messes up, you get a special prosecutor...oh hey...guess what we are doing it this way with Trump. Working within the system as designed!
@timpplex @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Just remember all you gleeful progressives and liberals out there (I am one just not as gleeful) that what you think is good for the goose is good for the gander. What you allow to happen in resistance of Der Trump-you must be ok with when it is a Democrat in office.
@timpplex @adamgoldmanNYT @b1e56df9ce6549f @LindseyGrahamSC Yes it is exactly what it is. It is also quite probably illegal to tape the President without his knowledge. There is no such thing as gathering evidence for indictment, impeachment etc. It is not within their job description nor is it remotely fair for our Democracy.
@SSGT_940815 @krassenstein Staff Sergeant....just as a good Prosecutor can get a true bill tendered against a tunafish sandwich so can a President be impeached for anything Congress decides is an impeachable offense. Certainly perjury was one of the two charges Clinton had to face. Trump perjured himself
@krassenstein It is only important if you are dumb enough to believe that many GOP Senators will cross over and vote to convict...and you would be wrong to believe that so this is just Clinton Impeachment 2.0. Boring television

@GunReformRyan I don't do doxing but this is a real tragedy
@LearyJerrica @ScottHech The police have no skin in the game so why lie?
@elmil57 @Avemiajul @krassenstein The funniest part of all of this nonsense is I am for reducing guns in this country which you would have seen had u read my tweets and not just reacted.
@elmil57 @Avemiajul @krassenstein Eric I don’t know what your babbling about.
@cruzcerda3 @essenviews @AOC I’m a big fan by the way of a move towards a hybrid socialism or democratic socialism. I’m not generally in favor of the government supplanting private industry
@elmil57 @Avemiajul @krassenstein Protest is no more often illegal here than it is anywhere else. There are requirements for permits for safety and law enforcement reasons but we have protests here all the time and penalties are minimal.
@elmil57 @Avemiajul @krassenstein Our freedom of speech is codified in our constitution unlike many western nations. We have much more freedom of speech than many European countries.
@WritingSpinster @anime_class @ScottHech I dunno why I thought Jamaican....my bad

Day 3 of the National Emergency. #SURVIVINGNationalEmergency	My youngest dog seems to recognize the danger. He is very sad. My pointer won’t leave the door...he senses the trouble Murika is in! https://t.co/HmapKJmVCW
@GHadeev @krassenstein This thread was about SCOTUS not the national emergency
@LearyJerrica @ScottHech Yeah uh he looked okay to me...more damage from crying than anything else...and the MAGA hat...come on....wake up!
@anime_class @ScottHech Jamaican my brother not African
@faythe_lanai @ScottHech PUBLICITY AND FAME...95% of America did not know his name till a week ago
@ScottHech @JussieSmollett Cops will always protect cops and lie about anything involving cops. Not so much though with gay POC actors, cops can really give two shits about them so probably an honest and thorough investigation. My moneys on @JussieSmollett being a lying piece of shit. Lets wait for more... https://t.co/9saFtJa641
@ScottHech We should be just taking @JussieSmollett  word for it? When his story sounded fanciful from the beginning? Scott...newsflash....OJ did it!
@TrevellAnderson How about OJ, did you believe him too?
Jo Jo keep strong brohamanus. MAGA! We will get through this together https://t.co/5x1nomhSJE
@WokeUpMerica @NBCNews You are so wrong it is not even funny. Were you living on the moon for the last few days? It is a huge deal, and a lot of people ran their mouths on this non stop and now look like asses. Wow come on are you serious?
@BuckSexton Casting decisions left much to be desired
@Mediaite A lot of folks got over their skis on this one. I still love Ellen....she wasn't the only one who was fooled by this punk
@rgay Uh yeah he wasn't particularly famous before....NOW he is...I wonder if......
@DonaldJTrumpJr Even a broken watch is right twice a day....you go Junior!
@BradThor @JussieSmollett Uh frankly I am surprised he didn't get away with it.
@rockport811 @Canadian_mom73 @MichaelAvenatti WELL UH SURE and others who deserve it. I hope you weren't talking about me were you? I am sensitive that way...
@WokeUpMerica @NBCNews No need to minimize this, many of us on the left fcked the donkey on this. GOP misdeeds don't make it any better. We need to assume less and question more and don't rush to judgement (O.J still did it!).
@MCyotha @cjobe22 Umbrella Academy is pretty good so far, Im most ways through episode 1. I let my dogs out due to the emergency they tell me they will let me know if anything needs my attention...back to the omelette bar and the front 9!
@Canadian_mom73 @MichaelAvenatti I hope he gets banished from society
@rachelakleinman @MichaelAvenatti Uh way too late Rachel, everybody jumped the gun as soon as this blubbering turd spun his web...
@atticlr @MichaelAvenatti They are being transparent, this is what an investigation can look like. You want them to sit on it till the end like just about every police shooting?
@MichaelAvenatti Which is why Michael we should really look hard at any accusations of hate crimes or crimes of a political nature because there is incentive to falsify in order to write a narrative and gain sympathy. Wait, examine evidence, then bloviate!
I am hugely pissed at Jussie, all the facts are not in yet so I am going to be careful here but...if that maggot lied about this whole thing and stirred the pot of hatred and fear and division in a nation half at war with itself already....then I hope he pays a harsh price! https://t.co/OfNny0xMMR
@Nalienation Hey can we short that market and make some moola? I think you are right...there is a lot of irrational exuberance in that market today https://t.co/8jDRioq0CT
@RobElgasABC7 @ABC Shame....*bell rings*....shame....*bell rings*..... https://t.co/sgpw12Xv5y
@Nalienation We should be skeptical of any accusation of a crime with special political cicrumstances...antifa mask, MAGA hat, etc.
@JCrockett623 @MrDane1982 Ah man I can't sing for shit but it's all about having a good time...alcohol tends to help as well or a wee bit of ganja
@Nalienation I'd probably let sleeping dogs lie on the Smollet story since most folks on the left took that bait hook line and sinker. It hurts the movement towards Social Justice just as the last couple of crazy accusations against Kavanaugh hurt that effort. Trust but verify people!
@JCrockett623 @MrDane1982 How about Piano Man by Billy Joel...sweet lyrics that song
@Lenoc005 @Tennsass1 You got your 2000...congrats
@VictorBlackwell @TrumpsareNazis The story smelled to me on day 1 and so I reserved judgement and watched the left pile on with giddy glee just like the Covington situation. Murika loves a rush to judgement, wiser heads keep their powder dry and see what is learned! https://t.co/X92WnQVQo2
@AOC @guardian #PROJECTELM eat less meat...that is a huge step we ALL can take right now. Just eat less meat every week, every day, cut it in half. Eat less chicken, less pork, less beef, eat more vegetables...just a little thing and it will make a huge difference! #PROJECTELM https://t.co/X4NfQ6qPeR
@MrDane1982 Brandy by Looking Glass but I always have to bring a couple of people up on stage with me to sing the dooo-dooo-dooo-dooo-doo etc
@COOLLAD82768667 @Avemiajul @TalkSportsAZ @krassenstein I was being ironic, which some of you are apparently too stupid to realize and yet you call American's ignorant...lol https://t.co/9IYFEAg6SV
@cruzcerda3 @essenviews @AOC @pewresearch Can you find some nations out there that have done better over the last 54 years so we have something to compare to?
@Avemiajul @COOLLAD82768667 @TalkSportsAZ @krassenstein That's just bs. This is still a great country, better than most not as good as some. Of course just spewing insults won't make it any better. That's the job of everyone who cares about this country. https://t.co/LeALpPoEhb
@Kapp4774 @essenviews @AOC Well I don't know how long you are going to live but there is always a chance. Anyways I don't want socialism...maybe what they have in Denmark, that would be nice.
Now see this is the kind of thing that kills the movement towards social justice in this country. Just as some of the crazy Kavanugh accusers (some of whom had to recant) hurt the attempt to keep him off the court. If true shame on Jussie and those who assumed so much so soon! https://t.co/OvvNUTAB1U
Chicago detectives are 'eager to speak to Jussie Smollett' after new information emerges followin... https://t.co/8Se4e6xStN via @GMA
@ciccmaher Is scarcely a punitive thing, Russian military is always cheaper than U.S so the U.S essentially did them a favor, Why Venezuela thinks it needs expensive jets when people are starving is another ? The U.S could invade and occupy Venezuela in a matter of days if it chose to
@traumen351 @ciccmaher That is simply not true. Most sanctions are fairly recent and the previous sanctions have been completely ignored by two major powers Russia and China so mitigating their impact. I notice the article says nothing about that. Forcing them to turn to Russia for jets they don't need
@UmbrellaAcad on @netflix  Not too shabby, kind of Watchmen and Suicide Squad redux with a dollop of @VancityReynolds , the sound track is muy bueno. I hope this will be a series worth watching...on episode 1 now!
@ThisLoudIsFire @essenviews @AOC Don't forget prior to that you elected the Trumpenstein didn't ya? Gonna need another Blue Wave in 2020 to make up for that i'm afraid... https://t.co/qwu5TGMwqY
@krassenstein Uh yeah...no....there is no sealed indictment on the President. I bet your bottom dollar. We don't indict sitting Presidents we impeach them-it is all set out in the constitution. The DOJ has already determined you cannot indict a sitting President. The others...maybe so https://t.co/lGlayhRsjI
@MaryJohanna6 @essenviews @AOC ocialist economists are critical of private property as socialism aims to substitute private property in the means of production for social ownership or public property. well by the above definition you are correct!
@enrhddbbd @porkchopsuit @TwitterMoments Is there a reason you  ended that with a question mark? Do you understand what a question mark signifies? I just used two of them, maybe you can figure it out from the context? Ooops there is another one! https://t.co/U4EMdRhGXZ
@JulietRobeck OMG that is so ironic...
@Nalienation Gotta disagree, have not seen Vice but Bale has been in a few good films, he is a talent. He is no Anthony Hopkins but he is Brad Pittish foh sho
@krassenstein Wait are we outraged that Merrick Garland got screwed or outraged that this President is doing what he is constitutionally required to do or is it the combination? Justices almost never recuse themselves it is just historically rare. Maybe the Chief Justice will redeem the court
@TrumpsareNazis @RWPUSA Thoughts and Prayers...thoughts and prayers....thoughts and prayers.... https://t.co/3ebn2N3Z4s
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher @NaomiAKlein Terrific video...very interesting stuff
@ElaineKeagle @essenviews @AOC Socialism isn't spending it is control-government taking over healthcare, utilities, communications, whatever. That is what it has always meant to me. I'm not even saying I am opposed to that but I think a plurality of Americans is. Hard to argue with Government messing things up
@enrhddbbd @porkchopsuit @TwitterMoments Are you ok little buddy? What happened, someone spit on your MAGA hat? It's ok...if it makes you feel any better you can vent your anger on me. I am here to help. https://t.co/GRnVRox0tK
@iamofdaniel @revrrlewis Ah Gazebos....one of the few words you can use in a song to rhyme with placebos...I know I've done it before https://t.co/aJC9EE6nNQ
@ThisLoudIsFire @essenviews @AOC Lol....I love it! https://t.co/X8jXITBrcE
@TalkSportsAZ @Avemiajul @krassenstein Yes there is no country like America...we are exceptional and unique so no solutions that work elsewhere should EVER be considered here! I get it....
@essenviews I love @AOC but we should be careful not to get too progressive too fast, Murika still has alot of middle aged white folks in flyover country that will balk at anything smelling of socialism
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I was stationed at Rosey Roads many years ago when I was in the navy, during the summer I showered three times a day it was so dang humid. Beautiful place though I hope things are better since the hurricane
@Dax_x98 @PhyddleDD regrettably sir you are correct...there is definitely no god....however prayer is beneficial just as meditation can be, and it is certainly not worth troubling your Grandma further to argue with her about her delusion about the man in the moon...blessings
@Popularvote102 @ProudResister Negative....Hilly Clinton running a crap campaign and decades of GOP disinformation about the Clintons is why we are in this mess
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher And a military industrial complex to stir dissent if the government threatens to nationalize my coffee factory
@USATODAY Note to employers, make sure you know which of your workers is carrying and fire the ones who aren't! Can't be too careful in Murika! https://t.co/2UCr2SZ730
@MeWritesGood @JohnKasich @GOP Come on man...GOP is GOP it is bone deep, they cannot bite the hand that feeds them though amusingly enough Jeff 'Dick Pic" Bezos is pretty damn liberal. Still it is Pavlovian response to corporations n'cest pas? https://t.co/rvt3WayUoS
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher well unfortunately there is always a new war around the corner
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher But we get nothing from haiti and puerto rico that we don't already have, same hting for venezuela we already buy their oil, it is not like after we occupied Iraq we got their oil for free or even discounted-thats what I have issues with-what is the gain for USA
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Of course you always want more
@RWPUSA Why? Why is it not acceptable. 'Splain yourself sir
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Supply and demand yes pretty basic
@Avemiajul @krassenstein You did more than buyback some guns...you sharply restricted ownership and made buyback mandatory that is the same thing as confiscation to a gun owner believe me. And I applaud it!
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher So far so good
@PeytonFaucett @marwilliamson @TotaLuv2Tweet I'm kind of afraid to even though my job would be ever so difficult to automate, plus I am old so I think I will scrape through. But I worry about my son's future. I will consider it...
@shenanigans052 @smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein I'm afraid you really don't Tom...sigh...thank YOU for playing and MAGA to you to sir! https://t.co/Rh3YCvDvgd
@thedailybeast Uh who cares...really....come on
@Gianfarte @smarmyEOD @krassenstein Nice! More gun equals a safer Murika! I could not agree more https://t.co/poatZ6BV4l
@shenanigans052 Chalupa...mmmm....I love them
@shenanigans052 @smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Because knocking out criminal access to guns would be nearly impossible unless you have some solutions in that giant dome of yours to share?
@marwilliamson @TotaLuv2Tweet Oh hey are you running for President too? Maybe we should just make a note of who ISN'T running for the Democratic nomination...that would be easier. I will raise my hand! I think our old white man quota will be filled with Biden/Bernie
@marwilliamson @TotaLuv2Tweet Cannot get into UBI it is a bridge too far for me and I think for most Americans.
@shenanigans052 @smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Causation and correlation...please Tommy Irish go look up those words. By your twisted logic if we just issued every American five or six guns there would be NO gun violence....smdh https://t.co/eEM5iUn5Qm
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I gotta tell you most of us here in Murika could not give two craps about most other countries and their spoils...so that bit of convoluted logic is hard for me to follow. This isn't bread and circuses Rome anymore...and we are a service economy not so much conquest anymore
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher you have given me alot to think about and to research...thanks!
@MeWritesGood @AngrierWHStaff I'm just not going to get carried away like my brothers/sisters in the resistance celebrating hashtag popularity and relishing each little leak or indictment. When you are planning on killing the King you must kill the king. I prefer to be rationale/ hopeful...keep my powder dry!
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I think yes they did go soft. Bush was too busy actually invading countries and of course Obama was chasing Bin Laden. Seriously I'm pretty sure the U.S. could mostly not give a flying fck about the little third world paradises out there. Bigger fish to fry my friend.
@MeWritesGood Illinois ranks 4th or 5th in hardest states to buy firearms-well behind California where I live. That certainly supports my contention. Waiting period, background check, FOID, it certainly is more burdensome than 30 plus other states so....
@iamofdaniel @MichaelAvenatti Yeah very Michael Jacksonish...though for me Michael's music was far better than R Kelly's and Michael was not dumb enough to videotape anything. You gotta wonder how shitty the dads were that the sons grew up so twisted...ugh
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Yeah well enough time in DC and all your crimes are washed away. It's like confession only you don't have to waste your time saying Hail Marys!
@dailyexception Oh not that you are at all incorrect in your primary assertion. #PROJECTELM
@dailyexception Just an FYI using dumbfuck as a salutation or moniker isn't going to change any minds so you are really just orally masturbating-why respond at all if your not going to make an effort to educate? Kisses!
@MeWritesGood @AngrierWHStaff You are so right! It drives me nuts though because words have meaning and using the right word is infinitely preferable to someone like me who makes a living using the correct words.
@WAKEUPA97357536 @ProudResister @SenatorBurr Thank God you are easing off of collusion! I hope there is enough evidence but I will wait for it and not spout a woody at the hope of it happening!
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Come on John put a cork in it. Our suicide rates are equivalent to other developed nations, our successful first time suicide rates are much higher-why because we have guns. Now I'm gonna block you because I cannot spend the rest of my life fighting off your silly tweets. mazel
@WAKEUPA97357536 @ProudResister @SenatorBurr @maddow Dude there is NO SUCH CRIME AS COLLUSION. Read a fcking book will you. Tying any of this to Trump himself which is all we want-well I have not seen anything yet that does that. Again COLLUSION IS NO CRIME
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein I was more referring to the husband who shoots his wife and kids. Or the neighbor who shoots his neighbor or the kid playing with daddies unlocked firearm who blows his sister away. But again it does NOT matter.  Less guns less gun deaths is too obvious apparently to comprehend
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Take a break John....you are changing no minds here. VT Shooting of  what 20 something...VT Hammer attack that it would be replaced with 1 dead 2 wounded. VT Spatula attack...1 embarassed 1 irritated. Oh and thanks for the 20 year old statistics...yikes!
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein yeah I'm gonna have to take a hard pass. I was banned from Quora for trying to educate thunderheads and I'm not gonna lose my twitter privileges yet-I just started on here. Ban matches?
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein What are you babbling about Hillbilly? Ooops....now I certainly did not intend for that to come out like that...yikes
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein You realize your article does not support your assertion right? Did you mean to post to something else? It reaches no conclusions but does remind us how difficult it is to compare the U.S to other countries. Murika is unique!
@MichaelAvenatti We coming for you PERIOD?  Maybe they just hate punctuation marks? We coming for you SEMICOLON! Hmmm.....
@RWPUSA I'm curious why was it ok to boycott South Africa and it is not ok to boycott Israel? And by the way I love Israel, I have friends there, I have been there and I would never boycott them but...where do you get off saying it is somehow wrong?
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein That would not decrease mass shootings or most domestic gun violence or suicides etc...I'm sure it would do wonders for thug on thug shootings but as I have explained.... https://t.co/2BKaFCC0lv
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Again you are right but oh so wrong. Murika doesn't care about those gun deaths they care about the highly publicized shocking death of innocents by generally lawful gun owning people who just SNAP! By the way I own a Glock 19 and i hope will only range fire it ever!
@ProudResister @SenatorBurr One is not contradicting the other you can believe them both. You have smoke you have no smoking gun. Salivation sensations must be put on hold. Let's see what everyone is holding before we push all in
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein We know one thing. 100% of the gun deaths that occur in the home, occurred because there was a gun present. 100%. We also know that if you own a gun you have provided the only necessary ingredient for a gun death. Professional risk manager eh-sorry but I fail to see relevance
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein The other murders barely register. The nation politic cares about citizens being murdered not thugs murdering another. I truly get your point about but their possession of guns is ALREADY criminalized. Let's criminalize the smaller subset too! (this is somewhat satirical)
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Do you think any of the pols care about the drug slaying and the gang slayings and the murders during commission of another felony? We are talking about the big ticket items here. Husband shoots wife and family, dude drives to bank shoots everyone, dude shoots up church
@porkchopsuit @enrhddbbd @TwitterMoments Oh darn are we not gonna be besties now? https://t.co/UUFkVmnP4h
@Gianfarte @smarmyEOD @krassenstein Could not agree more. Owning a gun increases your risk of dying by a gun-it absolutely does in all cases. It is only logical is it not? Odds are better your wife kills you with the gun then you use it to defend her. Even better odds you simple off yourself with your gun.
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein I agree they are statistically insignificant. Your #3 point is pure conjecture. And feel free to suggest ways to winnow out the 'homicidal' lurking amongst the citizenry. Every nation has them but most nations don't allow them such unfettered access to killing tools.
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein The ole Murika is an outlier with a violent culture and if we banned guns they'd kill each other with fire and poison and edged weapons and cars canard.If you really believe this country is so different from others I suppose u r entitled to that view but no evidence supports it
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Right because there is a huge demand and use of automatic weapons in this country. You people have nothing but excuses for not doing anything at all. I'd probably swap 100 million people owning semi automatics for 15000 owning automatic weapons...let me crunch some numbers
@SaltyWorley @TrumpsTaxes @Acosta Jon I loath Acosta, he is often correct but he is such a pompous self aggrandizing twat that I feel like Walter Cronkite would punch him in the gonads. Again I agree with Jim most of the time but he is an exceedingly unpleasant man
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Again you are probably not being obtuse you just can't help yourself. We are talking about how to reduce gun violence by for the most part non criminals. Nobody is bemoaning gang shootings. Most guns used in domestic violence and mass shootings are legally obtained-fact!
@justinamash Unfortunately Justin most of the National Emergencies declared prior to this one have been equally NOT emergencies unless you think it critical to our national security to sanction a Russian banker?
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Oh and mad props for EOD that is a tough job...respect!
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein You have to collect ALL the guns silly...ALL the guns...it is a simple proposition is it not? Also and this one will floor you...a gun is never being used to commit a crime until IT IS! Most shooters are law abiding gun owners till they are NOT
@enrhddbbd @TwitterMoments Sure buddy. Because they would have quickly identified the assailant and taken him out! They would not have shot somebody else or themselves as 50 people drew their hogs to defend themselves...nah that could never happen...u make me smile sir!
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein I do love big words...but I like few gun deaths even more. You cannot disprove the eminently logical conclusion that less guns equals less gun deaths. I assure you if there were NO guns there would be NO gun deaths. I can absolutely guarantee it in fact!
I'm watching Ellen Page talking to a chimpanzee in a suit. #TheUmbrellaAcademy on Netflix. I do love Ellen Page...and the Chimp has a English accent (of course) so I am intrigued
@realDonaldTrump What? No thought and prayers? Come on DJT! https://t.co/kL0ue3oSK3
@TwitterMoments X people killed in mass shooting...thoughts and prayers...predictable outrage from liberals/progressives...conservatives call for arming more X...something else happens...rinse and repeat ad nauseum https://t.co/gAIWYlvrFL
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Yeah just the evidence of the rest of the world and their nearly non existent gun homicide rates....that's all we got
@Goingincircles @Avemiajul @Gianfarte @krassenstein I am ok with them using hammers aka China...I give myself even money odds on surviving a hammer attack....a gun attack and I am less sanguine
@smarmyEOD @Gianfarte @krassenstein Only because crime in general in going down, please don't be so stupid as to conflate one number with another. By that measure we should have a billion guns, then gun violence would disappear.
@ProudResister Well at least he spelled everything correctly. I'd have asked for some punctuation too but you can't have everything from the inbred domestic terrorist type.
@AngrierWHStaff Have you looked up "collusion" yet?
@krassenstein I'm a fool then, he lied about his contacts with reporters to the Inspector General,lied about it to Comey h(his boss) as well. Now he is peddling a book. Now he can be heroic and a liar too don't get me wrong but I don't think this is a guy we should be worshipping
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Just so I am clear. This rosy socialist paradise was destroyed by the Imperialist West probably so that no socialist nation would prosper. So they subtly destroyed a nation to demonstrate their power &amp; malign the Bolivarian Revolution eh? Pretty tinfoil hat wearing sounding 2 me
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Aristide said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti's chief of staff came to his house to say he would be killed "and a lot of Haitians would be killed" if he refused to resign immediately and said he "has to go now." This is NOT a coup by any definition-we saved his life probably
@MJliberty26 @Gianfarte @krassenstein Nothing....how could you possibly think we could take them away only from people who shouldn't have them? It has all been a zero sum game with guns till we get a whole lot better at evaluating mental illness and AI predictive behavior algorithms
@MJliberty26 @Gianfarte @krassenstein I guess we will find out won't we? Maybe we shouldn't pull a Covington and argue the point till we have the facts eh?
@Avemiajul @krassenstein Averre look up "automatic weapon" which is what a machine gun is. Then look up "semi-automatic" weapon which is what they sell in this country. You should have some grasp of the facts before hyperventilating...just a tiny bit would suffice
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I can pretty much guarantee you that our government doesn't really care who runs Haiti-certainly not in this administration. Look you don't like the USA...I get it...sorry for your troubles. Next hurricane is all on you then ok?
@Avemiajul @krassenstein Uh yeah almost none percent of any shootings take place with an AK 47. And an AR-15 is not a weapon of war, that's just silly talk. In California they can only fire 22 caliber with a limited magazine capacity. And NOBODY is using a machine gun. You've watched too much tv!
@AOC I love her tweets...I don't always agree but they are as cute as chinese baby, as cute as a bucket of puppies, as cute as a baby panda in drag....
@bsimmons11b @kimfriberg @cworl00 @Gianfarte @krassenstein Defintely PTSD folks should not have guns, they killed the American Sniper for goodness sakes. Bulemia, Anorexia that would be fine...they can barely hold onto a gun.
@bsimmons11b @kimfriberg @cworl00 @Gianfarte @krassenstein There is not alot of stigma to not owning a gun. Most Americans don't own a gun. I think they can live with that stigma. It is not like we brand them or anything.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Not much these days we got bigger fish to fry
@kimfriberg @Gianfarte @cworl00 @krassenstein Come on @Gianfarte ,alot of gun owners think gun control is baby steps towards confiscation. Little secret (shhhh), if we really want to end gun violence we will have to confiscate. It is assinine to think anything else works. UK has little gun violence because they have no guns!
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Those are inaccurate numbers, cite your source. You are claiming PR contributed 23000 per citizen to the US Treasury....lol...that is hilarious....I am calling you out on this one pal-straight out lies
@bsimmons11b @kimfriberg @cworl00 @Gianfarte @krassenstein I would say YES. All mental illnesses of any kind should be disqualifying from Autism to Bipolar. Why not? Gun ownership should be a privilege not a right. it should be like driving a car. Sure we have that pesky constitutional interpretation to get past...sigh
@BroncosBurner @Gianfarte @krassenstein Uh Bronco Billy...more guns is definitively NOT the answer. It is so illogical that I am always embarassed to hear it proposed. https://t.co/9LCh8YgYM3
@Gianfarte @MJliberty26 @krassenstein Yeah Greg Chicago's problem isn't out of state gun purchases but it won't hurt to do this it just won't help much and the expenditure of political capital would be better served in efforts that actually make a difference.
@JohnOrJane @KamalaHarris Very good but does nothing about the 300 million guns already out there so half a solution
Good thing Illinois has some of the nation's strictest gun control laws right? ⚡️ “Five victims and gunman slain in Aurora, Illinois, shooting”		https://t.co/83paqA36n3 https://t.co/GcwzLFeupq
@cworl00 @kimfriberg @Gianfarte @krassenstein I think I explained it Braniac. They are for insurance. You know like if a Solar Flare cripples the electric grid and food don't come by my house no more etc. etc. I agree they are a tool. A tool made to kill. They are not a tool made to defend your family.
@Gianfarte @cworl00 @kimfriberg @krassenstein I thought the topic was gun control was it not? As all gun owners know 'gun control' is code for gun confiscation and ZOG and all kinds of bad stuff. #MOLONLABE
@daSlackAttack @TinaDesireeBerg @FIlevered @shaunking @ltthompso @AOC Uh that's tangential to the uh....point......😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜
@wjsullivanii @TinaDesireeBerg @FIlevered @shaunking @ltthompso @AOC Ooops totally sorry I misread your tweet...you are saying what I am saying...I'll go delete my tweet....grin
@TinaDesireeBerg @FIlevered @shaunking @ltthompso @AOC Lol that's tangential to the point....Oh my god you are funny. You said it was private, it turns out it is public-THAT IS THE ENTIRE POINT.  Please look up the word tangential. Also this dude does seem like a creeper who is wrong but ur response-hilarious!
@TexasDan @ltthompso @AOC Good thing this is not Columbia eh?
@ltthompso @AOC Dude did u just dox him-what phone number is that? Should have blurred it out at least. I don' think this is a story here. If he is getting paid we will find out that stuff is all public
ONLY ONE THING will reduce deaths by guns including suicides by gun. Reducing the number of guns in circulation. NOTHING else will work, EVERYTHING else is just political gaslighting. Now lets work on Climate Control where a million diff things can help! https://t.co/WGKXyD6M9R
@cworl00 @kimfriberg @Gianfarte @krassenstein Also Carl...what makes you think your family is in anyway threatened? You running a meth lab out there? Not paying off the neighborhood Triad? This is a pretty safe country kimo sabe. https://t.co/8OdSLcWVNT
@kimfriberg @cworl00 @Gianfarte @krassenstein I'd happily take it away. I own guns myself, two of them. I'm not stupid enough to think they are to defend my family. They are an insurance policy for the future. Believe me if I ever have to use my guns we are in a world of hurt on this planet! https://t.co/t6BWIqzMek
@cworl00 @kimfriberg @Gianfarte @krassenstein You can defend them with your savage wit. Frankly the numbers say you are far more likely to kill your family or be killed by them or for your son to blow the neighbor;s kid away than any self defense with a gun. Those are the facts Jack! https://t.co/jkHJZjQmof

@ppace60657 @ProudResister Pence just for knowing the guy? The bar for impeachment is a little higher than that Paul...
@Q4NYY @ProudResister @nvygrl1 Good idea let's f*ck up traffic for working people and annoy the folks in the flyover states and get this goon re-elected! Keep your powder dry, the system is working as it is supposed to. This long national nightmare is fading
@Popularvote102 @ProudResister Guess what would happen then? We;d be deluged with adds in CA, NY, TX , FL, IL, GA, PA, OH and that rest of the country would not even know there was an election going on. Don't worry the right is old and dying...we can win both pop and electoral!
@ProudResister James Buchanan, 15th President . Serving as president during the run-up to the Civil War, Buchanan's inability to halt the southern states' drive toward secession has led most historians to consider his presidency a failure-this guy might have been worse-might! https://t.co/xuEU7p6isM
@KamalaHarris Blah blah blah none of the ideas I have heard are any good or will do much to reduce gun violence. Background checks won't do anything. We have everything she is talking about already in California and more than our share of gun violence
@Vixen95Trish @Gianfarte @krassenstein Or at least register them
@Gianfarte @krassenstein We have those in California Greg, we even have restrictions on magazine size but we get all kinds of fun mass shootings and gun homicides nonetheless...
@Vixen95Trish @Gianfarte @krassenstein Those are homocide rates correct? Try gun homocide rates. I bet some of those Australian Homocides were committed by Wallabies and Roos...quite a kick they pack! https://t.co/CkJLX505gD
@realTuckFrumper @krassenstein That is a bigly degree sir!
I don't 'do' gun control because I know it won't work. I would do gun buybacks, and criminalizing the new sale of semi automatic weapons, real powerful things that have ZERO chance of being passed into law. But BG checks-not an issue-they really aren't not statistically speaking
@Gianfarte @krassenstein To me it is a waste of effort. And to be brutally honest more people die from falling off ladders than from mass shootings every year. Climate change is going to ruin billions of lives, guns in America-we have a decreasing crime rate here in the USA
@Gianfarte @krassenstein Easy answer, make owning guns prohibitively expensive. Make gun owners carry liability insurance. Charge the gun owner with manslaughter if their gun is used in a homicide even if used by the kids or stolen and used. Put a tax on guns of 500%. I will still own mine-I have money
@kimfriberg @Gianfarte @krassenstein Why do you think there are so many illegal guns, they are dwarfed by legally purchased guns which represent the vast majority of guns used in mass shootings
@MJliberty26 @Gianfarte @krassenstein You must have no mass shootings in Illinois....whooops....don't you have Chicago in that state? https://t.co/oeoee3WbOW
@Reuters Uber is a NOT a side hustle is is just a hustle. It is bad for the planet bad for the drivers but darn it as a consumer it is great!
@Gianfarte @krassenstein Greg I don't disagree with you but there are very few documented cases of mass shootings being committed by anyone other than a completely lawful gun owner. So we are bloviating over something that will have almost no effect. Suicides maybe more of an impact...I agree with u ther
@sarahkendzior @joncoopertweets @Jim_Jordan Wasn't Trump elected? Or are you going to go with the delusional "I do't recognize the Electoral College' approach?

@CBSNews I think he may have opened up his text from @JeffBezos....sad
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Look we will never agree, I don't see conspiracies everywhere and the big bad West trying to keep little countries like Haiti down. I see us pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into those countries after every coup, famine, earthquake and hurricane. Lets agree to disagree
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Oh man come on....nobody wants a former slave state to fail just because it was a former slave state. Besides, lets face it, none of these countries are too successful are they?  You cannot blame the West for everything. Its like being an adult and blaming ma and pa
@AngrierWHStaff It is nice to dream. I know you are smart enough to know that collusion other than anti-trust collusion is NOT A CRIME. Why do you folks insist on yelling collusion? What you are looking for is CONSPIRACY. Accuracy is always important-please try again
@krassenstein I hate to tell you this but no gun control as currently proposed would end or even likely reduce mass shootings. You are going to have to go for confiscation of weapons AKA Australia and good luck paying for and collecting 300 million firearms!
@chadfelixg What! How dare you disagree with AOC or agree in such a way that one can construe you actually have disagreed! What is your major malfunction numb nuts! (quote from FMJ). You had better work on your cognitive dissonance my friend! https://t.co/FqQFpZmqth
@funder Seriously what does a number 1 hashtag get you? Are there any cash or prizes? It is a joke isn't it? #HashtagsDontDoDick
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Oh and yes huge corruption, drugs, far too much involvement by the mililtary (let's face it the military knows how to do one thing pretty well not run businesses), isolation politically from neighbors did not help.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Not any one thing but loads of mismanagement, selling off oil cheaply to socialist/communist allies, subsidizing too much, nationalizing key industries (govt almost always does worse than private business), brain drain, opposition certainly acted as a drag on the economy...etc
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher According to what I research PR is  net drag on the U.S economy, love to see where you get your figures from. https://t.co/awu6aALjCo
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Puerto rico should look around and ask itself what independent nation they would rather be like-Haiti-Dominican Republic-etc. The people are probably better off as a U.S. territory. Heck what if you were made a state? That would be good no?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Both of our logics fall apart, you are ok with Chavez attempting a coup and yet being able to run for President but not ok with opposition leaders doing the same.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher That's a good point!
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Yeah that is a crime bud....in any country in the world even a socialist paradise
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Past yes we did absolutely like many other countries, present we don't. Find something from this century if you can.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Threats are against the law, it is not protected speech. Look I appreciate your passion but we don't believe the same things. I would never use the word imperialism it is just so cliche. Oligarchy now there is a word I would use for alot of countries
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher That was your LAW not ours and it was repealed on the basis that it was unconstitutional as protected by freedom of speech within Article II of the Constitution of Puerto Rico and the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
@TotaLuv2Tweet @MichaelAvenatti @GloriaAllred  Come on Susan how can you not know who Gloria Allred is? She was @MichaelAvenatti before it was cool to be @MichaelAvenatti
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Im pretty sure if Puerto Rico voted to become an independent nation we'd be happy to let them go, they are a drain on our economy. Has a referendum passed voting for independence&gt; If not then the people must not want it
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I am claiming that they were NOT in existence. Now that they are things will of course get worse. But you can't blame venezuela's situation on sanctions since they did not exist till recently.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Sorry I meant he participated in a coup. I guess since he did he should have been imprisoned and NOT ALLOWED to run for election since that is the BS reason you claim many opposition leaders could not run for election-be consistent!
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I'm saying in the case of the Ukraine it DID NOT happen. George was trying to militarily recapture a breakaway province that broke away aided by Russia. And if you read history you would see that Hitlers pretext to invade was persecution of German minorities in the sudentland
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Let me ask you something. Is Haiti of importance geo politically? Do they have any important resources (other than poor people) that an Imperialist nation would want to have. I will give you a hint...NO. Haiti is insignificant in every way. It fails the logic test...come on!
@ABC He certainly can do this. Look at the national emergencies declared by Presidents in the past, typically sanctions and other measures. He should not have done it but to say he can't is to ignore reality, somethings Dems do far too often
@joncoopertweets @funder @TheDemCoalition Nothing more effective at changing policy than a new hashtag...viva la resistance! https://t.co/fVuADwRwUO
Pretty sure Adam like most politicians doesn't know much about guns. If you want to potentially make mass shootings less deadly you need to criminalize magazine capacity and rate of fire. If you want to make them stop-you  will need magic powers. Assault Rifle is a red herring https://t.co/7R0j7ykZAZ
@CarlosDiaz1818 @WSJ 3.5 million a year is peanuts, it is those evangelical Christians who adore Israel (cuz of the bible) that give Aipac its formidable lobbying power.
@RepAdamSchiff Y'all realize an assault weapon is an assault weapon merely because of cosmetic changes. A weapon is either a semi automatic or it is not and that is what you should be targeting. Most gun violence is with a semi automatic pistol like my Glock 19.

@RealJamesWoods I thought that story stunk to high heaven as soon as it came out. Unlike alot of folks though I reserved judgement waiting for more facts. America did the same thing in the Covington situation too. Why can't we be rational and patient?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Yes sir you are correct...Canada doesn't fit into any of those categories though...not in my opinion
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Well we agree on that though there is no such thing as the right to invade another country if it attacks your ethnics...that is a very Hitler thing to do isn't it?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Just consider this. If the U.S were to just pull out of Puerto Rico and not recognize Puerto Ricans as U.S. Citizens and you could run your own affairs your own way-do you think the people of P.R would be better off? I don't. I've been to PR, lovely place, not ready self govern
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Because were found guilty of committing a crime. Nobody is in jail here because of their political beliefs only their actions
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Chavez came to power in a coup. Again why is your coup good and any other coup bad? You cannot have it both ways.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Sorry my friend you cannot use a quote from this rag which has permanent headings of US Interventionism etc..it is laughably biased
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher It is not factual to claim that the U.S caused the problems in Venezuela or even exacerbated them. Sanctions occurred well after Venezuela leadership had run their nation into the ground. THAT is a fact-you just ignore it.
Amazon blasts Ocasio-Cortez, says 'we don't want to work in this environment in the long term' https://t.co/mTk8BprEtL #FoxNews I am pretty sure Amazon did not need the tax break. No more corporate welfare. Jeff 'Dick Pic' Bezos can afford it!
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I really don't swallow the political prisoner thing for the U.S. We have far too many African Americans in prison and that's a travesty but we don't lock up our opponents because we fear running against them. We do suppress their followers votes though...grin
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher It doesnt matter why they fought wherever they fought. DO you think Russia and China are imperialists? Because China fought Vietnam and India and Russia has fought Ukraine and Georgia. Are only countries that don;t have armies non imperialist? I'm genuinely puzzled
@funder I don't think they determine mental capacity in annual physical but keep hope alive Scott....smdh
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Unfortunately it is illogical to claim that if the OAS doesn't intercede everywhere it cannot intercede anywhere. There was no coup in Brazil. Your claim illegal acts neceessitated arrests in Venezuela but the Brazilian arrest of Lula can't be correct? Thats pretty inconsistent
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Some help for you on Imperialism-the policy, practice, or advocacy of extending the power and dominion of a nation especially by direct territorial acquisitions or by gaining indirect control over the political or economic life of other areas.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher The definition of imperialist is not and never has been fighting in wars along with your allies. Some naked territorial aggression has to be part of imperialism. Some desire to acquire other natiosn resources, people, etc. None of that holds true for Canada. Look up Imperialism
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Yes guess how much time she got in jail? Yup...good guess 0 days...c'est la difference in a Democracy my friend...
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher What says it was rigged to me are a few things, opposition candidate jailed, opposition parties banned, electorial commission stacked with partisan Maduroa loyalists and an incredibly poor turnout. We must agree to disagree
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Yeah I suppose if that is your world view than that is what you are going to believe. I just find it hard to put Canada in that category as they have never had an empire or been particularly imperialistic in modern times.
@funder Lol you want him impeached for breathing, Slow your roll, let the courts decide. Alot of Presidents have declared national emergencies for even sillier crap like sanctioning bankers...nobody is getting impeached over this particular move. https://t.co/HaCXKIVsqg
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Are you serious? It is not because he knew he would lose in court, it is because he thought he could browbeat the House into giving him the money. Trump does stuff all the time that loses in court. Honestly Ted for a bright guy you say some silly stuff,
@Zigmanfreud I thought this story smelled from the beginning much like the MAGA hat wearing High Schoolers and all that opprobrium. Keep your powder drive and get the facts before bloviating is good advice for everyone!
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Because of this, the European Union,the Organization of American States, the Lima Group and countries including Australia and the United States rejected the electoral process. Are the OAS Imperialists? Lima Group?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher 2/2 including the lack of the Constituent Assembly's competencies to summon the elections, impeding participation of opposition political parties, and the lack of time for standard electoral functions.[11]
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher 1/2 Several Venezuelan NGOs, such as Foro Penal Venezolano, Súmate, Voto Joven [es], the Venezuelan Electoral Observatory and the Citizen Electoral Network, expressed their concern over the irregularities of the electoral schedule.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Yes we don't arrest the opposition in Democracies for made up crimes-that is something that happens in China, Venezuela, North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, do you think this is a list of good countries to live in?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Hey you are not wrong but it isn't killing Russias economy or other oil producers. Why don't you look up how much Venezuelan output has plummeted under Maduro? You cannot blame all of this on some imperialist strategy. Canada is a leading backer of opposition...not an imperialist
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher and plenty come from mismanagement, over promising, and catastrophic failures to find the right people to help you govern. The revolution has brought not much good to Venezuela, time for a new one I think, But we disagree...time will tell eh?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher We got nothing out of Iraq but misery we do NOT control their oil.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Did I miss some coup attempts? Did you know how Chavez came to power? Is your coup better than my coup? Coup coup ca-choo.....
@jgge123 @Zigmanfreud @POTUS And it is utterly useless as we saw in Clinton's case. You want to make a statement or you want to make a difference? Seriously wake up! Lets' do something that matters, that works, and not dream about 15 plus GOP Senators voting to remove @realDonaldTrump
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Wait a second buddy are you saying that till ALL wrongs are addressed NO wrongs should be addressed. Come on man, even you can see the logical fallacy in that one my brother. And I think Guatemala can give Columbia a run for its money
This guy is why anti Trump folks get a bad name sometimes. Big on name calling, short on facts, and living with his head in a cloud. Stop praying for rain (Trumps impeachment) and work towards electing Democrats in 2020! https://t.co/6P6n4bgXDV
@MichaelAvenatti @SGcrimlaw lawyers job is to defend no matter the scumbag....are you saying some folks don't deserve effective representation @MichaelAvenatti ?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Maduro imprisoned opposition leaders, banned political parties from submitting candidates. Turnout by other than government sources is estimated at under 30%. Many non US organizations called the elections neither free nor fair. I think if we disagree on this point we are stuck?
@Zigmanfreud @POTUS Also nice that you ignore the fact that Clinton was charged with perjury as well which is what I said. I will await your acknowledgement. The funny thing is we are on the same side here. I am just not a fanciful dreamer-Trump will not be impeached
@Zigmanfreud @POTUS Look John I know for a fact you are no constitutional scholar and name calling is so Trumpian you should be above that. You are correct that impeachment is the charges and then the finding by the House. The Senate did acquit. SO in essence not much of an impeachment.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I have to admit I don't know what they have done. However, that is not the point. They deserve to exist and not have their power revoked by Presidential fiat. Stacking the courts, jailing opposition leaders, this is what Putin does...why do you think it is ok to do?
@Zigmanfreud @JCobbler15 @POTUS No such thing. Find a case where anyone has been convicted of jury tampering because of their tweets. The wishful thinking out there is palpable and sad. Just elect a Democrat in 2020 that's what we have to do
@jgge123 @Zigmanfreud @POTUS As you can plainly see my friend, impeachment without removal is like Led without Zeppelin...that dog won't hunt
@jgge123 @Zigmanfreud @POTUS Impeachment without removal from office is a pretty lame victory @jgge123, is that what we want?The Constitution defines impeachment of civil officers who may be impeached and removed only for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors".
@Zigmanfreud @POTUS Wow what a jagoff you are calling someone a moron. Clinton was NOT successfully impeached as there are two parts to an impeachment and the Senate demurred. CLinton was charged with perjury and obstruction. Now who is the moron?
People Laughed When This Philly Lawyer Sued Led Zeppelin. Nobody's Laughing Now. https://t.co/xL4CmmBEyF via @phillymag  Now this a pretty good read. I myself have never been a fan of the Led Zeppelins...
@Zigmanfreud @POTUS Clinton perjured himself under oath and was not successfully impeached. I've seen zero evidence of witness/jury tampering by @POTUS . Remember John obstruction requires proving intent. "Can you take it easy on Mike" doesn't sound to me like obstruction.

@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher The poor are certainly an even bigger majority now thanks to mismanagement, corruption, etc. You cannot blame all of this on the U.S. Chavez and Maduro have squandered the world's largest proven oil reserves...
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher You are I am sure not forgetting Chavez came to power in a coup are you? Either all coups bad or no coups are bad right?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher 2/2..completely trashed Venezuela WITHOUT US and World sanctions being much of a factor. He has stacked the courts and ignored the rule of law. Venezuela's people are suffering. It is time for a change. Let's see if he can win a fair election?
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher 1/2 Look here is where we differ and I respect your opinion I really do. I believe the elections that put Maduro into office the last time were not free elections. I also believe that his constitutional convention is a naked power grab. I further believe that he and Chavez

@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Sorry my friend, that’s as biased a reporting job as I have seen in some time. It is also not proof of anything that in this one massive protest nobody was gunned down.
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Pretty sure the situation was awful before the U.S implemented sanctions or seized assets. People are dying there and have been for sometime not including those Maduros goons are actually killing

@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher Yeah I'd like to see that. Seizure of assets and sanctioning folks is often done by Presidential fiat not congressional vote. But I am always learning...
@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I imagine all kinds of things my friend, thank God they rarely come true. I don't think there is going to be any armed conflict-at least not with other states involved.

@Ricanceptualize @ciccmaher I don't think anyone is seriously contemplating troops on the ground in Venezuela-this President in particular is averse to sending in the Marines despite his bombast. Still there is no chance a resolution of this kind will pass since it constrains POTUS options.
@bandersonmedia Well Beth there are damn few female billionaires, if there were more I bet we'd see some of that behavior too...or maybe not since Women aren't early as ego driven and narcsissitic as men can be...

@ciccmaher That being said I don't think anything she said was really anti-semitic...certainly not worth all the condemnation. I think you can be a fan of Israel as a concept and not a fan of their policy execution re Palestine and the Occupied Territories...many Israelis feel the same!
@ciccmaher AIPAC doesn't really toss money around any more than the NRA does. Money isn't the motivating power. AIPAC like the NRA can mobilize voters who care passionately about Israel (many of them Evangelicals) so in that respect Omar is wrong. Jews=Money is an anti semitic trope
@vegfeminist @ciccmaher How is it a bad year for Jews in any way shape or form? Name some awful things that happened to Jews that didn't happen to Protestants, Baptists, Atheists, etc. The 50 plus killed at the country western festival-does that mean it was a bad year for Country fans too?

#PROJECTELM Eat less meat. If you eat meat every day like most Americans then eat only veggies or fish a couple or three days a week. That's all you have to do to make an impact on global warming. It is that simple. EAT LESS MEAT https://t.co/7Hh4UtxZOb
@KamalaHarris Why all this bloviating about adoption? Are those evil Trumpians stealing babies and adopting them out? Come on people. Let's not DC pizza pedophile like the conservatives do. Concentrate on what is really happening and stop making crap up!
@KamalaHarris It is silly to spend much time working against gun violence when it is so incredibly rare. More people will die falling from ladders than from a mass shooting. Let's work on climate change, poverty, education
@bigio_m @KamalaHarris You are sort of right @bigio_m but not really. At the time the 2nd amendment was to provide for State Militias which were really the only US Armed Forces that existed in any quantity. Very few folks owned muskets &amp; almost none owned pistols. But is not nearly as clear as u posit
@CNNPolitics https://t.co/6SQtmVrQKh  It is too bad that the first two Muslim Congresswomen are automatically anti-Israel. Notice I do not accuse them of anti-antisemitism, the two things are not the same. Still it is disappointing and an almost proforma "take".
Will the first Virginia pol who has NOT work blackface or raped two women please step forward....your commonwealth needs you! https://t.co/VEL5SlYfp5
@SenSanders I don't think 15.00 an hour is a living wage in CA, NY, CT and most major urban areas...do you really think that works?
@SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar is about as progressive as a can of soup...and not that Progresso stuff-that stuff is yummy! Seriously she is a moderate-remember when there were moderates in this country?
@rainnwilson Uh Rainn you are supposed to wear a mask brohamanus...they going to recognize the shite out of you....
@JoeBiden Amen Joe...let's take a principled stand for freedom in our own backyard.
Early Odds for 2020 election from me.  Tulsi Gabbard 1000-1, Elizabeth Warren 700-1, @amyklobuchar 400-1, @SenGillibrand 200-1, @KamalaHarris 50-1, @SenSanders 7 -2 @realDonaldTrump 5-2, @JoeBiden Even Money. Now this is with the current field-and it pains me to say this...but...
@cher Somebody show @cher the caps lock button puhlease...
@NateSilver538 Good article though you know as well as I do than 500 to 1 would be fair betting odds for her winning the Presidency eh @NateSilver538 ?
@RWPUSA Not that any of those principled stands are going to resonate with more than 2% of the electorate at best. In fact she is likely to take no official position nor ever be asked about any of them. She is running for President @RWPUSA not city council.
@QueenSnakes @ciccmaher I bow to your expertise, but I would settle for whatever they do have in Europe as opposed to the oligarchy we have in Murika! https://t.co/3sCiRvE3wy
@mandshingjergji @ciccmaher Uh yes my Canadian friend, following the constitution and having judges to interpret it is how many democracies work. Why I think in Canada they have something similar. In Venezuela they stacked the courts, ignored the constitution and wrote a new one-entiendes?
@funder Who is Rep Cohen? Do you mean Michael Cohen?
@MichaelAvenatti Finally something we agree on 100%....Trump would eviscerate and destroy us in 2020
@ciccmaher Ah I see so has Spain cratered it's economy, murdered hundreds of opposition protesters and blocked humanitarian for it's people? Oh no...Spain is following its constitution. Judges are ordering arrests. This is how a Democracy works @ciccmaher
@rainnwilson @rainnwilson What if kids could join a Earth Scouts club where they’d get merit badges for eating less meat, using less plastic, earth friendly projects? #PROJECTELM
@MarkHarrisNYC You do also have to note that it is pretty stupid for anyone to send dick pics to anyone in this era of surveillance and hacking. I mean for a pretty brght billionaire to do so is kind of bizaare is it not?
@JeffBezos Your my hero Jeff but please you are a smart guy...don't send d*ck pics ok? That is so stupid in this era of all encompassing surveillance and data mining and hacking. PLus aren't you like over 40...does anyone really want to see your d*ck? That being said o get 'em...!
Spend 20 minutes every day doing something good for the planet like composting, recycling, bringing your own bags, freezing leftovers to eat later instead of tossing them, turning the heat off and wearing a sweater, etc.
@ciccmaher The problem George is that many countries start out with a game plan of Socialism/Communism which sounds great on paper until it involves real people at the top with too much control who invariably start stealing. I do love what European Socialism is today-could we have that?
Recyclable Plastic is like compassionate conservative. There is no such thing! Now that China has stopped buying our plastic we aren't really recycling any of it. We must reduce use of plastics in the United States. #RESPECTOURMOTHER, #PROJECTGULP
No thank you, Mr. Pecker by Jeff Bezos https://t.co/Dv8aBUAsCR	Ok so we know Jeff Bezos has big balls now...and unfortunately we also have his big balls stuck in our head due to his d*ck pick. Remember children never send any nekkid pics of yourself on any electronic media!
@MichaelAvenatti There has got to be a time limit on this nonsense. I say any blackface before 1980 is past the statue of limitations unless there is corroborating evidence of racism like Klan Hoods, writings, or recorded speechs, or any use of the N word. Let's be rational adults here!
@funder That's a complete shot in the dark by you @funder , you have no idea why they voted no though the instinctive reaction of the Republican herd to vote no for anything the Democrats want is equaled only by it's converse reaction by the Democrats.
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 Certainly you have no idea, but it is always fun to drop a bomb and scamper off isn't it?
@KamalaHarris Of course that would have stopped almost NONE of the mass shootings we are currently in such an uproar about. I don't disagree with you Kamala but it is a tiny step not a real game changer.
@ciccmaher Right George because Putin did none of that in the Ukraine right?
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 Slow your role Ted, you are the mother of assumptions. There is nothing in that statement to indicate Whitacker is doing anything but reporting. Why don't you guys get Barr in their if your afraid of Whitacker?
Speaking truth to power...Great White North style https://t.co/ZxTbDVMiaS
@KamalaHarris And yet when you had an opportunity to address them as the highest law officer in the state you failed to do so...
@KamalaHarris How can you be from California and tell me Middle Class is 60,000 a year? These benefits must be available to CA, NY, CT middle class families, you have merely established another level of earned income credit for low wage earners.
@DNCCharlotte @whattheheckter @KamalaHarris The poor decisions she made were not forced upon her by the Federal government, read the article, do some research!
@KamalaHarris Uh he paid his bail Kamela. Do you want higher bail for those dastardly white collar criminals or lower bail for those arrested on more substantial crimes? What are  you trying to say here? Better sharpen that messaging before the debates!
@WokeUpMerica @ciccmaher @cicmaher Do you make the Koolaid or just drink it? I'm no anti abortion nutbag but 'Forced Birth' seriously? You are doing nothing but preaching to your own choir, you will find the truth is almost always between the two polar extremes...
@MichaelAvenatti @HowardSchultz As long as we always have similar excuses for Third Party candidates we shall forever be sucking the fumes of the two Machine Parties. As bad as Trump and the Republicans have been the Democrats are only the better choice out of desperation and existential angst.
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump That is simply not true. Most of it is uncorroborated and some of it has been corroborated. Is Donald Trump a menace to our nation? Yes he is but tweeting your own falsehoods to attack his is playing HIS game.
@beyondhighbrow @ciccmaher @venanalysis @datanalisis @jguaido What is it called when someone pulls figures out of their heinie and pretends that they are hard factual numbers? What is the word in Spanish for that? Demonstrations for the opposition fill the streets with hundreds of thousands and Maduro has to bus in for a few hundred...
@WokeUpMerica @ciccmaher @cicmaher I watched the whole video, it was painful, the Black Israelites or Hebrews or whatever they call themselves were...uh...interesting. I looked hard for racism and I saw plenty of it...from the Black Whatevers...not so much from the young yokels from KY. You must be a mind reader..
@WokeUpMerica @ciccmaher @cicmaher Yeah they go to a private Catholic high school, it's not a political protest it is a damn field trip to DC. Use your big brain don;t just parrot the party line. Most of those kids might be racists and entitled punks I don't know but I am equally sure YOU don't know either.
@venanalysis @ciccmaher @datanalisis @jguaido I think we are seeing a bit of red herring here. The National Assembly like our American Congress is unpopular. That does not mean Juan Guadio is unpopular. And by the size of the crowds for Maduro and Guadio it looks like Juan is much more popular than Maduro. Entiendes?
https://t.co/67PD1NlgHk via @HuffPostPol This is what they always say when a Third Party Candidate with money appears... Our Two Party system has worked to make America into a near oligarchy...time for something different! Run Howard Run!
@venanalysis @ciccmaher @datanalisis @jguaido What is Maduro's approval rating?
@ciccmaher They don't get elected to the National Assembly?
@ciccmaher I am going to assume you are a mind reader then @cicmaher because I watched the whole video and didn't see that at all. Poor judgement maybe, which you expect from 16-17 year old boys but racism? Throw away a few MAGA hats and this is not a story
@funder I'm sure that glowing homage to them will make them change their minds @funder ...well played sir!

The emoluments clause has got to be pretty far down any lawyers list even a constitutional lawyer because it has almost never been invoked. The tinfoil hat wearing kompromat crowd-this just makes all of us look insane. Keep the pressure on the real issues not nonsense! https://t.co/PUBEjw1yEi
This is what I keep telling my colleagues, stop bloviating and making up issues, stick to the many real concrete issues that already exist. @tedlieu has this problem too. Let's keep the pressure on what's important AND winnable. Barr is qualified, get him in there and move on https://t.co/24Pfy4lHZf
@MichaelAvenatti Nobody deserves the death penalty @MichaelAvenatti. How can you call yourself a progressive and support such a barbaric prehistoric thing? Lets be MORE like China and Saudi Arabia eh?
Why do we hunt them? Why do we drown them, beat them, torture them? Why are we losing species at 1 to 10000 times the 'background' or natural rate. https://t.co/iLHaHG2bTC . I own two dogs and I love them more than almost every person I know. Animals deserve our respect and love
I almost left out #ProjectADOR....Animals Deserve Our Respect. Be kind to animals. Its a real indicator of a civilized society, how they treat their animals. Pigs, Cows and Chickens are not less lovable than puppies and kittens, some of them are smarter too. Why do we eat them?
Oh yes #ProectWLF is Waste Less Food. Did you know Americans throw away 40% plus of all the food that they purchase? If we could just cut that waste in half we'd knock a giant hole in global warming. Freezers can be your friend, use by dates are just there to sell more food!
#ProjectElm Eat Less Meat. Do you know that the raising of animals for consumption particularly cattle, chicken, and pigs is a bigger climate change problem than internal combustion engines? Eat less meat, waste less food. #ProjectElm #ProjectWLF #ProjectADOR
@ThePlumLineGS You do realize this is a representational republic right Greg? We don't vote on every spending bill or issue. Obama, Bush, Clinton all pushed for items that the general public by polling opposed at the time. The wall is ridiculous but cheap enough-back to work! https://t.co/Ta1MMKunG9
@funder IMO always better to find real issues rather than invent them. There isn't much secret about a gaggle of Congress persons (or is it a murder or a pod?) flying to Brussels and Afghanistan. The real issues are out there-every time we waste time on a non-issue-credibility! https://t.co/Hxczf7ZMNc

That's nice Scott but did you listen to the rebuttal. It was painfully dry, patronizing, and completely unengaging. Those are two very bad speakers. Of course they were honest and Trump was a lying orange devil but still...all those years in politics and Pelosi/Schumer so boring https://t.co/wv9JoDd7mE
It is not his job to represent the nation we elect Senators to represent the states. I do agree it is not his job to be a henchman for the President however so you are partially correct... https://t.co/0J7qpr0Cos

Wow Jon @joncoopertweets  that is as silly as anything the Orange Dumpster has said. He has the money to pay millions, @MELANIATRUMP seems like she will put up with anything...a 'knowledgeable friend' eh? Lol https://t.co/EsJzKgKCgO

I agree our President @realDonaldTrump is a disgrace but he will be out of office in a couple of years, six more at most. Why aren't we paying more attention to more significant issues-like the destruction of our home? #MotherFatherEarth #ProjectElm #SaveOurPlanet
@AOC I honestly don't think trump is a racist, I think he is a fool and a narcissist and will say anything that he thinks will shine a light more brightly on him or please his hard core followers.
@TomSteyer You seem like a great guy and a true Patriot. You are wasting your time our time and your money on this Impeachment craze. Please put that money towards electing progressives or climate change where it may have a real effect. #noshotatimpeachment #defeatTrump2020 https://t.co/icrL2xFG7e
Unfortunately you must capture more than the Democratic voters in order to win the Presidency or were you not paying attention in 2016? https://t.co/WTAxh2owpt

Sorry kiddies the Impeach Movement is a joke, it is NOT going to happen. I don't believe it is even appropriate. @realDonaldTrump is a horror show of a human being but has committed no impeachable offenses. Elections have consequences...live with it and get him out in 2020! https://t.co/nizUHPbdeD
@MichaelAvenatti Hubris will be the demise of the Democratic candidate in 2020. Yes Trump is an abomination but the Dems response with Pelosi and Schumer was appallingly boring and patronizing. Better to have not responded at all. Trump's speech was surprisingly effective albeit dishonest.
@thespookgod I think R Kelly is diseased, I don't think there is any comparison here with what Drake did.

So if a single person had an AGI of 15K or less they would also be eligible for a credit of 35% of their expenses or another 3K or so. Now is that enough? In many cities no in some yes. Why not a minimum wage of 20.00 an hour? How much would a burger cost at McDonalds then? https://t.co/bxwLGClh6A

@simonhedlin @Ocasio2018 I don't get it....what Graham said is completely and totally true. High crimes and misdemeanors is whatever a majority of House Representatives say it is plus a super majority of Senators. Trumpo cannot be impeached while the GOP holds 51 seats.

@Sethrogen Only the Paul Rudd with the incredibly hawt beard in the movie Ideal Home which by the way (thanks Paul) was a highly underrated flick. We laughed, we cried, we loved that beard!
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @THR Why dirtier @TuckerCarlson ? How does that make any sense? You are not wrong that unfettered immigration has many negatives to it but dirtier? That seems at best a poor word choice and at worst a racist dog whistle. Don't be 'that guy'...
@MichaelAvenatti My Gosh Michael your 15 minutes were over a loooong time ago. What's the status of your felony domestic violence charge? Have you paid everyone the money you owe them? You are like an alt @realDonaldTrump...take a vacation or something will ya?
@MichaelAvenatti Sigh....you again Michael? I had hoped the Stormy Daniels imbroglio was the last we would hear from you. I despise Trump and Kavanaugh should step down but you need to shut up and go away please
@LiberalLeftyGal @PeterKauffmann You knuckleheads do know his wife works right? She is the Chevy Chase Town Manager. Talk about sexist, you think maybe she contributed to paying some of the bills?
@TypoToo @GielAvenue @PeterKauffmann @KattyKayBBC Yeah fake news, I thought that was a Trump delusion but here is some right now. Not responding to a phone call or being unreachable does not mean withdrawing your endorsement dummy
@whatscottreads @PeterKauffmann Sure add more non-news to the gossip train. Makes me think maybe it was face changing aliens who did all of this and not Kavanaugh because hey why not it is as relevant as anything else in this thread
@ldcl35 @ReedReedolin74 @PeterKauffmann @NYCNavid A college roommate also could say that because he did not personally get along with him, because he did not drink at all and thought of any amount of drinking as heavy. This is utter trash and I oppose Kavanaugh
@PeterKauffmann This is completely irrelevant. I don't understand why this is news. This is gossip and nothing more. Debbie was honest Brett drank too much....uh...ok
