There are no mechanisms to hold @Facebook accountable for how they do this, or whether they do it well. And even if they do it well now, the company can change that whenever they want.
The fact that campaign finance regulation is becoming a privatized space in the United States is absurd. It is a massive abdication of public authority.
The company seems to have realistic expectations, and to be taking ownership of their own past failings. That said, @Facebook's conduct or stock value is the least important part of the story.

@ezhurb Hi Eve. We strongly condemn Clay Johnson's behavior and the culture that enabled it. Our full response is here: https://t.co/uQiob6aJkq. We hope we can continue earning your admiration.
With that in mind, reflecting on the issues raised by the Huffington Post and subject to further action that may be determined after an appropriate Board-overseen review of Sunlight‚Äôs history, we are committed to at least the following actions: https://t.co/uQiob6aJkq
We are unequivocally committed to preventing harassment and abuse in the workplace. We are committed to a staff culture that prioritizes inclusion and respect, and to having policies and procedures in place that allow us to respond appropriately if those values are not adhered to
The Sunlight Foundation, like all employers, has a responsibility to create environments that protect staff, set an inclusive, respectful, collaborative tone, and prevent and respond to harassment or other misconduct effectively.
To state the necessary and obvious, we regret Clay‚Äôs hiring, and that Sunlight‚Äôs management failed to address appropriately Clay's reported despicable behavior when he was here, and failed to create a culture that precluded inappropriate conduct by others besides Clay.
On May 4, the Huffington Post published an article detailing allegations including a sexual assault by former Sunlight Labs Director Clay Johnson before his tenure at Sunlight, inappropriate behavior by him at Sunlight prior to his termination, and afterwards elsewhere.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is part of a disturbing pattern of weaponized disclosure in this presidency, going back to the campaign itself. As a candidate &amp; @POTUS, Trump has supported transparency for his political opponents or for institutions that threaten him, not an open government for the people.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump The selective declassification of this memorandum ‚Äî but not the one drafted by Democrats on the committee ‚Äì is an indicator of bad faith on open government, not a commitment to fully informing the public about how surveillance is used, abused or authorized in U.S. government.

On the one hand, sunshine laws, investigative journalism and the resilience of advocates and watchdogs around the world have held governments at all levels accountable, despite closing civic space and threats to press freedom. https://t.co/0XNFQJIySu
As @Wired reported, 2017 was a bad year for Internet freedom, from the repeal of net neutrality in the USA to censorship, shutdowns, surveillance, and the poisoning of civic discourse online. https://t.co/0XNFQJIySu 2018 isn‚Äôt going any better, so far.
We continue to see meaningful ways for better laws to enable more open, accountable and ethical governance though civic uses of technology, but it would be disingenuous to see the present through rosy glasses. (We watch @BlackMirror, too.) https://t.co/0XNFQJIySu
