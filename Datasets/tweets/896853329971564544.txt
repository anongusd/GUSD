@jimmy_tho I was a Republican back then and Reagan was my man. I didn't follow politics back then like I do now though. He had a great sense of humor and we had a good relationship with Russia because of him and it wasn't due to him kissing ass like Trump.
@jimmy_tho Yes indeed these are scary times my friend.
@jimmy_tho And Trump confronting Putin doesn't work. Remember when he confronted him about meddling? Confronting him wouldn't happen until we had a new president.
@jimmy_tho This is exactly what Putin wanted. He just needed a reason to pull out and Trump just gave him one. Not holding him to account for anything is the action of a Russian asset. Trump is working for Putin without a doubt. Reagan is rolling over in his grave.

@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @docrocktex26 It'd be even scarier if they knew they were following the anti-christ.
I will not, I repeat,  I will not vote for an old, white, male billionaire for president!!
@realDonaldTrump The only thing different is the story you're telling numbnuts.
@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @docrocktex26 I called the malignant narcissism when I first joined Twitter. I looked up the personality of the anti-christ and there it was.
@realDonaldTrump Intelligence isn't something you shouldn't comment about since you lack any. It's "their" not "there" you fucking retard.
@davidmweissman Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet¬†due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions. Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels, e.g. sea level rise,  ice mass loss, extreme weather hot and cold.

The absolutley best argument I've heard for not giving @realDonaldTrump money for his wall is this. 	5.7 million is a fraction on what he wants for the wall. If Dems were to give in to his demands then the next time he doesn't get what he wants he will do the same thing again.
@EWErickson Hey, @higgins_donna , @NanaTamara21 and @cathyob1 I've noticed others that I follow have done this and have even hit like on some of Trumps tweets but I'm curious why did y'all hit the like button on this tweet? Why not just comment with the poop emoji lol. Just wondering.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson If those boys hadn't been wearing your MAGA hat you wouldn't give 2 fucks. You need to fess up to what happens to people's brains when they put on your MAGA hats. You snacking on em or something? You know brain food isn't literally "brain" "food" right?
@leeleeb50 Funny when people think you're either pro-life or pro-abortion lol. Just because we wish @realDonaldTrump 's mom was pro-abortion doesn't mean it's a thing.

@realDonaldTrump From the same poll:	Trump's support among whites dropped from 50 percent to 40 percent, while his support among African-Americans fell from 19 percent to 11 percent.		Overall, Trump's approval in the most recent poll is 39 percent, down from 42 percent in the previous poll.
@realDonaldTrump Security, Smecurity who needs it right? If you're comfortable without any then by all means... 	Who cares if opening the government would be the right thing to do because you think we're fucking more concerned you can't give your speech. Give it from your toilet for all we care.
@realDonaldTrump I swear you are the biggest fucking idiot I've ever seen in my life. WEATHER IS NOT THE SAME AS MOTHER FUCKING CLIMATE!!!!! Get it through that thick head of yours! You think that shit is funny as long as you're putting $ in yours and your fossil fuel buddy's pockets. It's not!

@Nmenon777 Lol I was 6 so I probably missed my pet mouse George.
So @realDonaldTrump wants to send bricks to Schumer and Pelosi for a campaign contribution of $20.20 each. If he were truly a president that had empathy for anyone hurt by his shutdown he would donate that money to those people. But we all know he's incapable of empathy.

@KinseyAttacks You obviously haven't been to one of his rally's. Not the most mature man speaking at them but hey, it's your time you'll be wasting.
@trisha_dicienzo Anything that your ass was on then gets up and walks is scarier.
@GeorgePapa19 Why is Russia in charge of your campaign too?? This ought to be funny.
@MNRoadPirate @MarkMontoney You mean like depriving people the right to seek asylum or people the right to health care or to even have a president that's not compromised by a foreign government? Is that kinda what you mean?
@afterexposure @UpCorpsman @LilySuJa Lol I know right. Those violent empty chairs scare the crap out of some people I guess.
@RudyGiuliani Hey! You little bugeyed troll just go back under @realDonaldTrump 's bed and hide. Eat a few toads, whatever you gotta do to shut the hell up and stop injecting your losing arguments into our lives. Donnie is a big boy and can stick up for himself ok.
@charliekirk11 BAHAHAHAHA!!!! Well she's not nor will she ever be anything other than ignorant, classless, ugly to the core, self centered and low class. In other words a Trump. Maybe when her hubby and step kids are in exile or jail she could go live with you in Russia.

@realDonaldTrump	@EPAAWheeler	@EPA just gave big oil an early Christmas present. Fuck all of you!		"an estimated 60-90 percent of U.S. waterways could lose federal protections that currently shield them from pollution and development"		https://t.co/DtdrZfx1qb
@realDonaldTrump We're trying to do what's right but you refuse to resign and move to Russia!!!!
@RudyGiuliani By saying you didn't say Payments = not a big crime,	you're saying you meant	Payments = a big crime	You then say you've consistently stated	Payments = not a crime	And ask why they are investigating non-crimes		BECAUSE CRIMES WERE COMMITTED THAT'S WHY YOU BUGEYED TWIT!

@realDonaldTrump His family was 'let off the hook' for what? Soooo, you did nothing wrong but his family did? And trust me when I say you don't need anyone, not a stupid lawyer, not even a serial killer to make you look bad. You and your family do that just fine on your own.
Reports that "The Subway Guy" Jared Fogle was offered a pardon by @realDonaldTrump if he  accepted position of Chief of Staph, saying "Jared would be perfect . He's so thoughtful and asked how my grandchildren were" according to sources. No word yet if Fogle accepted offer.

@ihghost @realDonaldTrump Lol I won't know until I find a translator. Hell i'm just glad someone caught on üòâ
@thomaskaine5 @LeeGronberg I don't want to be the one telling ya. That would involve having been dead or being dead neither of which I feel like doing right now.
@rmayemsinger Heehee did he say it back? That's really cute though.
@maydaymindy9 Trump. Like totally.
"Jake, from Statefarm" is rumored to have declined the position of the new White House Chief of Staph. No word yet from the "Aflac duck" (... because... well... he's... a duck.) A Tweet is expected today with his decision. 		@realDonaldTrump
@Fire2Wire You could unfollow then follow again lol. Just kidding. Thank you.

@oliverbarry @realDonaldTrump Only thing he could do right is by doing nothing at all.
OMH! MSNBC is killing me with the Pence jokes.
I think it's unofficially official the end is near for @realDonaldTrump . I've never seen the news/media outright laughing and making fun of Trump like I have today! Fucking awesome.
@GatodeMiel @HH201707 I didn't realize how many guidelines are truly needed till now. Scary shit.

@oliverbarry Hey thanks
@realDonaldTrump what a little whiny little spoiled fucking brat you are. I double dog dare you to shut down the government! Shut that shit down until 2020 please! We could only heal without your mouth and juvenile influence.
No matter what you say @realDonaldTrump you still sit on the toilet President Obama took a shit on. üí©üöΩ

@yieldcurve23 Appreciate ya. Thanks
@dewaaier112 I lived with the running joke that he said "I don't want a sister I already have 2 of those. I want a record player" when I was born. Jokes on him now, try finding a stylus for a record player these days. Bahahahaha
@_WeAreScotland_ @DougMcIntosh7 Spank you lol
@Dangchick1 Picture Trump sitting in his Lazboy eating something with noodles using his fat belly as a table. A social retard, arrogant, thinks he's always right but with a shrill loud southern accent as he passes out from xanax with a candy bar hanging out of his mouth. That was my ex.
You're are 100% correct @realDonaldTrump we do not want criminals or people with lots of problems in the US. That's why you need to fucking GO!!!!
@CollinsDesta Thank youüòÄ

Sad choice but so deserving. https://t.co/fv1IEcrh1x
Why does @IvankaTrump feel the need to inform us she's a 'wife, daughter, sister, mother'? 	Hell, I'm an exwife, a daughter, sister, mother, aunt, niece,  grandmother. I'm far more qualified than she is.

@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue You'd almost think it was intentional lol
@Kris_Sacrebleu I'd almost take a tapeworm at this point.
When you paint as much shit as @realDonaldTrump you need a smocking gun to cover it up. 		And I'm sorry but autocorrect fixes that typo real quick so you have to really want to spell smocking badly.

@Alyssa_Milano @Nataliew1020 I'm sorry but an animal that's been hit by a car with fatal injuries should be "put out of their misery". No child or any other human being should be "put out of their misery" as this vile woman suggests. Something is wrong with her so maybe she should take her own advice then.
@MarkMontoney Whatever. Show me where have hate even implied.
@TianaTheFirst Nor did he make any attempt to greet the Clinton's as I'm sure if he had they would have been polite and shaken his nasty little hand.
@realDonaldTrump HOLY SHIT! If @realDonaldTrump actually goes to sign anything on this I hope someone checks the terms to the deal otherwise Trump might give China permission to regulate this drug and impose the death penalty in the US!!
@realDonaldTrump But it is a funeral. Celebrating the person's life is something people do at funerals. You just realize this is not going to happen at yours.
@MarkMontoney Nothing hateful about this other than taking a seat from a hateful person. I didn't suggest hiding in a bush, hit them over the head, drag their body away and go in and incite violence rather just occupy their seat. Fewer supporters of his at these would result in less hate.
@h8Wankmaggot45 @tara__incognita Guilty! I sowwy.
@AndreaChalupa 100% agree! That's exactly the reason I think he ran, because of Obama 'roasting' him at that dinner. Prior to that he made only 1 tweet about Obama. In his mind he and Putin have a common foe in Obama so they made a deal. This is personal for both. And about money of course.
@realDonaldTrump OMH! Ok for starters China does not make or regulate our drug laws/policies to criminalize the sale of a drug. Also Fentanyl was already a "controlled substance" schedule I drug. They agreed to include the fact it's controlled by including this on the package. You're an IDIOT!!!
@Esoundofsilence @realDonaldTrump He tried making strides when he started wandering offstage. But they stopped him. Fucking idiots.

@RudyGiuliani Covfefe Rudy, covfefe.
@RudyGiuliani What the fuck are you taking about? That was the best tweet you've ever made!
@NBCNews Oh come on give it a couple of days and he'll be back to his tantrums and insults as if nothing happened. He's probably just realizing he will NEVER get the kind of respect, dead or alive, that President Bush has. Nobody will care.
@Cheryl7298752 @realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Lmao yes ma'am he sure is!
@elizabethforma @ReneeFiredup @realDonaldTrump According to Wheeler the report is flawed in part because the results are from the prior admin. True science doesn't change due to who's in office it changes when the data tells it to. This is total bullshit and puts us all at risk.
@Cheryl7298752 @realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron I agree he is delusional! I swear the longer he's president the dumber the man gets. With the garbage he spews that his followers believe he's brought the average IQ for the entire nation down 50 points! Fucking moron.
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Are you fucking mentally retarded or something?! You've got to be, it's the only thing that would explain your ignorance on climate change and everything else. You've made it easier for corps to pollute without repercussion &amp; taxpayers pay to clean up their messes. You're loathed

@gaywonk @ThePeterPaige I have immigrants living next door should I be worried? Hell no. Actually I'm more worried that they'd move out and an @realDonaldTrump supporting Republican would move in. With millions of immigrants already living here I've yet to hear of any diseases they've brought.
I wish @realDonaldTrump would lie in state. Oh... wait... he does. He's lied in every state he's been to.

@Esoundofsilence I bet that was a culture shock! I've been to upstate, Rochester, Lake Conesus area. Fucking gorgeous.
@Esoundofsilence It's really not funny lol. Ok maybe a little.
@Mary_Lee__ @realDonaldTrump In link you sent towards the end. If i'm not mistaken that's what they said. Could be wrong though
@Esoundofsilence Yeah it's a pretty state top to bottom. Alcohol is state owned and ran. Did they still have the mini bottles in bars when you lived here?
@Esoundofsilence Yeah it's nice up there for sure. I went snowballing last time I went skiing.
@Esoundofsilence Oh wow. Cool. I mean I guess it's cool, if you like Utah that is lol
@Mary_Lee__ @realDonaldTrump Even worse is they act like we'll pay for it after they build it. Fuck that. They want it they can fucking pay.
@Esoundofsilence Did you live here?
@realDonaldTrump If you really want to pay your respects stay home. I'll admit I am curious as to what you'll say or do to embarrass yourself.

@realDonaldTrump Whew!  So glad you clarified it's a "personal relationship". What other kind of relationship would you have with him? A sexual one? He's not Putin.
@realDonaldTrump You're the manchild who wants more nukes and a fucking space force idiot. Stop blaming and deflecting especially past admins it's fucking old already. I've seen 2 year olds with more accountability than you.
@dewaaier112 @lisastark351 Lol you ain't so bad yourself grasshopper.
@lisastark351 But sometimes "fuck" or "shit" is the exact word one needs. You really can't substitute in those cases. I'M I FUCKING RIGHT???!!!! üòÜüòÅüòâ

I just realized I can think of something positive about NK but absolutely nothing positive about @realDonaldTrump 		NK is way ahead of most countries on climate change. The country uses very little fossil fuel and the entire country has about 2000 vehicles. 		That's positive huh?
@realDonaldTrump Does China know this??
@PolitiSearch @RWPUSA Being gay and being a pedophile aren't the same. One is attracted to the same sex and the other attracted to children. Yes, they tend to molest one over the other but it could be either or both. I'd trust a gay person around children any day.

@Scotty061289 @realDonaldTrump I'd have said the same thing regarding any country that's an ally in which he used his campaign slogan to insult them. He wasn't sticking up for the people of France he was insulting it implying he could do a much better job running it.

@Djokaire I'll see your Macron and raise you a Donald Trump Jr.

@Tirebiter42 I love Schoolhouse Rock. 		Psst I watch them on YouTube on occasion myself lol
@wizkid2000 @realDonaldTrump Well Ralphie guess what country Trump's ancestry is from? Germany. The jerk needs to stop attacking our allies. Especially with things from the past and act like today's leaders are responsible. I'm sure people of France are far more educated regarding their history than Trump is
@realDonaldTrump Just to make this clear I want trying to say France isn't great. It was directed towards Trump not France. We love France. ‚ù§
@realDonaldTrump Things have been bad since your inauguration and you haven't said a fucking word about it so.... we don't believe a word you say.

@realDonaldTrump France was great again the second you left. America was great till you got back. Heavy sigh.

@JamieCableGuy That's intentional. The districts are intentionally red. Say there's 60% dems in an area if the surrounding 40% each take some of that 60% into their district then red will get the vote in the entire area. It's like sharks ripping apart a whale.
@JamieCableGuy That's gerrymandering and why it shouldn't be allowed. They map the districts in their favor and eventually every single one will favor them if they aren't stopped.
Mueller a republican,  must be protected. Rod Rosenstein a Republican, must be given credit for acting nonpartisan in his position as Deputy AG. The newly appointed acting AG's views are well known and can't be allowed to stop the investigation.		@realDonaldTrump
So what the fuck went wrong? Gerrymandering at its finest. 		"40% of all voters in party registration states are Democrats, 29% are Republicans, and 28% are independents. Nationally, the Democratic advantage in the party registration states approaches 12 million."

My stomach is in knots! Our democracy is on the line, our lives are on the line. Those of you voting for Republicans today are unamerican and I believe you don't fully understand the repercussions of what you're doing. 		Fuck you @realDonaldTrump , you're a sicko!

@dx7066801 @aeronautic1 @nmlinguaphile @G8trz4ever @SAPAriba No one is arguing the fact climate changes what you fail to realize, like all science deniers is we are accelerating the rate at which it's changing.  Arguing that the sun is the main cause but we're kinda to blame then still doing nothing to mitigate our part is lame.
@dx7066801 @aeronautic1 @nmlinguaphile @G8trz4ever @SAPAriba I haven't forgotten shit. The guy that wants to go fast on his Harley and doesn't take the planet into consideration is the one that needs to be educated on alternative solutions.

@RudyGiuliani @RonDeSantisFL Florida doesn't have state taxes in part due to the lottery so that's not going to change. And if they ever voted for taxes it would be very minimal. Republicans wants offshore drilling. Florida and others states don't!
@dx7066801 @aeronautic1 @nmlinguaphile @G8trz4ever @SAPAriba So what! Let's kill the planet and everything on it including us so people can go fast?  That's so stupid.

@leeleeb50 Also why don't they consider having gun manufacturers fire their weapons before they ship them and registering the guns ballistics. Those results could then follow the gun whenever sold and if stolen could help if used to kill. Won't solve the problem but it might help somehow.

@dewaaier112 Lol the guy isn't even running. I think Trump endorsed 3 people that weren't running. He's so stupid.
@Porter4Us @SherryBorgstrom @nubianiles2 @justinamash But couldn't the president make the changes after declaring, as example a national emergency and directive 51 to pretty much do as he wants? In this case who would declare this emergency over? It could go on indefinitely.
@Porter4Us @SherryBorgstrom @nubianiles2 @justinamash What we are allowed to read aren't worded that well so can you imagine how terrifying the annexes which are kept secret may be. Plus considering the man in office it all could be terrifying to consider. Some of his actions give me pause, thinking he's headed that direction.

@Nmenon777 @darcgr @aeronautic1 @Stop_Trump20 Lol I hope you're right to keep that optimism. The only thing is is that I changed very early on, like after the second time I heard him speaking on tv.

@AstiJesse And no I've never seen anybody do anything remotely close to anything like this for any president. Sorry I didn't answer that earlier.
@darcgr @Nmenon777 @aeronautic1 @Stop_Trump20 I'm not sure any will ever come around. I've only managed to even make one of them be nice,  even laugh. Kanye tweeted saying he loved everyone &amp; I said he didn't love Taylor a Trump supporter replied Trump  was better than Taylor anyday I said I dunno I hadn't heard him sing.
@trudyscousin That's probably true. They think they're fighting for a great cause. It's actually quite scary.
@darcgr @Nmenon777 @aeronautic1 @Stop_Trump20 No that's fine. Just don't give them that kind of credit if knowing right from wrong. Look who they follow after all.
@FluffyAnnabelle @aeronautic1 @Stop_Trump20 That's true too but I've got a theory about the hate thing. Have you seen the WH  Correspondence dinner when Obama was president that Trump attended and Obama made jokes about him? You could see how fucking pissed he was! He was livid! He's hated him ever since.

Directive 51		In short, the President, in executing¬†Directive 51¬†can take over and control the government, the military and the private sector ‚Äì meaning land, buildings, businesses, roads, and utilities including electricity, communications, and the internet.
@JPaqui37 @TuckerCarlson You meant the civil war admit it. Your ass got "owned". üòÇü§£ü§£üòÇ
@JPaqui37 @TuckerCarlson You ask which side was racist during the civil war and then tell me to read a book?! üòÇü§£üòÖüòÜ
@theRealDawson83 What he says and does affects the entire planet so voice on...
@JPaqui37 @TuckerCarlson I'm kinda thinking the ones that owned black people would be the racists. Thought that would have been obvious but apparently not. Wow.		Oh and @realDonaldTrump is a fucking racist. And Tucker.
@814ae5c13d92456 @XFactor10 @stucam7771 Really? I'd have never guessed that.
@Centaur1207 @TuckerCarlson Nobody in my family has ever "owned" anybody. And it was an example to Tucker of the only other time our country was as divided as they are now. He kinda acted like he was shocked. But he's always confused so who knows what the dumb fuck thinks.

@aeronautic1 @nmlinguaphile @G8trz4ever @SAPAriba I take the fucking bus. You ever take public transportation? Well it sucks but I do it anyway. Bunch of freaks on them buses.
Directive 51	This Directive gives him¬†enormous power. So much that he could, at any time, institute directives granting full and complete control of nearly every branch of government, private business, travel and, more ominously, the deployment of US troops on American soil.

@RichardASalas3 @ida_skibenes You'd be better off just filling them up with tap water. Cheaper too. Plastics are evil.

@VCater5 He's not hiding it if you know all that. Stop enabling him. My sister was gone years before she actually died. She hadn't been "my sister" for years. Why would he quit when he has no consequences for his actions? Take in a homeless Vet and get rid of the user.
@MSMbecile @funder @d1s0bey You're a fucking genius ain't ya? Crawl back under your maga hat.

@NRCC I took your fucking survey! https://t.co/TTOpgnx82R
@TuckerCarlson Had to correct me typos lol		Well there was the little incident a while ago, I think they called it the "Civil War." It may have been mentioned in your history class. One side was racist and enslaved black people and the other side didn't. So there's that...
@realDonaldTrump What do you think they're fucking doing by coming here. A mother fucking caravan isn't going to try to sneak into the country. What are they going to do, rush the border with their babies in their arms? They are coming here to apply for citizenship. Legally!
@TuckerCarlson Well the was the little incident awesome ago, I think they called it the "Civil War." It may have been mentioned in your history class. One side was racist and enslaved black people and the other side didn't. So there's that...
@814ae5c13d92456 @XFactor10 @stucam7771 That's kinda weird. I bet they don't even know what it is.
@Zoeysmom7 @stucam7771 How did I miss those lol. I thought about the maga hat but the NRA I forgot. Good job!
@happylife09111 @XFactor10 @stucam7771 The thing is racist people are afraid. They fear what they don't know or who they don't know. I lived in Louisiana and there's a lot of rednecks with flags. Hopefully your neighbor doesn't give you shit and if she does she needs to run if you remove your earrings and shoes!
@2ndSeisoon @stucam7771 You think that young? Sad to think someone that young had that much anger but Trump is president so...

RT @RonWyden: I am demanding answers from the White House about @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs use of Air Force One for political purposes. American ta‚Ä¶
@treasonstickers I wonder who he'll blame after the first immigrant baby is killed. Will he say they were radical terrorist babies? The man wants to start a war so bad that he'll use our military to stop a legal process that America was founded on. He ain't right in the head people!
@dgburk @RudyGiuliani Nothing patriotic about a fucking moron who can't make a bomb that goes off. Y'all can't even do that right for hell's sake yet you make excuses and blame others. Patriotic my ass.
@XFactor10 @stucam7771 I thought about the flag in his back window assuming he was from the south but didn't live in the south. That wouldn't go over so well father north but guess they think he's in Florida so...
@stucam7771 I'm gonna guess originally from the south, menial job, divorced, 45-60 years old, owns his own home (trailer), attends Trump rally's like they're Grateful Dead concerts, drives a pick-em-up truck with a gun rack, he'll claim he was Democrat till Trump, his mom just moved in.
@realDonaldTrump I believe their story except for the 1 tiny part where they say you have friends. That lie is going just a little too far. 	üòÑüôÑ
@realDonaldTrump Dude you're the president and pretty much everything you say is on video. That's kinda hard to dispute. FYI America is angry and it's your fault and yours alone! Own that shit.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I do believe there are more pressing issues you should be focused on. Like I dunno... bombs maybe. 		Instead of dismantling the EPA  you should ask for a study on the toxicity of that orange shit you slather on yourself daily. I think it damaged your brain.
@funder @GoGreen08 And Robert Dinero...
@realDonaldTrump So you only use the one seldom used government phone to tweet day and night too? It's people in your office getting this story out because you're too stupid to listen and you just deny any wrongdoing. Ever.
@realDonaldTrump If that were true you'd stop all your hate mongering, your race targeting, your anti-everything-that-isn't-rich-white-men rhetoric and start acting like a person with some compassion, reasoning, common sense and empathy like a president should!!
My guess is the serial bomber has attended multiple @realDonaldTrump rally's.

@realDonaldTrump is the most insecure person I've ever witnessed. His desire and need to be liked is causing our country dearly. Satan could literally charm Trump into giving him our souls for a mere compliment then tell his base how nice that Satan guy is. They'd believe him too
@dewaaier112 @The_UnSilent_ Running from the law. Lol I'm kidding. Dad was Air Force so that was some of it. Then my husband's job was some. Leaving him was some lol. I dunno just a gypsy I guess. Never been to the Northwest part, Washington State, Oregon... yet that is.
@The_UnSilent_ And who thinks they can say and do what he's done then show your face in public? I mean really.
@lindeeloo_who That spread fast I only told 1 Trump supporter I enjoyed the new ecig "e-lite" and next thing ya know we're all e-litists.
@JohnJHarwood @sherndds If someone shit all over your bathroom and you paid someone to clean it only to walk in there to find even more shit than before wouldn't you say something to the person you paid to clean it? It's kinda like that.

@jones7955 @realDonaldTrump Ha that's the only thing he doesn't have to fake or pretend he can do and the only thing he's actually good at.
@dewaaier112 @The_UnSilent_ Lol ok are ya ready?? Born in South Dakota lived in Missouri,  North Dakota, Louisiana, Florida, upstate New York, South Carolina, California for a few months and finally I'm back in Utah. Many of those states I've lived in more than once. Never lived in North Carolina though.
@realDonaldTrump Unless you're Russian.

@jones7955 @realDonaldTrump @jones7955 are you familiar with Directive 51? I'm not into conspiracies but if were to claim the country were in a state of emergency he would control all branches of the government and could even call off the 2020 election. Research it a little it's fucking scary.
@DogginTrump I heard if you use a chokehold you could get away with it.
@realDonaldTrump doesn't give a damn about your children's/ grandchildren's lives. What's next dismantling the EPA all together?		The director of EPA's Office of Children's Health Protection, Dr. Ruth Etzel was abruptly put on administrative leave. 		https://t.co/3JWXtOppVz

@leeleeb50 Russia is pretty much a state as far as @realDonaldTrump is concerned so I'm going with Russia on this one.
@realDonaldTrump Ummmm last time I checked you're the asshole threatening to call in our military to the border.  A real president would be more worried about Russia trying to fuck with our elections. You've got some shady dealings going on and you need to be stopped!
I GOT MY BALLOT IN THE MAIL!!!!!!!!!!! Today I'll do my part taking back our country from @realDonaldTrump and Russia.
@The_UnSilent_ That braided pony tail is what's scary.
@Lazer11111 Then you know what fucking block me. This isn't a game ok. Don't engage somebody, push their buttons then get butt hurt and block and report. This is our country we're actively fighting to save. You want to be complacent then just sit and watch stupid! Have a nice day.

@Lazer11111 Just trying to make you comfortable since you follow a man who loves name calling. You're sending mixed messages.
@OMGno2trump He lied??? No fucking way!
@Lazer11111 Maybe your neighbor snuck in while you were sleeping and gave you a lobotomy. Yeah, that's it. It's the only thing that makes sense. Fool.
Which would you prefer in your water lately?
@realDonaldTrump I'm so sick of your vulgar lies. Who the fuck would want open borders you idiot? That's just stupid. What we do want is your mouth to be as closed as your mind.
@peterdaou Yes, then he can use Directive 51 which scares the hell out of me!
@Lazer11111 Check this out I GUARANDAMNTEE  you more have switched from Republican to Democrat. Me included. We're judged by the company we keep and you're in bad company. At this late stage forgiveness is not an option. It's just too bad we all have to deal with your choice.

@Megalee84 Move to another state.

@dewaaier112 @The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump But I am worried. I've no doubt we have the numbers to ensure no 2nd term I just hope they're in the right places to get the electoral and I hope he isn't allowed to let Russia fuck up our entire process then deny it while making it where we can't do anything about it.
@dewaaier112 @The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump If he's not then this is bigger than us all.
@barbara_ocamb Ain't that the truth lmfao. I hope she gets a shit ton of calls.
@_SJPeace_ @barbara_ocamb If you want to let this stupid bitch know how you feel just give her a call at 346-484-8620. I believe I got it correct if not just watch the video.
@dewaaier112 @The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump He lives in a fantasy. He would never, ever admit to the perception of anything less than perfect. Yet he doesn't realize how flawed he is in every way.  And let anyone wondering how he became president know that without help from Russia he wouldn't be.
@dewaaier112 @The_UnSilent_ Made about as much sense as @realDonaldTrump ever does. I hope that shit isn't spreading!!!!
@dewaaier112 @The_UnSilent_ I have a natural instinct to take a shit but that don't mean I'm a scientist. 		Lol that doesn't even make sense does it??
@essenviews Jesus! It's bad enough he lives in the same country as us now this!?

@Lazer11111 That's such bullshit. You've been on twitter since '09 and you've never said anything then or since to support anybody other than Trump. You've always been a Republican so stop lying. Lying must be a prerequisite for supporting Trump.

@realDonaldTrump still thinks the moon is made of cheese. Why do you think he wants us to go back?
@Makeitstop99 Everyone seems to forget his promise to donate $1 million of his own money to help Houston after the hurricane too. I'm sure they're still waiting.
@bigbluethetruth @realDonaldTrump Maybe because helping others is the right thing to do for starters. Helping boost their economy would help with illegal immigration and if you can't see that then you're not very bright. This "me, me, me" agenda is self serving &amp; solves nothing long term.
@FakeTrumpTroll @realDonaldTrump It's too late.
@realDonaldTrump Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to wait until you die before donating your brain to science?
@Mikel_Jollett 100% agree
@mattmfm I haven't thought anybody would make me proud to be an American again if they were president... until now.
@The_UnSilent_ @FrankBruni Lmao that look on the face of the guy on the left... priceless
@realDonaldTrump What planet do you fucking live on? You made the deal now fucking own it and pay her charity.
@bigbluethetruth @realDonaldTrump A healthy economy isn't welfare. You don't see Canadians crossing the border for a better life do you? Like Trump you need to look beyond yourself and think of others especially if you think Trump really gives a fuck about you or anyone else.
@realDonaldTrump Did you ever think countries like this may need more help instead of less help. If we help others to be more self reliant and successful then fewer of their citizens would leave. Helping others achieve a better life also helps us. If you weren't so selfish you'd see that.
@JamieCableGuy Thank you Jamie.
@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @Stop_Trump20 @realDonaldTrump Exactly. He cares only for himself.
@davidwrojas @realDonaldTrump Lol only a baby talks like that.
This month is the 10 year anniversary of my brothers cold case murder. A reporter contacted us from the FB page I made for him and wants to do a follow up story. I'll be talking to him Thursday. Thank you Jacob Scholl for bringing my brother's murder to new light. RIP Jeffrey.
@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @Stop_Trump20 @realDonaldTrump Maybe financially better. At least for a little while, until climate change is pushed past the point of no return.

@idfg what a disgrace that your commissioner killed a family of baboons and even worse killed a giraffe then happily posed for pictures with their dead bodies!! This man should immediately resign and if he refuses then he must be fired. What he's done is not ok!
@realDonaldTrump You need to grow the fuck up. Who are you to call anybody phony? Her DNA test showed she has Native American ancestry so why are you still lying about it and not donating that million $ that you promised? Fucking asshole.
@ScottFrazier19 That's because he and Kushner used the same tax preparer I'm guessing.

@StephenAtHome WE NEED AN EMERGENCY "THE LATE SHOW" AFTER TODAY! Just go to the studio, throw something together, air it and we'll feel better. Thank you.
@hayes_liston @realAliTweets You've been hanging upside down from your tail for too long monkeyman. You make no sense. Potus is a sex predator so that makes flotus an enabler and you a supporter of both. Frankly I didn't care for any candidates in 2016 but either would have been so much better. Idiot.
@realAliTweets I agree. I'm old but I know this country needs young, energetic leaders. Leaders of all color. Leaders that represent what our nation is suppose to be. Forward thinkers who haven't been in power their whole lives and consumed and tarnished by their own egos. I'm sick of this shit
@RudyGiuliani When it's your stupid, racist, divisive mongering client who started all this shit. Therefore it won't, it can't stop until the world is rid of this louse of a man. He started it, we'll finish it.
@realDonaldTrump You silly moron. See, Democrats are thoughtful people they make multiple signs &amp; give them to others to use. It's called "sharing", look it up. Democrats protest you for nothing more than the love of America &amp; the joy of patriotism. And their loathing contempt for you. Not money.
@realDonaldTrump retweeted this thinking it was the real Kurt Russell.  		What a fucking idiot that man is. https://t.co/fnn1xfRJ4d
@realDonaldTrump was far too accommodating and calm during this whole Kavanaugh thing. Him saying he didn't mind the investigation and the FBI could investigate anyone was so underplayed and out of character for him. He had this in the bag and wasn't worried. I'm on to him.
@blowupguide @realDonaldTrump So I reacted to something a week ago that was finished a couple days ago. Makes sense. To nobody.
@MrsRabbitResist I'll bring pumpkins. We can carve them, shoot them, drop them from a very tall WALL, catapult them, set them on fire, run them over, drown them, let them rot in the sun, shit in them, even skull fuck them (I don't judge), I'm sure people have their own ideas.
@leeleeb50 Are you shitting me??? What won't they fucking lie about? 		Pun was intentional lol
@steve3031 It really is that serious. That's messed up but hopefully November 2020 will make the difference. Thank you
@Gutshot1234 @TuckerCarlson Dr. Ford's testimony is evidence. Other than that just shut the fuck up!

@JeepWebcrawler2 @GOP Then you shouldn't have issue with them.
@JeepWebcrawler2 @GOP If there were such a thing as being pro-abortion you'd be the reason why.
@JeepWebcrawler2 @GOP Well it's not really digging. All one has to do is go to one of his rally's or to the doors of the white house and its just sitting there.
@realDonaldTrump Are you fucking kidding me? BAHAHAHA you are really a dumbass aren't you?
@RealJamesWoodss @DebbyAJ The fucking Russians helped him dummy.

@realDonaldTrump From the man who convicted innocent men before a trial. And common sense left the minute you became president. You're nothing more than a lying con sowing hatred and divide. You make me sick!

Why the hell doesn't the FBI do background checks on presidential candidates?!  We wouldn't be in this fucking position if they did and it kinda is an important job. Almost like the most powerful job in the damn world until 2016. It outta be a fucking law. 	@realDonaldTrump
Awwww how sweet! https://t.co/TiLY36xqG4
So if the FBI background check of Kavanaugh shows evidence he had reason to lie when he testified it will still be considered part of @realDonaldTrump 's deep state, far left conspiracy bullshit because it's the FBI and he hates them. Either way it's bad.

Did I fucking call this or did I call this????
@DonaldJTrumpJr BAHAHAHA what would you know about honor????
Kavanaugh throwing Judge under the bus by revealing his addiction is nothing more than an attempt to make any testimony he may give as being unreliable.
@ANSTELLOK @realDonaldTrump Haha https://t.co/u6EZCMuu4V
Haha Kavanaugh said he was grateful to @realDonaldTrump for nominating him. Who would be grateful for being exposed as a piece of shit??

@roc345_mark @DonaldJTrumpJr That's where he repents so yeah...
@MCollinsVAGirl @realDonaldTrump Lol I thought so.
@LindseyGrahamSC "I don't know who but somebody paid for her polygraph." 15 minutes earlier Dr. Ford's attorney testified that they paid for her polygraph and it's standard practice. That's some Penn and Teller shit having your head up Trump's ass from that far away on live tv.
Brett Kavanaugh is a shaneless, disgusting horndog!
@tosika75 @realDonaldTrump Or ass lol
@DonaldJTrumpJr They weren't women they were children. But you be sure you remember this tweet after your "ass" gets raped in prison.
@GayleYoungs @realDonaldTrump It's tempting but I've resisted naming one Trump. I don't want to just smash his head in that would be cruel.
I have little mice in the basement I've been catching humanely and letting them go outside.  I'm afraid with @realDonaldTrump around I'd eat all the rat poison.
@dewaaier112 @realDonaldTrump I'm gonna hold might breath till he goes away. No that won't work. Fuck!
@BoneyardDem @realDonaldTrump Oh well now it makes perfect sense lol
@danoow11 @realDonaldTrump And hearing. The idiot just won't shut the fuck up! Make it stop!
@SteveZapata3 LMAO! You roof scaling pervert! Haha
@realDonaldTrump poor people, the ones who deserve a break can't fucking afford to have money in the bank let alone enough to live off the fucking interest! You brain dead corpse of a being. Dumbest president EVER!
Did @realDonaldTrump just say China said he had a large brain??? Are ya fucking kidding me!
@chrislhayes Trump tweets without thinking all the time. Same thing when he talks. How has he not stabbed himself in the face with his fork when eating?
@realDonaldTrump You'd have to pay me to come see you. Oh... wait... you do. Sorry, I have plans.
@SteveZapata3 Oh hell I'm fine, thank you. Hadn't even thought about it in at least a decade. But yeah kids can be fucking MEAN! Hard to believe anyone questions why kids don't come forward when shit happens.
@maydaymindy9 Along with Heidi Cruz.
ing so I called my best friend and talked to her. The next day at school everybody knew and I WAS CALLED NAMES! Not him. Me. I told 1 person and she told no one. Who knows what he really told people. I didn't tell the cops. Girls keep quiet. It's easier sometimes. What a creep!
Kids are cruel, even high school aged. 10th grade some guy climbed onto our roof over to the other side of the house to get to my window. All I heard was some guy whispering my name "Lori, hey Lori." I didn't know who the fuck it was and I was scared as hell! Everyone was sleep-
@PeteHegseth @realDonaldTrump Wha...? Huh....? Did you use "beautiful articulation" to describe something Trump said? BAHAHAHAHA üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£üòÉüòÖüòÇü§£ü§£üòÜ	You just got my vote for joke of the day! Bahahaha

@DogginTrump @GOP Me! Me! Me! My entire adult life until Trump! And I've still yet to hear 1 person say they were a Democrat and switched to Republican since Trump. Never again and I don't know what the fuck I was thinking!
If you're a man and you've ever assaulted a woman, sexually or otherwise you should be pretty damn worried about now because women aren't going to take it anymore! #MeToo

I wonder if anyone has taken the time to see how Brett Kavanaugh ruled and sentenced on sexual abuse/assault cases. What type of evidence and witnesses were allowed? Was he noticeably lenient on his sentencing? Was there obvious prejudice towards the victims? Just a thought.
@vietcoat @realDonaldTrump He really did. Always does. This is like some sick joke.
@vietcoat @GeraldoRivera @marthamaccallum @realDonaldTrump Lol that's debatable, remember the Al Capone thing??? üòÇ
@dewaaier112 @realDonaldTrump Sweet dreams!
@realDonaldTrump Did you factor in people stockpiling for the impending #Trumpocalypse America fears you're causing? Didn't think so.
@realDonaldTrump You are the biggest fool on the planet. You do nothing but alienate every single country that up until now have been our allies. They laughed at you and you only got an applause at the end because they were glad you were finished talking. We're screwed thanks to you!!
You can't tell me Kavanaugh isn't lying when he claims he had no moments that he could not recall when he was drunk during high school or at any other time in his life. If every other allegation were proven false at the very least he's a liar. Liars don't need to be on the SCOTUS
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump How can you support a president that won an election with the help of a hostile foreign nation, has sexually assaulted over a dozen women, lies compulsively,  is a racist bigot,  is as dumb as a rock sows hatred and division and has that fucking ugly ass hair!?? Disgraceful!
Frank Schaeffer: an evangelical with some sense! He says "evangelicals have gone so far to the right that it is literally like a Trump cult now, the likes of which you'd see in North Korea." Amen!
@leeleeb50 They do that to me too. They must thing people don't bother reading profiles but I sure do.
Hey, @seanhannity you need to stop thinking you're running this country because you're fucking not.

@AhfriedFried I can't wait for his reign to be over!
@joelcra61682877 It is and it's sickening.
@msmarymck MCM?
@AhfriedFried They don't give a fuck. Trump is acting like a pharaoh who bans the name of and chisels away the face of the previous pharaoh Obama. That's all he wants to do. He doesn't care if it's harmful as long as any sign of Obama is gone. He's filled with jealous rage.

@brsburt @realDonaldTrump all he's done wrong. Plenty of time to inform you of what he's done right though. Nothing, absolutely nothing.
@brsburt @realDonaldTrump I don't have to say a word ok. Trump proves his inability to lead, encourage or unite. The man isn't qualified to lemonade stand. Besides all I need to do is sit back and wait for one of you to "prove" your point with a link or something. There isn't enough time to clue you into
Never mind. Lol that didn't last long at all. Whew.

@juliaspaulding2 @alfranken I don't think they can be compared.
@brsburt @realDonaldTrump Like you can talk. Let me guess... Fox and Breitbart??? Gateway Pundit maybe? None are news sources. Bye.
@brsburt @realDonaldTrump But that's what his supporters like, name calling. If you're suddenly insulted by name calling then you should be old enough to figure out what he has or has not accomplished. I'm done raising kids. Have a good one. Bye.
@RudyGiuliani Man, you must have really sucked as an attorney!! You really think Mueller would agree to Manafort cooperating if he had nothing to offer? I can't wait till you represent @realDonaldTrump  in court. Y'all were made for each other.

@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Nothing you say could ever be story of the year because you fuck up and lie so often. We don't have time to begin to process one lie when we're hit with another. I don't even want to think what a monumental lie you'd have to tell to get our attention for a full year!
@realDonaldTrump Oh my hell stop lying! Nobody wants fucking open borders! That's just a stupid, stupid thing to say. Some of the crap you spew just defies all logic... ok most of what you spew does and this one is no exception.

@swnsasy Lol Damn I wish I could take credit but it's a quote from the article. They definitely pinned him didn't they? Dead on I think.
@dewaaier112 Lol IKR!? Couldn't have said it any better.
"‚Äîthe pettiest, smallest, emptiest, most dishonest, most malignant shit-for-brains you could ever imagine, just an absolute worthless interpretively man-shaped lint clump from the absolute bottom of the human genetic drain‚Äîis the president" üòÅüòÇü§£ü§£üòÇüòÖ		https://t.co/Gmj8WGTQ6i
@thehill So the worst that would happen is what? More people evacuating and more lives saved? What a horrible conspiracy. 		Climate change is happening and we're responsible you fucking idiot.
@realDonaldTrump No sane person would claim to be completely ready for a major natural disaster. But then again no one thinks you're sane so...
@atrupar What a crock of shit!! Sparing no expense at $10 million is siphoned from FEMA towards camps to imprison immigrants! This idiot needs to be stopped before what he's doing cannot be undone.
@alfranken We miss you so much. Please run in 2020! You would without a doubt be our next president if you chose to run. I would LOVE to see you debate Trump if nothing else.
I remember like it was yesterday. I was living with my ex and he called and told me to turn on the tv. I was in utter shock and denial at what I saw. May God bless and keep those who lost their lives and those who risked their lives to help others.
@realDonaldTrump: 	The worlds only living heart donor.
@realDonaldTrump I kinda think the citizens of NYC and the first responders are heroes and need a little recognition too. You on the other hand would have ran down the street with shit running down your leg and hid, oblivious to anyone needing help then you would have went golfing.
@joelcra61682877 Stupid typos. I meant "there" not "the"
@dewaaier112 @realDonaldTrump And you're too sweet to me.
@joelcra61682877 Now we just need people to register then got out the and vote!
@GlennHovenga @trueamerica1st @realDonaldTrump Yep, I'll insult him every and any time I feel like it.
@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue Among other things, yes.
@GlennHovenga @trueamerica1st I didn't claim to but you support @realDonaldTrump so you'd probably believe anything the idiot says. He's no more god fearing then a pile of garbage is(which he is).
@IndivisibleNet I believe he's in better shape than any president. 		Unless that president is still alive. Hell, I bet some deceased presidents are in better shape.
@realDonaldTrump If the way you handled Puerto Rico is any indication people would be wise to leave the area with plans to never return.
@DrGroove74 Ain't that the truth!
@TheRealD_R_Neo Is that even legal ya think?

@DrGroove74 Thank you. I've been one since the SOB started campaigning.
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @SecNielsen @fema @FEMA_Brock @VP This storm may not be severe enough to hit the white house but the one predicted for November in 2020 shows 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. as ground zero. I advise seeking higher ground in Russia ASAP!
@humorandanimals Can someone find a crocodile that does this and give it to @realDonaldTrump and family as a gift?????
@realDonaldTrump Most be some kind of new machine created by a Russian that runs on semen, lies, disgust, and the blood of Americans that was designed, manufactured and assembled in Russia.
@trueamerica1st God loves people who go golfing instead of attending  church on Sundays.
@davidaxelrod @juliaspaulding2 @realDonaldTrump 12+2=14. 14 months until the election that votes a Democrat as president. 		How's that for math you dillweed?!
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump We'll see who bullies who if Trump gets thrown out of office. He's going to blame you and all those who supported him when it's all said and done, he's said as much. Shame on you!

@realDonaldTrump claims to have fallen asleep during Obama's speech last night. I can see that happening. Obama speaks and it's soothing and comforting, even lulling so I can see falling into a restful sleep. When Trump speaks you're too terrified to sleep and have nightmares!!!!

@realDonaldTrump You call yourself a "president"? You claim to be "stable genius". You say you have the "best words". You accuse the media of being "fake news" if they don't agree with you. "Grabbing them by their pussy" is "locker room talk". "AND" "YOU" "USE" "QUOTATION MARKS" "TOO" "MUCH" "!"
@EPAAWheeler @POTUS Shut up. You're a big part of the problem. You're all toxic.
@johno187m @Robluv44 @higgins_donna @roc345_mark @carasm10 @SteveBucci1 @Antwonton @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Oh so now your snopes tweet was an intentional joke or something? Yeah. Ok. Whatever. You fucked up just admit it.

@realDonaldTrump Ask yourself this @realDonaldTrump, are the claims in the op-ed true? Then fucking hell yes they exist. You know they do otherwise why say they need to be "turned over?" Idiot.
I tweeted prematurely. I read excited thinking #TheResistance had a mole in the White House then I found the article. They're #NotMyMole simply because they believe deregulation is a good thing. Fuck them.

The next time a @realDonaldTrump supporter wants to argue with you about him just say the one sure thing they can't spin a positive comment about. Tell them simply "I don't like his hair." I'd like to see one of them defend that shit!

about their president. Their president will become transparent like other presidents"		This is a quote from @realDonaldTrump about Obama. I thought it as do many of the things he's said apply to his sorry ass. It's fucking crazy!
President "is the least-transparent president in the history of this country. There‚Äôs never been anything like it. We know very little about our president‚Ä¶.If he releases these records it will end the question[s], and indeed the anger, of many Americans. They‚Äôll know something
Ok so this new Woodward book out claims Gen. Mattis said @realDonaldTrump is mentally a 5th or 6th grader and that nobody knows who is really in charge. This kind of explains the GOP support because I bet they are all pushing their own policy on him thinking they're in charge.

@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @docrocktex26 Anything but be honest.
@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @docrocktex26 It's bullshit! I also don't understand why people are more upset over Roe v Wade if (when ü§¨) he is confirmed when the bigger issue is his belief that a president shouldn't be charged with a crime while in office. That's why Trump picked him not because of his view on abortion.
@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @docrocktex26 It isn't a hearing it's a fucking joke.
@johno187m @roc345_mark @carasm10 @Robluv44 @SteveBucci1 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Nope. They sure can't spin out of this.

It's not a conspiracy just because the asshole got caught. They can't support the truth so they make shit up.
I also tweeted an apology to Obama. I apologized for my indifference and not really paying attention to him as president. I wasn't on twitter then so I didn't tweet negative things but I wasn't supportive. This apology is a complete reversal and heartfelt message. https://t.co/0fyP3qoIT4
@johno187m @roc345_mark @carasm10 @Robluv44 @SteveBucci1 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Ummm maybe because going after landlords is their fucking job. And considering people who own property (rental property in particular) in NYC have money it's standard practice not a power play. Can't go after poor rental property owners because they don't exist.
@johno187m @carasm10 @higgins_donna @roc345_mark @Robluv44 @Antwonton @SteveBucci1 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Yeah it's kinda funny how in the second pic the stands with the sheet music are HUGE compared to Clinton's head.

@TopRopeTravis "Turquoise Stanard" has retired from stripping. It's in everyone's best interest.
@realDonaldTrump You have got to be the dumbest person to ever hold an office. Dumber than that dog that was mayor of a town.  The term "anonymous sources" has been used by the media for a long time and is used to protect identities. Nothing more nothing less you imbecilic sack of shit.
@realDonaldTrump Actually they're real books with covers and pages and words. #FakePresident
@realDonaldTrump You are deranged paranoid. Just because someone's spouse works somewhere doesn't mean shit.
@ForeverLogical @realDonaldTrump Every rally he holds is campaigning where speaks nothing of substance. Each one is the exact same rhetoric and garbage he spewed while campaigning, never anything new or relevant. They are nothing more than a stage with willing attendants who'll listen to him brag about himself.
@CanadianProud83 @mlndlrman What @realDonaldTrump does not only affects the US but it affects the entire world so you have every right. Thank you.
@TexasGOP Oh who really gives a shit if he's had a DUI! He could have 2 DUI's, shoplifting, and public urination charges and he'd still be a far better person than @realDonaldTrump, his entire family and the GOP!
@realDonaldTrump You don't know shit about shit! Including how a search engine works. My hell how have you survived this long being so fucking stupid!?
Even when a president is no longer in office our taxes pay for security for them and their family forthe rest of their lives. I sure as hell don't want a single penny of mine going to protect any Trump! We can avoid this if they were all locked up or exiled!	@realDonaldTrump

@EPAAWheeler @Timothy_Cama The name sounds intentional since we're all 'huffing' the poison you're putting back in our air!

@realDonaldTrump You need to contact your sponsor and attend the closest Pussy Grabbers Anonymous meeting as soon as possible. I fear a relapse.
@realDonaldTrump You don't need fake news to make you look bad and evil you do that all by yourself! It's the only think you're truly good at.
@Esoundofsilence @realDonaldTrump Any that may have remained was swallowed by Trump himself.
@Esoundofsilence @realDonaldTrump Even worse we all have to deal with their decisions. Trump can't even look past his damn ego and say something nice about McCain in his passing and his supporters think no less of his character. What a joke.

I had more figured out in my teens then you will your entire life so good luck pussy grabber supporter.		Oh, did I say that in public??? 		Good. Cause I meant to. Later .
@realDonaldTrump Are you pouting? Cause it sure sounds like you're pouting. If you want a fucking parade have us that honor and respect our military march for them instead of our military marching for you. That's all it woulda be a big ego stroke for you. Money could be used elsewhere lunatic.
@johno187m @roc345_mark @carasm10 @Robluv44 @SteveBucci1 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Huge difference!!! One of them should be held to the highest standards because odd their position and set an example instead of acting like the amoral fucking piece of shit that he is. Trump has said worse in public so shut the fuck up already.
@anonycraig @realAliTweets Ewwwwww lol
miss you so much. You're forever in my heart. 		Jeffrey Allen B. 	August 18, 1962 -	October 24, 2008
having time off their sentence. Jeff was a great man, husband, father, grandfather, son and the best big brother a sister could ever have! He is missed every minute of every day. T. Garcia you'll get your judgement day but today I wish Jeff a happy birthday. RIP I love you and https://t.co/PKruH0F3Ae
Today would my brother Jeff would have turned 56. He was shot and killed in 2008 by T. Garcia who is still walking free bc the police refuse to give a downward departure to the 2 willing to testify against him. They think having a murderer walk free is better than those 2 guys
@johno187m @roc345_mark @carasm10 @Robluv44 @SteveBucci1 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Oh so when it's orange asshole saying it you defend him but when it's Rus who says the thing Trump said that all of you are defending then it's an ignorant comment. I agree with Rus, anyone who sticks up for him should all get their pussy grabbed by him. And that includes you!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness As long as shit keeps coming up then he'll keep investigating. Guess he'll be done when he's fucking done. So shut up and let him finish. Holy shit!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness Omarosa has tapes to back up her claims. You got tapes to back up these accusations?		Didn't think so.
@realDonaldTrump You are psychotic! Suddenly you're an advocate for free speech!? FAKE NEWS! TRUMP IS FAKE NEWS!!!
@realDonaldTrump You talked of pulling their broadcasting license idiot!
@realDonaldTrump Every direction we look you still embarrass us and make a fool of yourself. God help us all. Except you. And Putin.
@johno187m @roc345_mark @carasm10 @Robluv44 @SteveBucci1 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump On let's take that comment out of the discussion, since it was private and all. There are sooooooo many more that he's said in public that still prove the kind of lowlife scum that he is. Defend him all you want. You're know by the company you keep. And yes you are messed up!!
@realAliTweets May I change my entry please? I've thought about it and decided his has to resemble a vagina more than a penis since he's such a pussy. My final entry I swear. https://t.co/L11HZ7L1Vl
@anonycraig @realAliTweets Soooooooo, Trumps has 2 meatus? 		üòÇü§£ü§£üòÇ Yes, that's what the opening on the end of a penis is called, a meatus. Can you fucking believe that??? üòÇüòÅ Oh my hell that cracks me up!!! ü§£üòÇüòÅüòÇ		Is there even a plural for meatus? Meatuses? Meati? üòÇü§£üòÜ
It seems @realDonaldTrump AND @FoxNews are running the US not our government/elected officials. Fox has Trumps ear &amp; more clout, power in decisions, policy, laws. They're more influential then Intelligence Agencies, Military Officials or truth to Trump.		https://t.co/VEczDjyoO1
@realDonaldTrump 	Manafort being charged and brought to trial is not a 'very sad day for "OUR" country.' This isn't your country you just live here, Russia is your country. This is OUR country and we think Manafort going to prison will be a WONDERFUL DAY!
@dewaaier112 @realAliTweets ü§ó
@realDonaldTrump 	Revoking the security clearance of someone based on their spouses position is unjust and without merit. You are unhinged, deranged and need to be put in check!
@dewaaier112 @realAliTweets That's why I love ya
@therealdrix78 Nope.
@realDonaldTrump That's not what he said you fake news spreading asshole! Just because he was referring to you and you actually caught on to it. And they aren't brothers you fucking dillweed!
@dewaaier112 @realAliTweets Lol but you're my buddy. I'd wish you were the only judge but that would be cruel having you look at all those pics. ü§Æ

@realDonaldTrump When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give him a job at the White House, I guess it just didn‚Äôt work out. Good work by the Blue Wave and Mueller for quickly firing that dog!		#TheResistance	#Resist 	#BlueWave
@parscale @LaraLeaTrump Campaign money raised for a proposed future election being used for current positions is looking out for his small $ donors? You're a horrible campaign manager and pretty fucking stupid. Hopefully his supporters will see through all this bullshit soon. The rest of us do.
@GOP Lol that was prior to her being fired, now she's a woman scorned. You better look out.
@realDonaldTrump You're out of control!
@leeleeb50 Awww thank you.
@dewaaier112 @leeleeb50 I don't think it's possible so don't worry lol.

@johno187m @roc345_mark @carasm10 @Robluv44 @SteveBucci1 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Wow, really? That's a defense? It was suppose to be a private comment? Damn, you're messed up.

@BravenakBlog Trust me not ALL white people. Most of us have all the proof we need in his past and current actions, his past and current verbiage and past and current behavior to know he's used the word and used it more than once and he's probably used it already today!
@Robluv44 @johno187m @roc345_mark @SteveBucci1 @carasm10 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump What a horrible way to be raised. To ignore the suffering or injustices of others if it doesn't directly affect you. Sounds like a caring, empathetic household you were raised in. Just look the other way so long as you're not getting beaten, raped, mugged, robbed, etc.
@realDonaldTrump @GrahamLedger Oh shut your damn pie hole. Lying sack of crap.

@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @tedcruz Trump threw the US under the bus. Cruz is just desperate and probably heading for divorce since he can't/won't defend his wife.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Y'all are a buttload of paranoid freaks.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers I was a Republican since I first voted, I loved Reagan, I liked Bush 1 better than Bush 2 but still liked them both, I did not like Clinton and didn't really pay attention to Obama. I was excited Trump was running then I listened to his bullshit &amp; lies &amp; hate so give it a rest.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers You're just a conspiracy theorist but I'll let you in on a secret.... there is no deep state.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Who gives a fuck if he had to sell his house to pay his legal fees. Don't lie to the feds and keep your house. If it's proven the 302 was altered then they need to be charged. Thus far it's not proven. Then there's still the little he pled guilty thing.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Lmao you truly are one fucked up individual.
@ScottFrazier19 Lol
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers No they said he didn't show signs nor acted like it. They didn't say talking to him proved he didn't lie or knowingly lie. Who pleads guilty if the FBI proved you did nothing. He says he lied. And he failed to mention it to Trump.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Look if anyone in government has committed a crime it should be investigated and if evidence is found they should be charged it doesn't matter which party. But dismissing anything Trump may have done because someone else may have committed a crime is ridiculous.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers This was the first I'd heard of this 302 form so I googled it. I guarantee that's more than most would do. But as soon as certain media like Pundit report on it then looking any farther is pointless. If a crime is discovered investigating another crime they have to investigate.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers I read a few articles on this I simply quit when I saw the Pundit covered it. I didn't recognize any other media agencies other than Fox and Pundit covering this claim. If someone asks me to look something up generally I do so, unless it's something I absolutely know is false.
@DogginTrump You're already following me but saying"FUCK TRUMP" just makes me feel better. ü§ó
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers See, I did google this claim and all creditable was lost as soon as there was an article from the Gateway Pundit.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Kinda stupid to plea guilty if you're not. A 302 is not even mandatory and could be written a day, a week, a month later. All this was is their opinion based on interviewing him. He may just be a very good liar and not show it. He failed to mention this interview to Trump. Why?
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Lol wow that's a new one. I swear y'all are insane.
@realDonaldTrump I don't believe that for a second but that really wasn't my point my point is he's telling his base that we want a free for all at our borders and that's just not true. So no matter what he's saying about us wanting open borders I'm telling you it's just not true. It's not true.
@realDonaldTrump No we don't and no matter how many times you say anybody wants anything less than secure borders won't make it true. While you claim tu want secure borders you are doing everything in your power to close our borders. Closed is what you want, secure is what we want. Got it?!
@realDonaldTrump 	Looks like your üåü is being removed from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's being replaced with a üéÉ and relocated to the new presidential Walk of Shame located somewhere in Death Valley.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Lol you say MSM like it's suppose to be an insult. Mainstream: "the ideas, attitudes, or activities that are regarded as normal or conventional; the dominant trend in opinion." As opposed to the fringe, conspiratorial media views y'all support.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers And don't accuse me of having some fake ass syndrome made up by Trump. My hell now y'all use him as a source for medical inquiries. You're a bunch of sick fucks.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Flynn has already pled guilty and had agreed to cooperate. Don't know if he'll do fine or not but that's not the same as walking. The only way he and many other would walk is I'd they got a pardon. Unlike you I watch most news sources including Fox whereas you watch 1 source.
@liamgalehems Only in my dreams lol
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Yes, Comey was fired... after he refused to pledge loyalty to Trump and to look the other way in regards to Flynn. And he only learned of this from watching TV. Flynn lied, Jr. lied, Sessions lied, Pruitt lied, the list goes on and on. Not to mention Trump lies every fucking day!
Liam Hemsworth everytime I paint him nude.
@commonsensistJW @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Well thats a pile of misleading, lying garbage. Every single one of you supporters are fools.
@kpu6600 @treasonstickers By saying who knows I was implying merely who knows the exact reasons and the details. Lol I think we all know simply what they want us to know until the investigation is completed.
@SoulStealer25 @IngramEpps @Acosta Lol no that's just her face. 		P.S.	Love "hangry" üòÅ
@kpu6600 @PatDumont2 @treasonstickers I'm willing to give this investigation more time if it helps ensure there's enough to sink his ass for good.
@kpu6600 @PatDumont2 @treasonstickers Fuck Trump!
@FakCancer @EPA Lmao there ya go. That's the spirit.
@CumbeeJames @NASCARBlueStar @c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject You fucking act like you discovered copper. Give it a rest. I acknowledged you earlier blah blah blah. Have a good un.
@c1bigCS Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yaaaawn blah
@NASCARBlueStar @CumbeeJames @c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject Shut the hell up. Y'all just don't stop. Like a virus or a rash. Y'all have gotten on my last nerve and I needed it for my nervous breakdown.
@swnsasy I know nothing about this story. I'm only here to support my girlfriend lol
@CumbeeJames @c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject Pull them from your ass for all I care. Need a shovel? It's just a little "pit mining".
@Loveon999 @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Yep. The guilty accuse.
Next time I tweet something pertaining to @EPA , climate change, endangered species, etc. and you feel like chiming in how it's all fake, yadda, yadda... DON'T! I'm sick of y'all. Fuck off, fuck you, fuck Trump, fuck each other for all I care. Patience is depleted arguing. Fuck U
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaCorps @PebbleProject Pray id it proceeds that it's far more successful than the levees in New Orleans after Katrina. 		Fucking idiot.
@CumbeeJames @c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject Really? Gee thanks mister.
@ApleyTardy Lol
@LoriMichaelFl @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity Shit! I'd pay for front row seats.
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaCorps @PebbleProject Lol ok. Just curious as to how many actual scientists will conduct any research. Seems that it'd be pointless for the EPA to do any since they're running low on actual scientists. Anyway, have a great day. Or what few the may be. Tootles
So, if supporters of @realDonaldTrump rely solely on him and Fox for all their "news" so they just turn off their tv when Shepard Smith comes on? He's the only person with any damn sense in the entire company.
@ApleyTardy	Apparently at least David is a PBS trustee.	https://t.co/z1HsmgOC0I
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject You locals? Who the hell are you talking about? I'm sure you care that anything gets spilled anywhere just as I'm sure your reason for wanting fishing outlawed is noble. I will agree to a degree on (over)fishing but for completely different reasons I'm sure.
@ApleyTardy @TPerrysburg @BillKristol The Koch Brothers have been at this for awhile. I can't even watch PBS anymore because they fund every damn environmental, climate, social program on there. The bastards.
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaCorps @PebbleProject 1 of those links to an article that was put out prior to the report you say it debunked. Waiting on a new report based on a policy from an agency that is basically dismantling, deregulating honestly is ludacris to say the least. You refuse to look at all info.

Manafort was broke huh? Look, when I say I'm broke it means I'M BROKE. Like digging in couch cushions broke, picking up that penny instead of ignoring it broke. If you've ever had $60M+ your ass ain't broke! Sell those ugly coats and mow your own lawn jerk.
@c1bigCS	Here is your report completed in 2014. Unless you only want to believe the future one with Trump deregulations. As far as the real science it's been done. I'm sure you won't even glance at it but I tried. 		https://t.co/SZ6jMTzclz
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject Gimme a break. Like you care who leaks what. 		Oh and I don't live in Alaska so don't know which locals you're referring to. It's all about $$$$ for you guys. Can't take it with you and don't care what happens after you're gone.
@snapdaily05 @PatDumont2 @ClydeCadiddleh1 @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Sumbody lyin' lol
@PatDumont2 @kpu6600 @treasonstickers That's basically what I think. Stay tuned I guess huh?
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject And I simply said this was bullshit and threatened to poltergeist your ass when I died. I mean really, ghosts scare you but earth dying doesn't? Makes sense. By the time y'all realize what we're doing it'll be too late if it's not already.
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject Yes, it did. You guys harp and harp the same old and it pisses me off. It pisses me off because the facts are in your face yet you refuse to see. I've had this conversation too many times. My gawd what is it going to take? The science is there, look.
@morningmika @emilyjanefox Maybe she was referring to weekends when daddy is golfing and they're separated. I bet that's it.
@SoSofieFatale I agree. When is she coming back?
@Donr360 @PikachuSerena @cheryltaylor204 Is that pic real??
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject Oh bullshit! This is all total bullshit. I plan on haunting people like you who continue to rape and kill this planet leaving nothing but a warm ball of crap for my granddaughters after I die.
Sarah Sanders doesn't have to worry about going home and being able to sleep at night because her soul dies every night only to be brought back by satan in the morning.
@thehill BAHAHAHA üòÇü§£üòÉüòÇüòâüòÜ STOP IT!!! BAHAHAHA boy I needed that. Whew.
@andicocoa @realDonaldTrump OMG!!! That's just fucking disgusting!
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaCorps @PebbleProject There's already been studies prior to this admins EPA and it very clearly states this would be devastating. The only reason it's brought up now is because of Trump and Pruitt and now Wheeler.
@c1bigCS @EPA @AlaskaMiners @PebbleProject Until they can't.
@TheCannonBriggs @kpu6600 @treasonstickers Eeewwwww yeah, real fishy. Palease! Alex Jones is calling he wants his viewer back.

@c1bigCS @EPA  https://t.co/5N9foLeaje
@c1bigCS @EPA That's all the more reason to keep it the way it is! You're choosing to ignore the science that's there. I'm choosing not to ignore it for the sake of my 2 granddaughters. Financially you've got something to gain here and that's obviously blinding you. https://t.co/YUiuzQve2F
@ItsMeDeb_Again Food.
@ScottFrazier19 LMAO
@c1bigCS @EPA Yeah we're proving that daily. That's a really lame argument. Still wondering what real science you want to wait on.
@ProblemChild_60 I don't know what to say about that. I've never been accused of being too nice lol
@StegallNan He's far surpassed getting even. Someone stop him.
@c1bigCS @EPA And it's not a fishery it's something salmon have been doing and a place they've been going since before man.
@c1bigCS @EPA Real science on what? The toxins and risks from mining? Not even debatable. The EPA is effectively dismantling as we kill our planet. You think this would be a local problem? Go live next door to a gold mine then we'll talk real science. Or not cause you'd be all sick and shit.
@ProblemChild_60 Evil Keebler Elf.
@kpu6600 @treasonstickers Oh yes. It was them. I just think they were given the okay from Trump. Not only the okay but they helped each other. Lol just a theory.
@kpu6600 @treasonstickers Never has, never will. It was mild to normal people but he's not normal. He was seething! That and the fact there were zero tweets from him regarding Obama until a few days later seems like he took it very personal. Shit, it's anybody's guess at this point huh.
@BillKristol I think there's been a donor boycott for a while I mean when was the last time one of them was given a brain or a heart?		What?		Oh, not THAT kind of donor boycott?		I still stand by my tweet. 		üòÅüòÅ 	no üß† only a üñ§
@dewaaier112 @bwoll1219 @ORnative56 @realDonaldTrump Wha....??? Lol
@kpu6600 @treasonstickers ... and hasn't stopped. Maybe that's what Putin has on him the fact they were in it together and Trump got $$$$ from Russia. It's like a mystery novel and i'm just guessing. Hopefully we'll all know soon.
@kpu6600 @treasonstickers I'm thinking they're one and the same, the hackers and the RNC. Like Trump allowed them to because both have a mutual hate for Obama and Russia helped and funded Trump's run. Watch the correspondence dinner w/ Obama pissing Trump off. Days later he tweeted his first Obama tweet..
@neeneenat @GregShugar @noteabaggers @realDonaldTrump No. Of course not.
@swnsasy Either way say you're not. I heard Trump sacrificed virgins.
@swnsasy And I'm thinking you may not be a virgin. üòõ I could be mistaken lol
@bwoll1219 @ORnative56 @realDonaldTrump Besides it would have been a sad story if you'd done the other and you both still laughed. Then you got arrested for indecent exposure lol
@swnsasy Lol 	HEAR THAT EVERYONE!!! I'M TAKEN! BACK OFF!
@bwoll1219 @ORnative56 @realDonaldTrump I'm just glad you said "pulled out your... ...ID" instead of something else. That other tends to get one arrested.

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You know 1 reason might be because 'the rest of us' have choices. Meaning, we have more than one station in which to get news where your supporters have but one! As much as you'd like for there to be only one it'll never happen. As soon as they realize this the better. Try math.

@dewaaier112 Lol me too. Sweet dreams.
@dewaaier112 Fuck I hope you're right! Couldn't come soon enough.
@dewaaier112 And thank you. He was a great guy. Dude that killed him is still running free too.
@dewaaier112 Sure I'd rather guns have never been invented, I'd still have my brother. Guns banned will never happen here ever. I'm all for tougher gun laws and a ban on assault type weapons absolutely and not everyone should be entitled to a gun.
@SpeakerRyan  Is the foreskin with you? Or were you born without a dick as well as no balls? 	üòÇü§£
@dewaaier112 The NRA probably are pro 3D gun rights. The NRA doesn't manufacture guns though you'd think they did. I'd have to google where they stand on this too.
@dewaaier112 I really don't know. I'd have to google it. I don't think a small handgun is more than a  few hundred bucks purchased legally. My brother was murdered in '08 by a guy with a gun and yet I'm not agaisnt the 2nd amendment. So this crap that dems want guns taken away is bs.
@dewaaier112 This is very true and I'm sure people with 10-20k in their pocket will be opening up print shops. Then he'll give anyone who owns a 3D printer some sort of huge tax credit.
@realDonaldTrump Are ya fucking kidding me? You look forward to seeing him soon? We're you born with your scrotum stretched around your neck choking off all blood supply?!
@dewaaier112 Lol actually it was meant as a joke aimed at the intellect of his supporters, being so stupid to think they could print a gun like you can pictures from a roll of film. Lol Walgreens doesn't have 3D printers which is what they'd need.
@realDonaldTrump Wow! Look at the size of tomorrow's crowd!
@HillaryWarnedUs I'd vote for him in a heartbeat!
Do you think if 3D gun blueprints are made available online that Trump supporters will form a line outside Walgreens to have their guns printed???
@LisbethJensenDK @realDonaldTrump I realize it must be very confusing with everything that's going on here, hell we're confused lol. But it hasn't gotten that bad... yet. We still need, want and appreciate any support we get. Thank you friend.

@KGDBrent @NYinLA2121 Lol i know. Don't give him the satisfaction.
@KGDBrent @NYinLA2121 No, not really.
@LisbethJensenDK @realDonaldTrump Lol absolutely not. We've never had to show ID to purchase food. I was just making fun of him saying we did.
@NYinLA2121 That there's some classy people!
@dewaaier112 @realDonaldTrump Haha I bet ya do ü§™

Ran to the store to get coffee creamer but was denied because I didn't bring my ID. Damn it! 		@realDonaldTrump you're a fucking moron!
@Molly3186 In defense of 3% of those brown cow chocolate milk believers... they are children and not yet old enough to vote.
@QuancyClayborne It's "Happy Holidays" they don't want people saying. Like saying that means to take religion out of Christmas. Its the holiday season but we're not to say Happy Holidays. It'll be law that we'll have to say "Happy Thanksgiving, Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year" or get arrested

@realDonaldTrump You have selective memory. I recall having to hide under our desk on base during the Cuban missile crisis. My father was a missile tech so if we'd gone to war it would have been one of his Minuteman missiles launched. Things are worse now because we're alone thanks to you.
Putin offered to help in the investigation!! This is a fucking joke. Our country is the leading stock of the world. No one is going to take us seriously until this clown is out of office. What the hell is wrong with you Republicans? Why are you silent? @realDonaldTrump
@misty5665 @sexygirl798 @RepCohen @TuckerCarlson Yeah he's a grumpy old man for sure in that sense. I was just messing with ya with the young body thing. If that's a boy's body.......... lol
@StramboEngr @realDonaldTrump Neither would I. Plus I've heard they do some weird shit for rich people over there.
@misty5665 @sexygirl798 @RepCohen @TuckerCarlson Mmmmmm I think more like a middle aged body. Lol
@Nac167Nacii I'm pretty sure he doesn't but I haven't followed her at night. I have no clue who she hangs out with. I'm very suspicious.

Sir, @RepCohen pay no attention to @TuckerCarlson . We've know for some time he was dropped on his head early in life. He's disgraceful.
@TuckerCarlson 	You're such a little twit. Steve Cohen DID NOT call for a coup! You are seriously fucked up in the head!
F-ing typos!
My brothers cat is named Sasha? You don't think she's Russian so you? I'm afraid to ask her.

What does Putin have on @realDonaldTrump 	Did Trump go to Russia, murder somebody then have sex with the corpse and Putin has it all in tape or something?
@DavidWohl Dude, if Hillary (she did win the popular vote) had won @realDonaldTrump would be pissed the people he made a deal with did such a bad job. So there's that.

@Bree000007 @stardustshamroc @bardgal @moneymouse74 @greydog1853 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump What I am staying is fact my dear no bs. You saying it's a republic only defeats your own agenda. I think it's funny.
@Bree000007 @stardustshamroc @bardgal @moneymouse74 @greydog1853 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Well if a troll stands up for their country rather then just the leader of that country then I'm a troll #AmericanTrollProud
Looking at @realDonaldTrump past tweets I have learned this:	He did not tweet much if anything political UNTIL AFTER the correspondents dinner in which he felt Obama insulted him.

@Bree000007 @stardustshamroc @bardgal @moneymouse74 @greydog1853 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Look it up dillweed. A republic is the people, if the people chose he lost the popular vote so he wouldn't be president. A democracy the government we elect decide, as in the electoral vote. We're are both. You're saying we're a republic only, if true, he'd not be president. Duh
@realDonaldTrump #TraitorTrump
@stardustshamroc @Bree000007 @bardgal @moneymouse74 @greydog1853 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump No I'll agree with you on that because a republic is the one that lets the people choose and a democracy lets the government choose. So the people (republic) chose Clinton but the electoral (demcrat) chose Trump. If we were a republic only she would be president.
@Je_suis_elite Lol we'll talk tomorrow.
@Bree000007 @stardustshamroc @bardgal @moneymouse74 @greydog1853 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Sure did read it. And saw Rosenstein's press. But you act like toy have inside info to the investigation and you don't do don't make claims you can't back up.
@stardustshamroc @Bree000007 @bardgal @moneymouse74 @greydog1853 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump We are both (in theory). We elect the officials that then represent us. So this is not even worth arguing about because you're both correct. Now what?
@zugly747 @Karen61466707 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump I was part of the right side until right after Trump was helped into office by Russia, them he kept opening his mouth and I couldn't stand it and switched. I've been to that side and it fucking sucks!! You suck. Trump really sucks.
@zugly747 @moneymouse74 @LTrctrc @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Look commie being into computers and trying to sway a national election is wrong so stop fucking defending the act. You're a bad person following a bad man. And I'm being kind. I can't believe any American could justify this so fuck off traitor!
Break from reality for a sec. 	When it's all said and done and the Mueller probe is over, if all guilty parties are arrested and if @realDonaldTrump is not among them the facts remain that Russia interfered in our elections and Trump SHOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT! It's that simple.
It's like America wore a blouse that showed a little cleavage and Russia raped us and "we were asking for it." 		Russia raped America!	@realDonaldTrump
@zugly747 @LTrctrc @moneymouse74 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Lol shit that has a few typos....
@zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump I'm not saying it's right. You are. You're arguing their cause. Commie
@zugly747 @LTrctrc @moneymouse74 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Oh so bad on their security or lack there of its on with you. Cause that's what your saying like they had it coming and servers em right. Justifying or trying to justify this act is wrong on so many levels.
@zugly747 @moneymouse74 @bardgal @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Have a shitty day.
@zugly747 @moneymouse74 @LTrctrc @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump I guess you have an open network on your pc since you don't seem to give a damn about your rights and privacy.  While you're at it what's your social security number and bank account info? You can just post it here.

@Bree000007 @stardustshamroc @bardgal @moneymouse74 @greydog1853 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Why would you put "Americans" like that? Are you privy to the investigation? Do you know something we don't? Didn't think so so just sssshhhh.

@Je_suis_elite I think you told me that yesterday.

@bardgal @moneymouse74 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump It's their MO.
@Karen61466707 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump I just don't understand this blind faith and loyalty to him and what he's doing. I don't fucking get it.
@stardustshamroc @moneymouse74 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump No shit huh?!
@moneymouse74 @zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump He said "these indictments" there could and probably will be more. It ain't over till Trump cries. My gawd, you people are blind as fuck!
@realDonaldTrump You thought she'd win too. That's why you needed a little help. My hell you lie so much!!
@zugly747 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Are you serious?? You think Russia breaking into servers belonging to candidates running for president of the US is just a typical day gathering intelligence and you find this okay! You need a mental health specialist. Try reading the charges in the indictment. *GASP*
@tweetmommybop "My Heart Will Go On" add he lovingly gazes into Putin's eyes. I'll save "The Bitch Is Back" for when he returns to the country that hates him.
@IndivisibleNet That was totally uncalled for and out of line. What the fuck is wrong with people. What the fuck is happening to this country??!
@realDonaldTrump doesn't have to ask Putin I'd be meddled in our elections because he knows he did. People and the media need to stop asking him to ask Putin and start realizing this. He WILL NOT ask him because he was party to it. That's what i think anyway.
@Myminimine @ResistTrump24_7 @marynoise @realDonaldTrump Amen to that!
@tribelaw @ORnative56 I agree. This was all set up.

People who love their country defend their country. People that love their country don't insult the agencies within their country. People that love their country want to foster peace and prosperity not division and hate. You,  @realDonaldTrump DO NOT love America.
@Wdhamann @realDonaldTrump His plot is to deny it all. Deny and they will follow. Sickening.
@RealFabiG @realDonaldTrump I'm trying to be chill but it's not easy. And we really appreciate yours and everyone from other countries supporting us.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He won't confront Putin about anything. Oooh, he'll say he did and he'll say Putin said he didn't do it and how are we going to know any different when there won't be anyone else in the room. I bet the 2 of them will have a good laugh at how they pulled this one off.

@realDonaldTrump How can an opinion be fake news? There should never be a president that's allowed to meet an adversary alone. There's something you don't want Americans to know and if that turns out to be true I hope you realize it won't stay hidden forever. Resign, you suck.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah that tends to happen when you've got Russians helping. You lost the popular vote remember?
@Wdhamann @realDonaldTrump More than stupid it's dangerous. I didn't think this was allowed to happen. Trump will brag that all this progress was made and agreements agreed upon and what a good guy Putin is, when in reality they're plotting something really, really bad.
@GreedyMcDuck @realDonaldTrump Lol I know the sons-a-bitches stole mine. I have no way to get around except for public transportation. Better hide yours.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Collusion isn't a federal crime so all you're doing is saying something that isn't a federal crime didn't happen. You know what is a federal crime though?

All you @realDonaldTrump supporters need to stop using immigrants and illegal immigrants interchangeably. They are not the same thing. Stop saying we want unsafe borders bc we want secure borders just not closed borders. Stop saying we're pro-abortion bc there isn't such a thing.
@fjtcpd @realDonaldTrump The argument isn't illegal immigrants it's immigrants. We want secure borders with immigrants allowed not illegal immigrants and not closed borders to all immigrants. Stop listening to what Trump says and maybe listen to what we're saying because he lies.

@dewaaier112 Imagine living here. When Strzog got riled up and spoke about the FBI and their integrity and honour I've got to tell ya I haven't felt that much pride about being an American in almost 2 years!
This is bullshit! Gowdy tells Strzok to finish answering any Republicans questions when their time is up but will not allow him to answer any Democrats questions when their time is up. This is totally partisan and biased and fucked up!

@4everNeverTrump @AP They had a deal before he was even elected, we just didn't know about it.
Yesterday I signed up to volunteer at the DNC in my city. Anything they need in doing to do. ANYTHING to see that Trump doesn't get a second term. I hope I get to help register others to vote.
@realDonaldTrump The fake accounts are likely Russian bots that serve you. Pretty sure the NYT account is real. Do you even know what "fake" means?? I sure doesn't seem like you do. And we didn't ask for opinion.
@realDonaldTrump It was dismissed because it wasn't proven communications took place in DC which is where it was filed. It was not dismissed based on the merits of the case but on grounds of jurisdiction. It was not "won" by anyone.
@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump That's because you're kicking them all out you dumbass!

@dewaaier112 Thank you very much! You're a sweetheart.

Mr. Pruitt will you have someone in your office find me a $200,000 a year job. I'm just gonna sit on my ass until they find me one. Maybe I'll go shopping, get a mani, pedi, facial, bleach my teeth maybe even get a boob job while I wait. 	Thanks. @EPAScottPruitt 	@EPA 	Asshole.
When it's "federal land" such as this and other national treasures it means it's for all of us not just a mother fucking oil company. This is going to happen again and again until there are no land, no national parks, no monuments, no forests, no lakes. Just fracking. https://t.co/zlXtifm82e

@realDonaldTrump No, no, no you don't get to decide who "the face of the Democratic party" is by tweeting it to your base, we do. We'll decide so shut up.
@realDonaldTrump If we EVER go to war with NK it will be because of you. But you'd blame that on someone else wouldn't ya?

@AmoneyResists @gphumber Pro-abortion makes it sound  mandatory as opposed to pro-choice obviously being a choice.
@thehill I would not have been so kind. I would have sat right next to him and told him things he probably wouldn't want to hear. As a matter of fact I'm sure I would have been arrested after spitting in his smug little face. I loathe @EPAScottPruitt 	@EPA  probably more than I do Trump.
Did my invite to the Civil War get lost in the mail? I'm always left out of the really fun things.		Alex Jones is such a stupid moron.
@Capt17Bjk BARF!!!! Lol
@EdKrassen @Cwedding1 Trump &amp; friends are just anti-abortion because they know they wouldn't be here if there mothers had had a choice.
@Bornabrit1 @Capt17Bjk I'd take a pig with lipstick at this point.
@sirDukeDevin And it's Golfday...  I mean it's Sunday.
@iluvrhi @realDonaldTrump Thank you. They need to know we appreciate them.

Trump; "Did you meddle in our elections?"		Putin; "No"		Trump; "Fake News! Putin told me he did not meddle and I believe him. Just a witch hunt hoax America! MAGA"
@dewaaier112 Is it that obvious??? Lol
@HarryDisaOG @StramboEngr @realDonaldTrump And the apology as I stated was for you being an asshole. But since you won't apologize I will, I'm sorry you're an asshole who doesn't know what he's talking about.
@HarryDisaOG @StramboEngr @realDonaldTrump I was married to him and it's what he did for a living and recently returned to doing it.  So you "informing" me it's bull shit is bull shit. Courses make different agreements depending if they keep the balls or not. If they keep them then yes they pay you. He doesn't dive 4 free
@thedeadlydonald Grrrrr @Heritage Foundation can kiss my ass. Stupid fossil fuel funded think tankers!

@HarryDisaOG @StramboEngr @realDonaldTrump Well, it actually is not a lie. Why would this be something to lie about? He kinda told me as much as you can tell from the message he sent. One thing I don't do is lie. You can apologize for being an asshole any time now. https://t.co/iY7enhqqlW
@thomaskaine5 @CaMomInOz I'm way ahead of you. The bare necessities is all I can afford and I use the public bus to get around. Which is  huge if anyone is familiar with how strange some people are that take public transportation and they usually insist on sitting next to me.
@StramboEngr Lol you'd have to ask them since I can't recall anyone ever saying that to me.
@NZCatfood @realDonaldTrump That's just nasty lol
@BlkAndPr0ud I get bitched at on Twitter for my potty mouth, saying shit and fuck etc. I've got nothing on what this racist, stupid,  bigoted fool is spewing. And I guarantee it's the exact same type of person this man is that get onto me for fucking cussing. Fuck him. Fuck them. Hellfuckshit
@BlueInRedCity @Esoundofsilence @realDonaldTrump Quote directly from ticket site:	"You may only register up two (2) tickets per mobile number per event."	Shouldn't it say: "You may only register up to two (2) tickets per mobile number per event."? 	Might seem petty but this typo is typical of the entire lame ass presidentcy.

@annieka77 @LynnieNJ1967 @keith_deger @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Thank you. It's nice to have a civil disagreement for once. That's something that doesn't happen too often lol.
@annieka77 @LynnieNJ1967 @keith_deger @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump But it is a go-to argument as I said "for some", I never said it was the go-to for all. Which seems to be the whole point in the first place. I don't assume everyone that backs Trump uses it yet it is assumed anyone not backing Trump supports Hillary. That's the hypocrisy to it.
The people of North Korea believe their "Supreme Leader" Kim Jong Un doesn't even take a dump. If @realDonaldTrump told me he doesn't take a dump I'd totally believe him. It's the only thing that makes sense of how full of shit he is.
@LynnieNJ1967 @annieka77 @keith_deger @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump I couldn't agree more! It drives me nuts that's the go-to argument for some people. Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump You are absolutely DELUSIONAL!
@ShibbyWhoKnew Trump sat alone in a boggy swamp	Totally emotionless except for his love for himself	Mud flowed up into Trump's pajamas	He totally confused all the passing democrats		He's Trump, he has a lump in 	 in his head He's Trump, let's hope the lump makes him dead
@realDonaldTrump All your ridiculous claims about Dems not wanting a safe country is yet another example you your rantings that make no sense and spreading lies for your base to grab onto. It's just insane.
@realDonaldTrump Oh look you filled any entire high school bleachers where they play basketball. Biggest crowd ever. Again.
@EPAScottPruitt @CECweb @EPAallnations Why the hell do you still have a job? You he'd to be sued for contributing to climate change. Either way you'll burn in hell.

@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @Stop_Trump20 I had the same dream except she wasn't welcomed at a Waffle House. Weird!
@realDonaldTrump Where are those ugly ass ties of yours made again?
@funder Why a meeting? Didnt Putin say they talk regularly?
@realDonaldTrump 	Way to negotiate there Mr. Deal Maker. Weren't you just bragging their nuclear threat was no longer a problem? Maybe a little less bullshit talking and a little more truth. You did nothing in NK. The most full of shit president ever. 	https://t.co/3mlg9Oh6RR
@realDonaldTrump But your family can have as many factories as y'all want in any country right? Biggest hypocrite EVER!
@realDonaldTrump Yes, you're so right. Who in their right mind wouldn't want our streets filled with crime? How ridiculous to want to feel safe in our homes, at school &amp; work. I love getting mugged &amp; beat up when I go for a walk. 		Are you a damn idiot or something? Stupid to say we WANT CRIME!!
@realDonaldTrump Trust me that's NOT the most profound question of our era.  The question is how big of an influence did Russia have in getting you elected. Chew on that for a bit k.
@msmarymck @realDonaldTrump I think he was born with it. Not a penis but envy. Lol
@dewaaier112 Lol thank you. Good "seeing" you too. Well, I can't actually see you but you know what I mean. ü§ì
@realDonaldTrump Our judicial and court system are one of the things that make America three great country out is. And boy it'll be awesome to see you have your day in court. Unless you'd rather avoid the embarrassment and opt for the hanging in the town square without the right to a fair trial
@realDonaldTrump Why do you claim anyone who disagrees with you has a low IQ? You must have IQ envy.
@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue Haha
@dewaaier112 @SandaBlue @FLOTUS Actually I can't imagine a woman with class such as her doing that. So point well taken.
@wmcarterelliott @MikeForMAGA @USA_AllenK @AynRandPaulRyan @MisterMagnnum @realDonaldTrump Hate is a strong word but is the correct word considering he's yet to do anything worth liking him for.
@dewaaier112 Well fucking thank you LOL
@be_gi @AynRandPaulRyan @MisterMagnnum @realDonaldTrump Yeah, because using a form of child abuse as a cruel punishment is sooooo Christian right? Study after study agree it's okay to fucking cuss and only offends simpletons like yourself.
@realDonaldTrump If a man is dirty on the outside then he's the current president who's filthy on the inside.
@realDonaldTrump Your taxes have been repeatedly requested and initially you're the one that promised to release them. You much have some evidence of something corrupt you want to stay hidden. Otherwise why not release them? You're nothing more than a crook and liar!

@Buhhrrraaadddd @AynRandPaulRyan @MisterMagnnum @realDonaldTrump Keep talking because you make it crawl too. Now you and your Trump can go crawl back under your rock.
@adrock512 Just a FYI, drink a little or pour a bit out of a bottle (not glass bottle duh) of coke then freeze. No, they don't explode as I've been doing this literally for decades. Then you have to open it to release any pressure . Then break it up with something. Slushy coke every time

@cyndee31 If you still can't understand after that her 3 year old sister could help you understand.
@cyndee31 him watch many news sources. Therefore,¬† if the number of us watching them had only 1 source like you do when combined would BY FAR outnumber the number of you watching Fox &amp; Trumps Friends. Can you understand that or should I get my 7 year old granddaughter to explain it to you?
@cyndee31 You're the one that doesn't understand shit. You've one outlet which gives you the news you pander to. We, on the other hand, have several to choose from. So to be fair, Fox &amp; friends numbers reflect the entirety of Trump supporters while those who are wise and don't support...
We need to keep track of all the nice things @realDonaldTrump  has said about Manafort &amp; Cohen just to have as comparison to what he'll say about them after they cooperate &amp; he denies he ever said anything nice about them at all.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump So why don't you beef up gang task forces, get tougher on crime? You haven't said a damn word about being tougher on crime and making those responsible for those crimes accountable for them. Making children and all immigrants suffer won't stop MS-13 crimes! Bullshit leader.
Obviously @realDonaldTrump didn't get everything he deserved for his birthday. 		Maybe July 4th America will get theirs with him gone!
@DogginTrump @d1Vinman FUCKING YEAH!
@Billygotnochill @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I laugh at more than just the name. You? Like all of it?
@simontalks12 I'll tell ya why because they'll end up thinking like you do, fooled. Keep watching your "one" channel, we like real choices with real facts. Idiot.
@LunaucPerkon @Billygotnochill @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews They have their own houses with their own TV's. I said I didn't want them watching it I didn't say I wouldn't let them like I still control them as adults hence the "lol" implying a joke.
@Billygotnochill @LunaucPerkon @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews If you don't I will lol
@cyndee31 Yeah we're all sorry... ...sorry he's president. What's the obsession with ratings?! You have multiple legit news stations and 1 bullshit news station. Of course the 1 bullshit station is being watched by ALL of you. Add up the total watching the others combined and its not close
@babysgramma @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Yeah by a president who acts like an 8 year old bully with his infantile name calling, his followers and probably a shit ton of other people who watch just because it's like watching a damn wreck, hard to look away, or to see for themselves what fake news looks like.

@stopusaa2 @AynRandPaulRyan @MisterMagnnum @realDonaldTrump Spare me your holier than thou crap.

That may be something you would do but it's not something anybody with a sense of freewill would ever do. Go away you fool.

@TheEternalAbys What? A mothers testimony is worth diddly ? You can talk to me, what'd your momma do too ya?
@realDonaldTrump James Shaw is also a hero who also raised 1/4 of a million dollars for the victims. You've yet to mention him on Twitter. Just a reminder.
@TheEternalAbys Too late. My kids are awesome, responsible adults raised by a loving mother who swears and taught them to think for themselves. Not follow some asshole to their doom.
@LoriMichaelFl @FoxNews Lol that's funny. I think you may be onto something Lori üòé
@rickyha38401941 @realDonaldTrump @NavalAcademy Yeah, I know nothing of war. Cuban missile crisis means nothing to me. STFU
@NickBarbella1 IKR! It's like a damn cult!
@rickyha38401941 @JTMYVA @GregShugar @realDonaldTrump Technically, yes.
@rickyha38401941 @realDonaldTrump @NavalAcademy Another war dip shit.
@rickyha38401941 @JTMYVA @GregShugar @realDonaldTrump Go fuck your mother! Again!
Seriously, I've about had my fill of Trump supporters. Your arguments are at best a repetitive joke and your logic left a long time ago. You follow a lying sack of shit, you believe  the rants of a lunatic on the brink of losing HIS MIND! Your mother ship sailed a long time ago.
@rickyha38401941 @JTMYVA @GregShugar @realDonaldTrump Sick it! Funny because did you know Trump is of German descent? Who's the Nazi now mother fucker?
@sherndds @realDonaldTrump He's a disgusting pig with no morals or shame.
@realDonaldTrump @NavalAcademy Lead us to victory?? What? Are we at war? Cause you sure are talking like we're at war. Asshole Pucker.
@realDonaldTrump Why does he have to continue to suffer by being forced to spend time with you for hells sake! Hasn't he been through enough?
@realDonaldTrump It is you're administration isn't it? Those kids disappeared under your watch. You need to fix this one thing then show yourself out. There's the door don't let it hit ya on the way out.
@JTMYVA @GregShugar @realDonaldTrump Don't flatter yourself like he wants to do you in the ass or something. Trump butt licker.

@TheRynheart @MaureenManos @NRA So the answer is limit the media not access to weapons? What is happening to this country? We need help.
@realDonaldTrump Feeling insecure this morning? Blah, blah, blah, blah.
@realDonaldTrump And you saying someone is a spy is different than them being an informant. Just cause you say something doesn't make it true little Donnie.
@realDonaldTrump My ancestor George W. was Secretary of the Navy and founded the Naval Academy. He came to me in a dream last night and told me to tell you to "stay the fuck away, you're not welcome there." I hope he haunts you when you make this all about you.
@realDonaldTrump @USNavy @WhiteHouse A military member trusted you enough to put something around his neck? You got off lucky he has social skills he  could have used.

Apparently I'm on 2 lists. What a couple of assholes. Why don't they just block people? Why put them in their stupid little list? https://t.co/IMkM6YGCb8
@realDonaldTrump You've shown nothing but hate &amp; contempt for the FBI. Now you believe something positive or beneficial was said or done concerning yourself &amp; all of a sudden you think they're 'GREAT.' Has anyone evaluated you for bipolar disorder or multiple personalities #TrumpIsSybil
@jefftiedrich The thing that pisses him off is the fact that his "shit show" isn't scripted like his other show.

"Asshole, liar, cheater, colluder, obnoxious, piece of shit, worst president ever hunt" just so people don't get confused. 	@realDonaldTrump
I'm visiting my bff in Salem, Massachusetts. I thought I'd run into Mueller since this is the place of true "witch hunts." I've asked and nobody has seen him around and they aren't too happy D.C. is stealing their place in history. A suggesting was for Trump our call it
@RealCandaceO Let's see how many years before this wonderful country (Yes, it's wonderful despite Trump) elects another Republican. Then we can talk about the crap you just spewed. Might even be dead from old age by then.
@Trumpty_Dumptee @realDonaldTrump Haha. Heard they pulled them off the shelves after holes big enough that an asshole could get through.
@bernabephoto @NBCNews They could get more Trumps using that type of bait. Seriously though this is just sick and wrong. I have fewer and fewer nice things to say about mankind.
@realDonaldTrump I'm visiting a friend in Salem, Mass right now. I've looked everywhere for Mueller and he ain't here. I could have sworn this is where the witch hunts happen.
@realDonaldTrump We're all pro-life stupid. It's either pro-choice or anti-abortion. You can't seem to get your brain to understand a lot of things. You're saying pro-life because if your mom had had the option she would have aborted your ass. Sucks for America she didn't.
@realDonaldTrump A confidential informant is not a spy you idiot! You're the only one who is hurting this country. Those meetings with Russians any of you Trump have had you can bet your ass they were spies for Putin.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I'm somebody and I sure ain't part of that "everybody" you're talking about.
@realDonaldTrump Automakers have asked you to stop deregulating emissions because they believe the consensus of science in climate change. Why the hell won't you listen to them and us!! Not to mention Harley Davidson will no longer be making their bikes in the US due of you. Sorry piece of shit.
@Enterprise1138 You forgot shame and greed.
Car makers have come to their senses.  If they would now join forces and implement the changes needed without legislation or law. Why can't they just make cars that are better for the environment? Why do these standards have to be law? I don't get it. 		https://t.co/7sVaMoSLnb
@MarikoToyoNo @drix78 I thought they had to be virgins. Must all be fake news.
@realDonaldTrump America wonders "WHERE IN THE WORLD IS BARACK OBAMA NOW!" and wish he were still president instead of you.
@Lioness1999 @The_UnSilent_ Exactly. I guess that's what you give to the man who has everything. Now we know.
@Lioness1999 @The_UnSilent_ It really is sad. I mean they look well taken care of but shouldn't be pets. Ever. They could never be set free and survive yet it's confusing (by confusing I mean fucked up) that they may be safer living in a cage. We humans know no shame.
@realDonaldTrump Executing a search warrant is not breaking into homes dummy. Are you really this ignorant or is it an act? It's getting harder to tell lately.
@realDonaldTrump You'll have plenty of time to write your mystery fiction novel soon. Need some money on your commissary for paper? Ask Putin, he'll help you out again.
@realDonaldTrump Cost to Taxpayer: At least $67,403,038		That's what you've spent golfing so STFU!
@WholeLottaRosex So sorry for your loss. I had to put my cat down a few months ago, he was my sister's cat that I adopted after she died. That was one of the most painful decisions I've ever made so I can empathize. I've had pets die before but this felt different. Stay strong.
@The_UnSilent_ Looks like some rich guy in Dubai decided he wanted a few pets. Too bad people suck and would surely hunt them in the wild. I hope they take precautions to avoid any harm to humans. That would be a death sentence for the cats, all because a guy had to have tigers for his birthday

@realDonaldTrump 	I hope you gave your congratulations to the royal newlyweds. Don't take it personal you weren't invited. 		Bahaha I'm kidding it was totally personal. I bet you're soooooo butt hurt right now. You're not big enough of a man to congratulate them invited or not.
@dewaaier112 Lol you're doing a fine job. You have a wonderful teacher lol üòá
@Morecoldbeer @gryphonmom @drix78 I'm sure there is enough lava for the entire family.
@realDonaldTrump "Clean Coal" doesn't exist. Your deregulatory assault poisons people with arsenic, boron,¬†cadmium, chromium, cobalt,¬† copper,¬†lead,¬†mercury, molybdenum, selenium, thallium and uranium and releases huge amounts of CO2 contributing to climate change. NOTHING about coal is clean!
@Unpersuaded112 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I've always felt the best parades are the ones where those being honored are forced to march for one man. Having civilians march for those in the armed forces and display their true gratitude and support for our military would just be silly.
@drix78 LMAO great idea. Toss his ass to the lava gods. If he were a true American he'd be willing to sacrifice himself to save the world. Or at least one of his kids.
@RepMoBrooks 	Did you seriously say the rise in sea level could be due to rocks falling into the sea rather than climate change?? Have you ever talked to a scientist or glanced at the IPCC report concerning climate change? Try doing some research and homework before you speak.
@dewaaier112 Lol yeah what the fuck were you thinking?? Bahaha
@realDonaldTrump You're mistaken. See, back in the day they truly believed there were witches so that's why they actually had what they thought were true 'witch hunts.' Nobody believes you're a witch so this is more like a "lying, cheating, colluding jerk hunt."
@EPAScottPruitt @UnitedEggProd Hey, Pruitt wanna get laid??		Crawl up a chickens ass! 		@EPAScottPruitt 	@EPA
@realDonaldTrump #1 fake news source is you, 2nd only to Fox. What is it exactly you've done in the past 17 months that's so successful? Just asking for a friend... The people of the United States would like to know.
@realDonaldTrump Unwarranted my ass. How many people have pled guilty or been charged. The fact Mueller is still investigating only means he continues to find evidence. The fact you continue trying to undermine the investigation shows your overall panic. Let him do his damn job.
@Zistar01 @KrzysztofKrakow It's definitely incomplete. Scott Pruitt is waaaaaaay at the top! That sorry son of a bitch!
@rcjohns64 @realDonaldTrump Yeah by "UTI" I was implying an "STD" lol

@SkyWayPatriot @leslierig @realDonaldTrump Is that really your defense for Trump? Shit rolls downhill and its a mighty big pile Mueller has to climb.
@realDonaldTrump Has nothing to do with Cohen being paid $600,000 does it? Oh, they turned over papers to Mueller in case you're wondering. You might want to think of resigning just in case. Asswipe.

@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump You'd given me no reason to call you a Nazi or a racist so why would I? Too bad when you're proven wrong for supporting that jerk that I'm sure you won't be big enough of a person to come and admit it to me. Think what you will as ill-informed as you are. Time will tell won't it
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump The appointment of Pruitt to head the EPA is the thing that got me questioning Trump. Deregulation is doing nothing but harm to OUR beloved US. If you truly love this county then this and pulling out of the climate accord is cause for concern. Please research w/ an open mind.
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump A man that has sued the EPA on behalf of fossil fuel should not be in charge of the EPA. Planting seeds of doubt that there is no scientific consensus is wrong &amp; and is denying science. I want my granddaughters to inherit a clean, safe planet. Great material is out there.
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump He lost the vote of the people remember? Had a little Russian help too. He's a sack of shit and y'all are nothing but fools.
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump Yeah ok. Real data like on the government EPA site. Nothing cherry picked on any of them I'm sure. Get real.
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump You need to practice what you preach for fucks sake. Y'alls ignorance is astounding! You all refuse the see or even question what you think is true. Try doing a little unbiased searching for once. I did. I liked Trump initially til I questioned a few things.
@JamesHasson20 @gphumber Trump likes his hero's who actually fought. He doesn't realize how many American's that are true heroes and are fighting and suffering every single day he's president.	Here's to all America's unsung heroes. Don't stop fighting, you're not alone!
@TimKelley5 @misterbumface @Frankhaase9 @realDonaldTrump I think your 50% was far too low. If you are referring to the percentage that want him gone that is.
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump Strange how the ONE source of news most Trump supporters rely on and believe is the ONLY one out of every source on the planet who's news and opinions differ from all the others and from the actual facts.
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump I bet you believe Trumps dad have him a million dollar loan don't you??
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump Hell if I know. I'm not a Hillary fan so I bet anyone obsessed with her would know. Do enlighten me. I had to Google msm so there goes that theory. I prefer researching things I have questions about over relying on 1 news source. U might try it sometime u may learn some truth.

They have more mental breakdowns.
@Frankhaase9 @TimKelley5 @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump Are we focusing too much on his lies? Or him taking credit for virtually anything? Or on the fact he can't keep the very people he appoints and hires? Maybe we focus on him changing his mind every other day?  Could it be the endless scandals? Did I mention his lies?
@TimKelley5 @misterbumface @Frankhaase9 @realDonaldTrump The majority do want him gone. There's no way in hell 50% approve of Trump.
@TuckerCarlson 	On your show tonight you said Russia wasn't a threat but China is. Referring to the economy not that it matters. Do you know how much of Trumps and the Trump families merchandise is manufactured in China and other countries compared to the US? You're full of shit!
@TimKelley5 @misterbumface @Frankhaase9 @realDonaldTrump He's the President of the United States but that doesn't mean he's America's president. More people than not wish him n gone.

@realDonaldTrump Timeless VALUES!! Your values expired a long time ago, if you ever had any. How can someone as well off as you, "educated" having dealt with people your entire life be such a social idiot? You're scared of the NRA and so full of shit. I'm bout to SCREAM!!! AAAHHHHHH!!!!!!
I've seen a lot of events in my day that called for both the President and the Vice President to attend but an NRA event isn't one of them. What a load of bullshit! 		@realDonaldTrump 	@VP 	@NRA
Boy, aren't you being snarky today? Y'all need to get your stories straight! This shit is ridiculous. 	@realDonaldTrump
@dewaaier112 Yeah, a lot of people are worried about that. Guess we'll have to wait and see which child comes out of their playdate having bullied the other out of their cookies.
@claudiapoindex2 @Unpersuaded112 Lol I know they were scared. I have a problem with feeling forced to follow or believe only what others believe. It would feel too much like brainwashing. I knew that couple would leave when I said that. They wouldn't have listened unless my beliefs were their beliefs.
@realDonaldTrump saying "learn before you speak" just blows my mind! Wow!

@Unpersuaded112 Same here. No organized religion. I had a husband and wife with their baby come to my door wanting me to join their church. I told them God was any alien. They snatched their baby and left real fast. All I meant was by definition he was. Meaning not from here.

@Mike52944378 @realDonaldTrump He's definitely insecure isn't he?

@realDonaldTrump One question:	If the affair happened in 2006 why was it that she wasn't paid to keep quiet until 2016, a decade later, if it wasn't related to the campaign? 	We all know the answer to that one. It was related. Just another in your long list of orange colored lies!
@JungwirthJoyce Lol then I've got 2 of ya fooled. No, really thank you though.
To Trump people:	There is a huge difference between support and defense. We're not against you supporting your President but your defence of the corrupt, immoral &amp; shameful things he's done &amp; said. By doing so you tell him it's okay &amp; we're telling you it's not!	@realDonaldTrump

@funder I just found https://t.co/CR7taQktcD which has all his tweets and can be searched by date. February 20, 2017, the day Comey testified he was very busy. Kinda interesting seeing what he tweeted on those days.
Is it just me or does anyone else see this as racist?		@realDonaldTrump	Did you really NOT tweet about¬†Nigerian President Muhammadu Buharis' visit today?!?! 	You tweeted about other things so it's not like you were busy. I can't help but feel this is because he's black.
@daumkeziah You'd think finding a dress from that you found so beautiful you wanted to wear it to one of the most important nights in a young woman's life would be a compliment, not an insult! They're worn for work at airlines, hotels and restaurants in Asia so why the big deal she wears one

Listening to people talking about this "smoky lies" insult thing it becomes obvious they heard @michelleisawolf wrong. The look on SHS's face shows she heard "fat"not "fact" as did so many others. And some men actually think "smoky eyes" is an insult lol.
@thepublocal @realDonaldTrump Lmao sometimes one has to stop fighting autocorrect on certain words. I do it allot. And I mean allot!
We all learned our lies have color. SHS lies are a SMOKE color. Trumps lies are, as we all know, ORANGE. Scott Pruitts lies vary in the RUST to GREENISH with a hint of BLACK range. Most of the others I'm thinking are RED. 	üòâü§î @realDonaldTrump

@thepublocal @realDonaldTrump Credit for what???? Saying something that may or may not happen? He can say anything and y'all act like God spoke or something. Do you credit him with Mexico paying for his wall? Cause he said that too ya know.
@Mary_Lee__ @realDonaldTrump Ooh yes, some. That was intentional. I hate when I'm grouped into a set belief of this or that and its something I've never even heard of for example. If you're anti Trump it means you're pro Hillary or some shit. Maybe I'll be given the same courtesy.  Ha

@SCOTTRBRYCE1 @realDonaldTrump Don't get fucking snarky. I'm going to the credit for man landing on Mars. Isn't that awesome! Didn't think you'd live to see the day did you? You're welcome. 		Hasn't happened yet but people are talking about it.
@thepublocal @realDonaldTrump Y'all are insane I swear. Thing's are being said, promises made but nothing has been done YET! What the hell is wrong with you?? Don't answer that. At this point I'm really just talking to myself. Have a nice day.
@Flyblueeagle1 @realDonaldTrump Awesome. Keep that magic 8 ball handy in case I have more questions. Thank you.
@thepublocal @realDonaldTrump It is according to Trump. Yet here you are sticking up for them when it suits the need. Whatever
@DonovanColleen @realDonaldTrump And I hope they denuke and peace begins. But my argument was with giving Trump credit for things like Nk &amp; SK being one country with no nukes ALREADY. NK has a history of saying they'll do things and not do them. Counting chickens before they hatch is all.
@thepublocal @realDonaldTrump But... but isn't that "fake news?"
@duucellier_toby @Cynacin @SCOTTRBRYCE1 @realDonaldTrump Lol I'll give ya that one k
@jef_poskanzer @LATbermudez No, Americans don't. Insecure, Trump supporting Americans do but Americans as a whole don't. Unfortunately I can only say that in English because I'm not as lucky and gifted as this little girl. Her mother is obviously proud of her as she should be.

I really hate calling people stupid or crazy but holy fucking shit  some of the people who support @realDonaldTrump are bat shit stupid crazy!
@SCOTTRBRYCE1 @realDonaldTrump Credit for what? For Kim SAYING he's going to do something? Nothings been done. They haven't even met. Y'all are taking and giving credit for something that hasn't happened and for damn sure will blame someone else if it doesn't!
@LetsMake_Great_ @ShibbyWhoKnew @realDonaldTrump Lol that made sense when I said it. Someone changed their name or something.
Like everything these days this isn't about me, it's not about you, it's about TRUMP!! https://t.co/OM5cukWvfi
@realDonaldTrump Something to chew on Trump. If Kim intended to denuke as  you claim and are already taking credit for then why hasn't he announced it to the people of NK. Kim has the news and media of your dreams and force feds them information. He hasn't told them because he's playing you.

Then you praise Trump for having the smarts for doing so. Someone files and not every party gets what was owed, they have to settle for less.
@TadpoleTay @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump I simply asked a question. Didnt he file bankruptcy? Y'all were the ones attacking. Tell me I'm mistaken, filing for bankruptcy settles certain debts. They agree for the most part to accept a lower amount than owed. The one filing walks away better off the others don't.

Y'all act like that's the reason you'd start a business just so you could file and not pay what you owe others. Like you're bragging.
Apparently new rules/laws are in place. Now if you tweet anything negative about Trump you must:	Own a successful business or businesses.	Screwed people over to get where you are. 	Be a billionaire or say you are. 	You will be demanded to have proof to the above.

@Prhzliis088 @Gary67083850 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump YEAH! What he said üòõ
@OilSleuth @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump I didn't have room for everything lol. Add as many as you'd like.
@RickyStixProd @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump No they fucking don't! Good Lord.
@74_parkes @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump That seems like pretty good odds. Unless you're the one that didn't get paid and watched him walk away.
@OilSleuth @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump True but money can't buy morals, personality, compassion, humility, empathy etc. Then there's that hair. With that much money you'd think he'd do something with that shit on his head.
@Gary67083850 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump What haven't you heard? Those of us who believe in science and climate change just sit back and collect our check. I mean that is what y'all claim that it's a hoax orchestrated for financial gain right? Y'all so smart ü§¢
@ArleneZezza @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump You seem to be wrong all the time. A commercial painting business and a golf ball diving business (yes, really)
@Gary67083850 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Simple. It's mine and everyone's business because he's the mother fucking president which is a PUBLIC office. Deal with that fact ok.
@Robluv44 @roc345_mark @johno187m @SteveBucci1 @carasm10 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump BAHAHA because Trump wasn't sued for not renting to people of color. Told black people the apartment was taken then a white person was sent in and magically the apartment was available. Sued and lost for being a racist pig.
@Robluv44 @SteveBucci1 @carasm10 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Because he's the fucking president and what he does is our business like it or not! God are you really that dense?
@realDonaldTrump	What a brilliant businessman. Such morals. Such honesty. 		https://t.co/5YOIUlLo68
@danmabtaylor @OldrikJansen @RealRobReid1965 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Lol I'm sure you know my life. Stalker.
@danmabtaylor @realDonaldTrump So are you.
@danmabtaylor @OldrikJansen @RealRobReid1965 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Some like it a little rough. Who's the one bringing up the Clinton's and Obama constantly?? Take your own advice.
@JayKay89266490 Absolutely brilliant idea you have. We'll just relocate them all. Don't know why that wasn't thought of before. Oh yes I do, BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING STUPID!!!
@georgew66481337 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Yes a cat got my tongue. What now?
@xjohnnyboy1021x @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Who claimed he did? It's only fake because you're saying it was claimed.
@danmabtaylor @OldrikJansen @RealRobReid1965 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump The point is he lied yet again when he offered and would release them.
@georgew66481337 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump You a jack ass?
@BNeessen @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump I don't get jealous. I get mean but not jealous.
@KEITHWA23844994 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Oh I'm sorry, you mean we had an  option?
@BNeessen @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump And that would be why.
@JayKay89266490 You're delusional if that's what you think. The refusal to believe in science is mind blowing.
@higgins_donna @sjr8455 @Antwonton @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump They act like there are no losers when someone files for bankruptcy. Somebody ain't getting paid.
Well folks today is the day, it's finally happened. It was just a matter of time until Trump supporters synced their periods. It explains why they're so sensitive and bitchy today!		@realDonaldTrump

@iamRichieRoman @SteveBucci1 @carasm10 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump And apparently a few Americans.
@SteveBucci1 @carasm10 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump If America is worried about my finances then things are worse than imagined. Really. Who gives a damn about my finances. Defect much?
@carasm10 @Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Lol
@KeithWilde7 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Well no Keith you're wrong. So üòù
@Antwonton @higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Got sued (and lost) for being a racist landlord too.
@DavidBeltran718 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump And/or definitely.
@danmabtaylor @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump He didn't build shit his father and grandfather did. Long line of scumbags.
@ctldc @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Apparently selling the souls of your entire family to the devil pays well.
@Patrides99 @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels The problem is when she was paid the money to be quiet. The rest of it is just tabloid fodder and not the core issue. It's the money and when it was paid. Get it now????
@p_jeanne97 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Oh yeah huh? There's that too.
@Patrides99 @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels Lmao ummmm yeah it kinda is a crime.  Telling me too grow up while you support a name calling man child is funny. Later. I'm done arguing with an idiot.
@Patrides99 @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels And nothing is gone until Mueller is finished investigating. He can't seem to finish because he keeps finding more and more shit. Worship that POS if you want. Idiot.
@Patrides99 @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels I think you shouldn't worry about how I talk to whom ever and start thinking about things that matter. If Trump paid someone to suppress a story that could possibly sway peoples vote during his run for the presidency then he committed a crime!
@Patrides99 @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels You don't understand it's not relevant. People are more concerned about what the current president is or is not doing. They aren't worried about what a past president did. Do you get that. 		Oh and fuck you. 	Love,  Trash Mouth Bitch
@higgins_donna @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Lol thank you for clearing that up.
@Patrides99 @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels Living on the standard of two wrongs make a right is whats sad. Who gives a flying fuck about Bill Clinton right now? Only people like you who can't think of anything else to justify the shit Trump does that's who.
@DuszaLukasz @realDonaldTrump That's some funny shit! Nobody asked him to run, he wanted to. What do you think a presidents income is? Our taxes have paid FAR more in golf cart rentals for the Secret Service  to follow him around while he golfs! Not to mention who knows what shady deals he's got going. Wah!
@realDonaldTrump You aren't even pretending that you want only illegal aliens gone anymore.
@realDonaldTrump We're all getting cheated by you. Worst president EVER.
@Patrides99 @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels I'd believe a whore before the man who fucks a whore behind his wife's back and then lies about it (and pretty much anything that comes out of his mouth) to the entire world. You should feel bad for the entire planet because you voted for his sorry ass.
@realDonaldTrump BAHAHA we know you're more of a spy, you're friends with Putin. What a stupid thing for you to say. Even more stupid than usual.
@RentonRoger @peplamb God must be a democrat.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Yeah, a business man who couldn't even run a casino. Hasn't he filed for bankruptcy a few times?
@bernabephoto Like I need a shirt for that! Haha
@MrChanceCoopR @PenceConscience @realDonaldTrump The rainbow flag hates you too. Buttwipe.
@kenolin1 That's easy. Trump.
@Mary_Lee__ I do occasionally then realised they don't reciprocate so I don't so much any more.
@WaysandMeansGOP @realDonaldTrump @RepKevinBrady @USATODAY #TaxDay????? Does that mean @realDonaldTrump  is going to release his??!!
Not so surprising considering most men talk out their ass. üòÑüòÉüòâ		https://t.co/VBFGucItwd
@FoxNews @Franklin_Graham What a crock of shit! Trump golfs on Sunday he doesn't go to church. Holy crap people have lost their damn minds!
@CNN @cnnbrk Why are you attacking Comey. When he's referring to Trumps hands they were being talked about at the time. He's 6'8" hair is kinda in his view. He's simply saying what he was thinking at the time not being petty or judgmental. Besides who doesn't talk about that damn hair??
@vietcoat Mmmmmm lol
@bernabephoto I saw the documentary and yes, I cried.
@kylegriffin1 Cohen owned the said documents and he was to view them? You'd think the dipshit would know what he has. Or rather had lol üòÑ As far as Trump he sure doesn't act like he's got something to hide.
@JimCarrey I'm sure something next to a Superfund site is available at a low price.
@Mary_Lee__ Actually nobody has given me shit about that. Guess I got lucky huh?
@Mary_Lee__ They've come from the dark side to ours lol
@drix78 "If we're lucky this one will survive their surgery"
@Mary_Lee__ I was Republican prior to this election. One of the best things I've ever done. I'll shout it from the rooftops too!
@90spilots @ebrownrochester I've let my kids take off for a surprise day at Busch Gardens lol. I believe that qualifies for mental health.
@kenolin1 @NBCThisisUs If you go through northern Utah there's a few places. Beto's (and Rosarita's) have the best, most authentic Mexican food and they're cheap, cheap, cheap. Andy's is a little dive bar that has Greek food and awesome souvlaki. For steaks etc. try Timbermine or Prairie Schooner.
@chuckwacreek @JohnRMoffitt @AllanMargolin @ChristiAnne67 And I'm not your girl!
@chuckwacreek @JohnRMoffitt @AllanMargolin @ChristiAnne67 It's not promoting the killing of animals, especially critically endangered ones. You might want to check out someone's profile before you start making judgements. Don't act condescending towards me. You spoke way too soon.
@EPAScottPruitt @EPA You mean THIS Andrew Wheeler? The lobbyist, the prior aide to Inhofe, the critic of greenhouse gas emissions, the one who supports the continued use of fossil fuel?? You mean THAT Andrew Wheeler? That's just fucking awesome.
@realDonaldTrump You can't fire him you moron!
@realDonaldTrump LMFAO!!!!!! You are an idiot!
@realDonaldTrump I'm thinking maaaaaaybe you should think twice before using the words "LEAKER" and "LIAR." üí¶üí©
@SteveZapata3 @realDonaldTrump Bahaha "do that shit." Did you even notice you said that!?
@realDonaldTrump Tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for an end to crime in the White House . Started in every corner of the world, where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be given justice!
@SteveZapata3 @realDonaldTrump Lol you're sick!
@AlexJones_Ex @inezsneks Just curious why you were found unfit or incapable of having them with you because he's harming (mentally) those children with his theories and warped views. Is the judge corrupt or being paid?
@AlexJones_Ex What possessed you to marry this "man"? I'm not sure that was the correct word to use
@SteveZapata3 @realDonaldTrump Someone of my caliber doesn't take coupons. Paaaalease!
@JavierArnoldPo1 @realDonaldTrump Maybe, maybe for $130,000 I'd think about it lol.
@timfisher836 @realDonaldTrump Yeah the most crooked and reviled president in history. It's amazing you defend him. Lordy, are you in for a hell of a letdown. When that happens whatever will you do besides delete your Twitter account and go into hiding?
@krassenstein Trump has ALLIES???????
@SteveZapata3 @realDonaldTrump Lmao why you wanting to compare prices???? ü§£üòÇü§£
@dewaaier112 @realDonaldTrump Lol now you got me worried about ya. It's called erotic asphyxiation. Looked it up lol.
@dewaaier112 @realDonaldTrump That's what I'm afraid of lol
I pee'd (*pissed?) on somebody once and charged him. I told him I'd shit on him for nothing though. I can think of someone that I'd do both to for free. 		@realDonaldTrump 	ü§£üòÇ üöΩüõè‚òîüí© üòá

@dewaaier112 While I appreciate the vote of confidence I'm sure there are much more qualified people out there lmao.  Besides I hate doing paperwork, it stressing me the fuck out. I say "fuck" too much too. Bahaha ü§£üòÉüòÑ
@TuckerCarlson  @realDonaldTrump	By his own admission Cohen said they were very professional and actually thanked them. This is how they're executed to citizens everyday.  And how can you say "if you're not guilty why worry?" when Trump is freaking the fuck out!
RT @ClimateReality: Climate change is threatening our planet in more ways than one ‚Äì but we‚Äôre not backing down in our fight for solutions,‚Ä¶
@RepSeanMaloney @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Tucker is such a moron. It's not about his sex life it's about the Russians and how they may be able to influence Trump. Just because Trump is a POS who assaults women and likes hookers peeing on him then that's his fault. My hell Tucker makes me sick!
@realDonaldTrump Give it a rest already. You won't be around long enough.
@dewaaier112 You're crazy lol

@dewaaier112 Lol my son would have to actually have to get on Twitter first.
@dewaaier112 Way to go!
@dewaaier112 I did lol.
@WollSteven @realDonaldTrump Ok creamsicle https://t.co/CDwVgARoeN
@dewaaier112 Well looky there. You caught ya a big un. Lol
@dewaaier112 Or I could just go look lol
@WollSteven @realDonaldTrump He's neither the goose nor the gander any longer now is he? Trump hates Obama and your argument is that he wants to emulate him in executive orders. Makes TOTAL sense to me. About as much sense as anything Trump does.
@WollSteven @realDonaldTrump Who gives a shit? He's not president is he? So sick of that being an argument that people think is relevant.
@realDonaldTrump Besides executive orders what exactly is it you've done. You do things like this because you know nothing of yours would pass otherwise.
@dewaaier112 @realDonaldTrump I said "try" lol. I'm hoping it'll be like telling the truth for him. Something he just can't do.
@The_UnSilent_ With 7.48k retweets I think there has to be substance to him so shut up. Besides, he's hot! Lol
@realDonaldTrump You have to realize by now the reason he's still investigating is because he keeps finding things. If there were nothing to it he might have been done. Try not to have a stroke.
@realDonaldTrump Obviously if it relates to a crime then it doesn't exist. You're scared ain't ya?
@EPAScottPruitt @POTUS @EPA You have a little body and a big head. I mean literally. Your proportions remind me of a toddler. Except you weren't potty trained and you shit everywhere.
@TomthunkitsMind If you carry to term you carry til the end of your 9th month which is the beginning of your 10th month. Term is "technically"10 months long. Like this is the 21st century and the 22nd century starts year 2100. By 9 months does he mean the end of the 8th, meaning a month early?
@realDonaldTrump You're the damn president why don't you did something? Bitching about Obama and Hillary isn't accomplishing shit.
@realDonaldTrump Whether he wants to be friends or not damn it!
@realDonaldTrump Made up made garbage that's what this is. Just made up made garbage.
@PenceConscience If I could do magic I'd make these past 2 years disappear.
@PenceConscience It said it was made up made garbage. Isn't he suppose to be golfing?
@PenceConscience Lol better luck next time
@PenceConscience It had a typo. I bet he'll retweet.
@PenceConscience He deleted it cause I couldn't comment either.
@realDonaldTrump @WattersWorld Aren't you suppose to be pretending to do your job instead of worrying about what the fuck Hillary is doing. You really should focus! How can you run a country when all you do is run your mouth? Sad.
@realDonaldTrump You live in a fantasy world. Pruitt is doing nothing but deregulating for fossil fuels pocket. Neither of you give a shit about our environment. You're both looking out for your interests. He got death threats because he's fucking up our air and water. Fuck you both.
@JungwirthJoyce @realDonaldTrump IKR!

@realDonaldTrump So where are your taxes again? You know, the ones initially you offered to release? We've been requesting those for over a year. You're the embarrassment!
@realDonaldTrump The USPS was losing money way before Amazon came along. Pretty sure it had to do with other shipping/delivery companies. This is personal for you.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, Mexico is making soooo much money. I hear it's one of the richest countries in the world. Their standard of living far surpasses our own. Are you sure you don't want this wall to keep Americans from fleeing because you are in office??

@realDonaldTrump We'd like to weigh in on how much you paid in taxes (personal and business)but you refuse to show us after promising to. You're just jealous he hasn't filed for bankruptcy like you have.
@DplrablBear @Cwedding1 @Megan4MAGA @KarenCotter15 Lol now see you fail to realize I'm not a Hillary supporter so the fact that y'all bring her up time after time shows its your obsession. Who cares what she's doing? I sure don't so drop it already.
