Today marks TWO YEARS since I was sworn in as Administrator of @SBAgov! It’s been a privilege to serve our country &amp; our nation’s 30 million #smallbusinesses. Read my latest blog post for more on what our team has achieved &amp; our new goals looking forward: https://t.co/zz4gZrmNZf https://t.co/jNImYNJg1b
Low unemployment means more competition for skilled workers. @SBAgov encourages small businesses to work with local community colleges &amp; other entities to promote apprenticeships and to train workers with the skills they need. @SmallBizCmte
The #USMCA is the first trade agreement to include special provisions for small businesses. I look forward to helping more of them explore export opportunities. @SmallBizCmte
Cyber security is critically important to small businesses. @SBAgov is working to ensure entrepreneurs are aware of the threat and how to protect themselves and their data. @SmallBizCmte
The @SBAgov is working to promote women-owned businesses: a new digital platform will soon significantly enhance our outreach capabilities from 150,000 to 1 million users working with resource partners @AWBC_USA, @SCOREMentors and @ASBDC. @SmallBizCmte
There’s no such thing as status quo in business — you’re either growing or falling behind. @SBAgov is working to give small businesses the tools they need to succeed. @SmallBizCmte

This year @SBAgov is  working to launch a leadership program for #Veteran entrepreneurs in conjunction with the @DeptVetAffairs. The pilot funding was made possible through the donation to SBA of @POTUS quarterly salary. @SmallBizCmte

One of my proudest accomplishments during my two years at @SBAgov — visiting all 68 district offices during the #SBAIgniteTour and meeting with small business owners across the country. @SmallBizCmte
When I look back on the last two years, the SBA’s work in responding to natural disasters stands out. @SBAgov has been on the ground to assess damage and ultimately provide access to home and business loans, enabling survivors to get back on their feet. @SmallBizCmte
By the end of 2018, through better procedures and electronic processing, @SBAgov was able to reduce loan processing times by half. @SmallBizCmte
