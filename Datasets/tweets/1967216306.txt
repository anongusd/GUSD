We believe this is an effort by #Russia and #Syria to conduct their own staged investigation of #Douma, and to sanitize the locations of the suspected attacks by removing incriminating evidence of chemical weapons use.
We have credible information that indicates #Russia officials are working with the #Syria regime to deny and to delay inspectors from gaining access to #Douma, and to pressure witnesses to change their stories.

We urge our colleagues on the #UNSC and the @OPCW Executive Council to join us, as they have before, to create a unified front against the use of chemical weapons.  We cannot allow the normalization of chemical weapons use.
U.S. condemns use of chemical weapons anywhere, anytime, by anyone, under any circumstances.
Only the Government of Russia has the motive, means, and record to conduct such an attack.  Russia developed the type of military-grade nerve agent used in Salisbury and has a record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations.
As we have made clear, the United States agrees with the #UK’s assessment that #Russia is responsible for this use of chemical weapons on U.K. soil– either through deliberate use or through its failure to declare and secure its stocks of this nerve agent. https://t.co/HpFwtjbCCw

The United Kingdom, France and the United States acted, after careful evaluation, to deter the future use of chemical weapons by holding the #Syria regime responsible for its atrocities against humanity.
.@USUN Ambassador @nikkihaley: We didn’t give diplomacy one chance, we gave diplomacy chance after chance. We hoped diplomacy would succeed. But six times, #Russia used its veto to block #UNSC resolutions to address chemical weapons in #Syria. Last night, the time for talk ended.
We will continue our commitment to the @UN-led Geneva process for a political resolution to this conflict that respects the will of the Syrian people. #Syria
The use of #ChemicalWeapons anywhere in the world is an inexcusable violation of international law, and the United States will not tolerate it.

Our response, in coordination with our allies, #France and the #UnitedKingdom, integrates all elements of are our national power- military, economic and diplomatic- and will establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons.
Tonight, @POTUS ordered the U.S. Armed Forces to launch precision strikes on sites associated w/ the chemical weapons capabilities of the #Assad regime in #Syria. This comes in response to the #Douma attack, which was a significant escalation of a pattern of chemical weapons use.

The health, safety, and well-being of U.S. government personnel and family members are of the greatest concern for Secretary Tillerson and were a key factor in the decision to reduce the number of personnel assigned to Havana.

Ambassador Yun has served with distinction for more than 30 years, most recently as Special Representative for North Korean Policy and prior to that as U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia.
Ambassador Joe Yun, a respected member of the Senior Foreign Service, has decided to retire for personal reasons, and the Secretary has reluctantly accepted his decision and wished him well.
The United States calls for an immediate end to offensive operations and urgent access for humanitarian workers to treat the wounded and deliver badly needed humanitarian aid.
#Russia has the influence to stop these operations if it chooses to live up to its obligations under the #UNSC ceasefire.
The regime claims it is fighting terrorists, but is instead terrorizing hundreds of thousands of civilians with airstrikes, artillery, rockets, and a looming ground attack. The regime’s use of chlorine gas as a weapon only intensifies the misery of the civilian population.
The Syrian regime, and its Russian and Iranian backers, continue to attack East Ghouta, a densely populated suburb of Damascus, despite the ceasefire called for by the United Nations Security Council.

We will hold Iranian leaders accountable for their destabilizing activities. The entities sanctioned today are involved in Iran’s ballistic missile program, a program that takes valuable resources away from the Iranian people and their daily needs. https://t.co/Yl56Tw7361
We are ready to work w/ #Pakistan to combat all terrorists w/o distinction. We hope to renew &amp; deepen our bilateral security relationship when Pakistan demonstrates willingness to aggressively confront Afghan #Taliban, #Haqqani Network, and others who operate from its territory.
#Pakistan has suffered greatly from terrorism, and we have worked closely with its security services to combat groups that target Pakistani interests. Now, as we have supported them, we need Pakistan to deny safe haven to, or lawfully detain, those who threaten U.S. interests.
.@POTUS was clear when he announced his South Asia policy in August that no partnership can survive the harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. service members and officials. More than four months later, these groups still find sanctuary inside #Pakistan.
Until the #Pakistani government takes decisive action against groups, including the Afghan #Taliban and the #Haqqani Network, that are destabilizing the region and targeting U.S. personnel, the United States will suspend security assistance to the Pakistani military.
Our statement on #Iran: We support the legitimate aspirations of the Iranian people, and call on the government to allow free exchange of ideas and information. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the deaths and arrests to date. To the victims: you will not be forgotten. https://t.co/cUHOsqp7ka
We recognize that several of these countries are working to improve their respect for religious freedom, we welcome this initiative and look forward to continued dialogue.  The U.S. remains committed to advancing religious freedom around the world: https://t.co/8bJnXV65xZ
Today, we have re-designated #Burma, #China, #Eritrea, #Iran, #NorthKorea, #Sudan, #SaudiArabia, #Tajikistan, #Turkmenistan, and #Uzbekistan as Countries of Particular Concern, and #Pakistan as part of a Special Watch List for severe violations of religious freedom.
We believe that the protection of religious freedom is vital to peace, stability, and prosperity. So in accordance with legislation, @StateDept annually designates governments that have engaged in or tolerated systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. https://t.co/g0L7iFsdVo
I also talked about @POTUS’ repeated requests that #Pakistan take more action against militants and terrorists—going back to his announcement of the South Asia strategy in August—and our continued commitment to the maximum pressure campaign against #NorthKorea.
On @AmericaNewsroom today, I talked about @VP’s @WashingtonPost editorial where he strongly reiterated our support for the Iranian people. I echoed our desire to see other nations join in this support, and our call for Iran regime to start listening to its people. #IranProtests

Secretary Tillerson: Our hope remains that diplomacy will produce a resolution, but #NorthKorea must earn its way back to the table. The pressure campaign must and will continue until denuclearization is achieved. We will, in the meantime, keep our channels of communication open.
Secretary Tillerson: The #DPRK regime has a choice. It can reverse course, give up its unlawful nuclear weapons program, and join community of nations-- or it can continue to condemn its population to poverty and isolation.
Secretary Tillerson delivered a clear message at #UNSC: US and international community will not stand by as #NorthKorea continues to develop nuclear and missile capabilities that openly threaten international peace &amp; security. More can and must be done to further isolate #DPRK.

In response to this, I am announcing that the USA will provide an additional $47 million in assistance for refugees. The U.S. remains committed to humanitarian assistance the world over and we’re proud to distribute these funds on behalf of the American people.
Sec Tillerson in #Burma: The humanitarian scale of the #Rakhine crisis is staggering—over 600,000 refugees, mostly women and children, and an unknown number of internally displaced people w/o basic needs.
Sec Tillerson on #Rakhine State crisis: We are deeply concerned by credible reports of widespread atrocities committed by Myanmar’s security forces &amp; vigilantes. We condemn August 25th attacks on Myanmar Security Forces and reiterate that there is zero tolerance for such attacks.
Secretary Tillerson today in #Burma: I am here today to reaffirm our commitment to a successful democratic transition in #Myanmar, and that commitment remains strong. https://t.co/9ZSEbe0Bgq
The fight against #ISIS is not a game. It’s time for #Moscow to drop the propaganda and disinformation, and focus on destroying our common enemy.
