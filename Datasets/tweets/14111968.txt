@TMobileHelp so, I got this unknown charge of 50USD from #Tmobile on my credit card (which is not how I normally pay) Called 2x and was asked to send in my statement, its been almost a month and a half and tmobile hasn't gotten back to me. Not how you treat a customer of 12 yrs!

@Uber_Support thanks for the help. NOT. 2 months of a case report, and #UBER has done NOTHING to help other than autoresponse messages.
love how @Uber_Support has done absolutely nothing to help me with my, now 3 week old case of a crappy uber premiere car being sent (suzuki dzire) which is the SAME class of car as a UberX. Shameful #Uber
@Uber_Support still waiting on my issue to be resolved. been 3 weeks now. How hard can it be to resolve an issue where a swift dzire was sent when I booked a Uber premiere vehicle..? All support is doing is sending copy paste responses. Help
@Uber_Support all I get is copy paste responses from the India team. Utterly useless.
@Uber_Support still waiting for 2 weeks plus w my issue. Is it really that difficult to resolve when a Uber premiere car is a swift dzire? This is asinine. It should NOT take 2 weeks to review. I demand a refund

@EtihadHelp yeah well it's a shit and conniving policy
@EtihadHelp i paid full price for it. You cant simply cancel it n resell.I will continue to publicize this and steer ppl away from etihad
This is @EtihadAirways idea of helping a paying customer if they miss a flight #notoetihad https://t.co/2OFt5weLrE
@EtihadAirways i am not waiting anymore for your pretend help social team. I want what i paid for, issue a refund for part of my flight
@EtihadAirways worst airlines to fly. They will cancel your entire roundtrip if you miss any part of it. Completely unethical
@tach47 whoa thats cool, finally! Thanks for the headsup!
@Uber_Support thanks for the great support
@JeremyClarkson @YouTube watching this is so much better than the new #topgear can't wait for #grandtour
And that is why @ValeYellow46 is the champ. Must buy a @AGVHelmets to celebrate !! #rossivsmarquez
@EtihadAirways how ridiculous is it that i cant fly on the return part of my journey. I paid for it! You profit by selling my tix again!
tired of @EtihadAirways and their blatant disregard for customers. Canceling a roundtrip ticket entirely cz i missed one way? ridiculous
@SingaporeAir my number one choice for flying from #Asia to #America
@EtihadHelp @EtihadAirways I expect an answer and immediate resolution to my issue
@tach47 get a motorcycle!!
@Honda XR #motorcycle trip through #Vietnam. Its on the #bucketlist - whose in?
@EtihadHelp Please have someone from management contact me, a paid fare cannot be fully canceled and resold for your benefit.
@EtihadHelp i am trying to tell you that your social media team said they will not help me. They didnt give me any #. Please advise.
@EtihadHelp ive already left all sorts of feedback including at your email but everyone says they can't help. Which is why i am on soc media
@EtihadHelp How do I contact guest relations? I already contacted socialmedia@etihad and they responded they can't help
@EtihadHelp @EtihadAirways you canceled my entire booking, where is your sense of morality? No other airline does this. #notoetihad
@EtihadHelp @EtihadAirways i paid for a full ticket,EU visas require a ticket booked b4hand. I am not a psychic.I missed the flight by 2days
@EtihadHelp @EtihadAirways I will continue to post daily about my horrible experience on all social media platform and wherever possible
@EtihadHelp @EtihadAirways thats hilarious because they said the EXACT same thing. No one wants to help! #notoetihad https://t.co/0j1hRSaITs
@EtihadHelp you've said this and so has ur social media but no 1 says how to go about it, until then i will continue to tweet
@EtihadHelp I fly more than 80,000 miles in a biz year, i will post about this till a resolution that is fair is offered to me
@EtihadHelp WHY cant I not use part of the ticket? i paid for it, you just stole my seat and sold it to another customer. Its piracy!
@EtihadHelp i paid full price for a ticket, for a EU visa u have to buy tix first. I missed the visa by 2 days so i couldnt take the flight
@EtihadHelp They already responded saying they can't help me, i'm out of luck. That is why i'm posting publicly, this is just ridiculous
@EtihadHelp entire social network and business associates to never deal with @EtihadAirways
@EtihadHelp @SingaporeAir let me rebook a missed flight no questions asked. WTF is up with @EtihadAirways and their policy. I will tell my
@EtihadHelp for a EU Visa u need 2 have the tix before u apply. My wife missed her visa by 2 days, its simple. I shud be able to rebook
@EtihadHelp hw can u cancl an entire booking for missing 1 leg? Guess wat @SingaporeAir does? They allow you to hop on t he next flight!free
@EtihadHelp clarification on what?i was told that I have to buy a new ticket for missing 1 leg of my journey!my entire journey is canceld
@EtihadHelp yes they were of no help neither was your social media team. Call center told me to book a new ticket! Ridiculous
@EtihadAirways I dont see why the return portion can't be used? i clearly paid for it!
@EtihadAirways My wife's EU visa was not yet issued, it took another 2 days
@EtihadAirways the worst of the gulf carriers, complete boycott from here on
@tach47 lolol that's right hahahahha
@tach47 speaking of delays. Remember in India when we got rerouted thru some alley and had to sit for hrs!!
@tach47 was that a pun lol
@Uber_Support did..take a look
@uber used to work and it was great. Used it in atleast 10 diff countries. Now it doesn't work at all and not worth it. Useless app
@DubaiAirports why is DXB only 60 min free wifi? Really in this day and age? No wonder @ChangiAirport is the best in the world
@EmiratesSupport its a a380.. trust me plenty of seats available..DM 'd details
@Emirates why is it SO difficult to upgrade seats at the airport (any airport). Ridiculous

@askairasia while everyone is standing. Is ridiculous. Anyhow never flying an airline again where something as basic as water is not served
@askairasia i t was a traumatic experience. Im still without my bags.#neveragainairasia
@askairasia oh and my bags are lost !
@askairasia he didn't even announce when plane was about to taxi. Passengers were all standing and no announcements or status updates
@askairasia you'll see a lot of complaints pour in due to pilots behavior
@askairasia on top of that you don't even serve free water nor do you take cards. Its archaic and really, no fee water? It's barbaric
@askairasia on flt 554 we were grounded for 2 hrs in the plane. Pilot made no announcements. No service. A 3 hr flight turns into 5hrs
@askairasia there has not been a single worse flying experience than my trip from dps to ccu. And lost bags isnt even the issue
Annnnnd @airasia loses my bags after massive delays. Never again. #airasia you suck
I would rather contract ebola than willingly book another flight w @AirAsia again #airasia #fml
