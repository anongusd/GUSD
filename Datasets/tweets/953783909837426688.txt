@MomsRising @SenBobCasey @PattyMurray @BobbyScott It’s been one year since hurricane María destroyed Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 Now you forget about fellow Puerto Ricans. You didn’t sign the letter requesting action from Trump. Guess what, no vote 🗳 for you #loser @RepGutierrez please learn how to pick your friends
@USRepMikeDoyle What a show you made when @RepGutierrez came to Pittsburgh a couple of years ago. Now you forget about fellow Puerto Ricans. You didn’t sign the letter requesting action from Trump. Guess what, no vote 🗳 for you #loser

@BlaqueIcedQuofi @GalimidiG @jack Because this isn’t the first time she acts like that. Also did it in 2009...She just behaves like an angry black woman! She has to stop that behavior. Otherwise, her daughter will behave the same way!
@ReignOfApril @jasiri_x Sorry but this is repeated behavior. She did it back in 2009!! She needs to give an apology to the referee and Osaka. She’s a blatant idiot!
