@FiveThirtyEight @jodyavirgan Trump re-election question, assuming this weekend doesn’t change everything. @PBS had this poll - what is the precedent for 57% “won’t vote” percentage? https://t.co/sbqkYq8p3G
@ruth_travels confirm or deny, you have offered cash for stories
Dumbest statement of the day contender #government category https://t.co/JQCrrtKukF

RT @NateSilver538: Why not Sean Hannity for chief of staff? @realDonaldTrump
If you want a new way to bang your head against the wall, create a @FedEx online account thinking it will help anything related to receiving packages. It does not.
This. Is freakin hysterical. An investigation that searches for crime?? Oh the inhumanity! What fools would create such a system? What could be their goal here?? https://t.co/YrQRrI732p
Hey @Ask_Spectrum why is your internet around NY complete shit? Turns out having a login does nothing when the connection falls apart every 20 minutes.
Dude. Shut up. https://t.co/G2h0cnJbqT
I do love me some pre-election poll aggregation though. https://t.co/OzBte9vAOC
Oh yeah, it’s been a couple years. I forgot about that whole process of precincts reporting. I thought the industry used both. https://t.co/Lvpmbcfl7V
And mothers will die in illegal abortions, and who gives a shit about what happens after a baby is born anyway? Not @SteveKingIA that’s for sure https://t.co/Fs7Cx8wGWd
Exit polls are how the industry calls elections. As you appear to be a member of the press I’m curious what the reasoning is here (actually curious, not trying to troll) https://t.co/CSPZOG2BFs
Gotta reply to this so I can find it easily when I wonder what the stupidest thing I heard in November was. Yes, original intent is a stupid way to interpret the constitution. https://t.co/Et3DsA2dxf
Whatevs happened to that deficit? Fiscal responsibility fixed it, right? https://t.co/fAfL060n2r
RT @NMJHill: @RepPeteKing How did you feel about the president demeaning John McCain? Feel free to remind us all by retweeting what you sai…
That’s why I’m proud @RepPeteKing refused to support @realDonaldTrump ...oh wait. Crap. @RepPeteKing is openly trolling his own constituents by pretending he gives a flying fuck about insulting veterans. https://t.co/FfcJTyla7A
Yeah, insulting the troops should automatically lose you the support of True Americans. That’s why he doesn’t support @realDonaldTrump and demanded...oh wait. He’s just trolling you. Whoops. I’ll leave https://t.co/NvdLonQjr5
RT @sharon2go: @RepPeteKing Have you condemned this?	https://t.co/0mttNpYgpa
Don’t you have something better to do than comment on SNL skits? Like run the county? No? Really? There aren’t a thousand other things on your list in front of this? https://t.co/O9LzLkUNgL
But remember folks, for everything @realDonaldTrump says, he actually means the opposite! #ElectionDay https://t.co/N9RE7ZILcg

Wired connection, internet works, every other app uses internet. @hulu says there is no internet connection, FAQ/help pages point the finger at the modem and router that are functioning perfectly using my wired connection to the tv. Useless POS app. @hulu_support

How probable cause* works
@LindseyGrahamSC accidentally explains why women stay silent while trying to defend how probable works. I call it “Makes ass of self part 7,362.”	#KavanaughFord #KavanaghHearings
@LindseyGrahamSC on Ford’s claim: “It’s a bunch of garbage.” No, you’re a bunch of garbage. This isn’t a court of law, you ass.
The best is the line from police. “Guess it’s guilty until proven innocent now.” Harharharhar. Your job is literally to conduct investigations based on a presumption of guilt. It’s the court that presumes innocence.
I still don’t get it. Is there not some other right-wing-will-overturn #RoeVWade will-prioritize-business-over-citizens candidate who won’t be accused of sexual assault? Or do they all have the sexual assault skeleton in their closet? #KavanaghHearing
There are thousands of qualified SC justices. Okay hundreds. Fine, maybe a few dozen. So what is such a big deal about moving on to the next one? #Kavanagh #SCOTUS
Not supporting an FBI investigation into a sexual assault case involving a candidate is not about the truth, it’s about pushing the candidate through no matter what.  See how that works? https://t.co/4oHcYBcDY3

Only @realDonaldTrump can double fist pump a memorial service and not have every conservative up in arms. Or is it that only Obama could never do a thing right? https://t.co/iZno60hnrn

Ted Cruz twitter strategy: cut the video of an opponent off mid-thought at a convenient point for you and hope no one notices. Be an adult and post the whole response. https://t.co/wrqrWt9HZs
Rep Massie, So you just implied not paying interns might be a crime, noting that Dems do it more than Repubs, but you can understand both sides and both are okay? Instructions confusing, please advise. https://t.co/5plLRhxNsO
