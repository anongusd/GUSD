He sat there, unsure why he was at Church on a Friday night, blissfully unaware of the horrors that other kids his age were facing only a couple miles away. It made me so incredibly sad and made me think about how this horrific policy would forever affect kids just like this one.
For the first half of the service I was sitting next to a little boy, who couldn't have been older than 4. He was obviously bored and restless and was complaining to his mom in Spanish. And it hit me, this kid was the reason we were all here.
It was beautiful. Each of the speakers spoke about the horrors about the policies, the importance of migrants, and how their faith celebrates migrants. Now I'm not religious so I can't give their words the proper justice, but that's not the point of this story.
What I didn't know at the time was that it was a protest hosted by an interfaith coalition in El Paso. So the protest and march ended up at a church where there were prayers held in multiple religions and testimony of immigrants.
Now to preface this, I didn't know I was going to be going to church. My step grandmother told me there was going to be a march to protest the current immigration policies and I told her I wanted to go.
Last night I did something I hadn't done in years... I went to church: A thread
