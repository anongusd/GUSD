If Congressional hearings permitted only certified truth tellers, there wouldn't be any. Congress' job is to hear as much relevant testimony as possible and be skeptical of all of it. Events requiring investigation are often witnessed by imperfect people. #CohenTestimony
@AOC Corporations should pay more taxes but corporations that are reinvesting nearly all of their profits can and should be able to defer taxes. Unfortunately non of Amazon's  reinvestments will be going to Queens or Long Island.
Currently a citizen of Mexico without a valid U.S. visa can walk into the United States for only about $200. How will that cost change with a wall? #budget #trump #wall https://t.co/5XC57gLmfU

Ending the shutdown on the wrong terms could make shutdowns far more frequent. I thought you might be interested in this column just posted on my new website called “Better Choices” #shutdown 	https://t.co/CKqfW2pQmp
Many more lives are put a risk by the shutdown than could possibly be saved by a border wall. Here is an explanation of why: https://t.co/Pkli9sRNLU #ShutDown #Wall
Shutdown places more lives at risk than wall could save: https://t.co/f5R4q4dGqe #shutdown
Here is a very good, concise statement about the "Wall" and its relationship to illegal immigration, terrorism, crime and drug traffic: https://t.co/qGuzECsUVJ
The "Wall" is so important that it requires we not only shut down the government but repeal Article I of the Constitution! We will soon know whether there are any Rs who take their oath to uphold seriously.
@shoupshouts Excellent! &amp; congrats
@AJentleson You nailed it!

Most of my Republican friends have had one political narrative running through head their entire lives. They were Winston Churchill and their opponents were Neville Chamberlin. Now we have an R that is actually behaving like Winston	https://t.co/rlSxohRc6e
@NormOrnstein That is what I thought he was up to when he announced he would veto the deal he had initially agreed to. I never dreamed he would really shut much of the government down to get there. He still has the capacity to surprise me.
RT @thehill: WATCH: CNN's Don Lemon airs 2013 clip of Trump saying Obama should be "fired" over shutdown https://t.co/QoZR9cespV https://t.…
@uzmaaaqib @ABC No, the cost of government has increased as a result of past shutdowns.
@NormOrnstein @soledadobrien Perhaps it is more accurate to say that he lies easily but not necessarily well. Lying well requires that most people believe you for at least a short period.
In 38 yrs since Civiletti we had a budget impasse in 36.  But in 34 (94%) we had no serious shutdown. We recognized taking gov. hostage is not way to win spending fights. Ransom to reopen government would be bad precedent. It has never happened. It would never stop  #Shutdown
Shut down impact to grow as time passes https://t.co/J7N1vRNmAx
We have a long-standing formula that allows government to operate while disputes are worked out.  As long as everyone appreciates the stupidity of a shutdown and works within the framework of that formula, shutdowns don't happen. https://t.co/txgM81BnGn https://t.co/u1AIZe4ZUD
The House has adopted a rule to allow amendment to continuing to include funding for the Wall in the CR. All Rs voted for rule not necessarily all will vote for the wall. Senate will clearly reject. House is burning up hours with few hours left.
@CillizzaCNN I don't think they are doing the Wall. They are doing "legitimate concerns about border security"
Band Aid Wall? Is budget blow up real? Why did Ryan-McCarthy say "legitimate concerns for border security" instead of "Wall"? House did not have votes for wall money this morning and does not now.. Looks like pretend victory to cover up a capitulation. #Shutdown
@NormOrnstein The only legislation Ryan was able to enact before becoming Speaker was a tax break for bow and arrow manufacturers.
@jonathanweisman @NormOrnstein @RepThomasMassie The smell of jet fuel is always the most powerful force in Congress. That doesn't excuse members from doing what is right. Allowing Yemeni children to starve so you can celebrate the birth of Christ doesn't strike me as particularly Christian.
Stopping this catastrophic abdication in Syria requires 20 Republican Senators (20 Rs + 47 Ds = 67) to put their foot down. This policy can be reversed before the Senate adjourns if only 38% of Senate Republicans say NO! #SyriaWithdrawal
@JRubinBlogger @NormOrnstein Ultimately, Americans are also betrayed for precisely the reason you state!
@Ocasio2018 AOC faces a problem with both math and civics. Unlike our returning speaker she can't count. She has never considered which policies that can win 218 votes and appears oblivious to the necessity. She has no power and won't until she humbles herself to learn the basics.

Perhaps the real explanation for the capitulation on  the wall is the optics of playing golf in Mar a Lago during a shutdown. Priorities are important. #GovernmentShutdown #Immigration
Tough guy Trump wimps out on shutdown. Chooses to sign a 2 month CR claiming he found the Wall money in his back pocket  rather than take on all 5'5" of Nancy Pelosi. What a fraud! @FederalShutdown
