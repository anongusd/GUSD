The notion that certain rights are guaranteed to citizens is being proven false every day. For Ex, you have the 1st Amendment right to film police officers and other public officials, but it often takes an official policy change (prompted by lawsuits) that right is respected.
Invoke your Fifth Amendment rights and the government assumes you've committed a crime. Invoke your First Amendment right to record police officers and you're told that you're "obstructing" an investigation or creating a public disturbance.
You have rights as an American citizen. They just won't be respected by default. Invoke your 4th Amendment rights to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures and the government assumes you have something to hide.

After the New Deal in the 1930's, a large middle class took shape and the share going to those at the top dropped sharply. By 1976, the top 1% took home only 9% of the national annual income. We #Americans, need to get our economy back to where it's fair and middle american is OK
The top 1% and the top 10% of earners accounted for a growing share of the national income. By 1928, nearly 1/4 of the total annual income went to the top 1% of earners; the top 10% took home 46% of the total annual income.
#Americans have fallen into diverse #economic groups throughout #American history. For much of American history most people were relatively poor working people, many of them farmers. A small wealthy elite, however, grew larger in the 1890s, in a period called "The Gilded Age."

History: "Americans have fallen into diverse economic groups throught American history. For much of American history most people were relatively poor working people, many of them farmers. A small wealthy elite, however, grew larger in the 1890's a period called the "gilded age""
"Similarly, in the early 20th century, upper middle class Progressives advocated women's suffrage because they believed that women were likely to support the reforms espoused by the Progressivve movement."
"The gradual expansion of voting rights by groups hoping to derive some political advantage has been typical of American history. After the Civil War, Republicans moved to enfranchise newly feed slaves  to use the support to maintain  control over the defeated Southern States."
Generally speaking, a gov't is needed to provide those services, sometimes called "public goods, that all citizens need but are not likely to be able to provide adequately for themselve." Well why shouldn't healthcare and education be included in that? These fit in that category.
"Americans have always harbored some suspicion of government and have wondered how extensive a role it should play in their lives. Thomas Jefferson famously observed that the best goernment was on that "Governed least." "
We are no longer the "United States of America". People only care about themselves. They don't care about the well-being of others; that's blatantly clear. @realDonaldTrump #Healthcare #politics #HumanityisLost we need to get back to our morals and values. #Americastrong

Political knowledge means more than having a few opinions to offer a pollster or to guide your decisions in a voting booth. It is important to know the rules and strategies that govern political institutions and the principles on which they are based and know how they relate to u
Not every effort of ordinary citizens to influence gov't will succeed, but w/o such efforts, gov't decisions will be made by a smaller and smaller circle of powerful people. Such loss of broad popular influence over gov't actions undermines the key feature of american democracy.
The widely felt loss of political efficacy is bad new for American Democracy. The feeling that you can't affect gov't decisions can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of apathy, declining political participation, and withdrawal from political life.
The gov't also regulates a wide range of social and commercial activites. As much as ppl want limited gov't, much of what citizens have come to depend on and take for granted as somehow part oth the natural environment is in fact crated by government.
Today the national gov't is an enormous institution with programs and policies reaching into every corner of American Life. It oversees the nation's economy, is the nation's largest employer, provides citizens with  host of services, &amp; controls the worlds most formidable military
Since the US was established as a nation, Americans have been recluctant to grant gov't 2 much power, and they have often been suspicious of politicians. But over the course of the nation's history,Americans have also turned to gov't for assistance in times of need and pds of war

@BernieSanders If You're Not Elected president in 2020 then I know for sure it's rigged.
And by the way do I like guns? no. Do I own a gun? No. But I would sure as hell use one, and fire one, if I needed to. And yes I have taken classes for those reasons.
Because this cannot continue to happen and we need to put a stop to it someway somehow but we need to figure it out and we need to talk about it and lawmakers need to come up with a solution that will protect innocent American people and especially innocent children and animals.
Innocent people because of underlying issues that have not been addressed. We need to figure things out collectively and soon.
I've been doing a lot of thinking on my stance with guns. If our country was getting attacked you'd be damn sure I would want the biggest baddest gun I could get.the question is how do we keep guns from people who are not responsible and how do we help people from wanting to kill
