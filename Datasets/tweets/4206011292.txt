@SelfPub101 @BallardPwr Fuel cells and electric cars should take precedence over self driving. Using renewable energy sources in our public and private transportation will make us carbon-negative in the short term, which may be how we stop climate change.
@SelfPub101 @BallardPwr Only good thing about self driving cars is they can make traveling safer. #Renewables are the safer alternative to Fossil fuels that poison our air and water. Both are most effective when everyone can use them. I believe that will happen as we keep developing green energy tech.
@50linesonly @AdrBell @nastiestwoman @Pie_SocialMedia I believe in Adrienne because she understands the importance of our shared causes of expanding civil rights to include healthcare for all, equality for LBGTQ folks, the #FightFor15, and the vital work of reforming our criminal justice system.

@realDonaldTrump @dcsheriff Trump's covering his ass. He knows he's gonna get heat for this, and he has to act as Presidential as possible before Mueller's hammer drops.
