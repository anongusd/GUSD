@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed May I ask you a question, genuinely? If the Times and all other news outlets stopped mentioning candidates' gender and race tomorrow, do you think voters would make their choices without gender or racial bias?
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed While I'm open to the argument that there are articles in which we've mentioned gender/race and shouldn't have, I absolutely do not agree that mentioning it period, in any article, is wrong. I think it's ESSENTIAL to discuss the fact that sexism continues to effect our politics.
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed We'll have to agree to disagree here. Yes, women and people of color should have their policies discussed and evaluated apart from their gender, which is exactly what we've done in the pieces I shared with you the other day. However‚Äî 1/
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed White male leadership has always been our norm, the default, the assumption unless otherwise specified. It shouldn't be that way and I would dearly love to live in a country where women and people of color running for president is unremarkable. But that's not this country yet. 5/
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed But I most definitely don't believe that discussing gender, or pointing out the sexism that continues to affect campaigns, is inherently bad. It just requires thoughtful consideration to strike the right tone and balance. 4/
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed Now‚Äîis it possible to focus too much on gender, to an extent that it reinforces the hurdles instead of challenging them? Absolutely, and I think it's important to be mindful of how much coverage you're doing and how it's framed. 3/
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed Since my article ran, I've received a flood of emails from people talking about the value of identifying their own implicit biases. People like the woman I quoted in the article, who came to the realization in '16 that she didn't have a reason for not liking Clinton. 2/
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed I understand your point, but I don't agree that the coverage of sexism/racism is a guise or that it creates the hurdles it discusses. Bias affects voter behavior whether we talk about it or not. Unconscious bias is very real, and I see value in calling attention to it. 1/

@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed And I would expect that the ratio, whatever it currently is, will shift more toward issues-based stories as the race continues and the candidates' platforms are more fully fleshed-out and elaborated on. This isn't to say the current ratio doesn't matter! Just something to note.
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed I would also note it's very early in the election cycle, so we're still in the process of digging into all the candidates' records and platforms, and of course, they haven't all rolled out their full platforms yet. There are several in-depth issues-based stories in the works 1/
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed I haven't been keeping systematic track, so to be honest, I can't say whether your count is right or wrong. I'll certainly keep a closer eye.
@LHFranz1 @jmartNYT @abbygoodnough @PatcohenNYT @kzernike I absolutely do appreciate the concern, and my colleagues and I are always thinking about and discussing the right balance of coverage ‚Äî and examining what we've done right and wrong in the past.

@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed But the idea that we constantly call attention to female candidates' gender to the exclusion of covering their policies is just not true. 9/end
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed I don't and never would claim our coverage is without fault. Like I said, we don't always get it right, though we do always try to improve. We've certainly emphasized the historic nature of having so many women run for 2020, and discussed the challenges they're likely to face. 8/
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed These are literally just the ones I remembered off the top of my head or was able to find by quickly scanning the politics page on the NYT website. It's a very small sampling of the work we've published recently. 7/
@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed Here's a long, in-depth article from today about Kamala Harris's prosecutorial record.

@naomirwolf @nytimes @CherylStrayed We at the Times absolutely play a role in framing the public conversation, and we don't always get it right, but it's demonstrably false to claim we never cover female politicians' agendas without calling attention to their gender. Here are a few recent examples. 1/
@WriterNancyJane @nytimes I'm glad you appreciated the article. For what it's worth, I am a reporter covering the election. :)

@LHFranz1 @jmartNYT @abbygoodnough @PatcohenNYT @kzernike That's a small sampling, and many more articles are in the works ‚Äî about the Green New Deal, about immigration, and so on. Again, this isn't an either/or proposition. We're covering the issues. We're also reporting on sexism and racism because, sadly, they DO affect elections.
@LHFranz1 @jmartNYT @abbygoodnough @PatcohenNYT An extremely thorough article by @kzernike about Kamala Harris's prosecutorial record and criminal justice policies: https://t.co/CJiCjy96MA

@LHFranz1 Here's a piece by @jmartNYT and @abbygoodnough about Medicare for All/health care: https://t.co/JvJm1evIUK
@LHFranz1 My colleagues and I *have* been covering candidate stands on important issues, and we will continue to. I'll post some examples in a thread here. But sexism and double standards are ALSO important to discuss. It's not either/or.
@countrymousejen Sorry, one more: Put another way, a double standard can mean that women are criticized for normal behavior and men aren't, and I think people often assume that's what it means. But it can ALSO mean that men are excused for bad behavior and women aren't. 4/end (really this time)
@countrymousejen I'd argue mistreatment of employees is something both men &amp; women should be criticized for. But if men AREN'T criticized as much, that's a double standard. "There's a double standard" doesn't mean women should be excused‚Äîit just means men aren't being treated similarly. 3/end
@countrymousejen More broadly, I think this is a crucial point: When a woman is criticized for something that a man isn't criticized for, there are two possibilities. It could be that neither should be criticized for that thing, or it could be that both should be criticized for that thing. 2/
@countrymousejen I don't think the article dismisses criticism of Klobuchar as sexist. It notes the criticism and says, "Whether she is held to a different standard than men remains to be seen" ‚Äî in other words, it's NOT clear at this point whether the criticism is driven by sexism. 1/

@doodley27 @TweeterMoses @maggieNYT Yes. Susan's right. Elite is the official name of a category within USA Gymnastics. When I say Ohashi isn't an elite gymnast anymore, I mean she is no longer in USA Gymnastics' official elite program. I don't mean she isn't a high-quality gymnast. https://t.co/FDNgNxNsUR

@TweeterMoses @maggieNYT (I should clarify here that the routines in NCAA gymnastics are still REALLY DIFFICULT. They're just not as insanely, potentially body-destroyingly difficult as elite routines.)
@TweeterMoses @maggieNYT And that's why I wanted to scream at all the commenters on various tweets who were like, "Our next Olympic champion!!!" NO. That joy you see is BECAUSE she's in NCAA, not elite anymore. It's a different world‚Äîhalf as many training hours, shorter and less crazy-difficult routines.
@TweeterMoses @maggieNYT Absolutely. That's actually one of the differences between NCAA and elite (elite being national teams, world champs, Olympics, etc). NCAA is often where gymnasts who were beaten down physically and emotionally by elite gymnastics can regain their love for the sport, healthily.
100% serious. Email is in my bio. Don't know what that flip is called? Don't know how NCAA gymnastics differs from Olympic gymnastics and why it's wrong to marvel "omg she should go to the Olympics"? Email! Because my forehead hurts from slamming it into my desk. 		Carry on. 2/2

@JDeMolee @CampaignLegal The set-aside ballots get counted if the voter returns with proper ID within a certain amount of time after Election Day. The idea here, though, is that‚Äîif tribes/advocates choose to go this route‚Äîthey would sue to force the state to count the set-aside ballots without the ID.
@JDeMolee @CampaignLegal The option was added to the voter ID law last year.
@MarkHertling That may well be true. I'm sure you can understand, however, why that would not be particularly reassuring to people who are concerned about it, well, happening. If troops start shooting migrants, punishing the perpetrator(s) won't undo the humanitarian catastrophe.
@MarkHertling Only 1 My Lai perpetrator was convicted. 11 soldiers were convicted for Abu Ghraib; most received minor sentences. And none of this actually relates to my point, since you didn't say "the perpetrators would be punished if it happened"; you said no leader would allow it to happen.
Okay, look.		Abu Ghraib was against the rules. My Lai was against the rules. The military is fully capable of violating the rules. 		This doesn't mean they WILL. But the notion that there's no way it would ever happen is ridiculous. https://t.co/qRehB4Si4j

@lemeeps I'm not. It was an irritable response to the literal flood of such arguments filling my timeline.
I honestly just moved to a different subway car because the woman next to me was sniffling and I CANNOT get sick with the elections five days away. Now I'm sitting next to a man who answered his phone by snapping "No" and then hung up.
And now that we know, we get to have the classic gymnastics debate: SHOULD someone be able to win with two falls because their gymnastics is so much harder than everyone else's?
We always said "Simone could win even with two falls," but it was always theoretical because she's Simone and she didn't fall. Well, now we know. https://t.co/qJLPcNjMpQ

This is crucial not just for the obvious reason (people need to know where to vote!), but also because the whole emergency addressing plan Four Directions and the tribes have developed depends on knowing the precinct lines. From my article: https://t.co/ZSJ1HA4pKz https://t.co/0WrNPasnfE

@jdmuccigrosso Four Directions is one of the primary organizations working with the tribes.
@madho Four Directions is a nonpartisan organization working directly with all of North Dakota's tribes on this.
"We do not comment on pending litigation," Secretary of State Al Jaeger said.
@jgobble @srl @EmmaCottNYT @SenatorHeitkamp I'm not aware of any such funding, and it could be legally tricky. I'm not a campaign finance expert, so I'm not able to speak to the larger questions here, but I do know that nonprofits like Four Directions are nonpartisan and don't work directly with candidates.
@Indigenia I think that must have been someone else, sorry! I was at the Heitkamp rally in Fort Yates, but not the one in New Town.
I've reached out to the secretary of state's office for comment and will update when I hear back. 		In the meantime, if you're just dropping in, here's my article one more time. https://t.co/ZSJ1HA4pKz
The suit's demands are:	1. judgment that the address req violates 1 &amp; 14 amendments	2. block enforcement of the law w/r/t the categories of ppl described in the suit, or at least let affected voters confirm their eligibility by identifying their home on precinct map	3. legal fees
"There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in	electing our political leaders." In McCutcheon, that quote justified lifting the challenged contribution limit. It's being used to much different effect here.
Suit alleges violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Cites McCutcheon v FEC, which is actually extremely amusing in a trolly sort of way because McCutcheon is a conservative darling SCOTUS decision that struck down some limits on campaign contributions.
"The state may not condition the right to vote upon a Native American voter‚Äôs access to a category of information only the government can provide and which the government has made difficult or functionally impossible to obtain" https://t.co/DqX9WL7iWA
As noted in my article, re: the 911 coordinator in Sioux County being the sheriff. https://t.co/OcLbVfzyZE
Note that Turtle Mountain is the reservation I mentioned in my article whose machine overheated and started melting ID cards because they were printing so many. The machine has been replaced; this is just to emphasize how big "the whole burden" is. https://t.co/ZSJ1HA4pKz
The DMV in Rolette County (where Turtle Mountain is) hasn't been &amp; won't be open at any point between the SCOTUS decision and the election, suit says. So either the people who need a new ID have to drive over 150 miles, or the tribe has to assume the whole burden of printing IDs. https://t.co/opFRad2sL0
This is extraordinary. A member of the Spirit Lake tribe went through the exact system the state has proffered, got an address from the 911 coordinator, and then had her absentee ballot application rejected because the address ASSIGNED BY THE 911 COORDINATOR was deemed invalid. https://t.co/pv4cDZjoTU
Pages 28-29 show how many roads on the Fort Berthold Reservation ‚Äî home to the MHA Nation (Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara), aka the Three Affiliated Tribes ‚Äî are unnamed in the state's system. https://t.co/5siU7CbCvT
I wrote in my article that Robin Smith, Spirit Lake's enrollment director, had been glued to her seat all morning because of how many people needed IDs. When I was there, she said she'd issued 25 the day before, 39 that morning, and 15 so far that afternoon. One week later: https://t.co/NlXU4B8Cuq
I'm back, and here is the anecdote I mentioned earlier from Douglas Yankton, whose ID lists the same street address as his girlfriend's but a different city. The kicker: The state's database doesn't recognize either address. https://t.co/txSk23MX8l
There will be a five-minute intermission while I get caffeine and uncross my eyes.
It's clear that county 911 coordinators, who are responsible for assigning these now-essential addresses, are often unavailable to do so. And, as many tribal officials said to me, there's only so many times a person is going to try calling or visiting before they give up.
North Dakota officials have characterized the process of obtaining an address as quick and easy. It was clear when I was there that this is often untrue. The groups behind the lawsuit found the same. See pages 21-24. https://t.co/5siU7CbCvT
Voters whose ID shows the residential address they have always known "have no reason to suspect that their ID may be insufficient for voting because the county has, unbeknownst to them, assigned them a different address in the 911 system" https://t.co/mBB2CLHqJ1
And here's the crux of the issue. 		Note that rejected voters can fill out a provisional ballot, BUT it'll only be counted if they provide the required document(s) within a week after the elex. And auditors' offices are closed for 3 days of that period for Veterans Day weekend. https://t.co/vP6I3a7xwM
Last plaintiff is Terry Yellow Fat, whom I mentioned briefly in my article. His county's 911 coordinator ‚Äî who is also the sheriff ‚Äî issued him the address of a bar/liquor store near his house. Details on pages 15-16 in the PDF. https://t.co/5siU7CbCvT
The next plaintiff, Kim Twinn, lives on the Standing Rock reservation but, because of an unlucky confluence of circumstances, can't get an ID showing her address. https://t.co/7UbTAlrVHZ
Two other plaintiffs, Leslie and Clark Peltier of the Turtle Mountain tribe, also discovered a discrepancy between (1) the address given to them in 2012 by a county official and subsequently printed on their IDs and (2) the address listed for their home in the 911 database.
@oliverbabish63 @NDNrights @CampaignLegal Certainly it's possible. Courts can act fast in response to emergency applications like this. But I can't say whether it's "likely."
"On the North Dakota GIS Hub Explorer, an official tool previously cited by	Defendant Jaeger as an authoritative source for 911 addresses, Mr. Jackson‚Äôs street is marked as 'Unknown2.'" (Jaeger = Al Jaeger, ND's secretary of state.) https://t.co/3GUur9JLhl
This is an address listed on an ID card *issued by the state of North Dakota.*
First named plaintiff is Dion Jackson, 34, of the Spirit Lake Tribe. He actually has a residential address on his ID and has received packages at that address, but the state said the address wasn't valid and rejected his absentee ballot application. https://t.co/dAfh3p5D8i
This is interesting. Fits with what I heard last week from Douglas Yankton, vice chair of Spirit Lake tribal council. He and his girlfriend have IDs showing the same street address, but his says Oberon and hers says Fort Totten bc that's what the 911 coordinator told each of them https://t.co/uX7dOJZ6bT
Suit emphasizes, as I noted in my article, the costs the tribes are incurring. Spirit Lake Tribe normally charges $11 per ID but is currently giving them out for free. It has also spent resources publicizing the new requirement and has gotten no financial help from the state.
@oliverbabish63 @NDNrights @CampaignLegal Impossible to answer that question at such an early stage.
Suit notes that Eighth Circuit ruling allowing the law to take effect (later upheld by SCOTUS) contained an invitation: if any resident was in fact unable to vote because of the requirement, "the courthouse doors remain open." Suit says that has now happened with absentee ballots https://t.co/RnR3AEwiWp

@ChickswKnives @alexmiz That's the tribes' goal! They're hoping they can get everyone the ID they need, and that people will use their anger as motivation to vote. But it's impossible to say what the actual outcome will be. And it's costing the tribes a hell of a lot of money and resources to do it.

@ikesimburger @isthisdubstep Many do. Some don't. That's openly acknowledged by the North Dakota government, which told the tribes in writing that members without addresses could call their county 911 coordinator, describe the location of their home and have an address assigned. It's not a matter of dispute.

@brianallen79 @IMapatriot4ever @SusanDFinSD @verawagman @MaryFusillo They've never needed to. People who live on the reservations know where things are. Give me one minute; I want to dig a quote out of my notes about this.
@ikesimburger @isthisdubstep You seem to be implying that it's insulting to the tribes to say they don't use addresses. It's not. Addresses are not some essential hallmark of civilization. The reservations have chosen for years not to use them because they didn't need them.
@ikesimburger @isthisdubstep And now, right on the verge of the election, tribes are being forced to either assign or find these addresses and issue corresponding identification for a huge number of people in an extremely short period of time.
@ikesimburger @isthisdubstep Nobody is saying the tribes "can't" address their buildings. The point is that they don't use addresses and never have, even if the state has one on file.
@ikesimburger @isthisdubstep The tribes themselves have said many buildings lack addresses. State officials acknowledge it. Even on streets that have official names on maps, there's often no signage, houses don't have numbers, and people don't know their address because they've never in their life used it.
@Thesixler The tribes are working to assign addresses, yes, and to issue new tribal ID cards that show the newly assigned addresses. Doing that for a very large number of people in a very short amount of time is the central challenge here.
@Thesixler And I said they don't have addresses, "at least" not ones GPS can find -- meaning to my knowledge there are no addresses, but I'm acknowledging the hypothetical possibility that they exist and were unfindable.

@daciatakesnote @atachine My point is that my experience illustrates how widespread the lack of addresses is, and therefore how much of a burden the voter ID law is imposing on Native Americans. 2/
@daciatakesnote @atachine I'm very sorry if that's the impression I conveyed; it absolutely was not my point. My inability to find my way is not at all the problem here. I don't remotely think reservations ought to have addresses to accommodate me or anybody else. 1/

@scottdempwolf Actually laughed out loud.
@MacMargi Thanks! While the lack of addresses is common to reservations in many states, they won't have the same problem unless their state passes a law requiring residential addresses to vote.
@mbeavenhausen The North Dakota Legislature passed the residential address requirement in 2013. The courts blocked it for several years, but this month the Supreme Court allowed it to take effect.
@SPSJoe There's some of both. But even the streets are often unnamed, and the houses often don't have numbers.

@kmerkle I'm not sure, but the biggest problem now is not finding an addressing method ‚Äî the tribes have already figured that out. The problem is processing the new address and a new ID for so many people in such a short period of time.
@ikesimburger @isthisdubstep Who said Google was conspiring with anyone? Google isn't responsible for the lack of addresses; it just can't find the buildings *because* they don't have addresses. It's extremely common for buildings on reservations to have no addresses. Many streets don't even have names.
@CarolynRodham @blahsi That is one of the options the tribes are considering.
@Ironmelter8540 @EdGaffney2 I don't have a confirmed number for the limit, sorry. Re: high-rises, people in them are distinguished by apartment/suite number. If everyone in the tribe had the same base address, each home would still need a unique number or other distinguishing add-on to that address.
@redgrow The original law was passed in 2013 but has been blocked by the courts since then. Just this month, the Supreme Court allowed it to take effect.
@ikesimburger I have Sprint.
@projectvincent1 I'm not sure how they would go about it. They are definitely another group affected by this law.
@jlepine59 They can use tribal IDs, yes, but the ID has to have their residential address on it, which is the problem.
@EdGaffney2 At least one state official told a tribal leader that there was a limit to how many people could share the same address.
@MKruempel Probably early next week.
@GrumpiGramp County 911 coordinators are definitely providing some of the affected people with addresses, but the voters have to call and request it.
@kathleenshopper @ddale8 I'm not sure what you mean by legal land descriptions, but the ND law requires an actual, standard address.
@lisawilkins They use PO boxes.
@Hybrid_Coydog I explicitly said, if you read to the end of my thread, that the tribes are issuing IDs. The point is that doing so for a huge number of people in a very short amount of time is requiring a massive and expensive program that most other North Dakotans don't have to undertake.
@LiberalFenix They have found other methods to use. They know at this point how they can best assign addresses. The problem is the sheer number they have to assign and provide new IDs for.
@selliso Yes, there are other affected groups, like college students and homeless people. It isn't exclusively affecting Native Americans, but it is disproportionately affecting them over other groups.
@blahsi Each tribe is printing IDs for its members, and there are a couple methods they and county officials are using to assign addresses. It's a massive effort and I'll explain it in more detail in my article, which I expect will run by early next week.
@kgmom219 I work for the New York Times. No Patreon -- I'm totally fine, but thanks for asking. Lots of freelance journalists doing amazing work need public support more than I do!
@lauramariani @SalinaGrowsTall @4directionsvote Yep, 4 Directions is working directly with all of North Dakota's tribes.
@MaryFusillo Good question. 4 Directions, a nonpartisan Native voting rights org working with all of ND's tribes, can tell you what would be most helpful if you contact them. There are other orgs too, but 4D is the only one I can definitively tell you is working directly with every tribe.
If you asked a question in response to my thread, I promise I will answer tonight. Right now I'm making a super-tight flight connection.
@keystonekabes None of that money has gone to the tribes, they told me. It's going to an organization, Western Native Voice, that is working separately in ways that many tribal officials I spoke with don't believe are helpful.
The sheer scope of the lack of addresses tells you what a huge task it is. It can be done‚Äîit's technically possible and the tribes are determined to make it happen‚Äîbut coupled with the very short amount of time before the elections, it is a BIG ask. 15/end
So yes, addresses can be assigned. County 911 coordinators can assign them. Tribal officials are assigning some too. One tribe printed so many IDs with newly assigned addresses that part of the ID machine literally melted. 14/
These are the biggest buildings in town, on a main street in the reservation's main city. Homes in remote parts of the reservations? Forget it. 13/
And this is the heart of the problem. Even TRIBAL HEADQUARTERS don't have addresses, at least not ones GPS can find. (Google maps, btw, said it had found the offices‚Äîunlike my physical GPS, which said it couldn't find them‚Äîbut it was wrong. It directed you somewhere else.) 12/
Surprise! GPS stopped at the city limits of Belcourt, ND. Rinse and repeat. 11/
GUESS WHAT HAPPENED AGAIN. 10/
Anyway. I got to the office. I got out of the car and yelled over to OJ, "Well, that was fun!" and we had a laugh about it. We went into the office, I did my interviews. And then it was time to go to Turtle Mountain Reservation, another hour-and-a-half drive. 9/
*Finally, not "finallyu" ‚Äî GIVE ME AN EDIT BUTTON, TWITTER
The amount of time that elapsed between him describing a car and me seeing it told us how many minutes away I was. I put my flashers on to identify my own car. And when he finallyu saw it, he told me to turn left. And there, up a hill, was the office. 8/
So here's what we did: I told OJ the lake was on my left, which told him which direction I was facing. And then he went to a spot where he could see the highway, and he described the cars I was going to see coming in the opposite direction. "Yellow flatbed truck." "Blue SUV." 7/
So I'm on the side of a remote two-lane highway, on the phone with OJ. He names landmarks GPS might be able to find. A hospital, a nearby office, etc. GPS can't find them‚Äîbecause none of them have addresses. They just are where they are, and tribe members know where they are. 6/
I pulled over. Fiddled with the GPS. Re-entered the tribal office. GPS couldn't find it. I had enough cell service then to make a call‚Äîvery lucky, because for most of my time in ND I didn't have that‚Äîso I called OJ Semans of Four Directions, who I was meeting at the office. 5/
I plugged in the Spirit Lake tribal office, which is in Fort Totten, ND. The GPS took me to the city limits of Fort Totten. And then it stopped. It told me I had reached my destination. I had not. I was in the middle of a highway with a lake on one side and fields on another. 4/
Yesterday morning I drove from the Fort Berthold Reservation to the Spirit Lake Reservation. It's around a 3- to 3.5-hour drive. I didn't have enough cell service to use Google maps, so I was using an actual physical GPS unit. 3/
Tribal officials are working extremely hard to make sure every member gets an address assigned and has the necessary ID. I'll be writing plenty about that in my article. But it's a huge, logistically hard task. And yesterday, the scope of the problem was driven home for me. 2/
Waiting for my flight in Bismarck, so it's story time. I've spent the past three days in North Dakota reporting on the voter ID law here, which requires residential addresses. Many Native Americans, especially those living on reservations, don't have residential addresses. 1/

@laurenbgoldman @kathykattenburg @KimTallBear There is no such secondary definition of "many" as an adjective, which is how it is used in the headline. "Many" is an absolutely standard way to refer to a large number of people, and I respectfully disagree that it is in any way misleading or subjective.
@laurenbgoldman @kathykattenburg @KimTallBear Per Merriam-Webster, "many" as an adjective has only one meaning, and that is "a large number." As a noun ‚Äî for example, "the many" ‚Äî it can mean a majority, but that's not how it's used in the headline. The headline accurately conveys that this criticism has been common.

@JeffreyTeixeira He's not Catholic. He's Protestant. Pentecostal, specifically.
One of the silliest rationalizations I've heard today is "she's short, so maybe his hand just happened to fall there." I'm short too, only an inch or so taller than Ariana Grande. Every male friend/coworker I have is much taller than me. None have ever accidentally groped me.
RT @SharonLeavy1: @MaggieAstor We've all done that lean. 		Which is scary.
@mrpford I didn't call her a victim, which is a loaded term. But I am sure of two things: The groping was wrong, and her body language screams discomfort. As you can see from the response to my initial tweet, a huge number of women know that feeling and recognized it in her demeanor.
For the record, because people have expressed confusion: No, "Google her and everyone is talking about her dress" isn't true anymore. If you Google her now, everyone is talking about the groping. I'm glad that's the case. It wasn't when I tweeted last night. https://t.co/niicGD0Rzk

@dmxatlxGF7 You're right, we're talking about him now. But few people were when I tweeted last night. I'm very glad that's changed in the past 24 hours.		And while her dress may have been inappropriate for a funeral, on the scale of transgressions, groping is way above inappropriate attire.
@Miss_h3llion It is now ‚Äî now that tens of thousands of people have started talking about it on Twitter. It wasn't when I tweeted last night.
@crazymay_ Why are you so convinced that he didn't "do anything with the ill intention to hurt her"? I'm sorry, but people don't grab a breast by accident, and they don't squeeze it out of God's love, and groping is not the way Jesus embraced.
Are you really arguing that "church folk" don't deliberately hurt people? Really? After thousands of sexual abuse cases in the Catholic Church alone? Pastors, priests and other religious men are completely capable of sexual assault. And no, it is not an act of love. Ever. https://t.co/b2oe4U0hBG

I think every woman can look at Ariana Grande's face and body language and viscerally feel what she's feeling. The tension. The nervous laughter. Not wanting to make a scene or make him angry.

Still Trent Jones: "On Wednesday in Grant Park, just before the ill-fated attempt at marching to the convention center, Dick Gregory took the mike. He told us that where he lived was on the other side of the center and that he was inviting us all to visit." 1/2
Trent Jones on Phil Ochs singing "I Declare the War Is Over": 	"Cheers erupted throughout it, cresting with the line 'Even treason may be worth a try' &amp;...'this country is too young to die.' I still have such a visceral recall of the combination of despair &amp; hope in that moment."

Source of the confusion: Simone is indeed the first to win five national titles *since USA Gymnastics was created in 1963.* Before that, American gymnastics had a different governing body and different national championships. More on that: https://t.co/j2EiLpRvJl
RT @Simone_Biles: I‚Äôve been back for only 9 months. I‚Äôm so proud of myself.
The above is a technicality, to be clear. Gymnastics was an enormously different sport in the 1940s and 50s, and gymnasts' careers tended to be significantly longer, so it's not actually meaningful to compare results between then and now.
This actually isn't true. Clara Schroth won six: 1945, 1946, 1949, 1950, 1951, and 1952. Simone is the second to do it, and the first in more than 65 years. (And it IS a far more impressive feat today because US gymnastics has wildly more depth today than it did then.) https://t.co/aDeId0TJAU
So watching her, you're watching‚Äîin real time‚Äîthe redefinition of what you thought were the limits of this sport you love. It is just an extraordinary thing. 5/5
She has already blown past the limits of what was physically possible for any other gymnast in history. But she *hasn't reached her own.* If you know gymnastics and you watch her technique, her sheer height/power on specific skills, you can see she's capable of adding more. 4/
So, as a gymnastics fan, you're not watching a competition. You're watching a single gymnast try to identify the limits of what is physically possible. 3/
What becomes apparent is that she is not and never will be competing against anyone else. The gap between her and her nearest competitor this week was equivalent to more than six falls. As in, she could have lost SIX FALLS worth of points and still won. 2/
You don't have to know anything about gymnastics to see that Simone Biles is extraordinary. Any layperson should be able to see that. But here's the thing about watching her when you know a lot about gymnastics. 1/

Secondary question: What genius at Apple decided 2% was a sensible number to notify people at? Tertiary question: What genius at Apple decided to put the charging port on the underside of the mouse so it can't lie flat when plugged in, thus rendering it useless while charging?
Anybody know how I can get my computer to tell me my Magic Mouse battery is low BEFORE it hits 2%, at which point it has like 20 minutes left and I have to spend my entire workday charging it instead of getting notified when it's at, say, 10% and being able to charge overnight?

@ZacharyLoeser It's a good question. Some of it is paranoia, but a lot really is genuine misunderstanding. The students definitely have stories of productive conversations where the protesters realized their beliefs were closer than they thought. For me, it's impossible to say based on 3 days.

Certainly, there are people who disagree with specific proposals the students have made. But what I saw on the tour was that a lot of the apparent disagreement isn't actually disagreement, but misunderstanding.
A protester also claimed the activists wanted to arm students with rocks and bats instead of "hardening the schools." But March for Our Lives never suggested that. It was officials in a couple school districts in Pennsylvania who suggested that.
In Greensboro, I spoke with a protester, Nancy Browning, who supports universal background checks, banning bump stocks, closing the gun show loophole, and more, but believes "they want to blame the guns and take away the guns." More on that in the article: https://t.co/hWwzr7usly
Often, even the counterprotesters supported many of the same things the students did, but they were angry because they believed incorrectly that the students wanted to "take away their guns." @MattxRed said he often found common ground with the protesters.
Majorities already support many parts of their platform. "The reason people say that we want to take guns away or want to abolish the 2nd Amendment," @mattlpost argued, "is because they cannot debate us on the grounds of universal background checks," which over 95% support.
Finally, they urged people to vote‚Äîthere were voter registration tables at every event‚Äîand to research candidates rather than voting automatically along party lines. "It will not make a difference if you just choose D or R," Lauren Hogg said in Blacksburg.
The students saw the tour as a beginning. At events, they urged supporters to talk to friends &amp; family about what they'd heard. After a stop, @Emma4Change said, ‚Äúif we don‚Äôt continue the conversation &amp; they don‚Äôt continue the conversation from there, we‚Äôve failed each other.‚Äù
In Milwaukee, @briaasmithh said, "I tried to make a difference, and I tried to be that person ‚Ä¶ but I was never, ever given that platform. I think that Road to Change and March for Our Lives in general being so inclusive has given me that platform."
.@davidhogg111 talked about "raising the voices" of local activists. "We don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like in East Oakland to live there, but the kids there do," he said, so the Parklanders give them resources "and let them take the wheel &amp; steer, because they know where they‚Äôre going."
"We just brainstorm together what we want to do, what we want to fill the day with, because it‚Äôs always their ideas," she said. "They know what‚Äôs best for their community. I always take their lead, and oftentimes they already know what to do, and so I just guide them along."
.@JaclynCorin, who worked pretty much 24/7 all summer to organize the tour, said planning each stop began with a call to local organizers, typically the people who organized the rally in that city in March. If she reached an adult, she always asked for a student contact.
"Intersectionality" and "inclusivity" are big words in this movement. The students have made a major point to a) include people of different races, religions, economic backgrounds, etc., and b) defer to local organizers' knowledge of their own communities.
@Joy_Resmovits And thank you! Photos by @gabriellaangojo
@Joy_Resmovits @benjamdub confirmed, signed, and notarized
Also @_RamonContreras: "Every shooting in our community should be treated like a mass shooting. ... When it happens in our communities every day, it‚Äôs not covered the same."
In Blacksburg, @_RamonContreras argued that when dozens are shot in one weekend in Chicago, the "gang violence" label minimizes the tragedy. People "like to refer to gang violence," he said, because "it keeps black and brown people in a place where people don't really care."
The causes they discuss are equally varied ‚Äî not just guns but also racism, poverty, lack of investment in schools, inadequate mental health services.
Let's talk more now about the scope of the issues the students are addressing. They are emphasizing that all gun violence is connected, whether it's a mass shooting or a gang dispute or suicide. For them, it's all part of the same problem and has to be confronted as such.

@TarTarGabor Me too!!! I still wear mine regularly.
I'm going to leave you with that for now. More to come later today.
Soon after the Parkland shooting, two @MFOLGreensboro members‚Äî@anniejoycahill2 and @camerongso, both 15‚Äîspent their entire lunch period talking about "what buildings were most likely to get us killed and which ones had escape routes that might save us," Cameron said at a rally.
I graduated high school in 2007. We knew school shootings happened‚ÄîI mean, it was years after Columbine. But I never thought to myself that I should try to sit on the side of the classroom nearest the closet, just in case. Louis Garcia, a rising junior in Roanoke, Va., does.
That was a big theme in my conversations with students. They are *always* aware that their school could be next. They actively think about what they would do if it were.
Talking specifically about mass shootings for a minute, you hear a lot these days about how "routine" they've become. Remember the girl at Santa Fe High School? "I've always kind of felt it like eventually it was going to happen here too"?
In the audience was Josh Gleason, 20, an engineering student from Connecticut. He said he used to feel helpless to do anything about shootings. But seeing high schoolers "going on national TV day in, day out... it made me realize that yeah, I can do something too."
"We have to be that voice" for others, she said. "2 months ago, if you were to have told me I would be on the Road to Change speaking for them, I would not have believed you, because I thought the color of my skin &amp; my ZIP code determined my progression &amp; my success as a person."
Then she spoke at the Milwaukee @AMarch4OurLives rally in March, and then on a panel when the @RoadToChange tour went there in June. And they asked her to join them for the rest of the tour. So she did.
Bria is 17 and going into her senior year of high school in Milwaukee. She has spent the past year working for local nonprofits and Black Lives Matter and talking about inner-city gun violence. But until this tour, she felt she had "no voice."
If one sentence sums up the movement the students are building, it's this from @briaasmithh at a panel discussion in Greensboro: "You can't have a conversation about gun violence if you only have mass shootings and white, affluent suburban high schools on your agenda."
There were so many moments and quotes I wasn't able to include in the story. So I'll tweet some of them today.
I spent three days with them in Greensboro, Blacksburg, and Charlottesville. Here's a look at the movement they and their local partners have built, and what makes it different from all the other efforts that faded. https://t.co/hWwzr7usly

Louder for the people in the back: MENTAL. ILLNESS. IS. NOT. A. CHARACTER. FLAW.
Yet we live in a society where many people do judge, and think differently of, and voyeuristically mock celebrities whose mental illnesses become visible. This is not benign. It discourages people‚Äîcelebrities and otherwise‚Äîfrom seeking help. It is a matter of life and death.
Mental health is not a moral accomplishment, and mental illness is not a character flaw.

It didn't quite turn out that way, with the Knights of Columbus declining to be involved. But Dave Goldsmith said the reception from the Catonsville community, as far as he had seen, had been positive.
DeBoy added: "We hoped that this official recognition of this landmark protest, after half a century, would provide an opportunity for reconciliation among the hawks and doves within the Catholic Church, and bring together the entire Catonsville community for a time of healing."
Dennis DeBoy summarized his pitch to the state government for me: "We know this event is still considered by many, even 50 years later, very controversial. But the fact remains this was a historical act. It had reverberations around the world."
The sign was approved and paid for by the @MdHistTrust and @MDSHA. One of the criteria for state-sponsored memorial signs in Maryland is that they are "associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history."
They wanted, of course, to put the sign at the site of the action. But the property now belongs to the Knights of Columbus, who wanted nothing to do with it. So the Catonsville Public Library, just across the street, agreed to host it.
Dave Goldsmith, who lives near Catonsville, requested the sign after hearing Frida Berrigan (Philip Berrigan's daughter) on @democracynow. Then Dennis DeBoy, of the Baltimore chapter of Veterans for Peace (named after Philip Berrigan) applied too, and he and Goldsmith connected.

One of the hard parts of journalism is having to condense huge documents of interviews and notes into 1,000 or so words, which means leaving so much interesting material out. Over the course of the day, I'll share a few quotes and tidbits that didn't make it into the article.
Today, only two of the nine ‚Äî Margarita (then Marjorie) Melville and George Mische ‚Äî are still alive. I talked to both of them.
Their protest, which came on the heels of the Baltimore Four pouring blood on draft files, inspired more than 250 similar protests from 1968-72 and played a major role in ending the draft.
50 years ago this week, the Catonsville Nine entered a draft board office in broad daylight and seized hundreds of files, then set them on fire in the parking lot with homemade napalm https://t.co/ReGiOarYIz

@felixsalmon @lizzieohreally Hi Lizzie and Felix. The methodology and age breakdown were in documents I got from the Claims Conference. The methodology is described in the 7th graf of the article, and the survey's definition of "millennial" is in the 2nd graf. Let me know if I can answer any other Qs!
@SHCirlin @nytimes Fair point. To expand, though, only 1 percent of respondents said they didn't believe it happened. The other 3 percent were listed as "not sure." 		That is, of course, still too many.
@MN_poppy No, there was no regional breakdown, sorry!
@dfb8084 @obrien @palafo @ZAZ49 @nytimes Of course his later actions wildly violated democracy, to give the understatement of the century. But he *originally* came to power through legal means.
@obrien @palafo @ZAZ49 The statistic is from a full document of the results that I received in reporting the story. The links posted online are essentially highlights of the study, not the entire thing.
@obrien @palafo @dfb8084 @ZAZ49 @nytimes I acknowledge that "democratically elected" can be interpreted as "directly elected." That's why we revised the sentence. But he came to power through the democratic process, which is the point of the survey question and has been my point today.
@obrien @palafo @dfb8084 @ZAZ49 @nytimes I never said it was an "automatic appointment." I said it was a product of the coalition talks that take place when no party receives an outright majority in a parliamentary system. Those coalition talks and political choices are part of parliamentary democracy. 1/
@obrien @palafo @dfb8084 @ZAZ49 @nytimes I don't agree that the sentence as originally written was factually inaccurate. I believe that it was an absolute statement about an event that was extremely complex, and nuance is important, hence the update.
@obrien @palafo @dfb8084 @ZAZ49 @nytimes Now, you may argue that "part of the democratic process in Germany" is not the same as "democratically elected." That's a valid argument, and it's why we've updated the sentence in question in the article. 2/

@dfb8084 @obrien @ZAZ49 You can't compare a presidential system (as in the US) to a parliamentary system (as in Germany). They are different systems. The leaders of parliamentary systems‚Äîprime ministers or, in Germany, chancellors‚Äîare *by definition* not directly elected to that role. Their parties are.
@dfb8084 @obrien @ZAZ49 There was more than one German election in 1932. The article does not say he won the presidential election.
@dfb8084 @obrien @ZAZ49 The winning party was the Nazi Party. It won more seats in the Reichstag than any other party. 		Hitler lost the *presidential* election of 1932. The Nazis won the parliamentary election. It was on that basis he was made chancellor. This is how parliamentary systems work.
@thenewmanata He lost the presidential election to Hindenburg. However, the Nazis won a plurality of seats in parliamentary elections, and Hitler was appointed chancellor on the basis of that, the same way any coalition is formed in a parliamentary system.
