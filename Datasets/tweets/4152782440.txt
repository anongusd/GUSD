@SenatorMenendez Only when you include military. Otherwise guns are pretty much at the bottom of the list of things that injure or kill in the civil realm. Come to think of it, in the military, it might be drones these days, not guns.
@KamalaHarris And thanks to healthcare for all and the other free stuff, we'll no longer be the wealthiest nation.
@gabrielmalor Not to mention that this is pretty much a normal occurrence in a child and adolescent behavioral health facility
@KamalaHarris Nothing says America quite like a government official telling you that you should just keep your kids in a public school you feel is failing their educational aspirations instead of making a choice that you know will benefit your child and give them better opportunities in life!
@JackPosobiec Until a Democrat is elected as president
@C_3C_3 @elizabethlaird4 Sounds pretty much on par for the Democratic course
@theydidwhat_ @RepJeffries Actually, no Divinity lives in humans at all until the acceptance of the Gospel into ones life. The unsaved human heart is "enmity towards God" and his "thoughts are evil" perpetually, seeking selfish desires. Bible doesn't tech man had any Divinity automatically. Falsehood
@washingtonpost @ishaantharoor So we should give North Korea 150 billion, let NK dictate inspections, all while they run around in the streets yelling death to Israel and America? Hmm, sounds like a great deal
So, @AOC allegedly has a political hit list on Dems that vote with Republicans? How very dictator-ish of her.... If true...
@RepJeffries But murderously people in MS-13  raping, burning, and slicing people up like a pineapple have a "spark of Divinity."
@allahpundit Not when he's also entangled with the special counsel.
@guypbenson Just the evolution from "pass to find out what's in it" to "pass it and we'll make it up as we go"
@SmithCassidy @ChrisMurphyCT As far as the fight for 15. It's not a living wage everywhere. The only guarantee is fed and state govt get more in taxes. Seattle raised minimum 10% with only a 1% rise in the workers wages. CA's rural manufacturing jobs decreased. Helps some, hurts others. But it sounds good!
@SmithCassidy @ChrisMurphyCT 2016 break down with a 2018 update... 		https://t.co/PpJHOujqhF
@ChrisMurphyCT Tyrannical government in waiting....
@RyanAFournier Apparently "strategic patience" is defined as "waiting for the next guy".
@SmithCassidy @ChrisMurphyCT If you are talking about those that account for well over half of the federal income taxes collected each year, yes. Or maybe just the 1% who still pay more than the bottom 80% of taxpayers, then again, yes. And I appreciate the companies reporting wage increases due to it also
Inspired by Amy Klobuchar https://t.co/xqXUGD7U9a
@ChrisMurphyCT I'm guessing you misspoke by accidently leaving out "hike". Otherwise I have to assume you did it purposefully in attempts to spread a lie.
Gillibrand is toast
@ChipzNgiggles Yep, they screwed up
@ChipzNgiggles I think both just because of the voting told in the past, and various public comments/speeches by Congressional and presidential politicians. But I agree Republicans is the most recent failure to do so.
@ChipzNgiggles @funder Possibly, but I think it might be for a reason most overlook.
@ChipzNgiggles @funder Even if it's just a smidgen, he's been tougher than "let's hit the reset button"and "tell Vlad I'll have more flexibility after this next election".
@Heritage I bet the future Permission to Procreate form asks your party affiliation
@benshapiro Didn't know climate change has a natural selection mechanism
@BradMossEsq No, you aren't.
@funder @ChipzNgiggles You want a president to respond to a hypothetical? Would it go something like " Well... Well, if we nuked you first and you responded by nuking us then, then we'd nuke you again!"
@NRO @AOC @jackrcrowe Starting to believe the conspiracy theories on population control could become a reality
@RealDeanCain In the world of the left, Republicans don't count.
@ChrisMurphyCT Yer an idiot
@RepJeffries Now apparently we'll be taking care of the bill to have another investigation into the SOS because it may not yield the results that were hoped. Respect the taxpayers money and stop the redundant investigations.
@AOC https://t.co/gAXnU76TgG
@RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal @RepEliotEngel @RepCummings I thought you were gonna do an investigation no matter what Mueller found?
@KamalaHarris Don't forget the claims of excellence in typhus and homelessness
@tictoc @splcenter The SPLC? Isn't that the organization that has been sued successfully for multiple defamation filings for going all will you nilly on their lists?
@SenJeffMerkley I think the House I'd starting to write off Mueller and his investigation, just in case he doesn't deliver what they are hoping for.
@redsteeze @benshapiro With all of those killer air conditioners
anyone else thinking that a minimum wage hike benefits only those taxing it? If that... https://t.co/kvIZ79aiv6
@SenSchumer Let taxes taken out of paycheck through the year, increase in child  deductions. That is what I took from what was said.
@gingerthomp1 @ChipzNgiggles @CBP That quote alone is what medical professionals use to determine possible abuse with patients.
@ChrisMurphyCT Evolution? That's the issue with this guy, a flip flop on evolution?
@SenJeffMerkley No, because a 100 trillion bucks is unaffordable, cow farts are not killing us, and even if the US stopped everything carbon emitting and even ceased to exist, the benefit would be less than like a tenth of a degree by year 2100.
@RepSwalwell "I need coffee" means you have an addictive personality and are currently addicted to caffeine. Seek help.
@SenBlumenthal Not unlike the hush money paid to those who made sexual allegations against members of Congress.
@SenJeffMerkley IG for FBI says he lied so....
@SenJeffMerkley Which one of those campaign officials plead guilty to collision with Russia?
@FrankPallone Want it within the last couple of days we recorded the most illegal crossings in one day unrivaled since 2014?
@SenSanders No. Let us keep our money since government has proven unable to do right by it.
@SenSchumer A former AG who can't meet the moment of being an AG....🙄
@SenWhitehouse Aren't all false statements intentional?
@OfficialSPGB @KatiePavlich Are you saying that over 330 million people are all going to agree on how to divide and disperse everything without centralizing it to any governing body whatsoever? Feel free to help me understand how that will work.
@BubbyVgk @DanCrenshawTX @BetoORourke Never thought I'd see their gun control argument applied to a wall
@AOC Moooo?
@AdrianCikguTeoh @RealSaavedra @benshapiro Because the roof would fall down and end his family's lives
@dbongino I wish I could read this article without having a redirection from assignments
@SenSanders Latest data showed more jobs available than people looking for jobs. Just saying.....
@Jacqui_Reed86 You got this!!!
@SenSanders Yeah, and because government put their hands in those pies, social security is on track to unsustainability and Medicare works really great of you but supplemental insurance.	https://t.co/iT6t54qMZi
@ChrisMurphyCT Thanks to the bright idea to shift from using global chilling to global warming, then just call it climate change for whatever happens it's because of this. Talk to Bernie, apparently terrorism isn't because there's snow on the ground
@tictoc And when pro 2nd A @SteveScalise wanted to give his experience in front of the committee the Dems didn't let him
@SenSanders Because 31000 dollars a year gross a living wage in every state does not make
@RepJeffries Why do I get the impression all politicians are more concerned about sound bites? 🤔
@RepDanCrenshaw They're between a rock and a hard place. They need a lot more people to pay for the #GreenNewDeal but also need population control to make it sustainable.
@dbongino They just talked about golf and grandchildren
@washingtonpost I'm guessing that explanation applied also during the previous administration's? It was always a reference to Trump, Bolton, and Pompeo for all three years? Or is it a fluid statement?
Kinda like watching this AG oversight hearing.... I've never been to a circus before!
@HotlineJosh Democrats if they lose 2020.. "we must not have gone far enough left!"
@ChrisMurphyCT It's more about the centralization of of everything in the country giving government control of... everything.	It's that while tyrannical government thing.
@ChrisMurphyCT It was in reference to the subpoena that was issued after he had already agreed to provide testimony.
@Ilhan So less than 6 percent of the population (people here illegally) commit 3 homicides per 100k people, compared to native born 4 homicides per 100k. Do you not see a problem with that?
My favorite from the Virginia fiasco conversations..... https://t.co/WpKgnuXjp3
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal I'm not going to try to find the videos of everything I heard right now. But feel free to spend some time on it. If I ever decide to go into journalism I'll be sure to record absolutely everything I watch and read for future reference. Gotta sleep now. May get back to ya though.
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal I believe it was Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Also implied in remarks made about undoing decades of progress, bill Clinton and if I remember correctly Schumer. The Clinton "make America white again"would also imply minorities losing rights.
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal The economy will crash. Voting and other rights will be taken away from woman and blacks, the second half of the original tweet with multiple prior predictions that haven't come to fruition. Those are all from Democratic elected officials.
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal Like I said, point taken. However, neither side is innocent of it within the walls of Congress and otherwise. So it's hard for me to take any of them seriously
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal It's more of the people have said approach by tweets from the random people. No I didn't save them or like them for reference later so I get your point.
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal Random people that say people are going to die from everything that is done by people on the opposite political side as them.
They had to have a discussion about standing up for having over 1000 sex traffickers put behind bars
@DailyCaller He has 2 pages in a yearbook!
Crooked tie jokes shall commence in 3, 2, 1.....
@RepLowenthal Fearmongering is telling everyone that they are going to die from the repeal of net neutrality, that we are all going to die from climate change during all those predictions that still haven't shown up.
@Gus_tavo7196 @SenSanders Considering they use models that have been proven wrong (the times billions were sup'd to die) we won't really know what will help w climate change. when he stops flying in private jets and gets rid of the evil air conditioners on his 2 or is it 3, houses, I'll take him seriously
@RyanAFournier Baltimore maybe
@RyanAFournier Wasn't it Boston that tried that and didn't it fail?
@SenSanders Wow, sorry for the typing errors. * Millions and even billions
@DailyCaller There it is
@SenSanders If Congress reformed immigration, secured borders on an effective Manor, billions upon millions could be saved to help with all of that. As a senator you should probably be looking at the negative effects also on our current situation in immigration.
@ChipzNgiggles It's ridiculous some of the majors that are out there
@ChipzNgiggles @sassy45378570 @SenSchumer That I agree with wholeheartedly!
@ChipzNgiggles @sassy45378570 @SenSchumer Ha! My bad		https://t.co/SIRg5jMXRW
@ChipzNgiggles @sassy45378570 @SenSchumer https://t.co/nZd1ogSwoG		https://t.co/nZd1ogSwoG
@ChipzNgiggles @sassy45378570 @SenSchumer Not to mention allowing the drug running to take place during "negotiations"
@ChipzNgiggles @sassy45378570 @SenSchumer Late 2015 to early 2016 Iran tested long range missiles which Obama states violated the rules of the deal. He even said that Iran want "honoring the spirit of the deal". Sanctions were violated to deliver that money. #notmynarrative
@ChipzNgiggles @sassy45378570 @SenSchumer Nothing like giving a country millions, and billions, of dollars while they yell death to America in their streets. My favorite part was Kerry saying, no, it's not 150 billion and it's not going to terrorism. Then saying, week yeah, 100 billion it so, and yeah, terrorism
@echatepalla @ChipzNgiggles @SenSchumer * let Vlad know I'll have more flexibility about Europe's missile defense system after I get elected to my second term* (paraphrased)  said not the Trump administration ever
@ChipzNgiggles @SenSchumer Or the 6 billion "inadequately accounted for" in the state department, 500 million given to a company that went bankrupt, 2 million to find out kids won't eat food that's been sneezed on,  etc..etc..etc...
@SenSchumer Government accountability... Like that 43 million dollar gas station in Afghanistan that the local don't/can't use? Whatever happened to that
@SenSanders I could live for 3 years of your government salary alone. 16.5 years off of just a million dollars which I believe you made in the free, capitalist market with your book sales
@FrankPallone @GovMurphy Not bad considering on average, more than half of your net income will go towards rent.
@holdmyale He forgot the snowmobile
@marthamaccallum you gonna video your visit to @HARRISFAULKNER s office tomorrow?
RT @verizon: RT &amp; we’ll donate $1, up to $1.5M, in support of first responders to the @GarySiniseFound (1.18–2.8). These are the stories of…
@ChrisMurphyCT Is there a "physical barrier" in those national security policies?
@scottmiller75 @AOC @NydiaVelazquez https://t.co/nZd1ogSwoG	It is referred to as a federal prison on numerous occasions.
@AOC @NydiaVelazquez Speaks more of the federal governments ability to maintain absolutely anything in an efficient Manor.
@RepJeffries @NydiaVelazquez @RepJerryNadler @RepMaloney Curious. Did y'all get the heat on while you were there?
@RealJamesWoods *gonna*
@KamalaHarris Isn't this a federal building? Just saying....
@RealJamesWoods Pelosi and Schumer are good "Weekend at Bernies" that woman all the way to the next elected Democrat president.
@ewarren Grab a beer and invite your husband to y'all's house?
@realDerekUtley After the Hillary thing, Booker.
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump Don't undermine an arms test that is being undermined by the other party involved. So, we remain at our current nuclear capabilities in a treat while Russia surpasses the rest of the world while being in the same treat?
@SenSanders You made at least ten times more than I did with your book sales and what not... In the free market of capitalism.... Shut it until you use your money to pay some of my bills.
@RepJeffries But even MS 13 members have a "spark of Divinity" in them
@RepSwalwell @HouseJudiciary Will the attendance involve a discussion on dropping bombs on American citizens.
@scrowder Jerk
@DanRather @SenJeffMerkley Who are they needing to expand the vote to?
@SanVines @SenWarren @SenTinaSmith @RepPressley I might have been		https://t.co/f9nmiAIxkq
@FrankPallone If the 2A was about muskets, then the 1A can't be about internet
@BernieSanders Please, as an elected official, give us a study that breaks down every pay for every position among lines of gender and ethnicity as opposed to vague averages without specifics.
@RepJeffries I'd that including the house speakers comments that verified what POTUS said?
@SenWarren @SenTinaSmith @RepPressley I heard there was a bill brought up to pay them during the shutdown. Also heard Dem house rejected it yet still went out to be a talking head yelling about how they needed their money so badly
@RepJerryNadler They also donate to Democrats so if understand why you're think they are important
@SenBlumenthal Going back to the Obama administration, maybe further?
@RepAnnaEshoo The one that will not be sustainable by 2035? Oh well, apparently will all be dead by 2031 according to @AOC because of climate change..... Again. But since we are all dead because of net neutrality bring yanked, that doesn't matter either
@KeithBoj @RepMikeTurner I did research on my local officials salaries, unless you are the ME, governor, or engineer director of something out another, you aren't making a living!
@DailySignal @Heritage Sorry. Apparently the "majority of Americans support" angle is only relevant to Dems gun control arguments.
@DailyCaller Why do they even have jobs still
@KeithBoj @RepMikeTurner Thanks for the perspective, there is a 50 percent difference when presented with the average for a federal government worker. Sorry, original comment didn't reflect federal
@marklevinshow So, Russia has more actual dirt on Bernie than they do Trump?
@ewarren @senatemajldr Umm, American citizens. Not illegal immigrants, American citizens. It's in there, you just have to read it. US Code has it also. You're allowed to get a copy of you'd like to read it
@RepMikeTurner My statement is that, on average, government employees make to much money compared to the rest of us.
@KamalaHarris Early voting. If you really care about equality, bring down the government employee salaries to match the rest of us.
@ScottHech @SenJeffMerkley Yeah, the Steinle family suffered some trauma to. Especially the dad, he was there when it happened I believe
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Caravans, organized, for the intention to not over or immigration laws
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/VoBYWgU2sY
@SenSchumer For someone ranting about Russia hacking the elections, you literally want them to be able to jump online and register voters to influence an election.
@DailyCaller Someone who really represents what the industry has become..... Someone like..... Kate Spade, Mark Salling
@SenSanders I'm, do you don't want to give those workers their money? Cuz I could have sworn that you were heartbroken they weren't getting paid like...a week ago
@SenJeffMerkley Can we expanding his team of investigation to include every member of every office and institution of or government? Asking for Americans
@AriFleischer Napalm
@RealSaavedra "hey, can you come work for us and tell us how to misunderstand voters?"
@realannapaulina @RyanAFournier The Dems would rather legislate a way to make it legal so they can tax it
@Mediaite @BillHemmer Wait. The anti billionaire candidate asked a billionaire for money?
@SenateDems @SenSchumer And to think there was opportunity to save 5.3 billion of that.
@WSJ How does that mesh with the free, adorable healthcare?
@SenJeffMerkley It's possible y'all could get your spending addiction under control. Both parties claim to be for the people but the people know that if you have $3.40, you can't buy something that is $4.37.
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump What was it when Obama was contemplating the same areas for a no travel
@UnderCanada @CoryBooker This is just a Google. Haven't read it. 		https://t.co/U18T8q55BY
@RealDeanCain Magic wands do exist apparently. Harry Potter fans will rejoice
@UnderCanada @CoryBooker Corroborating evidence that is
@UnderCanada @CoryBooker A man accused him of sexually assaulting him in a bathroom. Timeframe is important here because it was on the tail end of the Kavanaugh hearings where they didn't utilize any official reports just an accusation which was supposed to be believed without cornerstone evidence
@JayinWashington @Twitter @realDonaldTrump It's amazing how much dictatorship comes from the left claiming Trump is a dictator
@UnderCanada @CoryBooker There allegations that were levied against Booker
@JayinWashington @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump HA? After Christ my brother!
@JayinWashington @DailyCaller But n my personal view, I tend to believe that the Jewish people/Israel represent sort of, validation of God and Truth. It's acting on human nature, the "enmity towards God" that drives the hated towards them
@JayinWashington @DailyCaller It was just a thought. Of course it could be that they are Holocaust deniers and to not know history they are doomed to repeat it.
@JayinWashington @DailyCaller Probably because of its close proximity to Christianity. Can't have any of that while they try to detour the US into socialism/communism.
@SenWhitehouse Silver lining, at least people won't be using those death machines we call air conditioners
@GovMikeHuckabee Pretty sure that came in handy when she was trying to get a "leg up" in jump starting her career
@KamalaHarris People are more likely to due from government approved chemicals.
@ewarren Yeah, government is good at flushing billions of dollars down the drain
@SenatorMenendez So, did you get the number for that lady you were talking to on the beach instead of being in DC negotiating to reopen the government?
@allahpundit What kind of lawmaker throws out the term "assault weapons" that defines no weapon available to the general public?
@SenatorMenendez You really don't care do you.
@KamalaHarris We get it already. You need to raise the monitor wage so you can collect more 💰 in taxes for all of your "free" stuff
@tictoc Great, that can fund California's healthcare for all for what, 6 years? To bad for the other 49 states though.
@greggutfeld Wasn't that impactful, I have no idea what you are talking about. Sorry
@SenSanders When a white guy commits a murder, you speak incessantly about gun control, when an illegal alien commits murder, you want more open borders.
@KamalaHarris Every person already has the right to reproduce or not. It's a choice. Don't wanna reproduce, don't have sex without readiness for the consequences
@KamalaHarris Science fact for climate change but not abortion.... So, science fact when it's convenient...
@KamalaHarris I noticed you didn't actually answer the question.
@KamalaHarris I like how you used public school system as opposed to all, since you have colleagues attaching a private school with a cherry picked video. If you pay any attention, misinformation is the enemy of Truth. Free press loves misinformation, as do elected officials.
@RepJerryNadler @NydiaVelazquez Are you talking about when he followed through with the travel ban from the same exact countries Obama had written up for the same?
@SenatorCardin @POTUS Yeah, that's over now. Shouldn't you be preparing for negotiation? Or are you not planning on getting things done?
@BernieSanders Instead of preaching to the people that we need to give you more money to fight climate change, quit taking private jets and get rid of the air conditioners on your, what, 2...3 houses?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yep, enjoying the view from behind her wall at home
@KamalaHarris And not have their loved ones killed by drugs or even at the hands of the people illegally crossing it border, not do they want to have children or anyone else trafficked for sex or forced labor. Don't hear much from you concerning that, just see you offering free things
@KamalaHarris What if it's their choice? Or do you not believe we should have choice anymore?
@SenJeffMerkley 1) directions for Democrat lapdog journalists?	2) reintroduce legislation already denied so you can continue to be lazy and not have to negotiate?
@SenSchumer You have no intention on giving anything, ever, towards a physical barrier on the border.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Here I was thinking that people who were forced to sign up for the ACA choose not to sign up again
@KamalaHarris It is completely irresponsible for elected officials to not negotiate on security for the people they are to serve. But I digress, I know you're busy on your campaign for the people that are dead because of it border issues.
@SenSanders Wow, how many "predictions of doom that hasn't come to fruition" will this make? Human race sure has been killed a whole lot because of this climate change thing over the years... The oceans are overtaking all the continents and I'm overheating in all this snow!
@BernieSanders BECAUSE AMERICANS ARE DYING FROM DRUG OVERDOSES,  CHILDREN ARE BEING TRAFFICKED FOR SEX.. THAT MEANS CHILDREN ARE BEING F&amp;_#ED BY GROWN MEN. THE CRISIS COMING IN SECOND? THE DEMOCRATS UNWILLINGNESS TO DEAL WITH IT AND INSTEAD U TALK ABOUT PEOPLE'S INCOMES!!!!
He isn't wrong https://t.co/YwAlMt0hBd
Democrat Congress is having an absolute for on Twitter. President must have given a press conference or something about the shutdown because each of them are refusing to do anything. I want a job where I don't have to do my job. Must be nice.
@SenSanders That's code for... Take everything away from everyone and then give them only what they need....
@SenFeinstein Uhm, read Muellers reports much? Or just grab on to any unverified report.... Oh wait, the dossier answers that question
@SenJeffMerkley Expanding the right to vote to whom? Noncitizens? That's not protecting our democracy, that is foreign interference in our elections. But I guess it's good for some, bad for others, huh?
@ChrisMurphyCT Well, except their hasn't been any testing, South Korea send to be enjoying the concessions North had been doing by demilitarizing the border between them, outposts and other barriers being dismantled, family members being reunited and visiting reach other. Please, continue....
@BernieSanders Easy fix. Stop sending money to other nations for their defense and bring or troops home. Less money spent, all good.
@KamalaHarris How much education are they getting while their teachers are on strike?
@jasonadelia @FrankPallone @senatemajldr Are we talking will of all of the American people or just those that voted Democrat? Asking for the 60+ million that voted to have walls.
@SenatorMenendez Well, she does still have her life, unlike those who, even during the shutdown, lost their life to those who should not have been here
@SenatorMenendez Don't see ya saying that about the money sent overseas to build a wall, do we?
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept Any maybe you can invite your husband to your house to
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept Have another beer
@SenFeinstein Forget that studies have said California anti logging and water detouring played a role in the fires they have
@SenWhitehouse @Koch_Industries Soros had spent hundreds of millions trying to convince us Democrats is the only good party to vote for. What's your point?
@SenSanders I ordered 6 bean burritos and 6 tacos in a grande meal. I received 12 tacos, 6 beef and 6 with bean. That does not deserve 15 dollars an hour.
@KamalaHarris It can be argued that there lack of the question is political. Higher number of people in a state gives higher electorial votes, regardless if all individuals are actually able to vote. Also effects federal money.
@SebGorka The Great Grape Ape
@SenJeffMerkley Two deaths and another stabbing has happened in the last 4 weeks, that have been reported at least. Which one is worse, families without a paycheck that they'll end up getting back, or families losing a loved one that they won't get back?
@MarkWarner @SenWhitehouse Did you show up to the lunch today?
@SenSanders 100 percent would like the money they or into social security to actually be there when they retire and have it separated from the general budget where Congress gets their hands on it
@KatiePavlich Yeah, I couldn't write follow what Booker was trying to get at. Barr says comments were about violent criminals and then Booker spoke and went into something about not going into personal experience after going into personal experience and states that they could go n2 but doesn't
So now it's.... "I'm identifying you as a white person so now you are white privilege" ??? https://t.co/3NfZE1GpVA
@SenWarren No one expected you to vote Yes. Long love the resistance! Or some crap like that
Especially when they pay 30000a year for a degree that has no value in the job market https://t.co/5CsrBsEJgQ
@SenSanders You really are greedy for other people's money and hate their success huh
@nowthisnews @SenatorTester Protect this country first then. I'm sure we've helped pay for other countries border walls, why not our own?
@NWSWPC @NWS Looking like a nuclear mushroom cloud.
@KamalaHarris "we". Meaning, Congress should act like a "we" like normal "we the people" do on a daily basis and compromise instead of grandstanding with rhetoric and narratives. "We" are over 300 million people, not 62 million "them" and 64 million "us". Pathetic
@maziehirono He didn't send guns into Mexico that came back across and killed Brian Terry. He didn't make so those drugs coming across before he was president, he didn't gather together things to come across here illegally. Americans would appreciate you doing your job to. Build it
@SenFeinstein You should secure the border also. I hear there are multiple ways to do that
@FJ4Lo @mbhcpa @Acosta @stevebruskCNN Seeing this one kinda makes me concerned for @Acosta 's well being. 😕
@SenJeffMerkley SECURE THE BORDER
@RepThompson 7th century that Dems voted to allocate funds for in the 21st century
@SenSanders And you're salivating at an opportunity to get your hands all over it, key like that private jet, the beach house, you love capitalism for you, socialism for others huh
@SenFeinstein Did you just @Acosta yourself?
@SenFeinstein I believe they've built walls since then
@robbystarbuck @MSNBC She can't even say it with a straight face
@JamesSurowiecki @ChrisMurphyCT And Democrats voted for a physical barrier.....
@CoryBooker Over 2 thirds of Americans believe our border needs to be more secure. But sure, make it harder for Americans to get give to defend against the guns Obama let walk into Mexico that we still haven't found.
@DailyCaller Healthcare for all!!!!
@scrowder Stalker much?
In other words, let's change what we eat for when the nation declined because of socialism the left is pushing https://t.co/ClmxMkBub6
@SenatorCarper No one is calling for a 2000 Molly long wall
@Acosta You possibly just pissed of the party who's butts' you kiss
@SenSanders That's rich (no pun intended). That you would ask how many more people need to die? I believe that ? was just asked on national TV regarding American deaths by the hands of illegals, but I guess you give a shit about those?
Mexico finds 20 bodies, 17 of them burned, near U.S. border | Article [AMP] | Reuters https://t.co/1Qd6jIOej0
@SenatorMenendez You took an oath to protect the CITIZENS of the UNITED STATES!!! And you are failing
@greta Absolutely agree.
@NRO @JohnsonHildy I'm sure Brian Terry might think otherwise
@KamalaHarris Better, as in, deserving not to be shot, raped, burned, stabbed by a criminal here illegally, let lose into the community instead of being deported?
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Yeah, just like getting rid of net neutrality was going to create a crisis and people were going to die.
@conservmillen I hear there are hundreds of pounds of cool population crossing into our country through the porous southern border! Plenty to go around!
@ChrisMurphyCT I agree with not having private sales, I also know that Molly Tibbets, Corporal Singh, Kate Steinle, and the many more killed by people who shouldn't of been here, had dreams also. It's sad when an elected official cherry picker deaths to fuel an agenda, ignoring others.
I'm thinking of I just stick with what I have now, in 3 years it would be considered loving off-grid https://t.co/dN9fLzrthf
@MarkWarner @SenatorMenendez Reduce the foreign aid bill to 49 billion and give 5 billion for the "physical barrier" along the southern border.
@SenSanders Says the man making a million here and there after being propped up in a government job
@theweatherKat @SenatorCardin @senatemajldr Yep, house did to prior to Democrat majority, with 5 billion. But since it was Republican I guess it doesn't count anymore.
@RepJeffries @BarackObama Yeah, the precedent in lying to the American people to get them to want a legislation that did the opposite of what he said it would do. Ah yes, historical indeed
@RepLowenthal Climate change could cost US billions? I'll take that over the trillions Dems want to spend to find it. Sounds more budget friendly for us tax payers y'all want to rape and pillage
@SenatorBaldwin @RonWyden I thought Rachel Maddie has those in her super duper headlining exclusive? We learned that he paid a butt load of taxes and made an even bigger butt load of money
@allahpundit Blackberries, that stuff sucks.
@justtrollingby She's a Democrat, so probably not
@SenatorCardin @senatemajldr Like the house and their impeachment articles, abortion abroad, and trying to eliminate the electoral college? Or maybe when they all voted against a resolution to take up government funding on the first day so they could go home?
@SenSchumer Stop hurting the American people and secure the border
@GroverNorquist A reverse form of debt slavery
@ewarren Democratic Republic. I love how so many leave out that last part to cultivate the mob rule mentality
@TitaniaMcGrath @owenbarton10 That sounds really painful...
@SenSanders Fraud, that's a familiar word for you and your wife isn't it?
I'm convinced that, to all politicians, the wall would represent their failures for the many years of not doing their job effectively.
RT @NikkiHaley: Keep the refollows coming! Please retweet and remind friends to follow me @NikkiHaley. ❤️🇺🇸
@WSJ Gee, who would've seen that coming. Oh wait, the people who've had their lives ruined by the  stuff everyone said was harmless.
@SenSanders Because if he gives up this fight, you will never do anything about it
@SenatorMenendez On the flip side, Dems can't afford to give Trump another win and make themselves appear irrelevant after his ideas actually work, so let Americans die at the hands of illegals..... Treasonous. No care for American citizens, but all the love for illegals
@RepJeffries As far as I'm concerned I've lived without that money for a whole year, I can wait a little longer. Give the 5 billion and do your constitutional duties along with the rest of, what appears, your America hating colleagues.
@SenBobCasey You do realize no one is calling for it to be along the entire border right?
@RalphNader @jaketapper Nothing says public harm like dying at the hands of someone illegally here in the US who crossed the border multiple times and has been protected by sanctuary policies.
@allahpundit There will be poles installed in all three Chambers of government next week
@ChrisMurphyCT And top Dems all voted and ran on turning illegal immigration.... And a wall
@ChrisMurphyCT @RonWyden No, I really don't care what they say. I do care elected officials turning or government into a police state and investigating everything in ones life who is on the other side of the political aisle.
RT @WaysandMeansGOP: As one of their first actions leading the House, @HouseDemocrats rejected efforts to make the $2,000 child tax credit…
@SenSanders Stay off the jets, see a couple of your houses with those AC units Gore says is a bigger threat than terrorism, donate every penny you make outside of your Congressional salary, then come talk to me.
@SenSanders High deductible and co-payments that increased in the ACA. Great job with that!
@BernieSanders Because union donations go properly, if not entirely, to Democrats candidates. If I were a Democrat running for office, I'd want more unions to!
@BernieSanders How does that go. Government gives money to the schools for it education... Ok, isn't that what they do now? Aren't millions of people drowning in debt as the schools raised their tuitions because they could get more money from the students AND the government?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HIASrefugees You shouldn't be getting a salary as with everyone else in Congress, both sides, because none of you have really done the jobs you were elected to do. If I don't do my job, even the parts I don't agree with, I have no job, no pay.
@KamalaHarris Crowdfunding? Like the ACA?
@BernieSanders There are more jobs available than people seeking them. Check that one off the list
It sucks that people are in this position. But it is what happens when we rely on a dysfunctional government to take care of us. https://t.co/K0Ad2A5XK2
@SenSanders My. Sanders, two children are dead because of the deal track of things off Mike parents took their children on instead of stopping at closer places we've set up for people to claim asylum. One dad reportedly refused further treatment and later said it's easier to get in with kids
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump In other words, y'all waited last minute for everything, would rather let something like that lapse instead of providing $ for a physical barrier to aid in ebbing the flow of illegal immigration? For what? Resistance to to the wishes of half the voting population?
@maziehirono Don't think it's possible to take you seriously as you say for the sale of our country when you literally can't vote to save the sovereignty of our country.
@Yair_Rosenberg @AG_Conservative So Russia is now the excuse for everything that doesn't go the lefts way I guess
@SenWhitehouse @foxandfriends @politico Because she is in the house, where the 5 billion passed. Not the Senate. Please tell me you know the difference
@conservmillen @politicalelle At yes. I wonder if the people of Sodom were thinking this
@UN All countries except those like Israel, possibly even America, but y'all definitely don't like Israel
@UN What do we pay you for?
@KamalaHarris Correction, parkland activist worth views you agree with, any others were ignored by you
@SenatorTomUdall @DHSgov @CBP @MartinHeinrich @repbenraylujan @SenGillibrand Dad said no more treatment. There you go. Give me 100k dollars and I just saved the taxpayers millions
@SenSanders I'd be willing to say 90% of Americans imagine a different world. One where what they feel is important within right wing ideology and left wing ideology is brought into realization instead of the all or nothing clinging to ideologies that is happening and hindering real progress
@Ocasio2018 Zip codes don't determine destiny. If that were so, you wouldn't be where you are.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump He's gotta do the can can?
@TomArnold @pittpens99 @DLoesch @NRA Are you..., What the...., how'd....., I can't
@RepJerryNadler @RepZoeLofgren @RepCummings @BennieGThompson @JoaquinCastrotx Are you calling for an investigation into the death of the most recent coming killing in California or would those facts be a little inconvenient for you
@SenSanders Comparison time	Liar= misleading numbers on who the top 1 to 10 % are	Fraud=being in the top 1 to 10 % while railing against them	Narcissist=well, I'm sure there might be a comparison somewhere, but he is a big one.	Bully= wanting to force everyone in this country to give you $$$
@SenFeinstein Why are we sending our money to them still if it's so bad. Wasn't that money supposed to to and help the people? Plus, 47k people were apprehended coming across our border in 1 month. Unsustainable.
@jasoninthehouse Port-a-potties
@RepJeffries During all of your investigations and the call to end corruption. You should ask American citizens if we would like to have 100% of every member of Congress investigated for wrong doings, left and right. You already have one yes here
@MayorPugh50 @NRA @Everytown To much of that legal marijuana, aye?
@ivankaputski @MartinHeinrich Shhhh, we're not supposed to think for ourselves and provide facts that oppose the preferred narrative!
@RepJeffries Care to protect Americans from potential future criminal acts? As your colleague Murphy posted an article that 6.6% of our population  (the illegal portion) commit 3 homicides per 100k people, three quarters of what the other 93.4% do?
@ChrisMurphyCT Let's do math. 22 million illegal immigrants in a country with 330 million. That's 6.6 percent of the population. Within that 6.6%, 3 homicides per 100k are by illegals with 4per 100k by native born? Who the hell are you trying to fool?
@SenSanders You enjoying being a millionaire yet?
@KamalaHarris Yeah, at least they're alive to worry about those things.		#KateSteinle
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, millions of American citizens are wondering when their government will start giving a $h!+ about them and those song from the many things that come from open, porous borders.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump And you're still giving drug cartels the gift of free access to the US.
@NYTmag @RepJerryNadler I didn't know they were supposed to investigate every president and everyone who has ever wiped his or her ass. If that's the case, maybe we should investigate all those Representatives that come in with not so much and father millions in worth. Or, just everyone
@FrankPallone It means millions of people crossing our borders legally every year. It means drugs still carried over the border into the USA, it means hundreds of children trafficked into and out of the country for see and forced labor. It means you haven't done your number one mandate
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump We arrived because you won't fund what you and other Dems voted for twice, at least, in the past.....a border wall.
@greggutfeld Don't have any house plants, whatcha got now?
@jopo3aolcom1 @SenatorMenendez Pretty sure every politician has promised unkept, and I'm not one that thought they would pay for it. But it is the one mandate that or government has, to provide security for it's citizens.
@ChrisMurphyCT Pretty sure they've already been paid
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Not unlike building walls between every race, gender and belief system in order to gain control over the people huh?
@RepZoeLofgren Are you talking about the majority of Hispanic workers in those forces that say they need a wall to help do their jobs which they are still proudly doing while you help shut down the government for not giving them the wall?
@SenatorMenendez In comparison to public sector, government employees make too much anyway. Congress included, especially for the work you don't do. Find the wall!
@RepJeffries I'd rather lose in a 401k than lose the lives that families have because of our lack of having a wall.
@KamalaHarris If you're silent enough you can hear people crying because of their loved ones who will not be there this Christmas after being killed by someone who was deported multiple times yet is still here illegally......
@RepHuffman @realDonaldTrump Same could be said of you sir. You could just give 5 billion instead of risking 24. So what say you.
@SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump Could say the same thing with all the Democrats who've voted or at least spoke of needing a physical barrier or wall and not allowing illegal aliens to circumvent the process and those who are doing it legally. But please, continue
@SenJeffMerkley Or maybe build a wall so we wouldn't have to use the Narcan in the first place? Band-Aids, that would have to be bought year after year after year as we still allow drugs to pour in over or southern border. Try to get a little serious about this please
@SenJeffMerkley Bring a nurse, I will say thanks for being concerned about staffing in hospitals. But it's a pity that you use it to deflect from something over 62 million Americans want to have happen.
@SenSherrodBrown It's also despicable from the average tax payer that we work to support ourselves because we are able, and part of our money gets taken away to support people who don't work but are able
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump And for years comes has proposed border security and even a wall... Both sides.. So...........
@SenSanders The 4 thousands comes from two parent homes with children. A return that happens in 2019
@SenBlumenthal I thought it was in Vietnam?
@NydiaVelazquez ... I'm glad to see "clip" capacities limited.... But this is a small step....	... I'm glad to see AR-58's banned... But this is a small step.....	... I'm glad to see long rifles banned, but this is a small step...	... I'm glad to see all guns banned...	See where this is going...
@KamalaHarris Can we also the government loans to majors that actual have a market in the world of working to support yourself?
@CoachGlenn40 @ADunbot @RealJimbabwe @conservmillen @MattWalshBlog But science!!!!!! Well, not in the realm of gender, just climate change
@DanaPerino Game day lessons?
@CoryBooker Losing hope when lawmakers circumvent  due process and innocent until proven guilty just to smear a guy because they want a hope to regain the power of the Supreme Court.
@KamalaHarris Ok, she was forced to travel thousands of miles without proper food and hydration because they parents wanted to enter into a country illegally in hopes to get the incentives that our Congress has allowed to go on for way too long. There, and it was a free assessment
@SenSanders I hear there are millions starving in Venezuela also. Don't hear ya wanting to do anything about the socialism that caused that
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What's worse is you throwing away the security majority of Americans want
@RepLowenthal Cutting immigration is going to give us disease?
@DailyCaller Was this a government funded project? Wouldn't surprise me
@prageru Nope. That would be foreign influence in an American election
@BernieSanders Our taxes pay for all education, it's not free. Free is your wife after committing some loan fraud and running a college into bankruptcy who now sits at home and takes those private jet ride with you
@andrewklavan @Slate Never heard of them
@KatiePavlich Because she may not even be sure which chamber of government she was elected to
@SenatorCardin @realDonaldTrump There new wall would be better than the one illegal aliens are climbing over now. So yeah, it would help
@guypbenson Just in time to regift!
@SenBlumenthal Butina? Is that the one that Obama administration let into the country and met with fusion GPS before and after the tower meeting?
@SenSchumer Or maybe people aren't getting it because it's not mandated anymore. People don't like government telling them what they HAVE to do.
@KatiePavlich Yeah, just like the 15 an hour push. Raise your income so the gov. can get more of your money while your employer has to cut back on your hours. Sounds like a perfect plan.
@StappElizabeth @elizabethlaird4 I guess it would be hard to say firing Comey would be an attempt to obstruct an investigation when Comey didn't know a damn thing about the investigation
@SenSchumer Funny, the American people have been saying that for years about Congress. Heck, were be happy if y'all worked at all
@DailyCaller Well, look on the bright side I guess, you still have child bearing.
@BernieSanders Did it work in Flint, Michigan?
@SenatorMenendez Now do the Clinton foundation...
@SenWhitehouse @EPA 700 billion to prop up the car manufacturing. Hundreds of billions to keep some financial firms from shutting their doors. All the while Americans lost jobs, homes, and even families. No help for them though.
@JaniceDean What are the Oscars?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It's like you out issues together knowing it won't get done that way. I can already hear you using the Senate floor to say we tried to reach an infrastructure deal but the president wouldn't do it....
@DailyCaller @AndrewGillum @BarackObama Or, "hey, if you lose again, it'll give us another chance to call America racist"
@KamalaHarris Almost as bad as using ones position to ruin a man's life by usurping guidelines of a government committee on handling accusations in a private way and p putting it out into the open court of public opinion for political purposes? Asking for a friend...
@KamalaHarris *seems*
@NPR Just can't help yourselves can ya
@KamalaHarris Send to me, fix current California policies on wildlife and stop the wildfires from happening would actually reduce carbon emissions. Appears that would help some huh.
@SenSanders Not is there a lot of coverage of all the carbon emissions your private jet sent into the air. (that you spent 300,000 bucks on travel in a month) do your actions and words tell us that e need to lower our emissions and raise our taxes so the elites can still have their luxury
@BernieSanders What about the women that don't want to have to work and would rather be able to be a stay at home mom. Or is it sexist for a woman to choose for herself to do so. I'm a little confused with all the PC rules and thought regulations
@SenGillibrand Does that mean if the decision is not reversed, that all those people will die on December 11th liked we were told would happen. I hope that prediction is as reliable as the last three or four times half the world was going to die from global warming, I mean cooling, I mean......
@SenGillibrand Or future should be everyone together but ok
@SenSanders @billmckibben @Ocasio2018 @VanJones68 @shailenewoodley Tell that to this guy that got knocked out for no reason...		Check out @MichaelT_45’s Tweet: https://t.co/obSbYCOf61
@SaraCarterDC It's like they read 1984 and said, "ya know, this is a good idea!"
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump If we aren't those things, then why are all the Dems who have been proven liars during investigations, running free while Cohen, Flynn and others are being prosecuted?
@DanaPerino *loss*
@DanaPerino I'm sorry for your lost
@SenGillibrand It was also predicted most of the Earth's population should be dead now because of climate change, like, 3 or 4 times now.
@allahpundit Do he's saying the media is the enemy of those people?
@Jacqui_Reed86 I take it they won?
@Jacqui_Reed86 When I read Waddle, my first thought was of the Penguin waddling down the field
For my 11th birthday, my now step dad gave me a #guitar when I had no interest in music. Haven't put it down since, even though I've tried.
@benshapiro Being "Bobbit'd"
@RyanAFournier Yeah,"Dicks Goods" could be taken wrong
@KamalaHarris *Load*
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump I hear Obama did some lying also. Heck, he even went on camera and told us so.
@BernieSanders Actually yes, the question is whether or not we can afford it. That's the same question every American family ask themselves everyday damn day when it comes to basic needs. It's about damn time or government and the same question instead of constantly going into more debt
@SenBlumenthal Good luck finding time with all of those investigations you guys will be doing
@RepMaloney Judging by statistics and your current push for more fun legislation, handgun violence hasn't ended has it? So much for common sense gun laws preventing gun violence huh?
@KamalaHarris So, having your article lost a little slower is a threat to free speech? What was it when we didn't have internet? Was free speech in jeopardy then?
@KamalaHarris Never we to much for that thing called the Constitution were you.
@CoryBooker And yet none regarding actual collusion. Great job Spartacus!
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Yeah, let's spend millions to investigate s deal that didn't happen. Tax dollars well spent. Almost right down to the bottom of the list with that Grant given to the people who found that kids won't eat food that's been sneezed on.
@SenSanders @Ocasio2018 If the results are anything like how the Dems "solved" the healthcare crisis, I'll pass
@SenBlumenthal Whatcha doing with all the others that have lied? Asking for those who are victims of your one sided hypocrisies.
@FrankPallone Then why are do many Democratic politicians running on the bed to make healthcare cheaper. I thought the ACA was doing that? How about those insurance provider pulling it off the act leaving people who have enrolled without insurance. Do those people matter to you?
@anntensity Dang it! They figured me out! https://t.co/EQF46rCYZw
@washingtonpost Not in Europe, just in case you weren't aware
@Surabees @MichaelAvenatti 10 years down the road...		"hey, remember that avenetto, avenn...",	 	"Oh, creepy porn lawyer guy?" 		"Yeah, him!"
@SteveScalise Has anyone told him "you didn't build that!", yet?
@NoahJ456 "not without dinner and a movie first"
@KamalaHarris You could just cut our taxes instead of taking more of our money just to give it back to us.
@elizabethforma @usedgov @Navient "Cheating students and trying to hide it". That's rich coming from you.
@SenGillibrand Then you should tell the parents to do immigration the right way.
@SenWhitehouse I missed the party where it says "come through stuff at us while coming through illegally"
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump My better vision has each of the Representatives and each senator required to sign up for Obamacare as it is instead of exempting themselves from it, knowing it's crap cone posing as a soft serve ice cream.
#RETWEET4GOOD https://t.co/TAK2sG9Ehv
@KamalaHarris I learned that when I stopped doing things that were against the law, I didn't have a fear of the consequences and didn't have to constantly look over my shoulder
@SenSchumer You literally just applauded Roberts for saying courts aren't political while saying he is political
@SenWarren @BetsyDeVosED 350000 dollars for teaching one class under the guise of being American Indian. Please, save your arguments against for profit anything.
@FrankPallone @EnergyCommerce Kinda like California's wrecked environmental policies that had killed hundreds in wildfires?
@SenWarren Yeah, now people who perform like I do on pot (worthless and lazy) will be able to be unproductive legally!!!!!
@SenGillibrand The ACA made it unaffordable for millions!! But please, let's let there government get involved some more
@nypost So now it's an issue?
@BernieSanders "FMLA"
@CuffyMeh I know this is wrong of me but I can't help myself. My mind totally went to  latest allegations against him when I read this and have it a completely different meaning
@ife_luv12 My first guitar
@SenFeinstein Or it could be held in a real court instead of having colleges find no wrong doing on part of the accused and still ruin his chances at other universities putting it out that,"oh yeah, he was accused of rape"
@LisaMarieBoothe @FNC_Ladies_Rule It has a little Scarlett Johansen to it.
@MonicaCrowley " hey guys, are we signing our free healthcare for all into Law over there? Can I join...er...."
The problem with Democrats yelling racism every 5 minutes. Pelosi has a possible African American Challenger for speaker. Does that mean if Pelosi wins, is it because of racism?
@SenSanders Dude, Hillary lobbied for your support with a private jet ride. Did it take you to your third house? Just curious Democratic Socialist, because there are people that are hungry and homeless while you enjoy being in the 1 percent you hypocritical Russia loving talking head
@SenSanders @RepRoKhanna Nothing like the government dictating everything in your life and business. But I would like to know the breakdown of that money. It's that picket profit or money that was used to pay business expenses and the such. Because last I checked, they weren't there richest in the world
@SenJeffMerkley And still no word from you on Rosenteins conflict with the Mueller probe and FISA apps, but please, continue
@KamalaHarris Improving lives of Americans? Does that include the three killed by an illegal alien after he was released after ignoring a detainer request? Of course not, I forgot I was talking to the lawmaker that didn't feel it necessary to pass Kate's Law.
@KamalaHarris Except for the illegal ones. Please say except for the illegal ones
@SenGillibrand Except for those crossing our borders illegally apparently
@SenSchumer Like the illegal aliens that gillium and Nelson were wanting to be counted in the election which would be against Florida's Constitution, or, any of them pretty much. Thought it was a joke that you want open borders for votes, guess it's real huh
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Rods relationship to the investigation is way tighter than Whittaker's, you didn't call for him to recuse himself... But I digress...
@marklevinshow I thought illegal aliens didn't vote in it elections?
@SenSanders Good way to not have to do any actual work, just re-introduce all of your previous bills again and again and again.... Then complain when it doesn't pass, because it won't work
RT @CRTV: .@BarackObama says he never lies; he just sticks to the "facts."		We knew the media wouldn't fact-check him, so we did it for the…
@SenJeffMerkley Panther party holding AKs and a Stacey A sign and you think an attempt to stop illegal activity at voting booth is suppression, will yes, suppress any illegal votes like it should be
@BernieSanders You literally spent your entire campaign dividing the nation into the 10 percent (oh wait, Bernie's a10 percenter now) 1 percent and the other 99. Demonizing monetarily successful people?
@MarkSimoneNY Bet you there's a lot of Google employees working overtime to make it so for Obama
@SenWarren Didn't the Dems try that while cheap, keep your plan and keep your doctor thing before? Didn't work very well if memory serves me right
Allegedly, if you enter into a bathroom with @CoryBooker , you should be ready to fight also https://t.co/caaQVsv0HZ
@elizabethforma Aren't you rich? Like, in the millions? Why don't you start dividing that up to us, you start with those thousand dollars crumbs and I'll be first in line
@KamalaHarris You don't want people to die by healthcare policies except for the killing of babies... Got it
@elizabethforma I'll give you 1/1024th of my vote
@SenWarren @SecretaryZinke 350,000 a year to teach one class and claiming you are Indian enough to be a minority.
@ChrisMurphyCT Yet the economy is better than under the president that said low to no growth was the new norm. Go figure.
@KamalaHarris I thought you were blaming tax breaks for there increased deficit, and now add more?
@SenSchumer You first. What do you think will come from your side of the aisle calling half the nation racist, deplorable, evil, and if people don't agree with you they have no place for peace in this country. All to justify aggression from the left you sorry disgrace for a leader and adult
@BernieSanders She should've pulled a Warren. 350k for teaching one class!
@BuckSexton Because they got the DNC memo not to
@RedPillBlackMan @TomServo4 @realDonaldTrump Desperate to stroke his ego? Scared to become irrelevant 2 years after leaving office?
@EricTrump I don't know what's scarier, her blatantly saying she will, or that people will think it's ok to do so
RT @CRTV: Allie starred in a new "ad" for the Democratic Party. We hope they like it!		Get more @conservmillen ==&gt; https://t.co/f6Lmpu9LhY…
@CoryBooker And we must believe all victims of sexual assault
@BernieSanders False
@KamalaHarris Didn't the ACA take away healthcare for some?
@KamalaHarris How will you pay for it?
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Now do the violence against the right
@SenSanders And some on the left have used rhetoric that has caused physical harm on multiple occasions to those who don't agree with their political views. Glad you got your brown shirts Dems!
@KamalaHarris How is it going to be paid for?
@SenBlumenthal Ethics? Remember what you said, false in one thing, false in everything? Your lies about Vietnam service makes everything you say irrelevant and empty, according to you.
@scrowder "where's the peanut butter!"
@clairecmc , why are you sueing someone for exposing what your campaign staffers/volunteers stated? Is truth not to be known? https://t.co/r8nShW68L2
@SenSanders Including the one where you honeymooned?
@KamalaHarris Gun safety, only put your finger on the trigger when you have obtained your target and are ready to fire. There, I didn't need to vote Democrat to learn gun safety
@SenSanders Dude, you honeymooned in a communist country and if you had your way, you would control all business, healthcare, higher taxes, ... We are talking about crossing the line into the definition of fascism.
@RepMaloney @MartinHeinrich Now do the deficits prior to the tax plan! I noticed they went down, then up, then up, then down, then up..... The everyday American can't sustain their life in this manner, why do all of you in Congress think we can sustain an entire country like this? Stop spending our money!!
@RepJeffries I thought the ACA was going to lower healthcare costs?
@RepLowenthal I thought the ACA did that? If you guys messed that up, why should we trust you with "Medicare for all"?
@RepAnnaEshoo As an adolescent, I always thought to myself, "I'm surprised government hasn't taxed the air we breath," and here we are...
@BernieSanders Isn't this the type of rhetoric that left @SteveScalise fighting for his life after one of your supporters shot up a ballfield yelling "this is for healthcare!" You're being a little irresponsible at the moment.
@SenWhitehouse @EPA Scientific fact is based on the ability of results being duplicated by other researchers. It's what makes it fact. Just to go by one published, "credible" study gives way for manipulation of the public. But I'm guessing you know this.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Kinda reminds me of when the previous administration cut loose kids into actual child snatchers hands and they were put to work in forced labor and the administration wouldn't or couldn't and didn't let social services check on the kids. Yeah, that happened
@SenatorMenendez Says a member of the party that Incorporated SS into the general budget.... Years later, it's no longer solvent like it should be
@DRUDGE_REPORT That's ok, 1 billion couldn't get one of them elected
@SenSchumer Didn't the ACA raise premiums to the point where it was cheaper to pay the penalty and go without coverage? And didn't people end up without actual coverage when companies pulled out of the ACA because it wasn't feasible for their company to be a part of?
@politicalelle *mental note-I need to learn to type with less vigour*
Don't worry Dems, the Calvary is coming! https://t.co/uH5smHxECv
@SenSchumer Can we start with not talking money out of my check for social security and Medicare? I'll take that money to an investment broker and make my own decisions for my money, thank you in advance!
@KamalaHarris It's not exactly affordable for a lot of people.
@SenKamalaHarris It's called, don't have sex until you are ready for the consequences of your choices, or maybe, excepting the consequences of your choices. It's called being responsible
@mazurkr @BernieSanders I'll definitely check it out, I don't mind challenging my beliefs and I'm always looking for information
@mazurkr @BernieSanders Sorry, that's not how it works. There government spending what it takes it. Anything over is why we have a debt.
@mazurkr @BernieSanders So Bernie wants to raise taxes to control income inequality. Good to know
@mazurkr @BernieSanders Taxes don't fund government spending? Uhmmm... I might not know everything but I know that's wrong.
@KamalaHarris I hear there are nearly 7 million jobs waiting for them
@BernieSanders Including your Medicare for all that would double the debt?

@RealMattCouch @TruthMatters13 Being a horrible candidate which helped get Trump elected!?!
@NBCNews I don't know what's worse, your misrepresentation to fit your "racist" narrative, or the fact that so many people take your word as gospel without fact checking you. Maybe it's the fact that news networks need to be fact checked. It's quite embarrassing.
If Kanye and Trump know nothing about politics and are"dumb"and "racist", what does that say about the Democrat party and MSM since they were Democrats before now?
