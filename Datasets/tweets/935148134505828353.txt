Thank you to all the past and present @DHSgov employees for your hard work, resilience, and sacrifice over the last 16 years. You are vital to maintaining a free, prosperous, and—most importantly—secure nation. #DHS16Anniversary https://t.co/xXaJWANbsG

Great discussion with @GLFOP leadership this afternoon. I appreciate the tireless work that the National Fraternal Order of Police does in protecting and defending our nation’s law enforcement officers. @DHSgov is eager to continue working together to keep America safe. https://t.co/9bzPQ2mZPE
Help @DHSgov detect and stop illicit opioids being trafficked into the U.S. through international mail by joining the Opioid Detection Challenge. We need your innovative ideas to help combat the opioid epidemic. Details on the $1.55 million challenge here: https://t.co/A3pYNv7Qwd
.@DHSgov is leveraging emerging technology from startup companies to safeguard our country - including through efforts like the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP). It was great to meet with SVIP and startup companies today. Your innovation is essential to homeland security!

I want to thank the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) for their leadership in combatting terrorist use of the Internet. Today, I joined GIFCT members and foreign allies to discuss how to stop terrorists from weaponizing the web. Great progress is being made.
@DHSgov and California will continue to work together on an “all threats, all hazards” approach to keeping communities safe.
I had a productive introductory meeting with @GavinNewsom today. We discussed ongoing collaboration on emergency preparedness, forest fire mitigation, cybersecurity, countering drug trafficking, and planning for emerging threats.
.@GovAbbott has been an incredible partner as we work to confront the ongoing humanitarian &amp; security crisis at our border. Today, we had a productive discussion on the situation and also explored ways to deepen our partnership in cybersecurity, emergency management, and more. https://t.co/GzSnOBiTwa
Thank you to our nation's governors who gathered this morning at the White House. I was joined by @BetsyDeVosED &amp; AG William Barr for a breakout session focused on improving school safety and helping our state partners keep their communities safe.
We commit to continuing to work with them to share information and provide technical analysis, risk modeling, and incident response support.
.@DHSgov serves as the hub of cyber and infrastructure security across the Federal government. We recognize DHS can only be successful if our private sector and state and local partners are successful.
Our adversaries and the cyber threats we face are evolving rapidly. @DHSgov is working more closely than ever with the private sector to defend our country. Thank you @bankpolicy for hosting me today. https://t.co/YiclGMRIOk
Thank you President Elect @nayibbukele for meeting with me in El Salvador. We had a productive meeting and discussed a myriad of issues of mutual interest. I look forward to continuing the close cooperation between our two nations when he takes office.
Grateful to President @sanchezceren for taking the time to discuss ways El Salvador &amp; the US can enhance our security cooperation. Thank you for welcoming me to the Presidential Palace &amp; for your partnership as we work to combat smuggling, trafficking, transnational crime &amp; more. https://t.co/rhlpjJSEcW
We have agreed to crack down on smugglers and traffickers who profit off of human misery, to strengthen border security, to counter organized crime and gangs, and to address the “root causes” of this humanitarian and security crisis for good.
Yesterday, I joined the Security Ministers from the Northern Triangle and their delegations to announce our decision to negotiate a historic agreement to reduce irregular migration. https://t.co/mh1HHfKJJt
I look forward to meeting with the Guatemalan Minister of Government Degenhart, Honduran Security Minister Julian Pacheco, and Salvadoran Minister of Justice and Public Security Mauricio Landaverde to discuss migration and security in the region.
Today, we have the opportunity to reflect on the legacies of our nation’s leaders—and on the powerful example they have set for us and the world. Happy #PresidentsDay.
This declaration will help us keep our most solemn obligation to the American people: to protect our homeland.
@POTUS is right to declare a national emergency to combat the serious humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Time &amp; again, Congress has failed to update outdated laws and to fully equip @DHSgov to confront human trafficking, gangs, drugs, &amp; illegal immigration.
My statement on funding for @DHSgov &amp; the National Emergency Declaration: https://t.co/s5brEqUGTH
Enjoyed meeting with the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force today. We had a constructive dialogue, and I look forward to deepening partnerships with law enforcement leaders to secure our communities. https://t.co/ZnFDyieQ4M
On the anniversary of the Parkland school shooting, @DHSgov extends our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of those we lost. The Department is committed to keeping schools safe and will continue to work with our state and local partners to prevent these tragedies.
Our approach begins with one word: Resilience. America’s main streets have become the front lines of new wars. @MjrCitiesChiefs @MCSheriffs It was a pleasure to meet with you and I look forward to a watershed year in deepening our collaboration to combat threats like never before https://t.co/VR7G6Nqf8X
Great to see so many sheriffs from across the country meeting to address shared challenges at the #NSAWinter2019. Thank you for your continued partnership as we aim to further strengthen our relationship in 2019. Together we can meet the threats of today and tomorrow. https://t.co/hrUZfmdRnx
.@USSOCOM &amp; @CENTCOM work hand-in-hand with @DHSgov to protect the homeland from foreign threats and bad actors. We appreciate the longstanding support we receive from @DeptofDefense. Great to meet with you all.
It was an honor to speak with agencies fighting to defend America against WMD threats, including our own @DHScwmd team, in Tampa today. I look forward to continued collaboration with @DeptofDefense to keep America safe from emerging threats.
Thanks to the investigation led by @SecretService agents in Lexington, KY, 20 individuals have been indicted, including 16 foreign nationals, and 13 have been extradited to the U.S. I applaud USSS &amp; our partners for catching these foreign fraudsters and identifying victims.
Cyber-enabled financial crimes devastate American communities &amp; @SecretService agents work every day to investigate them. For 4.5 years, USSS agents have worked with @TheJusticeDept and more than a dozen law enforcement agencies worldwide to investigate Operation Crypto Craig.
These brave men and women are taking the fight to transnational criminals and keeping our communities safe.
@VP and I had the privilege to meet with the crew of the @USCG Cutter Bear today. They will soon be departing for a counter-narcotics patrol in the Eastern Pacific supporting SOUTHCOM Combatant Command. https://t.co/BoHLGYe5uz
We were also privileged to address frontline personnel from @CBP, @ICEgov, @TSA, @USCG, and others in the DHS family who counter threats and protect our homeland every day.
Honored to host @VP today for a meeting with @DHSgov personnel of Joint Task Force-East and leaders of our other Joint Task Forces. https://t.co/VCSKphWe7d
Yesterday, the @USCG offloaded over 34,000 pounds of cocaine worth over $460 million. I commend them for their hard work on this very impressive accomplishment. https://t.co/269fxBWKGE
I applaud the men and women of @DHSgov, led by @SecretService, for leading efforts to protect and secure tonight’s #SOTU. Our dedicated employees’ service to this country and the American people is unmatched. Your country appreciates your sacrifice, talent, and work ethic!
Border security is not a partisan issue. @POTUS clearly laid out the urgent need to fully secure our southern border. Make no mistake, there is a humanitarian and security crisis that will continue to worsen if Congress fails to act.
Over the past week, the @DHSgov family has tragically lost four dedicated public servants. On behalf of the Department, we send our condolences &amp; prayers to the friends and families of the victims. You will always be part of the DHS family.
Protecting an event like #SBLIII is no small task. Twenty-five @DHSgov entities with nearly 600 personnel, led by @ICEgov, worked hand-in-hand with the @NFL and local law enforcement to secure this American tradition. Thank you for your hard work!
Human trafficking is a horrible form of modern day slavery that has hurt communities across America. @DHSgov is on the frontlines conducting operations to combat and end international &amp; domestic trafficking in addition to providing victims assistance. https://t.co/CMYY3O2uMr
Thank you @CBP for seizing the largest amount of fentanyl in history at the Nogales, AZ POE. Well done! @DHSgov needs the funding and resources from Congress to continue to protect our communities from dangerous drugs that come across our southern border. https://t.co/wfsFFKPaeE
Thank you to @ICEgov HSI for their continued commitment to stopping human trafficking and to care for the victims. Agents have made 33 arrests and rescued 4 victims in the last few days alone in Atlanta.
Thanks to the 25 @DHSgov entities, including nearly 600 homeland employees, &amp; the more than 500 personnel from federal partners for your dedicated work to further enhance the security of #SBLIII in support of local officials. DHS works hard so football fans can have fun.
Today I had the opportunity to join the @NFL and all our partners during a visit to the Joint Operations Center &amp; @MBStadium to discuss how we are working to ensure this weekend remains safe &amp; secure. https://t.co/4dgDZ5qCKO
.@DHSgov is proud to support local and state officials in the great city of Atlanta to secure #SBLIII.
Thank you @ICEgov for everything you do to keep our country safe. It was a pleasure meeting with the dedicated team in San Diego. You make us all proud https://t.co/Lk8I5MHhj6
18 months ago, @ICEgov HSI began their investigation into alleged fraudulent financial schemes by Huawei.  Today, @DHSgov and our federal partners indicted those we believe to be responsible. Thanks @ICEgov for keeping our country safe! https://t.co/R7vzJLTUzs
I look forward to working with Congress over the next three weeks to fully fund DHS and give us the tools and resources we need to do our jobs.
I want to thank everyone in the @DHSgov family for what you do every day to secure our homeland. Your focus, passion and commitment to our country is what makes DHS so strong!
Great to speak with @CISAgov employees today who work tirelessly to protect our nation from cyber threats and malicious actors. I want to thank @CISAKrebs and the rest of CISA’s leadership for carrying out their critical mission. https://t.co/GyH8a9YSxO
Human trafficking continues to plague our society and put vulnerable populations at risk. @ICEgov is committed to ending this type of modern day slavery. https://t.co/Kp0cKjK1HU
.@ICEgov arrested 1,588 alleged human traffickers last year, stopping the abuse of thousands of innocent victims. Proud to serve with the men and women of HSI during Human Trafficking Month. https://t.co/LjNWr8QROT
In FY18 alone, @ICEgov conducted over 800 investigations, made roughly 1,500 arrests, and reported more than 500 convictions related to human trafficking. ICE HSI also identified and assisted 308 victims of human trafficking. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessMonth
.@ICEgov is a leader in combatting transnational organizations engaged in human trafficking. Thank you ICE HSI for the outstanding work you do each day to protect victims, prosecute offenders, and prevent trafficking from occurring.
To reiterate – being part of an unlawful migrant caravan does not provide you special protections or rights to enter the United States. Please seek legal entry at a Port of Entry.
We are seeing increasingly large groups of families cross our border illegally. The humanitarian crisis continues. @DHSgov must be provided the resources and authorities to address this new population flow.
...responding to historic natural disasters, countering the threat from weaponized drones and organizing the Department for long-term success to counter cyberattacks.
Since @POTUS took office, @DHSgov has protected the homeland by increasing the vetting of those coming into the country, raising the baseline on aviation security, tackling the security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border,...
.@USCG national security cutter just deployed to the Western Pacific in support of @INDOPACOM. I thank the men and women of USCG, and their families, who continue to support our national security mission.  It is time for Congress to do its job and pay our military now. https://t.co/hxAWWD4zVc
Today, we honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His lifelong commitment to justice and equality for all Americans will always be remembered.
Congratulations to our newly naturalized American citizens. The U.S. is the most welcoming nation in the world. These new citizens joined 756,000 others who were naturalized and the 1.1 million who became LPRs last year - making our country stronger. https://t.co/bsYL9yBmeA
I stand ready to work with and urge members of Congress to quickly pass legislation that fully funds the government and provides @DHSgov with the funding and resources we need.
The proposal announced by @POTUS is a compromise that will help secure our southern border, address the humanitarian crisis and provide protections to DACA and TPS recipients.
Our condolences go out to those who lost their lives in Mexico yesterday. @DHSgov stands ready to assist the first responders and the Mexican Government in any way possible.
Thank you @USCG for admirably serving your nation. America is safer and more secure thanks to your commitment, hard work and dedication. I am honored to serve as your Service Secretary as you protect the homeland and execute vital missions as part of America’s Armed Forces. https://t.co/WnUtQFo2kz
A special thanks to the courageous men and women of @SecretService who are on the cutting edge of stopping financial and cybercrimes across the globe. https://t.co/3qvW91y513
.@DHSgov has warned about the violence of these new “caravans.” Like recent ones, this caravan in Honduras has already violently attempted to illegally enter Guatemala. We stand with the two countries who are trying to prevent illegal immigration and violence inside the caravan.
It was great visiting with and thanking the men and women of @TSA who are working tirelessly, and without pay, to secure our airports and transportation systems. On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you for what you do every day to secure our country. https://t.co/qji9EdJtFq
.@ICEgov Cyber Crimes Center is at the cutting edge of combatting internet crime such as child exploitation and the darkweb’s illicit drug trade. Thank you ICE HSI for working with our partners across the globe to rescue over 1700 exploited children over the past two years. https://t.co/XdFgyBwdBa
The Department of Homeland Security and the US Secret Service are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union. We thank the Service for their mission focus and dedication and for all they do each day to secure our homeland.
We need a strong physical barrier, additional detention space, increased technology at ports of entry, critical humanitarian assistance, and additional agents, officers, immigration judges and attorneys.
.@POTUS proposal is a direct result of what our frontline operators – Border Patrol Agents and ICE officers – tell us they need to secure the border.
Of the 31,754 UACs from the Northern Triangle (out of 41,000 UACs total) apprehended in FY 2017, 98 percent remain in the country today. Last year, 60,000 UACs entered our country. #HumanitarianCrisis
When all is said and done, removal for Northern Triangle unaccompanied alien children almost never happens due to outdated laws.
Recently in Mexico, a group of 159 Central American migrants – including women and children – were rescued after being kidnapped and held ransom by a criminal organization on the journey north. As I have said repeatedly, smugglers and criminal organizations are not humanitarians.
.@DHSgov is closely monitoring the new caravan heading north. To be clear - participation in a caravan does not grant you a special status or provide you special treatment.
Like the other branches of the U.S. military, active duty @USCG should be paid for their service and sacrifice to this nation. I’m working with the @WhiteHouse and Congress to pass legislation to fund the @USCG now.
Our homeland isn’t secure unless our hometowns are secure. Check out my op-ed in this month’s Police Chief Magazine. Thanks to @TheIACP for publishing and MY SINCERE THANKS to frontline defenders in law enforcement for protecting America. https://t.co/miWafIqwWa

They continue to serve their nation and keep us secure. I will continue to work day and night to reach a solution that pays DHS employees and ends the crisis on our border.
THANK YOU to the thousands of men &amp; women of @DHSgov who, because of a failure of Congress to act, will not be paid today but who continue to keep us safe. Seventy-three percent of DHS employees are working without pay during the “shutdown.”
Thank you @VP for visiting @CBP &amp; for your leadership in working w Congress to secure our nation. The “manufactured crisis” is the refusal of many in Congress to pay the men &amp; women of @DHSgov &amp; help end the security &amp; humanitarian crisis on our border. https://t.co/RWxUYnTHUa
A heartfelt THANK YOU to all of the professional and dedicated law enforcement officers throughout @DHSgov. America appreciates your service to our country! #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay

These are *the* facts. And we need a secure border to protect our country https://t.co/LZjuCAK4yH
What’s more, last year at our Southern Border @DHSgov encountered more than 3,000 Special Interest Aliens – individuals with suspicious travel patterns who may pose a national security threat.
Thousands of terror-watchlisted individuals transit our hemisphere each year, and we work with law enforcement, the intel community, and allies to keep them from using illicit pathways to reach the U.S.
I am sure all Americans would agree that one terrorist reaching our borders is one too many. These are just the terror suspects we know about who reach our border.
The threat is real. The number of terror-watchlisted encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive and details about these cases are extremely sensitive.
The Administration is committed to addressing the humanitarian and security crisis at our borders. Business as usual &amp; the status quo simply won’t work in a crisis. We are now working from common facts and I look forward to further discussions tomorrow. https://t.co/wcMVvs9BFO
Americans can see for themselves the facts about the security &amp; humanitarian crisis at the border. Kicking the can down the road is not an option. Congress needs to act NOW to end the crisis. I’ll be working all weekend w the team to reach a deal. https://t.co/ypcDU5bBXR
The crisis is not going away-it is getting worse. The status quo in funding &amp; authorities for #DHS is irresponsible &amp; makes our country less secure. Kicking the can down the road is not the answer. I look forward to engaging w Members who want to listen &amp; be part of the solution.
I am disappointed that Dems did not want to hear from @DHSgov about the security &amp; humanitarian crisis we are facing at the border. They didn’t want to hear about criminal aliens, drug smugglers, smuggled &amp; abused children or violent caravans trying to breach the border wall.
We will always be grateful for his dedication to our country’s security. On behalf of the 250K men and women of the DHS, I thank him and Karen for their service to our nation. We look forward to working w Acting COS Mulvaney as we continue to focus on the President's priorities.

At today’s Cabinet Meeting, @POTUS again reiterated his strong commitment to border security. During this shutdown the men and women of DHS remain on duty doing their jobs. Congress should do theirs &amp; fund the wall and revise outdated laws (TVPRA &amp; Flores) to secure the border.
We thank him for his stalwart protection of our great nation and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.  We look forward to working with Acting Secretary Shanahan @DepSecDef and continuing the great collaboration between our two departments.
General Mattis has served our nation honorably both overseas and at home for 44 years.  @DHSgov appreciates his leadership and partnership in supporting our shared missions of cybersecurity, disaster response and recovery, and border security.... https://t.co/Ejqr2mHXzY
We are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis on the border. We continue to see an increase of children arriving illegally w illnesses. I have engaged USCG, HHS, DOD, and CDC but Congress must amend the TVPRA and end the Flores agreement to address the root causes of this crisis.
Many thanks to the thousands of law enforcement officers around the country who ensured New Year’s Eve celebrations were safe for millions of Americans. Thank you for your steadfast service.
I want to thank Chairman @RepGoodlatte for his service leading the @HouseJudiciary Cmte. I was honored to testify yesterday to discuss the important work that @DHSgov is doing &amp; was encouraged that many members fully support DHS and our efforts to secure and defend all Americans.
Today @POTUS signed into law the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018, which will strengthen @DHSgov ability to guard America against terrorist and nation-state threats from WMDs.  I want to thank the Members of Congress who helped make this happen. #CWMD
The United States of America is committed to affording aliens rights under the law, including access to counsel, but we will no longer allow a free pass into the United States.
Over the last 5 years, @DHSgov has seen a 2000% increase in aliens claiming credible fear who’ve been placed in expedited removal, this new policy will allow those w worthy asylum claims the opportunity for their claims to be heard quicker &amp; weed out frivolous/fraudulent claims
Starting now, @DHSgov is implementing Migrant Protection Protocols #MPP which may require aliens who enter from MX &amp; claim asylum to remain in MX throughout immigration proceedings. 90% of asylum claims are NOT granted by a judge. We want to help those who truly need it.
For far too long, our terrible laws and bad judicial rulings have forced the United States to allow illegal aliens to live and work in our country while years-long immigration proceedings roll on. That ends today. #MPP

Given the activities of the last 24 hours at the #SanYsidro POE, I wanted to provide an update on what occurred and attempt to dispel many of the rumors and much of the misinformation circulating. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/bXFFTLrNIl
Today @CBP personnel were struck by projectiles thrown by caravan members. Such actions are dangerous &amp; not consistent w peacefully seeking asylum. The perpetrators will be prosecuted. I will continue to aggressively support DHS personnel as they work to safely secure our border.
#CBP along with other #DHS, federal, state &amp; local law enforcement, &amp; the @DeptofDefense, have a robust presence along the SW Border and at our POEs. We remain in close contact with Mexican authorities and are committed to resolving this situation safely in concert with them.
.@DHSgov will not tolerate this type of lawlessness &amp; will not hesitate to shut down POEs for security reasons. We'll seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our sovereignty.
This AM, @CBP was forced to close the #SanYsidro POE to ensure public safety in response to a large # of migrants seeking to illegally enter the US. They attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border &amp; sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles @ them

The events of 9/11 took place seventeen years ago. Out of that day @DHSgov was created to protect and defend the homeland from all threats. Today I was at the @Sept11Memorial to speak on how government &amp; private sector are working together to protect our nation. https://t.co/0BedjCEQQo
Unfortunately, some members of the caravan are purposely causing disruptions at our border ports of entry. There is a legal and illegal way to enter the US. We have deployed additional forces to protect our border. We will enforce all our laws.
.@CBP and @DeptofDefense appropriately responded by blocking the lanes, deploying additional personnel and seeking assistance from other law enforcement and federal assets. #CBP has reopened lanes for legitimate trade and travel. I want to thank them for their swift actions. https://t.co/eJVVuAs0w6
This AM, all of #SanYsidro Port of Entry's northbound lanes were temporarily closed to initiate additional port hardening efforts after @CBP officials were notified that a large # of caravan migrants were planning to rush the border in an attempt to gain illegal access to the US.

Traveling as a ‘caravan’ does not afford you any different or additional rights at our ports of entry. We will fully enforce our border and immigration laws.
To all members of the caravan seeking asylum, Mexico has offered protection and benefits to all who qualify. To all others, please heed our warning and turn around.
.@DHSgov stands with our Mexican partners as both countries work to ensure safe, orderly and legal migrant flows. The violence at Mexico’s southern border is unacceptable. We stand with the Mexican Government and will not tolerate violence at either of our southern borders.
My heart goes out to all those affected by the tragic shooting in Pittsburgh, PA. @DHSgov is working closely with our federal partners and local law enforcement to assist in every way possible.

.@DHSgov has worked to secure our border – we are catching in record numbers those who attempt to illegally enter but are hampered on being able to remove. Congress must end “catch &amp; release” immediately.
I have been in constant contact with my foreign counterparts in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. Closely monitoring developments and providing any requested assistance.
.@DHSgov will continue to support our Mexican partners as they take steps to confront the crisis on their southern border. The Mexican Federal police are handling this in a professional and humane manner.
Grateful to spend time today with the men and women of @NPPD. They are defending our elections, digital networks, critical infrastructure, government sites, and much more! Our nation is safer because you stay a step ahead of the bad guys. #CyberAware
I’d like to thank the hardworking men and women of @CBP for confronting these challenges with professionalism, determination, and compassion day in and day out.
Ultimately, the solution is in the hands of Congress. If they don’t act to close loopholes and fully fund the wall, our hands will remain tied, smugglers and traffickers will continue to exploit people for profit, and our homeland will be less secure.
For those attempting to illegally enter as part of any ‘caravan’, please know we will enforce our border security laws and that the United States will use every available measure to prevent your illegal entry.
I have been calling my foreign counterparts again today to notify them that we expect decisive action regarding irregular migrant “caravans,” that inaction will not be tolerated, and to warn that illegal entry into the US is a crime.
The strong partnership of @USCG, @fema, and all of @DHSgov with state and local emergency officials during both #HurricaneMichael and #HurricaneFlorence reiterates the importance of planning ahead and being ready when disaster strikes.

Since @DHSgov’s creation fifteen years ago, we have been learning how to best protect the American people, and that includes keeping our children safe in schools. Today, I'm hosting the 5th Federal Commission on School Safety meeting with @usedgov @TheJusticeDept and @HHSGov.
At @DHSgov, we continue to work closely with all 50 states and nearly 1,000 local election officials throughout the country by offering a range of voluntary services to help identify and shore up any weaknesses in their election systems.		https://t.co/7eNH9IdPnE
It bears repeating		Any attempt to interfere in our elections is a direct attack on our democracy and will not be tolerated. Ensuring the security of our electoral process is a vital national interest and one of our highest priorities as citizens in a democratic society.
Today @DHSgov hosted the "Tabletop the Vote" exercise on election security to bring the election community together to test our ability to respond to cyber incidents that could occur on Election Day &amp; build strong incident response plans across the country https://t.co/7eNH9IdPnE
#Cybersecurity is a top priority of @DHSgov, and I applaud @CBP_McAleenan‘s leadership. @CBP is taking significant steps to incorporate cybersecurity into its core missions, and recognizing the direct link between strong cybersecurity and mission readiness. https://t.co/7uQFKyIc20
I'm excited to visit Atlanta today to address the trade community at @CBP’s 2018 Trade Symposium. CBP serves a vital role in the economic prosperity of our great nation. On a typical day last year, CBP processed $6.5B worth of imported goods.  That’s $4.5M a minute.
Today, I met with @CAL_FIRE, @Cal_OES and first responders to survey the damage caused by the #CarrFire. @DHSgov and @fema are working with our state and local partners to help disaster survivors. Thank you for protecting and assisting your fellow Americans. https://t.co/B5O2vsnFDW

I will work tirelessly until our broken immigration system is fixed, our borders are secure and families can stay together.
Thank you @housegop for meeting with @POTUS and administration officials this evening - now is the time to pass a bill that closes dangerous immigration loopholes, keeps families together and secures the border.
Congress can fix these problems. Instead of criticizing those of us who uphold our oaths by enforcing the laws Congress drafted, work with us to change them. There will be legislation in the House this week that will address this issue and close the loopholes. Let’s solve it.
We will not apologize for enforcing the laws passed by Congress. We are a nation of laws. We are asking Congress to change the laws.
Congress please act so that we can secure our borders and uphold our humanitarian ideals. The two missions should not be pitted against each other. If we close the loopholes we can accomplish both.
Like previous Administrations, we refer many individuals who cross the border illegally for prosecution. Crossing in that manner is against US law.
Surely it is the beginning of the unraveling of democracy when the body that makes the laws - rather than change them- asks the body charged with law enforcement to not enforce the law. That simply cannot be the answer. Congress must act.
I will not stand by while our immigration system continues to deteriorate. We need real solutions which can only be accomplished through changing the law. I urge Congress to act.

DHS takes very seriously its duty to protect minors in our temporary custody from gangs, traffickers, criminals and abuse.
For those seeking asylum at ports of entry, we have continued the policy from previous Administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger, there is no custodial relationship between 'family' members, or if the adult has broken a law.
We do not have a policy of separating families at the border.  Period.
You are not breaking the law by seeking asylum at a port of entry.
This misreporting by Members, press &amp; advocacy groups must stop. It is irresponsible and unproductive. As I have said many times before, if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry.

This Administration will not support any deal that doesn't include the framework or fails to include the recommendations made by frontline operators on the authorities and tools they need to do the job Americans have asked them to do.
The proposal from Senators @ChuckGrassley , @JohnCornyn, et al would meet these four pillars and deserves the support of those who are serious about securing our borders and solving #DACA.
Under @POTUS leadership we are looking for a proposal that addresses the compromise WH framework that secures the border, ends chain migration, ends the visa lottery, and provides a permanent solution for #DACA.

Congress must find a legislative fix that secures our borders &amp; upholds the integrity of our immigration system. I will not support an agreement that prevents our front line personnel from doing the job they were hired to do.
@WhiteHouse While securing our borders - which includes the ability to quickly return people we apprehend - we need to ensure that we are also strengthening and promoting a strong American economy.

Spoke via phone with @NYCMayor &amp; @NYPDONeill this am on NYC attempted terrorist attack. https://t.co/JxjwGFyMkL
But they should know this: Americans will not be coerced by terrorism, and we will not  allow it to become the new normal.  We will fight back aggressively and bring terrorists to justice.
We urge the public to remain vigilant &amp; report any suspicious activity. The administration continues to adopt significant security measures to keep terrorists from entering our country and from recruiting within our borders. The enemy we face is persistent &amp; adaptive.
DHS is taking appropriate action to protect our people &amp; our country in the wake of today’s attempted terrorist attack in NYC. We will continue to assist New York authorities with the response &amp; investigation. 1/2 https://t.co/MLQVbl8JFg
