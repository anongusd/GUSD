@KingHenry_2 please do something with that hairdo. You definitely need a new barber buddy.
@KingHenry_2 @10AJMcCarron baker mayfield should have won the trophy. It's now known the voting is rigged. But that's ok, OU national title
@KingHenry_2 enjoy that moment while you can because Baker Mayfield will be taking the real trophy home, the national title. So don't cry.
@HeismanTrophy @KingHenry_2 Heisman legacy tarnished forever. We now know it's rigged. Baker Mayfield was the best and should have won
@AlabamaFTBL enjoy the moment because the real deal, baker mayfield, will be coming to take that national title trophy home.
@espn @NissanUSA Heisman Legacy tarnished forever. Baker Mayfield was the best player in the country.
@cnnbrk a joke. The best player baker mayfield was left out. The Heisman legacy tarnished forever.
@Andy_Staples @si_ncaafb it's rigged and a joke. The best player was baker mayfield and he was shafted. Heisman legacy tarnished forever.

@dannykanell absolutely. Mayfield is playing better than most anyone right now. If you haven't watched this gutsy kid then you don't know.
@DeanBlevins what is going on with the Sooners. They have gone ultra conservative and stopped trying to win.
@BUFootball as Kirk said. Baylor is bush league and unethical. They should be ashamed of themselves.
@OU_Football we must score.
@SoonerFootball we are giving the game away. What's going on.We went into conservative mode and trying to run run up the middle.Let baker go
@uoklasports Sooners are letting off the gas and letting Baylor back in the game. They went conservative.
@OU_Football you can't run run pass every time.
@SoonerScoop that was helmet on helmet. Should have been targeting.
@DeanBlevins Sooners are giving the game away.
@cbfowler let's give the Sooners some love and not be pro Baylor.
