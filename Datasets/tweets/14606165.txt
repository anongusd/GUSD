Back from Atlanta. So great seeing @Raychiller and her husb. and @twotoneatl & @Drbabyguns. And thx for the warm weather (comparatively)!
@Raychiller Got to see some of that on two different walls of my house. MacGyver fix: Sidwalk salt in Nylons on the roof. For serious.
@Raychiller At brunch, remind me to tell you about the joys of ice dams... http://bit.ly/faomn7
@Raychiller We have a sling if the stroller doesn't work out. We'll pay for messing w/ his sleep, tho! #joysofparenting
We get to take MARTA to a station near our friends' house tonight on account of ice roads. Never been on public transit w/ a baby.
@Raychiller That's so MacGyver!
@Raychiller The CSR at Airtran was talking about using table salt to help w/ the ice on the roads.  Made me chuckle :)

@julieannwarner translation: I'm so dorky/empassioned I set up MSWord to delete all dbl-spaces in a document at the push of a button.
@kmskala I've met a few in my time. @julieannwarner Extent of my dislike 4 dbl-spaces: I created a script in MSWord to delete them in a doc
@kmskala @julieannwarner Forgive me for my passionate tweet. It's proportionate fonts that negate the need for double spaces, not WPs.
@kmskala I did. Is that old school? I'm very passionate about double spaces after periods. Also, spaces before colons.
@julieannwarner Word processors auto-insert extra space and Web Browsers/HTML ignore them automatically (which I love) - cc@kmskala
