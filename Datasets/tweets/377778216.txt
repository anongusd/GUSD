Video of that part https://t.co/fXnoMm531T
Klobuchar asked about endorsing free college for all from a recent graduate.	She says she wants to make it easier to refinance these loans, extend more pell grants. Says she's not for free four-year college. "If I was a magic genie and we could afford that, I would."
Video of that exchange: https://t.co/MCGD6HCH63
"Have I pushed people too hard? Yes but I have kept expectations for myself that are very high," Klobuchar says when asked about reports of staff mistreatment.
Asked a follow up on it from Don Lemon, she says M4A is something we can look to for the future. "We have to start somewhere....it could be a possibility in the future."
Klobuchar is asked point blank "why can't we have Medicare for All....what makes us the exception?"	She responds: "What we need is to expand coverage so that people can have a choice for a public option and that's a start." Mentions support for @brianschatz' Medicaid bill

Oprah presses: "What's it going to take?" And O'Rourke says "For me, it will really be family.” Oprah responds "Where's Amy," and the crowd laughs

He says there is nothing Democrats could do to change his mind and run in their primary. Specifically cites not wanting a 70 percent income tax

Another protester screams “health care is a human right!” At Schultz
Schultz keeps saying that the election is decided by 8 states and he wants a contest where all 50 have a role. He says if he ran as a Democrat he’d have to be “disingenuous,” citing having to support Medicare for All, jobs guarantee and free college
RT @xenocryptsite: I mean among...people at his own book talk. https://t.co/19nIP7y30U

Schultz draws applause in New York mind you for saying he wants to run as a “centrist independent.”
He gets taken out by security. Also says “go back to getting ratioed on Twitter!”
Schultz still says he’s considering. A msn screams “don’t help elect Trump, go back to Davos!!!”

Identifiers of “electability” are no longer strictly reserved for candidates who compromise
What that means in practical terms is the baseline Democratic voter is going to be more open to left policy ideas because they’re excited about the prospect of anyone being against Trump
Lot of 2020 coverage frames “electability” vs. “left ideas” as if importance of defeating Trump for voters will outweigh any ideological differences. But there’s more evidence that Trump antipathy is fueling broader acceptance of left ideas rendering that binary flawed.

Cruz deployed the first "as the father of daughters" while talking about the Santa Fe shooting
O'Rourke calls for Dr. Ford to have an FBI investigation and says "Judge Kavanaugh has a troubling history in agreeing that Roe v. Wade is the decided law of the land."
"I believe Texans want constitutionalists on the Supreme Court," Cruz says citing presidential results in 2016. Tries linking O'Rourke to Clinton and writing out the 2nd Amendment from the Constitution.
Cruz asked about Kavanaugh and Ford's testimony: "I very much hope Dr. Ford comes next week." "The allegations she's raised are serious"
Cruz turns back to kneelers as disrespecting the flag. Says Dr. King did not stand for "burning the flag."
O'Rourke asked about NFL kneeling: "When now, we have injustice in this country, two sets of justice systems....too many unarmed African-American men losing their lives in this country. To prick the conscience....there's nothing more American than that."

Cuomo prevails but seven challengers, including a DSA member, knock off incumbent state senators including 6 of 8 IDCers. “The IDC is dead," went the declaration at the Nixon event tonight. https://t.co/VjCByW4K8G

"The threat to our democracy doesn't just come from Donald Trump, the current Republican congress," Obama says also listing the Koch brothers and Russian hacking. Says the biggest threat is "cynicism."
"You cannot sit back and wait for a savior," Obama says. "We don't need a messiah, all we need are decent honest hardworking people who are accountable"
"History shows the power of fear and the closer that we get to election day, the more those invested in the politics of fear and division, will do anything to hang on to their recent gains."
"We're supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers. How hard can that be, saying that Nazis are bad?" Obama says
Obama references the Trump tweet about Sessions and Justice Department indicting Hunter and Collins before the election
Obama shouts out policy ideas in @SenWarren's anti-corruption package
"What happened to the Republican party?" Obama says referencing them cozying up to Putin
"None of this is conservative. I don't mean to pretend I'm channeling Abraham Lincoln now, but that's not what he had in mind, I think, when he helped form the Republican party. It's a vision that says the protection of our power and those that back us is all that matters."
"They'll promise to clean up corruption then plunder away," Obama says in a clear reference to Trump.
"When there's a vacuum in our democracy, when we don't vote, when we take our basic rights and freedoms for granted, when we turn away and stop paying attention and stop engaging and stop believing and look for the newest diversion, then other voices fill the void," Obama says
Talking about the economy, Obama says "let's remember when this recovery started."
"It did not start with Donald Trump, he is a symptom not the cause," Obama says. "He's just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years."
"Ordinary people fought and marched and mobilized and built and yes, voted to make history," @BarackObama says. "There's always been a darker aspect to America's story. Progress doesn't always move in a straight line."
Sorry missed a word there "More dire."
"This moment really is different. The stakes really are higher. The consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more," Obama continues.
"I'm here to deliver a single message which is you need to vote because our democracy depends on it"
Obama: "I'm here today because this is one of those pivotal moments where every one of us as citizens of the United States need to determine who we are."

Carper easily wins and will likely go on to be 14 for 14 in Delaware in November and serve his fourth Senate term https://t.co/s3VFGtY7pp
Harris camp was anticipating low turnout could get em over the hump with around 26K votes. She got more than that but Carper hit 50K
Carper cleared 50,000 votes which is more than he got in the 2012 primary
72% reporting:	Carper: 37,449 votes (63.9%)	Harris: 21,152 (36.1%)		Harris has lost this but a first time candidate earning 36 percent of the vote against a guy in politics for 42 in the state is notable
