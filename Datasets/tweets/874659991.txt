@POTUS @EricHolder you call the Trump administration corrupt? Can you recall fast &amp; furious, uranium, Chris Stevens/Glen Doherty/Tyrone Woods/Sean Smith? Not to mention getting caught with Russia in your pockets...collusion from killery and your hypocrite boss. You are stupid eh!

@Marty01081 In their own country, if they do this they would be fired upon with no regard to human life or political backfall.  What our troops do will be with heavy hearts.  We have the best people in the world serving our country, God Bless and keep them safe
@Marty01081 Sorry, last one. It does break my heart. But it also breaks my heart that no one comes to this country to help our down trodden. 	God bless your daughter for having the big heart and being able to see it without turning back.  That takes a special person with a big heart,
@Marty01081 Not to mention that if the country they are fleeing from is so bad, why wave the flag of that country?  If they are as unruly as they have been on the way, imagine the mob protests that will ensue. I'm sure the lawyers at the border have their voter cards pre-filled out.
@Marty01081 Mucho Stupido 13 is mixed in.  Women &amp; children get raped. Some are oppressed, but how does a sudden surge of desire for asylum suddenly pop up?  How do impoverished people get a message to forge forward? And Funding? In the midst of it all is a really obese woman....oppressed?
@Marty01081 Sir Yes Sir! (red faced thank you)
@Marty01081 Yes, I hope they find and jail soreass and take away media and phone rights. That somebody would arrange this for political points is sad and disgusting.
A woman who came to this country legally calls this an act of war; I agree. They are aggressing toward our country and forcing their way in, what else would that be called?  I believe soreass should be put on the most wanted list as this is his work with killery pointing the way. https://t.co/6YC1jZIQZn
@POTUS 	To shut the trap of our former dictator and thief, get military personnel from times he or killery took photo ops overseas. They only stopped to pose snubbing our personnel. 	Don’t let him bring out your tweets, he’ll try to outsmart you but his IQ is no match for yours!

@guypbenson Great job on Martha today Guy. I am conservative, and a woman, and I believe Justice Kavanaugh was put through the ringer because the dums don't care who they destroy to prevent democracy from being honest in its path.
leslie marshall is full of it.	The dums keep saying we will lose interest when we are no longer riled by their shenanigans....PROVE THEM WRONG CONSERVATIVES. GET THE VOTES OUT FOR CONSERVATIVES.
I am a woman, Conservative and blessed.  I believe Justice Kavanaugh is good; I don't believe the revenge seeking bimbo.  He was the judge on her mothers case.  That should have been brought to light immediately! You can tell by the rings around her neck that she loves alcohol. https://t.co/avrFYAcFS0

@DebraMessing you STFU. @SusanSarandon has the right to say what she feels. It is most likely not what I feel, but it’s her right as an American, and might I add A MUCH BETTER ACTRESS with more class than you hold in that big nose of yours. There is no monopoly on free speech.
Are there really people ignorant enough to watch people’s hands on TV so they can find hidden messages?  If you can see my hand right now you’d get it right for the 1st time.
Jennifer rubin-Fact, people only die once except in rare cases. Pres Trump is the 1st Pres to keep his word w/respect to, and addition to Israel.

Did anybody else find it "hill"arious that killery quoted the scriptures? The woeman has broken more commandments than her husband Beelzebub himself!  And the man who has been reading the scriptures since he was a kid...he didn't look like a kid, yet had to read his notes!

@LeslieMarshall @foxnewsnight @ShannonBream @FoxNews @FLOTUS @TuckerCarlson @FoxNewsInsider You should know her name as well, Heather D Heyer. I do not know if she is the one of which you speak, but I do know that you should know her name if you refer to her in such a manor.  That woman just seems uncaring!
@LeslieMarshall @foxnewsnight @ShannonBream @FoxNews @FLOTUS @TuckerCarlson @FoxNewsInsider Everyone counts, just the amount of crap we are going through is not the same as the amount you put up with, or do Representative Steve Scalise, Matt Mika, Zack Barth, Officers Griner and Baily and Rep.

@LeslieMarshall @foxnewsnight @ShannonBream @FoxNews @FLOTUS @TuckerCarlson @FoxNewsInsider I am watching! Bullshit, you did not see this kind of violence in the oshithead side.  Most of us just counted the hours away until he went away...which he refuses to do.  I served 29.5 years in the Army and never knew the level of disrespect odumass showed our service personnel.

@seanhannity Just watched the montage of the day, one of the Crap News Ntwk guests stated re: historical, "just because it has not happened before doesn't mean it is historical."  Excuse me, is that not the very definition of historical? It has now happened and is historical!

@ARVershbow @realDonaldTrump You are aware this is the 1st of many meetings?  You people are critical of everything President Trump does, yet with each move he Trumps the opponent (just ask killery "what happened?").  His tactics, unconventional yet successful.

@therealroseanne There is going to be a lot of hypocrites coming out against you.  The fact is I get called red neck names a lot by people of color, and I am Native American.  I am buying a house soon and if you ever need a hideout I will give you the keys to my house!
@therealroseanne A conservative is harshly punished for a truly bad tweet, gives a genuine apology &amp; not given 1inch, yet not funny comedienne holds up a bloody replica of the US Pres head/condescending apology-she is given a slap on both wrists! hellywood is full of hypocrites!
I do not know why I was blocked and forced to allow google to access my privacy. I have made it my mission not to be associated with them and am wondering what this means.
@sanitycheck99 @therealroseanne Theatrical image...the parents could have become legal citizens or stayed home.
@OzarkFool @donna_gardner @mitchellvii donna guy didn't read the tweet right or she would not be arguing with a dumasscrat tweet that Mr. Mitchell quoted...I suspect Mr. Mitchell knew they (libs) would argue just to argue when he posted it.
@mcoop69 @sgraffwriter @MohanadElshieky @DonaldJTrumpJr They have that blind eye towards their obutthead!  He is so corrupt they have not found a file room large enough for his crap.  The best thing I can say is it is a waste of time to respond to people who have hash tag resist on their desc.  They are promoting law breaking.
@sgraffwriter @MohanadElshieky @DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe you should try and run a country while being held down by killery's press world.  He is not stifling the mouths of those idiots, he is getting the honesty to come out of their ignorant mouths!
@MohanadElshieky @DonaldJTrumpJr That is not what the wahwah libs want to hear.  The President could go to Saudi &amp; tell them it is not right and he won't do bus. with him, but then the wahwah libs will say "he doesn't know what he is doing; he is going to get us into war!" Damned if...you run for President then!
@MohanadElshieky @DonaldJTrumpJr The President's motto is Make AMERICA Great Again, not make other countries great again. , but that isn't what libs want to hear. If you go to a strangers house and tell them how to run it I you will not have a positive outcome. If you lead by example you get good results.

@WayneDupreeShow ALSO....the President is not separating the child from their parents; the parents are! "dreamers" had time to take care of their paperwork. Had they done so their dreams would not be my nightmares!
@WayneDupreeShow Alyssa, it's easy for you to say let them in/stay; your home is protected. Move them to your area then the people who are subject to their crimes will sleep better. And this is not profiling-they are already breaking the law otherwise they would be called AMERICANS!	Charmed

@Snapple2Apple @RedisRight1969 @XtalSays @NJAH04 @Steve342423 @therealroseanne Cause no person of color ever did anything wrong?

Once you understand all history, use your education to change things.
@Snapple2Apple @RedisRight1969 @XtalSays @NJAH04 @Steve342423 @therealroseanne Another yawn! Damn, live for today. My people got invaded, murdered and some bands gone to extinction.

@soulscarred71 @thehill Fact it: they chose to do the crime. There are some that got a bad deal and for them I feel bad. Work in the prison system and help them out
@soulscarred71 @thehill They have jobs, a store, indigent funds, daily meals, gym and most have cable tv-they just don't have freedom.
@soulscarred71 @thehill And prisoners are provided necessary medical attention and medications.
@soulscarred71 @thehill All prisoners are not qualified to work, yet they had free choice not to commit violations. If you do not work, you have store benefits.
@soulscarred71 @thehill I'm still on the oppose as an Army Vet, former LAPD &amp; worked in prisons.
@soulscarred71 @thehill I get your point. Tired of people asking for handouts. Some are in need and at that point I give, but to blame politicians is ridiculous.

Are there midnight law we can enact during shut down, to enact a law that gets oshitty out of office before they awake, like he does to us?
team to team one wins, argue a point; win; when you use the people to get your way-no win situation. odumma/reid-How brazenly arrogant!
@tedcruz  Stand your ground.  We the people supported you when it was easy....Keep Republican arms locked. United We Stand
@PMgeezer If James Madison et.al. were alive we wouldn't be in this situation; oshitty would not be creating laws when he can't get his way.
Is there a group that helps Soldiers serving overseas enjoy sports, since oshitty targeted Soldiers to make his point? I'd like to donate.

RT @rightwingertoo: Can we have just ONE day without having to hear about or having to see an Obama? Just one?!
Goodnight Americans and Allies, Sweet Dreams and may we wake up in the U.S.  God bless our Soldiers and keep them safe...impeach ojack@$$.
Remember the old days when the President knew who paid them and served them obligingly?
@CaptYonah Remember when we could turn on the TV and not throw up because you are sick of potus/flotus and harry they hideous dicktator?
@MacBetty  I am laughing my butt off, I was trying to kill the insect on my computer screen!
@sarahuhran @nypost Not the hotdogs too? Nooooot the hotdogs too?
@FloridaJayhawk I tuned in and saw an arrogant woman speaking....changed it just as fast. Do they have to have their hands in everything?
@LAsThePlace Gee, opening our country up for more terrorism....what a shock!
HAHA..hanoi jane is paying dearly, her ego has to look at close ups of herself with more wrinkles than a Shar Pei..torture her with re-airs!
Do we really have to watch jay carney, osucka's butt-y struggle through 4 more years of lying to us..he is so bad at it it's almost comical!
RT @DeatonCAPT: @SenRandPaul We have your back, Senator. How about stopping Hagel for everyone in uniform?
@SenTedCruz Great job! I love a representative with a backbone. I wish there were more like the few who stand on their word!
Hmm lets see, U.S. in financial danger &amp; I'm  president...cut off funds to cut throat countries, unite US and Israeli militaries..kick @$$!
@Texgalleslie @ThoseUSAGirls @OurHolyArmour @petejustified @lmarl63 @wakeup1442 @TerryGHarris @grindingdude @LisaLisa922  Happy Sunday USA!
Let's remind the president who he works for by cutting his pay on March 1st. And to stupid comments by stupid comedians HE IS NOT MY DADDY!
@DLoesch Maybe we could use the paper gun a little girl got suspended for carrying, or the pretend grenade a boy got "despended" for?
I keep scratching my head and wonder what the president is scratching ragarding cutting military budget while raising freeloaders budget!?
@ThoseUSAGirls Happy Thursday! Blessings of Red, White &amp; Blue with a side of God's loving embrace  ;)

@RepJimRenacci Congratulations and best wishes for success. Don't drink water in front of liberals, take no bunk, and make your party proud!
Oh no! What do I do? I went to drink some water and a liberal saw me! Anybody have a fake mustache I can borrow....anybody....anybody?
@brpapcun @LilSouthernSass My Hound would make a good President or Vice President. When he has a slip of his tongue you see it coming
@VMishmash Isn't that the same thing?
What was the purpose of the Boston Tea Party if stupid people were going to elect stupid people.
"Let's get it done let's get it done." This from the liar who promises and doesn't follow-up. Who ran on "I'm going to.." but does nothing.
potus press release about what is getting cut  because yadi yadi.  Included in the cuts was head start. He is promoting what he is cutting!
@USAHipster His smile says "I'm  standing here and I know nobody can tell the truth about me because I have the microphone.
My STU address:  Kids money spent or given to the eternal lazy. Commander and thief takes away from heroes to give to bums! IMPEACH IMPEACH!
@samsteinhp Another way to spend
@brpapcun @LilSouthernSass ruff! (My dog agrees with you and so do I)
I'm pulling fingernails off my hands....I'd rather do that than watch the STUpid address!

One shot from inside the cabin, the coward probably took the cowards road out!
ammunition exploding inside the cabin
Maybe we will get lucky and not have to hear potus mislead us tonight!
@MonicaCrowley I hope he accidentally falls into zillions of fists/boot tips , and lives to hear his name dorner the coward.
https://t.co/CwuWf4ih  Get caught in anyones cross hairs.
The good guys will always get the bad guys. Just ask John Wayne or Clint Eastwood...punk!
A man stands on his feet and faces his accusers, a coward hides up in a cabin and ties people up.
@catwahler Thank you as well, and God Bless and watch over you and yours through these trying times. God bless America
@marklindesr @piersmorgan Watch it now, you might get despended for aiming a tweet.  piersmorgan doesn't even capitalize his own name!
I read a profile that	annihilates the reputation of  LAPD, as a former member I wonder how the critic would feel if he had to call 911 today
I shamed my Sainted Mom the 1st tme I voted. My commitment stands firm. TY Reps Rubio &amp; Graham etal. Stand up for your party or stand down!
