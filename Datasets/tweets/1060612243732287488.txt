I’m raising a red flag to be on guard for the potential for an adverse impact on #aviationsafety and security caused by this #GovernmentShutdown #KeepFlyingSafe https://t.co/nEXbU2aCiT
Our system remains safe—it’s now up to our frontline employees and professionals to be extra diligent during ALL phases of our flight operations. #Shutdown #KeepFlyingSafe #TrainedForLife https://t.co/nEXbU2aCiT
Asking #aviation workers to do their jobs without pay is an unconscionable act that can leave affected workers distracted and demoralized. This puts the safety of our aviation system at increasing risk. #Shutdown https://t.co/nEXbU2aCiT
My concerns are increasing about our aviation system &amp; industry being able to support the level of safety we demand as professional #pilots. #Shutdown https://t.co/nEXbU2aCiT
The programs that help us identify new or emerging threats to our aviation system are at risk of being weakened. #Shutdown https://t.co/nEXbU2aCiT
Right now, some of the programs and processes that help us monitor the aviation system to keep us safe are at risk of being weakened. #Shutdown #KeepFlyingSafe https://t.co/nEXbU2aCiT
