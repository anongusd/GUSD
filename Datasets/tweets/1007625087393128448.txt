Take soy-based #biodiesel for example. Soybeans are 80% meal and 20% oil. Only the excess soybean oil is used to make biodiesel, while the meal is used to feed livestock, etc. This is just one example of how you get food AND fuel.
‚ÄùMost of the plants used to make biodiesel are grown on land that could instead be used to produce crops for food and animal feed.‚Äù This is false, @TBrandStudio. In the U.S., #biodiesel production creates food AND fuel. https://t.co/noHKaIJX2X
