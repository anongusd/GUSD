@JeffFlake We are so screwed. Save your breath.
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary https://t.co/pvgNTATb8Y
@SteveSchmidtSES I never liked you when you were McCain’s manager. I loathed Palin and I blamed you and Nicolle for unleashing her on the world. I’ve changed. You’ve changed. Now you are heros.  Thank you. Don’t stop.
