@tommypvideo @rhainman @jasoninthehouse Yes. Why a swat team for a Middle Aged suburbanite? However law enforcement does this a lot. Here in Utah,  local, state and federal agencies were investigating  the AG. They swarmed his house with overwhelming force just like they did with Stone. Sadly it’s part of the playbook

@rhainman @jasoninthehouse The way it went down is pretty typical given the circumstances. Plus the feds thought he might be a flight risk. I bet scenarios like this one play out across the country hundreds of times a month.
@jasoninthehouse SWAT teams, for better or worse, use the same method across the the nation everyday of the week. In Utah a number of years ago, police served a no knock Warrant on a guy who was selling small bags of weed. It ended in a bloody gunfight. So Stone was treated like everyone else.

Perkins says when got there, it wasn't a shed but a huge house with 9 or so bedrooms.  No evidence of fraud he said.  This part interesting too:  He did say there is a big school board election in the area, 500 registered voters, so 30 votes could be a big deal.
because there were 12-20 ppl who had registered to vote at the residence.  He says his guys googled the home and it was just a shed, so they went to talk to the ppl.  Interestingly he says the Lt. Gov's office didn't seem interested, but he sent officers anyway.

@ByCommonConsent Ben McAdams is a nice man, but not lightening in a bottle like say a Beto O’Rourke.  This district is a 20+  Republican, Love should be mopping the floor with him. This race speaks more to her weaknesses as a candidate than McAdams strengths.

@breeden_bryce @BloggingTheBoys I'd be on board if they would have beat Wash.  That was a gut check game, and fizzled.  You need those hard victories to build confidence and momentum.  I'll change my prediction.  7-9.  And Amari Cooper gets 25 catches for 175 yards  no touchdowns. I appreciate your hopefullness
@breeden_bryce @BloggingTheBoys If you're correct that would win the division...I don't see that happening.
@breeden_bryce @BloggingTheBoys Sadly. Yes. I hope I’m wrong. But...they are terrible and so is their coach.
@breeden_bryce @BloggingTheBoys They have NO offense.  NONE. The defense is top 5 but offense can't score more than 17 pnts.  You can't win when you can't run, and you can't throw.  Jones is losing faith in Garrett, so are the players, it's an ugly recipe for 4-12.  Do I like it "no'  it's just the sad truth.
@breeden_bryce @BloggingTheBoys Gosh, you sure are insulting when presented with the some real "Hot takez"  I'm sorry that honest debate threatens your manhood.
@mattdizwhitlock @senorrinhatch And wears T-shirts that are WAY too big!
@breeden_bryce @BloggingTheBoys You forget the Cowboys play in the worst division in NFL they can't win that. When draft time comes, the one time where hope springs eternal, you're going to wish they still had that first rounder.  You'll watch as The Raiders pick with Cowboys 10 and take a generational player.
@breeden_bryce @BloggingTheBoys Easily?  Have you been paying attention to THIS year or are you watching 2014 on VHS?  This team will pick in the top 10.  Oh, sorry, The Oakland Raiders will pick in the top 10.
@breeden_bryce @BloggingTheBoys I'll tell you what's NOT bright.  Trading away your future for an under performing receiver who had a BETTER QB in Oak than he'll have in Dallas.
@BloggingTheBoys Wait till the Cowboys go 4-12.  You'll be wishing you had that number 1 back.
@CowboysNation Wow...sell out the future for an underachieving wide reliever who had a better QB in Oak.  Bad move.  This reminds me Of the Joey Galloway trade.

@gopTODD In a race that is called a toss up by cooks. It is accurate to say the new Boyer laws in Georgia have affected African Americans more than any other group.
@gopTODD I heard it in a podcast this morning, let me google you an article.  Or you could listen to the Daily with Micheal @mikiebarb
@gopTODD Since Brian Kemp has been Sec. of State, the man running against Dem Stacy Abrams has had more than a million people removed from the voter roles, 70 percent of whom are black.

@PauliCavanaugh @MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum ok what about the people who never report?  There's one for your head.
@PauliCavanaugh @MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum yes.  it means they are true, based on the studies conducted.  Do prosecutors get a conviction?  that is a different metric altogether.
@PauliCavanaugh @MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum So you're saying becuase a prosecutor didn't gather enough evidence at a sex crime scene, or messed up, and it results in a exoneration that that case is a false allegations?  That's just messed up on a lot of levels.
@PauliCavanaugh @MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum You're assuming that cases that don't end in a convictions have to be false allegations.  That's just incorrect.
@PauliCavanaugh @MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum is it 1 percent?  I don't know.  If it is there could be a number of reasons.  Bias.  Lack of evidence.  Most sex assaults only have 2 involved, the accused and the accuser.
@MDTomitsch @PauliCavanaugh @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum Right the numbers of people who DON'T report is exponential
@PauliCavanaugh @MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum Maybe it's because there isn't enough evidence, which in and of itself doesn't mean the allegations are false.  And none of the studies take into account the people you never report sex assault, fear they won't be believed, or shame.

@PauliCavanaugh @MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum Yes.  I'm right, here is "something" vs. your nothing.  https://t.co/k4YR2z44nX.
@mcschmuggin @marthamaccallum People keep saying this is so awful.  It's the way the process is supposed to work.  Sorry democracy makes you uncomfortable.
@MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum And it doesn't even take into account the number of people who NEVER report they were victims of sexual assault.
@PauliCavanaugh @MDTomitsch @JakecBishop1 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum This study is almost 25 years old.  Come back when you have something from this century to present.
@saltlakechamber @DerekMillerUtah Is that a ...guillotine?  What kind of event is this?
@BjaminWood @sltrib Sure, just don't every refer to me as any of those things.
@KristinMinkDC @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin I think reports that they WH said the FBI can only talk to certain people is what most are concerned about.
@senorrinhatch I think EVERYONE was ignoring Mitchell, especially given the terrible position she was put in during this hearing by the people who employed her.
@mcschmuggin @marthamaccallum Did you make him watch Dr. Ford. If not you have an agenda
@mcschmuggin @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum I read it. It’s about 2-4 %
@JoyceWitt19 @adamsfamily233 @marthamaccallum That’s good
@wawasense I think it’s been reported she first made the allegations in 2012. And wrote a letter to her congressperson early on
@bonnygale1 @gopTODD Ok. Sounds like you have all the answers.
@gopTODD @bonnygale1 Agreed. Police tell me they don’t have a problem with fake accusations of sexual assault they have problems with women and men NOT filing real sexual assault cases becuase they fear they won’t be believed
@PGLAB24 @bbart76 @marthamaccallum Police that I talked to say when they fail to bring charges in a sex assault case it’s NOT because the victim is lying. It’s because they just don’t have enough evidence to get a conviction
@Alean4 @bbart76 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum Exactly! Because of the way victims who speak out are treated in our society
@bonnygale1 @marthamaccallum Who cares how many partners she’s had. That’s called slut shaming
@PGLAB24 @bbart76 @marthamaccallum Right. We will teach our son about treating his partner with respect and believing someone when they say they’ve been a victim.
@bbart76 @PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum I’m with you 100 percent
@PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum The facts don’t support that Tho.  I have a son. It’s one of things I am least concerned about.
@bonnygale1 @marthamaccallum Well, if he tried to rape someone, yeah he should probably be denied that job, and maybe even lose the one he has
@PGLAB24 @marthamaccallum There have been studies Done on this, fake Allegations of sexual assault seldom if ever happen. There are, of course, some high profile cases of women, or men lying it, but when it it reported it’s usually true.
@bonnygale1 @gopTODD You don’t know if she’s lying or not. You’re a partisan and your opinion is just that, another politically driven response to a news story. And no one really cares what you think. I’m just being honest
@bonnygale1 @marthamaccallum That’s a principal discussed in our legal system. The Kavanaugh hearings are not legal proceedings and neither was the testimony given by Dr Ford. This is about politics and public relations. The hearings were a job interview for Kavanaugh, not a trial.
@adamsfamily233 @marthamaccallum Your 16 year old didn’t say anything close to that.  IF he has even a clue that this is even going on and IF you asked him about it he probably said: “huh?” and then went back to playing Fortnite.
@marthamaccallum Yeah. No moms of sons or daughter  I know are saying anything like that.
@McAllisterDen I guess. What’s your lame point?

@MC_Sadist To say "I can't say everything is truthful" suggests she has doubts about the veracity of the statement, but adding: "I don't know" adds context, it tells me she can't say it's not true because she doesn't know.  Subtle but important.
@studiocafebleu @mattdizwhitlock Yeah I think castigating people for not following the "Process" is a moot point.  NOW we must hear out the allegations, and hear out Dr. Ford.  Who has been talking about this alleged incident since 2012.
@mattdizwhitlock These kinds of allegations are going to be sensational no matter the process.
@elliosch @mattdizwhitlock She said "I can't say everything is truthful.  I don't know."  Put in full context Matt. Leaving out the "I don't know." changes the nuance.
@mattdizwhitlock I guess I'm less interested in "how" we came to know about Dr. Ford, and now intently interested is WHAT she has to say.
@mattdizwhitlock Matt this is serious stuff.  Why do you think it should have been investigated outside the public eye? Not attacking but asking.
@mattdizwhitlock and then the Post talked to her.  and she allowed her name to be known.
@mattdizwhitlock Ok, but didn't the woman INITIALLY go to 2 dems and ask that her name NOT be revealed?
@mattdizwhitlock But wasn't it the Washington Post who talked to her and revealed her name with her permission ?
@mattdizwhitlock I think the hearing is happening because these are serious allegations and Dr. Ford should be heard, and the Judge should be given a chance to respond.

@jrsmitty08 @senorrinhatch I think it’s a guesstimate based on his personal experience
@jrsmitty08 @senorrinhatch But you’re suggesting that wood, labor and  are going down. They aren’t. Labor costs are increasing in a competitive market also gas prices are up making it more expensive to deliver concrete, wood.

@jrsmitty08 @senorrinhatch As for rental contract yes, those are set but when the next apartment is built the builder will have to account for the added cost that cost is carried by the renter
@jrsmitty08 @senorrinhatch I think it’s pretty well established that if you Increase the cost of materials then prices follow. Also increase in the cost of steel, gas etc is the driving force behind inflation. The company buys a million $ in steel a year they will pay 150K more for it.

So when the president of the United States calls me "an enemy of the people." and works to turn my community against me and my friends and colleagues, it is deflating and insulting, and it is not what we should be about as a country.
In fact I woke up just last night, and couldn't get back to sleep thinking about it.  This is how seriously I take this calling. During my career I've been physically attacked, Police have threatened to arrest me, I've been cursed and spat upon.
The first error I made was in 1993.  I was a reporter in Pascagoula, MS.  I reported that the Jackson Co board of supervisors supported adding onto a gypsum storage facility.  I was wrong.  It was among the worst days of my life.
As a journalist, when I get a fact wrong, It devastates me personally, I worry, and fret, it literally keeps me up at night.  I can remember every mistake I've made during my 20 plus years in the news business.
"These are very dishonest people,"  says the President of the US, about me, my co-workers, and my friends.  Ppl who work hard everyday to get it right.  Ppl who love their country, and live among you.  It's remarkable.  It's scary, and to borrow a phrase, "it's sad." https://t.co/TTeEYUoSsr

@mattdizwhitlock @senorrinhatch I get it. Perhaps I'm quick to flinch given the last year in which we as journalists have been attacked.  People regularly walk up to me on the street and call me names and shout "fake news!"  It's been a difficult 18 months.
@mattdizwhitlock @senorrinhatch Agreed, the senator has never attacked the media.  And that is good news indeed.
@AndrewFeinberg It was a mistake for which the network has apologized.  It's another example of the #WarOnJournalism
@mattdizwhitlock @senorrinhatch The senator has always been gracious to us and a supporter of journalism, but I’ll point out this was an opinion piece not news reporting. And we are in an environment where journalism has been called “the enemy of the ppl.” By the president. The war on journalism is real.
@senorrinhatch I'm sure the sen had influence, but the media should be celebrated, not excoriated for bringing this story to light &amp; 4 putting pressure on the senator and others to make the change.  Also this is an opinion piece.  Stop attacking the media for asking questions. #WarOnJournalism

@Cowboy4life22 @JJT_Journalist Running backs can be had in the late rounds. It’s the most adaptable position from college to pros. And Murray “was good” in 2014. That’s 4 years ago! A lifetime in the NFL.
@Cowboy4life22 @JJT_Journalist The life expectancy on running backs is like 3 years. I’d be stunned if Zeke gets a second deal with the cowboys.

And we don't hear Jeffress, there is a pause on the tape while Jeffress talks, then Kennedy laughs and said, "That's what I imagine, it's been a long time coming too." I want to know what Jeffress said to solicit that response from Kennedy.
And many people still don't know why he would apologize to a person who said  ‘Mormonism is a heresy from the pit of hell.’
What he did say was: "I first would just like to reach out and say I apologize on behalf of the Governor's (Romney) statements, I do not share those and i think most of us would not classify you in those inflammatory terms that he used."
There is much about this release from @KennedyForUtah, that's frustrating. He admits he can't remember exactly what he told the @DeseretNews but says what they wrote: wrong. THEN includes PART of a 1-sided recording he had with Jeffress.  Then of course, you know, "the Media." https://t.co/8YcsOtGgQz
