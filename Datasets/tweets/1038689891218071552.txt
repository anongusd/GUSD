@Kidfears99 @Carolynyjohnson How can we seriously stop this radical pricing? 		Is competition truly helpful in the pharmaceutical industry?		Where is the true fight right now, healthcare or price gouging in the medical industry?		#cognitive_america
@BernieSanders The big fight is the inflated and imaginary prices of the medication, instruments, and health services. If we fix that we can afford a medical insurance program that will help all of us.

@BernieSanders How is it a broken promise on Trumps part? You have a John Hamilton a Democrat as the Mayor in Bloomington Indiana, and Joe Donnelly as a senator. You want to fix the problem focus on the city level, then county level, next state level. In the end you help the country.
@CNN I am not a fan of nationalist, patriotism is nationalism. You need nationalism in this country just as much as you need internationalism. Just like in any other emergency, you make sure you are safe before you help others, and we have work to do in our country. #cognitive_america

@Timebeing13 @jordanbpeterson @Timebeing13 I am trying my best to think my way out of the wheat and chaff. using my CBT and DBT skills to look and ask the right questions.

@BernieSanders @LizForIndiana I‚Äôm for it, although I‚Äôm concerned about the cost, burdening others with higher taxes. I just moved from Colorado to Indiana, I see a HUGE difference.

@AllisonforMD C, It should be a case by case situation, because using these terms is another form of bigotry. We need to balance the scales not tip them.
@LizForIndiana The cost of healthcare and medicine is exaggerated and inflated, it cost the individuals and the government more than it should. What can we do to fix that?
@KeatingFrisco @tedcruz @BetoORourke As someone who supports moderate socialism, I like the idea of a socialized medical system. As someone with critical thinking capabilities you need a plan to pay for it.	Why don‚Äôt we look at the exaggerated and inflated prices of healthcare and medicine?
