What's at stake in today's state Supreme Court hearing? Oh, just the biggest public employee pension rollback in California history. https://t.co/aps58LaQrx via @calmatters
I‚Äôll be working up an analysis of what this all means. #StayTuned @CALmatters https://t.co/CJJFNreudT
Adam closes by asking the court to set a clear rule that has existed for 60 years, the theory that you have been promised the ability to buy future service credits. He says with the state at full employment, the state needs to offer "airtime" in order to retain the best employees
Justice Liu again returns to asking Greg Adams, the firefighter union's attorney, a line of questioning about how far do pension benefits go? "It would seem that everything is an inducement to employment," Liu said.
Justices Liu and Leondra Kruger begin asking how far does that go. If a worker who has been working for 20 years suddenly has benefits changes. What then? Onishi responds that the state isn't denying workers a right to a substantial and reasonable benefit.
To the heart of this fight: Justice Liu asks Onishi if the state has a right to change benefit formula midstream in a worker's career. Onishi says yes because it applies to prospective work - the worker hasn't earned the benefit so it's not an impairment.
Brown's attorney, Rei Onishi, said the Legislature never intended this benefit to be a right and noted that it wasn't offered through collective bargaining. He noted that Brown's 2012 pension reform only set a deadline for workers to claim airtime.
BTW, Brown's latest nominee, Joshua Groban, won't get his confirmation hearing until Dec. 21. So the court sidestepped the question of whether he would have needed to recuse himself from this pension case, having served as Brown's legal adviser.
Greg Adams, attorney for Cal Fire Local 2881, argues an employee relies on airtime as part of deferred compensation. It becomes "vested right" from the time the employee was hired.
Justice Goodwin Liu questions how far does the protection extend. What if the state stopped offering life insurance at a discounted rate? Or a sabbatical leave? Or health insurance?
In opening, Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye questioned why airtime is a pension benefit. "Why is this a vested right protected by the constitution?"
California Supreme Court begins hearing @JerryBrownGov's pension reform case. Firefighters union seeking to protect "airtime," buying credits for retirement, as a vested right. Brown says removing this perk doesn't take away form a reasonable pension. Follow along!
He finally said yes! @JerryBrownGov will hold an "exit interview" with @SacPressClub on Dec. 18. Buy tickets at https://t.co/dpc5pVYCkJ
