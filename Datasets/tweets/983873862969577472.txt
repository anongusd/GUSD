@Ware52 Kremlin spent millions on proving this theory and the end they came up empty. Almost every country was called as a terrorist supporter in this war.I know people love the idea but there just so little proof.
@Ware52 At the beginning of the war right after protests, they were Syrians. But just like with any Arab revolution opportunists jumped on the action. Don't forget Russia and Iran benefit from this war as well. Otherwise, they would not be there
@RealSaavedra I like how you don't deny the fact. Whataboitism is strong here,no surprise
