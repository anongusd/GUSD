@KildayMorgan @1Vote2020 Ah, okay. So.... never worked on a campaign before. Got it. Well, hopefully this clears up things and ya won't misstate or misrepresent my sentiment again. Looks like we're on the same side sans a few nuances. Best.
@KildayMorgan @1Vote2020 Ummm... ever worked on a campaign before? ALL candidates have surrogates. It's okay if a few of those happen to be Black men. Some might even say helpful. Why leave anything to chance in a crowded field? Again, she doesn't have to convince me or you. She has to convince other ppl
@Marian1Burris lol Sis, PLEASE sign up for The Beat. Check out today's here:  https://t.co/qbQiuVssZf I'm well aware of Mexican ethnicity. I run a platform that's about ALL communities of color. Google me (not said w/shade). Hope you'll start reading it! 😃 Be YOUR best 😉🙏🏽Tell your friends.
@KildayMorgan @1Vote2020 If KH were having trouble convincing environmentalists, I'd say she needs to get a strong Green party surrogate to help tell her story. Same thing. If you've EVER seen me on TV or read anything I've written, you'd know my KH feelings. Let's not spread hate. OR false info pls.
@KildayMorgan @1Vote2020 Ummm, watch again. I never referenced her husband. At all. Also, I said she should get a Black man validator aka surrogate to help tell her story to a bloc she's having trouble with. She doesn't need to convince ME she'd be a great prez. She has to convince other folks.

@MrSparrow I don't watch Fox News. And I don't suffer fools like Lynne Patton. But summed up yesterday's hearing, including this spectacle, in today's Beat: https://t.co/qbQiuVssZf Check it out! 😁
@coup_d_etat2020 @RepMaxineWaters @DrJasonJohnson According to YOUR ignorance, you're misstating my position. Also, why the insults? Lonely? Feeling irrelevant? Craving attn? Either way, read The Beat! Maybe you'll learn something. Maybe watch AM Joy again. I don't think Blk women need Blk men to be legit &amp; have never said so.
@srburris I hear you! My friends have made ugly jokes abt groups of ppl before. I didn't laugh. But I didn't express my outrage at the time. I should have. And I do now. But man. Thankful ppl don't judge me for the few times I didn't. And thankful I challenge myself to do better every day.
@Marian1Burris You've clearly never read anything I've written. Or tweeted. Or seen me on TV. I've discussed, at length, all the things you mentioned. I have the intellectual &amp; emotional capacity to not just feel but to "DO." PS- I don't know Amorosa but I never had tears for Omarosa. Be best.

@cal5k @kamijane29 @SenKamalaHarris THIS I actually agree with. Sexism is an issue among Black men.

But to reach those who need to "get told."
@derek_honore @msleen1970 @amjoyshow No, but maybe you should read about things Luther Campbell has been doing.

@PettyLupone @TruthSayer1992 Tiffany Cross said WHAT? Nah, she didn't. "Validator" is a common phrase in politics.

@earthdogelevena @KurtNiceHHL @WPalmerCurl @chrisdameanor19 @KamalaHarris ok... sigh. Now you sound like a clown. So I gotta mute you silly. Be best.
@earthdogelevena @hottnotthemama @Ange_Amene You sound a little ridiculous if you think I'm working for someone's campaign. And you CLEARLY don't watch me regularly. I've been accused of being a Kamala surrogate before. I'm not -- simply offering analysis. I'm not even criticizing her. I'm offering her campaign a suggestion
Ummmm...have you ever worked in politics? Candidates need surrogates. https://t.co/bSal3cnWeE
I agree with this. And have said this numerous times. I also think she needs some strong surrogates and validators. I maintain that. https://t.co/D9AnLXKVYw
Maybe you should read The Beat and other things I’ve written. 🤷🏽‍♀️Or, better yet, maybe you should have listened today when I LITERALLY offered the KH team a solution. https://t.co/bxIm8qybVH
@Sam49593387 Hate Kamala?? You’ve obviously never seen me on TV before.
I was just kidding! 😀 I pretend to be a millennial on TV. 🤫 https://t.co/n8CfEiMAJH
Have you ever watched me on TV? They both have challenges on criminal justice. I’ve talked about them extensively. Today though, the topic was @KamalaHarris. I’m offering analysis. Senator Harris is a tough politician. I’m simply saying she has to tell a story of her evolution. https://t.co/NbkmGC4X5q
Please make sure you listen to what I said. I don’t spread misinformation. Thanks. 🙏🏽 https://t.co/MbB0U0xhMp
I do actually. I do think Black men can be just as sexist as everyone else. And think @KamalaHarris will face that issue as well. Unfortunately. Someone’s legislative record is fair game. Her gender? Not so much. https://t.co/soRUul3ngQ
@KurtNiceHHL @DrJasonJohnson Clearly you don’t know me, listen to me, or follow me if you think I’m a cynic. Or if you think I’m younger than you.
It’s kind of crazy that you think I’m tearing her down. I’m not her surrogate. I’m offering analysis. I’ve applauded her work. Have you EVER seen me on TV? I’m simply pointing out an issue I think she will face based on my 20+ years working in media &amp; politics. https://t.co/FavWJ2jtig

RT @CristobalJAlex: @TiffanyDCross Word to the wise. Do not mess with Tiffany.
I could do this all day, Becky. Point is- you support a racist. The people at the rallies support a racist. This is not a controversial thing to point out. It's fact. As evidenced by decades of racist rhetoric &amp; policies he pursued. Yet still, you cheer him on. So... bye girl. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
Trump revived the already discredited #BarackObama the unfounded racist birther theory. Yet still, you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
"Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes.... I think that's guy's lazy. And it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in Blacks." ~Trump in 1991. Yet still, you cheered him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
In 1973 the DOJ sued Trump &amp; his father Fred, -- they refused to "rent apartments in one of his developments to African Americans", violating the Fair Housing Act. But still, you cheered him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
Numerous studies and surveys have documented racist attitudes and racial resentment have fueled Trump's political ascendance. Because people like you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
He referred to El Salvador, Haiti, and African countries as "shitholes." Yet STILL, you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
After #Charlottesville (where a woman was MURDERED by a white supremacist), he made a moral equivalence between white supremacist and those who protested against them. Yet still, you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
He tweeted fake statistics claiming that black Americans are responsible for the majority of murders of whites, and in some speeches he linked African-Americans and Hispanics with violent crime. Yet still, you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
He said a Mexican-American judge could not do his job because of his heritage - the definition of racism. Yet still, you cheer him on.
He launched his 2016 presidential campaign with a speech where he stated of Mexican immigrants: "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people" Yet still, you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
His personal lawyer says he repeatedly used racist rhetoric: https://t.co/Jiye1vUIIG Yet still, you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
The most racially charged national political ad in 30 years, Trump and the Republican Party accuse Democrats of plotting to help people they depict as Central American invaders overrun the nation with cop killers. https://t.co/lps5UaNKvt Yet still, you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb
Trump ratcheted up the anti-immigrant rhetoric and suggesting that if any migrants throw rocks they could be shot by the troops that he has deployed at the border. https://t.co/yz5EpuoB46 Yet still, you cheer him on. https://t.co/nI6ZdYB0sb

@Bubblebathgirl The thing abt tweets is they don't disappear unless you delete. You said I defended JS. I did not. So ummm, sure. Clean up your lie w/another lie. OR, maybe try reading a paper? Or a think piece in The Atlantic perhaps? Try some intellectual stimulation. Seems like you can use it

Nancy👏🏾Pelosi 👏🏾is not👏🏾here for the mess. However you feel about her speakership bid, today she looks like the adult and the smartest person at the table.
Interesting to see @NancyPelosi HANDLE (educate) @realDonaldTrump. Just saying... it's hard to question her years of experience and street cred when she looks the man in the eye and says "GET SOME" I'm beat. https://t.co/IWiuuk9nP9
