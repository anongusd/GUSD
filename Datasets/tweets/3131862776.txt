Akuffo Addo must sack Boakye Agyako. The man is very corrupt. He misled the president to sign the corrupt and stinky Ameri deal.
@RasMubarak @JDMahama Some of we the grassroots will not vote 2020 if Mahama’s face is not on the ballot paper
Are we waiting for Akuffo Addo to destroy our educational system before we start talking? U see the hypocrisy of some civil society groups in this country? Ayooo
Thank you JM https://t.co/bhtoz8HQZX

One thing I was expecting the Nana Akuffo Addo government to do is to pay attention to our health sector. Our health is not the concern of this government at all. Most of the hospitals now have no bed, and the government don’t care.

At a time we are been told NHIS is collapsing, no beds in our various hospitals and people are dying, there’s no money to pay nurses and government will no more bond the nurses, and one person has money to buy 275 buses for a political party in less than one and half yr ?

So the question I kept asking myself ever since the EC boss was sacked was that, in future should a new government win power, would they also appoint a new EC chair ? Akuffo addo has set a bad precedent for future governments to follow.
Everyday, u have African leaders assembling in one country or the other on how to fight corruption but when they come back, thier the first people to come and steal from thier various countries. Tweeaa

In some 2-3 years ago, people were burning markets just to make the country ungovernable for a certain John Mahama. A new government came to power, and the burning of the markets have stopped. So does it  mean someone was behind it ? Just to make the country ungovernable?
@Sambryanbuabeng A fool will always remain a fool forever

@Sambryanbuabeng U Bryan and Nana Hessey kept attacking Anas just because his doing the right thing. Ghana is just a stupid country to stay in. In some jurisdictions, nobody will appoint small boys like u as staffers who will be here and be insulting the elderly
Go way u. If u are not against him, then why do u keep attacking him everyday? https://t.co/i3MgXcpYiF
