@glgivan @Rebecca345W @Uncle_Batman_67 @Orwellian69 @GunOwners I'd love to see CDC report/ link to it. Here in Hawaii we have strict gun control, as island not subject to other states laws. (not a ban). We also have the lowest gun murder rate in the nation. Gun control is compatible with lawful gun ownership.
@glgivan @Rebecca345W @Uncle_Batman_67 @Orwellian69 @GunOwners I am not for taking away your gun. I am for reasonable regulation and limits on guns/2nd amendment rights. I am for gun control. Universal background checks, red flag laws and numerous other measure that would save lives. Our gun murder rate is highest among developed nations.
@glgivan @Rebecca345W @Uncle_Batman_67 @Orwellian69 @GunOwners high tech background check would stop criminals from buying, with zero inconvenience to non criminals. Of course the NRA fights like hell against that and for the tragic status quo. Chicago mass murder could have been prevented  with GUN CONTROL/universal background check
@glgivan @Rebecca345W @Uncle_Batman_67 @Orwellian69 @GunOwners Recently,  Chicago mass Shooter was not subject to an effective national background check.

no, Im simply pointing out if it is a response to me...its a big ol' non-sequitur...for reasons I mentioned.

Guns can be lawfully regulated..first amendment (numero uno) rights are not limitless. I support my states right to "DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY"! We can regulate and even ban certain guns or perhaps bullets that had not been invented at the time of the constitution..blanket gun ban?-no https://t.co/iGBh4JOXfJ

@cindilou20 WE need to decide our self interest on immigration..theres a lot of work Americans won't do. My understanding is immigrants are net positive economically. Temp visas should be temp. We should enforce our laws. GOP has been all over the place on this issue too. Gun Control  4 Wall
@Pady_oFurniture @Nancy_NotPelosi @jtkrpm @cindilou20 @FBI @POTUS I would not support turning our democracy into a dictatorship like Hitler did nor a blanket ban on firearms ....... this can't be a response to anything I have tweeted

@jsbishop1 @SarahPalinUSA @bullitt4248 yes, we must have an immigration policy and enforcement that uses "best practices", that works for us, that makes sense.

@jtkrpm @cindilou20 @FBI @POTUS yes our public policy is different. Neither Japan nor Australia have a gun ban they have gun control/regulation.... We do not, and the results are tragic for US. Japan in particular is so much safer, Australia too.
@SteveScalise You represent the state with the highest gun murder rate in the country and tragically you got shot by a crazed nut.....(also, Louisiana is getting CRUSHED by Trump tariffs).  Make a deal:  GUN CONTROL for WALL

@jtkrpm Nonsense, it is not the goal....I would not support a blanket ban at all. Nope. However the NRA dogma has tragically failed US....no amount of spin or outright fabrications/conspiracy theories change that
@cindilou20 I support comprehensive gun control...that means things like tougher sentences, buy back programs....not banning lawful gun ownership across the board. Gun control works
@cindilou20 @jtkrpm @FBI @POTUS you know what has stopped mass shootings in Australia? Gun control......	I lived in Japan for a year, they had 8 gun murders for the year, nationally. We had the usual 10k or so. Gun control works

Yes, thats what I wrote above.  Id be fine w/ a consortium of gun control groups like  Brady Foundation, other pro gun control groups write law. Also, many lessons from abroad. I lived in Japan one year where they had gun murders in single digits, we had the usual 10k or so. https://t.co/zAOnv6lSiZ

Blanket bans don't work..often they make problems worse. Planned Parenthood is a non-profit org. I wouldnt like to see them make abortions cheaper necessarily.  I would like to see abortion rate lowered, even eliminated but not with a blanket ban that would only make things worse https://t.co/bYolBzonYU

It needs to be age/school appropriate but have to consider SOME kids are sexually active in JH  Most 50 Y O dont need sex ed, youth do..they have learned through trial, error. I support opt out

@Malorozco1 @sandyherr2 @PoliticallyRYT comprehensive sex ed does lower the abortion rate......according to the data and many countries that have lower abortion rates than us.....it is what works. On the other hand where abortion is banned it is higher. I support your right to opt out of it.

@FreeWhiteMale @AnnCoulter GOP have been worse, if Clinton was Prez we wouldn't see ballooning deficits, which  had been shrinking under Obama,  as weve had w/ Trump GOP, no way. B. Clinton balanced budgets. Lowering interest rates saved us &amp; stimulated growth that's why   GOPer Chairman Bernanke did it.

@NTmychild @1776Stonewall millions of women get effective birth control from Planned Parenthood, most pay. I know, I've seen them there when I got HPV vaccine there. Many waiting for birth control not abortions, informational BC video playing. Planned Parenthood lowers abortions w/ all the BC they offer.
I've been in many public/private schools, I have a son in high school. Comprehensive sex ed. (which teaches abstinence and birth control) works better to lower pregnancy/abortion rates than abstinence only. That said, we must do better to get the information and bc to youth https://t.co/qHgrzWWI3B

@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra No need to eliminate 2nd amendment. That said when it was created, bullets hadnt been invented. You can never convince me we must allow individuals to own AR-15s, carry them in public or have small nukes. Youve forgoten about domestic tranquility? The founders wanted that for us
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra Theres been general decrease of all crime going back a very long time...some attribute it to legal abortion. Regardless, we have a gun murder rate that is way way higher than other countries. While Australia has eliminated mass shootings w/ gun control we have them constantly.
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra NRA, very much like a cult, has stopped listening. They do not advocate for a safer USA they advocate for gun makers and the leadership is not even in agreement with their own members who support some gun control. Many have quit like HW Bush.
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra none of our rights are absolute, they have reasonable limits.

Can I have a nuclear weapon under my 2nd amend?
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra ....seems like most of the mass shooters bought their guns legally. High capacity mags., AR-15s, bump stocks have been popular with mass shooters need to be ban.
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra I'm all for that........leave no loopholes, and money to enforce disarming criminals would help.
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra yes, but that alone is not enough
@JoeFL65 @Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra There has been a general long term decreasing of crime, however our gun violence rate is still much much much higher than other developed countries due to our public policy regarding guns. Australia eliminated mass shootings entirely with gun control. Here they happen constantly
@spectre680 @Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra Part of good gun policy is strong deterrents/tough sentences for guns crime.

@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra I've given you my thoughts but you have offered no solutions, you seem to be defending the status quo. Perhaps you don't feel we have a gun violence and crime problem. Correct me if I am wrong.
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra I don't support blanket bans.....look at MADD they changed our laws and culture (without a ban on alcohol or driving) and cut drunk driving fatalities in half, we can do the same with guns.
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra yes and if you are going to shave you don't need a razor....if you are going to build a high rise you don't need a crane....but it sure does make it a lot easier. ...worn out NRA cult dogma has all the answers but continues to fail tragically
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra I'm for doing what it takes to lower our unacceptably high gun violence.........if they have already...then beef it up. Gun control has woked in Japan, UK, Australia....not like there is no evidence that it works. ...unless you listen to the Failed NRA Cult Dogma
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra Status quo has failed........"don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good"   We need to take action. .....I lived/worked in Japan for a while. One year, they had 6 gun murders total....we had the usual 10,000. They have strict gun control, we do not.
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra President would have signed gun control unfortunately the voice of the American people and Obama feel on deaf ears, congress did nothing. Chicago is subject to weak gun laws of its neighbors....and it also has a horrible gang problem which must be dealt with.
@Biker_Bot1 @LisaMarieBoothe @RealSaavedra buyback programs have worked elsewhere.......we can do a LOT better. The status quo is UNacceptable.  Gun Control works
@DLoesch His guns should have been taken away along with his right to buy/own/bear arms in the future. We need to toughen up the laws

The shooter showed signs of mental illness, he should not have had guns. Gun Control Works. MADD changed our laws/culture and cut Drunk Driving fatalities in half. We can't prevent all gun violence but we can and must do better. Clearly NRA cult dogma has tragically FAILED https://t.co/dTd4K66SCN

@benshapiro Hawaii has strict gun laws too and some of the lowest gun violence in USA.  Of course we are the perfect Lab for gun control. Gun control works, but we can do better. This guy shot his gun, neighbors heard...he had mental health issues...his guns should have been taken from him.

@DineshDSouza @danielledsouzag @AmericaFirstPol The "Progressive Era" included 2 GOP and 1 Dem Pres: T Roosevelt, H. Taft, W Wilson. Progress then was about Regulation, conservation of the environment and the income tax....later it was FDR-Social Sec, Medicare and civil rights. Today GOP is conservative not progressive.
Clearly the Dems have been the party of civil rights......Look at LGBT rights. I know in my state it has been clear/stark contrast as can be. GOPers opposed equal protections, Dems changed the law to extend equal protections to LGBT minority. https://t.co/9j0b7AZ2WZ

@RepRodBlum *We are now far to the right of the Laffer Curve so that tax cuts do not pay for themselves, We now pay more in interest to our debt than on medicare.
@RepRodBlum Facts: Deficits expanded 17% last year due to the tax cuts that mostly went to the top. You said falsely, they would pay for themselves.Cuts should've been reserved for the middle class- you said that was too "hard" to do. You sited the JFK tax cuts when the highest rate was 90%
@RepRodBlum and when we were far to the left of Laffer curve. Tax cuts to the middle class are much more stimulative, which is why the tax cuts that mostly went to the top, you voted for are throwing us so deep into deficits.
@Abby4Iowa not according to CBO. He talked about JFK tax cuts 50+years ago when highest rate was 90% and we were to the right of the Laffer Curve, now we are to the left. He knocked you for using notes, while he was pulling his numbers from the clear blue sky. Keep fighting. Thanks

@NatalieGABand our constitution says we have freedom to peaceably assemble. I remember in school a Jewish woman telling me about the hurt feelings of watching Nazis parade through Jewish areas but expressing how it was the right thing to allow it.
Stronger gun laws, like AR-15 ban, may not have prevented this attack entirely because hand guns were also used but it very likely would have dramatically decreased the death and damage.

@RagingGayCons @tomsuperkat I'm someone you would call probably call "leftist" (although I consider myself moderate). Trump and right have unjustly and falsely vilified George Soros. That said, this particular attack seems to me the kind of antisemitism that is not particularly left or right...just nuts
@nerlens_p @YouNicks @realkerryfrench I think Soros would say, helping people outside the US does not destroy the middle class here. He would probably say, it isn't a zero sum game

@LynnyontheFly I don't like the politics of the Koch brothers because they support fossil fuel, they oppose cleaner alternative fuels, and they lobby for tax cuts that benefit themselves. However they also do philanthropy and operate within the law of unlimited political donations

@IdeasandC @snarkystiletto @skylorjane @Politicon @benshapiro Respectfully, I could see if people like you were to start pushing birth control/abstinence-bring down the abortion rate without a ban on abortion..if you, and people like you were to adopt EVERY orphan and foster child, many with special needs etc. then I would hear you better.
@IdeasandC @snarkystiletto @skylorjane @Politicon @benshapiro Do you support a ban on legal abortion and on "artificial" birth control? (AKA the Catholic dogma) I happen to think that is the absolute cruelest way to go.
@IdeasandC @snarkystiletto @skylorjane @Politicon @benshapiro I see. This thread started with suggesting that we all unite to do what we can to lower the abortion rate with what works. Like teaching youth (opt out) comprehensive sex ed by high school, including abstinence ed and birth control ed. Also, much greater access to birth control

@Kevin950 PS My Roth IRAs tripled during the Obama admin. (GOOGL, GGP) all while my family sacrificed to save on an income of around 60k per year. I was just pleased that Obama and now Trump have not started counter productive lying needless wars as Bush did.
facts: Several Quarters 4% under Obama, yes, not whole year of 4%+ growth. SAME for Trump!Obama=7 years of slow,steady growth after inheriting the great recession,2 wars.Obama handed off growing GDP,shrinking budget deficits to Trump since then deficit has expanded 17% in 1 year. https://t.co/bHLf0VSDeG

@seanhannity @SenSasse Look Sean, as a fellow American, I would always be civil towards you. No personal attacks, certainly no violence. However, I, like Sasse, generally disagree with you
@real_farmacist Yes, you,Kamela Harris agree!..shouldve done that w/ last tax cut,how bout pay for it so budgets balance?! Budgets were narrowing under Obama,now they are dramatically expanding...by 17% last year..projected to go higher.We spend more on interest to debt than on Medicare!-BAD
@realDonaldTrump CNN never reported tin foil hat falsehood that Obama was born in Kenya when both his parents were college students here in Hawaii and his birth was announced in 2 local papers. If CNN reports something thats factually wrong they retract it. You and fake news don't do that.

@bellarene7 @realamricancarn @CarsonDunn10 @SpeakerRyan they talk a whole lot more anout GDP.....so pleased that it got to 4%, fueled by debt. Im a saver, i dont get FOx, just clips of it,,,send a clip about debt fr fox
@bellarene7 @Olsonjam808 @realamricancarn @CarsonDunn10 @SpeakerRyan social security, medicare yes, taxes are shown on your pay stub...tax and spend, you can say. GOP are just borrow and spend since Eisenhower, Ford-worse. Question is, what now?
@bellarene7 @TimnGibsons @realamricancarn @CarsonDunn10 @SpeakerRyan 13 departments of of our gov report evidence that Russia pushed Trump and Bernie hard in election. Trumps role or not...or other corruption like tax evasion is being looked into.wait/see
@bellarene7 @realamricancarn @CarsonDunn10 @SpeakerRyan turns out JFK lowered taxes, but we were way to the left of  Laffer Curve back then now we are far to the right of it..pigs in mud...debtberg ahead. We need another Ross Perot, or another Gingrich/Clinton....GOP BLOWING up the DEBT, the Dems are not standing in their way
Everybody loves goodies like tech training, my Dad went to USC on the GI bill, thing is Eisenhower refused to lower taxes from 90% at highest rate-that used to be conservative! Now were morally weak,ignorant wont agree to raise taxes to pay for it!Wrong, dangerous will weaken us! https://t.co/mOdeBGf4ph

@bellarene7 @realamricancarn @CarsonDunn10 @SpeakerRyan Agree that neither party wants to face reality on debt.......cause we are so obese with debt, so self indulgently ignorant. That said, it's pretty clear that Reagan, Bush II, and Trump have been debt kings,  Carter, Clinton were fiscally responsible.Obama inherited Bush disaster.
@bellarene7 @realamricancarn @CarsonDunn10 @SpeakerRyan why was it the ONLY think that was talked about when Obama inherited the great recession on Fox New was DEBT...now that Tump and the GOP are dramatically expanding deficits/debt- #MediaSilence . Why?
@thefloridarose Drunk Driving, Gun Violence, Smoking, Abortion -we should work to lower all of these with what works, but not through blanket bans
@thefloridarose pro lifers just as often are ones whose daughters get in trouble,find themselves getting abortions,saying others should have personal responsibility. Illegal dangerous abortions happen every day in Philipines, Abortion- VERY common in old Hawaii don't like bans,  best practices.
@LynnyontheFly @TomFitton @blanken01 @JudicialWatch that sucks....wouldn't expect you to file charges.Couldn't it just've been Soros acting in good faith,an honest understandable failure in Africa? At least he tried? but if he does this on purpose regularly? I can't see why, if true would seem there'd be evidence fr LEGIT sources
@pami943 @marklutchman continued Trump report card, Obama did run up deficits/debt.....but he also inherited the greatest recession since the 30s.. Deficits were shrinking when Trump took over. Since, the've expanded dramatically along with debt, now we spend more on debt interest than medicare
@pami943 @marklutchman As for Pres. Trump, I like that he called out Bush on lying tragic Iraq fiasco, and he's not a war monger himself so far. I'm concerned that he gives Kim unconditional love. I think enforcing immigration is fine but separation policy deeply counterproductive, wrong, I'm for DACA
@pami943 @marklutchman Im open minded, try to find common ground when it is there..don't see Obama destroyed America. He did many good things, opposed Iraq, Obamacare-pre-existing conditions&amp; -26 y o clause all embrace, LGBTQ rights, Saved GM, steady growth, TPP foolishly blocked by Trump and GOP
@EWErickson I'll try and remember those wise words or yours when you go missing........sheeesh
@benshapiro Bush did coke too, and weed-to be bipartisan about it
@RealJamesWoods ......we ALL need to keep it civil....whether he meant it literally or not, he needs to clarify and apologize..he should not have said it, and you should not be tweeting about slapping him senseless either. wrong and wrong
@LynnyontheFly @TomFitton @blanken01 @JudicialWatch you have made your allegations......what do you have to back that up with? any facts evidence, charges, convictions? ......I'd like to know if any exists to go along with  your anecdotal story
@Olsonjam808 @1961sarahw @Lynn57847587 @ConDailyPost @ALSHARPTON_REV @MichaelAvenatti aw, come on guys, knock it off, both of you
@thefloridarose not sure people really see it that way. Nobody should really be pro abortion exactly except in certain cases.  regardless.......we should lower abortion with what works, not a ban IMO. Annoys me that pro lifers don't adopt more foster kids, some do, most wont
@mitchellvii not sure he meant kick em as literal, either way, we need to ALL be civil and avoid these kind of comments, and especially actions
@FoxBusiness @POTUS Perhaps, but little reminder....this is the guy  Pres. TRUMP  appointed
@garymiles686 nah, obama=7 years of growth after inheriting great recession, opposed iraq war
@TexnHolden @garymiles686 @Golfinggary5222 also, deficits were shrinking when obama left, now dramatically expanding, with gop congress/prez
@TexnHolden @garymiles686 @Golfinggary5222 wrong, the economic crash, happend under Bush,  for what its worth to ya. might wanna check you facts 7+ years of econ growth.

@BtweenthelinesK @snigskitchen bad
It angers me that were not teaching youth the common knowledge that you and I have..unintended pregnancies happen in youth less to women in their 50s for God's sake. It's our "personal responsibility"to pass on knowledge we have in no uncertain terms to the youth, lower abortions https://t.co/4CtmY9she6
we get more assertive w/ "personal responsibility" when someone else's life. How many "abstinence all stars"? People that've never had sex except marriage?  low %. We owe youth comprehensive sex ed (incd abstinance)real access to birth control, don't have that now..not even close https://t.co/4CtmY9she6
@thefloridarose we get more assertive w/ "personal responsibility" stuff when someone elses life. How many "abstinence all stars"? People that have never had sex outside of marriage?  low %. We owe the youth education and real access to birth control, don't have that now...not even close
@thefloridarose It angers me that we are not teaching the youth the common knowledge that you and I have........unintended pregnancies happen in youth not to women in their 50s for God's sake. It is are responsibility to pass on the knowledge we have in no uncertain terms to the youth
@thefloridarose I get that, the problem remains, what can we do? I believe a ban is not that way. Also, simply saying "contraception is freely available" is perfectly normal thing to say to a 35 year old woman or man.......but it is pretty meaningless to a 16 year old who is pretty clueless.
@1961sarahw Yes, he was under audit, (perhaps he had been audited in other years too) and Pres. Trump used that to say he would release that years return when audit was complete......but he broke that promise. Was he audited in the years when the alleged tax evasion took place? I guess not
@bellarene7 @TimnGibsons @realamricancarn @CarsonDunn10 @SpeakerRyan I know pres of Korea (right) and super popular pres of Brazil(left) both in jail now. people/authorities put politics, sentiment behind,looked at evidence. FBI, DOJ stuff primarily a lot of allegations but not charges, or convictions,looks like Trump preemptive damage control
@MikeJon12797095 do you think the internet and gps are "wrong"?...because those things came to us by tax funded gov programs.
@LynnyontheFly @TomFitton @blanken01 @JudicialWatch This is your personal experience?You believe Soros intentionally harmed people with his "cloaks"? Or perhaps a case of tried to help but fell short? You believe his purpose is harming humanity? by helping some Dems and his sometimes imperfect philanthropic endeavors? ur thoughts?
@1961sarahw @Lynn57847587 @ConDailyPost @ALSHARPTON_REV @MichaelAvenatti i see self indulgent tax cuts in a good economy, pushing deficits/debt higher as anything but conservative, sadly GOP abandon fiscal responsibility long ago, gop=spend and spend dems=tax n spend

@AnnCoulter Can't watch,,,I'll say, Animal Welfare is important, we need to set an example for the rest of the world with the humane treatment of animals (and people of course). Animals we use/eat should be kept and slaughtered as humanely, painlessly as possible-no abuse

Could you set up for Kavanaugh? YES ABSOLUTELY. Kav or Ford, one of em is lying under oath, can't know for sure who yet. I hope FBI can place them together at party or not

Somebody lied under oath.
@poapoa44 @missidawest @ClintEastwoodLA @Emma19780 @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SenateGOP Perhaps, that is possible which is why FBI investigation is good idea.  my point is go fund me is not being political they are applying their rules/standards.
@charliekirk11 I'm a Dem. but I wish for the Truth to be found out......were they at  party together or not. Interview Mark Judge.........if it turns out they prove Ford is lying and Kav is telling the truth.....so be it. -truth. Somebody lied under oath, I'm not ok with that.

@benshapiro Anita Hill speaks out.....your thoughts Ben? Also, why is Senate not interested in questioning Kav pals, and pals not interested in answering questions? Can't handle truth?!	https://t.co/yrP8lyGqkb
This was a lie, that Woods, said might be true.......do we know the origin of this propaganda? dubious. Pleased Twitter is upholding standards. With great power comes great responsibility https://t.co/PYdLOj7QbM

@brithume asking and answering questions is NOT character assassination it is called congress doing its job......for now Senate is not interested in asking questions of Kav pals, Kav pals are not interested in being questioned. Can't handle truth?! (I remain open minded) https://t.co/cgz9tMxJXi
@MrMikeD42 @charlescwcooke @EWErickson if Senate is interested in truth, they would at least question Kav pals along with Ford. This is don't ask, don't tell, in the worst way
@Swtladee @purplehead5 @StephBest85 @steph93065 I do remain open minded, she could be Anita Hill-totally believable or she could not show up or weird out..not be credible, we shall see. The fact that she is a teacher makes me think, she will be a decent public speaker at least. she does have our attention, that is for dam sure
Will history repeat itself? Again, Senate not interested in finding out the truth. Kav pals wont be questioned Senate not interested in asking, finding out truth. Would we want a SCOTUS justice to lie his way in?	https://t.co/yrP8lyGqkb https://t.co/MnIYXoxQMw

here's an idea, how about Ford AND Kavs friends testify before the Senate, answer questions to get to the truth. Kavs friends not interested in answering and Senate not interested in asking questions of them. Cant handle the truth?! https://t.co/j6Fdolg9Z5

@benshapiro As judge I expect Kav to tell truth, cabinet positions have been denied for smoking pot, for saying masturbation is part of human sexuality, for not filing taxes for house maid.He should also apologize to Ford, say he isn't rapist, or pals must to submit to questioning https://t.co/5cGoTXaPHk
@benshapiro We want a SCOTUS justice who lied to get there? Still believe Anita Hill. Assuming Kav did it, I'd like to hear, "I'm not rapist, but I'm sorry I hurt you. Ford says, You did hurt me, but I forgive you" If he did nothing..I'd like that corroborated by pals in Seanate, no hiding
@RedState Ford will answer questions, kav pals wont answer them senate wont ask...cant handle the truth?! I remain open minded https://t.co/RodkQOI5Ko

@LaunaSallai Is she crazy? doubt that. Was Anita Hill crazy or was she telling truth...I say latter. Ford will answer questions, kav pals wont answer them senate wont ask...cant handle the truth?! I will remain open minded. https://t.co/YHz40bccng

@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr Dowd is right, he is also a Republican, for what that is worth
@StephBest85 Who has said police or FBI or military are perfect? I'd say that Generally they do a good job. Sometimes they do a great job. Sometimes they fail.
@ChrisLoesch Ford will answer questions, kav pals wont answer them senate wont ask...cant handle the truth?! I will remain open minded. https://t.co/ytxaObLZKe
@LauraLoomer @m8nkey2chm00n I support the police
Do we want a SCOTUS justice who lied under oath to get there? Assuming he did something to Ford, I would rather have seen him say, I'm no rapist, but I was wrong, I'm sorry. She says, you hurt me but I forgive you. https://t.co/k7DSYKExV7

Ford wanted anonymity, then was outed in the media, and now has decided to testify.I won't say staling is not a motive, certainly was with Garland, but Trump will get a pick, no doubt, do we want a SCOTUS justice who possibly just lied under oath to get there? find truth. https://t.co/awpwoVrSom

@StephBest85 @steph93065 it is one thing to lie to a lawyer.....very different to lie to Senators asking u questions, can be done but stirs conscience more
@steph93065 why wont kav buds answer questions?	kav stands to make much more $
you mightve heard thats in the works..the kav pals aren't interested in answering questions, senate not inerested in asking them.They want Kav, not truth https://t.co/RBmGFGlLok

@KCNascarFan @charlescwcooke @EWErickson indicates she seeks truth....and will answer questions shes done more sacrificed more to find truth than kav and his pals
@JohnnyAstarita @Irish2510 @stillwaters777 @KCNascarFan @charlescwcooke @EWErickson have kav and buddies take a polygraph then, and be questioned. to me shows Dr Ford is about uncovering truth

you keep an open mind...I'd go 4-1 Kav is lying-testimony important. Also believe Anita Hill. As I'm sitting here watching movie Private School from 1983 it somehow seems more likely that Kav is lying... either way, all should be questioned to get to truth. No lying to SCOTUS https://t.co/oY5A4JN1Wv

incident sounds like an 80s movie. I was in HS in 80s. Thats not what bothers me. In fact if he were to simply have said, I am not a rapist,I was young and dumb, just tryin to score-wrong of me, sorry.  I'd be ok w/ that but have a problem if he were to just lie his way to SCOTUS https://t.co/oY5A4JN1Wv
