@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump By Trump logic, what he says is not always what he has said. It all depends on when he said it and what he said depending totally on what might be more expedient to say  pertaining to right now. They used to call it flip-flopping!
@rolandscahill I agree about Jill ‚ÄúMosquito Lady‚Äù Stein‚Äôs lying ass. Her supporters say she was only in Russia to lecture Putin‚Äôs regime on the need for peace. Maybe she should have lectured on poisoning your political opposition to death instead.
When you sit around the White House watching cable news and then tweet whining about your bad press!   #youarethebitch
When some wannabe, macho man calls a lady a bitch because she admits that his 60 seconds till climax is not enough to satisfy her...#youarethebitch
@HillaryClinton I totally agree that the bigot element was never going to let you become President, ESPECIALLY right after a President Obama. That would have caused the cavemen/deplorables/Trump bigots to commit suicide!
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump @Forbes @JournalistJG Trump‚Äôs Kool-Aid rivals Jim Jones‚Äô, so Trump tweets a fresh batch almost daily to reassure the cult/congregation. He doesn‚Äôt care if you believe it, as long as his cult believes it.
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump @Forbes @JournalistJG Is it John Barron or Dennis Dennison, which one this time? Hillary Clinton gets the name ‚ÄúCrooked Hillary‚Äù based on her perceived lack of honesty/integrity. Too bad she doesn‚Äôt have a White, rich penis. Then she would just be a quote, unquote ‚Äúbusinessman.‚Äù
@ProudResister Michigan Confederates? Really? This reminds me of the old Blues Brothers movie where Jake said ‚ÄúIllinois Nazis, I hate Illinois Nazis,‚Äù and then runs them into a creek via his brother Elwood.

@NancyPelosi @gme11 @EPAScottPruitt It takes a fool to nominate/appoint a fool Nancy. Scott Pruitt is who we thought he was 100% and counting.
@ProudResister @slo52002 The real hoax is Trump‚Äôs quote, unquote ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù to Melania. That hoax is right up there behind the conservative Jesus buying an AR-15 because he supports the 2nd Amendment.
@KaniJJackson @StephMillerShow DEPLORABLE!
@emilyramsey9404 @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump The first thing they teach you in the course Cult Living 101 is to NOT ask too many questions. In other words, don‚Äôt ask questions about how much Kool-Aid is in the cup. Just drink it and be happy!
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump This is no national interest endeavor. This is about personal interest ‚Äî the President‚Äôs personal/personal interests. The two things that make Trump look more presidential and less scandalous ‚Äî the teleprompter and military strikes.
@safeprison @CNN @Comey So you pardon one leaker (Scooter Libby) while sliming Jim Comey for allegedly leaking. I guess leaks are like golden showers ‚Äî not your problem until it is you standing underneath one.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @Comey @RepAdamSchiff In Trump‚Äôs mob boss, narcissistic mind, the only way to show loyalty is through submission, which makes challenging him treasonous in his mind.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @Comey @RepAdamSchiff The FBI and the Dept. of Justice do not work for Donald Trump! Even the average ‚Äúuntruthful slime ball‚Äù is conscious enough to figure that much out.
@rolandscahill Trump calling someone an ‚Äúungrateful slime ball‚Äù is like Jim Jones calling someone a Kool-Aid freak.
@DrJasonJohnson @karenhunter To the hypocrite that says poverty is a cakewalk that people get too comfortable within, give away all of your resources and try it (poverty) sometimes.

@smerconish @CNN @RosenJeffrey And you are not being unfair to Trump, he has bought, paid for and endorsed all of the negativity he gets. HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE, because if you don‚Äôt, then we must hold you (Smerconish) accountable.
@smerconish @CNN @RosenJeffrey I don‚Äôt mean to be an ageist, but based on the unconventional nature of former Justice John Paul Stevens‚Äô call to repeal the 2nd Amendment and the ease of which he thinks he could happen, could his age be a factor on this opinion?
@Thom_Hartmann, I never heard Charles the Libertarian answer your question as to how poor children get a decent education without some form of public schools. The government has a responsibility to the public. Privatization does not!
@TheRevAl @SXMUrbanView @MadameAshLee What about taxes? What about some sort of lifetime tax break/breaks for Blacks/descendants of slaves for the next 100 years ‚Äî some sort of reparation based, automatic deduction? And I mean more than a couple of hundred dollars.
@karenhunter Every time you say 5 minutes of Trump it sounds like you are saying 5 minutes of funk by Whodini.
@JoeSudbay @MSignorile @emptywheel Hey Joe, Signorile, and @DeanObeidallah. What is the progressive equivalent to the hideous CPAC convention? Progressives need a counter to that ‚Äî some kind of ‚ÄúNew America‚Äù convention for the future, because CPAC is all about going backwards.
@TheRevAl Rev., Black people need to be REALLY CAREFUL about signing on to any idea of ‚Äúthose people over there ‚Äî let‚Äôs ship them out!‚Äù The only difference between ‚Äúgo back to Africa‚Äù and go back to Mexico is geographical location.
@AnthonyCGraves @karenhunter I heard you on Karen‚Äôs show. I had to pull over on the side of the road. I was that mad at what you went through. My worst day was your everyday ‚Äî speechless!
@Thom_Hartmann, I listened to you talk about the death of pensions in this country. I used to watch Bill O‚ÄôReilly on Fox, and he would rail against what he called ‚Äúlavish/undeserved pensions that companies could no longer afford to fund.‚Äù

@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Welcome to the Sh*thole Shutdown! #TrumpShutdow #ShitholeShutdown
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer This is not the ‚ÄúSchumer Shutdown.‚Äù This is a ‚ÄúSh*thole Shutdown‚Äù led by an ‚Äúuninformed,‚Äù unhinged, unstable genius.
@karenhunter I was bused to a White school too. And like one of your callers said, I was abused by the 20 to 2 outnumbering White kids ratio, along with their apology making allies ‚Äî the teachers! Two Black teachers in the entire school.
@smerconish @MichaelWolffNYC @CNN @cnni I think you posed a legitimate, journalistic question to Wolff, and it seemed to catch him off guard, but I don‚Äôt care if Wolff conned his way into White House access. The results of the access TRUMPS the slickness of the con for me.
@karenhunter I would say 65% of us are asleep/ignorant/‚Äúmiseducated‚Äù/afraid to wake up/culturally conditioned into accepting the tradition of tradition which is someone else‚Äôs engineered tradition.
@karenhunter I am still floored listening to your New Year‚Äôs Day Bash as Jane Elliott is putting boots to asses with authority! She was mic dropping! Great replay!
@astrologyzone I am Bryan, and I am born on October 11th. Please tell me something. And no, I don‚Äôt believe in astrology, but I heard you on @karenhunter and it found it very intriguing.
@karenhunter I disagree, I think typical, White guy Brian is a bad dude who looks to de-fang the bite of slavery and discrimination TO JUSTIFY HIS generational benefitting from it all!
@karenhunter Lawrence from Texas called Al Sharpton‚Äôs show today and made that same argument verbatim. Just saying.
@karenhunter Damn Karen! That guy actually accused you of light-skinned politics and how that makes you bias against Trump! Now that might be the most ignorant sh__t I have heard any caller to your show utter.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Sanford &amp; Son‚Äôs music is legendary!

@karenhunter Yes, we called ourselves ‚ÄúAfrican booty scratchers‚Äù and ‚Äútar babies. So White kids dogged Africa and blackness, and we obliged! Lurie is right.
@RVAwonk Brilliant tweet!!!!
@MHSexpert @karenhunter Michelle Hope, you make the late, great Dr. Ruth sound like a beginners manual, and Karen Hunter, your foolishness Fridays are a great departure from your norm.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl The selfish desire to keep the worst White man better than the best Black man seems to be the only or main self-interest that counts to a Trump voter.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Trump represents why White America has no obligation to even acknowledge America‚Äôs original sin. The Blacks should just get over it. That is a Trump vote in a nutshell.
@karenhunter Not only does the angry, White guy have an opinion, due to American, White supremacy, he has the only opinion that counts, because he is the only person that counts!
@karenhunter Trump represents the age-old fantasy fetish of the worst White man being better than the best quote, unquote ‚Äúcolored man.‚Äù That is Trump‚Äôs DNA, and his bigots share it!!
@30for30 @RicFlairNatrBoy @JohnCena @MINIUSA This is some great material! ESPN should be doing this more. Who tells better stories than wrestlers? They have truly done it all! I want the Undertaker next, Shawn Michaels, Dusty Rhodes, John Cena!

@karenhunter The original 1974 Exorcist movie with the demon lady with the head turning 360 in the bed and spitting the green puke.
@karenhunter Black people should have their own specialized tax code anyway. Reparations through taxes for say 100 years. Why not?
@lossolidos @karenhunter Blind is blind, and a bigot is a bigot, but her discussion was about Trump‚Äôs chumps.
@Theothethinker @GodfreyComedian @karenhunter @SXMUrbanView And Godfrey, I love how you mock the hillbilly-onics of Billy Jack, Jack Billy and Bubba, and that fiddle is crying funny!!
@karenhunter The blind, unapologetic Trump bigots are a CULT, and Trump is Jim Jones selling Kool-Aid life preservers to oppressed Whites.
@GodfreyComedian Testify Godfrey about the White male phobia of the big, Black penis contaminating Ms. Scarlett!
@thelauracoates No question, statement or aspiration by a woman should surprise anyone anymore. Any activity can be studied by anyone.
@karenhunter And you will get called a racist whenever you challenge that ethnic, societal gravy train, and that explains angry, disgruntled Candy.
@karenhunter White is a default advantage at every level, and the undisputed beneficiaries of advantage will invest all they have into it.
@karenhunter Karen Hunter, you are the baddest radio host alive, and @Kelliprovocate can TRAMPLE me anytime! I know about this stuff.
@karenhunter Karen Hunter, what you did with Tim was clinical and should be used as the premier model for taking a chump to school!
@karenhunter Tamir Rice was a CHILD!!! Open carry goons go into places ARMED, and they survive!!!! Damn Tim!
@karenhunter That man, Chuck D. taught me what it means to be a Black man in America and be proud of it. I owe him! Great show!
@karenhunter How dare Paul whine he can't be good because he's White! Join the club. Blacks have been told for 400 years they can't be good!
@Deanofcomedy You can't find PERFECT, so you pass on the good and get the worst in Trump! Getting even with yourself is not actually getting even!
@Deanofcomedy She said Bernie people felt DISMISSED, but now they are being DISMISSIVE to people like Kamala Harris. HYPOCRISY is self-sustaining!
@Deanofcomedy I agree with the caller that Bernie should have been on the 2016 ticket. Tim Kaine was a DISASTER - like paint drying.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl It sounds like questionable.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Are these videos claiming Blacks In Houston are being left to drown real? I cannot validate this via the news.
@karenhunter Ben Carson has become the get out of racism jail free card! One of your callers played right into it.
@karenhunter White conservatives love to tell us to lay off the race card. Well, I'm saying to them, lay off the Ben "My Negro" Carson card!
@gloriabarger @jemelehill In fact, the National Anthem has a verse in it about slavery that just  mysteriously disappears whenever it is performed or played. WHY?
@gloriabarger @jemelehill The idea of the American police can legitimately be traced back to slave patrols. Football, baseball or soccer, that fact is real.
@VenusLux @karenhunter @SIRIUSXM @SXMUrbanView Great interview Venus! You schooled me on a lot that I did not understand. You sound like a professor giving a college lecture.
@jemelehill People can get mad about the un-whitewashed history of the police, but they certainly cannot change it. Truth hurts when you live in denial.
@lisamurkowski Thank you for standing up to that awful bully in the White House. You don't work for him. You work for Alaskans!!
@Deanofcomedy The "Breaking Eggs" man is right! You have to FIGHT THE REPUBLICANS like they owe you money, because they probably DO!!
@Deanofcomedy Caller Frank was right! Some progressives are more absolutist than the right. Disagree with them, and you are a corporatist!
@karenhunter And trust me, the red, white and blue Trump bigots and regular racism deniers will not be happy about that, and I say screw'em!
@karenhunter One of the things we should put at the top of our political platform is Juneteenth being a federally recognized like King Day!
@HillaryClinton @TomPerez @HillaryClinton @TomPerez  This good-old-boy, American collusion is just as significant, if not more, than Russian collusion.
@HillaryClinton What are the Democrats planning to do about crosscheck voter suppression? Ask @TomPerez . This must be addressed!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl No one would have had to come to that guy's house to get him to vote for Obama. I'll bet you that.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Do people not understand what "yes, we can" really means? It was President Obama's signature message. If you don't get that much from him?
@karenhunter @CousinSyl If the historic election of President Obama taught us one thing, surely it would be the old saying "yes, we can."
@Deanofcomedy Look at it this way Dean. A Farrakhan appearance would more controversial and possibly more consequential than you interviewing Trump.
@Deanofcomedy Be careful Dean about having on Minister Farrakhan. Henchmen will come after you.
@Deanofcomedy The guy from Arkansas was right. I am from Arkansas too, and we got at least three big snows in the winter. Now, maybe one.
@Greer925 Somebody is out to smear your name -- must be a jealous ex or something. Look on Backpage massage. I assume you already knew this.
@karenhunter The South Carolina Black woman that said it will never happen is the quintessential definition of a trained, content, house Negro.
@karenhunter I'm sure they told Harriet Tubman, your plans to help slaves flee North are never going to happen!
@karenhunter So it's never going to happen? That's what they told Dr. King, Marcus Garvey, Fannie Lou Hamer, Frederick Douglass and so on!
@SyntheticMary @DerenNey @NicoleAtkins At least I have a boob. So what I haven't sold a lot of books. Selling books is not everything. Ask Sarah Palin, your first hick goddess.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has to be  the quintessential example of how not sagging your pants can still get you assassinated!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Hey, Black Wall Street was not destroyed over sagging pants -- maybe a White woman but not sagging pants.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Yes, you can pull up your Black pants, but you cannot pull off your Black skin!
@TinaDupuy @SXMProgress @Maggie_McNeill Sex workers are tied to being underaged to generate an emotional, broad-sweeping, condemnation response from the public.
@TinaDupuy @SXMProgress @Maggie_McNeill You cannot stone away human nature, but you can legislate away common sense!
@TinaDupuy @SXMProgress @Maggie_McNeill Great show Tina and Maggie!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl When you are Black, you never know which one you are going to get, but the odds lean heavily towards bad cop and Fuhrman!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl For Black folk, there is good cop, bad cop, and then there is Mark Fuhrman or the cop that pulled out Sandra Bland!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Welfare queen with food stamps in one hand and a bag of dope in the other. The Black face just makes it all come together. It is the glue!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Unfortunately, the accepted image of a person with drugs is the same image as the person on welfare.
@karenhunter When people point to other racism to deflect from the racism they are linked to, it is to minimize that linkage, not server it.
@karenhunter That Paul guy misses the point of your show and a lot more because getting it is uncomfortable and accountable.
@NicoleAtkins @MaxineWaters And Bill O'Reilly is just a pompous creep - an expert on Black people simply because he is not Black!
@NicoleAtkins @MaxineWaters So Maxine Waters is terrible, but Trumpty Dumpty is the new "Honest Abe?" Only in Trump-land!
@DerenNey @SyntheticMary @NicoleAtkins Synthetic Mary, your name is the one thing you are right about - truly synthetic!
Sometimes I have been known to miss class. Too bad I missed you all that one.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Have you all seen the movie "Get Out" yet? It's a very interesting piece of work -- creepy yet mind-boggling.
@karenhunter @GregSnyder And Karen Hunter, your show format is the best on Sirius XM, and I AM NOT JUST blowing smoke! You are unmatched.
@karenhunter @GregSnyder Greg won't let us into his class, but keep coming on with Karen, Greg. I can learn so much from you.
@karenhunter @GregSnyder The comfort zone of what I have accepted as right needs to be fulfilled. Even if it is wrong, it's right for me.
@karenhunter @GregSnyder The story you tell and buy into about yourself replaces the truth, because the story is self-sustaining.
@karenhunter @GregSnyder Speaking Spanish is a dagger to White supremacy. The mere sound of Spanish deflates the bubble of whiteness.
@karenhunter @GregSnyder Self-proclaimed, institutionalized supremacy gets to pick the language. So a native tongue challenges that!
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @GregSnyder Greg is right. There is no responsibility for or to that which you deny. So why acknowledge it?
@HenryLouisGates Black Wall Street! When is someone going to do that movie? It is a bigger hidden figure than the movie "Hidden Figures."
@NateParker BLACK WALL STREET! Is anyone considering making a movie about this? I saw some of it on Dr. Gates' "Many Rivers to Cross."
@NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson Thank the journalistic Gods that there are still brave journalists like you around! BRAVO Ms. Jackson!!
@MakeItPlain FORD hates Hillary. His countless interviews with you prove that.
@MakeItPlain Damn it Mark! FORD mentioned Hillary as a corporatist, but Trump and the mob is dreamland?
@MakeItPlain FORD is defending Trump!!! He is a biased -- always has been!
@MakeItPlain Mark, what did you expect Glen Ford to say? If this was Hillary's Russia mess, FORD would ALL OVER IT!!!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Racism, purposely manufactured racism, is the kryptonite to humanity.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl For the spaceship White man that called and took off his hood, humanity is the kryptonite to White supremacy.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl After Jameis got the kids to say they could do anything they put their minds to, he should have dropped the mic!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Also, James Winston telling girls to basically be passive is a slippery slope based on his alleged transgressions.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl You DO NOT just inspire Black boys. You inspire Black youth, which none of them should stay silent.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl The Kristen Dunst bathroom scene represents Dr. King's point about the appalling silence of the good.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl See "The Book of Eli." The main keeper of the poor is RELIGION. That's the last card in the deck to pacify the poor.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter  @GregSnyder If you change the way you think, you will transform into a new person. No stereotypes necessary.
@karenhunter President Obama also addressed race with his Trayvon Martin comments. Conservatives are still mad about that.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @GregSnyder Greg Snyder is right. It is arguably the greatest most effective manufactured distraction of all-time
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @GregSnyder And NOT Black in America particularly means "better than someone that is Black/not White."
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @GregSnyder For people like Doug from S. Dakota, the main privilege of being White is that it means NOT Black.
@karenhunter But I guess if you are still waiting on Trump to pivot and become "more presidential," then you might be gullibly stunned.
@karenhunter From Russian ties to p-grabbing to deregulations to the wall, the Trump administration's deplorable-ness should shock no one!
@karenhunter Money can't buy love, but some believe it can buy fulfillment. But whatever you can buy, you can lose, so much for fulfillment.
@karenhunter And even before 9/11, one of the main slang terms for Muslims, especially Arabic Muslims, is "sand n*gger!"
@karenhunter When Muslims speak up against terrorism the response is: Why didn't you speak up sooner? Apologize for your people!
@karenhunter To America, Islam is a second rate religion NOT subservient or beholden to White America, whose only real value is oil!
@Thom_Hartmann I see these efforts to criminalize protests with some serious time. Is this the new crime bill, the next prison pipeline?
@TheRevAl Yes Rev Al, Armstrong had some guest on saying videos of you saying kill cops is on YouTube. Armstrong is a church mouse!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Hillary, even as a White woman, was still on the wrong side of the evangelical tracks!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Christians/evangelicals love the conservative, White male, not based on Jesus, but based on supremacies.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Evangelical Mike basically admitted that a good, bigoted conservative justifies a horrible excuse for a Christian!
@SallyQYates Thank you for standing up against that orange bully! You should run for office. I believe you can win. I would vote for you.
@karenhunter Sorry Ron, but God is White, so it is the responsibility of the others to assimilate, or the failure is on them.
@karenhunter Also, there is a stereotypical look, genetically and wardrobe wise, that is associated with being a Muslim.
@karenhunter So when you get Muslims, Latinos, Asians and other nationalities added to the mix, it is much harder to self-segregate.
@karenhunter White boys and Black boys dealt with each other. The concern was absolutely over White girls and Black boys, big no-no!!!
@karenhunter And the 99.9% White faculty did nothing about it. It was just not talked about.
@karenhunter But, even in school we SELF-SEGREGATED, Blacks on one side, Whites on the other during breaks and lunch.
@karenhunter For me growing up, we were forced to socialize interracially at school and work. Outside of that, very little!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl The Emmett Tills of the world have been whitewashed and hidden, like "Hidden Figures," all by design.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl The same people that say pro-life on one hand will say: "That Negro must have done something" on the other.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Hey, Emmett Till done something! That Negro done something! Trayvon Martin done something! White supremacy lives!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl How is "lighter than Chris Brown" typical Black? If he believes that, he is checking a box.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl I say that you can talk to Donald Trump whenever you want, but demand a no cooning, photo-op agreement.
@karenhunter Steve Perry.
@robinthede @NewEdition @BET I am beyond impressed! This movie is better than the Jackson's movie and the Temptation's movie. WOWWWW!
@Deanofcomedy He told Mark he wanted to destroy liberalism yesterday, and Obamacare ruined his insurance. He is full of crap!
@Deanofcomedy That James character is a professional troll against liberalism. He called and trolled Mark Thompson yesterday, same act!
@DrIbram @karenhunter @SXMUrbanView And they didn't even do it!
@DrIbram @karenhunter @SXMUrbanView We already know what Trump would do if a Black shooter did Sandy hook. Remember the Central Park 5?
@DrIbram @karenhunter @SXMUrbanView As Karen says, a White man's ice is colder.
@DrIbram @karenhunter @SXMUrbanView My parents told me that just being in a White school would make me smarter, because they were smarter.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl When that guy that you blistered said he liked your passion, it was phony as a $3 bill.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Passion without purpose is just entertainment -- an angry puppy chasing its tail while the master sits and laughs.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Directionless passion or manipulated passion is what they strive for. Anything else is labeled as militant!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl These bigots say they like your passion, but! Why the but? In other words be angry over Chicago, not over Trump!
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @jamyn @themerklenews Your show is an abyss of knowledge -- extraordinary show today!
@LanceStorm @RandyOrton And, when I looked at Mr. Orton, he reminded me of an NBA player. He is that tall. Nice to meet you sir. Goodbye.
@LanceStorm @RandyOrton Hey Randy, I am the Black guy you saw smiling in the mirror in the Trim Gym you said no pic to, and I just moved on.
@LanceStorm @RandyOrton But hey, I am so glad that this wasn't me that did this at the Trim Gym in Jonesboro. I would be embarrassed.
@LanceStorm @RandyOrton Plus, I know Randy gets a pic request all day long, and he cannot say yes to everyone, so I got the "no" this time.
@LanceStorm @RandyOrton Wrestlers are only in town for some hours and must train and then perform and then be off. Time is short.
@LanceStorm @RandyOrton Yes, I felt bad when Randy said no, but I understand the business and the schedule that wrestlers must keep.
@LanceStorm @RandyOrton I thought this story was about me. Randy declined my request for a pic politely, and I wished him well. #Trimgym
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @SteveAdubato or too politically correct!
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @SteveAdubato It's not Trump's fault for mocking the disabled reporter. It's our fault for being too sensitive.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @SteveAdubato I guess because he is so PRIVILEGED that he feels he has no duty to accountability.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @SteveAdubato Not only can I not forget Trump's PRIVILEGED IGNORANCE, he refuses to accept his accountability.
@Dr_Heavenly @SmilesByHDA @karenhunter It turned the health of my teeth around. I get it at Walmart.
@karenhunter @Dr_Heavenly https://t.co/yeqkCYGaC6
@karenhunter Ever since I have been using Listerine toothpaste I have been cavity free (9 years). Is Dr. Heavenly familiar with it?
@Acosta Don't be intimidated by a fire-breathing hot-head who only barks to distract people from his deplorable bite! HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE!
@Acosta Mr. Acosta, it is my honor to follow you after you refused to back down from Donald Trump. Fear cripples, so don't buy into it.
The govt stops adult Backpage over prostitution, while the Pres.-elect was in Russia buying golden showers via prostitution! #Backpage
@karenhunter No Blacks on "Three's Company" either, not a one. And yes, J.J. Evans got on my nerves to -- comic, shuck and jive relief.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl THANK YOU Cousin Syl!! I am so beyond manufactured religion/Americanized Christianity. Club Jesus is a no go for me.
The real directv promise should be to hire a competent leader that has a brain cell, a pulse, and a plan. #directvpromise
@DIRECTV What Direct has done here is so heinous that someone should be fired and forced to lose their top 1% yacht. #directvpromise
@DIRECTV, Hey, I know you Direct guys are smarter than me. But, take my advice, people do watch football/local channels. #directvpromise
@DIRECTV, I don't know what the CEO of Direct is getting paid, but it is clearly too much based on leadership/lack thereof #directvpromise
@DIRECTV Even if this is AT&amp;T's fault or some local loser, like the President, you Directv will get the blame for it. #directvpromise
I assume Directv will have this issue resolved before the Super Bowl, but I am not feeling very confident at this point. #directvpromise
@DIRECTV I assume that Directv will have this issue resolved before the Super Bowl, but I am not feeling very confident at this point.
@RhondaMiller6 @DIRECTV Directv should square away the local channels first and foremost. Then they can worry about the other channels.
@ang_jjs @DIRECTV Directv has flopped again. And I thought my local cable company were a bunch of losers. Direct is giving them a run.
@Starlitesmog @WLKY @DIRECTV What a disaster! You wait until New Years Day to let this awful, dishonest show drop, disgusting?
@DionneRandy @dallascowboys @COXMG You are damned right! Someone needs to be FIRED over this! This is UNACCEPTABLE!
@ThundercrushR This is hideous!

@lolwhyamihere We are all on LSD!!
@GibsonMenace77 I have seen it all now!!
@DeRay_Shawn @karenhunter The question is, why does this continue to be redistributed? Maybe because unresolved issues tend to do that.
@DeRay_Shawn @karenhunter Yes, like many told Dr. King: If you would be quiet and quit protesting, maybe they would leave us alone. -- NOT!
@DeRay_Shawn @karenhunter For many, it is just easier to stay asleep within the simplicity of stereotypes. Don't challenge my easy!
@DeRay_Shawn @karenhunter Not everyone wants to know how they arrived at privilege, while others don't want to know why they have none.
@DeRay_Shawn @karenhunter When people say they can't deal with slavery, they just don't want to deal with it.
@DeRay_Shawn @karenhunter And for many, the burden of having to paint in detail instead of sweeping with a broad brush is difficult/complex.
@DeRay_Shawn @karenhunter Blind rage is naturally free-flowing, but rationalization requires thought, patience, understanding and truth.
@DeRay_Shawn @karenhunter Difficulty is complex by its nature. It's why everything can't be a yes or a no. So here comes a maybe.
@karenhunter White people distributed and profited from slavery. White people also denounced and fought against slavery. Life is complex.
@karenhunter You are right! Martin's Shanaynay character is a condition not a trait!
@karenhunter The Founding Fathers founded and fathered a lot more than 3/5's of a democracy disguised as freedom -- the worst kept secret.
@karenhunter No law that a White man is bound to respect.
@karenhunter Right, America was NEVER a White country. What they really want is a return to the supreme, unchallengeable, White rule!
@karenhunter The 50 teaches the 20 about P.E./biology, and the 20 gives the 50 a ride in the hot tub time machine, then you have graduation.
@karenhunter So I guess the 50-year-old dating/doing the 20-year-old is like high school part 2.
@karenhunter So what would the cop have to do to Scott to qualify as quote, unquote "malicious" -- kill him twice?
@karenhunter What about this Black juror that told The View that Scott being shot in the back didn't feel malicious?
@karenhunter Now Karen, you can only think like that if you somehow believe the bogeyman does not have his bullseye on you, and he might not, right now!
@karenhunter In other words, Bernie Sanders' campaign got screwed by Hillary's henchmen, so now we are going to screw all of you in the election.
@karenhunter The argument was: Hillary is evil, so we are going to indirectly help Trump who is even more evil to punish Democrats for nominating evil.
@karenhunter I heard many that voted for Jill Stein say they were quote, unquote "teaching the Democratic Party a lesson" when Trump wins.
@karenhunter Yes, the responses to Dylann Roof's killings seemed manufactured from a sorrow that some felt they were expected to display.
@karenhunter Karen, I am from the Bible Belt. The flip-side of the Bible Belt is the bigot belt.
@karenhunter @BigIndianGyasi Obama did move an inch after pressure, but pressuring Trump will be like a restraining order on a hurricane.
@karenhunter @rolandsmartin @CousinSyl Hey White nationalist! If someone undressed me that badly, I would go and sit my ass down somewhere.
@karenhunter @rolandsmartin @CousinSyl Karen, did you see Roland Martin roll this White nationalist like a Ph.D. against a preschooler?
@karenhunter What would Donald Trump have to do to be labeled a racist by Frank -- burn a cross in his one Black friend's yard?
@karenhunter Oh the poor Trump man that believes the way to reach out to Blacks is to say they live in a hell basically of their own doing.
@karenhunter This age-old facade known as the Confederacy is just a racism sanctuary where bigots can put hatred in heritage's clothing!
@karenhunter Donald Trump settles Trump University lawsuits https://t.co/w77Ursw5DY
@karenhunter Remember, Donald Trump recently denied the DNA evidence that exonerated the Central Park Five, so Mike Pence fits right in.
@karenhunter So treaties, places like Standing Rock and lesser neighborhoods become speed-bumps on the road to profit. Just run them!
@karenhunter Capitalism is like show-business. They hypnotize you with the show, and then they plunder you with the business.
@karenhunter In this good-old-day era Trump promised, Bubba didn't have to qualified for the job based on merit. His face was all he needed.
@karenhunter The idiots waiting for jobs to return are really looking for an era symbolized by a job to return -- ignorantly racist!
@karenhunter Not Karen's Party of Lincoln, but Donald Trump's and Paul Ryan's Republican Party.
@karenhunter They might as well say: Hey you dumb Blacks. Can't you see Chicago is a disaster? What you all need to do is vote Republican!
@karenhunter They bring up Chicago to hold it up as the quintessential failure of Democrats in regard to the Black community. That's it!
@karenhunter Is there anything more counterfeit than a Trump supporter, probably okay with Steve Bannon, bringing up Chicago?
@karenhunter Probably not the people in your Trump nation lady.
@karenhunter What a plastic question! Asking why don't people care about Chicago? Since the media doesn't care the people must not care?
@karenhunter Your angry guest had every right to dive on that ignorant woman that kept bringing up the Black violence in Chicago!
@AriRabinHavt The lady in Maryland that hit the Democrat's apathetic stupidity in not supporting Hillary for Gary "Jackass" Johnson rocks!

@karenhunter For that matter, when the militarized police unit shows up in Ferguson, that is a super-predator removal policy.
@karenhunter When Donald Trump says Blacks live in Hell and get shot walking down the street, that my friend is super-predator rhetoric.
@karenhunter I got my ass out and voted!! https://t.co/qbaGzwMn7F
@karenhunter And, did you see the story about 4,000 people in line trying to vote in Ohio? Now that's voter suppression in plain view.

The Mothers of the Movement are more than capable of deciding who they want to support, and they don't need a Cheeto to sell them a zero!

@karenhunter Right on Ms. Geneva Reed-Veal! You are moving me. Your fire is on fire!!!You are a leader.
@karenhunter @JohnFugelsang @CousinSyl In the Bible "Bigot" Trump Belt, the churches are only outnumbered by the bigots.
@karenhunter @JohnFugelsang @CousinSyl Hey, Cousin Sly does not want to live in the Bible "Bigot" Trump Belt.
@karenhunter @JohnFugelsang John is right. Trump did not so covertly imply that Mike Pence would be doing the executive dirty work, not him.
@karenhunter And hate groups are a real problem. This is why Jill Stein saying that Trump and his groups are just a lot of talk is reckless!
@karenhunter When you see the Black body swinging from a rope, fear makes you put the chains on yourself. That's the White nationalist.
@karenhunter I see this White nationalist movement as reactionary propaganda meant to scare progress backwards so it stops on its own.
@karenhunter Lil Wayne can pretend that Black Lives Matter does not affect him. It didn't affect O.J. Simpson either until it did.
@karenhunter Outside of the drugs, Lil Wayne and Stacey Dash sound like they should be dating each other based on how they see Black.
@AriRabinHavt How can a mega population center like the NY, NJ metro area NOT have early voting?
@AriRabinHavt Hey, i heard numerous people calling @MakeItPlain saying they cannot vote early in NY or in NJ. Is that true?
@MakeItPlain @NYGovCuomo @karenhunter Someone needs to raise a stink about that. A Democratic NY has to be better than that.
@MakeItPlain @NYGovCuomo @karenhunter So an Arkansas hick like me can vote weeks before New Yorkers, an important state like NY?
@MakeItPlain @NYGovCuomo @karenhunter So a population center that big has to try to vote on one day only Nov. 8th?
@MakeItPlain @NYGovCuomo @karenhunter New Yorkers calling in to Mark Thompson's Friday night fights kept saying they can't early vote.
@MakeItPlain @NYGovCuomo @karenhunter Is there a legitimate reason why there is no early voting in mega huge (yuge) New York?

@jayXstephens @MakeItPlain @VICE I guess his portfolio and the lack of Whiteness on Herman "Mr. 999" Cain's rusty ass just missed the cut.
@jayXstephens @MakeItPlain @VICE But it's like Donald Trump told Billy Bush, you have to be special to be able to do what I do.
@jayXstephens @MakeItPlain @VICE Sexual allegations made people drop a then leading in the polls Herman Cain like a hot, welfare potato.

@jayXstephens @MakeItPlain @VICE You vote the way you want to. I know I will. But, Trump is full of sh.., selling Mayberry Kool-Aid!
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE And I agree with Mark. He didn't need to pummel this young lady, She just wants to be unique, different.
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE You can't have it both ways. You can't make Trump ties in China and then yell "USA" at home.
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE Trump may have created more jobs than Hillary, but he has also hired more illegals than Hillary too!
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE Why is it that in order to support Trump you have to piss on Obama's birth certificate?
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE All you have to do is say you doubt Obama's citizenship and you're in. You're special!
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE I am amazed at how many novelty acts can get careers, shows and 15 secs of fame off of Obama's birth!
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE She denied that Hillary has a lot of Black women supporting her, but all of her female family is Hillary.
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE What happened to the murky questions she had about it?
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE She didn't believe that Obama's birth certificate is real, but that caller convinced her it is real.
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE She doesn't know if Cosby is guilty based on allegations, but Bill Clinton is a predator via allegations.
@MakeItPlain @jayXstephens @VICE This must be Omarosa's apprentice.

@MakeItPlain Jay Stevens has drank the Kool-Aid. She is a novelty Negro who found a much shorter line on the right wing side.
@MakeItPlain Mark Thompson! You sir have found yourself a genuine, authentic "AUNTIE TOM!"
@DrWLeon Needless to say, he turned it down citing his health. BUT, he turned them on to another Black man who was happy to take the job.
@DrWLeon He also would not have been allowed in the White station either. He said it he wasn't allowed to even look Whites in the eye.
@DrWLeon My grandfather was offered the job of a Black policeman too, and he could only patrol Black areas and arrest other Blacks.

@xonec5 @Lashs So if I decide to vote for Hillary, it will matter not. Other states will decide it. All I can do is cheer from the sidelines

@Lashs @karenhunter The electorate favors Hillary. BUT, that's why they play the game, that's why they have the election. Things happen!
@Lashs @karenhunter All of this poll crap is crap. This election will be won by one thing, turnout! And no poll can honestly predict that.
@Lashs @xonec5 Unless you are saying that Trump is just blowing wind. If he is, the Chinese, Putin and ISIS will make short work of him!
@Lashs @xonec5 You must be calling Trump a liar then, because his main policy is the destruction of ISIS -- translation WAR!
@Lashs @karenhunter Here is what's going to happen. Hillary will be in the White House, while Trump will be on the white horse.
@xonec5 @Lashs Trump is a great entertainer, but that is not enough to win an election. People say they want change, but do they really?
@xonec5 @Lashs But hey Scrappy, your guy has to beat Hillary first, and her ass is just as White as his, but I think she'll get by him.
@xonec5 @Lashs We/us/not you have been sniffing somebody's White ass since 1619, since before Washington. Same old sh*t!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl I woke up in a cold sweat reaching for my teeth! I will never get that image out of my mind!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Also, the scene where the master uses a hammer and a spike to punch out the teeth of his slave gave me a nightmare!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl You can preach the word of God all want, just say what you are supposed to say to keep the shackles on tight!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl How effortlessly and how instantaneously could and can any "exceptional Negro" become regular, old n*gger again?
@karenhunter @CousinSyl The great slave revolt of Nat Turner where the UNTHINKABLE happened -- not slavery, but White people getting killed!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl The master worked him in the field, pimped him out in the pulpit, and beat him like a dog when he dared to complain!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl And, if Nat Turner being hanged at the end is a spoiler alert, you have no right to be tired of slave movies!!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Better to be tired than ignorant or simply not knowing or fully understanding what you think you are tired of.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl A lot of people say they are tired of slave movies, but my cousin had never even heard of Nat Turner!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl I also loved the "Jesus crucifixion walk" that Parker made on his way to be hanged. Brilliant!

@HillaryClinton In other words Mrs. Clinton, Pence did not win by winning. He won by NOT losing.
@HillaryClinton Pence ducked the Trump questions from Kaine, but ducking questions is much closer to an endorsement than a denouncement!
@HillaryClinton Mike Pence does it, and he is crowned champion of the debate -- a smooth, stylish, more polished candidate according to CNN.

@MakeItPlain I want to know if Jill Stein will run for a House seat after this election. If not, why not? You have to start somewhere.

@karenhunter @Toure Because once a Black/non-White person shows up demanding a seat, people feel like their White culture is threatened.
@karenhunter @Toure I guess White culture truly is "Leave It to Beaver" -- a place where White rule is unchallenged!
@karenhunter @Toure Before Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters, golf and tennis were White culture, and Jackie Robinson did it to baseball
@karenhunter @Toure The White House and presidency until recently used to qualify as White culture.
@karenhunter @Toure Public Enemy called it "Fear of a Black Planet." White culture means spaces and places where it can remain all White.
@karenhunter Donald Trump and his angry, White guys! To them, a challenge feels like an assault, and a protest feels like a personal attack.
@karenhunter Tough toenails?? Your 1950s "Leave It to Beaver" has officially left the building sir. So TOUGH TOENAILS back to you!
@karenhunter The Trump trolls define who is or is not an idiot based on their lack of melanin. So a Black 138 IQ is like an 80 for Whites.

@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @Sil_Lai @TruthInReality_ Since the victim is gone, if Parker apologizes does that free up his movie to be seen?
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @Sil_Lai @TruthInReality_ In other words, what would Parker have to do to gain a clean slate? The victim is gone.

@ProgressiveMac @karenhunter The movie is certainly what has put the spotlight on this incident. And if this film does well, more light.
@karenhunter @ProgressiveMac If you were just a dumb kid when you were 20 Mr. Parker, your 40-year-old adult apology should reflect growth.

@karenhunter @CousinSyl Including Black Wall Street! This movie has to be made. This story has to be told cinematically.

@karenhunter @CousinSyl Sooner or later we're going to lose this town. Why shouldn't one of us at least benefit from it?
@karenhunter @CousinSyl I watched "Posse" again recently. There is a line where the Black mayor tells Jesse Lee:
@SpikeLee @iamjamiefoxx Hello Mr. Lee. Based on your outstanding work as a director, you should consider doing "Black Wall Street."
@iamjamiefoxx Hello Mr. Foxx. Based on your outstanding work in "Django Unchained" I believe that someone has to do "Black Wall Street."

@CousinSyl @karenhunter The old saying is young, dumb and full of c*m! I used to be that guy, and I've got the lonely nights to prove it.
@CousinSyl Hey Syl! I think that guy wanted to try your potato salad! Think critically!   Ha, ha, haaaaaaa!
@silky17slim @karenhunter He said he was offended by the term Caucasian, then he attempted to lecture Karen on what her problem is.
@silky17slim @karenhunter This is a sarcastic response meant to mock a rude, condescending, CAUCASIAN man that looked to school Ms. Hunter.
@karenhunter Hey Karen, you know what your problem is? You're too damned intelligent for my CAUCASIAN ass to handle.
@karenhunter @412VC Hey Karen Hunter, that "CAUCASIAN" man was not very happy with you. You dropped too much melanin in his Wheaties! Ha!
@HashTag7even @karenhunter It is the administration/regime that is responsible, not a particular individual that is running for president.
@HashTag7even @karenhunter You cannot separate Condoleezza Rice from George W. Bush, and you cannot separate Hillary Clinton from Obama.
@HashTag7even @karenhunter    I did see reports that it was one Hillary Clinton that pushed Obama to act in Libya, but push is the key word.
@HashTag7even @karenhunter @SXMUrbanView Instructed by who?
@HashTag7even @karenhunter @SXMUrbanView Did President Obama sign off on Libya, yes or no?
@HashTag7even @karenhunter @SXMUrbanView @karenhunter You can only lead the leader when the leader agrees to be led.
@HashTag7even  @karenhunter If the Secretary of State can invade countries and send in troops unilaterally, the Secretary is the president
@HashTag7even @SXMUrbanView @karenhunter The Secretary of State CANNOT go out and invade any country they want without the president.
@HashTag7even @karenhunter The President of the United States is truly the quote, unquote "last man standing."
@HashTag7even @karenhunter  Reagan said if he knew, he is responsible, and if he didn't know he is still RESPONSIBLE!
@HashTag7even  @karenhunter When Oliver North was locked in Iran-Contra, President Reagan publicly took full responsibility in the end.
@HashTag7even @SXMUrbanView @karenhunter After Benghazi failed to derail Obama's re-election, they switched the blame to Hillary.
@HashTag7even @SXMUrbanView @karenhunter President Obama scolded Romney in response saying the buck stopped with him, the president.
@HashTag7even @SXMUrbanView @karenhunter Mitt Romney blamed President Obama to his face for the Benghazi debacle during the debates in 2012.
@HashTag7even @SXMUrbanView @karenhunter The buck begins and ends with the President of the United States. Hillary could not sidestep him.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter Contrary to popular beliefs, Hillary Clinton HAS NOT, HAS NOT been Commander-in-chief as of yet.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter The world is not going to end implies no big deal if a Cheeto wins. Maybe not a big deal, but easily a BAD DEAL.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter Judging by the Supreme Court's gutting of a key part of the Voting Rights Act, it matters who's on the court too!
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter The world was not ending when Abraham Lincoln put down the Confederacy. It matters who is in charge.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter The world was also not ending when Lyndon Johnson was there to sign the Civil Rights Act, but I am glad he did.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter The world was not ending when Dr. King pressed John F. Kennedy either, but King still pressed on.
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter Who is/was the Commander-in-chief during Libya or Iraq, Hillary Clinton or President Obama?
@Thom_Hartmann Obviously so, the peskiness of Ralph Nader meets the narcissism of Donald Trump.
@Thom_Hartmann Why won't Stein run for a House seat?
@Thom_Hartmann She said she had no problem helping Trump get elected, because he has not passed any legislation yet. He is just talk.
@Thom_Hartmann Thank you Thom! All Jill Stein does is troll Democrats every 4 years. That's why I quit the Green Party!
@MakeItPlain @AprilDRyan @SteveKingIA How is Jesus a Western civilization contribution when Jesus pre-dates Western civilization?
@MakeItPlain @AprilDRyan @SteveKingIA That cancels out any sub-group contribution that King can come up with.
@MakeItPlain @AprilDRyan @SteveKingIA There is no contribution greater than the unfortunate contribution of free, slave, for profit labor.
@MadisonSiriusXM  "The Puppet Master" starring Donald J. Trump.   		#Tweettrio
@tedcruz I am a Hillary supporter, and I don't like Republicans, period. BUT, I respect what you did at the RNC tonight. That took guts!
@MadisonSiriusXM Welcome to Paul Ryan's post-racial society, Oscars-so-white, Congress-so-White, Interns-so-White.  #Tweettrio
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @ShaunKing They used to send the lynch mob to exterminate Blacks. Now they send the cops - the legal lynch mob.
@MadisonSiriusXM It's your Rip Van Winkle analogy. The British woke up after the EU vote and said: What the hell just happened?"
@Sil_Lai @karenhunter Being Black is forever having to PROVE or DISPROVE who we are versus who others have deemed us to be.
@Sil_Lai @karenhunter Consider this, for an O.J. to cross over to White, he must be an O.J. (great), but for Whites to cross, you get Rachel
@Sil_Lai @karenhunter That experience seems to be unique to us, Blacks.
@Sil_Lai @karenhunter If we, Blacks, fail it is because we're Black, but if we succeed, it is because we overcame the hurdles of Black!
@Sil_Lai @karenhunter Black in my experience always meant the worst, the last, the least, the ugliest, the other, the outside looking in.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl If the Bernie or bust crowd does not comprehend the importance of the Supreme Court, they are already BUSTED!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl This clown was like a low budget Lee Atwater with his Fisher-Price, Cracker Jack dog whistling!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Give me a fricking break!! The country is in the gutter because Obama talks Black and does Robin Hood housing?
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Karen, boot this in the closet Trump supporter saying that Obama is putting Negroes in White neighborhoods?
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Race is definitely on the minds of the Karl Rove types because the White man is no longer a presidential shoe-in!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Take that Bernie ideologue to school Karen with her sour grapes complaints justifies a Trump presidency crap!
@karenhunter @cpegues @amazon My ears are glued to Pegues' story. This is Karen Hunter University at its purest!
@karenhunter @cpegues Corey Pegues was spitting pure knowledge on the show. That's how you do a real interview. Take notes @REALStaceyDash!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl Stacey "Cooning" Dash is a lightweight that feels special because she works in the HOUSE, not in the field!
@karenhunter @CousinSyl How ironic that when the Evans were in the chow line, everyone saw it, but when they finally made it out, few eyes.
@karenhunter @CousinSyl  https://t.co/7EJHfO3SHj
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter @CousinSyl The Evans family got out of the ghetto! How could you miss that? Thelma was pregnant at the end!
@karenhunter He is lighting his callers up like never before. Wow!
@karenhunter Hey Karen! On a personal note, your impotent comment has really fired up Mark Thompson. I can hear it in his voice!
@MakeItPlain @karenhunter @ministter The Party of Lincoln is like chess. Most people struggle with checkers. I am just saying.
@MakeItPlain @karenhunter @ministter @OfLincoln Ha, ha, ha at going from handsome to impotent. Mark Thompson has cracked me up!!!
@rolandsmartin @karenhunter @MakeItPlain @ministter @OfLincoln Minorities joining and taking over the Republican Party.
@MakeItPlain @karenhunter @ministter You are going to have to quote, unquote "dumb it down" some, so people can catch up.
@MakeItPlain @karenhunter @ministter Karen, you have gone too complex for the average bear on this Party of Lincoln.
@MakeItPlain @karenhunter @ministter @OfLincoln This Karen Hunter Mark Thompson debate is one for the ages!!! I love it!!
@karenhunter @AriRabinHavt  Anyone that hasn't been schooled is either too unconscious to know it, or you just had your first birthday.
@AriRabinHavt @karenhunter So thank you Toyota for introducing me to Sirius XM. It was a game changer.
@AriRabinHavt @LocmarM @karenhunter I think her ideas are more progressive than Democratic in regard to the party.
@AriRabinHavt @karenhunter Too much selective, American Jesus, too much selective 2nd Amendment, too much selective American exceptionalism!
@AriRabinHavt @karenhunter Cable news entertains you. Talk radio, shows like AriRabinHavt, Karen Hunter and Joe Madison, challenges you!
@AriRabinHavt @LocmarM @karenhunter It is because of channels 126 and 127 that I even have Sirius XM.
@AriRabinHavt @LocmarM @karenhunter The fact that AriRabinHavt and Karen Hunter are progressives makes us all winners. Channel 126 &amp; 127.
@karenhunter @DinaRuns @AriRabinHavt Your Party of Lincoln app strategy is BRILLIANT from a primary perspective. You should be in office.
@karenhunter @DinaRuns @AriRabinHavt Bravo! Great debate with AriRabin. Ari is an intellectual juggernaut, but your point won the day.
@karenhunter Right on Karen Hunter!! I like how people call you disrespectful, but CANNOT articulate an example, because he talked A LOT!
@karenhunter @tmwinsett @CousinSyl @SXMUrbanView @cspan Poor Axel, he lost his paper route and he gained a Black president. All is lost!!
@DominatrixDinah Absolutely beautiful!!
@MadisonSiriusXM Presidential condoms, extra large for a Commander-in-Chief with really big hands. #AsSeenOnTV
@MadisonSiriusXM The Washington White Guys vs. The Milwaukee White Bread  #PhyllisSchlafly #baseball
@karenhunter  @CousinSyl There is NO television equivalent to Black talk radio like the Urban View. Social media even offers more than TV.
@karenhunter  @CousinSyl If I beat my woman as the master beats me, he has beat me twice. You can't emulate oppression without oppression.
@karenhunter You nailed it yesterday. Tom is angry because equality feels like oppression coming from privilege. Trump is the savior!
@Jawdaaay If you are going to go out, that is the way to do it! Thank you Daniel!!
@MadisonSiriusXM Doesn't what happened to Chris Kyle (American Sniper) make the case for the need for mental evaluation on gun buyers?
@HeatherBrookebj Thanks @HeatherBrookebj! You rock!!!!
@JohnFugelsang According to Matthew 21:12 with Jesus driving out the merchants and buyers from the temple, he renounced the economy too.
@thelauracoates @karenhunter @KembaSmith This show teaches me the real deal, not how George Washington chopped down a cherry tree!
@thelauracoates @karenhunter @KembaSmith Ms. Coats, Ms. Hunter, and Ms. Kemba have taught me more than I ever learned in school. HEROES!
@karenhunter @KembaSmith Since Donald Trump is not my dad, I don't get those kinds of loans or lawyers. Status matters, so does your wallet.
@karenhunter @KembaSmith My friend had a drug case, but his dad loaned him $10,000 for a dream team lawyer, and he got probation.
@MiguelLloydInc @karenhunter @KembaSmith It's not really about whether or not you are guilty. It is totally about whether you are FORTUNATE!
@MiguelLloydInc @karenhunter @KembaSmith It doesn't matter if it is right or wrong or guilty or innocent, as long as it can be consumed.
@MiguelLloydInc @karenhunter @KembaSmith  The justice system is a Jaws shark devouring any and everything unlucky enough to be in its path!
@karenhunter @Nzinng @SXMUrbanView @CousinSyl I CANNOT believe that caller actually flushed a toilet on live radio and owned it too.
@tmwinsett @karenhunter @CousinSyl OMG!! Women are too emotional? How many men are too brainwashed by their little head with no brain?
@MrCreepyBoss Is the New Day the new Degeneration X in living color?
@_ALLTHINGSWWE @WWE @TrueKofi Is the New Day the new Degeneration X but in living color?
@smFISHMAN Big E shaking his Big Ass is KILLING me!!!
@CSUKTown Agreed, looks like dildos!
@RodneyBowman @karenhunter Responsible gun owner - I know how to load it, and I know how to shoot it. 	Responsible gun owner. That's it.
@karenhunter Way to school the pull up our pants crap. Remember, after Kunta Kinte gave in and became Toby, they still chopped his foot off!
@WillowGirl2004 @TrueKofi @WWE "This is not just my character saying this. Country music suuuucks!" That is the line of the year.
@bwoceo That is the line of the year!!
@OneLgMoose Garth Brooks is rolling over in his tobacco right now!!
@TanyaBalor This is classic tv!!!!
@Dubcart The New Day is killing me!!!!! This is too good!!'
@TheRCWRShow @WWE The match was okay, but watching Big E grinding his crotch is classic. Their match could not possibly live up to that.
@StacyPodelski I agree. I would call the New Day the most entertaining segment on the show.
@StacyPodelski @WWEUniverse @XavierWoodsPhD Big E has turned it out tonight with that bump and grind!
@DRaGoN_KoBRa @WWE Watching Big E grinding his crotch is priceless!
@Blackgold347 @karenhunter @CousinSyl It pains me to admit it, but those racist Tarzan shows is all we knew about Africa. We were so lost!
@Blackgold347 @karenhunter @CousinSyl Thank you again Karen Hunter and thank African Ancestry. Keep opening eyes and minds.
@Blackgold347 @karenhunter @CousinSyl We grew up on old, bigoted Tarzan shows. We were ashamed of Africa. Today, I've never been prouder!
@luckykid92 Seeing Big E dancing and grinding in that cape is priceless!!
@DRaGoN_KoBRa @WWE Zeb is a pro at it! Love his mic skills!
@SpazPhoenix @WWEZeb @WWE Zeb Colter has just made me spit up my dinner in laughter!!!
@BunkiePerkins How in the hell did the Miz get in it???? I thought he was setting up the ring nowadays.
@erb1st @karenhunter @THEREALBANNER David Banner and Karen Hunter personify pure knowledge and an awakening truth! BRAVO!!!!!
@TXPearl @karenhunter @CousinSyl The local Sheriff and a reporter have brought up the fact that the girl punched the officer.
@Blackgold347 @karenhunter The oldest trick in the book is still the most effective, divide and conquer! They already got Mr. Squatter.
@karenhunter @AltheaFilm @rexpix @PBSAmerMasters Truth is always inconvenient to corruption/oppression/supremacy/ignorance.
@karenhunter As long as cops are situationally/racially infallible by default, it is impossible for all lives to matter. #BlackLivesMatter
@SXMUrbanView @karenhunter Bill O'Reilly is a barking bully. Remember how he punk'd Pepsi to drop Ludacris, and he just owns Juan Williams.
@karenhunter @jangaye @SIRIUSXM This Robin Thicke case reminds me of Michael Bolton losing his case to the Isley Brothers in 1994.
@Nzinng Ok
@Nzinng Now that is a very interesting compliment. Thank you.
@karenhunter I too am sorry for not understanding the value of love while happily succumbing to  corruption putting my conscience on pause.
@karenhunter And CousinSyl is right. Domestic violence is a learned behavior. I was a follower not a leader, and I lost a beautiful person.
@karenhunter I used to beat my lady too. We actually beat each other, and I regret consciously signing on to such ignorance, such sickness.
@karenhunter The media is info-tainment. Get more news based on quantity and deeper news based on quality on social media and talk radio!
@AfroStateOfMind @karenhunter @ShaunKing To White supremacy, the only difference between Nat Turner, K. Hunter, and S. King are the names.
@epicarthouse @karenhunter The Republicans are masters of changing the subject and distracting weak. That's how the hierarchy is sustained.
@epicarthouse @karenhunter Fox News is attacking King right now saying that his alleged deceit discredits #BlackLivesMatter! This is Chess!
@karenhunter @AlvinIrby The word gap is real. I was in a remedial reading class for my first 3 years of school. The class was 90% Black.
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpMania I am sure your old pal Vince McMahon would be proud of that hashtag.
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpMania
@realDonaldTrump Great work Mr. Trump. You have made politics interesting and fun using truth and non-political speech. #Trump-Mania
@karenhunter @heyward1971 Without Urban View, people like Karen Hunter and Joe Madison, I would still be a victim of cultural conditioning.
@heyward1971 @karenhunter The question was why a Michael Jordan remains silent on Black issues. Courage on the court is not courage overall.
@karenhunter @heyward1971 And you and others speak up everyday, but some are more than happy to lay back and play invisible. Buy my shoes!
@heyward1971 @karenhunter It is the cultural conditioning of American, White supremacy and even Black billionaires can suffer from it.
@heyward1971 @karenhunter But historically, we as Black people have struggled to do so. For Every Dr. King there is an Uncle Ruckus.
@heyward1971 @karenhunter As rich and powerful as Michael Jordan is, he could have easily been reluctant to make racial waves speaking out.
@heyward1971 @karenhunter Some African-Americans have historically tended to keep quiet on Black issues in fear of White resistance.
@heyward1971 @karenhunter When Serena Williams spoke out on Christian Taylor, critics told her to shut up and just play tennis.
@Sloomzo @TripleH @StephMcMahon Awesome match between Cesaro and Rusev!! You all are getting it done tonight!
@ToriMelching I thought Big Show was going to get jealous, sit on the car and squash it.
@ToriMelching There has to be a catch somewhere, and there it is.
@bjay460 @karenhunter You can put prideful lipstick on a racist, Confederate pig, but it is still just a racist, Confederate pig!
@363Ar_Mando @TripleH @WWERollins Wow, HHH took Rollins to school. Bout time!
@JonColwell @HeymanHustle No one can tell a story like Paul Heyman. Remember, the mic is at least 50% of wrestling, and Heyman nails it!
@RedEyesPage @karenhunter These are the same charlatans that will happily sell you wolf-tickets to the post-racial society.
@RedEyesPage @karenhunter I argued all weekend with fools that say Roof is mentally ill, but Trayvon and M. Brown got what they deserved.
@karenhunter Let the Confederate flag hang in a museum. That's where you put ancient artifacts, and the Confederate flag is an artifact.
Obama thinks Confederate flag 'belongs in a museum' http://t.co/NMOGt6sKc7
@memeographs @DennysDiner @nikkihaley Poor Gov. Haley. I think she would rather kiss Caitlyn Jenner instead of taking down that flag.
@karenhunter The Confederate flag is racism. They dress it up as Southern pride, but White supremacy is always behind the costume.
@Kevin4theWin @CSUKTown I agree. It does nothing for me. You can only suspend your logic to a point.
@Flowinslow @DrJasonJohnson @karenhunter This Dr. Jason is the real super Dr. This is who we need to hear from. Great interview!!
@Kevin4theWin @CSUKTown Yes, like #Vince McMahon in the infamous, exploding limo.
@cuomo_ Brook looks like Rainbow Brite!
@TNADixie The smartest thing you did was getting #TNA off of Friday nights. Wednesday or Thursday is as good as it gets. King of the Mount!
@TNADixie
@QuincyLovesBBWS He ain't too dumb. He got over off of a program that you say is worthless.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Get real! AA created opportunity, so the Indian guy posed as Black and took advantage. He admitted it.
@QuincyLovesBBWS You think he did it for a fashion statement or a dare?
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter If AA is worthless, then why pose as Black? WHY??
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Ohhhh no you didn't! Karen Hunter did not make this guy do what he did. Cursing or not, he still did it.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter If it didn't help, then why did this guy pose as Black?
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Are you serious? You don't think AA helped anyone? Why did Karen interview the Indian guy who posed Black?
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Tell me what exactly did AA do? Who did it help? Did it help at all?
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter And you don't think AA played a role in any of that?
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Evolution does not include everybody, never has.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter And AA ensured that some non-Whites will get in the same way that James Meredith got into Ole Miss.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Remember, they didn't even want to let the Little Rock 9 into high school, much less Yale or law school.
@karenhunter @QuincyLovesBBWS You can be qualified all you want, and many Blacks were, but Yale still didn't always have to let Thomas in.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter If the govt does not combat discrimination through things like AA, we'll be back to bus boycotts and sit-ins.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter It is the govt's job to ensure that no business can use taxpayer money to discriminate. If not govt, then who?
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Remember, discrimination was legal and within the law. You have to have a policy to address that.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter There were plenty of talented Black people that couldn't get a job scrubbing toilets without fighting for it.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Just because you are ambitious and determined, it doesn't mean that somebody didn't pave the way for you, AA!
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Your can't say AA played no role in your employment. If AA got Clarence Thomas on the court, you benefited.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Really, how old is old? How far behind you is your shadow? It's always just close enough to remind you.
@karenhunter @QuincyLovesBBWS AA is not to appoint Flavor Flav as president. It is so we don't need a bus boycott just to be a janitor.
@QuincyLovesBBWS Okay, be safe bro.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Racism is the greatest vampire of all-time, not even sunlight will kill it. It's a philosophical cockroach!
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter To automatically claim that it is not racism is balderdash, self-preserving balderdash.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter AA is to keep corruption as honest as possible. Otherwise, you get the good, old boys network.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Sometimes it did. Sometimes it didn't. But when you are the only Black from 30 Whites, is that a coincidence?
@Starlett1130 @karenhunter Relying on the conscience of the oppressor is like the slave asking the slave master to borrow his whip.
@Starlett1130 @karenhunter Without Affirmative Action, all you really have is the conscience of the oppressor. We've been down that road.
@VijayIngam @Nicole_B7 @karenhunter There is a much broader canvas through diversity, only a narrow, elitist bridge in the hierarchy.
@VijayIngam @Nicole_B7 @karenhunter Discrimination that creates diversity is better than discrimination that only sustains the hierarchy.
@QuincyLovesBBWS @karenhunter Not as condescending as the generational damages of institutionalized racism. Nope, not that condescending!
@kimaraines2 @karenhunter There are plenty of qualified Blacks out here, but many companies have a token rule, 2 to 3 Blacks is enough.
@ghamilton1213 @karenhunter The best thing about posing as Black is the societal and genetic ability to stop posing when the gig is up!
@nmbr1analyst @karenhunter It depends on if the car was new. Cops will profile even a Toyota if it looks new. They'll say you stole it.
@SXMUrbanView @deray @karenhunter @SIRIUSXM Racism is about the distribution and the denial of power, and that's since day one (1619).
@_crunchTyMe @karenhunter @CousinSyl @Blackgold347 Thuggery has no color. You can't corrupt corruption just by putting a Black face on it!
@_crunchTyMe @karenhunter @CousinSyl @Blackgold347 Now I don't have a problem with the word "thug," as long as it is distributed equally.
@_crunchTyMe @karenhunter @CousinSyl @Blackgold347 Once again, Karen allows her guest to speak openly and fully regardless of disagreement.
@_crunchTyMe @karenhunter @CousinSyl @Blackgold347 Agreed, and also that critic that accused Karen of not letting her guests opine fairly.
@Lucks4Losers Rollins is sweating bullets!
@K1NG_IC3 BYE BYE SETH!!
@Radical_Ruby GAME OVER!!
@JCHComedy @FightOwensFight Yes, that was a far, far cry from the Insane Clown Posse!
@kakakittykat My Lord that was corny!
@jerseyborn1971 BOOOOO!! This was corny! Slamming a celebrity! Booooo!!!
@SmarkNMark_PW Yes, it seems that rap has gone the way of Doink the Clown. Sad!
@JRRestaino And Reigns on the other hand, still has not mastered the art of selling his character and that is why Seth Rollins is up.
@JRRestaino I mean, Bray just completely stole that moment from Roman Reigns and his "I'm pissed off" act. Bray's promo rendered it void!
@JRRestaino True! One would think that Bray would be a lot bigger than what he is. WWE has been known to squander good talent.
@coolmoetee @karenhunter Did anybody consult with Africa on this homecoming?
@coolmoetee @karenhunter It's amazing how certain Americans feel they have the right to order some of us over to another continent (Africa).
@Starlett1130 @karenhunter But, the not so mysterious absence of Black history is by design.
@Starlett1130 @karenhunter I have a college degree, and I was blank on Black Wall Street as well. I found out about it on Facebook.
@nikkiatmademama @karenhunter @CousinSyl Not only do you allow your guests to make their points, you let that critic make his point. DUH!!
@karenhunter @keithellison Mr. Ellison was a great guest. Great call Karen. The 7th degree for the super Dr. should be in ego management.
@karenhunter @keithellison Mr. Ellison knows how to hold a conversation when it's time to talk instead of giving an impenetrable lecture.
@karenhunter @keithellison Mr. Ellison was more engaging, more positive, more inspiring, and more informative than yesterday's super Dr.
@karenhunter @keithellison Hey! Now that was a real interview with real constructive dialogue. Makes yesterday look like 6 degrees of blah!
@MiguelLloydInc @karenhunter A degree is not bulletproof. Common sense can always pierce that armor.
@MiguelLloydInc @karenhunter True, there is a huge difference between a dialogue and a lecture. 6 degrees and he can't figure that out?
@MiguelLloydInc @karenhunter A person can have 100 degrees and still flunk humility with relative ease.
@MiguelLloydInc @karenhunter BUT, you held your own Karen, and actually made a lot more sense than the super Dr.
@MiguelLloydInc @karenhunter You can't debate with a 6 degrees person and not have the dunce cap  unceremoniously placed on your head.
@MistressDiane He was either a moron or an amateur or both.
https://t.co/9NUys4Scll
@Inveni_Te_Ipsum That is true, and AxelMania has to be the best jobber in the business right now. He has Mizdow's old role.
@TheLoveViper @HulkHogan Curt Henning must be rolling over in his grave!
@chuckimos This is crap, and we know that Cena and the big dumb brute will fight at Wrestlemania.
@WWE_SonicMan @WWE For a minute, I thought Cena was about to turn heel.
@Yaddiiee_ @RealCurtisAxel @JohnCena @WWE Axel has picked up where the old Damien Sandow left off.
@CoachBrian13 Yes he is! Talk about mocking Andre the Giant? Axel is vandalism spray painting Hulk Hogan.
@EST_1389_MAD That is true. Cena vs. Axel?? Oh Lord no!
@T_MacTigerz13 They are dogging Cena tonight!
@WAiGGerg @WWEBrayWyatt @WWE @TheWAiG If Jim Jones could wrestle, he would have been Bray Wyatt.
@kechavis @TheDamienSandow @WWE Yes, Sandow is finally interesting to me. He actually entertains me now. Great character!
@LeBatardShow Supporters of this loose cannon Vanderbilt coach represent generic testosterone run amuck.
@LeBatardShow Dan, these guys that are bashing you are the proverbial blood lusters in the Roman coliseum yelling "kill, kill, kill!"
@LeBatardShow Face it Dan. You are simply too intellectually complex for the Neanderthal meatheads that worship sports.
@LeBatardShow You are killing them Dan! Spot on! People don't like bosses anyway, much less when they are verbally abused by them.
@C4FromIceGrill Yes it is! That dumb ass European siren sounds worse than Roseanne Bar scratching a chalkboard.
@ccropf1 AGREED!!! That was the best mic job that I have seen Reigns give to date!!!
@Albert49ersfan3 Paul Heyman tells some great stories. I love listening to this guy, and I never thought I'd say that.
@hammeronfire11 True, Road Warrior Hawk has already hired a lawyer for copyright infringement.
@achiago True, the hall of fame bound Bushwackers put on a much better show than these Ascension suckers.
@LeonSaul96 @WWE The Ascension is like the Road Warriors for people that can't afford YouTube!
@SCFC_WWE That's why Randy Orton is so good! You cannot read him! His poker face is phenomenal! You can't trust this guy, and I love it!
@FearlessRiOT True, not too many times you'll see a reigning champion looking punked out with his own belt getting waved in his face.
@ona_monday And you know what sucks? I actually liked the crazy R-Truth much better. You know, him and Lil Jimmy!
@TSGreatMoments Andre the Giant never bored me like the Big Show bores me. He is the proverbial glass of water during happy hour.
@shenolovebug My Lord, the Big Show could bore the paint of off vandalism!!!!
@TheSmackWSD @RandyOrton @TripleH @theAuthoritah I guess Stephanie is wearing the pants in this family.
@Texas_MUFC Lord I have no use for the Big Show and Kane. They look just like two big slobbish pallbearers!
@qosn1fan @karenhunter Yes, Karen Hunter is fire today! Keep giving it to the Salty Dogs of the world Karen, they have earned it!
@TyRellington GREAT BRAWL!!!!
@breepolarbear The Big Show has never done jack sh*t for me. The most insignificant big man of all-time.
@SeanAnubisWWE @WWEDanielBryan @WWE The most and only entertaining thing about Big Show is his big paw slap. That's it!
@joeymatrix17 @TripleH @StephMcMahon @WWE I totally agree! When I identify something as un-entertaining as the Big Show, I'll let you know.
@NishoSoulCTL Naomi just out wrestled a Hart!
@Noughtii_faya And #Cesaro does very little to tickle my fancy as well. I don't understand his purpose on any level.
@WWERetweeting I'm happy that the #WWE has finally figured out what to do with #Mizdow.
@BourneThrilla They are supposed to be like the new Road Warriors, but supposed to can be severely overrated.
@TheChaosBlue Seeing Big Show punch Kane is the most impressive thing that big idiot has done in a decade!
@Tonycancelliere Amen!!! These two big duds are professional flunkeys!
@OrangeCrush83 And I am especially tired of the Big Show. This guy is so uninspiring. He kills suspense without even trying.
@Jay_Leo_618 Yes, the Ascension reminds me of why there will never be another Road Warriors.
@MShadows17 This is why having the old WCW around was a good thing.
@Brittney_Lynn22 My Lord they are terrible and so predictable. The #WWE's handicapped matches feel just like cold, day old pizza!
@MarkinOut Yes it is. This is the old, Eric Bishoff, CRAPPY, NWO, leftovers plot.
@tejones But the "innocent Big Show?" Really Stephanie? The heelish Big Show is about as innocent as a $100 bill in a massage parlor.
@WWEDanielBryan @WWERomanReigns @KaneWWE Did Stefanie just say the "innocent Big Show?" I didn't know you could pile bullsh*t that high.
@23kujoxxxl I can't remember when Axel wasn't a jobber.
@MichaelKeskeys Mr. Perfect is rolling over in his grave.
@AndreaBTRFan1 Yes, the Authority's plans are so predictable, it's almost verbatim.
@courtneyann104 @WWERomanReigns This is garbage at a premium! I'd rather watch the old midget wrestling instead of Big Show.
@Nichtsmehr Yes, and this Big Show vs. Roman Reigns rivalry is about as entertaining as a 1980s rerun.
@POPMYFLASH And here comes the Big Show trotting his big blocked headed ass down to the ring again. What an uninspiring heel.
@LeBatardShow And who was that hobbit dweeb Liam that monitors your show? He reminds me of the third-grade hall pass monitor.
@LeBatardShow Hey Dan, you are right. All of this save the children crap is totally crap! Kids see and do worse on the school bus!

@SVPandRussillo #AdamSilver's decisive response is so strong-handed that some people might be saying David who? Stern who?

The Undertaker's streak ends by author Bryian R. http://t.co/eII2pleVg4 via @youtube
RT @MikeyOsiris: Undertaker's wrestlemania streak is officially over.	Thanks Obama.
Consider this, now we have to live with #BrockLesnar and Paul Heyman, and we will NEVER hear the end of it now! Woe is me. #ThankYouTaker
@OSProWrestling And the #WWE is DOMINATING the  wrestling world with the streak ending. Honestly, it was a gutsy move!
#thankyoutaker Thank about it. As #TripleH would say, the #Undertaker 's streak ending is "good for #WWE  business." Check the fallout!
@OSProWrestling Great point, from Andre the Giant to Brett Hart, to #shawnmichaels to Ric Flair, the greats have lost on the way out.
@gandalffffffff I did expect #BrockLesnar to end the streak, because I had a feeling the #WWE  would not let the #Undertaker retire 22-0.
@PowerbombJutsu King bored me to death with that. He sounds like a walking stereotype. The Pope was much better.
@PowerbombJutsu They are building the #CreepyBastard up because he is one of their few interesting characters.
@tannerbleakley if Vince McMahon was in #TNA, he'd be world champion in a month.
@Seanjohn2484 Yeah, and this #CreepyBastard dude reminds me of the proverbial "Strangler Murphy" character that beat up Herman Munster!
@TheAcidWords LOL!! Best move I've seen all night! #WWE vintage WWE move!
@LadyVipress And losing #AJ Styles certainly did not help!
@ssvbmr @TheRealAlSnow I don't think it matters who takes over. You could have #VladimirPutin take over, it would still be poorly written.
@Reaveta Okay, #Tnathursday is the mostly made up of the B team alternative to the #WWE,
@SamIsShaw This is why #TNA  is what it is! Velvet turns heel! Even undiscovered tribes in the deepest Amazon knew that was going to happen.
@SamIsShaw I think you are onto something.
@francisco_playa Is Velvet going to turn heel on Madison Rayne?
@gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING I like the #BeautifulPeople, but I think that era is over.
@JaySantyPSW @WWE @HeymanHustle I agree. I laughed my ass off when Heyman soiled #WWEBrooklyn.
@Disha_Gaber The #WWE is in #Wrestlemania mode, and they are not taking their foot off of the gas now.
@CeNation_Always I am amazed at how the #Undertaker still displays such a strong intensity even after all of these years.
@JaySantyPSW @WWE I thought it was hilarious that Paul Heyman would take a cheap shot at #WWEBrooklyn.
@metalhead684 The #Undertaker alone is enough to put the #WWE miles ahead of other wrestling organizations.
@aj0314 For Brock Lesner: "Let's do this" is like Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address!
@GrahamStills91 That's why Paul Heyman earns a paycheck.
@Fallen_Angel356 @WWE Not many people call out the #Undertaker. #BEASTvsSTREAK
@intlwresnetus @WWE The WWE is in full throttle tonight! They got star power, and they are using it in full force!

@Clean_supreme This is why the #WWE is the premiere wrestling organization! It is not afraid to make history!
@Daveskins89 Only the #WWE could pull this off! This is awesome! This is why #TNA is just not there yet!
@Churnsawesome94 @WWE Will the #Undertaker do a #ShawnMichaels and announce his retirement after his big #WrestleMania match?
@Nick_Tylwalk The #Undertaker has the most intimidating ring entrance of all-time!

@davidtrentman That is sad, but true! The unofficial "Stalker" is carrying it.
@Camerondlatham8 Yeah, #TNA is still waffling in the mediocre mud. I keep waiting on them to land a legitimate player. No such luck!
wwe raw Kane is nothing but a big clumsy ape in a monkey suit. If he can do #WrestleMania, #danielbryan certainly can.
#WWE #Wrestlemania So come on people. Will #brocklesnar break the streak? I really thought Shawn Michaels and Triple H were going to do it.
@Jay_Royalty @WWE We have been so lucky to have witnessed the greatest fighter in #WWE history.
@NathanWrestling @WWE The WWE always steps it up during #Wrestlemania season.
@yo_its_caylea That's the thing about the #WWE, they can just pull out a hall of famer whenever they need to!
@PixelateNY #Undertaker is the undisputed star of the #WWENetwork. This match will trump them all!
@MShadows17 Will this be the Taker's last ride? I think it might be.
@ItsKhloeHoe_ The Taker vs. Brock Lesner!! This is why the #RAW WWE is truly the big leagues!

@Cruz0881 True, because Bully Ray certainly ain't no Undertaker!
@RaineV1 And this Alpha Female looks like Beth Phoenix in a car wreck!
@Jocay_BSC She looked like an ugly Beth Phoenix, Beth Phoenix -- the human flesh eating zombie version!
@SCsirens @alphafemale1 What kind of crap is this? Who is this cave woman? Was she using the the old "Master Lock" from Chris Masters?
@wrestlingmark88 Yeah, is that Jeff Hardy in zebra prints?
@timmy8271 Yeah that is true, but unlike Hulk Hogan, at least MVP can still execute a wrestling move.
@AL_NorCal @BruceBlitz @lowry288 I understand that, and I agree! But at least stay a good "B" league. Sometimes they slip down to F!
@WeAreInsideGeek LOL! Look at Spud! Is he auditioning for Magic Mike, the Hobbit edition?
@EsotericVortex @The305MVP MVP was always underused and undervalued at #WWE like a lot of other Black wrestlers not named The Rock!
@sladewilson79 Man does that leave much to be desired!
@kaoteek @TherealAbyss I never understood the purpose of Abyss either. He never even sold me on him as a bad guy wrestler.
@CEOVinceMcMahon @TheRock @steveaustinBSR @JohnCena @RandyOrton Please come back Vince and strut to the ring in your billionaire suit.
@regansteen @WWE Yes, this could be the greatest overrated series involving two future hall of famers of all-time!
@regansteen @WWE And his RKO/Diamond Dallas Paige's old WCW "Diamond Cutter" puts me to sleep.
@RandyDeArteeest @WWE @VinceMcMahon Come on Vince! Come back to RAW and strut into the ring in your billionaire suit.
@regansteen @WWE I actually like Orton's body stomps, an ode to the old, Garvin stomp. The great Ronnie Garvin!

@notthefakeSVP There is an old saying called "taking the Browns to the Super Bowl," which is the punch-line for dropping a load. Not good.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III I just feel like Sherman's Stanford degree should not have to exonerate him from someone else's stereotype.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III Sherman is not a thug. And getting animated should not be an indictment, and for most people it is not.
@notthefakeSVP The Heat jerseys give you some idea. That plain brown is empty.
@notthefakeSVP Don't you think the fireball scorching opponents is more effective than a brown?
@notthefakeSVP Do the Browns have the most bland uniforms in the NFL? The helmet looks more orange than brown. It's too abstract.
@notthefakeSVP And I heard you talking about the Cleveland Browns yesterday. Would you agree that the team name stinks? What it is a Brown?
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III And imagery is a powerful, effective marketing tool. Capitalism thrives on it.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III And this is not an attack on Van Pelt or you Brian. This is about the power of imagery.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III It just seems to be a lot easier to assume that a Sherman is a thug, than to assume that he is not. Why?
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III The real question is this. Why does the thug label seem to belong on a Black person so nonchalantly?
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III And why does Sherman have to whip out his Stanford degree to prove that he is not a worthless thug?
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III If all I have to do is get animated to be labeled a thug or an n-word, that's what I have always been anyway.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III The American image of a thug is young, Black males with sagging pants looking to rob or shoot you, period.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III It's the same principle that allows people to believe that the word "welfare" is synonymous with Black too.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III It's certainly not Justin Bieber egging his neighbor's house.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III The most effective image of a thug is Trayvon Martin sneaking up behind someone to play the knockout-game.
@notthefakeSVP @JonGalt_III The basic definition of n-word, worthless Black individual. Based on crime rate demographics, so is "thug."

@elo_bajo To be perfectly honest, I would have inducted Macho Man Randy Savage into the #WWE hall of fame ahead of the #UltimateWarrior.
@elo_bajo Agreed! There is no #WWE as we know it without the Macho Man Randy Savage!! If they don't put Savage in, Vince is truly a dickhead

@GStuedler I think that anytime someone or something can convince you to knowingly vote against your own interests. That's leadership.
@RobEjr Hey Neal Boortz, the Ku Klux Klan knew quite a bit about the Black experience as well. What's your point?
@GStuedler Some of the most influential, charismatic leaders of all-time basically only led the their lambs to slaughter. Happens a lot.
@GStuedler Agree to ask you to reconsider, because people have been getting led to the woodshed ever since the beginnings of time.
@jillosopher Yes my friend, the cheaper the crap, the more accessible it becomes.
@DonnaDee479 @abc If President Bush had killed half as many big name terrorists as the Obama administration, they would build statues of him
@JulieKayJKLD LOL...,well put!
@DrewHampshire If Chris Christie can't go, they may turn to "Old News" Newt in the face of desperation!
@GStuedler The GOP does exhibit leadership even if the direction being led is ass backwards!
@jillosopher Almost everyone who has ever lived has had weight issues of some sort at some time. The human was never designed to be perfect.
@jillosopher @ritaag Apparently Chris Christie is addicted to Russian Roulette!

@CMarPA The Casey Anthony trail has gone from "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit," to "Dead baby; the killers maybe!"
@PomPrincessMomJ You let your dead or missing child go unknown for 31 days without reporting it, and see how it turns out for you or me.
@Twitlertwit True, if Casey Anthony knew her child had drowned and let the searches continue anyway, she should be held as liable!
@PomPrincessMomJ The only thing missing from the Casey Anthony trail was a bloody glove and a White Ford Bronco!
@MiiSS_LoViNg I'm done with Geraldo Rivera. He just called Casey Anthony a good mother; said sexual abuse made her lie! Screw you Geraldo!
@kelly_carlin @whoiswillo And what's so bad is, Casey Anthony is free to party on, and have another child!!!!! Who's going to stop her???
@Nanmac3109 @tigressreow @hilltophereford I guess this makes Jose Baez is the new Johnnie Cochran!
@RippDemUp Before I'd ever cut a program like Medicare, I would nip the Bush tax cuts in their elitist bud!
@JuliaAdair One of the biggest and greatest hijackers of the Constitution are the bigoted interpretations of the Holy Bible!
@CallOutJoe @joenbc @morningmika @donny_deutsch Corporate slave owners don't want to pay anything, not taxes or wages!
@haymakers @joenbc Taxing the rich is not unfair. It's just a requirement that they do their share!
@FRwritings @cspan So very true. When you argue with a fool, the fool just found company!

@Sttbs73 Yes, the individuality of a political, ship jumper is a top threat to conservatism!

@RippDemUp They blame it on system faults, but the baby momma blames it on you, and then gets mad if you can't pay her out of pocket!
@RippDemUp They take money from you every week, but may not send out a check to the mother for up to 3 to 4 months. You'll have to cover it.
@americanincan Anthony Weiner will make an excellent talk show host; MSNBC or CNN!

@MiltShook Agreed, if Obamacare is the scariest mud they can sling on Obama, turn out the lights, the party is over!
@MiltShook @author_bryian_r Good luck. Obamacare is the GOP's socialistic, overspending, smoking gun, even if that smoke is just hot air!
@Shoq @barackobama We went from a wannabe Texas cowboy/frat boy to a calculating scholar. Gotta love an upgrade!
@MiltShook C'mon you know the answer to that question. Drum roll please, and winner is; from the questionable state of Hawaii--Obamacare!!!
How did birtherism become more credible than climate change? If you don't like the facts as they are, just make up your own!
@kate_sheppard Tim Pawlenty's comment is just more proof that rational, ideological evolution can always work backwards!

@AngryBlackLady There are certain parts of me that jump up whenever you post!

@livecut @cynthiaboaz I don't blame Obama. I blame the media married committee, because that was a ratings pick, and we know it was!
@Khel_Naru @huffingtonpost Obama was the sexy pick for the committee. It was all about style. What else could have possibly been about?
@Khel_Naru @huffingtonpost The committee just wanted to take the prettiest girl to the prom; regardless of how the night might turn out!
@livecut @cynthiaboaz If you want to get technical, no president should even be considered until later on near the end of their term!
@livecut @cynthiaboaz Agreed! The Obama selection was premature at best. Basically, the committee jumped on the "Yes We Can".bandwagon!
@cynthiaboaz I think that when you kill a killer it cancels itself out as a violent act against peace. Somebody might want to look that up!
@craftyme25 How many innocent people were unarmed on September 11th? The day of reckoning catches all who attempt to flee from it!
To Osama Bin Laden, no ideological point is worth the lives of thousands or merely worth the life of one!
I haven't celebrated because the U.S. killed Bin Laden. My only point is this! What goes around comes around; Muslim or Christian!
@Eldomiche If Moammar Gaddafi or Osama Bin Laden had access to unmanned drones, they'd be bombing their enemies at home and abroad.
I would even argue that if President Bush didn't answer back in 2001 he wouldn't have won the Republican nomination in 2004 or re-election.
The American people were not going to sit around and wait on the next president to act if Bush had decided to do-nothing in 2001.
@PaulBiler On Sept 12th of 2001, there was no way that President Bush was going to be able to get away without doing something.
@MH_liberal @ingrahamangle Obama is smart. There should be no more doubt about that fact.
The major question is if President Bush does not initiate the Afghanistan move; would you have Bin Laden at the bottom of the sea right now?
@rolandsmartin You shouldn't be surprised by Bin Laden hiding behind his wife. He didn't board those planes on Sept. 11th either!
