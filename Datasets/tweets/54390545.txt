Marzian: "Elected officials, especially a lot of old white men, feel compelled to legislate from Frankfort on what women can do and not do."
Marzian: "It's very tongue in cheek and why I did it is we have about 5 or 6 anti-choice bills pending in he current general assembly."
Marzian: "It has awakened a sleeping giant and I think young people especially are just outraged and I've had so much positive feedback."
@HaverOfOpinions The lawmaker is being purposefully outlandish, to make a point about a recent new abortion law in Ky.
