NEW: In a letter today, 71 organizations strongly urge all House Members to support the historic package of democracy reforms contained in #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. 		Read it here --&gt; https://t.co/pnWUx32Uvn https://t.co/HLN16H0YT8

BREAKING: @HouseAdm_Dems just passed #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. This package of pro-democracy and anti-corruption reforms will put power back in the hands of the American people by ending the dominance of big money in politics.
This means the public financing system will be entirely self-funded at no expense to the taxpayer.
For the purposes of CHA's #HR1 markup, we cannot add the specific funding provisions given germaneness issues – what we have done is strike any taxpayer funding, established a dedicated trust fund and implemented a strict sequester provision.
That way the people’s voice and priorities are heard in Washington – not just the wealthy and well-connected.
Since day one, it has been our commitment to build a voluntary alternative to the prevailing campaign finance system – one which leverages the power of small donors to combat the influence of big-money politics, raise civic engagement and amplify the voices of everyday Americans.
Public financing is about advancing the public interest, not special interests.
Right now, corporate America and big donors fund campaigns in America. #HR1 would change that with a matching fund system that makes every day Americans just as powerful as the big-money crowd.
#HR1 creates a powerful and sustainable way for candidates to run for and win office without having to rely on wealthy donors and corporations.
Dark Money groups and special interests are getting their money’s worth today. @HouseAdmnGOP have churned out a slew of last-minute amendments in an effort to obstruct the markup of #HR1, a once-in-a-generation reform bill to clean up Washington #ForThePeople

The #voterSuppression subpoenas seek private voter information -  including actual absentee ballots cast in previous elections. The burden imposed on counties to produce vast quantities of docs will make it hard for county election boards to be prepared for the upcoming elections
The motives behind this overly broad subpoena request are obvious: The subpoenas were sent to the state elections board and 44 county elections boards – many of which are counties with populations that are disproportionately poor and black.
@realDonaldTrump began his Presidency w a lie that 3-4 mil votes were cast illegally in 2016. He followed this by creating a sham Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, committed to perpetuating the myth of voter fraud &amp; suppressing the vote. They found no voter fraud.

Congress must recognize that an attack on any state’s electoral infrastructure is a direct threat to democracy in all of America.
#Elections2018 are already underway, there's no time to waste. The GOP must help appropriate the critical election security funding that states need in the 2019 Financial Services and General Government Approps bill &amp; to bring the Election Security Act to the floor for a vote.
Yet 2 years after Russia’s sweeping attack on our political democracy, &amp; despite repeated warnings – including a new admonition from Special Counsel Mueller just yesterday that election meddling operations by Russia are still occurring – House GOP have inexplicably refused to act
We are shocked that House Republicans failed to appropriate a single dollar for states’ election security in the bill passed by the House Committee on Appropriations.
We proudly secured $380mil to help states upgrade their voting systems, but that alone isn't enough. The Election Security Task Force reports that states will need an additional $1.2bil to secure their systems &amp; replace outdated voting equipment that is most vulnerable to hacking

@RepZoeLofgren highlights that part of addressing security efforts for our elections includes paper ballots
#Dems are ready to protect #democracy by providing funding for state IT infrastructure and cybersecurity for elections. #Republicans choose ignorance and obstructionism to protect @realdonaldtrump over the American people and democracy
One key part of our report on improving #election security is to provide adequate funding to help states upgrade &amp; maintain their IT infrastructure.		Updating voter registration databases are a priority for most states.
@RepBrady - #Trump administration’s top intelligence officials said that we know Russia is specifically targeting the 2018 elections – and yet, they have done nothing to protect us – even with a the 1st primary election ~ 3 weeks away https://t.co/1CMXoqbkyU
#FollowtheFacts – Russia targeted voting systems in 21 states. @realDonaldTrump has done nothing to counter their attacks on our democracy despite his admin admitting #Russia is gearing up for the 2018 #election.

This is how the Smithsonian is preparing to stage a national conversation on race – via @NMAAHC:	https://t.co/0yg84Ym18g
After yesterday’s hearing, read about what it’s like to be as the Secretary of the Smithsonian:	https://t.co/42zMhg8a95
Skorton: W/continued support of CHA, Smithsonian will be an even more important,relevant,&amp; unifying presence in an increasingly diverse USA.
Skorton: Planning &amp; design phase will be completed by July 2017, &amp; will help refine scope of project &amp; cost estimates.
Revitalization will be substantial – an estimated 6-7 yrs - and NASM will be shut down and reopened incrementally.
CHA seeks more info about the anticipated cost of the project; perhaps private partnerships &amp; gifts could help reduce federal funds.
CHA wants to ensure revitalization will be cost-effective, structurally sound &amp; safe, utilize the proper technologies &amp; retain public access
Skorton: New exhibits will have richer content, will engage visitors of all ages &amp; backgrounds, &amp; emphasize importance of flight to all.
The revitalization will require use of Federal appropriated funds for exterior and structural repairs at the main museum building.
Renovation cost will be highest in history of NASM and exceeds the total cost of construction for the Smithsonian's NMAAHC.
NASM was designed for 2 million visitors but exceeds up to 7-8 million annually, thus increasing wear &amp; tear on building &amp; infrastructure.
In 2009: @RepBrady held a hearing on public health &amp; worker safety @ NASM. It's critical 4 CHA to understand fiscal implications of rennov.
@RepBrady spoke with Sec. Skorton yesterday &amp; is committed to working with him for a successful revitalization of this amazing museum.
Secretary David Skorton oversees 19 museums &amp; galleries, 20 libraries, the National Zoo, and numerous Smithsonian research centers.
Did you know that Smithsonian’s @airandspace holds the largest collection of historic air and spacecraft in the world?

Base limits are an important safeguard against corruption. Overturning aggregate limits will allow base limits to be easily circumvented.

Overturning agg contribution limits will set a dangerous precedent that could lead to the elimination of all limits. #SCOTUS #McCutcheon
#SCOTUS already agrees contribution limits combat corruption and the appearance of corruption. What has changed?
#SCOTUS should apply- as it has in the past- a deferential standard of review when it comes to Congress regulating campaign funding.
#SCOTUS already overturned key part of #VRA. Overturning aggregate contribution limits will further erode our democratic foundation.
