there seems to be widespread feeling, including w/ certain Democratic ranks, that Hillary got savaged bc she kinda deserved it; she was 'bad' candidate. she wasn't 'transparent.' and then if Dems run a different woman, none of the huge double standards will apply to her.
by all indications lots of women may run in 2020--and that's great. I'm big fans of many of them and would love nothing more than see one elected. 		but this idea that the wreckage Hillary faced in 2016 has somehow passed is, i fear, naive.
note on Pelosi: watch what's happening to her, regardless of how it plays out, and understand there was still a massive double standard for how women are treated in politics. 		and then understand what that means for Dems in 2020.

he claimed there was a home invasion yet police made no arrests nor any mention of that....I mean, it’s Tucker Carlson folks

counties have been dealing with mismatched signatures for as long as AZ has been holding elections—none of this is new
the pace f corruption, authoritarianism was frantic. unlike anything we’ve seen to date
hard to imagine, but this may have been the most dangerous week of Trump’s presidency
and yes, it’s chilling to read in age of Trump
