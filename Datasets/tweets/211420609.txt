#OnThisDay in 1872, Yellowstone became our nation’s first national park. #OH15 is home to Wayne National Forest, and protecting our public lands and waterways is important. That’s why, just this week, I voted for S.47, one of the biggest public lands bills passed by Congress yet. https://t.co/keyYtsEumY
Happy birthday to our great state. Ohio joined the Union on this day in 1803. https://t.co/SWdNke796J
Appreciated the opportunity to visit the Columbus VA. We share many common goals including suicide prevention and stopping the misuse of opiate prescriptions among our veterans. We have a moral obligation as a nation to care for those who defend our country. https://t.co/xmv8SzjT1L

Deeply saddened to learn of the cowardly terrorist attack on an Indian Central Reserve Police Force in Kashmir yesterday. The United States stands firm with our Indian partners in condemning the #KashmirTerrorAttack. We must fight against terrorism in all of its forms.
Our economy is founded on ideas. If we want to be successful, we must protect those ideas. Glad to work with @ChrisCoons on the STRONGER Patents Act so that inventors have the certainty they need to create the next big thing. #PatentsMatter https://t.co/g9Ge9FaXPX

Honored to be joined by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Ashenhurst for tonight’s #SOTU. She is a tireless advocate for #OH15’s veterans. There are plenty of issues Congress disagrees on, but caring for our nation’s veterans isn’t one of them. https://t.co/Sz4rrMe6P4

I trust that all parties are working in good faith, but the temporary nature of government funding allows time to verify that trust.
I support this compromise and it should be passed and enacted immediately. In addition to getting federal workers their back pay, it creates conditions that will spur action to secure our border, including with physical barriers where needed.
Today, @RepBeatty and I introduced 2 bills to fight veteran homelessness. They’ve risked their lives for us; this is part of the larger commitment we must make to our veterans.		→ HOMeS Act: https://t.co/givaL4nh1a	→ Homeless Veterans Legal Services Act: https://t.co/dVT1G1H2cx

My prayers are with the Bush family and friends.
Whether it was serving in the Navy in World War II, as CIA Director and UN Ambassador, or in the White House during the Cold War and Desert Storm, President Bush spent his life dedicated to advancing our country’s standing on the world state during challenging times.
Our country woke up this morning to the loss of a true American patriot. George H.W. Bush was the representation of what it means to be a servant leader.

Congressman Steve King’s recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate. We must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior.
I was appalled to hear about the abhorrent mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue yesterday. As a veteran, I have fought overseas to defend our First Amendments rights, which includes the freedom of religion. Anti-Semitism is inexcusable in this country, and everywhere.
I want to thank the law enforcement officers and postal workers who have worked to prevent these bombs from being delivered and detonated. I look forward to learning more as authorities have now taken a suspect into custody.
With these threats and acts of violence, we have truly seen incivility at its worst this week. We must not let our political disagreements get to a point of violence.
This is not a complicated or partisan issue: whether it happens to Republicans on a baseball field, or to President Obama’s family, violence is absolutely unacceptable.
The National Veterans Memorial and Museum opens Saturday. Honored to have been a part of this project, and thrilled that people from Central Ohio and across the country will finally be able to visit and remember the sacrifice and service of our veterans. https://t.co/MaBPIdislA https://t.co/M2Camfw0Bs
We must unite as a nation, and not allow political or policy disagreements to lead to violence.
This year, @RepBeatty and I wanted to show that you can disagree without being disagreeable and that violence CANNOT be the answer, which led to the creation of the Civility and Respect Caucus.
The end result of incivility is violence, and that is exactly what we are seeing today with multiple bomb threats.

We cannot tolerate this behavior, and if the facts show Saudi Arabia was responsible, I would support a response.
Freedom of the press is pivotal to our democracy in the United States, and I have fought overseas to defend it. Recent reports about the apparent murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi are tragic and extremely concerning.

I was proud to support this legislation, and hope we can use this time to find a permanent solution to provide long-term reauthorization to programs like the Violence Against Women Act.
Moreover, this legislation fully funds our nation’s defense, increases our military readiness, dedicates nearly $7 billion to combat the opioid epidemic, and provides important funding for medical research, education, and job training.
Today, the House voted to keep the government open, extend the Violence Against Women Act, and provide critical resources to help the victims of Hurricane Florence.

RT if you agree that the #Pakistani government must solve the murder of #Ohio resident, Ahmadi Muslim &amp; humanitarian, Dr. Qamar.
My letter to @JohnKerry is just a small step towards #justice for Dr. Qamar, who's murder deserves the condemnation of the US and #Pakistan.
We must ensure the government of #Pakistan begins to protect its religious minorities, especially US citizens who travel to the country.
Violence against a #US citizen on account of his peaceful #faith cannot stand. RT if you agree #Pakistan must protect religious minorities!
The murder of Dr. Mehdi Ali Qamar, a humanitarian &amp; one of my constituents, illustrates why #Pakistan must stop violence against minorities.
