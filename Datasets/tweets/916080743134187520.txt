@FlowingLily @DaveCoIon I think you need to learn more   About These issues before you team up with BDS antisemites.Bigitory has no place Whether it comes from a white nationalist or BDS.
@FlowingLily @DaveCoIon Israeli Arabs fully participate in Israeli election.If that right would be granted  to the constituency of Arab countries including the Palestinian governed areas -peace would have a better chance.

@rabbijilljacobs I don’t think he defines strength exclusively in military power as you are inferring . Do you only see power militarily?
@braunold Netanyahu has not defined weak or strong exclusively in military terms although you seem to attribute his statement as such, Why?
@aarondmiller2 If it’s meant just as a punitive measure it will be worse than useless. If it׳s in the context of changing the dynamics of of Palestinian rejectionist and belligerence it should be applauded
@YousefMunayyer In 1948-49 took in hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Arab countries without help. The Arab refugees from the conflict in Israel settled in the countries of the respective invading Arab armies.  They continue to be exploited as a weapon against Israel.
@McFaul If the Ambassador wants to be taken seriously he shouldn’t try to defend the indefensible. The only party happy with the Iranian nuclear deal were the Mullahs and their henchmen.
@desslocktx @SohrabAhmari @jpodhoretz @AbeGreenwald @NoahCRothman The Wolkenfeld article is great
@jnj_kahl We must pursue peace and put Assad and his Iranianian allies on trial for war crimes
@jnj_kahl How many Palestinians living in Syria did they slaughter?
@jnj_kahl Why are there thousands of Iranians in Syria?
@bungarsargon @SalazarSenate18 I think you are projecting  and think  only minimizing Orthodox Jews and trashing Israel can you be a true .
RT @DavidSamuelMay: That time you wrote an article defending a person who takes hard anti-Israel positions and defends them by erroneously…
@jstreetdotorg Has those government institutions given a statement ? Most people see how UNWRA is an incubator of hate and we need to find a better way to administer to the needs of the Palestinian people.
@DanielBShapiro @SethAMandel The previous administration  circumvented final status issues with no  Jewish settlement even in Jerusalem .Some of this is a corrective of these misguided policies that entrenched Palestinian position beyond negotiation.
@giligetz Thanks: if these are just a matter ofpunitiave measures this is not good policy.If it’s part of a larger policy to incentivize the Palestinian leadership to genuinely help the Palestinians and stop the incubator of hate it can be good,
@Ron_Skolnik This is great news.Too long groups have weaponized the issue of Palestinian refugees to quash any opportunity for the two state resolution.
@giligetz The distinction between UNRWA and Hamas inGaza is a bureaucratic issue. The challenge is to disburse aid to the Palestinians in a productive way .UNWRA has been a factory of hate and this has got to stop.
@DanielBShapiro @Dave_Harden O of course it’s EU money that’s paying for the kleptocracy and Qatari money paying for  the terrorist compensation .If course, USAID is just going  for humanitarian aid. Let’s find a way to help the Palestinians and even increase aid but let’s get it right.
@_Goldwasser_ The issue is the efficacy of it’s disbursement. Hopefully aid will be reinstated and it’s disbursement  will genially help the Palestinian people instead of paying for a kleptocracy  and compensation for the murder of Israelis
@jjz1600 The Palestinian Administration has been recipient of billions of dollars of aid but it all went to Arafat’s wife and Abbas’s family and friends? There has to be an accounting......
@DanielBShapiro @Dave_Harden What happened to the monies earmarked for democracy promotion? How is there money going to pay compensation for the murder of Israelis!?
@dylanotes @_Goldwasser_ There is a general consensus among the security establishment  and those for  a two state solution that UNWRA is no longer the best way to distribute humanitarian aid
@YousefMunayyer The Crux of the problem is Palestinian https://t.co/DRXGMYFU8j’s easier for the Palestinian leadership to wallow in  hate against Israel’s than make hard decisions for Peace .This has been going on since 1948.
@LaraFriedmanDC “Huminatarian” ?!come on
@_Goldwasser_ Sharon delivered Gaza  to the Palestinian Authority and not https://t.co/QwtBwL2zxz , The went from Israel’s control  to the frying pan into the fire.
@_Goldwasser_ The Oslo accords completely collapsed months before after the Camp David summit with President Clinton, Arafat and Batak.Arafat rejected the perimeters and sent an onslaught of suicide bombers killing hundreds of Israeli. Your crafting facts to fit your narrative
@bungarsargon High time for integration .
@BitarSaif @Peace2Palestine Our focus can’t be hate on the Israeli’s but unshackling the Palestinian from the Islamic fascist  Hamas and the P A kleptocracy No
@Sargent_Sellers I denounce  Iran for killing and displacing untold numbers in Syria and Yemen 	I denounce Hamas for abusing Palestinians  	 And most of  all I denounce you for not knowing good from evil
@DanielSeidemann If we call for free election and other political rights like those granted in Israel and the the U S  in the Palestinian governed area .... freedom for Palestinian and peace for all would be on the horizon
@YousefMunayyer O the suspense....whoever are you going to implicates?
@DanielSeidemann BDS tactics include the dubious claim that “we just want to end the  occupations”. This was a victory against BD S that dates from 70’s.
@YousefMunayyer So let’s call for a free and fair election . The anti-democratic forces can be defeated in Gaza and the West Bank and the introduction of proper governance can bring peace
@AmLawAlumBR @aarondmiller2 “Destabilize ״?! Hundreds if thousands killed ,millions displaced , and untold suffering.A misplaced post war reconstruction effort along with an abrupt military and  political exit allowed this slaughter to transpire.We can devise other policies that can curb Iranian aggression
@Moriel_RZ Last time I  went through security at Ben Gurion  it turned out the fella doing the interview and me were at the same wedding two nights before at different tables . We both  thought the band was great and the food not so good . But  it was a delightful wedding
@ezalmanov @_Goldwasser_ @bungarsargon There are different levels of observance from different people  Under  different circumstances but support for Israel is in line with the teaching  of Chazal .The upsurge of self reverence  and secular liberalism is antithetical to our tradition and cause for alarm
@ezalmanov @_Goldwasser_ @bungarsargon “Traded in” ?! The Jewish people ‘s return to Zion has been a 2000 year dream .Those that take our ancient  liturgy seriously  don’t see a trade in but a realization.
@DanielBShapiro Once more, they see things through the distorted lens of Westchechester County and are locked into this paradigm
@bungarsargon Secular liberalism is  the elitist  ideology that justify their material success and has corrupted the body politic . The epitome of social justice is supporting Israel
@bungarsargon Economic warfare against a people is an  ancient form of attack or aggression .as a people we need to aggressively  fight against it
@bungarsargon “Social justice” the context of this week’s parsha has nothing to do with the contemporary social justice movement popular  inAmerican society today
@MomentMagazine @nathanguttman You have an Orwellian sense of humor. “Peace groups “ really!?
@abesilbe Beinart, independent of Glick’scomment, is s blow hard and shameless opportunist that has lost much of his journalistic credibility
@Ron_Skolnik If she was interested in Justice, equality and peace she would be spending her time unlocking the Palestinians from the shackles  of their respective  oppressive governments  .Her  position is based on hate and not justice ,equality and peace,
@jacobkornbluh @bungarsargon Those views on something 6000 miles are indicative of a value system that will inform her voting.These values  willl be destructive to the U S because it’s predicated on hate.
@EWilf @jstreetdotorg It would also be fair  to ask  if any of its citizenswould be treated fairly . Looking throughout the region including the Palestinian governed areas it would be a degree of disaster for everyone. The essence of our challenge is helping the regions people have better governance
@YousefMunayyer @RashidaTlaib @IfNotNowOrg @jvplive It is understandable that you think if a Palestinian state is created  it will be like the oppressive and murderous regimes already in the region. But this is the essence of our challenges
@IlhanMN This era has unleashed a torrent of baseless hatred. I am sorry to see you are part of the problem and not the solution
@AnnVieuxCarre @bungarsargon @RashidaTlaib She also supports BDS which resembles policy that Nazis initiated against its Jewish population
@AnnVieuxCarre @bungarsargon @RashidaTlaib She calls for a “one state solution”this a euphemism to destroy the Jewish state.
@bungarsargon @RashidaTlaib How could J Street endorse someone that in effect calls for the destruction of Israel and still call itself” pro-peace.”It long ago lost it’s “pro Israel “mantra.
@aarondmiller2 The larger risk was enhancing Iran’s ability to conduct  a policy of destabilization across the region while allowing it a pathway to the bomb and an ability to deliver it
@AliAbunimah Reminds of Of the Stalin-Hitler alliance
@DandiaAsad @bungarsargon @jdforward We can only yearn that one day maybe the greater Arab community living in Arab governed countries will have the political rights that exist and are exercised in the Jewishdemocratic state of Israel
@AsaWinstanley Israel accepted and agreed to the U.N. partition plan of two states  The Arab countries attacked the and in the subsequent lost nearly  one percent of its population.The question remains the same today ,”When will Palestinian saccept responsibility and stop the hate
@palestininianpr @Peace2Palestine Israel initiated a blockade only when the Hamas governed area initiated attack into Israel .If Hamas would spend more time providing for its citizens than fostering hate everyone would be better off.
@bungarsargon @AdalahEnglish @AdalahCenter @PeterBeinart Liberal Zionism is alive well and is representive in the many liberal Zionist political parties in the Kenneset.What has never been s potent force in Israel is liberal secularism.
@truahrabbis @BtSIsrael If Truah was really interested in Justice and peace their focus would be on proper governance it the Palestinian governed area .Oncethey stop fostering hate and assume responsibility  for their people peace will prevail.
@RVilkomerson If you were serious about combating authoritarianism instead of trashing Israel your focus would be on Hamas,Palestine Authority, Iran ,Assad ......where there is real suffering.
@doctoreebs @AliAbunimah Let’s stop blaming the Jews for the misfortune of of the Palestinians and work on changing the climate of hate and work for peace
@doctoreebs @AliAbunimah Israel is upward from 80% Jewish and th Jewish National state.Instead of any self reflection,or meaningful thoughts of reform you just scapegoat the Jews.If the shoe fits......
@doctoreebs @AliAbunimah Your answer to everything is blame the Jews.Stop the dishonest refrain .
@doctoreebs @AliAbunimah You should be asking .”Why hasn’t the Hamas regime been able to provide basic services to it’s own constituency״.The reasons they are too busy  stealing money from it’s people and deflecting serious reform  with claims that we need to kill Jews . It needs to stop
@doctoreebs @AliAbunimah Let’s stop blaming  and fighting against the Israelis and fight for the Palestinians. A responsive government for the needs of it’s people.
@doctoreebs @AliAbunimah If the Arab Muslims  in the Palestinian governed areas were given an opportunity of free expression and participation in the body politic like in Israel that might go a long way in instituting the proper environment for peace
@doctoreebs @AliAbunimah You may not think that Israel’s self-defense action are not calibrated correctly but once the culture of hate stops peace will prevail.
@doctoreebs @AliAbunimah The Israeli people crave for peace the Palestinian leadership has been at war with the Jewish state.Once hate is not  fostered peace will follow
@AliAbunimah You make it sound like this all happens in vacuums: let’s work together and reform the oppressive and terrorist regime and build a just leadership in the Palestinian governed areas .Firstly,better the live of the citizen and make peace with Israel
@Ron_Skolnik @JewishAgency If that is the case,Im Turzu is a great organization and all Zionist should be grateful for their contribution.
@aarondmiller2 @lisang Many people justifiable oppose the bill but the misrepresentation of what the bill say and does along with the language of certain critics  to discredit Israel needs to be addressed
@SaeedKD @OwenJones84 The London based Iranian correspondent is not a responsible source of information. Iran has murdered more poeople inSyria ,Iraq ,Gaza and Yemen .....
@_Goldwasser_ Oh yeah it’s the Zionist cabal again .You can be be a featured speaker in Charlottesville 2
@bungarsargon @EWilf The loudest voiced in non Orthodox Judaism is liberal specialist. North American Jews are also fleeing from this trajectory.
@rabbijilljacobs @UNRWA @NYJewishWeek UNRWA is an incubator of hate against Israel .To move the peace process forward we need to address the exaggerated refugee numbers and disabuse the Palestinians of the notion of destruction by resettlement.
@perrycammack @UNRWA UNRWA is corrupt and an incubator of https://t.co/184QFNPFwz needs to be seriously restructured
@bungarsargon Tannin is not a victim but a tool of a repressive regime
@truahrabbis @rweingarten @JTAnews Truah rabis  continue their policy of Israel bashing and than in hopes of absolving themselves say they are against BDS while creating the atmosphere where Israel hate can prevail. As we enter Elul z’man I hope they turn to tshuva
@PeaceNowUS It is important if we want to movethe peace process forward the Palestinian refugee inflation and delusion of resettlement  must be addressed  head on .
@truahrabbis @rweingarten @JTAnews Why is that even on the teachers agenda?How about the killings in Chicago?The misogyny in Saudi Arabia?The kleptocracy In Palestinian government poverty in India .... who wants or need love like that?!
@RVilkomerson Vilkomerson epitomize the era of lies.For shame
@rabbijilljacobs @EgSophie There are Muslims in the Kennest
@JZarif Please moderate your governments action in the name of the Iranian people
@giligetz @JeremyBenAmi @simonerzim The law went through revisions within the different government factions,mutple parties voted against it, and thousand protested against the law, I imagine the democratic process will see other revisions to the law Stop with the assault on democracy
@JeremyBenAmi @giligetz @simonerzim The constant attack on  the Israeli democratic process is misplaced and anti democratic.Just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean it is an attack on democracy.Your campaign against Israel is anti democratic
@URJPresident There is a fight for greater religious acceptance in Israeland even more a great fight to preserve Judaism in North America  but this Wall fetish has gotta stop.
@jstreetdotorg Critics!? They collaborate,scheme ,and lend a hand to those that want to inflict harm to Israelis
@AmosLibby @RVilkomerson Let’s stop the hate and work for peace
@DanielBShapiro To be against the Iranian regime is not “Islamaphobia”it’s a call for justice fair the Iranian people
@RVilkomerson Yes the abuse in the Palestinian governed areas are just horrible,killing, hone killing ,intolerance of gays,incitement to murder Jews.Let’s work to help our Palestinian brothers and sisters
@simonerzim It sounds terrible .I am glad you could tweet . I want to know other amenities you have beside a cell phone to https://t.co/31vJd3iPSm understanding they only alllow two food entree to choose from? Please let us know what you decide and we can protest the terrible treatment
@simonerzim The problem is there is not enough of advocating for human rights  for Palestinians, Arabs ,and Jews in the Palestinian governed area and Arab counties in general.
@rabbijilljacobs @joshnathankazis Liberal-secularism dates back to the Protestant reformation and a big diffence between chesed and liberal secularism
@giligetz @IfNotNowOrg @BtSIsrael So organize your own trip.Your    benafactors have deep pockets
@Steven_Strauss @bungarsargon Obama redo?
@bungarsargon I think it’s obvious large swaths of the Jewish public in Israel and the diaspora are to differing degrees opposed to the bill. “Racist” is just bait journalism.
@Ahmadinejad1956 @kampeas @realDonaldTrump Please just stop the corruption and sending Iranian money away from its people to adventures in Syria
@bungarsargon “Not praise” Assad?! The Assad /Iranian axis is slaughtering hundreds of https://t.co/adkTkbBS6d honest Palestinian activist would be to try to focus attention on this massive bloodletting.
@jstreetdotorg We aid to go to the people not the terrorist infrastructure
@benmurane @_Goldwasser_ It all matters how it’s disbursed. If goes into the coffers of people  who incite to kill and  those that actually murder it would be a bad thing.
@noyam כל הכבוד
@jstreetdotorg @rabbijilljacobs @PeaceNowUS @truahrabbis @NewIsraelFund @rhreng The are so many good arguments against the legislation.The word “incitement “is so misplaced.
@HenMazzig @jdforward I am a ashkanazi hetro Zionist ,good to be in the same club with you.
@rabbijilljacobs It’s seems that you will disseminate anything that diminishes Orthodox Jews.
@MariamBarghouti We need help in mobilizing the world to stop the ongoing slaughter of Palestinians by Assad/Iran in Syria.
@harryreis @_Goldwasser_ The fight against BDS  or Israel bashing should be be anchored in the progressive community.More often than not they serve as partners with the refrain “I am against .... but they are important voices.”
@bungarsargon Let’s hope that one day soon the people of Iran will be free
@dylanotes @_Goldwasser_ They have not  clearly recognized the Jewish state and have mobilized all their resources to inflict  harm instead of enhancing their own population.
@_Goldwasser_ @DavidHarrisAJC Wrong question!Do you believe that the Palestinians want or think they need peace
@TamaraINassar There are individuals in the army which review the events You wouldn’t know about individuals in a democratic civil society because where you live if you don’t toe the line.........
@Sikkuy @rabbijilljacobs @Haaretz Right after the incident in Adam... This campaign might be best redirected in a more constructive way
@skjask Now In the U S Truah Rabbis and J Streets are  running a campaign against “Israeli incitement”?! You can’t make this up it’s crazy
@YehudaKurtzer There are many who are opposed to the ill advised legislation. What’s dissappointing is the lack of leadership in the American Jewish community for not defending Israel in light of those that exploited the issue to bash the Jewish state.
@bungarsargon @PeterBeinart Why that issue? In Chicago dozens of people are killed and wounded every weekend or as British citizen shouldn’t he be speaking about the lingering effects of colonialism on it’s subjects.Maybe the Hamas’ oppression of the Palestinian people which also impacts innocent Israelis.
@AGvaryahu @_Goldwasser_ בגלל הממשלת המדינה הצביע בעד. ואו ‘ם לא השתתף בכלל.אולי תתקבל עוד יותר תרומות מחו״ל להלחם נגד  המדינה?!
@IfNotNowOrg @URJEisnerCamp @nfty “I” “me””personal ״ “my “can you get  beyond Yourself?
@Algemeiner Camp Ramah does a wonderful job in conveying love of Israel and the Jewish people
@Ron_Skolnik Just point out one phrase or word that conflicts with democracy.Or are you saying being Jewish  is anti-democratic?!
@PeterBeinart What is Hamas? What is the Palestinian Authority? Those focusing on the “occupation”    will bash Israel .Those focusing on creating circumstances for proper Palestinian governance will seek peace.
@_Goldwasser_ @bungarsargon @nikkihaley Yes
@HFACDemocrats @RepGregoryMeeks Yes,long overdue.We need to call both governments for what they are.Iran was a good start .
@rabbijilljacobs @NYJewishWeek No ,that extremist  on both sides are not informed by our tradition but believe their individual enterprise constitutes what is holy
@NPMPParty @Peace2Palestine To get proper governance we need to remove Hamas and reform the Palestinian Authority and then we speak to The issue of peace between Palestinian and Jews
@RepBrendanBoyle Time for an H R
@DanielBShapiro @McFaul The people stand with McFaul whatever your politics
@LaraFriedmanDC We need to advocate for the Palestinian people who are oppressed and terribly exploited by Hamas . I hope we can speak to this issue if we really want to achieve peace
@LaraFriedmanDC Gaza’s governing authority has embarked on campaign to violently attack the people  of Israel. Israel  has devised different tactics to blunt these attacks.Let’s work for the cause of peace and be truthful.
@rabbijilljacobs @truahrabbis @BtSIsrael T’rua and Btsisrael continue to do the bidding of their benefactors at Open Society Foundations and partnerships with BDS organization to attack  Israel I hope  For them truah is call for t’shuva
@schadenfraade @birthright Who was the brave one ?You argued with armed soldiers protecting you and other innocents .The others just walked off the bus.
@McFaul Mr Ambassador no normal person takes these charges seriously
@Gisha_Access @_Goldwasser_ Gaza has been declared a “belligerent entity” and Israel can take whatever measure that are required to defend it’s citizens. If you ask why Gaza’s Hamas government has been declared belligerent you are dishonest. If we are to work for peace let’s dismantle Hamas for the sake of
@McFaul Read McFauls new book it’s s great read and will give you insight into Putin’s animus toward the author.
@bungarsargon @Ocasio2018 The “I support the two state solution “ has become “Jews are some of my best friends” refrain for permission to attack and delegitimize Israel.The other is I “am against BDS “ but......
@LaraFriedmanDC @bungarsargon @Ocasio2018 She displayed great ignorance during her interview parroting the anti Israel mantras of her echo chamber. I am hopeful because she indicated she need to learn more on the issue.
@rabbijilljacobs @bungarsargon @jdforward She couldn’t define what she meant by “occupation”.It was a knee jerk reaction that she parroted from those that propergate the antiIsrael narratives
@Hamburg_klein @Peace2Palestine Why is it that Israel only attacks woman children and arts and craft centers and  is stil considered a military power?
@PeterBeinart @IfNotNowOrg We are all aware of the suffering.The question is how we address the multi dimensional corruption and abuses of the Palestinsnusn Authority and https://t.co/3SoPDhTiSz is all too easy to blame Israel
@IfNotNowOrg @EmmaSaltzberg @birthright So start your own group Thete is no shortage of Foundations that support anAntiIsrael  narrative
@havivrettiggur There are so many foundations that contribute to the ant-Israel narrative .It’s seems it would bemore honest to solicit these foundations for help:Open Society Foundation, Ford Foundation, U N Auxiliaries, Nathan Cummings, the list goes on........
@bungarsargon If that’s your thought there are many wealthy organizations willing to pay for a trip that lends itself to the anti-Israel narrative:Open Society Foundation , Natan Cummings , Ford  Foundation,U N auxiliaries -they are countless
@bungarsargon Many people are involved with Birthright and are dedicated to bringing an understanding to Israel politically  and culturally.                                  To characterize those  exploiting this  wonderful group of people  as Modern Robin Hoods is wrong
@shimritmeir @ignis_fatum IDF spokesman are doing a fine job in explaining the situation.This graph is a great optic. Hamas has their distortion all over the place .Israel needs to find different ways to combat these lies.
@YousefMunayyer Got it the other way around
@cursedsalad @Peace2Palestine If England belongs to the English,so and so on,..than why wouldn’t it be called Arabia if it belonged to the Arabs.	Where did “Palestine “come from?What was that geographical area called before?
@aryehlou @JohnKerry @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @BtSIsrael This map is a fabrication to perpetuate the anti Israel  narrative .
@Ron_Skolnik I was appalled by the rank anti sematism in the debate .This bill has nothing to do with settlements .
@bungarsargon @DavidN1027 It is blind not to recognize these “boycott” campaigns for what they are.
@ynkutner @LTCPeterLerner Certainly a light we all can believe in
@rabbijilljacobs @netanyahu @NewIsraelFund There are mainstream political parties that oppose Netanya and the present government on many fronts , Fringe elements calling the parliamentary process anti-democratic is anti-democratic.
@truahrabbis @rabbijilljacobs @DNC @Likud_Party @JTAnews The Pro US-Israel alliance agenda is a bipartisan effort that the mainstream Jewish community has worked for and together since the time of Justice Brandies.
@_Goldwasser_ You mean the whole cabal?
@DanKurtzer Dubious presentation and more agenda driven to spin the anti Israel narrative
@cjwerleman That is transpiring in Syria,where foreign Shi’a fighters are slaughtering the Sunni Arab population
@AlanDersh @TheKevinAllison אמן צדק צדק תרדף
@aarondmiller2 I think you know what he means. The issue is an inflated and unrealistic demand by the Palestinians on the issue of refugees. If we are serious about the peace process let’s address it head on.
@rabbijilljacobs Many of these “human right “organizations are are more interested in scoring points against Israel in the campaign of delegitimization than to really address the real need of Palestinians.
@bungarsargon Isn’t civil society suppose to impact state power.That’s how most responsive governments work.The important issue is how we as individuals act to  increase justice. To tolerate or excuse injustice is   Just wrong
@_Goldwasser_ Good idea !Hamas wouldn’t need kites . They could employ all sorts of more effective tactics
@mishtal True but sad
@rabbijilljacobs
@jjz1600 @nikkihaley @USCIRF The source of Palestinian suffering  rest with Hamas and the Palestinian Authority If we focus on their reform a Palestinian constituency will emerge in support of Peace
@aarondmiller2 Sadly on point
@RokhlK It’s probably because your parents did  not send you to Rama that you  are too self absorbed and don’t have an appreciation
@bungarsargon No one is forcing these people to go! If they want they could cooordinate their own trip with Hamas
@bungarsargon Your paradigm is wrong
@bungarsargon @AllisonKSommer @Issaamro We should go to the Palestinian controlled areas as see how free speech is observed,gay rights are respected,woman are free,Christians need to flee, Jews are hated,........  let work on Justice for the Palesrinian people
@rabbijilljacobs Rav Kook’s ideas of tikun olam are inconsistent with the Protestant self -redemption  secular liberalism you profess.
@JeremyBenAmi @jstreetdotorg Those promoting peace will focus on meeting the challenges those promoting Israel bashing will focus on “Occupation”
@DanielleRaskin1 @BtSIsrael Great ! you  never had any interest in learning about Israel’s culture and challenges. The right thing to do is reimburse your host for wasting their time and money.
@bensilverstein We don’t yet know her full position on Israel  will be .Her “massacre “ description will only feed the frenzy of hate and will not side with those who are advocating for peace
@Beirutsi_hy @JSchanzer Then the only territory they will ever control will be on Mars. Let’s all work for peace
@truahrabbis @jstreetdotorg Today, we should be mobilizing in support of the Iranian people
@IfNotNowOrg @EmmaSaltzberg @birthright @TimesofIsrael So 5 people from your organization showed up at the airport. Wow! If two more would have showed up it would have been a complete organizational mobilization.
@DanielSeidemann How about the Olmert-Obama/Shapiro or Barak -Clinton Negotiations?   The success of any talks have more to do with the Palestinians than the composition of the Israeli team.
@AmbassadorRice Yeah, partner with Iran Syria and other henchmen  responsible for the death and displacement of countless  .I think you lost any moral stature  on  human rights issues
@IfNotNowOrg @birthright You had 5 people at JFK.
@RichardHaass Except JCPOA
@DanielSeidemann If you were serious about safeguarding Christian rights in the Middle East you would be screaming about their massacre in Syria and Iraq or their flight from the Palestinian controlled territories.
@rabbijilljacobs @ngomonitor That these NGOs are largely finicially supported by non-Jews with dubious intent and Adelson present A right wing perspective are all things most Israelis understand.
@DanielBShapiro Silly talk , until the Palestinians create a responsive governing entity based on popular support all is pie in the sky
@truahrabbis @rabbijilljacobs @OUAdvocacy Many of us support the same issues on immigration but not the gratuitous attack on the OU
@rabbijilljacobs @OUAdvocacy @truahrabbis One can disagree with OU but your campaign is full of sinat Chinam
@MariamBarghouti We need to support the Palestinians in protest against their oppressive and kleptocratic governing authorities.Until these authorities stop abusing there own constituents injustices and violence will continue
@YousefMunayyer This has nothing to do with Israel but everything to do The Islamist terrorist against the secular terrorist.
@Pale_0ntologist @IfNotNowOrg Talk about false choices.....
@JimmyTaber As a parent of Three Ramah campers I am very disappointed that Ramah has people on staff  affiliated with this group. We will need to reassess if our youngest child can be part of this movement
@jstreetdotorg @RepJayapal Let’s focusing on reforming or removing The kleptocratic and hate filled governing authorities of the Palestians.This is the only way a two state solution can happen
@RVilkomerson @Mondoweiss @hebh_jamal If the students ofBeacon school were educated correctly they would stand against the hate filled  and corrupt Governing bodies of the Palestinians .
@OmarSShakir @hrw Ooo, suspense ...... whatever  will be their findings?
@IfNotNowOrg @NationalRamah We are vey thankful that Ramah has taken the responsible decision . Any member of If not Now  Org should be ineligible as serving as staff at Ramah.
@ilangoldenberg Moot point , Khameni would never meet  with the leader of the great Satan even after President Obama’s gave away the kitchen cabinet
@McFaul @DanielBShapiro The fact remains that Iran never gave up their nuclear weapons even with an agreement of sorts that never required them to do so big diffemce
@Beirutsi_hy @JSchanzer @WSJ @FDD @NicoleSalter112 “These rabid Jews” , could yo u clarify which  rabid Jews you are referring to ? Those that go to synagogue?
@jstreetdotorg @latimes I guessJ Street advocates for anti-Semitic speech only when it is directed against Israel.That’s consistent with the Pro -Israel Pro peace mantra.
@IfNotNowOrg Between the two extremist groups JDL or If Not Now , the latter is the most offensive.
@DanielBShapiro Both Obama’s and Trump’s tantrums were ugly incidents.
@bungarsargon Many Jews have accepted and adopted Secular Liberalism ( the prevailing religion in the West)as their new religion. It has Little to do with God,The Jewish people or Judaism.
@IfNotNowOrg We need to focus on the evil intention ofHamas which is predicated on death and hate.
@huwaidaarraf @Mondoweiss @SenSanders However one parses it . Hamas is an oppressive regime that abuses it’s people.
@rabbijilljacobs Protesting “human rights violation” ?! The  Palestinians are rioting in favor of destroying Israel and slaughtering Jews , if we are to believe the signs and chants. You can’t create your own facts
@_Goldwasser_ The Palestinian want the destruction of Israel and behave  with hate and violence . The Israelis celebrate life  and freedom with joy. The distinction is not only in the way each group celebrates but their respective goals
@bungarsargon It is tragic. Was she just acting as a medic? She had stated she was there as A “human shield “. We need to call for the end of Hamas and for peace and these tragedies can end
@rabbijilljacobs I think different people ask for help in different ways.
@Wonko_the_sane_ No matter how absurd any assertion anybody makes we need to accept it .....huh!?
@bungarsargon @lsarsour @ShaunKing However you parse it she is an Anti Semite and We need to speak loudly and forcefully against it as we would about any bigot or homophob
@rabbijilljacobs Who is trying to make Gaza disappear? It’s more like forces in Gazas are aiming for Israel to disappear.
@rogerwaters @richiefreddy It  is a mournful day marking the attack of Arab countries on the nascent Jewish state. Israel lost 1% of it’s Jewish population defending itself from that onslaught. How many more people need to die before the Palestinian community will accept Israel?
@rabbijilljacobs It would be better to figure out how to stop the various Arab groups from attacking Israel than pontificating .
@halaljew I don’t agree with the analysis but have you ever heard of Tibet?
@communitydialog Any investigation and charges need to start and end with Hamas
@jvplive Yeah that’s exactly how the The Israeli court ruled verbatim. This is another sick blood libel
@ahmedjnena2 @Peace2Palestine Maybe Hamas will stop investing in tunnels and devising ways to attack Israeland invest in infustructure to help their people
@YousefMunayyer Iran is responsible for hundreds of thousand being killed in Iraq Syria Yemen and elsewhere a well as the displacement of millions
@skjask Water it is the sign of life and can extinguish fire
@Remroum @richiefreddy Hamas governs in Gaza and The Palestinian Authority governs thevPalesrinians in the disputed territories.That they misgovern and abuse their constituents is the real outrage
@jvplive And then drank their blood too. As the blood libels  continue  in the 21st century
@jstreetu @jstreetdotorg @keithellison We need to focus on Hamas’s abuses.The blockade is a response to their dedication to destroying Israel and support of Islamism.
@RN_Costello We all stand with the Iranian people against the Mullucracy-responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of thousand in Syria,Iraq,and Yemen. Including innocent Palestinians in Yarmouk just this past month
@stephenWalt @Beirutsi_hy It still would have been better than a gateway to nuclear weapons and bundles of cash to wreck havoc
@jvplive @jdforward Will this include the the Palestinians slaughtered  in Yarmouk or is it only important to mention if Palestinians are killed by Israelis in the name of self defense
@YousefMunayyer @Steven_Strauss @The_NewArab Whatever the spin doctors try to manufacture all people of peace are happy that the assault on Israel was quashed.The killing rests with Hamas
RT @omriceren: Criticism about Iran from Team Obama would be more credible if they hadn't sealed agreement legalizing industrial-size Iran…
@djrothkopf It is not an issue of ratio . The question is how many Palestinians is Hamas willing to jeporduze to achieve their aims?
@BrunoTertrais @NarangVipin Or Libiya
@djrothkopf Any Israeli crossing the Gaza border knows he is in mortal danger .Your point is not well taken
@rabbijilljacobs @JGreenblattADL @wapo You lose legitimacy as a arbiter of any-Semitism when you tolerate BDS in your ranks
@RavMABAY And those in our community that tolerate these views need to be called out for their immoral position like The group  called T’ruah
@YousefMunayyer If your not speaking to Hamas’s abuse of both Palestinians and Jews -your voice will continue to lose legitimacy
@sarahleah1 Stop calling it a “protest”.This was an attack by Hamas with intent to kill and destroy. Thankfully it was quashed.
@MtthewRubiin You are creating a narrative that isn’t true.These Hamas operatives are not fighting for freedom but to destroy and kill
@DanielPipes @josh_hammer His books line my bookcases . His spirit lives on. I am sorry for your loss
@DanielSeidemann Hamas apologists
@AdyBarkan @IfNotNowOrg Charade is over !We know at least 50 of those killed were Hamas terrorist. We need to work against Hamas and for a two state solution.
@MikeOmerMan @richiefreddy The charade is over We know that at least 50 of those shot were active zHamad terrorist
@jjz1600 @Mondoweiss @FAIRmediawatch @NomikiKonst @adamjohnsonNYC @ShaunKing The real problem is to not call out Palestinian leadership which has genocidal intent no matter how much the Palestinian population suffers
@YousefMunayyer @washingtonpost It’s high time that the likes of Hamas to be called on for their abuse of power and their own people
@ianbremmer More like the present Palestinian leadership
@YousefMunayyer The Palestinians can begin to be free once they escape Hamas
@Partisangirl If I called you  an Anti Semite you would probably wear it as a badge of honor
@jjz1600 The legislation was supported by an overwhelming bipartisan vote .
@bungarsargon I feel a rage against Hamas and their enablers
@PeterBeinart Hamas is not attacking Israel because Israeli haven’t employed the best tactics .They are attacking Israel because they want to destroy it.
@bungarsargon Or you can create your own narrative in the name of the disenfranchised
@RepKClark @jstreetdotorg We need to facilitate a better future for the Palestinians. That starts with the removal of Hamas  as a governing force.
@Wonko_the_sane_ @RutiRegan Our focus has to be the elimination ofHamas. They have abused their people far too long
@ZivGuy The Hamas attack is not because of the embassy
@MairavZ They are not attacking because of the Embassy
@MariamBarghouti Hamas deflects it abuse of it’S own population to build a culture of hate and grievances
@CarolineGlick אמן
@ForeignAffairs “ largely nonviolent” is a-confusing term   to the point of  being inaccurate.
@Beirutsi_hy @JGreenblattADL We should work for Arab liberation where it’s most needed; Syria, Yemen Iraq,Palestinian territories, Egypt  and all Arab governments that so oppress their people
@rabbijilljacobs If only the Palestinians limited their opposition to Jewish sovereignty to Jerusalem instead of all of Israel.....
@TheRaDR This is not informed :states  have withdrawn from agreements  when the signing authority no longer sees it in it’s interest. That includes the previous administration . The process in achieving this agreement  allowed hundreds of thousand to die in Syria!
@AManInTheSun @Beirutsi_hy That’s why Nasser closed the Straits of Tiran, Expelled the U.N. troops positioned in the Sinai,and deployed  new troops previously participating in the Yemen Civil  war.
@rabbijilljacobs @realDonaldTrump @netanyahu Why would you assume Netanyahu ‘s motives are nefarious and President Obama’s wasn’t? My guess both are workings for the perceived intrest of their respective countries. Let’s stop the partisanship !
@brhodes You already created the problem .The  question is it  worse or better?
@bungarsargon @CarlyPildis @TamikaDMallory Instead of trying to separate “Israel and Jews” You should understand that they are part and parcel in their anti Semitic  intent
@DanielBShapiro The Obama accomplished aim was to eliminate a military option - not to delay or accelerate Iranian nuclear ambitions
@MairavZ Any alternative to the NYT should be considered  a relief to the anti Israel diatribes
@YousefMunayyer No doubt we need a Palestinian leadership that can come to the negotiating table and talk peace instead of hate
@YousefMunayyer Any discussion of refugees need to include the Jewish refugees of  Arab lands.....or maybes you think they are not worthy
@YousefMunayyer Oh and the anti Semitic Islamist in Gaza are better than Abbas......
@ZacharySchaffer Firstly,  get past your banalities . There is suffering in all parts of the world and as caring people of the human race we should aim to address it. We can not address these injustices without context
@ZacharySchaffer You need to understand the context of suffering to address it . Otherwise it just s self-righteous platitude
@ZacharySchaffer Personal stories are heart wrenching but once the Palestinian leadership shows more care for it’s people than devising different means to destroy Israel - the real suffering will end
@AmbassadorRice The blame for the whole Iranian debacle rest with those in the Obama administration that focused on messaging rather that limiting Iranian hegemony
@aarondmiller2 @djrothkopf The only difference with Rothkopf and Ball in regards to Israel is their lineage
@RVilkomerson @SenSchumer SenSchumer is on the side of Justice. Will you join him?
@giligetz @jstreetu Did anyone drop by the Iranian embassy or  speak to the Palestinian delegation?
@rabbijilljacobs @ADL_National It is wrong not to call out groups or people that are claiming that Israel is involved with  police suppression of black and brown people -it’s called a “blood libel” your weak defense of the premier Jewish civil rights organization will not deflect the real issue
@sandraylk @jvplive @Durm2Palestine Birds of a feather flock togetherness
@SlaughterAM What was your strategy when you were at the helm? How many people were killed or made refugees? A little contrition is in order here
@SamanthaJPower That’s  so insightful
@ZacharySchaffer And its ant-Semitic too.
@jstreetdotorg @samermakh We need to help guide  Palestinian leadership for more honest and responsive government.
@nytimesworld I am assuming the “non” in nonviolent is typo too
@clavedements @SenFeinstein Continue to read
@clavedements @SenFeinstein The last deal was with Olmert and Abbas which was on the table and Abbas rejected it
@clavedements @SenFeinstein You just said the Hamas is not involved and know you don’t see acts of violence. Creating alternative facts
@clavedements @SenFeinstein At Camp David with Clinton,Barak offered 96% with land transfer rejected by Arafat
@clavedements @SenFeinstein In the 1967war the Arab countries met in Khartoum with the three”nos
@clavedements @SenFeinstein in 1948  ,the U N partionef  for two states. Arab countries invaded The new state of Israel and Arab countries absorbed the other territories
@clavedements @SenFeinstein “Peaceful protestors “ what are you watching”
H.
@clavedements @SenFeinstein Yes,  Previous Israeli governments have offeredland transfers Where future borders were to be negotiated between the parties. One Israeli government even offered the Palestine’s like 97% of the West Bank and Half of Jerusalem only to be rejected. Where have you been!?
@clavedements @SenFeinstein The solution is there for anyone that preaches peace  . A two state solution. Hamas is a mudeerous group that advocate and works for the end of theJewish people in Israel.
@SenFeinstein This violence did not just erupt. Its another means in which a terrorist entity devises different means to attack the Jewish state. Shame on you Senator for equivocating  between the victim ( which are both the Israelis and the Palestinians) at the hand of Hamas
@IfNotNowOrg @SenFeinstein Senator Feinstein is a fine public servant . It’s a shame  her office is being confronted by hooliganism
@jstreetdotorg There is a lot of misinformation out there about what’s transpiring on the border with Gaza. It  would well be worth the time to explain to our public officials  about the terrorist regime inn Gaza and the culture of hate
@IfNotNowOrg @SenFeinstein Let’s hope the Senator will be able to influence the terrorist regime in Gaza to stop oppressing their people and perpetuating hate
@jvplive @SenGillibrand It would be better to tell the truth and call on the terrorist regime in Gaza to stop oppressing their people and using their voices for hate!
@rabbijilljacobs @truahrabbis We need to call  on Hamas to stop the systemic oppression  of it’s people and breeding of hate.	This false call on Israel is another distortion for your own personal sense of righteousness( the avoda zora    of the day)
@AllisonKSommer Where was your observation earlier: “Yemen Slaughter,Syrian killings, Turkish bombing ofKurds, extra -judicial killings in Egypt..... and the international arena is focused on Israel and Gaza.	Your “observation “at best distorted. An apology not an explanation is in order.
@AllisonKSommer What a sick distortion! As if Israel and the Syrian regime are comparable.

@benabyad Who is providing these statistics? Hamas, Hezbollah or the alt-right fascist?
@YonahLieberman Yes, we need to organize against Hamas as they use  their own people in the worst way.
@BettyMcCollum04 Yes,the first thing we need to do is find more responsible leadership in the Palestinian community. I hope the Congressman will support legislation that cuts aid that goes directly to terrorist for killing Jews and find ways to remove from power the racist ant-Semitic Hamas
@robinlustig Yes, this is a perfect opportunity to speak out on Hamas and their anti Semitic partners .Lets all speak out against racism and oppression wherever it appears
@SenSanders Bernie creates his own narrative to conform to his own false preconceived notions
@jjz1600 @Mondoweiss Will she tell the Palestinian leadership to stop using their children and engage honestly peacefully
@jpodhoretz Slow news day?
@NoMorles @Blackhawk_Up Chico was16
@mirandrist Richard spencer and you are on the same page  with Israel
@jpodhoretz Downtown Chicago too
@jstreetdotorg @nytimes You forgot to mention Palestinians. If we are able to incentivize the Palestinians to be serious -I think all can fall into place but first the Palestinian leadership  must stop their belligerent language and work on proper governance of their own constituents
@jstreetdotorg @nytimes Who r we kidding -the Palestinian leadership is not interested in peace or a two state solution Let’s work together to deter the Iranians and try to create the circumstances that the Palestinians will pursue peace
@NatashaRoth01 Why do you think there is an uptick in security concerns?

@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The Misguided Iran Deal does not make us safe .
@jdudemill @ianbremmer “Willfully”
@TVietor08 @hughhewitt @BretStephensNYT Destabilizing for those that advocate and participate it murder and mayhem
@brhodes Coming from the propagato-and-chief .
@jkirchick But more often than not anti semitism is expressed inanti-Zionism and to deny this is to be willfully ignorant
@HezbollahWatch @haivri Your idea of “non nominal” means  anyone  not a Jew  hating Islamist
@ngomonitor @djrothkopf Incredible that some once considered you a serious  person. Your comments are sheer demagoguery. Welcome to the Trump era.
@jpodhoretz Or both r unqualfied
@EmmanuelNahshon @IsraelMFA @Israel I would guess the proper salutation today “ Yom Tov”.
@Mivasair @jvplive The Palestinian voted last and supported Hamas an anti Semitic  Islamist  organization and if we want to help the Palestinians we need to encourage democratic instutions within their community
@MairavZ The bar is not against those groups but against bigotry and antsemimitsm
@Mivasair @jvplive Do you mean the democratically elected government in Israel?!

@aarondmiller2 The question is how to get the Palestinian Arabs integrated within their host countries-Aid should be structured in this fashion. I only wish that would be the administrations intentions
@djrothkopf Unfortunately , a revolting thought but not unimaginable.
@jvplive Where are the voices for the real oppressed woman of Iran
@HosseinNazari12 Let’s hold Cyrus responsible for  complicity in stealing the land . Let’s just rid ourselves of the Mullahacrocy that is so responsible for the oppression of the Iranian people and murder and displacement of so many. LONG LIVE FREEDOM!!
@JohnBrennan Please sto deflecting and own up to your failed policies that have come home to roost
@Shqazwini Let’s condemn the oppression in Yemen and in Iran.	Let’s also been mindful that the government in Tehran has blood on it’s hand in both places
@HosseinNazari12 Israel,the Jewish state, and Iran,the Persian state ,have an ancient history together
@HosseinNazari12 I think it is the hope and prayer of  American and Israelis that their historical friendship dating back to Cyrus will return
@ElliottRHams @mdubowitz @DanielBShapiro We always need to be respectful with our discussion but Ambassador Shapiro represents an administration that has contributed to the death and mayhem that consumes today’s middleast.This needs to be part of the discussion or it us isn’t an honest discussion

@LOULOUGUINNESS @MaxBlumenthal Please  don’t confuse the Iranian people with Mullah thugs
@MaxBlumenthal Certainly better than people like you  who would supply the current repressive Mullahocracy  with billions of dollars to slaughter millions in SYria, Yemen and than call it peace
@DanielBShapiro The goal of the deal was to stymie those voices supporting a preemptive strike against the Nazi like regime in Iran. In that effort , the administration largely removed years of sanctions and delivered billion of dollars in the name of peace.  FOR SHAME
RT @EliLake: Iran's economy is in tatters because Iran’s leaders are thieves and fanatics. Don’t believe anyone who tells you it’s because…

@debhodges1413 @SusanGroff1 @skwkim007 @MaxBoot @ForeignPolicy Kennedy wouldn’t have been able to pass it even if he earnestly tried. LBJ  was the one who could and did have it pass.

@MaxBoot Already put my order in eagerly awaiting it’s arrival
@yarivop באמת?! מוגבל במחחשבה
@MisandryIsFake @heapsybeapsy @WolfieMatty @BradSherman If the Palestinians would build an entity committed to peace instead of antisemitism,misogyny, homophobia , and hate  there would be peace
@brhodes You should be ashamed for your part in the episode
@JamalDajani @jvplive A  negative reflection the U N .A positive reflection on the USA
@MairavZ I think Hamas  decided to make an example and murdered  the deceased.As long as  Hamas  and ISIL are around death and mayhem will prevail
@UNRWA @USCGJerusalem @PKraehenbuehl The Israelis have found  a way to integrate the Jewish refugees from that war . My hope is that UNRWA will find a way to integrate the Arab refugees in their host countries from that distant war.
@brhodes As someone who manufactures narratives....I would adviseyou not to throw  around Orwellian epithets .
@brhodes The real crisis to discuss is IRan’s destabilizing actions throughout the Middle East.	Maybe a pathway to an atomic bomb and billions of dollars to the antisemitic,anti gay, hateful  mullah regime will help?
@brhodes Stop it already! What crisis are you talking about?!
@heapsybeapsy @WolfieMatty @BradSherman What peace process!?	Maybe this can incentivize the Palestinians to begin a real process earnestly.
