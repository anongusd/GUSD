@EuropeElects Time to dump @jeremycorbyn. His weakness on Brexit is destroying Labour.
@patrickhealynyt just here for the ratio https://t.co/LgEgL05qbh
Interesting note from that @EmersonPolling Iowa poll: "70% of supporters of Joe Biden believe being over 65, 70 or 75 years old is too old to run for president." Another sign that Biden's support is likely to decline as we get closer to the Caucus.
@GMA @KamalaHarris She's _ _ _ _ _ _ _
@small1ldy1 @JohnJHarwood Well then how about the results in November, when the GOP was massacred by 10 million votes and 8.6 % points?
Think on the bright side people. Maybe Gabbard running for president will get her out of Congress!
@tonyposnanski CC: @SeanMcElwee
@LarrySabato As a Californian, he was a TERRIFIC governor. Maybe not as liberal as many would have liked, but he was highly competent and helped our state economy boom. Tough shoes to fill for Newsom.

@American__Voter A classic case of how identity != beliefs.
George H.W. Bush. The best Republican President since Eisenhower and a great man too. Rest in peace.
@mwil_cl @NateSilver538 Most likely 6 if current trends continue. Down to 8 out of 53.
@MNGG33G7LP @FrankLuntz @GOP @realDonaldTrump So do you think the Massachusetts Senate election was rigged as well because Charlie Baker won the gubernatorial race in a massive landslide? Spreading insane conspiracy theories only makes you look less credible.
@trtx84 @Redistrict Correct.
@donal_78 @jbarro True, but for the statewide vote for the house, Republicans only won by 3-4%. That's a pretty significant shift from before and much closer to the Beto #
@baseballot In b4 dropping out after 2% in the Iowa caucus
RT @Garrett_Archer: The Senate race has a new leader.
@Nate_Cohn Nice work you guys.
Beto, in a midterm, got more votes than Hillary Clinton got in 2016. Wow.
@smelllikesugar @baseballot No joke. I'm sure we'll discuss this in great depth in the coming days/weeks.
@RalstonReports @jacobfhsmith ü§î
Looks like @RosenforNevada is going to win. Woohoo!
@baseballot We saw so many Republican districts revert back to partisanship despite solid Dem recruits there. Some places may be too tribal for even Jesus Christ to win these days.
It's amazing how with the great trouble red state Dems have had tonight, Beto got Texas within 3 % points. He better not stay out of politics for long, he has an incredible way of connecting with the voters.
@LarrySabato Hats off to you folks at the Crystal Ball. We'll see what happens in NV, AZ, and MT, but only Florida so far has been off. Well done again.
@decunningham2 @joncprevo Of course, anything can happen. Politics doesn't always make sense.
@decunningham2 @joncprevo I disagree actually. Maybe if the Senate is close that happens, but GOP has no need to lob incentives at him (committees etc) with the way it is now. Besides, I don't think he'll be running for reelection anymore.
No more Schumer. Yes Pelosi.
@LPNational @PopulismUpdates

@jacobfhsmith @FiveThirtyEight @surveyusa @maristpoll @foxnewspoll Interesting as Cook and the Crystal ball had both last week mentioned things getting worse for Dems in Indiana (and Missouri). Bounce back?
@tgconsolidation @Politics_Polls @DixieStrategies @KUTV2News This is also the least Republican district though, so I'm sure he's up by more statewide.
@c_scheibenreif @Nate_Cohn That's not on the Dems. @Nate_McMurray is running a good campaign. That's on voters who put party over country. So much for "law and order"!
@PipsFunFacts @Redistrict @CookPolitical I can only remember 1 in recent years - 2008 New Orleans for Dems. The incumbent had been under indictment so I'm sure that explains why they lost.
@maggieNYT Yup, and the moon is made out of cheese and I won the powerball.
@ArtfulButler tx-13 because why the hell not
@NoahHonickman @TeekeeMon @Politics_Polls @surveyusa @MyNews13 @BN9 It was a Scott internal, so that's why they probably didn't post it.
@MorninGovnaa @ForecasterEnten Summary from what I can tell: If Hyde-Smith makes the runoff, Republicans win easy. If McDaniel does, then Espy has at least a toss up chance of winning. There hasn't been a poll in ages so it's hard to tell what's going on in the round one. FWIW Cook has it at "Lean Republican".
@atlsportscholar @politicsluo Especially for Missouri Senate this year. Average is almost entirely Republican affiliated polls. Yikes.
@ForecasterEnten Man, I remember the results coming in front Indiana and Kentucky and going, ‚Äúman, those counties have shifted big time. Uh-oh.‚Äù Unbelievable.
@PoliticalAtlas @LarrySabato @jcbjackson @kkondik @CliffAYoung Some interesting ones here. Indiana and Alabama, are definitely surprising!
@ImDavidDunn @sahilkapur So what would you suggest she do in a state Trump won by 36 % points?
@ForecasterEnten Interestingly, I heard it mentioned recently that  Cramer's team had him up in the "high single digits" in polls. That they are even running ahead of the Republican internals in this poll makes me suspicious... Heitkamp is an underdog, but not by nearly that much!
@Politics_Polls @Right_Strategy Mary's approval rating is fallin!
@alexburnsNYT Doug Jones is a fine man and a fine Senator. Even if he loses in 2020, he will have done more good for Alabama in 3 years than Jeff Sessions did in his decades.
@JakobDWebster @LikeIGive_Adam @joncprevo @Mark55____ I thought it was Heidi convinced Joe to run again. But I could be mistaken as well. News is crazy these days.
@VinceValence @renonemontanez @ForecasterEnten Also, Nelson is up against a stronger opponent (self fundraising, better approval). In the end, I think Gillum helps him a little and they both win.
@American__Voter Don't mind me. Just here for the ratio.
@chriskrolak @foxnewspoll @FoxNews Fox polling has always been fairly accurate and nonbiased. 538 poll rating gives them an A-. They are conducted by a different group than the news side of fox which is biased towards conservative viewpoints.
@joncprevo What do they know in Texas that we don't? Polling suggests this is probably tilt/lean Republican. Betomania is just too strong I guess!
@TheAtomicSultan @CookPolitical Honestly, I get where you are coming from, Heitkamp is the underdog. I think there is just not enough polling out there to call that yet, though I suspect they may move it before election day unless something changes.
@dcinsb @NateSilver538 CA-39 for sure. Republicans have a strong candidate in Clinton won open district. Another one is CA-21 (also Clinton won) but that is not the fault of the Dem but more the incumbent being popular in an extremely low turnout district.
@NateSilver538 Regardless, he seems like a much better candidate than WENDY DAVIS. It's been so interesting to watch #TXSen because of his appeal and Cruz's, well, Cruzness.
@Claryse2 @fineout @FLGovScott @SenBillNelson @AndrewGillum I think that may be part of it. I must admit I did not expect @AndrewGillum to be polling so strongly, but it is awesome he is and is probably inspiring more young people and African Americans to vote Democratic. Go @AndrewGillum @SenBillNelson!
@numanmyname @amyewalter @kkondik Yes, but in Nevada the Latinos are underestimated much more than WWC. In 2016 some states like Ohio had higher WWC turnout and more for Trump, causing him to outperform polls, while Nevada had higher Latino tunout, causing HRC to outperform there.
Man... the gender gap in the #IA01 poll so far (caution: still low sample size) is massive. Dems winning women by 34 and losing men by 10. 44 point gap!
@DavefromTO @ActorAaronBooth Think about Lincoln Chaffee. Liberal-ish Republican (he even joined the Dems and ran for Pres in 2016), very popular in Rhode Island. 60% approval on election day 2006- and he lost. That's what happens when you have an unpopular president in your party in a midterm!
@ActorAaronBooth @GravisMarketing @RosenforNevada @DeanHeller @SteveSisolak @AdamLaxalt @KateMarshallNV @RobersonForNV @NelsonAraujoNV @SOSCegavske Senate race looks exactly as we would expect, but holy cow! That governor's race, wow.
@ibdsh @gelliottmorris Polls have actually been fairly decent there. Rhode Island seems the most likely Dem seat to flip with a moderate Republican, but Dems are still favorites there.
RT @AngelaBelcamino: Every man &amp; woman on Twitter should tweet this today: 		I stand in solidarity with 	Christine Blasey Ford.
@Politics_Polls @SienaResearch @UpshotNYT I'm interested to see how the result changes with ranked choice voting.
People who know more about this sort of thing, around what sort of margain would @BetoORourke need in TX-07 to be competitive statewide? Very early on he seems to be running narrowly ahead of @Lizzie4Congress? #TX07
Paul Manafort too? Man, it seems like everyone's flipping out here! Donald in disarray!
@KenHamilton1955 @CookPolitical @mmurraypolitics Unfortunately no, the unpopular governor and the former Senator and Democrat were both too selfish to do what's best for Alaska and stayed in the race. Polls have them splitting the vote and allowing an easy victory for Republicans. Too bad.
That NYT/Siena poll of CO-06... wow. I figured Coffman would be down because @JasonCrowCO6 is a great candidate, but it's double digits. That district is likely democrat.
@Brian_Chovanec @ForecasterEnten Well, that really depends on your POV, but Nixon certainly argued that Cuomo wasn't strong enough on the IDC. At any rate, it's nice to see them go down.
@Brian_Chovanec @ForecasterEnten Klien, the incumbent, led a group of turncoat Democrats who caucused with the Republican party for many years in the state senate. This would be a clear stand against that.
@PoliticalKiwi That's the crazy thing about wave years, people seen as "strong" incumbents (Blanche Lincoln, Pryor, and soon Coffman and Comstock) get taken under just like anyone else. Pissed off voters are difficult to win back.
@JaimeBintheICT @Nate_Cohn Unfortunately, that is illegal. Otherwise they would probably do that.
@StephenRLandfi2 @POLITICO_Steve @BretBaier Think of it like this: Republicans have around a 2 in 3 chance of winning the Senate. More details here: https://t.co/ILmAWkoEGM
@DouglasSloane @NateSilver538 Well, it is virtually certain that they are taking the Senate if they take the House. It probably is so improbable that it is a less than 1% chance so it doesn't change the percentage chance.
@MonmouthPoll @Marty_Nothstein @wildforcongress Predictions? I'm guessing Wild +8
@michaelsfarr @NateSilver538 Exactly. While the House has races that we won by Obama or won by Clinton and now held by Republicans, the Senate has races in solid red Trump states.
@mlow29 @LiberalVirginia @geoffreyvs @kkondik And Sinema has one of the most moderate records of anyone in the House.
@NJTFan @blumichigan @Politics_Polls @JohnJamesMI Well, the clock's ticking. Under two months to go and he is down 23? Doesn't look like it's happening.
@TonyYacowar @FiveThirtyEight Sometime this week, apparently. If I had to guess, Wednesday morning (then all Senate primaries will be done)
@advocatingdevi1 @VoteBlueNov6 @wvjoe911 @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @SecNielsen @fema @FEMA_Brock @VP Piss off Putin!
@kkondik Yea, Leaning R is a good rating on this one. Would need a bit of a surprise/even further improvement in national environment for Dems.
@DrewSutton20 @Nate_Cohn And the Trump approval there in the mid to low 30s, yikes. Would not want to be Rep. Paulsen.
@politicsluo I mean, Booker isn't terrible. Not my first choice by any means, but I'd vote for him in the general. But if somehow we nominate an Avenatti... ugh
@Politics_Polls Holy crap. This makes Austin Peterson's batshit internal look like the gold standard of polling. Impressive!
@Politics_Polls @ProbolskyRsrch https://t.co/CH5BAliPQR
@Henson54UK @Nate_Cohn CA48 is one that Democrats *probably* need to win but still have a very feasible path to the majority without it. Meanwhile, if Dems are winning Il-6 and 12, they probably have already won 30 to 40 seats.
@NateSilver538 Very curious to see the probability for a #TnSen flip by @PhilBredesen. Looking forward to your model!
@ChazNuttycombe Man, I was reading the center for politics this morning where they said Heidi was down in private polls on both sides. I really hope she can pull it off just like 2012
@DrewSutton20 @kkondik I haven't seen any. Might be some internals they have seen that we haven't and/or simply adjusting for the partisan lean of the district.
@DrewSutton20 @kkondik Probably because Cartwright is representing a lot of new people who aren't as in touch with his brand. It was a pro-Trump district. He still is a strong, popular incumbent so he can pull it of in November.
@davidmackau @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski Kavanaugh will NOT protect Roe v Wade if he is appointed. If you vote for him, you are going against everything you claim to stand for and we WILL vote you out!
@k13xd Well, the GOP is all but certain to win now. No idea why he or Walker would not withdraw for the sake of the state.
@ArtfulButler https://t.co/P0JpJoFNq5
@ArtfulButler All aboard the Brown/Harris bandwagon
I don't know why anyone would want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed without knowing everything there is to know concerning documents. We deserve to know what is being hidden by Mitch McConnell et al. If it isn't shown, Dems have the right to assume the worst and vote NO!
@kkondik F to Rothfus's political career
@kkondik Man, idk if Begich or Walker is in 2nd, Begich never should've entered to keep a Democratic ally in office and run in 2020 against Sullivan. UGH
@CuddleTalk @Politics_Polls Amazing. Every word of what you just said is wrong.
@ActorAaronBooth @GravisMarketing @NedLamont @bobforgovernor @ChrisMurphyCT @MattCoreyCT Not a tossup.
@MarcusMc1990 @brianros1 @MarkP21 He probably says because Graham led by 4 in recent poll v Desantis while Gillum trailed by 3. Hope @AndrewGillum can pull it off!

@javalinarage @ChazNuttycombe Not too competitive. There is an outside shot of an upset in #AzGov but not as close as the others mentioned.

@ActorAaronBooth @GravisMarketing @stabenow @JohnJamesMI @gretchenwhitmer @SchuetteOnDuty #MiGov is lean Blue.
@gaslucas @NateSilver538 It was always around those odds. Democrats being favored, but not overwhelmingly. Pundits being pundits and the media having a problem conveying statistics would make you think otherwise. Nothing has changed substantially.
@politicsluo Abolish the draft and ratify the Equal Rights Amendment!!!
@cmberman @walterowensgrpa @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/4ilWTuD1yO
@jiminyjobbers55 @politicsluo Yea, we need to get rid of the electoral college and first-past-the-post voting as well. That should be the goal of the next Dem trifecta instead of court packing IMO.
@GregCfollows @HillaryzMyHmgrl @AsteadWesley @LiberalismRules Instead, they can meet with her in private or she can come to their communities (sans media). I like AOC and am thrilled to have young, progressive voices join Congress, but I have to disagree with her on this. I hope you can understand my perspective better.Have a lovely day.2/2
@GregCfollows @HillaryzMyHmgrl @AsteadWesley @LiberalismRules I totally agree that we need politicians to be looking for the more vulnerable members of our society and seeking their input. But a public forum is not that place; instead, that is a place where the public can see their congresswomen taking questions. 1/2
@jiminyjobbers55 @politicsluo Elections have consequences. I hate to say it, but it's true- we didn't get the votes in 2016, so we have to suffer for a long time to come. The opposite is stacking the courts and then having Republicans do the same next time they get power. It's bad for democracy.
@GregCfollows @HillaryzMyHmgrl @AsteadWesley @LiberalismRules Well then why don‚Äôt they meet with her in private? It‚Äôs a public event, so the entire public should be allowed access through the media. We don‚Äôt have to stoop to the level of Trump.
Looking at the @FiveThirtyEight model, and I think it is a great idea that they go with odds first, probability second. That makes it much easier for people to understand that upsets do happen. Great work as always!
@Politics_Polls @GBAStrategies @GSG Now if only we could find this Gene Eric fellow...
@PoliticalKiwi True, but I think having Walz on the top of the ticket will boost Dems in #MN01. But both are very similar in levels of competitiveness.
@jrm3417 @JoinRocky All of them. 100 Rockys in the Senate!
@Jinxy_Minxy @hannahnahz @Politics_Polls @ssrs_research @CNN RCP does not adjust polls AFAIK, causing a slight difference in numbers between the two sites.
@hannahnahz @Jinxy_Minxy @Politics_Polls @ssrs_research @CNN 538 looks at historical biases for the pollsters and shifts to cancel that bias out. Pollsters like Rassmussen with a Republican bias get shifted left, while polls like Quinnipiac with a Democratic biases get shifted right.
@John_M_Vidal @jennifereduffy @GovJeffColyer @TimPawlenty You are right, they are MAGA candidates. The problem is, not everyone wants a die hard Trumper. Hence them being weaker candidates.
@RealESonneborn Good job Ethan, you kicked ass! Now go be a kid and have some fun!
@bk4uk @ForecasterEnten Coyler just conceded.
@gelliottmorris RIGGED! #rockymentum is real. Fake news!
@po8crg @NateSilver538 Well, there is a 14 year old running for governor of Vermont @RealESonneborn. That generation is already getting out there!
@PeopleHogg @alexobe11 @Politics_Polls @GravisMarketing Will do. Have a wonderful day!
@PeopleHogg @Politics_Polls @GravisMarketing Ok. It's one poll, and primary turnout doesn't mean that much. Case in point: Wyoming 2002 gubernatorial election. Republicans outvoted Dems by nearly 3:1 in the solid red state, but Democrats won the election.
@murshedz @SenateDems @ThePlumLineGS @JuddLegum @brianbeutler @aldotcom I mean, what is he supposed to do? Dems have no power to stop the nomination if all Republicans vote yes.
@PeopleHogg @Politics_Polls @GravisMarketing Suffice to say, it is a little strange to see an entire account devoted to rallying against... a teenager.
@TravisBShaw17 @notcapnamerica Get aboard the Brown/Harris bandwagon! Both are progressive and Brown is super popular in Ohio and Harris is an awesome candidate herself!
@SenhorRaposa But, by all means, please do ‚Äúvote your conscience‚Äù and primary RINO Scott Republicans. You won‚Äôt regret it! üòâ
@DavidJ_Carr @psell2flat03 @Politics_Polls @EmersonPolling @ForecasterEnten Statistically, she could be leading. But come on, it is FAR more likely she is down significantly- equal probability of her leading and getting demolished by over 20 points. Bad use of "statistical tie".
@galizerigfanda @lolwutbrosef @Politics_Polls Ok, I see where you are coming from. Though Trump *probably* carries it by a larger than pale red margin if status quo is maintained.
@EmersonPolling @amyklobuchar @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Did you guys push undecideds? That is a fairly significant number. Not surprised with the regular #MnSen - @amyklobuchar is a machine!
@galizerigfanda @lolwutbrosef @Politics_Polls Presidential wise, it has become fairly red, but is still very much a swing state downballot. Democrat Jason Kander narrowly lost last year and the gubernatorial election was a tossup as well.
@politicsluo I want polling in general, not enough quality polls!
@toho88 @SenhorRaposa One poll is not reason to shift a race. I think Cramer is a very slight favorite at this point, but it is certainly a tossup.
@politico_chris But let's be real. If this is Leans R, #AZSen is Leans D. Sinema has a commanding polling lead over all Republicans, with far more data backing it up.
@mountainpartywv @zatchry Piss off.
@JoinRocky at 10.4%(!) in Hawaii GOP Senate primary.The Rocky-mentum is real.
@Politics1com Crazy how, 40 years later, they would wage a war against passing that very amendment. After so much social progress during those decades, they managed to go backwards on the ERA.
@RandySF45 @ActorAaronBooth Good luck getting people to write in that name!
@avonhun @NateSilver538 Democratic voters are more inclined this cycle to donate to individual candidates, while GOP voters are donating to organizations like the RNC (because of Trump). In OH-12 election, O'Connor outraised Balderson but Balderson had more PAC money behind him, causing the discrepancy.
@JayAlver @MaureenMpeditor @politico What's the point? Nobody else up there to fight, and we can't put WMDs up there (outer space treaty). Waste of taxpayer money that could be better directed towards exploring space (NASA) and being a force for good at home.
@BruneElections Thank you senate witch! The best!
@sjbsms @4everNeverTrump Well, it was an extremely Republican district for one. The fact that it was within one point is incredible progress. Another try for @dannyoconnor1  in November!

Elections have consequences. Bush‚Äôs election lead to two wars and thousands dead, and economic collapse. It‚Äôs a shame some immensely privileged ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù would side with a loony party that won‚Äôt win over the party that can bring about progressive change to America. (2/2)
Let‚Äôs look at two outsider movements: Democratic Socialists and The Green Party. DemSocs, like AOC, run in primaries, while Greens run as spoilers, helping Republicans like George Bush and Troy Balderson win close elections. (1/2)

@Kevcrick @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump I get what you are saying. To me it seems fair and worth consideration but to each his own. Have a nice day üëçüèª

@bricey16 @gelliottmorris Dana got about 30%(!) in the primary. Overall GOP captured a slim majority of voters.
@ActorAaronBooth @SenatorMenendez @BobHugin How does Trump go from 32% approval rating from 2017 GE in NJ to just -3 in a few months? Tax reform did not have nearly that large of an impact in polling.
@ActorAaronBooth @EmersonPolling Survey Monkey poll looking even more like an outlier.
@EGTheRealist @jaredsblank @ActorAaronBooth For sure. #FlSen is going to be close and expensive as hell. Definitely the two incumbents who need money the most.
@ChazNuttycombe Scared we'll see a 2016 redux where too many candidates leads to Sanders winning nom and gifting Trump 2nd term
@jaredsblank @ActorAaronBooth Lot of that was for the primary I bet. Donnelly looks to be the most in need of $ of any Senate Dem at this point.
@ArtfulButler @BruneElections This. IIRC, it does not work on Chrome so I had to use Safari
@CristieDoran3 @Compos_mentis01 @WalshFreedom Obama wanted to warn the public in bipartisan fashion. Mitch McConnell refused and said he would make it partisan if he did! This is on the GOP!
@dcg1114 @NateSilver538 Cox also had a congress willing to assist and stand up for justice above partisan politics. If Mueller had that Congress, Trump would probably be gone too.
@politicsluo Like, look at it from a neutral POV. She isn't exactly making allies in Congress, so how can she expect to get her agenda through? Not good politics.

After watching them defend Trump's racism, sexism, and now his seperation of families, it is clear to me that @HillaryClinton was spot on in calling Trump supporters "deplorables." The only thing she was wrong about was that she greatly underestimated the numbers of the depraved.

@Politics_Polls @GravisMarketing Interesting. Even with Trump approval strong, GOP candidates struggling significantly. Down in gov race by a few points and down 10 (!) in Senate race. Appears as if GOP can't count on voters warming on Don to stop the #BlueWave2018
