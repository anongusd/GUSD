Ongoing work at 094196784. Gage height is sensed by an instrument called a non-submersible pressure transducer in the gage.  Techs are installing the orifice, a hose that gets anchored in the water. The gage calculates back-pressure on the orifice and converts it to gage height. https://t.co/lkRlWb7jKL
We successfully moved the gage about 600 ft upstream at 094196784 LAS VEGAS WASH AT VEGAS VALLEY DR and are preparing to mix up some concrete for the form around the gage support legs.  Reason for relocation? Variable backwater from sewage treatment plant just downstream. https://t.co/02vUWdaVIT
