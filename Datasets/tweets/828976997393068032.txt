He is recorded saying he can grab women anytime he wants and get away with it. So far he has. https://t.co/losBNOtSln
Fifth, he can‚Äôt control his impulses. He calls many especially women childish names like ‚Äúpigs‚Äù, and ‚Äúlosers‚Äù. He even criticized Megyn Kelly‚Äôs menstrual cycle.
Fourth he has a serious attention disorder. Tony Schwartz, author of ‚ÄúThe Art of the Deal‚Äù says he‚Äôs never met anyone so restricted. Trump can‚Äôt keep his mind on anything for more than short period of time. This might explain his prolific lying. He makes up what he doesn‚Äôt know.
Third, he can‚Äôt remember what he says or flip flops on. He doesn‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt remember when his lies are exposed. He keeps repeating them anyway. https://t.co/losBNOtSln
Second, he is anti-American. Yes! If he is anti-African American (see the hate he has tweeted), anti-Muslim American, anti-women and anti-Mexican Americans, he will divide us against us. He will not make America great again, but make America hate again more than ever.
Five Mental Problems		First, he has an his utter disregard for the truth. Politifact analyzed his statements and found 70% to be untrue or lies. He appears to have serious problems with reality. This is one of his worse.  https://t.co/losBNOtSln

A veteran pollster and political strategist, Fabrizio worked on Ukrainian elections with Manafort and went on to serve as the Trump campaign's chief pollster beginning in the spring of 2016. https://t.co/Gh7g7ogBNs
Fabrizio's involvement with Mueller is intriguing because he's one of the few people in Manafort's orbit with knowledge of the inner-workings of the Trump campaign as well as Manafort's Eastern European connections. https://t.co/Gh7g7ogBNs
Manafort's attorneys tried to redact the fact that prosecutors knew Manafort shared polling data related to the 2016 presidential election with his Russian intelligence-linked associate Konstantin Kilimnik while running Trump's presidential campaign.  https://t.co/Gh7g7ogBNs

@lmcdonald124 @pjg318 @MarshallCohen @AdamParkhomenko @kpolantz 3) Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide and Manafort‚Äôs longtime junior business partner, was indicted on similar charges to Manafort. But in February he agreed to a plea deal with Mueller‚Äôs team, pleading guilty to just one false statements charge and one conspiracy charge.
@lmcdonald124 @pjg318 @MarshallCohen @AdamParkhomenko @kpolantz 2) Paul Manafort, Trump‚Äôs former campaign chair, was indicted on a total of 25 different counts by Mueller‚Äôs team, related mainly to his past work for Ukrainian politicians and his finances.
@lmcdonald124 @pjg318 @MarshallCohen @AdamParkhomenko @kpolantz 1) George Papadopoulos, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, was arrested in July 2017 and pleaded guilty last October to making false statements to the FBI. He got a 14-day sentence.
@lmcdonald124 @pjg318 @MarshallCohen @AdamParkhomenko @kpolantz Nothing yet??? If you also count investigations that Mueller originated but then referred elsewhere in the Justice Department, you can add a plea deal from one more person to the list. https://t.co/jW2v67g9vg

1989, Trump said: ‚ÄúI think sometimes a black may think they don‚Äôt have an advantage or this and that.

In 1989, Trump took out ads in NY newspapers urging the death penalty for five black &amp; Latino teenagers accused of raping a white woman in Central Park; he argued they were guilty as late as October 2016, more than 10 years after DNA evidence had exonerated them. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP

Memorial Day 1927, the white supremacist, anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic Ku Klux Klan organised a march in New York City‚Äôs borough of Queens, home to the German-American Trump family, whose patriarch, Friedrich Trump, had emigrated to the United States in 1885. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP

Several studies and surveys have stated that racist attitudes and racial resentment have fueled Trump's political ascendance, and have become more significant than economic factors in determining party allegiance of voters. @realDonaldTrump 	https://t.co/GfDgYWkEyl https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP
In 2018, during an Oval Office meeting about immigration reform, he referred to El Salvador, Haiti, and African countries as "shitholes"; this comment was internationally condemned as racist. @realDonaldTrump 	https://t.co/GfDgYWkEyl https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP
Comments he made following a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia were perceived as implying a moral equivalence between violence used by white supremacist marchers and violence used by those who protested against them. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/GfDgYWkEyl https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP
He tweeted fake statistics claiming that black Americans are responsible for the majority of murders of whites, and in some speeches he linked African-Americans and Hispanics with violent crime. @realDonaldTrump 	https://t.co/GfDgYWkEyl https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP
He was accused of racism in 2016, that a group of black &amp; Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the Central Park jogger case, although an imprisoned serial rapist had confessed in 2002. @realDonaldTrump 	https://t.co/GfDgYWkEyl https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP
In 2011, Trump became the leading proponent of the already discredited "Birtherism" conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the US, and he repeated the claim for the following five years.[8][9] @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP
In 1973, Trump and his company Trump Management were sued by the U.S. Department of Justice for housing discrimination against black renters‚Äîa lawsuit which, according to Trump, he settled without an admission of guilt.[5][6][7] 	https://t.co/GfDgYWkEyl https://t.co/oez1HyXTLP
