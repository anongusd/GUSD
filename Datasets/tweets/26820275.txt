#HRC, the wealthy can't pay for everything. Check the numbers. Obamacare took 3 quarter of a billion dollars for Medicare.
Love @realDonaldTrump and his optimism for our country. Hillary quoting Republicans again. Yikes. #desperate. What is the fair share again?
@FoxNewsSunday (Chris) is doing a great job hammering both candidates.
@SenScottBrown Chris. Great job
Trump is right. We don't know who the rebels are.  Love his pivots. She is wrong on Syrian refugees
Trump was a civilian during Iraq war. Who cares what he thought. She voted for it. He is 100% correct. Isis has left.  He is correct on Iran
We are not an occupying force. Unreal. We never have been. Without leaving a transition, training force we will be here again. #clueless.
Trump is correct on voter registrations issues. We need to show a form of voter ID.
@billclinton =cigars. Careful #HRC.
Every time he nails her on an issue, she smiles.
Who is this guy?  @realDonaldTrump is nailing it. She goes back to all the old cliches. He has created jobs, she has not.
#HRC on economy = hold on to your wallets and pocket books.When u hear Investment = raise taxes Scripted. Wow.Trump nailed economic question
#HRC is flustered. Scripted. He is correct about us funding security of other countries. They need to pay their fair share.
#HRC is baiting @realDonaldTrump on Putin. Why doesn't Obama do something about the Russians then?
@realDonaldTrump nails immigration question. Out of shadows = amnesty. Now she is quoting Republicans. Unreal. Ugh blame the Russians
#HRC has no answer for immigration issue. She is looking for illegal immigration vote. She wants sanctuary cities, Syrian refugees #weak
#HRC is struggling with abortion question. Go figure.
#HRC is in favor of partial and full term abortion. I'm pro-choice, but that is just not right.
Trump nailed 2nd amendment question.
She is slinging it already on 2nd amendment. Ugh.
Great first question by Chris on Supreme Court.  Biggest issue affecting our country. #HRC does not support 2nd amendment, Trump does.

Great@FoxBusiness #GOPDebate tonight. @MariaBartiromo and @TeamCavuto. Setting the standard. Will be on w/@MariaBartiromo 6-8am @FoxBusiness
Based on answers, time &amp; clarity, in order Rubio, Cruz,Bush, Kasich, Trump/Carson, Fiorina, Paul. Will explain in AM on @MariaBartiromo show
While the format is better and allows for more in depth answers, it also makes for less back and forth and time for each. #nhpolitics
@marcorubio has great optimism for our country's future. Agree that we should repatriate offshore money. Congress won't do it. #nhpolitics
@JohnKasich went too far. Seems to want pick winners and losers with depositors. Bad crowd reaction. @realDonaldTrump needs to jump in more
@marcorubio doesn't get much time, but when he speaks, he is spot on. #nhpolitics
@realDonaldTrump on a roll. @JebBush stronger. @CarlyFiorina jab, jab, jab like a boxer. #nhpolitics
@marcorubio v @RandPaul   Marco wins that one. Good back &amp; forth on this segmnt.Great @realDonaldTrump answer on military/taxes. #nhpolitics
@JebBush -solid answer on his tax plan and then showing difference with HRC. @marcorubio always brings it back to reg. families. #nhpolitics
@RandPaul knows a lot about balanced budgets. Good answer on taxes and balancing budget. #nhpolitics
@JohnKasich won the 1st couple of blocks due to masterful use of time &amp; using other people's time.Way better than CNBC debacle. #nhpolitics
@tedcruz nailed ans on immigration. Dem proposal hurts wages &amp; our sovereignty. Aruba's immigration policy is tougher than ours #nhpolitics

The only way to change direction and be a check and balance to the President and his failed policies is to change senators.  #nhsen
For 6 years, with no pushback from our senior Senator, Washington has chipped away at our rights and freedoms. #nhsen
.@JeanneShaheen voted to pave the way for a national energy tax that would increase home heating costs for NH families. #nhsen
I have stood strong against Obamacare. @JeanneShaheen calls it a vote she is “absolutely” proud of. #nhsen
More than 22,000 Granite Staters have lost their health care because of @jeanneshaheen’s vote for Obamacare w/ thousands more to follow.
For the last 6 years, @JeanneShaheen voted with Obama 99% of the time. Is the President right 99% of the time? #nhsen
I have always been a pro-choice independent Republican, @JeanneShaheen is desperate to distort my record and scare voters #nhsen
I strongly support equal pay for equal work. In my Senate office, women earned $1.21 for every dollar men did. #nhsen
.@JeanneShaheen voted to pave the way for a national energy tax and is anti-supply, driving up costs. #nhsen
Energy prices in NH are soaring. @JeanneShaheen is anti-supply, we need an all-of-the-above approach to increase supply #nhsen
When handling Ebola, we need to put public safety ahead of personal inconvenience. #nhsen
.@JeanneShaheen has a 0% rating with the NFIB, voting against NH’s 1,500 members and their employees 100% of the time. #nhsen
People are rightly concerned about Ebola, it’s a rational fear demanding independent leadership. #nhsen
With all the new threats we face to our way of life, an open border represents a serious challenge to our national security &amp; safety. #nhsen
America does not occupy nations. We liberate them. #nhsen
ISIS is a real threat and @JeanneShaheen seems confused about how to handle the situation. #nhsen

As President Obama said recently, he’s not on the ballot but his entire agenda is.
People have deep worries about national security &amp; border security – and all this when so many are still worried about job security.
When the enemies of our country are planning attacks and our leaders in Washington are planning amnesty, something is wrong.
I believe our state deserves an independent senator who will put party loyalty aside, and put our national interests first every time
The Obama administration seems only more confused as things unravel.  This is what the world looks like without American leadership.

This better safer direction for our country adds up to a lot of important choices, and the first belongs to the voters.
We can secure our own border, blocking the path of anyone who would do us harm- we have to do it.
We live in the greatest country in the world, and this nation can lead again.
The stronger we are, the safer we are. Our allies need to trust us once again, and our foes need to fear and respect us.
We have got to get serious about securing our borders, and we'd better do it yesterday.
But where there is confusion, indecision, and incoherence in foreign policy, I will challenge, question, and never fall in line w/ anyone.
When any president is clear and resolute in defense of America’s interests, it won’t matter to me if we’re of the same party or not.
I view the job of a senator very differently, and party politics has got nothing to do with it. #nhpolitics
The bill went to Senator Shaheen’s committee, the Foreign Relations Committee – where, once again, they did exactly nothing.
In 2012 I introduced a bill instructing then Secretary of State Clinton to designate Boko Haram as the terrorist organization that it is.
Sen. Shaheen insisted that the group, Boko Haram, operating in and around Nigeria, is not really an Islamic terrorist group.
The Foreign Relations Committee was hearing testimony on the threat of ISIS a year ago. Guess what?  Sen. Shaheen missed the meeting.
One member who didn’t join us was Senator Jeanne Shaheen.  Then as now, she wasn’t in the habit of questioning the administration.
In Oct. '11, I joined my colleagues in a letter challenging the administration to reconsider the complete abandonment of the Iraqi people.
Sen. Shaheen is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee…And she has a record that is readily summed up in a single number: 99 percent.
This is what foreign policy looks like without clarity and conviction.  This is what the world looks like without American leadership.
It’s as if the Obama administration is maxed out, worn down, devoid of ideas, and now all the bills are coming due. #nhpolitics
We’re at a dangerous moment for our country and our friends.  It’s starting to feel like the world is on fire. #nhpolitics
