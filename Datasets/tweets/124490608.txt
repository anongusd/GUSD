But the beautiful thing about recent generations is that they are incredibly proud of their Hispanic culture and want to instill that pride of our language, histories, and values Into our children as they continue to assimilate into this beautiful country that is America.
Both past generations as well as recent generations have always assimilated. Maybe some of our abuelitas never learned to speak English, but they are the exception. My children to whom I speak only Spanish at home, speak English better than some of my US native born friends.
Mr. @tombrokaw, I respect and like you but you were DEAD wrong on your recent comment about how Hispanics need to assimilate. I just responded to it on @CNNnewsroom.  CNN.This shows you’re out of touch with the reality of what is going on in the Latino community.

Another set of whoppers!  Obama did NOT have the policy of separating children from their mothers.  @POTUS has zero interest or a clue of what the root problem is in the countries the migrants are from.
Just wow.  There are approximately 11.4 million undoc immigrants in the US.  Not 15 million, not 20 million, not 22 million.
What "job" is the US Military prepared to do when and if the migrants get to the border?  Trump says the US Military will "get the job done."  What does that mean?
So, Trump is closing the borders?
If Paul Ryan would bring to the floor the comprehensive immigration reform bill of 2013, it would pass with majority Dem votes.  Where are Republicans on wanting to fix this complicated problem?  No where.

Her family feels she and her death are being used. I will defer to them. And they happen to be right. https://t.co/gwxPUkTTDw

Even #MollieTibbets’ own family does not want @realDonaldTrump to use her death for his cheap political shots, fear mongering, and racist attempts to impugn all immigrants. Mollie was killed by an evil man who may or may not have been here illegally. #StopPoliticizingMolliesDeath
Immigrants commit violent crimes at much lower rates than native born Americans. One violent crime is one too many, &amp; that is why we need comprehensive immigration reform, but to use #MollieTibbetts’ death to paint all immigrants as criminals is disgusting, racist, bigoted.

Let's be clear- "Chain Migration" is a dog whistle to right-wing anti immigrant extremists. The right terminology is Family Reunification. And we should all be for it. Communities are much more stable when families are unified and kept together.

Let's be clear - Dems have always been for strong, robust border security - not a 2200 mile long brick and mortar wall.  And btw, why is @POTUS asking for $18 billion for a wall that supposedly Mexico was going to pay for? @GOP needs to stop taking DACA kids hostage!!
