If you are using the word Next at the end of your Tweets or FBPost your a donkey.
@LizbethMateo What makes you so special. Why are you given more rights than the usual illegal immigrant.

@PrimaSoho @SreeniSreeni13 @RashidaTlaib I get it. You don’t want to let your guard down. The very second you do you probably feel at a  loss. That is a good thing.  Your human. But hey what do I know.  We both have been throwing insults and we keep coming back for more. Cheers.
@PrimaSoho @SreeniSreeni13 @RashidaTlaib While trying to understand you , and make conversation with you, you attack me. Why is that. Believe me I can throw funny sick memes. But what is your problem with me. We think different. Nothing wrong with that.
Why do so many young people support Bernie? his appeal is socialism. Why are so many that ignorant?
@RepRashida @repjohnlewis https://t.co/w0yvLlDsvw
@PrimaSoho @SreeniSreeni13 @RashidaTlaib Damn you really have a lot problem with America. Why you still here?
@PattyMurray We voted for the Wall we want the wall. If your mad get mad at me. I voted for our President.
@RepLloydDoggett But if you google fake news you will be able to see evidence of just that fake news. Gathering evidence and coming to an conclusion for me  Media is being an enemy. Especially news.
@PrimaSoho @SreeniSreeni13 @RashidaTlaib You support ISIS.

@PattyMurray If we as a country finished the wall we would never have been in this Predicament. We need the wall. If you want to go after anyone through me. My vote counts. #ivotedihelpediwall
@RepDeSaulnier @realDonaldTrump Our country has so many problems because it refuses to fix the first line of Defense. It’s not that hard.
@RepJimBanks She lied about it. That’s why it’s divided our country. It is built on lies.
@PattyMurray 52% of Border Patrol are Hispanic. Your racism card is played out Madam.
@michaelpollan While AOC dines and wines she wants people to this. GTFOH
Our Border Patrol is 52% Hispanic. Keep with that Damn Nazi Narrative. SMH
@JSLmommy @SreeniSreeni13 @PrimaSoho @RashidaTlaib Her supporters are the same way

@ChuntiLi @ZayZayPayDay @AGBecerra Says the kid holding a gun as a profile pic. What a Joke.
@CongPalazzo The Coast Guard is the Red Headed step Child of the Military. Go Army. lol
@PrimaSoho @SreeniSreeni13 @RashidaTlaib Well let’s agree to disagree. We are both different people from different worlds. No need to waste each other’s energy. Your a Democrat and I am a Republican. There is no changing that. Have a nice Day.
@SreeniSreeni13 @PrimaSoho @RashidaTlaib Someone who washes their hands in Terror cells needs to resign. If a person gets defensive or loud and angry. Even blocking. They know that they are wrong and hiding their guilt. These types are spitting US in two.
@PrimaSoho @SreeniSreeni13 @RashidaTlaib If you don’t see issues with what I said then our General Population  of US is far more delusional than I realized.
@PrimaSoho @SreeniSreeni13 @RashidaTlaib Europe
@PrimaSoho @SreeniSreeni13 @RashidaTlaib Rashida Tlaib has been condemned after hosting a private celebratory dinner on Saturday featuring anti-Israel activists who praised terror group Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorists, said Israel has no right to exist and called for Israeli “Zionist terrorist” Jews to return to
@AGBecerra @JaredHuffman So how do you want our border protected.  It’s the Americans that voted for him that wanted it. Come after me instead. We gave him the power because Trump was our voice. #ivotediwantthewall
@HillaryClinton How are still relevant in today’s politics. You lost get over it.

@Emma4Change Gun Control? Look at what it takes to get a gun. Fight for the Majority that don’t break the law. Not the Minority https://t.co/GHzTIAZNwJ
@TahoeBoulder @DanCrenshawTX @redismyfavorit3 Crossing illegally is a crime. What don’t you understand.

@RepWexton Which elected official did #FakeEmergency. It is common among all of the tweets. Just do the job for the people. #stepup
@RepDMP How does Venezuela treats it’s illegal immigrants. Congratulations to to giving power to others but not US.
@bobby_mccourt @arttavana @AOC How about sports teams. Would you want to eliminate those too.
My first Tweet.  Donald Trump please have a public audit of Fort Knox. Thank You.
@randallwoodfin Why was this acceptable and no one batted an eye. https://t.co/aTOFDoqBEs

@RepTimRyan Are you protecting the Minority’s of this country or the Majority of this country;like me. In this this picture who loses and who wins. https://t.co/2dubX4NUad
@jmejia1187 @RepJoseSerrano @AppropsDems @SenateApprops So you believe that nine states should have all the power while the rest are voice less. Not cool.
@RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Change my mind with facts. Not rhetorical sayings. https://t.co/eNogRo8Rmc
@RepJoseSerrano @AppropsDems @SenateApprops When are you going to take the fight on to WE THE PEOPLE. Stop with the B. S. Trump this trump that. We the people voted him in. We wanted this from the get go. He seems to have tussled the feathers of the guiltily.
@RepLloydDoggett But we the people voted him in to do so. That was our call to make this happen. Why not look at us sir. And take your fight to WE THE PEOPLE.
@RepDelBene But we the people voted him in to do so. It’s our elected officials to do what we the people ask for and voted for. Is it not that simple.
@RepJayapal @justinamash https://t.co/xqOZeQ9K6N
@ljone @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Thank you what
@RepJayapal There is no way to
@cmaddenmft @SenTedCruz @GayRepublicSwag I understand why you left now you now why I left. I’m 40 now. Not a father when I was involved in the Democratic Party. I was uninformed. I’ve made mistakes. I own those mistakes. I can’t believe what I once a part of. Looking back I was naieve
@cmaddenmft @SenTedCruz @GayRepublicSwag I’m sorry we seem to be at a impass on this issue. I can’t believe in my heart about kkk nazis  and other hateful groups When almost all of elected Democrat officials believe in abortions. Just study the voting records of the elected officials.
@cmaddenmft @SenTedCruz @GayRepublicSwag I’m a former Democrat. I see that the Democratic Party is ran by Crazier People. Who wants to give and give and give. That’s not how this works at all.
@bobby_mccourt @arttavana @AOC No sir but I know successful people. People who made their own way. I applaud their efforts. I’m Not envy of them. I’m successful in my own right. It’s hard work.
@RepJayapal Will Medical for all slow down future Doctors who want to become Doctors. Thirty years from now the Headlines will be Not enough Doctors being trained. Why would someone want to be a Doctor if there  way to pay off the Student Loans.
@bobby_mccourt @arttavana @AOC So if you start your business. You get successful. And need to expand. You can’t because of a cap. Wouldn’t that make you change the way you feel about what Happened to Amazon. We never know if our idea is the next big thing. Why should the Govt. tell you how to run it.
@cmaddenmft @SenTedCruz @GayRepublicSwag A weaker work ethic. A weaker sense of mind. Like Bernie Sanders who hates the rich but rich himself. What is it about this party that is so attractive.
@cmaddenmft @SenTedCruz @GayRepublicSwag Your a liberal and I’m a Republican. I’m assuming. So forgive me. What is it do you all want. I’m always confused. You all don’t want border Security. Many have began to mock our Values.  The majority of the elected officials are for abortions. A weaker Military
@RepJoeKennedy Aren’t we a Foreign Threat when we give money to other elections across the country.
@bobby_mccourt @arttavana @AOC That comment is how communist country is born. Be careful what you wish for.
@JimFKenney I’m from Texas. It’s sad that your able  to talk so ugly about the commander and chief On  a public forum.  Check yourself. You are representing your state.
@cmaddenmft @SenTedCruz @GayRepublicSwag Sounds like you support El. Chapo.  Because he built a Tunnel.
@winklevosss @RepLoudermilk Why did the Democrats support the wall in 2006. Why is it so hard to give the Border Patrol what they need.
@AOC @sunrisemvmt Shouldn’t you be working for the people of New York? Not going on a 15 city tour.
@gabecortez If my form of simplicity can’t be applied what makes your form acceptable?
@gabecortez Would you want the United States Government to Control your actions of your businesses?                           The Great thing about the US is the  Freedom of where we want our products going. Would you be willing to give up that Control so easily?
@gabecortez  how can one be an entrepreneur and a Democrat Socialist at the same time?
@Stop_Trump20 @Normsmusic Complaining about Rent then sells story for millions to Netflix. No one see a problem here.
@Stop_Trump20 @Normsmusic How is this going to be paid for?
