@R4ND4LL_H @MartinHeinrich @GovGaryJohnson Truth is that Gary's the best chance to unseat Heinrich because he can pull Dem votes. The statewide Republican candidates that can pull this off are @hendricks4nmag, @Pearce4NM, and @DrGavinClarkson. The other Repub candidate I believe could win in November is @Yvette4congress.
@R4ND4LL_H @MartinHeinrich @GovGaryJohnson The reality is that this wasn't a race Mick was winning even without Gary in the race. Mick hasn't built enough name recognition and is running on to hard of a Trump platform to win in a predominantly blue state where Republicans need to pull dem votes to win.
@R4ND4LL_H @MartinHeinrich @GovGaryJohnson Poll done by IN LUX RESEARCH this past week where dems, repubs, and independents were evenly polled rather than excluding a large percent of the largest voting block. https://t.co/2plmmXLQ4Q
@R4ND4LL_H @MartinHeinrich @GovGaryJohnson Yeah a poll in which they only polled 12% of independents, which make up the largest voting block. Easy to skew results when the poll is all DEM/REPUB likely voters. Once the independent likely voters are factored in he drops to 10%
@clairecmc This from a Woman that takes Soros "dark money" and who's finance report looks like a NASCAR race car full of big corporation donors. Can someone say hypocrite? https://t.co/Je6DRURKji
@R4ND4LL_H @MartinHeinrich @GovGaryJohnson Sorry bro but when Mick's polling in the 10% range Mick's the spoiler and a vote for him is a vote for "Marty"
@clairecmc Of course you will, that's why Missouri needed Austin Peterson.
@KamalaHarris The blue wave will be a blue splash and we will get a SCOTUS appointment who will uphold the Constitution rather than legislate from the bench.
@MartinHeinrich Nothing more than dragging of feet in an attempt to hold up a SCOTUS appointment until after the midterms. This is exactly why we need @GovGaryJohnson for Senate!
@SenWarren You mean Democrats want to drag their feet till the midterms. Problem is your blue wave will most likely be more like a blue splash. The midterms won't help you block Trumps SCOTUS appointment.

@rucadr1 @Pearce4NM But rather than display any factual information to support your claim you rather resort to verbal attacks which means you lack the facts to even argue your solution.
@rucadr1 @Pearce4NM Do you think any type of universal or single payer healthcare isn't government controlled? Do you think that it being that way won't elevate taxes? Look at Europe with 40%+ income tax. A system that's currently falling apart at its seams. That's not insanity it's facts.
Are you a Conservative in NM? Do you want to see the AG seat flip Republican for the first time in decades? Direct message me to find out how! The time to act is now!
@rucadr1 @Pearce4NM Has government involvement in college tuition through financial aid lowered the cost of higher education? No, in fact it's consistently increased the cost since it's inception and lowered quality. The same will happen with government controled healthcare.
@rucadr1 @Pearce4NM Single payer puts government before tax payers and that's not any better. Their push to eliminate private industry is what drives up the prices not the other way around. Less government involvement lowers the cost and increases the quility through innovation and advancement.
@rucadr1 @Pearce4NM I have several family members in the healthcare industry. They drive up costs of healthcare through cronyism, lack of price transparency, and picking winners and losers. This is done on both sides. Get government out of healthcare and end the cronyism.

@rucadr1 @Pearce4NM In my opinion the best way to stablize them is to get government out of the way and let the free market thrive. In many ways government itself drives up the cost of healthcare and insurance through cronyism and over regulation. Same with education.

@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Then do your job and change the law. Put in the work to write a bill for immigration reform, put in the time to gain it support and get it passed.

@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I agree we need extensive immigration reform, I even agree with simplifying and expediting the process, but if you want to do that then Congress needs to do their job and pass a bill for it, they need to change the law. Glad we won't be separating children now.

@KymMarieR @Pearce4NM None of those things happened because of Pearce or tax reform. That's a result of the left's minimum wage policies and ever increasing minimum wage. When you increase minimum wage you lose low level and entry level jobs. Those policies hurt those they aim to help.

@KamalaHarris Because throwing money at the problem will fix it? Like throwing money at FEMA has helped in any natural disaster? Perhaps, like Florida, they shouldn't have removed the natural mangrove barriers to create pretty beaches to attract tourists. That would've solved it quite well.

@storksusan @KelticSC @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris @TaxAct Maybe cause the elections been over for over a year and you still have a hillary logo for a profile pic and share similar traits of back pettling you explanation.
@storksusan @KelticSC @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris @TaxAct It is a form for federal financial aid. You claimed it's to see what you get. Which is inaccurate, you didn't grasp EFC and what that does and how it works. If they don't live with you during college it's not even needed to fill out EFC. But back petal just like hillary did ;)
@storksusan @KelticSC @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris It's what gets you your pell grant, it's what shows you the student loans you qualify for, which are throigh the DOE, thus federal student loans. They only take parents income into accountif they're a dependent and it facters in estimated family contribution.
@storksusan @KelticSC @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris You should really educate yourself, you don't file FAFSA with your taxes. FAFSA is Federal Assistance For Student Aid. It's litterally for your financial aid. I filled it out every year in college... Lol.

@DAirschilde @vg2325 @KamalaHarris Like I said, a corporation is it's own entity, owned by no one which is why it gives limited liabilty and protects personal assets if sued. That's the point of incorporating. But by doing so you risk hostle takeovers like Apple did to Steve Jobs before bringing him back.
@DAirschilde @vg2325 @KamalaHarris They do not determine staff, pay rates etc. That's done by the CEO, the CFO, the COO, which sit on the board of directors, or managing or supervising staff. Many times members of the board of directors are majority stockholders but they still get paid a salary through payroll.
@DAirschilde @vg2325 @KamalaHarris Yes majority shareholders get more in dividends and have a controlling interest in decisions if they're a majority stockholder. Through votes among stockholders. Majority stockholders votes weigh heavier. They vote on the board of directors and the direction of the corporation.
@DAirschilde @vg2325 @KamalaHarris You don't understand how stocks work. Stockholders get a dividend check. It's a certain percentage per stock. They don't take all the profit and divide it up between stockholders. Most of the profit stays in the corporation. Board of Directors and staff are payed through payroll.
@cdahlgrd @Arlo3833 @KamalaHarris Probably because FAFSA came to be in 1965 over the next 10-15 years they climbed, since then they've drastically climbed.
@danielfrost @deanepstein @KamalaHarris Why do you think the banks gave out so many morgages? Because the interest rate is a market signal whether or not to invest. When the fed artificially keep it high they invested. When it came down it lead to the morgage crisis. Same thing with the stock market burst in 1929 ;)
@vg2325 @KamalaHarris Wow, you really bite hard on that propaganda and the fact that you argue with memes tells me you have zero facts and simply repeat progressive talking points.
@vg2325 @KamalaHarris Businesses are closing because of the cost to meet over government regulation. Again government is the problem not the solution.
@KamalaHarris Then get government out of education, end FAFSA which colleges to drive up the cost of tuituon forcing students to have to take loans to attend which all come from the department of education leaving them in perpetual debt to the federal government.
@storksusan @KelticSC @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris She couldn't afford college because of FAFSA causing a massive tuition hike. College would be much more affordable without government involvement. Government is the problem not the solution. Gain skills, get a better job. There's more than college which can bring more income.
@storksusan You should do a little more research than simply repeating what you hear from progressive mouth pieces. The wealthy got zero tax cuts in the tax reform bill. They cut taxes for corporations, middle class, and doubled the standard deductions.
Everyone talks about the different types of reform we need when what we really need is complete "GOVERNMENT REFORM"		We need limited government returned to its constitutional limits, politicians who are the voice of the people rather than puppets for agendas.		#governmentreform

@danielfrost @deanepstein @KamalaHarris Do some better research. The 2008 crash was a result of the federal reserve and artifically increasing the interest rate. It was the very same reason we had the crash in 1929 leading to the great depression. It's what happens when you run on credit rather than the gold standard.
@IjuakosXqwzts @moekaye1 @Jolena3 @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris It's quite simple if you make a profit while creating value for the consumer then you've made good profit. If you turn a profit while creating no value for the consumer ie: faulty products, deceptive marketing, etc. You've made bad profit. The goal is to make good not bad profit.
@sharkinaj @moekaye1 @Jolena3 @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris It only leads to societal problems when tied in with cronyism in government and with growth of government. There's a difference between good profit and bad profit. Good profit is turning a profit while creating value for the consumer. Businesses should aim for good profit.
@BballMichael @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris agrrehere shouldn't be any subsidizing OR socialized programs. I agree subsidies cause just as much failure and damage. They just hold up failing markets that are failing for a reason. Which is why I advocate for shrinking government not growing it and oppose cronyism.
@ThreeRingSam @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Yes because Venezuela is doing so well. If you're referring to Norway, Denmark, and Sweden they're countries that have strong "free market" economies who recognize private property rights not socialist.
@ThreeRingSam @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris The government shouldn't run like a business. You're advocating for bigger government not me. Government should be returned to it's constitutional limits. Military for defense only, regulate interstate commerce, protect and enforce constitutional and independent rights only.
@JohnCarltonKing @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris The 100's of economics books I've read contain actual economics. How many have you read? Economics isn't just wants spewed to you in progressive talking points and in rules for radicals.
@ThreeRingSam @electrovert @KamalaHarris Social Security very much is an entitlement when government already squandered what was payed in. That's governments fault not those they steal from to pay for it. You know the government that you feel is competent enough to control healthcare. You may trust them I don't.

@SoniaMontez @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris I've read 100's of books on economocs, governmental systems, markets, business, healthcare, and law. There's a reason why every socialized system is failing, there's a reason why every socialist government fails. It breeds cronyism and corruption leading to Venezuela.
@SoniaMontez @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris So you deny facts for false narrative. Again do some real research rather than bite on propaganda. Research the difference between cronyism and capitalism and look at your system you advocate for.		https://t.co/3y6elurPHc
@SoniaMontez @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Facts don't lie, again this is the broken system you defend that's beginning to crash around the world and bringing people to our for profit system. 		https://t.co/2NYWfjRipt
@SoniaMontez @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Recap, you're confusing cronyism woth capitalism, that's a result of growing government involvement and gets worse with more government involvement. Capitalism is not the same as cronyism which is what's taking place in healthcare now.		https://t.co/2NYWfjRipt
@SoniaMontez @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris I have an aunt who holds a doctorate degree in medicine. It's illegal to refuse care in an emergency room. Perhaps if hospotals are violating that we should fix that broken system and fine hospitals rather then replace with another broken system.
@moekaye1 @Jolena3 @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Not surprising because a business professor advocating that business isn't about profit wouldn't be in business long... Lol.
@KyleRowland17 @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris You're paying for the Senators 3rd boat now through the over abundance in taxes, growth in government, thus allowing for cronyism. Asking for more growth in government doesn't solve that problem it makes it worse.
@KyleRowland17 @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris See that's the problem you don't look at the whole picture and only look at income tax. Figure in fed income, state income in some places, sales tax, gross receipts tax, gas tax, etc. Then see how much you pay in taxes regardless of how much you make.
@moekaye1 @Jolena3 @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Wow, so then what should business be about, in their opinion? There's a difference between good profit and bad profit. Business should be about good profit not bad. We need a better education system.
These are the shortcomings of socialized medicine. Yes individuals should be able to get medical treatment, yes medical care should be affordable, but government is not the answer.		https://t.co/2NYWfjRipt
@moekaye1 @Jolena3 @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Tell me one example of a "free anything" that "NOBODY" paid for.
@SoniaMontez @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Really because I'm certain that you can walk into any emergency room in the country and get care regardless of having any money or not. Granted it'll go on your credit uf you don't pay but you wull still receive care.

@cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris You should do some of you're own research rather than buying into what you're told. They pay much higher taxes and government determines if it's worth giving you major treatments. It's not all what you're being feed. But by all means drink the coolaid.

@vwbuglvr @cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Didn't knkw increasing the standard tax deduction for individuals from around $6000 to $12000 and for married couples from around $12000 to $24000 plus increasing the child tax credit from $1000 to $2000 was crumbs. By the way tax reform doesn't go into effect till next year ;)
@DAirschilde @vg2325 @KamalaHarris Perhaps you should research stockholders. Have you ever purchased stock? You can buy it now in walmart for around $50 a share. Employees get stock options at a discount. Corporations are owned by millions of stockholders. How do you think people invest in stock? Research it ;)
@vg2325 @KamalaHarris When corporations get tax cuts it gives working capital, which brings job creation, increased wages, and growth. Which drastically benefits the economy and purchase power. It's also raises wages through capital increase rather than artifically like minimum wage increase.
@vg2325 @KamalaHarris Boy, you bite that progressive progaganda bullet hard. The wealthy actually got zero tax cuts. Corporations cut a cut which are owned by stockholders ran by a board of directors. The middle class got a cut plus double the standard deduction. Plus increased child tax credits.
@cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris First thing you learn in business school, there's no such thing as a free lunch someones paying for it somewhere. In this case taxes are. Which that higher pay puts you into a higher tax bracket which means you pay more and that job pays less cause everyones got a college degree.
@cdahlgrd @KamalaHarris Ohh you'd be paying for it in elevated taxes, you'd be paying for it when your kids can't get jobs because the increased cost of production eliminates entry level jobs while they go to college with increased minimum wage and when that job pays less to pay entry level staff.

@Redtagu @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM That's because you're opinions are based off most European countries being Socialist, they're not. England's a Monarchy with a Parliament. Sweden and Denmark have a free market economy not a Socialist economy. Perhaps it's you that should research Socialism.
@Redtagu @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM It's not Conservatives claiming anything, it's facts based off actual data and records. I did construction for 15 years, am forth generation before becoming a certified activist and getting into politics. Most homes build we're Europeans moving here again fact.
@Redtagu @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM See you keep confusing fact with assumption. There has been zero proof of collusion. The Russian leaks in which indictment has came from Russian spy happened many years before the 2016 election. The only facts, DNC rigged primaries, Hillary and Obama sold Uranium to Russia.

@SybilleAbed @SenWarren @Jaelynne17 Romney consistently used his power to benefit himself, he isn't the only one Governor Rick Scott ripped off Medicaid for millions. Government controlled anything breeds corruption and failaure. Healthcare is no different. Find a better system yes, it government the answer, no.
@SybilleAbed @SenWarren @Jaelynne17 Romney hired his brother in law's company to do it, they cut corners to funnel money into their own pockets. The corners they cut are what caused the 60 ton slab to fall on that woman. I did Construction for over 15 years. Forth generation construction in Mass.
@Redtagu @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM Not really fair, nor equal, perhaps research the actual results of Socialism rather than just what leftist books and propaganda tell you.
@Redtagu @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM The great Socialized healthcare systems of Europe everyone wants, yet if you need a major medical treatment there the government chooses if you're worth having it. Many they deem aren't which is why when major treatment is needed many come here for it.
@Redtagu @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM I know exactly what Socialism is. They bank on words like Universal, Fairness, and Equality to sway on emotion in the end it all means Government control, Redistribution of wealth, which is the opposite of those words.
@carlasingleton1 @jeremyjgross @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM @marcorubio @FishbaughLea Are you talking about the party Obama bankrupt to the point they operated under Hillary's payroll buying her the primary? The party that preaches fairness while advocating taking from some and giving it to many? Or the party that their NM chairman advocated for Sexual Harassment?
@jimWest61345739 @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM See how you had no facts only failed insults? Straight out of the leftest manifesto, rules for radicals. When you actually have some facts get back to me. Until then you're the only one babbling ;)
@jimWest61345739 @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM Not nearly as much as the 67% of government spending on entitlements ;)
@Redtagu @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM Perhaps that's why I said "failed attempt at" perhaps you couldn't comprehend... Duh.
@cat803 @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM Their fair share is to cover the cost of the poor, that's an oxymoron in and of itself considering that very statement is the very opposite of fair but nice try at utilizing the leftest buzz word. I've read rules for radicals as well ;)
@jimWest61345739 @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM No I don't get my facts from the news, that's the lefts go to source. I get my facts from data, statistics, and economics books. The migration data speaks for itself which exactly why you have no argument other than sorry attempts at insults. Also a left go to ;)
@jimWest61345739 @NancyPelosi @DamonForNM Very intellectual of you, obviously you have zero facts nor a valid argument. Typical for those supporting wasteful spending.
@DennisOLeary50 @SenWarren @SenSanders I know the data and facts don't support your claim, I know that based off migration data and ratings for low tax states vs high tax states the low tax states out preform high tax states and I have data to support it. You obviously have none to support your claim.
@DennisOLeary50 @SenWarren @SenSanders Judgments against you do, ie forclosures due to not paying your bills, credit card judgments, eviction judgments, etc. You're speaking utter nonsense to support a failed argument based off zero facts. I can back my claims with migration data dating back to 1992. Can you?
@DennisOLeary50 @SenWarren @SenSanders Who's dying in this country due to lack of healthcare? Any emergency room in this country will treat you with no money paid, secondly you can't declare bankrupcy on medical bills so no one went backrupt from them, thirdly medical bills don't even show up when purchasing a home.
@RepRWilliams Says I can't message your profile.
@DennisOLeary50 @SenWarren @SenSanders It's why, when looking at in and out migration citizens are fleeing California for Texas. Which is why a Uhaul rental from Cali to Texas cost twice as much as one the opposite direction. It's because of so many one way trips to Texas form Cali.
@DennisOLeary50 @SenWarren @SenSanders Including your state of California, highest tax state, shortage on teachers, pay less to public services, and even with so rank horrible in education, unemployment, growth, and just about every other area. While Texas, low tax burden state out performs you in all categories.
@DennisOLeary50 @SenWarren @SenSanders Funny how the lowest tax states actually better fund public services... Hmm wonder why that is. The one service high tax states offer more of welfare workers because they need them.
@DennisOLeary50 @SenWarren @SenSanders It very much is socialized when everyone has to pay for it without choice and if they don't pay it they go to jail thus force. That's called government socialized healthcare and is the opposite of a free country. Every other country also isn't free, most lack even free speech ;)
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders Government is not the solution to social problems either, it simply isn't the proper role of government. That responsibility falls on the people not government.
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders It is an entitlement when they receive three times what they pay in. Perhaps research a little better.
@SenWarren @Jaelynne17 It's no surprise that Massachusetts supports these things when Obamacare was founded in the state guised as Romneycare. You know the Governor responsible for the big dig that dropped a 60 ton concrete slab on an elderly woman killing her instantly after Romney cut corners.
@SenWarren @Jaelynne17 You also have some of the highest taxes, unemployment, poor growth, and businesses in small towns closing their doors. I'm from Massachusetts and moved because of the poor economy and high taxes. Out of state migration leads to loss of revenue even with your elevated taxes.
@RepRWilliams Thank you for responding, that seems a rarity from elected officials these days. Much respect for taking the time to comment back. I'd like some more info on your bill. Can I private message you my email address?
@Ray_Phenicie @SenWarren @SenSanders The prices aren't rising because of lack of insured. The prices are rising because lack of competitiveness and the government writing checks under entitlements like Medicaid and Medicare, just like college tuitions increase since financial aid.
@reason @facebook @nickgillespie He's panicking because people are getting tired of Facebook. Tired of their censorship, tired of their heavily partisan bias, tired of senseless bans simply for "over using" features they make available to use. They've went from Facebook to Statistbook.
@RepRWilliams What spending are we going to cut to cover the cost? Let's start with entitlements!
@NancyPelosi @DamonForNM You mean the failed attempt at Socialized healthcare where the premiums quickly doubled?
@Ray_Phenicie @SenWarren @SenSanders Cost don't have to be high. Bring a more free market approach to healthcare and medical insurance, make them competitive. Right now there's no reason to be competitive when they can charge whatever they want and you don't know the cost till after treatment.
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders Perhaps look at more than just a income tax. The 11 lowest tax burden states since 92 have consistently outperformed the high tax states. California consistently has a horrible economy, horrible schools, and high unemployment while being the highest taxed state. Try again ;)
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders Gain skills to make more money, or actually research some economics. Minimum wage doesn't give you more of a living wage it traps more of the middle class into poverty. College tuition cost skyrocketed after federal aid came in, and anyone can get treatment at a hospital ;)
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders You do realize that top one percent already pay for most of our government spending? 67% plus goes to entitlements by the way. So all those social programs are already paid for by that 1% not by the left nor the middle class. But yeah there the bad guys though right?
@DennisOLeary50 @SenWarren @SenSanders Because that's a very intellectual response. That's why a Socialistic agenda never floats your argument is I'm right so go away rather than fact.		Fact: Entitlements make up over 67% of government spending and are mostly responsible for the national debt ;)

@MartinHeinrich @pamnmdolphin @JECDems Why do the lowest tax burden states consistently out preform high tax burden states in education, public services, increased income, tax revenue, job creation, and growth? Because low tax burdens increase economic prosperity. Research migration data!
@MartinHeinrich @pamnmdolphin @JECDems What about the more money in paychecks the working Americans are getting nationwide? What about the millions of bonuses given out? What about the increase in hourly wages across the board in many companies without the minimum wage scam?
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders If you love it so much why not move there? Yet ironically many of them are moving here. If you follow in and out migration data just here in the states. People consistently migrate into low tax burden states and migrate out of high tax states. Thus more revenue, job creation, etc
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders Wrong, that's still government picking winners and losers and doesn't change anything. Giving government more control leads to tyranny and dictatorship. It's the very reason we broke away from England in the first place. Over taxation.
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders Why because they worked hard, took risks, gained skills to make themselves wealthy so they should have to support those who don't? Rather than fix a broken system let's make the wealthy pay instead. Because that's fairness, that's equality right?
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders Not to mention they also have higher state revenue than those high tax states, and it's remained that way since 1992/93 tax year. You know what those higher tax burden states have more of? Welfare employees and higher unemployment... Hmm wonder why that is.
@Cameron_CAW @SenWarren @SenSanders And were the only country that doesn't have 40% income tax and freedom of speech, freedom of expression, etc. Taxes aren't the way to do it either. Funny how the lowest tax burden states have more teachers, better fund public services, and a thriving economy than high tax states.

@SenWarren @SenSanders No we don't need Medicare for all, we don't need more entitlements, and we don't need more wasteful spending. We need a comprehensive solution to lowering the cost of medical treatment to affordable levels. Healthcare, the only industry void of a free market. Thus why it suffers.

@florabelle444 @cnni How long do you think it takes to open a gun safe when you know the combination on a digital keypad? How long do you think it takes to remove a trigger lock? In most cases you will hear a individual attempting to get into your home well before they actually get in.

@b_qmb @KantBreal @cnni Funny the UK who has extensive gun control over the last year watched as gun violence increased over 23% because laws don't stop people from getting or using guns. Laws are words on paper and words can't stop actions.
