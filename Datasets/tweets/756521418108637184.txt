@realDonaldTrump You fired him, you didn't want him in your administration,  could you please move on! This is getting old!
@JackKingston Congressman Jack,  please!
@washingtonpost Of course he is!
@estellelevenda1 @JeffreyToobin @CNN And that Trump attorney,  he does that same thing!
@thehill Not going to work! Bye,  bye  republicans,  house and Senate.  2018 elections will be here soon!
@JeffreyToobin @CNN I'm proud to watch CNN, minus Jeffrey Lord and Kaylee
@thehill So! Who are they! They don't represent all Christians
@thehill They WILL loose in 2018 and 2020!
@washingtonpost Because people are tired
@JackKingston @MSNBC Come on Congressman Kingston, it's time for you to focus on things that's positive  please don't mess you your political  career   with this
@BLeeDrake @kylegriffin1 Thanks north Carolina
@kayleighmcenany @AndrewCMcCarthy Who really cares
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @washingtonpost This is getting old, can you tweet about health care,
@sahilkapur @alexburnsNYT Just talk,  he will vote yes
@newtgingrich Really?
@thehill His assignment is over!
@CNN And if you run in 2020 you have my vote and I'm a democrat!
@CNN I agree with you governor!
@thehill Gen Flynn has the real story!
@rendale @thehill @POTUS And they don't believe it!
@LuvLuchia @AnnCoulter Isn't he white?
@CNN So you think he's above the law?
@thehill OMG! How dear you! At a time like this!
@thehill He won't be
@thehill He is a retired marine general,  he is not  beholding to anyone,  not even President Trump! The few, the proud,  the Marines!
@thehill Comey is a Republican!
@Shermichael_ @realDonaldTrump Shut up!
@thehill Don't forget about Muller!
@donnabrazile Not worthy of a response,
@thehill So what are they?
@JohnKasich Thanks governor!
@thehill They should be!
@thehill What about people dieing with black lungs,  how can he support this?
@thehill It had a impact!
@realDonaldTrump Get a new line,  are we going to hear this for the next 4 heard
@HuffPostPol Deflecting!
@thehill And?
@GovMikeHuckabee Keep it Holy!
@politico @realDonaldTrump It will hurt his base.
@AC360 Why was Jason Miller fired by Trump campaign?
@washingtonpost I'm sorry, no disrespect to either,  but they are not the standard of powerful women
@tzjcomet @thehill And Pence!
@thehill Take several seats!
@thehill His days are numbered!
@JosephSNoble2 @_SamanthaRose_ @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Stupid ! Why such a harsh word?
@_SamanthaRose_ @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Agree! They are putting it on thick, and he's loving it
@thehill Did he forget,  a total and complete Muslim ban! He is the last person that can speak of good and evil!
@thehill Really,
@rawxe @thehill Yes, he wants his agenda passed,
@thehill I didn't expect anything less from them,
@BrookeBCNN @kayleighmcenany OMG!
@ChrisCuomo He was very defensive,  and angry,  sounds like he is afraid of this investigation!
@scottienhughes Are you kidding? You don't believe that yourself!
@JackKingston @JamesComeyFBI Yes
@thehill I am personally offended by YOU!
@joeydog410 @thehill I  agree
@thehill Ok, all due respect but is this news?
@thehill I am so disappointed in Mcmasters, I really expected more from him!
@JackKingston But POTUS said he did
@thehill We will see
@thehill That was then, this is now, Paul Ryan wants his agenda pass at any cost.
@thehill Yes, and that's why the GOP can't pass any legislation, to busy deflecting and lying. This is a mess!
@amandacarpenter Because Putin ask for it....
@joegilliam58 @JackKingston He was so uncomfortable reading that statement,  remind me of Spicer crowd size statement, did you notice McMaster body language?
@thehill Nothing will happen, remember,  he can shot someone in the middle of 5th ave and will not loose any support,  not even Ryan or mconnell.
@tvnewser @CNN @POTUS @donlemon @ChrisCuomo Thanks Don and Chris,,I love you both. Continue your good work.
@bells110 @AgeDemands @MarcBroc @tommyxtopher Now I agree
@GovMikeHuckabee I must admit,  she did a great job,  move over Spicie.
Time for a independent investigation!
@kayleighmcenany Not!
What goes on in the dark, will come to the light!
@kayleighmcenany Little girl, take several seats!
@kayleighmcenany Sorry, you are not the spokesperson for voters!
@realDonaldTrump They can't stop the FBI
@thehill Really? Go head and see how far you get, remember, what goes around comes around, if you don't believe it,  ask Gen. Flynn,
@thehill What the what!
@thehill He can not  change history,  he doesn't have the power,  it just shows how vindictive he is!
@thehill How? She's been M.I.A.
@CNN Why rush?
@ILegalAlien2012 @thehill Don't forget...and 2020!
@thehill Focus,  and get off Twitter !
@danmericaCNN @Kevinliptakcnn It's ok, and expected, not surprised at all
@washingtonpost What the what!

@PhoenixRisingSt @thehill @SpeakerRyan Yes, I think this is the end for Ryan
@lsmith677_lauri @thehill She has no ideal a about issues that women have! Stop it!
@thehill And she suppose to be the champion for women? NOT!
@thehill Bye bye Devin
@thehill She doesn't speak for women!
@JackKingston @FoxNews Good for him!
@thehill No one cares
@JackKingston @DailyCaller That's not true
@thehill Please stop! Of all things to say. When  are the Dems going to speak life and not death, speak positive and not negative.  Really Keith
@andreastonez @daveweigel I agree
@JackKingston @BarackObama Obama is no longer the president,  he is enjoying life, and so should you!
@CNN Oh No! R.I.P Cuba Gooding Sr.  I grew up on Main Ingredients.  "Everybody plays a fool"
