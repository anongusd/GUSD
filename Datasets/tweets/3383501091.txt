@realDonaldTrump Hmmmm what is the COMMON DENOMINATOR here? Everyone who is a faulure is connected to ONE thing DONALD J TRUMP.  Trump is central to the failure of the US. 		LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 		NO TRUMP IN 2020
@realDonaldTrump Just Like You

@realDonaldTrump Anyone who can read can find "shreds of evidence",  so BULL SHIT
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Nope
@realDonaldTrump Too bad it is not your original idea
@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump You forgot Trump steaks
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Must be nice in your world.
@realDonaldTrump Oh I forget about the illions lost from the government shutdown
@realDonaldTrump Hmmmm just like a wall?
@realDonaldTrump Wow so many lies from a delusional man who thinks he matters.
@realDonaldTrump LOL...
@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to the day when the truth comes out I'm just curious to see how you going to lie your way out of it
@realDonaldTrump I'm in the process of finding a country who honors and respects their citizens and the president of that country doesn't mistreat the people like Donald j Trump...
@realDonaldTrump of course it will be a good situation we have either a senile old man that is out of touch with reality or an infantile child in office who is throwing tantrums over a f****** wall you're not worth my time
@YusufnotYufus @qanon76 @realDonaldTrump 8000 known lies in one year...	I guess we better learn Spanish.... (This would have been LOL but I am tired of this).
@qanon76 @realDonaldTrump Promise made	Promise kept	Court case lost	Trump ho bye bye...he will get four walls with security bars and everything...yeah Trump enjoy your weekend....
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Hey Ed too bad the people of America couldn't declare a state of emergency....
@realDonaldTrump Poor little rich boy will learn the power of NO
@senatemajldr God forbid you don't get YOUR pay check....of course you don't want anything to get in the way of funding your pay....I mean the government.		Meanwhile underpaid and under appreciated military are being shafted by YOUR president.

@VP @POTUS Great NO MORE SHUTDOWN THREATS would be nice
@EdKrassen Don't you mean a desperate man trying to get a county to continue supporting him? Typical High school speech from a man trying to get the popular vote...
@Kokomothegreat @realDonaldTrump Immaturity is found in children swearing because they have nothing interesting or intelligent to say.
@realDonaldTrump @jacknicklaus @TigerWoods I guess the US is. It as Important as your beloved golf game. If Trump shuts down the government again  he needs to be Impeached
@EdKrassen I am with you ED
@Lrihendry @speedprayers You are just as bad as he is ... 		He lied well over 8,000 times	Is a disgusting womanizer	Is grossly inmature	But most importantly he DOESN'T HAVE THE PEOPLE'S BEST INTERESTS. the only reason he read up in the government is because he already knows that he can't win.
@RepMaxineWaters Representative Waters we get it...the House and Senate need to do their part now. I was with Al Green when he first submitted Articles of Impeachment. Present them ... When we will get a 2/3 affirmation... Then he will get 4 walls for free... Prison walls
@realDonaldTrump Fake news again? The lady who was burned by McDonald's coffee was fake news it destroyed the truth. It is not fake news when verified facts are reported
@realDonaldTrump Intel team and Trump don't compute... oxymoron if I have heard one.
@realDonaldTrump How in the world can you offer American Support when the people of the United States do not support you?
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @foxandfriends Trump needs to be Court Ordered to live on $750.00 per month for three months... Then nothing for 2 months to understand his actions.
@emrazz @vandersonauthor It is terrible what happened to the women in the bank... But the emasculation demonstrated in the commercial you speak of has it's hand in the problem. #Equalityforall
@EdKrassen That's just like a Trump supporter... Blowing everything out of proportion and being over dramatic to deflect from the truth.
@realDonaldTrump Trump you screwed up the tax code so bad income tax benefit. I depended on my education credit with you cancelled. I feel powerless...OH WAIT IM A VOTER
@krassenstein Brian Don't you mean Let's truly Make America Great Again?

@realDonaldTrump People don't listen to liars
@realDonaldTrump @RepMaxineWaters @WhiteHouse @impeachdtnow At the end of Feburary over 2/3rds of the population in the US will not have access to food. Hungry people are voters, and do not forget who put them there. REOPEN the Government and #ImpeachTrump
@senatemajldr get your head out of the sand Mitch and open the government
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Security will be restored when Trump is impeached. I think Trump's obsession with the wall is his fear of the future where he will sit behind walls 4 All the evil that he has done... you know, PRISON WALLS
@GOPLeader SOTU should NOT HAPPEN since the Union being addressed DOES NOT appear to be open... REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT NOW. #WheresMitch 	Hungry people don't listen very well especially during an election year.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Oh Ok that's nice NOW REOPEN OUR GOVERNMENT SO THAT WILL MEAN SOMETHING
@krassenstein OH and Brian, do not forget the 44 million who will not receive their benefits next month...if the Idiot and Chief continues the shutdown...I wonder what would happen if we IGNORED Trump and did not give him the attention that his Narcicism craves?
@StopTrump2020 @realDonaldTrump I wake up every morning, check the news feed to see if @realDonaldTrump has been impeached, indicted, or has resigned. I check my feed several times a day. Sad Times
@realDonaldTrump 44,960,000 people will not have sufficient food unless you reopen the government. WITH NO FOOD PEOPLE GET RUDE...Those people who will go without food have familes, and those families have familes, and so on. No Food, No Voter Base, NO TRUMP@impeachdtnow @StopTrump2020
@realDonaldTrump It's nice that you're recognizing the president of Venezuela but open our damn government
@mike_pence OPEN MY GOVERNMENT NOW.
@IvankaTrump That's nice OPEN MY GOVERNMENT NOW

@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Apparently you have no concept of real life 	Real life comprehends that one does not always get whatever one wants. There is a time and a place when a leader says... I need to find a way to elevate the US Economy so the revenue for the wall is available.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump CC YOU ARE AN IDIOT. 		Go back to January 17 press conference with Pelosi and compare Trump's Plan to reopen the government released today. Pay attention to the term "technology"... Then you will see why your statement is idiotic.
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Wait s minute...what was the problem somewhere between 2016 and 2018 when a government official used Federal resources for personal use? Although I can't remember the name, he is in trouble. Maralago was built because Trump was blocked from joining any other clubs. Typical Trump
@realDonaldTrump Because a President put her in danger. I am reserving additional comments until I see results from "Trump's Plan to reopen the Government".		Holding My Peace
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse OH and if America falls, because of this shutdown, there will be no one to bail anyone out...You will actually have to learn how to live on nothing at all. The only difference between you and me is that I am respected for what I believe. You...Well, your hated.
@EdKrassen My hand is up...but you cannot see it. 	You are completely Correct
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse There is no humanitarian crisis on the border, you are a liar Donald Trump. You need to be impeached. That is the only humanitarian crisis that I am concerned with--Your Impeachment YOU NEED TO OPEN THE GOVERNMENT NOW
@realDonaldTrump We will make America great again when you get impeached. I am looking forward to the day when I get to tell you YOU'RE FIRED!
@impeachdtnow Finally impeachment talks are heating up. Keep up the good fight
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump LOL BRIAN ...
@realDonaldTrump Impeachment talks are heating up
@Franklin_Graham We took God out and replaced H work Trump..	 You are not your father
According to CNN and Wall Street Journal Michael Cohen paid thousands to rig polls in Trump's favor.... Trump reimbursed him.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump CC you are a moron. We don't need a wall because there's no threat. Pardon the pun, but the fear-mongering is all trumped up. Oh wow I actually found a way I can use that.
@outofcontroljb @EdKrassen @krassenstein WELL SAID
@realDonaldTrump Hey idiot border breaches have dropped by nearly 73% since the previous Republican who screwed up this Government WITHOUT A WALL you are a liar and need to be stopped Now.
@realityrose @EdKrassen @DanReynolds Not all of us
@EdKrassen Well Ed God builds Bridges not walls. Those who endorse government shutdowns and a complete idiots. Simple test Christian means like Christ. I guess they fail the test.
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump LOL HAMBERDERS... 		I am going to order some HAMBERDERS next time.
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Excellent poin Brian

@realDonaldTrump Have you ever stop to think that maybe they don't like their job because they have to deal with you idiot
@realDonaldTrump LOL 		WE'RE NOT THAT STUPID TRUMP		laughed so hard I have to change my clothes.....LOL
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Working hard to destabilize the government....pull your head out and realize what you're supporting
@realDonaldTrump Nope Now you're doing business while the government is shut down?  Great so blatently like Hitler
@realDonaldTrump Yes you're right since it is obvious to 87 percent of Americans are completely convinced that you have been working with Russia to to destabilize my Country.
@realDonaldTrump For once I agree with you. I bet that would be a pretty picture
@realDonaldTrump Donald you are an idiot! The border crisis is in your mind. That means that you are mentally obsessed with this. Because you're mentally obsessed with this I'm wondering about your fitness to be in office. Back off the damn wall
@krassenstein @KrassenCast Let your brother hug you
@realDonaldTrump They can solve the government shutdown... SOLUTION: IMPEACHMENT
@realDonaldTrump Safety and Security? Hungry, angry unpaid and intimidated slave labor, (that is Govt. Workers) are neither. Let's see what else... Nuclear destruction by North Korea, Russian collusion, TSA quits... Are these safety or security?
@realDonaldTrump Awe Trump even abuses the men he seeing... Ah but Putin would not put up with Trump's lies... That's saying something.		.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump CC only 22 % want a wall... the rest of us want our country back. It is difficult for me to say this, but it would be better for people to believe in nothing than to sell their soul to Donald
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke Agreed Ed
@millgift333 You are out of context
@realDonaldTrump Quit Fearmongering. You probably ran for office to get the he post term payroll for the rest of your life. You spoke on May 21, 2004 about a wall, and not giving up... But do what it takes to get to the other side... Why waste the money when you tell people go around it.
RT @Alyssa_Milano: Trump in his own words about what to do when a wall is in your way.  https://t.co/A4oYIw3Xt1
@realDonaldTrump Sorry I didn't not believe you. It's his favorite Sound bite because it's true and describes your true character
@realDonaldTrump Sorry NOPE You threw a tantrum, banged your fists on the table and stormed out... My children don't even do that.
@realDonaldTrump Let's do the math	58% hold Trump Responsible for the Shutdown	20 % hold Republicans Responsible	That's 78%	22% hold Dem's, only 22% hold Dem's responsible. 	America will Recover in November 5 2019
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump No Ed let him keep it closed until his entire political carreer is completely destroyed....then we will  make sure that he never runs again.
@realDonaldTrump Nope that will not solve the shutdown. You growing up will do	It. You do realize that the people 2 voted you in are getting ready to vote you out in 2020 because you lied.
@realDonaldTrump You are destroying MY home Country. Impeachment would be a victory... But your resignation would really show them Dems... We are Americans, we will survive, but your resignation would really screw up their representation.
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump why do you have to keep talking about Russia if you haven't done anything wrong? We already know you're a liar so anything you say we think the opposite so why don't you tell the truth for once and see what really happened to idiot

@aprilsdiva @realDonaldTrump LOL EXACTLY
@realDonaldTrump There are things I want to say that are halted by my Christian Witness. But I can say Trump is in the wrong business. He would make real money in farming. After all, every time he opens his mouth he spreads so much fertilizer he could feed the world, but he won't too selfish
@Ivlogo06 @realDonaldTrump LOL oh lvlogo oh how true that US Citizens are more likely to encroach on or vandalize American property. My family immigrated from Germany before Tru.... I mean Hitler  came into power... We were never assulted by other immigrants but those who did not want us and we're legal.
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump @williamlegate Well said.
@realDonaldTrump It's funny that Trump speaks of the Obama's as genuine human beings when it suits him. If You believe in this wall put your own money NOT TAXPAYERS MONEY into it. It would be Your monument. Unless you have not been truthful about your own finances.
@VoteOjeda2020 You know Trump has absolutely no connection with real people. You, Mr. Ojeda, put your life on the line for the protection of freedom.  Trump only desired liberty for himself alone. #VoteOjeda2020
@amahnke Aaron, she's an idiot
@VoteOjeda2020 Time to clear out the Oval Nursery and return it to an office for Ojeda, a real leader
@EdKrassen I am a Christian, and to be honest Ed, I have no clue. Unless one could say, and one can, real Christians would do as Christ would do.	The rest would be Chillul Hashem and therefore not Christian at all.
