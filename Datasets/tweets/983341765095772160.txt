JJ.  You’re the GOAT https://t.co/irKhtMp09a
Your response is pathetic. For a @skyteam Elite Plus, @delta Diamond and @Saudi_Airlines Business class passenger, it is unbelievable that you take no responsibility for it delayed flight that cost me 1000 Euros. https://t.co/3DOULC5HDa
@millenniumcdg stayed 2 nights. Worst stay ever. They discriminate against #disabled #disabilities
I filled in your form and I’m awaiting your response https://t.co/FdPB0zahKR
That’s it?  You are making a bad situation worse. https://t.co/VxE8E1u6ME
@Saudi_Airlines @CDG Absolutely horrible service on SV127 on 15 November. @CDG Assistance could not get me to @aegeanairlines in 3 hours for connecting flight. Disgraceful. #disability #disabled
@AeromexicoUSA Absolutely horrible experience on AM7 MEX LHR on 11 November. Purser refused any service due to me being #disabled. Disgraceful.
The guys at #GeorgetownPrep had no problem finding Halloween costumes this year. Most popular was a drunk guy called #TheKavanaugh.
That’s called a Kavanaugh! https://t.co/wI1Od1FGlA
@Marriott and @CourtyardHotels. Great commercials on #goldenrule using #signlanguage.
@KLM It was bad in Amsterdam last night but it’s worse at ORD today. I will file a complaint with DOT in addition to 2 complaints. I’m a Skyteam Elite Plus. Horrible treatment
Terrible experience at @ord with @KLM   Already waiting over 1 hour for wheelchair. #disabled #handicapped @dot https://t.co/phHmRrhBd7
Not a good experience with @klm at ORD today. Waited over an hour already for a wheelchair and someone to push me. # handicapped # disabled. Ridiculous to wait so long
RT @HuffPost: "If you’ve never dated a disabled person, ask yourself why not? Examine your biases, examine your prejudices." https://t.co/D…
Thanks. Over 80% of hemophiliacs my age died as a result. https://t.co/csRklE9Zl0
On the opposing view,  I’m a hemophiliac who survived Hepatitis C and HIV due to inadequate blood screening. https://t.co/jGL8882XI3
@KLM Terrible experience at Amsterdam Schiphol tonight. No wheelchair for me at the gate. Flight crew left me stranded ( I’m #handicapped) at the gate. Disgraceful.
The ends don’t justify the means. https://t.co/Mj2dq8cOHi
Justification https://t.co/UmTFfp7Pk8
@Tokyo_gov The Japan Customs agents were rude and treated me in a demeaning way. I won’t return to Japan and plan to remove all my companies businesses due to the humiliation of #disabled people
@Tokyo_gov I’m handicapped and I flew into Yokohama on 27 September. The Japan Customs spent over 2 hours removing everything from my bags only to find some beef jerky. They even tested my Parkinson’s medications. It was humiliating and degrading.
This is the 1%er’s equivalent of killing their parents and throwing themselves on the mercy of the court because they’re orphans! https://t.co/Ra1cEzLwKa
Why is Kavanaugh not withdrawing? https://t.co/TBInew042s
I guess he forgot due to a blackout! https://t.co/Yg9iPfXZ73
Ford should too! https://t.co/8RIRgW5J3Z
Ya think?  Duh? https://t.co/5sMfsjxYnq
By definition it’s getting illegitimate or illegally earned money in to the legal banking system https://t.co/Fiw6GSe6xJ

One can only dream of the holes in Kavanaugh’s schtick that can be unearthed in only a week. Thank goodness for the internet! https://t.co/ct9Xwe355l
He would be a class of 1 at Georgetown Prep https://t.co/gUNUnh21Pc
I’m not sure that’s who they should be comparing him to. https://t.co/kt1ch1lJxj
It’s not that complicated. See the movie Wag the Dog. https://t.co/Cbs5ATycBV

@skyteam Keep up the great work!
@JYSexton That’s the trifecta ( in a horrible way) for Republicans. Don’t forget it when voting in the mid terms!

Very disappointing experience on Ethiopian Airlines at LHR 9 Sept. I’m disabled. Could not get assistance. Staff laughed at me and refused to help me.
@airfrance. Very disappointing experience at SEZ Airport. Waited over 90 minutes for a wheelchair. Mgr on duty refused to assist me.
@Delta I hope you continue to expand your partnerships globally. It’s working good for a Diamond. @Delta gets my business as a result
Great experience with @Delta and @KoreanAir_KE connecting at @seoul today. Cuddos @Delta and @KoreanAir_KE
