@Thomas1774Paine @USAlovesTrumpz The KJV has 150 verses that persecute heathens (e.g. "heathen redskins", native Americans).  What happened to them can be found in the KJV.  Google "heathens" in the bible, it is a blue print of what happened in American history. @RoystonPotter
@Thomas1774Paine @USAlovesTrumpz The King James Bible is a racist manual.  In the early days of the protestant church, the royal court of King James switched the word "Gentile" for the word "heathen" which made the bible teach that being a heathen was an abomination. Those who did not follow Jesus were heathens.
