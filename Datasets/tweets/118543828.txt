It's really exciting and everything but Point Noah can get a little nerve-wracking quickly
That first quarter between the Grizzlies and Bulls looked exactly what you would expect from teams jockeying for the bottom of the standings. And, we're tied at 20 after one.
Bulls getting in Grizzlies passing lanes, causing five turnovers in the first quarter. Chicago also has a handful of blocks. And with Grizz shooting 25 percent in the quarter, a Chicago 20-16 lead is not surprising.
Valanciunas still checking his chiclets after taking a shot to the mouth on the first Bulls possession.
Pyro on Wednesday for the Bulls. I didn't jump. Officials didn't jump. But I'm told by a reliable source that the ones to watch are the crowd. Lot of bounce when those things go off.

For those of you who want insight to where the Grizzlies are regarding trades, the use of Bruno and other factors, you have plenty of time during your lunch hour to read @HerringtonNBA 's latest dispatch @dailymemphian 		https://t.co/6jZefDEr48
Ok. That's it. That's all. Grizzlies snap an 8-game slide. Gasol kisses Conley. 		For in-depth coverage of game, I direct you to @HerringtonNBA 's work @dailymemphian 		I would close down the press room, but @DavidWCobb is still writing.		Good night from Memphis
Bruno Caboclo, playing his second game after signing a 10-day contract with Memphis this week, had 11 points, on 3 of 4 from 3-point range.
"When you start losing, everything is bad. Your body starts to hurt and everything is negative. When you’re winning, you walk out the arena feeling good, you can go home and be happy around your family and things like that.” -- Mike Conley
A lot of talk postgame about the Marc Gasol smooch on Mike Conley's cheek as Conley was interviewed by @thefishnation . "Because I love him," Gasol said when asked about it.		"I'm not use to that. I don't know if it's a European, Catalan, Spanish thing.  I don't know." -- Conley
Well, it's been awhile, so let's do some notes and quotes as the Grizzlies get only their second win since defeating the Cavaliers the day after Christmas.		And, no, the streamers after victories didn't seem too dusty
Joakim calls bank on his dunk
The number of mascots showing up to celebrate Grizz's ever changing birth day is decreasing annually.
It sure looked like Jaren Jackson Jr. cleared some space in advance of that reverse dunk.
And your officials for the Grizzlies vs. Pacers.... Tony Broth (ah, just kidding)		Kane Fitzgerald, Tre Maddox and (paging @badunclep ) Natalie Sago
Your starters for tonight's Grizz Vs. Pacers Game: INDY: Bojan Bogdanovic, Thaddeus Young, Myles Turner, Darren Collison and Tyreke Evans (for Oladipo). Grizz start Mike, Marc, Holiday, JJJ and w/Kyle Anderson, Dillon Brooks, Garrett Temple and Omri Casspi out, Jevon Carter
While I was driving to FedExForum, the Grizzlies, who already declared Garrett Temple out for tonight's game against the Pacers, said the forward will be out 1-2 weeks with a mild left shoulder sprain suffered in last night's loss to Sacramento

If you're still up, and by golly I am, I invite you to read a recap of the Grizzlies-Kings game where a late call that goes against Memphis provides another bad break in the Grizzlies losing streak. Reporting way too late past midnight...Me.		https://t.co/JES0V0J8xy
@Cu11enM @ChrisVernonShow Nope. Sorry. To my knowledge, the request wasn't made.
On inbounds plays, Dave Joerger still calls out a player to do something that is not a part of the play. "Get a back pick, Buddy." And the ball goes to the other side of the floor.
Per Grizz PR, Garrett Temple is not returning after a left shoulder injury in the first half
Let's just say it doesn't take rookie refs long to learn the annoying "didn't make the shot, call a foul" routine
Assist @HerringtonNBA
And now two fouls on Marc Gasol. So he and and Jaren Jackson Jr. are guarding the Grizzlies bench.
Former Grizz coach Dave Joerger just asked the officiating crew to let the teams play a little bit without interruption from whistles. Six fouls in 5 minutes. 	"We're gonna be here all night." -- Joerger
And Jaren Jackson Jr. heads to the bench with two early fouls. It took 4-plus minutes tonight
We have a late change to the Kings starters. Iman Shumpert is starting in place of Bogdan Bogdanovic
And your officials for Grizz V Kings: Tony Brothers, Kevin Cutler, Phenizee Ransom.		I haven't seen @badunclep , so he could be evaluating this talent from his bunker. And, based on the other crowd at FedExForum, a lot of others are evaluating this from home too

Several Pistons believed game clock didn't start in a timely manner on the Grizzlies' last possession of the first quarter with 1.8 seconds left and looked at the stat crew to blame. Let it be known that Jose Calderon apologized to said crew for the misdirected blame
No one knew Jon Leuer entered the game, so there was no reaction to his return. Which means it WAS better than then boos for Blake Griffin in the starting lineup intros
This early timeout brought to you by Pistons coach Dwane Casey, a 10-5 Grizzlies lead and 4 of 6 from the field for Memphis
@MSF10710 I thought about it for a long time before jumping out there.
I could be wrong here, but I'm going out on a limb and say the Memphis crowd's welcome for Jon Leuer's return will be much more friendly than Blake Griffin's introduction during the starting lineups.
And your officials for Grizz vs. Pistons -- Pat Fraher, Derrick Collins, Marat Kogut.		I'm betting @badunclep has a New Year's Resolution of not complaining about NBA officiating. And like all resolutions, it should be broken by the second quarter at the latest

Ok. That's it. That's all. Grizzlies win. Conley leads scoring. Noah makes a successful debut.		Time to close the press room.		Good night from Memphis
There was a time the Clippers-Grizzlies rivalry was among the most intense in the NBA. But a lot of the main characters in that situation -- Zbo, CP3, Blake -- are gone. “It was just a bunch of guys, who didn’t like each other “That’s always nice. …in sports.”  -- Doc Rivers
Harris drew a tech after removing his headband in frustration. "I was just upset that I had missed my layup," he said. "...(R)egardless, I guess I can't take my headband off."  Full disclosure, that headband removal was slung a long way toward the Clippers bench.
Regarding the physical play in the game, Tobias Harris said: "The thing about it is, going into the game, we knew they were going to bring that type of physicality and that type of energy. "
Clippers forward Tobias Harris, who averages 21.6 points a game, finished with 7 points, missing his first 10 shots in the game through three quarters. "I had shots that I normally make, and they just didn't fall," Harris said. "I just couldn't get in a rhythm."
"It was fun playing alongside him for once because I've always been the recipients of all his screens and getting hit." -- Mike Conley on the addition of reserve center Joakim Noah, who played 13 minutes in his Grizzlies debut an scored four points and grabbed 3 rebounds
Memphis outscored Los Angeles 50-30 in the paint and held an 18-9 edge in fast break points.
Conley led Grizz scorers with 22 points, connecting on 9 of 16 shots. JaMychal Green added 19 points and 11 rebounds, recording his first double-double of the season.
Speaking of Marc Gasol and Mike Conley, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said: "Both are geniuses on the floor. You know that they are going to execute well."
"It was the Grizzlies. They just defended us well. This is the first night that I can say that we got our butts kicked." Clippers coach Doc Rivers said, adding: "Everything was too fast. Too quick. We turned the ball over, just bad turnovers. We couldn't even run a 4-on-1 break."
The Grizzlies caused 19 Clippers turnovers and Los Angeles connected on only 33.8 percent of its shots -- a season-low percentage for a Memphis opponent
Hey, let's put together some notes and quotes from the Grizzlies 96-86 win over the Clippers.		It was a season-low scoring for the Clippers, who had been held under 100 points only once -- in the season-opener when they scored 98 against Denver

Ok. That's it. That's all. 		Grizzlies blow another double-digit lead in the second half &amp; lose to Toronto -- the NBA's best team.		Time to close the press room, but @peteredmiston still acting like he's working with his headphones in. I'm leaving anyway.		Goodnight from Memphis
And we'll give the final word of the night to Grizz forward @Jmyke1 -- "We were up 17 points in this game. We can't give away the lead like that. Just got to find ways to keep that lead and step on their necks."
The Raptors 122 points was the most given up by the Grizzlies. Toronto also managed to eclipse other standards for Grizzlies opponents this season. Most 3-pointers (18), Shot the highest FG percentage (60.9) and highest 3-point percentage (54.5 percent)
Seven Grizzlies reached double figures -- Gasol with 27, Conley with 20, JaMychal and Kyle Anderson with 13, Temple with 12 and Shelvin Mack and Omri Casspi with 10 each. That was a season-high for Grizzlies scoring at least 10
The Grizzlies scored 114 points marking the first time this season they lost while scoring at least 110
Ahh, and the bad stat of the night -- not only did the Grizzlies surrender a double-digit second-half lead and lose, the 17 points squandered to the Raptors was the worst blown lead of the season in a loss
Jaren Jackson Jr. became the fourth player in NBA history with at least 250 points, 20 steals, and 40 blocks in first 20 career games. The other three were David Robinson, Bill Walton and Patrick Ewing.  Thanks to the Grizz PR staff for that one.
Despite Memphis holding a 71-59 lead at halftime, the pace was not favoring the Grizz.  "“I felt like we didn’t play defense at all,” Shelvin Mack said. “Even in the first half,  …Scoring 71 points, you get kind of disguised about how bad we were defensively.”
"We know I haven't been shooting the ball well. That's no secrect. So to get back on track a little is always fun. To come from behind when you're putting in so much effort, it takes a lot out of you to climb out of a hole like that." -- Raptors guard Fred VanVleet
The Raptors erased a 17-point Memphis lead early in the third quarter, primarily by converting 10 of 17 3-pointers in the second half, including 7 of 12 in the 4th. Fred VanVleet finished with 18 points, including making all six of his shots -- 3 from outside the arc in the 4th
We will start our notes and quotes w/ a word from former Grizz Kyle Lowry. "Memphis is still my home &amp;my heart. I still got love for the people here, love for the organization. It's still a special place for me, &amp; I really enjoy coming back here every time."
Here you go, @Rebelyell22 https://t.co/kqXsPU03RA

Grizzlies have thrown things into reverse...Have at least three reverse layups in the first half. Memphis leads David Fizdale and the Knicks 41-29 midway through 2Q. Grizz shooting 53 percent thus far
David Fizdale just thought: "I wish the hell I had never taught Marc Gasol to shoot the 3-pointer."
Let's get this out of the way, right now -- If this comes down to a one-possession game in the closing seconds with the Knicks trailing and taking the ball out, I would prefer Gasol not guarding the 3-point shooter at the horn this time.
Nice warm reception for Fizdale when he was introduced as coach of the Knicks.

Fizdale also referenced the story from the summer about Gasol rescuing migrants off the coast of Libya in the Mediterranean Sea. “This guy pulled a migrant out of the ocean this summer. That’s way more important than a basketball beef.” -- Fizz
As for the drama with Grizz star Marc Gasol before Fiz's departure, the Knicks coach said “That’s not going to be a story any more for you guys.”  He said the pair talked over the summer and the discussion took the edge off the issue.
Fizdale said the parking spot issue wasn't the only change he had to address.  "I didn’t even know which metal detector to walk through. All of that stuff was backwards for me.” -- Fizz
Former Grizzlies coach David Fizdale -- now at the Knicks helm -- acknowledged it was weird pulling into FedExForum for a game for the first time since he was fired a year ago. "I pulled in and I’m like ‘Okay, I’m not parking in my spot.’ J.B. in my damn spot.”

With the win, Grizz now have 11 wins, half the total of the 2017-18 season. And, if that isn't enough of a surprise, think about this -- the Grizzlies are tied for the best winning percentage in the West (with Portland and the Clippers). A long way from last season.
"That's what Memphis is all about. They have been like that for years." -- Mavericks guard Dennis Smith Jr., who led Dallas with 19 points and five assists.
The final play in the 10-point Memphis rally came after @KyleAnderson5 missed a 3-pointer, but recovered as Luka Donci headed downcourt. He picked Doncic pocket and scored on a dunk to put the game away for good
The game had 17 lead changes and 15 ties, the last one coming at 84-all with 5:41 to play. Memphis then scored 10 straight points, including consecutive 3-pointers by @mconley11 and @GTemp17 giving Memphis a 94-84 lead
"I think a lot of teams are so used to things being easy, nobody really wants to play defense. Everybody wants to get up &amp; down &amp; shoot 3s. So, when they come upon a team that gets into you &amp; is physical and actually plays defense, it’s a different game for them." -- Mike Conley
With the 98-88 win, the Grizzlies became the first team this season to hold the Dallas Mavericks under 100 points. Dallas also shot 34 percent for the game, also a season-low
Hey, we've got a little time until @HerringtonNBA post his thorough recap @dailymemphian , so let's do some notes and quotes.

By the way, someone not named Marc Gasol now has a rebound for the Grizzlies. JJJr. with one.
Gasol goes out and Carlisle immediately sends DeAndre Jordan in.
The poor shooting by both the Grizzlies and Mavs (6 of 22 overall) has allowed Marc Gasol to have all 7 of the Memphis rebounds in the games first 6 minutes.
Doncic starts 0-4 from the field. 		The Grizzlies and Mavs are a combined 5 of 17 to start the game.

Memphis can't shake Yale. Lead has never reached double digits.  The Bulldogs seem to creep back within  striking distance each time the Tigers take the advantage to 7 or 8 points.		Memphis up 71-67 with 7:20 left
Yale is 5 of 6 from 3-point range, allowing the Bulldogs to build a 23-16 lead.
Weatherman/wrestling color commentator @davebrown5555 makes the kiss cam at he Tigers game with his wife, Margaret . Stand Up, Lakeland.
Mike Parks Jr. makes an immediate impact with a pair of baskets, but Yale converts a pair of 3- pointers and the Bulldogs carry a 14-12 lead into the first media timeout. 14.43 left in the first half.
The Memphis pressure defense already has caused three Yale turnovers in the first 3 minutes. Memphis, however, has not capitalized on the Bulldogs miscues. 4-3 Yale

Ok. That’s it. That’s all. Gasol grabs record rebounds. JJ Jr. has strong night.	ZBo and Coach Dave come in town for a visit.	Time to close down the press room.	Goodnight from Memphis
Jackson on Gasol getting the rebounding record: "I didn't know what was happening until I asked somebody. ...When I found out, I thought that is a big deal. He's such a humble dude, it's probably going in one ear and out the other. I'll remind him tomorrow.."
Grizz roookie @jarenjacksonjr had a season-high (and, of course, career high) 27 points on 11 of 16 shooting.  "It just comes from running the floor and just making yourself open." On whether the quick start fueled him  "I think when you can feel it early, it gives you confidence
Joerger continued: "Two and a half hours you go out there and compete as athletes, then you hug on each other, love on each other and wish each other's families the best. "
"I speak well of the Grizzlies. To my guys -- the older guys, the vet guys -- they'r e so classy. They're the kind of guys that will put they arms around young guys." -- Dave Joerger
RT @MarcGasol: FAMILY https://t.co/iqVBEs8t6p
“It had a little more motivation,” Gasol said of breaking the record in front of Randolph. “I wish he was on the floor, but I’m just happy he was watching.”
“It means I’ve been here a long time,” Gasol said laughingly deflecting talk of the record. “If you play long enough and you’re lucky enough, you’re probably going to get some of those.”
Let's do some notes and quotes. Marc Gasol -- in case you didn't hear -- passed his old teammate Zach Randolph as Grizz all-time leading rebounder. Gasol got the record w/a season-high 15. Meanwhile, Zbo, decked out in a suit, saw Gasol break the record from the Kings bench

Grizz are 5-0 at home, the only Western Conf. team undefeated at home. The start is only the second time in franchise history the Grizzlies began a season undefeated at home after the five games. (8-0 to start the 2014-15 season). Shoutout to the @GrizzliesPR folks for that note
On the Grizzlies crowd: "It's this place. It's the Grindhouse. As long as our guys keep competing and doing the things that they're doing, our crowd is always behind and always pushing us no matter what the circumstances." -- J.B. Bickerstaff.
2/2 Brett Brown on Conley-Gasol:	"Those 2, when you talk about preparing for Memphis, you really have to game plan a lot for those two as much as anything. And I say that w/tremendous respect. They have a history with each other that they play with each other extremely well."
Let's let Philly coach Brett Brown speak on Mike Conley and Marc Gasol: "The Mike Conley-Marc Gasol dynamic is powerful." Brown compared them to John Stockon-Karl Malone in Utah. 1/2
In addition to Philly going 1 of 15 from outside arc after halftime, Sixers also committed 15 turnovers during the span. As they have all season, Memphis committed fewer turnovers than its opponent. Sixers -- 23 turnovers; Memphis 11. Those 23 Philly mistakes led to 25 Grizz pts.
@PetePranica Hey, aren't you supposed to be doing the re-broadcast on Fox Sports South right now?
Two courtisde fans were asked to leave in the 1st half at the direction of  J.J. Redick.	Asked about the exchange, the Sixers guard said: "He said something -- actually twice. It’s just not something you should say with women and children around. It was highly inappropriate."
Conley scored 13 points in the third quarter to help Memphis erase what was once a 16-point Sixers lead.
Entering the game, @mconley11 had converted only 22 of 69 shots over the last five. He finished the game with a season-high 32 points,  on 12 of 24 from the field. and 4 of 10 from outside the arc.
Hey -- let's do some notes and quotes from the Grizzlies win over the 76ers.		First of all, Philadelphia made only one of its 15 shots from outside the arc after halftime. Hat tip to my friend @PetePranica

@BeauregardJones @PetePranica There you go, hating against on a former lovable player.
Grizzlies, who are near top of league in steals (9.8 a game) had 16 against the Wizards, including Kyle Anderson with four and Marc Gasol with 5.		Additionally, Memphis had 17 turnovers to 20 for WAS. Grizz have had fewer turnovers than opponent in every game this season
The Wizards were playing the finale of a 5--game road trip over a 9-day stretch. The 5-game journey started with a win, but ended with four double-digit losses, and has some players frustrated. "We need to get off the road as fast as possible." -- Bradley Beal.
Let's do some notes &amp; quotes from Grizzlies win over Wizards on Tuesday night.		WIth a hat tip to @PetePranica , the Grizzlies held Bradley Beal to 17 points -- the first time he hasn't scored at least 20. And Wizards didn't reach 100 points for the 1st time this eason
Wizards call timeout after Memphis opens second half with 9-1 run. And appropriately, Washington calls timeout with 9:01 left in the 3Q. Memphis leads 55-46
Grizzlies shooting is so bad, they are only 1 of 4 at the free throw line
The Grizzlies shooting is really, really poor right now. Have hit 4 of 16. Only saving grace is that 3 of the FGs have been 3s. Wizards lead 18-11 with just under 4 minutes left in 1Q
Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff talked about the Grizzlies' need to set the tone early and see how Wizards would respond, especially wrapping up a long road trip. Memphis started 1/8 and trailed 9-3, but have come out of timeout much better. Have cut Wizards lead to 10-8.

"I felt good. At the end of the day, we tried to come back and bounce back from a disappointing first game. At our home, we wanted to get a win in front of the home crowd. We wanted to even it up 1- 1 for the season." -- Grizz F Garrett Temple.

Initial story from Grizz-Rockets posted @dailymemphian  as Memphis wraps up the preseason with a loss to Houston.  And for those who have requested it -- a box score. 	https://t.co/og0FqaQXOH
The crowd is so small and quiet towards the end of 3Q in Grizz/Rockets that a stat crew member called out "Tony" to identify the ref that called a foul, and Tony Brothers came over to see if they called him.
Houston has 14 FGs in 1Q+. 10 of them from 3-point range.	And the Rockets have doubled-up Memphis 42-21
Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff is quite unhappy about his team's lack of rebounding effort. Rockets outrebounding Memphis 15-8. Meanwhile, Houston is leading 31-21 after 1Q. HOU 7-of-15 from 3
@Jon_Roser @MarkMcCleskey Hey, @Jon_Roser ....Did you give him the Crock Pot too?

@badunclep @ChrisHerrington @dailymemphian Ok. I react it
@badunclep @ChrisHerrington @dailymemphian I mentioned your second favorite official -- Zach Zarba.
@glrob54 I think you’re going to need a bigger pan
Last night the Grizzlies went with the younger reserves to win a preseason game over the Pacers. With @ChrisHerrington taking a night off, we @dailymemphian, subbed in an old, old guy for coverage. Me.	https://t.co/VhpB2NQqxc
@badunclep Nope....
@badunclep No, because whatever reprieve you give to any official is only temporary at best. You just haven't seem Sago long enough to find something wrong.		And, I assure you -- your change in attitude will come shortly
FALSE START -- Shot clock malfuction. 19-minute delay. Selden took care of that with a 3-pointer to start the game.
@badunclep Your list of officials you are glad are not her would have been inclusive -- of the entire roster of NBA refs
We are in a delay to start the Pacers-Grizz preseason game because of a clock malfunction.		Let me just say, I'm glad  calm Zach Zarba is the crew chief vs. a number of other officials who could have been here.
True to his word, J.B. Bickerstaff is giving younger players more time, including stating lineup. Grizz starting Selden, Parson, JaMychal, Garrett Temple and Shelvin Mack. Mack was the only available Grizzly who didn't play Friday against ATL
RT @HerringtonNBA: Last night: Grizzlies veterans lead way in home preseason debut https://t.co/xqhFzuaYyG
The only Grizzlies player (other than Kyle Anderson who was out w/ a sore heel) not to see action was Shelvin Mack.
Mike Conley had 11 pts and 3 assts. He was 5-of-10 from the field. But the key stat -- Conley played 27 minutes -- most among the Grizzlies.
Here are some quick Grizz stats for those in a preseason fantasy leagues. Gasol 21 pts, 7 rebds; JaMychal Green 13 pts, 9 rebds. 3-of-5 from 3-pt. But Marshon Brooks -- 18 points, made all seven shots he took, including three outside the arc.
@badunclep You are quite kind, Mr. Unk
I just realized that trying to get a full collection of Jeremy Lin jerseys could get REALLY expensive.  Hawks are seventh team in his career.
I wonder how many times when a team tries to go 2-for-1 in the final minute that the rushed first shot absolutely sucks?
RT @badunclep: The Unk was honored to meet @HerringtonNBA this evening... a man whose prose is the personification of excellence.
In a perfect commentary of preseason, we have three fouls and two points between the Grizz and Hawks through opening 2 minutes
Your officials (who you will boo anyway despite the game doesn't count for anything but practice) ...Brett Barnaky, Gediminas Petraitis and Mitchell Ervin. Honestly, I've heard Petraitis tell stats crew to just call him G
Here are your starters for tonight doesn't-count preseason game -- Grizz: Parsons, Conley, Gasol, Brooks, JaMychal. HAWKS: Tyler Dorsey, John Collins, Alex Len Bazemore and Trae Young
Bickerstaff said the focus this early in the preseason is on what the Grizzlies do rather than game-planning for Hawks. While he expects to adjust rotations, he will increase minutes for guys who he expects to play more in the regular season.
Bickerstaff said Kyle Anderson @KyleAnderson5 will be out vs. Hawks on Friday night dealing with a sore left heel. Everyone else is expected to be available.
Outside of Conley and Gasol, Grizz coach J.B. Bickerstaff said @GTemp17 has emerged as a leader. "As soon as he stepped into the gym with the guys, he's been very vocal. I think there's an automatic respect there for him. His unselfish nature. His willingness to defend..."
For the first time this season, we bid you hello from the small press room at FedExForum after a day of sports and news. Time to open the Grizzlies basketball coverage.
@PatMcD90 @memgrizz @FedExForum You bet I'll be there, and, by the way, the offseason moratorium and peace pact regarding snarky comments about you is OVER as of tipoff tonight.
@JimmyRu91644000 @JasonSmith929 To be up front...some of it has to do with how the box scores come to us. May only be a line score when we want a full box. And, frankly, I'm talking about an aspect of which I am not well-versed. But, I'm hoping to lean on those who are experts.

OK. That's it. That's all. Grizzlies win in home finale, sending fans home w/a glimmer of hope.		Time for my vacation from sports. This Twitter feed reverts to news now (w/an occasional snarky observation).		Time to close the press room.		One last time -- Goodnight from Memphis
"Of all the guys, Marc (Gasol) is the guy that had to sacrifice the most. He wants to win. He's a competitor. He went out every night, regardless of the result, and competed and was there for his teammates." -- J.B. Bickerstaff on Marc Gasol
"We were awful defensively. Horrible." -- Van Gundy
Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said despite connecting on a franchise-record 23 3-pointers, one aspect of his team's game wasn't up to the same task. "Our defense was horrendous," he said, while finding several other ways to say the defensive effort was "terrible"
The Grizzlies finish the season with a home record of 16-25, the first time they have finished below .500 at home since the 08-09 season when they had an identical home record
“I understand how tough it’s been for everyone,” said Marc Gasol, who applauded fans as he left the floor in the closing minutes. “For them to still show support through the bad and the worse and how bad it really got, to me it means a lot.”
Marc Gasol came within a rebound and an assist of his 5th career triple-double, recording 20 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists. But @dillonbrooks24 also flirted with a triple-double -- 22 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists.
Hey, we haven't done many postgame notes and quotes this season, so let's do some....		Grizz had a season-high in points (130), FG% (57.8%), &amp; 3-pointers made (16). There also was a season-best 36 assists.
RT @CAGrizBeat: Thoughts and prayers for Grizzlies timekeeper Bob Young. Get well soon!
Thru 3 quarters, the Pistons have 26 field goals -- 17 of them from outside the arc.		Detroit is 17 of 33 from 3 in the first 3 quarters.
Pistons are 8 of 8 from the FT line in the third quarter, including twice after the Grizzlies fouled Pistons on 3-point attempts.		Grizz still up 76-67 near midway point of the 3rd
Well, Hello, Ben McLemore
Before we get started for this Grizz home finale, a shoutout to the stat crew for keeping me informed all season and helping make sure my math skills aren't steered too far off. 		And yes, that even includes @PatMcD90 who was somewhat tolerable in his rare appearances this year

We have a late adjustment to the Kings starting lineup -- and this one makes a helluva lot more sense...KINGS starting De'Aaron Fox, Willie Cauley-Stein, Bogdanovic, JaKarr Sampson. The previously announce Zbo is nowhere to be seen.

Nuggets coach Michael Malone was really disappointed in his team's intensity, especially opening the game. Denver trailed 34-17 at the first break and was shooting less than 22 percent. "Our starting group did an awful job of starting the game with any real sense of urgency."
While the Nuggets tied the game twice near the 8-minute mark of the fourth, Memphis never trailed, its first wire-to-wire win of the season. Our thanks to @PetePranica for another postgame nugget against the Nuggets.
The Grizzlies had not led at halftime during the 19-game losing streak. They held a 53-48 lead at the break against the Nuggets and Voila -- a victory.
Asked if he had ever endured a 19-game losing streak before, @dillonbrooks24 , the rookie from Oregon replied: "“There’s not enough games in college to go through a losing streak like that.”
Hey, let's do something we haven't done in almost seven weeks. With a Grizzlies win, let's do some notes and quotes.

Your officials for Nuggets Vs. Grizzlies: Sean Wright, Curtis Blair and Karl Lane. The days of asking @badunclep for a rating system have long since passed. I'm going to say everything is fine and OK.
Your starters for Grizz V Nuggets: DENVER -- Wilson Chandler, Millsap, Jokic, Will Barton, Jamal Murray. GRIZZ counter with -- Jarell, JaMychal, Marc, Dillon Brooks and Tyreke.
Tonight's obscure revelation from pregame interviews: Asked what he likes about St. Patrick's Day, Grizz interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff replied: "I like drinking green beer."		I don't think I've liked green beer since a Pub Crawl circa 1982. That was a really bad year
Expect Torrey Craig, called up from Denver's G-League team last week, to see some action vs. Grizz, particularly with Tyreke Evans back. Nuggets coach Michael Malone said Craig's 6-foot-6 size, athleticism and versatility could be beneficial against Evans.
@johnvarlas @StubHub Well, that means you can stop in Bucksnort rather than driving all the way back home.
Grizz coach J.B. Bickerstaff said leaving Harrison (right wrist) out is "just trying to be cautious. Just one bad swipe, and he could have a major setback, so we don't want to risk it."
If you were coming to Grizzlies-Nuggets game to see Gary Harris, you can slow down. Harris, injured in Denver's last game, is out tonight. 		I haven't checked @StubHub yet to see if that news affects ticket prices. 		Also missing tonight -- for the Grizz -- Andrew Harrison.
RT @mgiannotto: STORY: At Iowa St, Fred Hoiberg dealt with the same sort of questions Penny Hardaway is about to face. 		Hoiberg discussed…
Dillon Brooks, who had 20 points in the fourth quarter vs the Bulls last week has 13 in the first quarter tonight. For those without their calculators, that's 33 points in the last two quarters for Brooks vs. Chicago.
And your officials for Bulls Vs Grizz: John Goble, Brent Barnaky, Derek Richardson. All @badunclep endorsed, approved, blessed and validated. 		I think
Here are your starters for Bulls V Grizz -- CHI: David Nwaba, Noah Vonleah, The Robin version of Lopez, LaVine, Kris Dunn. GRIZZ: Jarell, JaMychal, Marc, Dillon Brooks, Tyreke Evans.
@PatMcD90 @EricOpperman Indeed. The more people, the better to block my view of you.
With Tyreke Evans return Vs. the Bulls, the Grizzlies injury list has dropped to three -- Mike Conley, Andrew Harrison, Mario Chalmers.  All three are inactive vs. Bulls.
This news (I'm sure) is already out there -- by Tyreke Evans returns tonight vs. Bulls. He has missed the last 10 games with a rib injury. That could mean a slight bit more chance for Grizz vs. Bulls. Grizzlies are 0-18 this season when Evans is out.
RT @memphisnews: FedEx announces $1 billion expansion of Memphis hub https://t.co/NcVrjLwXJO
Chandler Parsons almost entered the game when there was a foul called on JaMychal Green, his second. But the officials said it was on Kobi Simmons, so Parsons came out -- for a bit. Now enters for Dillon Brooks
See, there isn't any tankin'  by Grizz. Gasol still jumping center instead of Kobi Simmons.
OH MY GOSH....Monday with Milwaukee doesn't even warrant flames from the top of the baskets. 	OH MY&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@evan_b Hey, you ain't gettin' away with that Giannis A. crap in print.
@FlyerGrizBlog Would it helped if I switched the order and put JaMychal first and Jarell second?
And, yes, I have to spell Giannis Antetokounmpo AND Gediminas Petraitis. There are red lines under this entire Tweet because it doesn't recognize anything as correctly spelled
And your officials for Grizz v Bucks -- Ken Mauer, Leon Wood. Gediminas Petraitis. And, I can tell you @badunclep was so close when the trio came out, he had a firsthand, personal look at the three and still didn't speak kindly of two refs
Here are your starters for Grizz V Bucks. MLW -- Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Henson, Tony Snell, Eric Bledsoe; Grizz start -- Jarell, JaMychal, Marc, Dillon and Kobi SImmons
@PatMcD90 @EricOpperman The kindness of @EricOpperman offsets the appearance of the still-teetering @PatMcD90
In rattling off who is not available for the Grizzlies tonight, J.B. Bickerstaff recited Harrison, Mario Tyreke, then said everyone else was available. When it was kiddingly noted he didn't mention Mike Conley, he quickly added the point guard to those unavailable.
We now leave the vacation portion of our broadcast day and move to the sports part and nighttime duties.

@jpmemphis AHHHH. That makes everything much, much clearer
Hey, @jpmemphis do Grizzlies always play on Grizz's birthday? Or does his birthday change annually based on the home schedule?
Both Grizz and Jazz 8 of 18 from the floor. Both Grizz and Jazz 3 of 7 from 3-pt. Grizz 4 of 5 from FT line, while Jazz 5 of 6.		Thus, Utah leads 24-23.		See how this math thing works?
They just called a technical foul on Dillon Brooks, leading J.B. Bickerstaff to ask the rookie "what did you do?"		I didn't hear the explanation
Flames only on a Friday for the Jazz. No one jumps with flames like explosives. Therefore, no one gets called out.
@cory_nba Hhe is not listed on inactives. the inactives are Chalmers, Conley, Tyreke, Harrison.		In listening to JB Bickerstaff pregame, he said Jarell is available.
And your officials for the Grizz Vs. Jazz -- Bill Spooner, Sean Corbin and Aaron Smith. And one of those may draw a No Rating-UNKNOWN from @badunclep
Here are your starting lineups for the ZZs gave: Jazz Vs. Grizz. UTAH: Ingles, Derrick Favors, Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Ricky Rubio. Grizz: Dillon, JaMychal, Marc, McLemore, Kobi Simmons

@PatMcD90 @EricOpperman It appears that can take a long time to recover from.
Your starters for Grizz vs Nuggets. DEN -- Wilson Chandler, Millsap, Nikola Jokic, Gary Harris, Jamal Murray. GRIZZ -- Brooks, Jarell, Marc, Chalmers and Ben McLemore

Besides Harrison, here are the rest of the Grizzlies OUT vs. Denver: Conley, Parsons, JaMychal, Davis.. "I think we've managed to find 10 guys tonight," J.B. Bickerstaff on being shorthanded.

If you are on your way to the Grizzlies game, there are plenty of good seats available.
Observation #2 on game. In the pregame interview, there were no more questions for Suns interim coach Jay Triano after the updates on injuries, player availability and starting lineup. A swift, very Popovich-esque 51 seconds. Wasn't his fault. We didn't have anything else to ask
An early observation -- the interest in this game is so low there are -- at best -- a handful of people hanging over the rail to the visitors tunnel asking for autographs. Area is usually filled

Asked about limiting minutes for veterans, Bickerstaff said not against Cleveland. But "with the importance of developing the young guys that we have on our roster the only way guys develop is if they do play."
Bickerstaff on developing young players: "We have a ton of young guys who we’re developing, but we want to put them in positions and places where we think they can eventually be. Give them opportunities to put them in those spots and have some experience at it."
J.B. BIckerstaff hinted there will be more concentration on developing young players the rest of the season. During the break, they worked on "putting guys in positions where they may have not been before to experiment a little bit to see if they’re capable of doing those things"

Ok. That's it. That's all. Grizz win and that's a good thing for this season or a bad thing for the lottery, depending on your view.		Either way...	It's time to close down the press room.		Goodnight from Memphis
Bickerstaff on Jarell Martin: "He has a unique skill set at that size with that speed and athleticism. The floor needs to open up for him. When the floor opens up for him, his athleticism and skill set can shine. Again, it doesn't happen if he's not busting his tail."
Gasol on the atmosphere w/ the trade deadline upcoming: "It's hard to be honest because obviously, everybody has their own situation and what not. The (players')names that have been out there, they're doing a great job."
The turning point in the game was the second quarter when the Grizzlies outscored the Suns 42-21. It was the highest scoring quarter of the season for Memphis and tied a franchise record for points in a SECOND quarter. Memphis was 17 of 21 in the frame
Troy Daniels converted a 3-pointer in the first quarter, marking the Suns' 1,109th straight game with a 3-pointer, eclipsing the Dallas Mavericks NBA record of 1,108 straight games with a 3-pointer from 1999-2012.
Tyreke Evans was 11 of 17 from the field/ 3 of 5 from outside the arc for 27 points. It marked the 20th time this season he has led the team in scoring and the 14th time he's scored at least 25 points.
The Suns were without leading scorer Devin Booker (24.7 points a game), who is dealing with a right rib contusion. The team said X-rays before the game were negative.
Let's do some notes and quotes on the day folks celebrate Marc Gasol's 33rd birthday. Gasol finished the night with 12 points (on 5 of 10 shooting) and 10 rebounds.
@Volpster242 Yup. Combo problem
To be blunt, this is the exact game you would expect from two teams in a race to the lottery, dealing with injuries and shorthanded rosters with a number of young players.		And... on a Monday night
Grizz coach J.B. Bickerstaff said his team needed to cut down on its turnovers that have plagued them recently. Two Memphis turnovers in first two minutes.
@AMF__3 bench it appears. They are stretching him out at midcourt. Of course, I don't think that is to cure his "illness" that kept him out.  Not listed on starters thought. All Tweets subject to change
@redrock_bball Was told pregame that he's available, but not listed as starter.
Your officials for Suns vs Grizz -- Mike Callahan, Karl Lane and Scott Wall. I have it on good authority and from a very reliable source that @badunclep has come to this game personally to firsthand evaluate the crew
Here are your starters among the Suns and Grizzlies available: SUNS: T.J. Warren, Dragan Bender, Monroe, Daniels from the City of Troy and Isaiah Canaan. Grizz: Marc, Jarell, Dillon, Selden, Andrew Harrison
Troy Daniels will play for the Suns, Marquese Chriss is a gametime decision. Tyson Chandler is not going to play. Alex Len will probably play. "Don't ask about starters because I just found out a lot of this information." -- Suns coach Jay Triano
Suns coach Jay Triano said Devin Booker is going to have an X_ray done , and then the team will be clearer on his status. "It's not worth risking it and he's really tender today and tough to move, so it doesn't make sense for him to play."
Ben McLemore and James Ennis are OUT for the Grizzlies. JaMychal is OUT, along with Mike Conley and Chancler Parsons. "I think that's it. I think we counted 12 guys today." -- J.B. Bickerstaff

Ok. That's it. That's all. 		Spurs give a clinic to young Grizzlies on how to play the game even if your leading scorer is resting.		Time to close the press room.		Good night from Memphis
"You've got to be unselfish every game. It's not like you're happy when you're playing unselfish then you go onto the next game and you're selfish, because we don't do that. We're always unselfish." Spurs coach Gregg Popovich
"We didn't follow the game plan completely. Our plan was to keep (the Spurs) out of the middle of the floor, and they kind of found their way to the middle of the floor, kind of broke us down a little bit and got what they wanted." -- Ivan Rabb
With several Grizzles out, young players got extended time, and a learning experience. "It’s a clinic on how to play the game the right way,” Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of the Spurs. “When you watch them play, it’s amazing that it is so unique to our league."
Ivan Rabb started the first game of his career and finished with eight points and six rebounds. He connected on 4 of 5 shots
With leading scorer LaMarcus Aldridge (22.5 points) taking the night off for rest, the Spurs spread out the scoring with 8 players in double figures.
Let's do a few notes and quotes, well...just because.	Our ol' friend Pau Gasol fell one assist short of a triple-double (14 points, 15 rebounds, nine assists)
Things didn't start out well for either the Grizzlies or the Spurs. Both teams were 2 of 11 from the field near the midway point of 1Q. Things loosened up a bit and Spurs carried a 22-21 lead after the quarter
Here are your starters for SAS vs Grizz: SAS: Kyle Anderson, Murray, Pau, Green, Bertrans		Grizz: Harrison, Selden, Marc, Dillon, Ivan Rabb.
We will get started with your officials for Grizz Vs Spurs. Blowing the whistles will be Kane Fitzgerald, Courtney Kirkland and Leon Wood. A trio that ranks near the very top of @badunclep lists of referees. Just not quite sure what list-- good or bad
The absence list for the Spurs has a few people on it too. Kawhi remains out, Manu has a right hip contusion and is OUT. Rudy Gay has left heel bursitis, so he's OUT. and LaMarcus Aldridge is resting.
As previously announced on a bunch of other Twitter feeds, I'm sure....Grizz rookie Dillon Brooks is headed to All-Star weekend as a member of the Rising Stars World team.
(2/2) Popovich on Tony Parker's reaction to Murray taking over the starting point guard role: "(Parker) was mature, and really made it easy on me to make a decision like that. He was fantastic."
Second-year pro Dejounte Murray has replaced Tony Parker as the Spurs starting point guard and coach Gregg Popovich said Parker handled the change with class. "He was great. He thought it was good for the team, and giving Dejounte a chance to see what he could do. (1/2)
With all the illnesses and injuries, Harrison and Selden will start at guards, per J.B.
Asked about Grizz availability, J.B. Bickerstaff said: Tyreke OUT, Jarell OUT, James Ennis OUT, JaMychal OUT, Conley OUT, Parsons OUT. 		"I've got some assistant coaches who will be out. We've got about two guys (but) we will fill a 5-man roster."

OK. That's it. That's all.	Gasol and Tyreke lead the Grizz in scoring, but the two-way signee Myke Henry provides the spark for the comeback as Grizz defeat Sixers.		Time to close the press room.		Goodnight from Memphis.
The Grizzlies forced 10 Philly turnovers in the fourth quarter, leading to 20 points. For the game, the Sixers committed 24 turnovers, which matched their season-high.
The rally from 15 points down started with a 3-pointer from Henry late in the 3Q. Then, he popped in consecutive 3-pointers early in the fourth as Memphis continued to cut into the Sixers advantage. Henry actually played 11:16 of the 4th
@Greg_Gaston Not quite. The Ferris quote was "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around every once in awhile, you could miss it."		I checked because I thought Myke might be unknowingly channeling Bueller
The Grizzlies have now won five straight at home, and have won 10 straight over the Sixers. Erasing a 15-point deficit marked the largest deficit the Grizz have overcome in a win this season.
"“Life comes at you fast, and you, obviously, have to be ready for changes,” Henry said. “I was ready. It’s been a journey, and I’m just taking it day-by-day.”
Henry, signed to a two-way contract on Jan. 13, scored his first NBA points on a 3-pointer late in the 3Q to put a dent in the Sixers 15-point lead. Then he added nine more points in the fourth.
Hey, let's do some notes and quotes from the Myke Henry NBA Coming Out Party that helped the Grizzlies overcome a double-digit deficit in the 4th to defeat the 76ers.

Ok. That's it. That's all. Grizzlies win their third straight in the Zach Randolph Homecoming Game.		If the government is going to shut down, I'm going to shut down the press room.		Goodnight from Memphis
"I have so many fond memories here and relationships. So many people. Lots of hugs. From the people in the office, to the people working at the game and certainly all the relationships with the players. It's a very special place." -- Nope. Not ZBo. SAC coach Dave Joerger
Deyonta Davis' game continues to develop. The second-year center had 5 points and eight rebounds, but against the Kings, added a career-best 5 assists -- the same as Tyreke Evans and Mario Chalmers
Vince Carter continues to show he is ageless. Carter connected on 5 of 6 3-pointers, becoming the older player in NBA history to convert a handful of 3-pointers in a game. (40 yrs, 358 days)
After allowing the Kings to tie the game 40-all at halftime, the Grizzlies open the third with a 22-7 run to pull away from Sacramento. The Kings never got closer than 7 the  rest of the way and held a double-digit lead for the final 8:46
"Dillon Brooks was really impressive. Jarell Martin tee-d it up &amp; got to the rim, cut you off, spin, finish. So they've got a lot of tough, physical guys. Being here for as long as I have, I know fans appreciate how how hard they play and how physical they are." -- Dave Joerger
While Randolph &amp; Gasol were main scorers when the Core Four existed and consistently took the Grizzlies on postseason runs, neither was a scoring factor Friday night. Gasol was 3 of 6 for six points. Randolph was 2 of 5 for four points. Gasol had 8 rebounds and Randolph 6 boards
RT @AP_Sports: Brooks, McLemore lead Grizzlies past Kings 106-88  https://t.co/dFAvZ0oz8d
“It was great. It was beautiful. All the fans did a great job of showing Z-Bo how much he meant to the city and the franchise.	“Z-bo got the big night, and we got a great win.” -- Marc Gasol on Randolph's return to Memphis.
Ben McLemore, who had not gotten into a game in 8 of the last 11, scored a season-high 21 points vs. his old team -- Sacramento. He scored 12 of those points in the fourth quarter
Dillon Brooks set another career-high in points, leading the Grizz with 22 points. He has reached double figures in 3 straight games and is averaging 19.3 pts a game over that span. He has converted 10 of 17 3-pters over the last three games.
The Grizzlies won their third straight, matching the longest winning streak of the season -- the first one coming in the first three games of the season.
The Grizzlies won despite scoring only 10 points in the second quarter.  In each of the first, third and fourth quarters, Memphis outscored SAC by at least eight points in each stanza, leading to the 18-point win
Let's do some notes and quotes since the Grizzlies won and Zach Randolph came back to town.	“It’s emotional, man. It’s a great feeling,” said Randolph, who finished with four points and six rebounds. “It’s home for me. I love the people, and I love this city.”
RT @memphisnews: Area private schools finding new options in wake of Parker School Uniforms closing https://t.co/clyXHmt0Dh
Right now, the Grizzlies are shooting 31 percent from the field; The Kings are shooting 36 percent. And it is just as bad as that indicates
The Grizzlies have let the Kings back in the game after Memphis held an early 13-point lead. Going 2 of 15 to start the second quarter a major contributing factor.
Now that was special....ZBo returns
Both Vince Carter and Zach Randolph on the floor for the Kings now. 	Seems a bit like last couple of years here.
Randolph introduction held to last of the five Kings starters. The crowd rose to its feed before the introduction was even made and the cheers continued throughout
Your starters for SAC vs Grizz -- 	KINGS: Justin Jackson, Willie Cauley-Stein, Bogdanovic and ZBO. Grizz start Brooks, JaMychal, Gasol, Andrew Harrison and Tyreke.
In addition to Marc Gasol returning from illness, Brandan Wright (illness) and Andrew Harrison (bum left shoulder) also return.
There are times Grizzlies players can grouse a bit about opposing teams getting cheers from the hometown crowd (LAL, Celtics, etc.). That won't be the case tonight when ZBo is introduced. They will know that Zach deserves all of the love
Here are your officials for the ZBo return game: John Goble, Ron Garretson and Leroy Richardson.		Since @badunclep is sulking in the bunker, I am not sure if there will be a cranky ranking of the trio tonight.
@badunclep No one should see a tear in @badunclep eyes
The pregame welcoming committee for Zbo when he claaim on the floor was excited to see his return.  In the locker room, Zach spent a lot of time filling envelopes with tix for ol' friends, while greeting reporters who covered him during his years here.
The talk from both coaches --  JBickstaff &amp; DJoerger-- in pregame was about the emotions of the returnees, particularly ZBo. "All of our guys want to pay respect, and understand how important Zach has been to this organization and what Vince has meant to this organization." --JB
Marc Gasol, who was out last game w/ illness, and listed as questionable pregame, will play vs. Kings, per JB. "If he can carry his legs out there, he's probably going to go play."

@thefishnation I said this earlier tonight, but I actually think Clyde toned down his attire a bit in surrender to Fish Fashion.
Hey, how about this -- with Gasol missing tonight's game with an illness, rookie Dillon Brooks is the only Grizz to play in every game this season.
Courtney Lee converted a free throw with 5:05 left in the second quarter to set the Knicks franchise record for consecutive free throws made with 45. The record previously was held by Chris Duhon with 44 straight. Lee now has 48 straight
JaMychal Green's 18 points and 13 rebounds, marked his fifth double-double of the season.
The Grizzlies led 61-53 at halftime marking the sixth time in their last eight games, they have scored at least 60 points before halftime.
Asked about being a rookie coaxing a tech out of a veteran, like Lee, in a key situation, Brooks replied: "You know the game. It's kind of played on you, so you kind of play it back. I was a little hot-headed back in the day, so I know how to push people to talk a lot."
"We were talking throughout the whole game. (Courntey Lee) is a competitor. A fierce competitor and he wants to win. I guess his mouth got a little ahead of him and the ref gave him a T." Dillon Brooks on his version of the circumstances leading to a late tech against CLee
Deyonta Davis started his first game in his career in place of Marc Gasol, who didn't play because of illness.	Davis had 8 pts and four rebounds
Referee Derrick Stafford said the thing started when Lee bumped "the kid named Dillon from Memphis."	Stafford said he warned both players "to knock it off."	"Courtney Lee used what I thought was inappropriate language toward the young man, so I called a technical foul."
Courtney Lee on the exchange before the tech. "(Brooks) said something like: 'Well, who are you?' I said: 'C'mon, man, you know who I am.' And then I get a tech."
Lee's account of the exchange with Brooks: "The rook (Brooks) grabbed my arm and said, 'get off me.' He said some other words. I said: 'You got the wrong one, rook. You got the wrong one, young 'un.'"
Tyreke Evans converted the technical foul shot, then two more FTs with 12.8 left for the final margin. Lee was beside himself over getting whistled for the tech, saying he thought it should have been a double tech at the most. "I'm at a loss for words," Lee said.
The big talk in postgame was a technical foul called on former Grizz Courtney Lee that came with 17.8 seconds left and the Knicks trailing 102-99. There was barking between Lee and rookie Dillon Brooks, leading to a technical against Lee.
Since the Grizzlies won, and the north loop is clear of ice and snow for me to get home, let's do some notes and quotes as The Rook pickled the Veteran

This early second-half timeout brought to you by Grizz coach J.B. Bickerstaff, a couple of Grizz turnovers and a 6-0 Lakers run
Brook of the Family of Lopez has become an enemy of Grizz fans with his push of Wayne Selden on that play. Upgraded from common foul to Flagrant.
Lakers reserve F Larry Nance Jr. who left the floor to the locker room with 6 minutes left in the second quarter, has returned to the Lakers bench.
@badunclep Attaboy, Unk. Hat-tip to @badunclep
Grizzlies are 5 of 5 from 3. Which certainly helps in building a 10-point lead
Trying for 2-for-1 in the closing seconds is worthless if neither of your two are worth a crap
Grizz shooting 71.4 percent and perfect 4 for 4 from 3-pt range, while Lakers shooting 7 of 18 (38.9%). Grizz lead 28-21 in the first.
By the way, in addition to the injuries to Laker players, coach Luke Walton is dealing with "an illness." Asked if he would coach against Grizz, "We're going to fight through it."
Grizz start 4 of 6 from the field, including all three of its 3-pointers (two by Dillon Brooks) for very early 11-4 lead.

Ok. That's it. That's all. Grizz win. 		Time to close the press room.		Goodnight from Memphis
For those of you not on Tank Watch for the Grizzlies, the win left Memphis seven games behind New Orleans for the final playoff spot in the West. Too early to watch for magic numbers
Memphis scored 60 points in the first half, the fourth time in the last five games where they reached that level through the first two quarters.
Tyreke Evans scored 28 points, his 21st game this season with at least 20 points. It also marked the 19th time Evans has led the team in scoring, including eight of the Grizzlies last nine games.
Pelicans forward E'Twaun Moore had a chance for a tie, but his last-second 27-footer hit the front of the rim. "“You’ve got to live with it,” said Moore. “That didn’t go in. You’ve got to go to the next time. That’s all.”	NOP coach Alvin Gentry added: It was a great shot."
Gasol was credited with a steal from Cousins in the closing seconds -- a key point in the game. “It was a risky play,” Gasol said of helping defensively on Cousins. “Once I saw him put the head down and not really seeing it, I saw a chance and took a gamble and it paid off.”
Marc Gasol said he hopes the win "confirms that why you play as a team like we did in the third quarter" teams win games
Grizz outrebounded Pelicans 50-40, and had 19 boards in the second quarter -- the most for any period this season. Memphis' 50 rebounds, included 14 off the offensive glass
How about some notes and quotes since the Grizz won.		"Bad quarter; terrible quarter." --DeMarcus Cousins on New Orleans scoring only nine points on 4 of 17 shooting in the third.
RT @RebVoice: @TigersAthletics I’ve been the announcer for @OleMissBSB for many years and have done countless games against Memphis on the…
DeMarcus Cousins is 1 of 6 from the field, but 10 of 11 from the line. That's 13 points since the only shot he hit was a 3.		Grizz lead 54-50 with 2:35 left in half
The Grizzlies, who once trailed by 11 in the first half, hold their largest lead -- 4 (52-48) w. 3:37 left
@badunclep But only FIVE were against New Orleans
@badunclep See, errrybody. I told you he liked this crew
Cousins and Rondo already in double figures for the Pelicans and there is 2 minutes left in the 1Q
In a surely shocking development, DeMarcus Cousins disagreed with the first foul called on him.		Meanwhile, Marc Gasol thought he drew a charge, and was just as upset as Cousins when he was called for a block
@_JonahJordan Did you get that deal where you buy ONE chicken tender and you get TWO free in a three-tender box?
@_JonahJordan It was chicken tenders. You can afford those without coupons
This early game timeout brought to you by Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff and a trio or more of Pelicans offensive rebounds that leads to a 3-pter from Rajon Rondo.
Your officials for the Pelicans Vs Grizzlies -- Michael Smith, Brett Nansel and Marc Davis. And, believe it or not, @badunclep was so glad to see this crew, he came by personally to endorse their competency and his total respect for the trio.
Grizzlies start Marc, JaMychal, Dillon, Andrew Harrison and Tyreke Evans.

Memphis held a 15-6 advantage on the offensive glass, leading to 20 second-chance points. Gasol had 4 offensive rebounds.
While Tyreke's 30 and 11 assists, and Gasol's 17 &amp; 15 rebounds were tops on stat line, others had good scoring nights. James Ennis had 14, hitting 6 of 8 shots Andrew Harrison had 15 points and Dillon Brooks scored 11, altho he also had a very ill-advised tech w/ 1:20 left
Lou Williams' 36 points off the Clippers bench allowed the Los Angeles reserves to outscore the Memphis bench 51-39 -- marking the first Grizzles victory this season when an opponent outscored the Memphis reserves.
Austin Rivers scored 38 points to lead the Clippers, the second night in a row he has set a new career-high. He had 36 in a win over Houston on Friday night. Rivers and Lou Williams (36 points) were a combined 24 of 43 shooting, including 10 of 21 from outside the arc
Two-way Kobi Simmons had six points, four rebounds and three assists AND recorded his first career block. He also played 25-plus minutes while Mario Chalmers and Ben McLemore did not play.
Marc Gasol, questionable before the game, with a left hip issue, scored17 points and grabbed a season-high 15 rebounds -- one short of his career-high 16
Tyreke Evans had 30 points and 11 assists. It marked Evans' third time this season reaching 30 points. And it included a career-high six 3-pointers.
Hey, since the Grizzlies won, let's look at some notes and quotes. The Grizzlies have won 3 times in the last 22 games. In each win, the opponents had a chance to tie or win the game on the final possession.
As the losing string gets longer and longer, J.B's patience seems to be getting shorter and shorter. Missed defensive assignments lead to a line change of three entering the game
Poor guy during the timeout game had as much chance of winning the  Audi or the Rendezvous for Life prize as someone defeating Marc Gasol at heads or tails

Here are your officials for tonight's Grizz v Clippers game -- Sean Wright, Randy Richardson, Scott Wall. The @badunclep came to the game personally to wish them a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. 	And immediately got a warning card from security
Marc Gasol is out for warm ups. So, he looks like he's playing. How effective or how long, is a bit of a mystery.
The Clippers defeated the Rockets Friday 128-118 by scoring 76 pts in the second half. Rivers had 36 points, but played 39 minutest. Lou Williams played 38+. Doc Rivers is worried some of that may play into the second night of a back-to-back for Clippers
Bickerstaff said JaMychal is "probably out." as for Gasol "Is going to test (his hip) and see if he can go." Said they probably will know more an hour before game time.

Well, since the Grizzlies won, let's do some notes and quotes.		The Grizzlies won for only the second time since Nov. 7
Referee Bill Kennedy is showing a lot of leniency with Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff's adamant questioning of calls
Marc Gasol sinks a couple of 3-pters to open the second half, and Grizz have pulled within 47-46.....
This game looks exactly like you would expect a game to look between two of the worst teams in the NBA. Grizzlies have 8 turnovers and shooting 36 percent. Therefore, Hawks lead 16-9 because they have 4 turnovers and are shooting 40 percent. 3 minutes left in 1Q
Now there is a lot of confusion over what players were in place to check in, who wasn't and who has to return to the sidelines.
I tell you, if this losing streak continues, Marc Gasol going to have to come up with a new move to break the spell besides banging on the press row one time, then three times
Shooting flames behind basket only pyro for Hawks on a Friday. The fireworks budget is really low this season
@Skinnypalmer @PatMcD90 Straight outta the Death Star
@PatMcD90 @Skinnypalmer @tom_mcdaniel I"m out now. I've said all I care to say about allthis
Grizzlies have announced that both Chandler Parsons and Tyreke Evans, previously listed as "maybes" for Hawks, are available to play vs. Hawks
And @PatMcD90 keeps repeating that @Skinnypalmer told him. "Pat, I'm your father."
It's Star Wars night for the Grizzlies game, and it looks like there's some Wookie- lookin' fool (@PatMcD90 ) on media/stat row.
It was lovely to see @badunclep and so this is kinda anticlimactic because he's already seen the officials, 		BUT		Your officials for Grizz V Hawks -- Bill Kennedy, JB DeRosa and Mark Lindsay
Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Tyreke Status vs. Hawks will be a gametime decision.
@badunclep @FedExForum Uh-oh. This isn't good.......

Ok. That's it. That's all. Grizz fall again. Instead of blowing a big lead, they just let Miami build the advantaget to 27 in the second half enroute to yet another loss.		Time to close the press room.		Goodnight from Memphis
Asked if he thought losing affected others like it does him, Gasol replied: "I couldn't tell you that. Everybody has to look in the mirror, and, as a man, you have to take it personally because wearing this jersey means a lot."
The  Grizzlies bench was outscored 45-26, marking just the fourth time an opponent's reserves has scored more than the Grizz bench this season.
@SharonShyBrown And that song is going to be stuck in everyone's head for awhile.
Andrew Harrison had a season-high 16 points and missed only one of his six shots in the game, converting both his 3-point attempts.
@SharonShyBrown Heck fire, if he can find a way to invoke "Kumbaya", I'm going to find a way to use it.
“I don’t think talk does much. It’s doing. I always believe that talk is great, and we’re going to say the right things, and we can sit down and sing ‘Kumbaya,’ but it’s more about grabbing it and taking ownership of the things we have to do.” --Marc Gasol
"We have conversations after the game. There was a a message to them. We'll see how we react and how we respond." J.B. Bickerstaff regarding postgame mood in Grizzlies locker room
The domination by the Heat didn't spill over into one area -- Miami had only two offensive rebounds &amp; NO second-chance points. No one said so, but I'm sure that ties a franchise record for low second-chance points by a Grizz opponent. (Took logic instead of math in college)
The Heat outscored the Grizzlies 62-40 in the second half, shooting 65 percent after the break. That included converting 11 of 14 shots and 5 of 6 from 3-pt range.
"The effort wasn’t there. To a man, the responsibility that we have to our teammates, to the organization, to the fans, we didn’t give the fans what they deserve. We didn’t give the organization what they deserve, &amp; we didn’t give one another what we deserve.” -- J.B. Bickerstaff
I will go with some notes and quotes, just because we haven't done it in awhile, since Memphis has lost 15 of 16.
The Grizzlies have scored 14 pts in the third quarter, surpassing Saturday night's 9 points in the 3Q against OKC
There are a lot of empty seats in the FedExForum. And those people may not be at the concession stand. They could be on Poplar and Union headed east for home
The Memphis Grizzlies have nine turnovers. The Miami Heat have nine turnovers -- a clear representation of the sloppiness of this game.
Grizzlies up 3-0. Based on last few games, this could mean trouble
I sure as hell am glad I don't have to remember all the secret handshakes of an NBA starter.
no pyro for those of you keeping score at home.
If @MikeMiller_13 is in the house tonight, perhaps he could play a half for each of his former teams.
Your starters for Heat Vs. Grizz...	MIA: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Olynyk, Waiters, G. Dragic. GRIZZ: Marc, Dillon, JaMychal, Harrison, Tyreke.
Your officials for the Heat V. Grizz tonight: JT Orr, James Williams and Marc Davis. I have a sneaky suspicion at least one of those people isn't on the @badunclep nice list for Christmas.

Westbrook is 2 of 9 shooting, which is helping the Grizz obviously. Memphis has built the lead to 20 and holds 43-26 lead.
Well, again, the Grizzlies shoot well in the first quarter (57 percent) benefit from OKC hitting at 26 percent.		Grizz take 34-19 after 1Q
Grizzlies, like last night, have gotten off to a good night shooting and lead 27-13
Damn you, @jpmemphis
I sure as hell hope they aren't waiting to set the big pyro for the next win.		I won't be prepared for that in the postgame
So what does @badunclep think of the officiating crew?. And can we start grading on the curve? I don't think any of the officials rank better than a D Grade in Unk's eyes.

"Hey throw the ball up right, ref!" 	Ties for earliest complaint by a fan at the start of the game
By the way, with Tyreke Evans starting vs. Raptors, his questionable status for game has passed. (Took logic in college instead of math)
Here are your starters for TOR v Grizz...Raptors: Anunoby, Ibaka, Valanciunas, DeRozan, Lowry. Grizz: Dillon, JaMychal, Marc, Tyreke, Andrew Harrison. JB hinted he might change starting lineup
Now, don't anyone tell @badunclep . But, your officials for Grizz v Raptors are Kane Fitzgerald, Tyler Ford and (whisper) Michael Smith.
@badunclep I am hesitating because I KNOW Unk is going to be royally ticked off	.

Ok. That's it. That's all. 		Grizzlies end almost a month of misery with a 95-92 win over the Timberwolves.		Time to close the press room.	Good night from Memphis
Hey, @PetePranica and @brevinknight22 -- Do you think if I rush home in time, I can hear the @MarcGasol postgame interview with @thefishnation verbatim? Or will it sound different on the replay.
The Grizzlies held a 24-8 advantage in fast break points. "On the makes and misses, we weren’t back. We talked about it before the game. …It’s one game we really wish we had." -- Jimmy Butler
The Grizzlies defense held Karl-Anthony Towns to only seven points. Towns also only took six shots in the game -- a season-low.		Towns, who leads the NBA in double-doubles failed to reach the standard for only the sixth time this season
“I just didn’t want him to get a clean look at the three. I just wanted to make it as tough as possible.” -- Andrew Harrison on his defense against Jimmy Butler on the final shot.
Jimmy Butler's missed 3-point attempt with 1.3 seconds left was over Andrew Harrison. The reserve guard said his first thought was Harrison Barnes' 30-footer at the buzzer to give Dallas a 95-94 win over the Grizzlies on Nov. 22 -- loss No. 6 in the 11-game skid
The game was tied at 86 with 5:43 left. When Gasol converted a pair of free throws 35 seconds later, the Grizzlies had the lead for good.		But never by more than 3 points
Well, since the Grizzlies snapped that 11-game skid, we'll do some notes and quotes, starting with Marc Gasol.	"It was the biggest regular-seasonwin that I have ever been a part of." 	See, this type of skid will make you forget everything about the past

No Pyro for Timberwolves on Wednesday. They don't even warrant a flame rising from behind the basket.
Every Grizz fan is aware Memphis has lost 11 straight. And the Grizz also are on an eight-game losing streak at home. That matches the longest home losing streak since team moved to Memphis.
Here are your starters for Timberwolves V. Grizz. MINNY: Wiggins, Taj Gibson, K-A Towns, Butler, Jeff Teague. GRIZZ: Dillon Brooks, Marc, JaMychal, McLemore, Tyreke

Grizzlies are trying like hell to get Deyonta Davis involved in offense, and it's just not working.

YOur starters....for SAS: Anderson, Aldridge, Pau, Danny Green, Tony Parker. GRIZZ: Marc, JaMychal, Brooks, McLemore, Tyreke.
Your officials for tonight's Spurs V Grizz game -- Sean Wright, Pat Fraher, and Scott Wall. I believe these three are very, very high on the @badunclep approval list of top shelf referees
On Parker &amp; Spurs offense. "He's fast. He pushes, and you can tell he's being really, really aggressive with the ball. He's almost trying to get in the paint every single time he touches it. ....A lot of teams get caught off-guard by the speed of (Spurs) offense." -- Bickerstaff
As for Mike Conley's leadership role during his injury...Bickerstaff said Conley is working with players during time outs. "He's been empowered. He's over there in those pretty suits to make sure he's talking to guys and bringing them together."
Bickerstaff indicated Brandan Wright could get more minutes vs. Spurs. Says Wright gives Grizz more chance to match Spurs length. and has experience against Spurs. "I think we will see more of (Wright)."
Bickerstaff said Parsons will get the majority of time at 3 now.  At least to start.  When fourth quarter comes "we'll put out whatever lineup we think is best at that point in time."
"When you play the Spurs, when you make mistakes, they make you pay." JBickerstaf
Regarding tweaks on Grizz defense. "We've got to do a better job of being disciplined. We went for shot fakes, we lost shooters. We shrunk the floor too far off of shooters. those are small things that were mental mistakes on our part." -- Bickerstaff
JB said Grizz will go with the same starters as Wed game vs. Spurs. "That's the plan." ...Also said Parsons, Chalmers, and Brandan Wright all available. Monitoring minutes, but ready to go

Ever wonder how those colorful steeds landed on the Germantown landscape? We looked into the history behind the suburb's painted ponies.	https://t.co/8YssS4L5E7
OK. That's it. That's all. The Grizzlies lose their 8th straight, the team is in disarray and Marc Gasol is pissed. 		That's not a formula for good things happening.		Time to close the press room		Good night from Memphis.
Fizdale on the team chemistry in the midst of an 8-game losing streak. "It's misery right now because of the losing. I feel like our locker room is together and guys are trying to help each other through this. It's frustrating because you don't have an answer for it."
It should be noted that Fizdale's explanation and comments about addressing it came before Gasol spoke to reporters in the locker room. And Gasol was more than willing to talk about his frustration, continuing even after his time was up for postgame interviews
Regarding Gasol, Fizdale said: "We'll address it if it needs to be addressed, but it was a pretty simple decision what I did. I'm trying to win a game. I'm desperate. ...Sometimes when you take a risk, you may (upset) a player or two. That's part of this position."
Fizdale said it was nothing against Gasol that the team's leader in scorer, rebounding and assists, didn't play in the 4th. "We had just been playing so bad up to that point, (the reserves) was the only group that could get anything going, so I just rolled with it."
Gasol spent a lot of time answering questions about 4th-quarter situation. “I’m just as competitive as anybody,” he said. “I hate not playing. That’s what I value the most. If I’m not on the floor, I’m not valued. I’m sure (the coaching staff) knew that would hurt me the most.”
“I do not know the why,” Gasol said of not playing down the stretch, later adding: “It’s a first for me, trust me, and I don’t like it one bit. I’m more (ticked) than I can show and frustrated.”
We're late, but Marc Gasol has a few things to say about not playing in the fourth quarter.
Chandler Parsons suffered some right knee tightness in the first half. Will not return for precautionary reasons.		Per Grizz PR Dude

So, Grizz take early 8 pt lead. Nets starting C has three fouls and Brooklyn commits 7 turnovers.		Result?		Grizz lead 22-19 after 1Q. 	And, no, that shouldn't translate as successful for Memphis
It's Harrison Time for the Grizz. Fizdale said in pregame he had to cut back on Chalmers minutes and said he would work Andrew into the rotation
It appears as if Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Nets coach Kenny Atkinson disagreed a defensive assignment regarding that last Grizz basket. It also appears as if that might have drawn R H-J a time out on the Nets bench.
I would like all Grizzlies fans to remember this -- The Nets have been called for five fouls in the first 5 minutes, including 3 on center Tyler Zeller. THe Grizzlies only have one foul
@Volpster242 oh, helllllllno
I'm not saying it's not a foul, it is..	But reacting as if you were poked in the eye will get you a lot of calls

RT @TeresaMWalker: Barnes' 30-footer at the horn lifts Mavs over #Grizzlies (from @AP) by @claybailey9  https://t.co/suglQNXJF7
Regarding Grizz poor play in 3rd quarter when Dallas outscored Memphis 35-16, "We lost intensity defensively. Not just intensity, I think our concentration a little bit too, our awareness that they were getting the shots they wanted." --Marc Gasol
Regarding winning play after JaMychal Green's follow dunk gave  Grizz a 94-92 lead w/half-second left. "I wasn't even standing up on the (final) play. I just laid against the scorer's table. I didn't want to have my hopes too high because of how many punches we've taken." -- Fizz
"We had a great switch, and (Barnes) got a shot off. He threw up a (30)-foot bank shot to break our heart. " Memphis coach David Fizdale
The Grizzlies hadn't lost six straight since March 22-April 3, 2016. That was towards the end of the season when injuries led to 28 players being on the Grizz roster, including just about anyone who could play guard
Let's do some notes and quotes....Harrison Barnes admitted he didn't call bank on his winning 30-footer to send the Grizzlies to their sixth straight loss. “You literally are just doing a heave to the basket trying to just get it to the rim," he said.
Your early second-half time out brought to you by Coach David Fizdale, some weak Grizz defense and a 4-0 Mavs start
The teams are a combined 4 of 23 from outside the arc.		Yes,that's bad
JJ Barea just used an adjective to describe how awfhiul he thought that call against him was.		And he continues to proclaim his displeasure heading to the bench
Jarrell Martin just checked in and tried to give his knee wrap to official Ed Malloy
Assist @PetePranica
"Look, there are no other Mike Conleys walking around on the street. We went after him hard two years ago in free agency because we felt like he was a great player, and a guy that was an all-star, even tho he had never been one." -- Mavs coach Rick Carlisle
Asked how teams like the Grizzlies should deal with losing streaks..."You do what they're doing and throw it to Gasol every time and let him dictate the game." Mavs coach Rick Carlisle
And your officials for Mavericks Vs. Grizz: Ed Malloy, Bennie Adams and Lauren Holtkamp. The rest of your will boo more often than the appropriate times, but @badunclep will be on his best behavior, I assure you
Your starters for Mavericks Vs Grizz: DAL -- Barnes, Kleber, Dirk, Matthews, Dennis Smith Jr. GRIZZ -- Marc, JMyke, Chalmers, Chandler, DBrooks
I have to say I always look forward to seeing @EricOpperman on the stat crew because that normally means @PatMcD90 won't be here. 		Alas, apparently that isn't guaranteed. #patpresent, #notwatchingbaby
Shout out to the Grizzlies stat crew for helping me keep up with the numbers. After all, I got into journalism because I was told I could take philosophy instead of math. Thanks, Folks.
"We just have to keep working at what we do. We have to keep getting guys that haven't had reps, rhythm, timing or connection to make the right call in coverage." -- Fizz on dealing with defensive lapses.

OK. That's it. That's all. Grizz lose for the 5th straight time and still seem in disarray.		Time to close the press room.		Goodnight from Memphis.
The Memphis bench has outscored the opponents' reserve in all but one game -- the first loss of the season at Dallas. They kept the string alive vs. Portland with a 31-30 advantage.
The Grizzlies are 0-4 this season without Mike Conley in the lineup
Chalmers 21 points was a season high.		Gasol recorded eighth dble-dble of the season w/19 pts and 12 rebounds. He also had seven assists
As for the losing streak, Gasol said he "going to let (the other players) know -- if you play the right way, good things are going to happen. Maybe not right away,...but it's going to come around and help you. So, we do that."
Gasol on rebounding difference: "We missed a lot of shots, obviously. ...You miss a lot of shots, there's going to be a lot of rebounds, but we didn't get a lot of them."
"Obviously, we didn't have a great night shooting, but defensively we were more engaged, way more physical, way more aggressive, way more proactive and that's what it is going to take." -- Marc Gasol
Despite the T'Blazers reaching 100 points like all of the last 5 teams, Memphis said its defense was better. "We finally got our defense activated again," Fizz said. "and I felt like we were back somewhat looking like our early season self."
Portland outrebounded Memphis 60-35. (I've crosschecked that figure every time I've written it tonight). "Crushed us on the glass," Memphis coach David Fizdale said.
Let's do some notes and quotes: The Grizzlies have lost five straight, each time with the opponent scoring at least 100 points.
And 3 of 14 from 3
@memphis7414 and 29%
Rebounds are 22-12 in favor of Portland. That explains some of this.
Fans have a chance of winning the Dillon Brooks game of "What's that called in Canada" about as much as they do at winning at any game Marc Gasol offers
@peteredmiston I don't know what you are talking about, Peter. I don't see anything to suggest that......

We are delaying the announcement of officials for now to let @badunclep blood pressure rise to sub-explosion level. However, one more outburst like the one Saturday night might lead to me unfollowing him for my own safety
Here are your starters for T'Blazers V Grizz: POR -- Damian, CJ, Harkless, Vonleh, Nurkic. Grizz: Marc, Chandler, JaMychal, Dillon, Chalmers
"Our biggest issue right now is communication &amp; urgency. We have guys that have a habit on the weak side who tend to relax. We're changing a lot of habits of guys that hasn't played in the system, &amp;been held 2 a high standard to defend before. So you see warts coming out." --Fizz
Re Defense: "They understand their job. We're just not executing our job. A lot of things get said when you're losing four in a row. But this is the NBA. You go thru bad streaks. Every team goes through bad streaks." -- Fizz
Fizz said no lineup changes. Brandan Wright out with groin injury. Tyreke shoulder still an issue "But he's going to give it a go." Fizz said Tyreke's "was much more of a stinger."
RT @BlazerFreeman: Terry Stotts says Noah Vonleh will start at power forward tonight vs the Grizzlies.
Really not much more to say about Grizz-Rockets game. 		For the second time today, it's time to close the press room.		Goodnight from Memphis.
The Grizzlies lost their fourth straight and fall below .500 for the first time this season. That 5-1 start seems like a long, long time ago
@Escoot My apologies. The doubleheader and a 15-hour day is catching up.
Marc Gasol (2/2): "That right now is not there &amp; that's the hardest part for me to swallow, the trust. You can deal with guys not knowing yet, but you want to see some moving ahead,...and you've got to have at least the mindset of trying to learn and being team first"
"There's a lot of new guys that haven't been a part of this, but it's the mindset that we've always had, the accountability that we've always had, the mindset of one-on-one challenge and trusting the guy behind you." -- Marc Gasol (1/1)

There are a lot of people participating in this Grizzlies-Rockets game who are very upset with the officiating ... some of them are playing, some are coaching
Rockets have connected on 8 of 16 from 3-pt range. Grizzlies are 1 of 4 from distance. Hence, the Grizzlies are trailing 41-26.
Harden with 11 points and 3 assists in the first quarter to help Rockets lead 33-25 at the end of 1Q
For anyone wondering, Conley in street clothes -- with a gray walking boot on his left foot.
Rockets will start CP3, Harden, Capela, Anderson and Ariza. We have a late edit to the Grizz starters...Now, it is Chandler, Marc, Dillon Brooks, Chalmers and JaMychal
Hey, @badunclep Here are your officials for Grizz-Rockets -- Tony Brown, Aaron Smith and Ken Mauer.	That seems like 3 dearly love and endorse refs on the Bad Uncle P Scale of approval

Your starters for Pacers V Grizz: IND: Bogdanovic, Thad Young, M. Turner, Oladipo, D. Collison. GRIZZ: Marc, Ennis III, Brooks, Chalmers and returning JaMychal
Fizz said there wasn't one event that led to Conley's Achilles  injury. "All of sudden it flared, basically. When you play the speed position and everything is planted on that foot, and pushing and going, once that thing flared up, he immediately dropped off."
By the way, Fizz said Chalmers will start in Conley's spot. Re: Conley: "It's just been a very frustrating 12 games, 13 games for him. ...He can't hide it. The guy is giving us everything he can, but he's doing it on one foot," Fizdale said of Conley

OK. That's it. That's all. Grizz can't catch Magic, despite 3 ORL turnovers in final seconds.	Time to close press room.	G'night from Memphis
Evans' 32 points marked only the 8th time a Memphis sub has surpassed 30 pts. Last time was Troy Daniels on 12/3/16
Tyreke Evans 32 points were the most he has scored in a game since tallying 34 against GSW on Dec. 14, 2014.
Gordon thought Dillon Brooks missed 3-point w/ 5 seconds left was going in. “I for sure thought that game was over. I thought they had won.”
The go-ahed 3-pointer by Aaron Gordon w/51.7 seconds left wasn't designed for him. Fournier was 1st option.
And, if things weren't bad enough for Fizz, the Memphis coach is a big Dodgers fan. So it wasn't a good night all around.
Grizzlies forced 24 Orlando turnovers, including three in the final 36 seconds trailing 100-99.	And still could not overtake the Magic
"You cannot mess with the basketball gods. ...Our huddles were a joke. Our communication was ridiculous. No one owned anything." -- Fizdale
We'll do a couple of notes and quotes. Fizdale was quite ticked about his team. Said despite taking lead late Grizz didn't deserve to win
Mo Speights has appeared and immediately knocks down a 3 from straight away
Heat check Marc Gasol
Let me just say that no one involved in this Grizz-Magic game seems particularly enamored with the voluminous calls by the rookie ref
This early second half timeout brought to you by Coach David Fizdale and two straight baskets where Magic beat Grizz down court
For those of you waiting for your Mo Speights return, he did not play in the first half.

Grizz have normal second unit on floor w/ Gasol now.
I may have SOME inside info, but even without being tipped off, I was certain there would be no PYRO for Magic on Wednesday
Chalmers starts for Conley. Will cause changes in second unit. Fizz has said consistently, he left starters alone so as not to mess w/ bench
Officially, Grizz inactives are same three -- JaMychal, Selden &amp; McLemore. But Fizz announced in pregame that Conley WILL SIT vs. Magic
Hey, @badunclep That shrug for Goldenberg is because he's a rookie official. Too small a sample size for a legit Unk rating.
Your starters for Grizz v Magic: ORL: Fournier, Aaron Gordon, Vucevic, Ross, Augstin. GRIZZ: Ennis III, Martin, Harrison, Chalmers, Gasol

Conley on Mavs 2nd half comeback: "Their sense of urgency stepped up. You could really tell they were the team that was more aggressive."
Jarell Martin's 5 blocks vs. Dallas were a career-high. His nine rebounds matched his career-best. He also made 2 of 3 shots from 3-pt range
Mavs only second half lead came from J.J. Barea's 3 FTs w/ 3:56 left. Conley had nine of next 10 MEM pts as Grizz closed game w/12-5 run
Grizzlies had a 22-pt lead in 1st half &amp; 20-pt lead in 3Q before Mavs made comeback. Wesley Matthews four 3-pters in 3Q started the Mavs run

Ok. That's it. That's all. Grizzlies defeat Warriors as Durant and Steph leave early.	Closing down the press room.	Goodnight from Memphis
The win marks only the fourth time in franchise history the Grizzlies have started 2-0, and only the second time since move to Memphis.
Since start of 2011-12 season, Memphis is 13-10 against Warriors. Only two teams have winning record over GSW in that span (SAS)
"(Steph) was frustrated. We were all frustrated. It was a bad night all around." Steve Kerr.
Several Warriors &amp; Steve Kerr expressed frustration w/their performance. "I was frustrated. Obviously, we didn't play well," Curry said.
As for whether threw mouthpiece AT official Scott Wall, Curry said: “If I tried to throw it at him and hit him, I’ve got a pretty good aim."
"That's just part of the game. It's fun. They're heckling us. Calling us names...It's nothing personal of nothing serious." --Kevin Durant
Let's go to notes &amp;quotes: "My frustration boiled over, did something stupid, deserved to get kicked out &amp;that’s what happened” -StephCurry.
The Grizz are slightly sucking to start the second half
Well, it's Grizzlies who built the lead  to double-digits off 3-pters. Gasol's 3-pter puts Memphis up 45-34. Grizz 6-11 from 3. Dubs 3-10
A partial standing ovation from the home-road crowd for Chandler Parsons
Chandler Parsons nails another 3-pointer, and the crowd goes wild
The Grizzlies bench is outscoring the Warriors reserves 21-6. Tyreke with 9 pts.
Chandler Parsons connects on a 3-pointer at the end of the first. The crowd now loves Chandler Parsons.
Grizzlies and Warriors both are 3 of 7 from outside the arc.
Grizz start 1 of 6, but only trail 7-5 early
Pyro....and we have a jumper. At least one official caught off guard
Starters GSW: Klay, Steph, Draymond, Zaza, Durant. Grizz: Mike, Marc, Ennis III, Jarell Martin, Harrison.
Kerr on playing a faster-pace Grizz team: "It's different, but it's kind of the nature of the NBA too."
I will say this -- it doesn't matter who officiates this game, Grizz fans aren't going to be happy, and will have plenty to say to them.
Here are your officials for GSW-Grizz -- Brian Forte, Jacyn Goble, Scott Wall. Hey, @badunclep -- is that the Good Goble or Bad Goble?
@chriswilliams2 Yep. but I am not worthy of 280 characters yet. LIMITATiON for INFORMATION.
As previously noted, Jarell Martin starts for JaMychal Green. "Why not? He's going to play a bulk of the minutes at that position." -- Fizz

Anthony Davis had 33/18 rebs, Boogie had 28 and 10, but they got little help from other Pelicans. 11 from E'twaun Moore. 19 pts from rest
With Wednesday's win &amp; last year's 102-98 over Minn., the Grizz have won consecutive season openers for the first time in franchise history

@badunclep Thank you, Mr. Bad. It's nice to get back into regular season form. I may write limited minutes today since it is the opener
Pelicans come out, led by Tony Allen smiling and waving to the crowd. In typical TA fashion, he saying hello to everyone he recognizes
Fizz on @aa000G9 : He's the heart and soul. He was the creator of grit and grind. He embodied that and the city embraced him for it."
Asked about fighting Grizz for playoff spot, Gentry said: "We have 82 games. We don't have 16 or 24. We have 82 games."
Pels coach Alvin Gentry said Anthony Davis has strep throat &amp; the team will monitor his minutes. Although, Davis wants to play reg. minutes
Here we go, folks. Another season of Grizz basketball. Tipoff about 35 minutes away. We've already told you Harrison will start at 2 guard

That's the half in Memphis. Grizz lead 47-44.
One of many downsides to preseason basketball is small crowds mean hearing leather lung fans trying to be creative. And failing miserably

"You will know when we line up if anything is going to take place," Fizz on National Anthem stance by Grizzlies
Fizz would not shed light on how the team will handle anthem. Says they had a "very mature discussion". Presented angles and repercussions
Wayne Selden will start at the 2 guard, but Fizz says he wants to get a look at a lot of different combos in first preseason game.
More pregame from Fizz: Says Parsons "lost a ton of weight and his body fat is at a career low." Says he looks "totally different this year"

Tigers score on a 2-yard pass from Ferguson to Joey Magnifico. 11:32 left in 1Q. Drive was 2 plays, 91 yards. Smith PAT good. Tigers 7-0
Tigers' Henderson rips off 80-yard run to start Memphis offensive series from the 9. Now, UCLA called for pass interference. 1-G at 2

The resolution passes by a 3-0-2 vote with Barzizza and Massey abstaining.
Massey says the board was cut off from discussion.
"I'm sorry I have to abstain," Barzizza said, adding he thought there should be more discussion
Turns out Alderman Barzizza will abstain. "I'm certainly not against the resolution"
Alderman Forrest Owens also condemns the hatred and extremism. This resolution is going to pass. The only question is if it is 3-2 or 4-1
Alderman Rocky Janda says this question is easy to address. Against hate.
Vice Mayor Mary Anne Gibson says her request to move the matter was not a change in position for her, only an effort to let people speak
Palazzolo says the motion for deferral is not in order because that matter was voted down. City Atty. David Harris agrees
Massey makes motion to defer action. Says things should originate from the board members -- the legislative body, not the administration
Massey says putting First amendment on "slippery slope" by the language in the resolution.
Massey says language in resolution is too broad to condemn legit viewpoints.
Massey says the email shows there is hate on both sides of any issue.
Massey says he got an email the man saying he will work hard to make sure Massey is "a one-and-done cracker." Massey emotional about things
Barzizza's motion to delay fails 3-2. Massey joins Barzizza in seeking deferral.
Barzizza suggests delaying the vote to study this more and explain further what is involved. Suggests a publie hearing to clarify message
Barzizza says public &amp; board needed "a little more information" before consideration of the anti-hate resolution. Says msg could be tweaked
Alderman John Barzizza says with his Italian Catholic heritage, he faced some problems as has his son and other relatives.
Palazzolo addresses claims it is political move by him. He denies that. The resolution reflects a demonstrated value for the city, he says
Billingsley noted that he prefers not to comment on matters before Germantown, but wanted it known he supports the stance
Palazzolo reads a statement for former alderman and now County Commissioner Mark Billingsley supporting the anti-hate resolution.
Palazzolo says more than 300 mayors have joined in supporting similar anti-hate resolutions such as the one before Germantown tonight.
Mayor Mike Palazzolo says board members were "innundated" by the comments regarding the anti-hate resolution. Says the bulk were in favor
One resident -- Bill Ray -- said he opposed it because it combats "imaginary problems."
The vast majority of those speaking on the anti-hate resolution in Germantown favored the position decrying hate, extremism and bigotry
With all the social media banter about the resolution over the weekend, only about seven people spoke on the anti-hate resolution.
Resident Peggu Dumahel speaks in favor of the resolution -- author of a petition with 350 signatures in support of the anti-hate stance
While one speaker  supports the idea of being against hate and bigotry, she is concerned about the language Wants it kept simple.
The round of applause draws a comment from Mayor Mike Palazzolo asking the audience to refrain from outbursts.
The first speaker's comments in favor of the proposed Germantown anti-hate resolution draws a large round of applause from those present
The first speaker -- Audrey Grossman -- thanks the mayor for bringing up anti-hate resolution. Says she is amazed it is under debate
There appear to be about 40-50 citizens at the Germantown meeting.
The G'town meeting is underway, there are some routine matters on the agenda before the discussion about the anti-hate resolution
Gibson's request -- supported by the aldermen -- allows citizens to speak regarding the resolution against hate, extremism and bigotry
As expected, Alderman Mary Anne Gibson has asked that the anti-hate resolution be moved on the agenda behind "Citizens to Be Heard."
We are at the G'town Board of Mayor and Aldermen meeting, where the suburb will consider an anti-hate resolution.

Massey has his points written out in speech form and is covering five reasons Germantown does not need a property tax increase
Massey says city officials said last property tax would last 5 years instead of 4. Contends it can go two more years w/o a tax hike
Massey says city is making a profit in raising property taxes.

Owens says he will support the 21-cent increase to property tax rate rather than the 23 cents

Ald. Rocky Janda says he doesn't hear from people complaining about budget or property tax increase. Says they are not upset w/increase
Barzizza says a 2-cent decrease from proposed $1.99 property tax increase in Germantown doesn't result in many coins in residents' pockets
Barzizza says rest of dept heads have cut their budgets as far as they could. Says 2-cent decrease in hike "is too little; too late."
Barzizza continues to say he has a real problem w/ the amount of the administration's level of funding. Says too high.
Barzizza says believes there is a need for a property tax increase, but not to this level.
Ald. John Barzizza is concerned w/ "rapidly increasing cost" in the administration line item of the budget. Says he favors rest of budget
We are back to discussing whether property tax rate should come before budget or the other way.
Massey asks Gibson if she would be willing to take that property tax rate to $1.76 -- no tax increase as he proposes. Gibson's says NO
After going through two amendments, Gibson's motion to take the tax rate increase from 23 cents down to 21 cents now before board
Alderman Dean Massey says he doesn't want to be confrontational, but wonders why Gibson knew about school reduction before others tonight
We are getting a bit bogged down in parliamentary procedure regarding motions to the Germantown budget. Need to take right order of motions
Ald. Mary Anne Gibson says after review, she proposes property tax hike of 21 cents instead of the 23 cents recommended by administration

Mayor Palazzolo talking about Germantown budget now. Thanks staff, etc., plus FAC.

Lawton presents 2 scenarios that would lower the proposed property tax increase to 21 cents under one suggestion; 16 cents under the second
Always like how governments when they increase property taxes call it "an adjustment." If they are lowering taxes, use the term "lowering."
The 23-cent property tax increase proposed by would take Germantown's rate to $1.99 after adjustment to the certified rate.
We have reached budget discussion at the Germantown meeting. City Adm. Patrick Lawton making a presentation. He will recommend 23-cent hike
Many of the other 3 who spoke on citizens to be heard regarding the budget echoed and supported Michael Stoll's position against tax hike
Stoll emphasized his questions about government spending was not directed at necessities such as public safety, library, etc.
Stoll also said general government increases are more than they should be. Needs to slow down and reconsider some of those costs.
Stoll said plenty of money in city reserve funds to delay the proposed 23-cent property tax increase. No reason to hike taxes for 2 yrs
We are in the public comments at G'town meeting. Former finance employee Michael Stoll said city does not need property tax increase.

Asked about fouls in the game, Fizz replied: "I ain't going down that road, man. I'm begging from my players to pay fines for me."
Fizz said at off-day practice Zbo "looks like he can't move. The guy's walking like he's got the sorest toes you've ever seen."

"For us to win the series, we're going to have to do that." Zbo on he, Gasol and Conley having big games
"They came out in the 2nd half &amp; forced us to turn it over a couple of times...A little sniff and theiy’re off to the races. -- Mills
"Zach was just another level tonight w/his aggressiveness on both ends of the floor. ...We couldn’t guard him as a team." -- Patty Mills
Pop says w/the 2 turnovers &amp; a 3-pter from Gasol, "we lost a little bit of composure and a little bit of confidence and the rest ensued."
Spurs talked about start of 2nd half being turning pt. "We turned it over twice, ...like we were out on a picnic some place." -- Popovich

OK. That's it. That's all. It's past midnight. Grizz win. Super Grizz gets wrestling belt back.		Closing the press room	G'night from Memphis
"Our mentality has changed defensively. We're playing w/ a sense of urgency that we haven't played with all season long." -- Mike Conley
"It takes a lot of concentration and discipline by the 5 guys who are out there. ...It's consistency." -- Gasol on winning streak
Only two teams -- Grizzlies and Clippers -- have multiple wins over the Spurs this season
Marc Gasol has seven or more assists in each of the last four games.
Conley averaging 22 pts a game, 5.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists in the Grizzlies four-game winning streak.
Spurs average 106.5 pts a game. In two games this season, Grizz have held Spurs to an average of 85 pts a game.
Grizzlies had 20 assists &amp; 10 turnovers. Per @PetePranica, that marks 46th straight game w/ more assists than turnovers -- franchise record
The game featured 15 lead changes and six ties, most of them in the first half.
Conley (2/2) "It's almost as if we turned the switch on to playoff basketball.”
“We’re playing with a sense of urgency defensively that we haven’t played with all season long. -- Mike Conley (1/2)
Grizz won game W/ 9-1 run starting w/ 3 FTs from Conley, then a 3-pointer from Conley and closed with a 3-pt play from Gasol for 11 pt lead
The Grizzlies converted 13 of 30 shots outside the arc, including both Conley and Daniels making 3 of 6, while Zbo and Marc each had one.

We will do some quick late-night notin' and quotin' as Grizz beat Spurs for the second time this season.
Grizz cashes Money in Lunchbox for a championship match against X-Pac.Gets the belt back and it stays in Memphis. All well in Wrestle-Town
Ed Malloy just told Vince Carter to stop arguing. Vince said "Don't Vince Stop Me." And Ed hands out a tech to VC
Bagwell with a heel turn to help X-pac defeat Derrick King for championship
Pau just bit on a Marc pump fake from outside the 3-point line.
Oh We've got a jumper. Well, in this case a ducker for Pyro.		Ed Malloy was ready to hit the deck.
Your starters: SAS: Kawhi, LaMarcus, Dedmon, Danny Green, Parker. Grizz: Vince, TA, Mike, Marc, JaMychal. Fizz ain't changing. Superstitious
Your officials for tonight's game (@badunclep endorsed, Unk Loved, Unk Approved): Derrick Collins, Kevin Scott and Ed Malloy
You retweeted that because it mentioned some reference to New Orleans, didn't you?
@badunclep OH, BROTHER!!!!
@badunclep Evening, Unk. Will unveil your love for trio calling game in about 30 minutes. I feel certain at least one you are ecstatic about
Well, this ain't good news for the Grizz hopes of moving up the standings.	https://t.co/QcIIZOvOPQ
Per Popovich -- Tony Parker, who has been out four games with a stiff back, will play tonight vs. Grizz.
Selden was released after a 10-day contract w/the Pelicans. He played in 3 games, averaging 5.3 pts and 1.7 rebounds. He will wear No. 7
Grizz coach Fizz said signing of Selden/waiving of Toney Douglas was necessary cuz of Parsons injury. Grizz also called up Deyonta Davis

Giannis Antetokounmpo did not record a blk in game. Had gone 18 straight games w/ at least 1 blk. Last game w/o a block was 2/1 loss at Utah
Conley &amp;  Gasol both doubted they would play at 40 like Carter.“I’ll be done. Maybe at the YMCA or something, but not in the NBA.” -- Gasol
Grizz won their sixth straight home game over the Bucks. Memphis leads the all-time series 21-20.
Grizzlies, who had not shot better than 47 % in eight of their last nine games, made 52 percent overall from the field and 52% from 3.
Carter became oldest player in NBA history to attempt at least 8 FGs &amp; make all of them. Also oldest to shoot more than 5 3-pters &amp; make all
Carter's 24 points was a season high. And, there were all kinds of "best ever after 40" stats for Carter in game.
Well, since Grizz snapped losing streak, let's do some notin' &amp; quotin'. Vince Carter was 8 for 8 from the field &amp; hit 6 outside the arc

A testimony of how bad things are for Memphis --- No Grizzlies player in double figures as we come to the  close of the third quarter.
The Grizzlies have fallen way too much in love with the 3-pointer. They have tried 20 tonight -- made TWO
The halftime highlights on Fox Sports South must be showing every ONE of the Grizzlies 13 made shots in the first half.
And the Hawks lead has reached 20 before a dunk by Carter
Griza have forced five Hawks turnovers; of course, Memphis has six and trails by 16
And the Hawks lead reaches 10
@geoff_calkins Nah. the Southern kindness and hospitality held until the third miss.
Parsons 0-3 to start the game. And the boos have started
We got a jumper on Pyro Saturday. Official James Williams jumped. And that was on the opening bang.
@badunclep YOu know you don't really mean that.
ATL coach Budenholzere says w/ Howard out, they will rotate defenders on Gasol. Humphries start, Muscala off bench, Ilyasova and Millsap...
Officials (@badunclep endorsed; Unk approved) Zach Zarba, James Williams, Haywoode Workman. I'm sure you will all be on your best behavior
Ennis listed at G for those of you keeping score at home or it somehow impacts your Fantasy team.
Your starters (per da official sheet); ATL-- Sefolosha, Millsap, Humphries, Bazemore, Schroeder; Grizz -- Mike , Marc, Parsons, JMyke, Ennis
@MichaelBSimpso1 @memphisnews I have no answer to any of this. Well. I know why Mike and Marc are starting. Beyond that........
Fizz listed reasons for def. woes: Not locked in. Not loading to the ball. Not competing on the ball at a hi level. Not shrinking the floor.
Asked about defensive woes, Fizz said Grizz are not "committed defensively right now on every possession. All yr. we've had these lulls."
"This will be the first time looking at this one. I'm looking forward to seeing those guys out there together." --  Fizz on lineup change
Another lineup change for Grizz (per Fizz pregame) -- Parsons, Mike &amp; Marc w/James Ennis III, JaMychal Green.

Officials (@badunclep endorsed . Unk approved) Bill Spooner, Kevin Cutler, Kane Fitzgerald. It's the Clippers, you are going to boo anyway.
Your starters (per da official sheet): LAC -- CP3, DeAndre, Redick, Griffin, Mbah A Moute; GRIZZ: Mike, Marc, Harrison, Ennis III. BWright
Based on Harrison/Ennis starting, formula for Grizz must be  -- sit on end of bench &amp; don't play in previous game &amp; you may start next game
As noted, Parsons out (rest) vs. LAC. James Ennis will start in his spot. Fizz said Andrew Harrison will start again alongside Mike Conley
Rivers regarding LAC loss to Minn. Wed. night. "I thought out transition defense was the worst. They just beat us down the floor."
Doc Rivers noted Clips 29th out of 30 teams in rebounding since A-S break. "It's tough to go lower. We Can. We're working on it."

Frontline change coming for Grizz. Wright, Parsons and Gasol in.
Guy playing guess number in Marc Gasol's mind. He guesses 4. Wrong again. Marc undefeated in fan trying to guess the number. Amazing streak
Zbo was beckoned from bench by Fiz. Gasol hit a 3, &amp; Fiz waved him back to his seat. Gasol hit another 3 to make sure Z got a bit more rest
Grizz are 4 of 4 from outside the arc, which has pulled them back within 15-14 of the Nets. Parsons has hit both his shots, including a 3
Let me just say there weren't a lot of pregame, handshake rituals established yet for Andrew Harrison or Brandan Wright headed to the floor
No pyro on Mondays. No pyro for the Nets. No Pyro period
And for all of you who put your chips on any change in the starting lineup to involve Chandler Parsons, please pay the cashier
