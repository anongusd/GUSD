@krassenstein Planned Parenthood is not just an abortion clinic.  It is a women's clinic providing inexpensive or free services including gynecological, birth control, pre-natal healthcare, counseling and abortion. To deprive women services is defeating its mission. Healthy women and babies.

@KGE_31 @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump is lying as usual.  Killing a live infant is murder.  Killing a viable healthy fetus is murder. Late term abortions are extremely rare &amp; usually involve a horrendous decision a woman has to make because of a medical problem she or her baby has. By this law she can make it.
@KGE_31 @DonaldJTrumpJr Most people in this world believe in reincarnation. Birth is when the soul enters. Who are you or I to make a person believe in your Christianity? Why do you presume to enforce your will on theirs. Last time I checked, freedom of religion means also freedom from religion.
@KGE_31 @DonaldJTrumpJr "Selfish women".  Do you hear yourself? Who do you personally know who wanted a child who was aborted?  Like the lies trump says 24 hours a day, women are beat up because of lies. Most women who selfishly WANT to have a baby are deserted by their BF or he pays. My husband left me
@KGE_31 @DonaldJTrumpJr That I chose not to abort a child has nothing to do with other womens choices. When you get pregnant make your choice. Our country is not Catholic or Christian. All citizens are entitled to the integrity of their own body. I would never presume to force my will on them.
@JimHyatt @SenCoryGardner No the opposite. Cory is part of the problem not the solution.  Never have I seen an Administration so willfully try to destroy America, and fight so hard to disenfranchise millions of American's desire to save our planet, provide clean air and water, destroy wildlife habitats.
@SenCoryGardner Until I see you tackle oil companies polluting our state and public lands, to the detriment of proposing clean energy initiatives like solar and wind power, I will not agree you are a protector of public lands.
@KGE_31 @DonaldJTrumpJr Its a good thing then it's none of your business.  Thank God we have the rights to our own body and the ability to choose.

@KGE_31 @DonaldJTrumpJr Babies are not being murdered.  It is against the law to murder. Late term abortions are for dead or severely damaged fetuses unable to live outside the womb or so severely disabled they cannot reasonably have a chance at a cognizant existence. It is not for healthy fetuses.
@DonaldJTrumpJr There is no legislation to kill viable fetuses or babies. It is still murder in these states to kill live fetuses. So continue to lie and steal Jr like Daddy.

@maydaymindy9 @TandemResisters 3) trump and pence out. Appoint HRC Speaker of the House,	Elevate HRC to her rightful place as President. (law is anyone can be appointed Speaker).

@realDonaldTrump I love the people you hate.  Go Mr. Comey, Go Sen. Blumenthal, Go Robert Mueller. All the people you hate are wonderful patriots. Please hate me too mr trump. https://t.co/rYTCNIqi1d
@RoyParret @KamalaHarris What a hateful statement!  Voice your opinion &amp; leave out the hate. No one wants anyone to be on welfare.  Because of the stagnant economy many single mothers working minimum wages DO suppport their children in minimum wage. Pay another $.50 for your hamburger &amp; pay living wage.
@realDonaldTrump Did anyone ever say to your face, "you're an asshole"!  Whoops, I just did.  You are a total nut job. So happy you're going down.

@GeraldoRivera @POTUS Omg was your law degree purchased in a cracker Jack box.  Cohen is going to jail for doing what #IndividualNumber1 (trump) ordered him to do. It's a criminal act to interfere with the outcome of the election. I would expect trump to be ignorant, but you?
RT @CaseyHinds: @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera Still haven’t figured out who Individual-1 is? https://t.co/7pHzi2SWTe
@NewsWwr @HillaryClinton Ok then, just an asswhole here.
@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera Omg, your going to be indicted 4 paying off your mistresses to win election. That's an indictable offense. You're a criminal. So Dist NY said you talked a lot with Russians during campaign. Lying. I think not.  You've been a naughty boy. Can't wait for impeachment, indictment.
@UsaNell @jaynrobinson @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Mymymy what an angry little evangelical you are. Proves my point.  Trump is a criminal and going to jail. Like Manafort, hope Mueller takes all his I'll gotten gains. No more trump tower. So sad.
@UsaNell @jaynrobinson @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Christians who support trump and his mistresses, hate LGBTQ people who are gentle and kind, and preach hatred of anything they don't like do not serve or love Jesus. My family loves me especially my LBGT daughter. I am kind &amp; loving. So don't put me in your box. Jesus is a savior
@UsaNell @jaynrobinson @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump According to the So District of NY Trump is a criminal.  He ordered Cohen to pay off his mistresses to win election He is subject to indictments in So Districtict. He was also colluding with Russia during campaign. He will be impeached in Jan by House. He will go to jail.
@tonyschwartz The House will impeach, if Senators go along. Moderate Republicans need to fall away now.  McConnell needs to be stopped also. This has to end!  Russian interests and Trump were in collusion during the campaign also according to the court sentencing report.
@tonyschwartz The So District of NY sentencing report of Roger Cohen stated Trump told him to pay off his mistresses to keep them silent. He can be indicted tomorrow on that crime should prosecutors chose.  Sen. Blumenthal said he is not above the law.We need to lobby like heck Senate to move.
@UsaNell @jaynrobinson @HillaryClinton I just read your tweets. Regular little hate monger, aren't you. Just like an evangelical, hate, hate, hate. At least I'm an honest Christian, not a paper one.

@verycosmic I do agree on your assessment of the #BushMurderFamily. When Jr goes, I would spit on his coffin. I hate to be bitter, but this family has commited more mass murder than Hitler.  That they are honored this way is disgusting.
@verycosmic @BenjaminMoots @maiamimi Retweeting stolen emails is an act of treason and felonious.  I can see you're a great patriot. I certainly hope that DNC was trying to exclude a non-Democrat from receiving the Democratic nomination. Bernie is a usurper who should have run as a Socialist if anything! A spoiler.

@realDonaldTrump Successful!! 😂😂😂😂
@verycosmic @BenjaminMoots @maiamimi Trump is a narcissistic one man show who can't get along with anyone.  We don't need a democratic misfit. Why do you think bots absolutely hate Hillary.  Our enemies hate Hillary because she's the most effective person to lead. Hate democracy, Chelsea?  Sounds like it.
@verycosmic @BenjaminMoots @maiamimi Hillary is a proven "do-gooder" not fake one.  She is a democrat, not a socialist, she knows how to get things done.  Bernie is all mouth and no action. Quit supporting a mouth and vote for a person of action who belongs in a caucus and knows foreign relations, not a fraud.
@May_2112 @HillaryClinton I wish that were true but I don't want Hillary subjected to hateful bots again. Even now I see the hateful bots attacking her. Make her Speaker of House.  Bring down Trump/Pence. She will be our rightful President.
@HillaryClinton Thank you Hillary!  Your poise and wisdom help us in these dark times. Don't let the bots discourage you from speaking out. Our democracy is in peril. We have to fight back with our wisdom.

@matthewjdowd @realDonaldTrump there is not a sacrificial bone in Trump's body. He is a narcissistic, noncompassionate bully, who doesn't know the meaning of true heroism. You are a bully, a fraud and a coward. There is not an honorable bone in your body. Your followers are just as screwed up.
I recently read a poll that said voters in the 2018 election were primarily retired people, younger voters were down. If young people had voted, the Senate would have looked so different. Voting is the greatest right we have. So many fought just to get registered to vote. VOTE!

Trump was elected to Make America Great. America is a democratic republic. That's what made us great. Yet he is undemocratic, hating our constitution, our free speech, and ALWAYS sides with the most brutal dictators in the world, not other democracies.  The GOP is UNDEMOCRATIC.
With Trump atrocities will continue as hate and greed is the only platform upon which he stands. He has zero friends, only fanatical followers who want OUR country to become another Nazi Germany. (Forgot his bromance with brutal dictator Kim Jung Un, in whom he is "in love").
Inciting riot against another political party, calling them evil and dangerous, while the right stores up automatic weapons and ammo to kill them if they take power.
Racism is unacceptable in our country and MUST NOT become the norm. As long as anyone can buy automatic weapons to murder people of a different color, sexual orientation or religion, we have failed as a civilized society.

We all have to share this country and this planet. There has to be a sane voice to stop this madness, this hatred. Put on your big boy pants &amp; censure this President. He doesn't deserve to run our lives and our country and you know it. He is not a prophet of God. This is not God
I kinda like this meme. https://t.co/y9MaIvvHh4
You need to act responsibly when U see a President out of control. This is not the America we deserve. I've been here for 7 decades, but NEVER in my adult life seen this. I saw the South torn apart in 60s, but NEVER have I seen our country suffer so and a party so complicit in it
You Republicans are enjoying every minute of this. What kind of people are you to laugh behind closed doors because you see this violence in the streets; you LOVE it!  You should be ashamed. You are now officially public serpents, not servants.  You owe a lot for your privilege!!
This is Abuse of Power!  It has to STOP! You senators especially @LindseyGrahamSC have started this!  Finish it. Tell Trump to stop destroying our country with his hate &amp; lies. How can you blame the people both left &amp; right from fighting because of his verbal terrorism. Grow up!
@SenFeinstein @SenWarren @SenMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC @SenBennetCO @SenKamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump Is this the leader you want, one tearing the country apart with his lawlessness and bullying. You're blaming democrats for what he is doing. Someone needs to stop this man!! https://t.co/xp60B8vJ0p
Trump goes around the country stirring up his base, inciting violence and riots through lawlessness: He is destroying our country. His presence stirs up people because they feel helpless to counteract his terrorism. You're blaming people for becoming violent. He needs to quit.
@MelAnneRose @COFightsBack @SenCoryGardner Omg I live in Grand Junction &amp; my life is very peaceful. Call the police if you're afraid. But you're a Vet. You have a gun. Do you have PTSD?

@SenCoryGardner Cory does not represent us, he represents his own interests and that of old corrupt GOP faction. Bandaids cannot stop the hemorraging of money spent foolishly to burden taxpayers. And I don't mean cutting Medicare. When Medicare is gone with what will we pay our deficit.

As I am watching Dr. Ford, I am crying because I feel her pain and because of my own sexual abuse, understand her. I was sexually and emotionally assaulted in my own home and I have hidden my pain for so many years because as a preteen and teenager I was felt helpless.
He was drunk. I laughed it off since I knew he wasn't serious, but I can't believe I laughed. That's how women have had to shrug off sexual comments and harrassment. Its disgusting. I don't want my men friends speaking to me that way.  But I'm Trump's age and men my age do it too

I was married and tried to pretend I was normal. After 3 children, my husband had a serious affair. I became bi-polar and divorced him. I have suffered most of my life with depression and never had another serious relationship for over 40 years.
Like 10pm. When I was brave enough to leave at 17, he came to my apt with a gun to kill me. I knew I was dead. Then he went to door, turned around and shot at me. The bullet must have missed.  I don't know I fainted.
I told my mom when I was 16 and she divorced him. But she died 6 months later and we were taken by him again. He tried to make me his lover and when I resisted he tormented me by saying no man would ever love me. Then he would beat me if he thought I was out too late ...

@SenCoryGardner I think #StopKavanaugh is a GOP political partisan, and was appalled by his non-answering of vital civil right's and women's right's questions. I believe Dr. Ford's accusations about his attempted rape. Naming another boy there is specific, her conduct is also.

@LindseyGrahamSC @kilmeade Yes Fox and friends, and his GOP cronies talk about what?  The cannonization of Kavanaugh. Never have I heard the partianship I heard in Congress, Grassley's closing comments at the long question and non-answer hearing. It was a eulogy fit for sainthood or Jesus Christ himself

@KnowYourObama @SenateMajLdr I'm a real person with real name and I am being hasseled by Twitter hackers and could potentially be herded into a FEMA camp by a facist government who's currently run by the GOP. 3M of our votes were not counted in 2016 so no wonder why some people are hiding behind monikers

I will never again in my lifetime crossover again to vote for your slimey traitorous party.  RIP true patriot

@JoeBiden My heart breaks because he was my Senator for 25 years when I lived in AZ. I am a Forever Democrat but he was the only Senator I wanted representing me. I loved his spirit of going after those who wanted to add pork to important bills and his bipartisanship. God bless his family
@StephenKing Yet he doesn't. And he cannot FIRE NY Attorney General who is working with Trump's late CFO, who is flipping on his business dealings.  My my my. Now we just need to block Kavanaugh's hearings and possible confirmation until after 2019 congress is sworn in.

To Senator John McCain. I knew you as my Senator for 25 years from 1985 to 2010. Although I am a forever Democrat I voted for you each election ballot you were on including the Presidential election. That's how much I respect you. You are an outstanding Senator and man. 💞💗

@Kris_Sacrebleu it is a time when some people are being affected by earth changes waves of vibrations which affect their moods. Medications can help. EffexorXr is a drug which can help mood swings.  I have recommended to friends and its helped them. Faith can help too being around loving souls.
Aliens we know have been visiting US. Congress knows this. Not one has hurt us like sci-fi. What are ramifications of our warrior actions going to do to us? Peaceful exploration, relationships can be forged if true. The projects should be for all mankind not USA only
Trump is deceiving us, hiding hiding truth, sending out bits of future Boeing contracts, when we already have or could have these capabilities now or near future. Outer space in the hands of this maniac is terrifying. Air Force is fighting to keep this. No space rangers please
The American people should decide whether to weaponize space. If aliens are real? They're not as dumb as Trump. A blast in space could annilate the planet Trump wants to rule.

@maddow you nailed comparing Nixon and Trumps deeds in using the machinery of gov to get his enemies beyond his hatred of the press to anyone he hates. I was bedbound by 3rd preg watching Nixon impeachment every day. Too bad Trump fires those who dont do this. Twitters beats tape
Sorry Rachel just told me $6,000,000,000. I did not include as many 0s because I've never seen that many thats why he doesn't understand it is bad to be a debtor nation. Now he can spend trillions. So a budget to make space ships at $1,000,000,000,000 doesn't even make him flinch

@StephenKing Lockheed is colluding. No more talk of space craft. Lots of jobs but not connected to space. I have been following Lockheed for a year on Google after I accidently saw their big mock up of space astronauts being advertised. Not fiction fact. They threw out Boeing name COLLUSION😰
@StephenKing @ka3ceb No kidding all this new crap is your novel. They're just throwing this out there in small bites. Lookheed already build spacecraft and gov doesn't want them advertising for astronauts. Look on Google for Lockheed if they havent taken it down. Gonna check now.
@StephenKing @ka3ceb Unfortunately its not. We should fight weaponizing space. Lockheed for a year recruiting astronauts. They recently stopped but a joblist on Google of 37 pages last I checked of technical jobs etc. The govt shut down private ads because they want to militarily grab their business

@realDonaldTrump Using Boeing. They may be a space contracter but Lockheed is way ahead of them. My guess is you have tried to control Lockheed, a control of private industry or militarize Lookheed. The Air Force may have contracts with them and you want to control space with hand picked people.

@HillaryClinton @senbennett please start investigation as to secret space program. https://t.co/FKpzfMEhr8
@realDonaldTrump I looked up Lockheed once &amp; they were hiring astronauts now they took it down but have 37 pages of job openings. Spacecraft are real!! Now you're saying you're using them for space fighting.  Truth space but covered by fake news. We don't want space militarized. We want you out!

@coleman_rhodie @dominowski @DisavowTrump20 @Nita_Ruggiero I was not sure IF I could vote. I took a piece of mail with me with my current address which was a motel and my license. They said it was ok to vote.  Whether voter fraud could be commited in states like Wy if you received a home mailin ballot I suppose yu could vote 2x
@coleman_rhodie @dominowski @DisavowTrump20 @Nita_Ruggiero No just for President I think. Its not gerrymandering if you are temporarily living and working in another state not your home state. I only cast one vote so it was legal.  I lived there for about 9 months worrking and was not registered in my own state so received no ballot

@Cathat53Breeden @LeoRules1 @cats2home @JeffGilmet1 @realDonaldTrump You're a very funny facist and stupid. Read some history about Ellis Island. Never did we call refugees criminals who sought a safe home. We processed themL &amp; made them legal as long as they had no contagious diseases. They had a hospital for sick immigrants. TRUMP=RACIST
@realDonaldTrump Do you actually believe that?  These children were with their families. You are the Fake News instigator lying over and over again until you and a few morons believe
@Cathat53Breeden @LeoRules1 @cats2home @JeffGilmet1 @realDonaldTrump Maybe if we put a Statue of Liberty on southern borders and created registrations instead of incarceration and separation of families. We could hold our heads high again.
@Cathat53Breeden @LeoRules1 @cats2home @JeffGilmet1 @realDonaldTrump Grow a heart. The only reason they're not legal refugees is Trump and Red who are racist pigs. The only legal option they propose is build a wall and turn them back. In 1900s thru early 20th century we had NYs Ellis Island where boatloads of immigrants were registered and entered
@dabigdoc I hate abortion. But telling a woman that her body is not her own is the ultimate invasion of her privacy and human rights  I do NOT believe in abortion when the fetus is viable or partial birth abortion If the law is changed I will support it including adoption being mandatory

@realDonaldTrump Why do you continue on this tirade? Your best buddies flipped. You are the most slippery villan of this investigation. I know we have a space force so why don't you and your friends fly to Mars and form a reptilian country. No offence to the "good reptilians" who live underground
@realDonaldTrump Because republicans like you are cold hearted reptiles who hate Hispanics. I would never do it your way. Screw your wall.
@realDonaldTrump Again I say Hispanics assimilate well.  Think before you speak because the whole world thinks you are ignorant. They are hard workers, family oriented culture who are Catholic religious. Their second generation is more American than you. Patriotic appreciative of being Americans.
@realDonaldTrump Again your heads in the wrong place. Hispanics as a whole make America great. They assimilate well. Second generations are eager to be a good American. Most are profoundedly Catholic and love our God. To compare them to Fundamentalist Muslims is ludicrous.
@realDonaldTrump We have room for them. We just need a just Immigration program. You blame us but until you are indicted and gone and democrats sweep 2018 elections we don't have the power. Why is that so hard for you to understand?  You have the most twisted sense of morality I've ever seen.

@FoxNews @POTUS Mr Trump. Kim and his daddy's agenda has always been to rattle cages until they get what they want. MONEY MONEY MONEY. You realize tiny Kim has no power but So Korea, China, and now USA are begging him to take their money
@realDonaldTrump @Comey (congratulations on being vindicated by Paul Ryan)  Trumpies bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down so sad this creature has hurt so many people. https://t.co/H0GujJw8IN
@realDonaldTrump @Comey Never! You're brain impaired to think you, a horrible real estate quack, and tv personality,  have the knowledge, experience or understanding of the law  to come up against a man like Comey. You have been marginally elected by a bunch of lobotomized idiots
@chelseahandler @SoitenlyBob Follow me Chelsea I have a lot of info for you. Ciao. I charge no fees for my sarcastic insights. (unless you want a writer )
@chelseahandler @SoitenlyBob Oh babe you know its queer when Trump blows our Allies off and bromances Kim Jung Un and Putin.
Thank you Tom Cruise for your message. I think I only mentioned  you in a tweet so you really must be reading my tweets.  Pray for goodness and love to light our country's way. It is the only way to unification.  Bless you.  Please ask your friends to follow me also. Good night.
@mars_bar @wikileaks @realDonaldTrump Whoa. So far Kims one and only USA bff is Dennis Rodman. Maybe he can win THIS show. After all, all Kim wants is MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!  You are a Nasty man (Trump) Again I don't hate anyone, not you, not Dennis, not Kim, but I swear to God you tempt me
@OpCitizenUSA  Your brand of hatred is no worse than "so-called liberal" hatred. Open your eyes and realize there is plenty of blame to go around. I just made two critical remarks to yours. I apologize. Hate will never #MAGA. The only solution is love and mutual respect.

I think you're just using the phrase to appear intelligent when you're not. Obama ignored Kim and his rattling sabers because he was educated.  Trump is stupid to think Kim wants to be "friends" MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!

Love is the answer
@SenSanders @HillaryClinton Bernie will play a big part unifying us after Trump. I love you Hillary but your health can't take another beating. 2018 will see Us taking back gov and we WILL love our enemies who will work with us. Love is a powerful word. It is the word of today. https://t.co/OP0kJ7lq68
@SenSanders @HillaryClinton Thank you for your sacrifice. I think Trump was a catalyst for people to wake up &amp; take back our country from Congress and big business. Entrepreneurs are rising steadily and about to burst through. My daughter is painting her new offices.Trump is gone https://t.co/YvEs27sGqJ
@realDonaldTrump You have had your day. Give them back their future. As I receive more information I will warn you. You hate FBI and Mueller but they are going to save our country.  Please get out of yourself, remember the Jews loved Jesus one day and within a week screamed Crucify Him.
@realDonaldTrump Hope he recovers though. If he does he might be wiser than to ally himself with you. I don't hate you so in good faith I will be bugging you about resigning. Dont put this broken country through a nasty impeachment trial. You will only hurt your beautiful daughter and children
@realDonaldTrump Take that for a sign we are screwing our allies and bromancing our enemies. You're running scared. Mueller has flipped Cohen and Manafort.  Indictments  coming soon. Don't embarrass us anymore just resign and let your people go Pharoh so we can begin to heal our country.
@anikonov @andersonDrLJA They're so much alike they'll probably end up bbf's or have a bromance. Both are idiots. He didn't even stay to say hi to our allies. Onlly people he likes arre Putin and Kim.  Stupid stupid man.
@netanyahu Hello. Iranians want to be our friends. We just need to get rid of Ayatollahs.  Please appeal to them. They have a great love for both Americans and Isrealis. They are Persian not radical Islamics.  I'm from the beautiful state of Colorado in USA
@JonahNRO @BamaStephen @realDonaldTrump build a wall to keep Americans from fleeing to Canada.

@OpCitizenUSA Very soon there will be almost one party. The disgrace of Trump and his cronies will reeducate Americans as to what a great country the USA can become. Greatness comes from trust and action to make US proud again. Its going to take listening 2 each other w/compassion not hatred

Clean up the bribery and scandals which are plague of Congress
@MaryMae113 Hi. I have some inside info of Trump resigning before general election either before or after his indictment for multiple charges, charges much more astonishing  than obstruction of justice. Pray for our country. Be happy we will be able to come together. #voteblue
@realDonaldTrump by the time midterm elections occur you will have been indicted. You are running scared right now but Mueller's ready.

@realDonaldTrump Well if you believe in Hell, then when it freezes over.  If you don't believe in Hell you may not be a Christian for Paul Ryan, Speaker of House (R), just said today Comey was right.  Its not a popularity contest, its the truth. Oh sheeples uncover your eyes at this man's lies.

Why does he WANT the job?... #ImpeachTrumpNow

@TomGardnerIII @catherinemccoin @realDonaldTrump Yes you dumpkin.  She actually paid her fair of income tax on her $27m fortune. Uncle Donny hasn't paid taxes since the 90s for sure when his multi million? Billion? Creditors solved his overspending by forgiving his loans and the IRS gave him a ten year pass on paying taxes.
@realDonaldTrump Dear God please tell this man to stop whining. If you were a family member of mine you would not be invited to Thanksgiving dinner no matter how much money you had. And if my husband inadvertently did invite Uncle Donny I would seat him at the kid's table, outside on the veranda.
@netanyahu Keep reminding us. I was born in 1946 so well do I remember the aftermath of Hitler's extermination of jews. Its all I heard about as a child. I still cry when photo documentaries and movies like the little kid across the fence air on TV. Never forget who Isreal is!!

@IvankaTrump I don't think in your little dream world you know daddy sexualizes you and any other beautiful model and braggs about his conquests which demean women. You defend this behavior so I know you don't speak for me or other women who do not have your money and nannies &amp; chauffeurs.
@IvankaTrump You never had to struggle to work, take care of 3 kids while worrying if you could pay heating or electricity.  You did not have bosses who sexualized you and made you work mandatory overtime because being lawyers they could come in at 2 or 3 while you had been there at 8am
Your point by point explanation of the investigation of Russia's involvement with the Trump candidacy and presidency was the very first time I understood how treasonous and and corrupt the Trump mafia was and is @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @maddow

@MEMRIReports Thank you for speaking truth and common sense.  Father Abraham's God and yours is same.  Ishmael was given a rich inheritence. The promised land of Isreal was given to jews. prophet Jeremiah said after the diaspora they would return to Israel.  Are Arabs greedy?
@MEMRIReports There is no Palistine Arab. Your own Koran tells you Jews and Arabs have same God.  You have your land Jews have theirs. Take care of your own rich oil fields. You know Allah gave Jerusalem and Isreal to Jews as everlasting covenant.  If you care so much take care of Arabs
@Denise_Left @nikkihaley And you are Islamic?  A religion created a millenium after Christ a Jew was nailed to the cross. And Arabs settled Jerusalem?  They stole it because all they were were camel jockeys living in tents and they had numbers to take it from knights templar. Squatters
Then what's the fuss.  Palistine is not a race of arabs. Palistine was the name English gave Jewish lands. There are no Palestinies. They're squatters and lived in sand before Israelis made the desert bloom. They were camel jockeys living in tents.  Jerusalem was built by Jews. https://t.co/6eNGHLg5Os

@realDonaldTrump you lie whenever you open your mouth you're pathetic you thin skinned buffoon
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump you are not a patriot. Look it up stupid and you want to be POTUS Vote Hiillary Kahn
@bettyboop7499 @SenTedCruz @SenJohnMcCain @BarackObama @attorneygeneral @LorettaLynch
@Ted Cruz nobody cares about your opinions unless you repudiate @realDonaldTrump
@BarackObama Happy Birthday. Thank you for your wonderful work and steady hand but most wonderful support of my heroine Hillary! Go BLUE!
@realDonaldTrump millions like me and other retirees and poor have financed Hillary's and Sanders campaign. What does that say
@realDonaldTrump the billions you wasted could have built factories in Detroit, Grand Junction &amp; many other distressed cities. You're a fool
@realDonaldTrump take a note from Bill Gate and use your money wisely. Feed, clothe and build homes for poor in America
@POTUS great speech. Yes you're right. No ones more qualified.
@realDonaldTrump so glad elected Republicans got what they deserved
