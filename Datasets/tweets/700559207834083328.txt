@charliekirk11 Charlie where did you get this information from? Stop spreading idiocracy.the heartbeat in a fetua starts at the end of the 5th week not in 18 days.
@charliekirk11 Using the black community to advance your political  agenda is just cruel and inhumane.
@CarlHigbie @NYGovCuomo Abortion should be legal only for the 2,5 months and below.
@charliekirk11 I urge the scientists to go check Charlie's mind. It's a chimpanzee disguised as a human.
@elonmusk the supply chain in the tesla plants is a disaster. A lot of cardboard on the assembly line. Plenty space for optimisation and cost reduction on the mid and long-term. I can solve your problem. #ElonMusk #badsupplychain
@KamVTV @realDonaldTrump what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response, were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul.
@robwallyworld @KamVTV @realDonaldTrump nope you missed political classes instead, Donal Trump is in the White House but Nancy and Schumer are in the Congress. definitely not the same office or rules.

@LOZ41666248 @cheffyD1983 @DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Loz that's what I said he did not won by the popular votes,he won by the electoral votes. So he do not represent the majority of US people.
@LOZ41666248 @cheffyD1983 @DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems oops did I hurt your Feelings? well, I'm sorry about that. Obviously, we can not have a conversation without you attacking me personally. Classic Republican
@LOZ41666248 @cheffyD1983 @DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems the national security experts say that building a wall is just a waste of Money. A country is not a house or a private property that you can build a wall around it. Moreover, This is just a political promise made by Trump that made him win the election.
@LOZ41666248 @cheffyD1983 @DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems unfortunately, you can not back-up this with clear Data because you don't have any. Speaking with quality arguments will not convince anyone. So let's run the numbers, the wall will cost more than 5 billion and this is a fact,the security experts say so.
@cheffyD1983 @DailyCaller @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump Darren I'm sorry but why Mexico is not paying for the Wall?
@EricFigueiras @cheffyD1983 @DailyCaller Nope, the Senate proposed a CR to continue the funding and keep the government Open. But Trump want to get  also the funding for the Wall which was not included in the previous federal Budget, and he said it  live on camera that he is proud to shut down the government.
@LOZ41666248 @cheffyD1983 @DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems When you say we the people, you mean republicans, more than a half of Americans disagree with this assessment. Just a Reminder, Trump win the presidential race by the Electoral College votes and not the popular votes so...

@cheffyD1983 @DailyCaller Itâ€™s not chuck who shut it down, Trump himself shut it down and he is proud of doing that
@ACTBrigitte Is this a joke? You are the most inadequate person to talk about immigration. You changed your name from hanan(arabic name) and you were born in lebanon. Of course we don't support the ILLEGAL immigrant but look at the timing of the incident.
@realDonaldTrump Folks, the president is high again , must be the high quality type.
Sorry fellas, but I have 0 respect for the Kardashians and their fans. #whoredashians
@johncardillo Well you can deactivated if you want don't blame your poor concentration to the intelligent software #themachineknows
@USAmbIsrael I'm sorry but this is not debatable.  How about the thousands of Palestinians killed by bombing the shit out of them including children,women ,and old people. I do not support this actions of killing for both sides neither the Palestinians have the right to do it or the Israelis.
@justmarkham Thanks a lot
@justmarkham This is the best channel that I found to contact you ,First thank you for your efforts and endeavor . I'm writing this tweet about your post years ago in data school about the confusion matrix. I have commented your post ,in the article if you can check it out.thanks
@RealJamesWoods Good point James,always on the spot like your shitty films.
@batoooolahhhhhh Is this a joke ?
@VernBuchanan Wow great accomplishment ,so you are telling me that if I slaughter a stray dog at this moment and I consum I will not be punished by the law because trump does not sign it yet? Hmmm interesting

@elonmusk Elon you rock , we are going to colonize that god damn red planet
@elonmusk 24 hours for collision repairs that's impossible if the car is really damaged.  The only gateaway to achieve that is a 24 hours logistic guidelines between the tesla factory and the OEM , a  local integration purchasing policy is costy and   will increase the the PDC and also Tdc

@KylieJenner Whoredashians original netflix
@FaizaRhouati Absolutely
@FaizaRhouati Well the Moroccan one is better
@_imrh1 Said no one ever
@realDonaldTrump It was obvious from the beginning that one summit  will not solve the problem..
@diffinleslie @letcynicismgo @RealJamesWoods For sure illegals should not be here. But my point is that, if we are that serious about illegal immigrants and we will spend billions from taxpayers money to build a wall why we don't do anything about the gun violence? This incident just suits trump agenda.
@diffinleslie @RealJamesWoods Well the vegas shooting (58 killed ) and the 2007 virginia tech massacre ( 32 killed ) were carried out by americans citizens and not illegal immigrants, so stop acting like you care lol
@BillOReilly I could describe your show with the same adjective or worse.
