@marklevinshow If the senate blocks the president, the president vetoes the bill, and both houses override the veto, can the emergency still go through to SCOTUS?
@realDonaldTrump 	Mr. President, if you haven't seen this video from a day ago from Alex Jones, I beg of you to watch.	https://t.co/6wq16cYJw6
@realDonaldTrump 	I just want you to know Mr. President, that I've seen every rally and appearance you've made since coming down the elavator.
@marklevinshow Hi Mark, I remember what you thought about Judge Napolitano’s thinking on the constitution recently.  Alex Jones is saying that Judge Napolitano is at the top of the list for Supreme Court.  Is there a way you can reach the president.
@seanhannity do you remember what the great one thinks about Andrew Napolitano?  BAD!!  Donald is looking for him for the Supreme Court.  Can you have the president speak with Mark?
@realDonaldTrump Mr., I just heard the most horrible, horrible news on Info wars, on you picking Andrew Napolitano.  Major mistakes all time in the constitution, seek Mark Levins help.  He’s a disaster.  Horrible on the constitution.
@realDonaldTrump In advance of tomorrow, have a happy, happy birthday.  Maybe just for 10 minutes, as crazy as it seams, enjoy your birthday with family.		Love Robert
God bless your father.

@marklevinshow Hi Mark, let’s say that the garage the Dems have do not help them in the midterms, does that mean Trump can get rid of Sessions, and Rosenstein without causing impeachment calls?
Why be so week with Trey Gowdy?  You could have asked him his thoughts of the invalid and illegal hiring of Mueller by Rosenstein by not having a crime.  Of expanding Muller's scope when is not the AG.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, can’t we simply threaten war on Mexico or just put us troops on the border, to stop these people?  Maybe threatening all trade with Mexico over this
@realDonaldTrump 	Donald, this for you, enjoy the laugh, https://t.co/F7RaZ86nEF.
@JonathanZWhite 		Hi Jonathan, I want to master Html, css, and JavaScript.  I’m looking at your webpage for cracking the front-end interview.		Can you tell what the best books are that I use to crack these interviews?  I mean specific books.
@realDonaldTrump Please don’t let up Mr. President.  That $800B+ annual deficit is crazy.  Think how much larger that number is compared to the wall.	My suggestion, use the democrats for this issue, and infrastructure and republicans for everything else.		Brad is awesome.
@RepMattGaetz 	Hey Matt, firstly great work, you guys in the house, Nunez, Jordan, etc.  my only question to you guys is, what can we do to make sure these people actually go to jail over this FISA stuff.		I have the feeling they don’t feel threatened.
@JudgeJeanine 	What about asking the president to get signed affidavits or something from the republicans in the house and senate to say that they will support the president firing Sessions, Mueller, and Rosenstein.	Thoughts?
@RepMikeJohnson 	Why not get signed affidavits from all the republican house members and senators stating that they would back you if you fired Mueller?  This way, no impeachment worries.

@realDonaldTrump 		Donald, you are the best president in our history.  You have done such a great job for our country, thank you.		Here’s to an even better 2018
@GreggJarrett 	Greg, this is what I tweeted the president.		Mr. President, I was thinking of another way for you to remove Sessions, Rosenstein, and Mueller, get signed letters from all republican house and senate, that they would be ok to fire these people.	Thoughts?

@Wallace17_daKid nothing like a liberal
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Mr. President, Donald, as you know, I’m one of your absolutely largest fans.  		Why not force, which you easily can, Jeff Sessions or the idiot under him, to open a special council into Robert Mueller?		You obviously have the power.		Regards,	Robert Fruchtman
@realDonaldTrump
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Thank you for a job well done Mitch.
@GOPSenFinance @senorrinhatch Thank god, I stayed up and watched it all.  I look forward to the conference and getting the  bill to our president.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @senorrinhatch I am so happy that got the senate tax bill done, now lets finish it up.
@MooreSenate Hey there future Senator, you have my 10000% support from New York.  We're praying for you.  I know that god will make sure you win for us patriots.
@realDonaldTrump Look at this, from today, Judge Roy Moore holds a 23 point lead in the PredictIt Market.
@realDonaldTrump Absolutely.  I cannot wait until 2018 mid terms, to pick up at least 10 more senate seats.		Great work Mr. President
