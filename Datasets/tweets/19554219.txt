Q: What did you learn from last night's results? 	Trump: "I think people like me"
That devolved quickly
so far:	—investigate Trump, you may get investigated	—investigate Trump, and policy cooperation is off the table	—investigate Trump, and he'll reap the political gains	... https://t.co/QjXPQZwxx8

It may be unclear how a president can keep more promises than he makes... it is clear that this particular president has yet to keep a good number of the promises he has made: https://t.co/kdtdtdF27H
Those promisesincluded  some big ones ("at least 25 million jobs") and some...less-big ones (“I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you.”) ...
As a candidate, Trump made more than 280 specific campaign promises.		He's been using this line since at least last winter, when he'd been president for roughly a year. ... https://t.co/IDk3v0hxku
again: There have been fewer jobs created in Trump's first 21 months in office than in Obama's last 21 months in office. Similar rates, though. (Then again, those numbers actually *were* questioned back then. By Trump.) https://t.co/55fYScgFB7

@leighmunsil my new screenname
(so I need to clarify: these things do not count as "evidence" of a quote	–a clip in which the words are not said	–an email forward	–a meme)
@TrumpTrain09 so if a person points out a quote is 100% fake, *they're* the ones practicing "fake news"?	ok. 	well, thanks for reading.
@TrumpTrain09 well, to start with: Obama never said that, or anything similar But again: the issue isn't attacks. It's the *kind* of attack.
@leighmunsil the best part is when they all tweet the same clip to me as "evidence"...even though it contains no part of the "direct quote"
(I miss airplane mode.)
Post-vacation Day 1: In which I learn how many commenters believe "direct quote" shouldn't always have to mean "actual words a person said"
@zodiac_wolf #smarttake.	fyi: I'm in the business of facts. This means not making claims (like, say "DIRECT QUOTE") with no evidence.
@zodiac_wolf oh, a meme! i'm convinced.
@zodiac_wolf nowhere in that clip does he use any of the words in that alleged "DIRECT QUOTE." Which makes it neither "direct" nor a "quote"
@zodiac_wolf first: when did Obama allegedly say this?	second: yes. one of those would rule you out from one job. The other from all jobs.
@zodiac_wolf wondering if you'd like to share when this "DIRECT QUOTE" was delivered, and why
@zodiac_wolf even if that had actually happened, saying someone's unqualified for a specific office ≠ saying they're totally full of "crap"
@zodiac_wolf yes. On Earth 2, Obama said Clinton was full of "crap" and anyone who believed her was "stupid." On this planet, he did not.

@KatieD_Yo quoting a politician is not partisan. And yes: I know exactly how campaigns usually work. Hence, the observation.
@KatieD_Yo Did you hear the words "stupid" or "crap" there (or, for that matter, "unqualified")? Because I didn't.
@rybry01 this is my fifth presidential campaign, so I can actually say with some confidence that: no. It's really not.
@KatieD_Yo maybe you can think of one example of a leading candidate calling a rival full of "crap"/a "loser", then tapping him. I can't.

@PaulKerseyFan actually, there is. do you know how to check voting records? it's quite easy to find out whether or not someone has voted.

@freddoso If we see ANY hard evidence on this, any reporter would kill for the story. Otherwise, intentional or not, it's a political smear.

@redsteeze @lachlan so 1000s of ppl who love reporters came to cheer them, reporters pointed/said "look over there at this awful person." ok
@lachlan same. Think about it.
@redsteeze @lachlan oh a mob was physically standing next to her while reporters pointed in her direction? (not metaphorically. Literally.)
@lachlan anyway. everyone's entitled to their opinion. I don't need to be "right." All that matters is that people stay safe.
@lachlan again: not getting into a reputational damage analysis. Just noting only one of these puts physical safety at direct immediate risk
@lachlan haven't done anything like that (also: not getting into a straw man discussion) It's just hard to blv you don't see any difference.

So attacking your opponents for not responding to two completely different situations in the exact same way is just a little precious.

Fact: it's not inconsistent for political types to say a public official screwed up one decision, and handled another well. Or vice versa.

@ChanceBGardener To be honest, it looks as though you may want to pay closer attention to what he's actually saying. Thanks for reading.
@ChanceBGardener he just did it again in Portsmouth: "number of murders are the highest in 45 years."  This is not ambiguous. It is false.
fact check: 100% true https://t.co/x688cZoguT
ah. https://t.co/tDGY09r1H2
@ChanceBGardener I have to get back to work, but: words have meaning. The words he used in Charlotte were the wrong ones.
@hollybdc heh was just thinking that
Giuliani: "When they get finished with the Clinton Foundation, it's going to be a bigger scandal than Teapot Dome"
@ChanceBGardener No. He said it accurately—if, again, misleadingly—at the debate, and in Greensboro. But not in Charlotte.
@ChanceBGardener to look at a murder rate that is even lower than it was 40 years ago and call it higher is false. Numbers are what they are
@ChanceBGardener also: I was looking at the wrong year. Murder did go up in 2015, not 2016.
@ChanceBGardener but, again: that is not what Mr. Trump claimed. He claimed that the murder rate now was at a 45-year high. It is not.
@ChanceBGardener ...to use that to claim there is *more* violence than in the past is either misleading or dishonest
@ChanceBGardener 3) the reason % increases are higher is bc the overall rate is now so low, compared to what it was historically. so...
@ChanceBGardener 1) we don't yet have a true 2016 murder rate, because the year isn't over. 2) Last year, the murder rate dropped. and...
ok is this a @TheFix subtweet, what do you guys think (Y/N)? https://t.co/lmU2dF2sIy
@ChanceBGardener that's not accurate either. It's also not what he said.

Trump hears from the crowd: "They say the speakers don't work. and I was having so much fun without those damn teleprompters!" Sad.

@grandmaluper @americanpio Secret Service estimate was 18K+. Reporters on the scene guessed 10K+. Either would be her biggest crowd to date.
@jknight908 are you an employee of the venue, or a law enforcement official? Because what you present here isn't actually evidence at all.
@americanpio @grandmaluper Cops said 8,000. No idea where Fox got their number, so I can't confirm. Sounds like it's in the same ballpark.
@jknight908 The Secret Service was the source of that number. If you have any evidence-based doubt about its accuracy, contact them directly
@americanpio @grandmaluper nope. Just looked at the original file. There have been zero changes to that number at any point. You are wrong.
@crlegalfunding yet in that shot, from one of the few people there with no incentive to inflate crowd size, there are empty seats. hmmmm.
@subawashi so someone who has one candidate's name in their Twitter handle disputes info that would be good for his opponent? Sounds legit.
@DeplorableVinny @commoncentsman As you have provided no evidence, it's unclear on what basis you are accusing the Secret Service of a hoax.
@americanpio @grandmaluper No. Here is the actual Washington Post report on tonight's event. https://t.co/XdQvDkdFwL https://t.co/SFYSpwY2E3

@mccarybg not sure what you're responding to(?) but: I honestly don't care about anything except accuracy. I do get that you care about this
@Nit_Lion close to that, yes. 8,000, per law enforcement.
@nielslesniewski ah yes.... (we were all so much younger then!)
@LuLuWVU19 no. that was the rally earlier this afternoon. Tonight's rally was in Wilkes-Barre, at the Mohegan Sun Arena.
@DBS71 look, unless "real" means "reports that only include info I like, regardless of accuracy": numbers direct from local police are real.
@davemelendez yep. same rally. As noted, there were 8,000 people present, per local police.
@PammiiSue are you serious? (you're not serious. are you? really?)
@MariaMe42546452 it's completely irrelevant, but if you're curious, they were taken within a single half-hour time frame tonight.
@commoncentsman ah, I see what this is. Good luck to you. (If you're sincere: my apologies. Also, you may want to have your eyes checked.)
@larrywilliams44 No. that is a Secret Service count, by way of a reporter on the scene.

@commoncentsman this is a photo by one of the most news respected photographers around. There are dozens of clearly visible Clinton signs.

Donald J. Trump, on the 90s: "The only person who didn't think I was in trouble was Donald J. Trump."

Fun fact: Last week, "braggadocious" made an appearance at a Trump event. That time, the word was coming from Don King.
Trump's income taxes are 12,000 pages. There's probably be something new in there. #analysis
The problem with saying that paying no income taxes "makes me smart" is that it implies that people who do pay income taxes...aren't.
"I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I get audited by the IRS..."
"essentially a financial statement of sorts"
I already feel like I've been watching this debate for my entire adult life
Fact check: Yes. It is a thing Donald Trump says. https://t.co/lXJMFr65F9
...usually, but not always, when he's on prompter
For those asking: sure, Trump could have allergies. But the sniffing is also a thing he does sometimes during big speeches...

@soundofscience2 I realize it's trendy to sort of casually disrespect journalists. It's also, very often, lazy and inaccurate. And corrosive
@soundofscience2 the last may be true. But that's a broken audience. *Many* journalists have been doing incredible work since the beginning
@soundofscience2 Nope. Not even close.
This isn't why debates are *still* like that. It's just how they got that way in the first place.

@benpershing just kidding. the funny thing is, it's a totally self-created problem..normal people AREN'T following 1K reporters. *Maybe* 1-2

@johnnicolay No. It isn't. This is the standard scientific approach. (If the poll showed the reverse, would we be having this conversation?)
@johnnicolay yes. Do you?
@johnnicolay for one thing, bc it's the technical term used here by our extremely qualified &amp; experienced polling team to describe this poll
@johnnicolay actually, that's exactly what it means.
(Reminder: This is *just one poll.* Always look at the trend. Right now, the RCP average of recent polls is Clinton +3)
@tjl so you're a professional pollster?
@IlladelphAC yes. And I have in the past. But it's precisely the same number among RV head-to-head. I encourage you to read the story. Thx.
@IlladelphAC Please read the story. It is 46-46 among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup. That's a tie.
It's tied even though 53% of RV say Trump isn't qualified, 58% say he lacks the temperament &amp; 55% say he doesn't know enough about the world
