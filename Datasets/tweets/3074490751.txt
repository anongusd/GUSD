@HelmanDC would you rather have: Derwin James (19 &amp; 50) + Suh (Irving gone) OR David Irving for one year + Earl Thomas (19)?

@JC1053 forget price, which player would you rather for Dallas in 2018, Suh or Thomas?
@fishsports cowboys have been tied to Watkins, Suh, and now Thomas. Is this a case of striking out on one so you move on to the next option, OR were they interested in bringing in all THREE big names?
