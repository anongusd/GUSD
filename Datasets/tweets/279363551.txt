@Alyssa_Milano @UCLA1972 The original series had the advantage of building on a movie called "The Craft", leveraging drama instead of the "Bewitched" sitcom genre.		The reboot came out among other reboots. It may suffer from reboot fatigue.	Or maybe they value creativity over expectations.		#IMHO 🤔	3/3
@Alyssa_Milano @UCLA1972 The sisters are now college age instead of business ready. They seem to distrust being sisters, which undermines the familial charm of the original show. 	The characterizations seem more harsh, less appealing.	The story lines seem disorganized.	2/

@ArthurSchnelle @charliekirk11 Wrong. Bad information dug up by repubs to justify overly broad purges.
@ArthurSchnelle @charliekirk11 You mean the illegal bulk purges of GA legal voters? The ones based on bad information?
@SisLou1973 @charliekirk11 The "both sides" argument, like whataboutism, serves only to dilute &amp; distract. It leads to burying problems instead of solving them.
@ArthurSchnelle @charliekirk11 My bad. I have trouble keeping up with all the #GOP election fraud cases. GA was the "republican officiating his own election without recusal" case, wasn't it?
#Brexit has already pushed GB over the cliff. It's now a matter of how hard the landing will be. https://t.co/r6fq5kNgAn

@MollyJongFast @GOP @realDonaldTrump They're adding the term "angel" as an appeal to emotion when they talk about victims.		It's almost like they have a working knowledge of emotions, and how to weaponize them.

@amanduhgomez I guess bills of Attainder aren't as unconstitutional as they used to be. 		Or maybe conservatives aren't as pro-constitution as they claim to be.		I suspect the latter.
@twhiteman13 @anonsubstvnce @LSopko @thehill @SpeakerPelosi This all started with Trump's fear mongering &amp; crisis hoax, which was  (as you say) quickly &amp; thoroughly debunked.

@VP @benshapiro @March_for_Life @POTUS I might add that the social conservative movement exists by implicitly violating the prohibition of religious tests as a qualification for any job in government, elected or not.

@VP @benshapiro @March_for_Life @POTUS Punishment via law w/o a trial is a violation of the Constitution. (See: Bill of Attainder, Art 1, sec 9, cl 3; Art 3, sec 3, cl 2, &amp; every state constitution I've ever read.)	Aren't your RW judges supposed to rule according to Const. w/o personal (religious) bias?

@MaryscottOC @georgmike19 @KailiJoy @StateDept @GOP That was an extension of the Ford pardon of Nixon over Watergate.

Republican lawlessness continues unabated, which is why #2018election is key.
@MaryscottOC @georgmike19 @KailiJoy @StateDept @GOP He was very wrong, but it got lost in the surrounding controversies.

The @GOP takeaway seems to be: 	With the right kind of political power, they can get away with anything.
@georgmike19 @KailiJoy @StateDept @GOP Cheney went as far as to claim that he was in the legislative branch as president of the Senate, not the executive branch as VP, in order to avoid the PRA.
@georgmike19 @KailiJoy Caution: State Department &amp; White House have somewhat different rules.

@business Or tone-deaf.
@MargaretMac4 @ToDropADime2 @LgbtResistance Increasing the interest rates back to normal levels (to slow inflation?) has been discussed for 9 years. The republicans piled on national debt knowing the cost of servicing the debt would skyrocket.		It's fair to blame the #TrumpTrain for this, but not the Fed.
@MargaretMac4 @ToDropADime2 @LgbtResistance No, the interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve, independent of the White House - although republicans want to be able to pressure them thru oversight.		The rates have been artificially low since beginning of the recession, but have begun ticking up as economy recovered.
@business Hours after Michael Bloomberg announced that he has joined the Democratic party, this?☝️		This is sooo meme-able.
@JabajoJoan @jimbatz @RBReich The bar for prosecuting defamation is higher for public figures &amp; the free press. 		Besides, #Trump would have to be impeached first, and republicans won't do that under any circumstances - they're far too dependant on his radical base.

@ddale8 I once heard a "conservative" economist claim there is no trade deficit. His reasoning? Product comes in, money goes out, it's all balanced. 		He was arguing against Democrats' concerned about trade deficits. 		Personally, I put trade deficits next to budget deficits.
@PaladinCornelia I've only begun reading through your thread (kudos ✊👍), but there's obviously more to #Kavanaugh than the Federalist Society, @Heritage , &amp; Trump's fear of getting exposed &amp; prosecuted for his crimes. 		I still want to know what happened to his debts.

@EdWhelanEPPC @TomFitton "The terms embryo and fetus both refer to the developing baby inside the mother’s womb (uterus)."		This implies that "embryo" means an implanted zygote.		The term "pregnant" is commonly understood to mean post-implant.	"Abortion" is generally used to mean aborting a pregnancy.
@EdWhelanEPPC @TomFitton I've read that before, and it's ambiguous on the matter of timing. It assumes implantation, and doesn't distinguish between pre- and post-implantation in describing a zygote. Nor does it correlate the transition from zygote to embryo with the moment of implantation.
@EdWhelanEPPC @TomFitton Is that all you have? Evasion?
@EdWhelanEPPC @TomFitton #ICYMI Not all zygotes implant under natural conditions. Does that make Mother Nature an "abortionist"? An "abortificant"?	Do you think that a zygote becomes an embryo before implantation? 	Enlighten us, Dr. Rightwing. 	#StopKavanaugh
@amandablount2 @rswfire But admitting that he had a cookie would imply that his hand was in the cookie jar. 	Self-incrimination! 	Wait. Was the cookie jar broken or whole? What if tongs were used to remove the cookie? 	He needs to consider all the facts before giving you an answer. 	After the vote.
@GOP #ICYMI That includes supremacy over religious "laws", whether Biblical, Islamic, Pegan, or others.		Let me know when someone manages to codify "deeply held religious beliefs" with enforceable specificity.		That has to be harder than codifying "unconstitutional gerrymandering".

@kimberlydodd81 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Given what the @GOP already turns a blind eye to, and what they've actively endorsed/defended, they can be expected to vigorously attack &amp; subvert any attempt to impeach - even if it further tears the country apart.		In short, there is no straight path to removal, even 4 cause.
@kimberlydodd81 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump The problem with that is:	It takes 2/3 of the Senators present to convict on an impeachment.

@topherslo @kylegriffin1 @GOP Republicans hid emails to better effect during Bush43, when White House &amp; @GOP intermixed official &amp; party emails on gov &amp; party accounts. Estimates ranged from tens of thousands to a million missing emails. 		They were not found.

@kate60456 @joshtpm He was referring to the lottery system for picking immigrants from the pool of those who jumped through all the other hoops.
@tcooperlong @SenMarkey @FCC Is there a directory of independent regional ISPs? You have peaked my interest.
@tcooperlong @SenMarkey @FCC Personally, I think they were under staffed &amp; poorly managed, but they were small &amp; having to retain months of network traffic was a significant burden.
@tcooperlong @SenMarkey @FCC I miss my local ISP. It provided services the big guys don't. The mandatory record keeping did them in.
@SenMarkey @FCC It's a nice thought, but those who say that there should be a law rather than a regulation have a good point. 		Negating an instance of a regulation only buys a little time, then it repeats. 		It's time to separate the content from the common carrier aspects of the Internet.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Another bet you don't have the money to pay off. 		What planet were you on the last time millions rose up to defend Net Neutrality? 		Go ahead, impress us with your understanding of #NetNeutrality 	We need a good laugh.

@PrincessBravato If they hold the vote while? McCain is hospitalized, 2 is the magic number. Pence can only break a tie.
@CNNTonight Republicans have to be desperate to count provisional ballots. They really don't like to do that.
@awelch744 Census before, redistricting after. Planning is already in progress, and the @GOP wants to cut way back on the information collected &amp; how it's collected. Also, the head of the department resigned, no replacement that I've heard of. 	I'm expecting it to be badly botched.
@awelch744 It makes sense to me. 		It took an enormous amount of money and effort to pull it off as it is. Republicans are doing all they can to make sure we can't afford to compete everywhere. 	They'll also be running the 2020 census. Or at least responsible for it.
@awelch744 Ha! Republicans wouldn't nominate Jesus, he's way too liberal. 😎
@VABVOX Yeahbut don't get cocky. I don't think we've reached the end of the beginning yet. This was an epic win, but an unusual situation. We need to approach every future race according to its unique circumstances.
@awelch744 Thank you for saying that. I appreciate your fresh thinking. 		I've been frustrated with the way analysts go so heavy into statistics &amp; past elections that don't apply as much these days. It's part of why they got 2016 so wrong. And why they could get 2018 or 2020 wrong as well.
@SenTedCruz @SenMarkey At first reading, it looks like garbage. Good intentions notwithstanding, the bill itself is highly problematic. 	Example: 2 years to set requirements, get competitive bid, design, acquire resources, &amp; build a system that will last 20 years. Not gonna happen.

@politico The whole State Department has been abused, especially the career diplomats and the importance of diplomacy to our ability to function as a world leader.
@NRO Would you prefer a sectarian fragmentation of the economy, or the collapse of the rule of law?		We're already seeing economic distortions due to retaliatory and political boycotts.		"sincerely held religious belief" is unconstitutionally vague to be protected in law.

@BettyMcCollum04 @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats Worse than that, it's a $ assault on the "labratories of democracy" that don't follow their ideology - while claiming that we're taking their money.

@LauraRoslin2017 @FCC Scenario 5	Small &amp; regional ISPs can't afford to add fast lanes, get driven out of business. Less competition, higher prices, fewer choices.		Less "free market".

@Qualcomm Wow. They can fingerprint 2nd &amp; 3rd base!
RT @Im_TheAntiTrump: #TheResistance #NetNeutrality		Embarrassed to ask what the hell net neutrality is? @ajplus is here to explain: https:/…
@cerebralCF Early tiered Internet proposals included CPs paying ISPs to build up 'fast lanes' for their use, but anyone they didn't negotiate with...SOL
@cerebralCF Data-retention mandates have pressured small ISPs to merge or fold. The loss of #NetNeutrality would put the rest out of business.
@cerebralCF This means that local/regional ISPs are in direct competition with the source of their access to the Internet.	#NetNeutrality
@cerebralCF This creates a regulatory conflict &amp; anti-trust problems. Wi-Fi has added new complexities to the problem.	#NetNeutrality
@cerebralCF Backbone providers are, &amp; should be classified as, common carriers. The problem? Content &amp; backbone providers have been allowed to merged.
@cerebralCF End users pay an ISP. ISPs and content providers are customers for backbone providers - the connection between them.
@cerebralCF Since the days of dialup, the economic model of the Internet has been that the customer pays a certain amount ($) for a certain speed. (b/s)
@freshkest @cerebralCF This video makes a mockery of an important issue. Fallacies &amp; bias galore.

#GOPDebate Gov. should define marriage, religious liberty notwithstanding? I'll take liberty over RW Big Gov https://t.co/DgeX2TVJzM
#GOPDebate Greed is not the proper motivation for providing health care.
Does that include same-sex marriage?	Or are those families unimportant/"evil"? https://t.co/nKoGPsWnnd
Will the #GOPDebate consider morality, honor, or mercy when discussing undocumented immigrants?
#GOPDebate 	@JohnKasich reminds us that Gen. Powell was duped about WMDs.
#GOPDebate 	Wild applause for blatant obstruction.	Is this a show of support for the Constitution?
@StephenAtHome #FridayNightFights 	Love babies, don't love guac.	Babies have a future, guac is half way to reincarnation.
@amyklobuchar @SenatorCollins 	Just to be clear, $1T is the cost of dealing with Alzheimer's, not researching it, right?
@TPM WaPo editorial board certainly showcased their command of pejoratives.

@LOLGOP 	Only if Lincoln put on weight and wore a coon-skin hat.	Who doesn't look forward to the Lincoln-Sanders debates?

Anyone in the #GOPDebate willing to condemn extra-Constitutional private legislatures like ALEC? Can we take our gov back from USA, Inc?
Black Ex-Marine Hit By Voter Disenfranchising Law http://t.co/8d9dAGiUzs via @thinkprogress	They tried this crap in WI and OH a while ago.
@LOLGOP Why would he want to send the Ayatollah to heaven??	How about DOWN to 72 suicide bombers who feel lied to?
1st thing to take our country back from is not left or right, but the systemic corruption of politics by big money. https://t.co/93UPWWd0tz
@MartinShkreli Not all parasites are medical. It is evil to create a free market in human suffering, or profit extravagantly from it.
@washingtonpost "Super Mario is a now at Syrian refugee, too"	Is this how the Washington Post forms a sentence/caption/title?
@LOLGOP For recreational use only?
@mattyglesias The bad news is that republicans don't care.
@mattyglesias The good news is that many state const. require public schools and forbid funds so dedicated from going to non-public schools.
What does #MakeAmericaGreat mean to you?	What's your biggest political pet peeve?
@LOLGOP I may never have heard of him if not for conservatives treating him like some boogieman or liberal prophet.

@bobhume I've lost power, dsl, and landline twice today. #XCELdown Losing the phone when the power went down is new. What's up with that?
@daudig @MotherJones Plutocratic and monochromatic:	Portrait of a dogged conservative.
@HuffPostPol I wonder how many of those flags are made in China?

@LOLGOP Words of wiz-dom.
@AriBerman @thenation They are trying to cut the non-voting constituency from the calculations. Would that encourage better representation?
Watched @GeorgePataki @CSPANVL http://t.co/XTAwu7YcpT GP blows off Joe Smallbiz, then tells next guy "It's all about you" while Joe fumes.
#GOP want to run whole country but can’t agree on own debates. Unsurprising they punted to private sector	http://t.co/71a6FEwWk8 via @slate
@statesman Is Texas a "shoot first" state? Maybe they can all claim self-defense.
On the road to shortcuts, there are no success. https://t.co/DM5hcTLblr

@WCCO Was she really from the "MN Rebenue Department", or will there be a spelling correction by 10:00 news?
Nobody's buying @GovPence's "1-sided coin" argument. He should stop lying.	http://t.co/N8J8EHtFNd via @indystar
@lybr3 The way that Cons forget Iran helped Bush invade Afghanistan? #GOPWantsWar against Islam. Invading Iran could do it Get your EndTimes
@indyp8riot So that's a "NO" to the Constitution. And you call yourself a "patriot".	The #GOP mindlessly obstructs everything Obama does.
@indyp8riot Media?? @BreitbartNews is a r/w propaganda outlet	Try rereading Art II sec 2 of the Const. A&amp;C refers to POTUS not other side.
@fgsweetdog @joniernst Self-inflicted castration. #47Traitors
@America4Liberty @kcSnoWhite @angelacarwile Perhaps you meant to point to a more relevant part? A&amp;C sites interaction with Prez, not world
#47Traitors have officially gone too far http://t.co/0CgnvfDRt4	It's not the Logan Act, it's the Constitution &amp; Separation of Powers
#MIGOP seeks to violate the MI Constitution. Again. This time, Art. I, sec 2 &amp; 4.	http://t.co/gdZE1fivWa	Persecution posing as Liberty

You can take the boy out of the KKK, but you can't take the KKK out of the boy. Metaphorically speaking, as per @DineshDSouza
You can take the boy out of the KKK, but you can't take the KKK out of the boy. Metaphorically speaking of course, as per @DinishDSouza
YOU ANSWER THIS ONE: "Would you call @DineshDSouza racist, or subversive?" This is a "biased" question. A common tactic of the dishonorable.
@Slate bkuz nbdy cn undrstnd thm. I never thought an engineer would become one of the English police, but I now think grammar died long ago

@azadehg @joniernst Don't forget the public school bus.
#FoxNews repeated @JoniErnst like it was a late-night infomercial. Her rebuttal sounded like one too.
Interesting that #FoxNews did NOT close caption the #SOTU, but DID close caption the #GOP rebuttal.
Happy #ReligiousFreedomDay http://t.co/UPIpDISX20 the anniversary of the disestablishment of state religion in Virginia.
@BarackObama "I Spy"??? Not the brightest tweet from a government official. It's elementary, my dear POTUS.		Cute picture, though.
