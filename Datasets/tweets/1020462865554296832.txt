Better distance yourselves now, or you will all go down with the ship.		Bucketfuls of evidence, trump said.		#Impeach
This is exactly why he kept toting *fake news* and *witch hunt*		So when this day came, he could convince 1/3of the country it's all lies.		Coming from him, it all makes sense. He can't stand the fact that the whole world is going to see right through him now.		#Trumpistoast

@pam_brundige Please?!?
@pam_brundige Yes
Just a thought. Evengelicos think trump is the " chosen one".		Today, I think Cohen is.
Also coming up, trump got a fake bidder to bid on his own (trumps) portrait, who got it for 60,000. He wanted his painting to go for more than any other portrait at that auction. Trump then paid the fake bidder $60,000 out of the charity fund, hung it at his property, and gloats.
Trump in business never allowed anything to happen without his approval.Cohen says, "To be clear, Individual 1 IS the president."
Cohen opening statement.."Trump is a liar, a cheat and a con. I wouldn't be saying any of this without proof." Trump made it clear he wanted Cohen to lie to Congress, because trumps personal lawyers went over his answers and changed them to fit trumps lies.
Mueller has 250,000 pages of evidence.

Why do people keep protecting abusers and pedephiles? Has this always been our reality? Will it ever stop? This is horrendous,  surely not the normal, but why aren't people screaming to the rooftops about this?		Sexual abusers never just stop. Castrate the MFs.
This is probably why so many children are unaccounted for.		They in the past transferred some of those agents, or fired some of those agents. 		Isn't transferring the same tactic catholic churches used?	They need  prosecuted, not put back into positions to be able to do it again.
So we are on the same page, House Judiciary was given stacks and stacks of pages from DHS about the detained children. In those stacks, they found proof that 1,000 of those children have been abused per year for last 3 years. 150 were sexual abused by the HHS officers. 		Thread

@heartofhannah1 He had a very "white"name. GARY
This wasn't an assault rifle by my understanding. But he did have a scope with laser. Is there such a thing?		#GunSenseNow
It happened at a factory, I believe and it's possible he was a disgruntled worker. Of course the investigation is ongoing, maybe 5 employees critically injured, but many more with non life threatening wounds
The man had apparently walked in with a laser site on his gun, and just started shooting everyone. He kept shooting, aiming at everyone, killed 4 police officers as they arrived, until swat tracked him down and shot him. His name was Gary. I won't say his last name yet.

8.Dems are more progressive than ever before. Please do not close your mind to this. It would benefit millions, either physically or financially.  Alcohol, smoking cigs, and opiods kill. Marijuana has never killed anyone.
7. Look at California. The only state in the country that has a balanced budget, and in the black. Kamala is from California, which is why she wants legalize this	 all across the country.
6. Millions of jobs would open up in the states. Hundreds of thousands per state. Lower # of people needing state funded help, or federally funded help. As I said in #1, every state would benefit so much financially, new workers would be paying taxes, shopping more, saving more.
5. CBD oil has no THC, but is used to help pain, stress, and many other bodily issues. You won't get "high" on the oil. I know, I use it. You don't need a perscription. Order by mail if you don't have a dispensary in your state. A 2 oz bottle can last a few months.
4. In that respect, marjuana will help opioid addicts safely withdraw their addiction. Every life that is saved is worth it. Marjuana is not now something people used to look down on. It has been proven to have very beneficial medical uses.
2. Marianas helps many people who have medical issues with autism, siezures, pain, etc. Most who have siezures see significant results same day. 		3. Perscription pain meds have caused hundreds of thousands of opioid deaths. Marijuana is the best, safest substitute.
Thread. I am making the case for legalizing marjuana. Bear with me.		1. If legalized nationally, it could help every single state get out of debt, and possibly have excess revenue that could be used for state needs. Infastructure, schools, state funded programs.
Californians..the whole state is getting saturated with rain, snow, flooding, mudslides. Please be careful, don't  take unnecessary chances.
