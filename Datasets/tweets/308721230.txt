Reid's amdt makes necessary cuts to lower the deficit while protecting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid - programs needed for survival
I am supporting Reid's compromise proposal - it would protect our credit rating by eliminating the possibility of default through 2012.
US default would cause higher interest rates on our federal debt and put mortgages, car loans, student loans, and credit cards at risk.
6 days to debt ceiling deadline: reaching a compromise is critical. Failure would lead to harmful downgrade in our nation's credit rating.
