@muhammad_farcry @BBCSport @1Obefiend 2/2 agree to disagree. I'm sure Malaysia has the right to our doors and we ended our ties with Isreal. I don't understand why ordinary citizen of any country must pay the price for the actions/policy of their government. What next, to ban companies like Waze?
@muhammad_farcry @BBCSport @1Obefiend 1/2 I don't condone the violence that is happening at the middle east. And since this is the 'only' way to remind Israel, how has the ban / non-bilateral ties working out against  Israel?
@muhammad_farcry @BBCSport @1Obefiend I'm not vouching for Israel's actions but merely stating that one shouldn't be discriminated based on  the country they belong to. And why do we keep numb to countries such as China, Saudi Arabia &amp; Myanmar on its humanitarian issues? Why no blanket ban?
@BBCSport @1Obefiend Good decision. This is coming from a Malaysian. No room for discrimination. Malaysia has always been bias towards Israel and ignore atrocities by other nations.
