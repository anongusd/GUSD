@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray The modern  definition of sentience is the ability to have subjective thoughts about something. How you feel about feeling. No. Pigs do not possess this. The old world defined it as the ability to feel. This would include everything living, including fungi and plants, &amp; pigs.

@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray I got a better question. Why would you ever be presented with this choice?
@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray This would be my subjective take on the "morality" of eating.
@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray Third point. Moral agency is subjective. There is nothing immoral about eating what is biologically in your nature to eat.
@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray Second point: you glossed over the plants being alive part. Why are they not deserving of the same moral consideration?
@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray Point to address. It is not a strawman when you admit to hold them at a double standard as I said. You just provided a reason, which was the question.
@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray Why can't I eat a turkey? But you can fuck it's house up to make room to grow your nasty brussle sprouts?
@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray Why is it that human diets are the only ones you are trying to change. It's immoral for me to eat fish, yet the dolphin who is proven to be intelligent gets a pass? The chimpanzee will rip it's pretty apart while alive and eat it...no vegans protesting that....how come?
@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray I don't. However you seem to. I accept animal eat other animals. I don't try to stop animals from eating other animals unless they belong to me. You however, hold animals above humans and other living things such as plants. Why?

@STFilmmaker @stillgray I agree
@KQuinnJazz @Catherine6859 @stillgray Also "can live" and "is good for you" are not the same thing. Science has shown over and over it is horrible on your body  for extended periods. You need meat based protein.

@jamie2181 @KristinBoymom Hi, how are  you.
@AOC You can tell these people are just up your ass and have no idea what is going on. You say this shit like you didn't just vote against paying them. Hypocrite

@mawnx Absolutely. Fgm is deplorable. Mgm is deplorable. Abuse is deplorable. Male circumcision is none of these things. Next.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 @kcoffeeCO No it doesn't. Karatanization is growing things like calices, nails, feathers hooves, hair, etc. you psuedo-intellectual fuck knuckle.
@kcoffeeCO @MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 Aye, I'd much rather have it done when I'm not old enough to retain memories. You know...when it's done on most men.
@kcoffeeCO @MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 It has nothing to do with "not wanting to admit I was wronged." Because first of all, that is entirely my decision. You can feel however you want. But  you do not get to say how we feel about ourselves.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 @kcoffeeCO Doctors "used" to say smoking was good. Doctors STILL recommend circumcision.... this difference is pretty damn obvious. There are no doctors recommending fgm in the US....none. sit the fuck down.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 @kcoffeeCO "causing karatanization and life long psychological trauma" to whom? Sure maybe some. But for most this is simply  not true most circumcised men do not give two flying fucks they are circumcised. You do not speak for us.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 @kcoffeeCO Irrelevant. You have conceded the child's autonomy and gave this to the parent based on doctors recommendation. You don't get to choose which doctors they listen to. You are not qualified to determine which doctors are mistaken.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 @kcoffeeCO Giving a shot causes harm, and it's not needed, it's recommended. Should we stop those and wait until the child is 18?
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 @kcoffeeCO It's also interesting you say pediatricians can be wrong, but use Doctors who are not pediatricians as though they cant be wrong as well. Your logic is so flawed. It's hilarious. Keep feeding me dumbass.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Skeptibearical1 @kcoffeeCO Lol. No. Not until you can actually provided a source that actually says I'm wrong. You keep claiming you have, but you haven't. Now until then YOU shut the fuck up and go wash the cheese off your dick. https://t.co/tma3pbRLgJ

It does not change why male circumcision is done. It does not change that it is not mutilation. It does not change it is recommended by many pediatricians.

@VioletVampire2 @stephieeeeee_ @Owl_Smuggies @PhadingDark @MEMESofVIOLENCE @SummerOffRecord Nobody is saying it's needed. And again	 The religious significance is based in hygiene. Just because God was included doesnt change this fact.
@GamerGuyRocks @MEMESofVIOLENCE @PhadingDark @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord This involves relying on a six year old to do all of it. And unless you're watching your kid wash all the time like a creep. They likely aren't doing it all the time.

@AnsgarTOdinson @JTViper3 @UsualSkeptic Except it's not mutilation as it isn't done in attempts to make imperfect or make disfigured. It can also be repaired.  It's done for hygiene.

@drvox No we didn't. The effective tax rate after deductions was 45% stop throwing around this misinformation.
@AnsgarTOdinson @JTViper3 @UsualSkeptic That's not what irreparable means. So your point is irrelevant.

@GamerGuyRocks @MEMESofVIOLENCE @PhadingDark @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord That simple huh. Cutting it and cleaning it, base to tip. I'm glad we agree on this.
@PhadingDark @GamerGuyRocks @MEMESofVIOLENCE @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord Except nobody is advocating cutting off your clitoris for hygienic reasons. The study was done on men. Fake ass nurse. Lol
@AnsgarTOdinson @JTViper3 @UsualSkeptic It's doesn't....as I said and the link shows, there are non surgical ways as well. "Reading is hard." Fucking chode. Lmao
@GamerGuyRocks @MEMESofVIOLENCE @PhadingDark @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord You cut your hair. Apparently your too lazy to comb it.
@AnsgarTOdinson @JTViper3 @UsualSkeptic Except it's not irreparable. Foreskin can be restored surgically and non surgically.  https://t.co/iaRk1CWGJD. So no it doesn't apply. Disfigure means to spoil the attractiveness of. It's been surveyed over an over that women prefer circumcized men. So disfigure doesnt apply.

@MEMESofVIOLENCE @PhadingDark @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord You really suck at this dude.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @PhadingDark @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord No I didn't say that. I said that she she said "yeast infections did not affect then head of the penis"
@GamerGuyRocks @MEMESofVIOLENCE @PhadingDark @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord Yes it is.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @PhadingDark @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord "it says most cases are caused by not washing" yeah that's what I have been saying this whole time. Circumcision makes it easier to clean and keep clean
@JTViper3 @AnsgarTOdinson @UsualSkeptic Male*
@JTViper3 @AnsgarTOdinson @UsualSkeptic The full context is important. If causing a temporary injury is mutilation that would mean receiving a shot via vaccine would be mutilation. Make Circumcision is not done in attempts to disfigure so only the injury part applies.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @PhadingDark @stephieeeeee_ @SummerOffRecord Thrush is a type of yeast infection you fucking knob...lol https://t.co/jp9tYgSPEL
@AnsgarTOdinson @UsualSkeptic @JTViper3 It says to make imperfect. You're imperfect uncircumcised. So circumcision is quite the opposite of mutilation by definition.

@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Owl_Smuggies @stephieeeeee_ @PhadingDark @SummerOffRecord Perhaps it's more significant in women because guys like you stick your cheese crusted dick inside them. FGM is not done for hygiene purposes for the umpteenth time now.
@Owl_Smuggies @GamerGuyRocks @MEMESofVIOLENCE @stephieeeeee_ @PhadingDark @SummerOffRecord You're the one who wants to wash a seven year olds dick. Not me.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Owl_Smuggies @stephieeeeee_ @PhadingDark @SummerOffRecord My dick is cut, and I shower daily. therefore obviously my dick will always be cleaner than yours. Speaking of, your probably due for a washing.  Wouldn't want your fake RN gf to pass out from the smell.
@Owl_Smuggies @GamerGuyRocks @MEMESofVIOLENCE @stephieeeeee_ @PhadingDark @SummerOffRecord I am an adult. The argument is reference to children.

@Phredreeke @Jovangnr @MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Nobody has claimed epidemics. You're grasping for straws. UTIs and yeast infections are relatively common issues.
@Phredreeke @DecayMedia @MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya The stink is caused by bacteria......buildup of bacteria and fungus can cause infections...that is a concern for a six year old.

@Jovangnr @MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @Phredreeke @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya No actually everything I'm saying is basic knowledge. It's done today primarily for hygienic reasons. Infections are caused by fungus. Fungus builds from lack of hygiene. Children are not hygenic.

@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @Phredreeke @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya So you get to use your most likely bullshit anecdotal evidence about you autistically washing your dick as a six year old but my anecdote isn't relevant?
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @Phredreeke @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Never advocated a medical excuse. I advocate a hygiene choice, that when performed properly causes no I'll effect except minor possible sensitivity loss. To me it's the equivalent of an ear piercing. Fact is, most circumcised men don't care they're circumcised.
@Phredreeke @DecayMedia @MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya No I don't. But it doesnt build up gunk like a foreskin does either.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @Phredreeke @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya And no the government should not be able to swoop in and take your kid for "medical intervention." Anymore than they should have the right to do so for you. Your child is not the governments responsibility.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @Phredreeke @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Fgm is not even close to being the same as removing a foreskin.  I'm not advocating for castration. Which would be closer to fgm.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @Phredreeke @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Yeah ok. I'm not gonna say you're full of shit. But when you were six? Did you do this regularly throughout the day? Sorry. https://t.co/fYTUGlM3vk

@madamcuntyspice @Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @Phredreeke @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Yes they do. At least in US they do.
So then that would mean piercing a child's ear would be mutilation/abuse? https://t.co/GFgfTfcPr3
@Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @Phredreeke @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya You do not wash your children beyond their first few years of life. I know this because I washed myself since I was at least six years old. You're trying to hard. Nor did I once advocate for mandatory circumcision. I said it's the parents choice.
This would also include piercings. Shall we outlaw children getting their ears pierced as well? https://t.co/qioQK8s3UP
@Galork_Bear_Son @StandLoneCmplex @SummerOffRecord @DecayMedia @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Except that not having the part doesnt require the extra hygiene. Uncircumcised men still masterbate and get stimulation. So theirs no negative either. Unless your dick is short and you need that extra half in when your soft to feel better about yourself I guess.
LMAO...I'll say this again. There is no study debunking how often uncircumcised men wash the inside of their foreskin. There is no study debunking fungus causes yeast infections. There is no study claiming fungus doesn't come from lack of hygiene.  BUT KEEP TRYING. https://t.co/zpvFtEGYjQ
@Galork_Bear_Son @DecayMedia @madamcuntyspice @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya No shit. Remove skin from anywhere you remove nerves.
@DecayMedia @madamcuntyspice @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya It's also much easier for a careless unsupervised child to wash. Did your parents bath you when you were 8? I certainly hope not.

@DecayMedia @AnsgarTOdinson @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya When did I say that parents shouldnt wash their children. Find me the tweet where I said that. You're straw manning now.
@DecayMedia @madamcuntyspice @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Because just like your foreskin they aren't vital, so they're removed without consent of the child.
@DecayMedia @madamcuntyspice @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Actually no, its generally cosmetic, and to avoid the pain of your mouth shaping around them being there..
@Jovangnr @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Yes I claimed good hygiene prevents yeast infections.
@madamcuntyspice @DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Many wisdom teeth removals are done on children who did not consent so......
@SummerOffRecord I'm going to repeat this on behalf of all circumcised men. NO IT DOESN'T.
@Phredreeke @DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Nor do I. I'm glad we clarified this.
@Jovangnr @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya No it is not. And it wasn't my claim. My claim is that it was done for hygienic purposes. Being clean prevents infections. A woman's clitoris isn't a cluster of bunched up skin building up sweat and dust throughout the day.
@Jovangnr @DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Being hygienic helps prevents infections in general....... It's kind of why we do it.
@Oli88764063 @DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Actually, most people have their wisdom teeth removed the moment they come out, even if it's not necessarily needed. Good try though.
@Jovangnr @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya How? Fgm is making it so receives no pleasure from sex. Circumcision is not done for that purpose. Nor is it effective at such unless it's botched.
@DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya I never claimed medical purpose. I claimed hygienic. But keep trying to insert your own words into my argument.
Men being dirty isn't a myth. People not washing their privates every few hours isn't a myth. https://t.co/gzVViNSfvd
Men being dirty isn't a myth. People not washing their privates every few hours isn't a myth. https://t.co/gzVViNAE6D
@Jovangnr @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Because people can just treat the infections at home. There's no need to go to the doctor any more for those. Also yes. Women tend to fuck men mostly so it would make sense it affects them most.
@DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya You gonna stick your finger in your child's dickhole? If you want to. Go ahead.
@DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya They're pretty common bro. So common you can get treatments at CVS. But they aren't rampant. Most men in the US are circumcised. Lol
@SummerOffRecord @DecayMedia @ScribeUndead @DrChaya LMAO for what? I'm married, have a kid on the way. My dick works fine, and I don't need that extra half inch. Plus I can shower in the morning and my dick wont smell like a dead man's asshole four hours later. So...yeah.
@DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya I didn't say they require removal. I said if a parent elects to circumcize their son it's their right. Same goes for piercing a child ears.
@DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya It's a religious practice in Judaism for hygienic reasons dipshit. There are no scientific studies on how often men wash their dick, so of course there isn't. Yeast infections are caused by fungus. Dirty dicks have fungus. Common fucking sense.
@SummerOffRecord @circmovie LMAO, I'm not the one making claims there's mountains of evidence men wash the inside of their foreskin.
@DecayMedia @SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya Except FGM was never done for health reasons. Did you know men volunteer for circumcisions when they're teens and adults?
@SummerOffRecord @circmovie Mountains of evidence to prove men was their dick? https://t.co/DoKmChblX1
@SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya That said, I don't think being anti-circumcision is anti-semetic. Just an ideal of someone who clearly doesn't have enough important things to worry about.
@SummerOffRecord @ScribeUndead @DrChaya I mean most circumcisions are done long before a child is able to even comprehend it's happened. It's literally done at the most humane time to do it. It's also cleaner. Idgaf what most men claim, they do not wash inside their foreskin everyday. Like yeast infections?

@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead Possibly.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead Distressed people don't seem to be the best historians. Just saying.
@MicahSimon13 "I can't change your mind. So you're dumb. And don't know anything." And you're a PhD on the subject? Fuck off Tinkerbell. Lol.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead I agree. That's the point. But it seems the rejection was there prior to the transition for most of them.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead That's all based solely on the words of the respondents. The people who are already mentally ill. There's nothing to actually verify that data. The one thing that is confirmed is that for 50% the quality of life doesn't get better.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead I'm not sure where you're getting your facts but, the sources I've looked into show that suicide rates among those transitioned are still very high like 40-50% across countries. That doesn't sound to me like its working. JS.
@MicahSimon13 Sure, I can get behind that. Just don't bitch when people seem to have a problem with your juiced up kid putting theirs into a chokehold. And don't gripe that the school doesnt want to be liable for your daughters bones being broken by male wrestlers.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead But it's not that widely used. This is relatively new as far a "medical treatment" goes.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead You throw around doctor, but call them what they are, psychiatrists. This isn't a "health" doctor this is a "psyche" doctor. The same doctors who dope up kids like Adam Lanza with anti-depressants that fuck them up so bad they shoot up a school full of toddlers.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead From what I've read, it doesn't seem to help that much for most people. There are some exceptions, as there is with everything.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead The fact you've seem to feel justified in your choice now as an adult (or not, I don't know you) is irrelevant.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead The issue, is as a minor I don't think you were old enough to comprehend rationally the decision you were making. Anymore than I would have trusted you to drink alcohol, sign a legally binding contract, drive a car, run a business, lead a country.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead It's not required medical treatment. Especially not at his age. "Accepting them" and putting them on body altering drugs are not synonymous. This is a child not an adult.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead If this were an adult I'd agree with you. But this is a teenager. Just take them off the hormone treatments while competing would be a better option.
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead The whole point of my argument is that she is a biological female going through a transition to appear male. Meaning she is on testosterone supplements and estrogen blockers to place her T levels to that of a male. Offering her a clear advantage over her competitors.
@MicahSimon13 @Vjekiii @shoe0nhead That's just it. These are children, they shouldn't be given any of this shit while they're body is developing. Adults on the other hand, I couldn't give two shits what they do.
@jemalistrash I found it to be boring. Reminded me of film school. After watching it I just wished people would stop trying to be clever and just try to tell a good story. A bunch of clever shots, but ultimately a bunch of nothing happened.
@MicahSimon13 @Vjekiii @shoe0nhead not to the point of a man whose grown up his whole life with it. There is still a difference. In the majority of cases, there's always exceptions to the rule. In high school among minors biological f should compete with bio f, and the same for men. Among consenting adults fuck it
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead Treating it isn't enabling it. You don't treat it by confirming the delusion. Hence why it's considered a Mental Illness. Gender is not a social construct. it's biological. if you're a dude who wants a cunt, boobies, wear a dress and fuck dudes. that's fine. ur still a dude.
@MicahSimon13 @Vjekiii @shoe0nhead No he isn't. He is a biological woman with the T levels of a male. Testosterone is the hormone that makes men physical dominant. He has a clear performance advantage taking the supplements, while still being at a disadvantage wrestling in a mens league. due to his skele being f
@qubitstudios @dzchan @shoe0nhead That makes no sense at all. I'm not going to even begin to get entangled into the mental gymnastics it took for you to come up with that.

@RubinReport https://t.co/e0AkVDJ6wt
@PhotonicFab @overlordjebus @JUMPINGXSHONEN @shoe0nhead That's because regardless of T levels "his" bone structure is that of a woman's. His bone density is still that of a woman's. He is still a HUGE liability to fight in a men's league. Especially at this age. Just take her off the supplements and blockers. Boom. No more issue.
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead Likely not, but that's just it. No MORE enhancement. Stay there, then do what you want when you're 18 and graduated. LOL
@PhotonicFab @overlordjebus @JUMPINGXSHONEN @shoe0nhead A woman taking testosterone to reach the levels of a male, is far above naturally occurring is it not? In a league dominated by women with the T levels of women would you not agree having the T levels of a male would be and advantage in performance?

@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead Well if shes not on any blockers and supplements (*cough* steroids*cough*) and she's still winning? What's the issue? She's just good. There are male athletes who dominate their competition all the time without supplements, nobody tells them to go compete with the lions. lol
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead But I'm aware I'm likely in the minority with that.
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead I disagree, the brain isn't fully developed until you're 25. For the time being she should continue to compete in the female league, just during competition not take her hormone blockers and whatnot. (preferably I'd prefer that being prohibited entirely until at least 18.)
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead Among adults sure. I'd prefer they keep it out of high school.

@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead Now if they placed some sort of contract that she consensually signed knowing the risks agreeing not to hold anyone else liable....ooof. It be one of those hard to look away situations for me. lol
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead That's fine. However because the bone density and structures are different her risk factor is way higher. Insurance companies ain't going to cover that. LOL. I'm not saying she shouldn't be allowed to compete in her own league. Just that she shouldnt be on treatments during comp.
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead 1. That wasn't a "penis" it was an enlarged clitoris that looked like a penis.	2. This man is not really a man. She will always have the bone density of a woman, produce the hormones of a woman, never get a woman pregnant. Because you cant change your biology. At least not yet.
@Vjekiii @shoe0nhead This one IS transitioning so....
@Vjekiii @shoe0nhead Just because she could have, doesn't mean she did. And since when does highschool wrestling catch National public eye? Plenty of champs in all 50 states male and female. Probably with better score cards. This one is special because they won the championship twice? https://t.co/eXT9Dg3tdV
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead You can't just grow a penis. That's not how it works. Her clitoris may enlarge, but that's not a dick.
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead What I'm getting at is she may not be doing enhancement steroids, but she is on treatment to make her make. The testosterone is what gives men their muscle mass and strength advantage over females and WHY they have separate leagues. She is essentially a flyweight dude fighting f.
@dybll @A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead Your penis shrinks while on steroids because your body produces more estrogen to balance out the massive influx of testosterone. Same for growing breasts. They need testosterone to effectively transition to male. They are effectively on steroids.
@Vjekiii @shoe0nhead You can't transition without hormone treatment. She needs testosterone to get the thicker body hair, size and deepness to her voice. Surgery can't give here these things. And she wouldn't have made headlines if she wasn't in the  process of transitioning.
@dzchan @shoe0nhead Or you can just keep to the whole "Steroids are illegal" Which is what a MtF competing in womens league is effectively and a FtM has to be taking to transition. They have an unfair advantage in the female league. Here is an idea, how about we stop normalizing gender dysphoria?
@Richy4248 @shoe0nhead 110lb woman vs 110lb woman pumped with testosterone injections and steroids? Evenly matched?
@A_Potato_1 @NathanB03020743 @shoe0nhead Steroids are illegal, regardless of which gender you were actually born as. The rules are being thrown out for the sake of identity politics regardless.
@fuLc_ @LivianLynx @overlordjebus @shoe0nhead Its not "Like someone taking steroids" Someone IS taking steroids and competing. Which is already illegal. But MUh identity politics
@overlordjebus @JUMPINGXSHONEN @shoe0nhead The rules also say steroids are illegal...which a transitioning FtM would be on. She still has the same advantage a MtF would have over them. She shouldn't be allowed to wrestle while under those treatments.
@Xaxitabian @shoe0nhead @Mr_G_W Yeah, she can't transition without steroids and testosterone injections. She has a clear unfair advantage, that is illegal. It doesn't matter she was born female. It shouldn't matter she is becoming a dude.
@shoe0nhead She shouldn't be allowed to wrestle because she is on STEROIDS!!!!! she has to be otherwise she wont transition. Last I checked Steroids are a big no no in sports regardless of gender.

@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom according to your source the fourth highest paying job for a philosophy major, is a Political Scientist. üòÇ
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom Discussing philosophy was never the intention of my tweet, so of course I didn't demonstrate any.  With the exception of perhaps marketing, you're qualified for the same jobs with a poli-sci degree, so yes it's useless along the same lines.
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom But again, I haven't dismissed philosophy. I dismissed the usefulness of a major in philosophy. Perhaps if you spent less time trying to sound clever, this wouldn't be lost on you, even after it's been repeated several times now.

RT @Cade_Onder: Damn cretins. https://t.co/mab0YVnEiE
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom I know what you said, I can read. The whole point of original post was that majoring in philosophy, poli-sci, and gender studies was ultimately useless, and later that it was pretentious. "you do major in philosophy you are specializing in philosophy" no shit!? ergo "Pretentious"
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom Right. I understand this. You still have not proven you need to major in philosophy to understand this. Only that you should read philosophy, to which I expressed no disagreement.

@wilderpeopIe I can understand why teenage girls like it. It's adults who like it that have me confused. Fortunately I've only met like 2 of them.
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom I don't disagree, my whole point is the philosophy degree is virtually useless because it serves a purpose that can already be achieved by simply selecting no major at all.
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom But the entire idea of a major is a focus in study....I don't see how that is intended for "well rounded."
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom I think I can agree that it should. But at least from my observations, that's rarely been the case. I won't say that philosophy courses don't have their place, or their use, but I disagree that a bachelors is for well rounded education. If they were, why major at all?
@EthanVanSciver The sad part is, destroying the narrative doesn't work. They just double down on it. It isn't about people or inclusion for them it's about control. They want control they are too weak to take and they are throwing tantrums.

@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom That is what it's communicating. Arguing what skills it provides changes nothing about the fact there are still better degrees to prepare you for these positions and the actual labor statistics according to them, show this. https://t.co/4YDThfCe0F
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom Based on the actual Labor statistics...but you know. "Critical thinking"
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom Maybe if you majored in something useful you could actually understand what that site is telling you. It's a preparation degree. It provides "skills" for these entry level jobs. Which even they show and inform there are better degrees to prepare you for those jobs.
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom https://t.co/F2clQPPzX0  could come up with reasons why you should major in the game pogs if there was a degree for it. I stand by results..not the brooding of people who refuse to acknowledge how full of shit they are lol.
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom Lol, I was among the pothead crowd in college. Everyone and their mother was a philosophy/polisci major. If not that, some form of liberal arts. And it's easy to find out (classified shit excluded obv) who was hired over you and their credentials now days.
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom If you know people personally who managed to do so with just a philosophy degree, it's probably more a credit to them than their degree. And if the only use your degree can muster is to potentially better prepare you for another...its useless, my friend.
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom LOL. I don't know anyone with a philosophy degree whose managed to score any of the jobs you've listed. In fact they've lost all of them to accountants, business majors, psychology, lol graphic artists.
@JeanPaulZodeaux @KristinBoymom What makes this more amusing is you think that rebukes my claim a philosophy degree is useless. When in fact it just emphasizes my point.

Then pushes for policies to keep them broke, while promising the world to them, then they donate more money to him. He stays comfortable while the rest stand in their own feces blaming Republicans and anyone else who doesn't want to give them free shit for their situation.
Because they thrive on desperation. They need people to suffer so they can pedal their phony moral agenda. It's a tactic to stay employed. Just look at @BernieSanders.

@brianmikell @Valentine213 @MelissaakaMom @Josh_Moon She's right. I will be. ;) We know our state ain't perfect. We don't want welfare which is why we don't give to anyone without children. We don't even give out food stamps here unless you prove you work. Our health costs have gone up to $400 a month.

@SenMarkey @Ocasio2018 No we don't. We need efficient reliable and cheap energy. Your New Green scam will provide none of that. But it will certainly make you and your friends richer and @Ocasio2018 is so dumb she'll cheer you on as it happens. Going "look what I did!". We don't want a 600 util bill.

@brianmikell @MelissaakaMom @Josh_Moon Dude the median hourly rate means jack shit when you compare it to the cost of living, compare it to somewhere like Ocasio's home state. Where a studio apt costs you 2000/month and that's somewhere like White Plains, not NYC.
@MelissaakaMom @Josh_Moon I live in Huntsville too. There are 200,000 on Obamacare? Yeah sorry no, I'm going to have to see some sources on that bullshit number deary.

@MelissaakaMom @Josh_Moon No we don't. That's why we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, NASA, Toyota, LG, Boeing, and more. We don't vote for someone to take our money only to return it back in the form of something I never wanted. Buhbye

@charlesarthur Uhhh she ran her campaign on the policies she plans to legislate for. Am I to not expect her to push for these things now that she's won?
@charlesarthur She's put a lot of effort into looking foolish, but none into any actual planning with her policies. She'd have better answers than "you just pay for it." She just spits out popular talking points. Shuffles the deck and repeats. And yes, she's good at it. I'll give her that.
@charlesarthur Eeeeh, not really. Voters had two options...vote for this young moderately pretty woman promising us free shit on other people's dime or Joe Crowley whom most people on the street (likely) knew nothing about. If she was anywhere but where she was, it would be impressive. But alas
@charlesarthur So?...her party affiliation is what guaranteed her win. Seriously look at the history of representatives for her district in the last 50 years. All blue my man. All blue.

RT @stillgray: Imagine my shock. https://t.co/XOdYhz0n60
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 because that is the government's job. To provide security for the nation. It's job is not to be your nannny and feed you, clothe you, and pay for your doctor visits. That's your job.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 "as well as laws against killing the rich" They also protect whiney poor people who think they're entitled to the rich's money and services, from being killed by the rich. The rich also pay the majority of those taxes btw.
@ArtistBobStone @Disney @Marvel @NasserRabadi13 @Cap_White @bettieb I doubt he'd cuck himself to those editors, and Kathleen Kennedy.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 Yes! Taxes! Exactly. IE FORCED COERCION
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 Nothing is free. It comes through the cost of taxation. Which is a form of extortion.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 No you are not. Otherwise there would be no homeless people. And most prisons are privately owned. So no it's not free. You just think it is.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 You're advocating for the country to be forced to pay for your healthcare and you claim I'm the one with sociopathic tendencies. It's you who lacks reason. Do you work for free?
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 I also imagine, that if your boss just decided that they were no longer going to pay you, you'd quit your job, yes?
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 Yes they do, they do not however, entitle me to get people to provide services to me for free. IE I do not have a right to free groceries, I do not have a right to live on someone's land without paying for it, I do not have the right to force a doctor to provide me with care.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 If she did not want to, she could have had an early term abortion, or placed me up for adoption.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 Again. There is a difference between mutual and voluntary exchange and forced coercion. My mother was not strong armed into caring for me. She chose to do that.

Would I agree that some percentage is reckless. Yes. Take every social program, add it up. And there is your answer.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 Yes exactly. But that's the point. Those funds can go anywhere which is why they don't matter when talking budget. Let's say we take all of the money and put it towards ocasio's plan. You still have 29.2 trillion to come up with. Shes yet to say how. Just dodges the question.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 Secondly. The issue with using the discretionary budget for your example is that this spending changes. As none of is  required spending. Medicare, is.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 Recklessly, is an opinion. One you're entitled to of course but one one everyone shares. The bottom line is National defense is the government's job. Social issues are not.
@ubiqunity @dgradost @Ocasio2018 You can use the link dumbass already provided. It's 15 percent of federal spending.

@dgradost @Ocasio2018 Thirdly, that 610 billions vs. 30 Trillion for her "Medicaid for all." Which we know where the money comes from. Taxes. The question is answered everytime it's asked. Taxes. Taxes. Taxes. Where is her 30 trillion going to come from? I already know the answer. And I say fuck off

@StarwarskillerB @DDayCobra It wasn't the film making that was garbage, but the editing, imo. Most of that was due to unnecessary cuts, and the PG-13 rating.  The final boss fight was meh, I'll give you that. I'm hoping for an R rated director's cut that will alleviate most of those problems.
@DDayCobra It has its flaws, but it's certainly better than most movies lately. It was refreshing to see a superhero movie with 0 social justice drivel and just focused on what it was supposed to be about.

@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "Why should a few thousand people get most of it, while billions who are born into poverty get exploited?" Perhaps those in poverty should learn to play the game of life properly and they could buy some.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "There‚Äôs a finite supply of land and natural wealth" Yes...exactly which is why it's worth something...you're catching on.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 So then why not print more money to pay the trillions in debt to other countries? The Treasury has the ability to do this. Why don't they?
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "The market is not an even playing field" LOL it isn't supposed to be. Hence the word "competition" You get no participation medals in adulthood my friend. This is nature. Sorry.

@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 No one holds a gun to their head forcing them to work for the amount..Socialism, on the other hand does exactly that.

@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 And their wallets fatter with $100 bills worth no more than 5 bucks
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 Printing more money just creates an artificial increase. It has no more spending power than it did before. You just end up making things cost more. The prices will continue to rise, while people become poorer and poorer.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "You think people will start going to the doctor for fun, because it‚Äôs free?" Their reasoning doesn't matter. The demand increases, with no increase to the cost, thus the ability to pay for supply diminishes.

@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 The incentive dies, and the people either leave, or get sent to gulags for dropping out of the system.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "As long as there is enough economic activity demanding money to facilitate it" This wont happen under socialism, because everything becomes fixed and artificial. Those who work harder won't get paid more. Those who produce more won't get paid more. Thus, your whole plan, fails.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 Your money needs to be backed by something in order for it to have value. You can't just keep printing, Venezuela did that...they're eating out of the trash now.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "Why would hospitals suddenly stop having funding for equipment?"  You think people would go to the hospital at the same frequency they do now if it suddenly became free? The demand would go up, but the cost wouldn't thus, the funding would drop.

@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 The problem with socialism is eventually you WILL run out of someone else's money.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 They'd likely see the highest increase, as they would be the only places left to provide vital surgeries because they'd also be the only place with enough funding to have the right equipment. The others would simply leave the country.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "the only doctors who‚Äôd see significant pay cuts would be some of those  who own their own practices. Total reimbursements would only go down by  like ~10%; aren‚Äôt you conservatives into trimming fat?" No they wouldn't.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "We should be subsidizing vital education as well. " We already do, it's called public school. And we currently have a swath of teachers on strike complaining they are underfunded and underpaid. None of those teachers work at Charter Schools.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "And how many doctors would prefer to work in a system where they don't ration care?" Why don't you go ask your doctor how cool he'd be to be getting paid less to provide you with care he spend upwards to $100000 learning how to provide.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 "What's stopping us from just creating more money to match their current compensation?" Because by creating more money the value of that money becomes less....have you taken basic high school economics?

@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 With your proposed action, doctors will end up getting paid less, thus providing less insentive to go into the medical field. Those that still do, will spend their time going on strikes, much like the underpaid teachers working in public schools. Patients wont get tended to.
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 Far more rational? No you're not. You're bullying doctors into treating you using the government as your strong arm, because you don't want to pay what they say their service is worth. EMTALA is one of the many things causing the increasing cost of healthcare. https://t.co/UbINgE4xCn
@PapaDocStrunsee @cdbrzezinski @Ocasio2018 No actually. when you can't pay, that bill gets footed to the premiums of those who have insurance. IE exactly what you dumb fucks want. The wealthy paying for your shit because you suck at life.
@stillgray Reminds me of a Kat Williams joke. "Ladies, Stop running around saying  Ni$$@s ain't shit. What you mean to say is all the Ni$$@s you  fuck with, ain't shit. You need to find what it is 'bout your pussy that  keep attracting ain't shit Ni$$@s."

It is also illegal for these bills to affect your credit. Try using facts and not memes. You'll look less like an idiot.

@mrfeelswildride So many other sub based MMOs died while WoW continued on strong, and with mobile games becoming popular the lootboxes seemed the way to go. It's the only model that can possibly make you as much money if not more than the subscription model.
@mrfeelswildride People come and go with WoW. But the core is still there and I'm afraid Blizzard has absolutely no idea how to advance this IP further, or purely just move away from it. No MMO game has lasted this long, it's almost 15 years old and still has at least 1 million active accounts.
@mrfeelswildride This is why I don't play Overwatch, Hearthstone, or Heroes of the Storm, and F2P games in general. The issue is everyone is trying to find their way to compete with World of Warcraft's successful sub model. The only game I've seen do this even slightly is FF XIV.

@digital_bread @WLMocksfield @HardcorePraxis @DcycloneN @TheTransMenace @Ocasio2018 and Communism would do nothing to aid these people, as it would ensure that no focus would go to those areas at all, given they'd have their own comrades to provide for. Your Globalist Utopia is impossible. Sorry for you.
@digital_bread @WLMocksfield @HardcorePraxis @DcycloneN @TheTransMenace @Ocasio2018 I have. None of them provide any actual link to capitalism being the cause to the deaths other than "because it's not profitable to save them." But the fact remains these death numbers are gathered from countries that do not have capitalism as well as those who do (probably)
@HardcorePraxis @DcycloneN @WLMocksfield @digital_bread @TheTransMenace @Ocasio2018 Except no it isn't.
@DaniyarRay @WLMocksfield @HardcorePraxis @DcycloneN @digital_bread @TheTransMenace @Ocasio2018 People want to run to the country that bombs them. Makes total sense.
@digital_bread @WLMocksfield @HardcorePraxis @DcycloneN @TheTransMenace @Ocasio2018 Talking about Flynt? How about you go look at who the elected officials are there. Then get back to me.

@wherewolfmom @TheTransMenace @Ocasio2018 What happens to you if you evade taxes?
@AndrewSnarks @Ocasio2018 They go to jail, my friend. Explain to me how this is not literally the definition of extortion.
@AndrewSnarks @Ocasio2018 And what if people refuse to pay the tax? What then?
@cookmichaelv13 @AndrewSnarks @Ocasio2018 I probably wouldn't use the roads if it wasn't against the law to drive through peoples yards to get where I need to go. Oh well.
@AndrewSnarks @Ocasio2018 How will you get the money for "Affordable Healthcare"
@TheTransMenace @WLMocksfield @Ocasio2018 So don't buy it.....
@TheTransMenace @BMCARanind @AvenidaDe1aPaz @Ocasio2018 No it isn't.  And they were never "giving" anything. It was being taken. Get this through your head. Taxes are gained by extortion.
@AvenidaDe1aPaz @TheTransMenace @Ocasio2018 I'm not. I'm saying it's robbing millionaires. It's robbing whomever you are taking it from you knob.
@TheTransMenace @BMCARanind @AvenidaDe1aPaz @Ocasio2018 You are not "handing out" anything with tax cuts. You are TAKING LESS. Get it right.

@AndrewSnarks @Ocasio2018 OR....follow me on this one. You find a way for revenue that doesn't involve the extortion of your citizens. I dunno that's just me though.
@TheTransMenace @Ocasio2018 Well yeah, sorry you are going to have less money when you stop taking it by force from people. It IS an inherent side effect.
@Ocasio2018 Tax cuts don't cost anything, it's just not taking people's money.
