@jackieraimo @mariannanash Amen. Let people think and finish their thoughts. Reporters - me included - are falsely whipped up into such frenzies these days. Slow down. Breathe. And MOST importantly: Let then breathe and finish their thoughts. Because hopefully you‚Äôre also making them think too

@ThatGuy36790989 @AlisonHStewart @Acosta Ha. Truth!!!!!!!!
@mariannanash And that doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them. It means I heard them. That‚Äôs the key. And then I‚Äôll usually sum up their thinking, which makes them hear me saying their own thoughts back so then they think I‚Äôm on their team. When really, it‚Äôs a question: Did I hear you correctly?
@mariannanash You just listen. I listen &amp; nod slightly to Rs, Ds &amp; those off the political charts. I do it because I started as a public radio reporter, so you can‚Äôt talk over your audio.

@tigerlily7a Was so hard counting them!
Are you trying to push some of your former Republican colleagues on this? 	‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a lobbyist. I don‚Äôt lobby at all,‚Äù Boehner said, still puffing his cigarette
‚ÄúYou know they‚Äôve been using this plant 4,000 years, and there‚Äôs a lot of anecdotal evidence but because it‚Äôs a Schedule 1 narcotic there‚Äôs no real solid research,‚Äù Boehner continued. ‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs do the research and find out.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen this company started talking to me, I still didn‚Äôt think I was going to get involved in it, but I just thought, 'I‚Äôll do a little more research,'" Boehner said. "I decided that, you know, I think I‚Äôm going to lend my voice to this discussion"
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôd run into all kinds of people who would talk to me about their use of cannabis for this issue or that. I talked to some veterans, older people, parents with kids that have had seizures,‚Äù Boehner continued
Was it economic reasons that brought you to that position? 	‚ÄúNo. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I just kind of found myself like a lot of Americans beginning to look at this differently as the states began to approve this one after another,‚Äù Boehner said
What are you doing on the board? I‚Äôve been intrigued by your work on this‚Ä¶ 	‚ÄúI just think the federal laws are outdated. They‚Äôre in the way of what the states are doing, and it‚Äôs time for the feds to kind of wake up and get with it,‚Äù Boehner replied
This am @CoryBooker is dropping the Marijuana Justice Act so I asked Boehner his thoughts on it: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt look at bills anymore,‚Äù he said through a hearty laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the board of a cannabis company‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be briefed on it soon.‚Äù
Naturally I asked Boehner if he‚Äôs ever smoked weed: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never used it. I drink red wine and smoke cigarettes - I‚Äôve got my own vices.‚Äù

First for a Happy Birthday during a State of the Union address? First in my time
I tweeted about abortion and there goes my timeline for the rest of the night
Bipartisan applause: Combatting AIDS 	Bipartisan applause: Tackling childhood cancer 	Then Trump pivots to abortion and blows up all good will
Democrat‚Äôs jaws about went through the chqmber floor when Trump (falsely) claimed a historic drop in drug prices
Trade policy is such a beautiful issue cause it cuts across normal partisan lines, which was on display as Dems cheered and stood with Trump as many Repubs sat it out
@MordecaiMpls Which one?
Where‚Äôs the after party ladies?
First high fives, celebration or whatever that was that I‚Äôve witnessed inside the House chamber in my 12 years here
Just not getting the feeling, from all the scowls and frowns on Democrat‚Äôs faces, that Trump is changing any minds on the wall with this #sotu speech
@radm29 Perf
Both @CoryBooker and @KamalaHarris reluctantly stood and clapped for the ICE agent Trump brought tonight, but neither smiled doing it
No standing or clapping from @AOC when Trump highlighted an ICE agent
@cgrieco1 Meh. Grassley and Grover would beg to differ
We‚Äôre at the Corey Stewart part of the address
Dems weren‚Äôt buying Trump‚Äôs take on caravans coming towards southern border but when he praised immigrants contributions to America @timkaine was one of the first to clap loudly and stand before most rest of party did
For years the bill maintained huge bipartisan support from across the ideological spectrum, just needed McConnell to give it floor time
On criminal justice reform Trump added the ‚Äúthey said it couldn‚Äôt be done‚Äù line, because literally no one said that
The last GOP Congress didn‚Äôt train Trump very well on the whole separation of powers thing

Hey @igorbobic - see the facial hair that Buzz Aldrin is rocking?
The speakers inside the House chamber sound terrible. How‚Äôs it sound at home?
For the first bipartisan applause line @AOC stood and clapped for the second half while two seats down @EleanorNorton sat scowling

Melania Trump gently clapped for about 5 seconds upon Trump‚Äôs entrance into the House chamber for the #SOTU with one hand in a black glove and the other bare showing a blinding diamond

Jared Kushner was just in the same row as me inside the House chamber but 10 people away. Then he left before I could pass a note down to him with ‚Äúyes‚Äù / ‚Äúno‚Äù boxes to circle

University of Maryland is closed tomorrow, but that does this professor no good because my course there doesn't start until the end of the month. The winter weather gods are the worst. And never forget that professors love snow days too!
@mathewlenning What was my talking point? Who else is discussing ‚Äúoutlawing‚Äù shutdowns as an actual proposal - and not just a talking point? Have your wall. Not at all what my message was even about.

@doc_holley @Cernovich Government programs overlap and a partial shutdown for 25% of it ripples across the other 75% of it - https://t.co/ZXcp4o5qkG https://t.co/PAJcXWuQZW
@IHeartSully @Cernovich I hate both political parties and think many parts of Obamacare are shit (in case you cared about my opinion, and not just the tired talking points you seem to have tattooed on your perpetually closed eyelids. Just open your eyes. The real world isn‚Äôt as scary as you think)
@IHeartSully @Cernovich Take your talking points and shove them up a close friend‚Äôs ass. Hopefully they punch you afterwards, as my boy who is fucking dying would do even with his limp lifeless arms, so I don‚Äôt have to.
@DeeATee1 @Cernovich @CNN Amen. And they‚Äôre actually testing new drugs on my buddy (but fuck big pharma, unless one of those drugs works! But told that‚Äôs not in the cards)
@Scottgas2 @Cernovich Emergency units are open. Hear the rest is shuttered. And last reporting I read was that new emergency patients aren‚Äôt being admitted.
@insidebrian Heterosexuals have anal sex too. And heterosexuals are supposed to wear condoms too. Who are you? Why are you so small minded? And why am I talking to you when I should be crying? Can I get back to my sorrow now?
@Merz @Scottgas2 @Cernovich I know. But no new patients. Also have heard many parts of the NIH campus are shuttered, but I was there on a weekend so I can‚Äôt verify.
He also has a great, witty sense of humor so I wrote him a card that said: BREAKING NEWS - New study by NIH shows you‚Äôre now allowed to fuck cancer in the ass without a condom. He loved it.
Unexpectedly wrote a mini-thread entitled: Government Shutdowns Should be Outlawed https://t.co/ZhblYxdEry
@Dannyhoadley On this we agree üíØ: Don‚Äôt pay the fucking politicians who gave themselves a long weekend off even as they shutdown large swaths of the government over a petty political spat
Government shutdowns should be outlawed in America; just as they are in most other countries.
‚ÄúNIH will likely stop admitting new patients for the duration of the shutdown,‚Äù @CNN. So other people like my bud whose last breathes have the power to help change the world are now being forced to die at home alone, without even allowing science to help extend their legacies
But the study they‚Äôre doing on him can potentially save thousands of lives in the future. So he‚Äôs a guinea pig. But one leaving us with the potential to have a legacy that will be felt by millions (even more so than some of the amazing videos he‚Äôs shot over the years).
Government shutdowns should be outlawed. Just left the bedside of a terminally ill friend at NIH. My buddy can‚Äôt be saved, but he was admitted because his body built up an immunity to his chemo pills. It‚Äôs rare.

Also, @seanspicer please DM me. I lecture on your 1st press conference at White House - that one where you lied you so gracelessly (some say embarrassingly, but I never saw you get red) about the size of Trump‚Äôs inauguration crowd size. So many questions for your straight face!

Context: the two were walking together after leaving a press conference and I asked Booker a question for the marijuana story I'm penning for @RollingStone this eve and not @RoKhanna (will get you for my next story good sir!)
"You're letting Ro go away on a marijuana question? He's the marijuana man!" @CoryBooker joked about @RepRoKhanna earlier
****if the Australians come for your guns then freak out! But also be calm, we have a pretty damn stout military with bigger guns than you - or most nations
@RaisedRightMT @VICE INFRASTRUCTURE!!!!!! I still have hope
@bonhogue Maybe!
***Australians want all your guns***
**Also, when they passed the assault weapons ban in the nineties anyone who had a legal assault weapon pre-ban was able to keep their gun. Democratic lawmakers who I interact with regularly on this issue don‚Äôt want to confiscate guns, or at least are too weak to say it publicly
*the serious gun control proposals out there don‚Äôt involve anything near confiscating guns, though some progressives would surely welcome want that. I just strongly doubt anyone who holds that position will ever be president in my lifetime.
Truly intriguing watching this line suddenly emerge from conservatives. 		What they mean is ‚Äúan emergency declaration is unconstitutional and sets a dangerous precedent.‚Äù 		But they‚Äôre conservatives and know their readers, so they‚Äôre using liberals taking guns as a scare tactic. https://t.co/pvSPt0SRLg

This is some ignorant ass bullshit from @SnoopDogg. He‚Äôs accusing most federal employees of being partisan. That‚Äôs offensive to the very nature of having a federal bureaucracy filled with (mostly) a-political, dedicated public servants who serve the Constitution and all of us
@BGPublic We gotta get a beer!!!
@brainylainie Well then. Was going to write a thought, but will save it for someone who wants to have a discussion
Was asked so I delivered a BRIEF reading list. Thread below with my top 10 recommendations to help anyone understand how Washington got so terrible (hint: It's always been terrible but today's lawmakers tend to be more petty, tribal and reality TV based than their predecessors) https://t.co/SzH4oMY3M3
@WilsonCBaldwin 10) Extra Credit BONUS!  	I also have my students read Trump‚Äôs The Art of the Deal and Machiavelli‚Äôs The Prince and compare and contrast the two (Do it. Trump‚Äôs not the idiot the left paints him as. He‚Äôs cunning and calculated, even if unpolished and unconventional)
@WilsonCBaldwin 9) Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ‚Äò72, by Hunter S. Thompson (sip a few stiff ones or smoke whatever and just melt into this one like the acid dripping from every page)
@WilsonCBaldwin 7) The Constitution. (This is actually number one; ten crack commandments all...). Everyone in this  town should also have a copy of it near them at all times AND should read it annually. 	8) Same goes for the Federalist Papers
@WilsonCBaldwin 6) Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition, by Okrent (tale of  most powerful lobbying movement in US history: Suffragettes had to secure right to vote before they could enact one of the most sweeping social and societal reforms ever. And gangsters!!! Exciting and fun read)
@WilsonCBaldwin 5) The Cult of the Presidency, by Gene Healy (Cato book so libertarian  AF. Provides great understanding of how members of both parties are terrible because they‚Äôve collectively ceded war powers to presidents of both parties, even as the founders gave Congress that power)
@WilsonCBaldwin 4) The Broken Branch, by Mann and Ornstein (dated, but their thesis holds: The contemporary Congress is terrible)
@WilsonCBaldwin 3) A Magnificent Catastrophe: The Tumultuous Election of 1800 America‚Äôs First Presidential Campaign, by Larson (the main lecture I deliver about 10 times a year starts with a quote from Solomon: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing new under the sun.‚Äù There was never a ‚ÄòGood ole days‚Äô folks...)
@WilsonCBaldwin Prof. Laslo‚Äôs Required Reading List (for politicos): 	1) The House, by Robert Remini (easy intro to the House with fun, random and some raw facts sprinkled throughout) 	2) Master of the Senate, by Robert Caro (No words. Read. It. Yesterday!)

@jules_su And the vote actually didn‚Äôt happen til like 30 minutes later than my initial tweet. My initial ‚Äú10 minutes‚Äù was actually being kind to her. Pardon me. I won‚Äôt make that mistake again.
@jules_su Just seeing this. You‚Äôre welcome to come shadow me for a day at the Capitol. No one gets there 10 mins early for votes. Not even @AOC - and she wasn‚Äôt there for early for the vote. She may have misspoke but she wasn‚Äôt there early for the vote. She said that to dodge questions.

Just to be clear people: she said this more than 10 minutes before the first vote while 10 feet away from the House floor. The first vote in a series is 15 mins (though often held open longer), so that gave her at least 25 mins to cast her first vote. But facts are the worst

@RicardoAQuinto @BetoORourke Well played sir!
@shamasi1968 @BetoORourke It‚Äôs out there. It‚Äôs just drowned out by a lot of meaningless nonsense, especially on cable which I call InfoTainment networks. But the struggle is to stay relevant and gain younger or new readers we all need social media followings. It‚Äôs become a necessary evil to stay relevant
@shamasi1968 @BetoORourke You would actually like my lectures. I teach on the history of partisanship and explore how the media has and is playing a role in it...
The new year is heavy. Within 24hrs I already mansplained my job to someone angry at me on Twitter for telling a joke that she thinks highlights the downfall of journalism - on top of being a bad joke (her opinion). Did 2018 teach me nothing!?! https://t.co/XwLetbIkZG
@shamasi1968 @BetoORourke Politicians say things. Reporters write them down &amp; then share them. When politicians universally repeat things in elections over time, good reporters note the historic trend &amp; alert their audience of what to look out for in the future. Because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing new under the sun‚Äù
@shamasi1968 Hawkeyes or Nebraska?
@AlexThomasDC Just did. Look at who I‚Äôm dealing with in my comments - like I just insulted a deity (Btw, do you know if he‚Äôs Muslim or has a birth certificate? We should break those stories together...)
@shamasi1968 @BetoORourke I said Rebellion. I was rebellious as hell &amp; I encourage my students to push the envelope. You‚Äôre reading a lot into a joke grounded in the reality of midwestern politics. I‚Äôm from Chicago. Whether the mayor is a Cubs or a Sox fan matters for politicians there. Same thing
@shamasi1968 @BetoORourke Why did you call his child traitorous? Did you see my question marks? If Beto is a Packers fan that doesn‚Äôt bode well in other midwestern states. Who knows how many votes it would cost him, but politicians pander to sports teams for a reason. Look at Obama, Hillary and...sigh...
My New Years resolution is to teach Beto Bros how to take a joke. I have a feeling I will die on this hill. https://t.co/y1NF4u57S9

@phlubup Did you see the question marks in my tweets...sigh. 		? = a question
@DamienTutt @BetoORourke Teams matter in politics. Ask any politician. Any.
@phlubup He‚Äôs from Texas. They have lots of teams. That‚Äôs rebellion, unless Beto or his are too. Also I came from a Cubs family in Chicago and was a Sox fan from like 9-13 or so. It was outward rebellion! I know from experience how sports politics in families go

@sarahnferris Huh. Like 5 officers have brought it up to me.
@TheTysonsCorner The president - any president - can fire any cabinet official without cause. I get the criticism and the fear, but it‚Äôs well within his authority.
The Capitol Hill Police force is fully funded in this shutdown BUT the agency that writes them their checks (some tell me it‚Äôs the National Finance Center) isn‚Äôt funded. So the officers serving this dysfunctional Congress over this holiday weekend don‚Äôt know when they‚Äôll get paid
@byelin Alright. We each scored a point in that round!
Exactly. The constant ‚Äòthe sky is falling‚Äô narrative that accompanies everything Trump does has caused many Republicans and some Independents to tune any criticisms out.

Actual reporting is always better than sitting in an office and copying and pasting tweets and recording soundbites (interviews inform you). Our jobs will become automated if an article like this becomes the norm. And actually, a machine would have likely done a better job  6/6
Don‚Äôt be lazy. I interviewed nearly a third of the Senate today and all of them had more interesting quotes and better context than Trump‚Äôs tweets, which were misleading at best 5/6
Be fair to all sides. Not a single Democrat is quoted in the piece; merely a summation of what Schumer said is tossed in as an afterthought but without an actual direct quote. Though they quote McConnell, so the piece is all GOP quotes. Lopsided and misleading 4/6
Don‚Äôt be a megaphone for anyone. The piece quotes Trump SIX times and embeds two of his tweets, while only quoting one other official (who also happens to be a Republican) 3/6
Don't let public officials frame debates on their terms. In the piece they quote Trump‚Äôs tweet storms from today where he blamed Democrats, but without the crucial context that last week Trump said a shutdown would be on him (after he advocated for one throughout the fall!) 2/6

@SopanDeb @costareports Alcoholism is a disease. I struggle with drinking too much. That doesn‚Äôt mean a professional has ever diagnosed me as an alcoholic and I‚Äôve seen them about it.

@costareports you should delete this and apologize. Unless you talked to Grijalva about it and it came from him - not the guy taking cheap jabs on Twitter who the incoming chairman had called on to resign
It‚Äôs not fair, accurate or decent for a reporter to play doctor, counselor or psychologist. Grijalva was accused by Zinke of being an alcoholic. While he may be one, that doesn‚Äôt mean he is one.

Da. Bears. Defense mother f******!!! Boom.
@Tmh_langilawsis @tins1222 @Ocasio2018 @TheAtlantic Sigh. I actually respect her. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to go easy on her. Ask the lawmakers of both parties who respect me: I go hard on the ones I respect the most. And she‚Äôs tougher than me or you and can defend herself.
@Tmh_langilawsis @tins1222 @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm not a congressmember but if I were I‚Äôd be a lawmaker who turned wine into whiskey
@calvintcummings @byrdinator All that to say, it‚Äôs in AOC‚Äôs hands as to whether she‚Äôs a lawmaker or merely a congressmember (or merely a protestor with a congressional pin who mirrors Cruz from the left)
@calvintcummings @byrdinator That‚Äôs actually a solid joke. Let me unpack it for you: 	1) lawmakers pass laws	2) AOC hasn‚Äôt passed a law 	3) Bernie Sanders has shown flexibility from campaign idealism while in Congress, while AOC hasn‚Äôt had the chance yet she also has shown no flexibility

@Tmh_langilawsis @tins1222 @Ocasio2018 no one uses the term. So it makes anyone who does sound like a fool. That‚Äôs all. And that‚Äôs all.

@akon_bol @AsteadWesley I started this by saying I agree with Astead‚Äôs point. I just called him out for using a flimsy fallacy to support his great point. I‚Äôve called out others for using this fallacy. And will continue to do so because it drives people to their corners and distracts from the problem
@A09845768 @AsteadWesley DM me and I‚Äôll send you a book on logic. Truly. The one I was forced to study in my philosophy courses was so formative in my writing and thinking that I still preach it to this day. The errant pen is mightier than an atom bomb.
Logic is lost on Twitter, so I surrender. I‚Äôm wrong for being right (or, correct, but whatever, you‚Äôre right!) on this medium. But please keep the GIFs coming folks - I‚Äôm poppin popcorn to them this eve https://t.co/dznq7ZPblr
@akon_bol @AsteadWesley That‚Äôs not the question. At. All. But glad a person in a privileged media position can dupe thousands into thinking logical fallacies should replace reason. We deserve Trump as our president. We (ie the press corps) mirror his antics and reasonless world daily on social media.
@MollyJongFast I‚Äôm dead inside but I got some good mentions in the meantime!
@detachment_red @libbycwatson What was stupid? That writers shouldn‚Äôt use logical fallacies? Burn me at the stake!

@libbycwatson Ummmm. Well reasoned argument?
@AsteadWesley There‚Äôs nothing personal here. As I said, my biggest pet peeve is this logical fallacy that wouldn‚Äôt pass a high school debate. I strive to make humanity think outside the box. You have a platform to expand minds; please don‚Äôt squander that while on the couch in one off tweets
I too once refused to engage with professors who brought logical arguments to food fights. Folks, just because people have lots of followers doesn‚Äôt mean a thing.

@AsteadWesley I‚Äôm just saying your question ‚Äúwould they do this if X instead of Y‚Äù is a logical fallacy. Please tell the stories of where they did it! Again, that would be tangible, thus provable, and that makes it more powerful than using a fallacy to make the same point*

@trailhen @emilycrockett @Acosta I‚Äôm joking. I take the role of the press more serious than most, have actually devoted my life to it (2 tattoos on it), lecture on it and am a working reporter.

@emilycrockett @Acosta We should focus on what matters. Trump wants us talking about this. We are b/c Acosta fell into his trap. I'm not saying I agree with the WH at all, but I have a story to write on Jeff Sessions' ouster. I'm going back to focusing on what matters, not a grown man attached to a mic
@alshuey @ericdemamp @RollingStone Criminal justice reform and a raging opioid crisis, so yeah - just trying to help save the lives of millions of Americans plagued by imprisonment for non violent drug offenses or addiction. But yeah, I'm just a silly stoner over here....
A Trumpster gets it: Trump plays the press corps daily. He's created this false narrative that's undermined trust in the press corps. It's worked. And us yelling "we're not fake news Mr. President" or forcefully clutching a mic when the WH obviously wants it back gives them a win https://t.co/vgiWKlvO01
@emilycrockett @Acosta I mostly get pissed at Acosta for inserting himself on what he presents as a righteous mission, that seems aimed at getting him TV hits. All I'm saying is he could have done his job better by giving up the mic and still shouting his questions. There's no need to be petty

@rosen_alexandra @Acosta Who knows. It was likely a trap - Trump wanted to get into it with the press and Acosta took the bait.

@jas_mint @Acosta Why give them the inch? Acosta took the bait. Not my fault he‚Äôs an idiot and fell into the trap POTUS laid for him.

@gato_danger @Acosta Seems to me they both do. And she seems to be going for the mic. As directed by her boss who happens to  also be a dick, though the commander in chief nonetheless
Torn on @Acosta suspension. He‚Äôs a dick, but he‚Äôs allowed to be a dick because of the First Amendment. But just as press staff and politicians shouldn‚Äôt touch reporters, neither should reporters touch press staff.  And that‚Äôs a WH mic. He could have kept asking questions w/out it

@keeFS @PMOrwin @MarkARKleiman @jonfavs I too think we should disband the nation‚Äôs judicial system

This seems below what a Prof should do with their megaphone. But you do you.
@PMOrwin @MarkARKleiman @jonfavs Professor Kleiman, while your tweets help stoke wild rhetoric about ‚Äútraitors‚Äù like this response, my academic work, daily news reporting and general social media presence is usually aimed at trying to calm political passions so people can think outside of the partisan paradigm
@MarkARKleiman @jonfavs I understand the current GOP is going through convulsions that are making my Grandpa spin in his grave. But to dismiss the entire lot of them is exactly why Trump‚Äôs poll numbers aren‚Äôt moving: Rhetoric like this is alienating. I‚Äôd rather see the nation heal; where she still can
@MarkARKleiman @jonfavs ‚ÄúNot a single Republican‚Äù has spoken up is false. ‚ÄúThe GOP is rotten to its core‚Äù isn‚Äôt even worthy of a comment, but here goes: Does that mean every Republican - my dad who opposed Trump and Grandma and brother and friends - are all incapable of doing any good?

@cody_k @jaketapper @Acosta We‚Äôll let‚Äôs just agree to disagree on the role of the press. You seem to want Tapper and Acosta to out do Hannity and Tucker. Cool for you. I don‚Äôt. I want reporting; not editorials. I do editorials and reporting. There‚Äôs a place for each, but they should call it what it is
@cody_k @jaketapper @Acosta I fucking hate what cable ‚Äúnews‚Äù has done to politics. Mind you; you‚Äôre defending CNN which is arguably the network that propelled Trump into the WH. But cool. Let‚Äôs do that again!
I‚Äôll also take any drugs anyone is offering. DM me for that too https://t.co/x7w581HIXb
@cody_k @jaketapper @Acosta Also, what was in that bill? Yeah. Bet you‚Äôre googling it now. Because CNN has us talking about politics; not debating sound policy.
@cody_k @jaketapper @Acosta Fuck a bill sponsor. I‚Äôve never mentioned them in my coverage over 12 years, because I care about the people affected by their bills. Not this reality show drama of who gets a gold star. Good to know you‚Äôre a neocon now!
@cody_k @jaketapper @Acosta Do u know McCain? Have u studied his service and career? He gives two flying fucks whether he gets praised for sponsoring a bill for the military. He cares about the troops, expanding neo-conservatism globally and the military industrial complex. So that‚Äôs what ur endorsing
@cody_k @jaketapper @Acosta My contention is narrowly with this Tapper piece and how CNN publicized it: If Jake were president he would do xxxx. Well if Jake wants to be fucking president he can run for president. If not, become a professor or get a talk show. As is he‚Äôs merely pretending to be a reporter
@cody_k @jaketapper @Acosta I didn‚Äôt say Trump wasn‚Äôt a petty bitch ass. That‚Äôs a different conversation completely.
Any federal workers out there who smoke weed and are willing to talk for a piece on a new bill to protect federal workers who smoke? DM me if so (I'm also on Signal). 100% anonymity guaranteed
@Celticlassy10 Trump‚Äôs base has completely tuned out the mainstream media. Precisely because of made for TV stunts like this.
When did reporter‚Äôs jobs stop being to report? If @jaketapper &amp; @Acosta want to be the news they should run for office. In the meantime they should stop parading their anti-Trump bias over the airwaves, claiming to be independent journalists. The election‚Äôs over. Just cover Trump https://t.co/l6wKzjzmjP
This is gross by CNN. It feeds into Trump‚Äôs false narrative that the press is the enemy. CNN anchors and reporters now feel it‚Äôs their job to write the president‚Äôs speeches.

@beast91670 @PressSec @Acosta Really? Read my op-Ed‚Äôs. I‚Äôm offended as a journalist that Acosta gives them fodder. As a journalist I have not taken the bait from Press Sec and Trump. My response to being dubbed The Enemy: Don‚Äôt make mistakes; do good work; be unimpeachable. I won‚Äôt lower myself to their level
Important Caveat: The exchange with @PressSec was with @Acosta. As a reporter and comms professor he doesn‚Äôt speak for me. He‚Äôs embarrassingly taken Trump‚Äôs bait and it‚Äôs become personal to him. Sanders likely would have responded differently if the question was from anyone else. https://t.co/qIV74uSFrZ

@metGodhiking @Acosta Why? Because he‚Äôs on TV? Same reason Trump is a hero to a lot of people
@AnguaOcean @Acosta Cable isn‚Äôt news. I call them Info-tainment networks. If you get your ‚Äúnews‚Äù from cable you know factoids orbiting what matters. It‚Äôs fine to watch them, if you‚Äôve read numerous papers or magazine article or NPR stories. But if not they just fill your brain with mush.
@AnguaOcean @Acosta Carefully &amp; without grandstanding. One can also look at it this way: CNN played Trump 24/7, basically, during 2015 and 2016 all because they wanted ratings. Well, they got their ratings. Now they can deal with the reality TV outcome, while the rest of us try to pick up the pieces
@AaronMesh @humblebragdotor @Acosta @PressSec Right? ‚ÄúAll Governments Lie,‚Äù or so the title of a good book goes
@humblebragdotor @AaronMesh @Acosta @PressSec I think it‚Äôs terrible. Full stop. That‚Äôs a completely different topic. Let‚Äôs stay on topic.
Just so I‚Äôm completely clear here: @Acosta couldn‚Äôt pass one of my courses if he pulled these made-for-tv stunts in my courses. He‚Äôs turned himself into the butt of this administration‚Äôs jokes about the press corps. He doesn‚Äôt speak for us. He speaks for his own pay day. https://t.co/n4D85a6Yrv
@BearFightDawg @Acosta I‚Äôm in the trenches. Acosta lives in the castle.
Also, watching @Acosta shout questions to the president from the back of the room and then go on cable and ‚Äòreport‚Äô the president didn‚Äôt answer his question isn‚Äôt fake news, it‚Äôs bullshit grandstanding and is deceitful. He‚Äôs not a good reporter anymore. He‚Äôs merely Trump‚Äôs enemy.
This fella @Acosta has become the face of the administration‚Äôs false claim of ‚Äúthe enemy.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be a fool like him and take that bait. He wants ratings and his pay day. His fake tears are a disservice to the nation‚Äôs press corps. Report the news. Don‚Äôt become it.
If one of my J-students ever tells an official ‚ÄúI‚Äù or in this case ‚Äúwe deserve‚Äù something - I call it an @Acosta - instant F. We deserve nothing. Spit on us. Kick us. Even challenge us to a duel like they did at our nation‚Äôs founding. Our audeince deserves everything. We don‚Äôt.
To my journalism students: If you ever pull an @Acosta and ask a question with the words ‚ÄúI think‚Äù that‚Äôs an automatic F. No one cares what a journalist thinks. Audiences consume what you put out because you have access to powerful people. Their thoughts matter. Not yours.
It‚Äôs a gross phrase but as a journalist &amp; professor of comms and journalism I‚Äôm also disgusted by @Acosta - ‚Äúwe deserve that‚Äù and ‚ÄúI think it would be good,‚Äù he lectures, speaking down to the nation‚Äôs press secretary. Shame on him. That‚Äôs not journalism; that‚Äôs for Acosta. https://t.co/Wp07acRNJy
