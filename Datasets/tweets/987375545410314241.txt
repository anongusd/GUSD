I am grossed out by ANY physically violent man or a man that would slip a female a pill without consent. So #metoo at least i have that in common with most of all you all.
because if you think bill cosby don't deserve a blowjob from a fling, you can just go lesbian. ONLY wrong he did was slip pills. i have heard some women say they wish the man they DO want to date would slip them a xanax to loosen them up. so sad.
#metoo let's be crystal clear on something @BillCosby's crime roots to slipping pills in drink.		however, more ladylike to not even go to the man's house to ŪZ him as a stepping stone to selfishly, ADVANCE your career if you won't even suck his dick. all the women were "of age".
