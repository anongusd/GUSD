Great to be there @SenatorNasheed ! https://t.co/ZK2CHMIJ9G
The subpoena excuse is close to the dog ate my homework. Totally bogus. Does the AG’s office expect people to believe that a private lawyer has more power than the Atty General? Embarrassing.
That’s what happens when you don’t actually investigate. An investigation isn’t “they told us they didn’t do anything wrong” AG should have filed suit under 610.027 like the private lawyer who found this out today. Embarrassing that private atty has to do AG’s job. #ladders https://t.co/mEm9wKQiHD
Happy to help! Now you can pull your rabbit out of your hat without a dumb federal regulation getting in your way! https://t.co/HG80Fol7Wp
Totally bogus excuse that he couldn’t subpoena. He could have done exactly what this private attorney did and gotten the information he claims he couldn’t get.
That statute SPECIFICALLY gives the Attorney General the right to bring suit but he refused and this private citizen is doing his job for him. Not good.

At this moment of crisis I'm stunned that Speaker Boehner would stop our Senate bipartisan negotiations. So reckless &amp; dangerous.
Gotta confess, slightly giddy over Mizzou and the Cardinals. Now @KCChiefs slam the Raiders for the trifecta.
Job is very frustrating right now. So sweet to have MO sports on such a roll. #stlcards #ChiefsKingdom #Mizzou

Let House vote on our clean Senate bill to keep govt open.We can &amp; should negotiate by then going to conference on Budget #letHousevote
Our clean bill to keep govt open will pass if Speaker Boehner will allow a vote. #letHousevote

Today my thoughts switch from cliff to cookies, from Senate to shopping, from fiscal fights to family. A temporary relief.
@clairecmc 6 Years of work on war time contracting finally crossed the finish line today! Impt reforms. Will save billions. 🎉🎉yay!
Conservatives preach no federal govt and local control of schools until the NRA wants the federal government to mandate guns in schools?
We can avoid cliff with a balanced approach that will get  Ds and Rs but there are a bunch of extreme Rs that are making it really hard.
