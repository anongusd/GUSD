@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Protecting the constitution is never out of line
@catladyfurever @sammynickalls @darth Same experience with my good boy Bobby about 10 yrs ago. Thank you for bringing back such a warm memory. Just made me cry. I hope Daisy and Bobby are chasing squirrels in the sky.
@SenTedCruz This "Freedom of Education" thing is backward to me. I'm free to teach a child that pigs fly, but I am doing that child no favors by doing so.
@BillOReilly Nobody needs you anymore Bill
@GOP Worked for ya
@CLewandowski_ @MichaelCohen212 You been paying attn?
@ScottWalker @IvankaTrump “Work hard” and “upward mobility” seems to be code for “we are going to fuck you over and blame you for the results”
@BillOReilly Cool Bill, I'll file that under "Things every old dude from every generation says when they realize their time has passed". I'll be there too one day buddy. You are experiencing aging, that's all.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Thats the dumbest thing Ive ever read on twitter. Pure dipshit. Not an easy task. Do you get paid for this? Be the capitalist you claim to be and go invent or start something that contributes to society.
@realDonaldTrump I can't wait for America to be the story again, rather than you.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Is whining about people and opinions that you don’t understand your actual policy to solve our countries problems? Very sick of 3rd graders running the show.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump What’s your plan genius? Sick of you people pointing shit out, as if it’s a skill, and having zero alternatives. Unless your forward moving policy is whining about people and policies you don’t understand.
@realDonaldTrump Hey, if someone loved America but absolutely hated every cell in your body, can they still attend? Not asking for a friend. Asking for me.
@delphi_ote @youngvulgarian @MaxTemkin I get it, but I still prefer to be killed because of my often reprehensible individual actions, rather than my gender.

@JenLeibler @realDonaldTrump The American President is my wife's fav movie of all time. Its a good one!
@realDonaldTrump My fav Presidents: Lincoln, Washington......TRoosevelt, FDR......Peter Sellers, Harrison Ford, Morgan Freeman......Michael Dukakis, Michael Avenetti, Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan......

@CarmineSabia @TuckerCarlson This isn’t about people who succeed on pure merit, and started a business, built something, invented something, discovered something for this country that is truly great. Those people deserve as much wealth as they earn. Thats a small percentage of millionaires though.
@RepMarkMeadows You’ve spent two years defending a coward
@DonaldJTrumpJr It passed a majority vote ass
@LindseyGrahamSC @60Minutes You are a FAILURE
@LindseyGrahamSC @60Minutes Such a partisan hack. McCabe is a problem so Trump isn’t? What if they are both clowns and you are too? I should be able to trust officials. I wouldn’t trust you to take out the trash
@fred_guttenberg @johnpavlovitz You guys are both really good men. Mr Guttenberg, I can not understand whether spreading love is easy or difficult for you during these times. Quite frankly I hope I never understand. But know that you, and your family, are loved by my wife and I.
@fintechfrank @Scaramucci “Poor in America see themselves not as exploited, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires” -attributed to Steinbeck, Guthrie, Wright, probably not a direct quote
@fintechfrank @Scaramucci Only competition makes services better. Privatize both parties and make them compete. A vote should be a purchase of their product for the next term. Capitalize ideology! ( This is sarcasm and also isn’t)
@benshapiro You are very insecure about her Ben. Why? If she is an idiot little girl then why Ben?
@larrymoejoe @AOC Yup
@FiveThirtyEight It was strange considering the obvious. Rs have around the same number of females in congress as in 1980, Ds had around 13 in 1980 and somewhere in the 80+ area now. That’s ballpark stuff but it made the source of the message weird.
@AaronK___ @ARmastrangelo I’m a democrat Aaron and if you ever needed my help I wouldn’t be saying “me” I’d be asking how I could help you. You would treat me the same.
@RepMarkMeadows I hate the kind of people politics draws. There is a specific self interest that is just bad for the country. I don’t know how to explain it and neither do you Senator
@RepMarkMeadows True we are no longer pretending you have good ideas.
@senatemajldr So one side gets a policy win in exchange for an open government. Yeah this isn’t your fault.
@RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews Do you know what a principle is? It means abiding by a moral even if it hurts you temporarily or materially. Power and control are not principles.
@realDonaldTrump Also Putin ordered you to
@RepMarkMeadows Hey man you’ve lost your moral authority. Have a nice day.
@marcorubio YOU voted for it.
@marcorubio Wut
@KyleKashuv @benshapiro Well we finally have some common ground with the growing police state. Can we build off of that?
@JohnCornyn I find it disturbing that A.) a sitting US Senator would have a horse in this race before it’s over, when the only horse to root for should be transparent justice, and B) that US Senator would tweet journalism from a partisan spokesperson.
@senorrinhatch The Eric Karros of the Senate
@senorrinhatch I don’t know man. You’re the MLB guy who plays for 22 years with a .250 career BA and 100 HR, has a stop with almost every team. Admirable career length but those guys aren’t in the Hall and neither should you be.
@Jim_Jordan 1.) Town halls are for the entire constituency. 2)Carlson at BEST significantly overstated the story. 3.) I still believe HER. 4.) Those were votes being counted. People have spoken.

@Jim_Jordan @nytimes You had all the power in the country and this still came to nothing because that’s what it is. Still blew it. Have fun screaming at the wall for the rest of your tenure.

@Jacqueline_rene @RealJamesWoods @Acosta You are welcome.
@guypbenson @benshapiro It’s totally inexcusable and disgusting. Expect it though when the guy you unapologetically endorse says things like “war like posture” shortly before. Of course you are going to get chest thumping.
@BreitbartNews Really searching for a story huh guys?
@jbstevens8 @RealJamesWoods @Acosta Hot take. So fresh tough guy.
@RealJamesWoods @Acosta And your guy says “war like posture” right before it. Anifa is scum. So is Trump
@RMConservative You guys are pussies
@mitchellvii I don't like the campaign money either, but they also re-engaged a ton of people in the democratic process, came closer to winning in very red areas than anybody has in a long time, and spent most of their time educating rather than slinging BS. Well spent in the long run.
@LindseyGrahamSC Cuz fuck half of America says a United States Senator who gives fiery speeches on civility.
@mtaibbi They are just playing an entirely different ballgame from what people want. Doesn't surprise me anymore when polling on issues shows the opposite of what DC is doing.
@seanhannity Im glad you speak of the media as a separate entity from whatever it is that you are trying to do.
@marcorubio By a narrow margin for traditionally overwhelmingly red seats. Got crushed in the house (investigations are coming fuckface).
@seanhannity You are a joke of a human
@rahmanrahmanee A beautiful reminder of what is so good about people. May peace and free will settle into the hearts of you and your family.
@realDonaldTrump Every reasonable statistic in almost every violent crime category shows a decrease in violent crime since the mid 90s. Pretty unified from independent, government, and activist sources. Don't do this man.
@realDonaldTrump Why the fuck are you the victim in every situation?
@MarcACaputo Did he never get convicted on any of those felonies? That seems like the rap sheet of someone who can't vote.
@bingybingyfoo @AshaRangappa_ Being meticulous is actually a pretty accepted trait of a psychopath.
@AshaRangappa_ Too late. I've read the van is too clean, the decals too organized, because crazy people are never meticulous I guess.
@EdKrassen @Phillies Ha! I loved watching Nails too. What a baller. He has been such a model citizen since his playing days ended that I'm really surprised he would say this.
@SteveScalise Crazy how a dude who experienced what you experienced still cant see how this stuff works both ways. You got shot, be against this stuff across the board.
@senorrinhatch You are all jokes, Rs and Ds and I’m embarrassed that you are real people

@NRATV @DLoesch It’s not a criminal trial assholes, it’s a job interview
@AndyPuzder Its a job interview not a criminal trial. Getting a job is a privilege, not a right. If anybody should have that down pat, its an R.  Ive never gotten "due process" in a job interview, nor have I given any when doing the interviewing. Have you?
@BillOReilly Yeah Bill, it’s called democracy.
@AriFleischer Your is you’re and all that

@benshapiro Hey Ben, is it worse to be a knowing propagandist for Russian interests, or to be a sucker stooge and get unwittingly suckered into it? I’ll listen for your explanation today
@MZHemingway @DonaldJTrumpJr Desperation. The end is near FINALLY
@realDonaldTrump You probably could have made some effort yourself to keep up with the details over the last year. Its seems like thats what a President would want to do.
@BillOReilly It’s pretty disingenuous to suggest every one of you don’t do that.
@FOX4 Give me a break. That’s like saying there was a beer in his fridge.
@ReturnToGod @Harryslaststand There it is. My brain just finally stopped
@NBCNews Wow. Such a firm, stand up man.
@realDonaldTrump Prove your raised billions for Puerto Rico and how it was distributed. Be specific
@CharlieDaniels @MarkGeistSWP The men who died in Niger were left out to dry on an underfunded mission in an unarmored vehicle . Selective patriots arent patriots. Stones thrown in glass houses and all that.
@annieclark25 @SenatorCollins @washingtonpost Let’s call it a voter lobby and it’s about damn time. Voting citizens doing things like this in aggregate is the only way to compete moving forward. Also how the hell is this bribery?
@EWErickson I’d rather call it a voter lobby and it’s about damn time
@senorrinhatch Sen Hatch, have you ever noticed how often your party has to explain what was said vs what was meant etc?
@JohnCornyn Nothing glosses over real problems or stops progress quite like shouting Nationalism
@JoeNBC @washingtonpost I agree with you Joe. Americans decide our future, good or bad, not anybody from the outside. Crumbling democratic institutions, distrusted elections, campaign finance, career congress, and apathetic executive checks are a greater threat long term, and our founders would agree.
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Since you have no class America would like to honor the FBI official who died on 911, Leonard Hatton, and the FBI who died of illness from 911. Rest easy Carr, Craig, Fournier, Jobe, Roth, Senatore, Stockham, Wilson, and Yoo.
@charliekirk11 Because the Constitution was written in a very different time but our forefathers were brilliant enough to make it a flexible, amendable document as times, civil rights, technology, environment, human rights, economies, and foreign affairs inevitably change. Change is good
@Jim_Jordan I definitely think that. That’s why I am voting for them Gym
@realDonaldTrump Schumer approval poll suddenly up 240%. Thanks for probably accurate info Trump! We were hoping he was doing that

@WhitebreadSaid @TVietor08 “...short, lame, epileptic, senile and completely bald before 35, always on the verge of death but repeatedly baffling Christendom by continuing to live." There is your lack of genetic diversity, and an apt description of a white nationalist

@B52Malmet Isn't there actually something like 1200 people who could claim to be "Senior Administration"? I would hope NYT wouldn't even bother if its human number 1190 in importance, (though unlikely, if true, to be in a position to directly effect the POTUS), but it very well could be.
RT @joshgreenman: Let's start narrowing this down. RT if you didn't write the op-ed.
@lcovert59 Agree. Whoever wrote that is a coward. Anonymous, unelected for sure, and in reality one of almost 1200 people. But he's got this don't sweat it.
@PreetBharara If something like 80% of communication is non verbal he was screaming an obvious answer
@realDonaldTrump Lol you’re such a dickhead. Not exactly a hot take but that’s what I got
@BillOReilly Ok Bill, I’ll take your word, writer of junk history books, opportunist, over that of a 100% respected, proven journalist. You would have to come up a ton, and Woodward down just as much, for me to even consider your opinion over his.
@LindseyGrahamSC What kind of hardball questions will you ask him Senator? What’s your fav color? Are you excited about the return of pumpkin lattes? Will the Lannisters understand the threat north of the wall?
@realDonaldTrump You actually wrote the book on making shit up to divide.
@RepMarkMeadows @tedcruz Because they didn’t have access to facts and the law clearly doesn’t matter to you guys. Only wins. All you people do on both sides is pound tables. I’m embarrassed of our govt. Lost faith and trust.

@CoreyStewartVA @realDonaldTrump Recovering from a GOP caused horrible crisis. Trump did it because to cover for the massive deficit caused by the tax scam. The “smart business man” has dressed shit in gold until it bankrupts in everything he had done. Now America. He is who his history says he is.
@realDonaldTrump The United States of America is far better than you
@313Doll @Jerry59682582 @bumblebben @barstoolsports @HarpersFerryNPS You are right. After viewing your profile you are a staunch Harpers Ferry/Jeff County advocate and I def respect that.

@GOP Alabama to Oklahoma? Lol
@senorrinhatch What, exactly, is the "proper" role of a judge to you? One who is in line with your politics? Your time left 10 years ago. Your mere presence in the Senate due to the length of your career, and others like you on both sides, is the problem. Leave.
@benshapiro In the context of this interview that may be true, in the context of his life in general, and the nativist, nationalist dogma of his type, it is not a stretch at all. Ben, perception is reality anyway. Your content is always 80% independent and 20% irrational shill.

@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Squats improve the core and increase testosterone
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Tom, don’t forget leg day. I know it hurts more, you’ll live.
@JudicialWatch Do legs Tom
@JudicialWatch Don’t skip leg day Tom! You got that top heavy republican frat boy look down.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Al Capone was a criminal therefor Jeffrey Dahomey is not. That’s your logic. Also my daily reminder to lift legs.
@JakeSherman @yashar What a tiny man.
@billscher That is a fantastic way to put it. Thank you
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @RCamposDuffy @realDonaldTrump That’s an artificially inflated economy and you all know it
@GOP No
@SHarvath @AbdulElSayed We don’t live in a meritocracy. I wish we did
@BeBa3254 @Mholly01 @riktamania @AbdulElSayed Gerrymandering, voter suppression, 42 senators represent 12% of the population, primarily a white GOP population, electoral college reduces power of the urban vote.
@LeBonTravel @glennbeck Reality is obviously subjective, the problem is when someone calls their subjective reality objective
@glennbeck Eh, I think “reality” is subjective to the individual in the first place
@CBSNews There is no way whoever wrote this headline even watched the speech. Called Cruz office maybe? Disgusting journalism
@CBSNews Still
@CBSNews You never corrected it and keep posting the original and now it’s too late. Seriously fuck you guys.
@CBSNews Why would you still publish the original as the headline of your correction. Cmon. “Beto says NFL players protesting police brutality and inequality” See?
@CBSNews Really bad job on this CBS. https://t.co/nRIVHqaTEe
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER Die
@joshgreenman What We Do in the Shadows. Hilarious.
@SassyKadiK Agree. Recently I was one the side of wait for the election before laying out everything Mueller has. Now I think time is of the essence before that man does something seriously stupid as a distraction that we may not be able to fix.
@charliekirk11 Taking a break from harassing families dealing with tragedy scumbag?
@Fillinusername Good god almighty
@bubbagump324 @bwazoo_2000 https://t.co/CKMdT2e8VY
@TheCenteredEgg What I don’t agree with is Hillary. Must move forward. That just won’t work. Unfortunately way way way too decisive and we will be right back to the start. For the good of the country need fresh views and candidates.
@TheCenteredEgg Manaforts suggestion and Trumps pick. How could we back a guy picked by current and future felons?
@GOP @KellyannePolls Something else happened over there, therefore nothing to see here. You guys run the whole govt, get after it then. Or have you and don’t have enough to indict and you’re messing with minds? Nice logic.
@RudyGiuliani You guys run everything. Only answer is its been investigated and they have nothing to go on. Sorry Rudy.
@benshapiro You were ridiculously wrong to say such a blanket statement as “If you don’t want corruption vote republicans” Corruption is human and based on power from ANY source. You’re too smart for that.
@senorrinhatch @senjudiciary Garland
@realDonaldTrump 10 rambling tweets in the last 10 hours and not a word about McCain, but Kim gets a shoutout. This guy is classless trash.
@ryanjreilly @JohnJHarwood He didn’t have to pick public life
@redford This guy gets it. Here's my vote https://t.co/1xp5bKkCjj
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS This will end poorly for you
@Freeyourmindkid The ADA loophole is infuriating on 3 fronts. Cleary racist and un-democratic, and the reason he could exploit that is HIS govt buildings couldn't pass ADA, a requirement. One swoop removing black people, poor people, and disabled people from the American process.
@SenateMajLdr @IvankaTrump What kind of American are you? Senate majority leader while POTUS has been named in a federal crime and not one word!? Party of law and order?
@CBSNews What a POS
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain A better man than you in every way imaginable.
@LindseyGrahamSC @ShannonBream You don’t look well Sen Graham. Blink twice if you are in danger.
@LindseyGrahamSC @ShannonBream So your line in the sand with Sessions was his refusal to let the DOJ get truly political at the behest of the President. Do you understand the precedent that would set? What happened Sen Graham?
@tedcruz I’m so sick of this shit. As far as I’m concerned, from the first note to the last you aren’t an employee of anyone. You are an American. What they do is fully appropriate.
@RandPaul I would also get annoyed watching you mow your lawn
@johnpavlovitz @realDonaldTrump I’m really worried about winning in Nov. If it was a true vote no problem. Any state with GOP leadership is going to suppress at levels we have never seen before.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Tibbits family themselves already told you to STFU and not politicize their tragedy. So do that
@stonecold2050 @bwazoo_2000 Didn’t Manafort play a big role in picking this guy?
@Alyssa_Milano @bwazoo_2000 I mean, it makes sense to them. They have to do that to win.
@realDonaldTrump Your FISA abuse, bankruptcies, dossier true, Trump Foundation, Trump Jr Foundation, Russian collusion by Trump, racist gerrymandering, racist voter suppression, lost pop vote by 3 million. You shouldn’t exist. But here we are.
@LindseyGrahamSC Of course you do. You are a huge disappointment. What made you go Trump over country?
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Note: Us non-republicans are generally against murder as well.
@realDonaldTrump The utter lack of sympathy you show for nearly 3/4 of American, and the stooge is the hill you want to fight on? Ok good. Can only get you where you belong sooner.
@NBCNews WTF is brave about either of these men. There has been zero real adversity, or an ounce of self sacrifice in either of these men for anything but themselves.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle You guys might as well just transition to full blown satire
@AsiaArgento You just gave new meaning to #noshamefist. You have no shame. You just blamed a victim then distanced yourself by throwing your deceased boyfriend under the bus, because he cant speak for himself. Shame on you. I really hope you haven't hurt what is still a noble message.
@CarlyFiorina @thehill Idk. What uses unquestionable power more than a church?
@existentialfish Can you imagine if Obama surrounded himself with proven convicts, cheated on his multiple wives multiple times, had declared many bankruptcies, couldn’t handle criticism with class, etc etc etc
@mmfa In all of here couple years of one sided adult hood. She hasn’t really seen much of anything.
@GOP Lol
@realDonaldTrump He was employed by a prominent GOP official.
@realDonaldTrump None of your decisions should be based on whether people are “nice” to you or not.
@Diane_7A @JesseFFerguson Hahaha! Wtf. Well we all have the airing of the grievances part down. Somebody show her that Seinfeld episode
@rolandscahill @seanhannity Really nervous. All that high voiced stuff. Was just listening on the way to lunch.
@PostMalone https://t.co/vTW8rauVLo

@SenateMajLdr You have to go
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You weren’t the first to “Make America Great Again” either there man baby
@stephenfhayes @brithume I know right? Wouldn’t be fucked up if future Supreme Court Justices had partisan histories too?
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch That’s because your chasing your own tail. Don’t forget leg day. Republican never do legs for some reason

@adamkotsko @CobraWolf81 @TheJustin I don’t know. I think there is a backlash against certain humanities that try to override proven, obvious science because that science is inconvenient to income.
@RepMarkMeadows Then release them Meadows. Pics or it didn’t happen
@RepMarkMeadows It’s about credibility Senator. You unquestionably support a con man and coward who has surrounded himself with criminals his entire life, is too weak for criticism, and outright lies daily. Your take means nothing
@RyanLottinger @TheMMChief @BeckerTheWrecka How come all those coal miners couldn’t just find a better job?
@majguynn @GeraldoRivera @RKrsacarey @realDonaldTrump Every war we have ever won, every crisis we have ever avoided, guys like them were consulted, quickly.
@majguynn @GeraldoRivera @RKrsacarey @realDonaldTrump They are often brought in to consult during national emergencies. Its better to have them cleared to “know” than do all that when there’s no time for it. It’s pretty crucial.
@RandPaul This is bullshit
@Redistrict Our government needs serious reform
@Redistrict How do any other problems for anything get fixed without something as simple as representation being accurate first? That’s so frustrating.
@kenvogel That really sucks and I’m sorry you and your family are dealing with that. Civil war threat may be real. Sure Mueller considers timing heavily when/if he has to start indicting any elected politicians. Also making me rethink my own 2nd rights.
@tonyposnanski Yup
@vermontgmg Does Russia benefit from Turkey collapsing?
@SpeakerRyan When I take a shit in the morning I don't spike thefootball and brag about getting things done, though it does take effort. However that does sounds like a fun new routine.
@realDonaldTrump You are the national disgrace
@GOP You guys are in a place of responsibility to inform people truthfully and ethically, and not to spin things in ways that may hurt people, but will get you re-elected. $38 trillion over how long? For what? What would that bring back into the economy? This is so sinister.

@KateEmerson1959 @ronda_rl @RyanAFournier What will your boys testimony end up being, hypocrite? And it will be ok when he does the same right?I got a weird thought: the Trumps and Clinton’s are both trash and one doesn’t justify the other.
@RyanAFournier Maybe true. Nothing to do with Trump. Defend Trumps actions directly based on facts. Sick of phonies like you acting like one wrong justifies another, and preaching selective morality at the same time. Fuck people like you from both sides. You are a problem that needs solved.
@brithume You’ve turned into an asshat Mr Hume

@CLewandowski_ @JohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump Brennan is more American on his worst day than you are on your best
@JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump That is sincerely the stupidest most ironic thing I’ve seen on Twitter, and that’s a high (low?) bar
@JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump That is unreal that you think that. The only people I’ve met that act like him get fired/removed from social circles quickly. Most of us are not pathological liars without the confidence to withstand criticism.
@kurteichenwald Why stop confessing? It works. It’s bullshit
@realDonaldTrump Such a genius at calling other people what HE is, and it works.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump And if campaigning had anything to do with policy then we wouldn’t need to go back to nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table
@GOP @GOPLeader They are private capitalist companies that can do whatever is in their interests. Free market right? Stay out of it if you are who you say you are
@coleyworld https://t.co/kP70eoYfBG

@10SErebs @senorrinhatch I really like that point. Very well said.
@senorrinhatch You guys set a kind a great atmosphere. All of you seem so fun. Both sides.
@realDonaldTrump In normal circumstances I would say that’s a real slippery slope to go down with your record, but I just don’t care anymore
@WalshFreedom @MillenPolitics That’s arguably the most disturbing thing about him
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Your slow roll towards Trumpism is highly disappointing. You choose wrong and your legacy will reflect that
@IndivisibleNet @bwazoo_2000 That was stressful.
@Robfortrump2020 Frat boy Econ. The economy is just hammered drunk right now. Feeling great, confident, life is always like this. If I know one thing the hangover lasts a hell of a lot longer than the party, and it’s coming
@realDonaldTrump What a fucking odd time and place we live in
@RepMarkMeadows Moral of the story: don’t speak against the Republicans and GOP. Their egos can’t handle it and their policies can’t withstand the scrutiny. They’ll mess up your life and spin it from an ethical high ground. Just “protecting the country”.
@glennbeck New rule: you can’t support Donald Trump and virtue signal at the same time. Pick one Glenn.
@Orionzdream @glennbeck Can relate. So sorry. Shouldnt have to raise money for that anyway. Best thoughts to you and your wife.
@glennbeck You make bank by puking up bullshit for ratings. People who actually serve this country don’t. Strzok is a scapegoat. You are a sad conspiracy theorist, completely walled off from perspective and reality.
@realDonaldTrump You are a fucking fraud you circus show piece of dog shit
@JohnBrennan Agree with his policies or not, John McCain is a hero, patriot, and straight up man. The way Trump ignores his very existence yesterday and took credit for that bill himself was despicable on every level
@GOP You have one “result” to speak of from one narrow economic indicator. Unemployment is temporarily low. What you did to do that will cause a ton of long term harm.
@GOP @POTUS Fucking with immediate families of immigrant military vets, or with the vets themselves, angers me at a level that I don’t even understand in myself.
@Jim_Jordan 8 whistleblowers. You’ll see scumbag
@RepMarkMeadows You people preaching morality and ethics is absurd on its face
@CLewandowski_ You fucking cowards hate being criticized. How do I respect that? I don’t hire people that act that way for minimum wage jobs much less leadership.
@RepDeSantis If only elected officials like yourself had that kind of accountability. You are a coward in a party of cowards @RepDeSantis.
@GOP @IvankaTrump Inflation increasing, wages stagnant, less write offs, eliminated or diminished public services, deficit going nuts, housing affordability crisis, ballooning bubbles, increasing economic inequality, many unstable markets, a trade war, and an impeding global currency war.

Maybe she did stuff, so investigate her, and prosecute if enough evidence exist. None of it obsolves Trump.
@charliekirk11 I agree. From someone who normally doesn’t agree with either of you, that was bullshit how you were treated and I’m sorry it happened, for what it’s worth.

@marcorubio Your policies in no way reflect that. So your bullshitting about one or both.
@ThomasSowell That’s dishonest Mr Sowell. Extremism is totalitarian. Left or right.
@realDonaldTrump Thanks Prez! Appreciate the recommendation. I’ll donate to OConnor now
@GOP Thanks for the recommendation guys. Go Danny OConnor!
@RepMarkMeadows But holding back Kavanaughs full record, particularly when he was working for GOP pols, is cool everybody.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump You are all cowards. Every single policy is about undercutting competition, because you can NOT compete on your own merit. Now suckered by assholes who don’t care about you.

@RepMarkMeadows So your solution is to put it in the hands of a select few, get them record profits, get them a tax break on those profits, and then give them the fiduciary responsibility to turn a profit no matter the damage to people, culture, and environment.
@MarkWarner I don’t see how anyone could see it happening any other way. It’s basically their legal responsibility to do that.

@nycsouthpaw @USNavyMomPA Mr Hatch has been a career Senator since 1977. You can’t spend that much time in office without losing touch and playing a power game rather than a people game, either side. Term limits please. Hatch should have been private sector by 87 at the latest.
@ggreenwald @tates5a Because it’s meaningless and ceremonial. Just because you get a certain level of clearance doesn’t mean you have open access to all info at that level. Means if you “have a need to know” at that level it will be given to you.
@DaniyarRay @ShaunKing For sure. With lobbyists et al I believe more important than voting these days is how you spend your money. Research the politics of your bank, where you shop etc. Simple way to vote daily.
@EuclidAcademy @ShaunKing Well in theory I like as many ideas brought to the table as possible, from both sides, to be discussed thoroughly and with civility, and with a mind towards different needs in different parts of the country. But we have what we have.
@DaniyarRay @ShaunKing True @DaniyarRay, there one message was one of confusion though. What do you think should happen?
@Fact They have done studies that show that chemically, a broken heart is no different then serious drug withdrawal.
@ABC Fiduciary responsibilities make immoral decisions. People don’t like to feel immoral so they make that decision moral with “Its not personal, it’s business.” Same problem with truth in politics. Truth is now the what gets you to your goal, not real truth.
@dcpoll My biggest worry. While Trump is saving face and Rs are passing the buck, the biggest thing the Russians learned is how to do it better. News and elections are awful, currency or energy hacking is a new ball game.
@ShaunKing I am totally torn on this. If Dems divide hard ideologically it seems likely more Trump. I feel like a singular message, just a few degrees left, is the best strategy. Tough stuff
@davereaboi Maybe these are bad guys, but it isn’t right how distorted this is.
@jayjones171 @davereaboi @seanmdav “Need to know” is the requirement for specific info given, not a prerequisite for clearance in the first place. When you get cleared for a level of info, it means you can be given that info, it doesn’t mean you just get access to all info at that level
@davereaboi Security clearances don’t work that way. It isn’t a library card. “Need to know” is the most critical part. If Trump doesn’t want him to know something in the past two years, he doesn’t, he just has the clearance to accept info if given.
@senorrinhatch https://t.co/czarQBJHjo  Goid work, but Utah consistently ranks as having high rates of mental illness with low or blocked access to mental health help. Worst in the country for youth mental health help. Senator please help address this issue before it gets to that point.
@senorrinhatch Good. Since it’s no term limit career congressmen from both sides that are driving us to that point, the help is appreciated.
@GovMikeHuckabee @IsraeliPM What would you do if you were a Palestinian?
@mariayealdhall @greta @HuntsmanAbby That is really thick irony. Let’s all be better and realize that not letting somebody talk is not letting somebody talk. Fox is guilty. View os guilty. People need an ear.
@JayBird2712 @marcorubio Lol nice job
@SpeakerRyan There is a small amount of people with huge tax breaks that bring that average up quite a bit. And it doesn't help when the increase in cost of services, health, skyrocketing rent, and a lot less write offs, and stagnant wages. I hope it works. I really do.
@DineshDSouza That is misleading
@BowdryVaughn @lgells14 @levelheadshell @evenkeelkelly @disinfosemioti @RealCandaceO I agree with that Mr Bowdry. Im not an angry guy and this is all making me confront serious anger. The one thing I hate is victimizing myself by being pissed all the time. This hateful division sucks.
@lgells14 @levelheadshell @evenkeelkelly @BowdryVaughn @disinfosemioti @RealCandaceO When people are presented with the alternatives of hating themselves for their failures or hating others for their success, they seldom choose to hate themselves
@lgells14 @levelheadshell @evenkeelkelly @BowdryVaughn @disinfosemioti @RealCandaceO Thus the divide.  This from @lgells14 is straight up whining. Blaming others for your problems. No different from the left. Bitchy sound bites from both sides, crying about what you are against and afraid of what you don't understand. Holed up only with people who agree with you
@WayneDupreeShow I’m just standing with the American people from now on. I don’t care about anybody who feels R or D, Trump or Obama, defines them. American people can’t stay divided. Enough is enough. This hate is all media and politicians. I’m done.
@seanhannity This has gotten totally out of control. You guys need to take a little bit of a step back, slow down and quit going after the Obama administration on every single thing that takes place
@realDonaldTrump I don’t think Abe Lincoln did anything wrong either
@niezawislosc That really bothers me. Bothers me the same from the other side. Careerism is great, but it’s for the private sector. Temporary public servants. The messaging necessary to maintain power has Americans hating Americans in a way they never would without it.
@JayHumphries10 @TheView @JoyVBehar @realleadelaria @JewdyGold @RandyRainbow @ABC Welp. Trumps out.
@JonMelo97 Nailed it. This
@niezawislosc Interesting point. Why do you think fewer conservatives care? I cant tell if its a strategy or just a priorities thing.
@WanemacherAdam @FoxNews @VP Back at ya brother! Appreciate you
@WanemacherAdam @FoxNews @VP Lol. I know. My GF just checked me hard on it. My bad. I love you all.
@niezawislosc The thing I learned from all this that I DO agree with is that far left identity politics is as sinister as far right outright racism. Both fuel that bullshit equally.
@niezawislosc I disagree that conservativism hasn’t changed it’s core values though. All I heard was budget deficit for 40 years, suddenly that doesn’t matter.
@niezawislosc I’m in that boat. I don’t want anything to do with either party. I’d like everyone to go independent but then we will have REALLY bad binary choices.
@ImPoliticalWill Fuck me man. My wife just got on me and said it was word salad, and I’m being a dick this morning. She is the only politician I have to endorse, and she is right. I apologize for being a smug dick today sir.
@DalonGibson @AdamSchiavone Unfortunate how minority a view this is, and I admittedly have to work hard at it, I want to just be angry about it all the time. I suck at being angry though. And the divisiveness is so bad I fear it won’t matter anyway
@RandPaul @TuckerCarlson That’s fine Senator. I agree. Cold War over etc. Still there was a right way and a wrong way to accomplish that. The problem isn’t your policy so much as your methods. End justify the means though huh?
@BillKristol Oh ok! Whew! Glad you cleared that up Trumps party. I guess we can just move on then
@WalshFreedom You got some great takes Mr Walsh, and this is some petty distracting stuff. The against Trump = unhinged is a narrative that no longer sticks though.
@RepSwalwell Please don’t stop kicking down doors until you find real truth, wherever that leads. America needs Senators who hold America’s values higher than career. I really hope those that do are rewarded, but might not be. The risk is worth it
@kimguilfoyle @BreitbartNews You just made the most obvious career advancement. From Fox to far right Super PAC. Come on down Kimberly, you are the swamp!
@seanhannity Now you are a PolitiFact fan? Lol ok man. And Judge Janine is a victim.
@RealCandaceO @TheView @MeghanMcCain @JudgeJeanine Ask her how her father (a real hero) was treated by your hero. Ms McCain will run circles around you
@_GameOnPatriots @JudgeJeanine @TheView Why is intolerance only intolerance when it’s against you? The right is intolerant. So is the left. So here we are. Let’s talk it out. Or if a civil war is inevitable let’s just get going on it. I’m ready
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Finally politically convenient to be a victim. Good for you
@ZephyrTeachout Eliminate the Presidency but not the Executive office. National leadership is just too much for a single human. Literally the entirety of human history is proof.
@AdamSchiavone At the end of the day the world view of the right makes no cognitive sense to me, as mine doesn't to the right. I want to understand it. He is what he is. He isn't a conspiracy theorist or an entirely partisan hack. He improves my intellectual dialogue BECAUSE I don't agree.
@Brantley512 @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump @JohnBrennan Ha! Well done. I knew the second I posted that I had used "morally" in way too general a way. Good point. Thanks for the reply Mr Brantley.
@AdamSchiavone @DonKeehotey @benshapiro @cjane87 @SamHarrisOrg @BretWeinstein I understand where you are coming from Mr Schiavone. I disagree with a quite a bit of his stances. Agree with others. Im not going to haphazardly call people bigots or that word will lose all meaning. He isn't one.  Dialogue has to start somewhere.
@DonKeehotey @benshapiro @cjane87 @SamHarrisOrg @BretWeinstein My thoughts exactly on Mr Shapiro. Smart guy. Don't agree with some of his principles either, but the principles I don't mostly have to do with faith so I respect them. Speaks for himself entirely,has no problem with a conversation with those he doesn't agree with. Refreshing.
@DineshDSouza Putin is so skilled at manipulating weakness, killing strengths. No collusion, conspiracy or complicity. Facts: he fished around, found the weakness in our system (all Rs so far). It worked. He was right about the right. Shameful
@jordanbpeterson @RubinReport @SamHarrisOrg @joerogan @EricRWeinstein @GreggHurwitz @BretWeinstein @benshapiro Agree 100
@SteveScalise @seanhannity Mr Scalise and Mr Hannity: It is obvious that you consider political opposition as America’s greatest security threat, over attacking foreign enemies. History has a few stories about where that leads. Shame on both of you
@MarkZenLotte @AdamBaldwin Conf bias starts with an unproven theory or conspiracy and works known facts to fit that. Trump won. Didn’t say collusion or treason. I said Putin hacked. Choose R pols and lobbyists. It worked. At the least you’re weak.
@Brantley512 @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump @JohnBrennan An American speaking out against the President is more destructive than foreign meddling into our political system by a country that couldn't be more against us morally. I respectfully disagree.
@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Most of us who see reason not to believe in Trump made our own minds up. If you are coming at us like we need some figure head to believe in, or justify us, you are speaking the language of your party, not us.
@AdamBaldwin There probably wasn’t collusion. Makes it worse. At least some power in that. Instead Rs were identified as weak and easily manipulated, and after some digging the easiest route to subvert. It worked so there’s the proof. To me that is far worse.
@thinkprogress Manipulators go after weakness. Putin is garbage but really skilled. Identify the weak. He dipped his toes in one party, then decided for sure which party had weaker people to manipulate. We all know which party that was now. They probably didn’t collude. Makes it worse.
@VP @POTUS False prophet. I believe too Mike. I believe in a special place for people with your kind of sanctimony.
@mmfa Hannity lectures on media integrity. Huckabee on faith. Trump on everything. What the actual fuck.
@marcorubio Hell yeah he always exploits weaknesses. That’s why he picked your party to infiltrate. He found the weakest and knifed right through. Worked huh? I still think you guys should save country instead of face though.
@byelin @_AintHavinIt @Comey @JWGOP If it helps get Trump out I’m on board
@pambesteder @jaketapper And sure no Russian will get indicted. That’s not the purpose of the indictment. It’s to prove what RUSSIANS did. There is no other time in US history we wouldn’t have been tough as nails on this.
@pambesteder @jaketapper That’s all fine. Do that then. Doesn’t mean Russians didn’t attack our systems, were emboldened by a weak president, and set precedence to attack currency, energy, whatever. Next time could do serious damage. Please understand that.
@FoxNews @POTUS @BarackObama Why is that an acceptable defense? Obama is gone, Clinton doesn’t matter.
@LnotH11 @realDonaldTrump This guy. That’s the tough America first right that makes me proud. I feel the same way brother.
@realDonaldTrump 1/3 of the country will buy this in full.
@jaketapper @yashar Ha! It’s the questions fault. Brilliant.
@washingtonpost Thats not very patriotic. WE decide what is an attack and what is meddling. We decided attack. Who decides for you?
@blm_voice Entire statement is just a rallying cry for assholes of all labels to side up &amp; fork up. Extremists principles are just about extremism and thats about it. The rush of it. That attracts a type of PERSON that has never solved shit &amp; won't solve this, just recycle it.
@blm_voice White guy here. That’s awful and I would work a guy I saw doing that. That made me sick to my stomach. That first sentence bothers me to my core though. That is a ridiculous generalization.
@costareports @jbendery @washingtonpost What a strange time. This guy blames every single action on the past, got elected on nostalgia of the past, has “Again” in his slogan, now he is some futurist?
@arch1com @dbongino I agree. Nothing has been linked to Trump yet, if ever. I cant with all honesty say he had anything to do with it, nor can anyone. The media shit show from both sides is awful.
@dbongino Anything beyond your limited opinion is hysteria and insanity. That seems to me to be insecurity. Why? Ill hug ya buddy.
@JohnFeehery @HolmesJosh What did you know about Hastert?
@GOPSenFinance @njh2005 Too late. You are the reason why we need congressional term limits. Please spend your remaining years in the private sector, where you’ve always belonged.
@benyc Cmon man
@Piaggio_g I’m happy I get this after finally binging GOT recently.
@SenateMajLdr @IRSnews Of the many things you may be in the history books for, a champion of free speech, tolerance, and country over party isnt going to make it past the editor.
@arch1com @dbongino That’s fine. If Mueller finds a complicit Dem have at it. Hasn’t yet. I’m against Russia attacking our system and anybody that allowed it to happen. Don’t care what letter you put after your name.
@JerryMoran I hate how careful you are being with calling out Trump. Do it. We have your back. Collusion hasn't been proved, not that. No President has ever shrunk in front of another power. That man just did. He doesn't represent us anymore. In attitude if not policy.
@CoryBooker The rules you guys have to abide by, and concessions that have to be made to even discuss topics like this, are now fully against the will of the American people. Please Mr Booker, find loopholes, force this issue through to transparency. We all deserve that on both sides.
@senorrinhatch Do the right thing
@Janice11nj @Cernovich I know. It’s a subjective word. All the isms are. Same definition also lists synonyms of Nationalism as jingoism, xenophobism, chauvinism. Nationalism as defined in our case is foreign policy. Not agreeing with far right policy is not unpatriotic. You guys claiming so is wrong
@toddzwillich @Bencjacobs @RandPaul @JohnBrennan I could see being his neighbor, dealing with it for a while, then one day losing it at the mere sight of his passion for lawncare.
@SenTomCotton Thank you Senator Cotton, out of curiosity what did you think of Trump performance?
@NBCNews Wow
@dbongino Do it Dan! Say something tough guy about Russia! Flows easy when talking about Americans. So much tough talk until the bear roared. So disappointing. There was a time I actually thought you were real deal tough. I’m a sucker.
@dbongino I’m all for it. Get it all out there both sides and do something about it. If that’s what it takes let’s sacrifice Trump and Clinton so we can all move on from this with full trust that our votes matter.
@Gseitlin @realDonaldTrump This sentence is not false. Yes they liberated 4 major ones. Stalin was also the height of godless communist evil. Collectivization killed more than camps. Is that who you are defending my dear American patriot? Doesn’t match your platform outside of excuses for your guy.
@MartinHeinrich Thank you Mr Heinrich.
@JordanSchachtel @Cernovich Ya know, if Dems get indicted I’m all for it. I fully believe if there is one to indict, Mueller won’t hesitate. Long run I believe in federal law enforcement and intelligence. Not one lefty, progressive, snowflake, dem, yet out of all these charges.
@ChrisLoesch It was never really about the 2nd amendment with you guys. You got punked. Used as a vehicle for a manipulative, though skilled, dictator. ( I mean Putin, I said skilled.)
@murphymike It’s odd that Russia, although nuclear, is around 30th in GDP. Behind Chile. They aren’t truly a rival, why is Trump acting like they are the Roman Empire?
@ChrisLoesch Maria Butina
@Cernovich Please don’t confuse Nationalism, a foreign policy, with Patriotism, a love for your country.
@Cernovich You’re the only informed guy in America Mike! What ever would we do without your brilliance.
@ByronYork @AndrewCMcCarthy Obviously an indictment of foreign nationals are statements or politics, not law enforcement. Incidentally I subscribe to the politics of American democracy.
@markknoller If this slides Putin and Trump are both given the keys to the entire worlds care, with no worry of accountability.
@mkraju That’s a US Senator saying that he also sides with Putin over multiple US intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
@ByronYork @AndrewCMcCarthy A foreign country, one with political and economic morals that couldn’t be more distant from ours, attacked us. That is proven. And you are still attacking other Americans.
@jedshug @joncoopertweets Yep. Testing the waters with division and political systems. It worked. If that man has been given the confidence to cyber attacked currency or energy look out.
@FoxNews I hope you are all feeling that kind of heat.
@alexanderbruz @realDonaldTrump Lol your down to hanging on with your last finger. Keep chugging lil buddy. I admire your effort.
@LindseyGrahamSC Missed opportunity for spineless Senators to not hold the president accountable when he dismisses foreign attacks. America needs the American in you first, and the politician/campaigner last.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It would be different if you believed that or had any actionable history of believing that. That’s not your worldview at all. Since that only applies to this subject forgive my suspicion.
@seanhannity I question the loyalty to anyone who doesn’t consider questioning his loyalty.
@AriFleischer How in the world can you be this late to the show? You believed two con men over every intelligence and law enforcement agency or ours. What did you know Ari? Americans deserve answers from every one of you that choose public life
@JenniferJJacobs Oh my. I keep lowering my bar for what ends America because I really don’t want it. I’ll have to deal with that when it happens and probably lower again.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump You and your guy sold America out
@RepSwalwell Cased the joint. Easier to attack currency next. Wait for it.
@senorrinhatch Too late to reposition sir. Sorry.
@benshapiro Much respect Ben
@Meljohns15 @lyn_pettit @dleos91745 @brithume Something is up. I don’t understand this sudden worldview of globalism and neutrality with the only country that attacked us, but huge hatred for more than half your own country, Canadians, and Europe.
@ABC Unfortunately they should be
@RepSwalwell Got pretty dicey in Oct ‘62 Mr Trump.
@brianklaas That’s really is crazy that he gets to walk out of that room and say whatever he wants.
@business It’s not just the media. Never really was.
@ChrisLoesch @DLoesch @NRA Politics aside, I have a problem with you not being proactively angry at Russia. If there was ever a time for for you all to be tough talking American fabric patriots Id be now. Why?
@PublicProfessor @ChaseMit That was so holistically cynical it was somehow motivating. Thanks!
@Beerme_RFN @mhgivens77 @snapdragon4561 @lauralopez0721 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews And if this does end the way I want it, I also don’t want to be apart of a thousand factions of Dems splintering about who did most. It’s inevitable.
@Beerme_RFN @mhgivens77 @snapdragon4561 @lauralopez0721 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews I’m trying and fail most of the time. I have serious hostility about all of this. I’m just some guy but man I don’t want to keep re-fighting this. When somebody insults me I dig in no matter how full of shit I am. Human bullshit. I don’t want to reinvent the same enemy.
@mhgivens77 @Beerme_RFN @snapdragon4561 @lauralopez0721 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews Politics aside civility is needed. I’d also rather discuss things than invent new enemies for myself but whatever.
@Beerme_RFN @mhgivens77 @snapdragon4561 @lauralopez0721 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews Fun little deal about the amygdala: neuroscientists are starting to study manipulation of the amygdala could “cure” psychopathic criminality, but also could change sexual preference. Moral dilemma debate GO!
@jessica65139794 @lauralopez0721 @mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews What is socialism to you? What is capitalism?
@jessica65139794 @mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews Research party affiliation for the whole team. Start with Mueller. I’ll wait.
@jessica65139794 @lauralopez0721 @mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews So fairness for Russia is important but not for millions of Americans says Trump. No thanks.
@jessica65139794 @mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews I promise you if Mueller needed to indict Dems, leftists, progressives, whatever, he would, and I’d be on board. He hasn’t. Night.
@jessica65139794 @lauralopez0721 @mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews Jessica, with respect, I have to ask you why these questions are more important to you than the proven fact that Putin chumped us. ALL of us.
@jessica65139794 @mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews Maybe I am wrong but I don’t believe that. I’m not the conspiracy guy you’re looking for here.
@anitaburnsalan1 @mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews Of course. That’s not the point of indicting a foreign national. It’s a statement of “we know what happened, and you are responsible”. Glad someone in this admin did it. And yeah, I trust the FBI on this.
@nightmaretm0705 @mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews I agree. The timing and order of his indictments are crucial for many reasons. Thats the real game here. Doing that wrong could do anything from blow the case to start a civil war. I wish that weren't true but it is.
@foxandfriends @KatrinaPierson Its disturbing and dangerous that the Republican party is going along with the rhetoric that Russia cyber attacking the foundation of democracy is no sweat. I suggest "Currency Wars" to see what setting that precedence can lead to, or if you think a cyber attack isn't an attack.
@PressSec Soak it in. The sunset of your administration won’t be so pretty.
@mhgivens77 @lauralopez0721 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews I still love ya @mhgivens77. Its all a journey and difficult to wade through everything. Keep learning brother. I will too.
@PressSec @CNN @POTUS Most of all I look forward to you being on the wrong side what patriotism means.
@RepMarkMeadows Do not obstruct
@mhgivens77 @lauraMcc1422 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews At the end of the day none of us know exactly. Just got to throw a hat in the ring. Im not going with a side that blows off, seeks to diminish, or blames others for interference with the foundation of our political system by a foreign government, Russia no less.
@RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews In any other world the end of your political career. In this one you'll probably be president one day.
@mhgivens77 @bhansen2580 @RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews It takes a considerable amount of proof for a prosecutor to feel an indictment is worth it. Probably more proof in this instance due to the massive political fallout to getting it wrong. Indictments here are as close to proof as you can get without conviction.
@RandPaul @edhenry @FoxNews Kentucky is a state not an oblast. You and McConnell lost sight of that.
@FaceTheNation @CBSNews Everything and everybody that clashes with his ego is a foe. Thats his world view. Thats the man leading this world. He must go.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch I absolutely HAVE to question your patriotism. I’ve tried every other route in my head.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch I get all that but still find it odd that this is your battle and not the fact that Russia attacked us. Your guy would not call Putin an enemy. No prob slamming people in his own country. You guys are all tough talkers. Why none for Russia?
@WalshFreedom Thank you for being an American
@realDonaldTrump @joshshiney So our American president is folding his arms and saying he won’t do anything about an attack on America because he wasn’t President when it was planned?
@kwilli1046 @carrieksada You know who we should blame? Russians
@senorrinhatch “His friends like him”
@TheRealHublife They broke in. Maybe they didn’t take anything yet, maybe nobody left the door open on purpose. But they cases the joint. Russia is our enemy. Why is the Patriot crowd not ready to fight Russia?
@marcorubio So you find solace or terror in that?
@RudyGiuliani @captnavarre Lol
@charliekirk11 We were attacked by a foreign government, Russia no less. Not a word from the “Patriots”. My last belief in you was to defend our country
@SebGorka @JohnBrennan You are a cartoon character. Nothing more.
@timschrammesq @fabnana74 @Liberal_family @roxannelwright @coffeegurl60 @RepDeSantis Actually I owe you an apology @timschrammesq. Seriously. I did get caught up in what Id rather be a solution more than anything. Generalized you, etc, and though I have an opinion on what I think happened, he certainly did not close all loopholes.
@calfanatic @RobAnybody2 @meblinking1 @bobby_krick @CathyJoeGPT @pr0650 @Jim_Jordan Agree. That’s the truth. Whatever Clinton may or may not have done pales in comparison to this. Even if no collusion or conspiracy any member of our govt sweeping this under the rug is complicit. And why sweep it if no collusion or conspiracy?
@SusanSu19073282 @Luckylaurie2 @RepDeSantis When somebody says anything that’s just plain reasonable it’s like seeing a unicorn these days. Thank you.
@Luckylaurie2 @SusanSu19073282 @RepDeSantis There might not have been collusion. But there was serious interference and it worked. If any party, person, or policy is more important to you than that I have a hard time believing in the sincerity of your flag waving.
@QuantumTransfer @cleo_peterson @RepDeSantis Well he definitely interfered. It worked. He used the right to work it. Easier mark. So you got worked. We all get worked sometimes. Cheer up.
@timschrammesq @fabnana74 @LarryHamm10 @Liberal_family @roxannelwright @coffeegurl60 @RepDeSantis He hardly lied. When truth is inconvenient to you that doesn’t make it a lie. Trumps got you bought into that.
@Liberal_family @LarryHamm10 @roxannelwright @coffeegurl60 @RepDeSantis Yes said sir
@VaToPaBarber @roxannelwright @coffeegurl60 @RepDeSantis Why do you unquestionably trust ICE and unquestionably distrust the FBI?
@RepDeSantis Russians interfered in our elections. I didn’t say colluded yet. If you aren’t in DC to take something like that seriously why are you even there? You must understand how poorly history is about to look at you, now your entire career hinges on him instead of the American people.
@BigRMV And because I don’t know everything I’ll always consider new information. So go for it.
@BigRMV I have no problem with Ms Loesch, but to think she has more info than Mueller on this topic is silly unless she was involved. Unlike most I don’t claim to know shit I don’t know.
@BigRMV A problem with Russia interfering with our election, to me, has nothing to do with anything but that. I support the 2nd. I don’t care about partisanship, taxes, who is prez, who isn’t, special interests. None of it. Because none of it matters if subverted from the outside.
@JudicialWatch Everybody is coming for you!!! Ohhhmaaaagard. Arm up! Let con men take over while you cower!
@ChrisLoesch @TPUSA @charliekirk11 @DLoesch It appears as of today Mueller may still have a closer bead on Russian interference than your wife. Weird huh?
@RealJack @captnavarre All Strzok has bias against are assholes.
@RealJamesWoods @captnavarre @RealCandaceO I started out believing in you guys but now you are exactly what I thought you weren’t: whiney crybabies. Every problem in your life is Obama’s or a Dems fault. Never look inward. Never accept fault or criticism. Salty about everything. You guys are all pussies. Show some honor.
@cvpayne What the fuck is honesty and truth anymore anyways. All frustration on both sides is self inflicted ag this point. You are frustrated because you blame everything on the other side and because your generalizations don’t work
@brithume His texts were indicative of bias against assholes. I believe that. I don’t believe it was bias against any party of policy. Trump is an asshole. He may be your asshole but it doesn’t change that fact.
@BillOReilly I enjoy thinking about what is more important in changing minds, the message or the messenger. Thank you Mr O’Reilly. What you say is true despite the messenger.
@IBTimes Confession: Blockbuster, I’m so sorry. I still have one of your VHS copies of “Three Amigos” Seriously. This is my fault. Would it help if I brought it back?
@RepMarkMeadows You know this by being born on a base and immediately ending your service career thereafter.
@RobAnybody2 @meblinking1 @bobby_krick @CathyJoeGPT @pr0650 @Jim_Jordan Why is it never discussed that they are probably both guilty. You do what it takes to obtain/keep power. Human nature.
@lisamurkowski Ms Randall my thoughts are with you, as they are with you you Ms Murkowski, for different reasons. You are in one heck of situation
@burgessev Mr Flake, you are in a unique and vital position to bang the hell out of those drums on the way out. There is no excuse not to. History choose you. Shout from the rooftops.
@AnnaApp91838450 @carrieksada @therealroseanne @thejournalista She says with hate
@briantylercohen @joncoopertweets Hahaha! Was that inner conflict creeping up or just your lunch Mr Kelly?
@DariusJustinAli Bills fan here. Not defending him IF he beat his girl. But these aren't the same issues. Police brutality does exist, like it or not. Here is where it turns into not kneeling is the same as beating your wife and dog. Its fucking stupid sick of this shit.
@CNNSitRoom An insult to the millions of individual, &amp; thousands of National acts of American generosity and charity that are real. Is that his high bar for generosity? He says so. Ive tried for two years and dont understand what, exactly, the swamp is to the right.
@slpng_giants You guys have it right. In a capitalist system everything happens for an economic reason. I want to help.
@IAmPapaJohn Your pizza has always sucked, its just available.
@benshapiro I fill pool with righty tears. I wanted to float. Saltier than the dead sea. Secret: you guys are insufferable whiners too. Becoming our countries culture. Seriously though Ben, podcast is great.. Love it. Convo with Sam Harris was fascinating. Thank you for the civil discourse.
@Jim_Jordan General rule of thumb: if you think the “swamp” is only on one side, you are definitely the swamp.
@RMConservative SCOTUS should Constitution in human form. It’s voice. Objective and only loyal to the constitution. Only way all the debating and arguing in the other branches work. Competition in politics and economics get ugly fast when “winning” has no neutral referee.
@JohnDor02651732 @ThomasSowell I did misinterpret a few things. Thanks guys. Appreciate you all
@ParkerMolloy Economics. With the internet, nobody would directly die, but equal access to information allows better advancement based on merit, the only thing that matters. The rights policies seem to snuff competition rather than rise above. I don’t respect that the Tonya Harding approach.
@charliekirk11 There not much pretend in regards to caring about kids. Promise. It is incredible you talk only of the sanctity of life of the unborn, but once born you don’t want to hear it. You mock children. No whining kids! You can be both pro-birth and pro-life ya know.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump NATO is ours. So is the UN, so is a unified Europe on our terms. We built that after World War II with huge leverage, for the good. Fix it but own it with pride. It’s ours and it worked for a while. Maybe the time is for it to be over, but be proud of it rather than trash it.
@SenateMajLdr This guy....
@xtglamour @GoldenGuido @senorrinhatch SCOTUS is the Constitution in human form. It’s voice. Objective and only loyal to the constitution. Only way all the debating and arguing in the other branches work. That falls apart it’s not one group, we are ALL screwed more than we know.
@GoldenGuido @senorrinhatch Ha! I forgot there is a sarcasm font, if I said it you’d have known brother.
@GoldenGuido @senorrinhatch I wrote that poorly. I fully agree with you. My intention was to ask why that isn’t the case, and why they picked an ideologue.
@senorrinhatch At this point in history, as an American leader, it just made sense to pick a centrist, objective judge.
@GovMikeHuckabee The worst of party over country. The worst of officials with narrow local world views who cannot see beyond their own experiences, but believe with arrogance that they have the right life for 300m diverse people
@Peace4all17 @TributeProjects @HMAesq I agree. That’s why I’m always asking for resources and find those people who silently do great selfless work on all issues. The people that aren’t on the first few google pages. Keep up the good work ma’am. This country needs heart.
@Peace4all17 @TributeProjects @HMAesq No I am not. But I work with and know plenty, and if I can point them in a direction when worried I will, cuz I don’t understand that fear, through no effort of my own.
@dcexaminer An economic system that punishes the most necessary advancements for mankind’s survival is not economic at all
@TributeProjects @HMAesq What are the best resources for those in this situation to be referred to?
@larrywilbur71 Pro control and pro reform is what I meant.
@larrywilbur71 Yeah I know. I agree with you. I didn’t say illegal. Law is the law. Legal immigration helps the economy. I am pro reform.
@larrywilbur71 No we certainly cant. Not even a little. Our public institutions cant handle it. They are wildly inefficient, politicized, and underfunded. Private institutions cant either. No clear profit motive in it yet. I dont know the answer. Im also not a Democrat.
@larrywilbur71 Its my opinion that nationalism is just a foreign policy, and has nothing to do with patriotism or love for your country.
@larrywilbur71 Its tough. A leader should look out for their nation first, but diversity &amp; immigration improves economies. Nationalism has led to internal purges and civil war, then external war, every time. I wish the USA to be different but nothing in public discourse lately says it will.
@don_peck @KatrinaPierson @POTUS Educate me sir
@foxandfriends Letting a national leader tell you that law enforcement is beyond questioning or accountability is the least American thing I can think of. No American, from either side, should be cool with that.
@don_peck @KatrinaPierson @POTUS Republican aren’t America, neither are Dems. America is America.
@KatrinaPierson SCOTUS politics shouldn’t even matter. Only reason it does is to fill in for the enormous failure in both policy and discourse in all other branches, from BOTH sides.
@stephenfry @OED STULTIFICATION. -state of being, action, or situation that causes one to become stupid, foolish, or unsound
@realDonaldTrump The subtle honor of handshake agreements have always been the Kims thing it seems. You are brilliant for catching that. Glad we have you.
@JohnDor02651732 @ThomasSowell I agree completely. Effort and natural intellectual and physical capacities separate. Same within any culture, religion or race, which is exactly why none of that matters until we are told it should.
@UqailiShafique @cnni He does not. And for generations a material wall will be the focal point of foreign relations, rather than evolving human need. As it is with walls, quite frankly it will turn into needing a return out of the investment of its construction. I applaud Ethiopia and Eritrea
@UqailiShafique @cnni Yessir. Walls are both functionally and symbolically awful. If you could tell our guy that it would be wonderful
@cnni As a huge distance running fan, I think of these two great champions, friends, and ambassadors of peace. Bekele and Tadese. They are rockstars in their countries, and whether their influence was large or small thank you for showing a way. https://t.co/GTQfTMKn5G
@newtgingrich @CallyGingrich I always liked and respected you. Not agreed but respect. I don’t know what some of you guys were offered to be such one sided apologists but I really hope it’s good, and that you use it for good when the smoke clears. It’s disappointing.
@JohnDor02651732 @ThomasSowell Nah, governments label and divide. Reinforce all of it. Maybe a tiny bit is natural order, majority is man made. If I want power I’m going to keep people dumb and suspicious of each other.
@ThomasSowell Not with that attitude! Serious though, this reads to me: (Merit and effort naturally separate, and that’s good, therefor all separation is good.) That’s a debate flaw that has a name I can’t remember.
@joyeta_e @funder I am no Trump fan, but he will be gone some day, while our mental health crisis and stigmatization won’t. Diagnosing from afar, for political reasons, is unethical, unfair, and will make it that much harder for men in particular to be ok with getting help.
@uncleoce @AAMcLane @evil_scott @terrycrews SAT scores are as much an indicator of your opportunities, or lack thereof, up to 18 years old as it is an in evaluator of intelligence and academic success after
@IngrahamAngle Be American first. I agree with half of what I think you’re saying. If you add “from either side” at the end of your post you have me.
@MattxRed Thank you to all involved with this from all sides and opinions. It shows again that the things that divide us right now are imposed on us, and not grounded in reality
@dbongino Be a solution.
@JuliaSm45799532 @guyvermgf @Kasparov63 @Catlady628 100%. I believe in the process of the law, universal human rights (he is a human) and no mob justice or extrajudicial punishment. Do it right or it isn’t worth it. Extrajudicial punishers are eventually extrajudicially punished. Don’t want that cycle
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump That’s just not true
@JennaBushHager What a beautiful thing. That should be renewed and celebrated with ACTION as a perfect response, forget the now assumed and always verified cruelty. Serve somebody or something with no immediate benefit to yourself, your life WILL improve.
@chasaway @Dave_Attewell @ByronYork How can you believe in both our prisons and due process at the same time? I agree with one of em
@chasaway @Dave_Attewell @ByronYork Dude that’s ALWAYS been the system, for people who do far less serious crimes and aren’t given near as many chances to stay out of this spot. He blew his bond agreement. Most just can’t afford bond in the first place.
@ByronYork Maybe he can ask for advice from the 1000s and 1000s of Americans that have spent plenty of time in solitary, for nonviolent crimes, before trial alone. Was given more chances than most get for more serious crimes to stay out of this spot. Zero pity. He is the worst of America
@AriFleischer Thank you Mr Fleischer. I don’t mind Trump supporters, it’s the unquestioning ones that scare me. Thanks for going country over party here.
@SenGillibrand We get that part already. Trump is dangerous. Please, positive strategies and concrete solutions.
@Molly3186 @factordex Only way they could have pulled this off is full use of govt and swamp. Who else benefits from turning the clocks back 40 years economically, in energy, racially.
@Molly3186 @factordex Anti govt, pro market, but need the govt to artificially change the market to keep up. Pro individual responsibility but showed none to need that in the first place. Worship the head of that govt. I don’t understand them
@JudicialWatch Please be fair and have pride in your journalism by making sure every reader knows that violence and general assholery is human, and not party affiliated. Party over country people from both sides will have their reckoning. Thanks fellas!
@thedailybeast @mattklewis “....things are more complicated than the typical left-versus-right paradigm we are force-fed.” That should lead off every political article.
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO Sup, you got me to think with new angles, grew. And my favorite was your response to saying "grow", with a "grow" response. It was a touch arrogant on my part for sure. Perfect dose. Woulda gone to shit with an insult. Thanks for the check. Hope you had a great 4th.
@FoxNews @VP Yeah we get it. Police states are convenient when your national politics don’t go beyond personal experience.
@BerlinAirlift_ @CynthiaConciatu @BradFinken1 @mikebank_ How can your parties platform be so anti government when you take your morals from them wholesale, and further except the largest bailout in government history?
@mitchmp @ctophertaylor @bansisharma @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump It’s ok for simple human compassion to Trump law, actually it’s necessary often times in a democratic republic. Our county isn’t made by turning its people into thoughtless drones. What would you do if you and your child were in serious danger? Whatever you have to do.
@guyvermgf @Kasparov63 @Catlady628 Me neither sir. I am a peaceful man and vengeance rots me. However, I want him to be held seriously accountable for his words and actions for the first time in his life. And I often want him to suffer. Truly suffer, and that isn’t me.
@Kasparov63 @AshaRangappa_ Not one ounce of accountability in his life, not even as president. Why Trump gets a special free pass on common human decency I don’t understand.
@Progressive_PDX @theblaze Yeah. The two word, "public" and "servant" when put together carry a high ideal to me. Among other things, no term limits renders those words meaningless, and ignores some fundamental truths about human nature.
@Progressive_PDX @theblaze True. And both sides are far too sensitive, which is to be expected when both sides have a clear definition of what they are "against" but no coherent, clearly communicated strategy of what they are "for", and a solution to get there.
@theblaze Agree. Both infringe, for different reasons, in different ways, equall fault. My concern isn't that direct however. Its the style of narrative they set. Unfortunately how they talk to each other, WE talk to each other, and the unreasonableness of their discourse we all follow.
@SenatorBurr I hope this isn't a short term drug, rooting for that. Hangovers and detoxing is tough. If this trade war you guys started doesn't work out you better have a great explanation to the American people. All of us.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Why is it so black and white to you? One is a criminal therefor the other cannot be. What if they both are? Do you really think just one party is corrupt?
@DeplorableDrew @axios Agree. SCOTUS should uphold the law. Period. Not make them, change them, or put personal angles on them. Want a law changed that’s for a different branch.
@DeplorableDrew @axios Respect you sir. I fully understand he was speaking in humor, as was I. I’m not against you one bit, not am I dumb. See the problem though? Always turns into debating the debate rather than the issue. Let’s rise up or we will all be screwed by someone. Cheers
@carrieksada @DineshDSouza @Stonewall_77 @ArizonaKayte @ChristieC733 @CaliConsrvative @RealMAGASteve @LeahR77 @KamVTV @steph93065 @1Romans58 @DanCovfefe1 Agree but don’t take a red pill take your own pill. Switching parties just strengthens the problem.
@DrPhilKn0ws @Salon I agree with that somewhat my problem is the environment doesn’t care about policy boundaries, national or international, which is why I don’t think God does either.
@DeplorableDrew @axios I don’t think it will happen simply because he is a man of his word, and a good deal of his power rests on his SCOTUS promises. But it would be a huge show of people over politics and hopefully stop every pick being political hell pit from now on.
@charliekirk11 Brother, be whoever you want to be. Why let people you don’t know define you?
@MichaelDgrigg @SarahPalinUSA Lol. Well written. As a fellow fan of words, nice job.
@DeplorableDrew @axios But he said he could execute someone on 5th Ave and his supporters would be there. Garland is hardly that serious. I’m no liberal but I still take murder more seriously
@SarahPalinUSA I wish leaders like you with platforms like yours, form both sides, would find it within you to do everything you can to unify rather than divide. Wouldn't even have to change your opinion, just your delivery. Take responsibility for the style of discourse in this country.
@axios Mr Trump, PLEASE do this, send a truly unifying message to our great country. Show you are president to EVERY citizen. It is unfortunate how impossible this sounds, but if starts are your thing its a sure way to get over 50% approval.
@marcorubio @POTUS However it is unfortunate, and deeply disappointing, that any suggestions of compromise, conciliation, or understanding that we are all in this is about as likely Kim happily disarming for the good of mankind.
@JasonBik @benshapiro @captnavarre Good point. Diminished leadership from congress leaves all kinds of windows open for opportunists from both sides. Well said.
@marcorubio @POTUS Mr Rubio, first thank you, that was informative.Our wonderful country is getting so hateful and divided. The president represents us all, whether we voted for him or not. I have a fringe belief that Trump nominating Garland would help unify a great deal. This division cant last.
@FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Church and state is so tough. I need help: If you are SCOTUS and faced with a decision where the Bible and Constitution clash, how would you choose? That would be very tough for me. Secular govt is the only way to religious freedom. Would love respectful input:
@njh2005 @RyanTAnd Hope you had a great 4th sir. As a fellow American I am prone to reaction without information. Did plenty of reading on Ms Barrett. I think she is a very good woman and nothing close to a bigot. I personally would still choose another, but she would be a fair and honest choice.
@politico Pelosi and Schumer etc did some good work. I believe if they love this country they should step aside, allow fresh ideas, and work for their principles privately
@benshapiro @captnavarre Only the office matters, and if that trend continues I don’t care what their name is, or their party, the edges of those checks will eventually erode enough that it will be over. Fuck that.
@benshapiro @captnavarre People don’t give back given power. I don’t think Trump is a fascist or Nazi either. But the man doesn’t, and shouldn’t matter. There had been a BI-partisan erosion of executive checks for a long time. Different ways and reasons, will never be given away
@benshapiro @captnavarre GW walked away from ultimate power with an entire military at his back. An anomaly of human nature. The most important single act by a single person in US history. In a world that only knew kings, czars, and emperors.
@50th_President @TuckerCarlson @AreuCathy Bills fan here. Im not sure of the definition of winning, but I know losing. One time, old friend Sammy Watkins celebrated a touchdown at the 1. Didn't feel like he needed the football to be a part of that. Said he won. Didn't win. Was embarrassing. Thats all.
@King_Hucklebuck Human nature changes all the time. Would change faster and for the better if every twenty years those that couldn’t keep up (you) had to drag the rest backwards (us)
@Jacquel53991286 @DineshDSouza Man, we are all screwed there
@captnavarre @DineshDSouza Well said sir. The principle is extremism itself, whatever other policy is just a vehicle. Agree.
@DineshDSouza It’s a lot harder and more rewarding to understand what you don’t understand than it is to hammer something you don’t understand into something you already can understand. Understand?
@DineshDSouza I don’t trust the intentions, from either side, that feel like hating something or somebody is a prerequisite for loving something or somebody
@matthewjdowd @realBobW Thank you for that. So well said.
RT @HoffmanHopes: @SebGorka @Frank_L_Craig @RudyTakala @thehill Alexander Hamilton, speaking through the ages, has a warning for America to…
@SebGorka @Frank_L_Craig @RudyTakala @thehill You’re not American, (I know, I know, but your white) bring your ethnic nationalism back to Hungary, where that has historically worked wonderfully.
@TopRopeTravis Well said.
@SenRonJohnson Now we have junior congressman who hold onto power like Napoleon. Not the intention of our system
@SenRonJohnson GW had the leverage to be a king with an army in a new country. And walked away for the people. Hadn’t been done before or since. What would you do?
@SenRonJohnson Freedom to use our governments political system of elected public servants, employees of the American people, for primarily personal gain.
You know what I love more than the American government or flag? The American people. Every one of you. I love you crazy bastards from right to left, black to white, atheist to devout, and Im lucky to be among you. Happy 4th EVERYBODY.
@DineshDSouza Half the country liked him. Are you party first? Yup. Career first? Sure. Ideology first? Yessir. America first? Not by any real definition. (Before anyone starts there are turds like this guy on both sides)
@OliverMcGee Vastly different parties then. You know that. Back to the present, both parties have plenty of bullshit you can talk accurately and currently about.
@marinamaral2 The Lewis Powell pic has always been so striking to me. I have had it hung up for years. You guys do amazing work. Glad I subscribed.
@Jim_the_Elder @RyanTAnd @TomFitton In summary, and thank you for the question, went overboard, I actually love all the debate and differences going on right now, but SCOTUS should be a bunch of down the middle robots. Americans are smoking each other. Needs a true neutral referee.
@Jim_the_Elder @RyanTAnd @TomFitton I do believe in minimalist government staying out of my life. Government entering my faith mind is far more invasive to me than them entering my pocket. Government should only set the table for us to make our own decisions and suffer or own consequences.
@Jim_the_Elder @RyanTAnd @TomFitton So that is my worry, not deflecting your question but the truthful answer is my worries aren't specific, they are in general principle of the role I believe the SCOTUS should play.
@Jim_the_Elder @RyanTAnd @TomFitton I respect you and your opinion Mr Harrison. Any glancing notion of a theocracy is inherently a bad thing. I also have a hard time trusting the man who picked the arch conservative group to pick the candidates for a branch or our government that MUST remain neutral.
@Jim_the_Elder @RyanTAnd @TomFitton I believe in God. I also don't believe in another human dictating what I should do or how that belief should look. Love this country for that. Secular country. Secular constitution. Religion from the bench is the worst of agenda driven activism. Who among us speaks for God?
@ThomasWictor @AdamBaldwin That made sense then didn’t then did again then went really conspiratorial then made sense again then didn’t.
@RGooodale @CatheeMcKennnna So people don't like that truth and go with junk science that refutes it a best, or idiologically and spiritually deny it at worst. Nature is nature. Economies are man made. Lets question the economic systems that punish life saving natural adjustments.
@RGooodale @CatheeMcKennnna We have to go after this economically as humans. It has to be ok that fossil fuels have dominated all economies since industry, and a lot of people have money wrapped up in it. Even the most liberal and environmental of us make and spend money on plenty of fuel.
@ICanPlainlySee @DLoesch You people that voted in Trump let down our country long before he showed up. He was just smart enough to hijack that. Fuck you guys for not finding alternate industries. Welfare chumps. Now we have to wait for you stragglers.
@ICanPlainlySee @DLoesch I don’t know you but I think you are fragile. America is about open completion. Common theme of extreme left and right is you can’t compete without govt. Whether it’s social programs or rolling back time to bring back dead industry for people that were unwilling to adapt.
@hydehunter2017 @DLoesch That is dumb on its face. Being an asshole, or criminal, or psychopath is human not party affiliated. That shit is why both sides keep electing ass hats.
@eagleraydiver @DLoesch What I’m saying is your only principle is guns. There is no other thing you do that doesn’t get back to that. I am a second amendment believer, you don’t represent me or that amendment though.
@eagleraydiver @DLoesch Gotta agree there Dana. Your principles, your JOB, is to spin any narrative to equal guns as the solution. There is a ton of both cowardice and lack of principles there. I see you though. You have a conflict. It shows on your interviews.
@DLoesch Look, if your toughness and principles need a weapon I’m not sure you’re tough or principled. Afraid maybe, but not those other things.
@DLoesch Protest too much and all that stuff you know the saying
@FoxNews Choose short term economic gain over long term human rights, even genocide, every single time. Still baffled why a generation of the Middle East hates us, or why human rights ARE in the economic good?
@FoxNews Single most important right we have is the ability to criticize our leaders. Instead we criticize each other and let this dude slide with moral gymnastics on everything to let him slide. Worst thing ever for a dude that’s never had consequences.
@FoxNews Nobody is perfect though! Policy over person. Americans don’t worship kings. He also ignored at worst and simplified at best the Middle East in favor of Central America, destabilizing both.
You are a thoughtful man, and a self educated man through your own passion and curiosity. You have a personality, however, that turns people away before the message. As do I. Simply, when is the message more important than messenger?
@TedNugent Hi Ted. Stranglehold is, and will always be, the greatest rock song ever. On one hand I treasure humility with great accomplishments, and don’t trust the self aggrandizing, but I seriously enjoyed Rogan. Serious question, and I am NOT trolling, being honest:
@njh2005 @RyanTAnd I understand following God first. But policy that favors a particular religious school of thought is by nature bigoted against the rest.
@pipinDFW @Gzonnini If you, family members, or friends put food in your belly due to fossil fuel industry that’s fine. I get it and it’s a tough one. But just say that. Solutions come from truth.
@pipinDFW I got a secret for you, but promise not to tell k? You both suck and are from the same cloth.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @pipinDFW You are funny as hell and I’m glad you found your way to public life, though due to no merit or effort of your own. Bad guy in every 80s/90s college comedy. Love it. Thanks brother
@mikefarb1 That isn’t the moral code or culture of the America I love and will always believe in
@JohnJHarwood Lol awww
@njh2005 @RyanTAnd How is it religious bigotry to be against someone who is for religious bigotry? Would you like the definition of bigotry?
@RyanTAnd @TomFitton She is being judged because she is clearly an activist judge which is bad REGARDLESS of the activism, or which side it comes from. Give me a break.
@SheriffClarke @andersonDrLJA What’s the difference between Trump and her? Color and party. That’s it. Same attitude different modes. If it’s not ok for one side then not for the other either. Lunacy is not a partisan political thing. Disappointed either one has power.
@senorrinhatch I want a politician to come out and say that criminality, insanity, lying, agenda setting, and personal interest stockpiling are human and non partisan. Stop distracting from your bullshit by whining about the other sides
@senorrinhatch How is overturning Roe Wade not an activist agenda from the bench. I don’t agree with abortion but walk like duck, quacks like duck, then it’s a duck probably
@senorrinhatch With all due respect sir, politicians have to stop preaching moral high ground. The moral culture of politics would last in no other industry
@senorrinhatch Because people change their minds and policies on both sides, and some of us still go by our principles rather than a party or person
@Thad8920 Also relax. I’m just playing. I wish you the best. Go get yours. Appreciate the banter. Cheers brother
@Thad8920 But since you offered carhenge in Nebraska would make a tight action scene. 8am tomorrow. I might be late
@Thad8920 I’m the guy on the left btw. It’s right there. Since the most impressive accomplishment apparently is your size, I’m 5’7” 150. I like a good book and long walks. Interested?
@Thad8920 Lol that was predictable. Your temperament is not worthy of a political opinion. Racist coward. Can’t compete, so eliminate the competition. Snow. Flake.
@GeekygalAmber @MarkACollett Thank you so much for this. Well said
@MarkACollett lol yeah. I fucking hate families. Fuck them. What an insanely stupid generalized statement. You are the problem
@Thad8920 You have the most punchable face and quote Ive ever seen. In the words of your guy, "In my time you'd be taken out on a stretcher"
@carrieksada Seriously though, not trolling, don't want to change you, respect you, am just interested in clarity on that viewpoint.
@carrieksada The use of that quote in particular, or any Thomas Jefferson quote in general, to support Trump is odd to me.  It seems they practice the tactic of fear of personal safety to distract from eroding freedom. Im not trolling, I want to understand your viewpoint better.
@foxandfriends @GOP @KellyannePolls Oh ok! Thanks for clearing that up. Was worried
@DennisDMZ I’m skeptical that you got every angle. No offense
@SebGorka @EmeraldRobinson Thats NOT the individual responsibility you claim to have cornered. Or tough American resolution. Only reason you guys do so much claiming of patriotism is out of straight guilt.
@SebGorka @EmeraldRobinson Im so sick of you pathetic, stupid losers. Whiners and complainers, hypocrits. YOU EACH individually let our country down by doing nothing but saying "Im a coal miner" and crossing your fucking arms.
@SebGorka @EmeraldRobinson Im sorry, but you guys are the lazy, the dependent, the low energy and testosterone. Had almost 30 years to rise up. Did NOTHING, now the government has to bail you out by bringing back dead industry so you lazy motherfuckers can catch up.
@SebGorka @EmeraldRobinson Reading what you could have already written, about perspectives you already know, is literally the opposite reason to read something, especially in politics, and says all thats needed about you.
@ScreamngEagle @johncardillo @RepMaxineWaters @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader Lol Everything you people don’t agree with is a federal offense
@johncardillo @RepMaxineWaters @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader And your dear leader needs to stop too. Hang your hat on a principle rather than a person or party, or your just not principled.
@dbongino And people in cities will never vote for all the fear shit. Exposure to people does that. And on and on we go. I liked you a lot when you got after both sides. You changed. Was it advertising? Sponsorship? What?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Prevailing theme on both: shoot from a distance. Read that as you wish
@RWPUSA I don't understand how the religious liberties of Christians were under attack, or how decreasing other peoples liberties will help that, or the surprise when laws of exclusion are then used against the original excluder. Somebody explain!
@JohnCornyn Why is the optics of the headline more important to you than the substance of the story? If optics are so important, then also explain why you think this story needed to be written, and if that goes against, or for, what you're are going for, optically. Thanks. Optics.
@SarahPalinUSA Only from a conservative mind would you assume that one journalist has that much pull. We aren't as prone to the dogma of single journalist as you are with your heroes, (Limb, Hann, Jones, whatever) and are more likely to read multiple sources of info.
@SarahPalinUSA Suppressing any measure of free press, even in the theatre of rhetoric, has historically been done by the insecure and power hungry. Explain how you are A. different and B. cannot find it to be less sensitive. YOU choose public life.
@_SJPeace_ @joanwalsh It is so tough for a good person in a situation like that to speak up and out, whether its a religion, political group, whatever. So important. Im not saying that cop is a good man. Don't know. Might be an asshole. Im just interested in that general debate right now.
@_SJPeace_ @joanwalsh I am running out of empathy for "good people" employees of ICE, PDs, and other LE agencies who are "just doing my job". I get it. They have families to take care of, don't write the law. There is a conflict in the body language of the man applying the cuffs.
@JoeTalkShow Yeah thats exactly whats up. So simple. That fear first thing you have going eliminates you from being part of the solution. Have a safe nap. We will wake you up when its over.
@conservmillen I do want open borders. People are people. Im not afraid to compete. Brings everything up. Why cant you compete?
@marcorubio When child murder and detention, poor means criminal, erosion of democratic institutions, and a cult leader type guy became cool we all realized the person bitching about fucks was probably fucking complicit
@GovMikeHuckabee Getting people to buy into you seems to be your only skill, searching my ass off for something tangibly good.
@GovMikeHuckabee Found politics and the Bible early in life have done nothing but run your mouth about both for self interest ever since. Someone got to tell you, of all pols, you have the most uninteresting Wikipedia page by far. So many words so little courage and action
@GovMikeHuckabee You have an amazing blend of traits that sum up to the worst of politicians specifically and people in general.
@DNC You guys better get it together. Seriously. Center a bit for the sake of the present. Get a coherent, concrete, progressive, positive message. Drop the outrage stuff, and don't even try to compete with the game they play. Cant win that, don't want you to.
@1776Stonewall Hate this cult of personality shit. Fucking hate it. You are so bought in that dude gets up and takes a shit you call it winning. Think for yourself. Im no Dem, but get over it.
@Cinrea1962 @CHIZMAGA @TheLastRefuge2 And if you don't agree with that good. Now you know sweeping generalizations suck. The church comment was offensive too. Im a Christian. Now you know that acting like Jesus existed for your political purpose is a touch arrogant.
@Cinrea1962 @CHIZMAGA @TheLastRefuge2 Southern conservatives. Broke, pregnant and diseased by 19. But you go to church. Show me how? https://t.co/Mgfn3QE6iA
@madmamma4 @j_modrell @RealJack @dagogirl3 So is yours. So get over it and compete. Why are you surprised the other team keeps showing up to compete? Raise up then and stop fucking whining about the other teams effort. Fucks sake with you people.
@RealJack Yes. Those are women. Astute.
@SenMikeLee Thank you so much Mike. YOU are what should represent the American people, right or left. Stayed with your principles. Im slightly left and I have so much respect for your values, and your political courage. Thanks again.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump He is making short sighted trade deals that rely on enough immediate stats to keep screwing with his base. I hope Im wring when I say the long term repercussions will suck.
@bolgrean @realDonaldTrump You seem like a decent guy. Nice smile. Be careful brother. I respect your politics and policy, never surrender either to a single human for any reason. Trump is a human I think.
@Cernovich The problem is the rule period. Not side one being more right than the other etc etc. I wish both parties would understand precedence more clearly and stop bitching when rules are turned on them.
@Rstandiego @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr @Rstandiego Well said sir
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr Politicians sent precedence. Block constitutional responsibility to appoint a judge (@SenateMajLdr) and don't be surprised when you get a bullshit fight on this one. I agree its Trumps turn to appoint, but no whining from you guys if it gets messed with please.
@YahN_i @GregNevask Very well said. Thank you.
@GregNevask My hope is an en masse move toward perceived voter neutrality has to change this two party, two countries system.
@GregNevask I agree with what you say about Dems 100%. I disagree that means there is a set opposite path. The world is not binary. Please go Independent! Vote for YOUR issues. Protect what you think. Never let a politician assume your vote. Either side.
@SteveSchmidtSES @NaveedAJamali A neutral, sensible, respectful convo on twitter. A cold drink of water for my Phoenix summer life. Nothing to add, just thank you for this string.
@seanhannity Hey Sean, I wanted you to know I really appreciate your comedy show in the afternoons. How you make fun of right wing extremists by dancing on your head to justify everything is so funny. The country needs more satire. Thank you..wait..what!? Oh shit you are not at all a patriot
I walked away a while too. Not just Dems though. I urge people to walk away to independence rather than the opposite party. Reject pol labels. #WalkAway from all of it! No politician should rely on your support.  Voters going independent en masse would change establishments.
@senrobportman @GOPHELP GOP bad Ed policies are why the entire country has to back up 30 years with industry and energy. YOUR constituents couldn’t retrain, retool, and re-educate.
@SebGorka Ok you can stay, cuz Die Hard, but seriously stay the fuck out of our politics
@SebGorka But Die Hard was awesome.. I’d watch it with you
@SebGorka Get the fuck out of my country and it’s politics
@ChuckGrassley Weak. Very weak. We know why, historically, people in power start screaming “You’re not safe! Only I can help you!” I’ll take the freedom over the safety. I can handle myself. Appreciate it though.
@RuthADouthitt @SethAMandel @jaketapper Godammit that helps nothing. The AMERICAN government fucks up a lot. Period. Cut it out
@CoreyLMJones Also I am currently available Tuesday afternoons and Friday nights to propagate the American species. Don’t worry GOP I’m white!
@CoreyLMJones Well we better get at it then. Our birth rate is dropping, population aging, and most non-partisan economist say not only is immigration a good thing, but a NECESSARY thing right now.
@RepGosar Freedoms cost is some safety and security. I don’t trust you
@RepGosar A lot of snake oil politicians have shouted safety from the roof tops. Explain how you are different. Benny Franklin warned specifically about security at the expense of liberty
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I thought you guys did self determination and free market capitalism. I’m so annoyed it took a government bail out and a 30 rewind on energy. Why didn’t you lazy assholes rise the fuck up!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Snowflakes all y’all. Wait on the government to turn back time 30 years because you didn’t have the motivation to retrain for something else when coal died. Blame it on black people. It’s YOUR fuckin fault
@alexanderbruz @realDonaldTrump Your narrow view of the country won’t exist. The USA will be fine without you. I still believe in American resiliency and Ill fight my fuckin balls off for it. You quitting when the other side of a democracy wins?
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO Man I like you. A rare person who can talk rationally and convincingly with someone you may not see eye to eye with. See this America! We didn't call each other crazy idiots! We aren't!
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO Coulda retrained, picked up a new skill, moved to a better market. Using, say, a robust public community college system does that and is in no way welfare. Still gotta work, stand out, graduate, and find a job. It isn't charity.
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO And when I am feeling cynical, and Im sorry, but what is less reliant on American individualism and free market competition than waiting for twenty years for a government to pull the clocks back so you can catch up?
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO The earth doesn't give a shit about unemployment rate, inflation, the gold standard, immigration, silly bi-partisanship, and the folly of man not being able to get our shit together even if it means our lives.
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO Hope you had a great evening! Out of curiosity where did you come up with 2%? Man, I worry about any economic system that punishes necessary change. Its about precedence. If the system punishes clean energy because of so many people ecomomically reliant on old energy, whats next?
@MastSky Please please please don’t do this. Please think. Advertisers is one thing, this is so much different
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO Environment doesn’t have an economic or political system. Doesn’t care where we are at collectively with philosophy or science. Doesn’t need to abide by supply and demand. We (humans) need to adjust it won’t.
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO The only reason it’s not about that is economy obviously. It will be a rough adjustment. Deadly rough. As will the environment. Any economist from either side knows this. So wtf do we do friend?
@VoiceOfReasonNW @RealCandaceO I don’t disagree at all brother. My stance on climate change is it IS happening. Who cares why? If your house is on fire two things first: get out or put it out. Does it matter right now how it started?
@RealCandaceO Yeah there is voter suppression but that is a bit nuts Candace. Lets make this country better and not just a single viewpoint or party. Liked you on Rogan. Same time having an opinion without information (climate change/Rogan) is a tough one to respect. Grow.
@50th_President Ahh Got it. Appreciate it
@50th_President Yeah urban vs rural is all. A little research on the Crime Prevention Research Center is all I needed to know. Im not anti gun but bad info means bad decisions.
@CraigEBohannon All I’m saying is you hardly have a philosophical mandate, but you have lots of fuckin weapons and the anger so let’s get this over with
@CraigEBohannon 23% of all eligible voters but gonna give those votes to the other team cuz you guys are dicks with the voter suppression. That’s not American bro shame.
@CraigEBohannon But seriously he got about 46% of the vote of the people who were registered and showed up. Not even a majority among the politically motivated
@CraigEBohannon Also where did you get 62%? I looked, about 62% of eligible voters registered. Did you mean that? Nice job though, keep those people away from the polls amirite!?
@CraigEBohannon Damn though, I looked at the picture longer. That is one evil family bent on destruction. Imma go hunker down and stockpile up
@CraigEBohannon Policies of exclusion can’t be specific. If anybody can exclude anybody then everybody can exclude everybody, not just Christians can avoid gay people. I have no problem with that. Fuck it. Let’s hate.
@CraigEBohannon Anti Trump doesn’t have to mean anti conservative, right, or republican. I get that.
@charliekirk11 Sooo Charlie, I’m seriously asking, I struggle with it, how do you love both Jesus and Capitalism and be cool with it? You seem to know. Would be cool if you shared!
@charliekirk11 Enlightenment meaning a school of thought that looked outside the church for morally. Capitalism is an economic philosophy on a human nature without God, Smith never mentions him really
@charliekirk11 Adam Smith and David Hume were both at least atheists at most general deists. Both enlightment, liberal, humanist philophers first.
@EasyMode243 @GovMikeHuckabee Every group has a bad element. If it involves humans it does. The worst violence and genocide always start with a subtle dehumanizing mixed with a narrative where the bad element is the ENTIRE element.
@GovMikeHuckabee "We're a better country than to punish children for what their parents did." Some dick in 2007 (Hint it was you)
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec @POTUS You feel businesses can discriminate. Period.  Policies of exclusion and division in this country have to be general. You WILL be the next one excluded with that shit. Sucks you cant just say gay, or black, or Muslim amirite? Precedence in our law. You lay in that bed you made.
@DevinNunes Btw, I don't even live in Cali, but you are a Trump supporter and cronie, and history will now judge you by his successes and failures, not your own. You made that bed. Hey btw, Im a white straight male, all effort, no help. Does that make you listen? Shouldn't.
@DevinNunes Cant compete, didn't try, now you are afraid that black woman or gay dude or whatever will beat you in a competitive market too?	You guys suck. Thats not American individualism and competitive can-do. So I get it, makes sense to market some corner on Patriotism smoke
@DevinNunes Your people didn't rise up and compete with a changing world. Your racism, etc backs that up. Some of us rise up and go true America, some people got to Tonya Harding that competition to win.
@DevinNunes Cmon, while the rest of us retrained, rose up, changed careers, whatever did your people wait around so old economies can be forced down our throats?	How is that not government intervention?	Free market?	Rise up American capitalism?
@DevinNunes I have a q: If you are a conservative how is backing up 30 years for your constituency to catch up, thereby bailing them out of zero personal responsibility, effort, competition work with your party's platform?
@dbongino To be clear, I like your show and learn a lot from it, however any of us would become fringe politicized eventually in your world. All of us can use some centering up.
@dbongino Insulting far left nut jobs only emboldens far right ones. They are both nuts, a small % of our country and I am sick of both. Be better.
@IngrahamAngle @BarackObama @SpeakerRyan I’d love for one of you extremist clowns from either side to say anything responsible and truthful.
@TuckerCarlson @SebGorka Lol What have you guys been doing?
@PattyOLimerick Agree. Worst crime. "Public" and "Servant". To be able to honestly put those words together is a very high ideal. I can't claim that. Abusing that ideal is offensive.
@FoxNews @POTUS 144 days. Criminality is human, not political. Get these people out of both aisles.
@ShaunKing Hi Shaun, dropping a line to say how much I respect your writing. Keep getting after it.
@cal_aa @washingtonpost Perhaps respect is earned and not simply given. Leaders should have to work harder to earn and re-earn respect. Our executive branch is an office not a person. I respect your views @cal_aa, I urge you to never put them in the hands of a single man.
@cal_aa @washingtonpost Though I’m sure he meant it in the moment too
@cal_aa @washingtonpost Perhaps out of context within the statement, but certainly within context of the man
@kenvogel @NewYorkStateAG Good luck! 1 million seconds is 11 days. 1 billion seconds is 33 years. For a dubiously claimed billionaire thats hardly a charitable fella anyway.
@RealWayneRoot But Id still stick up for you because I repeat, principles of exclusion don't work.
@RealWayneRoot Ever thought of thinking beyond your noses as well? For the time being its still a democracy. Set any principles of exclusion rolling and don't complain for one bit when power changes on you are on the other side.
@RealWayneRoot Some people raise their games, some people go all Tonya Harding before the game starts. You are the latter.
@RealWayneRoot How inconvenient that that black woman, or gay dude, or immigrant might just outwork you at every corner.
@RealWayneRoot Whoa I just figured out racism, homophobia and the like: you cowards promote the benefits of competition in private industry, as do I, but you don't want to actually compete. You just want to say you won. I remember your type from the schoolyard.
@baby_fizzy @holybibletoday Also I’m going to keep loving the world. I’ll be ok thanks. I’m glad God doesn’t the judging and not mortal, flawed fools like you and I.
@holybibletoday Brother, I have no doubt you are a good man, but you got blocked for thinking a relationship with god is one size fits all. Since God represents us all, switch it up. Love only.
@RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Btw, Im a white, straight, male who has never been unemployed or taken a dime of social money. Sufficient enough to have an opinion? America first for sure, party and presidency not even close to what I care about.
@RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump I just can't wrap my head around the fact you believe a President is to only support his voters and not the country. That, my friend, is un-american. You belong somewhere else.
@RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump BTW, there are over 300m Americans. 63 isn't enough. Look out for the precedences you set. I promise I won't call you a traitor when you are on the other side of history.
@RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Such a wimpy statement. Mr. Root, why are you afraid of true competition? Im going to get mine no matter who the competition. Why do you need advantages to win?
@LucySullivan888 Precendence. Careful with that traitor stuff. In a democracy its ok to disagree. If political opposition is traitorous, you may be considered the traitorous one soon.
@SuzanneLTDHJ Precendence. Careful with that traitor stuff. In a democracy its ok to disagree. If political opposition is traitorous, you may be considered the traitorous one soon.
@RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Cults of Personality will destroy us. Be American and love your neighbors. Being Trumpian will be on the wrong side of history
@DesignGreek The world is going global anyway. You can be on a power side of it or ignore that reality and isolate. Isolation and blind nationalism worry destroy us.
@AJENews Trump is a dishonest man. That doesn't make this any less a dishonest picture. Be better.

@SalSports That looks suspiciously Cleveland Brownsish. You're not cheating on us are you?
