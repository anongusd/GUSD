I was thinking;		 If Donald Trump deleted all of his emails, wiped his server with Bleachbit and destroyed all of his phones with a hammer, would the Mainstream Media suddenly lose all interest in the story and declare him innocent.
I was thinking;		If you rob a bank in a Sanctuary City, is it illegal or is it just an Undocumented Withdrawal?		 I was thinking;		 If women do the same job for less money, why do companies hire men to do the same job for more money?
Why do they tell us even though all involved are Muslims, you can be assured, the 'Lone Wolf' attack has nothing at all to do with Islam, just like the other 1,000 plus 'Lone Wolf' attacks by Muslims, are completely unassociated with Islam.
I was thinking;	After the London 'Lone Wolf' terrorist attack government officials arrested at least eight other 'Lone Wolves' who had conspired with the original 'Lone Wolf' in planning the 'Lone Wolf' attack.
I was thinking;	If Muslims want to run away from a Muslim country, does that mean they're Islamophobic?		I was thinking;	Each ISIS attack now is a reaction to Trump policies, but all ISIS attacks during Obama's term were due to Climate Change and a plea for jobs.
I was thinking;		How did the Russians get Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC to steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders?  		How did Russia get Donna Brazile to leak debate questions to Hillary Clinton in advance of the debates?
I was thinking;	If you don't want the FBI involved in elections, don't nominate someone who's being investigated by the FBI.		I was thinking;	Why is it that Democrats think Super delegates are fine,  but they have a problem with the Electoral College?
I was thinking;		 The DNC is mad at Russia because they 'think' they are trying to manipulate our election by exposing that the DNC is manipulating our election.		I was thinking;		 If Hillary's speeches cost $250,000 an hour, how come no one shows up to hear free ones?
I was thinking;		If Democrats don't want foreigners involved in our elections, why do they think it's all right for illegals to vote
