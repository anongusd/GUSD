Trump &amp; GOP seem to have no problem spending their time spreading extremist lies about abortion and reproductive healthcare, but let's not forget in 2017 when they REFUSED to keep Children's Health Insurance Program up and running and allowed it to lapse for 114 days. #HowDareYou

@MSQRD Not just women, people! Including a majority of self-identified Republicans, an overwhelming majority of progressives, and even a plurality those who self-identify as "pro-life." Most people don't want to sit in judgement of others. Trump and the extremists in the GOP do.
@FCaliz @NARAL @PPact You are 100% correct that when we take the time to educate each other, we are stronger so thank you for asking. I have learned much from CCC and I thank you for your work.
@FCaliz @NARAL @PPact The rhetoric is so Trump and extremely dangerous. It's a violent movement with a history of murdering people in clinics and even a doctor in his own church. Using the lies and hate speech as a political tool has consequences just as it does in far too many other communities.
@FCaliz @NARAL @PPact Infantacide is a crime, as it was when a 2002 law affirmed legal rights for every child born. This bill is designed by a movement that wants to end legal abortion to scare people into believing that doctors who provide abortion care are monsters as are Dems who support them.

.@realDonaldTrump believes that YOU will believe that doctors are monsters, women are completely craven, and Democrats have black souls, because that's the only way his attacks make sense. Don't prove him right by buying this BS.
The media is culpable with headlines like this one from the @washingtonpost "Senate blocks bill on medical care for children born alive after attempted abortion" which would require about 20 minutes of googling to understand how misinformed that frame is.
The @BenSasse bill was designed to be a part of Trump's playbook (as an aside: remember when Sasse said he was different from Trump? not so much) to use fake boogeymen (remember the caravan?) to play to people's basest instincts and scare them into hating anyone other than Trump.
If ANYONE is killing infants, they are murderers and they are charged with murder. That is what everyone agrees should happen and that is, in fact, what happens.
This is simply one in a long line of deflection strategies by Trump to draw attention away from his failing presidency by riling up his base--among whom there are some very dangerous people--to perpetuate lies that are based in misogyny.

Today at about 4:30, the Senate will be voting on a bill forced by @BenSasse that is designed solely to stoke anti-choice fervor and vilify doctors working to support their patients who need abortion care. #ProtectProviders

Fact: Anti-choice institutions and leaders know that they are in the minority and that when their true agenda of criminalizing abortion and punishing women and doctors is exposed, they lose. So they shout MURDER and try to silence us. Fact: We are not going anywhere. The end.
Fact: Lack of access to to abortion doesn't make the number of abortions go down. It does make the number of deaths and injuries to women go up. Fact: Every major medical association supports access to abortion.
#PSA Shouting MURDER and posting pictures of pepe does not an intelligent argument (or person) make. Fact: The majority of people seeking abortions are moms already. Fact: Most Americans support access to abortion.

Except, apparently, thousands of men who tell women we have no voice in what happens to our bodies, our families and our lives. Because it's not really about abortion.

The woman who wrote this story was the victim of a brutal rape who gave birth to a daughter who suffered every single day until she died at a year old. That family cared for that little girl every moment of every day. They deserve a voice. You do not.

Let‚Äôs be clear: the majority of Americans are firmly on the side of reproductive freedom. 7 in 10 Americans support abortion access and believe the government shouldn‚Äôt be making the most personal and private decisions for women and their families.
Mostly, we mustn't fall prey to a sinister agenda of the extreme anti-choice movement who capitalizes off of these women's pain to achieve their ideological goals. Listen to VA Delegate Kathy Tran about why she stood up for these women:  https://t.co/ZUTgxHXeCA. #IStandWithWomen
We need to #TrustWomen. We need to leave medicine to the medical professionals - not politicians. And we need to ensure that women are not jailed for making their own healthcare decisions - with their doctors- about their lives, bodies, and futures.
Bans on abortion later in pregnancy disproportionately hurt women who face the most medically complex situations imaginable. These women need medically accurate information, compassion, privacy and support‚Äã. Women like Kate. https://t.co/HxFdx8lKUE
We can never fully know a woman‚Äôs circumstances. Nor can a politician. But their doctors can. Thankfully, brave people are willing to share their personal stories to enlighten this conversation. People like Erika and Garin. https://t.co/Kw3MdzHOtu
To work towards this goal, they must deceive the public and twist the facts, especially when it comes to women who need abortion later in pregnancy. They are fine to jeopardize women's lives and make them relive the worst moments of their lives to do this. Don‚Äôt take the bait.
But the misinformation being spewed by anti-choice politicians, right-wing media, and Trump around VA and NY‚Äôs abortion bills is egregious and we must set the record straight and remember the anti-choice movement has one goal: ban abortion and criminalize women and doctors.
We know is that the anti-choice movement LOVES to talk about later term abortion because they know they lose on more common place abortions that women experience. So, no wonder they are leaning into the policies this week that safeguard this right and undo an historic wrong.
Know the facts. @DrDGrossman is a leading expert in the abortion care field and a @naral board member. https://t.co/zsIBfaQd1n

We've seen a trend of imposing one‚Äôs religious views on all others through law and statute using a perverted definition of "liberty" and that trend has devastating effects on both the principles of democracy and on vulnerable communities.

@CatLady_2020 @MichaelAvenatti Sure, okay, but why blame KG for Franken choosing to resign after a half dozen allegations and no real process to sort them? It's a classic hit piece.
6) With so much damage occurring in our country and children being tear-gassed at the border, Politico spending so much time on tarring one of women's best advocates in the Senate is befuddling at best and at worst, aiding and abetting a dangerous GOP and White House. 6/6
5) Al Franken says in the story that he is listening and learning which is great and what we need from all leaders who are grappling with the sexual assault epidemic in our country. /5
4) What KG is being maligned for is believing women. We have nothing that resembles due process for these claims and we saw with Kavanaugh that survivors coming forward incur serious consequences. KG has always shown that survivors have somewhere to turn. /4
3) this occurred against a backdrop of a special election in Alabama where the leading candidate was accused of sexual harassment and assault. He lost. People cheered. /3
2) the claims of damage done ignore the immense leadership that @TinaSmithMN has shown in her time in the Senate, a job the voters just handily endorsed her to continue doing. Ignoring that is ignoring women's leadership. /2
.@politico story this morning on @SenGillibrand is such a classic move to shoot the messenger. People can disagree with Franken's decision to resign, but several facts remain true: 1) there was no "rush to judgement" -- this situation played out over literally weeks /1

Frustrating bc it's academic. There is no real challenger stepping up and so all this serves to do is distract and divide when we have an opportunity to come together and go on offense. Limited bc it can be YES, AND. Yes she is the best person for the job AND we can have more /2

Y'all it's heartbreaking that Cruz survived. But for Beto to come within 150,000 votes is huge given the incredible voter suppression in the state. Texas deserves better. But if we want that to happen, INVEST in TX. It doesn't happen on it's own.

We are not going anywhere. Today, we bear witness to this vote and tomorrow we organize to elect candidates who believe women and share our vision of a country that is just and compassionate and reflective to the change required for our nation.
Because we ARE powerful. We are the future. And they may win this battle. But the entire world in watching. Messages have flooded my inbox from women around the world who stand with us in this moment, sharing our pain and our strength and our fortitude.
I sometimes think that they chose this path to explicitly try to teach us that organizing won't work. So, better not to try. They are uncomfortable with our voices and the power that we exhibit when we collectively come together to fight for a more just system.
They have clung to this nominee, despite the track record of lying, extreme views, lack of judicial temperament and hostility towards women. They have done so over the pain of millions and at he expense of the legitimacy of the Court and their own honor.
We now see clearly what we are up against, and we also know the power we have. They said this outcome was inevitable. They said he would sail through. We made them fight every single step of the way to accomplish a task so unjust that they have had to unmask themselves to do it.
If you are like me, this morning is hard. To throw yourself so fully into something, you must believe that victory is possible. And with Susan Collins speech on the floor yesterday, we now believe that Kavanaugh will sit on the Supreme Court. And that hurts. But...
They think we will go home. They think they have beaten us. Prove them wrong. Today, we bear witness today to the most consequential vote these Senators will ever take and then tomorrow start to organize to elect candidates who #believewomen. Join us. https://t.co/oPhCKy3EMT

Now, she's defending Trump's mocking of Dr. Ford as just the facts. It would be ridiculous if it wasn't so offensive.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders' presser right now leaves no doubt that they have settled on a narrative that relies on the American people believing that Judge Kavanaugh's lying, extreme views and multiple stories of sexual assault are all a partisan smear campaign.

Trump seems to be suggesting that a subgroup of the 19 women accusing him of sexual harassment and assault were paid off. Aside from the legitimacy of that claim, he seems unfazed by the fact that he can lump his accusers into subgroups.
Trump asked if the women are liars says he will be watching them tomorrow. Only his GOP is only letting one of them testify.
If there's a silver lining to the devastation we have experienced in the last few weeks, it's @Acosta using his time to ask the President to call on one of his women colleagues next. Shouldn't be necessary but fun to see.
Trump is singularly concerned with what happened to Kavanaugh and not at all concerned with what happened to these women. Not shocked. Just reminding people.
The reason Trump had so many judges to pick is because the GOP prevented Obama's judges from moving forward at every step. Not just Merrick Garland. So many district and circuit court judges.

An honorable man who cares about confidence in and credibility of the Supreme Court as one of the most hallowed institutions of our democracy would have already bowed out. He should withdraw, clear up these investigations if he can, and reapply if he wants when another job opens.
He has failed. These serious and credible charges come on top of concerns about perjury and views too extreme for the American people. His approval ratings were terrible BEFORE Dr. Ford took the brave step of coming forward.
Once more for the cheap seats: he‚Äôs applying for a huge job promotion not defending himself in a criminal proceeding. His apologists conflate the two. They couldn‚Äôt be more different.

@seungminkim Sorry @seungminkim. You're correct and I amend my comment to replace press corps with cable news.
I honestly don't care who wrote the OpEd. I didn't think there was much new in it that we didn't know. But I do care that the obsession about it by the DC press corps is so easily distracting them from the Kavanaugh hearings, which will have far greater and longer impact.

GOP has sunk to rushing sham hearings, holding hostage docs that would allow public and Senators an informed position on this nomination, because they know that the good old American way of transparency and participatory democracy would sink Kavanaugh even with $30 mil in ads.
3 out of 51 GOP Senators held any kind of public event over recess, apparently not wanting to face their constituents--aka the people they work for--before the most consequential vote of their lives. Ads can't buy them cover if real life when they have to defend their position.
An exhaustive search of the grassroots activity shows tepid to non-existent pro-Kavanaugh activities in key states, while anti-Kavanugh groups have held over 400 in person events in states around the country since his nomination. Ads don't buy activity. https://t.co/0KhV6lAapl
Senators in purple and blue states are reporting that calls saying to vote no are well ahead of calls to confirm Kavanaugh and those in deep red states say they are running even which is highly unusual since the far right engages at higher numbers. Ads aren't buying calls.
.@CNN polling shows Kavanaugh as the least liked nominee in recent history, with only 37% of Americans wanting him to be on the Supreme Court. Literally only 28% of women back this guy, who will hold our futures in his hands. The ads aren't fooling anyone. https://t.co/Xw8j8UEOzK

As for the rest of us, I do NOT want to wake up three years from now with the Court doing all the things we ALREADY know it will do including letting Trump off the hook for crimes he may have committed and wishing that we could have done more.
They know if these come out, they have no shot, so they are in a race to ram this guy through a vote, and in the meantime, literally prevent our elected representatives from serving us, the people, by knowing who this guy is. The only sane and patriotic thing to do is vote no.
We know what they are hiding in those records. Positions that are so completely out of step with what most Americans envision as progress and justice in this country. Criminalizing women for having abortions. Stripping the right to vote. Undercutting working people.
Meetings and hearings are no substitute for records documenting a lifetime of work. I wouldn't hire a junior employee in my office that way, so why should we be sanguine with the GOP doing this with someone who holds the fates and futures of millions of Americans.
This is the final chess move for McConnell and his ilk to make the Court subservient to Trump's whims and the GOP agenda to concentrate wealth and power by using the Court to strip people of economic and human rights. How can anyone be okay with this?
New poll from a GOP pollster shows Donnelly's significant lead in his Indiana race to keep his Senate seat drops precipitously if he votes for Kavanaugh. Not surprising since this nominee is very unpopular, but weird that an R firm would release? https://t.co/Du4a75sH2Z

#StopKavanaugh is about more than just this one nominee. It's about halting this power grab and undercutting GOP leadership's unfettered ability to use our own justice system as a weapon against us. To date, they think they can get away with anything.
The Right understands that elections are a means to an end, and the end for them is cementing their unassailable control through stripping women, people of color, religious minorities and working people of fundamental freedoms and rights currently protected by the Courts.
McConnell's final chess move: ‚Äú....this is the culmination of a years-long gambit that started with stymieing President Barack Obama‚Äôs judicial nominees, most notably Supreme Court choice Merrick Garland, and creating a backlog of vacancies on the nation‚Äôs highest courts.‚Äù

When the GOP talks about sending Roe back to the states, they leave out the part that only 8 states would have protections for abortion. In many of the others, abortion would be criminalized immediately or quickly and women and doctors would be criminals. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/KolhLgCXnq
A good piece on this in the @washingtonpost by Nancy Northup of @ReproRights https://t.co/5zU3VhFzKn
Women, when we fight for our right to abortion, are fighting for all of our rights to be in control of the most fundamental decisions about our bodies and our lives. That's why so many men fight alongside us. That's why we all need to #SaveRoe and #StopKavanaugh.
Abortion is the tip of the spear of some juris prudence that genuinely does protect us from becoming the Republic of Gilead. There's a reason the Handmaid's Tale is so popular right now; it resonates with people afraid they are looking at our future.
A government that can deny you a right to abortion can deny you IVF, a procedure that has yielded many loved children but would be banned as a result of most "personhood" bills and ballot measures.
A government that can deny you a right to abortion can force you to be sterilized which has certainly happened in the dark history of our country and should never be repeated.
A government that can deny you abortion can also deny you contraception as they did pre Griswold v Connecticut, which granted the right in 1965 to married couple to use contraception. For single women, it came years later.
As #SCOTUS said in another case it's about the ‚Äúpromise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.‚Äù A lawyer said to me, "We need to remind people a government that can deny you an abortion can force you to have an abortion."
As we talk about why we need to #StopKavanaugh, here's a reminder that while #roevswade was brought to the Court bc of a young woman's desire to get an abortion, the rights protected therein go far beyond that.

reject out of hand any nominee from Trump's list given that he promised a list of Justices committed to overturn #Roe. They need to hear from you. GOP Senators need to hear for you too. That they will pay a price for this coup of the Court, people in their states will rise up.
They intend to ram through a nominee that would be the 5th vote against Roe and likely bad on most other human rights before November. We intend to demonstrate that is not possible. Democratic senators must refuse hearings before November and
The funders want corporate capture of our democracy. They have made progress, and this is game time. What we have is more people. People who live in state w/GOP Senators and people who live in states w/Democratic Senators. People who recognize what's at stake.
It is true a perverse coalition of religious extremists and deep pocketed funders have been manuevering for years towards this moment. Most of them want to overturn #RoeVWade and #MarriageEquality. Lots of them are nationalists and xenophobic.

And‚Äîonce again for the cheap seats‚Äîappreciate that the female justices were there, asked the tough questions and ruled from lived experience. This is why diversity is important‚Äînot just a buzzword but a principle way which justice is applied evenly.
In the meantime, they will use any tool possible I clouding lies and deceit to coerce and control women into not making decisions best for us. It‚Äôs not about abortion; it‚Äôs about control.
Make no mistake, they are setting the stage for a direct hit on #RoeVWade and depending on Trump to deliver on his campaign promise to add justices to the bench who will vote to overturn.
They claim it‚Äôs a free speech issue but they have no problem forcing doctors to lie to women seeking abortion with medically inaccurate information that even many doctors oppose. #Hypocrisy
On the second piece that women must be informed of all available services so they can make their own decision, the all-male majority says no; fake clinics can continue to lie to women.
Remember this was two pieces: on the first of centers with no medical staff present, the Court says that they would consider a narrower law to inform women they are not in a medical facility.
BREAKING: #NIFLAvBecerra finds that fake women's health centers can lie to women with no disclosure in a 5-4 decision. Thomas pens the decision. #EndtheLies More to come....

These policies @Walgreens and other drug stores use to allow pharmacists to NOT serve women with MEDICAL prescriptions are just ONE more way that women's needs take a backseat to others. It's humiliating and unsafe and a practice that should end but is getting worse under Trump. https://t.co/zL6VAMplMY

Somehow I doubt when future generations review this period in American history that tears will be shed for a high ranking official of an authoritarian government who was denied a single meal at a farm to table restaurant. https://t.co/VUiI1NJvXO

Amazing story of why this woman is running for Congress. If we had more women and more moms serving, I promise you lots of what we are seeing would not be happening. https://t.co/OEJt1vdnag
Follow existing leadership. Do not reinvent. We don't have time for redundancy or men creating things that women have already been doing. #GrabYourWallet https://t.co/V6F3UpqFza
This is a perfect time to remind people that #GrabYourWallet led by the amazing @shannoncoulter has been underway for almost two years and is displaying amazing leadership in targeting businesses who participate with Trump or Trump policies. Follow her!
@Hermionejh @CrisAlexJimenez @StoshCotler Per article, @AmericanAir held the plane on the ground for over a half hour until they received ‚Äúword‚Äù from the govt that these were ‚Äúnot separated kids.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt until they were in the air that they realized they were lied to.
DJT, his accomplices are flying kids around the country with no tracking system far from their parents, lying to the airlines, and preventing services that they need. Keep organizing üôè @CrisAlexJimenez and @StoshCotler for being there and bearing witness. https://t.co/xNrdXb8BHz

And they have no plans on how to get the kids back to their parents that they have already taken. Which is worse. We can't rest until every child is back with a parent and everyone involved in this atrocity is held accountable.
He signed the executive order. It's evidence of our growing power. It means they will no longer separate families at the border, which is good. They will still jail them. Which is bad. And against the law.
This was a brilliant action. So proud of my friends @American_Bridge. Let them hear the children's cries wherever they go, forever more. https://t.co/7Aqo6BrGxD

@dm1661 exactly
Reports that HHS is drafting an order to end family separation at the border are 1) as of yet unconfirmed 2) a direct result of your pressure, so keep it up and 3) totally insufficient. We will not rest until these children are reunited with their families. #endfamilyseperation
