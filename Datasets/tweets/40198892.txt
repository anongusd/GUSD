War, as the saying goes, is full of false alarms. -Aristotle #Libya #Sirte #BaniWalid
Misrata fighters I've talked to are reluctant but ready to attack Sirte and Bani Walid saying they've shed enough blood. #Libya
@derek_brower agreed but they seem to be united for now. The guys I talk to really like Jalil.
After reading yesterday's events in Cairo, I'm curious who exactly stormed the #IsraeIiEmbassy building and their backgrounds. #Egypt
The boys from Misrata have struck me as the most competent and professional fighting force in #Libya.
The fight for Bani Walid & Sirte may be bogged down but we haven't seen the Misrata boys' full assault yet. #Libya
