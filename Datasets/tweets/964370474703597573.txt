@YShDN_ @PrettyRose563 Shalom
@YShDN_ @PrettyRose563 Lolol I can't with you Christans. Scripture clearly states tmh hated Esau.
@YShDN_ @PrettyRose563 Aha do not abhor a edomite right 😂😂😂 you need to do some more research.
@YShDN_ @PrettyRose563 Tmh said he only made a convenient with Isreal. #facts Jesus said he only came for the lost sheep of the house of Isreal. #fact
@YShDN_ @PrettyRose563 Lol I'm not offend you are. You making claims that aren't back up by the Bible. Everything I say I can pull s scripture to back.
@PrettyRose563 Matt 15:26		But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.		He call her a bitch 😂😂😂
Ain't no breaks or love for a Christian
@PrettyRose563 It don't change the fact that you a Christian that don't follow the way of Jesus. Did you know Jesus call a white woman a dog??? Stop playing with me before you have nightmares about white Jesus
@PrettyRose563 You a Christian that don't read the Bible that's why. Take that white Jesus down and grow some balls.
@PrettyRose563 Truth hurts. You have been exposed to be a Christian. Convo done.
@PrettyRose563 Lol you running from facts. How about you get me in contact with your pastor so he can tell you. Since you think I'm lying
@PrettyRose563 How are you gone find something wrong with God saying he loved you but hate your enemy??? #GETOUT
@PrettyRose563 Pull your grandma bible out and turn to Roman 9:13
@PrettyRose563 It's a biblical fact. Don't tell me hates not in the Bible then I prove it now you ain't religious 😂😂😂#Christans
@PrettyRose563 You hate your own kind for telling you to love your own kind. The Christian is ozzing out of you...
@PrettyRose563 Rom 9:13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.		Stop playing with me. This is why I don't speak to Christans.
@PrettyRose563 Lol your full of love for the European that's nasty
@PrettyRose563 @YShDN_ What you talking about?? Tmh said he only love Isreal and only gave us his word.
@PrettyRose563 @YShDN_ They are and will never be accepted into the nation
@PrettyRose563 @YShDN_ Umm you must be a Christian then lol. Hold on ima state scripture since I know Christans don't read the Bible
@PrettyRose563 @YShDN_ Esau was a very wicked man and his kids are the same. You can forget the European if you want to but a true Isrealite won't.
@PrettyRose563 @YShDN_ If you are from the seed of Esau. Yes I HATE YOU &amp; TMH DOES TOO.
@YShDN_ @PrettyRose563 😂😂😂😂 even tho it describes the devil. All the descriptions point to Esau. As well as TMH said he hates Esau.
