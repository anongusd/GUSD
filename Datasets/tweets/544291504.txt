The GWU study revealed that Puerto Ricans in the poorest towns were 60% more likely to die in the months after Hurricane María. @NBCNews, @NBCLatino had previously reported that 10 poor towns saw more deaths after Hurricane Maria than in 2015 and '16. ⬇️ https://t.co/9iznZ2adoH
And of course, the GWU study that pushed the Puerto Rican government to update its Hurricane María death toll.		Hurricane Maria kills 2,975; Puerto Rico updates official death toll ⬇️ https://t.co/XuOepwBDI8

21% of #PuertoRico’s population has a disability, a rate higher than any of the 50 states. Many get as little as $64/month for living expenses. After Hurricane Maria, that didn’t change... Today, the gov’t updated the official death toll to 2,975 from 64. https://t.co/dbuUNou5EE

For the full story, click here. https://t.co/7zZhNVH1kF
Unlike the U.S., #PuertoRico public schools mainly serve low-income communities, 70-80% of students at any given public school live below the poverty line, according to numbers from @EstadisticasPR . Most middle-income and upper-income families use parochial or private schools. https://t.co/Pihwn49SRl
Officials say changes are needed as @EDUCACIONPR deals w/ shrinking population &amp; budget shortfall. “Transforming the education system [...] is hard to separate from the financial &amp; the administrative piece,"said @SecEducacionPR. "That controls what I’m actually able to deliver."
“We’ve never had this kind of system, but we have it now. You can name me any school and I can tell you who’s there,” @SecEducacionPR told @NBCNews. “That’s normal in most systems.”		Full story here: https://t.co/7zZhNVH1kF https://t.co/vBCIdnZ0Z1
The wave of uncertainty came after new online systems were put in place, during months in which families were grappling with the ripple effects of #HurricaneMaria, to handle these tasks. Other changes took place before school started on Monday. 		Details: https://t.co/7zZhNVH1kF https://t.co/TZyGynVW4I
Much-debated school consolidations led to the closing of 250+ facilities. Consequently, teachers &amp; students were shuffled around schools. Many faced uncertainty after not knowing where they were assigned to.  Some still have teacher vacancies. Details⬇️  https://t.co/7zZhNVH1kF

Two of those Puerto Ricans are Eduardo and Franco, who run a 'smart farm' in the town of Las Piedras.
