@Natasha78d @AmericaHasBalls @NeonNettle All I'm saying is that it's dangerous when Headlines don't match article content.		@NeonNettle is the party at fault IMO &amp; believe if CNN or WAPost wrote article you'd probably agree with me.		Regardless, I apologize that you took my criticism of article as personal attack on you
@Natasha78d @AmericaHasBalls @NeonNettle The thing is that I'm not attacking you, insulting your intelligence, telling you to get a life &amp; to pull yourself together, or suggesting that you're not a patriot. It's unfortunate that you cannot say the same about your responses to me.
@Natasha78d @AmericaHasBalls @NeonNettle Wow! I wasn't attacking you, and am sorry you took it that way! I was attacking the article because I believe journalists need to do better!		Like I said though, we live in emotionally-driven climate - and are clearly losing the ability to have constructive conversations!
@Natasha78d @AmericaHasBalls @NeonNettle In this emotionally-driven political climate we live in, I believe we must be sure there is no room for Left to catch us being careless. When we have strong, legitimate sources we need to share them w/ the world. But articles like these work AGAINST us &amp; impact our credibility
@Natasha78d @AmericaHasBalls @NeonNettle This article was regarding Obama lying about having no knowledge of Hillary's private email server. Not having no knowledge of her child trafficking crimes.
@Natasha78d @AmericaHasBalls @NeonNettle I'm not saying that articles DO NOT EXIST. I'm just saying this headline didn't match the content of this article!  That's all!  I have read hundreds of articles discussing the Clintons ties to child trafficking. I do this for a living. My point was focused on the linked article
@AmericaHasBalls @Natasha78d @NeonNettle While I believe Obama &amp; Clintons are/were involved w/ child trafficking, this article didn't have anything to do with Obama lying to cover Clinton's trafficking crimes! Hate it when headlines don't match story! We're no better than Left &amp; #FakeNews when we share stuff like this!

@AyannaPressley @Ilhan Asylum isn't granted to ppl wanting better job or just a better life.

@BethMosher5 @ronimompiche @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @CBP @BarackObama The reason govt doesn't know where many are is because they are in hiding afraid of being deported, living on the street or being sold for sex by gangs &amp; traffickers.

@BethMosher5 @ronimompiche @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @CBP @BarackObama Agreed!

@MikeClarence2 @KTHopkins Unfortunately, sir, you are clearly misinformed on this issue. They are definitely not the only ones, but absolutely there are Muslim grooming gangs... especially in areas w/ increased migration of Muslim men.

@nicolathorp_ While understand @Gillette's goal, I think they sorely missed the mark w/ this ad. As a mom, I don't appreciate the assumption my son is intuitively a horrible man - just because he's a male - so must be changed! Hate how feminist movement is committed to demasculinize our men!

@woodymumster @hnelke1973 @KTHopkins You may not like @KTHopkins for her political views, but that doesn't make her statements in this video any less true.
@woodymumster @KTHopkins I personally don't care about your politics. Only care about getting word out about human trafficking. There are grooming gangs across the world &amp; the fact is that there is a huge problem with Muslim migrants. Doesn't mean they're the only ones, but they're involved regardless!
