@donoteat1 I, for one, look back at shutting that fool down on twitter as one of my personal 2018 highlights.
@dieken @ryanlcooper It’s apples &amp; oranges. See when Boeing tried to make rapid transit vehicles in the 70s. &amp; seriously, Elon Musk is being lauded for driving an electric car in a sewer tunnel. He did not invent electric cars &amp; bought a used sewer TBM.
@Vpolmac @mattyglesias All he did was buy a used sewer tunnel boring machine from Oakland. Elon Musk is a charlatan.
@dieken @ryanlcooper The guy bought a used sewer tunnel boring machine. He did not include any vents or emergency exits—or make it bi-directional. He’s probably lying about total costs. You are getting the wool pulled over your eyes by a charlatan who wants our tax dollars to support his bullshit.
@SarahMaslinNir @MTA @emmagf Almost makes you wonder whether the trade off for deep tunnel construction &amp; endless problems like this were worth avoiding the temporary headaches of shallow cut &amp; cover.
@clifford_banes @The_Albatross @kevinrschultz @eliotwb @ne0liberal The thing here is—&amp; this is the disconnect—my city is built around public transit for everyone. Does this mean there is unlimited freedom? No, but it serves the most good for the most people. Elon’s BS sewer tunnel doesn’t &amp; should not be supported with anyone’s tax dollars.
@clifford_banes @The_Albatross @kevinrschultz @eliotwb @ne0liberal A Jack Russell/Corgi! The bus took under 20 min &amp; cost $2.75.
@clifford_banes @kevinrschultz @The_Albatross @eliotwb @ne0liberal Between this &amp; your other tweets, buddy, you fascinate me.
@clifford_banes @The_Albatross @kevinrschultz @eliotwb @ne0liberal I’ve done exactly that on a bus in New York.
@The_Albatross @clifford_banes @kevinrschultz @eliotwb @ne0liberal That's why low-floor buses are better! &amp; frequent service to lessen the transfer penalty.
@clifford_banes @kevinrschultz @The_Albatross @eliotwb @ne0liberal Also, if the bus is so 'inconvenient' why are you riding it everyday? That logic doesn't in the least bit follow. 		Riding everyday means that it is extremely convenient to your commute.
@clifford_banes @kevinrschultz @The_Albatross @eliotwb @ne0liberal &amp; if your destination is a rapid transit station? Are you carrying a suitcase everyday on your commute? Are you shopping everyday? 		Maybe the issue isn't the form of the commute but rather the urban form around it—either way Elon's sewer hole ain't going to fix it.
@c4mer0n @Jamesinclair @kevinrschultz @clifford_banes @eliotwb @ne0liberal So: 	-anyone can ride	-runs on electricity	-is underground		Elon has built a (very) low capacity subway.

@kadska @_thanbo @peterwayner @dopemamapdx @SuePeaseBanitt @rayfinklekicker @TheAtlantic @RCSV Exactly. Our solutions must by nature be iterative &amp; not because of sunk cost but rather because we’ve got well over a century of success with heavy rail transit. I don’t get this “19th century=bad” pathology on the part of AV boosters. Does this look like the gilded age to you? https://t.co/SM2ylhWA08
@_thanbo @peterwayner @kadska @dopemamapdx @SuePeaseBanitt @rayfinklekicker @TheAtlantic @RCSV I haven’t had to wait more than one train but then I’m also an 1 &amp; A train rider, not the Lex. I hope that CBTC can bring some breathing room to crowded platforms—case in point, it takes my A ~38 min from 207 to Chambers (scheduled &amp; generous), but only 33 min in 1931!
@peterwayner @letloosemoose @TheAtlantic These are real ideas that are proven to work... unlike your inanity.
@peterwayner @letloosemoose @TheAtlantic New signals can allow the trains to run safely run closer together, bumping up, for instance, throughput on the 1 to 30k-32k per hour. Likewise, open-gangway would increase capacity by 10% &amp; redesigned stations for better pax flow would decrease platform congestion.
@peterwayner @kadska @dopemamapdx @SuePeaseBanitt @_thanbo @rayfinklekicker @TheAtlantic @RCSV Your tweets are strawmen because you're implying that I'm, for some unfathomable reason, against the disabled. That's bullshit &amp; I called you out on it. Your idea would be terrible for the disabled! "Sure, you can sit, but you'll have to pay extra based on demand".
@peterwayner @kadska @dopemamapdx @SuePeaseBanitt @_thanbo @rayfinklekicker @TheAtlantic @RCSV I'd say that you're wrong. The current examples aren't the fully-featured AVs that you pine for &amp; even then they're still killing people, be they the drivers or folks who happen to be nearby, because this is not a mature tech. It is a distraction, a dangerous utopian one at that.
@peterwayner @kadska @dopemamapdx @SuePeaseBanitt @_thanbo @rayfinklekicker @TheAtlantic @RCSV Holy strawman, Batman! Again, do you actually ride public transit? A 2 min wait is fantastic! That's nigh-on to 30 trains an hour with a pax load over that hour of around 25k. 		"Ours" because charlatans like you want to privatize &amp; restrict a public good to the highest bidder.
@peterwayner @kadska @dopemamapdx @SuePeaseBanitt @_thanbo @rayfinklekicker @TheAtlantic @RCSV Again, your whole reason for this "thought-experiment" is to fix the original sin of AVs: that they won't work safely in shared roadways &amp; the promise of a utopia doesn't seem as nice if you've got to double the roads to accommodate the AV-riding few. (2/2)
@peterwayner @kadska @dopemamapdx @SuePeaseBanitt @_thanbo @rayfinklekicker @TheAtlantic @RCSV So wait. There will be another train in 2 min (at rush). If you want your own personal conveyance, take a cab &amp; leave our public infrastructure alone. (1/2)
@peterwayner @kadska @dopemamapdx @SuePeaseBanitt @_thanbo @rayfinklekicker @TheAtlantic @RCSV Since when does "no one gets off" at Times Sq? Like, I get that you've established your bona fides about riding public transit elsewhere but I don't buy it.
@peterwayner @LeftofCntrfield @thecapitolkitty @TheAtlantic @andrewcuomo runs the subways, not @BilldeBlasio, buddy. Certain fares (seniors, students &amp; maybe the working-poor) are subsidized by the city paying the state-run MTA. On the other hand, you're talking out of your ass about the socioeconomic make up of who rides at rush hour.

@peterwayner @DapLajoie A fool at The Atlantic thought your navel-gazing was worth a column. There's a real debate about the massive lift that fixing the NYC subway will cost &amp; you are fucking with it by offering an easy way out. Your idea is terrible &amp; takes away from that debate.

@peterwayner @Jesselansner @CallMeFebel @robertjkoenig all to fix the overriding problem of AV: they aren't going to work without complete grade separation. This is madness. AVs are not, &amp; likely will not ever be a sliver bullet for urban transit. The only purpose your article serves is to confuse the issue at hand: (2/3)
@peterwayner @Jesselansner @CallMeFebel @robertjkoenig Wasn't one of your harebrained scheme's selling points that it would be cheaper? But aside from that, you want to take a public benefit away from the citizens of NYC to turn it over private companies, for the benefit of the wealthy few (1/3)
@CallMeFebel @peterwayner @Jesselansner @robertjkoenig Well, I mean it’s a gold-plated Segway. So special folks like Peter wouldn’t have to mix with the rest of us straphangers.
@peterwayner @CallMeFebel @Jesselansner @robertjkoenig So you think that people whizzing past one &amp; other at 40 mph with what maybe a foot on either side of without any protective shell around them in a 12’-14’ wide tunnel is safer? What planet are you on?
@User_toey @humantransit @JeffreyGoldberg @JamesFallows @dccdudley With the extent of his defense, I’m pretty sure it isn’t satire.
@peterwayner @humantransit @urbanophile @TheAtlantic Maybe don’t write something quite that facile?
@peterwayner @C_Timb Peak ridership is a couple of million people—where would the excess carriages go during periods of low demand? Oh, that’s right, you’re a self-published hack who should keep their deeply stupid ideas to themselves &amp; not fuck with the fix the subway debate.
