Thank you, @GavinNewsom, for mentioning @realDonaldTrump attention on the high costs of prescription drugs. This IS an area of common ground and we hope you work with him on this important issue. #CASOTS
.@GavinNewsom brags about suing Huntington Beach over housing requirements, but hasn't mentioned the state giving Marin County, where he's lived for the past 8 years, a free pass on housing. #casots	 	https://t.co/PqZ5NvgKam
Alzheimer's is a tragic disease. Thank you @GavinNewsom and @mariashriver for focusing on it. #casots
.@GavinNewsom just appointed @Mayor_Steinberg to fight homelessness in the state. 		Ironically, on their way to #casots this morning both men witnessed what a terrible job @Mayor_Steinberg is doing fighting homelessness in Sacramento.
.@GavinNewsom and @CA_Dem finally admitting that @JerryBrownGov absurd projects are impractical and a waste of money (even though they fought for these projects for years). #casots https://t.co/fHzdXwp52w
Sorry, @GavinNewsom, but billions have ALREADY been wasted on high-speed rail		Abandoning this project, which is billions over budget and years behind schedule and will never be built, will simply save the state from wasting billions more. #CASOTS
It's disappointing to hear @GavinNewsom describe the enforcement of laws at the border as "political theatre." The irony is stunning. #casots
Instead of just blindly opposing @POTUS in his first #CASOTS, Gov. @GavinNewsom should instead focus on real CA issues such as housing, water, transportation costs &amp; DMV. 		Make this about Californians, not petty partisan politics. 		https://t.co/leTBbSrxbv

@FromBenC @TheRealJohnHCox That's because the Dems in the #CAGovDebate have no original ideas. They even keep sharing and recycling the "bridges not walls" line. Of course, they love the gas tax, none of which goes to building bridges, so who actually knows what they're really talking about.
