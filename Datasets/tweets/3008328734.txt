Mother accused of murder was stopped for speeding. Passenger alerted deputy to potential of problem with child. @MinotDailyNews

@GasBuddyGuy There has been feelers out from others, but mostly small-scale. No plans for a large refinery that I've heard of

@GasBuddyGuy Sounds like everyone is seeing this strange pinch. In ND we benefit with higher oil prices, but low oil and high gas is tough
