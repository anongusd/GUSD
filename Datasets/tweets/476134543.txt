SB21 passes as amended 85-0-13.

Rep Merika Coleman at the podium filibustering SB21. Not that Rep Coleman doesn't support SB21, but she is obviously making a point. (Rep Coleman is the House sponsor of Senator Smitherman's Racial Profiling Bill that failed to receive the required procedural vote last Thursday).
The Calendar has been adopted, and now Rep Connie Rowe is presenting SB21. SB21 would establish a One-Time Lump Sum retirement payment for retired Alabama Teachers. This payment would occur in December 2017.

SB323 passed 96-4-0 Rep Brown withdrew his amendment that would have assisted JSU. I commend Rep Brown for his attempt. It was a good amendment with builtin safeguards to payback the borrowed Funds as soon as Insurance funds were received. Basically it would have been a loan.

HB225, Juvenile Justice Reform, Passed 69-20-2.
OK, I misunderstood the part about Juvenile Probation Officers not attending the Public Hearing. The fact is, Juvenile Probation Officers spoke at the Public Hearing. However, we're now hearing from House members, that no Juvenile Probation Officer was involved in this process.

Rep Thomas Jackson at the podium discussing HB161 with Rep Sells. It appears that some of my Democrat colleagues are taking the opportunity  to discuss situations where individuals may be justified in killing a First Responder. This is a very different filibuster.
Rep John Knight at the podium talking to Rep Sells about a specific situation in Montgomery where a plain clothed Officer kicked the door in on the wrong house.
Rep Bracy is at the podium discussing HB161 with Rep Sells. Rep Bracy is asking for clarification on whether a First Responder working a part-time job would be covered? Or, the officer working undercover and the perpetrator doesn't realize their victim is a police officer?

HB317 passes 79-7-8.
Bottom Line on HB317: It is said that companies who may be looking to move to Alabama are very cautious about letting their competition know where they are looking. Currently, Economic Developers / Sight Selectors feel they must register as a Lobbyist to look at Ala property.
Rep Mike Jones is stating specific sections of the AG's Bill that have been used in an amendment that is currently being offered for HB317. Rep Jones states HB317 is not a Get Out Of Jail Free Card. Rep Jones states HB317 is a Good Bill that is needed.
Rep Mike Jones is at the podium giving Rep Johnson examples for why this Bill is needed. Rep Jones states that the Ethics Commission asked the Legislature to address this issue because it was causing a problem in the area of Economic Development. Rep Jones states HB317 is Clear!
Rep John Knight at the podium questioning the term "Pre-certified by the Ethics Commission." Rep Knight tells Rep Johnson that he believes that "authorization" may possibly allow someone to think they can do what they want to.
Rep Johnson tells Rep McCampbell that the Ethic's Commission wanted the question of "Who Is Classified as a Lobbyist" and "Who is actually an Economic Development Professional", better clarified.
Rep AJ McCampbell is at the podium questioning Rep Johnson about HB317. Rep McCampbell asked if HB317 was a Backdoor way of undoing some of the Ethics laws that were passed in 2010?
HB317 deals with Economic Development. The Bill better identifies who must register as a Lobbyist. Rep Johnson is telling Rep John Rogers that HB317 does not amend the Alabama's ethics laws. He states this bill deals strictly with the code section addressing Commerce.
The 17th Legislative Day has begun in the Alabama House of Representatives. However, as will happen, my Democrat colleagues obviously have a problem with our first Bill. HB317 presented by Rep Ken Johnson.

My friend, you are partially correct. There are, and have been, opponents to Permitless Carry who have been calling, emailing, and texting their concerns. Sadly, most people do not take the initiative to show up to Committee Meetings and voice their opinions.   But, some will!!! https://t.co/Qxxb7SCAmA
You are correct, no one was present at the committee hearing to speak in favor of the bill. It is not unusual for there to be only opponents present at a committee hearing. The opposition is usually the reason for the Committee Public Hearing. https://t.co/IPG2lRZaDm
Rep England was correct when he stated Rep Greer‚Äôs HB34 will have no effect on the Stand Your Ground Law. The Judy committee changed Rep Greer‚Äôs original bill considerably. A church is considered private property where a church member already has Stand Your Ground Protection. https://t.co/TXOsm4fYnN

Rep Fincher as requested SB14 be substituted for HB13. (These two bills are identical bills. This would allow one piece of legislation to move forward for the governor to sign into law.) Good practice.

The TEN MINUTE Calendar is a method to move through a number of Bills in a short period of time. HOWEVER, each member of the House can speak on a Bill for "10 Minutes." ONE House member has the power to KILL the Bill. (Bills placed on 10 min. calendar should be noncontroversial)
The Alabama House is now in for our 10th Legislative Day of the 2018 Legislative Session. We are going through the procedure of giving second reading to Bills recently filed. About to get started on today's TEN MINUTE Calendar. If not voted on in 10 minutes, the Bill is killed.

Rep Treadaway's HB397 is up for vote, and Rep Ledbetter immediately goes to mic with cloture motion. In 10 min. we will have a vote.
That should of been "Stroke"of midnight, not stoke. All Righty!
At stoke of midnight the session ends, and today's calendar of bills to be voted on are gone. Some community's legislation is gone! Politics
So, if the Republican Representatives are going to pass any bills, we will have to file a cloture motion to cut down a lengthy debate.......
After a cloture motion is made, and a three/fifths votes passes the motion, then the opposition can talk for 10 min before a vote is called.
to cut down the number of bills that the Republican Majority can pass this session by taking their individual 20 min. each per bill to talk.
For those who don't understand the democrats talking about having to use the House Rules, let me try to explain. They are using filibuster..

If we to cloture to move on, and cut short some democrat filibuster like Rep Coleman, there will be voices raised about not giving a voice.
Well, we have two hours to hopefully discuss and pass 20 pieces of legislation on tonight's calendar. However, we may have to cloture?
Rep Merika Coleman is at the microphone taking her 10 minutes to debate the 11:30 a.m. time we are scheduled to start session next Tuesday.
We have 2 hours and 44 minutes to conduct Alabama Business. Well, the Democrats are back at the mic attempting to make another motion. Yep!

Rep Standridge telling members that, if Fantasy Contest Bill passes,  "Organized Gambling" will call all their machines a "Fantasy Contest."
We took two votes, and the Fantasy Contest Bill failed. Then we were informed the voting machines had malfunctioned and the Bill had passed.
Fantasy Contest Bill states: Section 6. Article 2 of Chapter 12 of Title 13A, Code of Alabama 1975, does not apply to fantasy contests. Wow!
The language in the Fantasy Contest Bill is very suspicious. It states the Alabama Gambling Laws will not apply to fantasy Contests. Wow!
Make that Rep Ron Johnson.
HB354 is being presented by Rep Roy Johnson. This bill would legalize Fantasy Contests in Alabama.
SB32 Passes 68-31-1
Rep John Rogers says that SB32 could cause Alabama HS students to quit school, and then, they might end up in an Alabama prison. (I promise)
SB32 would require Ala HS students pass the same 100 question multiple choice Civics test that's required of people seeking US citizenship.
SB32 is sponsored by Sen Orr in the Senate and Rep Collins in the House. It is apparent that my Democrat colleagues are not supportive.
Today is an interesting day in the House. We are on the First Bill of the day that deals with Passing a Civics Test to graduate High School.

@TheDaleJackson You make a good point. I will not be the deciding yes vote for the BIR.
I'm looking forward to the discussion of the needs for road and bridge repairs and construction. I will vote for the BIR, but against Bill.
Rep Poole at the mic talking about HB487 and the undeniable need for improving Alabama's roads, bridges, and infrastructure.
Rep Mary Moore at mic talking about not trusting the Jefferson County Commission or Bham City Council with road money they receive. Wow!
I do not question the need for road and bridge repairs and new construction. It is needed. I do question funding it with new revenue.
Two Questions: Do we need to review our 93% earmarked revenues? Do we need to answer the 1st question before passing another earmarked tax?
In 1954 Alabama Earmarked 89 percent of the budget revenues. We were #1 in the nation then. We have remained #1 in the Nation in earmarking.
I can't talk about Budget Reform and Unearmarking, then vote for a fuel tax earmarked for ALDOT. We need to finish budget reform FIRST.
Alabama currently receives around $30 Billion Dollars annually to operate our two state budgets. The legislature has discretion over 7%.
My position is very clear. I am the chair of the subcommittee to study Alabama Budgets that are 93 percent earmarked. I am not a hypocrite.
We're currently in a filibuster of the Special Order Calendar. The reason is the first Bill on the calendar is HB487 to raise our gas tax.

Rep Daniels is at the podium discussing, well, a lot of topics. It's a Full blown Democrat filibuster to keep Gen Fund Bill from coming up.
Rep Rogers tells Rep South he is totally confused about HB157. A dept. has the money, but now we have to give them authority to spend it....

Are we now depending on Federal Matching Money to operate certain Alabama departments and agencies? The answer is Yes.
A good portion of Alabama's earmarked revenues has been earmarked over the years to draw down Federal Matching Money. Are we now depending..
