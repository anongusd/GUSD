@youwildinfam there’s culpability on the Clary’s part for their daughter getting involved with him. I’m def not blaming them for him being a rapist, but for them allowing their 17 yr old to get on stage w/ him, despite knowing abt him being a rapist AND how sexual his shows are.

@tiniebeany Nope. It’s not just you.  I feel the same way.
@TheKentertainer @K_ToSay @AngelaEdwards @BrettKavanaugh Simply put, in my opinion, the FBI should have interviewed all (approx.)40 witnesses who came forward.  The investigation was limited in time and in scope, thereby making it incomplete.  Again, that’s just my opinion.
@MaryMaryFlorida No, I am not. My tweets are not “anti-American”. They are my own opinions, which I, like you, am entitled to. 		With respect to being professional, this is just Twitter, not a real courtroom. Thanks.
@Bornabrit1 Fuck all the tweeting and hashtags.  It’s all BS.  Instead, let’s go out and get people to register to vote. Sorry for the pessimism. This month has been the most exhausting year.
@PKStanden @BrettKavanaugh I agree - there are innocent people in jail. Our judicial system needs fixing. But so does our attitude towards women. We still have a lot of work to do. Sen. Hatch called Ford “pleasing.” Shes a smart, accomplished woman and all he can see is her attractiveness?
@PKStanden @BrettKavanaugh This should not have been made into a political circus. That seat could have remained vacant until a more thorough investigation was completed. They should have talked to every single person who came forward.
@VictoriadParks2 @BrettKavanaugh I guess you were there. Do tell.
@PKStanden @gshell1234 @BrettKavanaugh I’m not saying women do not lie, but what political gain does Dr. Ford have?  A complete investigation should have taken place and the report made public.
@VictoriadParks2 @BrettKavanaugh They never interviewed people who WANTED to corroborate her story. The investigation was a sham and VERY limited in scope, and it took less than a week.
@PKStanden @BrettKavanaugh I’m a woman. 😊 		Let me make this simpler, it was not a threat. It was simply saying he better hope they never have to go through what Dr. Ford went through.  I was in no way threatening nor wishing such a disgusting thing on anyone. Understand that.
@gshell1234 @PKStanden @BrettKavanaugh 1) I am a woman; 2) I have a daughter; 3) I have been sexually assaulted. My point is the only way they’re going to listen is if something directly affects them or their family.  Until then, we’ll keep being told to sit down and shut up.
@PKStanden @BrettKavanaugh Maybe you should ask for additional context before you reach a mischaracterized assumption.
@PKStanden @FBI @POTUS Sweety, I’m a woman and a mother to a little girl. There’s no “sinister character.”  My point is, a clear message has been sent today that women don’t matter.  I have male friends with daughters who’ve said, “I hope no one does to my daughters what I’ve done to girls/women b4.”
@AryaResists And then we witnessed republicans say, “Fuck you” on 10.6.18.
@SheilaABaker No, we should not take a knee. Taking a knee is to end police brutality and should not be conflated with sexual assault.  Instead, what we should do is cover our mouths, just like Kavanaugh allegedly covered Ford’s.
With #KavanaughConfirmed we definitely need to #FireproofMueller
@TheKalenAllen 🤣🤣🤣 @ “what in the vegans gone wild”
@LadyNorcal Yes you will. I am. These senators are telling us loudly and clearly that we simply do not matter.

@shannoncoulter I agree with you re Ivanka. Melania, however, she’s just waiting for him to drop dead so she can get whatever she’ll be entitled to.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Correction: DJT does not know the Constitution and the contents contained therein. The only thing he knows about the rule of law is that he believes he’s above it. Stop kissing his ass and wake up already.
@maiiam_324 @balleralert Let’s just say the heist wasn’t staged, as you’re suggesting, how tough can you really be at gunpoint?
@olliebear1101 @TheRickyDavila @GOP’s failure to do a damn thing. 		Those children are going to be scarred for life because our soulless leaders decided that they should be treated like garbage. I won’t say animals because not even animals should be treated that way.
@MallyMack_ Sometimes I think designers put shit like this out to test their customers’ loyalty (or stupidity). You know there is some Balenciaga-obsessed fool who saw this and said, “that shit is hot”.
@VABVOX My heart just breaks seeing those kids who don’t even know if they’ll be reunited with their parents. How can we do this to another human being just because they’re from another country?  		Is this written in any religious books?

@_swervvvv This looks like a progressive story about how you made your momma a grandma by giving birth to a CHEK.
@BirdieAwards @RedTRaccoon @chrislhayes @BryanDawsonUSA As a mother, my heart is so heavy looking at this picture. How can anyone do this to another human? Worse, a child?  Yes, they’re immigrants, but what they are not are animals.  I’m so ashamed of this country and it’s so-called leadership. #fucktrump #WhereAreTheChildren
@PetsRockHMB @ADL_Education Not really. Do you think they embark on this journey thinking that their child is going to be taken from them?  Their only thoughts are of a better life.
@KimKardashian Kim, I ❤️ you, trust me, I do, but there are almost 1500 children inexplicably missing. You can use your platform for much bigger, relevant things that dragging through the mud someone we don’t even know. 	#WhereAreTheChildren
@realDonaldTrump Exhibits A, B, and C. 		Dumbass. https://t.co/3gl1ppughB
as a mother, they would have to tranquilize me because I would be like a raging fucking bull breaking down EVERYONE’s door looking for my children.  #WhereAreTheChildren?!
@eugenegu @kim @realDonaldTrump If I’m not mistaken, the judge did not order him to unblock anyone. I believe that she ruled that he cannot block anyone else. Either way, you won. Congratulations!
@HiltonHotels Not a damn thing! 😀		BTW - I stayed in an executive suite at Hilton Niagara in Canada and, I must say, what a wonderful experience.  The 2-bdrm suite was amazing, as well as the amenities and service. Have been recommending to all of my friends/family.
@unicornsresist Because they don’t give a fuck. Remember what Kelly said, “they’ll go in foster care...or whatever”. That “whatever” meant “whatever, we don’t give a fuck.”

@drinkingtee No, I live off of cooked food, which is usually not done in a refrigerator. However, liquids are usually better served cold. Unless you store your milk in the pantry.
@charlotteky @realDonaldTrump I agree. That letter did not read like one any doctor would prepare. 		What I am surprised about, however, is the doctor’s willingness to put his license on the line for a patient, no matter how long he’s been treating him.

@KaivanShroff 🙄 People need to pay attention. She wasn’t talking about her appearance. She said, “SHE BURNS FACTS AND USES THE ASHES TO MAKE A PERFECT SMOKEY EYE” she was talking about her dishonesty, not appearance!

@EdKrassen @HappyProgressiv Not if Trump decides to pardon him, which I expect him to do for many people. Unfortunately, the GOP continue to fail the American people by doing nothing. I just can’t wrap my head around anything anymore. What a crazy place this Trumpistan is right now.

@TheRickyDavila @realDonaldTrump It’s not surprising. Trump doesn’t give a fuck about anyone but himself...and Ivanka.
@davidhogg111 I’m happy to walk out....but where am I going? Lol
@GOPChairwoman And the @GOP’s efforts to discredit Comey are an immature joke. You haven’t realized that loyalty is a one way street with Trump. He doesn’t care about any of you, just what you can do/cover up for him.
@GOP Grow up. This stupid website is not going to damage @Comey’s credibility.
@MichaelAvenatti I have been saying this all morning: his tweet is misleading and wrong. Not surprising. As I’m sure you know, crime-fraud is the exception to A/C privilege. If the communication is to commit and/or cover up crime, it’s not privileged.
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump My point exactly. He clearly does not know and/or understand the crime-fraud exception.  Donald Trump thinks he’s a lawyer, and his best lawyer. As they say, “a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client.”
A/C privilege is not a thing of the past. Clearly, he doesn’t know and/or understand the crime-fraud exception.  	What’s telling is that his attorneys are “wondering when...” https://t.co/HtJljG1g25
@realDonaldTrump The exception to the attorney-client privilege is crime-fraud.  The attorney-client communication is not privileged if it’s intention is, inter alia, to commit fraud or crime.  Otherwise, your communication would be subject to an in camera inspection.
@realDonaldTrump Your “presidency” is a literal facepalm https://t.co/skP6z2CUrD
@realDonaldTrump This is stupid. Comey released something damaging to Clinton because he knew she was going to win and he wanted a job? So he knew you were going to keep him as director of FBI if you won?

@AnaCabrera @realDonaldTrump @RepGaramendi It’s not a matter of should he have. WHY DIDN’T HE?!  At this point, he’s probably a bigger threat to us than ISIS.  All for what?

@shannonrwatts What is going on with our children? I think we need to go back to spanking. Kids no longer fear their parents and, in turn, they’re not fearing any authority.

@AprilDRyan It’s sad that they have to rally and beg lawmakers to protect them from being slaughtered at school.  It’s even more sad that those same lawmakers think porn is more dangerous than guns.
@AnnCoulter Cut it out, Ann, you don’t have any friends.  No one likes you.
You may not care about our children, @realDonaldTrump, but you should care enough to not want them to be slaughtered.

@GeekVibesNation Me too!  I thought she was being accused of sexual assault, too.
@MacgyveringM22 Agreed!  @IKEAUSA‘s “Trofast” bins and frames are the best!
@SallyStrange Because  you don’t agree with my position, I must be quiet? I support facts, not genders. It’s unfair for us judge when we don’t know both sides, especially when one side sent mixed signals to a guy who was obviously horny. If you don’t want sex, leave.Don’t wait for a back rub.
@SallyStrange Ive read the article in its entirety. I’m not dismissing anything, so there’s no need to be combative. I’m open to conversation without controversy. I just don’t understand why not text someone for help?  Why perform oral sex, even just for a short while?
@SoDamnTrue Never. But damn, now I will.
@_ShamGod @anildash @CaitlinPacific I have been sexually assaulted more than once, so I speak from that pain. But, I’m sorry, her story is all over the place. She was texting her friends throughout the night; why not text someone “I’m feeling scared. I’m at [address], send help”. Don’t put his penis in your mouth!
@WSJ @charley_ck14 As much as I hate this man, after listening to this many times, he does say “I’d”. You have to listen verrrry closely.  Doesn’t make him any less of a #shithole, though.

@PressSec FAKE NEWS
@realDonaldTrump FAKE PRESIDENT
@realDonaldTrump The same wall that Mexico was going to pay for?
@bryanbehar @JumpTheRework Maybe he will learn how to take a shower
@StollmeyerEU Yes, but he said he was willing to testify with respect to his interactions with Comey.  What should be held against Trump is his position that his team has been cooperative with the investigation because they want to prove there was no collusion.  Let him testify on live TV!
@EdKrassen He also said, “And we’ve seen this before in our history — where people who have tried to pop in who are not in politics and have had a difficult time adjusting.”  he was definitely alluding to  the #stablegenius presently occupying the WH.
@RedTRaccoon I can’t wait for the WH to deny the fact that he doesn’t know the lyrics. I’d love for someone to make him prove he knows the lyrics and make him sing.
@yoallen78 @HuffPost @hm Sorry, but this being a mistake doesn’t pass the smell test. Negative publicity is still publicity. Thy knew what they were doing.
@ChrisCuomo do you really write your own tweets/responses?
@becky_dee1 @ABC I seriously hate this man!  		Is it just me or was the crowd booing him?
@badmovieman @krassenstein We’d be better off with the bowl of soup.
@DrDenaGrayson The reason is because Trump doesn’t have a long enough attention span to sit for a deposition. Perhaps mueller &amp; team should wear gorilla costumes. That’ll keep Trump’s attention.
@krassenstein The only time you should want to serve interrogatories is when the action largely involves contracts, or mostly paper documents. In this case, I’d definitely, definitely want Trump’s deposition.  I’d also want Melania’s.
@marcorubio It’s good that you wrote “Psalms 8:10” or else President pyschopants would have thought you were praising him.
