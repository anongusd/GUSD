Its saddening to see how far apart our beautiful country‚Äôs citizens become divided every single day. We need to bring back the day when we would care for others as Americans first and foremost rather than demean others based on their political beliefs.

Why do most people who argue for their political stance end up demanding they have the moral high ground rather than the factual high ground. On every side of the political apeirogon people cry that they are always the most morally correct. Facts and information can trump morals.

It is obvious that notoriety is a key player in the minds of those sick enough to shoot up a school. @realDailyWire has it down by not mentioning names and showing pictures of the shooters. Keeping the perpetrators' names out of the media can be a step towards ending this crisis.
