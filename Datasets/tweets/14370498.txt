@weezy2033 @BuckSexton Adults sold to pet homes are usually house trained &amp; mannered so they're good for ppl who don't want to deal w pups.
@weezy2033 @BuckSexton I was going by what you said about cost. You could get one cheaper but maybe not a puppy.
@BuckSexton The crazy "rescue" people were angry when Obama &amp; Biden both got purebred dogs because the "good" people all rescue, of course.
@weezy2033 @BuckSexton Some breeders have retired champions they "retire" into pet homes and they are not as expensive as a puppy.
@BuckSexton Pit bull mix is not proper unless one knows one of the parents was actually a pit bull. The proper term is bully breed mix.

@BuckSexton Swift has to be a Democrat bc her fan base of millennials would lose their minds if she wasn't. Like Bieber &amp; the abortion thing
@youngblackcon OR that if one is already registered, why should they have to have an ID if their name is already on the list.
@youngblackcon The argument I have seen is that it's too much of a challenge to get an ID, and/or cost is an issue.
@BuckSexton What do you think of Donald and Hillary now having access to intelligence briefings?
@BuckSexton Yes, Ronnie Dunn is one I can think of off the top of my head. Google him.
@JohnFromCranber They worked hard to get where they are, so obvs they don't count. ;)

@TiamoLisa I've wanted to call in b/c of a comment  @BuckSexton made about adopting from shelters 2 weeks ago but there's not enough time.
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton Indeed. We are on count down on the days that a puppy can be born in someone's home and not in a sterilized kennel.
@BuckSexton Are you going to go buy a bulldog mix for $5k? lolol
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton They put them all together and want everyone to adopt from a shelter.
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton I am with you. They use that type of propaganda to promote the anti-breeder agenda. There are good and bad breeders.
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton Oh, you didn't know? Service dogs &amp; ALL domestic dogs are enslaved by people according some. Purpose doesn't matter.
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton Are you aware of massive anti-breeder legislation across the country? Talk about BIG government nonsense.
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton This is the crazy notion of people who push the anti-breeder agenda - they don't want ANYONE's dogs to reproduce.
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton Unless u adopt from a "rescue" or a shelter, u are contributing to overpopulation which is ridiculous and you suck!
@BuckSexton "adopt don't shop," you would have a very hard time having your dog - unless you acquired her from a socially acceptable source.

@Jay_Severin Do you think you would have gotten care like that if you were on an Obama Care plan...?
RT @verumserum: Clinton's repeated statement about "marked classified" sounds more and more like a legal defense dependent on her ignorance.
@Jay_Severin it's not that big of a deal. We all know Glenn is all about Cruz so it's not like you lied or committed a felony.
@BuckSexton @SamiSuzie That's the only down side to the show - there are very few rebuttals. U need to get back on the EIB for opposition.

@moecrowther @BuckSexton Also, what happens when m/f trans people want to be a Ranger? Would they try before or after? That could be next!
@moecrowther I do, too. Sometimes physics is against them as well as male/female relations in general.
@moecrowther I think it would be fine IF they held the females to the same standards as the males, I don't think they do!
@moecrowther Since @BuckSexton has such an adversity to girls playing ball on boys' teams and all, I wondered how he felt  about the Rangers
@BuckSexton You should have the option of holding a call through the break.

@DoggieZen Hi, do you have a youtube channel?
@BuckSexton The only thing we disagree on is the talent of Taylor Swift. Haha
@moecrowther English and History ARE so much better.
@BuckSexton if you ran for president and won, you could have more influence on education. ;)
@BuckSexton But did you go to a regular public high school or a fancy private one?

@BuckSexton We're doing the fighting that the Iraqis won't do? Wtf. I think the Iraqis don't mind just leave it to them. But that's just me.

@BuckSexton No, they're getting the CHEAPEST from around the world. #teambuck
@moecrowther Maybe the Clinton Foundation can help them pay them off. After all, they are for the common man. ;)

@BuckSexton Hilary accomplishments: 1) Empowering women 2) Extending technology 3) Brought US out of isolation in regards to foreign policy.
@BuckSexton If you could only vote for Bernie, Hilary or Lincoln, which would be your poison? #momentoftruth
@BuckSexton The "illegal" market? Heheh.
@BuckSexton He was on Coast to Coast last night and I think you would appreciate his case in regards to the FTC. He reminded me of you.
@BuckSexton I strongly urge you to get Michael J. Daugherty who wrote Devil Inside the Beltway on your show.
@BuckSexton Turn on Coast to Coast! They are talking about FTC over reach and harrassment!
@BuckSexton You'll lose your mind if you research &amp; find that they want others to help them pay for reassignment through ObamaCare coverage.
@BuckSexton should be an anatomy teacher. "Their special parts." You CAN take off a part and make a new part AND/OR try to grow other parts.
@BuckSexton I'm sorry. At least I tried! I liked Wedding Crashers though! You couldn't get through a JLo movie so what can I say. Hahahahaha
@angelaisms @BuckSexton True that!
@BuckSexton He should stuff it? So harsh! I tried to get through Office Space and I couldn't.
@BuckSexton Dead air speaks volumes. Hilary depends on these types of people to vote for her and there are WAY too many.
@angelaisms He's never gonna be able to handle @BuckSexton.
@autofixer Hahahaha You are on point!
@BuckSexton BETTER FOREIGN POLICY? Has Cedric never heard of Benghazi?! Wtf. #teambuck
@BuckSexton My question is, what're we supposed to do? Like if a kid wants to take a gun to school, they will. If they wanna spy, they will.

@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton I do appreciate your point though. I can't say I would never do it but it would have to be dire circumstances.
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton A person wo a gun is less likely to lose their home &amp; end up in a shelter than a dog who can't bark.
I just figured out how to change my header image. My beautiful Declan and Mayer at the dog park!
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton As someone who owns a barky breed, I'm empathetic to the owners. I'd move before the law forced me to debark my Sams.
@TiamoLisa @BuckSexton It sounds cruel and unusual to you, but I would ask that you do some research into the procedure.
@BuckSexton Do you have any sources as to how the court came up with the $240k amount in the Oregon case?
@BuckSexton Sorry so lengthy, those questions really require an email reply. Haha
@BuckSexton I think debarking can be a valid treatment. If every other method's been exhausted &amp; the dog won't stop barking inappropriately.
@BuckSexton AND I would really love to know who and how they deemed the dogs ill-suited as “livestock guardians.”
@BuckSexton However, I would like to know if what they call "incessant" barking IS incessant or if they have a vendetta. It does occur.
@BuckSexton I am conflicted as someone who owns both a "barky"/herding breed. I think they should keep their dogs' barking to a minimum.
@BuckSexton That's the nutshell version.
@BuckSexton Think climate change, only with militant people who want to "fix" the population of primarily dogs and cats.
@BuckSexton The belief that EVERY pet should be spayed or neutered because of the massive population of homeless pets.
@BuckSexton Debarking or bark softening is less invasive than neutering.
@BuckSexton I hope you don't buy into the ideology of "pet over population" in the United States.

@BuckSexton If it cost me almost $20 for a ticket to see a movie, I'd never go to the theatre, I don't blame you. #mondaypodcast #iamcheap
@BuckSexton Ferguson is OLD NEWS. Let's move on w other news stories so it will fade out like the Trayvon situation #mondaypodcast #freezone

@912calgal @BuckSexton I called at like 12:20 or something but it's no biggie. Buck will be around to talk to for a long time.
@BuckSexton Good job on five hours of show today!!! #shieldshigh
@912calgal @GooGwaba I called about The National Dog Show. I think his screener was not into it. It's a political show, not a dog show. Haha
@912calgal @GooGwaba I called in and the screener answered on the first ring. They want a lot of detail on what you wanna talk about. LOL
@BuckSexton Thank you, we have high hopes for these babies!!!
@BuckSexton Talking dogs, here is my boy, Ch Declan's, 1st litter born on 11/26! 3 boys &amp; 5 girls #samoyeds #teambuck http://t.co/z7oFoNlnL7
@BuckSexton Have you ever attended Westminster Kennel Club in NYC? I want to go one year but it's so far away.
@BuckSexton SAMOYEDS ROCK!!!!!!!!!! I need to take you to a dog show some day and school you, Sir. #JUSTSAYIN
@BuckSexton Ready for the next 2 hours! You oughta be able to get through all of your notes today! I am almost finished shopping. #teambuck
@MiaVeritas @BuckSexton They prefer to call it "passionate"!
RT @MiaVeritas: @BuckSexton It doesn't matter.  They're angry and will not be ignored. They're also a bit mad. #FatalFergsonAttraction
@BuckSexton You aren't on Wikipedia yet, either!
@BuckSexton http://t.co/mR4WORSJQs why are they always twisting everything. lol Keira didn't say it was inaccurate.
@BuckSexton The gorgeous Samoyed, Bogey, got RBIS! Well deserved, he's been doing well all year. Better luck next year to Freda Frenchie!
FIVE HOURS of @BuckSexton!!! I'm gonna use a lot of data shopping today but #hesworthit #hellyeah #teambuck #freestylefriday #shieldshigh

@broomheadshow Of course Obama doesn't agree with the lack of indictment. lolol
@BuckSexton Too bad there is no time for a Benghazi update. What's going on w that?! Can't wait until you have three hours to talk a day. ;)
@WayneDupreeShow @FTR__Radio Scary. O.o
@GrantGambling  @GovJayNixon Obama might have told him to hold off so the rioters could continue their course, wouldn't surprise me.
@GrantGambling @GovJayNixon I find it extremely interesting, not necessarily funny.
