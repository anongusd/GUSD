@NBCNews NBC thinks everyone is stupid. What they need to take an honest look at: the only people that were not stupid were conservatives who know their history and use their brains!  Look at all the libs that believed their bull!!  NBC shining a light on the stupidity of their viewers!
Amen!! https://t.co/WWwh8NHlqC

@MSNBC And again, you’re just not too bright are you @MSNBC?  Well, bless your hearts.  MAGA!!
@Cernovich Yes, and proud of them!  I lost my little brother 6 weeks ago, and got one for him.  My first I got after losing both breasts to breast cancer.  I am 57, and so glad I didn’t let others ideals of what was beautiful or acceptable stop me from doing what I needed/wanted for me. https://t.co/7Pt3BHSSd6
@CNN NOOOOO...my eyes are very sensitive!!  My stomach, too... 🤮

@Helene0555 @charliekirk11 So liberal like.  Hate sexual assault, right?  But “pretty” women just ask for it I guess??  You might want to rethink your very “tolerant” tweet... Bless your heart.
So this scum makes fun of Steve Scalise almost dying from a liberal lunatic shooting him, and his boss not only backs him, but agrees!  SCUM, both of them! https://t.co/fBLndMlwHx
@martincizmar I can’t even imagine how sick you must be to make fun of a human being that almost died...because of politics.  I guess if someone shot you or someone you love, we should all just laugh?  I would never do that.  Why?  Because I am not scum.  Oh, and your boss is scum, too.
@w_terrence Oh my gosh, I love you sooo much!  Shhhh...don’t tell my husband.  ♥️🤣🤗♥️
Exactly!! https://t.co/mMV3OEuFgy

@KamalaHarris You can’t even uphold the Constitution, or for that matter, hold your legs together while married and having an affair with a married man.  Stop your lies!
@USATODAY @usatodaysports @ByErikBrady Wow!  I hope he sues you for everything your black heart owns.  You need help.  Sick and disgusting!
@Alyssa_Milano @KamalaHarris Thanks, but NO THANKS!  I speak for myself.  No man speaks for me, and no self-serving, man hater speaks for me either.  You both are just sad and pathetic.
@SenFeinstein This circus, and you are the Ringleader, is the exact reason that we, the little people, do not trust career politicians. This confirmation hearing has been a joke. You want to stand up for women? Release the names of your buddies that had taxpayer $ used to pay their victims!
