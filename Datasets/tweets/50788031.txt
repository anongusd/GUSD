@TweetFiction @myserenity69 I'm not confusing Russian trolls with real people. I'm still talking to you, aren't I? Nice to hear you voted and campaigned for the actual Democratic nominee, unlike the #fellowtravelers who voted for the GOP or 3rd party or wrote in Bernie. They're not Dems, repeat, NOT Dems!
@MarkPor72434214 @EdKrassen That's two different thoughts, there. 1) If every Dem voted for the DEMOCRATIC PARTY nominees, we win. I agree, and 2) completely different issue b/c BERNIE IS NOT A DEM! He's a spoiler. He's irrelevant and his followers are bots. That's just a #fact
@MarkPor72434214 @EdKrassen That's not what I said. I said NOW, right now, tell me you are 100%, without reservation, behind Hillary Clinton, if she runs. And if you can't, or won't, welp, there ya go, that's how I feel about DA BERN, or as I call him #thespoiler or #fellowtravelerwiththeGOP.  #NeverBernie
