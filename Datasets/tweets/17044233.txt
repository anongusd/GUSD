Bannon told me he was reluctant to comment (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like punching down‚Äù) but felt he had to because @elonmusk is a ‚Äúman-child and a psychological mess."

@joshtpm I think we‚Äôve jumped topics. Thread was about why Trump canceled an ad buy. My answer from having reported on subject didn‚Äôt satisfy Twitter hive mind thirsting for Russian conspiracy angle, so I will bid all adieu and go to sleep
@joshtpm Honestly, why not? And why the stubborn refusal to consider that Trump‚Äôs team might‚Äôve had a clearer view of the electorate, or at least their own voters, than HRC? She was in AZ days before election! that sure baffled Trump team.
@jmpalmieri @JBSDC @DouthatNYT If DNC data was so good Trump couldn't have won without it, then why did he go to WI and HRC didn't? Her blindness to what was about to befall her shows limited value of that analytics data. Other hacks (emails) were much more valuable to Trump, whether of not there was collusion
@jmpalmieri @DouthatNYT That doesn't rule out collusion in other areas, of course. Plenty of attempts amply documented. But the belief that Trump could only have won with Russian-hacked DNC info makes no sense. His own data team had clearer view of the race than DNC did.
@jmpalmieri @DouthatNYT DNC analytics had no clue Clinton was losing WI, MI, etc. If Russians gave hacked data to Trump, what good would it have done him? Trump's team was looking for **Trump voters** (white, anxious re: race + cultural displacement, etc). CA models pointed to Midwest.

More Kudlow on falling market, in very contentious Bloomberg interview: "That ain't much. I want to put out the facts: We're still in a bull market."

Nunberg to @jaketapper: "Jake, I'm going to send you the subpoena" Please CC me, Sam
More: "I am not a fan of Donald Trump. He treated me like crap." Trump sued Nunberg.
Sam Nunberg just said live on CNN he is refusing to give emails to Mueller involving people he "despises" including "Hope Hicks, who was having an affair with Corey [Lewandowski]"

New Goldman Sachs client note: "The brief shutdown had essentially no effect on financial markets and we do not expect there to be any measurable effect on the economy"
@heartofsunrise1 I'm sure they'll complain loudly. But I'm skeptical they'll shut down govt again to force through a bill they expect to die in the House.
@heartofsunrise1 my own sense, from talking to some mods, is that they were loathe to shutdown this time, will be more so next time -- maybe I'm wrong, we'll see.
@Bareham2016 The Dems connected Dreamers w/govt furlough! They were wrong on strategy.
Feel like shutdown exposed intra-Dem divisions that activist base is insistently ignoring. Idea that Dems are "better positioned" for Round 2 rests on their willingness to shutdown govt again -- yet most moderates seem unwilling + relieved at quick reprieve this time.

And, per FEC filings, Trump campaign paid Cambridge $5.9 million. So the campaign's effort to pretend they weren't a big factor is odd. https://t.co/vWnfdfGZXQ
And Steve Bannon -- the Trump campaign's CEO! -- had an ownership stake in Cambridge Analytica and sat on the board https://t.co/4zoM8toApx
