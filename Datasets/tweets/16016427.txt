Weber, now 70, was sentenced to more than 18 years in prison in January 2019. After nearly 30 years, no one knows how many of Weber’s victims are still out there. #frontlinepbs https://t.co/L8wGUW0iT2
After questions from #frontlinePBS and @WSJ, the Indian Health Service ordered an independent investigation into Weber’s tenure. https://t.co/L8wGUW0iT2 https://t.co/d3D48AN9kk
Weber was found guilty on multiple counts of sexual abuse in Montana. He is appealing. Weber is scheduled to go on trial later this year in South Dakota for alleged abuses there. #frontlinePBS https://t.co/L8wGUW0iT2
In September 2018, Weber stood trial in Montana. The first witness was 35-year-old Joe Four Horns. He said Weber abused him when he was 11 years old. He was asked why he'd never spoken out about the abuse. #frontlinePBS https://t.co/L8wGUW0iT2 https://t.co/bO1qhVmwYl
Years of accusations finally caught up with Weber in 2017. Federal prosecutors charged him with the abuse of four boys on Pine Ridge in South Dakota and two on the Blackfeet reservation in Montana #frontlinePBS https://t.co/L8wGUW0iT2
Searching for Weber's potential victims, the tribal prosecutor focused on the 2006 assault on Weber that sent him to the hospital. She tracked down the name of one of the teenagers involved. It was Paul. #frontlinePBS https://t.co/L8wGUW0iT2 https://t.co/ncWu63QRYt

FRONTLINE asked former Facebooker @elinder if it was known to Facebook in 2014 that there was a potential for Russian disinformation campaigns on the platform. #FacebookFilmPBS https://t.co/8xElXKBZI9
Facebook told FRONTLINE that Shymkiv didn’t raise the issue of misinformation in their meeting, and that their conversations had nothing to do with what would happen in the United States two years later. #FacebookFilmPBS
Facebook was weaponized by Russia years ago in Ukraine – and @dshymkiv, former adviser to the President of Ukraine, says he told Facebook executives about this in June of 2015. #FacebookFilmPBS https://t.co/EkTSZYVxXP
Despite this account, Facebook says it took its FTC order seriously and had large teams of people working to improve users’ privacy. #FacebookFilmPBS
Long before the 2016 election, Sandy Parakilas says he warned Facebook executives of dangers that users’ data could be misused by third-party apps. Their response, he says, was “muted.”	#FacebookFilmPBS https://t.co/HpBClpUQSe

News Feed’s exponential growth was spurred on by the fact that existing laws didn’t hold internet companies liable for all the content being posted on their sites. Here’s an in-depth look at “Section 230,” via @NewsHour https://t.co/BzqUOJUXd7 #FacebookFilmPBS

Inside Facebook, employees were initially skeptical about the “Like” button, says @soleio. But ultimately, he says they were “dead wrong” about its value. #FacebookFilmPBS https://t.co/8IEiWiO0Gc
“News Feed” was a game-changer for Facebook and potential advertisers: “It is designed to make you want to keep scrolling, keep looking,” says former Facebook employee, @mixblender. #FacebookFilmPBS
Naomi Gleit is Facebook’s second-longest serving employee. She's helped lead the team responsible for the platform's aggressive growth. FRONTLINE’s @phelamele pointed out that exponential growth seems to be the cause of some of Facebook's biggest problems. #FacebookFilmPBS https://t.co/QOtNHVYWCr

At rallies and in tweets, President Trump called the leadership of the FBI a "disgrace," and the press "dishonest people." It was a return to the Roy Cohn strategy.  		"He doesn't need a Roy Cohn, because he is Roy Cohn," says @peterbakernyt. #frontlinepbs https://t.co/G2qZIn7DiL

Comey, ousted as the head of the FBI, engineered a leak of his memos to @nytimes, hoping it would lead to the appointment of a special counsel. Because of Sessions' recusal, the decision would fall to Rosenstein. #frontlinepbs https://t.co/GhSe2RrvTt https://t.co/MFnyxNgBDv
On May 11, 2017, Trump was asked by @LesterHoltNBC whether he had already made the decision to fire Comey before meeting with Rosenstein. He said, "I was going to fire regardless of the recommendation," seeming to contradict what the White House had been saying. #frontlinepbs

"A lot of the jobs here in Dayton are minimum wage, no benefits. So by the time they provide all of that to their family, groceries are the last on the list and so they need to come here," says Krys Davidson, who works at @stvincentdayton's food pantry. #frontlinePBS https://t.co/5eKjiV2XLI
.@stvincentdayton is one of dozens of food pantries serving the Dayton area. "People who are coming are people who will probably never recover from the Great Recession," says Sunnie Lain, director of outreach. #frontlinepbs https://t.co/0HiXs5WeD3 https://t.co/UXGQKATBVU

The economic cost of an opioid crisis "is staggering to any one community," says Montgomery County coroner Dr. Kent Harshbarger — but it's especially hard in a small community that's already struggling. #frontlinePBS https://t.co/61NpjnVSfy

As law enforcement cracked down on doctors writing illegal opioid prescriptions, there was an unintended consequence: A rise in heroin use. #frontlinePBS https://t.co/bRYEweix1D
The roots of Dayton’s opioid problem can be traced back to the kind of hard, physical work that once made the city thrive. By 2011, Ohio reported opioid prescriptions had risen 1,000% in the state. #frontlinePBS
The economy has undergone fundamental change, and "wealth lives... on Wall Street or in intellectual property, so in Silicon Valley. It's in a handful of people, a handful of companies and you've had no real growth in the underlying economy," says @RanaForoohar. #frontlinePBS

Manufacturing cities like Dayton have been falling behind more prosperous parts of the country for decades — due to several factors like deregulation, the declining role of labor unions, and shareholders exerting more influence on the way companies did business. #frontlinePBS https://t.co/y3e4qz44np
