Reason why closure of mines. Protesters demand jobs and mines must pay for electricity in the informal settlements Witbank Mpumalanga.
Local businesses are also targeted. Tax evasion. The fight against tax evaders is on. Many mines closed due to unemployment of locals. Witbank Mpumalanga. Legal miners and contracters are warned to stay away from work. WITBANK MPUMALANGA.
Many illegals employing illegals as exploitation. Increase in crime and anti social behaviour. South Afticans are warned not to employ foreigners or face fines of R 10 000.
Crack down of illegals. Persons who are married to South Africans illegally working. Clamp down on illegal trade. Illegal occupation of illegals living on properties. Many illegal businesses closed due to fake goods. As of sell by date food stuff. Tax evasion from many illegals.

@steve_hofmeyr @mogg_jacob @steve_hofmeyr goes to show that British MP's have no clue the history of The 1700 onwards. King George and later King Edward instructed much of the brutal killings on all sides. But Boer stood side by side with Khoi and some Chiefs in the diffent tribes.

Indian, Whites, Muslims, Blacks, Chinese, Khoi lived side by side, there were fun , games, laughter. Enjoying Life , Enjoying Traditions, eating Dalchies, Buny-chow.

These were the Africans (called Bantu in South Africa) along with the Colored (people of mixed black, Malayan, and white descent) and Asian (mainly of Indian ancestry) populations.
Apartheid was mainly aimed towards separating the races; however, this didn't just refer to creating a divide between the whites from non-whites, but also among the 4 racial groups that comprised the non-white community. https://t.co/yCxF4BKdjJ

The march of civilization is a train of felonies, yet, general ends are somehow answered. World Leaders.
Although knaves win in every political struggle, although society seems to be delivered over from the hands of one set of criminals into the hands of another set of criminals, as fast as the government is changed.

We have recently received confirmation from the traffic department that the fine for illegal purchasing of these stolen grapes along the highway has increased from R750 to R1000.		So Beware ‚Äì you have been warned!
The grapes are stolen off the vines at any given time with no regard to these levels so they might not be safe to eat.
Following this growers stick to strict withholding periods from spraying until the fruit is picked to ensure that the chemical residues have dropped to levels that are safe for human consumption.
People that stop to buy the grapes are regularly robbed of their wallets and other valuables. The biggest concern however is Health and Safety. Crop protection chemicals are routinely sprayed onto the grapes to protect them from pests and diseases.
During the harvest season vendors regularly sell stolen grapes along the N1 highway in the Hex River Valley.	We feel obliged to bring the following facts to the attention of the general public:  The vendors are a serious hazard to road safety. https://t.co/JjNhOml7oG

So that more jobs are created but protesting against one or other issue is classed racist but seeing most companies are BEE or run by Muslim to Khoi and Indian and a margin of Whites who employ but denying the employee to jobs who will pay for schools to service delivery

Will expropriate and leave people with nothing. It happened in Venesuela. Equador and Southern America where China loaned but country cannot repay so they start to own property or land.
Not only whites all will loose if you read about all issues facing the world under communism or scialism if a country does not follow the paying back of debt then the creditor will occupy all that is owned by the people. If the country has minerals or land then the creditor https://t.co/OGWLdrXGBV

SAVE OUR ENVIRONMENT TODAY, SAVE THE HUB OF THE GREEN BELT AND SAVE THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD.
China has now taken control of the country, not interested in the Environment. The tribes have not been consulted and many are suffering where the locals are not given jobs and China only uses there own people. Oil spillages are causing a lot of harm to nature
Ecuador has a larger problem with both human and how Government there has sold Ecuador to the Chinese, not a sign to help improve the Environmental Impact  climate and forest, OIL is what is causing much of the issues that is destroying the Environment, for paying back debt.

If the employer reduces the days to say 3 days in a month it's what is not mentioned in the research, many work 3 to 4 days in the month and get R50 to R250 a day, the interesting fact is that a garden team of Foreigners mainly Mozambicans and Zimbabweans charge R250 a garden. https://t.co/Kj6s648u0k

You need to approach the @ConCourtSA it's the right of all citizens to be protected constitutional right to land and property. It's reiterated in all constitutions around the world inniciated from the Geneva Conventions and act regarding the right to live in peace. https://t.co/5TiEHoXiBl
Is not the way forward. Legally speaking land or property owned by foreign legals and nationals who were born or live in in South Africa have the constitutional right to protect there land or property no Government may take land the Geneva Act reiterates that clearly.
ANC ,  EFF and  BLF dictating to 55 Million plus Foreigners as of Migrants that a referendum is denied. Condemned Political parties are supposed to stand together in the rights for a referendum IEC has denied 55 Million people the rights to the constitutional obligation
Been Expropriated and people have been evicted tortured or murdered. @antonioguterres should condemn such and demand The Security Council to intervene without hinderance from South African Ambassedors interference on the Geneva Act.
@MTLekota @Plaid_May @ErnstRoets @Europarl_EN @GermanyUN @ConCourtSA Denying 55 Million people the right to a referendum is a disgrace to the rights to land or property owned by all International Residents who invest and farm in South Africa. No where in the world has any land
South African Government is denying 55 Million people the rights to a referendum it's not up to the three ANC EFF or BLF to decide for 55 Million people. @Our_DA @SolidariDirk @kalliekriel @GroenewaldPJ
Expropriate. Harm. Injure. Murder any citizen of that country, South Africa has a human rights abuses against persons and those of race ( Whites ) No Government or political party has the the right to Expropriate land or properties of any International whites. @antonioguterres
All political parties apposing the Expropriation The Voice of The Hague must be heard. Switzerland The Geneva Act reiterates that non war entities such as citizens living in a country who lives and has bought land or properties. No Government may infringe.
Power outages due to Mafia in ANC EFF BLF now they refuse to hold a referendum which is a legal obligation for all living in South Africa. Eskom belongs to The Arogant Trio. Ignorant to allow 55 Million people who don't agree with TRIO tatics of stealing mudering innocent people.

Minority rights may also apply simply to individual rights of anyone who is not part of a majority decision. No one may infringe upon a nation such as ethnic race or colour, farmers and businesses and individuals. Defying that right you as Government can be held liable.
Minority rights are the normal individual rights as applied to members of racial, ethnic, class, religious, linguistic or gender and sexual minorities; and also the collective rights accorded to minority groups.
[1] and individual rights such as privacy and the freedoms of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.
Civil rights include the ensuring of peoples' physical, mental integrity, life, and safety; protection from discrimination on grounds such as race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, color, age, political affiliation, ethnicity, religion, and disability
They ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and political life of the society and state without discrimination or repression.
Civil and political rights are a class of rights that protect individuals' freedom from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals. https://t.co/ykCecahPXp
