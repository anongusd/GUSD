It‚Äôs a common mistake among rookie politicians + it‚Äôs understandable. We all use our previous experience to solve new problems. As good as the soundbites of government running like a business or a family budget are, the reality is the government runs like neither for a reason 5/5
Trump‚Äôs making the same mistake here, arguing that because walls protect the homes of the wealthy, they will also work as a policy solution for a 1,900-mile border that separates two countries and hundreds of millions of people.  4/5
As if the full faith and credit of the United States is the same thing as a small business‚Äô credit score.  America defaulting on its debt sends shockwaves through the global economy. A small business defaulting? Not so much. 3/5
It reminds me of the GOP congressman who once told me that the country should default on its debt instead of raising the limit because, when his small business was tight on cash, he would pay the most important bills first and the others when he could. 2/5
Trump‚Äôs statement, "Walls work. That's why rich, powerful, and successful people build them around their homes," misunderstands the difference in scale between a private person or business and the United States government.  1/5
