It is very difficult for me to watch mainstream news. The lies and propaganda are immense. The hatred towards Trump is palpable. I have been told that I am being unfair but I don't see it that way. I simply have zero tolerance for lies.
Sometimes it just angers me. I take it personally. How the millions of people which voted for Trump are completely disregarded, as if our votes we're not legit and that we don't matter. They are trying to silence us once again.
I could not sleep last night. I kept thinking about how horribly Trump has been treated not just by the media but the democrats as well. I really feel for him because at the end of the day he is a regular person just like the rest of us. He may not say it but I know it hurts him.
