Jeff Van Drew closing statements calls this a flashpoint election, wants to help people and bring people together. He calls on Democrats and Republicans truly working together for the United States of America. #NJ02
Another difference in tonight’s debate Jeff Van Drew supports #collectivebargaining and @Grossman4NJ opposes it. #NJ02
Powerful case by Jeff Van Drew to support STEM education, research &amp; technology in tonight’s debate. #NJ02
Again @Grossman4NJ doubles down on #ClimateChange denial. #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew commits to fight for #taxreform that benefits middle-class families &amp; small business owners, not corporate billionaires. #NJ02
Partisan puppet at the worst as @Grossman4NJ actually said “I cannot think of a issue that I disagree with the President.” Campaign is simple more hyper partisanship against problem solving by working together. #NJ02
Now @Grossman4NJ is against fixing local roads and bridges in South Jersey. As NJ receives worst return on our tax dollars from Washington, you cannot trust him to fight for South Jersey’s fair share. He even opposed critically needed Superstorm Sandy relief.  #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew takes @Grossman4NJ to task for being against Democrats and Republicans coming together as part of a problem solver caucus in Washington to break the partisan dysfunction. #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew stands up in debate to protect #Medicare for millions of Americans, and differs from @Grossman4NJ who admits that he wants to gut Medicare. #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew powerfully stands up for older Americans stating that they earned their #SocialSecurity and this handshake agreement between workers and our government must be protected. #NJ02

Now @Grossman4NJ attacks @Stockton_edu questioning if they have a bipartisan staff of professors. Really odd even for him. #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew encourages young people to run for office and get involved, and believes they can make a difference. #NJ02
Cannot trust @Grossman4NJ on #healthcare he radically blames Americans living with  #PreExistingCondition as having made "bad choices." #NJ02
Well it comes to #healthcare @Grossman4NJ wants to further pursue the radical agenda that would even gut #PreExistingConditions #NJ02
Now, @Grossman4NJ puts #SocialSecurity on the chopping block! #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew powerfully stands up for older Americans stating that they have earned their #SocialSecurity and this handshake agreement between constituents and our government must be protected. #NJ02
Despite @Grossman4NJ talking about growing up on the beach and dealing with terrible storm situations he once called Hurricane Sandy federal assistance a “disservice” to America. #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew reminds @Grossman4NJ of extreme racist and anti-diversity rhetoric and not surprising Seth just doubled down even more. #NJ02
Wow, @Grossman4NJ talks about #FakeNews rather than answer question on racism; likely because his extreme rhetoric is why National and State GOP leaders rejected his candidacy; https://t.co/C5Ast3OL9c #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew makes a strong case for tackling the opioid crisis. #NJ02
More rhetoric from @Grossman4NJ chiding that America was great 70-80 years ago, but not today. #NJ02
Now, @Grossman4NJ disputes value of renewable energy #ClimateEnergy #NJ02
Clear difference, Jeff Van Drew wants South Jersey's fair share and @Grossman4NJ wants to use gimmicks that would actually worsen the state's return on tax dollars from DC #NJ02
So, @Grossman4NJ when asked about #ClimateChange ducked the question to instead argued about undercounting New Jersey residents to shortchange our taxpayers. #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew strongly stands up for addressing #ClimateChange and wants a forward looking energy policy for our future. #NJ02
Jeff Van Drew calls out @Grossman4NJ for not telling the truth on gas tax and sanctuary cities. #ShamefulSeth #NJ02
New Jersey has the worst return on our tax dollars from Washington and @Grossman4NJ just pushed to undercount ourselves in the #Census that would actually raise our taxes #ShamefulSeth #NJ02

Many Americans have a #PreExistingCondition that include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, behavioral health disorders, heart and lung conditions, and joint disorders. Washington has a moral imperative to be humane and protect the American people. #NJ02 https://t.co/bfzzBM8pHO
It is absolutely reprehensible that @Grossman4NJ would blame Americans living with a #PreExistingCondition as having made "bad choices." As a dentist, I know firsthand how ignorant this comment is and he cannot be trusted to protect the health of South Jersey families. #NJ02 https://t.co/p4eGy6VORY

We must secure our borders, control who enters our great nation, but that doesn't require abandoning our values/humanity. #SeparatingFamilies and locking children in cages is atrocious and our moral compass as a nation requires immediate action. #NJ02 #Vote2018
The policy of #SeparatingFamilies at the border is unacceptable and must end today! It is shameful that politics has driven this disgusting approach. We live in America, the land of freedom and opportunity, and we have a moral obligation to do better. #NJ02 #Vote2018

In the state legislature, I have long led the fight to protect our shore-based economy by standing against offshore drilling and in Congress, Washington will hear loud and clear that this will not happen in South Jersey. #NJ02
New Jersey woefully is shortchanged on our return on tax dollars we send to Washington and now, dysfunctional politicians think they can blackmail our residents with punitive fines or put our shore in peril. #NJ02
It is outrageous that Congress would consider a scheme to financially punish New Jersey taxpayers as a threat against our efforts to block offshore drilling from our shore communities. This is reckless and irresponsible legislation, which violates our state’s rights. #NJ02
Tonight, I released a statement against a Congressional scheme to financially punish states that block offshore drilling. As the author of a law protecting our coast from offshore drilling, I'm outraged by this punitive move that would cost us hundreds of millions. #NJ02

As Congressman, I will fight to guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions continue to have the #healthcare they need. This legal scheme is an example of the dysfunction in Washington that is tone deaf to the challenges American families are facing.
This DOJ decision is wrong and misguided. The havoc this would cause for families would be catastrophic, as many families would be financially devastated being hammered with massive premiums and medical debt, which would even result in bankruptcy. #Healthcare
Anyone can have a pre-existing condition, and most Americans face this from high blood pressure/cholesterol, asthma, behavioral health disorders, heart &amp; lung conditions, and joint disorders. Washington has a moral imperative to protect the American people.  #ACA
I’m profoundly disappointed that the Department of Justice is failing their legal and moral obligation to defend our nation’s law and healthcare coverage for more than 130 million Americas with pre-existing conditions. This decision is wrong and misguided.
