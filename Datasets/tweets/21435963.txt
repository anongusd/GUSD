So this is how @Aetna keeps its hands clean while a third-party company denies coverage on Aetna’s behalf—even when that coverage is included in a customer’s health insurance plan.
The @Aetna rep I just spoke to, meanwhile, doesn’t even know what Optum is. She tried to convince me it was my physical therapy provider! After hours on the phone, I’ve gotten nowhere.
My plan allows for 30 visits a year. I’ve used 14. But @Optum says I don’t need any more visits, and it’s their policy not to speak to customers.
Now they’re fighting me on physical therapy. I just got out of my CAM boot a few weeks ago. I’m teaching my left foot how to walk again. My calf if is atrophied and fairly useless. And they’re basically saying I don’t need any more physical therapy.

@AllOnMedicare @hannahgais @evicorehc @Aetna It’s physical trauma followed by bureaucratic and financial trauma.
@hannahgais @evicorehc @Aetna The stories I’ve heard today are so much more dispiriting than my own case.
@libbycwatson Thanks Libby. I’m characteristically stubborn so I don’t plan to give up easily.
@Jessicaburke8 @evicorehc @Aetna I’m sorry. That’s terrible. I hope people realize my situation is one of the *least* horrific. That’s how broken the system is.
@BrandoStarkey @joeflood @kobebryant Yep I’ve seen the video. It’s a bizarre feeling—the dangling, useless heel.
@FletcherChristy ER won’t do MRI unless emergency.
@TeddyFresh13 My mistake was trying to play like I was still 25 and not preparing muscles/tendons accordingly. Cardio wasn’t the issue.
@TeddyFresh13 Walking is good. I’m in shape, bike every day. But week of intense stretching wasn’t enough. I rec light jogging and jump squats or similar.
@TeddyFresh13 Are you just getting back into it? If so, I have some advice obviously...
@laurenthehough I’m going to have nightmares. I’m sorry this happened to you.
@laurenthehough Damn, I’m sorry. Thanks for reaching out.
@laurenthehough Thanks for the advice. How long did you wait? Did you get surgery?
@dtlacomharsa EXACTLY
@laurenthehough Ugh really? DM me any advice?
@GeckoDr This is depressing.
@CliffClinton The replies are way tougher! I have it easy compared to just about everyone else who has had to wrestle with our health care system.
@noahmccormack @evicorehc @Aetna Thanks Noah. My plan is to pay out of pocket and fight like hell. I expect to win. Just not how the system should work, needless to say.
@alexanderchee @evicorehc @Aetna That’s some proper advice.
@alexanderchee @evicorehc @Aetna Thanks. Question is whether pay out of pocket now and fight later, so I can make surgery call sooner. But shouldn’t have to be this way.
@QuestyQ @evicorehc I will. Thing is, no one tells you how it all works! (Until you tweet about it.) You just get rejected, case closed. It’s brutal.
@1boring_ym @reneebeau @evicorehc Thank you.
@123sleepyweasel That’s shocking.
@HandlebarsDC @joeflood Latter.
@ChrisRywalt @evicorehc @Aetna The amount of recovery time that I'm wasting while waiting for possible surgery is astounding.
@estarianne I hope he will. I'll find out on Monday.
@estarianne Oh, I have screamed a few times already—on the phone, alone in my apartment...
@reneebeau @evicorehc Good advice. Thank you.
@blmboulder @joeflood Scary (expensive) thought, but I just might do that.
@courtklein @oldboy_74 @BlueShieldCA Speechless.
@courtklein @BlueShieldCA Ugh I’m sorry.
@courtklein @BlueShieldCA That’s so absolutely insane. Did you end up having to pay it all?
@joeflood Yeah I knew the moment I saw no one behind me...
@joeflood Mine’s snapped, two docs are sure. And yet I can’t even get an MRI...
@joeflood Full or partial?
@joeflood Have you ruptured yours?
@AetnaHelp Email sent.
@evicorehc @Aetna It brought me to tears, honestly. I can't even imagine what Americans with chronic or life-threatening problems put up with. It's inhumane.
@evicorehc @Aetna ...because of some esoteric reason from a third-party vendor, I may never be able to do these things I love with the same ability as before.
@evicorehc @Aetna I'm 40. I'm active. I ski, scuba dive, bike, etc. And I'm fortunate—I have health care! And yet, even still, I'm facing a situation where...
@evicorehc Otherwise they're cutting into your leg without knowing what they'll see. And yet, @Aetna and @evicorehc have decided I don't need one.
@evicorehc You cannot make a decision about whether to have surgery without getting an MRI—and you certainly can't do surgery without an MRI.
@evicorehc This morning, I learned that @evicorehc denied authorization for an MRI. Literally everyone who ruptures their Achilles tendon needs an MRI.
They outsource preauthorization to some company call @evicorehc, which ... add the letter L and you know where this story is going.
...Aetna, my insurer. They are apparently notorious for taking forever to preauthorize MRIs. They don't even make the decision themselves.
...until I got an MRI. Then he'd know whether to recommend surgery or nonoperative recovery. I schedule an MRI and paperwork is sent to...
Instead, my Achilles tendon had fully ruptured. An orthopedic doctor said it ripped apart close to the calf muscle, but couldn't be sure...
I was taking the ball across midfield when felt a whack on the back of my ankle—and heard a loud pop. I thought I'd been fouled.
This week I got a sense how the U.S. healthcare system can break people. This story begins on Monday evening, while I was playing soccer.
