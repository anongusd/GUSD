Uganda should be moving forward other than going backwards as far as leadership is concerned,WE MUST get a new president with new ideas,new system of governance and that is ME.our beautiful ladies and handsome  men have studied but no jobs,among other very many issues.
we MUST organise our country in a better direction ie;by electing as the president of the Republic of Uganda 2021-2026.
Dear Ugandans,it's my humble pleasure and a very good moment to announce that I will stand for presidency 2021-2026.There fore it's high time YKM started to wind up as the new president comes in that state house.
