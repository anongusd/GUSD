@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows You need intel to tell you that a leader of a nation leading his population in a chant death to America does not need nuclear weapons?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows I just sent you some info hope you take the time to read so you can be informed. We definitely don’t want ignorant voters. Thanks for the conversation have a lovely day.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Read the dates in this report. I’m sure you trust this source. https://t.co/ruDhmLmAuS
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Don’t worry I will cast a responsible vote. I take mine and your future serious.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows If the leader leads his population in a chant death to America I don’t need intel to tell me the obvious but maybe you do.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Stereotyping us as illiterate uneducated ill informed constituents is why election night 2020 you all will be have a hissy fit get your safe space prepared ahead of time.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows No matter what propaganda you read You can’t deny who initiated when it is well documented in the court.

@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Did Putin tell you personally that he does not care?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows If you was informed you would be aware of Iran’s attitude towards America since they publicly let it be know. I don’t need to analyze just listen to what they say. No need for sources when you can read their public statements.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Are you
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows And yet it is more than what Obama gave them.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows What do you think he did during those talks that put our nation at risk? You think he agreed to see Russia uranium a key ingredient for nuclear weapons? No Hillary already did that under the Obama administration.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows I believe you are the one brainwashed and uninformed. You talk about morals and yet your whole party will not sign legislation to provide medical treatment for children born alive from botched abortions. But you lament over family separation.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows I do not blame him for separating children from parents that broke our law. We separate American children everyday from there parents if they break the law and go to jail
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows The pictures you seen of children in cages was from 2014 did you call Obama immoral?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Oh are you suggesting we give nukes? What do you want Trump to do to prove he is not a Russian puppet? Go to war with them?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows There are many videos you can watch of him publicly speaking, I take him at his word that he wants death to America. https://t.co/w1o35wMC6s

@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows His policies are moral
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows My vote will be responsible. I will vote on policy and morals
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows XI stayed at Trump home in Florida played golf dinners talks.  It is not illegal to talk to Russians. If the Muller report says Trump did not collude with the Russians will Democrats be able to except it?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Because Iran said never, that’s why never was not a option? Do you believe Iran should be able to legally have nuclear weapon in 15 years?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Lol you will see. I personally do not consider her as a security risk I actually like her foreign policy. She is a isolationist.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows This is not talking points. The Trump administration has put policies in place that hurt Russia. But in my opinion Trump needs to focus on weakening China instead.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows You think he does not care about US providing arms to Ukraine? You think he wants a regime change in Venezuela?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows You know Russia has the economy of Texas? You don’t he cares that we are going to be the ones selling oil to Europe instead of him?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Yes Obama did a great job on sanctions for Iran and that is what brought them to the table to make an agreement. I think the negotiators he sent did a short term strategy for a long term problem.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows I understand what you are saying and I understand your concerns and they are real. I just feel like if we give them a legal pathway to nuclear how in the future can we say they can’t have it?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows We will hopefully be able to communicate with them directly in the future instead relying on China. China used North Korea as leverage over us that they would contain them and that’s why no one would stand up to China on trade and property theft etc
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Never has to be the option. We can’t let them have nuclear weapon. If Iran used a nuclear weapon on US and we retaliate do you think Middle East will morn for them or celebrate their accomplishments in their death. You got to understand there belief
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows So Iran eventually having a nuclear weapon is a proper deal? No we need to pull out so we could have the ability to sanction them and pressure them to never get one. Instead we agreed it would be legal later. How push back ever once you agree it’s legal?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows They will freak out more with her because unlike Trump she is very principled about her beliefs they know they will not be able to talk her into keeping troops all over the world like they have Trump
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Just watch what her own party will do to stop her.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Do you believe the long range missile technology that are capable of carrying nuclear weapons they are currently building are for Israel? No, they would never damage the Temple Mount and don’t need long range to hit Israel. It’s for US the big Satan.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Because they was going to be able to legally have nuclear in 10 years, do you dispute this?
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows I was saying we have gained Hispanic voters and black voters along with his supporters will put him over the top. Trump will win in 2020 I just hope the Democrats will be able to accept it.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows He speaks regularly
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Out of their leaders mouth.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows This is not the case for Iran. There leader is not secular he would not hesitate to use a nuclear weapon. He does not fear the unknown of death because there is a way he can be sure. We can’t let Iran have nuclear weapon.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Because Iran deal allowed them to have nuclear weapon legally in ten years. A secular leader wants power and fears the unknown of death so if they use weapon they know lost power via death through retaliation is eminent.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows He is finally confronting China over unfair Trade policy and intellectual theft currency manipulation and China drug our citizens with synthetic drugs. Other administration ignored this blatant attack on US. In hopes they would help us with North Korea but now we communicate
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Trump has a annual defense spending to $700 billion by eliminating the defense sequester, exporting energy to Eastern Europe, and arming Ukraine with lethal weapons such as antitank missiles. Backed out of Iran deal and now look at his Venezuela policy. You think Putin likes this
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows She is the only one Trump camp and Trump supporters worry about. Watch her speak watch some of her interviews.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Believe me trump base will vote for him. He now has the approval of 51% of the Hispanic vote and he is gaining traction in the black community because they feel democrat are putting illegals over them. Trump will win in 2020.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows If she wins the intelligence community will definitely freak out bigger than they did with Trump. If she even gains traction watch her own party try and take her down.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows How do you expect him to believe the very agency that blame the Russia for the outcome for the 2016 election when he worked hard travel everyday to many states and ran against a bad opponent. He won because we voted for him.
@Hobgobl42429834 @GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows It is not just that they get things wrong they push for policy that keep us all over the world because of them we are the Roman Empire. We push democracy, we arm different factions in peoples nation then when it hits the fan we go in and clean up and never leave

@Jamal_Wozzle @Hamberdlerer @StefanMolyneux I agree with only half of your statement. The personality is what gets you the woman.
@StefanMolyneux When I was single I was dating a lawyer for at&amp;t and a poor private in the military. I chose the private with no money because he had the qualities in a man that I was looking for. Men money is not what you need to find a wife.
@DaleM10752263 @PattyMurray I totally agree and she knows it! What kind of crazy person would let school courts handle sexual assault? If it is real sexual assault don’t you think they would need to be put in jail so not in danger society? She is dangerous for promoting this
@2xfo @SoMoteItBe4U Even after I cut the tree down and modify it and call it a table it is still a tree. It is in the DNA.
@2xfo @SoMoteItBe4U You are wrong it is already happening.
@2xfo @SoMoteItBe4U Fetus, infant, toddler, child, preteen, teen, adult, middle age and senior. All of these labels describes a person in a different stage of life. All stages you are a person.
@cheech20101 @PattyMurray This is a policy that Obama put in place. The law is if you sexually assault a person your sorry behind goes to jail because you are a danger to society.
@RonTheDon1111 @PattyMurray Ron don’t you agree that sexual assault is a crime and anyone doing this crime should be in jail. Why then are you promoting policy that just kicks them out of school? Don’t report sexual assault to the school report to the police!
@Barbara85134845 @PattyMurray It seems you and the senator are pushing policies that don’t take sexual assault serious. If someone is guilty of sexual assault they need to be in jail not kicked out of school. This is the a dumb and dangerous policy you are promoting.
@PattyMurray If you have been sexually assaulted report to the police department not to your school. Obviously this senator doesn’t respect the justice system or the serious nature of sexual assault.

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I didn’t look at it yet but I will and talk later
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I really believe that is he breaks the laws he will forsure be impeached
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I don’t think most people actually search for answers like you or I have about religion. I have searched many of the same things you did and had many of the same ?. They just listen for a hour a week and say forgive me and that’s it
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I don’t care what religion anyone is as long as they don’t force their beliefs on me and I’m free to practice mine
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Lol
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit The faith leader he listens to is one of them prosperity preachers she probably not quoting the Bible much but saying to sow the seeds
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I know I did and had many of the same questions you told me about last night as you did
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit No I wasn’t speaking religious I think he can believe what ever he likes. Every person goes on a independent journey about such beliefs
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit That was funny but it doesn’t bother me because his religion is his own not my concern
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit It’s no concern of mine about his religion he is a free man
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Delivered as in regulations negotiated trade deals got us out of that Paris climate agreement that would have been horrible

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit You should love Trump
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I told you some
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit He already cut taxes for business and he didn’t raise mine
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I don’t believe in taxing the wealthy and I don’t believe he has increased the tax on the wealthy
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit He shouldn’t have done that he should have had a flat tax rate for all
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes lower taxes on business = booming business. He needs to bring home our troops like he promised. Less regulation school choice pro life fair trade make nato pay their fair share not the worlds piggy bank
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit What law did he break
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit We should be able to hold all children that come alone and fly them back to their parents
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit No it is not horrible when Obama did it or when Trump did it. Most of the kids that was separated came alone and the court wrongly ruled that we had to release in short time had to find sponsors some family members and they just disappeared
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit The picture of children in cages is from 2014 Obama had no where to hold them because so many came at one time. Hispanic called Obama the reporter and chief Trump will get the Hispanic vote
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I do not worship Trump but I do like his policies
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit It is true Obama has a real crisis 70,000 children showed up with no adult in one year and a court said he couldn’t hold them over a certain amount of days. It was a mess but not his fault. The court should have never ruled like that
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit The reason they are lost is because they did not come with adults. Once here a sponsor picks them up often illegally here and never show up for hearings

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes Harris has better shot in primary but she will not beat Trump in the general
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Check out Tulsi Gabbard  she is running for President I think she is the only one who can give Trump a real run. But I think the democrats will take her out in the primaries because she is a true isolationist (war) and the deep state not gonna have it
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Check out

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I will read it
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit No I like his policies not what he is saying. Breaking from Paris climate agreement was great for me. Cutting government regulations standing up for life asking for legal immigration and much more
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Omg you don’t believe he is a Russian agent or conspiring with Russia?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit And I’m sure he will win in 2020 he will get huge Hispanic support and huge support from black males
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Well I like him
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I think he is a great president
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit It’s like we got punched everyday for 30 years and now we are punching back harder until they decide to play nice and no one has tariffs
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit What did he mess up
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit The GOP sucked long before Trump. Trump is the best thing ever for that party and they don’t deserve him
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit No they already had tariffs on us and we are now standing up for our self.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I think you might have a misunderstanding of who people that voted for Trump are.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Some geniuses thought it would be a good idea to transfer the wealth of our country to rebuild China so that China would one day keep all of Asia in check.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit There you go again with the Magats why? It is dehumanizing.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Who can the government of Venezuela tax now? The rich people are in the government because the people trusted them. I trust myself that I can decide as a free woman what the right thing to do with my money is
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Because China has them on us. If the remove there tariffs we will remove ours and have free trade.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit The government they trusted them and promised them Fairness and utopia gained power and never turned over to the people. It’s the story that keeps repeating itself
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Who can they tax now?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit No taxes should never be to discourage behavior
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Venezuela kept printing and printing and inflation rose and when business raised there prices to stay in business the government shamed them and seized control of there business and the people cheered but now  the money will not buy any thing
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit It’s not working don’t you here the cries of the people and the elected officials to take more from the wealthy? If you have 1$ and I have 20$ you elect someone to take 9 from me to give to you then that’s not capitalism
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Paris climate agreement we would pay carbon tax and us along with other wealthy nations would send the money to underdeveloped nations
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit No in the 70s they scared the crap out of the population
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit That will never work socialism and capitalism because somebody will always have more and the people will vote to take it away
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Environmental extremists called for everything from outlawing the internal combustion engine to communist style population controls.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit During the 1970s the media promoted global cooling alarmism with dire threats of a new ice age. Extreme weather events were hyped as signs of the coming apocalypse and man-made pollution was blamed as the cause.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Don’t stress out about it. It will be ok. I know people are really frighten by this. But don’t be
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit And you believe this when you see what they plan to do with the money? But you are a fan of socialism so you are probably ok with it
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit If it is born to soon that’s called a miscarriage. The person died naturally. Another person and there doctor didn’t make the decision to take its life
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I don’t worry about other peoples money. I grew up very poor and very happy. Most of the rich people you talk about are in the worst poverty there could be loneliness
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Well that’s the argument they give to kids in school that we don’t care but we do we are just not stupid follow the money it’s really about global socialism
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit You think the whole of the USA would be desert with a two degree temperature rise?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit They can’t breath until they are delivered
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I do believe the climate changes. But to say I need to pay carbon tax or send money to underdeveloped nations like the Paris climate agreement no that’s a scam

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I believe that If you are believing 617 million are your family that you need to take care of then you will miss the bigger picture in life of the need to care for mom dad grandma grandpa aunt uncle brother sister children. This is where you can make a big difference
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I think you are arguing that the government should take care of all of us via redistribution of wealth? Confirm or correct me on my thought and I will reply according
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I can’t speak for Republicans
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Or cancer?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit It is impossible for you to care for all the people of the world.

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I think you are truly curious or even horrified in why a person would have the beliefs that I do. Each of us have different life experiences and I will gladly respectfully speak to you. Shoot me a private message and I will give you my #.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Love has nothing to do with socialism.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit We are all equal in the eyes of God the poor man and the rich man are equally a man. If the rich man of his on free will gives all his money to the poor to become financially poor himself is freely able to do this.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit But instead of giving evil person like sexual predators life sentences we give life for drug offenders. That’s how messed up the government we intrust with our safety is.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit If the government could force us we would not have sexual assaults. In my personal opinion child predator should receive the most harsh life sentence because if government released them on the street studies show high likelihood of reoffending.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit It does not force people not to steal, people are free to steal but will be punished if caught. Man should be free to govern himself and only be punished if violating another’s rights or property.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I know that you believe socialism implemented correctly would makes us happy. One reason I don’t think this is that I believe it destroys the family.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes I have a argument against the church when he then says give unto God what is Gods. They say tides to church but i do not agree that’s what he is saying
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Fetus, infant, toddler, preteen, teenager, adult, middle age, elderly. These are all labels that describe different stages in a persons life. As far as financial help for the mother, fathers need to provide and spend time in there children’s life. Government can’t live like a dad
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Who determines a person has more than they need? Tyranny
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Oh no you can afford to care for your parents even the most poor around the world honor their parents
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Do you believe in taking care of your own elderly family members? They loved you taught you provided for you throughout your youth, does it seem right when they are now elderly to have government feed them? It’s sad.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I believe if Education if handled on a local level that all schools would improve because we have a better knowledge of the needs in our local districts thus spend funds strategically and hold accountable via local elections those who let our children down
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit It’s strange America was not in the top ten. We have more people wanting to migrate to our country than any other place in the world. America takes in 1 million immigrants a year putting to shame all these countries but most of them are smaller. What’s Canada’s excuse?
@murphy_nonna @DonaldJTrumpJr @KamalaHarris So why did the IRS need to apologize And make a settlement? Everyone but you knows the IRS targeted conservatives

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit You said you studied religion so you know Jesus never preached government programs. He never said give to Cesar so Cesar can give to the poor. Jesus did not teach socialism. The government should not be involved or force you give
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I think programs like this breaks down the family. If you take care of the elderly in your family you will honor them and learn so much and can provide a real love that government can’t provide. And if no family the church should provide or they are a disgrace

@alyseinwonder @PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED If someone reported sexually assault to you do you call the police? You can’t possibly think it ok just to be expelled? People who do these crimes need to be incarcerated. Think of public safety. What you are promoting is not safe
@alyseinwonder @PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED It’s not the schools job and I think you are promoting a dangerous policy. People committing sexually crimes need to be removed from the public. You need to be promoting victims to report to the police so the perp can’t freely assault people.
@Itty_Bitty94 Some people work hard at just being able to help themselves. You are free to pay for other peoples college but don’t force others to
@Itty_Bitty94 Many people have faced the situation you are describing. People handle them different some people may never be able to go to school some later in life when they have the time or can afford it
@SenGillibrand More black babies die annually via abortion than are born in NYC. That’s racism
@SheriffClarke @townhallcom It is to dangerous for us to do the same to them. For our male loved ones we cannot join the Democrats in throwing due process out the window.
@Itty_Bitty94 Most universities will offer scholarships for people that really high marks

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit But if someone is not willing to give then that’s stealing
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Where did he say that?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I’m not selfish I just try not to do things that are not in my self interest. I think it would be immoral for me as mother to do anything else
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes we need to change that law
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit No that’s not what’s happening. What’s happening is these countries are lawless and corrupt and the people have no protections or economic opportunity
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit A misdemeanor is a crime
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Do you think it to be ok for a bunch of Americans enter in Mexico with out permission do they not have the right to be a sovereign nation?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I’m pretty sure you know that when I say if they touch American soil they are staying it’s because we have about 20 million people here illegally so something physical needs to keep them from being able to do that
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit It is a crime
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I thought I was clear when I said I believe even a 1 year old that is here illegally should be deported
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit You see my picture do I look like I would be afraid of them
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit You will never stop criminals from coming by promoting criminal behavior. To come to this country illegally is illegal.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit That’s not coming from fear that is truth. What would be other for  me? Someone of a different color?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Lol I called my good friend that I worked with for ten years Claudia then one day I find out that not even her name
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit We got probably 20 million here and we have no idea there real name
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Trump didn’t invent the idea that we need physical barrier at our border. We already have 600 miles that previous administration put up
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit If they get on American soil they are staying.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit How does your smart technology physically keep them out of the country? Because if they enter you know they staying and if they stay more will come
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes I understand this.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Do you have stock in a drone company?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I’m not going to suggest arming the drones to bomb them.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Do you work for a tech company? I’m for what the border patrol say they need to secure the border. They asked for technology manpower and a physical barrier
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit At this point I’m ready to build a moat and fill it with alligators. I know that ancient technology will work
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Children and women are sexually assaulted some are sold into modern day slavery all are victims of extortion even men taking years paying off the coyotes
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Coyotes lie to these people and tell them to come often the women and children get to come free so they can present them to the border patrol keep BP busy processing while they smuggle there cargo of human and drugs in
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes human traffickers do go through the desert.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit https://t.co/QjSJCAyVFp  they say it was enough to kill 56 million people. Just 6 days ago
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit You maybe comfortable with the way things are. I am not. I know and understand many people like you have their heart in the right place. Maybe if you have female friends that have made this journey they will share their experience with you
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit True they do all you say and they cross sometimes where there is not a port of entry and 70,000 Americans died last year due to drug overdose
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit We have drones and censors already. You wanna know who the big winner is if we keep business as usual at the border. Drug cartels and human traffickers and American business that pay these people like they are a 1/4 person modern day slavery
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit What are you going to do to stop them? Are you going to arm the drones? Just wait and see the war that going to happen at the border with the cartels when they can no longer freely cross. You don’t understand what type of business this is
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I’m for drones I’m for censors I’m for a real physical barrier I’m for ending sanctuary cities I’m for separating all children from any adult until DNA tested to prove paternity then I’m for deporting all illegals and finally putting end to the big business of human trafficking
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I believe you that you are compassionate for people and I must seem really cold to you. I think you don’t understand a lot. And it’s good that you don’t. Trust me you don’t want the sleepless nights worrying
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit What would a smart wall be?
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit And you are probably a well meaning person but the promotion of children coming illegally is very dangerous. I know you probably don’t understand this most Americans don’t.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit I’m saying if you have legally came no matter what age then welcome. But if not then deportation
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit The best thing to do is to make sure no one else gets in here illegally. But yes I would deport every person that’s here illegally then maybe my family who is doing it the right way will not have to wait so long in line
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit You either have legal status or you dont
@ChipSalonna @Franklin_Graham @POTUS It was just a recommendation you are free to take it or leave it. I lose nothing either way
@ChipSalonna @Franklin_Graham @POTUS No I admit that as part of being a Christian it is a principle for every individual to be accountable for their personal relationship with God

@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit You should live in the country that you are a legal citizen of. People should follow the law. My family came legally.
@JeremyGlassford @johncardillo @gatewaypundit Yes if you are 1 day old and enter the country via your parents who has not been through the legal process then you are a illegal alien

@johncardillo @gatewaypundit What makes you a citizen then? I’m pretty sure you can only be a citizen if you legally migrated or if you are born here but the born here part might need tweaking because anchor babies are becoming a problem.

@ChipSalonna @Franklin_Graham @POTUS You can’t throw Gods commandments out the window as to render them meaningless but you can choose to not obey them.
@ChipSalonna @Franklin_Graham @POTUS You have the freedom to worship whatever gods you like. You have your own free will

@alyseinwonder @PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED Well we don’t need to be describing this as sexual assault. Because sexual assault is a crime and needs to be punished properly in the justice system if found guilty these perps need to be removed from society and schools can’t do that.

@OZZLOAIZAMORENO @JaySekulow @POTUS It is much safer and faster for them to be able to go to a US embassy to apply for asylum in their home country than to walk hundreds or a thousand miles in the hands of cartels. If they are approved the US could safely transport them

@JollyFoxtrotSix @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Big business is also involved in this human trafficking they send for migrants that will work their behinds off and pay them 1/4 of what they pay an American man. I call this America’s modern day slavery.
@JollyFoxtrotSix @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump They do this because if they get a group of women and children to turn themselves in the border patrol are busy processing them meanwhile traffickers are smuggling drugs and people who pay big money to enter why the border patrol is busy

@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS What do you mean by equitable estate tax? I thought you was saying earlier that people should benefit from what there ancestors worked hard for.

@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS So you agree with me there should not be an estate tax?
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS All Americans benefit, you agree blacks are Americans and they benefit. We can not punish the ones responsible now because they are dead. That’s a twisted justice system you believe in if innocent people pay for crimes they never committed.

@jahmin32 @chosenlyric @RepHolding No we should close the inefficient United States Postal Service for not even being capable or screening packages properly.
@Cynthia50938490 @SenThomTillis The Democrats always deflecting and excusing. Democrats will also own if a terrorist crosses at the southern border. You already own the rapes and assaults of children and women committed by the cartels.
@jahmin32 @chosenlyric @RepHolding No Mexico too. You know this as well. Be intellectually honest.
@misanthropemime @JohnFugelsang Scripture is how I learn about God. How did you learn about him? Did you forgo scripture and create a God in your mind that you are comfortable with?
@misanthropemime @JohnFugelsang Do you know the answer? I’m sure in your grandiose imagination you think you do.
@misanthropemime @JohnFugelsang I do not need to give a simple yes or no. I do not speak for God or claim that I understand all of his ways. He has spoken for himself through his son and through scripture you can find more information of what he approves of through the Old and New Testament
@misanthropemime @JohnFugelsang "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God (Ro. 13:1 KJV)."

@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS There is probably no reason for anyone for any reason so seek justice from you. You don’t seem to be an oppressor. But someone somehow convinced you an innocent man that you are guilty. You are only responsible for your actions
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Justice? I’m not guilty. I see forms Mao Zedong’s and many other communist leaders technique of struggle sessions at play. I don’t make false admission of guilt of white privilege. I only am responsible for my crimes and sins.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I’m starting to have a better understanding of why you are so willing to try and pay for and fix others problems I’m thinking it systems from white western guilt. I do not experience guilt of that nature. no shame at all in keeping my money

@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I have no problem with them coming legally
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Do you think the foreign aid reaches the people? How long and how much foreign aid have we already sent? Are the peoples lives improving or getting worse since receiving the monies? They need to have a revolution! They must decide to fight to take control of their country back.
@realannapaulina @RyanAFournier Hopefully we still believe that when a parent endangers the life of their child we separate them via foster care until we know the child will be safe
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I was not saying to give more foreign aid I was saying to make the US immigration policy faster and cheaper so people do not endanger themselves and their children migrating and with cartels
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS You can’t provide aid to corrupt governments.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS 10 years is the around the wait time for legally immigrating. We should be able to cut this down to a year then people would not hire smugglers to bring them in. Republicans won’t the cheap labor “modern slavery” Democrats won’t a voter base by dividing groups to conquer.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS This is how they come. They are extorted by human traffickers it is well known. Try and have conversation with people who have come here. We need to make immigration more easy so there is no need for this illegal activity. It really is a tragedy.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Don’t you agree we make a mess everywhere? We try change peoples cultures and promote our political systems on them. We need strong industry and a bigger population better education via private education to defend ourselves against China
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I never on Twitter tell anyone my sister-in-laws story when I make a argument about illegal immigration. I always try and appeal to the emotion of the opponents need to protect the immigrants via human trafficking because I know her son was just a American white male.

@RepHolding I don’t understand why we have a republican congress that is passing bills like this. It is not the principles the Republican Party stands for. Why do we even vote? It’s obvious some so-called republicans are really socialist infiltrators. Help me understand what’s going on?
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS We have Democrats and Republicans on human trafficking committees in the senate they both try and pass policies to combat this problem it is real not only for our hemisphere but world wide. Modern day slavery
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I thought it was because the governments was corrupt and they didn’t enforce laws that would protect there citizens and the people voted for socialist policies

@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Do you know anyone who has made that journey? Do you know how they are being extorted for years by traffickers? What about American employers paying half man wages...does it make it ok cuz you can’t call it outright slavery? It’s pretty disgusting.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I think you must have been reading some propaganda about republicans gutting Medicare and Medicaid. I hope they leave Medicare alone.

@HillaryClinton @DRJAMESCABOT This happens all the time. People die trying to cross the border children and women being raped. migrants being extorted, payed half person wages. And you people keep justifying this evil of human trafficking. 70,000 Americans died to drug overdose annually. Build the wall.
@Wagner5Kathy @SuwonROKs @HillaryClinton Why didn’t her father try for asylum? The truth is he was actually trying to enter illegally. He could have waited in Mexico until there name was called to be processed. Sick of you to make any excuses for the evil of human trafficking that’s been going on
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Human trafficking is a disgusting evil and it’s sad Americans think they are doing good when they make justifications for what is going on. And what about the 70,000 fellow Americans that died to drug overdose? Nothing should come across that border unless it’s legal
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS My husband is a immigrant his parents brought him here. He is not scarred for life. They came legally. More children will die if we don’t build a wall and close the loopholes and boys and girls are being raped by traffickers.

@Ian26146314 @BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @KHayhoe They need the carbon tax to help the cause if inequality.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump @KHayhoe I think the poor and middle class will respond the way I’m thinking if it effects their pocketbooks and they will straight hit the streets if when they find out that money is being distributed from their poor hand to another poor hand. Self interest is a strong urge

@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump Well hopefully someone will come up with a solution that does not effect our pocketbooks. Be cause if we can’t afford to drive to work and feed our families the rebellion will be hell on earth. Do you think for a second that it’s not?
@gatewaypundit @freedomcaucus They always call but Ryan never picks up
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump Like I told you earlier my husband drives 50 miles one way to work with his salary We feed our children. Seven dollar gas a gallon would be a struggle for most of your fellow Americans and we would revolt just like France did.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump Like I said before I can’t wait for the progressives to implement a carbon tax on the middle class and the poor. Finally we will be united in the come and goal of needing to feed our families via driving to work
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump No I believe everyone pays the same % rich and poor alike. Everyone needs skin in the game. I do not believe in legally stealing via tax codes. I would never vote someone in to office with a policy that we tax all Bill Both 30% while I only pay10%
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters do not care what anyone does about the climate as long as it does not affect our pocketbooks or our freedoms

@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump 100% agree with you about Saudi Arabia that we should not get oil from them. We shouldn’t rely on any nation for oil. We need to produce our needs. I am a isolationist when it comes to wars and conflicts. I only believe in trade with other nations that’s it.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump What has our alliance members done to help us with Russia? Didn’t Germany decide to get oil from Russia instead of US? Sometimes it’s hard to tell who side some are on.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump And the people telling you this have how many homes, planes vehicles? How much have they and their friends made from green energy? Classic crony capitalism! Like the preacher saying your lot is hell if you wear red shoes while he wears them.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump I can’t wait for the next liberal president, I’m exhausted from the divide that has taken place all my life between the American peoples. Carbon tax will be the ultimate unifier. In my opinion the revolt against excessive taxation is just what we need.

They would vote libertarian and that is isolationist. EU all alone
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump What is wrong with them having a military? They should insure they can defend themselves. If US goes to war with China /proxy North Korea don’t you think that Russia and Turkey would move in on the EU? They need to have a military that is capable to defend them self.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump We are only asking them to pay 2%, Look at all the government benefits most of those nations give to their citizens, maybe that got to make some domestic cuts. You might not be struggling but some of your fellow Americans are. The need to pay now.
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump One of the biggest reasons Trump got people to vote for him was when he told us he wasn’t going to let people take advantage of the American tax payer. Is some of the foreign aid we pay really nations extorting America?
@BCISLEMAN @realDonaldTrump They should have been embarrassed how many years did they tell Obama that it would take them to pay 2%? How much time off of work do these people take compared to Americans.

@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Maybe that article is written to make the reader believe that the illegal immigrants are treated good and the lazy Americans won’t work anyway to justify and hide the the atrocities that surround human trafficking and the reader can feel virtuous for supporting such
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Why need illegal? To exploit there labor to in rich human smugglers that terrorize them and there families in there home country for years to come. 30% of girls and 20% of boys to be sexually assaulted. It’s a nasty human trafficking ring that deserves no justification.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Is it your point that illegal immigration is necessary? There are plenty of hard working people who are applying legally to come here. We do not need to in courage illegal migration
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 I can honestly say the majority of Americans I know are hardworking and do not shy away from manual labor. Manual labor is not just physically healthy but also mentally and respected where I come from
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 That’s odd my girls was in tobacco fields this past summer. The American youth does not want to make money? I know I did that’s why I was in fields every summer. What about the senior, don’t they need extra money? My dad was in the field after retirement until 73.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 If we ever put carbon tax on the Americans and they feel pain in there wallets all middle class and poor Democrats and Republicans alike will unite in revolution and then vote for libertarian/isolationist. In my opinion. The ultimate unifier.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 The problem is the money! Even the liberal French was in love with the romantic idea of saving the planet but when it meant hurting their pocketbooks they full on rioted until they got their president to back down on the increase carbon tax.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 I’m sorry there is no misconception. China pledged to keep increasing its greenhouse gas emissions through 2030 as it continues to grow its economy, and then begin to decrease them. It’s a joke.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 We should prosecute and if found guilty get a lengthy prison sentence for frauding the taxpayer. We are tiered of people wasting our money
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Yes we do and establishment Republicans are the worst for this. They should be ashamed. I wonder how many people needing better lives are waiting 10 years to come legally? They don’t want this, a legal person then they can’t pay 1/2 man wages.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 If you peel back the layers of illegal immigration “human trafficking” i believe you would join us in building the wall and reforming policy that encourage it. Establishment republicans are all for cheap labor “pay half a man” .
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 I am for legal immigration and I believe with the growth of China we need a lot more immigration but never illegal. I don’t like people excusing it. It is a very dangerous thing for the immigrants to come illegally.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 The part about cheap labor I have a moral problem with. Slavery at its heart is about theft. You steal a persons labor therefore stealing their livelihood. It is not ok for us to justify paying a person half or less what you or I would make
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 @realDonaldTrump Was the tax payer on the hook for his bankruptcy or was it the bank he got the loan from?
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 On war he promised to bring our troops home from the nations they are stationed at or at least make the nation states pay us for protection. We are tired of spending the money. Why are there? Are we the Roman Empire? He has not delivered on this. Sadly
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 It’s not a typo the list was his economic policies on the issues he promised he would get us out of the Paris climate accord
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 It is an outrage that my husbands family did everything right and came legally and has family members going through a  lengthy 8 year process for them to break in line as if they are more entitled.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 I do not agree with her policy. She is talking about giving amnesty to people she calls immigrants. If they need amnesty or a pathway to citizenship then they are here illegally. They broke the law and need to be deported.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 I can give you a list of the renewable energy companies that the federal government subsidized with our money that went bankrupt. In my opinion the people in the climate change industry are corrupt be cause they and their friends are getting rich.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 This plan looks bad to me because it has already been implemented by Obama and failed.He blew over $150 billion of taxpayer money to increase renewable energy in the US by slightly over 1% of total energy consumption and didn’t even meet the goal
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 He is not addressing climate that I know of. He said he wants a clean environment air and water. We voted for him because of fiscal policy, immigration, climate, war, aid to other countries and trade it’s all about financially being able to compete and keeping our money
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 In my opinion if a political party was ever to Implement a carbon tax, that party would unite citizens that have been divided and it would be a long time before that political party ever had any meaningful policy setting power again. Full citizen revolt just like France
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Yes I am very concerned about the tariffs. Trump voters will vote their pocketbooks!!! We are willing to go into a trade battle but if his tactics don’t work he will not be re-elected. We are nervous but hopeful especially after renegotiating NAFTA.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 So you was not voting for policy makers that support carbon tax?  Do you think there is a better way to address this issue than carbon tax? I think when people listen to the concerns of each other we can come up with new ideas.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Trump says his end goal is for all governments to remove tariffs. The safest way we can fight back is through tariffs against intellectual property theft currency manipulation, closed markets. We will see if he is successful. Even Obama recognized China as a problem in this area
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 I do not support tariffs. I believe in free trade and I think because Americans in general support free trade we have been taken advantage of by other nations who do tariff our products or shut us out of their markets.

@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 My turn, why do Trump supporter get called racist for supporting a border wall, closing loopholes in immigration policy? Do you support open border? Why?
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Looks like his policy is not to collude with foreign nations in taking Americans money via carbon tax and redistribute it around the world.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 When Trump supporter hear this we are thinking how much more will goods like food cost because of increased fuel prices to transport them. We think how does people who say they care for the poor and middle class not think about how this would harm them.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 When Trump supporters hear statements like raise the price of gas so people don’t drive as much we run to vote for him. We are not joy riding. We are going to work, our kids schools, visiting parents, grocery shopping. Maybe we take 1 vacation a year.

@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 The French are now paying $7 a gallon of gas half of that goes to a carbon tax. I would like to know how is that money saving the planet? Is it to purchase a technology that help to remove carbon from the air?
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 You can’t convince me that people are that worried about the climate and make agreements that don’t address the pollution that come from India and China. Lots are skeptics when they see Al Gore make the kinda of money he has off of what he calls a catastrophe!
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 I believe the climate changes. I was extremely happy that Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. I feel like it would have hurt us economically. And for what? Look at India and China and what they have to do in the agreement.

@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Yes when he was running for President
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Before Trump I would consider myself a conservative libertarian. We can talk about a hot topic like immigration if you like. I am all for building the wall. I am totally against illegal immigration.
@studiostoicheff @Dangchick1 Their are so many reasons why I support Trump. We can go through the list and debate each of them so we both can have a better understanding of how a person arrives at the political ideology that sometimes spills over to moral ideology

@goingglocal @doctorschmitty National defense and Trade is really the only decision making policy that the president should involve himself in. The trade deal he made with Canada and Mexico economists seem to think was a good deal.

@doctorschmitty @goingglocal He extended trade negotiations with China 90 days to see if he can negotiate a better deal. I hope he addresses there currency manipulation, intellectual property theft and gets them to open their markets

@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 You can’t say a person is free if they can’t do something so personal as to follow their religion anywhere anytime all the time. This is the very reason why wars are fought over religion.
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 If a baker is a Christian does he have to provide services for a same sex marriage?
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 What do you think will happen if same sex couples ask Services of a Muslim for there weddings? And start law suits against them when they refuse For religious reasons?
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 Not to impose the Catholic Church as state church or Baptist or Methodist
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 No of
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 Christians are taught through the word of God scripture, that marriage is a covenant the creator of the covenant is God. God created the institution of marriage between man and woman. So to say that it is something else makes covenants of God meaningless.
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 People can do what they want. But does a Christian have to agree with society that a marriage can be legitimate between a same sex couple?
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 So your answer is man and woman will not be regulated out of the right to own guns?
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 I completely agree the Muslim woman should wear what ever she likes. What is an example of Christians imposing there dogma
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 It’s a lot of reasons why people with different faiths would find it impossible to have freedom of religion. Like the Christian and Muslim bakers
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 At the very least the Muslim faithful would find it very hard to integrate into A society that is sexually flamboyant. My Christian grandmother found this hard also to have her children around women she perceived as half naked and more

@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 I understand your thinking about religion and always fighting but don’t think religion is something that any government in history has been able to tackle unless they have the willingness for Genocide.
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 People will always find reason to be offended
@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 I just don’t see how Muslims could practice their religion privately, they are commanded to spread the laws of their God and have the world conform, Judaism and Christianity likewise would be hard to practice their faith and not offend. If 3rd temple is built “sacrifices” peta
@DbtheeBustocles @Plindsey88 @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 Some religious practices of people may offend others, like Muslim women covered, when I asked a Muslim woman about this she said it was to show modesty to God, something people should respect but a lot are offended. Like can’t marry same sex couple, people get upset
@DbtheeBustocles @Plindsey88 @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 Muslims can’t practice their religion then because the God they serve commands them to follow his laws and to spread and in force them world wide. Christian likewise are commanded to spread the Gospel.

@Plindsey88 @Dougwil08943651 @DbtheeBustocles @charliekirk11 That’s the point, Christians are suppose to give out of love. Liberals give out of compulsory taxation. Don’t you agree love is better for society? Be free to choose to give or not to give. It’s freedom. You can’t say you love me and force me to give.

@Plindsey88 @DbtheeBustocles @Dougwil08943651 @charliekirk11 You are advocating that we receive a service by one source. What’s makes you believe that the quality will be high and cost low, do you believe the government to be kind, morally upright, never greedy, never power hungry?

But the government has no money to provide these services to us freely, we will pay for them. We will  not keep the fruits of our labor, theft through taxation.

@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Ok terry nice talking to you. Please reconsider government healthcare. It’s noble but the government is run by human beings and there is a sad nature of wanting power and greed. Don’t put to much trust in government.
@TimnGibsons @solutions30 @seanhannity Only women in the feminist movement know they are not a jackass? Wow you are really on your game tonight, schooling me.
@TimnGibsons @solutions30 @seanhannity Oh Tim, your morality! How ever did you become the poster man for proper etiquette! You just keep impressing me.
@solutions30 @TimnGibsons @seanhannity Bananas the dems have some flyers for you to pass out and some doors for you to knock on.
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen If you was quoting the Bible then family and church take care of the poor in the community, out of love, the government will never love you. This is the breakdown of society that we look to the government instead of voluntary out of love give
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen It is a fact
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen But don’t try and convince yourself you are something you can never be. It not good for a person they never can love and except themselves
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Like I said I don’t care what they do as long it does not affect me! I have my opinion that they should just love themselves like they are. If they like to dress or look like female, fine love yourself and be ok with it
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Families and churches are supposed to be the one aiding there members, you keep quoting scripture you should know this is there job not the government.
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen If the rich mans money is his god
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Well that’s stealing. Legalizing stealing via taxation is not a moral stance to be proud of
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Logic did not tell you this. Who did? Why do you think this?
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen That’s not cherrypicked, as a mother that’s scary and why in the Europe since state run healthcare are the elderly opting for euthanasia? Where are the children with Down syndrome?
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen We have Medicaid for the poor in this country. People have already died in this country when the federal government was in charge of there healthcare, the veterans. Wake up
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Who told you this?
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen How are you being generous? Are you talking about freely giving from the heart? Or forcibly having the rich pay for the poor via electing people to tax the rich? Which one do you think God likes? He requires the first fruit from the rich and poor
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Do you live in America? I promise you that you have never seen poverty.
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen No I don’t want the government in the healthcare business. Look in Europe when a child is deathly sick and the parent want to keep trying to save them, the government takes the parents rights even when other countries offer help they refuse the parent
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Girls play softball boys play baseball. Boys and girls are different. You know this, I hope.
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Look I can only talk to you if you can understand facts. I don’t care what people wear, who they sleep with, who they want to be, but my daughter is not allowed to get undressed in front of boys even if he believes himself to be a girl
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen She is a small framed Asian girl, you know that it is a lot harder for her to gain muscle than it is for boys.
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Do you think he should play on my daughters softball team?
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Well we don’t even need a military anymore, hey Russians come on in, game our system, out vote us until you implement Russian goals of taking over the US with out firing a shot!
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen You don’t have the moral authority to tell me my stances are immoral. You can try and shame me all the day long, I don’t even believe in programs like meals on wheels for the elderly, shame on those who don’t feed there own parents. I’m not ashamed
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen But if he is not allowed on the girls softball team then people like you will say violate civil rights? You don’t care about women rights. But that’s ok I expect you to vote in you own best interest
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen How is it immoral to vote in my interest? Example: my daughter plays softball what if a boy who identify himself as girl plays on her team “more muscular because a boy” gets a scholarship because he’s knocking it out of the park over my daughter? Is this my best interest?
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen He was talking about women who come here have a baby, baby get citizenship, mother and baby go back to there countries. When child gets of age he/she comes back and starts chain migration. The Chinese and Russians are doing this now. Big industry that needs to be stopped
@ThinkforOnce @KatrinaPierson @gruvtex @Acosta @CNN You can call me racist all the day long it doesn’t bother me that the left are slanderous liars.
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen I agree with trump in this issue. If it was Russians gaining citizenships by the ten of thousands every year you would be screaming “impeachment he is colluding with a foreign government” the left would faint
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen And I know exactly what my health insurance premium and deductible was before Obama care. It’s not in my best interest to support a European style state run health system. Why should I when the state can’t even run the postal services right.
@Revonine @LogicTruthJstce @McAllisterDen Like I said I vote in my own interest, I don’t Vote for the poor, rich,lgbtq, immigrants. I am not an emotional voter or a person that can be guilted or shamed into voting for other peoples or groups values.
@TimnGibsons @seanhannity What does this have to do with morals?
@TimnGibsons @solutions30 @seanhannity I am a human not a jackass. Tim, please stop calling females names while at the same time professing your morally superiority over the treatment of women. It’s very unbecoming.

@evan_carp @FDRLST Slavery is something far worse than feeling like you’re race is superior. It is theft of labor rooted in greed. When you steal a persons labor you steal there very life.

@evan_carp @FDRLST The first slave owner in the colonies was Anthony Johnson, he was a black man. Guess your teacher left that out her lessons. William (April) Ellison, was a slave owner and Breeder. There are many more you can read about.
@evan_carp @FDRLST Just a question? Do you think it’s ok to have illegal immigrants working in America?
@evan_carp @FDRLST When you say that it comes across as somehow whites are capable of moral atrocities that other races are not capable of. Why? It’s not true. Don’t you see how this puts divide between races? School indoctrination.
@evan_carp @FDRLST Slavery is really not about a feeling of a superior race. They just tell themselves that to justify there actions that they are better smarter. Slaver is about THEFT you steal a persons labor there freedom there life.
@evan_carp @FDRLST Making one race a victim and the other a perpetrator placing them against each other. When in reality they have in history been in the same place. Why? Be cause a house divided can’t stand.
@evan_carp @FDRLST I am talking about the fact that white males are shamed for a practice that all color people has been perpetrators of. But schools never mention this. they just portray the white man as the guilty one.
@evan_carp @FDRLST The whole point of this was that in school children are learning that the white male should be ashamed for this. In reality every color has been a slave and every color has been a slave owner. Shame on all peoples.
@evan_carp @FDRLST You said not all nations practice slavery. Can you list the ones that didn’t for me please? Even the Indians would steal each other and make slaves. Can you tell me what year you graduated? I’m just asking not trying to be a smarty.
@evan_carp @FDRLST Yes that’s exactly what I’m saying some of the black slave owners had white men as there property. My source? History. This is what I am talking about with education.

@Ap3xW @RepHolding I can tell you are passionate about the climate, healthcare and immigration. Me too. It has been nice to debate you on these issues. Honest intellectual debate is a rare now. Who knows we maybe able to see each others point of view
@Ap3xW @RepHolding We could stop all aid to foreign countries and buy solar panels for homes of low income citizens. That would be solutions to debate at town hall
@Ap3xW @RepHolding Why are so many of the elderly starting to practice euthanasia since government healthcare? Why are children with special needs being aborted? They don’t want to pay for there care. These people are considered burdens of the state.
@Ap3xW @RepHolding I probably believe science more than you. France, Germany get back with me on the wait times, or taking parental rights from sick children and pulling life support when parents are seeking care outside of the country.
@Ap3xW @RepHolding No more can we allow peoples in who use human traffickers to enter. They can legally apply for asylum or work visa. We need to protect these children. Stop paying people 1/2 wages, it’s modern day slavery
@Ap3xW @RepHolding 30% of the girls and 20% of the boys was sexually assaulted on the journey here. Cartel and human smugglers abuse and financially extort these people. U.S. corporations pay them half pay like they are half person. It must stop
@Ap3xW @RepHolding I also support the practice. So did Obama that’s why you seen pictures of children in the cages under the Obama administration.
@Ap3xW @RepHolding The IRS has audit him for years it’s there job to make sure he is paying his taxes properly. Not George Holding job. No where is it law that he hands over his tax return.
