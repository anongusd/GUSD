In these noisy days, it’s often hard to judge monumental moments in this daily series of twists and turns, but if you would have said two years ago that Michael Cohen would have forsaken Donald J. Trump, both men would have denied it. It was almost biblical. https://t.co/TStd2jUvB4
“A fool,” — that’s how Cohen answers when asked by Rep. Comer on what he would call himself since he calls President Trump a cheat.
“As of yesterday, I am no longer a lawyer. I lost my law license,” @MichaelCohen212 tells @RepCummings at the opening of question and answer session.
President Trump, who is of the Vietnam era but did not serve, seems less taken with the haunting wartime symbols of Hanoi than an old dispute with a Democratic senator, who he has accused of manufacturing his war credentials—⁦@Kevinliptakcnn⁩ reports https://t.co/7YHg5CuDDs
8 important words from @JoeBiden today: “I am certain about where the family is.” Translation: his family’s on board if he decides to run. So will he? @ArletteSaenz &amp; I break it down next on @AC360
The House votes 245-182 to pass a resolution to terminate President Trump’s National Emergency Declaration, with 13 Republicans joining all Democrats to pass the measure. Senate vote will be fascinating.
Biden still wants to be president, but there is still a BUT: "We are in the final stages of that decision, but it would be the greatest honor of my life to be president ... but also it's something that I have to make sure I can run a first rate effort that I could do this." https://t.co/9nzxEtA77I
"I'm not there yet," @JoeBiden says of 2020 run. "I have not made a final decision yet, but don't be surprised."
There's hardly a clamoring for @BilldeBlasio to jump into the 2020 race, but the Mayor navigated snow, ice, a roadside Super 8 motel and a ground stop at ORD on his weekend Iowa visit. He said Democrats need a progressive who is “believable” as a leader. https://t.co/40Wk32P3oA.

OMINOUS WORDS FROM COHEN? "I will continue to cooperate with (the) government," Cohen said in court today, our @eorden reports.
Judge has ordered Cohen to report to prison on March 6 for his three-year prison term. So he will be free until then, our @eorden reports from federal court in NY.
Michael Cohen responds to Trump: "Recently the president tweeted a statement calling me weak and it was correct but for a much different reason than he was implying. It was because time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds," our @eorden reports.

“Let future generations understand the burden and the blessings of freedom. Let them say we stood where duty required us to stand.” Those words are etched into stone at the George H.W. Bush Library in College Station, where he’s now at rest. It’s a great library, worth a visit.
.@DevalPatrick explains why he isn’t running in 2020: “knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn’t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask.”

The hearse, with a presidential seal, is passing the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue now, a poignant moment. The thoroughfare was open to traffic during his presidency, but closed shortly after in 1994 in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing.
George W. Bush has delivered eulogies before, of course, including Reagan's. I'm thinking back to that day in 2004, when he said: "Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now. But we preferred it when he belonged to us." But to deliver one for his father will be powerful and gutting.
Making it clear the Bushes wanted Trump to attend funeral is less of an olive branch than a sign of a penchant for protocol and respect for the office--also avoids a messy public feud.

One of the things President Trump didn't mention today were the Republicans who lost despite accepting his support -- like Kate Arrington in SC-1. Joe Cunningham becomes the first Democrat to hold the seat in nearly four decades. https://t.co/tJHv5CYQRu via @postandcourier
Things that go off the Pinocchio scale:  "I'd be very good in a low tone," @realDonaldTrump says. "I would love to have a very even, modest, boring tone."
Trump called out Republicans who didn't campaign with him who lost, but he failed to mention: Of the 33 candidates he endorsed via tweets from Saturday through Tuesday, 16 lost and 12 won. He did not read a roll call of those losers, instead saying instead "Mia gave me no love."
"Mia Love gave me no love and she lost," @realDonaldTrump says at one point as he ticks through the names of GOP members who lost last night, suggesting they did "very poorly" perhaps because they distanced themselves from him. Amazing.
"The governor's races were incredible," @realDonaldTrump says ... highlighting GOP wins in FL, IA, OH, GA. He said you "can't get bigger than that." Except, of course, PA, MI and WI - which were Trump states in 2016 and Democratic states last night.
"It was a big day yesterday, an incredible day," @realDonaldTrump says, opening his post-election news conference in East Room.
"She has earned it," @Clyburn tells @KateBolduan. "Nancy Pelosi has been a great speaker. As long as she's in pursuit of the gavel, I'll be in support of her."
Former President Obama, who was 0-2 on his midterm elections and did not help pull most Dems across the finish line Tuesday says: "Our work goes on. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it..."

Loud chants of "Four More Years" at the Trump rally tonight in Missouri. I think they mean six?
And again tonight, press secretary Sarah Sanders and senior adviser Kellyanne Conway are called onto stage of a Trump campaign rally after Ivanka also briefly spoke -- part of the White House effort to showcase women.
The Trump Factor: "If we don’t do so well tomorrow, they will put me on the ticket. If we do great tomorrow, they will say he has nothing to do with it," Trump tells Missouri crowd. 		I think everyone can stipulate that this election is all about Trump -- from all sides.

What President Trump calls "a crazy lunatic policy that we can end," is actually known as 14th Amendment to the Constitution. No mention of that tonight here in Missouri. Applause was more tepid than I thought for birthright citizenship lines. Interesting.
A Trump supporter I was talking to at the Missouri rally tonight asked me an interesting question: "Does the president ever talk about the deficit?" I said, no. I can't think of the last time I've heard any mention of the deficit -- by the president or any GOP officials. Amazing.
President Trump telling Missourians tonight that he'll be back on election eve. “You people in Missouri are going to say, I can’t believe it, the president is here again!"
A lot of Steven Miller lines in tonight's rally, where President Trump (so far) is following his Teleprompter closely: "This election is a choice between Republican results and radical resistance. It’s a choice between grace and gridlock. It’s a choice between jobs and mobs."
"They’re attacking me really because I’m fighting for you – and that’s ok. We really have to bypass the media because it’s so one-sided and unfair," says @realDonaldTrump, who can't seem to stop giving interviews. Hmm.
"We’re being so nice. Let’s stay being nice, right? We are tough as hell, but we’re going to stay nice," @realDonaldTrump says tonight at Missouri rally, which is very much on message -- 10 minutes in. Stay tuned.
"She's been saying such nice things about me, but she'll never vote with me. She never has. She didn't even vote for Justice Kavanaugh -- think of that," @realDonaldTrump says in the opening moments of rally, wasting no time going after @clairecmc
The fine folks of Missouri seem to be on a first name basis with President Donald J. Trump. Chants of "Donald, Donald Donald!" broke out a bit ago. Not sure I've heard that before at the rallies we've covered.
At Trump rally in Missouri tonight, lots of Mizzou GOP officials are praising Trump, including: .@RoyBlunt: "Let's make America Great Again!"
Our colleague @Geneva_Sands reported these plans earlier this week:  https://t.co/TS3RZi3iW5 https://t.co/1fhHzgsm1D
The White House is making plans for President Trump to deliver an immigration speech today from the Roosevelt Room around 4:15 pm before leaving for rally in Missouri. Today’s theme is expected to be asylum — part of pre-election immigration announcements, officials tell @CNN.
I asked Trump if he's worried what immigration rhetoric will do to in suburbs: "I don't view suburban districts or any other districts. I view the country. We're doing very well with the women vote -- they want security, they want safety." (GOP leaders fear suburban blue wave.)
On the White House south lawn, President Trump said he has not received a subpoena from special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation.
President Trump defends attack on @SpeakerRyan and doubles down on ending birthright citizenship. He says he isn’t fear mongering. He would do in Congress or by EO. Asked if he is preparing to blame Ryan if GOP loses house, he says: “I’m not going to blame anybody.” https://t.co/1XsB7wedpZ

“Well you obviously cannot do that. You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order," @SpeakerRyan tells @WVLK radio, but adds he does favor the plan to end Birthright citizenship.
President Trump is trying to change the subject to immigration: Yesterday, sending 5,000 troops to border. Today, calling to end Birthright citizenship, which a president can't do alone. It's not a real proposal, but simply talking about it 7 days before an election rallies base.
Trump will do 11 rallies in the final week -- focusing primarily on Red State Senate races: Florida, Missouri, West Virginia, Indiana, Montana, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri.

"These terrorist actions must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the la," President Trump says, echoing his comments from this morning in the White House. "Political violence must never ever be allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it."
"I can't wait to be back here for the 2020 Republican National Convention," President Trump says in his opening line in Charlotte tonight. "Let's do that North Carolina thing. Let's do that Charlotte thing."
Here at the Bojangles Coliseum in Charlotte, the crowd is already warming up the “CNN Sucks” chant - two hours before tonight’s rally.

We are at the point of a Trump rally when hundreds of seats are empty throughout the arena. To be sure, it's still a far bigger crowd than most politicians could draw, but after waiting for most of the day, this speech is too long for even some of Trump's biggest fans.
As he talks about powerful Hurricane Harvey that ravaged Houston area last year, President Trump says it was unrelenting, going in and out. The crowd became utterly silent as he said: "I’m paying for that," talking about all the federal aid for Texas.
President Trump: 50,000 people we love outside.	Campaign manager Brad Pascale: 19000+ inside. 25000+ outside.	Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo tweets: About 3,000 folks outside enjoying rally.		So the bottom line: It was a big rally. But 100,000? Not by anyone's math.
"Elizabeth Warren was exposed as a total fraud. I can no longer call her Pocahontas because she has no Indian blood," Trump said to loud applause.
President Trump boils his closing argument down to this: "This will be the election of the caravan, Kavanaugh, law and order, tax cuts and common sense."
For posterity, the full quote: "A globalist is a person who wants the globe to do well but doesn't care about the country so much."		"I'm a nationalist. Nationalist. Use that word." https://t.co/zZqQcdQ7id
"You know what I am? I'm a nationalist," Trump said - after "globalists" drew loud boos at rally.
Everything is bigger in Texas -- louder, too, particularly the "CNN sucks" chant at the rally just now. It's been months since I've heard it echo like that. "Don't worry, I don't like them either," Trump says, despite being one of the most loyal viewers!
President Trump's recent talk about a new 10% middle class tax cut is reflective of how voters don't remember or feel the tax reform GOP passed last year. One reason? He barely gives more than a nod to it at rallies, so seeing polling data persuaded him to propose a new one.
The only Ted Cruz campaign signs here are ones his supporters smuggled in. This is a Trump 2020 rally and his team has pre-printed signs at every rally. A few spotted so far: Get out and Vote, Jobs Not Mobs, Women for Trump. Cruz is the opening act. This is a Trump rally.
"God Bless Texas and God Bless President Donald Trump," @tedcruz said as he opens the rally tonight in Houston. Rivals-turned-friends is an incorrect storyline. Trump needs Cruz's vote in the Senate. And Cruz needs Trump voters. That's the long and short of it.
--&gt; Interesting. https://t.co/kIR3va6FaH
Trump is campaigning almost exclusively in red states. But he's the central figure everywhere. He appears in nearly 20% of all political ads this year, an analysis shows, with at least $55 million spent on pro-Trump ads and $61 million on anti-Trump spots.
A month ago, the President seemed all but resigned that Republicans would lose the House, two people who speak to him often tell me. But his outlook has brightened in recent days, increasingly insisting he can awaken his coalition to stop -- or slow -- a Democratic wave. https://t.co/IK5N9pUrfK

"This is a very sick world. I see things as president you don't want to know about," @realDonaldTrump tells rally tonight. "Seal Team -- they're great!"
President Trump is going deep into House races now, talking up embattled GOP incumbent Rod Blum, IA-1. He mentions Blum's opponent: “Abby Finkenauer – who the hell is that?" Very few people in this Nebraska-heavy crowd know either, since she's running in eastern Iowa.
PAGING SCOTT FROST... "Where's Tom Osborne?" @realDonaldTrump just asked at a rally tonight. "All I know is for years, all he knew how to do was win - win! It's called no talk, all action. You better get going Nebraska!"
"They said sir you're speaking in Iowa, but there may be a few people coming in from Nebraska," Trump said, seemingly surprised by all the Nebraskans in the crowd in Council Bluffs, just across the river from Omaha.

The Senate has formally confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, 50-48, further cementing President Trump’s conservative imprint on the high court. If the White House had agreed to reopen FBI background check three weeks ago, would this have been less divisive and ugly?

Ten days ago, President Trump told me this in the Oval Office. "I don't think the FBI really should be involved because they don't wanna be involved. If they wanted to be than I would certainly do that, but as you know they say this is not really their thing."
New from Kavanaugh: “I’ve been interviewed by FBI, I’ve done a number of background calls directly with the Senate..I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me. I’ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate
A White House official tells me President Trump will authorize a supplemental FBI background investigation into Brett Kavanaugh. It was 10 days ago when Trump first told us in the Oval Office that the FBI doesn’t do these types of probes. Now, he will order them to do just that.
And now it’s official... A smart Republican asked me: “If this had been done 10 days ago, would Kavanaugh have been confirmed by now?” https://t.co/pvZOOBczoT
Barbara Van Gelder, attorney for Mark Judge, says: “Mr. Judge asked not testify publicly. If the FBI or any law enforcement agency requests Mr. Judge’s cooperation, he will answer any and all questions posed to him.” — my colleague @Arianedevogue reports.

@dlb100b It's a serious question, actually, because she was scheduled to ask questions on behalf of Republican senators. That's what Grassley said at the beginning of the day.
Is Rachel Mitchell on her way back to Arizona?
"For me, going to church on Sunday was like brushing my teeth -- automatic. It still is," Kavanaugh says, answering critics who questioned why he didn't list church on his calendars.
"We should pray for the woman -- a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old," Kavanaugh says, telling the story of what his daughter told him the other night about Professor Ford. His voice breaking, he added: "We mean no ill will."
"You may defeat me in my final vote, but you'll never get me to quit - never," Kavanaugh says in a forceful opening statement, which is designed to circle the wagons, rally the base and turn this confirmation battle into a political war with an uncertain finish.
Kavanaugh’s turn—he’s coming out swinging. The president is watching from residence of the White House. “Yes, he still supports Brett and feels terribly for what he’s been through,” an official said.

Finally, the lede of the press conference! "I still love the paper," President Trump says of the @nytimes.
"I could be convinced of anything. Maybe she'll say something," Trump said, insisting he's leaving the door open to being surprised by Kavanaugh hearing. This, of course, will be music to the ears of Collins and Murkowski. Yet it doesn't erase his comments from the past week.
About that Tuesday laughter at the UN, President Trump said: "They weren't laughing at me. They were laughing with me. We had fun." Yet a quick read of speeches from fellow foreign leaders and a few conversations with diplomats in the room suggests this certainly isn't the case.
"I could be doing this all day long. I could be doing this all day long," President Trump said as the news conference passed the one-hour mark, raising the question of whether time really is a president's most valuable commodity.

I would have to check my calendar, but I'm not sure there's been another week in the Trump presidency where he's taken more questions -- arriving at UN, departing UN, pool sprays with leaders and this press conference. It's not a record-setting week in answers, however.
"I could have a lot of Supreme Court judges -- more than two," Trump said, referring to the possibility of appointments for future vacancies.

Well, ok then.... "I've been accused. I've been accused. False accusations," Trump said. "You can check with Sean Hannity. Fox. They covered it very carefully."
One of President Trump's  biggest objectives for this press conference is to make this moment just another episode of the ongoing partisan fight in Washington, rather than about anything bigger like a lifetime  Supreme Court appointment or sexual assault.
"They know it’s a big fat con job," President Trump said of Democrats, deflecting on the question of why the White House didn't have the FBI reopen its background investigation.
President Trump has left the United Nations. He does not answer a question about the latest Kavanaugh allegation. Unclear if he's up to speed, given he's been away from a TV for two hours chairing the UN Security Council meeting.

By saying this of Kavanaugh today, "I feel so badly for him that he's going through this. This is not a man that deserves this," President Trump inches closer to the opposite of what Kellyanne Conway said a day ago: "She should not be ignored or insulted."
Trump still takes a measured tone, but the discipline slips away a bit every time we hear him speak on Kavanaugh. For the first time, he makes it about a Democratic plot against him: "Because they obstruct and because they resist. That is the name of their campaign against me."
President Trump says he has not spoken to Kavanaugh this week, but supports him unequivocally. He says FBI doesn’t want to open an investigation and won’t ask them to. He repeats his measured and disciplined words from Monday, but ratchets up blame on Democrats.
In an interview today, @ChuckGrassley tells @okayhenderson: “For my part, not only as chairman of the committee, but an individual senator—I think most of my colleagues feel the same way—these sort of accusations need to be looked into and we’re taking steps to look into them.”

A few takeaways from President Trump's rally tonight in Indiana:		People he talked about at length: Hillary Clinton, Bobby Knight, Donald Trump.	 	People he did not mention: Jeff Sessions, Robert Mueller, John McCain.
So far tonight, President Trump has spent more time talking about Hillary Clinton, Bobby Knight and the media than the GOP message for the 2018 elections. But the crowd inside a packed Ford Center in downtown Evansville, which seats 11,000, loves the show. No question about it.
Moments after declaring: "This election is about safety and this election is about jobs," President Trump returned to his favorite election of all: the great campaign of 2016. He is now in the middle of the story of how Bobby Knight came to endorse him and he won states.
About 40 minutes into a grievance-laced speech tonight in Indiana -- aimed largely at the media -- Trump offers a 2018 message: "This election is about safety and this election is about jobs.”

@TreyYingst @FoxNews Congratulations!
Rick Gates testimony is done for the day in the Manafort trial. He left courtroom holding copy of a Dan Brown novel. Court resumes Tuesday at 9:30 a.m., @kpolantz reports.
Gates told jurors he helped Manafort file false tax returns by lying to his boss’ accountants about under reporting income, creating false loans and not disclosing Manafort’s ownership of the foreign accounts, @KaraScannell reports.
Rick Gates said he had been cheating Paul Manafort out of "several hundred thousand" dollars. Gates said he stole the money from Manafort by submitting to him false expense reports, @kpolantz reports from court.
Rick Gates clearly stated he and Paul Manafort had 15 foreign accounts they did not report to the federal government and knew it was illegal. He said he did not submit the required forms "at Mr. Manafort's direction," @kpolantz reports from court.
Our team at the federal courthouse in Alexandria says Rick Gates will be the next witness to testify at the Paul Manafort trial. Gates, a longtime assistant and protege to Manafort, is cooperating with the feds and is the star witness of Mueller probe.

President Trump is leaving for a weekend at his golf retreat in New Jersey. He did not take questions from reporters on the south lawn of the White House as he boarded Marine One.
Cabinet officials and others invited to today's NSC meeting on election security are leaving White House now. The meeting was set to start at 3 pm. If it started as scheduled, the president's meeting on election security was less than 30 minutes.
It was two years ago today, during the Democratic convention, when @realDonaldTrump said this: "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens.”
President Trump is back at the White House from a day trip to Iowa and Illinois. He did not stop to take questions tonight — or at any point today — about legal developments involving two of his closest NY confidantes

The @mitchellreports interview with Dan Coats is extraordinary. To recap: The president's hand-picked Intel Chief said it wasn't wise for Trump to meet one-on-one with Putin in Helsinki and it was a bad idea to invite the Russian ambassador to the Oval Office.
NEW: White House reverses course on plan for Putin to allow his government to interrogate Americans. As Senate proposes to rebuke WH, @PressSec now says: “It is a proposal that was made in sincerity by President Putin, but President Trump disagrees with it."

Since well before the election, Trump has repeatedly argued that he Russia wanted Clinton to win.		Today, we get the answer straight from Putin himself.		"Did you want Donald Trump to win?" @jeffmason1 of Reuters asks.		Putin: "Yes I did."
President Trump, standing on foreign soil, repeats out loud what he said on Twitter: "I hold both countries responsible. I think the Untied States has been foolish... We're all to blame." The only question now is whether any Republican leaders will disagree.
Putin said he "had to reiterate things I’ve said several times," saying Russian state "has never interfered and is not going to interfere" into American politics. The question is what Trump said when he heard that....

7. While Trump was intrigued at the prospect of picking a woman, he did not believe Judge Amy Coney Barrett  or others were the right choice “for the Kennedy seat.” The 11th-hour interest in Hardiman was genuine, a person close to the process said, but never as real as Kavanaugh
6. The president was won over by Kavanaugh’s intellect, pedigree and his view of executive power, all of which outweighed any worry about choosing an insider or Bush alum. “He was the best guy for the job,” a person close to the process said.
5. The president was heartened that key conservative voices like Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and Breitbart writers were coming to Kavanaugh’s defense in recent days.
4. Asked whether the president ever doubted Kavanaugh was the right choice, a person familiar with the process said: “No, but he wanted to see how it was playing out and who was coming to his defense.”
3. While the specific points of discussion between Trump and Kennedy have stayed private, the president walked away from that meeting believing Kavanaugh was a leading choice. Kavanaugh, a former Kennedy clerk, has long been the favorite of White House Counsel Don McGahn.
2. Two people close to the process say Trump favored Kavanaugh as one of his leading contenders even before Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. And during the president’s private Oval Office meeting with Kennedy 12 days ago, their conversation reaffirmed that view.
1. A bit of our behind-the-scenes reporting from the Supreme Court pick: In the end, President Trump essentially ended where he began: supporting Judge Brett Kavanaugh as his choice for the Supreme Court.
That sound you hear — as soon as the applause stops in the East Room — is social conservatives and Bush haters rushing to rally behind Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/vgtXxp6Bq8
President Trump introduces Judge Brett Kavanaugh as his nominee to fill Justice Anthony Kennedy’s seat on the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, a Kennedy clerk, was always the leading choice, despite a fierce battle among conservatives in the final days.
If Kavanaugh is announced as Trump’s pick, as many believe he will be, one question to ponder as the summer confirmation battle flares: Will his fight be more uphill, given the circular firing squad among conservatives, or has this aired issues that would surfaced anyway?

President Trump pays tribute to Justice Athony Kennedy, calling him 'A great man.' And then he turns to this: “I’m very honored that he chose to do it during my term in office. He felt confident in me to make the right choice to carry on his great legacy.”
"You need a senator who doesn’t just talk like they’re from North Dakota. But votes like they’re from North Dakota," Trump said, adding: "A vote for any Democart in November is a vote for Schumer, Nancy and Maxine. Maxine – she’s a beauty!"
It didn't take long tonight here in Fargo for @realDonaldTrump to go after @SenatorHeitkamp, calling her "a liberal Democrat." He didn't tell this crowd that he has wooed her repeatedly and twice asked her to join the Republican Party.
Not at all Democrats believe the Supreme Court confirmation should wait for midterms. “I was taught that two wrongs don’t make a right. All senators need to have time to meet and evaluate the body of work of any nominee," @SenatorHeitkamp says before Trump arrives in Fargo.
"We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall," @SenMajLdr says on the Senate floor. "It's imperative than the president's nominee be considered fairly."

President Trump will push for a swift confirmation of a Supreme Court justice "before the midterm elections," a senior White House official says. A nomination could come "within weeks," official says.

"That was very close to war for many years – many years. Now we can have something where everyone can live in peace for a long time. There is denuclearization. That’s the real story. That’s the real story," @realDonaldTrump said of North Korea nuclear threat.

"Today, we had a historic meeting and have agreed to leave the past behind. The world will see a major change," Kim Jong Un says through an interpreter at the conclusion of summit.
"We're signing a pretty comprehensive document. We've had a really great term together, a great relationship," @realDonaldTrump says, sitting down with Kim Jong Un. "We're both very honored to sign the document."
President Trump seems to have just taken Kim Jong Un over to the Beast to let him look into the presidential limousine. Amazing.
"A really fantastic meeting -- a lot of progress. Top of the line. We are going right now for a signing," President Trump just told reporters.
'A prelude to peace.' That's one of the ways Kim Jong Un described his meetings with President Trump. Full quote: "By boldly overcoming the past that has been holding us back for a long time...I believe that sitting down together, across each other, is a great prelude to peace."
President Trump is on his way to the site of the Singapore summit, the first time an American president will meet a North Korean leader. Our coverage is underway now on @AC360

"There are always irritants in relationships," Secretary of State Pompeo says when asked about US-Canada relations.
"The hypothesis is ludicrous," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says when asked how North Korea can trust the United States -- given the president's weekend explosion at US allies at the G7.
President Trump is going into this meeting with "confidence, a  positive attitude and a real meaning" for change, Pompeo said, adding that on Tuesday "we will get our clearest reading to date" whether Kim Jong Un is serious.
US says North Korea has repeatedly expressed its desire to denuclearize. "We are eager to see if those words prove sincere," Pompeo tells reporters in Singapore.

Trump’s scrapping of an Iran deal he inherited raised the stakes for a North Korean agreement he hopes to build — a contradiction over two aspiring nuclear powers. My story tonight with @Kevinliptakcnn: https://t.co/kTg7VuGZuF
BOTTOM LINE: Two words not spoken in President Trump's Iran address: "President Obama." The fact that it was negotiated on his watch is at the root of the US withdrawal today, even as Trump ramps up North Korea talks. Will that deal have as many checks or methods of verification?
Trump: "At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction: That a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program. Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.” #IranDeal
President Trump speaking now on Iran. Tune into @CNN
In withdrawing from deal, President Trump will say shortly: “We have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie," a White House official says. He will deliver a strong argument about Iran building its nuclear program, a point at odds with allies and many officials.

"I never wrecked a car," Dr. Ronny Jackson tells @ElizLanders, as a new round of allegations come from Senate Democrats on VA Committee. He adds: "We're still moving ahead as planned."

While President Trump is telling folks he doesn’t believe his longtime pal Michael Cohen would ever turn on him, a White House official tells me he’s seen by aides in the West Wing as “a wildcard that we can do little to nothing about.”
A week after Comey’s book release, President Trump is said to be unfazed. “So far he’s weathered Comey,” a Republican who spoke to him at Mar-a-lago this week tells me. “It’s Cohen that’s consuming him.”

Welcoming Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, President Trump says he will meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un “very soon.” As talks to set up summit continue, he said: it’s “possible things won’t’ go well and we won’t have the meeting. We will see what happens.”
I asked Kudlow if there is confusion surrounding new Russian sanctions, he said: "No." He added this about Ambassador Nikki Haley: "She got ahead of the curve...there might have been some momentarily confusion."
"The IRS is crashing? It sounds horrible. It sounds really bad. I hope it gets fixed," Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, says at a press briefing in Florida -- unaware about the system crash until asked by a reporter.
A key part of the Trump-Abe summit in Florida will be talking about a potential Trump-North Korea summit, which a US official says is still being planned with possible date of May or early June. No venue yet decided, which is one of many key sticking points.
Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, is briefing the press in West Palm Beach on Trump-Abe summit. He opens with optimism: "We’re in early stages of an economic boom here in the United States!"

Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert was among one of the best-liked senior aides in the West Wing, a cheerleader and mentor type to many, people inside the White House say. National Security Adviser pushed Bossert out, he "wanted his own team," source says.
Strong words from Judiciary Chairman @ChuckGrassley, who tells our @SuzanneMalveaux: “It would be suicide for the president to fire him. I think the less the President says about this whole thing the better off he will be. I think Mueller is a person of stature and respected.”
Trump canceling trip to South America, @PressSec says, to focus on Syria. This highly unusual move comes as he is still fuming this morning about Cohen office raid.
"It has been decided that an official list of political leaders – both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle's wedding. Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household." — Palace spokesman to CNN
Obamas will not be attending Royal wedding, a Palace sportsman tells @CNN, as no elected officials were invited. But people close to Obamas and Palace say “the couples look forward to seeing each other soon.” (This avoids protocol issues of inviting one president, not another.)
President Trump made the decision on his own to bluntly -- and angrily -- address the Cohen raid while sitting alongside his military leaders. "You can see how angry he is," an official says, who adds that he wanted to talk about what had angered him for the last two hours on TV.
Important to point out that President Trump is making these comments while meeting with his military leaders. Extraordinary that he kicks off Syria decision meeting by first talking about Cohen and blasting his AG, Deputy AG and Special Counsel.
President Trump is fuming about the FBI raid of Michael Cohen even as he weighs potential Syria strikes. Incredible back-to-back comments coming up shortly on @CNNSitRoom
President Trump blasts FBI raid of Cohen's office, saying: I just heard they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys. Good man. It’s a disgraceful situation A witch hunt.  (via pool report)

"China has been taking advantage of the US for many years ... I don't blame China. I blame the people running our country. I blame presidents, I blame representatives, I blame negotiators," @realDonaldTrump says today, echoing his sympathetic words to Xi last  year in Beijing.

This comment from President Trump today: "Everybody wants to work in the White House" will be tested like never before with Cohn's departure. Communications directors and most staffers don't move markets. Economic advisers do.
Steve Bannon -- surely smiling over Cohn's departure -- told reporters in Zurich: "Donald Trump does not want to start a trade war." But added: "There has been enough strategic economic dialogue with the Chinese. It's all happy talk. Now President Trump has pulled the trigger."
President Trump became angry at Gary Cohn's resistance on trade over the last 24-48 hours, a person close to the matter says. The resignation happened in last day. "Trade was the last straw," person says.
Gary Cohn, the president’s chief economic adviser, has resigned. Trump calls him “a rare talent,” praises him for driving tax agenda. No mention of deep divide on trade, a fight Cohn lost.
Trump refuses to say who he wants to see leave from his staff, but says: "Believe me, everybody wants to work in the Oval Office. They all want a piece of that .. I like conflict, I like seeing that."
"We’ll do it a very loving way. A loving, loving way," President Trump said, asked about the prospect of a trade war with some allies.

"I think it would be funny if they arrested me," former Trump aide @San Nunberg tells @KatyTurNBC of his defiance with Mueller probe and refusal to sit before grand jury.

White House says Porter's background investigation was not completed. Important to note that if a background check is formally completed -- and denied -- it sticks with you indefinitely. That is one reason, officials familiar with this type of thing say, it was never finished.

@EricDM1 Good question. I don't remember to be honest. I've had it for awhile. It's not Union Jack, though, more burgundy I think.
President Trump invited Doug Jones to the White House in a congratulatory call today, a sign of the new reality of the 51-49 Senate divide. Jones will be the most sought-after Democrat around -- at least for now.
@pablo_honey1 He endorsed him and that was the one and only Tweet he sent out. He didn't visit or talk about the race since this Sept. 26 Tweet as near as we can tell.
Could there be any outcome other than Jones winning? "I would find that highly unlikely to occur," Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill tells @jaketapper.
In Trump's comments tonight, he acknowledges the "write-in votes played a very big factor." That is true -- GOP voters like Richard Shelby and others didn't vote Moore. And many other Republicans surely stayed home. https://t.co/wb9R2UEQb2
As @realDonaldTrump delivered a full-throated endorsement of Moore, the silence of @VP was deafening and telling. Pence tweeted about Moore a total of once -- nearly three months ago -- and stayed silent ever since.
A top Republican in close touch to the White House says: “This should be a wakeup call" -- of President Trump following Bannon's lead in Alabama. Silence now at the White House.
Steven Law: “This is a brutal reminder that candidate quality matters ... Not only did Steve Bannon cost us a critical Senate seat in one of the most Republican states in the country, but he also dragged the President of the United States into his fiasco.”

This is what a White House briefing might look like with a non-Tweeting president: an official answering questions about a pressing matter. But today, Francis Cissna, director of US Citizenship and Immigration is also playing the role of foil for Trump Tweets. https://t.co/gQKvhJvF4V

Important point about Minnesota: Clinton carried state by 1.5 points in 2016 over Trump. (A state Obama beat Romney in by 8 points.) Tight victory stunned Democrats. I misspoke on Inside Politics and inadvertently said Trump won. Folks, thanks for pointing it out.
"I would do it all over again in a heartbeat," @SenFranken says in thoughtful and very political resignation speech, invoking the late Paul Wellstone repeatedly.
Franken was already worried that as a former comedian he wouldn't be taken seriously when he arrived in the Senate in the summer of '09 - after a 6-month recount - but he won respect from both sides of aisle. Democrats abandoned him in the end.
"I may be resigning my seat but I will not be giving up my voice," @SenFranken says in remarkable Senate floor speech, saying he has done nothing as a senator "to bring dishonor to institution."
Thinking back to the first Sunday TV interview @SenFranken did -- back in 2010 with me at ABC. Asked what comedian Franken would say about Senator Franken? "I've just been impeccable.... I've made some small mistakes, I suppose." https://t.co/c8N44td5i4
Franken to deliver his speech on Senate floor at 11:45 am, a major stage for what is universally expected to be a farewell address. Some close supporters have urged him to stay, but Democratic senators want moral high ground if Moore arrives in Senate.
RT @MarquardtA: For Doug Jones to beat Roy Moore on Tuesday he needs African-Americans to turn out in large numbers, around 25% of voters.…
Eagle-eyed @tedbarrettcnn spots Norm Coleman in Capitol - just as Franken talk reaches a fever pitch. "Is there a seat to run for?" he asks, noting Trump came within 1.5 points in Minnesota. The stat Coleman really remembers?	 312 -- the # of votes he lost to Franken by in '08.
A few key words from Trump today that @camanpour smartly points out: The US isn't taking a position on "specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders."
In their fight for the upper hand in sexual harassment and misconduct political fight, Democrats scrambling for the upper hand: four women senators say in near unison @SenFranken should resign. Hard to imagine him surviving this new tidal wave.

"I think we're fairly close, but we have to get massive border security," Trump said. "Mitch is on board. Paul Ryan is on board."
Trump says DACA will come with "massive" border security. Key point: He could have trashed Pelosi and Schemer. He didn't. He wants a deal.
