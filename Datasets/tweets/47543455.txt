@dansbfg @danmoulthrop @TheCityClub I’m not trying to silence anyone, he has several other speeches. My concern is the abuse of a 100 year old institution to push lies in an era of rising anti-Semitism and fake narratives and conspiracy, which @thecityclub will fuel. Wildly inappropriate &amp; free speech no defense
@dansbfg @danmoulthrop @TheCityClub There is a difference between people who engage in legitimate discourse and those who se facts to make their case and those who ADMIT to using lies and deception to further their vile cause - which in this case is hate speech, tired or not. No institution should be used that way
@dansbfg @danmoulthrop @TheCityClub Lets be clear what you are "advocating," Dan -- you mean the mission to advocate lies and stoke demonization of Jews and the Jewish state by someone who admits he makes it up to do exactly that.  OK so now we know why you are lone voice defending Dan's decision.
@dansbfg @danmoulthrop @TheCityClub Deception, which is Pappes agenda, erodes public discourse, and presenting falsehoods as legitimate, as Dan is seeking to do using @thecityclub, is damaging.There is a venue for such hate speech, on the street corner on a soap box, not a a podium being paid for by the community.
@dansbfg @danmoulthrop Pappe has several speeches when he is in town, hosted by Dan's friends Josh Stasher at Kent State and Pete Moore at Case Western. The question is why is @theCityClub paying for his microphone and why is Dan using the intuition in an attempt to forward his agenda? Board vote?
@dansbfg @danmoulthrop Based of the deceptive nature of his statement defending Ilan Pappe &amp; exonerating him of anti-Semitism, you should start questioning his motives and his integrity. There is no defense of a self-admitted academic fraud in an era where fake news &amp; lies is eroding civil discourse.
@NOCMES I know that Pete Moore &amp; Josh Stasher, fellow anti-Zionists, are hosting him too, and that you are an affiliate of CAIR, a support of terrorism and JVP, another deceptive anti-Zionist, anti-Semitic organization that promotes Ilan Pappe and his discredited narrative of lies &amp; hate

@danmoulthrop @TheCityClub And more-that they approved and endorse the statement you made EXONERATING Ilan Pappe of anti-Semtism.	That would mean you and they reject the EU, US and Int’l definition of anti-Semitism that Pappe violates each time he speaks, regularly like comparing Israel to Nazis or ISIS.
@danmoulthrop @TheCityClub Dan, “as a Jew,” I’m curious: what is the process at the city club used by the Board to choose and approve speakers? Presumably you got their approval before using their names to push your agenda using an anti-Semitic pseudo-academic who has admitted his work is anti-historical.
Cc: @danmoulthrop —&gt; “as a Liberal,” I agree with Ben Sasse. You Dan &amp; @TheCityClub, by legitimizing a discredited “academic” who admits he employs fake history and lies to push his anti-Semitic ideology under the guise of “academia,” are part of the problem, not the solution. https://t.co/FVfT9HMbTX

Hey Dan, how long have you been using you “as a Jew” line to host anti-ISRAEL speakers? I understand you and Julia Salazar have more in common than just ideology &amp; support for Intersectionality and postmodern anti-Zionism  	https://t.co/U5GfAEAN24
An open question to Ilan Pappe: Why do you defend antisemites? https://t.co/Fn3NlzFfwr
@danmoulthrop Yeah. To honor Supreme Court Justice and passionate Zionist Louis D. Brandeis you give a platform to one of the world’s leading anti-Semites, avowed to destroy the Jewish state, in the midst of the High Holidays. You dishonor his memory and distort his quote invoking it here.
@danmoulthrop @TheCityClub As a Jew...  ridiculous!
@kampeas Is Pappe being interviewed by a journalist or being given a free platform to speak? Not the same.
@kampeas Ibid.
@danmoulthrop @TheCityClub The only more objectionable thing you could do is host the event on Rosh ha Shana or Yom Kippur. Congratulations. Did you run your statement past your corporate sponsors? I hope someone does.
@danmoulthrop @TheCityClub It is not about balance, Dan. You can’t undo the lies and falsehoods once you legitmize them. You have been swindled by your local “partners” and who are themselves associates of groups that support terrorism and like Ilan Pappe, seek the destruction of the Jewish state.
@danmoulthrop @TheCityClub It is deeply flawed, ignorant of the facts, expresses disdain for those in the community who know of what they object &amp; uses American freedoms to defend anti-Semitism as it grows today. That’s not even a close call. Governor Wallace is no defense. It’s an indictment. Fix yourself
@kampeas And yet Bannon &amp; Pappe are different. This is about hate speech, not freedom of speech or politics. One can oppose the Bannon cancellation &amp; urge one here.  Pappe admits he trucks in “fake history, ie blood libels, disguised as academics, &amp; wants destruction of the Jewish state.
