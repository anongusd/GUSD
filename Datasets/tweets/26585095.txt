@NicStrob @NBCParksandRec @NBCChicagoPD @tim_baltz I actually got really sick halfway through filming, so probably that I should drink less coffee and take more vitamins. But luckily it was right when we were filming the dream sequences in episode six. It helped me look even paler! #Shrink #AskTimBaltz
@sam_steiber @NBCParksandRec @NBCChicagoPD @tim_baltz David's supervising therapist Sue is definitely inspired by Sue Gillan in real life. Great listener, incredibly patient, and giver of the best advice you could hope for. Plus she's hilarious. #Shrink #AskTimBaltz
@robbiegirl @NBCParksandRec @NBCChicagoPD @tim_baltz David is a really well-intentioned character still gaining experience in a new field	so the difficulty is living through his failures and not losing his good intentions. #Shrink #AskTimBaltz
@mali_now_ski @NBCParksandRec @NBCChicagoPD @tim_baltz Great question. #Shrink was originally a web series that @tedtremper and I started in Chicago in 2011 and then turned into a full pilot in 2012 that we took to @nytvf. And the city itself was a character in the series so we really wanted to film it there. #AskTimBaltz
