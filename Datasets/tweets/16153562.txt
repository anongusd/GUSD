RT @JoanneLinDC: .@amnestyusa welcomes House passage of #BackgroundChecks bill BUT denounces 11th-hour measure that demonizes immigrants &amp;…
(3 of 3) We appeal to Senators to remove this problematic language when they consider universal background check legislation moving forward. #humanrights #endgunviolence
(2 of 3) we take issue with last minute provisions in the bill requiring ICE be contacted in certain circumstances. This language is intended to instill fear in immigrant communities.
Today The House passed HR 8, which would require background checks on all firearm purchases in the U.S. While we supported the bill in its original form, and continue to support the need for universal background checks (1 of 3)
THANK YOU to everyone who worked so hard to make this huge step forward possible. 		Up to 97% of Americans support background checks for every firearm purchase, and it’s obvious why: background checks work, and can significantly reduce gun violence.
The most significant gun violence prevention bill in two decades just passed the House! 		HR 8 would require everyone who buys a gun to have a background check, and now it’s up to the Senate to pass their own version, and make it law. https://t.co/JqpibkrbVC
Background checks work: States requiring them have 47% fewer women killed by intimate partner gun violence, substantially fewer suicides using a firearm and 53% fewer police officers killed on duty.		Call your Representatives to tell them to vote for HR 8 today: 1-844-818-0754
Gun violence in the U.S. is a human rights crisis. On average, 108 people are killed with firearms every day, and 39,773 died by firearms in 2017 alone.		HR 8 would require a background check for every gun purchase. Call your Reps to tell them to vote for it today: 1-844-818-0754
HR 8 would make sure that private sales, including internet gun purchases, include a background check. If it were law already, it may have prevented the killing of Valarie Jackson and six children. 		Call your Representatives to tell them to vote for HR8 today: 1-844-818-0754
Because of his criminal record, the alleged shooter would not have cleared the necessary background checks to buy a firearm through a federally licensed dealer. 		Instead, he purchased a 9mm handgun over the internet through a private sale.
On 9 July 2015, the month before the mass killing, police issued an arrest warrant for the alleged shooter after he slammed Valerie Jackson’s head into a refrigerator while he was trying to beat her 10-year-old son with a belt.
According to media reports, the alleged shooter previously served at least five years in prison for five felonies, including armed robbery. Valarie Jackson was granted a protection order when he threatened her with a knife and he was sentenced to nine months in jail.
On Saturday, 8 August 2015, Valarie Jackson, along with Dewayne Jackson and six children aged between six and 13, were shot and killed. The alleged shooter was Jackson’s former partner.
No one's human rights are secure while there is unfettered access to guns. Today the House of Representatives votes on HR 8, a bill that would ensure everyone who wants to buy a gun has to go through a background check. 		Here is why we ask you to support this bill with us:

Our findings of this investigation will soon be fully expanded on in a public report on #Venezuela.
During a research mission in the states of Lara, Yaracuy, Vargas, and different locations in Caracas, from Jan 31-Feb 17, we gathered more than 50 testimonies and documented 15 emblematic cases, including some of serious human rights violations and crimes under international law.
In just five days, at least 41 people died during these protests, all of them from gunshot wounds. More than 900 were arbitrarily detained, and just on 23 January (the day that demonstrations were held across the country), 770 arbitrary arrests were reported.
From Jan 21-25, numerous demonstrations were registered, many of them in impoverished areas, where protests demanding this change had not previously been so visible. There is a strong presence of pro-Nicolás Maduro armed groups (commonly known as “colectivos”) in these areas.
Venezuela has suffered a major crisis of massive human rights violations for years, with shortages of food, medicines, hyperinflation, violence and political repression forcing more than three million people to flee the country since 2015.
"His government is attacking the most impoverished people that it claims to defend, but instead it murders, detains and threatens them.”  - @ErikaGuevaraR of @amnesty &amp; @AmnistiaOnline
“The authorities under Nicolás Maduro are trying to use fear and punishment to impose a repulsive strategy of social control against those who demand change." - @ErikaGuevaraR of @amnesty &amp; @AmnistiaOnline
...and particularly to punish residents of impoverished neighborhoods that decided to protest between Jan 21-25 2019.
Venezuelan security forces under the command of Nicolás Maduro executed and used excessive force against people, and arbitrarily detained hundreds of others, including teenagers, in an escalation of their policy of repression as a means of controlling the people of Venezuela...

Call on Congress to protect asylum seekers, https://t.co/fxhiXext8L
The real crisis is the horrific violence and persecution faced by desperate people and families who have fled the only homes they’ve ever known because they have nowhere else to go to seek safety.
President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency so he can bypass Congress and build a wall at the US-Mexico border is just one more effort to manufacture a crisis where there is none.
Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity, respect, and fairness, no matter their immigration status. No amount of federal funding should go toward building a wall or increasing the number of people unfairly detained for doing what any one of us would do in their shoes.
Additionally, many people come to the United States to reunite with family members who already live here.
People trying to rebuild their lives are not bringing crime and violence, but rather running from desperate situations. It is cruel to suggest they should stay in Mexico when it is not a safe third country for everyone.
While President Trump routinely invokes national security when discussing this manufactured crisis at the border, the reality for people arriving to the United States is very different. #NationalEmergency

On Feb.13, Instagram moved an account under the username Alpatuni, following a request from Rudiantara, the comms &amp; info minister. The minister claimed that the account “promoted pornography” under Article 27 paragraph 1 of the 2008 law on Electric Information and Transactions.
“At a time when Indonesian people face hateful homophobic rhetoric and discrimination, Instagram has failed to be an ally. It should take a bold stand and reinstate the account immediately.” - @Amnesty Indonesia’s Executive Director Usman Hamid
It did nothing other than publish harmless illustrations featuring a character’s daily life, including references to his sexual orientation.
By complying with the government’s request to remove this account, Instagram has caved to the growing repression of LGBTI people in Indonesia. This account did not publish pornography, as the government claims

At the southern border, his obsession with divisive symbols like a wall is just part of his continued efforts to stigmatize people desperately in need of protection. His policy of sending vulnerable asylum seekers back to dangerous conditions in Mexico is nothing short of cruel.

It demonstrates the lengths Mexico and the US will take to violate the human rights of people, including children, desperately seeking safety.
Yesterday’s standoff with Mexican officials validates reports that authorities there are cooperating with the US to dissuade people from asking for asylum.
Over an hour later, our director @MargaretLHuang was able to negotiate an agreement w/ Mexican authorities. She &amp; an interpreter would accompany the children onto US soil to ask for asylum if the rest of the delegation left. The children were then processed &amp; made it into the US.
The delegation refused to leave until the children were allowed to present their claims. In order to discourage the delegation to leave, Mexican authorities asked everyone with proper documents to proceed through the port of entry while the delegation stood to the side.
In any case, minors are not allowed to put their name on this list. Children have no choice but to present their claims at the port of entry.
In doing so, they exert influence over the manager of the list while avoiding accusations of metering. This practice is not only unconscionable, it is against international law.
According to reports from organizations on the ground, Mexican authorities select asylum-seekers to keep the list for weeks at a time by promising them they will be able to cut the line.
The authorities claimed that asking for asylum at the port of entry is against proper procedure and advised the children to get on the asylum waitlist. The authorities also claimed that the asylum waitlist is kept in an informal notebook managed by the asylum-seekers themselves.
Upon approaching the port of entry, the delegation was stopped by Mexican authorities who refused to allow the children to proceed any further to present their asylum claims.

Our researchers have documented a range of human right violations committed by the US against people seeking asylum at the southern border with Mexico, including illegal pushbacks, ill-treatment in immigration detention &amp; devastating policies such as family separation &amp; detention
Families traveling to the border are not a national security crisis—they are people like you and me, except that many have left their home to seek protection from persecution and violence. We must not abandon those who have lost everything and are trying to rebuild their lives.
The US government has manufactured this crisis, defying international law while heartlessly putting families and individuals in harm’s way.
We have come together to show the US that the eyes of the world are on the southern border. While Trump continues to fight for a border wall, thousands of children &amp; families are being forced to wait for protection while enduring dangerous conditions in Mexico. - @MargaretLHuang

The Department of Homeland Security previously denied the findings of our report. #FamiliesBelongTogether
In October 2018, we released a report finding that the U.S. deliberately adopted immigration policies &amp; practices that caused catastrophic harm to thousands of people seeking safety in the U.S., including the separation of over 6,000 family units in just a four-month period.
“Ripping children from the arms of their parents or guardians is a brazen violation of human rights. US authorities must immediately reveal full statistics on family separations for public scrutiny and ensure that all separated families are reunited.” - @brian_griffey of @amnesty
By their own admission, US authorities intentionally separated families in order to deter others from trying to seek safety in the United States. This cruel and dangerous policy must never be put into practice again. #FamiliesBelongTogether

The US government must take steps to fulfill its obligation to those seeking asylum and rectify this crisis of its own making.
Detaining some families indefinitely while leaving others vulnerable to danger while they remain in Mexico must stop.
But the Trump Administration’s policies of cruelty must stop. The policy of deliberately slowing the asylum process to a trickle must stop. The stigmatization of asylum seekers must stop.

From forcing people to remain in an unsafe country, to deliberately slowing the process to a crawl, to detaining children for months on end, to unlawfully turning asylum-seekers away entirely, the U.S. has only increased the misery for people seeking protection.
The Trump Administration has done everything in its power to make the situation at the border as unbearable as possible.

"By bowing to the Saudi Arabian authorities’ demands, Netflix is in danger of facilitating the Kingdom’s zero-tolerance policy on freedom of expression and assisting the authorities in denying people’s right to freely access information." -  Samah Hadid of @amnesty
Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman came to power in June 2017, many outspoken human rights defenders, activists and critics have been arbitrarily detained, or unjustly sentenced to lengthy prison terms simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression.
Saudi Arabia’s censorship of Netflix using a cyber-crime law comes as no surprise, and is further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression in the Kingdom.
In Saudi Arabia, Netflix removed an episode of satirical comedy show Patriot Act that was critical of the country’s authorities after officials from the Kingdom complained.

We have asked repeatedly Twitter to make available meaningful and comprehensive data regarding the scale and nature of abuse on their platform, as well as how they are addressing it. #ToxicTwitter
In our sample study, black women were disproportionately targeted, being 84% more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive or problematic tweets. #ToxicTwitter
Women of color, (black, Asian, Latinx and mixed-race women) were 34% more likely to be mentioned in abusive or problematic tweets than white women. #ToxicTwitter
Using a combination of data science, machine learning, and thousands of volunteers to survey millions of tweets, we found that 7.1% of tweets sent to the women in the study were problematic or abusive. #ToxicTwitter
We partnered with an artificial intelligence software product company, called Element AI (@element_ai), using a sample of tweets mentioning 778 politicians and journalists in the US as well as in the UK. #ToxicTwitter

Sadly, this isn’t new. DHS has implemented policies that close the borders to asylum-seekers, pushing them back into harm’s way. This just puts families into even more of a desperate position.
In the end, these are human beings. People are fleeing unimaginable violence and persecution, taking on a dangerous journey to seek safety. The U.S. needs to ensure its policies and procedures protect their human rights at the border, in custody and in our courts.

The wall wouldn't just cost us billions of dollars — the human cost, in tribal lands divided, families torn apart, and lives lost in dangerous border crossings — would be immense. #TrumpShutdown
Throughout his presidency, President Trump has continued to try and get Congress to pay for his border wall, which would further endanger the lives of those seeking asylum. #TrumpShutdown #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/ijdAZeXODw

Google knows its actions will set a precedent for other tech companies. Google and @sundarpichai must do the right thing and drop Project Dragonfly for good. #DropDragonfly
“This is a watershed moment for Google. As the world’s number one search engine, it should be fighting for an internet where information is freely accessible to everyone, not backing the Chinese government’s dystopian alternative,” said @JoeWestby, researcher at @amnesty
Google CEO Sundar Pichai must drop Project Dragonfly. It would blacklist search terms like “human rights” and “Tiananmen Crackdown”. #DropDragonfly
Google plans to launch a censored search app in China could irreparably damage internet users’ trust in the tech company and would set a dangerous precedent for tech companies enabling rights abuses by governments. #DropDragonfly
Google CEO @sundarpichai is testifying now before the U.S. Congress. We're calling on Pichai to #DropDragonfly, the secret project for a censored search engine in China. If it doesn’t, Google will be cooperating with a repressive government who keeps tabs on their citizens.

Read our full new report on #CaravanaMigrante here: https://t.co/Fy990LFoe4
"If Mexico agrees to do the U.S. government’s dirty work at the expense of the caravan members’ dignity and human rights, it is effectively paying for Trump’s shameful border wall." - @ErikaGuevaraR, Americas Director at @amnesty
We received reports from Mexican officials speaking anonymously that raise doubts as to the supposed lack of capacity by US authorities to receive more people and indicate the pressure that the US government exercises on Mexican authorities to restrict entry of asylum seekers.
Yet our researchers confirmed with multiple sources in the Mexican government that Mexican immigration officials routinely take possession of the waitlist each night, and coordinate with U.S. border authorities on how many asylum seekers from the list will be received each day.
Mexican authorities cannot lawfully prevent people from exiting the country and seeking asylum at the U.S. border. #CaravanaMigrante
Mexican federal, state and municipal officials separately confirmed to our researchers that the temporary shelter did not have sufficient food, water and health services, and that respiratory illnesses were spreading among those staying there. #CaravanaMigrante
On November 18, our researchers visited Tijuana’s Benito Juarez sports complex, a temporary shelter where the municipal government had accommodated approximately 3,000 migrants and asylum seekers who had arrived in the first of several caravans totaling 8,000 -10,000 people.
Instead of militarizing the border &amp; peddling fear &amp; discrimination, Trump’s administration should show compassion for those forced to flee their homes &amp; must receive their requests for asylum without delay as required by US &amp; international law - @ErikaGuevaraR of @amnesty
Conditions could only worsen under a reported deal between both countries that, if agreed, would force asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their claims are processed, rather than allow them to enter the United States. #CaravanaMigrante
Unlawful U.S. border policies are leaving thousands of asylum seekers stranded in Mexico, where they are facing threats of deportation to their countries of origin, where they potentially face serious harm. #CaravanaMigrante
ICYMI: We released a new report on #CaravanaMigrante after our researchers returned from a recent mission in Tijuana, Mexico, highlighting the urgent need for protection of Central American refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in the Caravan.

“People who are fleeing violence and persecution have the right to seek safety. These are people just like you and me, except they are running for their lives.”  - @MargaretLHuang said earlier today. #caravan
It is unlawful and cruel to deny protection to desperate families simply because they arrived between ports of entry, especially when we have seen many people being turned away even when presenting themselves at these ports. #caravan
We’ll continue to monitor the #CaravanMigrante to ensure both Mexican and U.S. authorities are not violating the human rights of people seeking protection.
We visited the local sports center that has become essentially a camp where migrants are living temporarily as they wait to go through the port of entry into the United States. #Caravan https://t.co/kyHIr6aeoC

If @realDonaldTrump truly cared about finding the truth about Jamal Khashoggi, he’d support all efforts to investigate, including a UN investigation.
Earlier today, @realdonaldtrump signaled that he values his business partnerships with Saudi Arabia more than a commitment to human rights or accountability for the death of @WashingtonPost journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Our full statement on the new reports of torture and sexual harassment of detained activists in Saudi Arabia: https://t.co/WETXEfcoVD
The Saudi authorities must immediately and unconditionally release detained human rights defenders who are being held solely for their peaceful human rights work and launch a prompt, thorough and effective investigation into the reports of torture and other ill-treatment.
“Only a few weeks after the ruthless killing of Jamal Khashoggi, these shocking reports of torture, sexual harassment &amp; other forms of ill-treatment, if verified, expose further outrageous human rights violations by the Saudi authorities” said Lynn Maalouf of @amnesty.
NEW REPORT: Several Saudi Arabian activists, including a number of women, who have been arbitrarily detained without charge since May 2018 in Saudi Arabia’s Dhahban Prison, have reportedly faced sexual harassment, torture and other forms of ill-treatment during interrogation. https://t.co/J6XPAwXA2A

“We will continue to fight for justice and human rights in Myanmar – with or without her support.” - @kuminaidoo
Aung San Suu Kyi and her office have shielded the security forces from accountability by dismissing, downplaying or denying allegations of human rights violations and by obstructing international investigations into abuses.
More than 720,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh. A UN report has called for senior military officials to be investigated and prosecuted for the crime of genocide.
We have repeatedly criticized the failure of Aung San Suu Kyi and her government to speak out about military atrocities against the Rohingya population in Rakhine State, who have lived for years under a system of segregation and discrimination amounting to apartheid.
Since Aung San Suu Kyi became the de facto leader of Myanmar’s civilian-led government in April 2016, her administration has been actively involved in the commission or perpetuation of multiple human rights violations.
"Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defense of human rights," writes @kuminaidoo to Aung San Suu Kyi of #Myanmar
.@kuminaidoo, in a letter to Aung San Suu Kyi, has expressed our disappointment that she has not used her political and moral authority to safeguard human rights, justice or equality in Myanmar.
BREAKING: We have withdrawn our highest honour, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, from Aung San Suu Kyi, in light of the Myanmar leader’s shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for. https://t.co/Ag4ndGmVKo https://t.co/9Po3olDmlA

And Trump is chipping away at those protections. The Trump administration proposed new regulations that would allow children to be detained in jail indefinitely.
Malicious policies like family separation and detention are a brazen violation of human rights. People who are fleeing violence and persecution have the right to seek protection.
In the United States, the Trump administration is defying international law and manufacturing a crisis at the U.S./Mexico border by implementing policies that have already caused catastrophic and irreparable harm to thousands of people.

Read our most recent letter to the U.S. Senate about Brett Kavanaugh: https://t.co/fL1g0uRt1d
We continue to be deeply concerned about Kavanaugh’s record on a	range of other human rights issues—including access to abortion, women’s rights, LGBTI Rights, Indigenous rights, environmental rights, gun violence, refugee rights, criminal justice, surveillance and Guantánamo.
Before a vote, there must be a full disclosure of information relevant to Brett Kavanaugh’s possible involvement in U.S. torture practices.
In our previous letters highlighting concerns with the process of confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, we shared our view that his record on human rights has been insufficiently vetted.
Available information indicates the FBI investigation has not been thorough. Among other shortcomings, reports indicate that Ford, Swetnick &amp; Kavanaugh have not been interviewed by the FBI during this investigation, nor have a number of others who may have relevant information.
The Senate should not hold a vote on Brett Kavanaugh. There must be full disclosure of information relevant to his possible involvement in U.S. torture practices &amp; allegations of sexual assault against him must be fully investigated.
Trump wants a blank check on family detention. Americans do not want kids behind bars. We’re aiming for 50,000 comments from U.S. citizens like you.

This must be perceived as an all-out attack against our country’s ability to resettle refugees both now and in the future.
Last year, President Trump lowered the refugee admissions quota to 45,000. 		Now, for fiscal year 2019, the cap will be at only 30,000.

"Access to water is a human right. How can the disaster response to Hurricane Maria be an “unsung success” if $22 million of drinking water is left stockpiled on a runway while people are suffering?" - @kuminaidoo
Our remote-sensing analyst examined months of satellite imagery over the airport in Ceiba. It clearly shows how a large amount of goods covered by blue tarps accumulated rapidly on a disused runway from late January to early March 2018. https://t.co/n4gIkhnZPH
"President Trump’s government’s pitiful response shows a miserable failure to support the basic human rights of Puerto Ricans at a time when they needed it most."  - @kuminaidoo
"The death toll in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria was so massive because authorities failed to put in place basic safeguards that could have saved hundreds if not thousands of lives." - @kuminaidoo
Background: Abdiel Santana, a police officer in Puerto Rico shared photos on Facebook of a million boxes of water left on an airport runway. Later, @CBSNews confirmed that FEMA acknowledged that millions of water bottles for survivors of Hurricane Maria were left undistributed.

2.) Twitter should improve its reporting mechanisms to ensure consistent application and better response to complaints of violence and abuse. #ToxicTwitter

And @onetoughnerd we encourage you to urge the Trump administration to resettle at least 75,000 refugees next fiscal year. #RefugeesWelcome
.@onetoughnerd we need you to  hold the Trump administration accountable in resettling 45,000 refugees this year. Your state is stronger for it. #RefugeesWelcome
Refugees and their descendants contribute billions in taxes to the U.S. economy, and over a 20-year-period, contributed far more in taxes than the initial investment to resettle them. @onetoughnerd #RefugeesWelcome
Across the U.S.,@onetoughnerd the low number of refugee arrivals is putting an unnecessary strain on businesses, especially so in rural areas. #RefugeesWelcome
Don’t forget @onetoughnerd refugees generate economic growth for the country and the states they live in and create jobs in their local communities. Many industries in Michigan like hospitality and food production, now rely heavily on refugee workers.  #RefugeesWelcome
There are plenty of benefits  @onetoughnerd. Once resettled refugees not only contribute to their new communities economically but also are active in civic engagement &amp; the labor force. They maintain a strong devotion to education, purchase homes, work hard &amp; become U.S. citizens
As you know @onetoughnerd, the resettlement program is a small, life-saving program that protects the most vulnerable refugees and helps to unite families fractured by forced migration. We must protect it.

Here’s how you can take action to #EndFamilyDetention and #KeepFamiliesTogether: https://t.co/90M6ifESWa
Public pressure is critical to ensure that the Trump administration does not reunify the families only to detain them and return to forcible separation while challenging the court order or in future.
The fight continues for human rights. Don't fall for the administration's false choice of either detaining or separating families. Treat every family with dignity and give them due process. #EndFamilyDetention
The United States Federal Court ordered that thousands of families should be reunited, but we know the Trump administration will fight this every step of the way.

“Those with blood on their hands – right up the chain of command to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing – must be held to account for their role in overseeing or carrying out crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations under international law.” - @mattfwells

There remains much work to do to reform our criminal justice system to ensure that ‘equality under the law’ is more than an empty promise of international and domestic laws, but that justice be available to all.
In the late 1800s, as backlash to emancipation, black people were lynched in staggering numbers, for reasons including murder, theft &amp; rape of white women. We still see these trends today. Black men convicted of killing white victims are executed in disproportionate numbers
Despite this huge step forward it was not without setbacks, Jim Crow laws were passed that were state sanctioned racial segregation, and in the early 20th century former Confederate states sought to keep black people from voting and excluding them from the political process.
“...all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor…”
While the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing Confederate held slaves, took effect in January 1863, it’s estimated that TX still had 250,000 enslaved people until June 1865. In Galveston TX, 19 June 1865 Union Army General Gordon Granger announced General Order No 3 that said:
Happy Junteenth Independence Day! Today we commemorate 153 years to the day when, Texas, the final state to do so, abolished slavery. #Juneteenth is recognized by many as a day to celebrate freedom and liberation of black people from slavery.

The severe mental suffering that officials have intentionally inflicted on these families for coercive purposes, means that these acts meet the definitions of torture under both US and international law.
This is a spectacularly cruel policy, where frightened children are being ripped from their parent’s arms and taken to overflowing detention centers, which are effectively cages.
In fact, this policy of separating children from their parents is nothing short of torture. https://t.co/OzJjy4Ga81

Her situation is not unique. There are many more trans people seeking asylum in the U.S. stuck for months in detention where they are at risk.
But instead of offering her safety and a chance to rebuild her life, the U.S. government is detaining her in a private prison with inadequate and unresponsive health care.

Will you ensure that the FY2019 budget supports humanitarian aid for the Rohingya, @marcorubio?
We expect that @SenBobCorker &amp; all #SFRC members will continue to prioritize human rights &amp; humanitarian aid in FY2019 international affairs budget.
.@RepChrisSmith the budget must reflect human rights as a priority for U.S. government advocacy.
Wanted to make sure @RepEdRoyce &amp; all @HouseForeign members see our letter. Will you keep @SecPompeo accountable on human rights?
We won't be able to question Pompeo, so we're hoping Members of Congress will ask the tough questions he needs to be asked. Here's some inspiration: https://t.co/4I41OdRl3z
We sent an open letter to @SecPompeo urging him to prioritize human rights &amp; provide urgently needed humanitarian aid, including protections for refugees.

Full statement on the U.S. Embassy move to Jerusalem and the deaths of Palestinian protestors here: https://t.co/C81ODbGYbD https://t.co/4hOkAI9FxS
Israeli soldiers have used weapons -- some made in the U.S. and designed to cause maximum harm -- against individuals who were not posing an imminent threat to them, injuring thousands, and killing 37, including some in what appear to have been willful killings.
As Israel’s main supplier of military equipment and technology, the United States must finally realize that it is fueling serious human rights abuses and allowing Israel to remain unaccountable for their actions.
The new embassy in Jerusalem is a clear sign that the United States is rewarding Israel’s annexation of occupied territory. This move intentionally undermines Palestinian rights and in effect condones decades of violations by Israel.
#Gaza update: At least 37 Palestinians have been killed in protests. This is another horrific example of the Israeli military's use of excessive force and live ammunition. It is a violation of human rights and international standards.
