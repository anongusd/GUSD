@ryangrim @RL_Miller I just think it‚Äôs early and we need to go through a process before anything gets declared to be the official GND. I like legislating!
@RL_Miller No. It‚Äôs important for folks to know that the GND has not been developed yet. It is a way to look at climate action, and the legislative program won‚Äôt be enacted until 2021. I intend to be very involved in that.
The Green New Deal is about putting people at the center of climate solutions. It‚Äôs about making sure that whatever we do to solve climate lifts people up economically. Investing in clean water, clean tech, helping farmers. Simple idea  - solve climate, but don‚Äôt ignore people.
Being ambitious on climate isn‚Äôt to make an ideological point. It‚Äôs because climate change is  impacting the weather, farming, coastal areas, fisheries and drinking water. Everyone from the NSA to the DOD to the Bank of England is saying it‚Äôs urgent. Big problem means big plans.

Most underrated climate solutions. Go!
There are some encouraging scientific developments in farming that, if scalable, could allow both small and large farms to serve as a significant carbon sink while increasing profitability.
This ‚Äúnet zero carbon‚Äù concept is worth understanding for a moment. It‚Äôs a new term for a lot of us. It means rather than immediately eliminate a source of carbon, you just make up for it somewhere else. Meaning we still have air travel &amp; cheeseburgers but plant more trees.
Our oceans are dying and we need to lead a global effort to save them. That starts with leading on plastics, fisheries, climate, coral.
Battery storage is getting better and better, which means super small scale generation, which will mean clean electricity in developing nations.
Solar and wind are getting cheaper so fast that they are already cheaper than fossil energy in lots of parts of the country.
Rejoining Paris is not just symbolic, it gives us a seat at the global table as energy decisions are being made.  It will also help us to recover the moral leadership lost during this time.

@Philippeflap No thanks. I like business too! I just believe in appropriate regulation, government spending, a strong social safety net, protecting the vulnerable. As a start.
I‚Äôm not a socialist. But I believe that every American deserves health care. I also believe that college should be debt free, and that America must lead boldly on climate change. That doesn‚Äôt mean I want America to be Venezuela. It means I want America to be America.
@AnandWrites I agree with this. Most people (off twitter) just want to hear the moral and directional clarity and are not necessarily wedded to how the outcome is achieved. Whether it‚Äôs Medicaid, Medicare, something else - they just want to be personally, physically, financially secure.

Rest In Peace, @JohnDingell. A leader who believed in the power and the obligation of the legislative branch to improve the lives of Americans. May his memory, and his example be a blessing for all of us.
People complained about ‚Äúbaseload power‚Äù and about price, about Pacomm and about Waikiki. It was hard work, it got bumpy at times, and we are not nearly done, but given the success of Hawaii‚Äôs clean energy initiative, there‚Äôs no reason to be afraid of a clean energy future.
A couple of years ago the legislature made a law for 100 percent clean energy generation. Even the utility company likes it, because they are transforming. What I am saying is this can be done, and it must be done. Don‚Äôt be afraid. Be optimistic. America can figure this out.
Then, the same thing kept happening. Every time we raised the number, we kept exceeding the number! And prices went down, not up. So, now we‚Äôve got our local biz leaders loving it, selling it, and everyone‚Äôs bought in.
Something pretty incredible happened. We hit our targets. We exceeded our targets. The price of electricity went down, not up. We brought in investors, &amp; small businesses thrived. The building trades liked it. A lot. So, we got more ambitious, a plan with teeth, and bigger goal.
When Hawaii started its clean energy program in 1998 we had a weak but aspirational law to try to double clean energy. It was attacked by the utility and the biz community as too much too soon, and by green groups as too little. But, it was a start.

@billy_s98 That‚Äôs basically most people. And I‚Äôm not doing it.
The next President should not cheer when an American publication shuts down. The next President should know the difference between Medicare and Medicaid. The next President should have limited screen time.
Paul Ryan is still the Speaker of the House and they are out of session until Wednesday, with shutdown looming Friday. But, in his defense he IS (checks notes) working on getting more (checks notes again to make sure) people from Ireland into America. Seriously he is doing that.

@asmith83 An emolument is not only bribery. It‚Äôs actually any financial arrangement, including one at ‚Äúmarket‚Äù rate. The founders didn‚Äôt want any entanglements at all, not just the ones that were obviously corrupt. So even a legit business deal is constitutionally prohibited.

@nberlat I‚Äôm just confident we are going to nominate a progressive. But I‚Äôve been wrong lots of times.
7th, litmus tests are mostly stupid. That‚Äôs it for now.
6th, our grassroots donors enabled the DCCC and others to be competitive and ultimately win by expanding the playing field. That must continue.
5th, we had a successful formula in 2018 which was to run on policy (mostly healthcare) and against corruption. We should do that again.
4th, everyone who wants to run should run. Primaries can and do strengthen the Party. If you are a governor or a mayor or a senator or member of the house or TV star - and you think you can help the country, try it!
3rd, the progressive we nominate should also be capable of getting votes from moderates and even republicans. That wouldn‚Äôt make them less progressive, that would make them better.
2nd, we must reject the premise that this is a fight between moderates and progressives. We are going to nominate a progressive.

Update on both House and Senate races, and forgive me for oversimplifying.  Everything is crazy close. There will be a dozen races or more that could be decided by less than a percentage point, and some by a few hundred or few dozen votes. So please finish strong. Thanks.

These are called Junk Insurance Plans and to no ones surprise the trump people love them. This Wednesday, we Senate Democrats are forcing a vote to overturn this stupid rule allowing junk plans. Tammy Baldwin and all Senate D‚Äôs cosponsored the legislation.
The Trump administration is trying to use a loophole in the law - if a plan exists for less than a year, then patient protections are no longer required by law. In other words, if you have a plan w a duration of 364 days, it‚Äôs allowed to give you Garbage health insurance.
So part of how healthcare works is there are certain minimum standards for a healthcare plan - it‚Äôs gotta cover ER visits, pregnancy,   Athsma - there‚Äôs a long list of what they call Essential Health Benefits - a list of ways that insurance companies are not allowed to screw you.
Both sides are not making climate change worse. Both sides are not coming for your health care. Both sides are not making it harder for people to vote. Both sides didn‚Äôt vote for Betsy Devos. Both sides were not for that tax cut. Our side had to vote.
America always solves the big problems. We lead. And on this we are absolutely giving away our historical role. There‚Äôs only one way to fix this. We need Democrats and especially climate champions in office.  END.
Look. I can read a poll. I understand that climate change doesn‚Äôt necessarily, by itself, drive voters to the polls. But here‚Äôs the thing - it really should. Anyone who is planning on being on the planet after 2040 should be pretty pissed at inaction action from people in charge.
But we have a very specific problem. And it is this: the people who fund the Republican Party are primarily in the fossil fuel business, and they are in charge of the government. So we are stuck.
adapt to climate change, manage ecosystems. None of these are unproven strategies and they would benefit the vast majority of society.
moving away from perennial flooding and severe weather, creating humanitarian crises and instability. But here is the good news - climate change is actually not a thorny or complicated moral or policy issue. The solutions are - place a fee on carbon - incentives 4 renewables,
For ecosystems, frankly, some will crash. In the developing world where hundreds of millions of people live on coasts, and governments will not have the resources to harden shorelines and develop pumping systems, we will have tens of millions of people, some on foot,
For farmers, this likely means more droughts and more severe and unpredictable weather. For insurance companies it means 500 year storms happening annually. For fisheries it means just less fish. For ski resorts, some will manufacture snow for whole seasons.

And finally, his lies were just so obvious. And lying to the Senate is a crime. It is true that he was lying about stuff that made it feel silly. But the lies were so brazen and aggressive (not to mention illegal) that they are also disqualifying.
Second, the Judge was, plainly speaking, out of control in that hearing. It was wild, it was partisan, it was rude, and it‚Äôs hard to see how he can credible claim to be objective if any of the individuals or groups that have opposed him ever come before him in the future.
This is not a criminal proceeding and the Senate is not deciding whether or not to throw him in jail. We are deciding whether or not to give him a super powerful job for life. He gets fairness, but not an evidentiary standard as if his personal freedom is at stake. It is not.
The game that some R‚Äôs are running is that if, legally, there is reasonable doubt about the sexual assault allegations, then BK should be confirmed. That‚Äôs upside down.
Can you imagine having a case before the SCOTUS and being part of the progressive coalition that he screamed about during the hearing? The legitimacy of the Court itself is at stake.
Demonstrating explicitly rage or contempt for one political party is disqualifying.

One of the most essential roles for a President of the United States is to unite us when possible and provide moral leadership on how to be in a political fight without losing sight of our common cause and our common values.
Today, we remember the many heroes and neighbors lost in the 9-11 attacks. Seventeen years later, the courage and unity shown by so many on that fateful day still inspires us to come together, to serve, and to do something that‚Äôs bigger than ourselves.
I don‚Äôt subscribe to the ‚Äúadults in the room‚Äù but let‚Äôs be clear even if you do John Bolton is not one of them.
It probably doesn‚Äôt make sense for a coastal state such as Florida to send a full fledged climate denier to the Senate.

Fifth, he‚Äôs got a dangerous view of presidential power and immunity that seems to line up perfectly with the Presidents‚Äô expectation that his appointees are loyal to him rather than the country or the law.
Fourth, he‚Äôs got strange and offensive and retrograde views. For example he called Hawaiian programs ‚Äúracial spoils‚Äù and today seemed to describe the pill as an abortion causing drug.
Third, he seems like he‚Äôs about 99 percent likely to overturn Roe.
Second, we still are only in possession of less than 5 percent of the total records of his public service, which is totally ridiculous, unprecedented and insulting.
There are now multiple problems with the Kavanaugh nomination. First, we have at least two instances of the judge saying something that is plainly false while under oath.
Judge K is really out of the mainstream on almost every issue and is doing an ineffective job of hiding it. Also, it‚Äôs worth repeating: Judiciary Dems are kicking ass.

For most professionals the standard is that if you have an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict, you recuse. Do I have to get a fancy law degree to unlearn what is plain to see, that Kavanaugh should recuse himself on Trump criminal or civil matters?
Trump expects loyalty to him, not the constitution. He could have picked others, but only Kavanaugh believes that POTUS is pretty nearly above the law and should be left alone. Today when asked what changed for him since he was a vigorous Clinton investigator, he said "9-11."
Finally: Please feel free to trash or ignore my thoughts. It‚Äôs just Twitter I‚Äôm not trying to fight anyone in the comments. The main thing is we go out there and personally campaign, finish strong and peak in October and November. Thank you.
I am not a message guy so here‚Äôs my best shot: They are corrupt and ripping you off. They taking away your healthcare, ripped you off with the tax bill, and they are now targeting Medicare Medicaid and social security. I think corruption and how it impacts voters directly is key.
Sixth, we gotta welcome Non-Democrats into the coalition - not to determine the future of our Party, but to stand with us. There are principled conservative voters who are struggling with what to do this cycle, and we should welcome them into an alliance. Progressive/welcoming.
Fifth, whatever you are currently doing for the cause, pretty soon, it‚Äôs time to knock on doors and make phone calls.  We do not need a movement full of pundits and strategists - we need every single body on the street, including pundits and strategists.
Fourth, we have to, for the next 65 days, just not fight with each other if it can be avoided. Primaries are over, and everyone behaved pretty great, so let‚Äôs just be one team and we can have robust internal debates after the election. As Magic Johnson says ‚Äúit‚Äôs winning time.‚Äù
Third, we gotta ‚Äúrun into the fire‚Äù as it relates to the supposedly tough issues. People want moral clarity. That doesn‚Äôt mean that Conor Lambs district is the same as Harley Roudas but it does mean that looking fearful and sounding generic is rarely the path to victory.
Second, donors large and small need to spread money around, not just with the famous candidates. R‚Äôs invest at all levels, even obscure ones, and drag them across the finish line. Dems fall in love, R‚Äôs fall in line, as they say. We gotta cut that out. Every seat matters.
First, our candidates are great and they should be trusted. And consultants and strategists should not turn every candidate into a cookie cutter democrat. They have amazing stories, personalities, and personal characteristics. Let them shine.
We are now around two months from the most important midterm elections possibly ever. I want to offer some incomplete thoughts on what we might want to focus on.
I‚Äôve seen enough. I will vote no. As long as the republicans refuse to release 96 percent of the Kavanaugh records, this process is illegitimate. Every other SCOTUS nominee has turned over nearly everything, and I am now convinced they are hiding something.
Everyone following this debacle, here are two things you can do: 1) call your Senator 2) find a campaign and join it. Republicans will only stop behaving like this when it stops working for them. Elections. Have. Consequences.

There is only one way to get Congress to act like a co-equal branch of government. We have to win in November.
Between control over the schedule, subpoena power, and the power of the purse, and especially with the Senate divided 51-49, any Republican wanting to more than express reservations - to slow or stop the madness -could do so. This person would be an actual hero in my estimation.
R‚Äôs control the calendar as it relates to appointments. So if they wanted to push back on what Trump is doing, they could make life near impossible. This is one point of leverage - check of the legislative branch against executive power, but they are not using it at all.
R‚Äôs have chairmanships. That means only they can call hearings, subpoena witnesses, and dictate the terms of debate. This is normally used for oversight - to guide the administration and hold them accountable. Little to none of that is happening under total Republican control.

I also worry that we are misreading what China wants to do here. Of course they don‚Äôt want chaos on their border, but they probably don‚Äôt mind if we are, through or recklessness, fraying our friendships and alliances with South Korea, Japan, and others. They won‚Äôt bail us out.
No one wants to use the word ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù because it sounds insufficiently tough, but once DPRK could reach the US mainland, this is where we are. This is a bad approach. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs better than war on the Korean Peninsula.
The idea that we can intervene either diplomatically or militarily to get DPRK to change its mind about their nuclear program is based on a fantasy. Or worse, it‚Äôs being propagated who want diplomacy to fail in order to advocate for war.
The President‚Äôs overconfidence and lack of preparation may not backfire immediately, but it must be managed but the State Department team.
Denuclearization of North Korea is not at all realistic, so it‚Äôs essential that we go into these talks with reasonable expectations, and with great suspicion. Success, in my mind, would be a lack of gaffes or verbal hostility, and an agreement to keep talking.

@DavMicRot Yes, absolutely. We should do that too, and I‚Äôm working hard on a number of these fronts on the policy side. But being angry at what‚Äôs going on and wanting it to stop it is a perfectly powerful and legit reason to vote.
Don‚Äôt arm teachers. Don‚Äôt prosecute marijuana. Don‚Äôt rip off working people. Don‚Äôt increase the cost of healthcare. Don‚Äôt treat immigrants poorly. Don‚Äôt make climate change worse. Don‚Äôt be cruel to LGBTQ people. Don‚Äôt eliminate net neutrality. Don‚Äôt forget to register and vote.
@nbeaudrot @joshtpm sorry pocket tweet
I would like a lawyer to explain to me why that last tweet from POTUS is not a big deal, because it seems like maybe it‚Äôs a pretty big deal.
I used to think arming teachers was the stupidest idea until I heard about eliminating doors at schools.

This weekend, we join Hawaii in saying aloha to Senator Daniel K. Akaka. He was beloved by everyone in Hawaii, and by his colleagues DC. His effective work on behalf of veterans, Hawaiians, and the cause of peace will be remembered for generations. Aloha, Danny.

Caveats here: My bill is not done being drafter yet and this stuff is complex. Also I‚Äôm on a plane tweeting without my expert staff. 7/7
This creates a simple standard that Boards Of Directors can follow, and creates a level playing field between all companies, and is simple of customers to understand, because most of us get that lawyers and financial advisors and docs have to not use your info against you. 6/x
The basic idea is that the company, whether ISP or credit bureau or bank or website or app, should be required by law to put themselves in the shoes of the person whose data they possess and not use the data against them. 5/x
So while we should deal with ‚Äúnotice and consent‚Äù the bigger issue is: What relationship, legally, should the company have with the person? And whether it‚Äôs Comcast or FB or Equifax, I think the solution that a few academics are offering called an ‚Äúinformation fiduciary.‚Äù 4/x
But that‚Äôs not the main thing. The real thing is that when you do click ‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù whether you were fully informed or not, you have basically transacted your digital activity (if not arguably your identity) to the tech platform. And it‚Äôs done. That‚Äôs precipitous and unfair. 3/x
Of clicking ‚ÄúI do not agree‚Äù when the consequence is no transportation, no email, so social media, etc. So we for sure have to improve the notice and consent and create a plain language standard like people have with credit card offers. 2/x
In the online privacy debate there‚Äôs a lot of talk about ‚Äúnotice and consent‚Äù which basically addresses the problem of no one knowing what the heck they are agreeing to when they click ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù Plus it‚Äôs not like people feel like they really have the option 1/x

I just talked to a colleague who told me that phone calls were running 6,000 to 10 for #NetNeutrality. It is working.
