For those of you musing about Harry Reid's performance should see his son. The apple really didn't fall far from the tree. Bad gets worse.
Our govs, staff & donors worked extremelly hard to give us the resources necessary to compete against the DGA and labor unions. Thank you.
In 17 states we have spent more than 1 million dollars. In 9 states we have spent more than 3 million. 6 states more than 5 million.
We raised 31 million this quarter, 59 million for the year. 31.5 million cash on hand. No foreign money.
Our $raising # excites me. Especially b/c we didn't take foreign money. Will have numbers compiled soon (it's taking a while to add up).
Correction. DGA has now raised 27 million for the year (not 30). 10 of that 27 million came in the last quarter.
The DGA raised 10 million last quarter and 30 million for the year. Any guesses what we raised last quarter?

Rahm: "Lt. Gov Cherry you're not getting an ambassadorship for getting out of the race. But what about White House social secretary?"
Rahm: ‚ÄúGov Strickland everyone knows being the deputy at the Office of Faith Based Initiatives is a bigger deal than being gov of Ohio.‚Äù
Rahm: ‚ÄúGov Culver what about ambassador to the Philippines? Oh you don‚Äôt like managing floods. Excuse me? You can‚Äôt manage floods. Got it.‚Äù
Rahm: "Gov Ritter I promise as a diplomat you won‚Äôt have to balance a budget. Trust me, no one in DC balances a budget. You will love it."
CO, IA, WI, NY, MI. All Dem govs (or LGs), all states where Rahm trying to get them to not run.
Dem Lt. Gov Cherry dropping out of Govs race is clear signal their policies failed in Michigan and he knows dems will be held accountable

@nathandaschle guess you would have preferred the opposite for my trip to your home state: raise pheasants and shoot RGA donors? :-)
back from Gettysburg, SD where we did two important things in zero degree weather: raise money for RGA and kill lots of pheasants

Just landed in SD and it is zero degrees. For my GA blood this going to be painful.

The mood is not "anti-incumbent" in 2010. It is anti big-spender, big taxer, big deficit, big gov't. Stop confusing the two.
I watched Pac-man v Cotto last night. Great fight. Cannot wait to see Pacquiao v Mayweather. My bet is they fight Labor Day, 2010.
Flying to Austin, TX  for @the_RGA annual conference w/22 govs, 600 donors, and best of all 2 gov-elects. Will be there all week.

This week in 1993 the Star-Ledger in NJ publishes poll showing Dem Gov Florio getting reelected by double-digits. A week later, he lost.

back in DC from NYC w/@haleybarbour. Very successful fundraiser 4 @RGA. Donors really buying into GOP comeback begins w/the 39 govs races
My advice to Rory Reid: instead of running for gov of NV come run for mayor of DC - a place where your father still has some influence.
New poll in Jersey shows Christie 40%, Corzine 39%, Daggett 13%. For a Gov who spent 20 mil to still be under 40 means bad things.
