The fact is that when it comes to abortion — no matter if it’s early in pregnancy or later in pregnancy — these decisions should be made between the pregnant person and their doctor, not politicians. Period.
The constitutional right to access safe, legal abortion is under threat like never before, *even though* support for abortion is at an all-time high: https://t.co/UtLzOclVzl		Just shows how out-of-touch some politicians are. cc: @realdonaldtrump https://t.co/Op2Yy6MV3F
Making outlandish accusations about abortion that aren’t based on facts or medical science is right out of the anti-abortion playbook. It’s horrifying and offensive. And unfortunately, the President just used #SOTU to promote it.
For @realdonaldTrump to push misinformation and fake science on abortions later in pregnancy at the #SOTU shows that he’s willing to do and say anything to promote his anti-abortion agenda, which he has been pedaling since day 1 of his administration.

What Trump and other extremists continue to do is push lies and misinformation in an effort to ban all abortion, plain and simple. 		@realDonaldTrump and lawmakers in Virginia should stick to facts — and leave these hard medical decisions to women and their doctors. Period. 8/
This bill doesn’t change the circumstances under which a pregnant person can obtain an abortion later in pregnancy, it changes the burdensome requirement to access a termination. https://t.co/uadNEvXLX1 7/
For Trump — or anyone — to suggest that the proposed bill in VA would result in women ending pregnancies while in labor is absurd, and an insult to women and the physicians who care for them. 6/
A later pregnancy could put a woman’s health or life at grave risk. Currently, Virginia requires her to see *three separate doctors* to evaluate &amp; certify a termination is necessary. 		There’s no medical reason for that. It’s onerous and unnecessary. 5/
These are situations where women and doctors need every option possible, not restrictions by politicians who would tie doctors’ hands and shame women. 4/
Abortions later in pregnancy are rare. They often result from a diagnosis of severe fetal abnormalities, or serious risks to a pregnant person’s health. This woman’s story shows how painful these situations can be: https://t.co/vemE8vAo8D 3/

Since Trump took office, he’s worked tirelessly with administration officials &amp; anti-women’s health members of Congress to repeal the ACA and gut its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. 		But we’ve fought back against Trumpcare — and we’ve won every time.
Thanks to the ACA, health insurance companies:  	-Can’t refuse to provide coverage or can't charge more for people with pre-existing conditions;	-Can’t engage in gender rating; &amp;	-Can’t refuse to pay for "essential health benefits" for any pre-existing condition, ie pregnancy
The ACA provides critical protections for patients with health problems, including making it illegal for insurance companies to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.
Prior to the ACA, millions of women were denied coverage because of a range of health issues labeled as pre-existing conditions, including pregnancy, breast cancer, and irregular periods.
About 130 million nonelderly people have pre-existing conditions. Insurers have long used a person’s medical history as a way to charge them more for coverage or deny them coverage.
We can’t go back to the days where simply “being a woman” was considered a pre-existing condition. On Nov. 6, VOTE for candidates who will protect our health care, not attack it. #TakeItBack		How your health care is at stake: https://t.co/xh2XPUxrFF https://t.co/w3LS82awum

With health care being top of mind for voters this year, it's no wonder why Republican candidates are desperately trying to rewrite their record on health care. #TakeItBack #PinkOutTheVote https://t.co/6IvpwsBQvd
Since the ACA was passed in March 2010, Republican leadership has tried more than 70 times to take away people’s health care. 		And we've defeated these efforts every time.
Reminder: before the ACA, millions of women were denied coverage because of so-called “pre-existing conditions” like breast cancer, pregnancy, or domestic abuse. #ProtectOurCare

Senators, you have a responsibility. Do your job, do the right thing, vote NO on Brett Kavanaugh. #StopKavanaugh
Senators, make no mistake. If you vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, you are sending this message and perverting the Supreme Court: 		-Women &amp; survivors don’t matter	-Impartiality doesn’t matter	-Integrity &amp; honesty don’t matter		#StopKavanaugh
Brett Kavanaugh has misled the committee in his testimony countless times under oath.		Brett Kavanaugh has exposed his true character.		And he has no place on the Supreme Court whatsoever. #StopKavanaugh
Brett Kavanaugh was misleading, belligerent, and hyper-partisan, showing utter disrespect for senators when he was the one under questioning. Behavior like that has no place on the Supreme Court.
From his testimony about Roe v. Wade to his yearbook pages, Brett Kavanaugh has misled the @senjudiciary committee countless times under oath.
While GOP leadership has fast-tracked his confirmation without a full investigation of the allegations or calling upon others to testify, yesterday further proved Brett Kavanaugh is unfit to be a Supreme Court justice: https://t.co/6d3XR2JcZd
While sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh were enough to disqualify Kavanaugh, yesterday further proved he is unfit to be a Supreme Court justice. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/fhefzZ3PJa
While the fact that Kavanaugh has already blocked access to abortion &amp; birth control and would threaten access to affordable care was enough to disqualify Kavanaugh, yesterday further proved he is unfit to be a Supreme Court justice.
While the fact that Trump only nominated Kavanaugh because he would gut Roe v. Wade was enough to disqualify Kavanaugh, yesterday further proved he is unfit to be a Supreme Court justice.
If there is one thing you take away from yesterday’s hearing, it’s this: Brett Kavanaugh is no Supreme Court Justice. #StopKavanaugh

The public is watching. Senators, make no mistake: the blatant disrespect of a sexual assault survivor will not go unnoticed. We #BelieveChristine.
Dr. Blasey Ford does not need a panel of Senators to validate her experience — she is not on trial. Rather, this is a moment of reckoning for senators. Do you listen to survivors or not?
Survivors don't choose to become survivors, and no survivor (nor their families) should be met with threats of violence for courageously speaking their truths.
We stand with and believe Dr. Blasey Ford. Period. #BelieveChristine #StopKavanaugh
Dr. Blasey Ford is caring for her family in the face of threats of violence, death threats, &amp; hate mail she received for sharing her story. She deserves an FBI investigation first, not an “interrogation by Senators who appear to have made up their minds.” #BelieveChristine https://t.co/g0lCxQTiMw

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford did not have to come forward. She has bravely brought forward a specific and documented account of sexual violence by Brett Kavanaugh, and she must be heard and treated with respect.
