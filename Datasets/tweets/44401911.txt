Stocks down 500. Steel tariffs could wreck NAFTA talks. That would be calamitous.
About 154m Americans who work. Steel &amp; aluminum workers just over 200K. That's 0,13% of labor force. Many, many are steel users. So we're taxing users, while protecting steel-makers.

@Brian_Riedl @MCat7189X @KevinNR Higher growth adds to income to finance all that. Plus no one has ever found significant link to deficits &amp; rates. Look at current story.
@KevinNR Because our growth deficit is long run. 20 years after Reagan's supply-side tax cuts, budget in surplus.
@ericowensdc Only way to reduce deficits is strong growth. Fed spending only 20% of GDP. But GDP is $3 tr below trend. Lower income, higher deficits.

So many folks jumping on @PressSec Sean Spicer. They shouldn't. Mistakes happen. He apologized. Known him long time. Smart.Savvy.Good guy.
@DebsFriends @POTUS @MorningsMaria @CNBC Absolutely. Great lady.
Thinking out loud: ave US state &amp; local sales tax (applied to imports) is 6.5%.Why not negotiate Mexico 16% VAT down to 6.5% for US imports?
@PTM0505 Yup!!
But, talking down dollar by saying it's too high is not good. Strong, stable #KingDollar inspires confidence. Price stability. Pro-growth.
This is very good. Fact-based decision not to label China a currency manipulator. They are, however, unfair traders. https://t.co/At7cy1wVuJ
@miksong @POTUS @MariaBartiromo I think match VATS. But I confess not sure.
BTW, Maria's interview w/ @POTUS @MorningsMaria really superb. Covers lot of ground. Well worth read. Lots info.
@DonLuskin Agree.
@IamJohnGaltBook Yup. Big mistake.
@72guard @vcutrader Agree.
@Sandman6_2 @MariaBartiromo @POTUS On specific items, tariffs best remedy until problem solved. Trade enforcement good. Just don't like blanket tariffs.
I will agree that reciprocal better than BAT. But why not seek lower taxes (tariffs) for everyone? Break down barriers best for growth.
Perhaps @POTUS telling @MariaBartiromo no BAT, but reciprocal. Will we calculate 167 countries? Will we score state &amp; local sales tax?
Disturbing @MariaBartiromo interview @POTUS . "I love the idea of reciprocal (tax)." US state &amp; local taxes apply to imports. Up to 8-9%.
Reminder from John Taylor @EconomicsOne : Take off muzzle &amp; econ will roar. Note productivity chart. https://t.co/XsJ3Ibwxkz

@Sandman6_2 My point exactly.
@ToddRozycki Whatever you think of them, they are elected in our democracy. Also, using CBO &amp; JTC has done no good for econ or budget or deficits.
My bottom line on all these rules: time for change. Stop hamstringing Congress w/ bad accounting. CBO, JTC, not elected. Congress must work.
@yonibak @JudgeNGorsuch If they do, then they can change rules too. They were first to break filibuster.
@greg_ip Their record on dynamic growth scoring just as bad as CBO. Keep scoring capgains tax cut as rev loss, while always rev gain. Need shake-up.
Dynamic scoring of corp tax cut gets 3% growth &amp; $3 trillion deficit reduction over 10. CBO should look at history. GOP not buy into CBO.

Bottom line: just get bill passed today. Shovel brigade will clean up later. House defeat will leave OB-Care in place forever. Want that? No

Some conservative friends blaming @POTUS. Nonsense. He's done yeoman's work to save vote. Hands on negotiation. Art of deal. Deserves credit
Any improved House bill will do. Yea vote not new law. Just gets it over to Senate. Don't kill all reform w/ nay vote. Huge political error.

So many of us wanted tax cuts first. Still do. Or graft on to reconciliation. Still can do. Need new senate parliamentarian. And bold GOP.
In Nashville, @POTUS talked a lot about tax cuts. Preferred them first, but had to do AHCA first. Don't know why?  But good on tax cuts.

@ehalliday07 @federalreserve Nope.
@davischip94 No. Let velocity rise on its own. Healthy for growth. Don't need excess money.
@debbies3360 @GOP @NewYorkSun OK.
Oh by the way, need new Senate parliamentarian to use reconciliation to the max. Technically, simple biz tax reform graft to AHCA is OK.
Will @SpeakerRyan permit amendment votes, especially @freedomcaucus ? Hope so.
13 tax repeals in AHCA. Pro-growth. Better health care. Unite @GOP. @NewYorkSun https://t.co/cmvU2zqEdK
