@BradbuCraig No-I think both the Republican and Democrat parties are corrupt and we must vote out all the bad actors.
@azcentral Sounds like business as usual.
@RepJayapal @TiaBruhn Lloyd and people like him are why law enforcement continues to be subject to continued scrutiny and sometimes criminal conduct.
I was wrong- Miller from West Virginia is as dumb as Higgins from Louisiana. Neither are listening to the testimony and make biased comments to support their political agenda.
I am embarrassed to say I was a Republican for 42 years after observing the Republicans on the House Oversight Committee today.

@dannowicki @lilyalta AZ schools spend less on their students than any other state and are rated #44th in country for quality of education.
@orangestreetnew @Ninjas53 I‚Äôve been a cop for 32 years and cannot believe how many unqualified people become cops. The difference btw good and poor PDs is unconscionable.

@ellievan65 Trump just makes this shit up and the Republicans are dumb enough to believe him.
Trump and his band of career criminals-I predicted this 1.5 years ago. What amazes me is how his supporters (the Hurd) are so blind to his corruption and criminality. Really-how can people be that blind.
@LaurieRoberts @azcentral Yes
@ndrew_lawrence @miagl11 I am so tired of ‚Äústupid‚Äù
@azcentral I remember that night-I was working in Maryvale precinct that night.
@azcentral It‚Äôs a disgrace that federal employees have worked without pay for more than a month and the Trump administration and Congress are so dysfunctional they cannot resolve differences without hurting the Americans people.
I wrote 3 years ago that if America didn‚Äôt wake up to the corruption of Congress and White House working for special interest groups, lobbyists, big business profits and banking exploitation, the economic strength of America will deteriorate and the middle class will collapse.
@azcentral Typical conduct for the corrupt GOP. I left the GOP after 42 years because they have become unethical, corrupt and incompetent. The Democrats aren‚Äôt much better, but for now they are at least trying to do the right thing.
@DogginTrump I was in first grade when President Kennedy was murdered.
@LaurieRoberts @azcentral AZ spends the least amount of money on students than any other state in America. Why? AZ Politicians say education is a priority but no substantive improvement has occurred.
@LaurieRoberts @dougducey @azcentral This is why Arizona continues to be rated in the bottom 5 for quality of education for the last 6 decades. Special interest groups control AZ.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @trish_regan @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness I will be running for Congressional District 5-AZ in 2020 and can assure all I can get it done.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @trish_regan @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness Yeah- it‚Äôs dangerous, Border Patrol made 6 terrorist arrests in 6 months. Quit lying about the border, stop the shutdown and create responsible immigration reform. Scare tactics are for the foolish.
@NatashaBertrand @CountyFaulkner When police departments are controlled by politicians and not the rule of law, the only outcome is corruption and a self-serving agenda.
@NatashaBertrand @CountyFaulkner I was a cop for 32 years and the action by the officer is unsettling. Police departments have reduced the standard for new hires resulting in lower performance and higher incidents of misconduct.
@PhilipRucker @joncoopertweets Trump operates at a whole different level of ignorance.

@noprezzie2012 @michaelschweitz @Ninjas53 @realDonaldTrump I understand what you are saying, but the threat to our democracy lies in America‚Äòs inability to act justly when corruption prevails.

@roberttcu12 @CNNPolitics Second, you make arrangements with the County attorney, AG, ICE to prosecute the bad guys and not deport them prior to the preliminary hearing-a common practice. Convict then deport unless the crime requires a lengthy prison sentence.
@roberttcu12 @CNNPolitics First, you take out the bad guys (cartel and organized crime) - the community cannot feel safe, and cannot thrive unless the threat is removed.
@roberttcu12 @CNNPolitics Community, police and judicial branch must work together, set aside their bias, and create a viable response that remains within the guidelines of law and civil rights.
@roberttcu12 @CNNPolitics 68% of my precinct, with a population of more than 300,000, was Hispanic. We fixed it within a year and a half. It‚Äôs bias that stops immigration reform.
@roberttcu12 @CNNPolitics They Can‚Äôt fix it because their bias prevent them from coming to a rational conclusion.
@DoraWil31925690 When are Americans going to realize Trump has no idea what he is doing-re: tariffs, immigration, tax, ACA, social security, diplomacy, education, etc.

@AZSenateDems @LelaAlstonAz My observation of AZ politicians is people who provide sound solutions to AZ problems suffer retaliation and exclusion if they don‚Äôt belong to the ‚Äúin crowd.‚Äù Time to grow up AZ.
@AZSenateDems @LelaAlstonAz AZ has maintained its status for worst (bottom 3) public schools in America for 6 decades-its time to change our rating. Similarly, AZ maintains the same poor ratings for mental health care. AZ native and resident for 60 years.
@mendezforaz @AZSenateDems This means AZ is fed up with AZ government and tired of AZ executive governance.

@SenSanders The reason there are so many books on leadership is there are so many shitty leaders.
@SenSanders Senator, we both know that men like Trump, and there are many like him, will only pick people who will submissively placate to his will.
@abc15 Arizona‚Äôs must realize their apathy toward AZ politicians has resulted in mediocrity in government and placement of unqualified elected officials to important positions that effect all of us.

@Comey I have been warning LE for 10 years of what is transpiring in Washington-the politicalizing of LE. So many cops want 4 stars-doing the tight thing is optional.
@tndp Dems need to clean up their house, generate a sustainable platform and remove the corruption that has overcome Congress.
@JoeNBC Trump reminds of a ghetto rat with money. There is no honor or integrity.
@CREWcrew Why is that not surprising
@samswey The Nazis were also responsible for the deaths of more than 17 million men, women and children.
@adegrandpre @maggieNYT @SariHorwitz That is a false statement by Sessions!
@CREWcrew No one is dirtier than Big Pharma
@ChristynRoyce The time to impeach Trump is now.
After watching ‚ÄúMudbound‚Äù we are still an uncivilized nation-although we are better at hiding the ugly truth.
America we must mitigate the corruption of Congress by voting into office people who have integrity and live honorable lives-we must become more involved.
@guardian Good-look at FinCEN reports, Big Pharma is a frequent flyer for fraud, fraud schemes and money laundering.
@amconmag Congress wouldn‚Äôt know what a responsible budget looks like even if it bit them in the ass. There is so much wasteful spending and no accountability.
RT @thedailybeast: EXCLUSIVE: Trump‚Äôs team bypassed the Dept. of Homeland Security analysts to produce a bogus terror report, @attackerman‚Ä¶
@thehill Maybe Congress should pass each bill individually so they can‚Äôt play their childish games in Bill packaging.
@lawfareblog @SabrinaMcCubbin Good, the sooner we get this band of misfits out of the WH the better!
@azcentral That‚Äôs inside
Listening to Reps and Senators reminds me of interrogating suspects-they make shit up to rationalize their behavior.
@DirkSchwenk A sea of Blue
Although we are overwhelmed with the corruption and incompetence of Washington, similarities exist in state, county and municipalities government.
RT @AnneStegen: #womensMarch in Prescott, Arizona. Happening right now around the Yavapai County Courthouse #12News https://t.co/bz04ULVFtp
@thehill We Americans are sick and tired of Washington corruption.
Politics and leadership are two different characteristics. Unfortunately we only have politicians in Washington.
Insanity has now become the rule of government!
The GOP just sealed their fate for the next decade. Dems will control Senate &amp; House because of Republican incompetence &amp; corruption.
@CREWcrew Sure he did-Trump has no moral conscience and is driven by self interest only. The fact he is president demonstrates America delusion.
@azcentral @LaurieRoberts Absurd
@RepVeasey @funder They couldn‚Äôt lead Boy Scouts across the park.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ There‚Äôs no excuse for Republican and Democrats- it‚Äôs called incompetence! America is tired of the BS.
@SenJohnMcCain You guys need to figure it out and get the job done!
@SethAbramson Absurd-cite Bannon and Hicks for contempt and hold them until they answer.
@lisamurkowski House and Senate-get your shit together and do your job. If you worked for me I would fire all your sorry asses-oh you work for Citizens!
@azcentral Excellent!
@kylegriffin1 You don‚Äôt-you write OPS after conducting extensive research and staffing it with experts before presenting it for approval.
@thehill Come on fellas you can‚Äôt pick and choose the questions you want to answer. House Intelligence needs to take control.
@thehill We are facing an ethical crisis in our country-we must remove corrupt Senators and House representatives (Republican &amp; Democrats).
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Varneyco @FoxBusiness We don‚Äôt need a wall - just fair-equitable-and consistent enforcement. I was in charge of worse precinct in AZ-lowered crime by 30 percent
@HuffPost Give em hell Booker
@lisamurkowski Treatment is always the best strategy for community restoration. Strict enforcement most often divides and inhibits restoration.
@12News Sure he does, he doesn‚Äôt not want to confront the substantive issues relating to AZ education and how AZ rates lowest in U.S.
@JoyAnnReid Maybe because they are corrupt and don‚Äôt care about anyone‚Äôs interests except theirs.
@ACLU Restorative justice
FinCEN is an excellent investigative group, but they are only scratching the surface-3.2 trillion loss in USA from fraud -money laundering
The Russian attack against U.S. is textbook from ‚ÄúUnrestricted War‚Äù and CIA and FBI were way behind the ball on this.
The Apostle Paul said ‚Äúfor the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil. ‚Äú
It is beyond my comprehension how people and GOP continue to support Trump in view of the open corruption of this administration.
@CREWcrew He will never get his story straight because he is a habitual liar.
@SethAbramson This sickness is called corruption and it is destroying our country.
@ReutersPolitics The last time I checked these multinational corporations have stashed more than 2 trillion in overseas and offshore accounts.
@azcentral Let‚Äôs hope that doesn‚Äôt happen!
@jaketapper @3onyourside Embarrassing
@samstein This is what happens when you appoint unqualified people to executive positions based on cronyism.
Thank you Republicans-I left the party after 42 years because your conduct and corruption is unpardonable and most likely criminal.
@kylegriffin1 Please don‚Äôt
@HuffPost That would be another AZ disaster.
@SenSanders Yes we are sick of the corruption in our government.
@LaurieRoberts @azcentral I hope so, AZ has been rated one of worst for education and mental health care in US for the last 6 decades.
@azcentral @realDonaldTrump Like...Trump is both corrupt and incompetent
@SenSanders War on Drugs should target profit not product, which would destabilize Cartels. Prob- Mex govt complicit. Rehab American addicts
@SethAbramson People believe what they want to believe and facts and evidence are irrelevant.
@kurteichenwald @thinkprogress Special interest and self interest control the House &amp; Senate-the hell with the American people and doing the right thing.
@NormEisen This is what happens when politicians appoint Directors &amp; Chiefs in LE to push their agenda. LE becomes complicit to retain their power.
@TrueFactsStated Good-tired of this BS
@johnlundin I think we are all sick and tired of Trump &amp; ‚Äúcorrupt band of Republican brothers‚Äù who are interfering and hindering criminal investigations
@Sal_DiCiccio If you rock the boat, even when city management is clearly wrong, they push you out. Poor leadership and lack of fiscal responsibility.
@Franklin_Graham What an awesome man-great article.
@Sal_DiCiccio As Maryvale precinct commander I had to pay Parks &amp; Rec $85k a year for grounds maintenance when I could have paid only $15k. Nonsense!
@lisamurkowski The states and Feds need to be on the same page. Stupid decision by Sessions-worst drug effecting crime, murder and society is alcohol.
@eugenegu @DrDenaGrayson Those of us in law enforcement know that alcohol is by far the worst drug responsible for crimes, murder, death and civic disruption.
@PreetBharara I agree with you Bharara, but politicians across America continue to subvert LE to satisfy their own interests and agendas.
@MAGAisaLie @washingtonpost True
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP I say put Jung Un &amp; Trump in a cage and let them fight it out. Oh yeah Trump was too much a coward to serve in Vietnam.
Many of us have been greatly concerned of how politicians have infiltrated the judicial branch and LE have reciprocated to gain benefits.
@washingtonpost In my research, Pharma is one of the most corrupt industries in America. Look at FinCen reports and court findings.
@SallyQYates Trump is the evolving degradation of power, corruption and politics in America. If you look closely there are many like him.
@Forbes Amen - wrestled from grade school through college.
@CREWcrew Kinda like the fox guarding the ‚Äúhen house ‚Äú
@JoyAnnReid We teach capitalistic Christianity in America not servitude
You alter street crimes by changing the environment, but corruption is embedded in many of our institutions (banks, securities, medical, etc
I have always had a tough on crime approach, but the crimes most effecting USA are corporate and white collar crime.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @FoxNews @HappeningNow @JonScottFNC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump As one of your constituents, I do not agree with your approach to derail the Trump investigation. Men like you will destroy this nation.
@thehill It‚Äôs about time-it doesn‚Äôt take much insight or discernment to determine Trump &amp; crew motives.
@thehill Good at least some people out there are thinking rationally.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @USATODAY @POTUS @realDonaldTrump No, it is men like you who are willing to disregard our legal system for gain that will ultimately destroy our nation.
@azcentral Well done
@azcentral Read PEW report on widening of gap between rich and poor. Law Enforcement, regulatory agencies, and state and federal gov‚Äôt have failed.
@Jake_Bernstein Trump‚Äôs concept of loyalty is post-fascism.
@JeffFlake Yes, thank you for standing firmly against those who have lost their way believing power is illegitimate domination and control of others.
@prchovanec Trump‚Äôs sense of loyalty is anarchy and entitlement at the expense of all others.
@NormEisen You would think but the GOP has set aside the rule of law to protect their Party.
@thehill Politicians have devolved to primal instinctive behavior centered on self gains and immediate gratification. We must relieve them from duty
@JohnBrennan @selectedwisdom @realDonaldTrump @FBIAgentsAssoc The tactics by Trump &amp; cadres is reflective of white collar criminal trailer trash. These men could never work 4 FBI- too corrupt-no morals
@thehill They should
@DeadlineWH @Evan_McMullin @NicolleDWallace I think the Republican Party will be an outsider for the next decade. I was a Republican for 42 years and yesterday I became a Democrat.
@kylegriffin1 What a waste of time and money to reopen this investigation.
@RepSwalwell Thank God they passed the tax bill!
@kurteichenwald SOX followed Steagal and had little effect on Great Recession. Corruption is built into business model - look at FinCen filings.
@azcentral Pay for AZ teachers has always been the lowest in country. AZ needs to address its priorities.
@RWPUSA I just left the Republican Party after 42 years. I just cannot support them any longer.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @marthamaccallum @FoxNews @RepMattGaetz Your a tool Biggs, open up that very narrow mind.
@Tim_Walz Our Congress and Senate don‚Äôt care a certainly not competent to perform this task.
@RFreeba @RWPUSA From a strategic point you may be right but I don‚Äôt think it will matter.
@tribelaw @RBReich Although capitalism works in free-markets, it‚Äôs fundamental pillars begin w exploitation of workers, the environment and consumers.
@RWPUSA The Independent Party should consider ramping up efforts to recruit members. I think a lot of people are tired of Republican and Democrats
@GoldmanSachs @lloydblankfein Goldman Sachs‚Äô has long history of unethical and illegal actions by violating fraud provisions and defrauding their investors. SEC v GS 2010
@ACLU Video was disturbing-I don‚Äôt believe use of deadly force was warranted. Police are driven by culture of violence-must be addressed.
@JoeNBC I guess the Republican Party is hell-bent on decimating itself.  They remind me of piranha-once out of food they consume each other.
@jswatz @maggieNYT @MikeIsaac Corporate crime is rampant in US and no one is investigating these crimes. Costs US trillions.
@kurteichenwald It‚Äôs a no-brained, but we have too many in DC who can‚Äôt tell their ass from a hole in the ground.
@chrislhayes Words can‚Äôt express the corruption and arrogance of Trump administration. Next we‚Äôl burn books, re-write textbooks, and have an inquisition
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan @POTUS If necessary get District Courts involved.
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Congress has to make a stand to ensure the investigation is not impeded in any way. The future of our country depends on it.
@LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I have been dealing with death, murder and killing for 40 years and nothing good comes from it.
@LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Your out of your mind Graham-apparently you have never seen combat and ignore the atrocities of war!
@thehill Leave Walter Mitty alone- he has his own world to live in.
@thehill No, we need a responsible Congress &amp; Senate to create a budget that covers costs, and doesn‚Äôt fill the pockets of special interest.
@LouiseMensch @FBI Politicians don‚Äôt understand we can be fired for lying. Hell, there wouldn‚Äôt be any politicians left if they played by the same rules.
@LouiseMensch @FBI Most of us cops believe politicians exist at the bottom of the gene pool and if they are talking they are most likely lying.
@thehill Welcome to the Congress and Senate Fraternity club
@SenFeinstein Politics is dirty business filled with dirty actors, and have always been the least trusted public servants in U.S. in any poll.
Congrats to ppl of Alabama for overcoming the corruption of their state government
@JeffFlake The indecent and abhorrent behavior of the Republican Party will result in the disruption and eventual destruction of Party.
@SenFeinstein What can we do to stop this insanity?
@thehill Not in a good way
@davidaxelrod @POTUS The dumbing-down of America worked.
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS What did you expect-they‚Äôre ‚Äúdirty‚Äù
I would run for Congress, but not qualified. I passed the MMPI, lie detector, served honorably as  cop &amp; marine 40 years, and no mistress
@funder Bravo
@thehill Don‚Äôt bother
@Monicaw67 @TeresaPezzino @missparker_n @NBCNightlyNews @MaddowBlog @RichardEngel You couldn‚Äôt be more wrong-I served as a Marine and cop for 40 years-I was the first to respond. Nothing honorable about killing others
@SouthPaugh1 @NBCNightlyNews @MaddowBlog @RichardEngel Your right but no sense in stirring the pot.
@tribelaw You can‚Äôt fix stupid
@RexNutting Insane isn‚Äôt it-thanks Rex
@NBCNightlyNews @MaddowBlog @RichardEngel This is what happens when you have a president who has no idea what he is doing. I wonder how many will die from his reckless behavior.
@RWPUSA Congress and Senate are out of control.
@RexNutting The tax rate in Ireland is 8 percent and last I researched Apple owes about $60 billion.
@SenJohnMcCain Sir did you read the material I dropped off at your office 8 months ago. It is very relevant for today.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @cvpayne @FoxBusiness The FBI are saints compared to Congress. I have never been so appalled by the GOP as I am today, and have been a Republican for 42 years.
I am quite perplexed by the degree of corruption and unethical conduct occurring in our congress and Senate.
@Sal_DiCiccio Investment in outside developers is a short term fix and rarely works, and often is Phoenix response to major problems. Need wiser leaders
@Sal_DiCiccio Improve and maintain education and critical services, reduce crime, and developers will come. Otherwise you have the cart b4 the horse.
@PhRMA PhRMA fraud costs Americans 3/4 trillion annually.
@PhRMA Congress is deaf, dumb and blind toward PhRMA fraud-have been for decades.
@CREWcrew They call that coercion
@washingtonpost The police chiefs should be taking the lead on this issue.
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump How can you be so blind-having eyes they cannot see and ears they cannot hear.
I have been a Republican for 42 years and am embarrassed by my party. They have become a band of elitist tyrants unfit for public service
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Not feeling represented by Congress-I live in Gilbert and am a Republican. Grow a pair Biggs.
Apathy is born of unresolved conflict, which in time breeds frustration and anger. Americans are angry because they can‚Äôt fix congress.
@tribelaw We have to get rid of this class of misfits. I am appalled and annoyed by their actions.
@AynRandPaulRyan How do these idiots get into office and who are the idiots that vote them in. Worse, why are we paying for settlements.
@funder The Oscar goes to Pence who lied and concealed all things related to presidential corruption and criminal conduct.
America fails to evolve because we can‚Äôt detect truth (hive mentality) and persecute those who can. Trump &amp; team corrupt, yet ppl support
I hope Americans take notice on the depth of deprivation our political system has become. Trump &amp; team are criminals who rose to power.
@DalyPolitics @JoyAnnReid Very true
@JoyAnnReid These are pathetic little insecure men who desperately crave power and control of others.
I have been a Republican for 40 years and unless the party pulls its head out of their ass, Congress and Senate will become a Sea of Blue
@chrislhayes You‚Äôre too kind toward the banking industry. My research on the great recession reveals intrinsic corruption
@CREWcrew I don‚Äôt know how Trump is still in office. Too many Cowards in Washington.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ It is a grave mistake to increase our debt by $1.4 trillion
How do you loose 11 trillion?
The GAO reported 11 trillion vanished  from our economy.
Most Americans have no idea how the bankers &amp; regulators were criminally instrumental in Great Recession of 2008. We need Dodd-Frank!
@JoeNBC I could round up some 8th graders and create a better budget than what we are looking at.
@RonaldKlain They don‚Äôt need an Ethics lawyer now, but I hope their criminal lawyers are good.
@Sal_DiCiccio I didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary or Trump. Thot Hillary was corrupt and Trump incompetent. Was wrong Trump is both incompetent and corrupt.
@JeffFlake Thank you for your courage and ethical standards
@USAMilitaryUSA @BSkylstad Semper Fi
@burdergrl @RepAndyBiggsAZ I will
@tribelaw Corporate, white collar and organized crime costs 3.2Trillion annually, whereas UCR I crime is 14 billion.
@tribelaw Most chiefs have no idea on how to reduce crime and continue to use 60 y/o models rather than evolve towards progressive policing.
@tribelaw Although street crime is aggregious, they are only a nuisance compared to corporate, white collar and organized crime.
@washingtonpost It looks like they should be required to take a few science classes instead of operating out of ignorance and greed.
@LindseyCollom @azcentral I have never been impressed by Phoenix city council - lots of poor decisions often based on meeting the need of few or privileged.
@AmberBowenSF @Khanoisseur On vacation but will provide info in week - in my 2nd book- Tim
@RonBrownstein You can‚Äôt fix stupid
@SethAbramson Sessions reminds me of 1000s of suspects I have interviewed: not my pants, not my dope, those can‚Äôt b my prints and I don‚Äôt recall.
@thehill Apparently ethics no longer exist in some evangelical platforms.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ AZ was rated the worst in US for overall care of mental illness by MHA in 2015, and suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for 15-34 Y/O
@thehill Isn‚Äôt it interesting how often religious zealots are the most unchristian who are full of lies, deceit and secrets.
@kylegriffin1 I was a cop for 32 years and loved my work, but many cops are so narrow-minded their ears touch.
@CREWcrew The only thing good about Trump winning the election is that it has woke up America who were blind to the corruption and incompetence of DC
The fact that ppl continue to support Trump demonstrates the distorted power of bias and prejudice. Very disturbing and disappointing.
@renato_mariotti Beware of those who protest too much.
@thehill Thank you Senator McCain - at least someone in DC is doing their job!
@thehill That news appears to violate all code of ethics and conflict of interest parameters
@SenFeinstein What else is new-the middle class have borne the burden of government for decades. Incomptence &amp; corruption
@Khanoisseur Sexual predators and prostitution are 2 unrelated topics. U.S. studies reveal violent crime increases 45-60 percent when prostitution thrive
@Leslie67915456 @nytimes @NewYorkTimesGHS @CNN I was a cop for 32 years and believe me I can recognize fake news from real numbers.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Men like you validate crime and corruption to protect the party. People like you will cause the downfall of the Republican Party.
@thehill This bill is the highest standard of moral and political incompetence!
@nytimes It is difficult to comprehend the willful blindness of those who continue to endorse Moore. Most disturbing.
@washingtonpost I‚Äôve investigated Catholic priest during the 80s for child molestation, and believe me the Catholic Bishops usually get their way.
@SenJohnMcCain Semper Fi!

@JeffFlake Thank you for your courage and ethical conscience- we don‚Äôt observe that much these days.
@TheRickWilson Amen
@Sal_DiCiccio It is the blind leading the blind; every study on light rail shows a financial loss for cities investing in them. There is no ROI.
@RWPUSA I thought about running for public office or Congress, but I would be disqualified because I passed MMPI and lie detector tests

@RVAwonk Republicans have lost their spines and certainly their ethics. I have been a registered Republican for42 years and am embarrassed.
@TheRickWilson Trump is the trophy of piss-poor leadership throughout the US.
@RWPUSA Sorry I put the wrong info on annual Medicare and Medicaid fraud-it is $500 billion. Those most guilty of fraud is the medical industry.
@RWPUSA Many issues effecting affordability of med care is criminal related- Medicaid/Medicare fraud is 1/2 B yearly &amp; pharma fraud I $ trillion
@TrueFactsStated @SenatorCollins Been a Republican 4 42 years-have never observed this many incompetence and unethical congressmen and senators - time 2 switch party
