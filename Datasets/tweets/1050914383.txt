@ericswalwell Adorable!
@ananavarro Congratulations!
@khloekardashian All i can say is i wish you and your daughter well. You're my favorite k and i was superb happy when i heard that you were having a child.  Just remember now, you're a mother  and role model for your daughter.  Whatever you do, she's going to model you.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ohh i can sense that you are so bothered by his testimony. Ha dt jr😁😁
@bennyjohnson Hey can you make the same list of all things Donald Trump have knowingly lie about? Ha!!!
@Diddy Super proud of you for stepping up and being both parents.  I never for once doubt your ability to do this.👍👍👍👍
@piersmorgan I guess the photo up turn @piersmorgan from being her biggest critic to her number one cheerleader.  Huh... interesting.
@AOC So cute! At least my week ended with a smile!
@piersmorgan @AOC Fuck off.  You're not American.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You're more obsessed about him then going to prison for lying about your Russian meeting in trump tower for dirt on Hillary clinton.
Ha! I don't think vote is necessary for that. https://t.co/pkDdaJNrQU
@piersmorgan @ArianaGrande I guess that's the attention you wanted now you get it . I think i need to be rude to a celebrity to get that attention.
@BernieSanders I love me some Bernie Sanders 😘👍👍👍
@khloekardashian Well my darling  try to trim it a little  cus many of us look at you like a normal girl among all  of your sisters.
@tedcruz while millions of others kids can't, all because of your party family separation policy! Shame on you. I hope your kids suffer one of these days, just as much as those kids who you have putting into caves. and also all others  who think families separation is acceptable.
@KimKardashian You're getting too old to still be doing this girl.
@realDonaldTrump Yes you're the joker of the world little boy Donald!
@SenSchumer @nbcsnl At least you have a sense of humor about it unlike our child like occupant in the white house. Donald Trump can take it.  Went off all day today.
Something might has gotten under his skin again to go this low. https://t.co/CTosalQFZ6
@DonaldJTrumpJr @KamalaHarris Are you kidding me ? Your father invented lies and hatred.
@TheView Obligation is the word that get me. But then again, it depends on the family members we're talking about here. Kids yes, mother yes. everyone else nope.
@piersmorgan Your body is ugly and fat
@DonaldJTrumpJr Mr jr, your dad invented lies. So please be quiet and find a place to go hide.
@TheEllenShow @TheEllen You're just so sweet and beautiful in and out. 💖💖💖💖
@SarahKSilverman I love Sarah Silverman.  Her humor is hilarious. 😄😄😄
@piersmorgan @piersmorgan this us the USA.  We've something call freedom of speech.  You moron.
@piersmorgan You're just mad @piersmorgan that the face of the royal family is going to look different.  Not all white.
@piersmorgan I don't know why @piersmorgan you're popular or on tv. Cus you don't have the physical appearance non good attitude.  Always fighting with guests on good morning Britain. Oh forget, you're white.
@Michael_E_Timms @MeghanMcCain @kenklippenstein Well she's replying in a sense, she's famous because of her daddy name. With a empty head and loud mouth talking nonsense.
@kenklippenstein @MeghanMcCain I ask the same question with her talking loud mouth.

@MeghanMcCain She put a smile on my face without knowing her. Her spirit looks kind and gentle. 💖💖💖💖💖👍
@realDonaldTrump and you look like spray tan AkA the orange man.
@MeghanMcCain Oh because he doing a great job for Americans, no mention of his religion, but in any other instances, that would have been the first headline a Muslim blah blah blah...
@soledadobrien She's a joke even on the view.  Her answer always starts like this,  i can speak for my family as part of government then try to turn everything around.  Oh forget she's from fox news.

@piersmorgan @piersmorgan you have to be a black person to understand what it feels like to be hunted like a animal by your fellow human being who thinks they're inferior then you.
@CharlesMBlow I'm 100% in agreement with you.
@piersmorgan Yes @piersmorgan , you're racist and very rude towards Meghan. You Always make racist  whistleblower comments when it come to Meghan.  Remember her wedding remark about the black preacher 😠 did that ring a bell? Just leaving her the hell alone.
@piersmorgan You're very stupid @piersmorgan !
@SarahKSilverman Netanyahu is a criminal and a murderer. Jewish people in general are good and decent people. We people of all races, religious and background need to speak again Netanyahu atrocities towards the Palestinians people's.
