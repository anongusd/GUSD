I dream of a day when we dont feel compelled to sprinkle issues with race in order to add sizzle. Problems and issues have no colors.
@Toure @forewit likely Im mor familiar with the trenches,violence than some imagine a world where we focuson solutions nstead talkingpoints?
I find it very discouraging to still see so much uncivil discourse. What ever happened to #civility is the convict the only guy noticing?
For those of u with questions feel free to ask and for those who have been supportive, my most sincere gratitude.
However I still firmly believe good can come from bad and I refuse to be defined by only the wrong I have done. Lots of good left to do!
Also, to anyone disappointed or let down in regards to my incarceration, my apologies, sincerely...
Since I have been gone quite some time I feel compelled to once again implore everyone to check out the @180movie it is life changing.
@aaronspencer599 I'll call tomorrow, btw the big show, which of course is me dropped 85 pounds up there, its tough being indigent lol
@aaronspencer599 That's perfect because I will be up that way frequently dropping tobacco off lol.  Ur number still the same? Ill call 2mrow
@aaronspencer599 Bro, I am sure you would love these all new all black 2 straps I got from the state. Btw, Mosley sends his best.
I'm finally back after what felt like a very long year. I'm looking forward to reconnecting to many of you.  God bless!
I implore everyone to #pray for the families of the innocent victims Sandy Hook Elem. Abolutely devastating and senseless.  Pray now.
We will never have an election that will change the fact that #America is and will always be the greatest nation in the world!
I #pray for our President and his family and our nation. I respect our President! We may not often agree but he is our President.

this election is not about #mormon or #baptist or #muslim etc...they will try to mislead us. The election is about the Presidents failure.
Please dont allow the media to create division among our #faith they will try to turn us all on each other. Dont let them!

The biggest thing we should take away from todays voting. Time to take #RickSantorum seriously.
We truly should be celebrating. We r so very blessed to have the very capable candidates that we have. #GOP

@SolutionsTdy Actually and factually he has nothing hidden. We r all aware he has money in a multitude of accounts.
Instead of being mean-spirited about each others candidates. I propose we celebrate the freedom we r blessed with to choose.
Michelle #Bachmann is a lovely person.  She is a #Patriot. We r so very blessed to have such a process to help decide our leaders.
Im still supporting #Mitt and will continue. However I love and respect all of our candidates. Great job to Team #Santorum

#God wants u to forgive urself. #Christ died on the cross so that u would not have to carry shame. Let it go, he already has. #forgiveness
I believe not forgiving urself is prideful. Think about it. R u held to a different standard to #God? Of course not. #pride
Please remind urself or someone u know that #Christ loves u and he forgave u. Isnt it time u forgave urself? #Forgiveness
@lolasblest Thank u for the RT Ms Snyder. I just dont think as a man u can get any cooler than Mr Clint Eastwood.

@eddieroyal19 He is worthy of consideration but u and I both know its #Elway. Go #Broncos. Cant wait to see u guys here next year.
@pjwells2009 U continue to amaze me. I love having u in my life 4 a number of reasons. Especially for ur good faith in me. Thanks!
Huge mistake by #Bradshaw and the #Giants.
I hate #Brady and the #Pats but giving him 20 seconds might as well be 5 minutes. U have to respect #Brady.
To clear up any misconceptions. I am a #Christ loving Christian saved by #grace. However, I am still a man.

@pjwells2009 Im very pleased u would know without hesitation u r 1 of those that I just adore and love interacting with.
Hope everyone is enjoying a great game. Btw, @politicsofamy is a very charming young lady. And that is an official quote.

If we dont put #Christ first then #Mitt or #Newt or #Obama really dont matter.
I wish to apologize to everyone if at any time I appear to be more dedicated to a candidate than my #faith.
I absolutely hate #pride. Sadly I battle daily with mine. Fortunately #Christ never leaves me to battle alone.
Many suffering from #addiction feel to ashamed to ask for help. We as #Christians must help remove that shame.

Very good and strong speech given by #Mitt and clearly the most inspired crowd I have seen him with.
As Brit Hume says regarding #Newt "for a guy to rise twice he had to fall twice". This is far from over.

What other reason is there for the hostile treatment #Tebow is given by commentators?
To hear the tv guys tell it #Tebow cant tie his shoes. I truly believe it is the enemy, the devil that is working so hard to see him fail.

@StevenErtelt Ive been with Romney since '08 so I may be a bit bias but I think Romney won tonite. Although Newt looked great.
@secupp Agree, I think Romney will see a boost from this and Perry will likely see a small drop. Its still their show.
@noellenikpour Conservative women, like urself give me great optimism for our future and in particular my future. Ur an amazing role model.
@ThadMcCotter Thank u Mr. McCotter, I respect u even more now. Bush was/is a great man. No need to distance ourselves from him.

@RealSkipBayless Skip please speak of the legitimacy of the Fighting Irish now. They are 4-1 could easily be 5-0 and will beat usc the 17th.

And for anyone who has not seen or read "Wuthering Heights", shame on you. A beautiful yet tragic love story. Great book and great movie.
@KayteeScarlett Just for clarity. I was the important phone call, right? I truly enjoyed our talk. I'm throwing together another email 4 u.
@KayteeScarlett I have to run back to the hardware store. I don't have wireless there yet. I look forward to talking with you later.

@KayteeScarlett I hope you're having a wonderful day. Let me know if you have time for a phone call this evening. I'm glad I met you.
@KayteeScarlett Please forgive me. I am very busy with the hardware store today. I hope to be open by Sept. 8th. So much left to do.

@KayteeScarlett Oh yeah, I am not a copy-cat. I address that in the email. Black is my favorite color. A staple in my wardrobe, black.

@KayteeScarlett The truth is, I'm a bit afraid that Diamond Dave will not understand and maybe never forgive me? lol
@KayteeScarlett You should feel so very special. What other person could ever get me lay down my arms in the DLR or Hagar fight?
@KayteeScarlett I applaud your ability to take the high road. I too will join you on the high road. We can both have our own separate favs.
@KayteeScarlett Work can be such a bummer sometimes. I have decided to take the rest of the day off, so I'll be around when u get done.
A side-note, I think more people should be praying for Michael Beasly right now instead of making news of his problems.
@KayteeScarlett I'm very torn between doing what is right or doing what is right for Diamond Dave.  I'm so very upset right now.
@KayteeScarlett Compromise? Diamond Dave would never forgive me if I compromised. I'd be compromising all that I believe in. lol
@KayteeScarlett sammy hagar over Diamond David Lee Roth? Please tell me that you were joking. I love Diamond Dave.
@KayteeScarlett I'm already working on my reply. I see only 1 problem for us, but it's a big problem.
@KayteeScarlett Now if only I can crack to top 5 of some other categories. However, I am very pleased with "most interesting".
@KayteeScarlett I'd have to say of all the interesting things going on in your life right now, certainly I must be the most interesting.
I have already called an end to my day. I have a long week ahead and I'm just not feeling it today, so I quit. Only for today.
I'm going to bed. I have a very long day and week ahead. Goodnite @kayteescarlett you are the top of the list now!
@ShaneCarwin November 21st! I cannot wait! Myself and so many others are waiting for you to stop lesnar. We're counting on you. U will win!
@KayteeScarlett Do you really like George Michael? Or are you messing with me? Shepherd pie, George Michael, you may be perfect.
Who is jim rice to be talking down Derek Jeter? Derek Jeter is a champion, a leader, and a class act. Jim Rice should apologize.
@KayteeScarlett And how very kind of you to dismiss my Captain Creepo title. Thank you and I am of course joking about the creepo thing.
@KayteeScarlett And of course I am not perfect.  I listen to and enjoy, still, George Michael.  How about that?
@KayteeScarlett I can easily look past the M. Cyrus thing because of the shepherds pie, no problem.
@KayteeScarlett I suppose I can tell you now that Captain Creepo(me) has already responded to your response. I hope you enjoy.
@KayteeScarlett Wow, you are now safely in the top spot. Thank you for your response. I truly enjoyed it.
I bet J Smoltz is feeling pretty good about himself and bet the redsox are feeling pretty bad about the decision. Good for Smoltz.
@KayteeScarlett You continue to race towards the top spot in my cyber-heart. I mean shepherds pie, really? You are amazing.
@RWZombie I cannot wait. Looks to be every bit as good as the previous you made and it was fantastic.You have yet to dissappoint with film!
@KayteeScarlett I love Shepherds pie, if it is the shepherd pie that I know. Mashed pot, peas, meat, cheese, and some other stuff? Love it!
@madconservative Quite possibly my favorite pic you have posted, very nice.
RT ConNewsHackers shut down Air America. However it took two weeks before anyone realized it. #TCOT  That's funny.
I think everyone should be following @jsclagg the guy is some sort of genius, a prophet maybe. I follow him proudly.
On a serious note, he seems to be so happy to have a good home and my nieces just love him and he loves the attention.
@KayteeScarlett All the other dogs at school are going to make fun of him.
@KayteeScarlett He doesn't seem to mind so far, but as he gets older and starts dating he is going to hate me. lol  Tu-Tu, that's funny.
Yes, I have a dog, a male dog named Tu-Tu. How very creative and cruel by my nieces.  Tu-Tu?
I got a dog and I let my nieces ages 3 and 8 name "him". Please keep in mind my new dog is a boy. We(they) decided to name him, Tu-Tu.
Oh, I haven't mentioned it in a while. tom ridge, you should be ashamed. Good luck selling your tell-all rubbish memoir.
I feel very good about Notre Dame football this year. J. Clausen possible Heisman candidate and a certain BCS birth. Finally a good year.
@KayteeScarlett I assure you that this one looks as good as the other. He did a great job with the first one. I love scary movies.
@KayteeScarlett That was a horrid scene. What about the Halloween movie, any interest in seeing that?
I'm also a bit interested in "The Final Destination". I have enjoyed the others and this one looks like it could be very good.
I enjoy scary movies and must say I am very much anticipating the new Rob Zombie Halloween movie. Previews look great.
@andrewbreitbart Are you inferring that he has ever stopped bashing the Bush admin and the GOP? Probably not an old episode. lol
@KayteeScarlett The familiarity thing makes sense. Let him and that familiarity be your springboard back into dating.
@KayteeScarlett People love and care about you and want you protected from hurt, but there is no protection from hurt. So just have fun.
Seriously, how great was "Jaws"? It's on right now and I am reminded of how great it was. "We're gonna need a bigger boat."
@KayteeScarlett You owe it to yourself to enjoy life to the fullest. I call up a ladyfriend from my past too from time to time.
I just bought my 2 little nieces Conair "quick beads", it beads their hair quick and easy. They now think I walk on water, lol. Great kids.
@KayteeScarlett Oh, and of course I am happy that I make you "feel alive". You were talking to me, right? lol
@KayteeScarlett You seem to be doing very well. I'm pleased you are enjoying your life, more people should follow your lead.
@RealSkipBayless Any chance you agree this could very well be a great, break out season for Jimmy Clausen. Heisman talk, maybe?
@RealSkipBayless Also, it is big of you to take Tebow over Bradford, you being a Sooner and all. Bradford is a great qb also. Tebow is best.
@RealSkipBayless I have never agreed with you more Skip. Kiper is wrong. Tebow will be an early 1st round pick, very early.
One last time and I will let it go for the nite. Shame on you, tom ridge and your terror alert rubbish. Anything to get a book deal, shame.
I also think more people should be talking about the genious that is Ruben Amaro Jr. and his signing of Cy Young winner Cliff Lee.
For those that are curious, I have absolutely zero respect for tom ridge. He should be ashamed of himself.
I hope the reason no one is talking about what a turn-coat sellout that tom ridge is, is because he isn't worth it. He isnt, I'm just mad.
Benedict "tom ridge", let it go, and I don't believe you nor will I buy your book. I had hoped you were better than this, gossip!
I loved the "American Pie" remix on Limbaugh today. After all these years and Rush is still the best, no question.
My Phils trade for Cliff Lee may be one of the best baseball decisions in years. He is 3-0 not giving up more than a single run in a game.
@RealSkipBayless I will take Charlie Ward over Tebow on the basketball court though, not a football field.
@RealSkipBayless Well said in regards to Ward, but I'd take him over Young as well, Tebows leadership is unparalleld.
@SportsNation I love and miss Shanahan, but 1 playoff win in a decade means change is necessary. Keep working it McDaniel, change away!
RT @JonHenke: Somebody should document all who said Obama/Joker poster was racist, so we can let them all know they're racebaiting a**holes.
@billromanowski My point, with Lean1 as an aid people r noticing positive results already, just 2 weeks. Thanks Romo.
@billromanowski Romo, I've been using Lean1 for about 2 weeks now, love it. With weight training also others r already noticing my results.
Racism is terrible and inexusable, always. Shame on the ignorant racist, but be careful using such a word.
I believe people should be held accountable for using such a word if it is not warranted. It is shameful do abuse that word.
I feel such anger and even hurt when people call us(Republicans) racist. It should be intolerable to throw that word around with such ease.
I believe calling someone a racist unwarranted is equally as bad as using racial slurs.
I am growing so very tired of being a "bigot" or "racist" because of POLICY differences. Republican does not interpret racist.
Forgive me for my nausea in regards to all things brett favre. I'm not impressed with him or his lack of professionalism. Shame on the vikes
@madconservative My dad uses accu-check, I will make sure he is aware and makes the switch. Thanks for all the knowledge.
I encourage all to check out www.defendglenn.com  I believe we are past due in pushing back against the bullies of the left.
@madconservative Men's Warehouse will be a tough one to boycott for me, but this is about principal and I will not shop there again.
@madconservative I'm certain I am late getting on board, but I am boycotting the Beck boycotters. C @madconservative for the list.
@KayteeScarlett Speaking from experience...No, a divorce party is not a good idea, it's a great idea! It is also mandatory.
@VictorConte They are irresponsibly wasting tax dollars and the last years of his HOF career. This was a witchhunt and irresponsible.
@rogerclemens We baseball fans sure miss you making October exciting. Please don't listen to the few, listen to the many. U r the best ever.
I have to say, if it were any other athlete Tigers choke today would be all I'd hear. I think he is getting a pass? I like Tiger, but 2day?
Very happy with the new Mad Men season only 30 minutes in. I love use of the "it's my birthday" line, a true classic like the show.
Today was a great service at church. I truly am so very blessed. I can't speak for everyone, but I believe most of us are if we want to be.
Touchdown Broncos!  Great start to the 2nd half.  Maybe C. Simms should be the starting QB? I'm all for it.
However, the Broncos defense has created 3 sacks in the 1st half. That is a bit promising.
I know it's just pre-season, but K. Orton throwing 3 1st half picks is bad news to me and any other Broncons fan. Very nervous.
I am asking for his name because as a gentleman I would like to challenge him to a duel on PPV with proceeds going to charity.
It also goes without saying the guy has absolutely NO answers, only insults. That is what the left is down to, only insults.
Who was the liberal A--hole on O'reilly tonite, former biden writer? How very rude is he everytime he is on. Typical liberal, angry + rude.
@KayteeScarlett I could not agree more about pitt or the movie. I was very surprised by the movie. I'm not too proud to admit I cried.
Florida principal, athletic director face six months in jail over mealtime prayer http://tinyurl.com/kpeaff  Thanks Madcons...a must read!
@madconservative Thank you so much for posting that Wash Times article.  I implore all to read that article.
@madconservative Not often I disagree with you, and I don't love Geraldo, but I do enjoy some of his work, esp. the OK child molester case.
This is my 1st chance to applaud the Eagles for signing Vick and giving a deserving man a 2nd chance. Good luck to both.
@RealSkipBayless For people like myself and many others, the fairytale part of the Rocky story is what made it a great story.
@terrellowens I do have to admit it is funny that Rome would dare trash your show while wishing he had your ratings! lol
@terrellowens I'm a Broncos fan, but truly respect you as an athlete. I don't know how you take it. The haters need to leave you alone!
@KayteeScarlett Well I still think you need time to be lazy. Watch E.T. and eat reese pieces. Then Tylenol PM it for the nite.
@KayteeScarlett Based on that last statement I assume the packing has to do with the split? You are in my thoughts and prayers.
@Vickielvico I totally agree, Frasier is completely timeless.  Easily 1 of my top 5 tv shows ever.
Pedro looked very good in his first game back.  I keep feeling better and better about another championship for The Phillies!
@KayteeScarlett I'm sorry to hear your sick, total bummer. You should be totally lazy and eat junk food and watch movies.  Dr's orders.
I do believe it to be totally reasonable and important for a guy to take care of his skin.
I just bought and tried Neutrogena "at home microdermabrasion system" and I must admit it worked well. I am quite surprised at how well.

@lyotomachidafw I'd have to say I would gladly purchase a pay-per-view with a A. Silva versus L. Machida match, as would many others!
@RealSkipBayless Skip, it should be about statistics and TO certainly has the stats. Give TO a break. I expect a great season from him.
The Yankees are looking great and clearly the team to beat in AL, but my Phils are still the Champs, still the team to beat.
@KayteeScarlett I was starting to miss you.  I had a great weekend and I'm hoping you had a wonderful weekend as well.
http://patriotupdate.com/stories/read/608  BO's Kenyan birth certificate?  Interesting article with photos.
Another great performance from BJ Penn.  I figured he would have stopped Florian earlier than 3:54 in the 4th round, but a wins a win.
WOW! Silva proves once again that he is the best pound for pound fighter in the world. He simply toyed with and destroyed Griffin.
Allow me to introduce NFL Rookie of the year 2009-Knowshon Moreno, he will lead my Broncos and the NFL with over 1700 rushing yards.
"No Apology:The Case for American Greatness"  What a fantastic and fitting title for Mitt Romneys new book due out in 2010. A must read!
@markdkelly2 A great point.  The constant hypocrisy of the left leaves me nauseous.  Resignations would be demanded from Bush WH.
We can all be certain that BO would never appoint a moderate judge so let's work with what we have and move forward.
I also believe if we would have made much of a fuss they could have forced a far more liberal judge onto us, forced it.
I have given this great thought. I will not bash the Repubs that voted to confirm sotomayor. She isn't any worse than who she replaces.
@KayteeScarlett I had a great time. I am still trying to recover from it. Florida is just beautiful with so much to do. Thanks for asking.
I am back from Florida with much to say, for now I will just say I've missed you all.  I'm going to bed for a few "days".  Goodnite.
@KayteeScarlett I should add that I am pleased to see such a positive take on things to come.  August is going to be your month.
@KayteeScarlett I have safely returned from your lovely state. Thanks for allowing me to visit. Via your last tweets u seem very optimistic.
@KayteeScarlett Fabulous?  I'm sure you are referring to a break from my barrage of tweets.  lol  Goodnite twitter pal
@KayteeScarlett I will say this then give you a break from my barrage.  I grand-open all of them.  I'll VIP u, family, friends. Promise fun.
@KayteeScarlett I meant to say nite club never to be confused with nite clube and restaurant.
Cadillac Ranch.  It's restaurant by day and nite clube by nite.  Already in a bunch of cities.  I'm confident you will enjoy.
@KayteeScarlett And of course, your town, J'ville is great.  We'll be opening a restaurant there next spring.  Love J'ville.
@KayteeScarlett Ft. Lauderdale/Miami for a few days.  I desperately need to get away for a few days.  I love Florida, it's beautiful.
What a glorious day!  I leave for FLA tomorrow so there will be little from me for a few days.  Goodnite.  The Real jsclagg, no ghostwriter.
@KayteeScarlett I'm telling you this with the confidence you will tell no one, ever?  I, a 31yo man, read and enjoyed twilight. I'm ashamed.
@KayteeScarlett THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL right now is very BAD.  I could just SCREAM.
@KayteeScarlett As if I didn't feel BAD enough, I should start with THE MAN IN THE MIRROR and let my poor taste BEAT IT.
I'll pontificate further.  Notre Dame football will win 10 to 11 games this year and be in National Title hunt.  J. Clausen maybe Heisman.
Great news for a Phillies fan like myself.  The Cliff Lee deal just ensures another world title.  Great job Ruben Amaro Jr.
An addendum to that last post, just a joke.  I've had a great day in court and feeling a little silly.  The real jsclagg, no ghost writer.
I wish to silence all of the gossip right now.  I do not have a ghost writer.  Let's all move on and put this behind us. The real @ jsclagg
@KayteeScarlett I truly hated to put that up because I love MJ.  But he'd understand and laugh, right?  Again, it was poor taste. I feel bad
This is in very poor taste and has 2 angles, I'm sorry.  "Bedtime Stories"  by Michael Jackson.  Terrible taste, I'm sorry!#cancelledbooks
"Me and my dawgs" Short stories by Mike Vick. #cancelledbooks  I should be honest and state my pride in creating this also.
"Life, A F**king Goldmine" by Rod Blagojevich #cancelledbooks  Come to think of it, I'm quite proud of this one also.
"Gun Safety for Dummies" by plaxico burress with foreword by Dick Cheney #cancelledbooks  Well, I'm fairly proud of this one also.
"On The Porch With Your Momma" by Prof Gates #cancelledbooks  I had to put this up again.  I am so very proud of this one.
Great interview on Greta with "The Austrian Oak" Gov. Schwarzenegger.  I still love Arnie, a great "California" Republican.
@KayteeScarlett Also, I'm not a stalker but did check out your myspace photos and being the son of a photographer, I'm very impressed.
@KayteeScarlett I hate to sound so very egomaniacal, but I have to say I had myself rolling at how funny and clever I can be.  Lol
I am pleased to report my day in court(not as a judge, juror, or lawyer) went very well.  I love Ohio.
I should add before I go to sleep that my #cancelledbooks titles are clearly some of the best.  I'm just sayin'.
I'll be in court all day tomorrow.  Sadly, it's not because I am a judge, juror, or lawyer so let's hope for the best.

"As an integral part of the Eagles family, Jim epitomized the traits of what a great coach should be—a teacher, a leader, and a winner"
As a football fan I am truly saddened by the loss of Jim Johnson.  An outstanding defensive mind and great leader.
@KarlRove The parting sotomayor jab was great.  I'm convinced she'd do better than an old, white guy like O'reilly.  Joke.
@SportsNation I have forced longtime friends to storm out from my non-stop trash talk over our Madden championships.  I love it.
I'm feeling really down.  The whole reggie and kim breaking up thing has me very upset.  Remember guys, "Love will find a way".  So sad.
I caught Tosh.0 on comedy central earlier and I feel obligated to encourage people to watch it.  Very funny stuff, I'm just sayin'.
@madconservative As i stated earlier, I have reported to the AP that BO is an alien.  I hope that takes the heat off Lou.
@nansen Welcome to Ohio.
I'm curious if there is a chance obama is an alien, it would explain alot including "no birth certificate".
The undercard match is Hannity vs maddow, queensbury rules.  Early odds have maddow a slight favorite at 3to2.  Should be a great fight.
A loser quits match between Oreilly and olberman.  Rules are simple, fight until the death.  Current Vegas odds have Oreilly a 10to1 to win.
@RealSkipBayless 1 more thing, honestly please, do you truly believe that Charlie Hustle the player, would lose a game on purpose?
@RealSkipBayless Naive?  I still think the HOF should not have a morality clause.  The statistics make the case for Pete Rose, HOF worthy.
@RealSkipBayless Phils are World Champs without Halladay, 1st place without Halladay.  Love to have hime, but can win without him.
@RealSkipBayless Well I am happy to say we can agree about the roids.  They were trying to compete, to be the best.  I'm fine with that.
@RealSkipBayless Just a refresher, career 303 avg., 2,165 runs, and ob% of 375.  HOF numbers.  Statistically a must for the HOF.
@RealSkipBayless Skip, I agree that betting on your team, or games he didn't is bad.  However, his player stats r no question HOF #'s.
I'm a Broncos fan and I would be fully supportive of Denver signing Vick.  Vick still has potential.
@RealSkipBayless I sorta agree, however I firmly believe Pete Rose, Barry Bonds, and Roger Clemens all belong in HOF, no question.
Great news for baseball fans.  Bud Selig is considering a reinstatement of Pete Rose.  Pete Rose must be in the HOF.
@TheRevAl I could not agree with you more.  That is, if you are implying that nothing good will come from the meeting.
@KayteeScarlett I enjoy your posts.  Don't feel lonely.  Did you finally see harry potter, via stalking or just the theatre?
I still believe Goodell was too hard on Vick.  Vick has already missed 2 seasons while serving an 18 month prison sentence.
The Healing Place is in several states and communities and continues to grow with great results.  Again, I encourage all to take a look.

@andrewbreitbart Great story.  An added thank you because I never knew how to spell "cockamamie".  Great use of the word.

http://bit.ly/o0bHA	  The President Reagan 1984 D-Day speach.  I love this one.  Such dignity and class.
@madconservative I love seeing the Reagan quotes.  We as a party would do good to remember him more often.  1 of my favs is 84 D-Day speech.
I just watched and even enjoyed "Confessions of a Shopaholic".  I feel obligated to state that I did watch it with a ladyfriend, not alone.
@RealSkipBayless I used to defend afraud.  I simply cannot anymore.  He will never be a leader like D. Jeter, never.
@RealSkipBayless Well said.  That's just too funny.  And it is a bit odd that no one else finds the umps love of attn strange.
I'm pleased to see the 3rd person speaking, stolen base king Ricky Henderson inducted into the HOF today.  Well deserved.
@KayteeScarlett Yes I have. Sadly for me, I have been caught nearly every time I acted on it.  Still happens though, few regrets.
What is the polite and appropriate way to stop following someone?  And, do they know that you stopped following?  Thanks, Joshua
I'm going to go ahead and state that Tony Stewart "will" win the Brickyard 400 at Indy tomorrow.
@mkhammer No way, I'm with my best friend and both sets of our parents have been married 38 years.  How strange?
I love liberals like Littman on O'reilly tonite.  He was so rude, petty, and very condescending.
@Americanwoman00 I watched that segment also.  I was pleased with his statements and he was completely correct.
I find Jaun Williams to be one of the more fair and balanced contributors to Fox News.  I just like the guy.
@SportsNation Best in baseball?  Try 2nd best in AL and Phillies are the World Champs, still the team to beat in MLB.
@SN_Rankings Tebow has to be 1st, best leader and competitor in FBS.  Also what about J. Clausen this year?  He'll be Quinn-like this year!
I hope the reports are wrong.  Goodell should not punish Vick further.  Reinstate him and let him make a living.  He paid for his crimes.

The guy is and outstanding police officer, and stupid.  Well said Mr. President, well said.  Amazing that he is never wrong or misspeaks.
I'm sorry, I overstated earlier.  BO is not in the top 42.  I believe that to be a fair and balanced perspective.
I won't say BO is the worst President ever, but he is not in the top 40.
Is it just me?  Why does it seem so very trendy to be a liberal?  It's cool to be conservative.  I'm just sayin'.
Vikings should kill the favre talk and look into picking up Vick.  Vick fits into their offense fairly well.  Favre is done.

Who will replace Barnett and fight Fedor on Aug 1st?  Brett Rogers maybe?  I just don't see anyone beating Fedor anytime soon.
"I have the best health care in the world."  And every American deserves "good" or not too terribly bad health care but not the best.
I think BO should have entrance music for his press conferences.  Maybe "smoke gets in your eyes".  The press corps adores him.
I love seeing Dennis Miller every week on O'Reilly.  I think Fox and Miller need to work out a deal for a show.  Millertime all the time.
Is it wrong that I'd truly enjoy punching chris mattews in the face multiple times?  If it is wrong then I'd only do it for charity.
I am still a bit amazed that very few are talking about the birth certificate.  Transparency Mr President, you said transparency.
BO will be the reason for a "huge" swing back to the right in the coming elections.  I've never seen a more arrogant President.
I mean no disrespect but, I have never ever heard a Pres sound more like a 13-year old "it's not my fault" "it's his fault!"  Well Said.
@RealSkipBayless I try to defend Lebron at times.  That was simply indefensible, like Jordan Crawfords dunk.  Lol.
Is Mitt Romney on twitter?
@RealSkipBayless The best thing he could have done was let it run its course, laugh about it, applaud Jordan Crawford. It wasn't a big deal.
People chose Tom Watson over Sly Stallone as the better older man.  Are they serious?  Sly Stallone wins, no contest.
johnboehnerIf Democrats “rescued” the economy, where are the jobs? http://is.gd/1HODZ-Well said John Boehner.  U make Ohio proud.
How funny is Step-bothers?  I love their job interviews.
I have another.  Who wins?  Me and O'reilly versus barney frank and olberman in a street fight, for charity of course.
Oh, I have at least 1 more.  Me and Rupert Murdoch versus ted turner and jane fonda and anderson cooper in a 3 on 2 handicap match?
Ok, seriously.  Me and Dana Perino versus robert gibbs and rahm emanuel in a last person standing match for charity of course.
Who would win, me and Sarah Palin versus olberman and maddow.  Queensberry rules of course and for charity.  I'm just sayin'.
Maybe a better match would be me and O'reilly versus olberman and mattews in a no holds barred match for charity of course.  I'm just sayin.
I thought The Hangover was non-stop laugh out loud funny from start to finish.  I'd encourage anyone to see it.  Seriously, non-stop.
For charity of course, but me, keith olberman, chris mattews, bill maher, and rachel maddow in a steel cage match, winner takes all.
How about my Phillies winning their 10th in a row.  Who needs Roy Halladay?
@eastonellis I'm looking forward to Imperial Bedrooms.  Loved Lunar Park and the return of Patrick Bateman.  Thank you for Bateman.
And Mike Vick, I'm a Broncos fan so I never cared about him, but he deserves immediate reinstatement.  He paid for his crimes.
A couple sports related things, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, and Pete Rose all belong in the HOF.  The HOF will mean nothing without them.
Ben Stein was right, we'd all be in trouble if our private conversations were recorded.  I dont wish to be on the record thinking I'm not.
I'm starting to like Glenn Beck less and less.  He bashed Nixon and Bush and wants a 3rd party.  I want the Republican party to expand.
@ConservativeGal Great post!  I would love to see everyone talking about this, now!  We deserve to have some answers.

@KarlRove Any chance you will promise us that you will lead our next candidate to the presidency in 2012?
"let us make a vow to our dead. Let us show them by our actions that we understand what they died for."-Reagan loved our veterans.
Allow me to state again, to all.  Take a moment and read and pass this speech along so that others can remember or know of it.  Thanks.
http://bit.ly/B8AmV	  I think this is a must read.  Reagan was great.
Great news, because of my vast experience(I've bought 8 cars in my life).  I will replace Ron Bloom as the car czar.  Thanks Mr President.
@pbateman Bateman, what you need to ask yourself is this.  Does the Hollister model appreciate Huey Lewis and the News?  Then decide.
I have to return some videotapes.  Goodnite all, even the liberals.
@DanaPerino Well said.  I remember a President that made unpoplular decisions for the greater good, this president is not.
@NDHFC Coach, allow me to go on the record.  I'm seeing 13 wins, a heisman, and a national championship.  It's going to be a great season.
@michaelirvin88 Mike, come on.  Holley?  I'm already calling Pat Bowlen and telling him to sign Hawkins.  Great show though.  A 2nd season?
@RealSkipBayless This almost sounds like you are preparing to change your mind about the Phils outscoring any NL team?
I don't like this attack on the always respectful Karl Rove about the BO stuff.  The guy has always been respectful even in descent.
For those that don't know, that last post was a reference to American Psycho...I just love the movie in all of its absurdity.
I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn my supposed fiance keeps buzzing in my ear.
@billromanowski Romo, we Bronco fans miss you.  Can Denver turn it around without Shanahan? Cutler? Maybe Marshall?
I'm growing tired of hearing the Phils must have Halladay.  They don't.  They are the world champs without him and continue to play well.
@KayteeScarlett I agree.  The abuse of the welfare system is outrageous.  We should help any in need but not for life unless necessary.
@RealSkipBayless Skip, that is a stretch.  The Phils can outscore anyone in the NL and their pitching is coming around.  Well managed also.

@ShaneCarwin I'm looking very forward to your handling of Brock Lesnar.  The entire mma community is counting on you.
I have a tough time deciding the better crime solver.  Matlock or the lady from Murder She Wrote?  Maybe a tie for the best?
1 more thing.  How great is Ari Gold on Entourage?  I have to say I think he carries the show.
@MarkSanford Adversity creates opportunity.  I too have made mistakes as have most others.  Lean on God and move forward.
@RealSkipBayless Skip, I just think it's important that you know you are not alone.  prince james has proven little thus far, not a king.
So I just watched E.T. again for the 1st time in 20 years.  Yes, I teared up.  What a wonderful and well made family friendly film.
@KayteeScarlett it appears as though the test was a success.
I just spoke with the president and he assured me that he would introduce me as his newest csar this week.  Csar of watching paint dry.
ConservativeGal, sadly a person like letterman will never do the right thing.  He has no moral character and no class and not funny.
"Only a life lived for others is a life worth living"-Albert Einstein  I could not have said it better myself.  Well said Al, well said.
10 dys til less politically correct twitters fly frm my fingertps outside State site-says Gov Palin.  I'm looking very forward to those.
I am pleased to annouce that the state of Ohio, my state, is proudly moving back to the right.  We have great candidates here.  Go Kasich!
Great news again!  Tomorrow Pres. Obama will introduce me as his new csar.  The csar of destroying capitalism.  He just hates capitalism.
I have my fingers crossed that the democrats will listen to the non-partisan CBO and realize BO's health care plan will cost too much!
Ariana Vitarelli, "Ariforlife" give me a great deal of hope for the future of our party and our country.  I'll gladly follow Ariana.
"Hate crimes" bill criminalizes thought. There is no such thing as a criminal thought, only criminal acts.  As stated well by Jim Demint.
I am not pleased that "we" are compensating in the millions a former CEO that aided in GMC's failure and taxpayer bailout!  That is wrong.
I have all the confidence in the world that Gov. Schwarzenegger can turn around Cali's economy.  I hope their reps will work with him more.
Another frustrating loss for the National League, however we are still the league of the World Champs.  Great game.
Great news, tomorrow Pres Obama will introduce me as his newest csar!  I will be the csar of watching grass grow.  Congrats go to me!
I have my fingers crossed for a National League win tonite.  I hope everyone gets a chance to watch our national pastime tonite.
Jim Jordan, as a fellow Ohioan I wish to encourage others to check out your new site jordan.house.gov I was very impressed with the site!
I'm a bit offended that Glenn Beck would assert that President Bush started our move towards "socialism".  I find that very inaccurate.
Great questions by Senator Graham.  Sotomayor state she believes we "are" at war.  I'm happy to hear her state that.
John Kasich, as a proud conservative and Ohioan I as well as many others are thrilled you are going to be our next Governor.  Jobs, jobs...
I believe Lindsey Graham is probably right.  Sotomayor won't be any worse than who she is likely to replace.  I suppose it could be worse.
I'm pleased Karl Rove has an exclusive Fox contract because I can't bring myself to watch CNN and the 3 major networks.  Thanks Fox.
I thought Karl Rove was in the home run derby tonite.  He was great on Oreilly talking Sotomayor and the CIA.  He hit both out of the park.
I'd also like to encourage all to read the post and link by John Boehner in regards to taxes and health care.
The Sotomayor confirmation may be a forgone conclusion, however I hope to see she is fully vetted by Republicans.  I want to know more.
Again, I am new to this, but why aren't there more of the Republican leadership using this form of social networking?  We need to be heard.
I'm pleased to see the Republicans working together to prevent another stimulus package.  I hope they do the same with Sotomayor.
I am new to this form of communication.  I ask you to forgive my lack of participation in this form of networking.  Thanks for having me.
