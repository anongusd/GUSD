@MalcolmHensley8 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Furthermore, the broader effects of tariffs are disputable anyway; so tariff rates are probably not the best core metric of success.		https://t.co/oidH3UKj9i
@MalcolmHensley8 @GOP @realDonaldTrump If your whole concept of good leadership revolves around how much we pay in tariffs and how that fits into grade school concepts of respect and fear by physical intimidation then I don't know what to tell you.
@MalcolmHensley8 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Interesting that, given your experience with bullies, that you think bullying is a good way to lead.		Also, that your opening argument was basically calling me and my friends gradeschool wussies. Compelling stuff

@robbystarbuck @michelleinbklyn I love how the response discussion to Trump lying his face off and attacking a man with cancer has devolved into a quibble over whether "remission" means "dying" or not.
Upsetting, yes. Telling, also.		They're demonstrating what we already know: the obscenely wealthy care more about their bottom line than the health, well-being, and quality of life of other humans.		And, by extension, what's already been proven: trickle-down is a complete scam. https://t.co/4nGa86ur9I
@scalzi @mistervimes Better to be underrated than overrated, I guess!
@smalldogsdesign @nate909page @BetsyOfTheBoys @jeffzeleny I was going to say exactly this.		Maybe he's assuming that the Left being too pragmatic, too centrist, is what pushed the Right to extremes? Seems like a poor take when the right wing media is screaming nonsense across every avenue they have. Definitely pragmatists at fault here.

@jkppcp @AOC Kav was a garbage candidate who deserved to be scrutinized and taken to task. He's misogynistic, partisan, privileged, and essentially said that the president is above the law.		If trying to hold him accountable is what you consider an "attack," you're just proving @AOC's point.
@TomiLahren Wait, YOU are accusing others of being "nasty?" It's apparent you don't actually review what you put into the world.
This is resonating right now for a good reason. @AOC  breaks it down in simple terms that people can understand.		This is a skill that is tremendously rare in politics; usually we see disingenuous over-simplifications and bad-faith double standards. Instead, she gives us truth. https://t.co/AelUB0EszZ
@leeleeb50 Trump is 'vindicated' for sticking with his stupid moniker, and Republicans have more fodder to call Democrats liars and hypocrites, as they do.		It's embarrassing, mostly. Doesn't functionally matter at all, but it's politics points for the other side.

@laceyd500gmail1 @krassenstein @BarbaraWieczor7 What's insane? "Market competition" for state population by equalizing the strength of each vote? Doesn't seem insane to me; just a positive side effect of abolishing the Electoral College.
@krassenstein @BarbaraWieczor7 ... And lower-populated states might have some incentive to attract a higher population through policy that actually helps people thrive?		So terribly fair. Just terribly.
@krassenstein @BarbaraWieczor7 But then rural communities would FEEL disenfranchised the way urban areas ARE!		...and land ownership wouldn't help determine the strength of a vote!		This sounds terribly fair. Just terribly.

For the record, $10m/yr means that person is working an 8,000-hour work week at $50k/yr. It means every MINUTE that person works is worth 3.3 HOURS at $50k/yr.		And people say that taxes are theft?? Give me a fucking break.
Nobody--NOBODY--works 200+ TIMES HARDER than a full-time worker making $50k/yr.		That someone making $10m+/yr pay a large part of their income back into the economy that brought them such obscene wealth in the first place is the absolute, utter minimum that we should demand.

@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao You remind me of this Trump supporter I argued with occasionally on Facebook. He would hurl insult after insult, rebutting imaginary arguments, and totally aloof of anything I actually wrote. It became clear he was arguing with someone else entirely; the white whale in his head.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Again, and simply, I'm not "tackling" the subject. I wasn't trying to prove anyone "wrong," and I'm not trying to be "right." I thanked those who shared information for me to read, and I intend to follow through on that.		Have a nice day. I hope you feel better soon.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Again with the personal attacks. As I said, I hope it brings you joy.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao You got me there!
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Study 2 is much more interesting, and lends a lot to the discussion. What it doesn't do, however, is magically retroactively create context for the OP's statement which reads exactly like gatekeeping.		Thank you for the studies. I'll dig into these.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Hey, there you go. You've been so focused on burying me in insults that this thread has gotten difficult to navigate.		Okay, so you apparently think that I don't know about cultural appropriation, which is something I specifically mentioned in my first tweet. That's study 1.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Look, I don't see your links to "studies." I'm not lying about that–why would I?		How hard is it to link to the tweet?
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao I don't think "unread" means what you think it does.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao ...so link the tweet?		Can you write something that isn't laced with sacrasm and personal attack? I'm not the one having a fit here.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao I'm not trying to prove anything wrong. My first tweet–the one I stand  by–is a criticism of the OP for reading like gatekeeping.		No amount of retrofitting is going to change the absence of context in  the OP. You're just yelling into the dark.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao I see a Michael Jordan gif and a bunch of really insulting comments about me.		Unless you think that insults are peer-reviewed studies? That would explain a lot.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Ad Hominem attacks aside, Appeals to Authority aside, False Dilemma aside, now you're invoking logical fallacies at me.		Sigh.		I hope that insulting strangers in the internet brings you joy, at least. That would at least be one thing gained from all of this.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao You posted studies? Where?
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao The entire premise of my 'disagreement' is that the OP posted a vague, declarative thing, which I stand by. You and others came floating in to retroactively apply context and treat those confused by this like they are babies. You're very practiced at this talking down stuff.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao The only opinion I've presented was that the OP wrote something that seemed like gatekeeping, and I backed that up by pointing out her lack of providing any context whatsoever. Those things are both literally true.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao "Quote me on being assumptive // Being fragile... Want to tell people what to do.... Can't substantiate."
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Do you read what you write?
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao You're assuming a lot about me. Seems like you just want to slap people down on the internet, regardless of what they post. It's easy to talk down to people, if that's what you're into
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao This is the piece that was linked to me, above: https://t.co/N4I9JfUCxB		What studies are you talking about?
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao But... You're inferring her meaning here. I pointed out the literal problem with her OP.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao It's good food for thought, but I don't think it lays out the red carpet for something like 'WP... Yes, your Namastes are racist'. If her point was to get people to talk, then OP succeeded. If the point was to write something objectively true, then OP failed.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Don't assume that two profs penning an opinion piece means that it's accepted common knowledge among progressives that yoga and white supremacy are walking hand in hand, and that anyone who doesn't know must be a racist idiot or a child who needs correcting.
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Now you're just arguing about arguing. You apparently missed my point, and are just being crappy at me. I'm not asking for kid gloves. I read the article, and I understand your point. OP didn't write that, though
@TheOGLaurenM @mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Yes, we should not hold others accountable to communicate clearly. We should just become offended at the slightest provocation and then become snarky with each other for not immediately agreeing. What was I thinking?

Not my fault as the reader for not filling in giant gaps myself and assuming her intentions.
@mikeshort76 @BKBVB89 @sairasameerarao Yes, it's good to be mindful of the history of your hobbies/lifestyle. That's a concept I believe in wholeheartedly.

Nevermind that real people were hurt, and that real people now are hurting through this whole thing, and that, if he actually served on the SCOTUS he would hurt real people with his decisions.
Watching Kanavaugh through this whole thing, he seems most like someone who is genuinely shocked that something he thought was fun and cool at the time turned out not to be fun or cool at all and dismayed and terrified that he now might actually have to admit that.
He's blatantly partisan. He kisses up to the president. He's desperate to save his own bacon. His past is shady, and his views are radically regressive. He's a crap candidate for the job.		#KavaNOPE
He lashed out against Democrats, and even the Clintons.		He insisted on his innocence but just wants us to take his word for it. And he became unhinged and emotional like a kid backed into a corner.		This is not what innocence looks like, let alone a SCOTUS judge.
I actually saw someone write without irony that Kavanaugh was bullied and abused today.		He refused to directly answer the question of whether he wants the FBI to investigate. He broke down. He yelled. He dodged on if he wants his key character witness to give testimony.

@Bayonethics2 @DLoesch @danielihumphrey That's a nice anecdote. I'm happy for him, of course, but I wonder how he would feel about being used to downplay the experiences of others who are being persecuted and oppressed.
@DLoesch @danielihumphrey It's silly if you're a deliberately dense literalist.		If you consider the direct impact that the Republican party's policies and attitudes have on the lives of LGBTQ+, non-white, immigrant humans, rather, Ryan has done much worse than that. He's active in destroying lives.

3| To summarize: a response is free speech too.		In today's example, to look at a society seeking to eradicate racism–by calling it out and holding people accountable–as some sort of broader cultural censorship is to deny the freedom of speech of every individual involved.
2| By favoring the "freedom of speech" of either [statement/response] over the other, you are presenting your own opinion on the matter.		It's not as simple as, "Censorship"vs."Free Speech"; framing this sort of thing in that way is propaganda designed to discredit one side.
1| I had a thought about "Freedom of Speech" this morning:		Firstly, a person has the freedom to say what they want. (statement)		Secondly, a other person has the freedom to respond to any statement however they wish. (response)

@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair I'm glad you are active in that which impassions you. So, in summary: you think that feminism is generally failing men because they are not helpful on this issue? I do not know many men who feel passionate about male circumcision, but certainly those who do should have a voice.
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair So, I'll avoid getting into the specifics of that topic and just ask: Are you actively fighting to get male circumcision banned, or is this just a reason why you think feminism is failing men? Because I think there's room within the framework of feminism for that sort of cause.
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair And, "privileged" doesn't mean "without suffering or hardship;" it just describes subtle and not-subtle advantages. Another broad assumption made by people who avoid real discussion in favor of ideological stereotypes.
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair I am a man, and I cannot think of a single thing that is under-or-mis-represented by/in feminism. Most of these male-specific issues are addressed in the dissection of toxic masculinity. But that's lost on most anyone who makes broad assumptions about feminism based on its title.
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair Finding work and providing for families are concerns for all people regardless of gender. I'm very curious to hear what you think are male-exclusive issues that are ignored by feminism.
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair I think you have a problem with the term "feminism," brother, not the actual ideology. As a man, I find as much value in it for me as I believe most women do.
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair As a man, I see the dissection and dissolution of Toxic Masculinity as a tremendously positive thing for everyone, men included. So to summarize that plight as "hate" comes across ridiculous to me
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair You are right- many people are very dismissive of men, and antagonistically so. But I see this play out mostly in response to men whining about seeing their place at the top of the culture chain dissolve in favor of a more egalitarian society, which is honestly laughable.
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair Recommended reading: definition of feminism. Not at all dismissive of men. Also, you have provided a great summary of Right wing demographics: "what's in it for me?"
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair but those are small peas compared to the prevalence and effects of Toxic Masculinity, in my opinion.
@kevinpearce_esq @DrLovlie @wokeoharam @mrtnprz @MorgaineFee @Bro_Pair "Toxic Feminity" in a patriarchal society would naturally be tied directly into, complimentary to, and reactionary of, the role of masculinity. Therefore I find it absurd to suggest it's even remotely equal a concept to Toxic Masculinity. People talk about toxic female behaviors,

Anti-reform gun advocates are behaving in disgusting, shitty ways. What else are we to conclude, but that their arguments are as hollow as their "thoughts and prayers," and their cause is as shitty as their reprehensible attacks on victims?
Do you really think the GOP would advocate for them if semi-automatic guns were a REAL THREAT to an oppressive gov? Who's coming to rob your house in the middle of the night-the fucking Terminator? Is it worth living in a horror movie so you can pewpew quickly at the range?
Who's brainwashed here: those who see a preventable, hellish horror play out over and over again and say, "enough. We must change this," or those who see the same and conclude there is nothing to be done-or, worse, that it's worth what we get in return?
What amazes me, though, is the demonization of these people. Death threats to shooting victims? Comparisons to Hitler Youth? Crisis actors? These kids are reacting directly to what they have experienced, what they ARE experiencing.
Unless your idea of "thinking" means that your brain touches a subject and then recoils into itself in horror. "Thinking," to me, means examining my beliefs, and often changing and/or evolving them. But, I digress. Our kids would be fools to trust any action on empty sentiments.
Our youth have been through hell. They live in constant fear that is totally justified because we won't do a damn thing to protect them that doesn't put the responsibility on them or their teachers. We prove time and time again that we are lying when we say we send thoughts.
Sharing doctored images of reform advocates that are deliberately designed to lie about their beliefs, calling them names... One representative from my state even compared them to the Hitler Youth (then, true to form, spinelessly claimed that's simply not what she meant).
Right now, anti-reform gun advocates are doing what they do best-demonizing the opposition. First it was calling the murder of children an 'unfortunate side effect of freedom,' and now it's accusing those same children of faking, or being brainwashed into believing what they do.
