Cohen is credible. The media needs to stop saying things like ‚Äúour reporting suggests he did indeed want a job at the White House despite the fact that Reince declined to comment on the testimony.‚Äù Your reporting also said the Mueller report was done two weeks ago.
Cohen just passed lap 472 around house Republicans.

3/3 The DNC reached this criteria after consultation with the digital community, including ActBlue, on historical trends in small donor fundraising and expectations for this cycle.
2/ The second way a candidate can meet the debate criteria is by meeting the grassroots fundraising threshold. For the first debate, the DNC states a candidate must receive donations from 65,000 people, with at least 200 unique donors per-state in a minimum of 20 states.
1/ For the first two debates, The DNC is introducing a new metric - grassroots fundraising - to accompany a traditional polling requirement. To meet the DNC polling threshold, a candidate must reach at least 1% support in the polls in at least three reputable polls.
The DNC has announced NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo will host the first debate, which will be in June. The DNC also announced CNN will host the second debate, which will be in July. There is no FOX debate in this announcement.

Real test for press. Is a freshman cussing more newsworthy than another deranged rant from the president of the United States?
Guy who doesn‚Äôt believe in climate change is doing a Rose Garden event in January.
Amazing to see how quickly the Washington press corps has rediscovered its delicate sensibilities. Three years of an endless vulgarity as a president but suddenly a cuss word is making them faint.
Dude is under 17 federal investigations, just lost 40 seats in the House and enjoys a 39 percent approval rating. He ain‚Äôt scaring anybody except his own party.
