Quote of the day: “The real challenge becomes six months, eight months, a year after Janus — what is the value of belonging?” — Randi Weingarten, American Federation of Teachers President @rweingarten @theintercept #1u @rmc031 https://t.co/vc2ibbWBsv
Though the pain inflicted on public sector unions has been less than originally expected after the Supreme Court's 2018 Janus ruling, a right-wing opt-out campaign could do lasting damage to the labor movement. https://t.co/vc2ibbWBsv #1u @theintercept @rmc031
Despite initial fears that the Supreme Court's 2018 Janus ruling would devastate public sector unions, vibrant internal organizing has resulted in smaller-than-expected agency-fee payer drop offs — and more dues-paying members. https://t.co/vc2ibbWBsv #1u @theintercept @rmc031

@josheidelson I'm sick of reading one article after another despairing the state of labor. It is awful &amp; may get worse still, but labor still has millions of members, billions of dollars and social capital that, if spent strategically with a moral vision, can contest this predatory capitalism.
@josheidelson As bad as things are for labor — and they may get worse before they get better, if they ever do — it has, historically, been worse. Unionists and their allies are not getting gunned down in the street (yet). Legally, labor still have more rights, even post-Janus, then pre-Wagner.
Conservatives, fresh from winning Janus and imposing right to work nationally on public sector unionized employees, are now pitching the end of exclusive bargaining as a boon to unions, saying it will free them from negotiating on behalf of nonmembers. https://t.co/Ili3Jtbshi #1u

@ErikLoomis @ddayen Of course. One lesson for progressive union leaders in #RightToWork (and purple or red) states that are interested in moving the needle left is to stick to the script of economic populism and working class progressivism and see how many reactionaries you can peel off, right? #1u
@ErikLoomis @ddayen I agree. I think an unapologetically and universalist working class platform can sway some and I would argue enough — though certainly not all, or even most — white unionists with reactionary views on race. The left can help there, but unions should internally push too. #1u
@ErikLoomis @ddayen For sure. It wasn't lost on the left and liberals that the building trades met with Trump shortly after he took office, despite his bigotry and anti-unionism. What do you think is the best way to sway those white unionists away from Trump? Is that necessary or worthwhile? #1u
@ErikLoomis @ddayen The most wishful of thoughts on the left being its overestimation that organized labor in general, and certain unions in particular, is likely to support with money and marches a truly progressive racial politics? #1u
@ErikLoomis @ddayen Really, even among younger members of otherwise conservative unions? Would you say that insurgent, young carpenters or ironworkers, for example, are more conservative than their older union leaders? I'd imagine Millennial unionists, even in conservative unions, are more left. #1u

@noamscheiber Has there been any indication from organized labor after its #Missouri victory in seeking the repeal of other state #RightToWork laws, especially in states that are more purple? #1u #unionyes
After organized labor's victory in #Missouri in beating back that state legislature's #RightToWork law — a state President Trump won by double digits — will unions now go on offense and seek the repeal of RTW in other states? https://t.co/IuwLAZYNCm #1u #unionyes #PropA

And the solution is called union organizing for a collective bargaining agreement that includes just cause protections for workers. The courageous journalists at @jacobinmag, @Law360 and other @nyguild shops would know. https://t.co/bqfySELwEu #1u #unionyes

The White House tomorrow will reportedly introduce a plan to merge the Education and Labor Departments as part of an effort to shrink the federal government. The Education Department has about 3.9K employees. DOL has about 15K. https://t.co/Uw470EAW1n #1u @WSJ
@ErikLoomis Is the conclusion a fatalist one then? Was the massive growth in union membership and power during the 1930s and 1940s a historical anomaly under unique circumstances that can never be recreated? Are we really doomed to just fighting rearguard actions on behalf of unions? #1u
@ErikLoomis Unions did have enough power to lend funds and staff to the civil rights struggle though. Did progressive unions then make an effort to couple labor law reform with a broader civil rights bill at any point? That might have been there best shot, no? #1u
@ErikLoomis Absorbing the lesson then, what is the best way to get buy-in from workers in these regions to support unions? Is it to organize key firms/sectors there? Is it to partner with social movements there? What do you think is the best way to reach workers in non-union dense areas? #1u
@ErikLoomis Hard as it is, the answer seems to me to be that unions have to organize workers in all regions at the same time. To do otherwise is to risk labor splintering along lines of race or region. Where the money, personnel and momentum necessary for that comes from though idk. #1u
@ErikLoomis After the 1964 election, with supermajorities in the 89th Congress, why didn't LBJ push labor law reform? While I understand that many congressional Democrats didn't owe unions much, LBJ could have used the narrative of civil rights then to help the house of labor. #1u

@srussellkraft Since there's no hope of labor reform under this Congress or administration to address the power imbalance between worker and employer, it's up to workers — for now, at least — to unionize and collectively bargain for contracts that don't have class action waivers. #1u
@rkgwork @sharblock @TerriGerstein Given how gridlocked and corrupted by money this Congress is, wouldn't it be better to push right now for union organizing rather than legislative fixes? In the short term, there's no hope in this Congress acting on labor's behalf. Better to organize now as the teachers are. #1u
@BenjaminDictor It's amazing how contorted the right's reading of the Federal Arbitration Act has become, to the detriment of consumer and now workers' rights. The best solution has to be to organize workers into unions to bargain for contracts that lack class action waivers. #1u
@sharblock @TerriGerstein @nytopinion The best solution has been and continues to be for workers themselves to organize unions and collectively bargain for fair contracts, which lack class action waivers.
