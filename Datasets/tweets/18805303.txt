Important discussion with USDA today about the role that broadband plays in re-envisioning connectivity across Rural America.
Happy 152nd Birthday, Nebraska! On March 1, 1867, you became the first new state to join the Union after the Civil War. You remain a place where that union is deeply held and preserved.
In high-stakes dialogues, you’ve got to govern your emotions. The threat to the world from a nuclear nightmare with North Korea is so great, I honestly hoped for a breakthrough on denuclearization and ending the Korean War. It was not ripe. The President was right to walk away.
Great news for local and national parks: Yesterday the House passed a public lands package that includes permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and provisions that protect millions of acres of wilderness for multiple use opportunity

Iran has developed the fuel necessary for a nuclear weapon &amp; we must recognize their mastery over the process. http://t.co/UCgZyPs9xC
Complex &amp; controversial agreement over Iran’s nuclear development is dominating the news. http://t.co/UCgZyPs9xC

ICYMI, @OWHnews editorial provides important look at risks involved in Iranian nuclear agreement: http://t.co/IGnm2sugZ1
Two risks involved with #IranDeal: the risk of an agreement, and the risk of no agreement. http://t.co/o5EZCpm7Bg
It is my job to scrutinize the details of any deal, debate the merits, and examine added options. #IranDeal http://t.co/o5EZCpm7Bg
#IranDeal will be met with much skepticism from Congress-should be circumspect about limits of what  achieve with or without agreement.
The #IranDeal must demonstrate in a verifiable manner that it will stop and reverse #Iran’s march toward the bomb. http://t.co/o5EZCp4wJI
Under no circumstances should #Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. http://t.co/o5EZCp4wJI

ISIL is better financed, better armed, controls more territory, &amp; commands a bigger army than al-Qaeda ever has. http://t.co/HXGZKdBB8m

The US cannot commit to combat troop operations but we can work with other nations to contain and degrade ISIS.
I thought the President's call for a broad international coalition was the right decision.
The current situation in the Middle East demands international intervention.
ISIS is a threat to all persons in the world and a threat to civilization itself.
I thank Lavon Heidemann for his many years of public service and wish him well in the future.
I have always been impressed by Lavon's commitment to hard work   steadfast leadership first as a state Senator &amp; most recently as LtGov.
I first met Lavon Heidemann at a parade in Auburn many years ago.

Through a little miracle, JD Alexander and his wife found their wedding rings in the yard of their devastated home. #pilgerstrong
Past president of NE Cattlemen's Beef Assoc JD Alexander lost his house while his family hid in an old storm shelter. #pilgerstrong
75 percent of houses and all the downtown businesses are gone. Saw a church reduced to rubble. #pilgerstrong
Saw 300 yard black swath heading into town. Told it was a propane and chemical leak. #pilgerstrong
Sign in Pilger: "Too tough to die." #pilgerstrong
Pilger bank employees hid in the vault during the storm. That's what saved them. #pilgerstrong
