Evergreen tweet https://t.co/22lO9Z6PaU
Men of all generations give the same (kind of pitiful tbh) level of agreement re: is it a good thing that more women are running for office. But women, especially younger women, overwhelmingly say yes. (Very relevant for today‚Äôs @EliseStefanik #GOPWomen conference!) https://t.co/9tYbwZtAbw
In case maybe TODAY is the day you have decided ‚Äúwow, I wonder what Republicans can do given these generational divides?‚Äù HAVE I GOT A BOOK FOR YOU. https://t.co/UP866bbKPJ
One of the questions Pew breaks out by party shows that Dems of all ages think racism is an issue, but there‚Äôs an age gap among GOPers: Gen Z and millennial Republicans are more likely than their elders to say the same. https://t.co/MBUeZ2Cav7
Throughout the poll, Gen Z and Millennial responses are almost the same, save one topic: gender identity. Gen Z much more likely to know someone who uses neutral pronouns. https://t.co/bbpemb8vE8
I am often asked if the pendulum will swing back and if Gen Z might actually be more right-leaning than the Obama-era Millennials. Current verdict: no. https://t.co/q0V4q37uxC
NEW POLL: @pewresearch gives us a first glimpse into the political views of Gen Z. Turns out they‚Äôre just as left-leaning as the Millennials. GOP now has a TWO generation problem. https://t.co/g06e77e4mD

You should watch #TheGoodPlace. You should also watch the new Marie Kondo show (#TUWMK). I think they each have something to tell us about the joy and stress of even mundane decisions in our current political era. https://t.co/y2dusVUdSK
I should add that there was one other variable that changed between 8th and 9th grade: I got bangs. ‚ÄúMandy Moore In A Walk To Remember‚Äù bangs. So, maybe it was the haircut. https://t.co/u9Kx22zaJ0
@vplus @bestbitesblog I think it‚Äôs plausible but am basing this view off the same one or two articles that are floating out there (and my general view about the huge brand risk a dc-based biz would face around trump)
Michael on The Good Place last week described how small decisions now carry new political/moral baggage. ‚ÄúAt a time when it feels like every decision we make is weighty, the choice to keep the ill-fitting sweater or the broken blender is blessedly not.‚Äù https://t.co/y2dusVUdSK

Critical to note: GOP voters don't think we're in crisis. They think the party is doing well on this. They don't know how bad the numbers are, and when you tell them, they still don't think it's a crisis. But they think it matters nonetheless.
Only 13 GOP women will sit in the House next Congress. Thankfully, GOP voters support a wide range of ideas to tackle the issue and specifically support talented female candidates. They also get that this matters for winning elections. My latest project -&gt; https://t.co/1QWImfGLbN

One more thing, and this is the real punch in the face for Republicans: Millennials are now into their mid-30s. And look at the 19 point gap among aged 30-44. (In 2014 that was a D+2 group. In 2010, R+2. Even in the ghastly 2006 they were only D+8.) https://t.co/ACYzPBJyAg

My extremely sophisticated chart making here https://t.co/XVwlyGfIp7
My current tally of GOP House women has the count at 16 (with Handel and Tenney not included as they are down though the races are not yet called). This would be a decline from the 23 GOP women in the 115th Congress, both in raw numbers and as a proportion of the GOP conference.
@MikeObserver @RBPundit @allahpundit It‚Äôs all good ;)
@jeffayc Yeah, though there wasn‚Äôt a ton of polling there, what existed was Cordray +4ish. Weren‚Äôt nearly as many data points as those three states I mentioned, but a good addition!

@MikeObserver @RBPundit RCP average when I looked this morning had McSally up by a tiny bit, which is what happened?
I should also add that, unlike past cycles, I‚Äôve not (yet?) heard grumbling from anyone about the private polling being off, on either side. Most of what I heard privately about internal polls, esp in Florida, showed up in the results.

If you would like to read more about how 2006 was the year when #TheSelfieVote really began the trend toward the Dems, even before Obama, please read my old graduate school thesis, lol.
For context: in the 2006 "blue wave" midterm, young voters broke D by +22. So, D +37 is enormous, massive, extraordinary, etc.
PRELIMINARY EXIT POLL RESULT: "Young voters (18-29) are voting 68-31 percent, Democratic-Republican. That vast 37-point margin compares with a 21-point margin for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a 12-point margin for Democratic House candidates among under-30s in 2014."

@WaliMalik2 Good to know! It‚Äôs fascinating that both the ABC and NBC polls have nearly the same ‚Äúgeneric ballot‚Äù margin but that the underlying crosstabs can tell different stories of how to get there.
From time to time, I hear that it doesn‚Äôt matter if the GOP loses young voters because they don‚Äôt turn out and you can just run up offsetting pro-GOP margins with seniors. That‚Äôs why this figure catches my eye.
Both the under 40 figure and the over 65 figure are notable here. Voters under 40 going D+23 should not surprise anyone following me on Twitter. But, as @murphymike has noted often, the over-65 crowd only breaking R+3 is maybe even a bigger deal here. (H/t @dellavolpe for chart) https://t.co/Dn6mDuXifa

Adding context: in 2014, their poll showed 65% or RVs over all were certain to vote and today‚Äôs has 80% saying they‚Äôre certain. So the increase is +15 for overall electorate and +25 for voters under 40. https://t.co/lfUY0hGwtU

@danielbasden @willralls @yashar If you wanted to have an argument about how science agencies should approach Congress for funding, fine! But there was no "ban."

@kdittmar @FiveThirtyEight @CookPolitical @CAWP_RU Thank you for providing the Dem side of the equation, you just saved me a lot of time!
If you are Republican and this matters to you, see my first tweet. There's your list. Go knock doors, makecalls, etc. What a total shame it would be if, in a year with so much energy around women in politics, that Republicans end up with fewer women than we started with! (6/6!)
If 20 is the magic number just to break even on the gender makeup of the caucus, then the GOP needs ALL the women who are likely and lean Rs, plus three more, to win. It's definitely not impossible! But. (5/6)
Currently, 23 women out of a GOP caucus of 240 is 9.6% of the caucus. If Republicans lose 33 seats (the current 538 forecast), 9.6% of 207 means you need 20 in order to not slip as a share of the caucus. (4/almost done)
Right now, the GOP has 23 women in the House. And, if we are eliminating the Solid D seats from contention, the ceiling post-election is 27 and the floor is 8. (I don't think 8 is likely! Don't panic! But only 8 are Cook listed "Solid Rs" so we start there.) (3/a few more)
That chart only shows 27 races. The other 23 (chart here!) are listed as Solid D by both @FiveThirtyEight and @CookPolitical. I salute these women for putting their name on the ballot even in a long shot race! But in this environment, it's hard to see a Solid D flipping. (2/more) https://t.co/3Y8yuKoR0R

All of which is to say that, if this is "the foreign policy version of Charlottesville" I actually would expect there to be some (maybe very small) dip in his job approval, driven almost totally by losses among Republicans.
Meanwhile, this time last year, Trump's job approval was around the low-30s among Independents and high single digits among Dems. After Charlottesville? No change. There was nowhere lower for them to go.
One year ago Trump's approval ratings among GOP were in the mid-80s. Then...Charlottesville. They fell to the high 70s and stayed hovering thereabouts until passage of tax reform/start of 2018. 		As of last week, his job approval was 90% among Republicans. https://t.co/FpsmuVipc2

@SeanTrende @aedwardslevy Yep. Between status quo preference and acquiescence bias, you can structure a Q in many ways to leverage/avoid those biases. Which, hey, it‚Äôs unavoidable. I‚Äôm curious if there is consistency though in how SCOTUS case Qs are handled.
I ask because there are many ways to frame it. Would you support upholding a ruling? Would you support overturning a ruling? Would you support keeping an existing right? Etc etc. (Acquiescence bias means it‚Äôs easier in a survey to get ppl to say yes/agree/support than no/oppose).
Question for polling land (mostly you, @aedwardslevy) - I am curious about public poll question wording re ‚Äúuphold Roe‚Äù vs other times court has potentially overturned precedent (gay marriage, for instance) - do questions tend to be framed as ‚Äúdo you support upholding Ruling X‚Äù?

@adamhgeller @TonyFabrizioGOP @ThePollsters Ok I asked! They pushed back on social desirability bias explanation somewhat but acknowledged more research needed (which I know you are doing a lot of). I still think your description of better understanding the undecideds is really compelling.
@adamhgeller @TonyFabrizioGOP @ThePollsters Yep. I‚Äôm about to ask a question along these lines here in the session (if they call on me). Will update in a moment!
Cool experiment: when ppl are told poll is sponsored by GMU vs by WaPo, results differ! They find it‚Äôs not because of refusal rates (GOPers just ask likely to take GMU va WaPo poll). Instead, they give different answers. Result was more accurate for WaPo condition vs GMU. https://t.co/gY0tnSdsHL
@toniacontorno That‚Äôs fair. Should have re-worded that there is no real evidence that those demographics drop off (which is what you‚Äôd expect if Trump voters were dropping off.) Thank you!
Would love @adamhgeller @TonyFabrizioGOP thoughts on this. I recall Tony‚Äôs interview with @ThePollsters post-elex mentioning ‚Äúhidden Trump voter‚Äù as being more about people taking polls but reporting being undecided when really they were going to vote Trump.
So does this blow up the ‚Äúhidden Trump voter‚Äù idea? Not totally, in my view. The good news is it means Republicans are not checking out of survey taking. However, ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù is not strictly the same as ‚ÄúTrump Voter.‚Äù Plus, I‚Äôd love this analysis done by education level. https://t.co/q1Wv4LP0fq
Looking at demographics, it‚Äôs older people and white voters were more likely to complete surveys. https://t.co/MzsPttSVen
The result? Almost no difference in the likelihood that GOP or Dem households to pickup the phone or take a poll. Independents were the ones less likely. But what about other demos... https://t.co/1omrJClxYK
CBS News polling unit looked at voter file data for the phone numbers they called for their polls in 2016, to try to understand who is at the phone numbers that DIDN‚ÄôT take a poll - the 26% who actively refused and the 62% who didn‚Äôt answer. https://t.co/CsCFPqpebw

Some pollsters let people say ‚Äúhere is how likely I am to vote!‚Äù and use that to define LVs. Others use past vote history to make that judgment.

Anyhow, thanks to all weighing in on the poll above. I don't know yet if I think it's actually a winning message in future elections, but was curious to see how my Twitter feed would come down on the question.
There's disagreement about WHY things feel this way. (GOP blames Dems, the media. Dems say it is Trump's fault.) But I ask "what's one word you'd use to describe how you feel about how things are going in the country" at the start of groups, the answers are surprisingly similar.
@garyleff I think it is pretty clear that this was not a winning message in 2016, regardless of who you think best embodied it, if anyone.
I ask this only because in nearly every focus group I have done in the last 8-10 months, where people used to first express anxiety about cost of living/economy, the first anxiety they raise nowadays - regardless of party - is how divided, angry and crazy everything feels.
"If elected, I promise to run an effective, limited, and frankly boring government. If you hate how political turbulence has crept into our daily lives and increased our collective anger and stress levels, vote for me. We can't keep living like this."

Do we know who Spurrier is cheering for? That would change everything, @AdmiralWaugh. https://t.co/P3FyrxwuZS
@alexruthrauff The problem is that the two Gators on the Eagles will probably see very very little action, while Mike Gillislee is a reasonably significant part of the Patriots offense. (Correct me if I'm wrong, sports Twitter.)
@alexruthrauff This is accurate math, to be sure.
Second tiebreaker: how did each team treat Tim Tebow? Both the Eagles and the Patriots signed Tebow for 5-ish month stints before releasing him (BOOOOO). https://t.co/2cePMOMOUD
My parents are from the Philly area, and my husband grew up near Boston. I attempted to use "which team has more Gators on it?" as a tiebreaker but Eagles 2, Pats 1 isn't really a compelling stat.
