@JustinDRosario Tell me one thing they believe that the broader Catholic church does not.		You can't, so we're done.  Adios.
@JustinDRosario Awwww.... you've lost your little argument and you've settled into repeating "Christian Sharia" in lieu of making a point. 		I guess we're done.  Bye now.
@JustinDRosario Again, the KOC believe nothing more or less than the broader Catholic church. 		So, you're an anti-Catholic bigot who's unwilling to apply that same standard of bigotry to Catholic and Islamic Dems.  Just admit that.
@JustinDRosario I'm saying there is no religious litmus test to be a judge.  		YOU, Kamala Harris, and Mazie Hirono don't believe this.  YOU believe that religious beliefs that don't support gay marriage are judicial disqualifiers.  However, as a hypocrite, you also celebrate Muslims in Gov.
@JustinDRosario Oh no!  JFK was a Knight of Columbus.  Clearly, you believe he was unfit to be President. https://t.co/501FsIyjiz
@JustinDRosario You must hate JFK, right?
@JustinDRosario She's a Catholic. Knights of Columbus believe exactly NOTHING the Catholic Church doesn't believe.		So, Pelosi claims to believe EXACTLY what the KOC believes.  Call on her to resign. And Ellison, Tlaib, and Omar, too.
@JustinDRosario Nope.  I believe people can see the difference between moral judgment and legal judgment. You don't. 		So, since you think Catholics can't be impartial, call  for the resignation of all Muslim and Catholic Dems in Congress. Otherwise, you're full of guano compadre.
@JustinDRosario Pelosi, too, by the way.
@JustinDRosario Nominee touted nothing at all.  They see his religion as a reason that he can't be impartial.  If Catholics can't be impartial, neither can Muslims.		Call for the resignation of Tlaib and Omar, or confess your hypocrisy.  Your call.
@JustinDRosario Judge has not ruled in a single case forcing you to do ANYTHING based on his Catholicism.  Harris and Hirono object solely on the basis of his religion. 		On that basis, you MUST call for the resignation of Tlaib and Omar.  Otherwise, you just proving yourself a garbage hypocrite
@JustinDRosario And no one is saying that.  So... Thank you for striking a blow against bigots like Kamala Harris and Mazie Hirono.
@JustinDRosario Tell us more about how excited Democrats are for the "first Muslim women to be elected to Congress."
@JustinDRosario "Fanatic" to leftists = "any catholic who believes in Catholicism"

@chilipe01641625 @Lwbayfront @IvankaTrump They're not 'chained.'  No one is.  That's the point.  They're free to think, believe, and feel whatever they want.		....And we're free to defeat them.
@MrSynther @j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork I'm glad you've seen the error of your ways. I wouldn't say it makes my day, but it does bring a smile to my face.  What a nice thing to happen on #NationalSmileDay!
"A message."  @USAToday jumped the shark a long time ago.  ...But this is stunning. https://t.co/nY14F3H3cO
Since we're speaking of double standards today. https://t.co/7hH81jMod7
@MrSynther @j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork You're slow so I'll explain. 		I said: "John Fitzpatrick is a proud, staunch supporter of calling women "C***s!"		He Said: "Of women calling women c***s, yes. Just like black men calling you U**** T**"		Thus he's fine with the labeling. Never said he was the one applying it.
The left is really having an "Alinsky Rule #4" problem today, aren't they?		"Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules."
Remember folks, "Labels are bad."   ...Unless you're a leftist who's ok seeing me labeled an "Uncle T" or @IvankaTrump a "C***."  Then they're super! https://t.co/21oiQznkhE
@MrSynther @j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork Here's your receipt. https://t.co/VPxiiHpLRh
@GentBB @RJMorris82 @M0ni_Day @TBSNetwork The old "black people should all think the same" argument. 		It's the height of #LeftWingRacism.  But I understand where it comes from.  The left is terrified that it's grip on the black vote is slipping.  So you're ramping up the rhetoric.		Newsflash: not gonna work
@j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork Already did.
@j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork And, for the record, Hillary Clintoin is a thoroughly despicable person - and I would never support ANYONE calling her a C***.  Male or female.		You aren't willing to make that stand.  That's your call.
@j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork Didn't say you called me that.  Said you were "fine with labeling me an Uncle Tom and Ivanka Trump a C***."  Thanks for confirming that's the case.
@j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork Guy who's fine with labeling me an Uncle Tom and Ivanka Trump a C*** lectures me about labels. https://t.co/AKGPTTTxJX
@RJMorris82 @M0ni_Day @TBSNetwork Your defense of the derogatory use of the word C*** is duly noted.
Yesterday, there's a good chance you saw a video of  @Trish_regan and I discussing the Roseanne situation. The barrage of "uncle tom"  comments &amp; #LeftWingRacism has been a pure delight! Here are some more of my thoughts on the matter!  https://t.co/43Q1pCvWPP
@CrookedOrange @DonaldCooley2 @TBSNetwork There's an election in 2020.
@j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork Your #leftwingracism is duly noted.  You're the whole package, there, aren't you!
@berkfran @TBSNetwork Congratulations on claiming the moral high ground by supporting the derogatory use of the word "C***."
@j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork Good to know. Let it henceforth be known that John Fitzpatrick is a proud, staunch supporter of calling women "C***s!"
@M0ni_Day @TBSNetwork I said it was racist. Said it was vile and there's no defending it. Also said they were looking for an excuse. Also said there's a left/right double standard.		Work on your reading comprehension.
It's so fun watching the feminist left defend the derogatory use of the C-word.  2018, 2020, gonna be a cakewalk. https://t.co/62FekwJk3f
@j_c_fitz @TBSNetwork Love watching the left defend the term C***.  Good times.
