A big list of things @JohnKasich will do in first 100 days.
You have to work with people -- the problem with @BarackObama is  that he is not a king , he's a president, says @JohnKasich
A good deal maker can make great deals, says @realDonaldTrump
Everything that can be enacted with executive action can be undone with executive action, says @tedcruz
We should be putting people into Guantinomo not closing it out, says @marcorubio at #GOPDebate
Closing Guantanimo is a complete disaaster, says @JebBush to applause at #GOPDebate
The fact is that none of us up here are military experts, says @RealBenCarson
Without the United States, nothing else seems to work, says @JebBush

RT @rickklein: Trump not leading in social conversation https://t.co/pEj4kuZRuP
I cant't tell whether @realDonaldTrump  and @tedcruz really disagree on how health care should be addressed
On immigration, @tedcruz says he will end benefits for those here illegally
On #immigration, @JohnKasich says he sees path to legalization - not citizenship -  is needed along with stronger border controls
Let China solve the problem of North Korea - says @realDonaldTrump
We just saw @JebBush taking his mother's advice to interrupt more often in #GOPDebate moments.
Right now #GOPDEBATE is top trending topic on Twitter worldwide
Governors @JebBush and @ChrisChristie making their cases that junior senators like @marcorubio and @tedcruz aren't tested as leaders
Attack from @ChrisChristie on @marcorubio experience to lead nation as a junior senator. Compares same mistake was made with @BarackObama
In defending Senate record, @marcorubio cites @JoeBiden being around for "a thousand years" and says he will reverse @BarackObama legacy
@tedcruz apologizes to @RealBenCarson in #GOPDebate
But @realDonaldTrump and @RealBenCarson take a stab at @tedcruz in opening rounds of #GOPDebate. Will this debate turn to internal battles?
early in debate @tedcruz avoids the bait to attack @realDonaldTrump

After a pretty antagonistic start, @BernieSanders and @HillaryClinton are winding down #DemDebate on a more collegial note.
#DemDebate turns to Wall Street - @HillaryClinton hammers on readiness to battle banks after attack of her paid speeches to banks
#DemDebate so far addressed:		Who's progressive?	Who's radical?	Who's establishment?	Who's accomplished? 	Who's beholden?
This #DemDebate so far isn't really about the issues but is really a battle about how to label each other in the minds of voters
Making college free, providing health care for all and fixing our crumbling infrastructure are not radical ideas, says @BernieSanders
Hearing @HillaryClinton really stressing that "progressive" means "progress" her practical ability to get things done
The middle class bailed out Wall Street in its time of need, now it's Wall Street's turn to bail out the middle class, says @BernieSanders
