Treasonous = conspiring with an enemy ( to defraud the American people of their rightfully elected leaders ( See Trump, Donald J. ) ).

Don't like it when the conspiracy theories are aimed at your side, hmmm, Gorka? Conspiracy theories are stupid and bad for the country, no matter which way they are aimed. So stop spreading them. Two can play at that game. You're just objecting to payback. #ImpeachTreasonousTrump https://t.co/nWP0lHg9II
Trump should be ignored. Even when we object to what he does we continue his fame. It would be most satisfying to see his melt down as he whines and raves about how people need to pay attention to him. #ImpeachTreasonousTrumpPence #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica https://t.co/aUJ3Wut2XD
We HOPE we'll be back. Every day Trump is in charge debases our country, our morals, our people. Idi Amin murdered many in Uganda.

That's 25 billion of our dollars Trump wants to waste. People can fly over the wall, sail around it, tunnel under it, bolt ladders to both sides, and ride in the back of a truck right through the gate. Better to hire enough Border Patrollers to check every truck. https://t.co/PG73O29mDm

#WhereAreTheGirls Has Trump already sold them? Is that why no one has seen them? Can we trust him with these children? Trump could have sent them to be ground into dog food for all we know. Find out before its too late! #FreeTheChildren #ImpeachTrumpPence #VoteThemOut2018 https://t.co/j6nX6mcPli
These kids will be deported when they reach 18 to a country where many won't speak the language or relate to the religion or culture, after being traumatized by being ripped away from their parents. Trump is ruining these kids's lives FOREVER. #FreeTheChildren #ImpeachTrumpPence https://t.co/Rx65tzkbJN
@BrianDahleCA #WhereAreTheGirls What has Trump done with the immigrant girls he has detained? Why aren't reporters allowed to see them? Is the Border Patrol using their rape table to rape them? You should investigate. Your job may depend on it. #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow

@alroker #WhereAreTheGirls? The girls among Trump's immigrant hostages seem to be missing. Shouldn't some reporter look into this? Thousands of young lives could be at stake. I know your main job is weather, but hopefully you know someone who can check into things.
@WillieGeist #WhereAreTheGirls? What has Trump done with the girls among his immigrant hostages? No one has seen them yet. Some reporter should check while there is still time to do something. Before Trump sells them to the highest bidder.
@hodakotb #WhereAreTheGirls? The girls among Trump's immigrant hostages seem to be missing. What have they done with them? The Border Patrol has a rape table, you know. I wouldn't put it past Trump to sell them to the highest bidder. #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #VoteThemOut2018
@NMoralesNBC #WhereAreTheGirls? The girls among Trump's immigrant hostages seem to be missing. What has Trump done to or with them? The Border Patrol has a rape table, you know. Will Trump sell them to the highest bidder? #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #VoteThemOut2018
@SavannahGuthrie #WhereAreTheGirls? Why is Trump hiding them? What has he done with them? This is scary like Boko Haram holding girls. The Border Patrol has a rape table you know. Trump might sell them. Can we trust him? I don't think so.
@JennaBushHager #WhereAreTheGirls? Trump may have disappeared the girls among his immigrant hostages. Has he sold them? Is the Border Patrol raping them on their rape table? What has happened to them? #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow
@laurawbush #WhereAreTheGirls The girls among Trump's immigrant hostages seem to be missing. What has Trump done with them? He could have sold them. The border patrol has a rape table. What's going on here? Will the world have to invade US to save them? Like Nazi Germany?
@BetoORourke #WhereAreTheGirls? What has Trump done with the girls among his immigrant hostages? Does anyone know? Horrible fates spring to the mind. Sold? The border patrol has a rape table. Are they raping the girls on it? #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #VoteThemOut2018
@MelaniaDiaries #WhereAreTheGirls? The girls among Trump's hostages seem to be missing. Where are they? What's being done to or with them? Don't you care about children?

@SenFeinstein #WhereAreTheGirls? The girls among Trump's immigrant hostages seem to be missing. Has Trump been selling them? Have the ICE agents been raping them? They have a rape table, after all. Will the world have to invade US to save these kids from Trump? Like Nazi Germany?
@IvankaTrump #WhereAreTheGirls ? The girls among your father's immigrant hostages seem to be missing. No one has been able to get in to see them. Has Trump been selling them? Where are they? If nothing is wrong why can't our legislators see them? Are they alive, or dead?
#WhereAreTheGirls? What has Trump done with the immigrant girls? Sold them? Are ICE agents raping them on the rape table? Why can't even our legislators see them? If nothing is wrong, why are they hiding them? #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #VoteThemOut2018 https://t.co/TBujKqI3zg
@realDonaldTrump #WhereAreTheGirls Trump? What have you done with them? Sold them already? Is that why no one is able to see the immigrant girls? Have you been down there shopping for a new mistress already? If there is nothing to hide, why are you hiding them? #ImpeachTrumpNow
#WhereAreTheGirls No one has been able to see the girls held by ICE. What are they doing to or with them? Rape? Sold? Why can't our lawmakers see them? A Democrat would be impeached already. #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow  #VoteThemOut2018 https://t.co/ecUxKZKpZg
#WhereAreTheGirls Why can't our lawmakers see the girls held by ICE? Are they being raped on the rape table? The FBI Hostage Rescue Team should liberate Trump's hostages, it's their job!

#WhereAreTheGirls No one has been able to get in to see the underage girls in ICE custody. Where are they? Is Trump selling them to Boko Haram? For wives? To brothels around the world? As servants? Why can't our lawmakers see them? Do you trust the Trump to not sell them? https://t.co/3i3yLJ63pJ

@RepJayapal What are you doing about the legal asylum seekers illegally imprisoned without charges or trial? Their children have been kidnapped by ICE agents and held dog kennels. If you don't do SOMETHING, then you aren't doing your job! The people will remember in November ...
@RepBarragan What are you doing for the legal asylum seekers being imprisoned without charges or trial? What are you doing about the children kidnapped and held in dog kennels by ICE? It's your job to be a check on and balance to the executive branch. Are you doing your job?
Let's challenge our legislators to try the cages for themselves. Maybe they'll have some compassion then. This is nothing short of state sponsored terror. Sessions is trying to scare people into staying home in countries overrun by gangs invented in &amp; exported from the USA. https://t.co/QgmAFm686Y
America deserves better. #25thAmendment #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #VoteThemOut2018 https://t.co/WsIUllufMv
Crossing the border by stealth is illegal. Presenting yourself at the border asking for asylum is legal. Taking someone's child away is kidnapping. The ICE agents should be arrested, Trump and Sessions too. Our police and the FBI should rescue the kids and their parents. https://t.co/S4DdWCXGDu
For Gorka? Protecting the Nazi way, of course. Gassed any globalists lately? When is the new Krystalnacht? America defeated the Nazis over 70 years ago Gorka. Hitler killed himself, why do you still look up to them? Why do you still wear their medal? You ARE the old order. https://t.co/ZZ7eFuTASJ

@algore You were the second highest leader in one of the best administrations America has ever had. Legal asylum seekers are being held in prison without trial. Their children are kept in dog kennels. Is America the new Nazi Germany? Are we turning legal immigrants sub-human?
@CoryBooker The legal asylum seekers entering America are being imprisoned without trial by the Trump administration and their children put in dog kennels. Is America to be the new Nazi Germany? This is as bad as Jim Crow or worse. What will YOU do about it?
@KamalaHarris What is being done about the Trump administrations abysmal treatment of legal asylum seekers? They're being imprisoned without trial, their children put in dog kennels like animals. Are they the new untermenschen? Are we ALL Nazis now? Are we losing America?
@SenFeinstein The treatment asylum seekers are receiving is worthy only of NAZIS. They come here LEGALLY and are imprisoned! Their CHILDREN are put in dog kennels until there is room in a CAMP! How long before America goes on a state sponsor of terror list? We're losing America!
Good, hopefully Manafort will roll over on Trump soon. Trump is turning America into a pariah state. How long before some country puts us on their state sponsor of terror list for our mistreatment of asylum seekers? They enter the country LEGALLY and we take their children away. https://t.co/EhwmZEwgeI
I'm sure that's not enough for blackmailing Trump. The Donald laundered money for Russians illegally, or murdered someone in Russia. What else would give Putin this kind of hold on him? Maybe Trump would be personally bankrupt without Russian money. #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow https://t.co/PiMZR2kfSL
So, Gorka, you've got immigrants in PRISON for entering our country LEGALLY and their children kept in DOG KENNELS until they can be put in CAMPS. Wouldn't the Fuhrer be proud! Your Nazi dreams are coming true! #25thAmendment #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #VoteThemOut2018 https://t.co/LOR6IX3tm7

Fall, fall, fall. November election. #VoteThemOut #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/1fYY2ai3Hd
The reporters are tired of your lies and ludicrous conspiracy theories Trump. The truth will out, get your house in order before the hammer falls. https://t.co/miKz8iZssV
#ImpeachTrumpNow #VoteThemOut https://t.co/BWeqr7ggei
We wish! #ImpeachTrump #VoteThemOut Not likely though. Trump will blame and fire anyone to protect himself. https://t.co/jYZMp3fGfl
Yeah, we should reserve our military to fight the #TrumpCult afterwards! #ImpeachTrump #VoteThemOut https://t.co/irqCWg0Oqa
#ImpeachTrump #VoteThemAllOut Before it's Heil Trump, and Trumpland uber alles! Maybe Pence will solve our Trump problem for us? After all if he can pardon himself after killing Trump, then President Pence can rule afterwards. Logical conclusion from Trump's claims. https://t.co/MJslGs3igL
Who would want to visit with the orange Hitler anyway? #ImpeachTrump #VoteThemAllOut https://t.co/zwxBEz8t2G
I guess we better start calling him Mitch Macchiavelli, the world's most evil turtle! #VoteThemOut #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/twgmTmqFMI
Say Donald, do you realize Pence can kill you and get away with it? When you die, he becomes President and can pardon himself! Better keep an eye on him, he might be getting tired of waiting to be President ... https://t.co/yoyJthl6Lo
If Trump's right about the President pardoning himself, then Pence can kill Trump, becoming President, then pardon himself. I wonder if Trump is smart enough to realize this? I guess the Secret Service needs to be ready to jump at all times. https://t.co/TyEyixtgSV
Not only that, but Trump doesn't love America enough to risk his skin, either! #ImpeachTrump #VoteThemOut https://t.co/2qbOSWZqOz
Maybe Pruitt plans to have the EPA pay Trump $1,000,000.00 for it? He can bribe his boss to keep him on with our money! https://t.co/VbfsrAI4Xf
Speaking of people dying, what happens if Pence kills Trump? If he becomes President Pence on Trump's death, does he get to pardon himself? That's the logical result of what Trump is claiming. Trump and the Secret Service better keep a careful eye on Pence! https://t.co/EYRgRxG4O1
#ImpeachTrump #VoteThemOut How about the old "power" salute? Fist in the air! Let's see how Trump likes that one! https://t.co/GM4tkyL4Ly
If the President can pardon himself, then Pence could kill Trump, making himself President Pence, and pardon himself. Is this the kind of world you want to live ( or maybe die ) in Trump? https://t.co/NXFTQDHmFD
Wow! Serious cuddle buddies! https://t.co/f6AtRtpUeT
Maybe Trump's afraid of having so many strong brown and black people near him? He's too cowardly to fire people face to face after all ... https://t.co/nQVeMKkEkS
I think they should use the old fist in the air power salute! We'll see how the NFL and Trump like THAT! https://t.co/k62Nvjb0Ux
Moronic conspiracy theories that expose mental illness? Wow, we're competing with Trump! Maybe we should have a contest to see who can come up with the wildest theory? Hmmm, maybe Melania's buried in the rose garden? No! She ran off with Mueller and Trump's hiding it! https://t.co/leCXSnjTQt
Hmmm, I wonder if there are any new, unexplained lumps in the rose garden these days? We might not see Melania above ground again. https://t.co/9qsbO5LM0M
Maybe, the point is to show how stupid the idea of the President pardoning himself is. No one is above the law. But just in case Pence believes it, maybe you ought to tell Trump and the Secret Service to watch him? Or just sit back and see what happens? https://t.co/iu0oscDfqq
The police could get a warrant. You comply with one of those or they shut you down, no more twitter. https://t.co/WmAMika9FB
Have you called the police? Death threats are against the law! If the locals can't find this guy, call the FBI, they can get the NSA involved. The NSA can find him if anyone can. It'll be fun to see his expression as they haul him away. https://t.co/Rn5qHxWS45
If the President can pardon himself, then Pence can kill Trump, making himself President Pence, then pardon himself. Maybe you should let the Secret Service know? Or maybe not? One way to deal with our Trump problem! https://t.co/7iFIfpByt8
The players should just use the old fist in the air power salute then! Better watch Pence, if he kills you, Trump, he becomes President Pence and can pardon himself! https://t.co/8An2WfGUyq
Do you guys think the President can pardon himself? Better watch Pence. If he kills Trump, becoming President Pence, he could then pardon himself! https://t.co/dRODOAwnEc
That means Pence could kill you, becoming President Pence, then pardon himself. Is this what you want, Trump? https://t.co/sSDQbM2Fus
Trump says the President can pardon himself, even for murder. That means you could kill him, becoming President, and pardon yourself. Think about it, President Mike Pence. https://t.co/oldeqvvDjT

The FBI warned Trump the Russians were trying to interfere in the election, but he claims they didn't. This has been public knowledge much longer than @realDonaldTrump's claim that they didn't warn him. https://t.co/s9NqvhqL9K
Thanks for the article, gives some good ideas. Do you think glitterbombing or whipped cream pie in the face is better? Surely being laughed at will take the wind out Nazi sails! Physical attacks are what they want, most likely. Makes them feel tough to pick fights, I'm sure. https://t.co/uXop2Rsg7O
Ah, but what if they are law abiding right up until the mass shooting, hmmm? That's why most mass shooter's guns were bought legally. https://t.co/P3lH57gp6n

Trump was elected by Russia. If we don't get rid of him soon America might cease to exist. #Impeach45 #VoteThemOut https://t.co/DXAP87nuMU
Trump's banana Republicans are a threat to America's sheer existence. #VoteThemOut #TrumpConspired https://t.co/sPLZpxHb0C
Protest is how this country got started. The Boston tea party was a protest! Restricting protest is as un-American as banning apple pie. Trump was only elected with Russian help. The NFL shouldn't even listen to him. #Impeach45 You know 45 is code for a swastika. #TrumpIsNazi https://t.co/g1xrHieVvU
Our country is in danger of being sold for parts like a stolen car. How much would Russia pay Trump to get Alaska back? Mexico might pay enough for California to fund the wall! What will Trump NOT do for money? Our YUGE deficit would be his excuse. #Impeach45 before its too late. https://t.co/RPs8xZyUI7
Question: would Trump be willing to sell your state, county, or city to the highest bidder? Each local government needs to save money so it can buy itself if necessary. Wouldn't Trump love to be rid of all the Democrat voters in California? We do have a YUGE deficit, good excuse. https://t.co/qkzxZ5xiqB

Yes, just like you're the least sarcastic! I LIKE sarcasm, by the way. "If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane" - Jimmy Buffet. With Trump as president, laughing at him may be our only ray of sunshine. https://t.co/f0zeZ7iPQQ
What was the original Boston tea party about? It was a protest. Protest was American before there was a USA. Banning protest is like banning apple pie, un-American! https://t.co/BL4EI9MOoL

NO ONE should ever feel they have to do ANYTHING they don't want to out of fear! Bullies need to be stood up to by EVERYONE! Giving in, even once, just encourages bullying! Everyone is responsible for their OWN decisions. No one should be blamed for someone else's decisions! https://t.co/Vra7pZKyAX
This is emotional arm twisting. No one should feel responsible for other people's choices. People threatening suicide can be a way to get what they want and give up nothing to get it. They don't have to become better people, only play your heart strings, and then you're stuck. https://t.co/VHdY1HSeAp

Women should feel free to stand up for themselves with no limit. "Make a scene" that's the lookout of whoever mistreated someone, not the victim! If you have misunderstood something you can apologize later. People should be afraid to mistreat women. Silence seems like permission. https://t.co/07ELI9KrfE

I must have been a bad doggie to get the spray. But seriously, I'm sorry I went off half cocked. I should have checked further before speaking.

I will try to be better. Next time I think I'm reading an insult directed at a SUICIDED gay person by a straight I will check before commenting. I hurt for Max. My emotions got the better of me. I'm sorry. https://t.co/rjbT5td74h
I was hurting over the death of someone who hurt so much they thought death was better than their life. Max is the one I hurt for. Calling my remarks snide shows you don't understand me or what I'm saying at all. I thought I was calling out an insult by a straight. https://t.co/lAGQTDTFUp
Good point. Thought I was within bounds. Thought I was correcting a fellow straight on his insulting language about a person who just died. Suicide is horrible, I was upset and went of half-cocked. I'm sorry. https://t.co/ylYAbO420b
Fine with me. Didn't mean to offend anyone. Hope you will accept my apology. I'm sorry. I'm sure this came at the worst of times. So sorry you were too late to save Max. His death is a horrible result of the intolerance of our society. https://t.co/DDzOmE3huL
Very true. Didn't mean to do that. Will be more careful in future. https://t.co/ND4bVKnHgw
One more time, I thought I saw a straight putting down a gay person who just DIED! https://t.co/Qkq4kLTPGd
Quite happy to honor their language when I realize they're the ones using it. Said hello to a black guy who said "What's up my nigga?" to me. I'm white, so I was shocked, but it was no insult, he just answered without looking. This was like that. I answered without looking. https://t.co/MfLy6uyPq4
It stands for "queer", obviously. That word bothers me when said by a straight though. The "N" word is OK for blacks to say, but offensive from whites, and I didn't know who I was talking to. God loves all people, I try to do the same. https://t.co/TQ4sKrlNTa
Of course not. Everyone seems to think I knew I was talking to a gay person. They can call themselves anything they want, it's not up to anyone else. Only been on Twitter since January and I didn't think to check the writers profile. For the umpteenth time, I'm sorry. https://t.co/F37NiIIbCz
@mompersisting I thought I heard a straight putting down a gay person who hurt so much he killed himself to make it stop. That hurt me, bad. Being straight I had to speak up. I was wrong. I hurt others with my assumption. I am sorry.

I reacted emotionally and without thinking. I hurt for Max. I thought someone was putting him down. I reacted without checking on what sort of person was speaking. I am sorry. I may not know what its like to be "queer", but I hurt for Max anyway. MAX IS DEAD, THAT IS AWFUL. https://t.co/iEa75SAKoi

Yes, jarring. I find the "N" word jarring, too. Turn around and find a black person said it, that's OK. Some straights have a hard time with the word "queer" for the same reason. Where I grew up that's an insult, no matter who you say it too. https://t.co/1OQJ9GKx6B

Sorry, didn't think I was talking to a gay person. Thought I was defending vulnerable people. Will be more careful in future. Assumptions are so easy to make, and hard to see until someone points them out. Hurts to see people mistreated just for what they are. Crying for Max. https://t.co/dPiik1fCuX
I know the feeling, thanks for 'splaining it to me. Didn't mean to hurt anyone, I thought I was standing up for vulnerable people. It hurts to hear how some people mistreat those who are different leading to suicides. Crying for Max. https://t.co/jsSgChGDxz
That helps, I don't mind the "N" word so badly when it comes from a black person either. I was afraid you were a straight person talking down to homosexuals. I guess we both made assumptions about our audience. Sorry, my bad. https://t.co/DDzOmE3huL
Castro took all the property of those who got out of Cuba, so they were penniless when they got to America. Republicans are generally more anti-Castro than Democrats so Cuban-Americans, at least, are quite often Republican. https://t.co/QEYManyLok
Adultery is clearly a sin according to the Bible. Abortion is not mentioned at all. God could have put that in if He wanted too. Where do "evangelicals" get off trying to reprioritize God's word? They're Pharisees, straining at gnats and swallowing camels. https://t.co/93zPP9oj4j
I find the term, "queer" very jarring and somewhat offensive. Would you call a black person by the "N" word? This seems like part of the problem to me. Homosexual would be better. I'm straight myself, but we need to do all we can to help those that are hurting, not harm them. https://t.co/mvYlMiJVzu

@Paf000001 Also, there is or was a town called Wynne in Arkansas.
My teachers used to pronounce it as "wine" when they first saw it. Forgot to mention fantasy novels by Katherine Kurtz, several novels centered on the magical Kingdom of Gwynnedd, "Camber of Culdi" for example. https://t.co/Rbw17rnIk5
@Paf000001 My branch of the family seems to have landed at Jamestown, Virginia before the Mayflower, but can't be entirely sure.
@Paf000001 Steve Wynne of hotel, casino, and sexual harassment fame I hear took the name, easier for Americans to pronounce? Ed Wynne, the actor, did too. Mary Wynne, in "From Here to Eternity" took the name too.
@Paf000001 The Wynne of that time had 11 children with his first wife, and 15 with the second. The second wife was in the Missouri area when she died I believe. My grandfather didn't always spell the name the same way sometimes Wynn, sometimes Wynne.
@Paf000001 Owain, son of the King of North Wales took that surname, blond or pale? In America the first known Wynne landed in Jamestown colony in 1620. Willam Penn's doctor had that name also. The farthest back my branch of the family has been traced in a complete chain was the revolution.
@Paf000001 Wynne started as Gwynnedd in Wales. Means light or fair. Oldest mention of the word I've seen goes back to the Roman occupation, the Welsh called the Irish raiders by that name back then. As a surname it started in the eleventh century.
But don't get it on you, it stinks to many people. https://t.co/7znfAJIc5g

No! Could you tell us about her? https://t.co/wuDiUKrJRd
Maybe Mueller can start doing genetic tests while he's at it. Could be surprising just who's been fathering who in the Trump clan. They're crooked about everything else, after all. https://t.co/YDCOqIsbLT
Shudder indeed! https://t.co/jlw8BOSPDK
Payback time in November! Spread the word! https://t.co/f53bMUkRfw
So do I. Let's encourage everyone to be excited about throwing the bums out by voting out all who don't listen to the people. https://t.co/aURsFxBiPN
Turn about is fair play. Let's vote those who would enslave us out, so they can feel what its like to be on the bottom. Payback time in November! Be there or be square! https://t.co/JNmTKCyVSP
I think the Republican politicians want to take us back to slaves and masters, so they can be the masters. Let's vote the enslavers out! https://t.co/sx90W1Jgx2
"The truth will set you free." This means slavery can come from lies. Let's fight for the truth by voting the liars out, people! https://t.co/TSkPhKkG3j
Yes, hallelujah! It's nice to hear from a sincere person instead of Pharisees calling themselves "evangelicals". https://t.co/N5yKJuACwP
Winter is coming ... https://t.co/F9BEw6A7QQ
Me, I'm looking forward to the charges, arrests, trials, and imprisonments! https://t.co/Kz4GBSMaR7
Yeah ... REALLY looking forward to November! The payback will be EPIC! https://t.co/8F9J6rKmlh
Wow! I guess the Donald forgot his corset today! https://t.co/Jf5g8VhWXX
A new broom sweeps clean. Let's replace all the leaders that aren't listening to the people and protecting us. https://t.co/TAc8108qRY
Let's encourage the young so they can lead us to a better, kinder America. https://t.co/SEUodXZO11
This is awful, let's vote out everyone who isn't doing something to keep us safe. https://t.co/OQmfo6oEMf
Vote or die people! https://t.co/gbsGb26KIY
Lovely idea. You should run for some office as soon as you're old enough yourself. The best way to make government responsive to the people is to replace the unresponsive ones with yourself. https://t.co/6rznJIKplw
And so it came to pass that Trump country became Dem country, for the people had come to see that their Great Orange Fool of a leader loved himself and money far more than he cared for them. https://t.co/ltVvWSJDGn
How Trump, Stormy, and Putin had a threesome? https://t.co/ARcXAld6jD
How fitting. Trump's sins have found him out. https://t.co/eIbv5ql9th
These protesters are the REAL patriots, protecting our republic from the corrupting power of money and making our government responsible to the people again. https://t.co/SHJLzEY2gH
Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. https://t.co/CNZ8R4m3S0
Too true! Do you suppose he's hiding abortions? Illegitimate Trump babies? Both? https://t.co/3Uu0ifNfno
Oh to be a fly on the wall when Trump finds out! Meltdown city! He'll be scared to death that the checks from Putin will stop! Maybe he'll have a breakdown due to fear of Polonium poisoning. Well its nice to see SOME Republicans STARTING to grow a little back bone. Vote them out! https://t.co/temyOqyclR
So much stupidity! How can I choose? One accused me of "judging" when I pointed out hypocrisy in claiming Christianity while supporting our Adulterer-in-Chief. Jesus said, "Go and sin no more.", but Trump does this again and again. He had two affairs simultaneously! https://t.co/w8PwIVOmV4
Our "Evangelicals" are nothing but Pharisees, straining out nats while swallowing camels. They pretend things are OK, while our Adulterer in Chief shows his true colors. https://t.co/oPa86X8b5t
I'm sure Newt thinks, "That should be my money! How do I get hold of it? After all I LOVE my money, and WORSHIP it." https://t.co/cgJCgiwg0l
Yes, terrible people led by Trump the ever more Terrible. https://t.co/41L5SMXcsi
Yay, Stormy Daniels! Trump sure has made for strange times, a porn star working to save the country from our "president"! https://t.co/2hlsnzj0YV
Yes! Change is good! Let's exchange our leaders from politicians who won't listen to representatives who will listen! They're supposed to work for US! https://t.co/pa3tXZklij
Yes! Cowards all! Trump can't stand up in front of the American people in person and explain why he chose policies the people hate. They might boo him or throw something! https://t.co/U1F5mgSxUV
The face of an American Nazi, retweet unless you love Nazis. https://t.co/NkbgkFyfe5
Yes! "Vote like your life depends on it" people! It probably does! If the nukes don't get you the fallout probably will! Trump and Bolton want a war with North Korea and don't care about the millions of Americans and others who will die as long as they can "win", and distract. https://t.co/2gfPYHWqHp
Ooh, I like "Department of da fence"! Trump showing his lack of IQ again. https://t.co/mKTZNXHo9X
Trump's a coward. When someone jumped on stage with him during the campaign he wore a Secret Service agent as a human shield. All his brave talk is just boasting. https://t.co/rjOPDWUh5x
Trump's got to be sweating about this one. He wants to boast about sleeping with the porn star, but it might make him less popular with his evangelical fans. https://t.co/8yWlOap7CP
Donald Trump showing his true colors: yellow belly and white flag! https://t.co/bWrqmxIKCg
Good! No wall. We should call it Trump's folly if it ever gets built. A 3rd century solution doesn't work in the 21st century. We have ladders, planes, and boats now. The smugglers dig tunnels also. https://t.co/qWRz6IVt00
Thank you Donald Trump and Republicans! Let's vote these people out before we return to the Dark Ages! They'd be fine with serfs and Lords because they think they'll be the Lords. https://t.co/wY3l9kl3ES
Trump showing his IQ. https://t.co/qvcieeUpie
And if they won't give us change, we'll change out our representatives for those who will listen to the people for a change. https://t.co/V9jUsNjGx1
Blue Tsunami coming! https://t.co/6rtSP6WQNe
Yes, let's vote the gun worshippers out! https://t.co/2UPm5snnzr
Yes! https://t.co/5vlDotkyQS
Me too. https://t.co/NB0TYetsQ5
Welcome to today's America, a nightmare that may get a lot worse any minute. https://t.co/hSijC9AAli

Their money or your life, which one is more important to you? https://t.co/GN60xRJs6r
Yeah! https://t.co/LqBkc7geB2
Amsterdam! Take that Trump! https://t.co/LIvGXIyTIy
Megalomaniac, sociopath, money worshipper, obstructor of justice, adulterer, bad example for the entire world, ... https://t.co/khb42OnUrh
Probably something bad for them: higher prices or a recession due to trade war, radioactive fallout from a real war, actual fighting by Trump's followers, ... https://t.co/VTkMhaG5b4
That's very good. Trump might have a heart attack, thus saving our Republic. https://t.co/vMJPn06kIs
The National Security ADVISOR can't start wars anyway. Hopefully Bolton won't advise Trump to start any either. https://t.co/AGqjN1BsEc
We've got to do better this time people, or we won't have a Republic any more! Vote or die! https://t.co/Uq2Yxa3YOP
Ah, ha! https://t.co/w93wHJFeLo
The corporate executives will always do what is best for themselves, not the company, nor the country. Sad! https://t.co/35zhuF2wMZ
Making America Intolerant Again Pence? I'm glad John Oliver's book is outselling yours. https://t.co/FzaQq9o0f4
This is important people! If you're not registered yet, get on it! Even if you're not sure who to vote for yet. You may come to a decision before Election Day, but can't vote because you're not registered. Vote or it's all your fault! https://t.co/8eMRySraA8
Calling names doesn't win friends nor influence people, just pushes them away. Women have gotten a raw deal for thousands of years, at least. Hopefully that is beginning to change. https://t.co/djQpLhNvdp
Amplifying voices is cool, but could get old after a while. https://t.co/8yZXVh84nO
An exercise in voice amplification, hmmm? I'll bite. https://t.co/9FwBv4AJOc
They might be able to do so. Hopefully our people are working to protect us. You never know with Trump in charge. https://t.co/2SKZF5NCe5
Yes, much of what Trump is doing will hit his base the hardest. Hopefully they'll admit that to themselves before Election Day. https://t.co/77RCw3H3ER
Human selfishness and greed may be the death of this planet yet. https://t.co/5V728uvv0F
Certainly, you could spend all your time following people back. Let those who have fewer followers or more time throw the FBR parties. https://t.co/PvBB8rDjuB
This is a joke. Makes Trump sound even dumber than he really seems and Putin is WAY to honest. Having Putin suddenly switch to German, "naturlich", is a give away also. Nice joke, though. Quite funny in places. https://t.co/4FQGjlOaBa
Very sad! But as we all suspected. https://t.co/zjvFZKscRh
Yes! Release the tax returns! Or we all see what a liar Trump is! And a tax cheat too! Vote the Trumpanistas out! Then Impeach him! https://t.co/nRNRRYNXxw
Yeah! Vote out all of Trump's swamp creatures! Then we can impeach him! Vote or die people! https://t.co/JFFxYIbCeq
Trump conned America, let's make the punishment severe enough that no one else will try again. The traditional punishment for treason is death. Maybe we'll have mercy because of his age and just imprison him for the rest of his life. Trump has earned this and more. Vote or die! https://t.co/QsZSI54F9W
Go YouTube! Responsible gun buyers can take a gun safety class if they want. This might save hundreds of lives! Boycott the NRA! Vote Trump's swamp creatures out! Only then can we impeach him! Vote or die people! https://t.co/RyaJ6dM8OG
We need single payer health care. Overhead will be cheaper, don't have to figure out who to pay for or not. Might be cheaper than current system, certainly better. Republicans hate it because it will help "those nasty poor people" even if it does save money. Vote or die people! https://t.co/AYYLkjYyqd
Delete Facebook, yes! Fine them more than they are worth for what they've done. Of course Trump would just turn this into more tax cuts for one percenters. Vote Trump's swamp monsters out! Then impeach Trump. Vote or die people! https://t.co/ZMmlZgOqDZ
Climate change is real and caused by humans. - the scientists of the world. Republicans just don't like this because it might cost rich people money to fix the problem. The rest of us, who will be the ones suffering most, they don't really care about. Vote or die people! https://t.co/PqAoN9EUHz
Sewer rat Barbie for communication director? Heaven forbid! This woman believes in "alternative facts", her words, not mine. Well I guess Trump's coms shop has been a lie factory since the first day. For example, "This was the biggest inauguration crowd ever, period." Vote! https://t.co/x8QXh5JKp5
Oh, yeah! Very true! https://t.co/04DMHgM8y3
LOL funny! Especially the "small pickle". https://t.co/dKGAV9sMrJ
Good point! If you do what is right just because it is right that is REALLY moral! https://t.co/nR0orMMzkC
