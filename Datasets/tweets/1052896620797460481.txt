Yesterday, I voted on legislation to reopen the Treasury Department and IRS and ensure that our hardworking families in Pennsylvania receive their tax refunds promptly. I will continue to work to serve our district and restore a functioning American government. 2/2
Today is Day 20 of the shutdown and PA families should not suffer while we get our government functioning again. Within hours of taking office, I voted on a funding package previously passed by Senate Republicans to reopen the federal government and end this shutdown. 1/
PA-06, please join us this Saturday for a town hall in Exton. We will introduce our district staff and I will provide an update on the first few days of this new session of Congress. If you have any questions, please call my office at (202) 225-4315 https://t.co/PphoOGyL6g

Impromptu Wednesday morning update with my friend @RepCunningham as we navigate the halls of Congress! https://t.co/NsCWnW7mMC
RT @wcdailylocal: The Chester County Food Bank, whose mission is to end hunger as best it can in the county, is preparing for what could be‚Ä¶
Millions more are unable to access services our government should be providing. We have already voted to reopen the government. I will continue to work to serve our district and restore a functioning American government. 4/4
By holding our government hostage, the President is harming our national security, hurting the very citizens he promised to elevate, and crippling our economy. This shutdown has already lasted 18 days and 800,000 federal workers are at risk of losing their paychecks. 3/
I am a 3rd gen veteran and understand that we must protect all of our borders (land, air and sea) and pass bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform, but there are more efficient and cost-effective ways to securing our borders than by building a costly southern border wall. 2/
Within hours of being sworn-in for the 116th Congress, the House passed bipartisan legislation that Senate Republicans had already passed in December to fund and reopen the government. This shutdown, which is affecting millions of families, is a manufactured crisis. 1/
Gun violence is an issue that has been plaguing our communities for far too long.		I was proud to join the Gun Violence Task Force and am proud to support #HR8, a commonsense bipartisan proposal for universal background checks that is a key first step to curbing gun violence. https://t.co/wOUal5UBHQ
Visited the @ccfoodbank this morning to meet with staff on the impact the shutdown is having here in PA06. Thousands are being affected, including 25,000 Chester County SNAP recipients.		We must end this shutdown and reopen our government. https://t.co/G4NdRkJwYy

Valley Forge and all national parks are national treasures. The appropriations package I voted for last week that passed the House would have funded the Department of Interior and reopened the parks. 		The government must reopen. 3/3
We love our open spaces and parks in Southeastern PA. Yesterday, I drove through Valley Forge National Park and experienced the effects of the shutdown for park visitors.  Additionally, the local economy depends on our fully functioning parks for businesses to thrive. 2/
Today is Day 17 of the shutdown and it is affecting millions of families. If you've been affected by the shutdown, please tweet your stories to us. As the shutdown continues, I will continue to bring you stories on how this is impacting families and businesses here in SEPA 1/
Eagles march on! #FlyEaglesFly
Around 800,000 federal employees are working without pay or are furloughed during this shutdown. Families and businesses are being affected across our country. We must end this shutdown and re-open our government.
We must reopen our government. People's livelihoods are being impacted. https://t.co/qMkPjyVymo

Welcome to Longworth 1218 - your new PA06 DC office! https://t.co/25XabV9G5m
Started office set-up with some personal items on the eve of swearing-in. A special place for the teddy bear that my dad brought as a boy when he left war-torn Poland bound for a new life in America. And an "Office Kit" that my daughter got me for our Secret Santa exchange https://t.co/PvI3GDhcZl
The 116th Congress begins tomorrow and one of the first things we must do is restore a functioning government to and for the People. To that end, I submitted a letter today requesting that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over. https://t.co/MFxPQedD07
Excited to be sworn-in tomorrow and join you in working to fight for PA families! https://t.co/jwVlI6de1y
...on crucial legislative items including expanding access to affordable and quality healthcare, bringing good jobs with good benefits to our community, passing commonsense gun safety measures, fixing our broken immigration system, and taking care of our veterans. 2/2
Tomorrow the new session of Congress begins and there‚Äôs work to be done. One of the first steps we must take is restoring a functioning government to and for the People. I look forward to working in the new Congress on a bi-partisan basis and fighting for PA-06... 1/
