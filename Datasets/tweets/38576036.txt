@SenatorCollins Please do not support a tax reform bill that repeals the ACA mandate. Self-insured families like mine will be hit hardest and cannot weather more increases.

@JohnCornyn Thank you for donating blood.  Now kindly flush the ACHA and focus on reducing healthcare costs (which were already a problem pre-ACA.)
@JohnCornyn Inflation = a pre-ACA issue but GOP is to blame as well. GOP virulent anti-ACA rhetoric depressed enrollment &amp; mostly blocked Medicaid exp.

@RyanKurth3 @cindievaccaro @GregAbbott_TX I have lived in CA for 20+ years.  Every state is a mess by some metrics.  But bankrupt, we are most definitely not. CA GDP dwarfs TX, btw.
@RyanKurth3 @cindievaccaro @GregAbbott_TX Hell does not exist.
@SpeakerRyan Oh, and, in my experience, Anthem is a horrible insurer. Been there, done that, threw away that T-shirt.
@SpeakerRyan Iowa and Missouri didn't expand Medicaid or promote ACA enrollment. Check out states that did for better ACA results. GOP wants ACA to fail.
@BetoORourke @HurdOnTheHill  This TX-23 constituent strongly supports Dodd-Frank and I wish you did, too. I do agree tweaks needed for truly small banks.
@cindievaccaro @GregAbbott_TX I love CA and TX.  Both great states in very different ways.

@cindievaccaro @GregAbbott_TX Don't believe everything they tell you. CA hasn't even come close to bankruptcy (unlike several other states.)
@cindievaccaro @GregAbbott_TX So, not everything is...bigger in Texas 😉
@cindievaccaro @GregAbbott_TX CA is not bankrupt; CA appreciates our immigrants -- we would be f*ck*d without them. CA GDP = $2.5 trillion; TX GDP = $1.6 trillion.
@GregAbbott_TX I priced insurance in TX &amp; CA this year. CA = a dozen insurers, dozens of plans, subsidy; TX, 1 insurer, about 5 plans, 30% higher rates.
@GregAbbott_TX Texas has one of worst uninsured rates in the US because its legislators lie about ACA.
@GregAbbott_TX CA promoted ACA, created great state exchange, and expanded Medicaid.  Uninsured plummeted &amp; consumers have more choices for less $ than TX.

@SenateGOP Why? CA great state exchange. Promoted it.  Expanded Medicaid.  Our uninsured #s plummeted and every insurer wants a piece of robust market.
@SenateGOP In TX this year, I had a choice of one insurer and 5 plans. In CA, I had more than a dozen insurers and dozens of plans FOR LESS $.
@SenateGOP There's a pattern to states w/ this problem: 1) no state exchange, 2) refused to expand Medicaid, 3) badmouthed ACA/discouraged enrollment.

@sonkevjas @SenThomTillis @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I live along the border, and it's definitely not MY will.  #NoWall
@rj47972891 @SenThomTillis @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Trump understands nothing about the border.  A wall is wasteful + ineffective. Ask people who live and work along the border what is needed.
@SenThomTillis @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I live w/in 45 min of the proposed wall. Impractical, wasteful proposal. Continue w/ technology + Border Patrol + help Mexico fight cartels.
@tedcruz I am a Big Bend-area constituent.  If you support building a wall through my stretch of the border, know I will fight you tooth and nail.
Beautifully written....	https://t.co/Pobt3TRKuJ
RT @tedlieu: Congress not exempt from Obamacare. But #GOP wants to exempt Congress from #Trumpcare. That's how you know it sucks. https://t…
@tedlieu WTF...the hypocrisy is mind-boggling.
@SpeakerRyan How much of Congress' time is spent on bills like the one that declared today #nationalhighfiveday?  What % of my taxes paid 4 that "work?"
@teezily Shame on you. Teezily offers no support or remedy for fraudulent T-shirt campaigns.

RT @RonWyden: .@realdonaldtrump if this gets 18 million retweets, will you release your tax returns?
@SenBlumenthal Trump has made it very clear how he likes his women: submissive, loyal and reflecting all glory back to him.
@JFarrarDist148 I ❤ #HB4260. As a new West Texan, thank you for your work in the TX state legislature. I am regularly horrified by many of your colleagues.
@BetoSenate2018 I bet $50 on Beto. I support his pro-LGBTQ, pro-women, pro-medical marijuana positions, and he understands TX borderlands.
@BetoORourke I donated $50 to Beto 4 Senate! Support Senators who demonstrate bipartisanship. Cruz/Cornyn do not; I'm tired of auto-replies.
@kategant7 @reniburton @SallyTCSheriff @ICEgov Thank you. I reviewed.  Tell me if I am wrong.  I see charged child molesters but none convicted. Isn't it up to a judge to allow/deny bail?
@MarshaBlackburn By making your Tweet comments private, you show you're afraid to stand by your Tweets in the face of debate. Nice move.
@MarshaBlackburn ISPs donate a lot more to GOP than Google and other tech cos.  Some of us can smell the BS in the gaps between what both GOP and Dems say.
@MarshaBlackburn Much of what you say is true, but it does not change the fact that it was repealed as a FU to Obama, and at the behest of the ISP lobby.
@SenThomTillis Live with the consequences.
@senorrinhatch I agree. My objections and my support for a #Gorsuchfilibuster stem from his record interpreting the law. More conservative than Scalia = NO
@SenatorFischer This is GOP bullsh*t rhetoric. The private sector innovates, but it also cheats and screws people to make a buck. Regulations = protection.
@SpeakerRyan I am a woman. You seem hell bent on giving me choices I don't want (e.g school vouchers) and taking away choices I do (e.g. reproduction.)
@kategant7 @reniburton @SallyTCSheriff Again, you make allegations with no source.
@HurdOnTheHill You seem to be hard at work REPEALING bills in order to take away my clean water, Internet privacy, and access to healthcare/contraception.
@kategant7 @reniburton @SallyTCSheriff In regards to a child rapist, I empathize if one was released into your community, but you did not provide details sufficient to discuss it.
@kategant7 @reniburton @SallyTCSheriff I live in TX, but not Travis County. But I have experience with the impacts of overzealous and largely unchecked ICE enforcement.
@kategant7 @reniburton @SallyTCSheriff Immigration enforcement rests with feds. There is NO basis for federal gov't to compel local or state gov't to assist in that work. Period.
@mike_pence  I'd rather see Mike "Hot" Pence as VP. He wouldn't vote against my access to basic healthcare. GOP will pay at the ballot box.
@SenRonJohnson @POTUS Come visit my section of the SW border, and I'll show you good men and women of the border patrol doing a better job than any wall can do.
@RepArrington @VP Keep it up.  We will vote you out. And if you aren't our rep, we will fund your opponents.
@RepArrington @VP I am so mad I could spit. You didn't defund abortion, you defunded my access to contraception and basic health and prenatal services. Jerk.
@SenatorCollins Thank you for separating the issues of abortion from women's healthcare and standing up for women everywhere!!
@lisamurkowski Thank you for separating the issues of abortion from women's healthcare and standing up for women everywhere!!
@SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi Most Americans REALLY want to see you work together to fix the #ACA.  Keep the ideology out of our healthcare.
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS @VP @SecPriceMD @HouseGOP No Ryancare for me!  Let's fix the ACA instead.  Otherwise, future Dems will go single-payer.
@PRyan Congress is practically the only job you've ever held, and it shows. #Ryancare shows a lack of understanding of the free market.
@PRyan It is time to end your presidential hopes, if not your political career.  #Ryancare is a mistake.
@SpeakerRyan Here's an idea ~ STOP playing russian roulette with my healthcare. #Ryancare will make people beg to get #Obamacare back.
@HouseCommerce @SpeakerRyan #Obamacare is okay. If you weren't so partisan, you'd fix it instead of replacing it with something waaay worse!
@SpeakerRyan If this awful RyanCare passes, you can kiss all your presidential aspirations goodbye.  This will be your personal Waterloo.
@RepArrington Taxpayer $ DOES NOT fund abortions now. Stop w/ blatantly untrue partisan BS. Some people don't know u are LYING &amp; MISLEADING.
@POTUS Meals on Wheels is a failed gov't program? My mother (84) and father (82) deliver them to people who wouldn't eat w/o them. SOOO MAD.

@RoguePOTUSStaff Unsurprising; I offer my empathy and this: Fantasize about him in leg irons, and keep up the good work.  #resist
@SenAlexander @Tennessean States that expanded Medicare, created an exchange &amp; promoted, enrolled far more people = more insurers, lower $$$
@SenAlexander @Tennessean If TN had created its own state exchange and promoted it widely, Tennesseans might well not have this problem.

@jiminhofe Even her home state of Michagan sees she is a failure. It's good to know that the Senate has been bought and paid for. MID-TERMS!
@RandPaul How about guaranteed coverage with no out of pocket costs? A few of us would prefer that to a 40-page policy favoring insurers.
@lisamurkowski @usedgov As a rural resident (charters/vouchers do nothing for us) I applaud your NO vote on DeVos.  Thank you!
@SenAlexander I expect your re-election results may be tied to how correct you are on that assessment.  I can see the mid-term ads now.
@SenatorLankford Have u noticed that a huge % of Americans don't support a number of his nominees (GASP) &amp; might support their slow-walking?
@SenatorLankford @POTUS nominees have 100s of pages of disclosures, assets to divest &amp; controversies to spare...these things take time!
@SenatorLankford  Nothing bothers me more than being disingenuous.  Maybe @POTUS should choose non-billionaires.

@lisamurkowski THANK YOU for your courage to reject an unqualified nominee, Betsy DeVos. Charters/vouchers are useless for rural America!
@SenThomTillis Urban charters=no better overall than public; Vouchers=useless in rural areas. School choice not improving ed where I live.
@SenJoniErnst Easier access to birth control...but I pay instead of my insurance? Sounds like disguised discrimination against poor women.
@Nordstrom Whether or not it was political decision, thrilled to see Trump brands off your shelves. Very loyal Nordstrom cardholder/buyer.
@SenatorHeitkamp I am truly empathetic for coal miners, but let's retrain workers rather than delude them that coal is not a dying industry.
@SenatorHeitkamp Some of us prefer clean water.  Unless Congress wishes to directly subsidize it, natural gas is cheaper.
@SenThomTillis Idealogues like DeVos do not do #bipartisanship. They steamroll. And when they lack critical thinking, they are dangerous.
@SenThomTillis Please #StopDeVos. I fully agree that we need #bipartisanship in DC, but this Cabinet nominee is unqualified AND divisive.

@SenRonJohnson Everyone with eyes can see that Betsy DeVos is unqualified to run the Department of Ed, and my eyes are on Congress' votes.
@SenToddYoung from Lancaster, PA. My family = Hershey. Please vote NO on Betsy DeVos. She is the most unqualified of all POTUS nominees.
