Fact check, @tedcruz: People saying they *don't remember* a small, unremarkable party is very different to saying they *weren't at* the party.
"When you have conflicting testimony you look to the evidence." YES @tedcruz THAT WAS WHAT AN FBI INVESTIGATION WOULD HAVE COLLECTED.  #KavanaughHearings
Kavanaugh's family wouldn't have had to hear those things yesterday if you -  or a single one of your colleagues - refused to vote for him until there was an FBI investigation,  @SenTedCruz. #Kavanaughhearings

Grassley barking about how this is a sham bc DiFi honored Dr Ford's request for privacy is 100% not the point, and it's grossly inappropriate, shameful &amp; disrespectful to Ford, who has every right to decide how &amp; when to speak up to whom about her assault. #KavanaughHearings

Congratulations to all the 6th grade basketball coaches out there, who just found out this qualifies them to be a SCOTUS nominee. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Kavanaugh: "I was deeply impressed by the president's careful attention to the nomination process and by his thorough attention to his nominees"	...the process outsourced to the Heritage Foundation? Does this count as perjury already?
What does Sen @maziehirono say when asked why Dems are putting up such a fight against Kavanaugh, with a Republican majority in Senate? "Some battles are fighting,  regardless of the outcome."
.@SenBlumenthal: “That’s not anywhere in the rules.”	Grassley: “But where does it say that’s NOT the rule, though??”	Ah yes the Senate’s famous Air Bud Rule. https://t.co/TgGXm6iTSo

Up next we’ve got @SenWhitehouse giving an exceptional rundown on the history of the corporate takeover of the Supreme Court. It should make any Senator representing the PEOPLE rethink confirming not just Kavanaugh but any conservative judge with endorsements like Kav’s.

Overseas absentee voters ALREADY assume (incorrectly) that their votes aren’t counted / only counted in close elections. Even if odds are in GOP’s favor in OH12, it’s important to reinforce absentee/provisionals ARE counted, and these votes decide elections- Ohio's 12th included.
THE reason everyone except Balderson and Trump say the race is officially too close to call is because those ballots ARE counted! In fact, absentee ballots can arrive as late as Aug 17. This is especially important for overseas voters who #votefromabroad in v far away places.
Suggesting that the race is over in #OH12 does absentee/provisional voters a disservice by suggesting that their votes won’t have an impact on the election.
Yes! We’re proud of the voters, @dannyoconnor1, @OHDems and how close the raise is! But IS. Present tense.
Hi @Dchinni @salbro: Great @NBCNews piece re: the rising #bluewave!		But this: "Of course, Aug is not Nov and Dems lost in OH on Tues. But #OH12 should never have been close and the tightness of that race is enough to put districts like it on wave watch."	 https://t.co/IEkcPoM12O

@moppety @erichmcelroy BTW: we encourage EVERYONE abroad to go through VoteFromAbroad &amp; FVAP bc the *overseas* absentee ballot request (aka FPCA) ensures your vote is counted &amp; allows additional accommodations.
@moppety @erichmcelroy When selecting your "classification" you probably want to choose "I live abroad and my return is not certain." If your voter registration was rejected before bc you said you’ve “never resided” in the state, try to re-apply as above.
@moppety @erichmcelroy Background: All US citz abroad have a right to vote in federal elections thx to Military &amp; Overseas Voters Act, but 14 states don't offer provisions if you never lived in US (ugh). The FPCA form on VoteFromAbroad &amp; FVAP avoids the specific point causing problems in the 14 states.
@moppety @erichmcelroy Good news Doc: There's hope for your voter status! Please register &amp; request your ballot via https://t.co/83LXiK8hjZ (our pref) or https://t.co/Rb076rwNP7.

How will you spend your refund this year? Most Americans abroad owe nothing on tax day or even get money back, but byzantine tax filings mean they’ll spend their refund on a tax preparer. Read what Americans abroad told us about filing their US returns: https://t.co/fxhlkj1IRH

@jgcOCANADA - Requires PA send your ballot at least 45 days before an election	- Allows you to vote via Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) if you do not receive your ballot	Many states also allow overseas voters more time to submit and/or to return their ballots electronically.
@jgcOCANADA - Protects your ballot in a recount (a ballot w/o a corresponding FPCA form could be challenged in a close election)	- Ensures you receive all ballots for the yr, incl primaries, special &amp; runoff elections	- Allows you to receive ballots electronically
@jgcOCANADA Aha! Tx for details. This is a key reason we suggest using https://t.co/83LXiK8hjZ, which helps you fill out an FPCA form rather than a standard absentee ballot request. The FPCA form (Fed Post Card Application) is specifically for overseas voters &amp; offers unique advantages:
@jgcOCANADA If you could let us know your county (you can DM if you prefer), we can contact your Local Elections Office to confirm. Tx!
@jgcOCANADA Hi JGC: Do you request a general absentee ballot (example: sent to a relative in the US who forwards it to you) or have you used vfa or similar website to request a ballot as an abroad voter? If the latter, you shouldn't need to request more than 1/yr.
This is why we urge EVERYONE to request their ballot via https://t.co/83LXiK8hjZ NOW. 	✅Yes, now and not in November. 	✅Yes, even if you receive a ballot w/o requesting annually. 	✅Yes, even if you just did it in 2017.	#votefromabroad #GOTV https://t.co/Pr6W73BR7j

@g_lanktree It's actually a v unfair system. These aren't rich tax cheats. They're Americans who want what's fair, who deserve to keep their citizenship
@g_lanktree Who else faces unfair challenges? Retirees on fixed incomes. Spouses receiving alimony to support their kids. People who are self-employed.
@g_lanktree However most are paying a tax consultant, and most are paying the consultant over $500/year -- just to tell the US they don't owe anything.
Hi @g_lanktree about this: https://t.co/0nFJ9GEB9Q we conducted a survey of over 4k Americans abroad and 59% said they earned under 100k.

Which means that the very PRESENCE of a gun in a home increases the likelihood of a successful suicide attempt. #GunControlNow #DAResists
But when someone tries to commit suicide with a gun, they are successful 90% of the time. #GunControlNOW #DAResists
Here's the thing: Most suicide attempts are rash decisions. The vast majority of people who survive a suicide attempt will never try again.
