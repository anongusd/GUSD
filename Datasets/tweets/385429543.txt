The inability of the Republican controlled Congress and White House to keep our government funded is a gross display of willful incompetence. The nation can look forward to having a Democratically controlled House to bring order to Washington in 2019. #TrumpShutdown

In the 11th hour, after many compromises had been made in order to produce a robust and essential funding bill, the president pulled the rug out from under us, and House Republicans – a majority of whom supported the bill just hours before – fell in line.
I voted against this legislation, not just because of the inclusion of the excessive border wall funding, but because this is not how our government should function.
Instead, they offered their own version of the bill, which included $5 billion for the president’s wasteful border wall.
Tonight, House Republicans gave in to pressure from the president and jeopardized our government’s stability. The Senate already passed a bipartisan funding measure, but House Republicans refused to bring that bill to the floor.

Hope to see you Sunday for a discussion with @MClyburnFCC on #NetNeutrality! https://t.co/N0zDsFlahN
As we conclude #BlackHistoryMonth, let's continue to tell the stories of the countless African Americans who have helped to shape the course of our nation's history, and let's commit to building upon the progress our country has made on the path towards equality.
We have a responsibility to do all that we can to protect our planet. I’m proud to have earned a score of 97% on the 2017 #LCVScorecard.
A free and #openinternet is crucial to the free flow of ideas and the future of our economy. #NetNeutrality protections serve as a safeguard for free speech and a catalyst for innovation. That’s why I’m proud to support legislation to #SavetheInternet. https://t.co/7BVFWqr1Xs
Hope to see you this Sunday at 3 PM in Antioch at my #NetNeutrality Town Hall with @MClyburnFCC! I look forward to hearing from you and discussing how we can move forward in the fight for a free and #openinternet. https://t.co/eNex1XyiVl
A week ago, the lives of the students in #Parkland, FL were forever changed. These brave young people are speaking out tonight at the #ParklandTownHall and Congress needs to listen. We must take action and pass common sense gun reforms now. #StudentsDemandAction
We grieve for the lives lost in the #ParklandShooting. Every day Congress fails to enact commonsense #GunReform legislation, it fails to prevent these tragedies. Each time we send thoughts &amp; prayers, we are reminded that thoughts &amp; prayers are simply not enough.#GunReformNow
