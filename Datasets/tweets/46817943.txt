Earlier today Clinton took HyVee donuts to volunteers in Des Moines, thanking them for all their hard work.
Afterward I bumped into Clinton at her hotel and she was all smiles, still wearing her sunglasses and parka. Seemed in very good spirits.

@DMBismysanity thanks for watching! Convos like this are very important to answering this almost impossible Q of how to stop this.
@DMBismysanity I've heard psychologists say shooters wld just find a diff "motive" to do it. Motive is to terrorize society writ large.
@DMBismysanity def see your point ... But maybe he would've found another target? "motive" may just be an excuse to do something terrible.
@DMBismysanity @BVGamble certainly motive of racism clear in # of crimes. But in mass killings mental proba may be primarily responsible.
@DMBismysanity @BVGamble UCSB shooter "motive" was sexism, Sandy Hook was bullying, SC racism. Real motive is to flip off society.
@DMBismysanity @BVGamble the point article makes is racism (or bullying etc) very secondary to psychological issues.
