As I have voiced to this Administration repeatedly, I strongly believe securing our border should not be done at the expense of previously funded military construction projects.
However, I believe it is a dangerous precedent for the President to be forced to declare a national emergency because Congress refuses to provide necessary funding to protect our country.
I supported this funding deal as a step towards securing our border, which we absolutely must do.
Since I was elected to Congress, nearly 10K jobs have been added @WrightPattAFB + thousands of additional jobs to support the important work being done there.

@cboyes1987 Thanks for your comment. I have been working to alleviate those cuts and it seems this is a step in the right direction.
@jimmsans Yes, we must continue to cut spending. I think this is a positive first step and provides a stable budget for the next 2 years.
@BrianVJarvis Mayor, this seems to be a positive first step in doing just that and providing a two year budget baseline to plan from.
@jimmsans It appears the overall deal would reduce the deficit by $23B while restoring needed funds to our national security.
Going through the proposed budget deal. Seems to offset many sequestration cuts and protect thousands of jobs at WPAFB. Your thoughts?
