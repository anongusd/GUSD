@MikeRitt102 @SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Must be confusing me with Republicans because that's what Republicans are.
@ar15m4mid @SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Republicans are hypocrites.
@Megan4MAGA @evrgreensparky @SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Never said I was a victim I had to put up with right wing rhetoric for thirteen years.
@Try_Facts_Libs @SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Your confusing me with Republicans they are the fascist and last I did my research more red states are socialist than blue states.
@Try_Facts_Libs @SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Republicans steal truth and facts your just too delusional and naive to accept that fact.
@FoxNews @MarshaBlackburn @DiamondandSilk @foxnewsnight FOX NEWS is FAKE NEWS.
@SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Once you put up with a Republican for thirteen years you would understand but until then go work for a Republican for thirteen years and tell me how that worked out for you because it didn't work out for me.
@Try_Facts_Libs @SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Republicans own that not Democrats you just can't handle the truth that Republicans are nothing but name calling bullies thugs and punks.
@aMOMynous2015 @FoxNews True but most conservatives I know personally are not much different than the one I put up with for thirteen years.
@thumperalpha @mike_Zollo @thebradfordfile If you worked and put up with a Republican for thirteen years you would understand but you didn't so go work for a Republican for thirteen years and tell me how that worked out for you.
@oshekay2 @mike_Zollo Republicans don't make sense.
@evrgreensparky @SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Roseanne is a trump supporter and was called a joyless liberal and she just proved my point that Republicans are nothing but name calling bullies thugs and punks.
@mike_Zollo Just proved my point that Republicans are nothing but name calling bullies thugs and punks with that marxists name and what's ironic about that is most red states are socialist than blue states if that's not hypocritical than I don't know what is.
@SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Being called a joyless liberal is not name calling then either your delusional like most Republicans and trump supporters are or you are in denial like most Republicans and trump supporters are.
@DamianEudy @SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC I'm not a lunatic your confusing me with a trump supporter.
@SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC You called me a joyless liberal and you proved my point when you said that.
@mike_Zollo Your promotion fear based right wing propaganda.
@SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC I said that just to prove a point and you just proved my point that Republicans are nothing but name calling bullies thugs and punks and if you worked for one for as long as I did you would understand but you wouldn't since you didn't put up with one for thirteen years.
@mike_Zollo More fear based right wing propaganda.
@SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC I am a proud liberal and at least I'm not a Republican name calling bully thug and a punk like most Republicans and trump supporters are.
@SparkleSoup45 @thebradfordfile @therealroseanne @RoseanneOnABC Buch of trump supporting brown nosers.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Sean Hannity is a joke just like your presidency is.
@RodStryker @thebradfordfile @USRepLong @DiamondandSilk Conservative commentators are what's wrong with this country and they are fascust.
@wendygcbn @700club 700 club is just as bad as FOX NEWS and what's really sad and pitiful is they say their Christian but promote fear based right wing propaganda.
@aMOMynous2015 @FoxNews Your on the wrong side sadly.
@aMOMynous2015 @FoxNews Republicans are nothing but name calling bullies thugs and punks and I would know that since I worked for one for thirteen years and put up with his right wing rhetoric every day and sadly most Republicans I know are not much different  same with trump supporters.
@mitchellvii Drain the Republican party and its alt right supporters.
@aMOMynous2015 @FoxNews Never said CNN is FOX NEWS is right wing and FOX NEWS is not even a licensed NEWS network unlike CNN which is.
@drazowsky @mike_Zollo Trump won't get a second term he is a deplorable xenophobic moron, bully thug and a punk like most Republicans are.
@thumperalpha @mike_Zollo @thebradfordfile Republicans are nothing but name calling bullies thugs and punks and I would know that since I worked for one for thirteen years and put up with his right wing rhetoric every day.

@aMOMynous2015 @FoxNews I don't watch right wing propaganda for the same reason I don't eat out of the toilet.
@mike_Zollo @thebradfordfile Your side thinks white supremacists nationalism is ok and trump called them fine people and that's why the Republican party is pathetic.
@SaysHummingbird @surfchicken16 Me bad mouthing him daily is protesting enough for me.
@mike_Zollo @thebradfordfile Trump is a deplorable xenophobic moron just like all of his gullible followers are.

@WestonMartinez @codeofvets @davidhogg111 @FloridaGOP @RightWingAngel @GovMikeHuckabee I don't like trade deals that unfairly send jobs overseas, but a trade war is not an answer.
@WestonMartinez @codeofvets @davidhogg111 @FloridaGOP @RightWingAngel @GovMikeHuckabee Stock market did great under Obama, not as well under Trump, don't care much if big foot is real and the health care mandate is not perfect but once I get health insurance from my job in a year I'm not worried about it.

@WestonMartinez @codeofvets @davidhogg111 @FloridaGOP @RightWingAngel @GovMikeHuckabee I'm not pro choice and as far as social security it was your idol Reagan who borrowed from social security to pay for corporate tax cuts. Can you explain that or are you too ashamed to admit it?
@Education4Libs You are so delusional it's sad and pitiful.
@WestonMartinez @codeofvets @davidhogg111 @FloridaGOP @RightWingAngel @GovMikeHuckabee NAFTA I can agree with you on but it should be reformed not destroyed.
@WestonMartinez @codeofvets @davidhogg111 @FloridaGOP @RightWingAngel @GovMikeHuckabee What's ironic about your welfare comment is more red states receive more federal dollars than they contribute, they also have more people on welfare in red states than blue states.
@WestonMartinez @codeofvets @davidhogg111 @FloridaGOP @RightWingAngel @GovMikeHuckabee That was 200 years ago and back then the Democrats were conservatives and Republicans were liberals.

@WestonMartinez @codeofvets @davidhogg111 @FloridaGOP @RightWingAngel @GovMikeHuckabee In other words it does not bother you if American workers lose good paying jobs to foreign competitors. You just proved my point that Republicans don't give a damn about workers or unions for that matter.
@thebradfordfile @SandraTXAS @surfermom77 @GrizzleMeister @stacy_redvirgo @DanCovfefe1 @DontMockMyTypos @RuthieRedSox @CollinRugg @LeahR77 @SparkleSoup45 Typical fear based right wing propaganda rhetoric.
