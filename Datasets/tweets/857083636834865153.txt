@realDonaldTrump Foreign governments know who their American prisoners are and would have specific instructions with where they are and how they get treated. This is some little league bullshit and your acting like a coward with this.
@Pontifex That’s pretty grim stuff there buddy
@DonaldJTrumpJr Though though though funny funny funny funny
@CheriJacobus They all did/still do. Homie Pascale is really suspect to me considering he’s their computer guy.
@ElmerRivera123 @DonaldJTrumpJr Boyeh? You aren’t versed in the high art of low insults. Had this been authentically intuitive you would’ve ended with son.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Close to 50 tweets or retweet’s from you today that have the word Cohen in them.
@Jim_Jordan You spent 4 and a half minutes without asking one question and at the very beginning said you should be pursuing the truth. Typically I’d be dismissive but this is what’s wrong. People who run their mouths to spite any notion of truth.
@LindseyGrahamSC You did it with Iran. You guys were so against the notion of peace that you had zero good faith arguments about what that type of future would hold. In summary your full of shit.
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC All this makes me thing of our beta fish who will eat each other and other fish given the chance. Your views on taking a bath and a persons capacity for violence are weird and make no sense to me.
@ParchmentScroll @MattNegrin Double down. That’s my guess to.
@Walldo I have a nectar mattress. I got it right before YouTube ads for them starting popping up. The best mattress I’ve ever slept on and lifetime warranty. $800 bucks. Highly recommended.
@BiggieSchmitt @SkyNews No. His perception of him not being fragile is everything to him.
@mallen2010 @joshscampbell @jaketapper I mean I don’t know. I don’t like a lot of the interactions between Palestine and Israel. Not swearing allegiance to one or another doesn’t make me an agent of anything. Me saying I don’t like that Israel did that about anything doesn’t make me a terrorist.
@mallen2010 @joshscampbell @jaketapper Criticism is not demonizing. You see what your saying You just did exactly what I wrote. You decided that condemning someone for saying something negative about Israel is an allowable excuse to convey and spread bigotry and racism about a different group. In this case Muslims.
@mallen2010 @joshscampbell @jaketapper That’s what’s at the center of the whole issue. As long as you don’t criticize Israel you can be racist as fuck about anyone else but the subject of Israel is untouchable.
@StefanMolyneux Yo. What?
@oldarmy1 @DonaldJTrumpJr It’s a lot like that in some places but in a lot of other places it’s bulls shoulder to shoulder up to their knees in feces being fed corn not grass.
@oldarmy1 @DonaldJTrumpJr I think most of you have a great misconception about the meat industry and the pristine idea of cattle and livestock roaming and grazing on open land.
@CoolCatlovesyou @realDonaldTrump @HuffPost @CNN @MSNBC Your not a kids character, your a straight up marketing scheme.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ya know instead of being a prick you could do something useful like advocate for the induction of classes that educate students on the impact of credit scores and how they will impact your future self. What productive measure do you suggest?
@renato_mariotti @HowardSchultz @Purdue_SG 2/2) On the other it’s also absolutely ridiculous to me people who claim small donations as an astounding achievement when it also amounts to the same extraordinary amount of money that will inevitably be squandered on things like ad space.
@renato_mariotti @HowardSchultz @Purdue_SG I feel two ways about this. 1/2) On one side it’s crazy to envision someone with so much money while at the same time see an unprecedented amount of people living on the street and in extreme poverty. This in what’s supposed to be the greatest country and society ever.
@WalshFreedom ‘is offensive &amp; racist, but’  	Think about the way you worded what you just said. 	Your using your own words to produce an excuse that appeases your own rationale, not to seek a logical answer.
@JeffMinter @RadioFreeTom Whataboutism is an excuse to continue an action by pointing at someone else’s actions. He just said your absolutely welcome to condemn these actions and that also doesn’t dismiss other people’s actions.
@JacobCantRap @KrangTNelson Said cisterns* it’s to cold out here for math
@JacobCantRap @KrangTNelson Me either it said tanks so I just changed cistern with a big metal tank in my mind
@JacobCantRap @KrangTNelson Other ones turned off*
@JacobCantRap @KrangTNelson No. Each one fills the tank individually in the allotted time so the fastest would fill in a half an hour with out the other ones turned on so it has to be less than 30 min.
@lkoturner @yashar Enjoy hell on earth I guess https://t.co/masMKnhgHH
@tribelaw Trump jr., remember the whole exchange where he released his convo with Wikileaks. That’s was a whole thing that really happened.
@AoDespair https://t.co/ITdvVpcygh
@JuddLegum How did he know the context of the question concerning Ross’ statement so intimately if didn’t see it? Like his response was way to fast to make it believeable he wasn’t aware of it.
@MotherJones @SecretaryRoss Is this fucking really saying you should get a loan if you have no money?
@GreenwoodChet @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench That’s not true I could fully agree with another and still be aware of the messaging they push
@GreenwoodChet @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench If you were making a joke it was to fuel propaganda (I browsed your account). You won’t find easy marks everywhere you go.
@GreenwoodChet @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench As it stand for make America great again what time frame should that reference?considering the people wearing them were in direct confrontation with ancestor of people who inhabited America long ago.
@GreenwoodChet @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench No. Mm mm that’s not what you were doing. You see this is where the details of inaccurate history that you attempted to insert you now attempt to deflect. I would like to insert an insight that I just had concerning the hats.
@GreenwoodChet @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench It’s interesting and offers more than your thought that tribes only went to war with one another.
@GreenwoodChet @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench Yes and no. It’s all our lands although being a surviving member of the indigenous means this land was occupied by his ancestors. You should read up on the disruption of buffalo hunts and hide trade to destroy indigenous peoples ability to survive.
@Ryan_Reilly78 @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench I don’t think most white people understand that it’s completely rationale for poc to fear white people especially adolescents (when I was that age I didn’t really have an accurate concept of empathy toward anyone in particular).
@GreenwoodChet @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench They did. Not all of them. Your painting a broad stroke in an attempt to desensitize and rationalize your theory that all groups of a larger outfit act the same.
@GreenwoodChet @Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench You make assertions enabling stereotypes with no actual knowledge.
@Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench Also from the article ‘and, let’s face it, walking through a group of boys chanting and banging a drum is not exactly normal behavior’ 		Nah man no ones culture gets to be dictated by what you consider social norms.
@Patrickm55P @xan_desanctis @WRogersM @DavidAFrench Yea. Missing from this article is we should just let this indigenous veteran bang his drum. For real like I see no one saying people named black Israelites arguing with European descendants while the guy who’s land everyone is standing on is still here.

@senatemajldr @hughhewitt @POTUS I recall a child dying from dehydration and a child dying from being locked in a freezer under supervision. I recall seeing numbers on the arms of people in custody. I recall ice disappearing people from the homes they lived in for years. Speak to be me more about humanitarian.

@Jackalish @derekscallahan @TieCrimes one dollar bills*
@Jackalish @derekscallahan @TieCrimes Also don’t hand a driver one dollars. That’s a signal that is the full payment with tip included. Do not expect change if your using one dollar bills.
@Jackalish @derekscallahan @TieCrimes It’s a weird job just because you develop a catch phrase (hi, how are ya?) everytime some one answers a door. The awkward moment between receiving the payment and receiving a tip is just so weird
@DonaldJTrumpJr Everyone on your side was really careful not to issue a denial because you have no idea what Cohen said and that means he has a lot of leverage. Like a lot a lot.
@tomgara I feel like I would abscond with him and raise him and never tell him who he was supposed to be and constantly be mean to him cause knowing pisses me off and then he’d kill me and do it all again anyways.
@HeerJeet Please let this be a joke and not some deep dive into some historical shit.
@JacobAWohl @swin24 Why do you censor words when you type? BECAUSE YOUR AGAINST FREEDOM JACOB, that’s why. Ya weird little whatever the fuck you are
@AndyBCampbell One of the hardest things about following the guidelines on this site is watching pundits and mouthpieces run their mouths like this and defending toughness and masculinity at the same time all while knowing their physically weaker than you.
@GIJoeyJoeJoe Holy fuck you caught me off guard and made me burst out laughing.
@SilverfoxRyan @SimonMaloy It’s a business model directly ripping off the brand supreme. Not defending that model either just stating the obvious.
@HelenKennedy It was super coherent and fluid. It’s weird that the way people talk is totally different than the way they write.
@HelenKennedy That is*
@HelenKennedy It’s pretty good and left me wanting to read more of these events from his perspective. That’s is pretty surprising to me.
@Jackalish @derekscallahan @TieCrimes I was just thinking I kinda regret not asking him about it but on the other hand I still remember it and still know what block he lives on just because of it. Other drivers got mad about stuff like that while people would be handing me jars full of change.
@Jackalish @derekscallahan @TieCrimes Use to deliver pizza. Some guy always payed with only $2 bills. Even the tip was formulated to factor in only $2 bills. Never asked him why.
@BeingAngryIsBad @Bencjacobs @FreeBeacon I will say my perspective of me not finding it funny has nothing to do with any event other than the context of it being a comedy show.
@BeingAngryIsBad @Bencjacobs @FreeBeacon I didn’t get far enough into the piece to discover an intent. all. I didn’t find the last episode that funny. So if someone implying they think this is the pinnacle of evolution in comedy I don’t want to invest myself in learning what their takes on comedy are or is.
@SouffleOfTheDay @NormOrnstein @TrueFactsStated I read up on him for like 30 seconds I was still like I have no idea who this guy is. Meh more what interaction did I have with this account curious than anything else really.
@SouffleOfTheDay @NormOrnstein @TrueFactsStated I don’t even know who the fuck that is so jokes on them.
@SouffleOfTheDay @NormOrnstein I’m actually blocked from whatever account this is which intrigues me further. Who is it?
@Bencjacobs @FreeBeacon The point at which I stopped reading the article: ‘everyone agrees, it just keeps getting better.                                                         		I’m in no way stuck in a state of nostalgia where things were funny. I like humor lately that shit is hit or miss though.

@michaelranaii @kenklippenstein That’s how you achieve a totalitarian state. Fuck that.
@michaelranaii @kenklippenstein It’s far more dangerous that the government suggesting to it’s employees that sharing public opinion namely negative scrutiny and criticism can be punished outside of the work place.
@TuttleAlicia @dsupervilleap @kenklippenstein Yea prolly. What am I gonna do call em up and be like yea nah I ain’t payin these taxes. Other people though I’d wager would be far more committed especially people who expect large returns.
@Tod08272395 @SenFeinstein Air Force*👌
@Tod08272395 @SenFeinstein It’s a very important agency that keeps many people from getting very sick tod with many numbers at the end who’s a conservative desert storm a force vet with an account that was created this month.
@BorisandNatash4 @SenFeinstein Huh?
@DanielBShapiro I can think of at least one person who has thought about it and taken it seriously. He just doesn’t reside here.
@TuttleAlicia @dsupervilleap @kenklippenstein April would to long for any normal person to commit themselves to working without pay. Necessity will force them to work elsewhere. The only reason they’re even recalling them is any remaining iota of loyalty within the gop will plummet.
@goofygoober2931 @hunterw USDA beef is just beef that passed inspection by the usda meaning it qualifies as edible. USDA beef has nothing to do with origin. Each source of food inspected gets an establishment number so food sources can be tracked. That’s what makes things like recalls possible.
@igorbobic Is that a joke?
@tomgara Many company’s spend hundreds on food for events for people all the time. Not really laughing at it. The guy is fucking child who doesn’t understand empathy.
@hunterw You should know there’s a very high chance. Like insanely high. Like 99.9% chance that a good deal of the beef sitting on that table does not originate from the United States. Like not even remotely close. Just feel like that touch info is lacking in all of this.
@eScarry Wut?

@MikeIsaac @oneunderscore__ I bought 2 bags of gummies yesterday and have no idea where I put them. That's where I'm at during this garbage.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity This shit is tiresome
@DanCrenshawTX @JerryDunleavy It's not an unreasonable stance to not make deals with people who have displayed many times that they should not be trusted.
@ndrew_lawrence So what happens when they find out he's using this platform to campaign and this commercial airs in tandem?
@JerryDunleavy Hourly salaried people don't get paid for the hours to they don't work. This it doesn't go into effect till this date doesn't matter if your not working the hours to get paid.
@JamiesonJMatt @aigs1111 @3liza I didn't know it until you figured it out and explained it. Pretty weak on the joke and joke replies tbh.
@NBCNews No unless they want to put a dent into the longevity of their own viewership. You have news programs that already exist at allotted time slots that can recap news. You just end up competing with other networks for the same audience over the same content is pretty dumb.
@Oakahnesky @Fox_Sight @ChicagoBears @CParkey36 +even*
@Oakahnesky @Fox_Sight @ChicagoBears @CParkey36 It was when in Madden games for years. If your opponent called a time out on you the kick meter would be frozen with ice because of the term icing the kicker.
@Oakahnesky @Fox_Sight @ChicagoBears @CParkey36 It makes a difference. So much so it has a name (icing the kicker). Obviously the kicker here has some other instances going for him but calling a time out on a kicker is a well known play call.
@Fox_Sight @ChicagoBears @CParkey36 It's true. Icing the kicker is a well known strategy and a good play call.
@MaxKennerly @ABC @matthewjdowd Their crazy. They live in crazy person land.
@washingtonpost This whole piece is a dumpster fire floating along a stream of raw sewage.
@BariAWilliams @davidmweissman That's the point though. I think they're a lot more self aware than they let on.
@davidmweissman Monetizing a stereotype.
@thehowie @BillKristol Have you met him? He's like the mad king from got. He'll burn it all before it's over
@realDonaldTrump You said raking forests prevented fires. Shut the fuck up.
@SRuhle He only wins if no one else is playing. That's how it helped him before.
@NanaUbiz @WarrenDavidson @USTreasury @BrianKolfage You don't get to pick and choose one you open that door.
@MissHMParker @WarrenDavidson @USTreasury @BrianKolfage Private financing guiding government policy. If I raise x amount for y purpose privately the government now can execute y purpose. This means anyone can use a loophole to push government to commit funds for their intentions regardless of any legislative precedure.
@MissHMParker @WarrenDavidson @USTreasury @BrianKolfage Like a monarchy or socialism.
@mkraju Like he acted like 7-eleven prices are normal. Like if things were really priced that way it'd be like hyper inflation. This guy is the secretary of fucking commerce.
@mkraju I'm just happy he's on other people's minds now. Of all the 2018 political shit I can't get this guy outta my head. He brought a can of soup and a can of soda from 7-eleven on national tv and acted like buying that type of stuff from 7eleven was normal.
@WarrenDavidson @USTreasury @BrianKolfage This is a shady and suspect proposition. Everything about it seems grimy.
@parscale @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump Pee tape 20/20
@kanyewest That's nice. Fails at the self realization that your being appropriated as a token for the white patriarchy.
@CheriJacobus Like if anyone's answer is remain calm, talk softly, and be civil they've lost.
@CheriJacobus Bernie's got an outlandish personality and entertaining  because of it.  What I really want to know is what happens when whatever person ends up sharing a stage with Trump? Like when he ends up insulting everybody and talking over them?
@CheriJacobus @JoeBiden This is bullshit. Twitter just had a troll army based on the entire premise of flipping parties because of a specific individual. I call bullshit. This is you trying to construct a specific future for your specific purpose whatever that may be.
@JoshMcGruff @officialmcafee This made me laugh.
@MurderBryan I saw a cop pay for coffee the other day. It was the first time I have seen a uniformed cop pay for coffee. I did a triple take while I was making my coffee.
@scottlincicome Take your international delight bullshit and gtfoutta here.
@TheSteveNoize @BroadStBull The entire team isn't offensive enough. The missed opportunities from attempting to create opportunities instead of taking the opportunity that already exists takes longer away a lot. Would like to see average shot total vs. each team respectively in brackets of 5,10, 20 games.
@TheSteveNoize @BroadStBull Also  dmen are always the first to get blamed. Goal, d man didn't protect. Cherry picking forward, d mans fault for not passing it through other teams forwards. Forwards give up a  takeaway, d man didn't do his job backing up and is now out of position.
@JayGualario @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump It would be acceptable to want proof. How can you ask for proof while advocating for the denial of aid before it begins?
@DavidAFrench Beto has more mass appeal and Bernie bros feel threatened by it.
@nytimes So it was a race? 	Was there a prize?
@GaryGonePostal @TheRickWilson That's debatable. I think on the same budget healthy food can be just as cheap. Most people can't handle boredom so visiting a fast food place even if it's just the drive through has become an acceptable event in which to participate.
@paintpro99 @_youhadonejob1 It's a real review on Amazon. Prolly a guy joking . Seen it from original sources couple years ago.
@JHWeissmann People who want to borrow large amounts with low to no interest attached and have no future collateral it would seem. Five minutes thinking about this it seems like an effort to deplete a large volume resources for something very specific.
@RepMarkMeadows Just 5B. 5 billion dollars is such an absurd amount won't even type it out.
@Mel_Ankoly @classiclib3ral Not saying some aren't legit mad just a lot are using it as a guise to spread anti muslim bullshit. (I've worked for a place that manufactured kosher food and I currently deal with some halal food in manufacturing).
@Mel_Ankoly @classiclib3ral Same as kosher. They clean the tanks and instead of a rabbi an Islamic cleric walks around and blesses the tanks. All the people pretending to be angry about slitting an animals throat and saying it's inhumane must also be mad at kosher food because it's the exact requirement.
@Michael_Youhana @HeerJeet @mattseaton You do two things simultaneously. I could think someone's a total piece of shit and have sympathy if they fell in front of me I'd ask if they were okay. I got sympathy for stupidity cause that's just someone who doesn't know any better. I have no sympathy for arrogance.
@Michael_Youhana @HeerJeet @mattseaton Any acknowledgement of it however honest I would consider completely disingenuous. I'm not left, right, or anything other than me as an individual so speaking about what group does what has no appeal to me other than who is doing what and if I like the idea of it or not.
@Michael_Youhana @HeerJeet @mattseaton I feel as if these are non equal things. Like the provocation of war that results in thousands upon thousands of deaths does not equal a "my bad bro".
@ElizabethEThorp @petersagal Forgot about this movie. Been wanting to see it. First one was dope. It's a good pick.
@waltshaub @kaitlancollins Oh no I get that. His decisions and convictions are his own though. My reply wasn't meant to be direct. More of an observation that hundreds of thousands of replies sharing the same sentiment from the same type of joke from multiple people that the guy is some poor smuck.
@waltshaub @kaitlancollins Is he though? I don't get how he's some innocent that just showed up. I just don't get how the joke is how he's the poor sucker in this. It's a weird rationale that he's somehow naive to it all.
@realDonaldTrump The Adderall thing makes a good deal of sense. You kept calling every one low energy.

@Popehat Why coloring books though?
@astroehlein This is the playbook. It's grifters fueling victim hood, cashing out and anyone who dare step in the way has no moral compass. The idea that hate speech is free speech therefore it is acceptable dialogue that others should just accept it or they lack civility is the biggest grift
@astroehlein They are constantly barraged through media with the idea that every personal failure of their own is and should be someone else's fault. Being fed the idea that everything you can achieve is being limited by an external malicious force.
@skolanach @bad_takes @steak_ham This is fantastic.
@kenklippenstein Definitely should be regulated somehow. There's some seriously threatening shit on here like direct threat type of stuff. Crazy their stock images from Twitter.
@truebe @KrangTNelson Raw bacon maybe?
@MaxKennerly @KrangTNelson They also wanna feed a fed horse. They want fat horses too. Smh.
@LindseyGrahamSC You mean to tell me that the president will lie to your face? 	Oh well I guess you'll have to tell him by showing up on hannity's show and say nice things cause that's like the only avenue of contact you have with him.	Kinda ridiculous for a senator one would think.
@papamaymay @timheidecker I for one am super happy a couple people have stopped circle jerking over a picture of a fucking dog. For real muthafuckerd treating this dog better than tear gassed children. Spare that shit son.
@SopanDeb The movie doesn't even get to exist without this plot point.
@SopanDeb The Patriot . Mel Gibson gets killed by his neighbors who hate him within the first ten minutes. The plot entry of him not being a slave owner but having black employees is the most unbelievable premise and has been bothering me for a while.
@TomRtweets @DavidMDrucker I was out once you said you respected him.
@NRA What's this story have to do with the NRA?
@tomgara Tuna is cat food for people.

@Harlan @realDonaldTrump Magnitude 7 metals laid off an estimated hired worker and filled for bankruptcy protection after the Trump adminstration imposed tarrifs. They expect to hire 400-450 people when reopening the plant. That is a loss of 450-500 jobs. https://t.co/sQKhnVq4v6

@AFP Link?
@MikeAFaulkner Saw this and immediately thought ya know who has cool stuff that no one really would think about it having. Barnes and Noble. Little bit pricey though.
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker It's prolly a pretty fucked up place. Not to long ago there was an article on here explaining how groups try to fleece you into owning money to get on prominent boards and panels and the only possible way to pay that money is to get it from lobbyists.
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker By the way I'm some innocent boyscott or anything, I know to take things with a grain of salt.
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker I do hold that expectation. You may think it's naive to expect transparency but I value honesty and I'd rather navigate my life in this belief than disregard everything with cynism. Small amounts add up to large amounts over time.
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker Had this statement contained an error or something that is a considered problematic who gets held to account?
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker Accountability isn't just for things that are deemed wrong. Small things considered trivial like this need to be included.
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker It's absolutely our business. Not the phone call unless it contained an official matter but the public release of statement by an official who doesn't cite anyone else so it's acceptable to expect he should be the author.
@BillKristol This is oddly written as if these men were utilities of a war your nostalgic about and miss.
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker If I read something and it says this is a statement from You I would fully expect You to be the author of the statement.
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker ?
@MikeAFaulkner @DavidMDrucker It's supposed to be a statement from him and Melania so it they're supposed to be the authors.
@DavidMDrucker He did not write this.

@macrovist @danangell11 @heyaries1981 @JeffFlake Me?
@benjohnanderson @AdamSerwer Still Marciano's name was dropped by him. I don't believe it but o recall him saying it. I mean obviously that's not what this guy is getting at in this response but I don't think it should just be dismissed when there was a court case and everything.
@danangell11 @macrovist @heyaries1981 @JeffFlake McConnell is the gop not Trump. His plan is to Outlast him by ignoring every negative story about him so he can't be immediately complicit in anything criminal. He doesn't give a shit how it goes down.
@macrovist @danangell11 @heyaries1981 @JeffFlake Those who are in Trump's favor and those who aren't and that's no good for McConnell.
@macrovist @danangell11 @heyaries1981 @JeffFlake These are their convictions. Trump is a tool to them to push through everything they want. All these shitty things are gop that they used him to pass. McConnell doesn't want a vote on Mueller because it forces everyone to be an individual and will separate them into two camps.
@benjohnanderson @AdamSerwer He sued him and lost and Marciano was cited as the defense.
@AdamSerwer @RobZacny I ah feel as if you should be fact checking this even if that dude's on a crazy rant for credibility sake.
@AdamSerwer @RobZacny I seen a documentary where stalone cites the inspiration for the movie from Marciano because a boxer from New Jersey sued him saying it was based on him. A guy named Chuck (forget his last name) ranked 6th in the world at the time and fought Ali.

@TomBarneby @eta1342 @andersen @AdamSerwer Every opponent is portrayed as arrogant and has an inflated ego and has no self awareness of it regardless of race. Rocky is portrayed as the modest guy who's the underdog. Except for rocky 3 where he's the asshole but only because he was being lied to by Micky so Micky's
@TomBarneby @eta1342 @andersen @AdamSerwer Every boxer Rocky faces he is the protagonist. His opponent is the physical villian. I love the Rocky movies. Like we root for rocky to fuck the other guy up because he's portrayed as the underdog champion. Nobody deserves it more in those movies.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake revere any of them
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake We're talking about people who have immense power and wealth in contrast to the rest of the people in the world. They specifically did not pass up the opportunity. I'm not saying that as a negative but I'll be damned if your gonna try and humble me in to thought that I should
@theirfanator @JeffFlake I mean good for him I guess. I wouldn't give a shit. It's exactly what I would do. If McConnell won't give my bill the time of day why would I care what courtesy he should expect of me?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake What you need to know is he wants something. That's how this game works.
@BrandyZadrozny https://t.co/Fgto5XFXfs
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Looks like Tim Scott just threw in his hat.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake McConnell ain't there to help him. You wanna bring the same bill in front of me a hundred times for me to reject you okay.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Like Imma just wait you out cause it's way easier for me to promise you something that ain't never coming. Your leaving. No sweat off my backm
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake From this perspective he's trying to make deals with people who aren't retiring and know if he keeps playing it like this they can just wait him out.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake In my hypothetical of if it was me. I know I'm retiring. I'm seeking something very specific. I'm putting down everything you throw at me because already know everything that got past me I can't put down but there's still a lot in front of me that I can.
@JoePerticone Now that's funny.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Yeah I don't get it then. Why withdraw a vote if the vote leads to a tie when essentially you have no present power over the matter anyway.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake People don't just give stuff or power away.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Like that's where all his power is right? In this specific process so if he made a deal or agreement it would be for something in exchange.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake The way you explain it he has the ability to straight up kill the bill or kill it and it can be reintroduced and be killed again (not really sure here) so how does allowing it to go to the full Senate benefit him?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake As you explain it he can win every single time to get what he's after so I don't get it.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake I don't understand how it wouldn't change anything. If he votes no it kills the confirmation as you explain it. So how does that affect future confirmations negatively for flake? He knows he can swing every Dem to a no on all votes for this so how would voting no today hurt him?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake So how would him voting no here negatively effect him when it comes to other nominees? Wouldn't they all go through the same process?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake He obviously has some type of power because they delayed the vote and it'll never be for moral reasons.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake I don't know the numbers of other bills up for vote as far as who's for and not for. Why was it 49-49. Like how did it come to be a tie other than his buddy being out and his non vote?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake So if flake voted it would have been 50-49 killing the confirmation? Instead it goes to a full senate vote?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake So pence gets to vote if the nomination will go before the entire senate if there's a tie?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake I don't understand. I'm not versed in politics like that. If the vote is no today the confirmation is killed or pence gets a vote? Does pence get a vote in this vote if flake votes no today? I don't get it.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Why would they stop the confirmation if they know they have pences vote?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake I'm not entirely following.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake So he needs another no vote from a gop senator to kill it?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake You haven't worked in the same places as me.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake How is the result different?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake If he already knows how his colleague will be voting and he's already declared his vote will be specific way (yes or no) why wouldn't he vote this week instead of next?
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Explain to me how not voting now regardless of someone else's vote is a moral desicion. If I call out sick. Other people don't call out sick because I did. That's my analogy here.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Try to sell me something other than sympathy.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake That's why I asked a question to this specific scenario and as the only one who dissented from majority opinion I haven't found anything in your answers that would convince me that his actions were based on integrity instead of opportunity.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake I only know about this specific scenario. Present to me your supporting evidence with a link if you want to convince me.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake I'm not of fan of excuses.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake What? That's the argument I presented. Your counter was moralism suspended because of future influence. The notion of future influence suspended and disregarded by making a decision based on morals in the immediate present would be the honorable action.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake he's looking for gains that satisfy him on other topics because of it.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Favorability to who? If it's a moral decision then it would be unique to his beliefs and the thought of having being favorable to anyone wouldn't matter. This is where that naive comment comes in. The thought of influence in the future is at play meaning
@eta1342 @TomBarneby @andersen @AdamSerwer Rocky is the protagonist. Apollo is the physical villian. He gets a raw deal simply by being the champion and being self aware that he is the champion and the best.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake The desired outcome is the desired outcome so your defense of the action or inaction suggests this out come is not favorable to him.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake That's a weird way to market it. A realist would interpret it as someone waiting for a better offer on whatever is it they we're looking to progress in an unrelated bill. Your take on that type of altruism is naive.
@TomBarneby @eta1342 @andersen @AdamSerwer Literally gets killed. World champion of boxing.
@TomBarneby @eta1342 @andersen @AdamSerwer I disagree with a good deal of the piece but in Rocky 4 he gets treated like an amateur who has never been in the ring and has no idea how to box.
@TomBarneby @eta1342 @andersen @AdamSerwer He's not represented as a fantastic champion. He's the movie's arrogant and undeserving villian. The weirdest thing to me about Rocky being the protagonist is he starts off by being an enforcer for the mob who are rackateers.
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake an alt account*
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Don't try to sell me on sympathy from alt account on
@anderso_alex @JeffFlake Huh? The question is how does not voting now change any record of voting at a later time without his colleagues vote. Would it change the outcome if he voted yes or no now as opposed to voting yes or no in a week with his colleague?
@macrovist @JeffFlake I don't understand why he has to wait for a colleague. Like how would that affect the outcome?
@JeffFlake I don't get it. Why not just vote no this time?
@RepThomasMassie Yeah people should get to eat. The fuck is wrong with you?
@EWErickson That's a grifters speech if I ever saw one.
@checkeater @NMatlack0817 @judybattista @LesBowen Look at ya. Just look at ya.

@Alex50842488 @McKayMSmith @KReturnfire It's not. I rarely retweet. I also have some form of media. I counted your posts that were listed 4d and 5d ago. It's an absurd number. I'm not tripping. It's due diligence to me.
@Alex50842488 @McKayMSmith @KReturnfire This got weird. Never made that claim. The amount of activity on your page produced by you in the last week is an insanely large amount. It's suspicious to me.
@McKayMSmith @Alex50842488 @KReturnfire It's retweets from all over like spam messaging.
@McKayMSmith @Alex50842488 @KReturnfire Interesting. Got blocked by the account. Huh.
@McKayMSmith @Alex50842488 @KReturnfire I can't make that claim though I hand counted 70+ reweets from 4d and 5d ago. After 6d it only showed 2 or 3 dates. With no media. Everyone posts a pic or a gif now and then. With 70+ retweets your not new to the game. That with the numbers after the @

It's a business and I want a profit. His jersey will sell. They want to wear it, they want to burn , it would be all money to me.

@ordinarymarvel @nataliesurely hours*
@ordinarymarvel @nataliesurely The argument you make is people choose to work there. He's not building any spaceship ever working 200 hours a week if it's just him.
@ordinarymarvel @nataliesurely is coming from someone who can take breaks when ever they feel like. I'm sure he works but his ability to determine what to do with his time is his alone.
@ordinarymarvel @nataliesurely It's not about that. Elon is well known for being the owner of a company which is an employer. For someone who owns a company to say it takes 80 have ours of work a week to have any adequate measure of progress and success
@LelieFairy @telbasta @piratepkcat @ninaleejohnson @nataliesurely I need that in muh life

@BillOReilly Ya I know a lot of people joke about that 32 million dollar thing and I had to ask myself even if I had a trillion dollars what act would I have to commit where I would accept any deduction of 32 million dollars and I realized it had to be a truly terrible act.
@haroldpollack How much do you want to know? I learned super basic Spanish working in warehouses learning curse words from other people in Spanish. It's that or Rosetta Stone. I think your probably looking for the Spanish 2 class which i never went to......
@haroldpollack How basic?
@existentialfish Who's Tom Delay?
@LindseyGrahamSC But fuck no. Lidnsey Graham ain't got shit to say until shit hits the fan.
@LindseyGrahamSC Months to prepare for this. Like you could have said okay people are coming who are going to seek asylum. We know when they'll be here. We can get ready by ensuring a smooth systematic handling of claims and paperwork. Could have just all been paperwork.

@McKayMSmith @KReturnfire they crave.
@McKayMSmith @KReturnfire It's just easier to deflect to something you find revelant but enjoyable like a movie or scenario. He's a video game troll. You ignore them, let them upset you, or get them fed up by wasting everyone's time. No amount of logic you produce will benefit you. It's the attention
@KReturnfire @McKayMSmith Hey remember behind enemy lines with Owen Wilson? Wasn't that about this. Good movie. Good movie.
@KReturnfire @McKayMSmith What response would you feel is warranted here? I can replicate you and that would make me an NPC because of the limited scripted dialogue or I could speak for myself. Yo remember that guy skyrim? The store clerk guy? Now that's an npc.
@PeterLucier @KReturnfire @McKayMSmith That's what I thought it meant.
@McKayMSmith @KReturnfire I browsed his profile when you guys first got into it.  It's a racist rabbit hole. I was just asking cause NPC means non playable character in reference to video games to millions of people so I don't understand it in this context.
@KReturnfire @McKayMSmith What's npc? What's that stand for?
@Scoutycat2 @RadioFreeTom I don't think so. Have you ever seen him act as if any type of tradegy affected him at all? Caring would imply empathy and an understanding of having to deal with a serious situation.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It's really weird to me people seeking to immigrate illegally would show up at an official Port of entry. I'm not saying your full of shit, I'm just saying your full of shit.

@woofpickle @HoarseWisperer Every forklift operator bumps into shit once in while. If they tell you different they're a liar. Can anchor as much as you want to the floor. Don't matter with all the top weight.
@lmarytweets @HoarseWisperer He didn't. A lot of place build their racks and then don't maintain them. Those racks are really high for ones that are double reach. Single racks should only be like 3 or 4 high because of concentrated weight or they'll eventually break like toothpicks.

@Artreilley @mlevenson they can unload 10 truck by hand without complaint and I know several people who smoke it and are incredibly lazy.
@Artreilley @mlevenson That's been an issue for decade. We have an opioid epidemic that stemmed from legal prescription of opioid painkillers being overused. The addictive qualities have been known for a long time. As far a marijuana. I know several people who can smoke it and
@Artreilley @mlevenson The dumbing down, what? I don't don't understand your statement about control. Maybe rephrase it? Maybe autocorrect fucked it up.
@Artreilley @mlevenson Her picture with a cop smoking a joint could very well be an important footnote in historical documents a hundreds years from now.
@Artreilley @mlevenson Your assertion that a 62 year old person should be in pursuit of employment is a bad take. In addition unemployed doesn't always mean collecting unemployment but you know that jorge. Your not dumb. Also something's are revolutionary, their bigger than us and our life time.
@Artreilley @mlevenson She's 62. These are the worst takes. She's fucking 62 years old Jorge.

@HeerJeet I don't mean that as a negative. Like it's a normal amount of money that a normal person might have. Damn saying that to myself. Damn, that's fucked up.
@HeerJeet 5200 in savings is considered pretty good among most people.

@Lovemypupper @willsommer It's true. They want attention not real conflict.

@HamdiAlkhshali Are they saudi or turkish enployees? Like if I'm saudi imma say whatever I'm told to. Why take that risk after what i witnessed or heard.
@andylassner Jared:	"I can reform the middle east, I have a plan".	Mbs: "we've been here for millennia"	Jared: "But I'm white and from America"	(Mbs turns and begins to walk away)	Jared: "I have names!!"	(Mbs with a raised eyebrow and smug smile turns back)	Mbs:"Tell me about this plan."
@jonathanvswan Oh shit son.
@eorden I argued with a crazy guy who approached me at a bus stop about it. (True story) (why do people randomly approach me?)
@gnuseibeh Your a bum. Fuck outta here.
@MBuell01 @Chris_Myers50 @rick5258 @pebonilla @NoahCRothman It's not the older you get. Like i used to smoke when i was in high school. You think nick and dime and all that shit. I legit had a half pound chilling after a while from not wanted to keep running around.
@MBuell01 @Chris_Myers50 @rick5258 @pebonilla @NoahCRothman marijuana offenses from Detroit bro.
@MBuell01 @Chris_Myers50 @rick5258 @pebonilla @NoahCRothman For some people a pound ain't shit man. He wasn't carrying it around like everywhere. He had a destination. He's jamacian. Beyond sounding like a stereotype marijuana consumption by the indigenous there is well documented. Finally your arguing a point of being arrested for
@MBuell01 @Chris_Myers50 @rick5258 @pebonilla @NoahCRothman You should believe it. Like your an avid daily smoker who measures to exacts? That in smoker world is intent to distribute.
@ClancyReports There is nobody left man.
@gnuseibeh @MazMHussain We. Don't Believe. You.
@ianbremmer I would like to know who the 18 detained individuals are cause it kinda sounds like he used an opportunity to go after more people he considers threats.
@hxhassan Ironic the only credible info came from turkey.
@SteveScalise Yea that'll calm em' down. You ah wanted to play these games. The fuck did you think would happen.
@iowahawkblog "What? I was not paying attention, I spaced out"
@radleybalko I was just thinking that these guys were scheming and dealing shit themselves.
@realDonaldTrump Ooookay sooo maybe deal with that instead of doing this..
@nypost All i hate about these articles is the stock images of a shadowy figure on a computer. Like for once use a normal person in a well lit room. Like you really think people turn off their lights and put on a hoodie when they do this shit.
@RobGeorge @evansiegfried @JoaquinCastrotx I think it has some merit. He's said to have provided a list of dissidents. I believe he didn't know it would be turned into a hit list. His beliefs on that matter don't matter.
@SteveScalise Ya know it's so fuckin weird having elected people think this shit.
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump Yo that shit is like the size of highschool basketball court.
@n_e_azil @loriamontgomery @costareports What?
@realDonaldTrump The fuck does that even mean
@DavidKernohan @brianklaas I do think it coordinated among a few not don't.
@DavidKernohan @brianklaas No i understand it. I don't think it's coordinated among a few using backchannels. It's seems more like a let's throw it out there and see what the response is. The whole story has a theme. Is it plausible enough to give us a pass? The answer is no.
@DavidKernohan @brianklaas So everyone can carryout different body parts in sections after you dismember someone. That's why you send 15 people.
@DavidKernohan @brianklaas There was no plan to interrogate anyone. You send like 3 people for an interrogation. You know why they sent 15 people?
@CB_556 @NRA @tedcruz There's probably already lawsuits for this stuff. I read a statement that was political campaigning from the nra's account. I don't follow their lobbying arm.
@CB_556 @NRA @tedcruz If you click on their tag it says National Rifle Association. The link they provide takes you to an outside page that is their lobbying website. It's is distinctly seperate.
@CB_556 @NRA @tedcruz This is correct. This Nra account is the non profit. Nra lobby is their lobbying account.
@NRA @tedcruz Non profit organazation campaigning politically right here.
@RealestBobbyJ @collisindc @rick5258 @pebonilla @NoahCRothman He might of been. Probably not though considering the amount he spent vs. the amount of traveled in gas. Like those aren't close places. The profit would be so little. More likely he said to himself i want this much because it's way more abundant here so i can take this much home
@rick5258 @pebonilla @NoahCRothman It's not really. It's seems like a crazy amount because a lot of people buy a lot less at a time but that has to do with what they can personally afford.
@TonyRomm @NolanDMcCaskill It's completely appropriate. Clickbait trash is has dominated unopposed for too long. Yoir mad about clickbait trash not being clickbait trash.
@micrme @thehill @SethAbramson I wonder if some of the same people were involved.
@micrme @thehill @SethAbramson I read an article a while about saudi diplomats who were visiting and they ending up like holding a women hostage in like a villa. Like a cop found here trying to scale the ten foot walls trying to get out. They arrested somebody but then they went back to saudi arabia.
@micrme @thehill @SethAbramson Trump and trump world co. think money is power. Power is power and money is a little game to people with it. Pompeo should have blocked the ability to even accept the transfer of money when this happened. We look very weak to the world with this shit.
@micrme @thehill @SethAbramson The money was already promised to u.s..	The best assessment is Saudi's weren't intending to pay it without someone begging for it. Then this happened and they found out pompeo was coming and decided to pay it. If accepted if all good, if not it's a bigger problem.
@DesJarlaisTN04 @CNBC What? Quitting a job doesn't represent optimism. The weird shit people say..
@GOPChairwoman It's only offensive is you can make a presumption of who he's referring to. The offending part is we already know.
@NYTMetro He's the leader of gang. The end.
@Ali_H_Soufan Not for nothing it just sounds like you were sitting and waiting for an opportune time to send this message. Like you had it waiting in your back pocket for a really long time.
@PhilipRucker @CMorelloWP Nothing says transparency more than sending the cia
@markfollman A couple people mentioned a list between u.s. admin and saudi officials.	Was it like a hit list? Cause it sounds like a hit list? Or at least someone giving a greenlight to go after certain people.
@THR Me: "this burger is delicious"	Someone in the distance: "Yo, Fuck you"	Me: "this burger is still really really good"
@mitchellvii Wow.
@RVAwonk Disagree. It really is that simple. This is the problem right here. A deliberate use of jargon to explain simply terrible people.
@Wonko_the_sane_ It's true. The "realer" reason i could presume is that the saudi response was that investigation into a single person's death would implode the u.s. economy while commiting actual genocide.
@JasonKirell Also a helicopter blew up with like 15 really high ranking people when mbs took over and it was just like oh well that happened.
@JasonKirell For a clearer contrast the constant call of iran to become a democracy supporting equal human rights while preferring to deal with the monarchy of saudi arabia because royalty has absolute power and final say.
@JasonKirell Support military dominance in a region with the supply of weapons and logistics in exchange for the cheap sale of natural resources while ignoring extremist elements the money is going to.
@ddale8 It's actually the opposite.
@eveewing Population: Tire
@nangbaby @Underrated_Dom @TopRopeTravis @Alyssa_Milano @shaunking @jemelehill @tarastrong @SamuelLJackson @LeoDiCaprio @ProudResister @kingtorch2297 @PalmerReport Picture is how i feel about that guy dan bongodingo
@AndyRichter He coulda said anything. That giant shirt with that tight vest making his sleeves all puffy with the legs out of frame had me captivated.
@theotherhilary Duh...rocky
@AmandaHuggin1 @senatemajldr @JerryDunleavy fingers. That's how fast being lawful to not being lawful can happen.
@AmandaHuggin1 @senatemajldr @JerryDunleavy A couple things here. I actually agree the way shit was handled was terrible as far as the sherrif guy israel being completely imcomptent. It's not the only shooting to happen. It's like an actual epidemic. Your a lawful person until your not. It's that simple. You can snap your
@AmandaHuggin1 @senatemajldr @JerryDunleavy When you or someone else says he's a partisan or it's political yea man of course it is. What else would it be?
@AmandaHuggin1 @senatemajldr @JerryDunleavy I don't your getting it. If someone wants to change a law or have a law created or do anything involving a law they have to enter the world of politics in some way or shape or form. He didn't do it to mourn is child. He did it in an attempt to protect other people's children.
@AmandaHuggin1 @senatemajldr @JerryDunleavy Yea that time. His kid died because he's an operative. Ya know people are allowed and often do act on their own accord and voilition.
@ChrisFa50293098 @senatemajldr @JerryDunleavy Get the fuk outta here with that weak shit. You extend your hand to me and talk and i don't hear you imma say i didnt2hear you or imma pull a trademark point at my ear and shrug like i can't hear you and and i gotta go. That shit excuse weak son.
@senatemajldr @JerryDunleavy Member that time that guy walked up to that other guy and said hi im the parent of a kid that was killed in a school shooting and extended his arm to shake his hand and the guy  just looked at him and walked away?
@JetpacksWasYes2 @Xayanami @VenomMovie Haven't seen it yet but i will. Prolly in theater to. Give a fuk what other people think. A lot of people love totally boring movies so we'll see. Also i can't stop randomly saying to myself we are venom to myself throughout the day just cause it's an awesome catchphrase.
@FindMyNucleus @Spf_Follows @VenomMovie If i had them rights i wouldn't give em up for anything. Also sony just put out a spiderman game. Those games in general have a slower depreciation rate then other games. I can't see how it would benefit them.
@Spf_Follows @VenomMovie Why would marvel give disney venom?
@JasonLeopold It's bait. Like all their shit. It's a play to pretend they hold all the cards.
@business Jesus christ with this shit. It's a good move. You get a guaranteed base pay. 15 an hour. It's always such a weird version of reality when people who don't exist in the world of warehousing and logistics talk about what they know so little about. Fight me son!
@ndrew_lawrence I don't know how ya do it.
@DaveWeasel Why u hatin on little ceasars?
@aseitzwald @mikememoli Really? Goddamn. He should a throw me couple dollars.
@JasonKirell Beer bottles. Upside down. Not personal experience. Saw some pics. It's weird. Dude kav a fucking party bro. Like that guy you don't think about and then you wonder what happened to that guy he was a space case. Now we know.
@1floridawoman @CBSNews @LindseyGrahamSC He wanted the sound bites. You want a charade this is it.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews @ChickfilA And he's gone.
@TomCottonAR Those are better phrase then slams, pounds, tosses, etc., etc.. I mean every hardline right wing media outlet runs headlines playing on double meanings knowing they're insinuating physical harm so fuck right off with that rationale.
@thehill The 10 day delay. Not the ten day delay.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity Everybody loves applause and wants to feel welcomed lindsey. If not you they'd do it to someone else.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity If anyone hasn't listened to hannity's radio show which is far more disingenuous then him on t.v. which is already terrible it would clue you in as to why this senator has been steadily and constantly losing his moral gumption.
@CR Wow.
@stengel So when someone says they don't remember from drinking it's not that they don't rwmember anything. They just don't remember any action in reality.
@stengel You wake up with no recollection. Like for real. You remember that you didn't remenber. That's why it's called a black out because it's an entire block of time you remember as pitch black. You don't not remember. You remember a time block of pitch black.
@craftbeersoflre @thegarance Yep that's my avatar. A picture of a character from a cartoon. Not me as a person.
@craftbeersoflre @thegarance If you knew what my profile picture was you would like it and laugh.
@yvee528 @thegarance He's not out of control. To me he seems like a guy pretending to be a quiet modest guy but is really a belligerent and irate guy. Take the thought of whatever job title he carries put him in any local bar and he's that guy.
@kathbarbadoro Thank god. I thought it was just me.
@thegarance If i knew i was right and i knew it with all my might my response wouldn't look like this. I could look anyone in the eye and tell them what i thought.
@thegarance His anger didn't even seem genuine. Like if anger looking down at a script every sentence and then looking up and saying something loudly while contorting your face to try and express any type of frustration. I don't know that ain't anger.
@davidfrum I know a guy afraid of heights. If he needs to do work up there he's going up.
@benshapiro https://t.co/2FoLKQXtvb
@mj_lee That's actually a damn good answer.
@trueamerica1st @realDonaldTrump Man they keep putting those bleachers closer to the stage.
@abn1915 @MoZone @ABC7 The principle is wrong.
@abn1915 @MoZone @ABC7 You don't do the work. You don't get the grade. Had they allowed partial credit for turning it in late that'd be fine. We always need good teachers. This is an example of a good teacher.
@BillKristol Coffees decent, donuts are small and over priced and aren't really that good. My comparison is the chinese guy down the way who's been running a donut shop since i was a kid. God damn american hero. Shop opens at 3:30 am every day.
@AdamWeinstein It's amazing. He looks like he would eat you with a smile. He should just go and stand near the other team's bench for the entire pre game.
@senorrinhatch Oh cuban american. I thought he was texan my bad then.
@Forbes I was closing in on buying a monthly bus pass but was worried if i lost it I'd be out a couple of 20's. I opted out and got the weekly.
@RT_com The mania is agents killing someone in the u.k. and 2 guys killing someone pretending they want on vacation together for a day and a half after being physically seen with putin. Like wholly shit carmen san diego has a better assortment of operatives.
@RT_com Damn.  I used to watch rt cause it had pretty neutral reporting. This is just trash reporting. Referring to a guy who's name you already know as "the man" and narrating his defense is fucking ughh. Terrible.
@RadioFreeTom That's funny. He's a timid little man. That's a weird expectation
@MalcolmNance @nytmike The people fired were the ones who didn't accept the uninvited request for their own resignation.
@MalcolmNance @nytmike My take is possibly wrong but i feel confident in the assumption is the "leak" was rosenstein was resigning like so many others without him even knowing about his own resignation. The response to which would rationally be nah your gonna have fire me.
@CalebJHull not drinking ourselves into oblivion.
@CalebJHull Story says repulicans knew last week. So what's up with that? Anyone with eyes can see that some sketchy shit went down. Like it's either it did go down that way or people were so drunk they don't even remember doing it. Not one person came forward to say hey we were absolutely
@NFLFootballOps Garbage. Clean hit. I get the helmet to helmet and all that but that right there is a clean hit. Some bullshit. I mean wtf.
@rickhasen That's exactly it. It always the same shit. Say some crazy garbage that all people find absolutely batshit wait it out and then get propped back up by the same trash people.
@BamaUncle @peterjhasson https://t.co/jTYiEtuqIP
@kenklippenstein Stop lying like you weren't running around with those reverse tapered jenco jeans.
@amahnke I need that on a shirt. It's pretty awesome.
@BradMossEsq Crazy people
@milo_noblet @mattsinger7 @DannyTurner2016 @SuzeMarsupial over an electrical line than stomped through the house with muddy boots from the back to front door when i was at work. Like what the fuck.
@milo_noblet @mattsinger7 @DannyTurner2016 @SuzeMarsupial For steam cleaning (i have my own) and painting were of pictures immediately after I left. Like there was still like a small decoration hanging off the wall so they would've had to take it down paint and then put it back up. The worst is they cut a neighbors tree that was hanging
@milo_noblet @mattsinger7 @DannyTurner2016 @SuzeMarsupial It's typically just your money back or double in some states if not returned in a timely manner. You can request an itemized list with what services where performed and each price for each item. Like my last landlord tried to charge for cleaning and their post cleaning pictures
@politico Only because you give it attention. You idiots continue propel the idea that someone is bigger than they are and than act astonished when crazy person idea's become normal  precendence.
@AsteadWesley Real people know this is a pic of cup o noodles and the packs you crunch up by hand are cheaper. https://t.co/sU3fLgK4ZD
@armandlaurin48 @Orange_n_Blues @FoxNews Think of where you live and all the objects in it. You've likely positioned them accordingly to make navigation throughout far easier. Like your tv is most likey not sitting in the middle of the bathroom floor.
@armandlaurin48 @Orange_n_Blues @FoxNews Home field advantage doesn't just apply to sports. They're native to the area. People are crafty. The more time you give a person in a specific place the more they can accomadate for all of it flaws.
@Orange_n_Blues @armandlaurin48 @FoxNews I wouldn't invite you in. Life in infinitely more valuable than inanimate objects.
@Orange_n_Blues @armandlaurin48 @FoxNews Same thing as a bank. It's not the job of a ship crew to protect merchandise if it means putting their lives at risk. I operate a forklift if you come in to rob the place fucking take it. Like that shit ain't on me to stop you.
@Galtfan1 @HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch not allowed to see.
@Galtfan1 @HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch There's a blank sheet of what he actually was doing while employed. Our officials serving us are just that ours collecetively so a call for complete transparency is not some far fetched thing to ask for. There's thousands upon thousands of documents that people are saying were
@Orange_n_Blues @armandlaurin48 @FoxNews The lack of abundance for local commercial fisheries means a lack of internal regualtion in regards to crimes committed in the ocean. Like if they had their own industry they'd be far more inclined to prevent these types of crimes.
@Orange_n_Blues @armandlaurin48 @FoxNews That's a stereotype in perception because of the word pirate. If you think about what you would actually have to know and be physically capable of to be a succesfull pirate you'd be like holy shit these guys are good.
@armandlaurin48 @Orange_n_Blues @FoxNews They did that already. After a time companies will stop hiring security forces (mercs) because when nothing happens for a long time they see it as a negative hit to their overhead expenses.
@Orange_n_Blues @FoxNews because they forget why they were hired in the first place. Also saw another doc where it explained foreign commercial fishing ships take all the fish so local fisherman have little to catch and sell or even people who go to fish for themselves.
@Orange_n_Blues @FoxNews I watched a whole documentary (forget the name) where it explained they could redesign cargo ships to prevent this stuff but hiring outside security forces to be stationed on the vessels is more profitable and over time when nothing happens conpanies cut the security forces
@Galtfan1 @HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch -is*
@Galtfan1 @HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch I'm not trolling. Easy to spot a troll is spotting a telltale handle and reviewing the political memes they have posted. Self reflection is might serve you best.
@HunterAntifa @Galtfan1 @senorrinhatch no answer I'm not telling you they'd be like yea nah we're good.
@HunterAntifa @Galtfan1 @senorrinhatch Your claim that he is highly qualified isn't an adequate assessment since most of his files are being withheld from review. Like if my resume had a multiyear gap without explanation and i just put i work here and the prospective employer said what did you do there and i said no
@Galtfan1 @HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch The importance of this specific job should be different. The person accepting the offer is fully aware they are committing themselves to a lifetime appointment of public service.
@HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch Sort of not really though. It's been like a week. What's fishy is ed whelan coming out with a nutjob conspiracy theory with a 300k salary with others saying keep an eye on his thread. Like what time and what words for that money with that job makes any sense at all?
@Galtfan1 @HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch So what? I mean aside from october 21st being less than a month away what does that matter? Inform me of why that's a big deal in any relevant way.
@Galtfan1 @HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch I don't you should be allowed to at this job. Like it's a life time apponitment. You bare minimum have to hit 63 years old or 65 years old and not receive a pension just social security like anyone else in any other job. It's supposed to be the highest for of public service.
@HunterAntifa @senorrinhatch It's a life time job. What's a week or two?	How come the judge's appointed to it are allowed to retire on their own accord if it's a life time job? That don't make sense to me.
@senorrinhatch What is the committee's agenda?
@benshapiro It takes less than 3 days to drive across the country.
@JohnCleese Her*
@JohnCleese You can be so good you are able to point out all the flaws within a game and still be excellent at it or be so bad you blame the entire game on why your not good at all. Here catalogue of trophies indicates she really is that good.
@JohnCleese She says everytime she comes here she always has problems. She's been there many times. At one event inclusive of the entire sport is surely not the worst behavior. That would be making a selective comparison.
@UweBollocks 90 dollars a day. It says on a lotta of vacant billboards signs across various interstates that I've personally travelled and witnessed.
@realDonaldTrump Fucking crazy person writing this shit.
@dburbach Is there carpet? Those little bastards can live under carpets. They need to check along all the baseboards and vents for brownish stains (it's blood).
@dburbach 1 means there's likely hundreds more.
@PickardJE @MarkDiStef Not for nothing that's a damn good toaster they invested in. Look at that bread. It's perfectly toasted.
@TuckerCarlson Forgot i still had this bum on my timeline.
@JerryDunleavy Meh. He threw paper towels at people in response to a hurricane.
@kdrum They wanted a storyline they could back and promote. You don't understand. They don't give a fuck what you think. People with common sense are kryptonite to fucking liars.
@rolandscahill Whatever he says will be accompanied by the crying laughing smiley face emoji like 50 times. The trademark of insincere dumbfuckery.
@matthewstoller For 300k+ like damn for them words?
@amaninacity @EdWhelanEPPC I wanna say more but what i would say would create a trap used by others to promote a certain narrative. Forget how your romanticizing or villianizing anyone and just use what you know about what you can accomplish objectively.
@amaninacity @EdWhelanEPPC Yo listen. I owned a bike. Several as a kid. I could bike anywhere. Like anywhere. As a kid on his bike i could would never consider if where i was bike friendly. Your a kid on a bike. Your not mapping your destination like a road trip. You just think yea imma go this way.
@EdWhelanEPPC I don't. Your synopsis lends credibility to it all. The distance. The friendships. The lay out of the house. Like wtf.
@amaninacity @EdWhelanEPPC You can also walk 3.6 miles quite easily.
@amaninacity @EdWhelanEPPC You can be rich and own a bike.
@EdWhelanEPPC Major*
@EdWhelanEPPC You know what's missing from this whole story. Bikes. Like kids own bikes. I live in a mahor city. Give me a bike i get anywhere fast as shit. 3.6 miles. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Maybe less.
@EdWhelanEPPC I read threads until i see something that doesn't make sense. 3.6 miles ain't shit.
@darrensands @AsteadWesley Yughh.
@BondJohnBond @SamAdlerBell I could be absolutely wrong and the letter could be 100% in earnest. Why would they post this letter publicly and say it's an attempt at smuggling without knowing what they're talking about? That's not in anyway me defending them. Just a sincere question that deserves an answer.
@mike_pence @JohnJamesMI @GOP @realDonaldTrump Yo. He's your boss. That's pretty funny. Think about that for a minute.
@SamAdlerBell the company who has all the books they let in. What big plan is there in that?
@SamAdlerBell Books are the drugs. The org is the person the c.o.'s let in with the drugs. Don't bring more than 4 at a time. Donation paper is the money for getting the drugs in. Why would would you need to white out a bunch of stuff and go to usps to type shit up instead of asking
@roddreher That is a weird slanted take right there.
@KrangTNelson He's orbiting you.
@Pontifex All i can do is contemplate how one of the most powerful organazations on this planet molests children. Like what?
@ChampkinsFox @DLoesch @DaveVescio Holy shit. Gas mains are exploding. Like in reality Fuck thomas the train and fuck the kkk.
@ChampkinsFox @DLoesch @DaveVescio You do not have to be self aware to convey this.
@ChampkinsFox @DLoesch @DaveVescio Yea yea your right i just read the article and it was fucking dumb. Being upset at a cartoon including a black character than pivoting to nazi and racism is predisposed inherent rasicm ingrained in society not ideological diversity. It's bonafide rasicm.
@DLoesch @DaveVescio It's a fucking cartoon. Your an adult. It's a fucking cartoon.
@speculawyer @BreitbartNews It's like one of those merit based systems or something.
@BradMossEsq They know they can't assert he was a crack dealer. Don't for a minute think someone isn't working this angle.
@petersterne Imma get ahead of the next move here and tell you to expect an incoming picture of an ashtray with a half smoke joint or blunt. A small baggie with a loose paraphernalia laying around in what appears to be an unkept area in an other wise fairly clean envirorment.
@NatashaBertrand I'm not saying the reporter made it up. I'm saying the source did.
@NatashaBertrand It wasn't leaked. It's made up. For real think about that shit. They scavenged his apartment? For what? Why would anyone do that? After everyone already knows how it went down?
@RobbieQT Pigeons are good. Like they're descendants of war heros who jobs have been outsourced. Next time you look at a pigeon think about that shit.
@pattonoswalt @sunny_hundal He's a goddamn genius.
@TuckerCarlson Your hair looks like a detachable lego piece.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump If anyone still hasn't figured it out yet Banon is Stacy Keach's character from American History X (your welcome).
@nahmias Who talks like that? I had to look up straphanger because who talks like that? Some weird mutherfuckers in politics i tell ya.
@jeffbcraven @DrJeffRatliff @DMPACE1 @olgakhazan Most people don't realize that the sea level on the east coast is perfect for bread making. That's why it's hard to understand it not being good.
@jbouie The last of us. The storyline is just as good as a blockbuster movie. The gameplay is really good to.
@brithume @SalenaZito Also it should be The happy candymaker vs. the confectional wisdom. C'mon
@brithume @SalenaZito Ruling class?
@brithume @SalenaZito 'of what is really needed in this country; rebuilding trust between the working class and the ruling class.'
@RadioFreeTom I had to create my own story line. In my view the martian with matt damon in now the prequel. It makes more sense that way.
@AndrewBroering @ebruenig absolute*
@AndrewBroering @ebruenig Jedi are the worst. Like were all about abosulte good until were not. 	Anakin: i cut a guys head off	Obiwan: meh	Anakin: killed a bunch of young jedi	Obiwan: that's way different, gimme them legs boy
@SteveKingIA This is one of the most rascist statements I've ever seen from a modern politician.
@RealJamesWoods You know nothing about him. A friend told you he's a extremist. Not only do i not believe you. You are a liar.
@jamesoliphant He's really looking out for all those soybean farmers.
@shondarhimes That's a weird rule coaching from the stand is it? Never knew it existed. Like every sport i can think of has a coach like right there so i don't really get why it'd be a big deal. Also don't think she would cheat. His punishment should be having to play a match against her on tv
@kenvogel Here's a serious question: Who the fuck is he to dismiss any inquiry of the free press? Like what does he do that allows him to be so evasive to anyone who attempts to engage with him?
@FGraham76 @phillydotcom @tylerperry @Haves_Have_Nots @JeniceArmstrong He already was ok though. Daniel day lewis made fucking shoes and nobody gave a damn. Like that was his job. Like is it worse to be shamed for a job or to have sympathy to think of someone's job as an in between. Like that was his job. You can't be inbetween your own reality.
@ChrisEvans Your response doesn't really matter. The goal is to incite reaction. He's not an intellectual leader or deep thinker by any merit or term. Here's the conundrum. How can we dismiss this type of continual nuisance to common decency without further elevating attention to it.
@MalcolmNance @benshapiro He wrote an article in newsweek where he all but dismissed rascism as singular problem unique to the rebuplican party. He said arabs live in sewage. He's a prodigy of right wing radio.

@SEPTAPHILLY @LFFStadium @MillerLite Cool now explain to me why my keycard doesn't work. I put money on it. I don't free shit. I want my shit to work.
@friggensweet @MattShaw @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @mattgaetz @jack No. I just read this and this just became dumb.
@mainr4trump2020 @Arauz2012 @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @mattgaetz There's a reason people bitch when their bot followers get removed (they pay for them). This ain't a new game their just new to the game.
@mainr4trump2020 @Arauz2012 @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @mattgaetz I see the only way to poosibly prove this is if someone had multiple accounts or hired someone else create multiple accounts to artificially inflate words. Like this shit ain't google adsense it's called boosting.
@friggensweet @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @mattgaetz I mean i see his tweets so i don't get it.
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @mattgaetz I don't get it? What exactly is shadow banning? Like from you perspective?
@thenamecast @JDVance1 @prchovanec Nah man calling rascists alt right or anything other than racist is supporting deniability. Playing a game and the being told it's a rascist tool and saying nah it's mine now and the racists are the tools is pretty damn kewl in my book.
@thenamecast @JDVance1 @prchovanec It's a pretty big puppet show goin on over there right now. That's a dumb signal cause it's a game now. Like if someone did it to me I'd be like dammit ya got me not heil lord o dipshits
@thenamecast @JDVance1 @prchovanec Alt right by which you mean hardcore racists (i don't use codes) aren't funny. Their sense of humor is corroded by stupid beliefs. The symbol zina uses is pretty well known in these here americas as a dumb game which i still may play sometimes with my nieces and nephews.....
@thenamecast @JDVance1 @prchovanec symbol*
@thenamecast @JDVance1 @prchovanec You never played that game? You make that simple below your waist and get people to look at it. It's completely innocent and hilarious cause i think she just trolled all of America and nobody even knows.

@ColMorrisDavis @Nike @DICKS @Starbucks That'll be 400 dollars.
@jemelehill @soledadobrien The only outrage i feel here is how chuck taylors were always 20-25 $bux and then after nike bought them they raised the price to like 40-45 $bux. Some bullshit right there.
@JasonKirell It's pretty weird. Never would attack my own socks. He doesn't seem to understand the plight of randomly not having clean socks in the morning cause you forgot to wash them. He'll learn. Oh he'll learn.
@SethAbramson What you see as an oppurtunity for real answers he also sees as an oppurtunity for whatever agenda he has and wants to spread. It'd would never go how you envision it.
@SethAbramson As I see it him winning as you put it is the consistent whitewashing ot the truth by continuously parading people acting like  terrible renditions of cartoon characters doing anything possible to distort logic and reason.
@SethAbramson I read the whole thing. Amercia and the world in general is too big for the small minds of petty grievances about who belongs where guiding decisions for us. He's welcome a platform of his own creation. Nobody will stop him. We really don't need that shit though.
@Forbes Clickbait headlines are trash. Here's why: money. 	Solved.
@DocKilmer @JerryDunleavy @DavidAFrench If you adopt a baby in pursuits of giving them a decent place in life your just a good person. Better than most people so fuck stupid articles people write about stupid shit. Carry on.
@GOPChairwoman It's not blind, your hiding documents of someone who believes one specific person in america is above the law.
@LissarBee @terrycrews @BuzzEdition @NFL I'm trying to be a custodian for the city. Good pay. Benefits. 8 hour days. What's not to like.
@BradMossEsq 2/2 I was a bagger and a cart attendant. Yea i got your carts. The worst people were the ones who weren't sincere like bruh literal person doing real people shit. Why you talking to me like this shit ain't normal.
@BradMossEsq 1/2. Because they want you to be sympathetic to work that other people might find to be beneath them even though they see it as being beneath them but you better watch out if you think it's beneath you because they want you to believe they don't see it as being beneath them.
@TomiLahren @cvpayne When you truly have no idea what your talking about and need a hot take.
@TomiLahren @cvpayne Yo for real. Yo man. Oh man. Just man. Beef products have country of origin labels. Literally a regulation to say product of whatever country it from. Like wut. Just cause you don't see it in the small portion packages you buy doesn't mean anything.
@markedly Told someone a long time ago the people who invented the globe were really smart. They said you can just use google. I said or you can just use a globe. They said but it's not actual size....
@realDonaldTrump 9 a.m. on a thursday with this shit.
@RepLeeZeldin No
@realDonaldTrump Quite literal and blatant obstruction of an active investigation. You even admit to be the reason.
@realDonaldTrump And there's what everyone already knew. It doesn't matter if your good at your job with this guy.
@kenklippenstein You gonna need to prove that. It's like impossible unless all players are human.
@mokonzi2k9 @CBSNews And then you can come back to reality where defending yourself in this type of situation can get you killed. There's even a moment you can witness the man being attacked weighing his options.
@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo You threw paper towels at people in response to a hurricane.
@eugenegu Poor is in quotes because i was taught poor is a state of mind your just broke.
@eugenegu This isn't a true statement. His effort to make it happen were admirable but it affected "poor" people negatively. A single adult had to pay nearly a 60 dollar penalty per month for being uninsured while insurance typically is a much higher cost.
@LilCalamityJane @willcarless @getongab I browsed it one day. Their promoted content to the platform was like one news headline and a bunch of comments people made about jews. The promoted content only has like 5 promoted items on it.

@RepKevinCramer @POTUS So socialism?
@FoxNews The current republican party is whoever is endorsed by fox news. Fox news is headed by rasicts who pretend they're not rasicts. The headache is hiding their rasicm when people who are rasict and don't pretend not to be rasict. What do you do? https://t.co/zWH3bv1RjT

@BuckSexton @BradMossEsq @AndrewCMcCarthy The only real revelation from this meeting is that putin really really wants to assassinate bill browder.
@BuckSexton @BradMossEsq @AndrewCMcCarthy That's a really dumb take. He could have anounced it publicly through a microphone or a press conference instead of acting like a lil punk ass bitch.
@KeatonPatti It's spot on.
@newtgingrich It's quite something that you've chosen self preservation after all the trash you vomit. How punditry dies when shit gets real.
@AriFleischer I think you are insanely naive.
@realDonaldTrump You threw paper towels at people in response to a hurricane.

@RealOmarNavarro @HamillHimself And that's how ya find a snowflake.
@facebook @TVietor08 The harder question is do you ban pages (or people) that spread conspiracy theories or misinfo?	This is not a hard question. If it is a lie, a lie than can be proven is an actual lie then yes.
@kbyrne91 He ate pizza backwards? Tf?
@LindseyGrahamSC It's interesting how you were pretty weary of trump and now your full on riding his coat tails.
@Uncle_Jimbo He doesn't care. It's about the clicks. You even addressing it helps him. It's the fox model.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS  https://t.co/5CZng4kyGS
@BradMossEsq He knows he's lying. How he's still verified after multiple instances of this nonsense is another one of jack's failures on this site.
@ArtofeVan @CNBC Bernie Sanders is right about how money works and who has it. I don't agree some of his solutions although the helicopter bit shows sincere exaggeration.
@ArtofeVan @CNBC someone who is already absurdly wealthy will absorb it. The other argument is a well pushed piece of punditry that the elitist agenda is something constructed by people who have no idea how things work but at the same time are so absurdly wealthy from have no idea how things work
@ArtofeVan @CNBC This is the argument. Well why don't you do it yourself. Their wealth would eventually deplete because they don't control all wealth. They are well aware the imbalance of wealth vs. poverty continues even without them. Another identity will either take their place or
@ArtofeVan @CNBC laughing at a question you wrote implying I stated anything that question rhetorically asked.
@ArtofeVan @CNBC There's a group of billionaires who know they have such a ridiculous amount of money it's absolutely absurd. They agree that it could help a lot of people if their ridiculous wealth were taxed. Nothing to do wity money in each other's favor? I don't understand your emoji of you
@parscale Cite the study
@SteveKingIA Confession: your an elected official and ya needs ta go.
@ArtofeVan @CNBC Instead of living with induced economic anxiety. That's a pitch for opportunity. No ones vacationing around the word for 500 dollars a month.
@ArtofeVan @CNBC The whole Republican speil has been like a 1000 dollars extra a year or some shit like that. So what's 500 a month to people who could sincerely use it. Imagine all the people who knew that they had a place to live next month instead of not knowing. They could apply themselves
@ArtofeVan @CNBC It's always portrayed as a political loss. That's why when anyone politician mentions it their adversaries jump all over it. It's not losing money. The money still exists.
@AnnieLowrey 2/2 What eats me up the most is there was a full case of water next to the ramen. They didn't take one bottle. WHY didn't you take some water for your ramen?
@AnnieLowrey 1/2. Someone smashed the little window on a honda accord i owned. There was dollar bills in the glove box. Change in the cup holder. They popped the trunk and stole a big case of ramen. They left a bag filled with random cd's in the car. I assume as a trade of sorts?
@thehill Not white nationalist richard spencer. It's racist richard spencer. The term is rasict. Putting a rasict in a suit doesn't change their title to not racist.
@jayehmsee @unsuckdcmetro @ATULocal689 Pff. Any union member or former union member would love to have this guy on their team.
@ArtofeVan @CNBC This is always the same argument pressed by people who disagree with it.  He's in favor of the tax also being allocated on his income. That's the entire idea of taxation. It's not rendered onto specific identities.
@benshapiro Lift your hand up in front of your face.	Now look at it's color.
@KrangTNelson I'd rather be in a get up like that and not give a fuck what you think than risk falling, cracking my head open, and then being dead.
@blakehounshell QA=question/answer	Non=non pertinent cause it's fucking stupid.
@Grummz What's trumps newest agenda? Can you answer that and actually know what it is?
@benshapiro Pretty fucking dumb argument. To be successful within the limits of what's feasible at any given time but not okay to point out anything you find fault with within that system.
@GovWalker So scott i went the first page if search results. 7 listings were for the same job in a row on the FIRST page.
@DevinNunes It's 154 million dollars. Not the 15,080 dollars a year your against raising. #Dumbfucksayswhat?
@lurie_john Your implication is from the perspective of your own emotions. I understand what it implies. Being a human being is more than that physically.
@lurie_john Sure is. Human beings are invasive parasites that consume resources. We even classify how well were doing in are social variances as consumers. Obviously we share similarities other than physical characteristics especially emotional response and output.
@lurie_john That's open to some serious interpretation.
@SheriffClarke Protests are legal. They are the exact opposite of rhetoric in a very literal way. We is not you. You are you. You will never get it.
@FoxNews a title and bullshit
@FoxNews What's "Angel" mom? Is that here name? Are you claiming she's and angel? Is it a title? Is it a bullshit headline that has no journalistic integrity? I'm thinking it's a combo of
@lurie_john It's like they conveniently forget Mexico used to be a whole lot bigger.
@alexbgray @RadioFreeTom 2/2 The lack of any type of rent control is expanding an already pretty bad housing crisis all over the country (it's not just a major city thing).
@alexbgray @RadioFreeTom 1/2 No it's not. Remove the numbers from jobs that pay more in commission than the base wage and the notion of a truck driver shortage (there's always a shortage and you can make up any number you want) and you get a much different picture.
@RadioFreeTom I don't think in terms of elites or any of that nonsense.
@RadioFreeTom I don't feel that way at all. At least not by you. I'm frustrated with the gang mentality trump endorses like most normal people. I don't like seeing people lose their jobs. Which i get is because of trump. I still don't like it.
@FoxNews Fixed: 'Anyone who follows baseball knows that opportunities to score are hard to come by'     IF your not good  at baseball.
@RadioFreeTom I know a lot of them aren't the brightest bulbs in the box but what the fuck is this nonsense.
@RadioFreeTom Wtf is this nonsense. Didn't you just recently say people should restrain from the use of certain rhetoric and dialogue so they won't have to look back and regret their choices? How would you not look back and not regret being satisfied with anyone losing an honest job?
@Taggart_Haynes @RyanDelph14 @_Devils14 @espn It looks low after the batter raises his leg. It's a really close call if your watching from when his leg is planted before he lifts it. He wanted a gimme and didn't get it. Reminds me of Ryan Howard in the world series.
@Taggart_Haynes You can hit that ball in the zone. I can only go by what I see in the video. Pretty confident you put that ball in the program part of it's gonna be in the zone.
@_Devils14 @Taggart_Haynes @espn Just watched it like 20 times. Over the plate and it breaks after the knee. I'd be pretty pissed as a pitcher if your not counting that. No need to justify consistency. It's a strike.
@SheriffClarke @AmericaFirstPAC @JoeTalkShow @townhallcom 8 months vs. 4 months	Do you know how to play chess?
@seanspicer No it was a BULLSHIT excuse used to play a partisan game. Muthafuckers over here trying to change the rules of the game after it already started. You bitches wanted to play the game. Let's play bitch.
@mattklewis @hughhewitt You ever work in a freezer or the extreme cold?
@VP @POTUS Counterpoint: your a bum.
@GovWalker His attraction to it is you'll bend over backwards for him. Your like a little worm that wriggles everytime you get to say the word foxconn.
@parscale @realDonaldTrump That is a lie. You are lying.
@ChadPergram So....socialism? 	Ma..ga..?
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump He is remembered for strongly defending slavery.		Oh what do ya know.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump From what i can tell from this portrait or model John c Calhoun looks like an asshole.

@kibblesmith I'm reall confident he doesn't even know who he is.
@realDonaldTrump I mean that's a hard loss there buddy. Only option here is to say harley davidson is unamerican and people who ride harley davidsons are not americans. Go ahead say it directly into the microphone please.
@realDonaldTrump Ironic in the midst of it all the name McMaster appeared. It's not here or there just like fate transpired.
@uren_marc The sound of music starring ben wright. A muppet special.
@realDonaldTrump Wat? I'm tired bro. Your nonsense is boring me. It's funny to think that as long as your in that office you HAVE to talk about stuff i know you don't give a shit about. How was that meeting on douchenozzle surpluses?
@BillClinton @AshaRangappa_ When I look at this picture I think of pretty fucked stuff you guys did. In no way do i feel humbled or appreciative of it.
@Etiolated @SageHillfarms @IChotiner @chrislhayes I had to look up the definition so please don't think this is a gotcha cause i also wasn't too sure about it.		 The use of irony to mock or convey contempt
@Etiolated @SageHillfarms @IChotiner @chrislhayes You retweeted a joke involving stabbing dogs about the very subject.
@RepLeeZeldin That still doesn't explain why you touch yourself at night.
@matthewjdowd advice*
@matthewjdowd This is terrible advise for people who get physically bullied.
@SageHillfarms @IChotiner @chrislhayes No it wasn't you. Just really dry. Even I had to do a double take.
@SageHillfarms @IChotiner @chrislhayes Pretty sure it's a joke.
@davidmweissman It's just you. Welcome to the game.
@realDonaldTrump Mar a lago serves dirty floor hotdogs 	It barely passed a health inspection
@mgerrydoyle 2/2. As the court jester it's all about the short game. As much entertainment as possible in a small time period. The more bored people become the worse it is for him.
@mgerrydoyle 1/2. Well trump ran on two platforms.	1. As a rich man scheming with other rich men to scam the shit out of regular people.	2. As a fucking court jester (he would not have 1 without 2.)
@realDonaldTrump @RepClayHiggins Doesn't really have the same effect after linking to a teenage boys account.
@realDonaldTrump @jimmyfallon Be a man! By the way he seriously messed up my hair!!
@RadioFreeTom How many times can you ask for people who don't give a shit to be shunned or shamed? I don't really know how I feel about it but all your suggesting/comparing is the same exact thing we already have.
@ishaantharoor It's like everyone knew what the outcome would already be.....
@brianstelter @David_Bossie But they do.
@evansiegfried How much you wanna put down. It's not an offer but they're being told either sign here or you'll be put in prison for ever and never see your kid again. If your at a precinct and an officer tells you to sign something they don't tell you don't have to sign it.
@glennbeck You don't get to screen your calls for suck ups and morons to dismantle here glenn. Coulda woulda shoulda is pretty. played out.
@Uncle_Jimbo It doesn't work that way. You can't push and push at the notion that it's a good idea to have no respect for others and then be upset when the door finally breaks open.
@3L3V3NTH He's not. It's full on radio punditry adopted to this platform. At every turn. If you listen to any of them for a time and realize this has been their tool of engagement for decades it all makes a lot more sense.
@Uncle_Jimbo "For unarmed shootings or misidentification shootings, data are too uncertain to be conclusive"		Like ya didn't even read the study like that would even be possible because there is no link I found to any mathematical chart in existence.
@kenklippenstein I don't believe in the mind control bullshit but there's still someone crazy shit that happens
@kenklippenstein I mean there's some weird shit you hear throughout your life and you think yo it could be true, the people in charge were pretty crazy and idiots at the same time. I just learned monsanto helped developed agent Orange. public info but i didn't know. Who the fuck knows anymore.
@newtgingrich Bait
@DestinyTheGame Why people give more money to same people after getting ripped off I'll never know.
@DestinyTheGame Remember when you delivered a half developed game that didn't have a p2p trade system that you specifically said would exist and sucked up and paid for fake pre release rewards claiming you won some bullshit non existent awards. That was destiny one.
@jordanbpeterson 2/2. And he just follows you and you just gotta turn around and tell him to fuck off. It's not that I don't care about what your saying, it's that I don't care about what your saying.
@jordanbpeterson 1/2. I'll say I think of you as the guy who comes up with ramdom nonsense and then tries to engage you at a bus stop. At first you try to be polite and your like okay man I'll consider it. Then it goes off the rails and after a time you just say to yourself fuck it I'll walk
@jordanbpeterson I click the link and it just takes me to a site that asks for my money so I can see what you've written.
@WorldofIsaac I liked the ending of the show dexter.
@parscale The entire campaign your running is absolutely dependent upon click bait and commenting on comments.
@JerryDunleavy Well the argument would be ideologically we choose are politics as individuals and is very much a choice so you have the right to refuse an invidual based on that individual. The argument you make would only be valid if it is your belief homosexuality is a choice.
@Adrian_Hilton Nope. *waves from America*
@rickygervais Weak you stole that joke. It's a bit modified but still weak.
@nedryun Legos? Knex? How many pieces you got. Just saying I'm trying to get in on something like that. If your gonna say momentum then meh I'm not really looking for that at the moment.
@GovMikeHuckabee Also worth noting huckabee went after starbucks because homeless people. His literal objection to that whole situation is people who are homeless are not palatable to him.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC @JoeTalkShow @DonaldJTrumpJr That's your burn? A girl's bike? Weak sauce.

@kilmeade Yes you did and no you don't. You say something there, you apologize here. You have your head so far up trumps ass it's covered in shit. No need for a witty joke here.
@davidwebbshow @TheDemocrats @HillaryClinton Ask yourself who would write a headline starting with 'MS-13 gang members, including 10 illegal immigrants, post the pictures of two teens who's ethnicity isn't classified as caucasion and then only if you read the article you learn they're both the victims and are citizens.
@KenCalvert The fuck outfa here with a disservice to our nation. Words of a despot or someone who wants to be one.
@ALT_uscis @kilmeade The way things are i wouldn't be surprised to learn he's trying to kiss other peoples kids with that mouth.
@SirHypn0s @Noseferatut @Walmart @Murk361 Very little because you don't know how to rotate stock.
@realDonaldTrump I honestly just remembered that you threw paper towels at people in response to a hurricane.
@LouDobbs @POTUS They don't need a lot R's on any bill. Just a couple.
@LouDobbs @POTUS He's still got some clout and he can still burn the barn with you in it. Keep pushing I'd very much like to see where this takes us.
@realDonaldTrump Either you convinced your wife this was a good idea or she also liked the idea. That's the real issue.  I really don't care for the petty media grab.
@RepGosar 'pharmaceutical companies who have the audacity to make pain medications to alleviate suffering' 	This right here is what makes the argument your pushing bullshit to me.
@SenatorCardin 4. Where are the girls?
@Uncle_Jimbo Your defending a grown man from children.
@Scorched_Deer @Noahpinion Every one except nazi is the name of an actual person.
@RadioFreeTom Then why don't you run? Is that a stretch. I mean I'll probably disagree with half of your bullshit but hey why the fuck not at this point right?
@KimDotcom Well it was your decision to boost him before it happened. I get you want a divided place because your bitter about what they did to you but ya know that shit ain't cool.
@Uncle_Jimbo What are official buisness hours? I would very much like to play this game.
@seanspicer @ABC Your a potato
@benshapiro There are people locked in cages and missing as a result of someone who's proponents are white supremacists. If you haven't been paying attention they just blackbagged and disappeared a list  of targets.
@allahpundit @benshapiro Always the moral compass. If you were on fire and I had to take a piss I'd aim the other way.
@waltshaub @Elise_Jordan Let's not do that. I get your investment in the crisis and it's commendable but this would be animating a serious issue. It's not a good move in the long run.
@TopherSpiro @JeffFlake I honestly don't think a lot of them know what powers they have to wield. I certainly don't. You should share a list of the options possible.
@IjeomaOluo I don't practice Judaism. I descend from jews. There is no record of that part of my ancestry other than arriving from there to here. I completely condone the comparison.
@GeraldoRivera @seanhannity aren't*
@GeraldoRivera @seanhannity I've seen you on the show. Not that episode. They straight up treat you like a patsy and bully the shit out of you. The people on that show are a party of anything except a party of having and creating enemies.
@FOX29philly What bullshit headline. I don't see the author of the article listed.
@factchecknet @GlennKesslerWP Do you know what you did wrong?	You tried to make a fake with an objective and a goal.	That was your error. The true success to it is to create the fake with no objective other than someone saying something they didn't and then creating the conspiracy around it.
@JohnCornyn More and more it seems like you kidnapped babies and abducted girls and keep men and and boys in cages. 	For the future of whatever piece of paper you want somebodies signature on right?
@scruffster1 @brianschatz The history of people being treated as if the have no rights by other people who believe those people don't deserve to have any right. Literal fucking history.
@brianschatz All those uneasy feelings and bad thoughts your having about it. Their true. The girls are in the custody of people who are desensitized from normal human compassion and interaction. Remember that.

@joyjeetchowdhur @Imamofpeace I don't find that funny. I mean I'm not offended. I just don't think it's good material.
@Johnny_Joey Didn't know that. That's on me. As far as the rest of it I stand by it.
@Johnny_Joey That's your reply? He doesn't like trump or pence so obama? Imma say this trump wanted to play this game. All you muthafuckers encouraged him and now your upset because the game is still being played.
@joyjeetchowdhur @Imamofpeace You see how i provoke you with arrogance?	It's so easy. 	What do you think all the your doing everytime you retweet verbatim. Your acting as someone else's vessel. I do it but I try to be a bit more selective.
@Powow22 @Imamofpeace I'm you.
@joyjeetchowdhur @Imamofpeace No. I don't want to. I use people of influence and who have a larger following then me as my vessels  I'm good at it to.

@BrianSimsPA @KurtSchlichter Yeeessss. Yesssss.
@Imamofpeace What are you? What is your worth to me? Who are you to present yourself in all your glory and tell me what other people and what they do and do not deserve?
@CBCNews Just because some says something doesn't make it true.
@CBCNews Cbc don't say because of when you aren't absolutely certain. It is not factual. My suspicion is it is because of the U.N.'s remaks about the situation of family seperation at the U.S. border.
@NYTimesPR @joshsternberg @nytimes He knew he was being recorded?
@AaronBlake It doesn't make any sense. Not one person vetted their contacts? Like hey I'm some guy off the street I got some info you might want to buy. 	Trump jr.:	Manafort:	Caputo:	Stone:	Oh yea sure come on in, I got no idea who you are, you've shown me nothing of value but okay sure.

@DylanByers That's the problem with letting verified accounts priority on timelines with simultaneously letting them retweet with the same priority. In gaming we call it boosting. It's artificial promotion instead of earning chronological merit.

@Timetochange999 @Jerusalem_Post All the blood spots you see on the side and bottom of the mattress is your blood. If you have carpet there's a good chance they migrated underneath of it. Look along your wall for brown or red spots. That's also your blood.
@Timetochange999 @Jerusalem_Post They can last in a freezer for more than 4 days. Remove all linen and mattress'. It's not worth trying to save them.
@Timetochange999 @Jerusalem_Post That won't kill them. They are arthropods and incredibly resilient. 	Extreme heat in excess of 180 degrees for a prolonged period of time will. Also dry powder to line around baseboards and walls to remove humity from the air. They thrive in warm envirorment but not extreme heat.

@rolandsmartin @NEA @SchottFound My question wasn't asked of malice. Thanks for answering.
@KingMike33 @MrRDPierce @rolandsmartin I don't really know about any of that. I went to public school. My elementary school was actually the number 1 school in the city when I went there out of all schools public, private, religous, charter. I was enrolled in a public highschool but you probably wouldn't find me there
@MrRDPierce @KingMike33 @rolandsmartin same company you pay for the practice test and to administer the actual test.
@MrRDPierce @KingMike33 @rolandsmartin I never said that. I know members of my family who's children attend charter school explained to me the school pays for multiple practice test before a standardized test and because they do pay for it they do better. They think it's a fucked up system as well because it's the
@MrRDPierce @KingMike33 @rolandsmartin -the*
@MrRDPierce @KingMike33 @rolandsmartin I get that and I'm not really in favor of a complete takeover of public education. I don't know rolands deal I'll ask him. Roland have you endorsed the or promoted the idea of charter schools or school choice in exchange for service or money rendered?
@KingMike33 @MrRDPierce @rolandsmartin You just submitted an article to me from 9-10 years ago. No child left behind was replaced in 2015.
@KingMike33 @MrRDPierce @rolandsmartin It's still a lottery which was to create an equal chance because zipcoding does not work and has proven to be an ineffective way of determining schools. If i give you the same test multiple times you will do better vs. trying to teach you what i think might be on the test.
@MrRDPierce @KingMike33 @rolandsmartin 2/2. charter schools pay for 3 or 4 practice test and some of the q and a are on the actual test. Here's the kicker you have to pay for the practice test and the actual test and their made by the same company.
@MrRDPierce @KingMike33 @rolandsmartin 1/2. Actually they do. Charter schools do well because the schools pay for practice psa's test so when they take the psa's their better prepared. Public schools don't because they waste resources. So while a public school might pay for a practice test which is not likely

@omgchomp @lura_groen @ParkerMolloy You already know your gonna be displeased with my lack of reaction to the gif.
@omgchomp @lura_groen @ParkerMolloy I mean if I come across info in passing I'll investigate it or look it up when it randomly peaks my interest. I got no issue or bad blood with us having different opinions.
@FoxNews Hey dan bongodingo that guys wearing your hat. Where you at buddy?
@lura_groen @omgchomp @ParkerMolloy And that's what we were discussing. Children's lives and how they're affected by specific things. Honestly I'm just kinda worn out. Parker blocked me as a result. I'm super transphopic apparently so I'm a take break and go fuck with some politicians.
@omgchomp @lura_groen @ParkerMolloy That's still an opinion I maintain. It's not meant to be hateful at all. I figured I'd engage in discourse when I saw a tweet .
@lura_groen @omgchomp @ParkerMolloy I'm a decent person. I have some hate in me but not for anything on this topic.  I've always been taught you can never ask to many questions.
@lura_groen @omgchomp @ParkerMolloy You don't have to repect my opinion at all. All the questions I've asked is so I can have a more informed opinion.
@lura_groen @omgchomp @ParkerMolloy isn't*
@lura_groen @omgchomp @ParkerMolloy I didn't engage to spew hate or any of that nonsense. I ask questions and give my opinion as to how i perceive things.
@lura_groen @omgchomp @ParkerMolloy If i ask a question and the answer is sufficient to me and i tell you that and you suggest insultingly that i google something or use a dictionary you obviously know the reaction I'll havr to that. My opinion is just that. Mine and an opinion.
@lura_groen @omgchomp @ParkerMolloy Alright whatever.
@omgchomp @lura_groen @ParkerMolloy of being offensive you would definitely know. I shared my opinion and what i believe should be legitimate scientific concerns.
@omgchomp @lura_groen @ParkerMolloy I never said i was an expert. I asked how things chemically change and the response i got it blocks secondary sexual characteristics and i asked what that was. No one answered. I don't have a final say in anything. How i communicate is how i communicate. If i had any intention
@omgchomp @lura_groen @ParkerMolloy I have*
@omgchomp @lura_groen @ParkerMolloy Your talking to the wrong person about that. I've have my ged. I've worked too many jobs to count and lived at just as many places.
@realDonaldTrump You are currently among the worst criminals on earth. That's a whole planet.
@kayla10x @ParkerMolloy Well I think more along the lines of what if the kid is like 6 and the parent feeds them the inhibitors. I mean a kid won't know what's going on. I know it's a rare case it's still an entirely realistic possibility.
@omgchomp @lura_groen @ParkerMolloy No. I got no issue with anyone's intent. As long a persons brain is fully developed to make a mature decision.
@kayla10x @ParkerMolloy How do you reverse course. At some point the brain and body are going to accept it's no longer time to grow.
@yanquette That has to fuck with your brain. Your talking about augmenting the developing body of a child.
@yanquette I'm sketical that it's harmone blockers and not lack of family and societal acceptance that's the greater contributor.
@yanquette What is a secondary sexual characteristic?
@kayla10x @ParkerMolloy I got no issues with people of that age doing whatever makes them happy.
@TheRickWilson I mean germany, berlin coalition. Like what the fuck is this?
@yanquette @ParkerMolloy As an adult I have no issue. Anybody can do anything as long as it doesn't negatively affect anyone else.
@yanquette @ParkerMolloy Are trans people happy as in an equivalent scientific sense as far as body and brain chemicals because because I can't fathom taking medicine especially as an adolescent that inhibits your brain and body from completing it's intention of development?
@kayla10x @ParkerMolloy Here's my issue. If it's what the person truly wants then fine but what about someone who is unsure and does it? 	Also what happens when a parent decides for the child because it's what the parent wants?
@lura_groen @ParkerMolloy Yes I entered with my perception and my bias which is how all people navigate through life. At no point did i contest that i was more informed. I feel my questions about the physical and mental state of someone and possibly people around them are completely rational.
@lura_groen @ParkerMolloy You want engagement for people to understand? This is what you get. It's not gonna be sympathy. It's gonna be questions and a lot of them.
@lura_groen @ParkerMolloy Well here's the fine line. I've seen stories of parents who insist their child is the opposite sex they were born. So what step are there to prevent an adult from cultivating the idea that they know something the child doesn't well before development?
@lura_groen @ParkerMolloy I don't know anything about harmone blockers. Do they have a impact mentally on the brain? Does it stop development of regenerating cells?
@lura_groen @ParkerMolloy I know that probably sounds like some tired argument. I'm sure for a lot of people it's 100% what they want in life. What answer do you have for the children who were honestly completely unsure and would completely regret that decision?
@lura_groen @ParkerMolloy I'm find with people around them supporting whatever intent they may have and feel as long as it doesn't affect others but their brains are not fully developed. For some people it could honestly be confusion.
@lura_groen @ParkerMolloy I can really only counter that with so does under going major voluntary surgery. I don't know how to say this without seeming offensive but I'm gonna say it anyway. They are children they don't know exactly what is correct for them.
@realDonaldTrump Bro look at me. Are you looking? Eyeball to eyeball. You still looking? 	Ahem....fuck you.
@FoxNews @hogangidley45 Hogan Gidley likes to stand in the corner of public bathrooms for extended periods of time.
@ParkerMolloy adolescence*
@ParkerMolloy Ya know i don't really care what people do but i think kids should go through adolescents before making that kind of decision. I mean the people around them can still be supportive and don't have to be negative about any of it. They are still kids though.
@Harlan @Account_DPX That shit eats away at you, i can see it in your words. This is the fucking army you helped assemble. How far you've come.
@Harlan @Account_DPX It when you make shit up to troll because you didn't look at his profile and he's a troll. He doesn't even hide it.  This is the ride you get to take for speaking out of turn. Maga bitch. There's no such thing as concern trolling. They just make shit up.
@AndrewFeinberg You should focus your questions.	Say you are lying and then ask your questions.	He's trying to pull some wizard of oz shit where your paying attention to what he's saying and not the things he's doing.
@Harlan @elpunoFL It means you chose to think about a subject using rational comprehension and vocalize it. You didn't replicate another pundit or defend the policy with no good reason or just stay completely silent. Welcome to the world of maga bitch. These are your people.
@jschneiter @FoxNews Nothing like driving the truck and being like oh yea there goes a maggot on my arm or leg and flicking it off. It's just a maggot. No shit one driver used to eat them.
@jschneiter @FoxNews A restaurant will get a bag and a stand to put the used rags or whatever in. If they leave the bag open you get maggots in the bag.
@jschneiter @FoxNews Maggots near your food is far more common then you realize or want to know. I used to drive a linen truck collecting the tablecloths and what not for restaurants.

@JRPSD @JerryDunleavy No those decisions do get to be made by a public audience and we get to control what it is we feel should take precedence and is important. Minus influence from bots, trolls, and fake accounts of course.
@JRPSD @JerryDunleavy We didn't have access to immediately engage politicians reporters and pundits to question them on a public platform in the presence of a public audience. The story could have been bigger, i don't work there, i have no say in those decisions.
@JRPSD @JerryDunleavy I'm*
@JRPSD @JerryDunleavy Yea i get that. I also one absolutely confident you didn't see the picture when it came out in 2014 either. We didn't have this type of instant access to news stories. I think the outrage is absolutely justifiable.
@JerryDunleavy I'm gonna be honest. I had no idea since it wasn't really reported on in publications or stations I watch. You would think fox would have latched on to the story and not let go. It a shitty thing to do to people no matter who you are.
@kenklippenstein @KurtSchlichter Ha. I'm sorry this dickhead is part of a group that makes shit up all the time. 	So i do and i acknowledge i do it. Also people are literally being removed from each other presence against their will so again fuck him.

@AdamWeinstein Some people just want to be a large part of history regardless of if it's being famous or infamous. Think about all these people try to condemn the idea of broadcasting the name of a shooter because it can create replicators. They do the same thing just on a much bigger scale.

@NoTalk2014 You learn a lot when you work in warehouses for years and have to keep attending the same boring safety meetings.
@NoTalk2014 They wouldn't evacuate but there are very clear rules from osha and the fire department regarding potential hazards. If it continues the company can be charged with negligence and child endangerment because kids are involved.
@rampantgrowth @mrfluffytails @chelseaperetti It's true. You sonofabitch you got me. I consume a lot of sugar.
@BillPascrell Call the fire department. Employers and Employees can not block the view of the nearest exit in case of emergency.
@MaryFabulous3 @BillPascrell They have no window of time so they're denying entry. Thing is the governor of the state and fire department could probably force them to open the door or uncover the window as it's a clear hazard and they are in violation.
@MaryFabulous3 @BillPascrell I guarantee they're scrambling around in there.
@MaryFabulous3 @BillPascrell Because conditions are always worse than are announced. If you know anything about audits you get a window of time to fix things up so most companies will slow production and have they're employees focus on the audit.

@ShaunKing Obviously white supremacy still exists and it's all pretty fucked up but the push to think of jesus as white happened long before anything that can be considered contemporary.
@ShaunKing I think this perception as a bit skewed. The first depiction of jesus as a white man was a painting by Rembrandt in the 15th century as far as I'm aware and it was initially met with critical and negative review by the catholic church.

@TuckerCarlson Is Tucker Carlson a member of ms-13?
@realDonaldTrump How come you sleep in the same bed as your adult sons every night? I'm just saying that's some serial killer shit.

@SteveScalise Or it was an icredible display of arrogance for a company to align to align themselves with something they're well known to be against for the purposes of marketing.
@CalebJHull The doxxing of a family? 	You mean the infamous troll who propagated racism and bigotry?	To further elaborate on this from the reporting I read is that the husband was well aware of what was going on and she had no income to independently pursue this.. So he was her financier.
@lmnicholson68 @Education4Libs I don't think that you think your superior. The point is you replied to and engaged with someone who's statement is specifically crafted to insulting and dismissive. So you don't get to make the statement that when it comes to saying you disengage at these moments isn't true.
@lmnicholson68 @Education4Libs No you don't. As much as you like to think you don't or your above your here discussing the very topic of it. Your right here in the mud and the dirt and the thick of it with the rest of us.
@lmnicholson68 @Education4Libs He wanted to and still wants to play this game. Let's play it.
@lmnicholson68 @Education4Libs In my view it's not a tantrum at all. Trump and the people who elevated him to this position and time marketed a brand of unfiltered hostility. The people who are mad or pretend to be offended in any way by it don't like that it's not a market they get ti corner anymore.
@lmnicholson68 @karlenenation @Mrmikeus @realDonaldTrump That's only when he has people surrounding him. You should go back and watch him pandering to the jewish clergy when he was campaigning.
@JayCaruso Look at his ranking of breakfast food. It's just terribly sad. Tsk tsk
@GovMikeHuckabee Mothafucker your position against a policy of racial diversity is you don't like like homeless people. What kinda scumbag shit is that?
@tntsr615 @6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee I'm not a liberal. I'm not even a democrat.
@realDonaldTrump Shut the fuck up
@owillis the right believes information-no matter how fake-is a weapon. Our side isn't doing that, and it's something average people can do. 		That by any logic is calling for the weaponization of making shit up.
@owillis Your idea is to push stories regardless of if their factual or not?	Most people regardless of which side know what's fake or not. Your missing the entire point. It's about having a champion.
@JacobAWohl No you haven't your a liar.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump So this is fine but insulting the appearance of your daughter is off limits?
@JasonVillalba @MittRomney It's not genuine to call someone out in earnest and then play suck up because they have something tou want.
@jaketapper @JustinTrudeau Wait what?
@tesa15rn @6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee It's not to stand by anything. The entire point of it is to be dismissive towards your opponent.
@tesa15rn @6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee To be as fair as I can on the subject when news broadcasters started appearing in fictional movies that have fictional timelines it added a lot to this claim. I always thought it was a bad move by anyone who decided to do it.
@charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO "The community I'm from is third"	The fuck kinda trash anecdote is that? 	I'm now gonna do a spot on impression of you. Ready?:	I'm Charlie Kirk and I just make shit up.	Spot on.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee I know you don't.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee All of them just not in such demeaning insulting ways. My sincere hope is that whoever his challenger is far more direct and unfiltered than he would be able to anticipate.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee used*
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee when nothing could be further from the truth. Ya know had someone actually told him during a debate to shut the fuck he wouldn't be able to handle it. He knew other politicians were to nice and usex belligerence to his advantage.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee Until he personally met and got the endorsement of the evangelicals everything was still up in the air for him as far as being a front runner. He used the tatic of portraying himself as a blue collar worker with an unfiltered voice to relate to the everyman
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee I don't think he's a racist or a bigot. I've said this before. I think his words and actions promote rasicm and bigotry because. I think he's a narcissist who craves positive attention.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee It's a purposeful division of people for personal gain. I'm from philly. Two hours away in rural areas people think people in major cities have a negative outlook when it comes to them when the truth is nobody gives a fuck.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee The reason i believe It's so popular is there's a lot of people who think other's look down on them or perceive them as backwards. This a propaganda being spread and the more it spreads the more true it becomes.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee I don't disagree with that and i don't believe that the majority of people who rally behind it are even remotely rasict. The thing is the people who crafted this slogan are people who yearn for a time when white males held most if not all of the power to control the laws.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee What point am i missing if it's gone over my head? 	I'll engage with no intention of acting trollish. Explain it to me.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee When was America considered great and by whom? At what time does this slogan specifically refer too?
@RadioFreeTom Oh you didn't know?
@ashleyamm @DLoesch No one's a criminal until they are.
@jmclaughlinSAIS It's not a fantasy or illusion. It's taking place in real time.
@jmclaughlinSAIS This is the real America. You have to come to terms with that and confront it or your doomed to fail.
@GlennKesslerWP Obama was a black democrat. Trump is white and supported by the gop. They don't care about consistency. They only care about having their own champion.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee Btw maga or make America great again is deeply rooted in nationalist rasicm. Not because of where the term has been previously been used but because it refers to a time when success was only truly achievable to white men.
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee other's*
@6bird4 @GovMikeHuckabee It's no issue saying what's on your mind. Pushing policies of other because of whats on their mind becuase they coddle an adult with an inflated ego and sense of self worth is the issue.
@dareisay1 @GovMikeHuckabee I mean if you want to get into a discussion about unfair trade at least know the details of what the fuck your talking about.
@dareisay1 @GovMikeHuckabee I don't disagree with that but on the subject of milk us=43 billion while canada=600 million which is mostly for domestic consumption. I have yet to see him discuss anything about New Zealand or Australia if you want to touch on the subject of cow and bovine trade.
@neeratanden @JustinTrudeau @BarackObama I don't think this at all. His narcissism is from not receiving positive attention.	So he floods his ranks with people who will and they are the people he favors.
@Summer_Poopsiq @GovMikeHuckabee I mean i guess. There's an entire comic, movie, and audio book (i have the audio book, it's really good) about how they shot him into space for this very reason. (Fingers crossed)
@GovMikeHuckabee I don't understand this refence at all. 	Incredible hulk?	He's tough but completely irrational and destroys everything he sees?
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch Yea and it's true. I never used the word impossible. You yourself provided a link backing this up then calling it nonsense.
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch specific law.
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch I even said i have no real vested interest in this very specific subject, only one to the broader idea that the NRA is not in the game of being favorable to restricting gun laws. The only claim is that the law should take presendence bit never a claim of whether they favor a
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch No i never claimed that. Every assumption you've made is exactly that. An assumption of what my thoughts on the subject is from claims I've never made. My only claim is that the sound of gun used with a suppressor can be less than a jackhammer. A metric someone else came up with.
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch your*
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch It would be and you denfense of it not being true is to provide a link to technology that exists for this very reason.
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch acheives nothing. I never made any claim about any impossibility. You presented a claim for your argument then responded against your very own claim: this thing exists, here's a link, there's no reason for this thing to exist.
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch I did actually. Otherwise how would i have cited 90 cities and in use by law enforcement. I specifically answered why i said trained and conditioned as i associated with what you said and it saying veteran in your bio. English is my first language. Deteriorating into insulting me
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch If it's nonsense why would anyone build and present technology used by law enforcement for this very specific reason?
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch interest in that specific subject. I have none other than my issue with the NRA arguing about wanting to create barriers from any form of gun ownership.
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch existing technology. The technology in the link you provide admittingly says it exists in about 90 cities. That may seem like a lot. It is not a lot at all. You mistake me saying something factually true. That the NRA advocated earlier today to deregulate silencers with a vested
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch You mention deployment refering to yourself making it logical to assume it was not on a domestic platform as you have veteran written in your bio (that's where my reference to trained and conditioned comes from). You presented the defense of unregulated silencers because of
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch then*
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch You want to use this as a defending factor? Advocate for the installation of the technology everywhere nationally and the advocate for suppressors. It does not work the other way around.
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch Deployment meaning your trained and conditioned for such scenarios. Your reference is not applicable to domestic situations except for where the devices are currently located. In 90 cities of how many that exist nationally?
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch Some place have laws requiring mufflers to be below certain audible levels.
@LouisvilleGun @DLoesch Never said they made them ultra quiet. They can however make the noise lower by significantly less then a jackhammer. 	It would be harder to determine the point of origin if someone committing a crime was using one.
@NYCMayor @NYCFirstLady Weird you quote this while if a person's name goes on a piece of paper it's a law they become stigmatized by being prohibited from participating in a long list of things.
@DLoesch The NRA just ran an ad advocating for easing restrictions on suppressors.

@rolandsmartin Then your presented with an article about how to increase your work ethic because somehow your lazy for taking a little extra time for your self while still maintaining higher numbers. Fuck outta here.

@DLoesch @RobertwRuncie @ScottJIsrael To be clear I'm in no way defending Scott Israel, he's a incompetent buffoon.
@DLoesch @RobertwRuncie @ScottJIsrael No you wouldn't. It's easy to portray yourself as a hero in hindsight. The company you represent has made very clear life is inferior to the ownership of an object.

@Noahpinion I don't know how to answer that other than sure but isn't convincing to me. I can only imagine how deadly the boss of a yakuza gang is. It doesn't seem to me like there would be a non violent way to  earn that title. I'm confident it's almost exactly the opposite.
@Noahpinion I hope you realize there's a good chance he has killed numerous people?

@LouDobbs To the maga people liking this you shouldn't, it's an approach addressing lou dobbs using his own words showing he doesn't want equal standards that's why it's okay for him to use insults.
@LouDobbs 'Do you think the Dimms,'
@LouDobbs #LDTPoll: Do you think the Dimms, the Deep State and the Left are trembling at the prospect President Trump is already writ large in American history books through his unprecedented successes in domestic and foreign policy?

@dannydanon do it after declaring terrorism therefore removing the notion that a country has any legitimate goverment at all?
@dannydanon And herein lies the problem. Every advesary a country has that rallied an alliance with the U.S. gets designated a terrorist. So there's no possible alternative other than direct war or war through proxy. So say both sides want peace and are willing to negotiate it how do you &gt;&gt;

@ChrisLu44 Secretary of energy. You want look for deregulation look closer.
@LouDobbs @gen_jackkeane @realDonaldTrump He has no leverage you dumb fucks. If you didn't notice kim's recent photoshoot with russians it's one of aggression and power. Trump played to eager and opened up the lines for advesaries to offer kim alliances. So dumb.
@ParkerMolloy Neither one a U.S. brand.
@ParkerMolloy The actual interesting thing about this is when he went to to the asia summit originally saying he was putting America first there were two cars that arrived. He was in one. A Mercedes and an Audi.
@tedcruz @realDonaldTrump So your the scumbag that surfaces the sewer trash.
@davidmweissman Yea it's less than the fecks i give. (No i didn't 😐)
@HeyTammyBruce @SalenaZito She apologized. Isn't that enough? (Don't really care whatever becomes of this.) Not like she insulted an autistic kid or anything. (That took literally 10 seconds to find.)
@EsotericCD Dimmu Borgir (heh heh heh)
@benshapiro What makes someone a political expert?
@MEPFuller  https://t.co/W6y4hQj8yd
@GOPChairwoman Meh. conservatives dominate talk radio and I've listened to them insult, debase, and demean they're politcal opponent's all the time. Tears stream down my face that the playing field isn't level. Your just upset it's not in your favor.
@LindseyGrahamSC @Disney @ABC @KeithOlbermann @espn @realDonaldTrump @FullFrontalSamB everyone*.
@LindseyGrahamSC @Disney @ABC @KeithOlbermann @espn @realDonaldTrump @FullFrontalSamB their claims. That seems to always be a one way street. I'm fine with interjecting if it's consistently applied to everyonem
@LindseyGrahamSC @Disney @ABC @KeithOlbermann @espn @realDonaldTrump @FullFrontalSamB One was the main character of whats supposed to be a family show on network television. The other hosts a show on cable specifically designed for politcal comedy and satire. I've never seen you say a word about conservative pundits make up lies with zero evidence to back up &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@ParkerMolloy @KyleKashuv @The_Tyler_Grant stream and publish dramatized versions of imfamous people across our time creating hybrids of fiction and truth for the sole purpose of generating revenue.
@ParkerMolloy @KyleKashuv @The_Tyler_Grant I'm going to dissent and completely disagree. I think networks should limit opinionated comments but should report the facts as they are. You can go after msm all you want, no one has said anything about netflix, hulu, amazon prime, etc. or well known book publishers who &gt;&gt;&gt;
@theseantcollins @RadioFreeTom I mean i was with ya until you went with pig-ignorance instead of the obvious pignorance.
@JohnJHarwood @TVietor08 You forgot mocking dead children and a man who burned to death.
@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/QK78FkjkR9
@glennbeck @iamsambee You have everything to gain. Your a leech that sustains itself whatever is trending.
@realDonaldTrump That would be a conspiracy. Your asking why didn't someone say let's be part of a conspiracy.
@patriotsrock307 @therealroseanne @AprilDRyan @JusticeJusticeT @KNP2BP @POTUS white*
@patriotsrock307 @therealroseanne @AprilDRyan @JusticeJusticeT @KNP2BP @POTUS To be clear i don't think he's a racist, i think his words and actions promote racism and bigotry.
@patriotsrock307 @therealroseanne @AprilDRyan @JusticeJusticeT @KNP2BP @POTUS Shithole. Muslim ban. Using ms-13 while referring to immigrants. Retweeting an account by the name whitegenocide. The remark after charlottesville. Never once saying he's not okay with being endorsed by well known whitr supremacists. That's 5 without the need for google. &gt;&gt;&gt;
@jackson_cristy @guardian This is true.
@jackson_cristy @guardian Not defending the comment just providing some context to the effects you posted.
@jackson_cristy @guardian If you fight the effects of ambien or benadryl you get high same for diazepam. It's pretty well known.
@therealroseanne @AprilDRyan @JusticeJusticeT @KNP2BP @POTUS Really? 	What you said was wrong, at least you have the self awareness to understand that and confront it.	The President makes statements and enforces policies that promote bigotry and racism all the time and he's either not self aware or does not care.
@Udi_Avivi Any deaths reported? Just odd to me reports from hours ago were over 70 rockets with 3 reported injuries and 0 deaths. Must be in the hundreds now. While I sincerely hope they're are none I don't see that being fathomable in the smallest statistical sense.
@JerryDunleavy His ownly real goal in this remark was to call a trump supporter free thinking and to call someone else a liberal making them somehow void of free thought.
@BlessedStarfish Which is they're David fighting goliath although it's quite the opposite.
@BlessedStarfish A lot of people mistake punditry for lack of intelligence. They are paid to gather an audience and push the narative they're told. The biggest mistake you can make is to think the person you oppose lacks intelligence. Not only is it not true it plays to the perception they push &gt;
@Mikel_Jollett I'm okay with both
@bobclendenin @TomiLahren Yes it is. She's seeing if she can give roseanne a pass while trying to feel out how other conservative pundits are going to play this so she can stay on the same page. She's not entirely sure.
@evansiegfried Like this isn't something that hasn't been going on for decades or centuries. You've all got it backwards. Were have to build moral basis going forward so we can be rid of this decedent filth.
@KenCalvert and*
@KenCalvert Something doesn't make sense here. All articles claim at least 70 rockets with a claim of 3 wounded an 0 loss of life. Simple math says it doesn't add up
@chrisconte Snowflakes are scared of a little rain.
@JudgeTedPoe no*
@JudgeTedPoe How about scraping the ship and using the money to I don't know actually go to actual people to help them with their lives. Wasn't there a hurricane there not too long ago? But fuck me let's throw money at an inanimate object that has not actionable value.
@JerryDunleavy He's not dumb. He's a racist sychophant that hides it by calling people who call out racism racists.
@AlexHortonTX @PoliticusSarah Unless it's something like your playing as the character. You can't interact with the express intent to commit violence.
@AlexHortonTX @PoliticusSarah You can do the same shit in gta. Also if you kill all the guards in hitman it becomes a mass murder simulator. Another thing you might want to note is you can't commit violent acts with weapons like guns and knives against minors in video games.
@WestWingReport Targeted harassment is not free speech.
@schwarz @RobertMackey We're all crazy.
@schwarz @RobertMackey You hold a small container of acid in your hand and next to your brain very frequently.&gt;
@schwarz @RobertMackey Your body responding with pain and bleeding but you continue to push a razor sharp razor blade that can kill you against your exposed vitals.&gt;
@schwarz @RobertMackey You shave and use a cell phone? 	I assume both of these things confidently.	You talk on that phone frequently? 	You've cut yourself shaving in at least a few instances?	I assume this confidently. 	As I confidently assume it of most people. &gt;
@Timcast Happy to explain that for ya little buddy.
@Timcast Welp as a guy my take especially after having taking public transport for so so many years of my life is....if you spread your legs wide enough to touch my leg I'm going very vocally ask you to not do that and move your leg. If you don't I won't be using audible speech any longer
@KevinMKruse Good comedy is good comedy and that shit was funny. Here racist words weren't funny. No mention of that event from you before this. Guess it wasn't worth a mention even while she had the #1 show on tv.
@JamilSmith That they could siphon an audience and therefore their time which means ad money because people are obsessed with their own idea of nostalgia because people are dumb.
@peterdaou While it's awesome he did that. I couldn't help laugh at the couple of people hanging on the gate at the bottom like "were almost there, just a few more...."
@kbyrne91 If you already didn't know he pays people to shove cameras in other people's faces.
@realDonaldTrump Didn't see the picture till after i read several articles mentioning 1500 missing children. Did you find them? If not then shut the fuck until you do.
@JayCaruso Who's we?
@JordanSchachtel From what i can tell he like that farrakhan is on trumps side so he's his enemy and that means his other enemy must be jews ??...?	To own the libs? 😐
@Ssnyder1835 If someway you can work in dc art it'll work because of the licensing required.
@aliintehran @thekarami Depends how you view it. Militarily billions is peanuts between the two. As far as an iran deal i find it crazy that U.S. is so heavily offended by someone with the title of supreme and not by some one with the title of king.
@thekarami Nope. You mistake trumps value when it comes to saudi arabia. He they tell him how it's gonna be he won't question them.
@BorisEP Because of the reason he wants to fire him.
@realDonaldTrump The fuck are you talking about. Your a 70 year old grown man.
@Mikel_Jollett @TAPSTRIMEDIA They want you to think like that and they want you to respond like that. They're paid peddlers.
@OfficialSPGB @chocol8thunda__ It it were more efficient and simpler you would have done it already.
@MDMGeek @elonmusk @theknifemedia Your integrity percentage is compiled while listing the headlines of articles that directly relate to you? 	Don't you have like a billion dollars?	What are you fucking 4 years old?
@B52Malmet Why do you think his pundit counter parts are always so angry when they lose followers? 	They and he are well aware of it. 	Would it suprise you if they weren't just bots but someone paid for them?
@nknewsorg @Joshua_Pollack It was on the side of a mountain like there's not multiple entrances. They also had so much notice that any material of value could've easily been moved within the time frame. So much time in fact they could've protected a deeper site from the blast.
@FoxNews @KarlRove You don't know shit karl rove. Your campaigning for him right now. As an independent I have no allegiance to bullshit or brown nosing suck ups.
@realDonaldTrump Your the fucking PRESIDENT! It's time for you to go bro like really. Too far is too far.
@RubenGallego At this point it's actually a fantastic idea. 1500 kids missing and a ridiculous amount of human rights violations. It's not at all suprising he doesn't want the military involved.
@AlanDersh @jjz1600 So you just make shit up now?
@yashar My guess is residuals from the  weinstein co.	If you didn't know they pretty much dominated the ownership and sales and rights of martial arts movies for as long as i can remember.
@RadioFreeTom @Uncle_Jimbo That they still have nuclear weapons and never really blew up any facility. It was just an old coal mine.
@TheLeadCNN @CNN @jaketapper Being as professional as possible while quoting other people cursing. https://t.co/HJBBLCbHcr
@KenTremendous They will actually skyrocket in price
@WhiteHouse So he cancels one agreement and tries to secure a different one and fails. Who knew world affairs were so tricky? 	I mean who could've possibly known?
@noonanjo And after our lives? If we don't address things such as this or decide to pay attention to help protect the freedoms of future generations then what fucking good are we?
@marcorubio @CommerceGov Because they're nice to him. If you stroke his ego he'll do whatever you want. Even be your bitch.
@TomiLahren I don't recall you saying any of this shit when seb gorka shoved a reporter.
@owillis Is this satire?
@rolmeda Do you really respect the rules?	I mean they just changed the catch rule because it was so horrendously stupid and almost impossible to interpret correctly. I know no one that respected that rule.
@ChrChristensen game*
@ChrChristensen I think everyone should kneel and not play at all at least for the first game. It'll be a real gane changer when owners have to reimburse all those ticket sales.
@davidmweissman @Marmel @RacismDog that's of*
@davidmweissman @Marmel @RacismDog It's literally an account someone made thats2of a dog that barks at racist posts. It's genius and yes he's a good boy. :)
@GovMikeHuckabee Way to address the seriousness of what the homeless have to endure. Not only having little to survive on but being mocked by someone who is w former governor. Way to go.
@NFL @carlquintanilla This policy is against the law.
@Green_Footballs @NPR @realDonaldTrump Twitter i assume is forced to remove any ability to do it by law.
@elonmusk @jaspar Why was the car that killed that woman and set to auto pilot going 38mph in a 35mph zone?
@PWM154 @davidhogg111 2/2 their his own. This specific topic he makes a good point.
@PWM154 @davidhogg111 1/2 He actually raises a good point. You have to have a selective service number so why it isn't combined with voter registration doesn't make sense. Selective service number is literally a calling card to go to war. As far as his motivations on the subject
@CNN He pulled him over for a turn signal and then said it was because of whatever it was he picked up that was in front of the driver. He can't be behind him and next to him at the same time.
@SethAbramson  https://t.co/jekjA4KlKw
@ByBerkowitz @usatodaysports Player salaries are?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump That now don't pay taxes and just get better loopholes to keep more of the money that they weren't paying taxes with because tax cuts? Sounds about right.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Who needs foreign terrorists when you can spread hate among your own people at raise them at home.	Let's shoot missiles at everything after we tore up a contract we crafted.	My rasie can't keep up with higher fuel prices.	Let's all work for the same companies who didn't pay taxes
@PhromTheBench @BreeNewsome @firefire100 Doesn't matter. A private companies policy cannot take precedence over the rights of an individual or any law that was created before the implementation of the policy. The NFL can be sued for it and will lose based on this. Cause you know it's America.
@ZubyMusic @benshapiro @akalamusic Your the villian no one should like you. 	I don't mean that but this is why those talks don't happen.	The subversive or very direct insults happen before discussion even takes place.
@AriMelber Dragon fruit
@PickUpTrucksFan @nowthisnews not only are you not getting it back I'm calling state troopers because shit just got really suspicious to me.
@PickUpTrucksFan @nowthisnews Can you prove he's racist? My initial take on this was the guard wanted to verify an id he was unfamiliar with. I can't say what happened because I wasn't there but if I'm a guard and I need to see your id and then need to verify it and then you ask for it back before I'm done
@nowthisnews I mean how can now this post this without full context. He's on private property recording someone who doesn't want to be recorded. 	I'm not saying nothing happened here but where's any type of investigation for full context?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS What's your obsession with obama?	Like if he created the sun would it be your goal to destroy the sun?	(I can honestly envision you lurking in the shadows saying "Because of obama I must destroy the sun.")
@kbsalsaud @JZarif Well it's like this. U.S. sells a bunch of tanks and whatever to Saudi Arabia. What Saudi Arabia does with them is what they do with them. U.S. doesn't say yea we gave Saudi Arabia missiles so it could obliterate civilians in yemen.
@SteveScalise @POTUS Do they get a protection against signing waivers or are they just lab rats and guinea pigs?
@kanyewest In rap music hammer has a different meaning. https://t.co/7PEwBJMt3k
@elonmusk Something that pops up and says "stop playing games and pay the fuck attention while your driving."
@guardiannews What did he say that isn't true?
@jaketapper About the audio cd. Can the publisher get it into major truck stops like ta-petro, pilot-flying j, loves? Not home enough to pick up mail and I'd like to own a copy.
@realDonaldTrump @AsaHutchinson Hutchinson supported Bush's proposals to provide more job opportunities for illegal aliens without criminal records. Maga? I mean I'm cool with it but maga?
@realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman Your ratio's are getting worse. :)
@realDonaldTrump That amount could definitely be offset by your personal accounts that profited of your position so don't worry about it champ.
@TeamPelosi How is anyone allowed to be anonymous when donating to anything political?
@dtn44 @KFoleyFL ledger version.
@dtn44 @KFoleyFL Don't know cameron played a high bred version of the nicholson version and ledger version when he first appeared. It was really impressive. Now he's playing the grimacing genius that had a trade mark round hat and the long coat. I think he's my favorite so far and i love the
@Uncle_Jimbo Well jim some people see other people as people regardless of if they have a permanent place to inhabit or not.
@seanspicer Your praising an American renouncing their citizenship and allegiance to join a monarchy. 	I don't care either way about it but pretty dumb for all the maga bums to be excited about it.
@CobraKaiSeries How come the creators didn't credit the youtuber who made the video explaining daniel is the bully. I listened to an interview with them explaining their inspiration for it. No mention not even a nod, the videos been around for a long time. I found it really disingenuous.
@conor64 You retweeted a member of the presses opinion of someone who used ms-13 in their statement. It wasn't the quote of an official. How is that different?
@AWolfeful I never premeditated any violent action. That's a different subject.
@AWolfeful In what capacity were you bullied?	I was bullied relentessly and for sometime as an adolescent i was prone to sporatic and spontaneous moments of physical violence because i didn't understand how to handle it. It took quite some time to not address things that way.
@SecretarySonny Why fuck with snap though?
@Uncle_Jimbo So the reaction to calling immigrants animals is not out of context.
@Uncle_Jimbo So none if their members is an American citizen?	After the report that a daca recipient was coerced by ice to say they were gang affiliated and it was proven they lied you insinuate in this statement that all illegal immigrants are gang members.

@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump See where imaginary fictious arguments get you?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump And you would have try to spin james bond as a good choice for the head of the cia if trump told you to even though his allegiance would be to the uk because the character is a covert spy for MI5 which is british and the cia is an agency of which country?
@RepRickAllen Fuck socialism or welfarism unless it applies to rural communities am i right?

@AviMayer “He’s not a member of the security cabinet so he isn’t privy to all the information given by security and intelligence officials,” Elkin said of Cohen in an interview with Army Radio. “I’m not sure where he got those figures from.”
@RodneyDavis Remove the reduction of snap benefits from the bill. The fuck does it have to do with farming? Farming exists to prevent starvation not cause it. I call bullshit.
@benshapiro Honest question: With your self stated commitment not to directly display the names of mass murderers, shooters, serial killers etc. in an attempt to dissuade compelling the idea of infamy in others how is consistently referring to a gang different?
@AviMayer Can you prove it or are you just willing to believe someone you call a liar for the sake of convenience?
@benshapiro If i thought myself a leader i would claim all if most who inhabitanted my domain to be members of whatever my faction may be. You don't even question the claim. Like him your just as eager to see more death.
@GovMikeHuckabee Back up there a moment. The deaths are linked. The protests materialized because of the embassy move. Another issue is the recent displacement of many of Palestines people by the idf claiming land in the west bank that Israel for some reason thinks is their own.
@Qualcomm_Tech @Qualcomm Make a qualcomm that can trip plan for me. C'mon you know you want to.
@ericarhodes Talk to myself all the time. Sometimes it's audible even in public. The question that i always pose is do i care enough about a small reaction from someone i don't know to stop? The answer is i do not.

@TimKennedyMMA I don't think you understand. Your experiment is conducted around parameters and variables that you yourself have established. Your participated in it of your on free will which completely eliminates the idea it could qualify as torture regardless of of whatever test you perform.

@kbsalsaud These sound like words that will lead to a violent campaign of indifference launched against all iranian people and not towards a particular people or sect.
@RepRobinKelly @realDonaldTrump It degrades any notion of having an alliance. With no contract he gets to consider them a rogue state and declare them an enemy. Wait for more bombs.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Yea after whoever he makes the promise to has to sue him for what he promised.
@lvisrulz Sorry response is so late, i works a lots.
@lvisrulz His argument is well the guy can't keep track of his own money. Let him keep track of everyone else's money.
@lvisrulz Yea with accountants. You can't preach financial responsibility and then give someone else an excuse for not displaying it (i don't believe that's the case in the least, that'd be really naive).
@lvisrulz 2/2. How could someone know what a bunch of lawyers are doing with it. He preaches fiscal conservatism while making excuses for a person saying they can't keep track of their own finances.
@lvisrulz 1/2. Rush Limbaugh is full of shit.	Here's why. 	I was recently driving in oklahoma. 	Browsing stations. His show popped up. 	I was like alright I'll listen, why not? When in rome. 	He then said 130,000 dollars is hard to keep track of when you have a bunch of money.
@shutupmikeginn @AdamWeinstein Used to love best buy until i got accused of stealing an 8 dollar pair of headphones after i just spent over 100 bux there. I had the receipt too. It was quite the exchange between me and security. Fuck best buy.
@CalebJHull It typically is when someone who thinks like this is involved in such a scenario.
@WalshFreedom Called it. I haves the tweet to back that up to. Just saying 2+2 is 4 man.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews they*
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews Notice i didn't include them as patrons but the picked out the very location based on this very assumption that they could wait for another person in what they thought would be a comfortable atmosphere undeterred or uninterrupted.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews It's universally accepted by the very patrons of starbucks it's a place that caters to the very idea of loitering. It's known to be a place that provides wifi so you can hangout there for hours on end. So common sense would dictate that would also be they're assumption.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews I do it all the time. I've sat in numerous places with a coffee from somewhere innumerable times. I've even chilled in starbucks with a coffee from dunkin donuts.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews This is why employers give you a paper specifically saying they do not engage in discriminatory pratices. Many companies have meetings with employee where this is the very subject of the meeting.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews Your buisness your policy. While it may be starbucks policy it's never been noticeably enforced. Enforcing such a policy has to met with non discriminatory equalization.
@Uncle_Jimbo Why address what's irrelevant?
@CornellWBrooks @kanyewest @CNN @AP He's*
@CornellWBrooks @kanyewest @CNN @AP I mean he right. Slavery was a choice. For white people.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews Capitalizing the word period doesn't add any substance to your argument.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews Only if those rules do not interfere with the law. It was a discriminatory practice. I know this based on my own experience as well as many others who have never been exposed to any policy from starbuck saying you can't be there if you don't buy anything.
@CraigSilverman Saying in my humble opinion has always been considered an attack on the reasoning of another's argument. It's a dishonest way to try and gain a favorable perception. Saying it's your honest opinion attributes only to you
@CraigSilverman You can't be humble without being honest. It always makes me angry how journalists assume shit without research. Like literally go and browse one of the couple of hundreds of thousands of video game forums from the last decade. The consensus has always been in my honest opinion.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews Private policy does not and cannot supercede the law. The lack of occurences in which an event took place does show that they did in fact violate established laws. Even the ceo of the company showed up and said it's not right, this isn't who we are.
@chuckwoolery No one twisted his words. He chose his own while seemingly forgetting that history can not be changed and very much impacts the future. Forgetting history also impacts the future.
@chuckwoolery The concept of ignoring that slavery and rasicm occurred and in this country and still does is not a new idea. Statistical analysis based on presentable and verifiable facts disputes the very notion of self victimization.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews This whole situation really doesn't represent what i know to be most of philly. We largely stayed out of every racial issue because most people here don't care what color you are.
@cdelpilar5 @NBCNews I'm from philly. I can walk into any starbucks and sit there as long as i want. I use to hangout in there while i waited for the bus. Nobody ever said a word to me. Their entire model is hangout here and eventually you might probably buy something.
@BrianKempGA You don't need to apologize for defending what you believe in. You need to take some gun safety courses. You aimed a gun at another person while insinuating it because you didn't like what they we're thinking. What's more liberal than that?
@Luminescent663 @larryelder @realDonaldTrump I don't know if that's you insulting or commending my thoughts on this. I don't hold a high opinion of most people especially if i don't personally know them.
@Luminescent663 @larryelder @realDonaldTrump Particularly how i can perceive your questions without considering they imply specific assumptions and that your not trying to guide this conversation in an artiificial manner to acheive a pre planned result?
@Luminescent663 @larryelder @realDonaldTrump with this?*
@Luminescent663 @larryelder @realDonaldTrump You mentioned one a specific person saying they were reputable. I responded about the one specific person you mentioned. Lawyers are not reputable to me. Your follow up questions are all over the place. What do your follow up questions have to do with?
@haroldpollack the*
@haroldpollack We can do all of these things already. Imagine a world where your choice of food limited to one item that provided all necessary nutrition. We could do this. We won't because it removes a small enjoyment from our basic existence.
@haroldpollack Your concept of thw world only encompasses earth. Colonozing other planets is actually rational to me when it comes to the evolution of our species.
@haroldpollack Why is it a mistake?
@Luminescent663 @larryelder @realDonaldTrump Reputable would be an opinion. I know little of him. I did a small amount of research after this reply. My first take is he advocated torture. defended a murderer and a child molester. And is fine with the idea of terrorism as long as it's in favor of Israel's world view.
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump So one guy got caught lying and another guy is afraid he'll get caught lying? That's your argument here?
@SpeakerRyan So according to where you live you get more or less help from the goverment? So if i'm in one area and struggling i get help? If I'm in a different area and am still struggling i get less help?

@brianschatz It's true. If some named Republican McRepublican face had done it would be the greatest thing since evangelicals selling out they're entire religion.
@realDonaldTrump Only if the meeting included at least half a dozen countries aside from nk sk and us.
@AoDespair Eggs man, fried eggs.
@scottsantens People who direct policy when it comes to hunger don't understand what real hunger is. They're idea of it is I'm starving, i gotta get home to have something to eat. They don't know about going home hoping you have a few packs of ramen noodles left.
@therealroseanne Remember when everyone was offended the way you portrayed being a pitcher on the mound when you went to that baseball game. It was considered insulting and disgraceful. I thought it was hilarious. Now your in league with the same idiots who don't know what funny is.
@RVAwonk Bullies will throw you to the wolves. They're biggest objective is self preservation.
@RVAwonk Because she has stigmatism or something similar. It's very apparent. First thing i thought of when i heard the joke. That being said oh well? You don't get to officially represent a person who treats other people the way he does and get your own safe space.
@GareBear110 @NHLFlyers If i were a player that be some info i'd want. Like we need more shots guys. It's gotta pretty aggravating not knowing your own tally while having to focus on everything else.
@GareBear110 @NHLFlyers of screening they're own goalie when trying to protect a shot from the slot. Like direct line of sight. Also I've been to a few games and the worst thing is the shot totals on the overhead disappear like halfway into the second.
@GareBear110 @NHLFlyers Couple of things i notice when watching the flyers. Like any team when they're good they're really good. When they're off they just play the trap from the left on offense. It's super repetitive and predictable. On defense for some reason the dmen have a really bad habit
@KimKimwiden @erinscafe It's the people who got lost in the first place that made the path.
@GareBear110 @NHLFlyers What remedy do you have for that? You can replace anyone in the org you can't change refs. So either way they got screwed.
@GareBear110 @NHLFlyers Although the pens had a small edge in the last game none of those guys control officiating. The two blantant penalties commited against the flyers in the 3rd weren't called. There was still time and all time is valuable.
@realDonaldTrump It's a bid for a sports game. Are you that fucking petty?
@davidmweissman @SenSanders @anupartanen Taxes I assume. Consider when recession hit the U.S. goverment gave billions to banks that lost the money. I think his ideas are pretty extreme but that's what ya gotta do. Make your ideas seem really far out and then propose something more plausible.
@seanhannity -By Hannity Staff- 	Gtfo by hannity staff
@dannydanon @ofirgendelman Yea and zionists aren't extreme in the least.
@WalshFreedom @BernieSanders manual labor to survive in this game of societal life.
@WalshFreedom @BernieSanders Its not working that destroying america. It's the insane lack of any type of rent control. Also the fuck is the last time you really did like real work. Not like oh i talked a bunch of bullshit. Also not i did something physical cause i felt it like. Like you did back breaking...
@MaximeBernier @canadamptweets Just saw this and hmmm...hmmm it would seem as though, People as in human beings are not products.
@BwireMsanii @ShaunKing The chinese have an entire country surmised primarily of that demographic. That's where the moniker comes from.
@realDonaldTrump @JasonMillerinDC So you want the goverment to be transparent or you want information to be classified? You don't get to have it both ways.
@larryelder Wow even for you just wow.
@realDonaldTrump You pleaded with wikileaks to distribute hacked emails. Remember that shit?
@realDonaldTrump You*
@realDonaldTrump If someone was third rate, you wouldn't even know their name let alone acknowledge them. An honest person would dismiss what your insinuate lightly and in a joking manner.
@IronStache Poors a state of mind. I'm broke.
@WalshFreedom very much*
@WalshFreedom He's taking the advice of an American joe. I would like you to further expand on why you picked that song with that name. I would very know your opinion on the cultural relevance of the song. Please?
@RodneyDavis Also it's pretty fucked up your calling it a farm bill since farms produce food while trying to stop people from accessing food which feeds people.
@RodneyDavis There are so many people who hold full time employment that live in poverty. You don't fall into it. You exist in in it. Try it sometimes. It blows.
@TheDweck Maybe i can completely butcher his music and monetize it on youtube. Just seems like he's giving me the green light here.
@FoxNews 'The outrageous claim...'	Opinion not fact
@FoxNews and used by the Obama Department of Justice to obtain a warrant to spy on Trump's campaign. Subjective not factual
@FoxNews Is this supposed to be factual new or opinion piece? Cause i thought you had to make clear if it was or not if you produced both types of content.
@BySteveReilly Although i sense heavy sarcasm this is actually a really good question.
@CathyMyersWI If you were unaware a lot of major cities took down a lot of bus shelters that were used for rain and cold weather because the homeless were using them as a refuge from the elements. We live in a pretty fucked up place.
@KFILE Muffin and soyboy..nice. Negative points for crybaby
@RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump Actually they do. It's an investigation into his presidential campaign and anyone who worked for or on it. How do you walk around with a hand so far up your ass?
@seanhannity He appeared on your radio program 1/11/2017 in which you discuss. Hmmm how do i say.....third parties.
@TheRickWilson Unless they get caught then they just swap them out with the understudy.
@BrianSchoeneman resource*
@BrianSchoeneman At lower levels of court i wouldn't. What makes this so fun for me is these two guys (trump and hannity) probably have had an army of legal resorce teams for years and years but in the politcal spectrum that is d.c. they're easily outnumbered.
@BrianSchoeneman I hope so. I really can't see an experienced legal professional making such a claim without being able to exhibit supporting evidence.
@seanhannity Then you won't share your opinion on cohen and why he's in court to begin with on your program at all? 	Because that would suggest personal interest.
@BrianSchoeneman If you testified to a judge in court you were my attorney in an open investigation at any various point in time and i publicly stated you were not what would would happen next?
@BrianSchoeneman I was always taught that ignorance is not an excuse. So ethics immediately comes into question.
@BrianSchoeneman It's fucking glorious.
@BrianSchoeneman So either Cohen's lying to a judge in court or hannity is lying saying cohen is lying to a judge in court which makes hannity part of the case.
@BrianSchoeneman Exactly
@BrianSchoeneman And if i gave you 10 bucks and you accepted it as payment for your counsel?
@danabrams He said he wasn't his attorney so he never represented him so....
@seanhannity You said you might have paid him. Even if it's ten bucks I'd really like to see a receipt. The law doesn't give a fuck about your assumptions. First time you've ever made me smile
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Increase your following distance. A speed limit is the speed in which your legally limited to.
@nomadinabag @TAscendedSaiyan @BBCWorld I would like to see it. Hayao Miyazaki makes awesome movies. This ones far older but from his studio.
@RealSaavedra @TGowdySC @Comey Well yea it was the catalyst for him writing the book. That doesn't make the words in the book any less relevant.
@GOPChairwoman I would take him over all off you. Your all bullshitters on both sides. We want transparency but only on the other side but if they try to be transparent about anything they're leaking information. So what are they hiding? It's absurd and your all full of shit.
@TakouiS @seanhannity @ABC @GStephanopoulos He's not a journalist. He hosts an entertainment program.
@neeratanden It was a smart statement to make. Had he made any insinuation that was foreseeable without providing verifiable evidence from what's still an on going investigation his credibilty and the on going case would be torched.
@seanhannity @ABC @GStephanopoulos You could've interviewed him but you don't qualify as a journalist. It's far easier to state your opinions from the sidelines.
@DineshDSouza And this is why your a scumbag. A person dies and your idea is to mock the way in which they died.
@larryelder If you reference works of fiction you should consider doing one where the protagonists don't succeed. Also note the characters displayed are the hero's of the story.
@ireland ???
@nikkihaley @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/0ZEwM51Mwp
@Jake_Hanrahan Seems like a legit case of git gud maybe? 	Seriously though don't cut your corners to fast play the angles and take the path of least resistance. Why have to take on two when you can take on one at a time?
@Evan_McMullin Oh awesome. Let's shoot missiles and then talk about a comprehensive strategy.
@WalshFreedom Wrong you voted to give some unhinged asshole a ridiculous amount of power believing he gave a fuck about why you would vote for him.
@SRuhle @washingtonpost @costareports @MSNBC He's stirring the pot. I think he just wants to mess with him. Since they seperated breitbart takes jabs at trump all the time. Just read their headlines.
@BecketAdams Avatar. I went to the movie theater to see it. I left without part of my soul. So excruciatingly boring.
@JordanSchachtel Well the first time he called it a false flag and at the same time he said a syrian missile accidentally hit a chemical factory. So he was lying or he was lying cause it couldn't be both at the same time.
@LindseyGrahamSC You say it's a virtual monopoly and yet you post your statement on the social media platform called twitter https://t.co/W8uKFUjx6C
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS to keep making these asinine statements.
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS Not struggling to find qualifying workers. Not willing to pay qualified workers an adequate wage. The American idea? The fuck is that? Also forcing americans into labor does not qualify them, forcing them into debt to accumulate experience is why you get..
@IDK It's incredible no curriculum exists in k-12 on the subject when it impacts such a big part of an individuals life.
@peterdaou E) he loses about 1/3rd of the republican base. His hardline fanatics (fox pundits) divide themselves with the actual money that funds republican candidates.
@TuckerCarlson do*
@TuckerCarlson Thousands due die. Genocide is happening. Your statement implies that death is only relevant if victims are judeo christians. This fucking guy.....
@kumailn You say not cartoons but damn if i won't still binge the animated series of the justice league and the adventures of batman over just about anything.
@RadioFreeTom Really? Pretty much expected.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump It's not privileged if it's criminal. Nda's and contracts do not and cannot supercede the law. 	Aaaaaahahahahahah	Ha	Ha	Ha.......ha
@FoxNews @RepMcCaul @MariaBartiromo Did you use photoshop to crop his head to a disproportionate size? Tf?
@radleybalko A scapegoat? It was quite litterally a sex trafficking site.
@willsommer @brianstelter It's so dumb. It's just links to basic htmls with random pics connecting to other basic htmls trying to connect a bunch of nonsense.
@WilsonWPA @hughhewitt Question: Did he pay out of pocket to attend the rose bowl and disneyland? Did you?
@matthewstoller even*
@matthewstoller He didn't even work for the company. We have no mutual friends on the site and he's never posted about his job or who he works for.
@matthewstoller One of the craziest things I've ever encountered through facebook. I worked at a job. Never posted anything about it. Not wven that i worked there. When the people you may know feature popped up it suggested someone who worked at the company unloading trucks.
@DineshDSouza Actually it was invaded by immigrants.
@DonaldJTrumpJr The upbeat way in which you make light of mass murder is disturbing.
@cliffschecter It's not about winning the argument. It's about attracting an audience to the argument.
@_b20__ @NBA @cavs On another note the Sixers are afraid to drive. They gotta start going right down the lanes.
@_b20__ @NBA @cavs Fucking terrible bro. Everyone at the bar counted to 3 on the replay. He was planted solid.
@_b20__ @NBA @cavs Watching this game. Holy shit is the ref calling bad. A cav kicked the ball. kicked it and it was still their ball. TF?
@realDonaldTrump No your not. If i pay you x you receive x. You agreed to receive x. No one forced you into that agreement. At no point did they receive negative x. You've always had issues with paying x to so many people you agreed to pay x to.
@DanielJHannan Nice picture but an uncut 60 pound block of frozen bonless beef would be a more accurate depiction. Your romantizing the idea of American companies being undercut by foreign competitors to supply fast food chains.
@BillOReilly @IngrahamAngle shit*
@BillOReilly @IngrahamAngle Nah son. Hannity started that shot when he smashed a keurig and endorsed a boycott. You bums wanted to play that game but your only good at the game of shit talking and ya push each other to go as far as you can. Your not deplorable your disposal.
@fairfuturephl That's great except that's not it's primary purpose. It's supposed to be a secondary objective. The primary is supposed to fund pre k and public school just like the tobacco tax so no. It is not working. Please show your work (the financial version).
@RachelOsiris @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama He's doing what obama admin did attempting to give a definitive timeline for an exit. That approach is a signal to any potential enemy that all they have to do is wait and then they can regroup and become fully operational again.
@seanhannity Guess the hits on fox advertisers have you resorting to self promoting
@KrangTNelson The stale bread is a sarcone roll. We use them for hoagies not cheesesteaks. A cheesesteak is about 1/4th brisket, 3/4th flank steak. American cheese is the official cheese on a cheesesteak not cheese whiz.
@MichaelRapaport Although usually not the absolute highest chance of success. Typically just good enough. It's how you can tell/debate/argue what's over powered, under powered. Tactics, etc. Any game forum you'll see the word billions of times.
@MichaelRapaport Meta isn't a hipster term. It's a gamer term, been a round a minute. It's smaller games you play within a larger game that's usually used by the largest majority because it has a higher % chance of success.
@SulomeAnderson If It's me who they approach imma say your talkin' to em'
@glennbeck @DLoesch for whatever comment i have
@glennbeck @DLoesch She represents an organization that uses a costumed character to teach children gun safety in a fun way. Do you understand how fucking redundant and idiotic that is? As an individual no real opinion. As an individual who chooses to represent mediocrity, the gates are open

@BenHowe The NeverEnding Story
@CovfefeUpInThis @PhotoJouMATT @RealSaavedra fully understand the foremost reason is to take another person's life. All other reasons are secondary.
@CovfefeUpInThis @PhotoJouMATT @RealSaavedra Most people have very little knowledge of what all the parts in a car are or even how they work. It's unlikely. They are getting what they want. Media attention. Also whatever reason anyone wants to put behind the killing is only valid if they
@CovfefeUpInThis @PhotoJouMATT @RealSaavedra Knowledge of the apparatus your handling. Even if I was aware of how to do it which I'm not there's certain knowledge which is really preferable not to share with other people.
@PhotoJouMATT @RealSaavedra Sure it's a lot of work but that's why we have these systems. To avoid it would show familiarity of each area. Also the timing of each i would consider really close so to me that would also indicate the same. Being familiar with each area.
@PhotoJouMATT @RealSaavedra Yea i was thinking this but i would think that the first law enforcement move would be to track all incoming and outcoming traffic to see if there's any vehicle that travels to and from at each event.
@PhotoJouMATT @RealSaavedra a comfort zone.
@PhotoJouMATT @RealSaavedra Another thing is the crimes would be categorized as disorganized because of the areas chosen. The possibility of uncontrollable conditions such as random witnesses is present. This would usually indicate someone who lives in or around such an area. That's why it's considered
@PhotoJouMATT @RealSaavedra All things progress. I wouldn't eliminate any possibility but different devices which caused different impacts of sustained damage. It's either progression or experimentation which is another form of progression.
@RealSaavedra From what I've seen reported military background doesn't seem high on the list. The progression of sophisticatation when it comes to the devices would imply self teaching.
@RealSaavedra Outside austin would be ambitious. Typically would be a person who would consider it a comfort zone of which they feel they could move through it freely. Also would guarantee the person travels using personal vehicle.
@ColsBols of what you want to be true interfere with deductible facts.
@ColsBols Or past occurrences in cases similar that suggest a person's willingness to contact and taunt the media for attention. You make an assumption to great. Nearly all serial killers targets members of their own race. While this may not be true in this case your letting your own bias
@jaketapper It's 10 million and .01 cents.
@PatGarofalo Your lack of reaction to the loss of life is sad.
@AlexJamesFitz He an unknown upstart? The picture captioned is him practicing for a professional (cash) tournament in 2011.
@NRA “The numbers among young voters, African Americans, Hispanics and even Democrats prove the gun debate could be a tricky strategy for Democrats looking to take back power in both houses of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections.”	Imma hold on to this..
@Spacekatgal -not* should be*
@Spacekatgal Where is fbi? The crimes will only escalate from here They're should be enough info to find a common denominator (aside from race). Should not be treated as a serial killler. What list contains all of they're addresses and who has access to the list?
@RepLeeZeldin Your his bitch. I usually refrain from saying shit lile this but yea your his bitch.
@BuckSexton Part of not ran.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump And i agree when it comes to already refined and remanufactured metals but unrefined should remain untouched.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump At least read the words before you cherrypick whatever headline you pick
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Your arguing against your position of acquiring metals and then saying it should be more expensive to acquire metals
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump But in wartime, aluminum and steel are essential to make tanks, planes and other weapons. The aluminum and steel industries are in dire straits, with many plants idle or operating far below capacity while cheaper metal flows in from other countries.
@ReformedBroker Even elon knows this. I am curious how these trucks can navigate different terrain and landscapes such as blizzards high winds and steep grades
@ReformedBroker It's true. Although with the laws that are currently in effect it's impossible to have a full self operated truck. A truck doesn't have it's on authority to pre and post trip itself. Also in any event of being pulled over by dot officer a truck can't assume accountability.
@PeterAlexander What are they gonna say when there's a pic of obama putting a medal on him?
@KenRoth If he freed them at your behest and they actively worked to regress the new freedoms being given to these people in a violent fashion would you stand by your opinion as it now stands?
@BorisEP @JesseFFerguson @realDonaldTrump You can. He showed up to promote a candidate. You do that to activate your supporters to vote for who your promoting That's how it works.
@davidmackau Yesss. I've been waitin for this. Yesss.
@CathyMyersWI Everyone is suscepticle to attack ads. That's why their so popular.
@john_sipher @SenJohnMcCain @StephanieCarvin She absolutely can be held accountable. We not only have the right to speak against things we disagree with we have the right to walk away from participating in events we don't want to be part of. Complacency is not an valid excuse.
@SethAbramson I already actually suspected this. I think sessions recusal bought trump more time. Imagine if true how much faster the cards would fold.
@realDonaldTrump You said mexico was going to pay for it. So your a man of your word or a liar.

@AdamWeinstein  https://t.co/GHvXKK7k2L
@TVietor08 Awww yea
@WalshFreedom You worked in illinois no?
@realDonaldTrump Great for your deep state claims. As our countries most clandestine agency obviously the cia wouldn't be part of that.
@JayCaruso honesty*
@JayCaruso Also what happens to money unused by say super pacs if the candidate doesn't win? I don't really know. I know it's unrelated specifically but it's still in the wheel house of political money so I wascjust wondering how that worked.
@JayCaruso I don't understand how any non profit can provide this type of funding to a political entity. It's partisan which should negate they're ability to be a non profit. This goes for all non profits. It's not a singular attack on any one of them.
@JayCaruso Okay. I honest didn't know that. I'm not completely versed on how large amounts of money politically works. I wasn't aware he only received 9000 from them. It is misleading.	I still maintain spending millions of dollars on something is an investment that comes with an expectation
@RepLeeZeldin @HouseIntelComm @realDonaldTrump If*
@RepLeeZeldin @HouseIntelComm @realDonaldTrump Because he has been verified of previously providing valuable intel on the subject of russia to the U.K. and U.S. because of he's previous assignments.
@RepLeeZeldin @HouseIntelComm @realDonaldTrump Of the info, not one person has denied the guy who obtained it isn't a credible source or he wasn't a spy. Imagine that. He was an actual spy. Like you don't even dismiss this. That's crazy. You can't even say he wasn't a spy. You know how wild that is that you can't dismiss him
@RepLeeZeldin @HouseIntelComm @realDonaldTrump I completely disagree. Multiple people have been charged with crimes because of this investigation. People on his campaign which is the investigation. Ig anyone on the trump campaign was involved. The craziest thing is while you constantly argue about who funded the discovery
@girl_chef1 So the argument from my perspective comes from two very different worlds and we are going to grow in population to where these 2 very different communities directly intercept.
@girl_chef1 I see this as a 2 sided coin. Sometimes it does go too far on the left with trying to tell people what to do but it's also true on the right. They can defend that it's unacceptable but we all share the same spaces. This is especially true in densely populated areas.
@girl_chef1 I actually agree with these ideas. Sorry, i sincerely thought your comments about lecturing was directed at me.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski This is a hobby of mine. If a random unknown person can construct words of influence to alter the future it's an insanely great power to wield. So I'll continue. I also like playing baseball.
@girl_chef1 @StephenGutowski Whats your opinion on gun control? Your dismissing me by saying I'm not willing to engage in a discussion. This is not the case. I might debate with you and have a difference of opinion but it would only become a lecture if one of us chose not to engage.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski I don't believe that's why he was elected. I think that people are drawn to controversy and he provided that.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski It's a little more than this one incident. Charlottesville where he defended the actions of white supremacists. Calling african countries shitholes, retweeting a user by the name of whitegenicide.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski "They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people." He says this about mexico which would be mexicans. To me that's a racist statement. You can argue that he said some people. That doesn't hold water to me.
@girl_chef1 @StephenGutowski What facts on what subject would you like to present? I'm not a liberal but I'm up for varying discussion on any number of subjects.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski No have whatever opinion you want about whoever you want and support whoever you want. That statement comes from my personal belief and opinion he commited numerous crimes.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski I had to look up ad hominem. I don't think that's a valid argument on your part because the responses created here by all of us is by a singular entity critizing another singular entity.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski I'm not tolerant of him insulting others. I wouldn't seek supress it in any way. I fully encourage that if he actually makes it to another election run when he goes to a debate his opponent exercises the same right and curses him out.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski I understand it completely. I also know a guy who said mexicans are drug dealers and rapists, shithole countries, and all types off ignorant shit. They still get to voice their opinions.
@RyanKEYC @StephenGutowski I've heard his music. He still gets a voice in this country.
@girl_chef1 @StephenGutowski A ton of it is. I don't dispute that. It's only a lecture if you choose not to engage in the discussion.
@commoncents1234 @StephenGutowski I have no problem maintaining the voice of dissent. He's allowed to voice his opinion just like anyone else.
@paulkrugman What's your proposal? 	It's not a secret that our country lost a lot of jobs and it's far cheaper to outsource and import goods. 	Just saying you can argue against the tariff plan but what plan do you have to address this?
@MattWalshBlog @AdamBaldwin Because you said I'm sure we both have our studies we can refer to. Don't say things like this unless you want people to present and cite actual studies.
@MattWalshBlog @AdamBaldwin Had you wrote this article first i believe you wouldn't have received such a negative reception. 	You had to expand the meaning of what you meant for an article that was not indepth and overall a blanket defense of the 2nd amendment.	Also the cite your studies argument is valid.
@StephenGutowski They want to insult and berate. I see it and I'll absolutely admit I'm not above it. I'll for go any thought of honor to win a war.
@StephenGutowski So is trump in my opinion. To attempt and dismiss them because you don't agree is ridiculous. I know you didn't say it bbit that's what it's come to. People attempting to say others aren't relevant because they don't want discussion at all.
@StephenGutowski I agree he profited off it. I just don't like that people are upset he's participating in whatever conversation he wants to participate in. I enjoy some of his music too. No one one is an expert of what opinions a person can have.
@JayCaruso How it disingenuous? 	Yoi can speak about technicalities but if i paid for an ad that promoted whatever endeavor you were undertaking i would be contributing to your campaign.
@StephenGutowski I mentioned this before. The only way your argument becomes a valid counter is if his words can be perceived and rooted in reality. The columbine existed in realty otherwise it's makes no sense in the context he used it.
@seanmdav @Uncle_Jimbo It's nice to see unfiltered comments from someone else. You wanted to promote a lower playing field. Can not wait until trump gets cursed out on national t.v. it will be fun.
@JoyAnnReid Only if U.K. gets the Mohammad bin Salman to condemn it publicy. It's a bigger stage with more actors than you think.
@Bencjacobs Bill Dix quits for handsy mitts and spitty licks.	Local man awarded for witty quips.
@Bencjacobs 😐
@NRA All people are innocent until they're not.
@Ryan_Secord @FoxNews I'm not saying I'm agreeing or not cause i haven't listened to interview. He is however participating in a discussion on the subject.
@Ryan_Secord @FoxNews I agree he glorified violence to profit. The words you are using to highlight them only make sense if they exist in reality. Then he talks about his opinion about a politician on the subject and he's "doing nothing". So he either does nothing or does nothing?
@Ryan_Secord @FoxNews Your attempt at finding offense in this can only exist if the words are rooted in reality.
@2muchsarcastic @kaitlancollins Depends really. He deepened a divide that already existed. If a person can use something else as an excuse to behave a certain way they're gonna use it.
@2muchsarcastic @kaitlancollins -word +work*
@2muchsarcastic @kaitlancollins That kind of word is all about infiltrating the enemy. It doesn't have to be physically violent and can be done on every level.
@2muchsarcastic @kaitlancollins It works. If you read the headlines and articles since no one has put him saying these things and his goals of division together. A lot of people want to see things at face value and not see past the bullshit. He was a kgb agent.
@kaitlancollins Thinking about this it lends credibility that he's not so removed from the entire operation.	Instead of trying to address the issue he using his words to create splinter groups. He's playing the game he's denying playing right in front of everyone.
@mgerrydoyle So it's kinda news worthy if it were here in U.S.
@mgerrydoyle Long enough to pursue an attempt at a higher income. It's stay on it or get laid too much(which isn't a lot) and get removed from the program right away.	It's probably not like you think. You can't just get back on thr program if you fail.
@mgerrydoyle Don't know how it works in china.	I have a friend with one leg though.	 He's on disability, if he makes to much working he wont receive it any more and it's not even a third of what he receives of what he receives.	He couldn't adequately survive without it
@larryelder @MaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Never once even entered my mind. 	Didn't enter yours till he said it.	Your his choir boy.	That's what I think. In public and private.
@goldengateblond Maybe voicemails and texts?
@harveyjkaye Treat everything he says as irrelevant. He speaks, you speak louder.	You treat him the way he acts, like a piece of shit bully that nobody likes.
@harveyjkaye And this is why you lose. The idea isn't to have a catchy come back and reply. 	You've already lost wasting time thinking about it.	The idea is to be dimmisve and insulting.
@JayCaruso more difficult*
@JayCaruso We made accessibility to airplanes move ddifficult because it was and is understood that they can be used nefariously to kill many people instantly?
@JayCaruso Also just weird how you added anything on healthcare.	Your made because families can help each other with health insurance?	Just weird.
@JayCaruso If that's the argument you want to make a stipulation stating that if your under 21 but enlisted or have been honorably or medically discharged you can make the purchase could be proposed it would easily pass.
@kellylesick @SethMacFarlane The idea of traveling to another planet to live isn't that crazy if you think in these terms.
@kellylesick @SethMacFarlane Were parasitic creatures. All those movies you see where aliens invade to accumulate resources- that's us. If you think about it were the only species we know of that terraformed an entire planet to suit us.
@kellylesick @SethMacFarlane A guy made a car out of legos that runs on air.	I get you can argue the plastic part but it runs of air.
@kellylesick @SethMacFarlane That's a weird argument for plastic. 	We could easily make the price of it a bit higher so people would be more inclined to reuse it then to discard it.	Nobody is saying we don't use it. It's just really dumb we have so much dependence on it.
@JasonMillerinDC @RichardGrenell You remember Merrick Garland?	Member that guy?
@RT_com What a puff piece.	Also it's funny you have a video embedded in the same article titled "Artic Drills".	That's funny, it's no secret mining the artic is a goal that has nothing to do with safety.
@LouisFarrakhan You spread the idea that an entire segment of people who I would feel confident saying most of who have no idea who the fuck you are, are deviously planning your demise.	Had no idea who you were till like a week ago bro. 	Your a bum. That's my take on it.
@realDonaldTrump 50% in any school is a failing grade.
@FoxNews @Jim_Jordan That's Right! cause trump isn't from there. he's a small town country boy with a humble heart who got screwed over when he realized he wanted to take a chance and make it big in alternate stupid world.
@ClintSmithIII Canada's gov I mean.
@ClintSmithIII Vermont produces a lot of maple syrup. Like a lot.	Also maple syrup is regulated by the gov.	Their hardcore about syrup.
@evansiegfried Ukrainians, Tatars, Jews	Not just jews, that's a distorted claim that excludes all of what he said.
@WalshFreedom Your were a congressmen who didn't/doesn't understand the law? 	Or how to change it?	Or who gets to change it?
@DonaldJTrumpJr kim*
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your dads gonna meet kim jung because kin jung wants to meet not the other way around. You speak to soon.
@ParkerMolloy My issue is what snowflakes they are. Get super offended by anything they might not like. I'll make fun of anyone on anyside but those guys. One trump joke it's how dare you insult mah king pesant !
@ParkerMolloy You see it as lazy and boring. It's coherent strategy of repitition. It's how humans learn and adapt. Don't believe me? (see fox media).	The same things are peddled over and over on a timed cycle.
@FoxNews Obviously if it provokes the same outrage you would have contributed to it as a writer who believes they should be equally denounced.
@FoxNews Article written by Jeremy hunt.	In article: 'But Farrakhan’s racist and anti-Semitic comments don’t provoke as much outrage as, say, white supremacist and anti-Semite Richard Spencer.'	Question to Jeremy Hunt: Where is your article condeming Richard Spencer in the same fashion?
@stevesilberman I hope this isn't gonna be the tactic used when addressing north korea.	We'll let you do it, in return you see we have no actual power over the matter so please?
@SarahPalinUSA But does he know why the military told Mike Strange's father his body was cremated and then let him see his body 2 weeks later?
@RadioFreeTom Where do you think the venue will be?	Can't be here 	Can't be there.	I don't see china wanted to take the rap if anything goes awry.	South Korea is to close to there.
@tedlieu @RepKathleenRice @FBI can you link to the specific law on a .gov site?
@_Sweet_Lew @JayCaruso the path of least resistance
@_Sweet_Lew @JayCaruso no need to get upset, if i chose to run I would do it at a time when i thought it would be easy over a time when i thought it would be more difficult
@Popehat Heroin and fentanyl are legal medicines. Maybe we should address this.	Also from what I know some companies can still legally import the leaves that make cocaine. Maybe put this on the list to.
@_Sweet_Lew @JayCaruso I'll dig it up when I feel more invested in this. Also he doesn't see Utah as a strong way to win his candidacy. This is backwards thinking. You look for the path of least resistance. You go where you see weaknesses.
@_Sweet_Lew @JayCaruso No the thing is there's actually a part of that video missing where he says "you know who they are" which is met with hesitant laughter. If you think he's not a guy who will pander whatever the situation asks for and dictates by his audience I think you'd be mistaken.
@davidmweissman Just to clarify for people who don't know. Kosher is where food and the equipment used to produce it is blessed by a rabbi.	Halal is by an Islamic cleric.
@_Sweet_Lew @JayCaruso 47%
@AdamWeinstein It's gonna be nice when they find out the army commissions a videogame called AA: America's Army (it's actually pretty good).
@davidmweissman I see this being relevant in most cultures.
@davidmweissman That's a weird issue because I descend from jews so I don't fear that label and as a jew neither do you but people who aren't or don't are aware they have to be cautious of how they position themselves on the subject.
@davidmweissman It can be difficult to discern. A big reason for this is that anyone who disagrees with the stance the Israeli government maintains can be called an anti semite. I disagree with a bunch of their positions.
@JayCaruso someone who peddled racist rhetoric in a private meeting in an attempt to solicit campaign donations?
@Rollanderb @jules_su If your going to make statements like this, your not a journalist.	You don't get to separate your work from person on an account used to forward your work.
@Rollanderb @jules_su Yep, he apparently likes to make serious assumptions about a person's beliefs because of stance he's in opposition with.
@chrisgeidner Doesn't each state get to dictate what the legal age of being an adult is? 	Their lawsuit seems to be more in the realm of opinion then fact from what I've read in this post.

@jato791 @NRA Effective range is subjective because you have to account for trajectory, drag, and, drop. If I'm aware of these things I can measure what angle to shoot and have a acceptable measure of success.
@jato791 @NRA your attempting to maintain and is not a strong defense of that position.
@jato791 @NRA Their definition while you can  maintain it as correct has no bearing on the evolution of a term.	Also selective pattern could mean burst fire which is 2-3 rounds to automatic fire or single fire to burst fire which again is 2-3 rounds so your stance is arguable to the position
@owillis As someone who enjoys the analytics of conversation of different video game mechanics a favorite line of mine is your comparing something that's bad to something that's worse when it's all equally bad.
@owillis Well the Koch bros thing is subjective since the have several companies so without investigating those companies on their own removed from political money it's a hard case to make. I agree with your Murdoch stance. Farrakhan is a bigot. I don't see how that's defensible.
@NRA correct*
@NRA That's how the evolution of language works	(See conversate)
@NRA Assault weapons is a coreect term. It appears in several documents of goverment legislation.	As for assault rifle this is a new term and acceptable as credible terminology because it's implied definition is understood when a person uses it.
@Louise43478879 @SarahPalinUSA No i get it. Don't create alts.
@MattWalshBlog Ughh. Where to begin. First cite your studies. Second don't pretend your not covertly defending the second amendment by attacking the first amendment.
@tonyposnanski  https://t.co/hNWB5f2mwv
@JasonMillerinDC So naïve.
@chrislhayes @tgriffinnc @wrdcsc Of all of the things that make him a shitty president one trait that does come in handy here is his apparent lack of giving a fuck about the political stigma that is inevitably attached to this. Hopefully that trait also doesn't kill us.
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Terrible counsel,	Zero trust, demand verification.
@davidmweissman @votevets No. who controls the kingdom. Also we never went after Saudi government.	Ties there are to important in geographical sense.
@davidmweissman @votevets If Saudi Arabia denounced U.S.=U.S. would be fucked.	It would be like the pope telling religious people there's no god.
@davidmweissman @votevets Really? Saudi Arabia is U.S. biggest ally in the Mideast. Israel would never have activated it's military the way it has recently with out them. That comes with U.S. backing. Also india has become a lot more active. There's some serious wheels turning.
@yogi_lv @Fxflow @ComfortablySmug well played
@PaulSzoldra Bias aside what do you propose. It's this, more of the same, or war.
@davidmweissman Because most people just want a common enemy. It's a lot easier to destroy things then it is to build them.
@RepMattGaetz Aren't you a policy maker? that's who the article blames. So if that's the direction you want to go your in that group.
@RepWalorski I'm getting a vision. There will be a list of countries that the tariff applies to.	That list will not include the name of one specific country.
@RalstonReports How could that be legal if Adelson did it? 	I mean it can't be legal for me to give money to the government and say hey I'll only give it to you if it does this specific thing.	Right?
@GovMikeHuckabee @MariaBartiromo You guys want limited federal government or limited state government?	which one is it?
@McFaul Kinda weird your expecting any transparent response from a scenario in which a spy was killed by a spy.
@owillis @ArtrexisLives Fucked up how they want to address violence in video games and not shit like loot boxes and how addictive gambling is and how it shouldn't be legal for kids to do.
@owillis @ArtrexisLives I played it for so long over so many titles that's really only the surface of what I and many consider problematic. More how everything works from sweet spots, map design, recoil, spread, all that type of stuff. I feel it's going the direction  of cod.
@DonCheadle https://t.co/bLc29cY7KJ
@ArtrexisLives @owillis Somebody needs to make a new tenchu. Just not enough good stealth games out there.
@ArtrexisLives @owillis I tried pc just not good with it cause I'm shitty with M+K. I'm pretty jelly of the people who are good at it.
@owillis @ArtrexisLives liked*
@owillis @ArtrexisLives They sped up the running speed as compared to bf4, bf4 was still way better. Be better with the soldier slide. I like cod for a minute. like mw2 mw3 but it became so linear and campy.
@ArtrexisLives @owillis meh I like modern shooters. BF1 is alright. Just weird cool but weird. Kinda just quit it. Can't stand aim assist on console (I've been through every argument on the subject). Just a personal move couldn't do it anymore.
@owillis @ArtrexisLives So sorry were not impressed with double jumps.
@ArtrexisLives @owillis You beat me to it. Battlefields better. Oblivions better. Goddamn noobs and casuals everywhere.
@RJC @RepLeeZeldin @leezeldin Interesting theory of mine: 	Say my email was hacked.	Walk out with thumb drive.	Profit?
@davidharsanyi So you know I'm not on the "left". My opinion of him stemmed long before he was a household name in this country.
@davidharsanyi Yea it would. It should be just as this shit with Farrakhan should be a big story. Media covers a lot of shit. This should be among the forefront. I also think this about trump everyday.
@davidharsanyi How is it straw man? Sincerely my personal observation. My words aren't empty so please be aware I'm not hollow. I seek no audience other than the person I'm addressing.
@davidharsanyi Far as I can tell we (as in the majority of everyone) want this guy to go away.
@davidharsanyi I've pretty much witnessed just about everyone on both sides calling out this guy as a bigoted nut job. Haven't really seen anyone say anything in his defense cept maybe the one women who was at the event with him. Don't really know her exact take on it.
@ClancyReports It's really important. U.S. obviously doesn't want a united Asia in the long run. It ruins the idea of having a common enemy.
@ClancyReports The idea of empathy has to be removed from the forefront of the conversation if peace is the end game. It's an unfortunate reality that has to be present.
@ClancyReports I would pay for something. He has to have something physical to trade.
@ClancyReports where he installs a cabinet (semi democratic government) for transition and is still revered for some time until after his death. It can't and won't be immediate, urgency has no place in this because of all the failures beforehand. Longevity is the bigger play.
@ClancyReports If I were china I wouldn't want a untied Korea no matter what side. Main powers are main powers because they have large armies that keep small armies small. Those exercises won't stop. I only see a viable long term solution of a peaceful end to his dynasty.
@ClancyReports What's your take on that probability?
@ClancyReports It's bullshit. Talk big game, get a non profit to donate money for helping people, drop sanctions, boom go back to into the shell. Only way it works is to allow installation of multiple embassies which would include military personnel.
@RPhilipDG @nadabakos Haven't seen anything about it on my feed. I follow mad news people and news sites. Just about the recent one.
@RepMarkMeadows Zero mention of textbooks, chalk, not even fucking staplers.
@LauraMoritz @SteveDaines Not for nothing Costco s one of the exceptions, I'd expect them to do good by their employees regardless. As for this guy pushing the idea of corporate guts down our throats, he's full of shit.
@larryelder @ADL_National Again where does it say anywhere that 1/3rd of blacks are anti semitic?Show your work. Like what the fuck.
@LindseyGrahamSC How about being on time for your own function. Ridiculous.
@DineshDSouza I'll make note David Clarke is backing your resurfacing from the sewers.
@nadabakos I remember reading an article about the kgb spiking someones tea in a coffee shop (tea house?) in U.K. a couple years ago. Don't remember where I read it. Just feels like that story should be resurfacing right now.
@Heminator Interesting.
@Heminator Interesting perspective. The idea that kids should be raised respectfully and shouldn't have to endure being bullied until their grown when they are disrespected by others their simply snowflakes because they were raised in the fashion your presenting.
@DLoesch Thoughts on this?
@DLoesch As an organization that touts it's interest in protecting the 2A; it says that there should be a well regulated militia so there should be no conflict with militia members having to register and for an appointed board to take inventory of their stock at regular intervals.
@SenateMajLdr You ever think to yourself. Man I should do something good for people at least once in a while. Or is it a fuck it as long as nobody else gets to sit in my chair situation?
@HashtagGriswold Before you respond to any sense of being offended by that I like to let you know one of them is a marine.
@HashtagGriswold I don't know if you have sisters bro. I have 4. Shit like this does go through their minds. So much in fact their favorite part of any Disney movie is in frozen where the main girl (don't know here name) punches pompous guy in the face.
@larryelder @jaketapper @LouisFarrakhan 1/3rd of blacks are anti semitic? Like what kind of fucking statement is that?
@caseyjohnston 2k used to have a million dollar competition where the first person to pitch a perfect game in their baseball video game won a million dollars. Revolutionized how pitching worked, is even apparent in the show. Just sayin really.
@PhillyInquirer https://t.co/EZxVpZsHrN
@davidmweissman You'll find more talk off the statitics and what people consider to be flaws and those will be the arguments you come across. It's always a conversation about the best strageties to employ in every different little scenerio.
@davidmweissman Nope. Played battlefield for like a decade. Wouldn't think about killing anyone. Know the competitve gamers and thousands of youtubers wouldn't either aside from the rare few just like in real life.
@patternivory @Lexialex It's a heap of trash. There's so many pointless references to dc animes and comic books that make zero sense in their context. This article puts way to much thought into how it's just a bad movie.
@PhillyDailyNews Not a cheesesteak, that's a sandwich, don't write an article how new takes on cheesesteaks have been corrupted and then present a new take on a cheesesteak.
@JenAshleyWright Saw my mom making making chicken rolling it in flour, she was on the phone and she said "I'm making it from scratch."	I thought flour was scratch and I asked "how come we don't make everything from scratch?"	I thought you could make all food from flour.	I was like 5
@GlennKesslerWP Still an imbalance when it comes to import/export has to have and still has to exist.
@GlennKesslerWP I'm not for a steel tariff, that really makes no sense to me. I only see this as articficially and knowingly manipulating the price of metals.
@GlennKesslerWP Obviously some imbalance has to exist. Hundreds of thousands of jobs became vacant because of outsourcing. While it may be cheaper to manufacture other places it probably wouldn't have happened so dramatically if the price to bring those goods in was properly levied.
@SkyNews Media need to sensationalize shit for attention grabbing headlines is big part of the problem.	 Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri
@SkyNews This is the shit that helped raise their influence.	His name is  Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri	NOT Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi
@MZHemingway survived*
@MZHemingway " It’s not as traumatic an experience as you have been led to believe."	I know this is a line I took from the article that's way out of context.	I however would suggest that one should consider how they structure their sentences when addressing people who survuved mass shootings.
@MZHemingway Robert Tracinski is a scumbag. This is what this article taught me. The statistics he shows say mass shootings have gone down (not really sure if that's right) so kids who survived one don't know what they're saying.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends Simple things like running a red light for no valid reason can really change the perception of policemen to the average person. Haven't seen a beat cop since high school. Increasingly feels like police and community are 2 seperate things.
@AltUSPressSec Even just the act itself should be considered insulting. A verified account of a man who titled the account as 45th President of the United States condemns free speech if it's against him.
@DonCheadle I'd like to know who they mean by video game industry. That's a really broad scope. There's so many companies.
@CNN "It's absolutely ludicrous," Spear said. "Maybe [in several] decades we're talking about a driverless environment. Our ability to attract new talent into the trucking industry is really impeded."	-ceo of truckers association-	a sincere lack of foresight here
@SarahPalinUSA Super weird the articles headline goes after free lunches of all the things it had the chance to go with. Just saying you follow some off the wall "news" sites. I'm pretty okay with people eating regardless of their political stance.

@PatsFan876 @dmartosko @realDonaldTrump It was a joke. I don't watch fox, well locally for real news but not pundit progams which I don't really watch on any channel.
@GuilfoyleJJ @davidmweissman It's
@GuilfoyleJJ @davidmweissman It to cheer our champions no matter what.
@GuilfoyleJJ @davidmweissman The idea isn't for us to agree. It's to be rivals and provide entertainment.
@dmartosko @realDonaldTrump Fox hasn't aired anything on it yet. Tomorrows in the a.m.
@davidmweissman Crazy characters, controversy, conflict, and fighting. It's not a peaceful event and it's not supposed to be.
@davidmweissman My observation on how trump won. His campaign was able to politize an untapped base nobody expected. The wwe. Your a fan, go back and look at how it was used and how close to home it felt. What does wrestling need to be popular?
@FoxNews Also it's operator, your a forklift operator. If you want to try and employ credibility do your due diligence and use the correct terminology.
@FoxNews I'm pretty fucking confused on this.	I know no forklift driver that has the power to bring any member of the press into where they work without any incident or accident occuring.	This makes me logically conclude that while he might drive a forklift it's not his title.
@FoxNewsResearch @FoxNews -Nunberg and Trump sued each other in 2016.	You pay too much for your researchers who are bad at their jobs.	Or your liars who purposely exclude relevant facts.

@SethAMandel Why? They should keep going as long as he wants to talk.
@andylassner @FLOTUS @POTUS Being reimbursed could just mean he had the money beforehand. I use my money for one thing. I use your money for a different thing. Just an indirect payment. He just says he wasn't reimbursed for this specific action. I would think that he already had an expense fund.

@JennyAvila representatives or do we shut the door to them and then have very little idea of the entire situation and are left with a greater lack of information.
@JennyAvila I'm reading on it, some of it seems credible but I always take this stuff with a grain of salt because as someone who's not directly involved there will always be missing info. 	I see the a more interesting question on the subject. Do we elect to hold talks with their
@JennyAvila @marcorubio @rafaellacava10 You also replied to me with an article to explain why it's bad, I didn't request that but if you want to pursue that avenue than that burden falls on you. I'll remain objective, not positive or negative about my opinion on the subject until relevant information is provided.
@JennyAvila @marcorubio @rafaellacava10 So I have to assume it was pulled from somewhere else and used as a type of slander.
@JennyAvila @marcorubio @rafaellacava10 incredibly obvious to come to his conclusions. He said it, he should explin why. My question about his appearance stems from not finding it on the page which he asks to investigate.
@JennyAvila @marcorubio @rafaellacava10 No. I want Marco Rubio who I can only surmise to be claiming that this guy has an undesirable agenda to explain why? He says you should investigate his feed, I did although not wholly because I'm obviously not as invested in his contempt for the man. I saw nothing

@marcorubio @rafaellacava10 I don't get it.
@marcorubio @rafaellacava10 You want to be more specific about his feed. All I see is his dislike of garbage on the street and promoting building infrastructure. Am I missing something? Or are you attacking his appearance?
@davidmweissman Lets not play the if obama game. There's a lot of people's hands I would not shake because I don't respect them. Their title and status are not measures that I use to evaluate who has my respect. It's this type of complicity that gets us to things like tyranny.
@davidmweissman If I hold power and you hold power and we disagree on the phone one of us will hang up. I can see this happening all the time. Trump is not an omni god with unlimited power on everything. If someone can put him in check of that it's a smart move.
@davidmweissman I feel that's a bit of a one sided take. First I find a lot of what trump does "disgusting" although I'd probably use different words for it. We maintain the right to free speech. Also i don't see it as the president listening to him for advice on the subject.
@benshapiro You obviously don't see the set up. Outrageous and outlandish, it's a joke. Tomorrow it's something that's not as outrageous and outlandish and it's not a joke and so on and so on.
@TheAtlantic @DKThomp I think that a lot of companies looked at their books and realized that there was little financial incentive when comparing it to the impact of association and used it as an excuse to off load excess weight. You can claim a moral issue exists but money is the primary factor.
@RepLeeZeldin I like the idea.
@scottlincicome aren't*
@scottlincicome He obviously has enough money to buy a can of soup and a can of soda from seven eleven and not think that those prices are very high to the average consumer.
@ShaunKing @TamikaDMallory While I believe you are right in this instance, as someone who notably makes an effort to address racism and bigotry and the inherent inequalities that they create you must know that it doesn't require self awareness to be a purveyor when it comes to them.

@RoKhanna You didn't know? 	We can convince companies who pay 0% to pay more because we lowered their tax rate to above 0%. They can still pay 0% but ya know the option is there if they want to pay more than 0%.
@WalshFreedom I can see why you were a bad politician. Lack of compromise.
@JerryDunleavy A country that has no steel can still be classified as a country. 	Interesting a tariff is going to be implemented on consumers to offset tax cuts.	Taxation to offset a reduction in taxation. huh.

@GOP_Delenda_Est @DLoesch So you know my aggravation with misleading people this way when it comes to surveys or polls has no bias. You can check. I go after everyone for it because it's a lie.
@GOP_Delenda_Est @DLoesch Not really. If i take a poll of 20 people and categorize them and then go on to say 60% of a demographic that had not participated in the poll desire an outcome it's a lie.
@DLoesch Even worse the poll states 73% of dems  favor it strongly and 9% favor it somewhat for a total of 82%	(somewhat favoring something does not display an explicit desire to do anything)	(now your just lying about numbers that are very transparent) (sad)
@DLoesch Actually 82% of 495 participants in a poll that had 1,498 participants for this specific question.	(why is the question not included in the text for the poll your citing?)
@DLoesch 82% of 501 participants in a poll that had 1,498 participants.

@RepMarkMeadows There's something on your nose.
@davidmweissman That would definitely cut out half of this argument as defensible reasoning.
@davidmweissman I feel it would be very fair to have anyone who was honorably or medically (physical) discharged to be provided with a waver allowing them to purchase them.
@joncoopertweets Trump: "settle down mike it's just a basketball game."		Pence: "All these sweaty men oh my. This is nice."

@MonYounger @beckieholt @seanspicer @sean It's never really amazes me that the defense of what someone meant is different then the words they choose to use. My advice to them is to choose different words.
@beckieholt @seanspicer @sean In the context of the statement he makes here he's arguing that teachers should not get a 5% raise because of a 4-5 day absence because they are protesting (A 1st amendment right). That he disagrees with what they are protesting is irrelevant.
@JayCaruso You know who they are. Even in random conversation I could say the name and you'd know who I was talking about. Also Travis Barker has far more reach in the music community then you might think. Drum Beats come from drummers.
@BorisEP @realDonaldTrump Bullshit. he was taking a shot at one person directly who apparently thinks he's above the law. From my perspective it looks like the process of peace is through war and death when it comes to this administration.
@WuMargaret @kurteichenwald That's arguable because apparently it was a voluntary program. If correct though it does show that they did indeed profit from the manufacturing and sales of guns.
@seanspicer I find it appalling a school shooting had to bring politicians out of the wood works and then see the amount of teachers who appear in every thread requesting basic supplies from these same politicians.
@seanspicer Your against giving teacher's a modest raise because of a 4 day absence in contrast to a lifetime dedicated to education?
@kurteichenwald Smith &amp; Wesson gave more than $1 million. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company raised $1.25 million through a program in which it donated $1 to the NRA-ILA for each gun it sold from May 2011 to May 2012.		Pulled this off wiki. Can someone fact check this?
@kaitlancollins It's more suspicious to me his meetings with Saudi diplomats who have allied with Israel fighting in Yemen.
@kaitlancollins Not really. He's already exploited his access. Gained an incredible amount of classified information. Has had meeting with foreign diplomats. I don't find this unusual that companies think of ways to exploit someone for their own gain. I find it's probably incredibly normal.
@RepKathleenRice Can you elaborate on the specifics of what classifies"dangerous mental illnesses"?
@boblatta Please release the names publicly. No one takes like this. This is how people talk.
@JayCaruso He said these actions are for conservatives. Is the NRA a official representative of conservatives? Are all their members conservatives?
@KenCalvert They should also not be entitled to receive anything that union dues pay for.
@Larsofhaus1 @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump There's always a question have you ever had negative thoughts or something like this. Everyone answers no even though it that answer would indicate mental instability.
@Larsofhaus1 @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump There's another set of questions as to what adequate defines. If you want to consider it seriously what amount of training determines this. Also everybody lies on mental health tests.
@ShaunKing No it is not.
@CaseyCagle @Delta @NRA I was not aware the nra was a recognized representative of a political party.
@CaseyCagle @Delta @NRA So you as public official just threatened a negative financial impact of a private company through public office.
@AnjiUsa @davidmweissman Think of the border wall. It's a proposal to reduce accessibility.
@AnjiUsa @davidmweissman by removing the accessiblility to commit crimes that have large impacts we can reduce the impact of the crimes they commit
@davidmweissman @Larsofhaus1 @realDonaldTrump You can be capable by having the expectation that these events will occur and disregard the question of why should we be forced to have that expectation.
@davidmweissman @Larsofhaus1 @realDonaldTrump Being capable is arguable. A common thing I see is people dismissing these shooters as cowards and equating that with a lack of intelligence. This in my opinion is a grave mistake.
@davidmweissman though*
@davidmweissman The issue does remain bigger than schools thpugh so when you see someone no matter how big argue about this specific event without the full context that includes all the other events it's best to remind them of the entire issue.
@davidmweissman Yea. I went to school with metal detectors. While this alone doesn't alleviate the issue of gun reform or gun safety it did provide an element of safety when it came to school.
@davidmweissman What happens if they teacher ends up being the crazy one?

@PoliticusSarah @MichaelSteele It was crazy. From a viewers perspective it appeared he was asking for him to show grace in the face of blatant racism.
@WalshFreedom combat*
@WalshFreedom Not one for semantics but for you. Yea I'll use it.
@WalshFreedom It's easier than getting a commercial driver's license. Several conbat veterans have made the claim that their service weapons were near identical versions to legally available weapons hence military grade.
@brianklaas say*
@brianklaas Above answer on weak statement is correct only they wouldn't say problematic they would sat unfortunate.
@iamjoedw No worries. Best of luck.
@iamjoedw The larger the impact the less accessible it should become.
@iamjoedw Taking away the accessibility to the guns won't deter crime. It will change the impact the crime causes.
@iamjoedw It's not a scrabble book. Many times I think I know a word that I think I should use and if I'm not sure I'll google it to see if I'm correct.
@iamjoedw You say potential dumbasses should see what happens to other dumbasses than maybe they'll think twice. That's displaying a consequence to others expecting they won't do something because of the consequence. That's a deterrent. It's using the fear of consequence.
@iamjoedw Explain what?
@chrisgeidner "Only the best people"
@iamjoedw What your describing is displaying a consequence in an attempt to use it as a deterrent. Your defeating your own argument.
@iamjoedw That's a relevant philosophical question that applies to pretty much all laws. Do we commit our actions because were good and moral or because we have a fear of consequence?
@iamjoedw @fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw Great in hindsight and past tence. It has no value in foresight and actions that haven't been commited.
@iamjoedw @fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw No they won't stop. It's the accessibility to commit a crime that's in question.
@iamjoedw @fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw It's not really the bottom line (saying that doesn't make it true).
@fjrsally @iamjoedw @humblegrinn @tribelaw you*
@fjrsally @iamjoedw @humblegrinn @tribelaw I really don't understand the comparison your making. I feel like your trying to drive me toward what yoy think is the logical answer instead of speaking about the subject directly.
@fjrsally @iamjoedw @humblegrinn @tribelaw I really don't get the comparison because you say there is no comparison. I'm in favor of reform that is safely implememted. I can't advocate for the end of deadly violence through the inevitable use of deadly violence.
@fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw I'm all for it I was just addressing what I think of instant ban.
@fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw There's a lot of scenarios to consider.
@fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw If a person goes to a doctor a gets prescribed antidepressants that information remains between the patient and doctor.	If a person is involved in a lawsuit where the claim pain and suffering that could also be considered a mental illness.
@fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw I get that and I agree for the most part. The hard part is if a person is say involved in a such a thing but has not been criminally convicted than you can't classify them as a criminal so they get to retain all of their rights.
@fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw Each law merits a different consequence when breaking it. Your not going to jail for a parking ticket and your not gonna get a ticket for committing murder.
@fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw Actually the thread started was by a havard guy calling to ban certain guns which many people right now legally own. Your question referring to breaking the law to me really depends on which law.
@fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw Depends which law. The thought that changing a law making certain guns instantly illegal while millions of people have these gun legally as of right now will lead to deadly violence.
@WendellSherk @tribelaw disregard*
@WendellSherk @tribelaw I think this is a more viable solution. By curtailing numbers produced by manufacturers a safer solution could be reached. Everyone argues over what exists as of right for the sake of their own argument while seeming to disregarding any thought of longevity.
@fjrsally @humblegrinn @tribelaw No absolutely not. I think that the idea of confiscation through confrontation would result in an incredible amount of deadly violence.
@tribelaw The consequences of initiating a ban would need to be through confiscation which would likely lead to bloodshed. Even through a buyback program many people would elect not to participate. What are your idea for achieving this in a peaceful manner?
@NDCTrump “This survey was conducted online within the United States from February 16-19, 2018, among 1,934 registered voters by The Harris Poll.”	What percentage of voters is 1934?	Where is a link to the questions included in the poll and how were participants considered eligible?
@NoahCRothman Using a weapon at a 30 frames per second refresh rate loop performs differently then at 60 fps, 80, 120.
@NoahCRothman They would also know that the statistical relevance and viability of a weapon differs when you change the frame per second refresh rate.
@RepAdamSchiff Maybe he's acknowledging that the memo confirms that all the terrible things done by people in his campaign were so illegal. I find if you break his statements in to separate segments he speaks backwards like it's a form of dyslexia.
@WalshFreedom Here's an interesting theoretical question for you joe. What happens when all the people claiming to fight tyranny are the ones backing the tyrant?
@mattsgorman @yashar @AmericanAir They're elite world champions. You would think they would be flying first class for free.
@calebecarma as a joke.
@calebecarma Although I get you as an individual find humor in it I think that the free press at large should take it far more seriously. Consider a person who worked in the whitehouse at an event attended by lawmakers used physical force on a member of the press and it's being dismissed...
@Michael2014abc @LawrenceBJones3 Even with 30 seconds could cause a lot of problems. I could screenshot you or anybody liking my tweet immediately after I post the original before you'd be able to unlike it.
@MarkYoungTruth I've never known it for it's hype in movies, games, or media. I know it's favored because of it's accessibility in reality. Please reference your work for these claims.
@SpyTalker Members of his own party booed the idea of the law which allowed him citizenship at an event where he spoke. Wow.

@davidmweissman reasonable not responsible but yea also responsible
@davidmweissman I would like to see the email being reffered to and all underlining documentation of this. I feel that's a responsible request to a group who obsesses over emails.
@CBSNews You should change this headline, obviously stealing a car was not the primary motive.
@RadioFreeTom Even worse had he killed several students and increased the number of deaths.
@RadioFreeTom Very few scenarios would portray him heroically. He dies. He kills the shooter. He dies and kills the shooter. In no way do I see him killing a student and saying it was collateral damage provide a positive portrayal.
@bungdan It's exactly what a lot claim to detest. Sensationalist news without complete context and facts.
@DLoesch @Zeddary I think he was just referencing the name of the well known cartoon character rick sanchez https://t.co/q5MZilfvwa
@Spacekatgal They're picking the wrong fight. If any politician thinks they analyze statistics a lot they should visit a video game forum.
@MarcACaputo I think there's a lack of relevant information like when he called it in was he aware of how many shooters there were and was he told to wait for backup. I would also like someone to find out what his background and training was.
@mchooyah It obviously not going to happen but the subject of gun safety does has your attention.
@pbump He's an idiot for even suggesting attacking that base. He may think he has an army of trolls. Nothing compares to the gamers of youtube, reddit, and 4chan.
@afbranco These shooters have shown a propensity for violent interaction so school A does remains a legitamite option for them.

@TreschWilliam @future_dynamics @benshapiro I can understand that. I also feel I'm a rational person. His content on this platform doesn't persuade me to observe his ideas because of how he uses it whether they're good or not.
@marcorubio A bit to soon for sarcasm eh? I can only take away from this that you think this whole subject is a joke.

@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro with these*
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro Everyone is law abiding and non violent until the day they aren't.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro The point I make is if I had a nefarious motive I have the weapons, They aren't mine but I have them. That's a dangerous situation. It's a really dangerous situation that the idea is lets just trust people with the weapons.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro I have no irrational fear, I lack interest. I have had ample opportunity.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro manufacturers*
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro I think they should have picked multiple targets. The NRA aren't manufactures.
@Jasta1985 @AK49AT @benshapiro They're actions unfortunately display a level of intelligence especially when it comes to planning.
@Jasta1985 @AK49AT @benshapiro A big thing you'll see is we have to prevent these cowards from doing these things. A typical person doesn't view themselves as a coward even if everyone else does and they will equate it with a lack of intelligence.
@Jasta1985 @AK49AT @benshapiro The age to 21 thing I don't think will happen, maybe 20, and that's a big maybe, other's will contend that 18 your a legal adult and list all the things that are legal as an adult. I don't really have a hard position on it at the moment.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro They are inanimate objects that are very dangerous but I do even if they aren't mine and that's what a lot of people I think don't understand.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro My sister and her husband are marines. Through them I probably have more access to AR-15's than most people because they own them. I have zero training with gun and have never shot one. I've held pretty much all of them. I don't think I should have access to them.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro To each they're own when it comes to comedy. I think certain people with large audiences should take more time to consider what that means and what they can do with it.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro I have bigger ideas but they're not rational to propose unless there's a consideration for the long term which so many people will dismiss because everyone likes to think every answer is meant for a short window of time.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro It's not ideal in any way but it is a small opening into they're industry and I think with so much money spent on government policy, laws, and politicians it wouldn't conflict with them being a private enterprise.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro I don't know. I get the humor. I like dark satire but on a much different level. I won't claim to know his intent, only how I perceive it. My proposal is far smaller and simpler, I think the NRA should be pressured to post gun safety articles on they're homepage.
@future_dynamics @AK49AT @benshapiro I mean I think he does a better job than fox news which feeds itself exclusively on controversy.I know that's a low bar but that's the bar as it is right now. I don't know hollow, I wouldn't make that judgement. Everyone is predictable is you follow them long enough.
@future_dynamics @benshapiro Ya know I don't dislike him. I disagree with him playing sycophant instead of him having a meaningful impact. I think he's pretty smart and his audience and platforms are large enough to where he could potentially drive a narrative that could help save a person's life.
@paladincompserv @AK49AT @benshapiro As far as the article being posted, I did not see it. What I witness is insults to the left (not my group so attacking them doesn't affect me in any impactful way). It's obvious that action pushes people away, it doesn't invite people who may disagree.
@paladincompserv @AK49AT @benshapiro every thread I read there does seem to exist level headed people on both sides. They're impact might not be headline worthy but exist and can be approached.
@paladincompserv @AK49AT @benshapiro So the idea is to make possible proposals for a solution maybe hoping to have a sincere discussion with people you might disagree with and then insult them? I know it's far easier to find people who are outrageous and fringe on both sides but in nearly every comment section of
@paladincompserv @AK49AT @benshapiro So instead of proposing them on this platform he insults his perceived opponents.
@paladincompserv @AK49AT @benshapiro Furthermore you provide a link to an outside source that proposes solutions that are put forth with the idea that they shouldn't be presented because of the perception your opponent won't consider it. These things are in the same article.
@paladincompserv @AK49AT @benshapiro from seeking treatment. I detest the notion that slogans or rhetoric of my perceived opponents won't allow for rational compromise and at least some form of minimal solution.
@paladincompserv @AK49AT @benshapiro I commend the effort to put forth proposals although I disagree because of my actual right sided view is that members of my family don't speak for me as an individual. As far as mental health, I believe this will prove to create an even larger stigma that deters even more people
@t_ancap @benshapiro sorry, -except +accept*
@t_ancap @benshapiro There are restrictions on all of your rights regardless of whether you want to except that notion or not.
@AK49AT @benshapiro On this platform I can. I said I may be wrong but on this specific platform I haven't witnessed any such effort. If you want to lead me to an outside source from here to  where it does exist, I see that as a problem.
@AK49AT @benshapiro I don't I'm not really a fan. I follow him and others on this platform because of they're relevance which is directly related to this platform. All I've seen is him make an attempt at being dry and witty to insult people on this platform.
@benshapiro s. Effort isn't a one sided ordeal.
@benshapiro All I really see you do is take of people you disagree with and attempt to insult them. I don't remember you proposing any particular solution, I may be wrong but I don't see you making an effort to find a rational dialogue about the situation. As noted in this very tweet of your

@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald Yea I been thinking about this. Perfect time for anyone of age that's  directly involved in this tragedy (teacher, parent, coach, etc.) to run for office. The sooner that election even if only local the better.
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews "This is not in some abandoned lot or underneath a freeway overpass." 	Yea tucker this shit exists in real life, don't be shocked when confronted with it in plain sight. I'm so sorry your outrage is that is that exists in a place where it is visible to you.
@WalshFreedom @ChrisMurphyCT +of*
@WalshFreedom @ChrisMurphyCT I've read your tweets. I don't consider you very open minded when it comes to an open debate on guns. One way or another I don't feel your the source that can rationally express the idea compromise when it comes to guns.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald Well that should be somebody puts into a bill that goes to congress. Now would be the time to write that proposal. Lobbysists who have money in goverment should have contractual obligations regarding safety in they're respected enterprises.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald We can hope but what kind of change? The very people who have claimed they want smaller less intrusive goverment is seriously considering turning public schools into military bases.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald As it relates to my issue with the lack of gun safety articles on the NRA homepage. Everyone wants to topple the tower. All good and well, that can be used to open a small door and remove bricks from it's base.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald Yea it is. I'm saying choosing certain keywords or hashtags is relevant to the success and awareness to enable actual change.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald As I said no one would use the words gun safety in a negative light. It doesn't require millions of dollar to form a setence or question.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald Absolutely. So someone has to create a question he looks really bad for disagreeing with. Things like "pre existing conditions" are untouchable. He can try and eliminate coverage in a bill but verbally he would never say a negative thing about it.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald bad*
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald Yea but it's always smarter to craft and use words that would make your opponent look bad if they said it verbally to an audience. No politician is going to say they want to end gun safety or say gun safety is a gad idea.  It's all in the words you choose.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald ne says it out loud.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald Examples are guncontrol, gunreform hashtags are not as successful as they should be and it'd be better if they changed it to gunsafety. Think of the war on terror. Not many politicians will say let's end the war on terror, not because they disagree but it sounds stupid when someo
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald They promote selling guns with very little regulation and spend money to try and ensure that so I agree. I think certain things could be used to a better effect.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald -.*
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald The NRA.They use fear mongering to promote the idea of a fictitious enemy known as they (&lt;&lt;&lt;this is true they have commercials that literally narrate an entity known as "they"). are trying to attack them and take away they're rights and the only way to fight back is to own guns.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald I feel the same sympathy, the people who operate what your fighting against don't operate that way.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald It does speak to the issue. Not every solution has to be iconic with a big reveal. Some are and it's a necessary thing for public persuasion but not every one has to be like that.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald You would think for a company that has millions involved in politics that would be a logical first step commitment they should be pressured to make by people who received money for they're campaigns.
@CoachRHarris @kurteichenwald I believe in it being a regulated industry, I disagree on certain aspects of his proposals. I think a lot of people miss the obvious which I have been trying to point out for a couple days. The NRA's homepage is devoid of anything related to gun safety.
@kurteichenwald I can agree with some of it but it does remain a constitutional right so I can't agree with the insurance thing. No one should owe money for exercising a right.

@BuckSexton Instead of asking this question how about we start an attempt at a coherent debate? Where would you like to begin?
@thor_benson He'll creep back out, just pay attention to those who back him when he does.
@thor_benson The conservatives know he's tainted at least temporarily. They'll attempt to replace him to fill the ranks. Then comes dealing with the new guy and considering him for the long term.
@thor_benson You have to make sure that line stays severed.
@thor_benson He was just removed from what's gotta be the largest conservative grouping there is with various extensions to different media and networks. Even if you think they're fanatics they aren't idiots.
@thor_benson So if you see him on national tv know he was invited there.
@thor_benson I'm going to counter that with we must maintain attention to what he just did. He essentially blacklisted himself. We have to make sure that there really is a line people on his side won't cross and will reject.

@henryfarrell @HeerJeet You give me a mil+ a month or any other that task is well funded.
@henryfarrell @HeerJeet I understand that's the comparison. Applying that amount to a set of individuals to accomplish a very specific task has a very high likelihood of success regardless of where the money comes from.
@HeerJeet @henryfarrell From this article: Instead, a loose collective of Russians, with incredibly meager resources....., I thought reports indicated resources of 1 million+ a month. If correct I don't see how anyone can catergorize this as "meager".
@SteveDaines If it takes a company 19 years to acquire a new forklift they either have the best maintenance crew in existence or they knowingly run busted sub par equipment. One new forklift? Are you kidding me? In 19 years?

@BorisEP Can you cite multiple usda sources for a lower number (preferably one that doesn't include proposed cuts to the program)? Can you also explain how the goverment would maintain contracts with food manufacturers and distributors?
@AdamWeinstein Your proposal has no rational parameters.
@AdamWeinstein It's a bad idea. In high school a friend and I were nearly expelled for writing a fictional story about a zombie outbreak. The story was graphically violent but it was fictional and it wasn't created with any other intent other than we thought entertaining.
@benshapiro No*
@benshapiro To believe you understand God's plan you have to assume you also have the perception of a god and to do that you have to align yourself as an equal to a god which would make you superior to those who are not god.
@benshapiro That's not what he said. There is mo conflict between a higher being and science. The possibility it actually very realistic. There are those who do things that are malicious that claim it's part of God's plan. There are onlookers and witnesses who will claim the same.
@Anon58822506 @KFILE I clicked on trending. Clicked on a music video. Was the first thing that showed up. It's not hidden deep in something layered. It's very front and center on one the biggest social media platforms in the world.
@Anon58822506 @KFILE Yea but not all of social media. They have chosen a venue to respond. You should watch the ads. It's an extreme portrayal of victimization.
@Anon58822506 @KFILE This is before the shooting. Every single ad unless they knowingly targeted a 5 year old as potential customer.
@Anon58822506 @KFILE Not only that. They have no demographics that I've noticed. It's generalized. Any video can randomly have their ads. I discovered that watching peppa pig with my niece and every ad was for depression medication
@Anon58822506 @KFILE The idea that they have gone silent on social media is not true.
@Anon58822506 @KFILE Twitter is only one form of social media. A very political version of it where ads are not very prominent. Youtube has a built in ad program which forces you to watch at least a segment of a commerical.
@Anon58822506 @KFILE Conclude that telling me my point is terrible and correcting my grammatical error you haven't even seen the ads I'm speaking of.
@Anon58822506 @KFILE It's not a terrible point. He cites the lack of silence on social media. They have only gone silent on twitter which does not account for all of social media. They have launched an aggressive counter campaign. I can logically
@justinbaragona @NRA I don't know why nobody pays attention. They have new ads on youtube. You ever here the expression "hit em' where they ain't"? Twitter is only a fraction of the spectrum.
@WalshFreedom Six people were killed and 21 others were wounded in shootings.... Quite literally in the first setence of the article you just posted.
@KFILE Except your wrong. They have at least 2 new commercials on youtube. It's not only a video platform. It's the younger generation's largest social media platform.
@NATHANINSOCAL @seanmdav @DLoesch Is?
@seanmdav @DLoesch Their*
@seanmdav @DLoesch We can't have an honest debate when major players with large audiences on both sides resort to visual propaganda to attack the domestic opponents. Like the picture used as the heading of this article because it's not rooted in reality.
@BuckSexton She spoke of her own free will. It's disgraceful that your displeased with the words of traumatized children speaking about the reasons they are traumatized.
@realDonaldTrump What the fuck is wrong with you? Like what the fuck?
@WalshFreedom Just a terrible analogy.
@KurtSchlichter No rational person is asking this.
@Reuters The article fails to cite qualcomm eld's which are present in most American companies tracter trailers which transport the majority of military and consumer goods in the country. It's not a fair offer.
@mlcalderone You should know that the NRA has launched it's counter campaign. It's a 1 min 6 sec ad on youtube. So maybe inform someone of that.
@redsteeze @DavidAFrench I think JROTC is a good program but it's military funded. I know this because one of my siblings was in it and got credit in the Marines once they enlisted and still are. The money should go directly to the military to fund the program. Not directly to the program.
@ClintSmithIII I was just thinking the same thing. Like damn I just want to see it because it looks good and I want to be entertained.
@NOLA_JT @DavidAFrench JROTC is a military sponsored program. A student can earn served credit in the military when they officially enlist by attending. This is money in politics.
@GovMikeHuckabee what they deem credible threats.
@GovMikeHuckabee Actually the weapon is a common denominator. It existed at every shooting. Every person has an intent. You should go back and have them explain to you how they analyze the manifestation of violent intent and I'd put money a weapon that fires projectiles exists in nearly all of
@JYSexton Depression is so common medicine for it is commercialized but to acquire it you have to sign a form indicating a mental health issue.
@JYSexton There's a problem with destigmatizing mental health issues. If a person writes down an answer on any form indicating a mental health issue they are immediately disqualified from many things.
@JYSexton There has to be small pushes instead of condemnation. Every other industry that I'm aware of publishes safety information even if they don't really want to and it's very visible.
@JYSexton I see the problem being with choosing which words to use. Gun Reform, Gun control. These can easily be interpreted as an attack on the 2nd amendment. I mentioned yesterday how I could not find the word safety or any variant of it on the NRA homepage.
@AllenWest Link doesn't work
@realDonaldTrump Had you said something to the effect that foreign attempts to meddle in our free elections is a very serious problem I'd be able to sympathize. Instead you act only out of self preservation. You cannot prove the election results were not impacted.
@FLGovScott What about you? Your the governor of the state. You don't get to be exempt.
@JYSexton Here's something you might find interesting. I've been on the NRA homepage for about 2 days refreshing it randomly and scrolling it. I haven't yet found the word Safety to exist on the page at all. I could be wrong but I still can't find it.
@RepDennisRoss @CFPB You could show an effort to make low income Americans not have low income instead of reject the idea of raising minimum wage and pretend to be a champion of it when a few select companies to raise it according to their own policies. I'm calling bullshit.
@RepSteveIsrael I just understand why anyone doesn't just interupt their moment of silence. As soon as they attempted to have it someone should have said I don't fucking think so.
@WalshFreedom Here's what I found out. All these shootings involved three things. Humans, Guns, and, Bullets. You can take that anyway you want. You cannot deny any of those three things. These are facts.
@tribelaw @TuckerCarlson You should explain to him what common denominators are. He knows he's full of it but a he's so over the edge he can't come back without losing part of his audience.
@seanhannity @edhenry How do you take tough action on mental health? It's an odd choice of words. Do you think a person who kills other without remorse is incable of lying on a piece of paper?
@tonyposnanski He needed to meet with federal authorities to come to this conclusion. He's not the brightest bulb in the box.
@KurtSchlichter Let me help you. 17 children died today. They are dead.
@WalshFreedom statistically*
@WalshFreedom Teacher gets pissed off somewhere else, kills someone. I mean what drug do you smoke that makes you think we should live in the wild west?
@WalshFreedom All teachers have guns now. One somewhere forgot to secure it safely. Statically completely plausible because there are a lot of teachers. Student gets a gun. someone dies. Another student somewhere else starts a shooting, teacher shoots back, kills even more people.

@Apparentropy @bdomenech something or someone regardless of the subject matter. srry for the late reply I work and sleep.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech I gave my perspective. I read the article, I follow or followed the people I mentioned and read the articles they linked so I don't understand how you say I'm a sniping tourist. I came across something and responded. I didn't actively seek to go against
@Apparentropy @bdomenech I did answer that question, what other question you asked would address it?. I don't understand this at all. I responded to a post. My response was one of disagreement. You then began a discussion with me. I replied. I don't know what you mean by framing a discussion.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech Get what? I can read your words not the emotion you put into them so either your asking me a direct question or your attempting to insult me in a subtle manner.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech is off the wall, irresponsible, and, just completely fucked up.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech In one article and it deserved every bit of criticism it got. The critism was fair but the comparison to being sympathetic to nazi germany is being used by a guy who frequently appears on national television, wrote a book on propaganda, and held a position in our goverment
@Apparentropy @bdomenech Not that I recall. Why?
@JasonMillerinDC @cnsnews January 2009, the month Obama was inaugurated, and the Januaries in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016.
@JasonMillerinDC @cnsnews Over the last twenty fiscal years, going back to 1999, the federal government has run surpluses in the month of January 13 times and deficits 7 times. Six of the Januaries in which the federal government ran deficits overlapped President Barack Obama’s time in office—including
@JasonMillerinDC @cnsnews Context: Despite the monthly surplus of $49,236,000,000, the federal government is still running a deficit of approximately $175,718,000,000 for fiscal year 2018. That is because the government entered the month with a deficit of approximately $224,955,000,000.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech It's now an attack. Not satire.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech No it's my fault. I said it can be a harmless joke. The larger your audience becomes the less of a joke it will become because eventually it's design is no longer humorous but an act of malice.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech What do you mean?
@Apparentropy @bdomenech Absolutely. I don't consider this type of stuff a joke when it comes from someone who is continually invited too appear on national tv to speak to an audience of millions even thousands.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech I assume it's his rebuttal to CNN's headline and article positively depicting North Korea diplomats. It's propaganda in full effect.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech It's a depiction of Hitler and others giving the Nazi salute claiming this is how cnn celebrates the Olympics. It's designed to create a negative perspective of his perceived opponent.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech A perfect example, just popped up on my feed on my feed retweeted by seb gorka, a person who wrote a book on propaganda. https://t.co/HkbMVfLBcI
@Apparentropy @bdomenech I'm invested in it. I see ridicule on each side, some deserved, some not. I don't think it was a jump. It was a response to the article that Ben Domenech posted stating liberals have a soft spot for stalinistic propaganda so I believe it was very much on topic.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech It's not based in reality. It abstract bullshit.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech It designed to create a negative impact, It's why campaign commercials are so negative, They focus on what you should dislike about your opponent instead of what you the prospective candidate offers.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech It's just a laugh unless I have a rather large audience and I align myself with others who have similar or larger audiences and we knowingly do the same. That's full scale propaganda.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech Okay. I don't like hypotheticals but here goes: If I post a picture of Hillary and Obama and put wording on it that says something like "Enjoy your time in jail" or "Criminals" whether I hold that sentiment or not I've just created propaganda. No big deal right?
@Apparentropy @bdomenech exists*
@Apparentropy @bdomenech visual propaganda. It's clickbait and it's my big beef with google and youtube. Their happy to apply this system and they're response has just been well it exist, what's misinformation as long as we generate revenue. Twitter follows pretty much the same guidelines.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech I didn't feel it was unnecessary. I communicated my disagreement. It wasn't cursory, while I don't like it I didn't say anything derogatory about them. My impression is that people who hold large audiences because of their political stances should make an effort to not endorse
@Apparentropy @bdomenech +have
@Apparentropy @bdomenech matter they are currently pushing. There's another guy, If I remember I write it. To be fair scott dworkin does that shit too. I recently started unfollowing people because of it that's why I'm aware of it. It the very essence of stalinistic propaganda.
@Apparentropy @bdomenech Seb gorka, David Clarke, Fox News (pretty much most of the part time people they have on as guests) It's not just more pictures, it's pictures that little or no relevance to a subject and are then used to convey a positive or negative (this most of the time) on whatever subject
@bdomenech Even the article you push proposes a hypothetical of imagine and continues into Nazi professors at universities.
@bdomenech From what I see modern conservatives with larger than average audiences use visual propaganda meaning pictures that are tied into non objective narratives that are not based in verifiable facts than I see liberals with the equal or larger audiences.
@chuckwoolery @BFT_Podcast From the article: Under current SNAP guidelines, Americans are free to spend their benefits on food items of their choice.    &lt;This is factually incorrect.

@TrinaNchains @larryelder @RepJoeKennedy It's through a portrayal of victimization that they act with aggression. There is recognizing true inequality and victimhood and there's portrayal of it through the idea of marginalization because they won't accept the idea true equality
@TrinaNchains @larryelder @RepJoeKennedy I'm agreeing with you. Our country is not for one race or language to hold prominence. People who believe this our currently being giving venues and platforms to propagate this.

@TrinaNchains @larryelder @RepJoeKennedy I was defending the ideal that our language is that of a Government we fought a war against to free ourselves from so it's a conluded idea that our standard is maintain the language of oppressors we fought.
@TrinaNchains @larryelder @RepJoeKennedy And my intial response is to question that inferred that English should take a precendent over speaking Spanish and if you don't speak English your not and should not live in America. As I explained our verison of English is a evolution of Traditional British English
@TrinaNchains @larryelder @RepJoeKennedy I don't agree with what you say but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.
@TrinaNchains @larryelder @RepJoeKennedy We come from all countries and now we are American.
@TrinaNchains @larryelder @RepJoeKennedy don't seen to distinquish that our language is an evolution of an oppressive government we removed. That to is an interesting take on our national pride. Your American so you can speak American because America is no longer an extension of England.
@TrinaNchains @larryelder @RepJoeKennedy Well our forefather occupants were british. We developed our own version over time. We call it English after we freed ourselves from at the time was a Monarchy and oppressive government. The people who agree with this sediment and call themselves American

@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks He however did not volunteer he was in communication with jr. I honestly don't know what his end game was in that. It couldv'e been sincerely attempting something or he couldv'e been trolling. In the end it was not transparent.
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks -can +can't
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks as strictly just information with no outside influence or context. Look at pundits, they take information and communicate with a bias trying to portay that you should have their opinion.
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks It doesn't matter why they exist. That a personal issue for him to deal with. You can craft something to be objectively transparent if your steering it with personal bias. Information is information. To be objectively transparent it has to be communicated
@ShaunKing You also have Paul Nehlen, a portayor of white victimization who thinks complying a list of jews who insult him isn't an act of bigotry or racism running for office. Dangerous times.
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks That's my perspective.
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks And to me he seemed to side step a dislike for trump because of a greater bias of those 3 for some time (since I followed him and payed attention). To me he eventually showed. To me that's not objective. His reasons are his own so that's his burden to bear.
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks I think he is intelligent. I think he knows how to utilize an asset. Unlikely ones to. Doing what he does and did there will always be a conflict of his ethics and morals. It's not a secret he has a bias against Obama and Hillary. He really doesn't like Mike Pence.
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks you*
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks It would still be selective and that's where an individual's bias would choose what's acceptant as transparent.
@luvNdaisys @JulianAssange @wikileaks I believe he plays small fish big fish, Yopu can't be transparent 100 percent of time when collecting ridiculous amounts of classified data. Which means selective releasing. Maybe hide a sentence long message trying to get 10,000 pages of something.

@RadioFreeTom How do you do that? By standing and applauding or not applauding and being respectful to a chair inhabitated by someone you don't respect? Nah man. You commit to defending the constitution and free speech. Idyllic symbolism doesn't mean shit unless your campaigning.
@RadioFreeTom one stands out of respect for the office, not the officeholder..... If the integrity of that office has been compromised you can't pay it repect by standing for the person compromising it.

@sahilkapur The only way is an increase in production to flood the market which would increase overdose rates or to subsidize health with i don't know something like the affordable care act.
@EPAScottPruitt @EPA Those burdensome regulations prevent devaluation of the land we posses. There's a reason it's valuable and it has nothing to do with american values.
@WalshFreedom That's not a trump criticism, the whole is just dumb.

@seanhannity That's right it wasn't your account but do you have other messages?
@seanhannity You mean julian assange, a man in an equadorian embassy who won't leave because he fears being extradited to the united states sent you a private message and you didn't report it to anyone?
@SenRonJohnson Not the endorsement of legality but having access to medically treat people who are so overcome with addiction they remove themselves from society.
@SenRonJohnson The over prescription of opioids is what builds tolerance to a drug which leads to people selling or trading for a stronger drug. Limitation won't work unless individual addiction is address with something like needle exchange sites.
@SenRonJohnson "Doing so would not only send a strong message about our commitment to cracking down on the drug dealers, gangs and foreign cartels profiting off the illegal drug trade." 	I don't see pharmacuetical companies on this list.

@scotusreporter @WPJohnWagner It appears he's doing a twitch stream.
@RepLeeZeldin @HouseDemocrats @RepAdamSchiff No it's not. The gop strategically built part of their brand around their own memo leaking it to specific pundits to push it. (you'd be naive to think they didn't). The dems crafted one saying their memo is out of context because you can't release the full context.
@DonaldJTrumpJr The rumor is a large portion of it will be redacted because of highly classified information so it will create a specific narrative and allow unverifiable allegations. It should be released in full with no redactions at all.

@davidmweissman conclusion. It directly resulted in hundreds of layoffs. If he said yea I was responsible for than maybe we could have a greater dialogue. Tweeting the hashtag derangement is a form of propaganda intended to divide not seek constructive converstation whether intentional or not.
@davidmweissman It's not derangement, long before he was well known by many Americans he was well know on the east coast and owning the taj mahal. Casinos make a lot of money and you don't claim bankruptcy multiple times unless your paid with it or your doing something shady. That's a logical
@matthewjsinger @jeneps Induction. Absorb your opponents.
@RealJack What do you already know about democrats and the "deep state"? What actual verifiable facts do you possess?
@SenateMajLdr Your pushing bigoted immigration reform while congratulating the very companies that profited from the policies your now fighting against.
@SenateMajLdr It's not denigrating as you put it. It's objective comparison. Your supporting companies as if they didn't purposely absond with vast amounts of our money. When they return with it your thanking them because their coming back with OUR money.
@ItzTheShelbz @larryelder On the day of remembrance for the holocaust these are the words someone who decesended from jews is telling you. Think about that shit.
@ItzTheShelbz @larryelder If I'm ever persecuted by my own country because of my very existence and i leave because of my interest self presevation. I hope wherever i end up has empathy and understanding that our did and should have but okay.
@ItzTheShelbz @larryelder It's wild what people think isn't possible.
@ItzTheShelbz @larryelder Many go to work and pay taxes every day and just try to live honest lives. Many were granted amnesty and permanent status. It not citizenship but it's not illegal. They're may be a day when someone in a uniform shows up and asks us for our papers.
@ItzTheShelbz @larryelder Many escape persecution of goverments that would kill them. Literally kill them. We commited to them giving the refuge because of this. Now were trying to say that's not our burden to carry. Who are we if we don't keep our word?
@larryelder I'm not a liberal. Immigrants founded our modern society. The idea of exclusion is a nationalist view which can only be acheived by segregation and inevitably violence by either side.
@larryelder It did and it does. It's purposeful to use word illegals and exclude the word immigrants. It's an effort to dehumanize human beings.
@larryelder Why is it in your interest to portray all of these people as uneducated bottom feeders who contribute nothing to society? Many reports have shown educated people with families and tax paying jobs being expelled. Their reasons for arrival being totalitarian governments.
@Cargill @wto At its core it worked for cargill, fair trade had nothing to do with it. and cheap imports. I didn't spend years with a usda inspector stamping those boxes because it was american food.

@WalshFreedom Former congressman ladies and gents.
@WalshFreedom You wanna build a wall? Grab some bricks and start walking. Everybody's all talk about that shit. You wanna lock people out, fuck lets lock everybody in. It's quite the different perspective now.
@WalshFreedom Bullshit chip could've been funded months ago. We could and protect people enrolled in daca and it could be ammended into a bipartisan deal. We gave our word in writing to these people reagardless if you like it or not we gave our word to them.
@arizseabee302 @ChadPergram @KnucklDraginSam He got more integrity than any of them. RINO has become a compliment to any rep that's not a complete lemming.
@senorrinhatch Is the border wall connected to the goverment funding bill? If so it's a long shot after one of your boys on fox said the wall needs to come farther north because arizona is mainly hispanic.
@kurteichenwald https://t.co/vpYRBsdJry same same
@HouseGOP @SenateDems Seperate chip into its own bill with nothing attached. Both parties still maintain negotiating leverage with daca and the border. You could also segregate funding the goverment from these and each party would still hold a card.

@Dublin51 @CNNPolitics Okay?
@FoxBusiness @cvpayne @RepSeanDuffy your argument.
@FoxBusiness @cvpayne @RepSeanDuffy If deaths from training equal 81 that shows someone with poor leadership skills not mentally equipped to train others. Statiscally 21 combat deaths in the entire military is statiscally phenomenal. Is this number really accurate? Either way the entire statement works against....
@Dublin51 @CNNPolitics govermemt has broad and unprecedented power and is over reaching and believes that power should be assumed individually by states.

@VP @RepLouBarletta Remember when trump said he'd investigate misappropriated money used by the military? You can blame your own infighting and pockets of resistance within on someone else. This is still America. We the people. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Not one guy and his lackies.
@GovWalker @SpeakerVos @SenatorKapenga Again what specific training programs does what your attempting to implement have without incuring debt? Specifically. Systematic poverty is directly related to right to work incentives if actual career training does not exist.

@TLJ12345 @thegarance He owns, he's responsible for it. His staffing choices are up to him. I don't blame him for the inaction or actions of others. It does not absolve him or make him immune.
@MarkSimoneNY How do you cry and cry that goverment should be transparent and deep state this and that and defend members of goverment because they were in a private meeting? Private being the key word.
@AnneRiceAuthor It's a purge and it won't stop here.
@TLJ12345 @thegarance Your still responsible.
@TLJ12345 @thegarance That doesn't absolve you. The problem still needs to be corrected. As a buisness owner you are responsible for it. If you saw me try to give you a burger off the floor you'd freak out. 200,000 entry fee dollars and they were doing it. You can hire and fire whoever you want.
@TLJ12345 @thegarance Reaponsible*. He can fire whoever he wants within his power. The problem still exists.
@TLJ12345 @thegarance There's a reason we have expiration dates and these types of rules. If you spent time in a room with usda agents you'd understand the significant dangers of contaminated food. That's not an adequate excuse. Your buisness meaning your reaponsible.
@WalshFreedom Not from the left, from reality, when the president is racist you call him a racist. When people defend a racist you call them defenders of rasicm. What do you want to debate?

@JeffHReynolds @FoxNews They won't open it cause they're afraid to cause damage like someones not coming back to say hey your in my house. We're at a time that seems to be stuck inbetween two other times and it's our own doing.
@JeffHReynolds @FoxNews As far as private industry I'm all in as far as protecting earth. As for space i think we should take significantly more risks. We have no idea what most of that world holds. Sort of related but not really they found a hundred foot room in the top of one of the pyramids.
@JeffHReynolds @FoxNews It wasn't a purposeful action, they lost control of it. It orbits the earth. I'm all for laying blame where it belongs but there is no malice behind this.

@PracticalLefty @kcavkel @Newsweek by people who want to reinforce the already existing factual reports. It will backfire without it.
@PracticalLefty @kcavkel @Newsweek Somebodies gotta name the source on this one. If this is recycled in the news without a confirmed source and presented factually as a quote it's just ammunition against the very people reporting it. If unverified it just becomes a narrative
@WillPenn15 @jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump I had to look that word up.  I tried to use fewer words. It was misinterpreted. When i used more you responded with an insult because i used more words. That's how that went. That's the full context.
@mqualizza @Mediaite He was talking about the way social media algorithms endorse a persons own bias. Meaning a conservative will be presented with more conservative news and liberals will absorb more liberal news. All when they type in the same exact keywords.
@jaynordlinger @stephenfhayes That's gotta be illegal.
@jaynordlinger @stephenfhayes Aren't there like laws against this type of shit? I know they're usually smart about it but they classify npr as mainstream media and not themselves even though they're a media company and mainstream. How can you take an excerpt out of a quote and portray it as a full quote?

@GovMikeHuckabee @davidmweissman @POTUS @TomCottonAR @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump It went so far as trump trying to deny saying take them out because it was already too late to deny saying shithole. There's also alleged accounts of lindsey graham responding directly to trump and even paul ryan publicly saying something something unfortunate
@GovMikeHuckabee @davidmweissman @POTUS @TomCottonAR @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump follow suit
@GovMikeHuckabee @davidmweissman @POTUS @TomCottonAR @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump My assumption is blind loyalty. Every person who publicly hurt trump whether intentional or not has been disavowed and targeted. It's always something to behold watching Republicans whine about the freedom of individuality and call other's rinos if they don't fall in line and
@AnneRiceAuthor Subliminal recognition to millions of people. Imagine that without even meaning to.
@AnneRiceAuthor They wouldn't even address it if they didn't feel threatened by the premise. Not the lack of government experience but the actual fear that she could win. She was present everyday in millions of people's homes for the biggest age demographic of voters.
@SheriffClarke @FoxNews That's what he said comparing the divide of information that social media feeds you based on your engagements.
@SheriffClarke @FoxNews "If you watch Fox News, you are living on a different planet than you are if you are listening to NPR.”
@SheriffClarke @FoxNews It's misleading, disinformation, and fake news.
@SheriffClarke @FoxNews He was making a comprison on how social media has led to a divide in information and how algorithms reinforce an individual's existing bias saying russia utilized the same tool but it existed before that. Purposely resond out of context and pretend to be angry.
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Keep trying to propagate him as the every man. It worked the first round. After this shit though everyone's starting to get that most of us are already byproducts of oppression. That's how we got here. You need to up your game son.
@WillPenn15 @jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump It was a euphemism. He's a puppet now. They have a clear initiative. Blind loyalty at all costs. It's a bit humorous to watch them act with hubris and see them as minions who hold no actual value.
@joanwalsh @CurtisHouck @RichLowry It's a poor attempt at damage control. They lack ammunition and it's too late to issue a denial.
@larryelder You seem to be cofusing racism with racism. Can't say the source it originates or materilizes from doesn't matter. Kinda does matter though that you'll attempt to condemn one source and not another.
@jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump You went from chair of the oversight committee to selling out. You'll fall on the sword before he will.
@stev1ejanowsk1 @Thom_Hartmann So it's an incomplete pay study. I agree they didn't factor in relevant info. There remains a host of other controlled studies. Googled it. Pew research. Standford. Why is 35 considered full time? Never in my life have I known it to be that way. Regardless of gender.
@stev1ejanowsk1 @Thom_Hartmann The analysis is a comparison of people who hold the same job title and work roughly the same amount of hours. As far as I'm aware those are the focus of those studies with no other outside factors. So the disparity is correct.

@stev1ejanowsk1 @Thom_Hartmann Information is always power. He gets a lot of it. Even if removed from office it won't be like tou think. Smaller gov. with the burden of national security on federal powers can't exist. It's a conflict. So republican officials press both sides.
@realDonaldTrump What?
@stev1ejanowsk1 @Thom_Hartmann I'm completely disagree with wage gap. Our system completely relies on people entrenched in poverty. Nearly every program we have is designed to indebt. Even the fed. Having debt makes it more useful to simply exist than to not.
@stev1ejanowsk1 @Thom_Hartmann I had no idea what color shaun king was. I know he posted the daniel shaver video.
@stev1ejanowsk1 @Thom_Hartmann We win wars with allies. We can pretend that we're untouchable but that pride can only be carried because we have them.
@stev1ejanowsk1 @Thom_Hartmann I think it is a big deal. Not by itself but in the entire context. This guy has access to far too much sensitive information to think that alienating an ally won't be used as a conduit for America's enemies.

@benshapiro Even more interesting is Christian indoctrination of african refugees has always been prevalent to american immigrantion.
@benshapiro It's not bigoted garbage. If he did say why are they here? take them and then said we should welcome immigrants from norway it's about the people who inhabit the land occupied. So it's about people.

@RealJack Iran is about to erupt in another proxy. Hamas. Oh man brilliant insulting our allies who have no obligation to stand with us in any confrontational war or share information or resources.
@RealJack Not by itself. When aligned with other comments and actions it fits well into that category. Russia is far from dead. Not every issue. Ask assad. That right russia still backs him in a proxy. North Korea is still on the dial. We've condemned pakistan.

@PeggyCiavardone @FoxNews @deneenborelli They are corporate media. It's a show run by oligarchs on all platforms across all media. The difference is fact which is the basis of all integrity driven journalism and suggestion which is not fact, it's a perspective that misrepresents facts.
@PeggyCiavardone @FoxNews @deneenborelli If fox taunts the have higher viewership of the public and their media they are in every way possible main stream media or msm. The concept of portraying yourself as the underdog who doesn't get a fair shake is not a new concept.
@SethAbramson I was reading about it and came across that it's not a dossier at all, it was a report still in the stages of fact finding and that dossiers are completed reports written after verification of the details.
@senorrinhatch https://t.co/63VD363ffP And some don't. What's a thousand dollars compared to a yearly salary?
@PeggyCiavardone @FoxNews @deneenborelli It's pretty subversive, every day fox has hosts pitch the idea of discrediting and firing him and then takes the stance it was never their idea to begin with. This is this essence of propaganda and political weaponry of a major media outlet.
@SebGorka Does your assessment disallow negatives on other presidents or only comparison of positive growths?
@TuckerCarlson All cloaked in conservatism.

@SenFeinstein They see your empathy as a weakness and will attempt to a a capitalize on it with aggressive negotiation in their favor. Their perception with be they can and will endure struggling of the masses for the greater good. As long as that suffering doesn't directly apply to them.
@SenateMajLdr But you curtailed the deductions of city and state tax. So the lower taxes are offset in higher taxed cities and states. So what are your views on higher taxed cities and states?
@daveseibert @shahanLA @funder Well it's getting a little better. Things have definitely become more transparent. I wouldn't say it's been deliberately welcome by those in power on either side. Still don't know how i feel about net neutrality situation. It could create a divide of information.Don't really know
@daveseibert @shahanLA @funder I would but you can't talk compromise to 2 parties of autocrats. They have already chosen their champions.
@JohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump It's a pretty weird statement coming from someone who ran the CIA.
@davidmweissman @PressSec @TeedGirlFromMA cuts.
@davidmweissman @PressSec @TeedGirlFromMA Mathematical analytics prove after a certain number of years these tax cut run out except for the incredibly wealthy.
@davidmweissman @PressSec @TeedGirlFromMA I also don't like the correlation to chip since it is currently not funded and at an odd time considering McConnell made an announcement it should be funded but has made no effort to implement it.
@davidmweissman @PressSec @TeedGirlFromMA Pricing and it's not addressed.
@davidmweissman @PressSec @TeedGirlFromMA I'm not a democrat but here's some issues I see: the estate tax is removed, i think it should be in effect after a certain amount of acreage. The corporate rate doesn't do anything for offshore accounts since those accounts pay close to or zero tax. That's known as transfer

@GalaGalaIsland @RT_com @GovJVentura @neiltyson The most common theme is nuclear presence. Artificial create heat and light (bombs.) is a sign of war which is a sign of life.
@GalaGalaIsland @RT_com @GovJVentura @neiltyson Not if you can bend the physical universe as was is the einstein rosen bridge theory. We know of the speed of light but not how many actual types of light there are as in denser or lighter. I watch a lot of alien stuff, it's interesting.
@MIGOP @DonaldJTrumpJr Name one person who wrote one line in that bill that makes less than 100k a year or has less than 200k in their bank account.
@brianschatz I honestly believe that elected officials should receive minimum wage. It's become something else watching everyone of these people say their providing a public service. That includes you. It's not a bias sentiment.
@SenDeanHeller @POTUS Slow sustainable growth and not aggressive expansion that has a significantly higher chance of collapsing actually used to be a republican ideal.
@ChrChristensen I have a hole puncher. 😏
@20committee What is fee fees? I don't know what that means.
@nowthisnews That's fucking crazy. He doesn't even deny that he'll act on behalf of a private company while serving in public office.
@ChitownBoltsFan @20committee And they him.
@ChitownBoltsFan @20committee He let his ego take over and took refuge behind people who would defend him as long as they could use him as a catalyst for their own gain. These people never took him seriously until he could benefit them.
@ChitownBoltsFan @20committee I think trump had good intentions for people when he entered office and didn't realize how quickly he would be criticized and not praised as a public official and not a private citizen. It blindsided him.
@TomiLahren Fox employed you because you cause controversy and division. Imagine in this republic that everything goes the way republicans want uncontested and peace reigns fox cannot survive. That is your legacy.
@KurtSchlichter What makes it self destructive?
@JohnCornyn So it's not true or it's true and your calling it fake news to discredit verifiable facts?
@mckaycoppins @blakehounshell What ufo story? Provide a link.
@SenatorEnzi I think you should amend the bill to cap the death tax so it's still effective after a certain amount of acreage.
@KenCalvert That's not true the same amount of money exists in a person's paycheck regardless of taxation. You could say you will be taxed less but that's not necessarily true because of the elimination of certain deductions. So you either chose the wrong wording or your lying.
@larryelder @RepAdamSchiff We can keep the same facts with the same name and their still facts. Your saying "collusion" exists now with trump with this statement.
@RepDennisRoss Math isn't a filter.
@RepTedYoho No you just tell us.
@UNLCE_BOB @JulianAssange I'm not questioning*
@UNLCE_BOB @JulianAssange Okay but say there was an electrical attack and networks on the ground were indeed inaccessible how do people access their currency? I'm questioning if the data will be erased just physical access.
@Unfrozn_Caveman @NPR Instead of actually addressing the standards of a good education you throw names in a hat.
@Unfrozn_Caveman @NPR It's true. The issue is charter schools are a lottery, that's their entire premise. When the first started growing the whole campaign was to ensure kids in lower income and notably bad education districts had a fair shot to attend a better school.
@CollinRugg @DonaldJTrumpJr I've never heard anyone say that.
@tribelaw Here's what I don't get, how can you advance a bill to grow the economy while providing a tax deduction for having below a specific amount of employees? It should be the opposite no?
@tribelaw IBT first reported on the tax carve-out, which allows investors in “pass-through” entities, including real-estate partnerships such as LLCs and LPs, with few employees to deduct part of their income that passes through those partnerships.
@DonaldJTrumpJr A general lied to the fbi. You had private contact with wikileaks prior to the election about hacked emails and just about all major social media sites confirmed that thousands of bots (possibly russian) posted political propaganda. It's bananas alright.
@SenBobCasey Their gonna use it as leverage. There is no high road with these people. When they gather behind closed doors and don't allow any one else in, your in the swamp. They are greedy and dirty and will use children's health as a weapon.
@WalshFreedom What do you mean by earn? Can you specify specifics of what that word means to you?
@FoxNews @Scaramucci @foxandfriends You have no proof it raises wages.

@geogeo419 @JasonMillerinDC I don't know if this is directed at me in abstract or not. I'm not on the left or right. I stand in reality. I'm not defending or questioning the validity of the story. I believe it. Your comment was the about the action of a group you oppose instead of the
@JasonMillerinDC It will be by fox later on. The only issue is they'll cherry pick legitimate stories from what they claim is fake news so attention won't be on the actual story. It will just be a continual fight over the credibility of the right and the left.
@JohnCornyn How does this bill correlate with higher wages?
@GovWalker What training? What certification? Welding certification? Is that what the video implies? You say training and have added nothing other than the same lines. What training will be provided?
@SebGorka That's not even a full time hours at a regular job. Unprecedented. The fuck outta here. Least this guy has a resume.
@SebGorka You quote hilarious articles. Senate Democrats, who have attempted filibusters of almost two-dozen judicial nominees this year, and consumed up to 30 hours of floor debate time per nominee.
@tomborelli @seanhannity As long as everything is based on verifiable facts i see no issue with it a person's personal political views as long as they are seperated from discovering of facts. I've also stated before i have no issue with investigating the dnc, that's not my decision.
@tomborelli @seanhannity Okay but that particular corp encompass' one of the largest news organizations in the world so when their affiliated pundits condemns one investigation against a party and endorses another for a different party the same argument applies. Political bias.
@Noneya03052393 @TomFitton @JudicialWatch These people who tell you to defend him thought he was a joke at the beginning and only leeched on when they thought they could use him and they are and they're using hate against others to keep blinders on him.
@Noneya03052393 @TomFitton @JudicialWatch Their all after each other. They are attempting to manipulate everybody. Both sides. I really wish a lot more people knew of trumps character before he was on the apprentice. He plays the role of boss. He is not anyone's boss.
@tomborelli @seanhannity @FoxNews From 2010: Fox News' objectivity was called into question by the DNC on Tuesday after it was reported that the cable network's parent company – News Corporation – recently donated $1 million to the Republican Governors Association. It goes both ways.

@CBSPhilly To circumvent food borne illness.
@CBSPhilly It doesn't exactly work like that. If a package is open or comes in to contact with a listed unsanitary item it gets discarded. A lot of it gets turned into pet food. This is well before it hits the store. There's a lot of waste but also a preventive method
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch We get it your buff. Your shirt is dying in agony.
@funder Where is your actual proof of what that paper says?
@chuckwoolery Nice click bait. They argued they were present and did not take part in any violent act or act of vandalism. But you know innocent until your standing amongst those who i politically disagree with.
@SpeakerRyan @SenDanSullivan @repdonyoung @NatResources We could vote to significantly cut the salary of elected officials in the federal government. That'd save some money.
@Nik_Farr @Kasparov63 Win to what or whom?
@GrayConnolly @SebGorka You retweeted the opinion wikileaks is a russian cut out and align them with criminality and treason and you haven't said a word about jr's. communication with them in a negative light. Reminder he only unveiled those dm's after someone else found out.
@Kasparov63 Lose what?
@SenMikeLee You didn't mention any actual solution to what your saying. You just said you think there's some things.
@JulianAssange What happens if there's some sort of emp attack. How do owners of it get access? It's probably the biggest threat against it.
@dbongino I keep seeing this. People whining that democrats are whining because a democrat got elected.
@Harlan How old are you? I'm genuinely curious.
@Istillwantapony @DLind @UNITEDWEDREAM According to the Trump administration, he’s supposed to wait to be invited to reapply by US Citizenship and Immigration Services. What was the traffic stop? Citation or ticket for what?
@MooreSenate in his autobiography he recalls sleeping on sandbags to avoid a grenade or bomb being tossed under his cot, as many of his men had threatened him with fragging.
@joncoopertweets When you say things like that you will lose. You should focus on what good can be done not what arch nemesis of yours will be defeated. Regular people don't care about your agenda to upend someone else.
@TomiLahren Doesn't mean he has the same piece of paper as me so he's my guy.
@TomiLahren Well in your previous article you didn't mention doug jones at all. Moore stated he's against the idea that voters get to pick their elected officials over state legislatures. He said that. As a republican you should do what's good for the citizens. Repulican
@thewzedd @JulianAssange The truth hurts whoever opposes it. It doesn't discriminate.

@Yancy_USAF_Ret @Cranberryloon @trish_regan @POTUS @SebGorka Should report suspicious behavior. So what's suspicious behavior that falls into the term politically correct?
@Yancy_USAF_Ret @Cranberryloon @trish_regan @POTUS @SebGorka The only way I could comprehend what he was saying was to interpret it. It appears he's saying you should have racist inclinations and that will somehow save your life. That how i took it. Maybe I'm wrong but in the context of political correctness he says you

@FoxNews @PatToomey Even the guy on fox news interviewing you looks confused as you explain the situation of people who have over a million dollars when asking about taxation on higher tax paying states and how they'll pay more taxes. Your a bum.

@FoxNews @Varneyco Jobs created or already existed or seasonal?
@davidmweissman @IngrahamAngle Obama was never president of israel.
@davidmweissman @IngrahamAngle That's nonsense. Obama was the President of the United States. If you want Israel to be known globally across all platforms as a sovereign nation than it has to be perceived as one by making its own independent decisions.
@billtz @Dcdave11 @PCsucks66 @BlakeFleming85 @lopez1b1 @CocoaMonoi @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I wouldn't object to it. Your hate is being fueled by people who are telling you to hate. These are just large groups of people. All of them on all sides. They are not selected to be superior.
@TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews https://t.co/RRVH4M8CzW You should address this or at least have the news division do so.
@rosehipuk @RitaPanahi The judge didn't allow the video.
@billtz @Dcdave11 @PCsucks66 @BlakeFleming85 @lopez1b1 @CocoaMonoi @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews https://t.co/RRVH4M8CzW I feel this should get more attention at the moment. Whatever your stance politically it really doesn't matter unless you have empathy for the life of others.
@realDonaldTrump @SecretaryAcosta @USDOL https://t.co/RRVH4M8CzW This happened in the country your the President of. I'm not placing blame but it warrants your official response.
@NamelessEnemy @CBSNews Only a person conducting an offensive assault would take such an agressive stance.
@NamelessEnemy @CBSNews I watched the entire video. It was erie that he said "just like before" at the begining. They also try to access a room that had keycard access and had trouble accessing it. The problem is he was standing directly in front of the locked door.
@NamelessEnemy @CBSNews He did not check his body for weapons, he did not check his pulse. There was nothing remotely qualifying that any professional in law enforcement or military would have done.
@NamelessEnemy @CBSNews Lay on the ground and cross your legs. Then lift  yourself up to the kneeling position with your hands in far as front off you as you can while maintaining good balance. It's incredibly difficult. If you watch the actual video.....
@SheriffClarke ""free speech" (lol)". 	-David A. Clarke, Jr.-
This guy needs to be in jail. Why did the judge not allow the video? The judge needs to be in court as a defendant. https://t.co/RRVH4M8CzW
@JulianAssange I have a question. Was the information released by wikileaks purposely withheld until a particular time or is it released immediately to the public?	That's what bugs me the most. The timing seems so convenient for it to be coincidental.
@sarahcwestwood @DonaldJTrumpJr Wikileaks requested he post a link to the hacked documents. He posted a link to the hacked documents. Both admit to this. It does not excuse his actions.
@sarahcwestwood @DonaldJTrumpJr A 2016 email sent to President Trump and top aides pointed the campaign to hacked documents from the Democratic National Committee that had already been made public by the group WikiLeaks a day earlier. What action did Trump Jr. take?
@FoxNewsOpinion @GreggJarrett Let's not call that ruining their lives,
@FoxNewsOpinion @GreggJarrett Has anything he's done in the investigation not been supported by facts discovered. Also about merril lynch: Thain accelerated approximately $4 billion in bonus payment to employees at Merrill just prior to the close of the deal with Bank of America.
@turquoisebolo @SheriffClarke It's a good question. I'd prefer the law that currently exists be enforced. I think that would be a fair start. I think it's an abysmal defense by the businesses that aren't actually complying with the existing law.
@turquoisebolo @SheriffClarke +is
@turquoisebolo @SheriffClarke A lot of them already don't comply with the existing law. Most liquor stores here don't have glass barricades. Clarke is a fear monger, he seeks no solution to actually addressing crime. He portraying that fear is the solution in this case.
@SheriffClarke Your full of it.
@SheriffClarke Nah. If you read the ordinance it only applies to shops that sell alcohol. These shops are supposed to accommodate 30 seats that patrons can occupy. There's so many that have no seats at all but still sell it, in these "crime plagued neighborhoods."
@FoxNews Did you photoshop the pencil out of his ear?
@CocoaMonoi @lopez1b1 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews reporters*
@CocoaMonoi @lopez1b1 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I fully admit I'm bias against them, their reporter are really good in my opinion. They report news with no bias but I believe their pundits are purely sychophants where growing their audience through division and incitement is their primary objective.
@CocoaMonoi @lopez1b1 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews act dismissive, hence the term "fake news" a fox favorite. They don't encourage the accused go to court to defend themselves, an Americasn right as they say. It's more important to just have the other side be perceived as having a lack of credibility.
@CocoaMonoi @lopez1b1 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Srry that last message was a response to someone else. Most of them as far as I can tell have multiple accusers and are I don't know a better word at this instance, the issue is to me is that The accused won't go to court but have opposing poltical media
@lopez1b1 @CocoaMonoi @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews There was tons of outrage from republicans just like now there's tons of outrage from liberals. For just an instant think to yourself what have these people, the actual people done for your well being, you as a singular person not a group. On either side.
@CocoaMonoi @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews It's crazy, it's also crazy that these people elected to office can catergorize themselves as wealthy by the end of their first term. We also pay their transportation and housing when their on buiseness.
@CocoaMonoi @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews to fight their accuser. All these people saying this is our system, these our our courts, we believe in the American way and American law and they have full access to use them but they shy away when confronted with the very possibilty of it.
@CocoaMonoi @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews You get due process in court. What tucker isn't disclosing is their right to file a defamation suit, and an impartial jury can decide what is the truth. The statue of limitations has expired for most of them, in my opinion an honest person would be in court.
@GovWalker @MadisonCollege @CiscoNetAcad An attendee under 25 with their own residence is in their admission calculator $17,869.

@President1Trump @USAgaggy63 @jaketapper I don't understand where the "spin is". I couldn't comprehend the statement without the knowing the context of soros' religion. Can someone explain what spin or why he would make that statement?
@renato_mariotti Dowd argued that the president’s oversight of law enforcement makes it impossible for anyone in the office to obstruct it in the first place.		I just find it amazing that was his defense.
@dbongino subtracting the taxes. I don't understand.
@dbongino What are net taxes? All I found was net of taxes when I looked it up. Net of tax is an accounting figure that has been adjusted for the effects of income tax. Net of tax is most commonly calculated by taking gross figures, like the cash collected from the sale of an asset, and

@MEPFuller You should eat a triple baconator from wendys, it'll make your hands look tiny, it's also delicious. I haven't known of anyone who thinks a big mac is a giant sandwich....until now.
@MattWalshBlog I've seen nothing in this bill that address' any notion of addressing poverty except for the forced projection that already abundantly wealthy and  successful people will will create more jobs and they will have some unknown desire to pay higher wages.
@MattWalshBlog First please define your interpretation of what poor is. Second taxes are a collective fund that contains mostly everybodies money to benifit mostly everbody (ideally). Third the cost of higher education in this country is in my own opinion abysmal and outrageous.
@FoxNews @dbongino @foxandfriends Equating a General lying to the FBI to jaywalking. The agent was removed to maintain credibility of the investigation. A grown man using the word fibbing. This is what you push.
@RepLouBarletta To 7 percent
@RepLouBarletta I do think about it and I wonder where all the money from this goes. Effective August 1, 2016, the state tax rate is $2.60 per pack of 20 cigarettes or little cigars ($0.13 per stick), or $26 per carton of 10 packs. Additionally, the cost of the retailer was changed from 6
@karatem8 @JulianAssange It's not journalism to request someone to post a link to hacked documents of political opponents and provide that that person with that link.
@TylerDurden6996 @JulianAssange I could have. I looked at your profile. I knew you would insult me. You did.  You labeled me as something, I responded I wasn't, you insulted me again. I follow a lot of news sources yes.
@TylerDurden6996 @JulianAssange Your welcome to investigate it regardless of any bias you have.
@TylerDurden6996 @JulianAssange I absorb information from multible sources regardless of bias which does exist as it does for every person. I'm not crying nor do I intend to. My chance at proving a a statement I made that is factually true is absolutely proveable.
@TylerDurden6996 @JulianAssange You could have done the same in less time, you chose instead to insult because obvious troll is obvious
@TylerDurden6996 @JulianAssange I'm, not a liberal. I have no loyalty or alliance to large pools of people I don't know.
@TylerDurden6996 @JulianAssange This is your statement. "Liberalism is the greatest threat to security, safety and prosperity. Twitter and libtards think I’m a bot. Poor delusional idiots." &lt;&lt;this isn't the statement of someone who is unintelligent.
@TylerDurden6996 @JulianAssange obvious troll is obvious
@JulianAssange Jr. posted that link at the request of a foreign agent. It's not a warped lense, it happened. All this it's because of this or that is irrelevant. This happened. It is a fact.
@SheriffClarke and the nonsense that “women are paid less for the same work”),  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;from the article YOU posted. It is statiscally true.
@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller I'm in favor of the same favor of the same. I just knew it as basic income.
@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller And there's the issue. The perception that another human is an expendable liability and not a necessary asset for success. It's an us vs. them mentality instead of we have to help each other.

@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller I go to work everyday I'm scheduled as do millions of Americans. That's millions. Many of them are in poverty. How do millions of adults go to work full time and live in poverty? Explain the lack of motivation they have when they show up and work.
@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller with it's contrast to the actual cost of bulk and wholesale food providers.
@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller I'm a temp at Union based job with the potential to make up to 25/hr upon hiring. In the food/manufacturing/warehousing/production/transportation industry which I've worked in for over 10 years. Your confusing the willingness to see a minimal profit loss
@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller This will deplete your accesible time to obtain those skills and you'll accumulate larger wages (not by much) which can cut off your assistance hence systematic poverty. Maybe we should change our expectations.
@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller There's skill to all work, If someone can do it better than another it's a skill. Systematic poverty exists. Icurring debt to obtain more viable skills is our current system. You have to work a lot of overtime or receive assistance on a minimum wage salary.
@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller Most of those adults working there fall below the poverty line.
@westcovinajoe @MEPFuller A large amount of  adult work in retail and fast food. Walmart used to hold classes to explain to their full time workers how to apply for government assistance. You take the oppurtunities presented to you. You should be more observant when you visit a store.
@1infamous9 @NJD_MattConlon @CNN There are clear terms that freedom of speech applies to those who only use it without attempting to use it to negatively physically impact the life of someone else. It's not a double standard, It's the standard.
@1infamous9 @NJD_MattConlon @CNN the intent to and acted on the intent to do so.
@1infamous9 @NJD_MattConlon @CNN Your absolutely allowed to be offensive unless you have the clear intent to do physical harm or impact another person negatively. This is why we have an entire judicial system. To determine the extent of what harm someone has caused or if they had
@1infamous9 @SilviaxLej @NJD_MattConlon @CNN No. If I interpret along with a majority of others that the sound coming from someone is a physical threat against me or another and allow it to eventually  manifest physically with no negative interaction, then we've arrived at absolute anarchy.
@1infamous9 @NJD_MattConlon @CNN That's an accurate interpretation. An incredible weak defense to what free speech is in the constitution. There are laws against facilitating words or "speech" in certain ways such as inciting violence and threating others.
@kriskambona @AJEnglish @Citizen_Alert1 @NAkufoAddo It'd be far too much of a risk. Ghana is one of, if not the most stable and secure economy in Africa.
@PiperSul @FoxNews @GDouglasJones @MooreSenate They'll always cherrypick any source as long as it suits them. Only  when it's a stance they oppose it's fake news.
@GovChristie @POTUS I don't disagree but it's bullshit that the guy who was the Governer of N.J. speaks on the problem when I can drive over the bridge to camden and buy any drug of choice with no effort what so ever.
@1infamous9 @NJD_MattConlon @CNN You can't threaten someone man. That's illegal.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC No. I didn't say that. I said he posted the link at their request. He was in contact and acted on the behalf of a foreign agent and declared enemy.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC about russian interfernce to be clear.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC That's also true and the DM's confirm exactly what I said. He posted a link to hacked emails (which need a password) at the request of WikiLeaks. A declared enemy. Assange has attested to this. They are considered foreign agents. I never once said anything
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC That's true and jr. posted the link after they contacted him asking if Trump would post the link. Trump did not. He did.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC Actually he did when he posted a link directly to the emails. This is not some offbrand conspiracy. It happened in real time.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC He was given and used that password.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC I never said russia hacked the files and I also believe they were obtained by someone working with their campaign. The fact remains the emails were obtained by wikileaks and posted by jr. at their request. The files needed a password to be accessed.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC Meaning they were given a password by a declared enemy to access goverment related files. That's illegal.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC I've looked it up. The AG said he won't open an investigation. I don't control that. He actually is not considering that wiki and assange are declared enemies (I've stated before I'm not in favor of this). The hacked emails required a password.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC -the
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC for the actions of the DNC. Criminality is exclusive to those who commit or conspire to commit the a (the) crime.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka @DNC Jr. tweeted the DM exchange. The exchange requested the posting of the link. 2 days later the link was tweeted. The Clinto DNC isn't responsible of the actions of people their not involved with just as the the Tump administration isn't responsible
@hmbr123 @SebGorka remaining in power because he fears the installation of VP Pence would be a conduit for stances he opposes. I try to obtain info from all places and sides.
@hmbr123 @SebGorka We learned an advisor to the president (jr.) was persuaded by a foreign agent (Assange) to post a link to hacked emails. We learned through Trump's admission he fired a General for lying to the FBI. Personal opinion: Assange is more interested in trump
@SheriffClarke quote*
@SheriffClarke Your all over the place with this.
@SheriffClarke So what is your proposed solution? All I see is blame. You qoute george bush who helped create "No Child Left Behind". A statisical measuring device in education. You also seem to be advocating for children to remain unfed when they arrive at school.
@SebGorka Why is it a farce? Please use the existing law and not a comparison to something else to explain.

@FoxNews @SheriffClarke I just read a bunch of wiki stuff on clark cause don't really know who he is, yo you are a piece of shit bro.
@SenJeffMerkley I want every senator in  favor of a bill to have to read it out loud word for word on national television one by one. It'd be a good law. Also had no idea senators made 170k a year. I feel a paycut to 74,999.99 would be appropriate.
@TuckerCarlson supposed to handle this type of shit?
@TuckerCarlson Tom Homan how don't you alreasy know that sancutary cities aren't going to comply with your request. He definitely would have to know that. So he comes on fox to stress how upset he is with his own shortsightedness? As the director of the agency thats
@TuckerCarlson Where were any ICE agents when this guy was released. Tom Homan was associate direcrtor of it in 2013 and he's now the director so how is it that a guy came into the country illegally at least five time served a bunch of years in jail was just let go. If your
@FoxNews I don't understand the quote. It seems to imply national security needs which are funded by taxes would fare better if taxes were cut? Personally not against a better tax system but what a terrible out of context (or not) quote to use.
@clairecmc Eliminate cash or gift cards as employee achievement awards? I get there should be a cap but that's fucking ridiculous.
@FoxNews @seanhannity You are a millionaire, even if you really do have any empathy your every day life is completely disconnected from the reality of the normal working people which is the majority of the population.
@mattyglesias Those were their exact words, how come everytime someone claims to be told something by some they oppose they don't speak like normal people?
@MEPFuller Somebody broke into my car, they stole a case of ramen out of the trunk, I had actual money in it and a case of water, they didn't even take one bottle, just saying.
@charliekirk11 Oh yea i fucking believe you. I'm just saying man. I believe you.
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I assume because most major cities are "democratic" with larger populations so having a larger pool of workers creates a surplus of employee availability allowing employers to pay lower wages while allowing them to thrive with high turnover rates.
@IngrahamAngle @va_shiva It's not racist until you use people of a specific heritage as a catalyst to mock someone by using that heritage as an insult. Was Pocahontas even navajo? You'll have to look it up to find out, guaranteed. So yeah, it was a really racist gesture.
@Justin_Vogt @dandrezner You can't attack them head on. Their happy to have enemies as long as it enlarges their audience. The larger the audience gained over whatever subject, the more they'll present that subject to attract an audience. It's the entire model of their existence.
@JasonMillerinDC Kicked you are? What?
@DavidAFrench Its pretty good. You might zone out but the action scenes are pretty badass. I didn't like daredevil at all.
@JamesOKeefeIII @washingtonpost You gimme your funding I'm gonna produce something substantial. Your video, journalistic skills, and undercover work are trash. Someone wasted their money. Also your a scum bag.
@JulianAssange Attacked their commercial opponents.
@JulianAssange I was just looking up old stories and opinions out of curiosity about you and wikileaks and its really hard believing there's no bias motivation involved when you seem to be deliberately side stepping fox news even though they had a really hard stance against you until you
@Larrypolya22 @SebGorka Hear*
@Larrypolya22 @SebGorka With each other? They spread disinformation. It's the counter of actual intelligence.
@Larrypolya22 @SebGorka You really think when he left they sat amongst themselves complimenting him after he took an aggressive stance against an alliance that was beneficial for them? As far as seb, he regurgitates whatever agenda he's told to. Where do you here any fox pundits actually disagree&gt;&gt;
@DebbieOsterhoud @Reuters @ReutersTV To this day I don't understand why they don't have credit score curriculum in k-12 and why trade schools aren't free. It's a sad joke how easy it would be to alleviate systemic poverty by teaching real world skills.
@Reuters @ReutersTV Coal*
@Reuters @ReutersTV They based that whole idea on coal miners wanted to actually mine goal instead of the larger picture that they just wanted decent wages regardless of the career.
@MichaelaNewell_ @Reuters It's what you do to remove monarchs peacefully.
@lena_ponies @AJEnglish What i took away from one article was they changed a law so politicians could curse (like curse words) and the. they changed it back. &lt;&lt;after that protesters showed demanding a specific guy resign (not sure who) because of it.  If I'm wrong correct me that's what i got from it.
@comcast https://t.co/NnaYyRcwLF
@astroehlein The US government’s misguided decision to request for RT to register under FARA gave the Kremlin a platform to retaliate. Why wasn't this considered when you made the headline?
@laseptiemewilay @JoyAnnReid @cnni Putin did that in retaliation for America making journalists of foreign media outlets register. Most notably rt. In a senate or congress hearing a member says about rt. "Well their not republican and their not anti-democrat". It's pretty ludicrous.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Man you are a little weasel.
@JYSexton Its obvious sarcasm.
@greta I delivered menus for a pizza place when i was ten. 5 bux an hour. Consider if your ever in a tough spot. Pro tip:  Do it for five different places at the same time. 25 bux an hour.
@SheriffClarke @FoxNews How is it counter culture to recognize the struggles other cultures have endured? Early american settlers committed genocide against the indigenous people. Not matter what your opinion, it's historical fact.
@realDonaldTrump Please. NFL still airs on fox. I've been thinking you either are truly invested in your own bullshit or you don't actually care about any statements you make. So the options are your fucking crazy or your fucking crazy.
@chrislhayes I got more experience driving a forklift than this guy does being a judge and I'm younger than him. It ain't right.
@CantedQuips @JacobAWohl He did unapologetically advocate for the physical well being of all American citizens by changing health care to include the inability for insurer's to deny treatment for preexisting injuries.
@RonPaul It's a damn good question.
@SpeakerRyan It really is, how about a bill increasing minimum wage to address this?
@yomamasfavson @benshapiro He's not supposed to be. He's a king. A really arrogant one. They should have used aquaman from flashpoint paradox. The basic plot is from justice league war. An anime.
@TomiLahren Most people know what shovels are, you really think international drug cartels are unsophisticated, uneducated groups of people?
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump I don't believe he intended to be racist, I also don't legitimize your opinions about someone else when it comes to race because your black. Trump is still a terrible person.
@Yuval_Rotem @IsraeliPM You are in the process of evicting people from their land.
@neeratanden @rolandsmartin It's just so weird that this happens immediately after his return from asia where elephants parts are incredibly valuable.
@freeparadox @LauraLoomer @HackedVote @TwitterSupport @TRobinsonNewEra Say you were successful in the task of subversion, what purpose or goal is extended thereafter?
@funder @giufuliafa I would say so. The hook in the first R matches the thick line that would appear on the second R, that's why the line is thicker. I use the hook for the first letter and over time I ended with a hook. No expert here though.
@ElizLanders @CNN https://t.co/PRxZWFtRLW it's just super coincidental he did this right after returning from asia, maybe nothing, maybe not nothing
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Okay.
@TheOregonBear @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Why is that?
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery don't exist.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery I read some of your stories, that information comes from what you call main stream media. If it aligns with something your in favor of it seems to be deemed credible. If not in favor of it, it's immediately dismissed. So your obtaining facts from a place where you claim facts
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery How are the same media outlets credible to you only when they work against what you oppose and not credible when they aren't in your favor? It's not a sincere question but would like to view your attempt at a sincere answer?
@KurtSchlichter @townhallcom I read your article, it's you insulting everything you don't like expecting everyone who doesn't share your perspective to acknowledge how right you are. It's absurd, you've evolved into everything you claim to hate.
@SethAMandel I just made my way onto her page and then to others attached, what the fuck world did i just walk into?
@bellesny65 @chuckwoolery It's actually a republican thing too, it's fucked up either way
@bellesny65 @chuckwoolery So essentially you are in poverty willing to work and you are placed back into poverty and this favors a number of hiring companies
@bellesny65 @chuckwoolery It's a systemic problem, minimum wage you qualify for food stamps, right to work is a ,program that forces able body individuals to work, a employer who hires an individual gets a tax break and can pay you minimum wage
@realDonaldTrump Cool now how about doing something about this https://t.co/B5uRXcZTGp
@trinity_toby @chuckwoolery It was repeatedly.
@chuckwoolery Imma just tell you a simple copy and paste puts dates this story to a least September 19th Chuck. When you say first reported do mean not first at all? I'm not gonna argue on the content but your not first.
RT @RadioFreeTom: Whoa https://t.co/1FIYZ2MCxQ
@SenateMajLdr @SenateRPC @GOPSenFinance No, no it would not. You sir are a liar.
@stuartpstevens @TheRickWilson I really don't see how him signing that arbitration clause isn't a breach of ethics or conflict of interest considering he only settled a years long class action law suit after he enters politics.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN The russia part, i have no idea really. Apparently they have credible sources out there somewhere, that's Mueller's job. I just see the obvious connection with assange and jr.. I think everybody on every side should be investigated at this point.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN Honestly it was just a poorly hatched plan for a leak. It should of been done by a distant party. It was far too direct.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN It does absolutely. Had he done it without the suggestion of someone who isn't a citizen or by an american citizen it would be a different story. That is the context, he did so at the suggestion of a declared enemy (again i don't really agree with that).
@trgrd_hpy @CNN He acted under the instruction of a foreign agent to undermine a political opponent.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN Assange is not american.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN Wikileaks and julian assange are considered enemies of the state. (I don't really agree with this before you ask.). Don jr. and assange acknowledge their correspondence. The dms have a link they requested don jr. Share with the american public. He did at their request.
@marklevinshow Language is living, you correctly interpreted and understood my words. I stand by it in spite.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN Political*
@trgrd_hpy @CNN They absolutely are. It's when a politically entity acts on behalf of a foreign agent that's the issue. Apparently things like the paradise papers are a drop in the hat. Word is that's not even half.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN Which is illegal.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN Therefore undermining our democratic process.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN Hey, i don't know, I'm not in that position of information. I do know don jr. posted a link under the instruction of a foreign agent. What that agent's goal is irrelevant. It was done so to undermine a political opponent.
@marklevinshow That's good news? I would still eat them. Their delicious.
@chuckwoolery Your comparisons make me laugh. Owner of 3 houses is the equivalent of a billionaire.
@trgrd_hpy @CNN Wikileaks provided the hacked dnc emails. They say they were hacked by russians.
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC @JudgeJeanine @GeraldoRivera @GreggJarrett @parksesq @SheriffClarke Which guest is not employed by fox and will not receive financial compensation for being on the program tonight sean?
@publius4 @lawcrimenews @Mediaite Wondering the same, its not credible unless you cite the legal expert
@funder So let them investigate that and all things connected to it.
@chrislhayes His claim of ignorance might ensure his ascension. He could be our president. That's the ladder when it comes to the lesser of two evils.
@OrinKerr @blakehounshell No idea, your the law professor here
@seanhannity @Scaramucci @Keurig You could give people their keurigs back. They broke them in support if you. Pretty sure they would want them back.
@Just_A_Joe @JulianAssange @DonaldJTrumpJr @wikileaks @Twitter Understandable but still true.
@Just_A_Joe @JulianAssange @DonaldJTrumpJr @wikileaks @Twitter Well my advice would be visit don jr's page. He acknowledges communicating with a declared enemy. I didn't make that assessment and I don't agree with it. Me implying nefarious would imply an agenda that's not impartial and it's not.  It's very bias.
@Just_A_Joe @JulianAssange @DonaldJTrumpJr @wikileaks @Twitter A version
@Just_A_Joe @JulianAssange @DonaldJTrumpJr @wikileaks @Twitter That's based on previous statements I've read.
@Just_A_Joe @JulianAssange @DonaldJTrumpJr @wikileaks @Twitter I don't believe i am, they are a branch of some of the worlds best hackers and data collectors. I think nefarious is probably in the application. My theory regards version of the lesser of 2 evils when it comes kinda approach regarding the current members of the administration.
@SandraHartle @DrEstella @tomborelli @annvandersteel @Keurig @seanhannity That's why you wash it?
@DrEstella @tomborelli @annvandersteel @SandraHartle @Keurig @seanhannity You can buy a washable filter for keurig. It's like 5 buxs. Just saying really.
@JulianAssange @DonaldJTrumpJr @wikileaks Weird they don't keep that type of information especially since their known for having the stance of transparency even more so when it comes to governments and government official's.

@funder @realDonaldTrump You scold him and then imitate him and expect others to believe your above him.
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump Of*
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump I wonder if these will be your words when a bomb descends over our horizon. As much as i hope we have an adequate defense, there is and never has been a guarantee of our safety. That's one on the main purposes of politics, or so I thought.
@0321blackwater @chuckwoolery Okay that's fair. I not a liberal or a conservative. I'm a person. My loyalty has a individual basis. It doesn't go to a group especially if that loyalty is just for the sake of not being a different group.
@mslavondra @chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump a
@mslavondra @chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump Well monster is your opinion, i don't have and like or dislike for him cause i don't really know him. I think we're all a little jealous of people in a position to have a greater deal of influence than we do. I'm jealous i don't own a basketball team but that's normal feeling.
@chuckwoolery It weird most of you are opposed to this when he is on a show that's entire premise is investing in small businesses and entrepreneurs and you support a guy who was on a show that's entire premise was about firing people.
@DailySabah That's a dick move
@funder He's not your problem. He'll be replaced. It's fox media and how they have people who they employ on separate shows are encouraged to appear on other shows under their ownership to reinforce a political agenda.
@funder Why? Honestly curious about why.
@BillOReilly That's your m.o. man. Your the the epitomy of feeding and creating controversy.
@demcratwhisperr @FoxBusiness @SebGorka @POTUS About the union? Taj mahal. I didn't say there was proof about the laundering. I said it's worth noting. He's also well known for trying to remove people from their land. I don't know if that's an American sediment that should be idealised.
@demcratwhisperr @FoxBusiness @SebGorka @POTUS Noting*
@demcratwhisperr @FoxBusiness @SebGorka @POTUS Before he was president he was responsible for hundreds of union layoffs, it's also worth nothing construction (especially large developers) is one of the best known ways to launder money.
@davidmweissman @BillOReilly Why is it about party allegiance?

@LAMOONLYNN @DesertLover46 @WilkowMajority Is he? Huh.
@chrislhayes Virginia is an employment-at-will state, meaning employers can fire people anytime and for any reason. That's the bigger issue.
@DavidLimbaugh @benshapiro One story said his ex's in laws were there so it could've been more of a personal situation than political. Unconfirmed.
@DesertLover46 @WilkowMajority I'm not rep or dem but i like Graham, he doesn't seem like he'll bullshit you. Like he'll talk straight and be honest.
@In2why @benshapiro They weren't noticeably impaired.
@In2why @benshapiro All these mass shooters though i don't think had these ailments. That type of calculated violence is strategic.

@StevenTDennis Guy consolidates power than a bunch of high ranks including a prince "crash". Extreme coincidence.

@RevJJackson @MakeItPlain @ministter On a grand scale It's an ultimate impossibility being a parasitic species. Limiting the capacity to be violent is more valid.
@SebGorka Also guns cause a person with a mental illness had access to guns so also very much guns.
@benshapiro An individual made that comment, being part of a group does not turn opinion into fact or add greater legitimacy to an individuals opinion.
