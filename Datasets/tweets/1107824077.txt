@dreysonboyd91 @jeffsessions @PressSec @tkupp15 @DonaldConner Many of these people we're seeking asylum when they're children were ripped from their arms and put in cages. Seeking asylum is a legal process and the U.S. is implementing an internationally illegal policy.

Just because something is legal, does not make it moral. Putting children in cages is immoral. 	@jeffsessions and @PressSec should be ashamed.  #wearethechildren  https://t.co/9AT7gTiVZe
