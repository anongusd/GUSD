He was a champion for the economy in Michigan and helped bring jobs and opportunity to the 12th District and beyond. @JohnDingell leaves an incredible legacy; we send our respectful appreciation and deepest condolences to his family. https://t.co/BPHYxenlGc
Mr. Dingell was also instrumental in creating the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, the first international wildlife refuge in North America, which now spans nearly 6,000 acres of unique habitat and protects 60 kinds of fish and 300 species of migratory birds.
Congressman @JohnDingell is a hero to our country and the #GreatLakes. As a lifelong public servant he helped usher in many of the key environmental laws of our time, including the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act and Clean Air Act.
