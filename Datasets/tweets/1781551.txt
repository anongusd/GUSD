...The Ivy undergrad streak:	2016: Trump (Penn)	2012 &amp; 2008: Obama (Columbia)	2004: Kerry (Yale) vs GHW Bush (Yale)	2000: Bush (Yale) vs Gore (Harvard)		Dem options 2020: Buttigieg (Harvard); Delaney or O'Rourke (Columbia); Gillibrand (Dartmouth); Klubuchar (Yale); Yang (Brown)
... The options there, if I'm not missing something, are just Bloomberg, Buttigieg, and Castro.		The Ivy League undergrad streak, of course, will survive thanks to Trump's UPenn/Wharton degree...
...The tougher streak is degrees from Massachusetts schools, which started in 2000:	2000: Gore (Harvard BA) vs GW Bush (Harvard MBA)	2004: Bush (Harvard MBA) vs Kerry (BC Law)	2008: Obama (Harvard Law)	2012: Obama (Harvard Law)	2016: H Clinton (Wellesley)...
... There are plenty of options to keep the streak going:	Abrams, Yale Law	Bennet, Yale Law	Bloomberg, Harvard MBA	Booker, Yale Law	Brown, Yale BA	Buttigieg, Harvard BA	Castro, Harvard Law 	Klobuchar, Yale BA
... 2004 Bush (Yale BA, Harvard MBA) vs Kerry (Yale BA)	2008 Obama (Harvard Law) vs McCain (none)	2012 Obama (Harvard Law) vs Romney (Harvard Law &amp; MBA)	2016 Clinton (Yale Law) vs Trump (none) ...
... The streak goes back to 1988, when GHW Bush (Yale BA) faced Dukakis (Harvard Law).	1992: GHW Bush (Yale BA) vs B Clinton (Yale Law)	1996: B Clinton (Yale Law) vs Dole (none)	2000: Gore (Harvard BA) vs GW Bush (Yale BA, Harvard MBA) ...

@ginachristo @HillaryClinton Yes, I pulled it back up yesterday. (Tho tbf it wasn't going anywhere in the '09-'10 Congress anyway)

My favorite award show tweeters are the ones who proclaim their utter unfamiliarity with all the biggest current artists, AND have very strong opinions about who should win the awards.
So they‚Äôve managed to give rap/hip-hop Grammys this year to Childish Gambino, Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Anderson.Paak, Drake, and Cardi B. Covering a lot of bases.

... Warren fought back on the political attacks, but didn‚Äôt seem to try to understand from tribes themselves what they thought, and what they wanted from her‚Äîespecially as, like it or not, a hugely high-profile national figure on Native American identity issues. ...
... That‚Äôs not terrible; there was no bad intent; it‚Äôs the kind of thing a perfectly decent person can do without thinking and then feel badly about when made aware. BUT it‚Äôs not really clear at all that she did feel badly...
... But there‚Äôs this other piece, which is that for decades she was, without realizing it, being culturally insensitive to Native Americans, by claiming the heritage without considering how tribes themselves think of that identification. ...
... First off: there‚Äôs no reason to think she tried to use it for advantage, or got advantage from it. And that whole debate is kind of silly b/c she was always a hugely desirable get for plenty of other reasons. ...
OK, my take (again? still? anew?)  on the E-Dubs Native American controversy, which I have been forced to know and think way too much about for the past seven years... (1/?)

Shoutout to @ewarren for holding her kickoff in Lawrence, a great city that has faced tremendous difficulties and misunderstandings, and whose people deserve much better than what their leaders have often done for them over the years. (Plus it‚Äôs close to the NH border; smart.)
@lenny_menny My guess is that if your son goes to medical school today, and publicly dresses in blackface to win a dance contest, he will - appropriately - have subsequent difficulty getting a prestigious fellowship at Walter Reed. Northam had no such difficulty.
@lenny_menny That‚Äôs not what I argued. My argument is specifically about those like Northam *who, by his own admission, openly displayed offensive racist behavior and attitudes* and received no negative consequences for doing so.
...On the plus side, I look forward to Northam resigning tomorrow to devote more time to finding the real racist.
...Btw that all also goes generally for gender as well as race, obv, tho not specifically relevant to this case.
@ernieboch3 As so often before, you willfully mischaracterize my clear words and then insult me for what you claim I said. (&amp; I will not engage with you further)
So that went well https://t.co/pmVgJhTU6f
...To be clear: I believe that people change, and I‚Äôm more about judging people by their attitudes and actions now (of which there are many, many to be judged). But we can‚Äôt continue to have our leaders (in politics &amp; elsewhere) be those who benefited from systemic racism.
...It‚Äôs not just a question of whether an incident then disqualifies him now. He would not be governor today had he ever faced appropriate setbacks or consequences for his behavior and attitudes at the time....
... His public display of casual racism did not then cause any blip in his rising in rank, pursuing a very successful medical career, and then increasingly high political office....
Northam concedes that he dressed in blackface, and didn‚Äôt realize it was a hurtful thing to do, c1984 when he was 24. His casual racism had not, to that point, prevented him from a full VMI degree, an EVMS MD, and commission as an officer in the US Army....
Here‚Äôs the thing.		Pretty much all white men of Northam‚Äôs age in Virginia at the time were (at best) casual racists well into their 20s (at least).		Very few of them think that this poses any issue for holding their current leadership positions.		That‚Äôs how systemic racism works.
Not since Jim Webb described his experience killing a man has a Virginia politician made such a confession on national TV.
Oh boy Ralphie
RT @meredithnierman: I‚Äôm giving a talk this coming Wednesday night abt my time embedded w/ Congresswoman @AyannaPressley during her campaig‚Ä¶
Can‚Äôt wait for Northam to demonstrate that it wasn‚Äôt him in blackface, via forensic comparison with photos of himself in blackface that he knows ARE genuine.
Old white dudes confused that they do not represent the contemporary Democratic Party https://t.co/I5lKPbVyR1
... And Northam would still be doomed anyway.
So Northam is now hoping to find some guy who is probably now head of some hospital department to come forward and cop to being blackface/KKK guy and say Northam wasn‚Äôt the other guy. Good luck with that.
Sorry I missed this. (A bit cursory, no? Maybe something more coming in a release.)

... tbf when you're that big a celeb candidate, press can be a little zoo-like in a house party. But Clinton managed to allow press inside house parties early on that year, tho tbf some of them were hosted by people with pretty big houses as I recall.
... House party will have pooled press, which IIRC is better than Obama's first one in '07. I and others stood outside in very cold whether for the chance to have him ignore questions we shouted as he left. Pretty sure there was no pool inside.

@segalmr Yes, but IMO the most important thing is not necessarily criminal liability, but whether voters become convinced that the campaign deliberately collaborated with the Russian govt to subvert the election. I think "collusion" is the understood shorthand for that.
@stanveuger That's a fair point, though--it's certainly plausible that Manafort wasn't thinking of it that way at the time. Though obviously would have realized it later.
@stanveuger Sure, that's a potential motivating factor, but it would still be collusion, right? Unless Manafort thought the Russians were doing something else with the data I suppose.
@jbview I would agree with that
@petermissouri Not ads; interviews
So if in fact Manafort gave campagn polling data to Kilimnik, is there any non-collusion explanation for that? (Granting that it doesn't necessarily mean anybody else on the campaign knew.)

... If you run a country and the US asks to use your air space for a military refueling, or to conduct exercises in your waters, do you accept their explanations and say yes? If US embassy says your kid will have no trouble entering/exiting, do you send her to college there?
... Seriously. The US Secy of Defense assured the SDF we had its back; then Erdogan called. Sr WH officials, if not DJT himself, assured Hill GOPers he would sign clean CR; then he watched a couple hours of FNC.
... I mean, honestly, how can anybody negotiate or cooperate with this White House or its representatives? You have absolutely no reason to believe that what you're told actually represents what Trump will do.
If there is one thing this week has surely done, it's convince everybody -- Hill GOP, foreign diplomats, really anybody who deals w/US govt -- that you can't have faith in anybody's word speaking for Trump, and really not even his directly. That's highly problematic.

As an Arizona native and life-long observer of its politics, I am fascinated by the growing speculative fiction in which Democrats control the levers of power that would allow them to steal a state-wide election there.
...Anyway, just saying that it seems like a really big deal that one of the country's two major political parties has an intractable, worsening, systemic bias preventing women from advancing within its ranks.
... That effect has been slow to really show definitively in results, but it meant that when the time was right this cycle, the Dem side had a fully matured infrastructure, culture, and political incentive structure to take advantage. 		Meanwhile, the GOP side has nothing.
... One of the big things that happened IMO was that ~2006-‚Äò08, a lot of ‚Äòwomen in politics‚Äô advocates abandoned the non-partisan approach and devoted themselves fully to the EMILY‚Äôs List partisan model. I reported a fair amount about it at the time; it‚Äôs had a huge effect. ...
... When I started obsessing on this topic ~2004, you couldn‚Äôt get people to see that the two parties were diverging on electing women, with the GOP actually regressing. Now, it‚Äôs like everybody shrugs it off as the way it‚Äôs always been. ...
I want to reiterate that the GOP managed to nominate no women in any of 22 open ‚Äúsolid R‚Äù House districts.		22 free shots at a new member of Congress. 22 men, no women.		One of the country‚Äôs two major parties has an intractable, and worsening, systemic gender bias.

Since 1995, no party‚Äôs US House caucus has had fewer than 17 women in it.		In 2019 the GOP‚Äîwhich has 23 now‚Äîwill have at most 15, and possibly just 13.		The GOP House caucus will be approximately 93% male.		This is as big a story as what‚Äôs happening with women Dems, IMO.

IMO one of the big stories of the 2018 midterm elections is the extraordinary percentage of GOP election winners who are men. 		It‚Äôs a huge, huge deal that one of the two major parties has this level of intractable systemic bias against electing women.
... Does that say something significant about the current partisan divide in the country? Does it mean anything at all? Does anybody want to pay me to write about it? Can I goad @KevinMKruse into commenting on this tweetstorm? Questions remain. [fin]
... That level of solid Senate representation turns out to be super unusual -- the number of split-rep states has consistently been in double-digits for 100 years, except for a brief dip to 9 in the 1950s, according to my attempt to research it two years ago. ...
... Yesterday's results, if they hold, turned six states from split to solid: Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, and North Dakota will be 2-GOP Senate states; Nevada will be a 2-Dem state. Unless I'm missing something, no states moved from solid to split representation....
... If I am correct about the current results, and if they hold, just seven states will have a US Senator from each party: Alabama (by quirk, thanks Judge Moore), Colorado, Maine (counting Angus King as a Dem), Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. ...
If I'm not mistaken, the US will have the fewest states with split partisan representation in the US Senate since 1910. Or "in more than a century," to be more dramatic.		Imma need someone to verify my work, which I actually did a couple years ago: https://t.co/waihbr1vmU ...

OK one more stat, then bed.		Looks like next year approximately 12% of US residents will have one or more Republican woman as either their Governor, Senator, or Congresswoman.		Approximately 46% of US residents will have one or more Democratic woman in one of those positions.
Well that‚Äôs a change https://t.co/ER0EYBZxik
Still a ways to go, but it looks to me that right around half of all the newly elected Dem US House members will be women. I‚Äôve talked a lot during this cycle about that as the big question to me. The total makeup of the caucus will be &lt;40% women, but still a big shift.
Just 14 GOP women House winners so far, with a few pending; prob add Handel + maybe 1 or 2 in CA?; looks like Mia Love &amp; K Arrington in trouble. Caucus currently has 23 women, almost certainly less than 20 next session.
RT @RalstonReports: The dead pimp is going to win, FYI.
...Noem wins SD, so 3 GOP women Governors.
Looks like Dems will go from 2 women Governors to 6, while GOP drops from 4 to either 2 or 3.		Pending AZ outcome: Dems go from 17 women Senators to 15 (or 16); GOP goes from 6 to 7 (or 8).

... They're going to say 'I'm sure I can find someone in this group of 30 wannabe Presidents with less baggage.' That might have been a big reason behind Warren's decision to do something dramatic, sooner rather than later, to address it.
... If, for example (purely speculating), a lot of those types think Warren's heritage Q is a big potential general-election problem -- even if that's baseless -- they aren't going to shrug it off, as they might in a smaller field where others have general-elex issues too....

@JeffSemonMA Of left-wing violence of the past few days justifying national concern?
@JeffSemonMA A) That doesn‚Äôt address my point;	B) There hasn‚Äôt.
@BostonMaggie Well, that‚Äôs just a string of irrelevant thoughts, which (in my pretty extensive experience) is a strong indication that you are experiencing psychological discomfort with addressing my underlying challenge to your assumptions.
@BostonMaggie But DailyWire, erroneously cribbing from another unreliable right-wing hype site, declares w/o evidence that it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúAntifa‚Äù attack, and tops it with a stock photo of angry-looking protestors led by one holding a bat. Yes, it‚Äôs the marketplace trying to scare you.
@BostonMaggie It was a small incident of vandalism, by an unknown perpetrator, quickly denounced by Dem and GOP leaders in NYC. These things happen from time to time in a country of 300 million. Not a major story of national import signifying any large threat of any kind.
@BostonMaggie ... Well, let me correct that: it‚Äôs a part of the conservative marketplace, which is different from the Republican Party. The conservative marketplace is what I‚Äôm talking about, and yes of course Ben Shapiro‚Äôs site is part of it.
@BostonMaggie Um, yes. That‚Äôs exactly what it is.
Have I perhaps ever mentioned that the Virginia GOP has become a total clown show? https://t.co/71z3pD5Unp
If you‚Äôve found yourself in the past few days upset about left-wing violence, consider that you‚Äôre being manipulated by the conservative marketplace. 		There‚Äôs no particular trend of left-wing violence or violent rhetoric. Just a spike in emphasis on it within that marketplace.

So, what have we learned today?
... Anyway, I offer my apologies to @JohnKerry because I was the one who goaded the guy on. I was young. Also drunk.
...We were there for I think the acquaintance‚Äôs GF‚Äôs b‚Äôday. Kerry came in w/staffers after the Sox game. Acquaintance for some reason had a small seahorse water-squirter necklace. Also, we were very drunk. 		tbf I probably should not be a Supreme Court Justice.
In light of new BK bar story, I hereby confess: at Crossroads c1992 I goaded an acquaintance into squirting water at the back of @JohnKerry‚Äôs head. We were very drunk. Kerry thought something dripped on him. 2nd time, Kerry spun his head and caught him dead to rights.
@thelindsayist There are a bunch of movies coming out soon or in development featuring women leads seeking violent retribution upon men who have done wrong, and I want to invest in all of them.

@AG_Conservative @GregCaseyMA Out of curiosity (asking both of you): Would you agree that it appears likely that BK deliberately lied/misled the committee about the extent of his drinking in the time periods in question?
@JamesPindell Ironic, because the reason she felt free to say what she said is that Diehl has demonstrated how ineffective this line of attack is for him.
@grantbosse You seem to be making a lot of assumptions about why I‚Äôm asking, when I was just asking.
@grantbosse So you‚Äôre saying no, you don‚Äôt agree.
@grantbosse I‚Äôm interested in whether you are willing to concede that he lied to/misled the committee about the extent of his drinking at the relevant time periods.
@grantbosse I‚Äôm not grasping at anything. I asked you a question.

As a general rule, there are a great many people who are unwilling to share information with the media or political offices - especially about controversial high-profile events - who are willing to share information with the FBI when agents contact them.

IMO this has not received nearly the attention it deserves. Women are virtually absent from power in the federal govt, in the 21st century.
I just want to point out (as I have before) that for the past 18 months this country has been run overwhelmingly by men, in a glaring reversal of a ~25-year trend. Top positions throughout exec &amp; leg branches - electeds, appointees, top staff - are unbelievably devoid of women.
If you take BK‚Äôs behavior yesterday out of the context - if you imagine, say, that this was video of him several years ago, being questioned about some rulings he had issued - there‚Äôs no way he gets anywhere near a Supreme Court seat, right?

@timothypmurphy Please tell me you didn‚Äôt miss when he (correctly!) recalled that Brett played LF at the Fenway game he took his law school buddies to. It was literally his best moment of the hearing.
@timothypmurphy OK fair I just think that the rhetorical device of recalling G Brett from earlier in the day outweighs precision of the analogy, but hey you do you.
@timothypmurphy You really could have gone with George Brett charging the umps after the pine tar call.
