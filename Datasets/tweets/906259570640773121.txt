“ Based on the research that has been conducted, the frequency of workplace mobbing around the world is alarmingly &amp; perhaps surprisingly high. The consequences are pontentially so severe for the victims that their careers and life courses are often changed forever” #Mobbing
David Yamada, “advises that when a lot of people in the workplace are saying the same thing about someone is a telltale sign of workplace mob formation. His advice is worth heeding.” #Mobbing #HealthyWorkPlaceBill
“David Yamada, the author of Healthy Workplace Bill, draft legislation designed to protect all employees from workplace abuse while also protecting organizations from frivolous lawsuits...” #Mobbing
““There is a collective ganging up on the mobbing target that is carefully orchestrated to provide the mobbers with maximum deniability that they are singling out a target” #Mobbing #Bullying #Workculture
“In #mobbing abusive acts are intended to humiliate and discredit a victim and are often focused on the victim’s character, personality, and working style as much more than his or her job performance.Personal and professional identities are globally attacked &amp; maligned.” #Mobbing
“Mobbing is not bullying. It is often far worse than bullying...key organizational members become involved in mobbing through overt or covert actions..the presence of organizational involvement in mobbing compounds the injury to the victim.” #Mobbing
“Being mobbed can take away a victim’s sense of safety and security in the world, sense of identity and belonging, and the belief that the world is a safe and just place” #Mobbing #Bullying
“Workplace #mobbing is a destructive social process..it leaves victims reeling, not knowing what has happened, why it happened , and, most important, what will happen in the future” #WorkCulture #Mobbing #Bullying
“... albeit that injury is usually of a psychological nature” #Workplacemobbing #Bullying
“We do not view victims of injury as feeling sorry for themselves or as having chosen a career as a victim as do some in popular culture. Use of the term is to remind us all that victimization from workplace mobbing can result in injury no less than from accidents or violence”
“Victim is used more frequently than target as a way of highlighting that workplace mobbing results in victimization, which, in turn, results in injury.” #Workplacemobbing #Bullying #Spreadawareness
“Both the terms victims and target are used to describe the subject of workplace mobbing or other workplace abuse” #Mobbing #Bullying #spreadawareness
“In terms of explanatory power, this “Bad Apple” explanation is quite limiting..the “Bad Apple” view can help us feel better after we hear about disturbing events in which people have gotten hurt either psychologically or physically” #Workplacemobbing #spreadawareness
“Banning bullies does not end the systematic problem. As the authors write, “it takes an organization”to create it, and that’s what it takes to stop it.” #Workplacemobbing #Bullying #spreadawareness
“The blunt and truthful authors describe how organizations create “Shadow Files” &amp; do whatever it takes to allow administrators to hide behind the myth that the organization is a “good and fair place to work” #Workplacemobbing #spreadawareness #Bullying
#Mobbing “the orchestrated effort of many against one eventually deprives the unsuspecting victim-target of health and well-being, income, status, health insurance ( unique American consequence)” #Bullying #spreadawareness
“They characterize this specialized type of aggression as a form of violence suffered in silence by victims because of its routine nature, accepted as the American way of doing work.” #DuffySperry #Mobbing #Bullying #spreadawareness

“I'm finding my way back to sanity again	Though I don't really know what I'm gonna do when I get there	and take a breath and hold on tight	Spin around one more time	And gracefully fall back to the arms of Grace”
“When the lost find a name worth believing in	And the fallen get back onto their feet	And the broken start to dream again	And the sound of hope fills these streets	You'll know it's here”
“When you hear a sound as loud as thunder	And you hear a cry that shakes the ground beneath you	When you hear a shout that shatters the darkness	You'll know it's here”
“When passion takes all our purpose	When searching ones embrace the light	When skeptics find themselves down on their knees	You'll know it's here”
“How long have I been in this storm?	So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form	Water's getting harder to tread	With these waves crashing over my head”
“There's not enough rope to tie me down	There's not enough tape to shut this mouth	The stones you throw can make me bleed	But I won't stop until we're free”
“I will have to die for this I fear	There's rage and terror and there's sickness here”

“My greatest hope is that future generations will not have to waste their time, their energy, and their youth being as strong as some of us have had to be.”
“There are times when survival itself is a political statement. When you have the choice to give up or to move sideways, sometimes the only thing that stops you from doing so is knowing that there are those who would consider that a victory — &amp; yes, that can look like strength”
“society should continue to layer trashing, shame, and social isolation on top of the toxic trench of outright abuse, and tell us that if we’re really strong, we’ll just deal with it.	It’ll never keep all of us down.”
“You have found ways to carry on -You are tired, but no longer afraid. Instead, you are angrier than you could possibly have imagined. And not just on your own behalf.”
“Someone gently suggests that you might have post-traumatic stress disorder, and you think, well, maybe, but the trauma looks like it’s going to continue until you quit writing”
“You have not grown a thick skin, but you have learned how to respect yourself, how to care for yourself, because if you hadn’t learned, you could not have continued. You still find it hard to trust other humans, to have real relationships. You’re working on it” #Perseverance
“You’re 31 and it didn’t get better. But you did. You’re working harder than ever. You can now pick the rare jewels of reasonable critique out of the steaming bullshit of bad-faith trashing.”
“Ask yourself how culture might change if the women in it weren’t living under constant, critical surveillance, if we were allowed to be vulnerable, to be difficult, to be strange, to take risks, and to make mistakes.”
“Take a look, if you dare, at how many of us are surviving and thriving despite being punished for being a little bit too ambitious, and then ask yourself what we might do if we didn’t have to waste our time on bullshit.”
“Spite can keep you going when strength and self-confidence wear thin. For every person you see struggling on through years of trashing and trolling, though, there are more who have given up&amp;that’s the point. The point is to scare women and girls out of social and cultural spaces
“I’ve not made it myself is that I’ve hung on long enough to make myself completely unsuitable for any other work. That, with a side order of sheer bloody-minded refusal to let the bastards win.” #Bullying
“Not everyone, though, has the capacity to continue when the world really seems to want you to go away. Plenty fall by the wayside, or quietly withdraw, or simply never dare get started in the first place.”Bullying
“the demand to perform strength in the face of cowardly recreational hate-mobs is the final insult”#bullying
“Black women in particular are required to perform strength in the face of treatment nobody should have to be strong enough to endure.” #Bullying
“You struggle to maintain relationships. Acquaintances whisper about you, and close friends are worried. You stop going out for weeks on end. You suspect that, ultimately, you deserved this. You consider giving up. You keep going. You are punished again. You fucking persist.”
“half the time it’s as much as you can do to keep going, that there’s no one weird trick to get back the time you waste on the emotional and practical overheads of continuous abuse” #Bullying
“But I’ve read all the theory and staggered through all the flame wars and I’ve come to the conclusion that when you get down to it, people who enjoy hurting other people are not worth your time or mine. They can take that kink to a club where it belongs.” #Bullying
“ I understand that bullying can feel pretty damn good, especially if you don’t call it that. I understand that playing the game of trashing feels comfortable and comprehensible, even righteous, when so little else does. “ #Bullying #Collectiveharrasment #ACCOUNTABILITY
“It’s about pleasure. Is somebody actively enjoying making you feel like shit? Is driving conscientious people to mental breakdown a really good time for them? Are they getting off on your pain? There’s a word for that, and it’s not “ally.” #Gaslighting #Bullying
“It took me many years to learn the most important distinguishing factor when trying to decide what criticism to take on board, once you’ve filtered and blocked for bots and fascists. It’s not about tone, and it’s not, for fuck’s sake, about Twitter.” #Bullying
“There’s one more thing that the Left, the Right, and every spoke on the broken compass of directionless human politics has in common. Apart from disliking women who are too much, the other thing they have in common is how much they seem to enjoy taking them down.” #Hostility
“It is also understandable, if less honorable, that when injustice is so structurally impregnable and enemies are so amorphous...What makes the difference is whether shame is the chief weapon of the people doing the calling out” #Accountability
“I’ve defended call-out culture in the past, and I’ll do it again. For all its problems, the way we hold people responsible for their actions in this weird new public crypto-space we share is a step in the direction of a truly accountable culture.” #Accountability
“It’s hard to stay in the room and listen to legitimate critique when you’re being hammered on all sides by bullshit. “ #Collectiveharrasment
“If you want to be a decent artist, entrepreneur, or activist — actually, if you want to be a decent human being, full stop — you have to stay open. Living with a constant barrage of harassment makes you want to shut down entirely”#Collectiveharrasment
Well, part of the answer is that you get very tired.Trashing &amp; trolling makes it hard to work, in the same way that the sucking lake of treacle in your nightmares makes it hard to run. It makes you afraid of putting a foot wrong, ever. #Collectiveharrasment
“This used to be a question only the legitimately famous had to answer, and often the answer involved money. What about people who sometimes get recognized and yelled at on the bus but still have to take the damn bus?” #Publicshaming
“How do you survive as an artist, a writer, a politician, an academic, through sustained harassment, relentless intrusion into your personal life, and intimate dissection of your every public and semi-public action? “ #Collectiveharrasment #Hostility #bullying #Gaslighting
“Sometimes I like to play a little game called What Would a Man Have to Do to Be Targeted Like This? Usually it’s “rape or kill someone, and be convicted in court.” #Hostility  #Bullying
“When people meet you and realize that in the flesh you are soft-spoken, socially awkward, and, most importantly, physically petite enough to be unthreatening, they express a sort of spiteful shock. “
“When women come across as ambitious, as self-serving, or simply as successful, whatever their cause or cohort, they are considered wrongdoers by default.” #Collectiveharrasment
“Granted,any woman in the remotest corner of the public eye who wants to be treated with a sugar pill of respect must find a way to dress which is not too conservative nor too revealing,not too frumpy nor too frivolous,a way of speaking which is neither “aggressive”nor simpering
“We have come a long way from The Scarlet Letter:Today, when women are harassed &amp;shamed out of public life the shame &amp;harassment is slightly less likely to involve a rhetoric of sexual policing,at least among https://t.co/Q5Bkgf6nMq least, most progressives,at least most of time
“What makes victim-blaming so insidious is that it isn’t just about shifting the blame — it’s about sending a message to anyone else who might be dumb enough to think they can do whatever that victim was doing and get away with it.” #Hostility #Collectiveharrasment
“Not everyone is harassed equally. If we were, solidarity might be slightly easier to summon.There are still individuals who are singled out for special monstering, whose every move is scrutinized, with a range of flavors of self-righteousness, as a warning to others.”#Hostility
“Of course, nobody deserves death threats. But come on, princess. Didn’t you ask for this, even a little bit? You shouldn’t have been so ambitious. So forthright. So talented. So unapologetic. Careful, or they’ll make an example of you.” #Collectiveharrasment
“After almost a decade of “awareness-raising” about online misogyny — just like your granddad’s home-grown misogyny, but on the intertubes — it hasn’t got any better. It’s got worse. And the most common response, by far, is still victim-blaming. “ #Collectiveharrasment
“Women who have succeeded too well at becoming visible,” writes Sady Doyle in her barnstorming book Trainwreck, “have always been penalized vigilantly and forcefully, and turned into spectacles.” #Collectiveharrasment
“They like the idea of you being frightened on their segment. They don’t want you to be angry. You are asked to calm down. They exchange significant looks. You’re a problem now. You were always a problem. Maybe these online weirdos had a point.” #Collectiveharrasment
“we have no legal response to bullying in a society predicated upon it” #Hostility #Bullying #Collectiveharrasment
“Whenever a woman takes up too much space in the world, reasons will be found to cut her down to size. And reasons will be found to deflect responsibility. “ #Bullying
and still struggling to explain to yourself or your family what has happened. I’d choose the sickos every time “ #Collectiveharrasment
“The most violent trolls can shake you up and make you feel physically unsafe for a moment, but dedicated trashing can undermine your work, hurt your financial security, destroy your relationships, damage your professional standing, and leave you broke and lonely and isolated...
“but you don’t worry that your nose might be looking particularly rapeable right now. It is less insidious, less traumatic, than being trashed by your colleagues and peers: by the people you expected to have your back before you knew to watch it. “ #Collectiveharrasment
“I’ve spoken with countless women who have been attacked, mobbed, and shamed for doing their jobs and living their lives, and without exception, all of them prefer the outright violence. “ #Bullying
“In Britain and beyond, abuse is an accepted part of the working life of women in politics both from anonymous extremists and from their own peers.And that’s before we begin to address what happened to Jo Cox. What happened to Gabrielle Giffords. What happened to Marielle Franco”
“It’s legitimate critique. They have overstepped and they owe us an answer, an apology. We are definitely not attacking her “ #Bullying
“But for those of us who go through it every day, the context collapses into a flat field where people are firing at you from all sides and there’s no cover, not for you.” #Bullying
“Eventually you reply to the thread, thinking that if you could just explain why they’re wrong about you, that you’re a decent, well-meaning person who is trying her best and is still pretty young, they’d lay off.	It doesn’t work out that way.” #Bullying
“You can’t stop checking this thread, although you know you shouldn’t. It makes you jumpy and paranoid. A dear friend drifts out of touch, and blanks you when you greet her in the pub. Later you find out that she’s a regular on the forum.” #Bullying
“You’re being punished for not knowing your place. And the worst of it is that the stigma sticks. Even among those who disown it. You’re the girl who gets hassled. The one who attracts too much attention. You must have done something to deserve it.” #Bullying
“Freeman was talking about the feminist Left, but this happens everywhere. In fact, committed hatred of successful women and a destructive obsession with women who step outside their lane seem to be the sole point on which the entire political spectrum is in absolute agreement.”
“In the 1970s, trashing had to be done with analog tools. Today, it is faster, harder, more savagely intimate. It follows you to work. It follows you to bed.” #Bullying
and she might understand that it’s not really her they hate, but she’s the one getting those messages every day. #Bullying
“This woman who doesn’t have the sense to protect herself from public shaming by piping down, by walking with her eyes lowered.She can be trashed intimately by people who don’t know her, people who are engaging, at best, with a flimsy caricature based on her worst qualities..
“Trashing is insidious. It can damage its subject for life, personally and professionally. Whether or not people sympathize, the damage has been https://t.co/bSVkV5wXfO doesn’t matter if the attacks have any basis in truth: What matters is that she is difficult”#Bullying
“researchers report high levels of post-traumatic stress among those who have been subject to it. Again, those singled out for mobbing are more likely to be high-achievers, more likely to be potential leaders, and especially likely to be women.” #Collectiveharrasment #Bullying
“Forty years later, trashing is still progressives’ favorite tactic to deploy against uppity women. When it happens in the playground, it’s called bullying. When it happens in the workplace, the phenomenon is delicately known as mobbing” #Collectiveharrasment #Trashing #bullying
“Frankly, if we are going to have competition I prefer the old-fashioned kind. Such competitiveness has its costs, but there are also some collective benefits from the achievements the competitors make while trying to outdo each other. With trashing there are no beneficiaries”
“what has impressed me most is how traditional it is. There is nothing new about discouraging women from stepping out of place by the use of psychological manipulation”
“Those being trashed can do nothing right. Because they are bad, their motives are bad, and hence their actions are always bad. There is no making up for past mistakes, because these are perceived as symptoms and not mistakes” #Trashing
“Trashers also tend to use nouns and adjectives of a vague and general sort to express their objections to a particular person.These terms carry a negative connotation,but don't really tell you what's wrong.That is left to your imagination.Those being trashed can do nothing right
“Trashing involves heavy use of the verb "to be" and only a light use of the verb "to do." It is what one is and not what one does that is objected to, and these objections cannot be easily phrased in terms of specific undesirable behaviors.”#Trashing
“#Trashing only works well when its victims are alone, because the essence of trashing is to isolate a person and attribute a group's problems to her”
#Trashing there is little a woman can do to defend herself because she is by definition always wrong”
“Women who remind us that we are not all the same are trashed because their differentness is interpreted as meaning we are not all equal.”
“The "fear of success" is quite rational when one knows that the consequence of achievement is hostility and not praise.”
but that women exhibiting potential for achievement are punished by both women and men.” #Trashing
“This kind of woman has always been put down by our society with epithets ranging from "unladylike" to "castrating bitch." The primary reason there have been so few "great women”is not merely that greatness has been undeveloped or unrecognized...
“The use of social pressures to induce conformity and intolerance for individuality is endemic to American society. “ #Trashing
“Trashing is not only destructive to the individuals involved, but serves as a very powerful tool of social control. The qualities and styles which are attacked become examples other women learn not to follow” #Trashing
“We gathered one night for a general discussion on the state of the Movement, and instead found ourselves discussing what had happened to us. We had two things in common; all of us had Movement-wide reputations, and all had been trashed”
“For at least six months I lived in a kind of numb despair, completely internalizing my failure as a personal one. In June, 1970, I found myself in New York coincidentally with several feminists from four different cities.”
I had survived my youth because I had never given anyone or any group the right to judge me. That right I had reserved to myself.” #Trashing
“Having survived so much unscathed, why should I now succumb?The answer took me years to arrive at. It is a personally painful one because it admits of a vulnerability I thought I had escaped...
“For the first time in my life, I found myself believing all the horrible things people said about me. When I was treated like shit, I interpreted it to mean that I was shit. My reaction unnerved me as much as my experience” #Trashing
“It was is if I had unwittingly entered a new society, one operating by rules of which I wasn't aware, and couldn't know” #Trashing
“My response to this was bewilderment. I felt as though I were wandering blindfolded in a field full of sharp objects and deep holes while being reassured that I could see perfectly and was in a smooth, grassy pasture” #Trashing
“This was communicated so subtly that I never could get anyone to talk about it.There were no big confrontations, just many little slights.Each by itself was insignificant;but added one to another they were like a thousand cuts with a whip.Step by step I was ostracized”#trashing
with time and effort. But the harder I tried, the worse things got, until I was finally forced to face the incomprehensible reality that the problem was not what I did, but what I was.” #Trashing
“It took three trashings to convince me to drop out. Finally, at the end of 1969, I felt psychologically mangled to the point where I knew I couldn't go on. Until then I interpreted my experiences as due to personality conflicts or political disagreements which I could rectify..
“Eventually all your colleagues join in a chorus of condemnation which cannot be silenced, and you are reduced to a mere parody of your previous self.” #Trashing
“These feelings are reinforced when you are isolated from your friends as they become convinced that their association with-you is similarly inimical to the Movement and to themselves. Any support of you will taint them.”#trashing
“Whatever methods are used, trashing involves a violation of one's integrity, a declaration of one's worthlessness, and an impugning of one's motives In effect, what is attacked is not one's actions, or one's ideas, but one's self” #Trashing #Jofreeman
“The trasher tell your friends false stories of what you think of them; interpret whatever you say or do in the most negative light;project unrealistic expectations on you so that when you fail to meet them,you become a”legitimate"target for anger;deny your perceptions of reality
“The means vary. Trashing can be done privately or in a group situation; to one's face or behind one's back; through ostracism or open denunciation.” #trashing #jofreeman
”But it is not done to expose disagreements or resolve differences. It is done to disparage and destroy” #JOFREEMAN #trashing
“Trashing is a particularly vicious form of character assassination which amounts to psychological rape. It is manipulative, dishonest, and excessive. It is occasionally disguised by the rhetoric of honest conflict, or covered up by denying that any disapproval exists at all”
“What is "trashing," It is not disagreement; it is not conflict; it is not opposition.These are perfectly ordinary phenomena which, when engaged in mutually,honestly, and not excessively, are necessary to keep an organism or organization healthy and active” #joefreeman #Trashing
“It took me years to recover, and even today the wounds have not entirely healed -- yet in the back of my head there is a pervasive, irrational certainty that says if I stick my neck out, it will once again be a lightning rod for hostility. #Trashing #Joefreeman
“It's been a long time since I was trashed.I was one of the first in the country, perhaps the first in Chicago, to have my character, my commitment, and my very self attacked in such a way by Movement women that it left me torn in little pieces and unable to function.” #Trashing
“Years after witnessing violent takedowns of other women in the late 60s, Jo Freeman penned a desperate article “Trashing:The Dark Side of Sisterhood,”which rings a note of ominous familiarity 4anyone who has watched what happens 2 women who dare 2 display self-respect in public”
“Misogyny is among many things millennials did not invent. Long before Twitter was a glint in Jack Dorsey’s eye, women who stepped out of line were being shamed by Left and Right alike regardless of which wave of feminism they rode.” #Collectiveharrasment
“People hate women, and the internet allows them to do it faster, harder, and with impunity” #Collectiveharrasment #Onlinebullying
“Let’s be daring for a minute and consider an alternative theory: The internet does not hate women. The internet doesn’t hate anyone, because the internet, being an inanimate network, lacks the capacity to hold any opinion whatsoever.” #Onlineharrasment
“It’s easy to blame technology for this,&amp; people do.I do..not because I really think that the internet is a sentient machine capable of specific &amp;malicious bastardry,but because it’s sometimes too depressing to acknowledge that one is surrounded by moral illegitimacy on all sides
“Just about exactly when women started to use the internet to organize in ways that kept patriarchy awake at night, it started to become a truism that the internet was a dangerous place for girls” #Collectivebullying
“The year 2010 was also when mob harassment started to be weaponized against women online in an organized way. That’s no coincidence...#Collectiveharrasment
“Social media can expand the means to proliferate misogynistic and sexist narratives, and shame women and maintain power inequalities in the offline world.” #Collectivebullying #bullyingawareness
“When it comes to feminism, simply describing the world as so many of us actually experience it can be a radical act, and that’s what a lot of women started doing in 2010 in numbers too big to ignore” #Collectiveharrasment #bullying
“The year 2010.., was when the snowball of new feminism got up enough momentum to become a threat to culture. That momentum came from the internet. “The ability to call out sexism and misogyny on social media has revolutionized the feminist movement” #Collectiveharrasment
“How does it feel to be a hate figure?	You should have taken it as a warning. This is about the time when the death threats start.” #Collectiveharrasment #bullyingawareness
“You’d warn her in much the same way that you might warn her not to walk through town alone at night, not to let her guard down, not to relax, ever. And the message is the same: The future, like the past, is not for you. You may visit, but only if you behave” #bullyingawareness
“Stop engaging online. Cut yourself off from friends, family, and professional contacts, shut down your business, blow up your social capital, stop learning, stop talking, just stop. Or else.” #Collectivebullying&amp;harrasment #bullyingawareness
“The internet hates women. Everyone knows that by now, and nobody precisely approves, but we’ve reached a point of collective tolerance. It’s just the way of the world, and if you can’t handle it, honey, delete your account.” #Collectivebullying&amp;harrasment

Ain't it funny, rumors fly	And I know you heard about me	So hey, let's be friends	I'm dying to see how this one ends
Cause, baby, I could build a castle	Out of all the bricks they threw at me
All the drama queens taking swings	All the jokers dressing up as kings #callitwhatyouwant
All my flowers grew back as thorns	Windows boarded up after the storm #callitwhatyouwant
And therein lies the issue	Friends don't try to trick you	Get you on the phone and mind-twist you #thisiswhywecanthavenicethings

I don't like your little games	Don't like your tilted stage	The role you made me play	Of the fool, no, I don't like you	I don't like your perfect crime	How you laugh when you lie	You said the gun was mine	Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)#LookWhatYouMadeMeDo
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time..Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo #Sundaylyrics
