But for myself, I will be doing that from the outside starting on Friday afternoon. See you all there.
Ideas matter—I am proud of how the team at CEA has contributed to them, am glad our dedicated staff will keep doing that from the inside.
Bigger contributions to smaller issues is also important. Some favorites: spectrum, COI in retirement savings, and competition.
The debate is not always proportional to importance. Expanded EITC/CTC—passed in 2009 and now permanent—help 16 million poor people annually
It is important to make even small contributions to big things: the Recovery Act and the ACA certainly qualify as big.
But  for my final words from @CEAChair I want to briefly mention some of what I most proud of which is policy.
I recently did tweetstorms on my favorite CEA reports and speeches (all at https://t.co/1WA20lo8Uv), in the future will be @jasonfurman
Tomorrow is my last day on this Twitter handle, looking forward to being @jasonfurman starting Friday.
@davidckamin notice the bars jump up around 2009, know anyone who might have put some of those in the baseline?

Agenda going forward: build on success of existing programs, improve market outcomes &amp; incomes, and avoid pitfalls like block granting https://t.co/neT1Ojb6Qr
Policies like higher min wage, access to education &amp; improving mobility raise market-incomes over long term &amp; complement antipoverty prgms https://t.co/htNm5YPgV5
Large body of economic research shows that anti-poverty programs have long-run benefits for education, earnings &amp; health https://t.co/VpupYwM1VQ
Welfare reform cut real value of TANF funding by 40% since ‘96 &amp; let States divert $ from basic aid. Eligible families’ access fell sharply https://t.co/1ObnGfLJ8u
Emphasis on work in poverty programs has risen sharply over time but leaves behind some very low-income families &amp; those who can't find work https://t.co/geBMRoaLEL
Tax &amp; transfer programs also reduce cyclical swings in poverty during downturns. Recovery Act provisions particularly effective https://t.co/lP86EfbFat
Antipoverty impact of govt policies has grown over time. In 1967, 5% of otherwise poor were lifted out of poverty versus 45% in 2015 https://t.co/dkdT36TQtR
Official poverty rate roughly stable since late 1960s, but supplemental poverty rate counting taxes &amp; transfers has declined meaningfully. https://t.co/MYeO9YARpK
Over past 50 years, great strides made in reducing poverty. But they stem entirely from taxes/transfers, not gains in market incomes.

RT @mariademertzis: Discrimination!! https://t.co/PNqhU5Xv6s
CEA constructed a new dataset for this analysis, matching tariffs with consumption. Available here: https://t.co/37uVAO8z4m
Tariffs are also arbitrary &amp; women’s apparel often has higher tariffs than men’s. Suits: 23% v. 14%. Pants: 15% v. 10%. Underwear: 13% v. 7%
Raising all tariffs by 10 percentage points could increase annual costs for families in first decile by $301 and at the median by over $600.
Tariffs act as a tax on imported goods. Lower-income families spend higher share of income on traded goods &amp; bear greater tariff burden. https://t.co/b36ifS1efZ
Relative to income tariff burden is highest for lowest-income families. For 2nd decile, annual tariff burden ($96) &gt; 01/03 tax cuts ($28–87) https://t.co/8OAADK13Hb
Original CEA analysis matches tariff &amp; consumption data, finding that tariffs are an arbitrary &amp; regressive tax: https://t.co/aA0Zo5OUg0

3. Best measure of growth is GDO (Gross Domestic Output)--the average of GDP &amp; GDI. More info: https://t.co/mNYDs31EUE
2. For job changes just look at the (much larger) payroll survey, the household survey should have essentially no weight. https://t.co/IwmYiQ9SD7

One contributing factor to low jobs growth this month is telecommunications strike affecting ~35K workers. https://t.co/dUom5wT4B7
Since 2010, economy has added 14.5M jobs. So far in 2016, pace of job growth is 150K/month, above rate needed for stable &amp; low unemployment
