@Truthriseswlove @realDonaldTrump Seeming illegal and being illegal are world apart. The dirt on Trump is that he traded influence for assistance. Traded favorable policy and a weaker alliance with western Europe for the privacy of embarrassing information.

@Truthriseswlove @realDonaldTrump Because he was the President it goes up to him? I agree, FBI reports up. But inferring political motive is just posturing. The same people chose to probe into Clinton's emails at a politically delicate time. What did they do to damage train Trump?
