@MikeWChip @IanDon @chrisraia @DanMcGowan @ScotMackRI That‚Äôs what‚Äôs beautiful about this concept, though, IMO. Nothing‚Äôs stopping a manager from doing that but they have to make some other strategic decisions because he won‚Äôt be able to carry a roster loaded with relievers. The rule book doesn‚Äôt change, just the personnel rules.
I actually like this proposal a lot. It addresses the roster rules, not the actual rules, and requires teams to adapt a strategy that will likely shorten games. 		@IanDon, @chrisraia, @DanMcGowan, @ScotMackRI ‚Äî what day you? https://t.co/c8N3wQGx6m

.@MayorFung: "I agree with Joe"		(Joe Trillo just lauded Donald Trump.)
.@MayorFung wants to gut Commerce, and that means killing the state's first small business loan program - a program that's helped 70+ entrepreneurs, including a number in Cranston.		Why would Allan hurt small biz owners? No reason except the program was Gina's idea.
RI's economic development initiatives will create $270M in new net revenue that we can invest in schools, roads, job training and tax cuts. @MayorFung will gut it and send us backwards.
C'mon Allan. Your stance on economic development makes clear that you're naive. 		Every state uses incentives. If RI doesn't, we lose jobs to MA, NY, CT, etc.		@GinaRaimondo's approach protects taxpayers and spreads out the risk to avoid things like 38S, which you supported.

@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung @NRA @realDonaldTrump Ten days to go. 		https://t.co/Kr8J9ezLe5		- 30 -
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung @NRA 10. More than 95 percent of RIers have health insurance and our HSRI premiums are the lowest in America. 		When @realDonaldTrump tried to gut the ACA and take health care away from RIers, Gina stood up and fought back. 		@MayorFung was silent.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung @NRA 9. Four years ago, unemployment in the construction trades was nearly 25%. Since @GinaRaimondo‚Äôs been Governor, RI has created thousands of construction jobs because we‚Äôre finally fixing roads and bridges. @MayorFung will end RhodeWorks and make RI‚Äôs highways more dangerous.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung @NRA 8. Nearly 30 companies have moved here or expanded here, hiring thousands of Rhode Islanders for jobs that pay an average of $65,000. 		@MayorFung will gut the incentive programs that helped bring them here and send those jobs to other states.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung 7. Gina‚Äôs strengthened RI‚Äôs gun laws and banned guns from school grounds. 		@MayorFung has a ‚ÄòA rating‚Äô from the @NRA and opposes action to prohibit non-law enforcement personnel from carrying firearms into our kids‚Äô schools.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung 6. @GinaRaimondo made RI the 4th state in the U.S. to offer tuition-free access to community college, and RI's program outperforms Tennessee‚Äôs. She‚Äôll expand RI Promise to adults @ CCRI and HS grads @ URI &amp; RIC. @MayorFung will pull the rug out from under RI students and end it.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung 5. Gina stands up for working families: @GinaRaimondo‚Äôs raised the minimum wage three times, and wants to raise it again. She passed and signed a paid sick law. She‚Äôs improved quality for child care, and given child care workers a raise.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung 4. 19,300 jobs since @GinaRaimondo took office and tops in the U.S. in wage growth last year.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung 3. Gina‚Äôs cut taxes to make Rhode Island a more business friendly state and provide Rhode Island families with much needed relief from their car tax.		@MayorFung has raised taxes six times, including the car tax, and he runs a distressed city.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung 2. Gina tripled the number of Pre-K classes in Rhode Island and expanded all-day kindergarten to every district. In her second term, @GinaRaimondo will bring universal Pre-K to RI. @MayorFung opposes that plan and was one of only a handful of Mayors who didn‚Äôt offer all-day K.
@GinaRaimondo @MayorFung 1. Four years ago, RI had the highest unemployment rate in America. Today, thanks to @GinaRaimondo‚Äôs programs, it‚Äôs 3.9 percent - lowest since 1989. @MayorFung wants to end those programs and put RIers‚Äô jobs at risk. https://t.co/5jCgIoHWL6

You're one of those Sox fans that mourned the 2004 World Series win because you lost your sense of self when things weren't so bad anymore, aren't you? 		Fact is, Gina's changed RI, and the economy is stronger today than it's been in years.

@williammurray21 @MayorFung It‚Äôs Raia, not Rais. And there was an armed police officer at Majorie Douglas in Parkland. 		SROs alone are not the solution. 		We need fewer guns in schools, safer school buildings, a ban or assault weapons and tough laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.
In my experience, a GC typically outflanks an advisor? (GC's are often de facto campaign managers.)		More importantly, @MayorFung still hasn't said whether he believes Kavanaugh's accusers, condones @Robasimms' dismissive comments or supports Kavanaugh's appointment to the Court. https://t.co/xw02XrwRsd
@MayorFung And we'll fight to keep guns out of our kid's school. @GinaRaimondo banned non-law enforcement personnel from carrying firearms on school grounds. You said you wouldn't, @MayorFung. And now you're proposing more guns in our school communities? That's the wrong approach.

@StephenBarnabe @kathyprojo @JonPincince @TedNesi Here's the CES (jobs) data: https://t.co/leinR9pQZH	Here's the LAUS (employment) data: https://t.co/XY1yeDSmY7
@TedNesi @kathyprojo @JonPincince Ted's correct. CES surveys employers - these are jobs in RI. (NOTE: CES doesn't include self-employed jobs - i.e. gig economy.) 		LAUS surveys households and counts # of employed people.		Only O's I know are a once proud baseball team in Baltimore and off-brand cereal.
@JonPincince @kathyprojo @TedNesi Two sets of data. Job count is at all time high/most jobs ever (CES data) and highest employment/most RIers working in a decade (LAUS data).

RI state govt is closed tomorrow. @govraimondo will provide media update on storm prep at 8:30am tomorrow at @RhodeIslandEMA.
@SailingTheOcean FCC didn‚Äôt reach out to us either. We requested a meeting when we learned he was touring E911 and had a substantive conversation. General Assembly law from 2000 requires fees to go to Gen Fund. Gov welcomes a change/creation of dedicated fund, but that requires legislation.
@SailingTheOcean Chuck, no one from our office - including the governor - was invited until 11:30am yesterday. She keeps a busy schedule and wasn‚Äôt able to attend on such short notice. I don‚Äôt know why Rep Lancia waited until 6 hours before the event to invite the Governor.
@TaraGranahan @projo Here are facts, not theater: RI response rate is faster than NENA best practice standard. 97 percent of calls answered within 10 seconds last month. Last year more than 95 percent answered in less than 10 seconds.		NENA standard is 90 percent in peak. 95 percent in non peak.
@statehousetalk .03% of all calls were in cue for more than 45 seconds.
@TaraGranahan @projo  https://t.co/8QQDgzMNmw

@OSTPA1 @TaraGranahan @EmergencyDocs @RIHEALTH @LynnArditi I did read it. I don‚Äôt dispute the reporting. I don‚Äôt know deets of other state requirements. I do know, though, that RI‚Äôs E911 trains/certifies all telecom staff and cert includes training to provide instruction over the phone.
The Journal report literally called this 'summit' and visit "political theater." https://t.co/utxQC28Bfx

.@ProJo report on Rep Lancia's 'summit' calls it what it is: "Political theater." https://t.co/PR38sQaDXG
@OSTPA1 @TaraGranahan @EmergencyDocs @RIHEALTH @LynnArditi I don't know about the specifics of certification requirements in other states. I know that RI's E911 trains and certifies all its telecom staff in CPR through the American Red Cross and they are trained to provide instruction over the phone.
‚ÄúHow would you like to have a new school?‚Äù Raimondo asked students in the gym. ‚ÄúThis school is more than 50 years old and we think it‚Äôs time for a facelift.‚Äù https://t.co/npBYoByQkl
@OSTPA1 @TaraGranahan @EmergencyDocs @RIHEALTH @LynnArditi I'm saying that they are certified by American Red Cross and their certification includes training to provide instruction over the phone.
@TaraGranahan The legislature passed a bill in 2000 that requires 90% of 911 fees to be allocated to the General Fund and 10% allocated to the state IT fund. There is no restricted fund for E911. Gov would welcome legislation to change that.
Last year, more than 95% of calls to 911 were answered in less than 10 seconds. Out of nearly half a million calls, 0.03% of calls were in cue for more than 45 seconds.		Gov's budget proposal includes two new FTEs at E911 to support Next Gen 911, which allows people to text 911. https://t.co/TvYskBvBq2
@TaraGranahan E911 is adequately staffed for every shift and Gov Raimondo has directed DPS to fill all telecom vacancies. Hired 5 since start of the year and currently recruiting to fill additional positions this spring. Gov also proposed two new FTEs in the budget she submitted in January.
@TaraGranahan Ask him why he's here. We had candid discussion. He acknowledged RI's practice of allocating fees to the GF has been in place since the GA passed legislation in 2000 requiring that. And he understood that RI's response time to calls is faster than NENA standard for best practice.
All E911 telecom staff are trained/certified in CPR by American Red Cross and provide CPR instructions to callers when necessary. This was described to Rep Lancia and Commissioner O'Rielly during their tour at E911 today. https://t.co/qPNd0dxshn
This is an untrue statement. The FCC has not written to our office. I asked Commissioner Rielly in our meeting earlier today if he sent anything on the off chance we missed it. He said FCC has not written. In fact, he acknowledged that RI proactively provides data/info to FCC. https://t.co/Z5rY34A1jT
For the record: Our office wasn't invited by Rep Lancia until 11:30am today. She's the Governor - she has a full schedule. She couldn't attend on such short notice. https://t.co/StH9cRy2GZ

@SailingTheOcean Looks like CT lost 118K from Jan 08 to Feb 10, which is roughly same rate of job loss as RI. 		Since start of 2015 (when GMR took office), CT has added 18,500 jobs (1.1% growth). In that time, RI has added 14,300 jobs (3% growth). 		(Still can‚Äôt get MA‚Äôs to load on iPhone.)
@SailingTheOcean Apologies. I checked the wrong dates. I‚Äôm deleting the prior tweet and will update.
Here‚Äôs one comparison, RI lost 31,600 jobs while Gary Sasse worked for GOP Gov. Don Carcieri (Jan 08 to Feb 10). Unemployment jumped from 6.3 to 11 under their approach. 		Sasse tenure	Jan 08: 487,900 jobs 	Feb 10: 456,300 jobs 		GMR	Jan 15: 483,400	Current job count: 497,700 https://t.co/qM73nGz8uc
@healthchick327 @kathyprojo @GovRaimondo @projo I'm sorry to hear that and I really hope it's not true. RI has come a long way, but there's certainly a long way still to go.

@sam_o_connell I'm not mad at the school at all. I'm mad that instead of taking action on gun violence at a national level, our kids have been forced to learn what "lock down" means at 6 years old.

@sam_o_connell I got madder and madder as she told me what it was it like. I was so upset I let her have chocolate milk.
Me: "How often do you have them?"	Her: "Not that much. Like once a month, I think."		[Not sure she's correct about the frequency, but the fact that it feels like once a month to her blows my mind.]
My 6yo brought up lock down drills without prompting today while we were waiting for lunch. I asked her what the drill was. She said, "It's when the teacher locks the door and tells us to hide in our cubbies and get as small as we can until the principal says we can come out."

We're preparing our kids for college. We're #14 in K-12. But we need to do more to help them graduate college on time. 4/
I agree with the @ProJo editorial board. (Shocking, I know.) These rankings show we can improve. 3/ https://t.co/dalCCTh1xh
But #46 in higher education, mostly because our kids don't finish school on time. 2/ https://t.co/2aj7MCH6Jj
Rhode Island is #8 in college readiness, #14 in K-12. 1/ https://t.co/2aj7MCH6Jj

PC v Creighton at 9:30pm on Thursday. Win or lose: I apologize in advance to my colleagues for my groggy demeanor on Friday morning.

20 wins should be enough but I have too many memories of being screwed by the selection committee. https://t.co/3CVcHiUiQy
In October, Providence was predicted to finish dead last in the Big East. Five months and 20 wins later... https://t.co/EgoOUo3bTO
20-11. 10-8 Big East. Still think we need one win at MSG next week to guarantee our ticket. #Friars
Correction. Meaningless game is on FOX. https://t.co/MWCsSkBddz
Lots of people in DC dressed as seats for the meaningless game @FoxSports is airing on @FS1 while Friars game is on FS2.
Hey @FOXSports, Georgetown's season's a literal dumpster fire. Friars game has very real tourney implications. Why isn't PC game on the app?
