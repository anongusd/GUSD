@LindaHirshman1 What did I ask?
@alexnazaryan I'm not setting the bar and you're adding quotes where I had none.  I'm making a comparison with Oval Office occupants, a seat she'd like. Yes, comb anecdote is abusive, nuts. Calling staff work "slop" and "worst in 20 years" Oh, please.
@alexnazaryan The accusations, which I know you're reported on and which i know from previous experience, are being presented not just to expose hypocrisy but to make her seem too angry/capricious to be president. By the way did she ever say I'm Minnesota nice or did others tout her as such?

Now they're on to a lavish praise of GHWB's top aide, Jean Becker. Again, nothing wrong with a sweet goodbye but at some point it becomes cloying which is neither fair to a president with many good qualities or the rest of us.
Looking forward, I imagine neither Clinton nor W. will get a sendoff this loving. Carter will probably fare better than those two...Watching MSNBC, @jmeacham just joked that "Saint Paul couldn't write letters the way this guy did." He meant it with good humor /7
is obvious. There's also the innate worship of old WASP money that I think clouds judgment. And to be fair Bush's war time heroism counts for a lot too. Bush's charming the media--see Maureen Dowd's piece the same week she wrote her 537th sneering piece on the Clintons. /6

And, of course, Willie Horton and the '88 race. But I'm surprised that the '92 race is being treated like he lost because of the virtue of modesty. No there were real problems formulating a domestic policy esp after he had the capital from the Gulf War. I could go on..../4
I'm surprised, though, by quite how hagiographic the coverage had been especially on cable news. And again I understand the emphasis on his good qualities but scant attention is being paid to his faults and challenges. There are the famiiar ones like '64 opposing the CRA /3
This tweet got a lot of reaction so I thought I'd elaborate into a threat. First, I think it's kind and welcome that GHWB gets a lovely send off. Much of the things said of him are true: the management of the end of the Cold War, the personal graciousness, the WW II heroism /2
@susanjones1968 Agree
@Will_Bunch Agree. Had Carter passed away last week we'd be getting a lot of that.
I knew there'd be a lot of love for GHWB this week. It's arguably a nice tradition that former presidents get a send off that emphasizes their better qualities but I've never seen any POTUS death this hagiographic

@bwolaver I think it was more of a mixed bag then and we'll see what happens in the future.
@jondschreiber You're right that the court is now often voting by party blocs which is different than just a few years ago when GOP appointees like Souter and Stevens voted with Dem appointees and White often voted with GOP. Abandoning even the appearance of a higher calling isn't good, IMHO.
There's a headline you don't see every day. https://t.co/mylQD2iYT3
The appearance of norms? Gone. Saluting the new justice. Remarking on a return to originalism. That would be normal. Treating the court as blocs, even if true, is a new precedent. End zone dance about president's opponent? Imagine W cheering Alito by bashing Gore/Kerry. https://t.co/0iO9RfBUTg

@juliaturner @Slate @latimes Congratulations, Julia!
Might need to reread Trilling's "Sincerity and Authenticity". I actually believe Heitkamp's statement was quite sincere as was, say, Corker in the last day solidifying behind K. I think they're really voting what they believe. And I don't know if that's good, bad or terrifying.
@bdzivi I actually think we're heading to a Pence-tie-breaker with Murkowski voting against so we shall see. Hiding is not a great look but it's probably better than the alternative.
@AmandaMarcotte I'll introduce you! Thanks for listening on this grim day.
@AmandaMarcotte You know more about this topic than do I and have more experiences with mysogeny than I can imagine.  I do know people, perhaps you do too--women, often; self-identified feminists; anti-Trumpers--who are convinced, wrongly but avowedly, that there is an epidemic of accusastions.
That would rally the troops. At this point if they've made no effort to get them to Washington, it'd be tough to pull off. https://t.co/gPRQmpuFAD
@AmandaMarcotte That's a very good and depressing analogy. Asking seriously: Could the Title XI have been conducted in a way to reassure the reasonable minded or semi reasonable minded that there are adequate protections against false accusations?
WIth @SenatorCollins saying she thought the FBI's latest round of questioning was thorough, it sounds like another strong indicator that she'll vote yes. Hard to see Kavanaugh not making it at this point. What can, should @SenateDems do at this point?
@proust1974 of course but even within those constraints it's odd not to invu ford, kavanaugh and others with knowledge of the ford and ramirez cases
@WajahatAli Yep....Manchin isn'tthe decider. Collins wants to vote yes. Heitkamp wants to keep her seat. Murk is most troubled. Pence gets to be conservative hero....

@DisorientedBlog I think he might well. I don't think they were going to rush overturning Roe but they might go slower on the chipping away at it. Depends on if BK gets on, I suppose.
@ValisJason makes sense
Yep. https://t.co/rcilIGuIAG
@AnnekeEGreen Good question. At the time he was confirmed, Roberts boarding school in Indiana came up a bit but only for how strait-laced it/he seemed. He seems pretty abstemious.
@ValisJason Could be. The role of chief is a special one and I bet the court's esteem weighs more heavily on him than if he were just another justice.
@Hammbear Agree. I'm not buying his balls-and-strikes-umpire rhetoric. He's okay with breaking china. But long term wants court to be admired and knows two accused justices is a lot for the institution to carry.
If you believe Roberts really cares about the credibility of the court--and many interepreted his vote for the ACA as an effort to avoid repeating the overreach of the SC during the New Deal--then this is a fascinating moment for him as much as for us. End /5
Can't help but think he might want another jurist at this point who wouldn't come to the court with the same baggage. But maybe not. He never overlapped with BK on the DC circuit so there's no tie there. /4
On a personal level, Roberts seems to have been a totally straight-laced kid, a hyperachiever with no use for the 100 Keg club. Is he personally offended or doesn't care? What does the think about in the pew at Little Flower? /3
On the other hand, he's an institutionalist and knows the Court's cred will take a big hit in the eyes of much of the public if BK is confirmed and esp when SC navigates abortion, women's rights, other issues /2
Really want to know what's going on in Chief Justice John Roberts head this week. On one hand, he's a conservative jurist whose selection was surely aided by Bush Staff Secretary Brett Kavanaugh /1
@BruceFeiler She was a professional for many years. His tenure was shorter than Gore's. But you make a good case!
@RonBrownstein As an institutionalist, Roberts would be much less likely to let that happen than he would have had BK not been embroiled in this. I subscribe to take that he upheld ACA precisely not to let the Court be dragged into New Deal era chaos. But you're right that if would be nuclear.

@wayne_nish Because I was referring to the only other case I could think of where a House member lost a Senate bid, was out of office, but had stirred such passion in his party that he was nominated for prez two years later. If you have another one, I'm happy to cite it.
@MichaelMcGough3 @Profepps @wallybongo I find that the "white" is often inserted almost reflexively, for all the reasons that Garrett mentions but I still find it distracting rather than germane from the arguments at hand. When the primary witnesses are both white. Also: Cruz might be called a POC by some.
@wayne_nish not in the way you’re implying.
@jonathanalter agree. In a way harder for him to run for potus if he beats Cruz. Dems would be unable to hold on to the senate seat.
Could @BetoORourke be a viable candidate for the 2020 Dem nomination even if he loses to @tedcruz?  Lincoln lost 1858 Senate bid.

@johnastoehr were smith to lose—and with 2 sen races, gov, and at least 4 contested house seats in a state Trump lost by 1.5%—that’s possible. And if Dems fail to capture the senate by a seat, you might not say that. Presumably you wanted Menendez out too. If you didn’t why?
@GoldenGirlsRule I believe af is best judge of what’s best for af. For the rest of us, the rush to rid is not good, imho.
@pithywidow @johnastoehr There is none, of course. There oughta be a la Menendez, Gerry Studds.
@johnastoehr leaving that aside-which is huge—Dems were only willing to expel if MN had a D governor. It was a moral principle with a very big clause. Also AF is probably best judge of what’s good for him and I can say that’s not his take.
@johnastoehr If MN had a GOP gov they wouldn’t have ousted AF—so much for principle. Did it believing seat was guaranteed which it isn’t. And it set bad due process precedent.

@LPeterP True....
@LPeterP That's the question, for me anyway. Is it a Stormy-only impeachment or not...
An impeachment that's about Avenatti/Daniels/Cohen/Campaign Finance could have the same trajectory as Clinton but money and coverups are probably more politically potent than lying in a civil deposition or to a prosecutor.
@flixboy True, dat.
As with Clinton, I think you might have enough to indict in the House and nowhere near enough in the Senate.
@Bencjacobs Precisely. Then as now I suspect there's just enough to impeach and not nearly enough for removal.
The question: Will crimes committed to cover up extramarital sex be enough to compel the House and Senate to impeach and remove a president? Will it take other crimes to achieve critical mass?

@tdyja @jttiehen I hear what you're saying. She did, of course, try to Goldwater him, doing versions of the Daisy ad. Yes re Spencer. That said, I still think humorous ridicule is a very effective weapon that's largely been left in the quiver. (Lincoln, Reagan, FDR, JFK, W Bush, Obama knew it
@MilliganSusan Let's hope not! I was just putting in a vote for humorous scorn.
@jttiehen Not sure if you're being ironic but I think there's actually something to that. Portraying Trump as nuts didn't prove a winning strategy for Hillary. He couldn't be Goldwatered. Mocking him as what Bill Maher calls a #whinylittlebitch might have been for advantageous.
@johnastoehr Perhaps "Fascist!" will prove the more effective argument. But I question its saliency with voters and it's less likely to rattle Trump than portraying him as an infant. Either way, I found London"s mocking tone more effective than the average NYT editorial.
@johnastoehr Implicit in the he's-a-fascist argument is the notion that he has the strength, determination, and guile to raze democracy.

@johnastoehr I'm not sure there's a single event that would cause a loss of credibility for everyone. @ErikWemple was wisely addressing the more immediate issue of how to deal with those who publicly claimed only a legislative change would work
@johnastoehr Sorry I thought I was responding to something else. It's always good to call out falsehoods, doublespeak.
@johnastoehr Depends what you mean by result. It contributes to establishing or reestablishing a norm that this is not ok. If you look at corporate weight thrown behind marriage equality, a more sweeping travel ban, etc, there's reason to think it might.

@sivavaid @CNN Yes, I know that. Again, what I wrote about was K street. And what I responded was that media will continue to talk to him and it was questionable what would happen going forward in terms of paying him.
@sivavaid @CNN True but corporations are already pushing back on this and I think lobbies and trade associations will respond. The media is another story but there's a difference between talking to CL or hiring him
Will K Street shun Lewandowski? Will any Trump influence peddlers suffer because of their defense of the separations? What trade association or publicly traded company would want to defend it when it's revealed?

@CharmaineYoest Love that.
@seanmdav Sean, the issue I addressed was adherence to DOJ guidelines on subpoenaing the press. I like the ones drawn up by John Mitchell and later revised. Worry they may have been disregarded here. Hope you favor a federal shield law like the one Mike Pence sponsored in House. Best, Matt

@nycsouthpaw That's odd in the extreme. No legal reason she couldn't.
The reason DOJ in Dem and GOP admins has tried to negotiate an agreemet w press is because a settlement can be found. Sources grant permission. (CIA leak case, moi) Gov gets info another way (suveillance) Data mining is supposed to be last resort. @aliwatkins persecution is scary

When Bush and Cheney Met Fitzgerald WH press sec Scott McClellan said POTUS "was pleased to do his part."
In general, White Houses have put up with special and independent counsels and grimmaced rather than go bonkers.
Remember that George W. Bush and even Dick Cheney met with special counsel Pat Fitzgerald with relatively little fuss. The WH wasn't crazy about Fitzgerald's zealous inquiry but the didn't throw tantrums either.
The Clinton White House hated and trashed Ken Starr but they didn't flip out over Robert Fiske, his predecessor, who was pulled off the case by a judicial panel led by a Helms ally, David Sentelle.
Recall that George W. Bush and even Dick Cheney met with special counsel Pat Fitzgerald with relatively little fuss. The WH wasn't crazy about Fitzgerald's zealous inquiry but the didn't throw tantrums either.

@PRDiva91 Thank you.
I should have done more to express my respect for a staff that tried hard and did great work. I apologize for that.
I know @NancyCooperNYC, the new editor of @Newsweek, to be a great newsroom leader both from the 1990s when we were at the magazine together and in her role at IBT. She's smart and has a big heart and I'm rooting for her and my former colleagues as we go forward.
This extends up and down the ranks to people I worked with closely to those I only knew as a byline or on a conference call.
Great reporters and great editors alike have left a tremendous body of good work. I've praised many by name in recent days but all deserve salutes for indefatigable work on the web and in the print magazine.
The @newsweek staff, those who've left in recent days and those who are staying on, are a tremendously talented and terrific group of reporters and editors who have done great work under some difficult circumstances.
