"The only reason we're up here talking about this is the election," says @realDonaldTrump after declaring a national emergency to pull additional funding to build his border wall when lawmakers - from both parties - gave him little under the $1.6b WH initially requested for FY19
"Didn’t sound too important to me" @realDonaldTrump says of the military construction funds he's taking under a national emergency declaration - funds that, by the way, go toward projects for housing and military families, for example.
So, @realDonaldTrump knows his national emergency "for virtual invasion purposes" will be challenged - "They will sue us in the 9th Circuit even though it shouldn’t be there … we’ll get a bad ruling and then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court and we’ll get a fair shake"

"I want people to come into our country-*in the largest numbers ever*-but they have to come in legally" Trump strays from prompter into falsehood as his policy often targets legal immigration: asylum seekers, refugees, permanent residents, green card, SIV, TPS, DACA, etc
RT @latimesnational: Trump will meet Kim Jong Un in Vietnam for 2nd nuclear summit https://t.co/Sp8OHa3E98
It is true that barriers can contribute to drop in crossings, and did, in San Diego and elsewhere - but in same time, Border Patrol staffing ramped-up dramatically, and Great Recession hit - few attribute solely to border fencing, &amp; most to economic downturn.
Despite EO, nearly $1b for some 50 miles of replacement fencing, &amp; more than $640 million for 25 miles of new levee fencing and other “to be determined” barriers, as of late January, no new miles of border barrier had been completed under Trump. https://t.co/Si0ZGIvNrS
"In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall -- but the proper wall never got built.  I'll get it built," @realDonaldTrump says in #SOTU - CBP has spent about $2.3 b between 2007-2015 to increase border barriers from 119 miles to 654 miles, according to @USGAO
Trump “big, beautiful wall” has turned into: precast or plank concrete, steel slats, see-thru, human, “matte black,” too tall to climb, too deep to tunnel under, paid for by Mexico, paid for by a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, already being built, just needs finishing
.@DHSgov has also begun forcing some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are considered in US - starting in Tijuana, one of the deadliest cities in the world, per @katelinthicum	https://t.co/tx0uSEOmUd - hardly protective
The Trump administration has sought to direct migrants to seek asylum only at official crossings, but U.S. officials have systematically delayed or prevented asylum seekers from making claims there https://t.co/NC8rTMZUtC
In November, a judge barred the Trump administration’s attempts to eliminate asylum claims made by migrants crossing into the U.S. between ports of entry.
In December, a federal judge deemed illegal a Trump administration policy that sought to block victims of gang and domestic violence from claiming asylum in the U.S. #sotu
The irony of concern for women migrants who become victims - Trump has displayed a bizarre, morbid fascination with “taped up” women being trafficked across the border, an act he describes as commonplace, though experts say no evidence for claims:  https://t.co/RVwjdxDg03
"Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel.  One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north." @realDonaldTrump says in #SOTU but experts say immigration policies endangering them
"Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border" *-- Reporter's note: Through ports of entry --* "and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl" (meaning some 99% wouldn't be stopped by wall)
"Smart strategic see-through barrier, not just a concrete wall" @realDonaldTrump says in #SOTU - a relatively recent rhetorical position, though John Kelly told Times in Dec - “To be honest, it’s not a wall" &amp; hadn't been from beginning https://t.co/bkxak7Djma
"I will never abolish our heroes from ICE" @realDonaldTrump says, apparently alluding to calls for ICE to be abolished stemming from outcry over "zero tolerance" &amp; family separation. And yet, can't even fill vacancies he's got: https://t.co/VPgJ3iSCBB
Hard to square scare tactics with description of "humanitarian crisis"-No evidence Central American families &amp; minors fleeing gang violence have increased MS-13’s numbers north of the border. Only a fraction of unaccompanied minors apprehended since 2011 have confirmed gang ties.
PS: Vast majority of MS-13 coming over southern border? MS-13 was founded in Los Angeles, &amp; exported to El Salvador with deportations. Still US membership less than 1 percent of approximately 1.4 million gang members nationwide.
On Trump's fave fear mongering on MS-13, which WH says poses more serious threat than any designated transnational criminal organization - even Mexican cartels &amp; terrorist groups - fed has estimated for more than a decade that MS-13’s American membership has remained at about 10k
"We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens," Trump says in #SOTU - implying immigration=danger/crime. Research doesn't support this, border cities among safest in US, immigrants less likely than citizens to commit crimes
"I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught" - Trump says, on already announced fresh deployment (bringing total # to where it was in Nov) Military legally barred from conducting law enforcement in US https://t.co/LibaLzs5mF
"Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration" - Illegal immigration at historic lows, cut by more than half since 2000s - https://t.co/hK5AhUw4OQ - if zero is metric, experts say impossible
"The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border," Trump to say - yet border security impasse that shut down gov for longest period in US history (leaving thousands of border workers unpaid) remains.
"Nearly 5m Americans have been lifted off food stamps" Trump says-&amp; yet administration wants to make changes to public benefits  so that if applicants use any-even for US citizen child-could mean they're "public charge" blocked from legal permanent status https://t.co/N2lFAAoXGw
This line (prepared remarks): "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way!"
"To create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, &amp; secure" Trump says in #SOTU -yet many of his immigration policies-blocking asylum between ports of entry (as law allows) &amp; for victims of domestic/gang violence, ending TPS-have been blocked or mired in litigation

And while we're here, let's just get started talking about walls. In recent days, Trump has started to shift his political messaging from the “build a wall” of his 2016 rallies to “finish the wall,” a concession he has not been able to make good on a signature pledge. #SOTU
"As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars." Trump to say, per prep remarks   - but he, Obama and others before have found, saying you'll end the endless war, whether on Twitter or in SOTU, lot easier than actually ending.
“Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.” -Trump prep remarks		Oft-trotted out line, but show me the politicians literally advocating for open borders.
“No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s WORKING CLASS and America’s POLITICAL CLASS than illegal immigration.” (-Trump prep remarks) which, turns out, is at historic lows - 2018: 400k apprehensions. 1980s-mid-2000s: more than 1 million a year.
“We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens,” Trump will say, according to prep remarks. (1st of many factchecks on "protects": Studies show immigration doesn't lead to increased crime, immigrants less likely to commit.)

Yes, a Pakistani or Somali asylum seeker, believing cannot get refugee status, may use fake docs, almost guaranteed to use smuggler, to get to US-MX border. That does not make them terrorists. 10/ https://t.co/tgJidsLWMj
Well, yeah! We are talking about cross-continental migration, incentivized, in part, by closed pathways amid fear mongering against refugees, &amp; resulting in a huge payday for increasingly sophisticated smugglers. 9/ https://t.co/1xFNZR5uqc

Besides the fact that it has yet to be addressed how $5.7b for a wall would resolve these concerns, myself &amp; many reporters have been asking for years for the evidence for these national-security-border-crisis claims. This isn’t it. 5/ https://t.co/S6s5xka0HJ

@Jodi_Hilton Another backstory: In Istanbul when news broke Jamal Khashoggi disappeared in Saudi consulate then that he was killed. Had interviewed him for a story not yet pubbed just before I went to Saudi in Oct 2018
Backstory: Having great partner like @Jodi_Hilton absolutely essential. Yet many editors make no connection between low pay or no expenses &amp; a reporter's safety - or, at most cynical, a publication's reputation if something happens. I'm lucky (&amp; lucky to have had HEFAT, at least)
My latest, cover @Newsweek last week, timely with Trump tweeting would pull US troops out of Syria, as this Syrian Kurdish refugee family in Turkey and many others feared amid pressure for them to return. 7/ https://t.co/G4EwxlvlX1
Backstory: Took me yr+ after @IWMF trip, ~20 countries &amp; other projects in between. Esp when you're often editors' lowest priority, I found balancing travel, reporting, &amp; writing really hard. Almost out of $ at this point, with credit card &amp; student debt. Filed from Bulgaria.

Backstory: Went in with simple question: What is it like growing up girl in El Salvador? Reinforced why women journalists need to support each other despite pressure. Fully funded by @IWMF &amp; great editing yet among worst pay.

Backstory: Many, many questions in Nigeria - including from fixer - about why we don't pay people we interview. (Despite others reportedly doing so.) Many US pubs with 1, maybe 2, staff correspondents for all of Africa, but as freelance made - maybe - 1/4 of reporting costs.
Jan'18 Nigerians return from slavery in Libya to thriving sex-trafficking industry back home @washingtonpost - some of hardest reporting I've done, with officials charged with protecting vulnerable returnees exploiting them, but career goal achieved	https://t.co/o5xOqeMVVG 3/
Backstory: Took me ~1r, &amp; I could not have done it without @IWMF - at the time, not yet freelance, I was pressured to use vacation for a fully-funded reporting trip to Chiapas. I had a great editor in @coracurrier &amp; @theintercept pays among best I've found - &amp; has *factcheckers*!

@DLind @JohnCornyn Thanks, but that's not what he said, why I wanted to clarify. He said getting Mexico to offer Central Americans asylum would be WH coup. Important people know asylum claims in Mexico have already been skyrocketing. That's separate from *not allowing* people to claim asylum in US

Most, in fact, will go to the port of entry directly to claim asylum. Where are the resources being into processing them there, as WH guidance calls for, rather than disincentivizing it by intentionally making people wait indefinitely? 5/
... also because shutting down traffic lanes and putting up wire there addresses a non-existent problem. Nobody is crossing illegally *right next to the port of entry* — the (relatively speaking) few that do will go way east for that. 4/
As noted, 1 of busiest crossings in the world. Recent (unrelated) construction a) caused *hours* of delays b) was designed to *improve* traffic - making hellish commute worse &amp; negatively impacting $$$ in cross-border commerce by shutting down lanes not popular with anyone. 3/

RT @declanwalsh: Big welcome to our new Beirut-based @nytimes correspondent, the talented @VivianHYee
Will say it again: If @realDonaldTrump doesn't like US asylum law, he can try to change it (though a bit harder now that Dems have taken House &amp; GOP no longer controls both chambers.) But it's admin violating the law here, not those claiming asylum at US-MX border. END
Clear intent of guidance is to force Mexico to be 'safe third country,' stuck w/asylum seekers-ie Central Americans-WH doesn't want. Thousands stuck in chaotic limbo in already unstable Mexican border cities clearly works against US 'national security' 5/ https://t.co/lvYc7Kz8w5
On 'strain' to 'already taxed' system: For more than 6 months @WhiteHouse has *not* resourced processing at ports of entry at southern border (or used existing), violating law by not allowing people to claim asylum. Still no sign surging resources now contravening own guidance 4/
Many who cross the border between ports of entry turn themselves in *immediately* to authorities to claim asylum. And coming to the US border to claim asylum is not in &amp; of itself any violation of US or other statute, it is in fact *following the law.* 3/
@WhiteHouse White House touts the refugee program, even as it insists that immigrants stay home &amp; apply for refugee status. But it resettled less than half of its 45,000 refugee ceiling in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. It admitted only 62 Syrians, of largest refugee pop in the world. 2/

Say: Record levels of violence, corruption, poverty, lack of opportunity, US-exported gangs + militarized police in Northern Triangle? https://t.co/ICZ0yFtl1E Then, the only way to keep people from claiming asylum is resolving reason why they need asylum in the first place. (7/)
Let's for a moment imagine perhaps increase in asylum claims is not mass fraud (which WH also hasn't given evidence of) but instead reflective of genuine need, shifting demographics of migration to the US-MX border, &amp; evolving push factors in Central America (&amp; elsewhere)? (6 /)
RT @EricM_Katz: Senior admin official says: "We will be able to see and adjudicate more of these more rapidly...We are working through the…
And as for national security justification -WH has yet to provide basis for how asylum seekers &amp; lower immigration threaten national security. Rule text says "surge" justifies exception to asylum because would divert resources from CT/HomelandSecurity. That's pretty meta. (5/)
Does this mean they'll be increasing asylum processing resources at ports of entry, where DHS claims they're already at capacity (&amp; thus can only process handfuls a day if that)? (4/)
The Trump administration has been illegally denying people who arrive at ports of entry the chance to claim asylum https://t.co/lvYc7Kz8w5 - So yet again, this is as much about legal entry as illegal entry.  (3/)
Ok yes, so: U.S. law clearly states anyone reaching the U.S. can claim asylum, regardless of how they entered, legally or illegally (doesn't mean they'll get asylum, of course.) (2/ )

7. Lastly, not to be missed: In notice to Congress of $20m payout, Trump admin noted Mexico would also deport "known or suspected" terrorist unauthorized immigrants-again invoking national security, though WH(/MX) has never provided evidence for terrorist-MXborder-crosser concern
6. Latest among decisions to 'reprogram' $200m aid for Palestinians, $230m Syria reconstruction, &amp; $200m+ moved from other agencies-incl $10m from FEMA-to ICE for detention/removal, @StateDept &amp; @DHSgov basically telling Congress 'we know better' by directing $ diff than intended
Why this matters bigly: 5. Could be key toward Trump WH goal to make Mexico 'safe third country' b/c it bypasses US adjudication of asylum seekers by having Mexico process deportations instead, before they arrive to claim asylum at US border https://t.co/lvYc7Kz8w5
4. And this could be the biggest: While Obama admin too paid Mexico to effectively outsource deportations, ironic that MX-bashing @realDonaldTrump to pay Mexico $20 mil to deport up to 17k, mostly Central Americans https://t.co/B2IoeYYRn1

Biggest question to me is, as with DHS and US national-security state: How many of these changes, shifts, become permanent, beyond Trump, by sheer inertia? (END)
Loved part about 'ICE Air'-but no mention of how much eagerness to demonstrate will deport anyone, anywhere, costs: The cost of such flights from the United States — on ave more than $8,000 an hour for charters — is borne entirely by American taxpayers. https://t.co/J8us1n20ni 7/
“'You numb yourself by saying everything we do has a national-security focus'...No immigrant from the region has ever committed a terrorist attack on US soil" @realDonaldTrump claim cracking down on Central American migrants b/c natsec akin to 'soft on terror' pol tactics 6/
ICE role in internal enforcement separate from CBP, &amp; tension btw ICE ERO &amp; HSI without distinguishing enough what their roles are. It matters because the public should have better understanding of what massive DHS does, not less, when politics divided around "abolish ICE" 5/
One weakness - Article/headline paints over "everything is ICE" b/c current political climate does so, only flicking at: How CBP primarily carried out "zero tolerance" &amp; family separations, USCIS role in adjudicating asylum &amp; revamping 'denaturalization' initiative 4/
"A small part of a global push by the State Department to remove any diplomatic obstacles to deportation" — much of what has come under aggressive expansion &amp; flex of DHS authority is *foreign* policy, not *domestic* politics, but State Dept role has been overshadowed 3/
Interesting &amp; important he focused on immigrants with varied status in the United States, from Africa, &amp; not just recent arrivals, or Latinos — many have more 'typical' refugee/asylum cases, been here for decades, challenging shifting WH justifications for broader crackdown 2/

The @realDonaldTrump policy and ultimate goal has been clearly stated and reiterated over and over in action and word: End both illegal and legal immigration, including obtaining asylum, refugee status, the visa lottery, etc etc., regardless of law.
@SecNielsen If @realDonaldTrump policy really is people should cross legally at ports of entry and claim asylum there 1. why separate families who do so? 2. why not put more resources at the border to process them? otherwise actually incentivizing illegal crossing (3/)
@SecNielsen In meantime, asylum seekers - including those with very, very young children, pregnant, etc - in very vulnerable situations in shelters, and Mexico forced to take them, in a de-facto "first country of asylum" policy Mexico City never agreed to (2/)
.@SecNielsen is disingenuous. They are separating families after people have claimed asylum at ports of entry. I was just in TJ last week, and others who'd tried to go through port of entry to claim asylum had waited 6+ months, number never being called, starting over, etc. (1/)
Here's a few reasons why a family may send a child alone - or travel with them - to U.S. border, despite danger, including to save their lives. El Salvador's Gangs Are Targeting Young Girls @TheAtlantic https://t.co/qwY5YkedAm
Not separating families who claim asylum at ports of entry -@SecNielsen What about DRC woman whose child was taken away, subject of @ACLU lawsuit? (Also, Spanish wouldn't be useful for her - note *global* migrants, not just LatAm, coming to US-MX border) https://t.co/DKYMPDmRAv
But wait, I thought the family separation policy didn't apply to asylum seekers, and was not intended as a deterrent to asylum seekers, as @SecNielsen tweeted yesterday - then why highlight asylum law as a "loophole"?

Ok just 1 more: I was in Tijuana last week, &amp; routinely men refugees there(many w/legit claims)said women &amp; kids only ones w/hopes of asylum in US. Another way to look at it:Cutting off one of few remaining avenues (however narrow) for anyone to get asylum/legally immigrate to US
Lastly, it undermines Trump WH justification of immigration crackdown as nat'l security, &amp; rhetoric suggesting (falsely) that Central American migrants to US are all bloodthirsty, male, MS13, by acknowledging-perversely-many are women domestic/gang violence victims seeking asylum
And such a move (formally claiming domestic/gang violence no longer grounds) is likely to have opposite of its intended effect, discouraging *legal* immigration but encouraging *illegal* immigration (5/)
It is a move specifically targeting Central American migration, because it is countries like El Salvador where women uniquely face a combination of femicide, machismo, and domestic and gang violence. El Salvador has the third-highest rate of violent death for women (4/)
I wrote about this in @TheAtlantic with reporting from El Salvador, where the gangs specifically target young girls and women — (3/) https://t.co/qwY5YkedAm
@washingtonpost It was already *extremely* difficult to obtain asylum in US on grounds of domestic or gang violence - including under the Obama administration - particularly if you are from Central America, where it's endemic (2/ )
