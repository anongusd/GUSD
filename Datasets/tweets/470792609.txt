Chakrabarti is also no longer at BNC PAC but said he IS still the owner of the Brand New Congress LLC, which basically functioned as a vendor to the PAC. ‚ÄúYeah technically, though there‚Äôs been no activity in the LLC since I think end of 2017. I think basically November of 2017.‚Äù

(Brand New Congress PAC, btw, has had a total restructuring of its leadership, and per Day none of the current leadership was in place when Roberts was hired. They scrambled today to connect with Roberts and other people involved in his hiring to check on some specifics.)
‚ÄúThey needed someone to run their fundraising program for the next couple of months, just as a holdover,‚Äù Chakrabarti, who per his LinkedIn helped found both Justice Dems and Brand New Congress, told me about how Roberts ended up working for the PAC.
Per AOC‚Äôs Chief of Staff, @saikatc, Roberts was brought in when Brand New Congress PAC, Brand New Congress LLC, and Justice Democrats separated, and a lot of the BNC staff went to work for JD.
Per FEC filings, he was paid $3000 monthly, which Day argued was ‚Äúin line with industry standards as presented by the Bureau and of Labor and Statistics, Glass Door, and [others]."
Per Zeynab Day, a spox for Brand New Congress PAC, Roberts was hired from 8/3/17 for a two-month ‚Äútrial period‚Äù and worked through the end of Sept. Here‚Äôs what he did:	-advertised strategies for potential growth	-developed metrics	-aided in increasing brand awareness for the PAC
And then, on Roberts getting paid by the Brand New Congress PAC:
Per AOC spox Corbin Trent, AOC‚Äôs partner, Riley Roberts, has no official role in the office, nor is he on her congressional office‚Äôs payroll. Trent says Roberts is credentialed the way other congressional spouses are, and they are not married.
I spoke with Corbin Trent, AOC‚Äôs spox, her Chief of Staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, and Zeynab Day, a spokesperson for Brand New Congress PAC. Here‚Äôs how they explain things:

When I asked Pelosi‚Äôs office what the reason for choosing the less-severe option was, they just referred me to Clyburn.		Clyburn‚Äôs reasoning was that he didn‚Äôt think the House should be censuring members for something said to a reporter.
I asked Rush about Clyburn‚Äôs resolution last night. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his voice. That‚Äôs not my voice. That‚Äôs his voice,‚Äù he told me. https://t.co/MNPICkuHE0
‚ÄúThis resolution just restates the obvious.  It does not address Steve King‚Äôs violent, vitriolic, and rabid racism.  This Democratic resolution is an insult to the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. as we recognize his birthday,‚Äù Rush says in statement.
In statement, Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush says he won‚Äôt vote for the Steve King resolution of disapproval and will instead keep pushing for censure (which is a more severe response to his comments).
In Clyburn‚Äôs whipline email, the quote of the day is from MLK Jr.:	‚ÄúWe are going to be made to repent, not just for the hateful words and deeds of bad people, but for the appalling silence of good people.‚Äù https://t.co/iaExua7ZG4

And complete silence from Steve King to questions from reporters.
Clyburn tells reporters he had not spoken with Pelosi about what he‚Äôs going to do. Said he won‚Äôt go as ‚Äúfar‚Äù as to censure Steve King.
Pelosi on Friday said "there are other people in this administration who have said things as bad as Steve King has said." 	She added: "We‚Äôll see what we do about Steve King.  But, nonetheless, nothing is shocking anymore, right?"
Does Speaker Pelosi wants to censure Steve King? Per her office: "There‚Äôs not been a decision on how to deal with this."

Rand Paul gave a different explanation (leverage): "There's more of an ability to have strength in the negotiations‚Äî if you dwindle it down to one item of gov't, I think there's less ability to really have the strength it takes to have a negotiation."
Shelby (who said he wouldn't support that) said that McConnell wouldn't bring everything but DHS up anyway, but even if he did, Republicans are operating under assumption Trump would veto it: "So why waste your time, my time, and give false hope to something?"
If you're a federal worker thinking, hey! My department has nothing to do w/ the wall! Why can't we open the rest of the gov't up at least? Here's what Sen. Shelby said about that coming up today: "That was a little noise, but no real‚Äî nothing to that. It's not going anywhere."

Peter Welch turns around and gives a big thumbs up to the freshmen members behind him when Pelosi calls them a "transformative" class.
"We enter this new Congress with a sense of great hope and confidence for the future, and deep humility and prayerfulness in the face of the challenges ahead," Pelosi says. "Our nation is at an historic moment. Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn."
Pelosi: "I am particularly proud to be the woman Speaker of the House of this Congress, which marks 100 years of women having the right to vote." This was followed by clapping, and then a standing ovation when Pelosi went on to say there are more than 100 women in House.

A couple of the Dems some people have voted for instead of Pelosi: Cheri Bustos, Joe Kennedy, John Lewis, Joe Biden. (Bustos and Kennedy both shook their heads and smiled when it happened to them.)
There was also a round of applause for Deb Haaland when she voted for Pelosi as "the first Native American woman to vote on this floor."

Hakeem Jeffries just nominated Pelosi as speaker, and Pelosi immediately gets standing ovation from the Dem side of the House. (Republicans stay sitting and don't clap.)
In addition to having all nine grandchildren on the floor or in the gallery, Pelosi has her kids here and a couple of special guests, including: Tony Bennett and Susan Benedetto, Mickey Hart (of the Grateful Dead, AKA Bay-area representation) and Caryl Hart, and Tim Gunn

The man sitting next to me on why he went: ‚ÄúI was thinking there must be some economist named Daniels. But I got here and it‚Äôs someone else.‚Äù (He stayed.)
I asked one woman before the interview whether she had ever heard of Stormy Daniels outside of Donald Trump story. ‚ÄúOh no, I‚Äôd never heard of her before. Why would I have heard of her- I don‚Äôt move in those circles.‚Äù
In a question about feminism, Stormy Daniels highlights that while the decision she says she made to sleep with Trump was "regrettable," it was consensual. She didn't want to Me Too label applied to this situation.
"How fucked up is that, yo?" Stormy says when Quinn points out that Stormy Daniels, the porn star, has flipped the tables on the president of the United States and is the one driving a conversation about ethics, etc.

It's a little toasty and crowded in here, btw. Someone in the back evidently just fainted.
The audience, by the way, is loving this. And the back and forth conversation between Sally Quinn and Stormy Daniels is great.
Daniels on the whole spanking Trump with a magazine thing says it wasn't a sexual thing, and that's what everyone gets wrong. "Oh fuck, I have to spank this guy now because I'm not backing down. And really from that moment on he was normal."
"I was promised food, which I still haven't gotten," Stormy Daniels says about the night she says she had sex with Trump.
‚ÄúPorn is about what looks good, and home sex is about what feels good," Daniels answers when asked about how she separates her work from personal life.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve watched Stormy‚Äôs porn. It‚Äôs very good. She knows what she‚Äôs doing.‚Äù ‚ÄîSally Quinn
This interview is bringing up a lot that's covered in her book, but that you don't see in coverage of Stormy Daniels. For example, there's a section in the book where she talks about being sexually assaulted when young. She says no when asked if she talked to a therapist about it

And regarding West's salary, the Ethics Committee is going to "require" Meadows "reimburse the U.S. Treasury for the overpayment of Mr. West, in the amount of $40,625.02."
The House Ethics Committee, btw, did not approve of these "restrictions." 		"An environment where only male staff have access to the Chief of Staff risks unequal treatment of employees based solely on sex," they say in the report.
Even after Meadows put in place unsuccessful "restrictions" to "separate [West] from the female staff," he kept him on, and it wasn't until Speaker Ryan's office got involved in April 2015 that West was removed as COS. But even then he was merely demoted to a "Senior Advisor."
Per the report, after Meadows was made aware of the allegations, he arranged for an independent investigation. But even once that investigation was complete, Meadows ignored the recommendation to fire West. West kept his salary and responsibilities in the months that followed.
The committee "found Representative Meadows violated House rules by failing to take appropriate steps to ensure that his House office was free from discrimination and any perception of discrimination."
The House Ethics Committee also released a report on Rep. Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, on his handling of allegations against his former chief-of-staff, Kenny West, made by female staffers.
And, for those wondering, as "the Committee has noted previously, reproval by the Committee is 'intended to be a clear public statement of rebuke of a Member‚Äôs conduct issued by a body of that Member‚Äôs peers acting . . . on behalf of the House of Representatives.'"
The report says the committee could have "sought harsher sanctions" against Kihuen, but "the Committee found that reproval is an appropriate sanction for the instant violations."
"Representative Kihuen now appears to better understand the effects that a power imbalance can have..." 		He did not run for reelection following the allegations against him: https://t.co/UDRkGcoGgg
Kihuen "repeatedly downplayed his actions" when speaking to the committee, but "in his written response to the ISC‚Äôs Report, he apologized to the complainants and acknowledged that his actions may have been perceived in ways other than what he intended."
Something that you may have noticed when there were a lot of Me Too stories coming out were similarities among allegations. This report about Kihuen notes that the similarities "bolster the credibility of the complainants."
The report says Kihuen "generally denied the allegations of unwanted advances. Despite Representative Kihuen‚Äôs denials, each of the complainant‚Äôs allegations were supported by documentary evidence and some of the alleged incidents were corroborated by third party witnesses."
Three women testified before the committee that looked into this "that Representative Kihuen made unwanted physical and verbal advances towards them between 2013 and 2017."
.@KateNocera and @tparti were the ones who broke the story about a woman who accused Kihuen of sexually harassing her. https://t.co/ioRkzokVkX https://t.co/zNWvv5AaWs
In report released today, the House Ethics Committee found Rep. Kihuen "made persistent and unwanted advances towards women who were required to interact with him as part of their professional responsibilities."

Amash appears to be the lone Republican "no" as vote closes.
Other Dem no's: Beto O'Rourke, Grijalva, Gutierrez, Crowley.	Justin Amash is the only Republican no I see so far.	Pelosi voted "present."
OK here we go. A couple of early votes on the support ICE resolution:	"Present" from Jayapal and Pocan. 	No from Espaillat, a Dem. 	A lot of green yeses from Republicans, obvi.
McCarthy on floor right now closing out debate directly addressing the "abolish ICE" bill introduced by Democrats before this "support ICE" resolution. Pocan and Jayapal, who introduced the abolish ICE one, have been sitting together on the floor throughout this debate.
Nancy Pelosi on the floor called this resolution a "political stunt." 		"I want to remind everyone that Democrats have been strong on protecting our borders all along."
"Democrats support secure voters," Hoyer says on floor immediately after. He says he'll be voting present, so expect to see that when vote takes place in a bit.
