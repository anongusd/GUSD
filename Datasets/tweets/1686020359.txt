@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama On this issue of fact, I am open to correction with the presentation of relevant evidence. https://t.co/zfGd3ZBjdZ
@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama What is the second problem? It pertains to an issue of fact. President Obama (as president) did not call "an end to MEK support" (a.k.a. "a program that had been lawfully ended") with respect to what was our MEK status quo up to the end of his second term. https://t.co/2rjhTONXbd
@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama #TeamPatriot affiliates look at other people (like Senator McConnell, for instance) as ethically and/or legally compromised for persistent support of MEK. Yet, Senator McCain's support occurred (in an ongoing way) during the same time frame. We are back to my inconsistency theme.
@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama Regarding #4 and #5 in your thread, Senator McCain had been supporting MEK through and during 2017 (and presumably during 2018 until his death), beginning before 2017. President Obama left office in January of 2017. There are two problems going for #TeamPatriot affiliates here.
@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain #TeamPatriot affiliates have expressed negative views on certain aspects of MEK (as such) that clearly transcend specific shifts in American foreign policy. Ample discussion of Senator McCain's support of MEK will not be found within, among, and/or across the relevant Tweets.

@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama @ericgarland @RT_com @washingtonpost @MichaelCohen212 @nadinevdVelde See my previous Tweets to you this evening. The video that I had posted clearly shows that you were NOT on the "Trump Train." There was no lying by me (again, I was citing the title of the video as uploaded). I did not post a "fake video"--it is based upon actual video material.
@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama @ericgarland @RT_com @washingtonpost @MichaelCohen212 https://t.co/5gU8JpmWRC
@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama @ericgarland @RT_com @washingtonpost @MichaelCohen212 Now, your posting of this other video is helpful. It does indicate basically the same notions as the video that I had posted (with respect to the "Trump Train"). https://t.co/QlxcDT3NvR
@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama @ericgarland @RT_com @washingtonpost @MichaelCohen212 The video that you posted here is not from the same video material as the video that I had posted. See Tom Teodorczuk's clothing and the seating arrangement in both videos. https://t.co/klLudzcHBD
@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama @ericgarland @RT_com @washingtonpost @MichaelCohen212 I will grant your contesting of the title of the video. However, again, the content of the video is the content of the video. For any reasonable viewer of the video, it is definitively clear that you were NOT on the "Trump Train." https://t.co/mHeNac6Wm1

@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama @ericgarland @RT_com @washingtonpost @MichaelCohen212 Again, I simply provided the title of the video as it is listed on YouTube by whomever uploaded it to YouTube. Across my thread, you can see this citation protocol for a number of Tweets. You should also look to my words in the thread with respect to my actual areas of focus.
@Daliny3 @LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger No, it has not. With specificity and clarity, I will be continuing this engagement with Louise Mensch soon, particularly with respect to important themes in my thread. I do appreciate her clarity and specificity on items that pertain to my thread, including factual issues.

@Daliny3 @WarfareNavel @JustAGirl515 @patribotics @RDSWEB @mfa_russia @SecretService @FBI @traffictweets I brought some classical rhetorical concepts to the table. These are still utilized (and always relevant) across academic disciplines. I will be applying these concepts more substantively. Per your words, I could apply some modern communication research in a specific way too.
@JulieAnnLily @LouiseBagshawe @FBIWFO @andynowacki I am not even Russian in terms of ethnicity and/or nationality, as far as I know. My main hobby is amateur genealogy.

@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain My focus at that point in the thread was about inconsistency among #TeamPatriot affiliates. Look at that phase of the thread closely in relation to the larger thread.

@LouiseBagshawe @LouiseMensch @wakingtiger @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @senatemajldr @BarackObama @ericgarland @RT_com @washingtonpost The inconsistency claim on my part has to do with how persons are looked at in terms of affiliations, viewpoints, appearances, etc.

@TkoProgressives Please follow the thread over the days and weeks ahead. I welcome your suggestions, corrections, refutations, etc. There is much more for me to write in this thread. Thank you for sharing your thoughts!

As we know, communicative activity on Twitter can move quickly. With respect to my own overall schedule (professional and personal), please understand that I will move through this thread (including replies) at a varying pace, depending upon the circumstances.
For my citing of primary/secondary sources, please note that my sharing of items is not necessarily an endorsement of all content (including advertisements). This will include items from people on Twitter with whom I have theological, philosophical, and/or political differences.
@WarfareNavel Thank you for your greeting. Please follow this thread over the days and weeks ahead. I welcome any reasonable conversation (agreements or disagreements). Have a great Saturday!
Regarding rhetoric, we can consider appeals to logos, ethos, and pathos (Aristotle). We can look to the forensic, epideictic, and deliberative genres of rhetoric (Aristotle). We have invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery as the five canons of rhetoric (Cicero).
Using "psychological operation" as a term calls to mind conspiracy theories, intelligence activities, etc., which are legitimate considerations of course. However, since we are dealing human communication, the ancient art of rhetoric is always on the table of analysis.
Over time, if my view changes along these lines (#TeamPatriot hashtag not connected to a psychological operation), I will make that clear. For the time being, I will write in this thread (and in replies) with respect to my current viewpoint.
I hold the view (held by some individuals for various reasons) that the #TeamPatriot hashtag is connected to a psychological operation. At present, I don't know by whom/for what. Argumentation will follow. #Twitter #PsyOp #PsyOps #MAGA #TCOT #QAnon #WWG1WGA #Resist #TheResistance

@spopslee @20committee @911CORLEBRA777 @FDRLST Even with the efforts and sacrifices of NATO soldiers in Afghanistan (and we should honor those soldiers), it is legitimate to ask the following question: Across NATO countries, going forward, are the funding commitments, requirements, and promises of defense resources adequate?
RT @realDonaldTrump: My people just informed me that this is one of the worst storms to hit the East Coast in many years. Also, looking lik…
@20committee @911CORLEBRA777 You have consistently argued that NATO countries need to spend more on defense (https://t.co/4wkqQdB4N0 and https://t.co/8yTWqafzFx @FDRLST). Why shouldn't President Trump push for more spending by NATO countries on defense? Per your Tweet, of course, we should commend Poland!

@patribotics @RDSWEB @mfa_russia @SecretService @FBI @RDSWEB and I have been engaging for some time with the #OSINT hashtag (and other hashtags)--this is pretty transparent. Such hashtags are helpful for finding and sharing resourceful Twitter accounts and posts with respect to research and analysis for OSINT, SOCMINT, etc.
@TheNewTiresias @LouiseBagshawe @SecretService @TwitterSupport @TwitterGov @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @LouiseMensch There is a celebratory anticipation with the hashtag as a general matter. A certain type of morbidity lurks. I am not saying that it is of the same kind or degree with every Tweet that has used #TrumpEpitaphs along the way.
@LouiseBagshawe @JerryCurl16 @TheNewTiresias @SecretService @TwitterSupport @TwitterGov @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @LouiseMensch Can it be said that such comments portray a lack of authentic commitment to a serious focus on President Trump being tried in a court of law to receive whatever punishment the law allows? Again, we differ on the Trump presidency, but I am considering your overall point of view.
@LouiseBagshawe @TheNewTiresias @SecretService @TwitterSupport @TwitterGov @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @LouiseMensch We differ on the question of the Trump presidency. I will not write here about his soul. I would have the same concerns about a hashtag like #TrumpEpitaphs (in the way that it is being used) for any person, regardless of their political affiliations, policies, and ideas.
@TheNewTiresias @LouiseBagshawe @SecretService @TwitterSupport @TwitterGov @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @LouiseMensch Is the #TrumpEpitaphs hashtag really the best form of comedy? Is it involving the world's best comedians? To what extent is it indicative of actually challenging ideas and policies as opposed to anticipating President Trump's death in a celebratory way?
@patribotics The social role of satire, parody, mockery, and ridicule notwithstanding (generally speaking, regardless of one's political biases), the use and concept of the #TrumpEpitaphs hashtag is definitely imprudent and potentially dangerous with respect to the safety of President Trump.
