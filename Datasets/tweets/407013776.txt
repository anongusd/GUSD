Rep. Kaptur comes by the Senate to check in on negotiations between Schumer and McConnell, somewhat surprised to find they are sitting in their own offices and not hanging out together
Senate Chaplain Barry Black, in his morning prayer, prayed for the Senate to be rescued "from the pitfalls of partisan brinkmanship."

We "heard the president say very specific things about what he would or wouldn’t do. There’s a very reasonable chance that he and Schumer can find common ground,” Perdue said.		“We woke up this morning thinking nothing is happening,” Gardner added. "We’ve opened up this door"
Obviously, this didn't come together in time. The government is officially in partial shutdown mode. But Perdue, Gardner, Corker and Flake think they've cleared a path for quick action if Schumer/Trump cut a deal. Many think they are close
Sens. Perdue and Gardner then dialed up Muvaney, Pence on line, too. Dispatched to the Hill within 15 minutes to talk to Schumer.		“Mitch is not going to negotiate with Schumer because he doesn’t know if he can depend on what the president’s bottom line will be," Perdue said
As Senate GOP fretted about Trump's opaque position today, Sen. Gardner's phone rang. It was the president saying he was ready to compromise: “We’re going to get this done, we’re going to get this fixed." https://t.co/Qtnn52APeI

Schumer, of course, hasn’t wanted to compromise on the wall for months. But after a tough election cycle with lots of moderates up, neither did anyone in the caucus

"The Swetnick thing is a joke. It's a farce," Kavanaugh says. 		Would you like to say more about it? 		"No," Kavanaugh says.
Kavanaugh says he does not have advance knowledge of the Qs Rachel Mitchell is going to ask
“If the mere assertion of an allegation, a refuted allegation from 36 years ago is enough to destroy a persons life … we’ve abandoned the principles of due process," Kavanaugh says.
"I love teaching law. But thanks to what some members on this side of the committee unleashed, I may never be able to teach again," Kavanaugh says. "I may never be able to coach again"
"Renate alumnus" refers to showing affection to a friend, which he says showed "she was one of us...I'm so sorry to her for that year book reference."
"I drank beer with my friends. Almost everyone did ... I liked beer. I still like beer. But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out," Kavanaugh explains. He "fully" embraces drinking beer
“The calendars are not dispositive on their own, but they are another piece of evidence in the mix for you to consider," Kavanaugh says.
RT @desiderioDC: Sen. Cornyn is tearing up as he listens to Kavanaugh.
“This onslaught of last minute allegations does not ring true. I’m not questioning whether Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person at some place at some time. But I have never done this to her or to anyone," Kavanaugh says teary eyed.
Thursday Kavanaugh is a lot different than Monday Kavanaugh
Kavanaugh says he's an independent judge but he today he sounds like an angry partisan
Kavanaugh says "millions of Americans listen carefully" to senators.
Kavanaugh is ANGRY	“This confirmation process has become a national disgrace”		"You have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy"
It's the only way they think they can fight for Kavanaugh without attacking Ford https://t.co/UZpKFHqtsM
Harris can be heard telling Ford: "Thank you for telling the truth"
Mitchell is explaining to Ford the best way to deal with trauma?
Ford says LeLand Keyser apologized after the statement she gave to the committee and has health issues that she's taking care of. Ford not surprised Smyth and Keyser don't remember. But says Judge would remember.
Mitchell now asking about the statements of Smyth, Ford and Keyser saying they have no knowledge of the party where alleged Kavanaugh sexual assault occurred
Kennedy defers to Mitchell. No GOP senators asked Qs of Ford.
Lots of anonymous quotes on how this is affecting Kavanaugh nomination. Let's see what the senators say.
Ford lawyers say they are doing this pro bono and not being paid
@scottwongDC @RosLehtinen Very good friends with Sen. Capito.
Booker didn't really ask many questions
Flake would not say whether the vote should be delayed tomorrow in committee OR for full Senate to consider him in the next few days
Lots of people confused about Mitchell's line of questioning. GOP says that Mitchell is going to tie it all together at the end. We'll see ... https://t.co/IPUpBjuImT
Ford says she agreed to talk to Washington Post after reporters started showing up at her house
Also Collins and Murkowski not a lock for Amy Coney Barrett who is viewed as far more conservative than Kavanaugh https://t.co/nX4jAGODDy
I asked Flake why he didn't ask his own questions		“I wanted to have the hearing and I’m glad it is [happening]. The effort was to try and make it not a circus atmosphere and in a more professional way”
Katz says she and Ford's lawyers paid for the polygraph
Is there a political motivation for coming forward?		Ford: "No"
Thanks to my assistant @hillhulse for holding an umbrella over me as we quizzed Sen. Flake and he stayed on message and deferred comments on hearing

Manchin says he’s “not happy” Republicans are deferring to Mitchell
Just saw Sen. Ernst vote and then run out of Senate chamber, presumably to get back to watching
Ford says she doesn't know who paid for her polygraph
I mean, Republicans could ask all these questions if they wanted to https://t.co/OmNrLSJP5q
Flake defers to Mitchell.
Should Judge be interviewed?		Ford: "That would be my preference but I don't think it's up to me"
Durbin really the only Democrat to ask questions and get new facts into public domain about Mark Judge's Safeway job and how Ford later saw him and he looked "ill"
Flake is slated to go next. He said last night he didn't know if he would ask his own Qs but praised GOP for hiring Mitchell to take politics out of hearing
Flake is the only GOP senator that seems likely to ask his own Qs at this point. Maybe Kennedy
Ford says "it wasn't clear to me" that GOP had offered to fly out and interview her.
Sasse defers his questioning to Mitchell. He's been essentially mute during this whole episode other than a statement to Nebraska paper
This is going to take a lot longer than we thought. I count more than a half-dozen senators to go
Why did you contact the Post?		Ford: “I was panicking, because I knew the timeline was short for the decision and people were giving me advice"
Lindsey Graham is jumping in here. First Republican to speak other than Grassley. Asking when polygraph provided to committee
Grassley notes he offered to fly investigators out to California after Ford says she preferred not to fly to D.C.
Mitchell asks Ford how she got to Washington. Ford says she flew. She made clear to committee she preferred not to. Mitchell is asking her about all the times she was on a plane.
Grassley recounting the tick-tock of how this all came together and all of Kavanaugh's denials then explains why no FBI investigation. Klobuchar jumps in to say that George Bush order FBI probe during Hill saga
Cornyn said he might jump in if Mitchell wasn't asking Qs he wanted to ask. He didn't jump in
Ford is being pressed on her saying incident occured in "early 80s," "mid 80s" and "1982"		How were you able to narrow down the timeframe?	"I'm using memories of when I got my driver's license," she said.
"I don't know how any of my Republican colleagues ... could possibly vote for Brett Kavanaugh," said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).
Ford says she saw Judge working at Safeway 6-8 weeks after alleged incident. She says he appeared "ill" and did not want to speak with her
To what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted you?		Ford: “100 percent’
Peak Delaney: Announces Iowa stop in middle of biggest congressional hearing of the year
Ford says she's spoken to LeLand Keyser after the alleged incident. Keyser says she doesn't recall the incident or the gathering
"We're here to accommodate you, not to accommodate us," Grassley says, discussing whether Ford needs a break. 		"I'm used to being collegial," Ford responds.
How do you know it was Kavanaugh?		Ford: “The same way I’m talking to you right now. Basic memory functions”
Ford says she came forward because reporters were staking out her house and talking to her dog to try to calm it down.
So Ford is going to have to go back and forth between two separate lines of questioning?
Grassley interrupts Mitchell to say she's going over his 5 minutes ... in the middle of testimony over the accuracy of Ford's messages.
Although then they have a light exchange about coffee. Grassley says people don't mix it correctly.
Grassley seems unmoved by that emotional opening statement.
Dr. Ford says she wants to talk to the senators. 		And she wants some caffeine.
Ford said she noticed all the reporting that said Kavanaugh was a lock to be confirmed as she decided whether to come forward.
