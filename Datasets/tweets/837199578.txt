@RepDebDingell You are always in our thoughts and prayers.
@ShaniePhyllis @KagutaMuseveni Most likely
@DianaAtwine It's the right thing to do.  Thank you, Dr.
This is what I earlier indicated about the situation of most health facilities in Uganda.  It would be nice to have something done to ensure local communities get the services they need most. https://t.co/28wNXZBxun
@rosemaryCNN Wishing you a very Happy Valentine's celebration as well.  I hope you enjoyed, and had fun.
@ChrisObore1 You did just that,  and got a parliamentary job.  Congratulations!!
@Winnie_Byanyima If there is any app to score drivers,  then each company should be able to develop one.  The driver probably thought you were late for your flight.
@MargaretMuhanga @KiwandaSsuubi I guess it will make them feel proud.
@RepMikeQuigley Our prayers for you and all the family members.
@RepDebDingell Sounds nice and inspiring!  Congratulations!!
@DianaAtwine Thank you.
@WWeirRelocation @GovernRent @hintzemedia @XtremeTransDr @KWBrentPaszt @Couponmamacita @BritPropAwards @sothebys_agent @theishomes @SarjuKhemraj @MetalFinishTMF @EliakimRealty @SSPlaybook @JulianneLilholt @jimzook Thank you!!
@WhiteheadComm It's so humbling to read your post. Wishing you all the best.
@JaneRuth_Aceng @KagutaMuseveni @NRMOnline @MinofHealthUG Dr. Aceng, You have to be honest about what you post.  How can the health sector improve when patients are asked to buy drugs, including paracetamol? Lira RRH is a good example.
@KagutaMuseveni @URA_CG Thanks for the support. We hope to see more Ugandan companies undertaking construction projects.
@SpeakerPelosi It's our prayer that President Trump opens the government to allow federal employees get back to work.
@minolaempire @HEBobiwine Thanks H.E RK!!  We are so very proud of you.
@lisastark351 I guess he is now getting what it means to be a President.
@UNICEFEducation @UNICEFAfg @MofaJapan_en It's so inspiring.  Thanks for supporting the education of children globally.
@ScrewedHumans @grizzle_meister It's a brilliant idea.
@Floramujaasi @KagutaMuseveni @JaneRuth_Aceng @DianaAtwine @JanetMuseveni @MinofHealthUG Our leaders have lost trend of the reality on the ground. On December 22nd,  I offered to take a patient to Lira RRH to the emergency unit.  Power socket was not functioning to allow her be put on oxygen machine to save her life.  She died shortly without any medical attention.
@zam_quitah @ntvuganda @HEBobiwine They can't stop his flight to the United Kingdom.
@MiraagiA @Parliament_Ug @RebeccaKadaga Really??
@Parliament_Ug @RebeccaKadaga Work never gets finished.  Abdu Katuntu team can handover what has been done and what needs to be done to the incoming chair.  Extending their term of office is not the right thing to do.
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/ZaeGrMCprL
@rosemaryCNN Glad you are back from your holiday break.  Wishing you a very happy, and productive new year.
@MargaretMuhanga That sounds so strange.
@KagutaMuseveni @JanetMuseveni Wishing you all the best in the summit.
@FirstLadyRwanda @PaulKagame Wishing you all the best in the conference.  Proud of you!!
@Snduhukire You better be out of political matters, and remain neutral.
@PoliceUg Thanks for the great work.
@KagutaMuseveni Congratulations!!
@StateHouseUg @KagutaMuseveni It's a great initiative.  We need to encourage all Ugandans to be engaged in physical and sporting activities on regular basis.
@KagutaMuseveni The best justification to give is... the tax is meant to raise more funds for greedy political leaders.. It's the poor Ugandans being taxed.
@KagutaMuseveni It's so sad. We hope the investigation will be conclusive, and the killers apprehended.  May his soul rest in eternal peace.
@McclainBaxley It was an emotional moment.  We recognize Wesley's achievement, and pray for the entire Georgia Southern family.
@realDonaldTrump The meeting is a step in the right direction. We wish the two Korean leaders a fruitful meeting.
@EmmanuelMacron @TrumpGirlStrong @realDonaldTrump Wishing you a very fruitful and productive meeting.
@AKasingye Yeah... It's always healthy to have such moments in life as we grow. I never had to meet you face to face during those days.  I really recognise and appreciate your selfless service to this nation.  We are so very proud of you. Blessings!!
@AKasingye @joshuacheptege1 Asan,  I know how passionate and supportive you have been. Your contribution towards sports development will always be appreciated.  I still recall our encounters during those days of Boroboro Tigers FC.
@KagutaMuseveni As a country, we will need to invest heavily in building sports facilities,  and supporting athletes.  A percentage of foreign investor's capital can do this. We have the potential to get more medals. Thank you and Mama Janet Museveni for the support.
@KagutaMuseveni Both the State and the Church should work in cohesion.  It's not a nice thing for you to communicate to each party using the media platform.  Please arrange and always meet the religious leaders regularly.
@BearkatsBOWL How great!!  Congratulations.
We had a great family time visiting Rodie at school today. Rodie, you are all we have, and it's always a joy to have you with us. https://t.co/7UEwwidebd
@realDonaldTrump Please learn to recognize and appreciate others.  None of us is perfect
@KagutaMuseveni That's the best approach to realign their wild opinion that they have been publicly expressing lately.  I'm glad you could host and treat them to a luncheon.  Have a blessed Sunday!!
@Pres_Hebert @GSAthletics_FB I knew you would ensure a winning Georgia Southern football team is assembled.  I can't wait to see the Fall season start.  Wishing you all the best. Have a blessed Sunday!!
@PoliceUg @NadaAndersen @metpoliceug @andrewbagala @AKasingye @kyobesarah @UgandaMediaCent @skaheru @Dave_Bugzy @newvisionwire @nbstv Congratulations, and thank you for supporting him.
@KagutaMuseveni @JanetMuseveni Thank you for creating a supportive environment to promote development.  We hope the local community members will benefit from the hospital and schools funded by Dr. David Tim MCcal and his wife.  Blessings to you all!!
@TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump He may need to provide some evidence to support this claim, by availing the list of the Facebook users that were reached by the Russian firm.
@KagutaMuseveni Thank you so much for your support to the national team.  We are proud of Stella. Congratulations!!

@lucysrealty @mitchellvii That's a great observation.
@KagutaMuseveni Thank you.  We hope the security situation will normalise.

@realDonaldTrump It's sad and unfortunate.  Something needs to be done urgently to stop irresponsible use of guns.  Our prayers for the victims and their families.
@dr_palazzolo @realDonaldTrump Sounds nice.  Congratulations!!
@Pres_Hebert It has been impressive and exciting to learn of the achievements being registered.  Wishing you and your team all the best this semester.
@Pres_Hebert @GSAthletics_MBB @GSAthletics_WBB Best wishes and good luck to the team.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you. Wishing you all a happy, peaceful,  and prosperous 2018
@RepKayGranger Thank you for supporting the bill.  I hope it will make the situation better for hardworking Americans.
@JoyAnnReid @GDouglasJones I believe he should be given time to hire the right and competent staff for his office irrespective of race and color.
@Pilotforever83 @ktbarthelette @RealSaavedra @slick1mike Glad you made a donation.  Thank you
@cajunlady1128 @Pilotforever83 @RealSaavedra @slick1mike Thanks for your support to the man who needed our help most.
@Pilotforever83 @RealSaavedra @slick1mike Thank you for your good gesture to help the man.
@RealSaavedra He did just the right thing to help the police officer on duty. That's what a true American needs to do to make this world a better place.
@UKenyatta @KagutaMuseveni Wishing both of you a fruitful discussion for our region.

@newvisionwire It's time for us to reflect as a country for improved service delivery.
@ntvuganda Sounds nice!  All civil servants deserve better
@FrennMD You are right.  Have a blessed day!!
@KagutaMuseveni I was in Lira over the weekend. I interacted with the local people. It appears radio talk shows won't address the land amendment bill.
@ntvuganda Gen. Katuma Wamala is a true statesman.  I watched how he stood in the floor of parliament to cool down the situation. Blessings to him.

@kayizarica @Domillard1 @PaulKagame Glad you could recognise the great contribution of your leaders.
@PaulKagame We thank you for your selfless service to the people of Rwanda. Please consolidate democratic principles for sustainable development.
@JoAnnBateman2 @Tourismuganda Looks great and beautiful.
@KagutaMuseveni No problem.  Let us know the different radios where you will be hosted. It would equally be helpful to share the radio programs. Thank you.
@Pres_Hebert @GSAthletics_WSO Good luck to the team.  So proud of you all!!
@KagutaMuseveni We wish you a fruitful working visit to Belgium.  Have a safe flight back home.

@FrankTumwebazek @KagutaMuseveni That's what leadership is all about.  You should accept and respect everyone's views.
@UKenyatta In this particular scenario,  the justice system had no option other than calling for the election to be organised again. Best wishes!!
@KagutaMuseveni @PaulKagame Time can fly.  So much has changed!
@KagutaMuseveni @PaulKagame H. E The President of Uganda,  Enjoy your flight and have the best of it all in Kigali. Wishing you a good and inspiring deliberation.
@Atwine_Diana @MinofHealthUG How great! It would be better to share the performance indicators that you had developed so that we can celebrate the achievements.
@KagutaMuseveni @JustineLumumba It's something to think about. However,  whoever came up with the idea should have a deeper analysis and present concrete evidence.
@joshuacheptege1 @KagutaMuseveni Congratulations!  We are so very proud of you.
@Pres_Hebert What a great and remarkable achievement!  I'm sure the rural community and nursing students will richly benefit from this outreach program.
@mkainerugaba @FrankTumwebazek Thanks for sharing.  This is work in progress.
@ArmyChiefStaff @KayaJones @SenJohnMcCain We are praying for Sen. John McCain and his family too.
@dr_palazzolo Looks nice!  Enjoy your vacation.
@KyleJamesHoward I believe God will always be with you and your family.  It's our prayer that He leads you to a Church that will unconditionally accept you.
@Pres_Hebert @GeorgiaSouthern It's so amazing to know you have already made a year at Georgia Southern. We thank you for the great progress being made. Blessings!!
@EFAReport @WeCanEndPoverty That seems to be a better approach. I hope the children have the interest in learning.
That is alright. There is hope at the end of the tunnel. I believe the best road construction company will be awarded the contract. Thanks!
Great contribution! I am happy school children in disadvantaged communities are being provided food by WFP.
