@belfast2la @AsmJimCooper I'll trust the doctor who discovered CTE. Why would we put 10-year-olds at this kind of risk to play a sport?	https://t.co/pgMZK2tD3O
@AsmJimCooper Please review following: https://t.co/InpXd32Gab Too many parents are unaware or do not educate themselves to health risks of football to children. We need to put the health and safety of children first. Children under 12 can learn fundamentals of sports without tackling.
@AsmJimCooper Please reconsider position on youth tackle football. Medical studies show that children's brains are particularly vulnerable to impacts of tackle football at a young age.  John Madden has said he believes tackle football should not be played prior to high school.
