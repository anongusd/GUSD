When I told Ed Nixon how onetime House Committe on UnAmerican Activities investigator Bob Stripling said he deserved more credit for the Hiss case than then-Rep. Richard Nixon, R.-CA, Ed Nixon replied: "Stripling's problem was you could never give him enough credit!"
At Richard Nixon's centenary on January 9, 2013, I was seated w. Ed Nixon, Rep. Leonard Lance, R.-NJ, &amp; Nixon speechwriter Ken &amp; Meredith Khachigian. When Lance recalled being a volunteer in '60 campaign &amp; said "it was really close in NJ," Ed said "It was really close eveywhere!"
When Richard Nixon suggested to brother Ed he run for Congress the seat of retiring Rep. Tom Pelly, R-WA, in 1972,  Ed quickly said no, saying "he never worked for the government in his life &amp; had no intention of starting."
Ed Nixon recalled to me how on 1967, he went around the country on behalf of his brother Dick to assess possible opponents to his candidacy in '68.When Ed told him Giv. Reagan was wowing state GOP conventions &amp; looked "pretty strong," Dick said dismissively: "He's a thespian!"
On January 9. 2013, at the Mayflower Hotel for Richard Nixon's centenary, I introduced Ed Nixon to my friend @lauremandeville, who took a picture with him for her parents in Toulouse. As we mourn his passing tonite, I wonder if she recalls his "warning" to her that night.
The last time Ed Nixon came to see me, he told me how he was at a C'mas Party the night before &amp; joined in a singalongs w. Ted Kennedy--the 1st time they met. Ed &amp; Ted shared a lot if stories about two much-older brothers running against each other for President.
So saddened to learn Ed Nixon. last surviving brother of Richard, died at 88. He was a truly beautiful guy--well-read. great sense of humor ("I'm a geologist'--I've got rocks in my head!")  a raconteur--&amp; I am grateful to @VanHipp for bringing us together.

@CestAlain And you remember the New Left group that got a young veteran named John Kerry out of the race so Drinan could go one-on-one with Philbin?  How on earth did Drinan, a priest, unseat someone who would have been chairman of Armed Services had he won re-election.
@MrLarrySmathers Ah, so that's Peggy Moran?  Presumably from "Sun Valley Serenade?"
@2ndAmend1791 Agree.  I learned the hard way not to make snap judgments.  &amp; I won't condemn Kraft or talk about his "victims" until I know more.
Robt. Kraft, in 1970, at 29 &amp; out of Harvard Business School, was Newton (MA) Democratic Chmn. &amp; strongly considered as anti-VN war primary foe to Rep. Phil Philbin, #2 on House Armed Services Committee.  He finally declined, &amp; the left backed Fr. Robt. Drinan--who beat Philbin.

saddened by news 2 hours ago of the death of my friend Rep. @RepWalterJones on his 76th b'day.  He was a maverick--non-interventionist, deficit hawk, and Ron Paul libertarian--and, having converted to Catholicism in military school, had his faith to sustain him to his final days.
@HalFurman Keep listening for her official reply to her brother the King.
@HalFurman Did not know about divorce but she has her own resources and. by many accounts, dies not need or care about royal allowance. I read King's statement but signs are strong ...for now...she will defy him. She's pretty close to the former PM &amp; his reform movement.
Not since Simeon II of Bulgaria led a new movement to the power in 2001&amp; became PM Saxe Coburg Gotha has one of royal blood attempted what CV is happening in Thailand: Ubolratana Rajakanya, daughter of late King &amp; wife of an American, will seek to be PM in Mar. 24 elections.

"If there's going to be peace &amp; legislation, there cannot be war and investigations."...I have a pretty good hunch who gave @realDonaldTrump that line: @GovMikeHuckabee, the Republican Secretary of Rhymes.

Election of Ed Gillespie as VA lt. governor in Nov. 2019 caused by resignation of Gov. Ralph Northam (who beat Ed in '17 after a dirty race-based campaign) would be the most perfect revenge since Edgar Allen Pie's "Cask of Amontillado"
If Northam goes &amp; Gov. Fairfax appoints lt. governor, there will be the 1st special election for VA'S 2ND HIGHEST OFFICE since 1971. And Republicans will nominate Ed Gillespie....or maybe Barbara Comstock?

@thesum @robbygeorge7 I watched them all as well &amp; realized this Mr. Phillips-who has operated under an alias &amp; has a checkered service record-has a history of forcing his merry band on Catholic events.

@Holdthebaloney @EdGillespieG3 How so? I don't remember that at all.
@robbygeorge7 @thesum Sorry. Prof. Robby George, Catholic scholar, apologized for rush to judgment on Covington Catholic.
If the yearbook picture came out in mid-October of 2017, would Ralph Northam have gone down to @EdGillespieG3?
@thesum I'm won't make a snap judgment on Gov. Northam--having learned a lesson for initially sympathizing w. Mr. Phillips over Covington Catholic boys (&amp; like @robbygeorge7 apologizing for it). If we apply standards of today to things said &amp; done 25-30 yrs ago, we'll have NO heroes.
I would love to get some comments on the current Controversy swirling over Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam from his fellow "Brother Rats" (Va. Military Institute grads, key to electing him). Every VMI cadet must see the film "Brother Rat," starring Eddie Albert AND...? Go figure!

@julianorobertrj Mr. Phillip's keeps misstating what happened--that boys surrounded him, that they chanted "Build that wall," &amp; uttered racial slurs at 4 elderly black people--&amp; none if this happened. He shld be glad someone is offering him a lunch w. boys to work out any real differences.

@DCwine1 @realDonaldTrump I watched a part of it &amp; at first agreed. But I watched the complete film in which the vet and fellow Indigenous marchers walked into the crowd. It gives an entirely different impression &amp; that's why a "tea summit" would sort it out.
Rather than argue or get into "he said, he said," why doesn't @realDonaldTrump himself settle this by inviting a few of the Covington Catholic boys &amp; Me. Phillip's to the White House for a " tea summit" to talk this over? (None of them are drinkers, I imagine).

@Mike31385536 @ekimsnevets The statement of apology from Covington Catholic to Mr. Phillip's, the veteran. Although the students have been defended on social media, not one has spoken out to say "We weren't harassing him--just following his drumming."
@PROUDofTEXAS I ask you not to do that. Noone has ever un-followed me, even those who disagreed w. me, &amp; I have never unfollowed them. As one who has been a target of false witness, let me watch more of the videos. All I asked was why if they weren't harassing the vet, they don't stand up firm
@RebelSkumb @ashsoles Whoa! I don't delete ANY replies &amp; I take responsibility for all I write. I see from the videos how either side could claim interference from other. The only thing I am asking is why the Covington Catholic kids are not saying anything if someone is bearing false witness.
@DrNickMilne If you really read "Whisper of the Axe," who, sir, did Kranak turn out to be? (FYI --having lunch next week w. my friend @tetianaanderson, who is a dead ringer for Miss Teel. Our 1st meeting was NOT like Kranak's w. Teel, believe me!
@RebelSkumb @ashsoles Am watching them now. But just tell me why neither the Covington Catholic students or teachers are saying they were wronged?
@DrNickMilne I'm saying Mr. Phillips appeared to be a gentleman. Kranak was clearly not &amp; the characterization of the Lipan Apache does indeed say they "built North America with their hands &amp; can make 50 Navajo quail." "Whisper of the Axe" was so suspenseful I read it twice!
@RebelSkumb @ashsoles Let"s see it, then. And why isn't their school crying foul?
@ashsoles Hey--not one of the students nor faculty has said what you claimed is the case or tried to contradict Mr. Phillips' claim. And he said he was blocked from leaving.
@ashsoles So why didn't Mr. Phillip's say "no slight was taken" &amp; ended it all? And why didn't any of the kids step up &amp; say "we meant no harm?"
@ashsoles Whoa! Mr. Phillip's, the drummer, said "it was getting ugly". &amp; Covington Catholic High apologized to him.
Sickened by boorishness toward Amer. Indian/decorated VN vet Nathan Phillips by those brats from Ky. It wldn't have ended peacefully if the Indian had been Kranack in Richard Condon's "Whisper of the Axe," a Lipan Apache--fiercest of all tribes, can do what make 50 Navajo quail.

@johnston_kelly Today, a Stephen Chandler could most likely not make it to nomination to the bench.  Prior to his service, he was primarily a "fixer" and "operator" rather than a true litigator &amp; I don't see that passing muster today.
@oconnellap You are correct &amp; I stand corrected: Baird was 1st and Wood 2nd.  Wood had hired an illegal immigrant housekeeper when it was legal to do so (before Immigration Control Act of 1986) &amp; had paid taxes on her.  But coming after Baird, it might've created controversy so Wood exited.
@PeterRoff I stand corrected--2nd choice, and had actually paid taxes Baird didn't.
Kimba Wood is by far the most colorful U.S. District judge since Stephen Chandler of Okla--confirmed in 1943 despite major sexual harassment charge &amp; who waged wars with fellow jurists Luther Bohannon &amp; Albert P. Murrah. He was known as "the Tiger Who Drinks Wild Turkey."
Kimba Wood was judge in Michael Millken case, a past Playboy bunny, was Bill Clinton's 1st choice for AG until nannygate tax kerfuffle brought her down &amp; was "other woman" in divorce of atty. Frank Richardson(now her  incumbent husband).
Just realized the judge in Michael Cohen case is one of the most famous jurists outside the Supreme Ct: U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood.

@ACraigInParis @JanesAmerica Exactly. I would strongly suggest Democrats look at some of the recent rhetoric on Israel coming from their own ranks.
As House Democrats &amp; the Black Caucus  push to censure Rep. Steve King, R.-Iowa, for clumsy talk on white supremacy, they may want to recall speech on "Israeli Lobby" by Rep. Gus Savage, D.-Ill, on March 29, 1990 &amp; his talk two years later of "racist Jews" &amp; how they did nothing.
Rep. Steve King, R.-Iowa, is denied Committee spots due to clumsy words on white supremacy &amp; Democrats call for censure. I suggest a reading of the virulently racist speeches of Reps. John Rankin, MISS. &amp; John Rarick, LA, &amp; how nothing was ever done to either. Both were Democrats
Had Fixed Term Parliaments Act of 2011 been on books in 1940, Chamberlain would almost surely have hung on as PM and Churchill would not have made it to Number Ten for UK's "Darkest Hour." Repeal this act so ill-fitting to the Mother of Parliaments!
As I read up on rules in event UK holds election, I conclude the Fixed Term Parliaments Act of 2011--which seeks to keep British PM in for 5 straight years- is truly dumb legislation that tries to remold a parliamentary system into a presidential 9ne.
William P. Barr demonstrated today why he would be "Mr. Attorney General"-- the nation's legal eagle most above partisan politics since Francis Biddle in 1941-45 and James P. McGranery in 1952-53.

If May loses no confidence vote, the only way she goes is by her own resignation.  The move to dump her lost 200-to-117 &amp; under Conservative Party rules, she cannot be challenged from within her party for another year.
Tomorrow's vote on "no confidence" in @theresa_may will be a cliffhanger!  She can't afford to lose any of the 317 Tories nor any of the ten DUPers.  Likewise, Corbyn needs all 256 Labourites, all 60 of the 5 smaller parties, &amp; a handful of defectors.  My money is on Tessie.

Joanne Linville, who placed the wife of comedian Sweeney Tomlin on "Everybody Loves Sweeney " has had a distinguished career acting &amp; teaching acting. Best known for. longstanding role on "Guiding Light," she is still going strong at 90.
As Frank Sinatra said at the opening of the "Dick Powell Theatre," Mickey Rooney indeed showed talent as comedian Sweeney Tomlin in "Everybody Loves Sweeney."  But so did Ross Martin, later famed as Jim West's sidekick on "Wild, Wild West," as Sweeney's lawyer.
Everything I have read says the "Dick Powell Theatre" had powerful ratings and it ran from 1961-63, when Powell died of cancer at 58.  I just wish there was entertainment like this today....and hosts and actors like Dick Powell.
In "Everybody Loves Sweeney" on "Dick Powell Theatre," Mike Rooney as comic Sweeney Tomlin has a meltdown in court and does his routine including jokes and doing a parody of Noel Coward singing "We've Got a Loverly Bunch of Cocoanuts."  Powerful scene!
Sad note:  at the time "Everybody Loves Sweeney" was aired on "Dick Powell Theatre," Dick himself was fighting cancer and friends substituted for him.  On this episode, the sub was....Frank Sinatra.  Other subs included David Niven, Gregory Peck, &amp; Ronald Reagan.
Tonite, I watched episode of "Dick Powell Theatre"--Mickey Rooney in "Everybody Loves Sweeney," about a nightclub comic who sues a TV show for implying he was late and unreliable.  Rooney is outstanding and Dennis James, later game show host, is great as host of show being sued.

Memorial service for Les Kinsolving will be Friday, December 14, at Church of the Holy Comforter, 543 Beaulah Rd., Vienna, VA, at 1:00 PM.
Among other things, Les Kinsolving played football at Penn and was a member of the Screen Actors Guild who played a Confederate general in a movie.
When I needed to get back to my office at a briefing, no matter how busy he was, Les Kinsolving would drive me back.  "I'll be glad to help you, John," he'd say at the Hay Adams, "but first let me go to the john."
At the funeral of venerable radio reporter Ivan Scott, Les Kinsolving held mourners at St. Stephen's Church spellbound with his readings of Scripture--&amp; just about left people fainting when he said "There are those who say reporters go too far with their questions..."&amp; dropped it
Les Kinsolving never let a friend down.  When Helen Thomas's husband Doug Cornell died in 1982, he was at the funeral-- when Helen's mouth got her in trouble, he defended her (albeit in disagreeing w, her on the Middle East).  I hope people will remember this &amp; come to mourn him,
The late Les Kinsolving could drive press secretaries of Presidents to distraction--but so many loved him.  I suspect @AriFleischer falls in that category, and misses him.  He got Les his covered "hard pass."
So saddened to learn my friend and former colleague at the White House, Lester Kinsolving, died at 90.  He could tell great stories--from Marty Maher teaching him to swim at West Point to interviewing Rev. Jim Jones while he was based in San Francisco.  Sui Generis for sure!

Still spellbound from watching "Who Killed Julie Greer ?" premiere episode of Dick Powell Show in Sept. 1961. Not only did it have stunning twist ending but suspects from Jack Carson as a beatnik &amp; coffee shop owner to Edgar Bergen as a veterinarian were truly captivating.
I realized today Dick Powell did it all: he sang, danced, acted in musicals and drama, directed, and produced--and, like his friend Ronald Reagan, was a superb emcee, as he demonstrated on the "Dick Powell Show" from 1961-63.  So sad he died at 58.
The creator of millionaire cop Amos Burke, head of homicide for LAPD, &amp; first played by Dick Powell, was apparently Frank Gilroy, TV writer (The Rifleman, Wanted Dead or Alive) who went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for the play  "The Subject Was Roses."
When a reporter at police hq. asks the desk sgt. how Inspector (not a Capt. until Gene Barry played him) Amost Burke got a Rolls Royce, the reply is: "He has millions."  Asked how he came to have millions, the sgt, says: "The old-fashioned way: he was born with them!"
In "Who Killed Julie Greer?" Dick Powell as Amos Burke questions a judge (Ralph Bellamy) who rues 20 yrs, of marriage &amp; then a brief affair w, the murder victim.  He says this just before he is scheduled to deliver a speech on the topic of "The Rising Divorce Rate."
Saddened to learn my friend Bob Keefe, campaign manager for the late Sen. Scoop Jackson (D.-WA) in his 1972 and '76 presidential campaigns, died Wednesday at age 84.
@timrouth Yes. Susan Hayward, as well.
The first suspect Capt. Burke questions about the murder of Julie Greer on the "Dick Powell Show" is a cowboy actor she broke up with...played by Ronald Reagan.
SW (Smarter Wife) &amp; I spellbound watching "Who Killed Julie Greer?", 1961 episode of "Dick Powell Show" in which Powell himself played Capt. Amos Burke, head of homicide for LAPD--part later made famous by Gene Barry in the eponymous TV series.

So enjoying "Dick Powell Show" I have to ask: could an anthology of weekly plays with 5-star guests and a distinguished "name" host make it in today's TV world?
Mickey Rooney, as Put Put Higgins, recalls to Dick Powell  how multimillionare Vernon Clay fronted the money for him to move from caddy to kenner of a pro shop--but they were never close. "Special Asssignment" is an unforgettable play on "Dick Powell Show."
Powerful scene in "Special Assignment" in which Dick Powell talks to June Allyson as a onetime singer &amp; girlfriend of multimillionaire Vernon Clay's late son &amp; as she talks to Clay, we see phone chord is unplugged--&amp; we find she's actually a patient in a mental ward.
Watched "Special Assignment,"on"Dick Powell Show," w all-star cast: Lloyd Nolan, Mickey Rooney, June Allyson, Barbara Stanwyck, &amp; Dick Powell himself, as atty. Paul Martin, hired by dying multi-millionaire Vernon Clay to learn if 5 people truly cared for him  or just wanted his $
That's entertainment: watched "Operation Benefit," an episode of  "Ensign O'Toole" series (produced by Dick Powell's"4 Star Productions) w. Powell as "Lt. Cmdr. Powell" &amp; sings "We're Shoving Rt. Off" that he sang in "The Singing Marine" 25 yrs. before. 2 mos. later, he was dead.

@Fighthypocrisy @bannerite Wrong. I agreed w. Bush, Reagan, &amp; Goldwater, and Wm. Buckley on this- in favor of civil rights. but not w. Title VII. Bush also called for the US to get out of the UN in  64, and 7 yrs. later, became US ambassador to UN.

@BradClemens I see your point but I recall so many who loved Crazy.  Kids would imitate him on the busride to school every Monday.  And you're right: the transformation from barfly to baritone was amazing.  (Frank Fontaine followed his pledge at confirmation and was a lifelong teetotaler).
I am pleasantly surprised the liberal media is not reminding us that as the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Texas in '64, George H.W. Bush agreed with Goldwater &amp; opposed the Civil Rights Act. (So did Goldwater's top surrogate campaigner, Ronald Reagan).
I won't divulge any plot parts to "Metropolis," but it was moving to hear the ever-cynical Bernie Gunther in the makeup room of a Berlin studio bantering with the equally-cynical Lotte Lenya--star of "Threepenny Opera," who ended her career as Rosa Kleb in "From Russia With Love"

George H.W. Bush's 'Insider Campaigns' Took Him Far https://t.co/ztvkweBq4M #Newsmax via @Newsmax
One forgotten fact from 1964 is that TX GOP Senate nominee George H.W. Bush opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and stood with Barry Goldwater after he voted against it.
Had Reagan not tapped George H.W. Bush as his VP in 1980, Bush might have gone on to be secretary of state and retired quietly.  He would never have been president and George W. Bush would be a successful baseball team owner.
In 1991, an exasperated conservative said that he wanted to support Bush for re-election but had been disappointed by him more times than pleased.  He suggested a bumper sticker for folks like him: "At Least He Gave Us Clarence Thomas."
George H.W. Bush so loved his job as CIA director that he tried to persuade Jimmy Carter to keep him on in 1976.  Carter had his own man in mind (Annapolis classmate Stansfield Turner) but had he kept Bush he would have kept him out of '80 race &amp; changed history.
Many defeated House Members today complain the WH is not helping them with positions.  When George H.W. Bush lost his Senate bid in 1970, Nixon offered him #2 at State or Treasury or a top White House job or RNC chmn.  Bush held out for UN ambassador--&amp; got it.
George H.W. Bush knew what he had to do to move on.  As GOP Senate nominee in TX in '64, he cut commercial calling for U.S. to get out of UN.  Seven years later, he was ambassador to the UN and loving the job.
Recalling George H.W. Bush, it's impressive to note that he never won office beyond two terms in US House from safe district &amp; that all of his appointive positions were secured by insider campaigns and cultivation of the powerful.

Books, Dr. James Billington, Librarian of  Congress said, are "a moral antidote...to the creeping passivity, parochialism, &amp; shortened attention spans of our video culture."
"I have only way to work &amp; that way is very intensive," Dr. James Billington, Librarian of Congress, said of his notorious temper (which often led him to lash out at subordinates whose work didn't meet his standards.

@jnrjedi @theresa_may @Nigel_Farage @Politicalex Why do you say 50% plus 15% is incorrect? The last time a challenge like this occurred, Lady Thatcher got 50% and just missed the 15%, which is why she withdrew. What is key is that this inevitably will go to the registered Tories--1st time since '05--&amp; that's May's downfall.
If MPs get "magic 48" &amp; force a vote on @theresa_may, she's toast. She can count on maybe 20% of Tory MPs. To shut off challenge, she needs 50% + 15% more. In 1990, Lady Thatcher got 14.5%-plus &amp; thus missed the vote she needed to shut down Heseltine. @Nigel_Farage @Politicalex

@bigtimcavanaugh Saw the dramatization on TV but want to read the book.
The Deaf Man is to the 87th Precinct team as Karla is to George Smiley. He appeared in six of Ed McBain's thriller novels, but did we ever find out who he was?
Altho "87th Precinct" aired only from 1961-62, it had some stunning guest stars: Robt. Culp, Peter Falk, and Nancy Davis (Reagan), to name a few. The precinct lived on in made-for-TV movies &amp; in the film "Fuzz," w. Burt Reynolds as Corella &amp; Raquel Welch as Det. Eileen McHenry.
@SmashAlley59 @NolteNC What made you think that?
After wrapping up "87th Precinct," Robt. Landing went on to star in "12 O'clock High," costarring Frank Overton, Paul Burke, &amp; my good friend Rep.-to-be Robert K. Dornan (R.-Cal.)...who starred as "Capt. Bob Fowler."

Touching scenes in "87th Precinct" were when hard-boiled Det. Steve Corella (Robt. Lansing) spoke in sign language w. wife Teddy (Gena Rowlands), who was deaf. In so doing, they brought the deaf &amp; hearing impaired closer to us. Cheers, Ed McBain, for creating these characters.
87th Precinct TV series followed McBain's books, except Det. Havilland in novels is corrupt &amp; self-centered but is just a determined, veteran cop when played by Greg Wolcott on TV. And I love Norman Fell as Meyer Meyer, who I recall played cameo of himself in "Mad, Mad World."

So Jimmy turns to his beloved Uncle Benny, who gives him sound advice: "Face your problems, and they vanish."  It has been a credo I have tried to live by since I read "Paper Dragon" decades ago.
Ed McBain, creator of "87th Precinct," also wrote under his real name Evan Hunter and produced "The Paper Dragon," a powerful novel about a plagiarism trial.  Author Jimmy Driscoll fears revealing a highly personal incident that would win his trial for plagiarism. .....
The conman Adrian Score, who tries to swindle Mr. King on the "King's Ransom" Episode of "87th Precinct" was a superb character.  The cops at the precinct knew him well, as when they ask "Score, are you disguised as a lizard?"
Just watched "King's Ransom," a really gripping episode of "87th Precinct" about the kidnapping of a chauffeur's son mistaken for the son of an industrialist.  Nancy Davis (Reagan) played the wife of the chauffeur. @ReaganWorld Why did "87th Precinct" not run past 1961-62?

@trwilson99 Name drop a lot? Pardon me-too had many grand mentors I learned from and honor to this day.
@trwilson99 I think I know how a gentleman behaves &amp; that's the last subject you can talk to me of. But I believe in the forgiveness of sin &amp; the redemption of ignorance.
@trwilson99 I'm don't send tweets for followers or clicks &amp; honestly don't understand that art. Quite frankly, as a lover of history, I like to look back at significant developments--my late friend, the great teacher Russell Kirk, wld have been 100 Friday &amp; I will write a tribute to him.
@trwilson99 As I said, read "A Rage for Justice"--and John Jacobs names all the liberal Democrats cultivated by Jones-Miscone, Willie Brown, Sheriff Richatd Hognisto, and many more.
@trwilson99 One more thing: as I think of my friend John Jacobs--committed liberal &amp; columnist for the Sacramento Bee--I recall how we differed on things but when we said what we had to, we'd laugh &amp; have a drink. Looking at his book, I miss him very much.
@trwilson99 Let me help you. 1st &amp; foremost, more people wld take you seriously if you behaved as a gentleman does. I also suggest you read " A Rage for Justice," my late friend John Jacobs' bio of Rep. Phil Burton. He spells out how Jones wooed "the titans of liberalism" in SF &amp; names them.
@trwilson99 Jones was not only close to but a player in the election of liberal Democrats--notably Moscone--who rewarded him. I don't claim to be the smartest man on Twitter, but I'm the smartest man in this exchange.
@trwilson99 You are confused. I don't think I need you to tell me what's lying and what's truth. I would respectfully suggest you abjure from discourse on subjects you don't know.
@trwilson99 Simply out-there is ample evidence Jones' People's Temple provided the 5000-vote edge that made Moscone mayor over John Barbegelata-who swore for the rest of his life that fraudulent votes cast by non-voters hailed in by Jones made the difference.
@trwilson99 Don't sound so imperious &amp; judgemental. I'm mentioning an historic fact. In fact, Shawn Steel, LA atty, took depositions on People's Temple in LA &amp; found they were heavily involved in Demo politics. No Republicans sought Bundy's support for elections--Dems did, very successfully.
@trwilson99 I'm not blaming any party-'just noting that SF Demos had close ties to Jones &amp; Peopke's Temple was met to election of Moscone as mayor--by 5,000 votes over conservative John Barbegelata.

Kavanaugh's 50-48 confirmation is not the closest. That belongs to Stanley Matthews, confirmed by one vote (24 to 23) in 1881. Ohio GOP Sen. &amp; Garfield appointee Matthew's was criticized for his role in securing Senate approval for disputed election of Rutherford Hayes in 1876.

@MrLarrySmathers I completely mis-read Murkowski but I have a feeling this is her last term.
@lexicachexia @realDonaldTrump As many people sided with him as claimed he was lying--about nonsense, by the way.  Black was held to a far lower standard than Kavanaugh and that is generally overlooked by the left--which lionizes him for his record on civil rights (but omits the anti-Catholic rulings he made).
@lexicachexia @realDonaldTrump No one has told me yet what he lied about and I think the person who has more to worry about that than Kavanaugh is the person who could never produce a single withness to the charge she made.  FYI--Hugo Black weaved and bobbed about the KKK until he was outed in press.
@amindthatsuits I still get a chill recalling the chant of the demonstrators outside the Supreme Ct. in "Come Ninevah Come Tyre:" "Oh, Justice Davis/You Didn't Save Us/Your robes can't hide/The rat inside....Kill Rats! KILL RATS!" And then he did die mysteriously.
@lexicachexia @realDonaldTrump Just remember:  Justice Hugo Black's past  membership in KKK &amp; successful legal defense of a Klansman who murdered a Catholic priest didn't matter.  But--what the heck--he went on to be one of the most liberal justices of all.
Watch the coming battle royal over nominee of @realDonaldTrump to succeed Brett Kavanaugh on DC Court of Appeals. Prediction: he'll be in his early '30s, black, have gilt-edged Federalist Society credentials &amp; if confirmed be boomed as eventual heir to Justice Thomas.
Demonstrators chanting "Shame On You" at Sen. Manchin eerily reminded me of demonstrations by leftists envisioned in Allen Drury's "Come Ninevah, Come Tyre" and--at one point--they chant at Supreme Ct. Justice Thos. Buckmaster Davis after a hostile ruling. @amindthatsuits
Well, I was off by one--51-to-49, even closer than Clarence Thomas but enough for confirmation.  You may have to go back to 19th Century to find a Supreme Court nominee confirmed by that close a vote.

Even fierce admirers of Hugo Black admit, and warm biographers agree, he dodged questions about KKK until after he was confirmed and it was brought out by investigative jouirnalism.  If Kavenaugh has hidden or misstated something, he can spell it out after confirmation on radio.
@nathanking Yes.  Is he really a French icon?

@DukeStJournal Hugo Black weaved &amp; dodged on whether he was a Klansman &amp;  was confirmed.  After his confirmation, a newspaper exposed his KKK membership &amp; then &amp; only then did he put the issue to rest.  As it was with Black's KKK membership, so it can be w. Kavanaugh's ralphing and flagalating.
Once confirmed, Brett Kavanaugh should follow the example of Justice Hugo Black on Oct. 1, 1937 &amp; go on radio to address the nation.  Where Black explained his onetime membership in the Klan, Kavanaugh can put the stories-- especially about "Ralphing" &amp;"flagellating" to rest.

If @johnrobertsFox really has the sworn statement from Dr. Ford's former lover, and he really did see her coach someone on how to take a polygraph, then that is a direct contradiction of a major part of her testimony.  I say "if" because I'm only now just getting reports.
In the movie "The Adventurers," Dax Xenos (Beikem Fehmu) is asked by the Teen Magazine reporter (Jacqueline Smith in her debut) if it's true he has "made love to every woman in this room." He replies after a brief pause: "Not yet!"

Hugo Black wld never say whether he was in the KKK during confirmation process, despite charges he was by Republicans &amp; civil arts ldrs. After being confirmed, he addressed the nation,  admitted membership but said he quit, believed in equality of blacks, Jews &amp; Catholics.

@AndrewFeinberg He did...AFTER he was confirmed.

Black never confirmed reports of his Klan membership until after he was confirmed to the Supreme Ct. Then he made his radio address, repudiated the Klan, &amp; said he considered the issue "closed."
Listening to Justice Hugo Black's 1937 national radio address admitting he had joined the KKK as a young man but left it &amp; repudiated it.  Black was confirmed w. only 16 no votes. Was his "youthful error" a bit worse than any Kavanaugh possibly made?

@trwilson99 @JamesMartinSJ @americamag And I also freely admit I didn't realize that Twitter is different from news reporting--when one makes an error, one writes "CORRECTION"  and refers to the previous statement that is incorrect.  I probably will delete more.

@MrReluctant Get "Washington Gone Crazy," highly critical bio of Sen. Pat McCarran, R.-NV, by Michael Ybarra &amp; read chapter on Frankfurter.
@Emfarm1Nancy Check out "Washington Gone Crazy," a biography of Sen. McCarran, by the late Michael Ybarra. I gave it a bad  review, but--&amp; I was impressed--it had an excellent chapter on McCarran delaying Feankfurter's confirmation &amp; how this led to 1st hearings questioning ct. nominees.
@roslynbraun31 I'm agreeing with you and have always wanted an FBI report. My frustration is that it wasn't handled sooner. At this point. if delays were good enough Brandeis, Frankfurter &amp; Thomas, they're good enough for Kavanaugh.
Sen. Pat McCarran, D. NV, Judiciary Chmn, was the one who raised doubts about Frankfurter &amp; insisted he be called for questioning.Franfurter hit back--firmly--dazzled the senators w. his knowledge of the U.S. Constitution &amp; history &amp; was confirmed about opposition.
If you think Kavanaugh's questioning by Judiciary Committee was tough, check out Felix Frankfurter in 1939--1st time a nominee to high court was called to testify. He was brutally grilled in writings, leftwing clients, patriotism &amp; being born in Austria. But confirmed easily.
People shldn't be upset by delay in Kavanaugh nomination &amp; late FBI probe. It took 4 months to confirm Louis Brandeis in 1916 &amp; criticism of his writings (including blistering editorial in NYT) led to the 1st hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee into a Supreme Ct. nominee.
@bromanmri If an executive were interviewed, they wouldn't even consider charges from high school or college without arrest or even a police report.

@FrenettMarco Thomas DID cry earlier in his testimony, when he spoke of seeing his grandfather insulted by whites.  Kavanaugh cried when he spoke of his daughter praying for Dr. Ford.  Family is fair game for tears.  He didn't cut off senators but in those days, they showed him respect.

When Fr. Thompson told us we observe fasts of Ember Days in spite of what Vatican said we didn't have to do in '69, I thought that if @Pontifex spent his time "reforming the reform" &amp;B restoring these traditions instead of starting controversy, our Church would be better off.
At St. Thos. Latin Mass this morning, Fr. Thompson reminded us of the Ember Days--fasting four times a year on the Wed, Fri, and Sat. following St. Lucia's Day (12/13), Ash Wednesday, Whitsunday, &amp; Exaltation of Cross (9/14).  As traditional Catholics, he said, we observe fasts.

@abemichaels @justanotherhan2 @MikeDelMoro I don't think they care about disqualifying him.  If a two week investigation came back &amp; satisfied Ford that this is not the assailant she thought, it wouldn't matter: Congress would be out of session &amp; Kavenaugh would not be confirmed in time to sit on the bench in October.
@Soldier397 @MikeDelMoro As one who was willing to give CD Ford the benefit of the doubt so long as she testified under oath, I'm beginning to believe this is a tactic to stall the nomination until after the election in the hopes Dems gain seats &amp; can stop Kavenaugh.
@justanotherhan2 @abemichaels @MikeDelMoro FBI thinks the thing is frivolous and refused to look at it when it came up (anonymously) in July.  Her argument is with the FBI.  If she really believes what she has charged, what is her problem w. testifying? &amp; why wld she volunteer to testify, then call for new investigation?
@justanotherhan2 @abemichaels @MikeDelMoro If she's going to make the charge, let her make it.

@cllnwlhlm That is up to the FBI to determine and they have made it clear that something that occurred in high school and is cited by one person without witnesses is not going to be investigated.  Take it up with their spokesman--not me.
@genellog @HalFurman Ahhhhh......
@cllnwlhlm So let me get this straight: he will testify under oath, produce witnesses and statements, and she will do neither--all because FBI--an independent agency--refuses to open a probe on someone who they have investigated six times in 20 years?
@GunnyJ @HalFurman As opposed to when?  He went through hearings like Gorsuch, RBG, and any other nominee.  There will be a vote and the full Senate will deal with it.  Please explain where the rush is, as opposed to other judicial nominees.  When do you want a vote?
@cllnwlhlm I would respectfully suggest you talk to the FBI, which has investigated Kavenaugh six times over twenty years.  I would be happy to talk to their spokesman for you.
@GunnyJ @HalFurman No rush at all.  Chairman Grassley agreed to a delay in the vote taking Ford at her word she would testify (as Kavenaugh readily agreed).  Now she moved the goal post again.  Even Alger Hiss never did that!
@cllnwlhlm Not making light -citing history, as a student of congressional hearings &amp; their procedure.  He is willing to testify under oath and, last time I checked, this is the third time she has amended her promise.  &amp; I was willing to cut her slack &amp; say fine if she testified off-camera.
@capeannsky Whoa!  Chairman Grassley DELAYED the vote so both Kavenaugh and Ford could testify.  Now she's moving the goal post down and demanding an investigation by the FBI--which made it very clear they are not going to go back &amp; look at one incident 35 yrs ago after 6 investigations!

Professor Ford will be offered the opportunity to testify behind closed doors without camera--if she will just reply &amp; accept the committee's invitation.  Meanwhile, Kavenaugh has accepted in its &amp; will testify on camera.
In "When the Shouting Dies," Vera Miles, as Heap Canfield's older. rich wife gives the best alibi in the world for her husband when Dan August asks where he was at the time his mistress was murdered:"He was in bed with me!"
Powerful episode of "Dan August" --"When the Shouting Dies"--about onetime high school football great Heap Canfield, a teammate of Dan's, charged w. murder of a mistress.  Cld easily see Mike Henry &amp; BURT Reynolds tossing ball around playing field.
@ksenijapavlovic I totally agree but I only point out that public opinion polls are better for him than at a similar time for Clarence Thomas in 1991.  I imagine those numbers will go up if the accuser declines to testify.  Today, she has so far refused to respond to invitation to testify.

@nato_303 My love for "small world" coincidences came from listening to Paul Harvey. His "Rest of the Story" endings were full of them! An actor named DeForest once played a vampire in "The Return of Dr. X" but he wanted to play romantic leads...&amp; he did..Humphrey DeForest Bogart.
@nato_303 My only purpose is I love historical coincidences. In ex-Rep. Bob Livingston's (R.-LA) memoir (which I reviewed), he notes when he was an enlisted man in Navy in Carbbean. he was a "stone's throw" from Lt. John McCain. But they never met until they served together in Congress.
@cerullianblue Agreed, although I liked him best in "Advise and Consent" and Senate Majority Ldr. Bob Munson of Michigan.  But I agree he was a powerful Admiral Harriman Nelson.  It's a close call between him and Richard Basehart as to who was the best admiral of the Seaview.
@nato_303 All I did was comment on the coincidence and conclude "You can't make this stuff up."  Like all foreclosure cases, this was complicated but it is unusual the mother of the man she blames this stuff on was ruling on her parents in bankruptcy court 16 years later.

Linda Marsh, who played the daughter of the union boss (Joe DeSantis) &amp; lover of his rival (Vic Morrow) on the "Union Forever" episode of "Dan August" gave up a promising acting career in the 1980's to go into screen-writing.

Wish I could have interviewed Burt Reynolds later in life to find out why--when he had reached the pinnacle of success &amp; was a true star--he didn't set out to produce a movie or made-for-TV film of "Dan August"--possibly as police chief of Santa Luisa ten years after series.

W. anonymous &amp; frivolous charge of high school behavior against Judge Kavanaugh, we've come a long way since Judge Henry M. Brown of Detroit was named to Supreme Ct. in 1890 &amp; it was revealed he stopped a burglar in his home by shooting him in head. He was confirmed unanimously
At Center for Security Policy, I kept wondering who was that rather large woman w. shoulder-length in corner table w. Reps Nunes &amp; Brat (R.-VA). Then "she" turned around &amp; I exclaimed:"Omigosh! It's Steve Bannon!"
@d_twit An anonymous source who produces no witnesses while 60 contradict her &amp; never actually calls the act "attempted rape" &amp; may have taken the "incident" from contemporaneous TV police shows(where clamping one's hand over a woman's mouth was often portrayed) is NOT frivolous?
@Emfarm1Nancy Someone else pointed out that since 1955, a Daley has been mayor for 43 of the last 63 years.
The question about Bill Daley running for governor is whether. as was the case when he made his brief bid for Gov. in '14, he will "choke" &amp; abandon race early.
The matter of Madame X, who made that frivolous charge of Judge Kavanaugh putting his hand over her mouth when they were in high school. is closed, accd'ing to Sen. Hatch, since her name is redacted by Feinstein so FBI is unable to investigate her charge or her mental history.

In his eulogy of Paul Laxalt, former RNC Chmn. Frank Fahrenkopf recalled how he first met Laxalt in 1962 when he was running for lt. governor on a ticket headed by ex-cowboy actor Rex Bell.
As an usher at Sen. Paul Laxalt's funeral Mass at St. Matthew's, I was proud to escort former VP Dick Cheney to the 2nd pew.  Others remembering Laxalt were ex-Sens. Bob Dole, Don Nickles (Okla) &amp; Spence Abraham (Mich), ex-AG Ed Meese, &amp; Sen. Dean Heller (NV).

Powerful lighting &amp; camera angles in "Nightmare" episode of "Outer Limits"--especially thoughtful words of Major Wong, who looks &amp; expatiates in an almost haunting way like Francis Fukyama.

Latest NovusPoll shows Sweden's Social Dems edging moderate Alliance by roughly 40 to 39%, w. Sweden Democrats--1st cousin to France's FN &amp; Germany's AfD--18.2%, up from 14% they got in '14. But how many voters support Swedish Dems but won't say?
Something I learned about John McCain that made me identify w. him: accd'ing to Joe Lieberman, he loved reading history &amp; historical fiction "&amp; then discussing the books he read." Sound like anyone else you know?

@wkpixley1 I haven't seen it that way but will look it up. This is important.
"Lying in State," as John McCain and 31 others have done, means lying in Capitol Rotunda for mourners to pay respects.  "Lying in Repose"means lying somewhere else--Justice Scalia in Supreme Court, and Joe McCarthy in U.S. Senate chamber.

@bigtimcavanaugh OK. I'll bite. Why?
I'd say Mrs. Scott (Joanne Gilbert) went into shock on the "O.B.I.T." episode of the "Outer Limits" when her husband Dr. Clifford Scott (Harry Townes) reveals the OBIT machine showed her having an affair with Mr. Lomax (Jeff Corey)--&amp; then Lomax's true identity is exposed!
Let me correct myself: It's BYRON Lomax, not Harvey, played by Jeff Corey in the classic "O.B.I.T." on "Outer Limits." The most stunned person is Barbara Scott (Joanne Gilbert), wife of Dr. Clifford Scott (Harry Townes), who says he learned she was having affair w. Lomax via OBIT
"The machines are everywhere," is how Harvey Lomax (Jeff Corey, in a powerful performance on "The Outer Limits") commences the dramatic conclusion of the episode "O.B.I.T.", in which he predicts the downfall of mankind because of the desire to know everything about everyone.
45 years since Michelle Lee's hit "L. David Sloane," about a guy a gal has broken up with who won't leave her alone.  One thing I've wondered all these years: did we ever learn who L. David Sloane is?
@Emfarm1Nancy @Pontifex Yes, and it's going to continue &amp; grow. Archbishop Vigano's latest shot at Kim Davis audience &amp; what transpired is latest example of @Pontifex ambushed at the Credibility Gap.
I wonder if Pope Benedict during his walks thru the Vatican gardens will encounter @Pontifex  &amp; urge him to resign and let the Church move on.

@SoapboxO I don't do "gender neutral"--taught the opposite at Northwest School in Newington, CT.
Arizona Rep. Martha McSally was the 1st female pilot in Congress but not the 1st to run for Congress. That was famed aviatrix Jacqueline Cochran, who narrowly lost as a Republican in Cal. in 1956 to Democrat Dalip Singh Saund--1st Indian to serve in Congress,

@kjbert @amindthatsuits @Card_R_Sarah @Pontifex Thank you, although there's some disagreement put there. I try w. all my heart to show respect for differing views, &amp; disagreecw'out being dsagreeable.
@kjbert @amindthatsuits @Card_R_Sarah @DPietrusza I have dreamt All that happened in Church since 1965 never happened &amp; it was as it was. Think of this--Russell Kirk, Graham Greene, &amp; Jane Wyman all converted to a Catholicism that was truly spiritual, only to be told it was no longer be what they converted to. Sickening.
@kjbert @amindthatsuits @Card_R_Sarah @Pontifex The vision of the Jesuits was grand when the young Pat Buchanan &amp; Bill Bennett studied under "The Pope's Marines." And John McLaughlin was a Jesuit whose lectures at Fairfield  Prep earned him the sobriquet "Father God."
@kjbert @amindthatsuits @Card_R_Sarah &amp; remember: when a Church closes, it iscalmostvalways taken over by a traditionalist order--fraternity of St. Peter, Oratorians, etc. That is the future. @amindthatsuits @DPietrusza dpiet
@kjbert @amindthatsuits @Card_R_Sarah It's not unique. I am usually the oldest at Mass &amp; many young people attending their 1st Latin Mass swear they will never go back to the vernacular, w. It's sign of peace, standing for communion, etc. I  really don't understand why @Pontifex Pontius is so intolerant of this.
@kjbert @amindthatsuits @Card_R_Sarah I don't know what you mean by "mass participation"--attendance has never increased under him. The Catholics I know don't want a church that follows whims of time like soda flavors or skirt lengths. Most of those who saud the Church is "old-fashioned", became Episcopalians.
@kjbert @amindthatsuits @Card_R_Sarah What I wld confront him w--&amp; he will be eventually confronted-is why he has not cont'd Benedict's "reform of the reform" which was bringing back traditionalists to the Church. &amp; why he refuses to red hats to archbishops of LA, Philly &amp; Portland-not to mention Bishop Schneider.
@kjbert @amindthatsuits @Card_R_Sarah In the process, he has done nothing on Benedict's "reform of the reform" which was resolving post-conciliar errors &amp; bringing traditionalists back to the Church.
@kjbert @amindthatsuits au contraire, this has metasticized &amp; the longer Pontifex refuses to reply to the Archbishop's letter, the bigger the move to dump him grows. He sure has made enemies--immaculate Mary Order, Knights of Malta, Cardinals Burke &amp; @Card_R_Sarah, and now this.

Henry Kissinger remembered when he 1st met John McCain nearly 50 yrs. ago &amp; he said "'Thank you for saving my life'...in all the yrs of our friendship, he never again mentioned his captivity."
Joe Lieberman recalled John McCain never understood his obligations as an observant orthodox Jew "&amp; wld take particular pleasure in the fact it's Saturday &amp; I had to walk here."
"When you traveled w. John," said Joe Lieberman said of McCain, "even w. Lindsay [Graham] along, you weren't there to have fun."

When Sen. Russell sought re-election in 1936, he was accused of being a "New Deal" liberal by a genuine white supremacist--Gov. Gene Talmadge, who used bad terms for Jews, Catholics &amp; blacks &amp; said "that Hitler is a mighty fine fella."Russell won by 2-to-1.
Loved Sen. Orville's comment on "Outer Limits" episode "O.B.I.T" about why he wld not want the device that can hear all in a 500-mile radius trained on him "when I'm talking about my Senate colleagues, my former law partner,&amp;  the President of the U.S.--not to mention my wife!"
When Bowler took oath as congressman in '53, colleagues asked why he wanted to be freshman rep. at age 78.  He replied: "Because in 1906, I was told I'd get seat when it was next open.  So I'm in Congress because it was my turn!"--47 yrs. later.
If Donna Shalala wins FL-27, she'll be 2nd-oldest freshman Rep. in history at 77,  Oldest was Jim Bowler of Chgo. who withdrew from race for Congress after losing coin toss to Adolph Sabath in '06,  When seat was next open, Bowler got it--after Sabath died in '53 &amp; Bowler was 78.
@CamaraDorelle Respecting history and not going with the flow is something no American should be for.  If we apply the standards of some people at one time against another, pretty soon we'll rename every bldg.  And again, please read Caro's "Master of the Senate"--Russell was neither,
One more Russell lesson: when he sought the Demo nomination for president in '52, his press sec--his @seanspicer--was a young Raleigh radio reporter named Jesse Helms. In his book, Helms speaks of his deep admiration for Russell.
@kjbert Segregation was inarguably bad--disgusting--&amp; it was the greatest generation that finally ended it. , Humphrey, Paul Douglas were fighters for civil rts. &amp; LBJ, ex-segregationist &amp; Russell ally, signed the Voting Rts Act that made Russell, Thurmond, etc abandon segregation
@kjbert Thanks. I had threebgreat mentors on that point; William F. Buckley. my later Mom &amp; SW (Smarter Wife).
John McCain was a great hero &amp; I wld love to see the Pentagon named for him. But Richard Brevard Russell was a man of the Senate-again, read Carl's chapter on him in "Master of the Senate"--and his name belongs on the Senate bldg.

@kjbert If we continue to remove memorials &amp; statues when times &amp; whim change, we will be on a par w. Russia or China or Powell's Oceania. Soon, the J. Edgar Hoover Bldg. housing the FBI will be the Robt. Mueller Bldg. &amp; Dulles Airport will be John Kerry Airport.
@CamaraDorelle Read chapter on Russell in "Master of the Senate" by Robt. Caro. He supported segregation -'as did every Southern Democratic Sen of the era  including LBJ (whose maiden speech defended segregation). Russell was a player in Cold War as Armed Services chmn. &amp; master of Senate rules
@CamaraDorelle It is mean-spirited to suddenly say someone whose funeral the entire Senate attended--Humphrey, Kennedy. &amp; all who had disagreements, &amp; whose name "is synonymous w. the Senate," accd'ing to ex-Sen. Chambliss (R.-GA), shld suddenly stopped being honored because attitude changes.
Delighted to hear Sen. McConnell is taking his time to consider ways for the Senate to honor Sen. McCain, &amp; not embracing mean-spirited scheme of Sen. Schumer to rename Russell Senate Bldg. after McCain. This isn't Russia &amp; It's not Oceania.

Poignant that John McCain died 9 yrs to the day cancer took the life of colleague &amp; friend Ted Kennedy.
Sad at death of John McCain, I recall 1st political discussion w. him at Capitol Hill Club in Dec. 1980 when the then U.S. Navy Senate liaison said he &amp; wife Cindy planned to move to Arizona  for a run in new House district he expected would be carved in Phoenix area.

In "100 Days of the Dragon," ticket of Wm. Lyons Selby &amp; Ted Pearson are never referred to by any titles-.gov, Sen, whatever--before they are elected Pres &amp; VP.
One thing I've noticed in "100 Days of the Dragon"--whether it's the President or VP or whole we, they all smoked. It was symbolic of a time when America was freer.
@bigtimcavanaugh Did you know him?
In "100 Days of the Dragon," Richard Loo portrays Lee Chin Soong--dictator of a Asian country that is almost surely China &amp; plants one of its agents in US as a doppelganger for presidential candidate Wm. Lyons Selby.
@blrshepherd yes!

I have heard Philip Pine was tapped as VP Ted Pearson in "100 Days of the Dragon" because he bore such a striking resemblance to former VP Richard Nixon.
Strange to watch "100 Days of The Dragon" on "Outer Limits" redux &amp; see a presidential candidate unguarded, alone in hotel room, and dining &amp; appearing regularly w. VP choice. But this was made before Nov. '63.
Sen. James Buckley (C.-R. NY) was so moved by Bruce Herschensohn's "Czechoslovakia '68") that he arranged for its public screening--unusual for a VOA film &amp; something that drew howls of criticism from liberals.
@johnston_kelly Both SW (Smarter Wife) &amp; I heartily agree. He was best man at our wedding.
Watched 2nd episode of "Outer Limits," "100 Days of the Dragon," (1963) in which a hostile Asian power kills leading presidential candidate Wm. Lyons Selby &amp; substitutes a double. Powerful!
Wonderful talk w. my friend Bruce Herschensohn about making of his Academy Award-winning film, "Czechoslovakia '68." There is no narration &amp; only sounds are anti-Soviet protesters changing "Swoboda"(Czech for "freedom", which was also name of Czech President)

@Politics1com And like Gorby, sadly, Dubcek saw time pass him by. When he finally appeared in public in '90 (after 22 yrs. as an unperson), he was cheered but it was Hagel, the chain-smoking author, who stepped up. He was the true anti-illegal Communist &amp; the people recognized this.
After he was deposed as Communist Pry. 1st Sec. in '68, Alexander Dubcek became an unperson--never reported in press, never photographed, &amp; like Nelson Mandela in his prison yrs, referred to as "you know who" rather than by name. He managed an auto repair shop.
50 years ago today, Russian tanks poured into Prague &amp; dashed the dreams of a libetal economy &amp; greater democracy envisioned by Alexander Dubcek. All this is beautifully portrayed in the USIA film"Prague Spring," written, filmed, &amp; produced by my good friend Bruce Herschensohn

Last I heard, Felix Bloch was in Chapel Hill, NC driving a school bus.  Irvin Scarbeck was in The Woodlands, Texas at age 98.  Wonder if either would sit down with me for an interview?
@bklyniri @presssecy @PressSec Many, many thanks.
@BOB_EWASHINGTON No, it isn'tt unprecedented for a Scarbeck or a Bloch to have their security passes removed by their superior in gov't.  (Both had them pulled by the secstate--Scarbeck by Rusk in '61, Bloch by Baker in '90).  But it is unprecedented for this to be done by a Pres.
Recalling the case of State Dept. official Irvin Scarbeck--who had his security clearance removed by SecState Dean Rusk when he was charged w, being compromised by Polish intel in '61--I think he's still alive at 98!  Wonder where he is?
As I told @PressSecy, it's unprecedented for a President to personally remove security clearances of anyone in or out of gov't--even in cases of espionage.  In the last 2 big espionage cases, Irvin Scarbeck ('61) &amp; Felix Bloch '90), security clearances were ended by the SecState.

Ex-Defense Min. Shigeru Ishiba is longshot challenger to PM Abe for leadership of LDP in late September.  But keep eyes on August 15 &amp; whether he not visits Yazukuni Shrine in morning coat (which Abe has never done as PM).  If he does, it will electrify LDP grassroots &amp; the race.
In '13, @Pontifex began a jihad against the Franciscan Order of the Immaculate. Where Benedict XVI gave permission for Order to celebrate Latin rite &amp; young people were increasingly attracted to it, @Pontifex forbade celebration, &amp; 14 monasteries have closed by '16. Any updates?
So fascinated I re-read FT interview w. Ex-PM Koizumi of Japan. He said recent scandals make it "difficult" for his former right-hand man Shinzo Abe to be re-elected head of LDP this autumn and thus remain PM.

FT notes that the question of Shinjaro Kuizumi, Member of Diet and son of ex-PM Junichero Kuizumi, becoming PM himself is not "if" but "when."  At 37, Shinjaro is a political rock star.

@Ryanexpress77 @HNTurtledove I'm convinced he would.  Thomas was clearly being moved--from EEOC chairman to the DC Court--with the idea he would succeed Thurgood Marshall.  Any Republican president would have named him in '91.  Adam Laxalt shld win, but it will be close.  NV is truly a marginal state.
One little-noticed factor about Laxalt as Reagan's VP instead of Bush: it was have been 1st time in history there was a Republican Roman Catholic as VP &amp; perhaps accelerated Catholic swing to GOP.
@MissQ1 Goodness, no. I'd  never insult another of God's creatures--not ever. But it is almost inarguable to say, as a student of history, 1) Reagan's choice of VP had an impact on many things &amp;2) had he chosen Paul Laxalt--as conservatives hoped-- lot of people &amp; events was be different

At 89, Guy Molinari was a Marine (Korean War), NY state assemblyman, U.S. Rep (1980-90), &amp; Staten Island Borough Pres. A class act.
This has been a hard week, days after I learned of deaths of former Sen. Paul Laxalt (R.-NV) &amp; former Rep. Billy Hendon (R.-NC), I just found that former Rep. Guy Molinari (R.-NY) died June 24th--the 16th of the 55 House GOP "Reagan babies" elected in '80 to leave us.
While we're on it, Indiana actually repealed RTW in 1965 when legislature &amp; governor were in Democratic hands but under Giv. Mitch Daniels (2004-2012), it was restored.
@trowaman @Politics1com Not exactly.  In 2011, they voted to repeal RTW, which would have limited collective bargaining among PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS only--much more selective than a universal RTW law.

@Gordie207 Thank you, Gordie.
Ex-Rep. Bill Hendon (R.-NC) told me, despite differences on everything, he admired far-left Rep. Phil Burton (D.-CA), w. whom he served on Interior Committee.  "Phil knew how system worked &amp; when to deal," he said, "&amp; had I been able to get away, I wld have gone to his funeral."
The death of my friend, former Rep. Billy Hendon, R.-NC, means that of the 55 Republican "Reagan Babies" who were elected in '80, he was the 15th to have died.  Very sad.

Remembering Ex-Sen. Paul Laxalt: Nevadan, Friend to Ronald Reagan, More https://t.co/EgiNF6VGRo #Newsmax via @Newsmax_Media
When Ronald Reagan picked George H.W. Bush as his running mate in Detroit, Nancy Reagan told Paul Laxalt: "I'm so sorry, Paul. I wish it had been you."
I will always remember Paul Laxalt, and the kindness he showed me and the time he gave me.  I am a better person for having him as a friend.
If Paul Laxalt had only lived until November to see grandson Adam win his old job as governor of Nevada.....and, if he wins, Adam will be 40--4 yrs younger than Paul was when he assumed the office in 1967.
When I asked Paul Laxalt why he retired from Senate in 1986 after two terms, he replied: "I served my time. And I was ready to move on,"
Of George W. Bush in 2000, Paul Laxalt told me "he ought to get down on his knees to every conservative his father forced out of government when he became President and say 'I'm sorry.'"
When Paul Laxalt said he hoped to meet "Mr. Hughes" someday, Howard Hughes gently brushed him off because, in his words, "I look like a g----- cadaver."
When Paul Laxalt's mother watched him sworn into the Senate in 1974, she saw Barry Goldwater and said "Just take care of my boy."  Without missing a beat, Goldwater replied: "Don't worry, Momma, I will."
Paul Laxalt lost a bid for U.S. Senator in 1964 to incumbent Democrat Howard Cannon by 84 votes and won Nevada's other seat ten years later by 624 votes over Lt. Gov. Harry Reid.
As much as he spoke of Ronald Reagan, Paul Laxalt also shared with me stories of another cowboy actor turned politician: Rex Bell, who asked Paul to be his lt. governor runningmate when he ran for governor in '62 &amp; died four months before the election (in which Paul won lt. gov).
Paul Laxalt's stories were jewels to me.  He was offered the job of chief of staff to mysterious billionaire Howard Hughes but declined because (he told me) "I could never work for a guy I only communicated with by phones and whose calls got me out of bed!"
RT @paul_L_obrien: @johngizzi How sad, John. I know you just tweeted about his birthday the other day. May God grant him eternal rest.
A product of an era when friendship transcended partisanship, Paul Laxalt, conservative Republican, counted as good friends Democratic Sen. Russell Long (LA), Hubert Humphrey (MN) &amp; Harry Reid, whom he narrowly beat (500 votes) for the Senate in '74 &amp; who succeed him in '86.
As sad as I was that Sen. Paul Laxalt died, I realized he is now with his parents, Ron and Nancy Reagan, Rex Bell (his 1962 runningmate), and John Paul II.  Not bad if you have to go.

@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely Once again: I said I run quotes past people when I Don't record. I hope you at least appreciate that I am treating you w. respect which you Don't reciprocate.
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely You are not listening. Final words: I run quotes past people when I Don't record. Have done it by phone for yrs &amp; more recently by fax and email. And it is w. pros on all sides of spectrum--from KOBACH TO HEFNER. AND WHY YOU ARE WELLING ON THIS &amp; TWISTING MEANING IS BEYOND ME.
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely Again, you have a conclusion &amp; don't listen to any.  As I said, please come hear my lecture at the NJC.  Or read about the late interviewer par excellence Oriana Falaci.
@shannonrwatts @NRA Strange. This is the 2nd time you retweeted my photograph from 2016 &amp; you don't give any credit to my friend @PhilipinDC at right nor do you send out our stories on this or our interview with @WTOP.  Why?
@AFKPermanently @JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely I won't try to confuse you with facts.  You have a closed mind. (Rep. Earl Landgrebe, R.-Ind., 1974)
@Helmerbang Don't know what that means.  If people think enough of me to ask a question, I'll try to answer and not blow them off.  No person is unimportant in my book.
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely How many people do you know who give up Sundays &amp; patiently--w'out rancor--respond to charges that come from nowhere &amp;, quite frankly, wouldn't exist if the writer didn't have something against Mr. Kobach?  I do because I my honor &amp; integrity mean everything. &amp; I'm not even mad!
@JessicaHuseman I do tend to agree &amp; I am increasingly holding on things I don't get verification of.  Recording subjects has eliminated the need to doublecheck quotes.  But the hard facts remain: editors push harder to "get it up ASAP" and hence the rush.  But I am more on your side.
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely It makes perfect sense &amp; I am just afraid of getting into an intense interview and misquoting.  This happened in '13 &amp; with someone I liked.  He never held it against me but I vowed it wouldn't happen again if I failed to record.
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely It is quicker to send it whole than single out quotes.  But everyone knows well they can't change content.  Again, this is an increasingly rare case because I have now mastered the phone recorder.  Recorded Rich Trumpka last week &amp; Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) a month ago.
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely I faxed article to Mr. Hefner &amp; emailed article to Kris Kobach, because it was quicker than singling out quotes.  But they understood I was doublechecking their quotes.  In previous days, I simply read quotes back to people I didn't record--the late Rep. Mick Staton (R.-WVA).
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely From John McCain to the late Rep. Bill Patman (D.-TX) to Hugh Hefner to Sen. George Allen (R.-VA) Kris Kobach--a wide spectrum--I interviewed without recording and sent story back &amp; requested they clarify quotes if I got wrong.  My belief in accuracy trumped all.
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely Someone I disagreed with on a lot--Hefner--gave me an interview in 2000 on topics from 1st Amendment to why candidates were returning $ raised at his mansion.  I didn't have time to record but FAXED interview before it ran.  He didn't reply but later wrote to say I was fair.
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely You should come to my talk to the National Journalism Ctr.  If you can't record--which I do almost always now--it is wise to read quotes back.  Before email, I used to read quotes on phone.  I'll try to dig up letter from Hugh Hefner in 2000 thanking me for accuracy in interview.
@YourProtagonist @lisafleisher @ZachWritesStuff I have answered every question on this from a cacophony that really doesn't care what I think but probably has something against Mr. Kobach &amp;/or his commission.  Again, as UK Labour ldr Hugh Gaitskell said, "From the noise of that kind, you don't want to hear the argument."
@JessicaHuseman @DoctorCandiru @abarmostlikely I certainly told him that--as I did Hugh Hefner in 2000--when I began the interview &amp; said I wasn't recording (which I feel one has to disclose one way or another).
@YourProtagonist @lisafleisher @ZachWritesStuff When I read some of these things, I can only think of the words of British Labour Leader Hugh Gaitskell to a rancorous party conference: "The noise of that kind means you don't want to hear the argument!"
@DoctorCandiru @JessicaHuseman @abarmostlikely If one doesn't record interviews-which I now do always--it is a good idea to run quotes past them.  I don't mind sending a full article w. the caveat that all that is subject to change are their words.  In '13, I misquoted someone &amp; felt terrible about it.  I said "never again."
@DoctorCandiru @JessicaHuseman @abarmostlikely Jay O'Callaghan &amp; Hans von Spakovsky I consider the most knowledgeable on election &amp; Voter ID law, &amp; the Census.  Both of them I saw personally to run technical part of story past.  But if you can suggest someone else just as knowledgeable, yes, by all means, I'll contact them.
@lisafleisher @ZachWritesStuff Oops--that's HUGH HEFNER. And if I had not mastered the recorder in my phone, I wld still run quotes past interview subjects: from Kris Kobach to John McCain to Hugh HEFNER.
@knoweyedentity @maggieNYT Thanks Burt. Iit hurts when one's integrity is questioned for running quotes past subjects from Kris Kobach to Hugh Hefner--all in the name of accuracy. But having readers like you makes me feel stronger because you know the truth.

@ArleighCoons @maggieNYT Couldn't say it better.  I don't mind criticism. But it is obvious from the pile on that, even when you try to reply calmly and clear up questions, they want to belittle &amp;, worst of all, impugn one's integrity...which has never happened to me, even from folks who disagree.
RT @skwogler: @johngizzi @maggieNYT Twitter needs sober, good-humored, seasoned, wise voices.  	Do not go anywhere, John.
You're wrong. And I'm beginning to think @maggieNYT has a point about staying off Twitter for a while. But when people attack one's integrity, it's a bit much.
@lisafleisher @ZachWritesStuff I interviewed the late Hugh Get her in 2000 via phone &amp; didn't record. It was controversial. Before I ran piece, I faxed it to him to double check quotes. He never got back, so it ran as was. He later wrote me a letter praising me for honest reporting. I'm glad I sent ut.
@rkobell @abarmostlikely @JessicaHuseman That's exactly what I did. I never changed context of a story, but I did revise quotes, as did Richard.
@DPMCanty @ZachWritesStuff Wrong. l never change a story but I send it to double check quotes in context. And I urge others to do same. Funny- AFLCIO Pres Trunks accuses me of twisting his words and I recorded him. I just can't win by trying to be accurate, can I?
@JessicaHuseman @abarmostlikely You've obviously an answer that you're trying to justify. Along w. sending  to the subject to check his quotes, I sent WHOLE ARTICLE to election law experts Jay O'Callaghan &amp; Hans von Soakovsky to double check complex terms he used on voter I'D. I hope you Don't have a problem.
@JessicaHuseman @abarmostlikely You believe what you want. Please read introduction to Cramer's "What it Takes" &amp; perhaps you'll understand more.
@abarmostlikely Very much so. Never was accused of misquoting anyone if I didn't record.
@abarmostlikely @JessicaHuseman If a reporter doesn't record, it is a good policy to run quotes past subject &amp; thus avoid "corrections" &amp; "retractions" from subbject later. Good lesson from late Richard Ben Cramer for his book "What it Takes." Dole, Bush etc. said controvsrsial stuff &amp; he ran it past them.
@ZachWritesStuff So the subject can never charge "out of context" or "distorted reporting," Before we had email or faxes, I was call &amp; reread whole grads (as Cramer did . Dole, Bush, etc. for his book(. Safest way is to simply record, which I urge my students at Nat'l. Journalism Ctr. to do.
@ZachWritesStuff if you Don't record, it's a good policy to run quotes past people--as the late Richard Ben Cramer taught w. "What It Takes." But if you do record, as I do most of the time, it is unnecessary.
@ZachWritesStuff Don't know what you mean. Please expatiate.

Along with Gov. Laxalt, other "special guest governors" made cameo appearances on "The Governor and J.J.," among them Bob Docking (D-KA), Dave Cargo (R.-NM), Deane Davis (R-VT), &amp; Winthrop Rockefeller (R.-Ark.).  Sadly, Ronald Reagan never appeared on this unique show.
Visiting Paul Laxalt on Sunday, I recalled that, as governor of Nevada, he played himself in a cameo on "The Governor and J.J.", with Dan Dailey as governor of an unnamed state and Julie Sommars as his daughter J.J.
@paul_L_obrien @AdamLaxaltNV @SenatorDole I expect a review from you.
@paul_L_obrien @AdamLaxaltNV @SenatorDole The definitive biography of the senator is his own memoir, "Nevada's Paul Laxalt," a signed copy of which I am looking at in my study right now.  Reagan, Howard Hughes, Rex Bell, the ploy to make Dick Schweiker VP w. Reagan in '76--it's all there.
@paul_L_obrien @AdamLaxaltNV @SenatorDole Wife Carol told me 'in 62 Paul was  https://t.co/rxDQgf8R8V running mate of Gov. nominee and cowboy actor Rex Bell, who was married (although legally separated) to "It Girl" Clara Bow.  While lt. gov, Bell made cameo in "The Misfits" starring old horseback riding pal Clark Gable
@paul_L_obrien @AdamLaxaltNV @SenatorDole More fascinating than his recollections of "Ron" Reagan are those of Howard Hughes, who set up hq. at the Desert Inn and wld call Gov. Laxalt at all hours ("It was always 'Mr. Hughes' &amp; 'Gov. Laxalt,'" recalled Paul, who got Hughes to help finance the state's community colleges.)
@paul_L_obrien &amp; a grand man he is--w. 6 children, 13 grandchildren (including @AdamLaxaltNV, who may follow Paul's footsteps &amp; become governor this fall), &amp; 4 great grandchildren.  And he almost surely will get a call from Bob @SenatorDole, reminding him he's a yr, younger than Paul.
4 days early, a happy birthday to my friend &amp;  one of the greatest of the greatest generation--former Sen. Paul Laxalt (R.-NV), "First Friend" of Ronald Reagan, ex-Gov. &amp; It. Gov. of Silver State, WW2 veteran. Enjoy your 96th b'day; Senator. Thx. for your service to our country!

@JamesMartinSJ @tdwilliamsrome @MassimoFaggioli You finally did get to the point in 3rd thread after making link in 1st thread between Law and McCarrick.  Don't see yet what this Pope has to do with McCarrick leaving--the resignation from the College was his choice alone, or so it is reported.
@JamesMartinSJ You should know better the history. Law himself was never charged w. a crime--only w. reassigning priests who abused authority. And the only way a cardinal loses title is thru death or his own choice. MCCARRICK himself is charged w. serious crime &amp; resigned from College.
@bromanmri @Pontifex @Card_R_Sarah I think a lot of people attribute things to Jesus He would be surprised to hear today.

@bromanmri @Pontifex @Card_R_Sarah I always use it and other terms that are used for multiple purposes and occasions. Dr. Coughlin called his program (&amp; His newspaper) "Social Justice" but I think he meant something other than those who mouth it today. Where did Jesus actually say this?

@IntelliTexan They did that already--in the US  w. the Keating Commn. &amp; with other mechanisms elsewhere. "Zero tolerance" was adopted by Benedict &amp; put scandals behind the Church for 10 yrs. McCarrick is 1st in yrs &amp; admittedly  the highest, but he will be dealt w.
@bromanmri @Pontifex @Card_R_Sarah Pre-conciliar--prefers form of worship, abstinence. &amp; reading from Council of Trent to late '60's, when liberals &amp; "social justice" Catholics tried to say it ended. JP2 &amp; Benedict slapped them down.
@IntelliTexan Apples and oranges
@IntelliTexan And very accurate. Because one high churchman apparently abused his position, the secular world is starting to condemn Mother Church &amp; her men &amp; women of faith. And he calls on them to "keep the faith." Good homily.
@HalFurman @Pontifex Since the stories date back decades--&amp; I heard some 20 yrs. ago--he probably HEARD a rumors on Uncle Ted. But Vatican insiders say JP2 never believed reports of misbehavior by priests, saying Communist gov'ts. spread lies all priests were homosexual. Ratzinger knew better.

@Michael_Zak OTR, Benedict's vision of "reforming the reform," Straightening out the errors of Vatican Ii, &amp; bringing traditional Catholics home was  upsetting the modernists &amp; I have no doubt they wanted him out. This Pope has touched none of Benedict's great legacy but has not advanced it.

@MacArdghail He finished 2nd only on 3rd &amp; final ballot, after Martini was out, but was a distant 3rd on 1st 2.Ratzinger led all along but his major rival was Martini. When he was out, protege Bergoglio picked up his support.

@EBOlady @AndrewFeinberg @PressSec @EBOlady needs help to end her misunderstanding of our histor.  I suggest reading "Thank You, Mr. President" by Merriman Smith or "Front Row at the WH," by late friend &amp; colleague Helen Thomas.  You will know better that there are no "setups"--only anticipating obvious questions.
@EBOlady @AndrewFeinberg @PressSec @BBCJamieCoo Among many new viewers of briefings, there's ignorance of the history.  As it was w. 9 press secs  I covered, when there's a top news story, they expect someone to ask question &amp; have remarks ready.  As it was w. @joshearnest on Bukima Faso, it was @PressSec on Paul.

What Rand Paul called for was major news this morning &amp; we discussed the question in our newsroom early.
Mandela, Prof. Gull said, "is someone you want as your leader but not in your family." He was so committed to a cause he was very negligent with his home life.
@karenlynnn @CJGoldenGal @costareports @DavidJollyFL @fran_chambers That's because you obviously know very little about the WH press corps--and my earlier tweets speak for themselves. As One who admires those who wear our country's uniform, I am disappointed you'd believe something that ludicrous. No colleague even thinks that.

@robmille @costareports @DavidJollyFL You're confused. Both were most gracious &amp; complimentary when Chris Matthew's tried to suggest something like that. In fact, as @DavidJollyFL put it in his tweet, "we shut him down." They know me too well. Please read the 8th Commandment. @costareports

Tom Ellis, who died yesterday at 97, was not only the pivotal player in electing and re-electing Sen. Jesse Helms, but was instrumental in the victory of Ronald Reagan in the '76 primary in NC and thus reviving his campaign after 4 straight defeats.
Saddened to learn that Raleigh lawyer Tom Ellis--consigliore to Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-NC) &amp; essentially Col. House to Helms' Woodrow Wilson, died at 97.  Mr. Ellis had a knack for what worked in politics and how to go for the political jugular.
In "NYPD" episode "Red Headed Pigeon," Patricia McAneny is outstanding--first-class--as Officer Virginia McKenzie, who sets out to trap rapist.  Now, friends in cyberspace, who can put me in touch with her?

Am RIVETED to "Red Headed Pigeon" episode on " NYPD!"(Jan. 1968). The rapist is downright frightening &amp; I am fast becoming a fan of the policewoman!
Am now watching very intense episode of "NYPD" entitled "The Red Headed Pigeon"--referring to a policewoman just out of the academy that helps the guys at the precinct trap a psychotic rapist.
@MichaelMcGough3 Brother Anthony! Seems to me there was some pre-conciliar prayer on his part.
I loved "NYPD" but was mad because in accepting role as Detective Johnny Corso, 	Frank Converse had to forego the much more intriguing role he played on "Coronet Blue" two years before (1965)&amp; thus the series could not be revived. Sad.
Delighted to see "NYPD" w. Jack Warden, Robt. Hooks, &amp; Frank Converse on youtube. All 2 seasons are there except the powerful pilot "Shakedown"--the first-ever dramatic treatment of homosexuality &amp; 1st to say the word "homosexual" on TV (Sept. '67).

@Papawore21 If I could take back the smug pleasure I felt when similar charges were leveled against Cardinal Bernadin--whom liberal, post-conciluar view--I would. His accuser recanted &amp; His Eminence not only forgave him but heard his last confession before he died.
@andreajenkyns may trigger the beginning of the end of @theresa_may and a resultant leadership fight for Tories.  May should have realized that, in her own words, "Brexit is Brexit"--nothing less.
@Duke_American Allen never ended any of his series, which is infortunate. How would you have brought "LOTG" to a conclusion?

@Duke_American And we just lost her one month ago. She was married to Don Matheson, Wilson the engineer, &amp; had a daughter Michele. Can see her in a remake!
@xIceBurg @millkman @newsmax No, and after I immediately believed Cardinal Bernadin's accuser and watching him recant all his charges &amp; apologize, I look for the best w. people &amp; hope for the best.
@xIceBurg @millkman One more thing: 30 yrs ago, I instinctively believed the charges of sex abuse by Stephen Cook against Cardinal Bernadin of Chicago--in part because I was not a fan of Bernadin.  In later yrs, Cook admitted he made 	false charges.  His Eminence forgave him and prayed with him.
Watched pilot of "Land of the Giants" &amp; it was pretty exciting.  But we see three giants--a boy and two scientists in a lab.  Not one of them says a word.  Why?
@ButtercupLeo Well, so be it.  I don't know any of the accusers but I do know Rep. Jordan,  And as I've said, I've been wrong on people before,  It's a tremendous disappointment.  In this case, it is just my personal feelings--&amp; I haven't reported anything.
@sbrad I hope for the best in people &amp; am a bit suspect of people who make charges--either after many years or immediately (Buzz Lukens in '90 and @dstrausskahn in '11 come to mind).  I was wrong on both of them, BUT when one is wrong, at least he can say he erred on the side of good.
@xIceBurg @millkman Who?

@jesseepstein To be honest, I had hoped for vindication for @dstrausskahn, whom I had covered at the IMF &amp; felt was going to be the Socialist nominee for President of France in '12.  It didn't happen (although he was never and has never been convicted of a crime).
@paul_L_obrien @DCLatinMass To be perfectly honest, I don't know enough about his situation to comment intelligently. Personally, I am suspicious of charges that emerge decades later--the late Cardinal Bernadine's accuser, who later recanted, being a case in point.
@jesseepstein Exactly. &amp; I have a long history of praying for people who are charged w. something long ago to fight back &amp; overcome the charges to be vindicated in the court of public opinion.  Sadly, I have been disappointed mostly--going back to my friend Rep. Buzz Lukens (R-OH) in 1990.
@jesseepstein Because this WH reporter hopes the best is true about people he has coverd--&amp; has been disappointed over the yrs.  That's regardless of party.  I hoped charges against Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich) were false, &amp; that his career wouldn't end on the note it did.  I was disappointed.
@JenNWCbus Will look into both.  What do you think of Huffman?
Am hoping Rep. Jim Jordan (R.-OH) overcomes these charges he ignored sexual abuse of students while a college wrestling coach but it doesn't look good.  Word is that State Sen. Matt Huffman is "on deck" to pinch hit for Jordan as GOP nominee in 4th CD if Jordan goes down.

@PeterAlexander @Politics1com I would add Judge Amul Thapar as the "mystery nominee."
@kjbert I stand corrected.  "Seinfeld" concluded in 1998 but premiered, as you say, nearly 30 years ago--1989.
Never quite understood what kind of a country in which "Spindrift" landed in "Land of the Giants"--people looked like us, dressed like us, drove cars, watched TV but were under an authoritarian gov't.?  Someone explain the politics of "Land of the Giants" to me after 50 yrs?
20 years ago today, "Seinfeld" premiered.  Wonder if the gang will ever have a reunion show?

@helynbolanis "The Ugly American" with Marlon Brando was great and am trying to obtain "Hercules' with Steve Reeves.
@FrancoisF24 Now I know what the story of the Polish court reform's ancestor is:  FDR's court-packing scheme of 1937, which would have allowed him to pick a new Supreme Court justice whenever a current justice turns 70.  It didn't go anywhere but the term "ct packing" lives.
From @FrancoisF24 I learned that Poland has the 6th largest economy in Europe.  If the EU pushes too much and Karcynski takes Poland out, the EU is doomed.
@FrancoisF24 It was dramatic seeing @LechWalesa1 re-enter politics as a civil libertarian denouncing Kacynski over the court issue.  It was only a few years back he was defending the Austrian Freedom Party and Haider!
Next time you have Kacynski on, why not run clips from the hit 1962 film with his late brother: "Those Two Stole the Moon?"  @FrancoisF24
It was interesting to see Donald Tusk, who emerged from the center-left in Polish politics, quoting Hayek during his speech in Austria. @FrancoisF24 I guess anyone can reinvent himself in Brussels.

@EBOlady @jaketapper Neither. As a stident of history, I can say Matthews is not taken seriously as is, say, Robt. Dallek (w. whom I disagree on a lot, but respect &amp; reviewed his JFK bio favorably). But pls.--ask a true historian, @DPietrusza, what he thinks of Matthews as an historian?
@EBOlady @jaketapper Watching Matthew's try to write history is like watching a duck make love to a football. This is his writing what he wanted history to be--and no radio report said McCarthy drank himself to death.
@EBOlady @jaketapper It's as if you're telling us you know something that biographers of RFK nor his own family ever revealed.
@EBOlady @jaketapper JFK was the lone Senate Democrat not to vote for censure.  He claimed his recovery from surgery kept him from voting.  The censure, voted on by full Senate, was for McCarthy's refusal to comply w. a probe of alleged campaign finance violations &amp; critical comments about colleagues
@EBOlady @jaketapper I doubt seriously "ruthless Robert" felt that way.  And remember--McCarthy was backed by so many prominent Roman Catholics, notably Francis Cardinal Spellman of NY.
@EBOlady @jaketapper No.  As a reporter, I just cited it as a fact.  And I don't need RFK or anyone to justify McCarthy--I've read everything about him one can read and admire him tremendously.
@EBOlady @jaketapper If he voiced any criticism of McCarthy or felt he was "destructive", he never told anyone. In 1959, he walked out of a dinner when the speaker was Edward R. Murrow &amp; he launched an attack on McCarthy (two yrs. after his death).  Source: "Blacklisted by History," by Stanton Evans.

@ChanceBGardener @realSweetBrian @brianstelter The Interior Ministry's report was issued May 2018 &amp; said violent crime is down 4.9% from previous. All other crimes are down &amp;, the ministry, concluded overall  crime is down 5.1% from '17.
@DanielA07992875 @realSweetBrian @brianstelter It may have at first but the Interior Ministry reports indicates it is on decline after 3 years. The problem w. people who want to believe crime is up is that they always cite statistics that ate dated.
@ChanceBGardener @realSweetBrian @brianstelter All of what you cite is outdated. As I said, read the Interior Minister's report of May 2018.
@Estelle_CSC @realSweetBrian @brianstelter Use your mouth better. And if you have a problem with statistics, it is with the German Interior Ministry and their May 2018 report on crime.
@ChanceBGardener @realSweetBrian @brianstelter That information is dated.
@ChanceBGardener @brianstelter The Interior Ministry said they are down &amp; what makes it interesting is that Minister Seehofer is a sworn enemy of Merkel's asylum policy.
The irony is Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who provided the statistics about German crime declining contradicting @realDonaldTrump. also wants to implement a zero tolerance policy on German border to return illegal immigrants.  Merkel rejected it &amp; they are at dagger's ends.

@HRMCookieQueen Figures are from the German Interior Ministry, headed by Horst Seehofer (no friend of Merkel).  Drop in crime by 5.1% was from 2017 to 2018 and the figures--violent crime, burglary, etc.--all represent drops during the same yrs.  Take up figures w. Min. Seehofer.

Incredible!  In "Greeks Bearing Gifts," as in his previous Bernie Guenther books, Philip Kerr includes explanations of real-life characters and businesses &amp; notes Munich RE freely admits on its website its ties to Nazi gov't. even to point of insuring gas chambers at Auschwitz.
Philip Kerr's attention to detail in "Greeks Bearing Gifts" is matchless: he writes how Munich RE, top insurance company, is open about how their lst chairman Kurt Schmidt was economics minister under Hitler and his successor Alois Alzheimer joined Nazi Party.

@janet444 @patrice_noonan @PatrickBuchanan If he didn't agree with him, he certainly didn't tell anyone.  Read any bio of RFK &amp; you won't find a critical word about McCarthy.  And in 1959, RFK walked out of a dinner at which the speaker was Edward R. Murrow--still critical of McCarthy two years after his death.

Interesting how all these witnesses are cheered in press for standing up to committee.
@sarahmorriseuro @PSOE your reporting is more important now than ever.  This is unprecedented in Spanish history.

@patrice_noonan @janet444 @PatrickBuchanan I don't, &amp; I agree with Goldwater, America is a better place because he lived.
@janet444 @patrice_noonan @PatrickBuchanan One person who certainly revered his memory was his former committee counsel and friend, Robert Kennedy.  RFK not only attended his wake and funeral but accompanied the body back to Wisconsin for burial.
@EBOlady @StevenFittro @realDonaldTrump @MacArdghail @DPietrusza @PatrickBuchanan I did watch the video and it offers nothing new at all.  And its presentation of Welch and McCarthy totally ignores the background that Fisher's background was revealed by Welch himself in NYT: https://t.co/hWQTE69yQI
@patrice_noonan @janet444 @PatrickBuchanan You can believe what you want but he was absolutely right and those who were hurt deserved it.  As Barry Goldwater said upon his death, "Because he lived, America is a brigher, safer, more vigilant land today."
@janet444 @patrice_noonan @PatrickBuchanan To quote another hero of mine, Barry Goldwater: "Do not mourn Joe McCarthy.  Be thankful that he lived, at the right time, and according to the talents vested in him by his Maker."
@StevenFittro @realDonaldTrump All you have shown is a copy of a list of committee membership and staff.  And I'm not denying that was probably said in committee at the time.  But that was not the focus of that particular committee at all.
@StevenFittro @EBOlady @realDonaldTrump Since the term was in common use (in newspapers too) at the time, I'm sure you found someone who said that during the hearings.  And you don't attribute it to anyone--Roy Cohn, maybe?  @MacArdghail @DPietrusza @PatrickBuchanan
@StevenFittro @realDonaldTrump Again, you're talking about the Hoey Committee, which was entirely different from McCarthy (and chaired by a Democrat).  Kindly name one person investigated by McCarthy who wasn't a Communist.  The definitive book, "Blacklisted by History," spells each case.
@patrice_noonan Hmmm...I'm quoting Drew Person's own diary &amp; contemporaneous accounts of the 1946  Senate primary in Wisconsin. It doesn't get more factual than that. @DPietrusza @MacArdghail @PatrickBuchanan
@patrice_noonan You haven't given me a single fact. I'm giving you background &amp; documentation. Again, You're entitled to your opinion but You're not entitled to facts.
@patrice_noonan I'll respond to every one of the names, gladly. He didn't accuse Pearson of being a Communist but his legman. In the 1st volume of his diaries, Pearson admitted he was a Communist &amp; it had been a mistake to hire him.
@patrice_noonan That may have been true some years back, but the most recent books on McCarthy--by Arthur Hermann &amp; Stanton Evans--show otherwise.
@patrice_noonan As Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, "You are entitled to your opinion, but you are not entitled the facts."
@EBOlady @NBCNews The entire scene was a fraud &amp; Welsh was acting on something he had made public. Please get a copy of "BLACKLISTED by History" &amp; you will see the facts documented.
@StevenFittro @realDonaldTrump You're changing your argument now. The only people his investigations affected were those who deserved it. And guess what? By the late '50's, thevKremlun pulled back most of its spies because too many had been exposed.
@patrice_noonan McCarthy never investigated a single screen writer or author. That was done by the House Committee on Un-American Activities--and as Allan Ryskind's book on those investigations concludes, they were spot on.
@patrice_noonan LaFollette suffered badly from being isolationist before WWII &amp; young Republicans wanted McCarthy- an internationalist &amp; strong supporter of civil rights FOR blacks. Communism had nothing to do w. the '46 primary, hailed by DC Post as sign of changing GOP.
@EBOlady @StevenFittro @realDonaldTrump I've seen the film--McCarthy is reading something that Welch himself told the press &amp; the NYT put on Page One.  He didn't "assassinate this lad".  Instead of simply watching something, I suggest you read the background--please get M. Stanton Evans' "Blacklisted by History."
@StevenFittro @realDonaldTrump You're confusing McCarthy's investigations with those of the Hoey Committee, out of which that question came.  These were two different things entirely.
@EBOlady @StevenFittro @realDonaldTrump I certainly am a fan.  The quote from Welch-is one of the phoniest lines in history. Wks before, Welch himself told the NY Times Fred Fisher wld not be co-counsel because he had been a member of the Nat'l. Lawyers Guild.  McCarthy repeated what Welch said &amp; the NYT put on Page 1
@patrice_noonan @PatrickBuchanan Name one person he "blacklisted" who was innocent
@oconnellap @PatrickBuchanan OK.  So the proper verb is that "Msgr. Quinn _____the nuptial Mass with two other priests?"
@StevenFittro @realDonaldTrump I'm a fan of McCarthy, and just report on Trump. One of the best bid on him was "BLACKLISTED by History," demonstrating the McCarthy never investigated anyone who wasn't a likely Comminist apparatchik.
@oconnellap @PatrickBuchanan It wasn't? Msgr. Quinn celebrated the Mass with another priest. I have always heard the proper term was concelebrated but I am always open to correction.

Mo's Gov. Greitens joins the list of greatest Presidential candidates who never were.  In 1970, it was widely thought a future Demo ticket would be Lt. Govs. Mark Hogan (Col.) &amp; Ben Barnes (TX).  They just had to win govships....but didn't.  Hogan lost  in '70 &amp; Barnes in '72.

@HNTurtledove OK, cards on the table: how in the world did you come up with Charles Lafollette, obscure congressman from Indiana (Wisconsin in your series), as president following Al Smith?
@Politics1com He sure did!.  The late Steve Neal's bio tells how Louis was moved Willkie spoke to black bellhops, train porters, and kitchen staff wherever he went and appeared to be without prejudice.  At a time Dems embraced segregationists in South, Willkie vowed to end color barriers.
So loved hearing Joan Merrill in "Time Out for Rhythm" (1941) that I listened to her other hit--"You Can't Say No to a Solider" ("Nor a Sailor Nor a Handsome Marine")--from film "Iceland."  So appropriate for Memorial Day.
Little noticed in pardoning of Jack Johnson was that at a time more black voters were still supporting Republicans (as a bow to Lincoln), the former heavyweight champ campaigned hard for FDR's re-election in 1936 &amp; was key to moving blacks into Democratic column.

I almost forgot: Superb music for "Time Out for Rhythm" (1941) provided by Glen Gray and his Casa Loma orchestra!
In "Time Out for Rhythm" (1941), it's a delight to see men and women dressed formally to go out for dinner and dancing at the Skyline Club--and lots of smoking, when America was inarguably freer.
Really wonder why Joan Merrill never did more than a handful of movies.  She was a striking woman as well as a talented singer.  And she played herself in "Time Out for Rhythm." (1941).
Although I felt "The 3 Stooges" stole the show in "Time Out for Rhythm"(1941), I must say it was an all-star cast: Rudy Vallee, Rosemary Lane, Allan Jenkins (superb character actor), and Ann Miller--then just starting out but already a stellar tap dancer.
After listening to Joan Merrill's stirring rendition of "As if You Didn't Know" in "Time Out for Rhythm" (1941), I had to listen to her perform her signature number "There Will Never Be Another You"--from "Iceland," starring John Payne.
In "Time Out for Rhythm" (1941), the 3 Stooges stole the show with the rumba dancing, featuring Curley dressed as Carmen Miranda.
Started watching "Time Out For Rhythm"(1941) to see the unique humor of "The 3 Stooges" but was delighted (&amp; moved to tears) by Joan Merrill singing the romantic ballad "As If You Didn't Know."

@EBOlady @MacArdghail @ReaganWorld @DPietrusza One of the finest benefits of the Latin Mass is no one waves, stops to talk, or smiles at me. All are in prayer to God, not at a community center to meet and greet.

@EBOlady @MacArdghail @ReaganWorld @DPietrusza Read "The Traditionalist" &amp; see from A-Z the syllabus of errors if this Pope--from picking fights w. the Knights of Malta to belittling young TCM Catholics. It reads like articles of impeachment.
@EBOlady @MacArdghail @ReaganWorld @DPietrusza Don't understand what this "rigidity" is or where this "industrialised world" has to change faith. And I don't judge other means of worship or whether it will achieve salvation-- respect all faiths &amp; can only say  so hope God judges me worthy of being w. Him in paradise.
@EBOlady @MacArdghail @ReaganWorld @DPietrusza Oh, what is?
@MacArdghail @EBOlady @ReaganWorld @DPietrusza I know what you mean--some people who claim Catholicism peddle some pretty un-Catholic stuff.
@EBOlady @MacArdghail @ReaganWorld @DPietrusza I'm not worried about you. It's the liberal bishops that make it difficult for traditionalists to have the Mass martyrs died for. Benefit  started "reform of the reform" so we could have easy access to our way of worship. A future Pope will see us through.

@EBOlady @MacArdghail @ReaganWorld @DPietrusza My problem w. people who day "Rome burns" or Jesus taught "social justice" is that they almost always imply that the form of worship is unimportant after these things. So let it remain what it is. Not this Catholic! Not my church!

@EBOlady I know about how Latin Mass Catholics are treated for a fact.  @MacArdghail @ReaganWorld @DPietrusza The facts speak for themselves.  The latter I will withhold judgment on until some hard facts are presented.
@EBOlady @PressSec @MajorCBS I do care how it is celebrated because the present vernacular Mass is devoid of mystery and reverance to God--beginning with the fact that the priest is an MC and not a messenger to God (as he is when he faces the altar ad orientum).  &amp; I feel closer to God.
@EBOlady @PressSec @MajorCBS @Pontifex I've quoted this Pope frequently when he warns of "the culture of indifference."  I was critical of this President for promising an omnibus infrastructure measure and not delivering.  But when this Pope belittles young believing Catholics, he's not speaking any truths.
@mikewarder1 Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.  I am a HUGE Stooges fan! So is @skyranchMIS
@EBOlady @PressSec @MajorCBS Let me respectfully urge you to read "The Traditionalist" magazine, which details the struggle TLM advocates face.  That said, I do believe time is on our side because whenever churches close, groups such as the Fraternity of St. Peter save them so long as they can say TLM.
@EBOlady @PressSec @MajorCBS You obviously are un familiar with the "Liturgy Wars," now raging in the Church.  Benedict was moving toward equalization of Latin w. the vernacular and this @Pontifex has not undone that--you're right!--but makes disparaging comments.  Quote is from a bk of interviews with him.
@FrenettMarco @EBOlady @PressSec @MajorCBS Agreed. That was a favorite of my father's.
@FrenettMarco @EBOlady @PressSec @MajorCBS You're a good man Stan.  I often admit when I'm out of my element and admire those who follow the admonition of a junior high school teacher of mine: "Know what you don't know."
@FrenettMarco @EBOlady @PressSec @MajorCBS Not at all.  The Mass and worship transcend anyone who sits on the throne of St. Peter &amp; the Council of Trent made this abundantly clear.  The Council of Trent spoke "ex cathedra."  The Pope to the reporter did not.

@SeptemberMay Anyone who gives you the time I have--even to someone who admits she "wasn't looking for answers"--deserves all due respect.  And I don't need to justify any position, nor does any other reporter.  We do our jobs.
@SeptemberMay @JayCarneyII @BarackObama @joshearnest @PressSec So I truly hope you are learning a bit about the history and the etiquette of the Briefing Room.
@tstef1979 @SeptemberMay Thank you.  But I feel sorry for @tstef and wanted to try to teach her something about the way the Briefing Room operates.  I hope she has learned something new.
@SeptemberMay I've answered you quite aptly and completely--something that if I did for everyone, I'd never get work done.  Now I must write on Speaker Ryan &amp; the Freedom Caucus.  Adieu.
@SeptemberMay Nor did I have an issue when @JayCarneyII was press secretary &amp; called on me infrequently.  It's up to the Press Sec.  &amp; when it's crowded, some don't get called on.

@SeptemberMay I don't dismiss ANYONE's comments.  I would never hurt another American--not ever.  BUT to suggest that someone's question is somehow more equal than that of another--or in this case, two others--is not advocating for journalists or journalism.
@SeptemberMay Apparently, fellow correspondents have a different view.  There was a followup question to mine about Ryan and none about the other matter.  It seems others have a different sense of "urgency."
@SeptemberMay If you were listening, you would have heard my question which was whether the President agreed with conservatives who--while having differences with Speaker Ryan--want him to complete his term.  And there was a follow-up by a colleague.

Always wished Faith Whittlesey had run for GOP nod for Congress from Delaware Cty in 1978.  With GOP nominee Sonny Metz losing to Democratic Rep. Bob Edgar by about 1%, Faith just might have pulled it off &amp; been an early conservative leader in the House.
Faith Whittlesey was as important to the modern conservative movement in Pennsylvania as Margaret Thatcher was to its British counterpart in the 1960's.
Faith Whittlesey liked to tell me how in 1978, she would have won the Republican nomination for lt. governor of Pennsylvania except for the fact "my opponent was named William Scranton III"--namesake son of the popular former governor and 1964 presidential candidate.
Very much like SW (Smarter Wife) in Michigan, Faith Whittlesey in 1972 entered the Penn. House of Reps and won her first election while pregnant with her third child.
"Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did," Faith Whittlesey famously said, "but she did it backwards and in high heels."
So saddened by news tonight that Faith Whittlesey--atty, politician, author, ambassador to Switzerland and a top aide to President Reagan--died at 79 after a long bout with cancer.  Will pray hard for her family and will miss her tremendously.

@Tony_Glorioso FYI--I don't believe in questioning people if one knows answer &amp; is out to trap. McCain knew reporters asking him to name ldrs of different ctries knew he didn't know the names &amp; just dismissed them. St. Peter knew the woman in the garden was out to finger him &amp; thus denied Jesus

@Tony_Glorioso I don't actually &amp;, taking a cue from John McCain &amp; St. Peter, I hate quesions in which the questioner knows answer. My point is I want to know more--why Mueller, w. strong case,  opted for a plea on a serious charge? I'd pose. same question if the prosecutor was Rudy Giuliani.

@CheriJacobus President Harley Hudson, in Allen Drury's "Preserve &amp; Protect."
@Carlos8791 @dougducey It is taken for granted that when a powerful senator is dying, his wife or anyone of his choice will be named to succeed him.  The wives of Democratic Sens. Hubert Humphrey (MN) &amp; Huey Long (LA), for example, were named to their late husbands' seat.
A gentleman to the end, John McCain never criticizes his actual '08 choice for VP--@SarahPalinUSA.  But in voicing regret he didn' turn to Lieberman, McCain lets us know he wished it wasn't Palin.
The Times said any talk of a successor to Sen. McCain is forbidden among his inner circle, but Gov. @dougducey has a list of appointees acceptable to McCain and the list includes Cindy McCain.
NYT says John McCain regrets he didn't pick Sen. Joe Lieberman (D.-CT) as his '08 runningmate--the only time a Republican presidential nominee picked a Democratic vp since Abe Lincoln turned to Tenn. Gov. Andrew Johnson in 1864.

In the dynamic climax of "Man on a Tightrope," the lion tamer--who is considered cowardly--gets a look from Cernik's mother, then leaps into the action, shooting at Communist border guards with his tamer's pistol, until he is finally gunned down.
Powerful ending in "Man on a Tightrope," as the Cernik circus, with clowns, elephants, dwarfs, and a marching band--sets off a bomb and breaks through the border barriers to freedom in Bavaria.
In "Man on a Tightrope," Adolph Menjou--combative anti-communist--plays the Czech minister of propaganda who suspects that the Cernik circus is planning a breakout from the country.

Couldn't make your beautiful Mass but watched it on EWTN.  Everything you said about what we lost the Latin Mass and how we are recovering it with so many young people is what I've said for years. Bravo! Pax, Your Eminence.
@LucilleSoong Watched you being smothered in the steam room at the opening of "The Avengers'" classic episode "The Medicine Men."  Started off with a bang but it made me think: "Someone that beautiful has got to come back somewhere." You did!  Glad I found you!
Delighted to find the latest royal--named for the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten--also shares the name of my late uncle and godfather, Louis Gizzi.  A grand fellow.
@oconnellap Based on the research Archbishop Sample did on changes made to the Mass in the name of Vatican II but never sanctioned by the Council, @Pontifex should issue a solemn apology to all Catholics who were denied the form of worship for generations that spawned saints and martyrs.
@oconnellap Sadly, I was preparing for the White House Correspondents Assn.  dinner and delivering tickets to the @NewsmaxTV guests.  I would have loved to have been there but I did watch it on youtube.  It was powerful!
In recalling the history of the Latin Mass at the Basillica, Archbishop Sample said it was the Mass for generations of Catholics including "my parents...it was important to my father's own conversion."
The sad side of Archbishop Sample's journey with the Latin Mass is that Pope Benedict should have made him a cardinal when he had time and this pope surely won't.
What stood out so much on EWTN broadcast of Archbishop Sample's Latin Mass Saturday is the great number of young people there and how they rediscover what he called "the Mass of the ages"--which "nourished generations of Catholics."
Moved by Archbishop Sample's personal journey with the traditional Latin Mass--reading his parents' Missals, studying it (trying to remember "What comes next?"), his jealousy of other priests permited to say the Mass under Elesia Dei, &amp; then Benedict XVI's Summarum Pontificum.

@groaningpig I do too--absolutely spellbound with Lenore Aubert as Sandra Mornay.
After he split w. Bud Abbott in '57 and before his death in '59, Lou Costello was clearly trying to establish himself as a dramatic actor thru appearances on "Wagon Train" and "GE Theatre" (hosted by Ronald Reagan).  He was also on "Tonight Show," doing old routines w. Louis Nye
One thing that stands out in Lou Costello's "This Is Your Life" is that both Abbott and Costello--no doubt aware the IRS was after them for back taxes--are clearly aged.  The move they were making at the time, "Dance With Me Henry" fared poorly at box office &amp; was their last.
On "This is Your Life," Bud Abbott is vividly trying to be warm to Lou Costello--&amp; speaks of a brief breakup they had in '45 but patched up-- but Lou is visibly distant.  A yr. later ('57), they broke up &amp; never spoke again. The IRS also came down hard on both for back taxes.
RT @Ryanexpress77: @johngizzi Here you go John,   https://t.co/TOhjpmQsUh

@FrenettMarco @PressSec Yes, you do need my help if you are going to talk in thus tone. And I don't "accuse" my colleagues of anything-- just repeated What many said before,during &amp; after Macron's news conference. Period.
@FrenettMarco @PressSec Now you've got me reading &amp; researching. At 1938 state dinner for King &amp; Queen of England, FDR invited several Republicans, including potential foes. Introducing Sen. Arthur Vandenburg (R.-Mich) to King George, FOR said:"He wants my job but he'll never, ever get it."
@FrenettMarco @PressSec Let me help you. Boehner never went to many state dinners (I suspect) because it was difficult for him to go outside to smoke. But he dud play golf w. Obama &amp; on courses where both could smoke their brains out.
@FrenettMarco @PressSec Cool your jets! The 1st I heard about the dinner was during the Macron press conference, &amp; reporters kept saying"No Democrats" were invited.

@bromanmri Don't think she has the clout w. Macron. Here, I'm flanked by @MajorCBS
Why is Macron-Trump news conference delayed a full hour?
In last row, at East Room, waiting for Macron &amp; Trump.
@lauhaim Look at crowd beneath you!
@JoyCTV I see you! &amp; Paul, too. I can"t believe Macron is making us wait an hour. Maybe he went back to hotel to use shampoo &amp; wear a lighter suit.
