@SenWarren And, about persons with disabilities receiving Social Security, most receive  $700 a month. That little bit of income does not help much when they are waiting longer for housing or other assistance to fill in the gap‘s when they are not  working.
@SenWarren If you are capable enough to use Twitter and comment then you can look up some of the facts in the prior post.
@SenWarren 14 C of the FLSA allowed this unfortunately some corporations used this legislation to their advantage in exploiting fully capable qualified persons with disabilities not those whom the legislation was designed for.
