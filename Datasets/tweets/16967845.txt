Millions of people‚Äîespecially women and, disproportionately, women of color‚Äîstruggle to support themselves on poverty-level wages. What better way to begin this historic Congress than by working to ensure working people receive equal and adequate pay? #FightFor15 #RaiseTheWage
Did you know that federal law allows employers to pay tipped workers, people with disabilities, and young workers less than the full minimum wage? We need Congress to #RaiseTheWage so ALL working people are ensured a fair minimum wage.
In all 50 states, data shows a single worker currently needs or will soon need at least $15 an hour to cover basic living costs. The Raise the Wage Act of 2019 would help ensure that more working people throughout the country will be able to make ends meet. #RaiseTheWage
Nearly 2/3 tipped workers are women, for whom the federal minimum cash wage is just $2.13/hr. Tell Congress to #RaiseTheWage for tipped workers everywhere. #FightFor15 https://t.co/okhRlxY5MP

The Federal School Safety Commission was a sham from the start. Trump and DeVos used it as a vehicle to ignore the civil rights of Black and brown students, promote their pro-gun agenda, and endanger the lives of students around the country.
More guns, more police, more opportunities for schools to discriminate. Black and brown students will pay the price for these recommendations. And Trump and DeVos know it.
The report is also a blatant attack on Black and brown students, esp. girls of color, as the commission wants the Dept. of Ed to rescind the 2014 #ReThinkDiscipline guidance which encourages schools to address racial disparities in discipline.
There‚Äôs so much wrong with the Federal School Safety Commission report, but on a basic level this group was formed in response to gun violence in school and yet they:	‚úÖ Refused to consider limiting guns in school	‚úÖ Decided more guns in school is a-okay https://t.co/uMQwCWtk48

Let‚Äôs be clear: Every person who works in schools has a moral obligation to protect every student. Every student has a moral and legal right to learn free of sexual harassment of any kind. And they all deserve a meaningful say over these rules. https://t.co/egn1zQHBxT
The premise of these draft rules is sexist, and the consequences for survivors would be devastating. Unfortunately, the issues we‚Äôve described are just the tip of the iceberg of what‚Äôs wrong with these regulations.
These rules spring from glaringly sexist biases, spread in bad faith by people who value boys‚Äô and men‚Äôs reputations more highly than everyone else‚Äôs safety. (And note: boys and men are far more likely to be victims of sexual assault than to be falsely accused of it.)
Worse, as part of these sham investigations, survivors could be pressured to go through mediation or cross-examination procedures that force them into close contact with their perpetrators. The potential for retraumatization cannot be overstated.
Keep in mind: people face huge hurdles and risks when they come forward with their experiences of sexual harassment. Virtually everyone who does so is telling the truth. Dismissing these complaints often means putting others at risk of being abused by the same abuser.
Her rules would let schools conduct openly biased investigations that begin with the presumption that students who report sexual misconduct may be lying, instead of weighing both sides‚Äô stories and futures equally.
DeVos is also trying to limit when a school has to help survivors based on who they tell. This would encourage the very cultures of complicity that allowed serial predators like Larry Nassar and Jerry Sandusky to repeatedly abuse students for decades. https://t.co/FpaPbG9sGl
How is she going about it? First, she‚Äôs trying to narrow the definition of sexual harassment so severely that students would have to suffer repeated and worsening harassment before anyone in their school is required to help them.
Sexual trauma is a key driver of school pushout for girls, women, &amp; nonbinary students. DeVos should know that. Yet she‚Äôs chosen to focus on shielding perpetrators &amp; schools from the consequences of their actions, making schools more dangerous for all. https://t.co/FpaPbGr3xT

Women and survivors everywhere are watching to see how Ramirez and Dr. Blasey Ford are treated. They are weighing their own experiences against the toll that Kavanaugh and his allies will try to extract. #believesurvivors
This confirmation process has introduced us to outstanding examples of decency and fortitude, but not from Brett Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez and Dr. Blasey Ford have lifted their voices for all of us. It's horrifying to watch as their heroism is met with cruelty. #believesurvivors
We don‚Äôt need more of Kavanaugh‚Äôs tired talking points and unconvincing denials. What we need is to listen to people of integrity‚Äîthose who have the courage to speak truth in the face of an immensely powerful opposition. People like Dr. Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez.

@realDonaldTrump, @ChuckGrassley, @LindseyGrahamSC, @senorrinhatch and more, we see how willing you are to destroy women‚Äôs lives in order to consolidate your power. 		And we won‚Äôt forget.
We‚Äôre tired of listening to hordes powerful men attempt to attack and discredit Dr. Blasey Ford simply because they want to rush their problematic, unpopular, extremist nominee onto the Supreme Court.
The FBI has been called in to investigate nominees before, even after a background check has been completed, if new information comes forward. This is not out of the ordinary. This is within their jurisdiction. Suggesting anything else is a blatant lie.
And that‚Äôs where an FBI investigation comes in. For Kavanaugh, this is a job interview ‚Äî he should be investigated because he is a nominee for a LIFETIME JOB on the Supreme Court.
In bringing this experience to light, Dr. Blasey Ford had nothing to gain and everything to lose, in high school and today. She didn‚Äôt want to come forward at all, until public scrutiny made it impossible for her to stay anonymous.
After all, according to @rainn, for every 1,000 sexual assaults, 994 perpetrators will walk free. In other words: rapists are rarely, rarely held accountable.  https://t.co/mwlLuGeKqo https://t.co/UdCwpY6ER7
Law enforcement will often question the motives and actions of those who report, and many see no upside to initiating a criminal investigation that is unlikely to end in conviction.
Those factors make it difficult to recognize assault for what it is. 		In the 1980s, when many people were just starting to understand the idea of ‚Äùdate rape‚Äù ‚Äî that sexual assault was more frequently perpetrated by acquaintances rather than strangers ‚Äî this was even more true.
In addition, survivors may not fully realize that what happened to them was actually assault. Trauma affects people differently ‚Äî and our society typically blames victims of sexual assault, which means sometimes victims blame themselves.
People don‚Äôt report assault because our culture is conditioned to doubt and blame survivors. From social circles to law enforcement, many survivors are met with skepticism, ostracized, and sometimes punishment for coming forward.
More than 1 in 5 girls ages 14-18 report that they have been kissed or sexually touched without their consent, but only 2% of girls ages 14-18 report sexual harassment and violence to their school or the police. https://t.co/HZQGkXzcH3
Research shows that, in fact, both the timing and way Dr. Blasey Ford brought her story forward is absolutely typical to the way most survivors of sexual assault come forward with their stories. https://t.co/yS0x4nK07r
There is no ‚Äúperfect‚Äù survivor. The idea that a 15 yo girl who experienced assault would have immediately reported it to the police, or even her parents, is ridiculous and insulting to the thousands of women and girls who have experienced sexual assault and the ensuing trauma.
Let‚Äôs break down the rape myths you are pushing to discredit a survivor. 		First, many people don‚Äôt report their assaults. Why? Look at what is happening to Dr. Blasey Ford DECADES after this happened.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford is getting death threats. She had to leave her house. Just for telling her truth.		@realdonaldtrump, you‚Äôre a monster. https://t.co/WbgtvhKr1p

Listen to Anita Hill. Listen to women. The Senate must ensure a fair, nonpartisan investigation of these allegations before any vote.
‚Äú...the investigator‚Äôs neutrality is crucial. The FBI proved not to be a neutral fact finder in investigating my complaint. As part of the executive branch there is, at the very least, an appearance of alliance to the president whose nominee is being investigated.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe investigation should be handled by a nonpartisan body or individual in the role of a neutral fact finder, experienced in investigating sexual harassment matters.¬†In investigating sensitive issues follow-up interviews should be the norm, not the exception.‚Äù
‚ÄúI did not choose the issue of sexual harassment, rather the issue chose me, nor did I choose to testify publicly or make this an issue of public concern.‚Äù
‚Äú[Y]ou pandered to myths and misconceptions about women in general and sexual harassment in particular or simply failed to distinguish myth from reality and created a world where sexual harassment is a figment of an accuser‚Äôs imagination.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnything less than a balanced approach condemns women to second-class status and the Court to members who abuse power and authority granted to them in public trust. Such a person can in no case be the ‚Äòbest man (or woman) for the job.‚Äô‚Äù
‚ÄúNeither the issue of harassment nor the nomination was served by a presumption of my untruthfulness or a process skewed in favor of whoever was able and willing to engage in the dirtiest political ‚Äògamesmanship.‚Äô‚Äù
"The hearing lacked...balance in terms of credibility‚Äîmine certainly equaled Thomas‚Äô in the matter‚Äìand balance in terms of process; the weight of the Senate and the Executive should not have been used against an individual citizen called upon to participate in a public process."

A4.3: Instead of taking away food from families with children, like the House #FarmBill proposes, the Senate Farm Bill recognizes the struggle to access quality child care and protects SNAP for these families. #FoodFri
A4.2: Low-wage jobs are plagued by unpredictable work schedules with nonstandard hours &amp; few benefits like paid sick leave. &amp; many child care providers do not provide care during non-standard hours, making it hard for low-wage working parents to balance caregiving &amp; work.#FoodFri

A3.2: There‚Äôs a conference committee negotiating a final Farm Bill. Conferees should adopt the Senate Farm Bill provisions protecting SNAP and strengthening the program. #FoodFri

A2.3: The House #FarmBill proposal would restrict categorical eligibility, an option states can use to extend SNAP to working families with incomes just over the income eligibility cut-off. #FoodFri
A2.2: The Senate Farm Bill protects the autonomy of #dvsurvivors and does not include the House Bill‚Äôs child support mandate. Farm Bill conferees should also reject this unnecessary and potentially dangerous provision. #FoodFri

This conclusion would give employers a blank check to sexually exploit and engage in many of the most despicable forms of discrimination against undocumented workers. #StopKavanaugh

2/ Kavanaugh said he did his "level best" to consider Jane Doe's situation.		His "level best" is denying a young woman her right to make decisions about her body and access medical care. #StopKavanaugh
FACT CHECK 1/ Kavanaugh gets it so, so wrong when asked about his decision in #JusticeForJane and his answer makes it CRYSTAL CLEAR that if given the opportunity, he would undermine the right to an abortion. #StopKavanaugh

The "n-word" case Kavanaugh described is Ayissi-Etoh v Fannie Mae. In it, he recognized that a boss calling an employee the n-word is racial harassment. This is the BARE MINIMUM &amp; doesn't outweigh his consistent record of ruling for corporate interests over workers #StopKavanaugh
RT @nwlc: #WednesdayWisdom: We‚Äôre hearing the word ‚Äúprecedent‚Äù a lot from Kavanaugh. Here‚Äôs why that answer is a proven fake-out. #StopKava‚Ä¶
Kavanaugh can volunteer at soup kitchens and tutor low-income students ‚Äî and still uphold the systems that keep people in poverty. These things aren't mutually exclusive. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/hKMUNDUrZb
Kavanaugh‚Äôs appeals to precedent mean absolutely nothing. He might as well be saying: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø #StopKavanaugh
Kavanaugh has been coached to issue these slippery responses about precedent because Republican leaders know that his real answers would expose just how dangerous he would be on the Supreme Court. Each time he says the word, he‚Äôs hiding something. #StopKavanaugh
The conservative justices also overturned precedent in Citizens United to give millionaires more power in our democracy. #StopKavanaugh
Just three months ago each of these judges voted to overturn a 41-year-old precedent in the Janus case, making it harder for workers to fight for good wages and better working conditions. #StopKavanaugh
After all, Justice Gorsuch also promised at his confirmation hearing that he would ‚Äúfollow the law of judicial precedent.‚Äù Roberts, Thomas, and Alito also all lauded the importance of stare decisis when testifying before the Senate. #StopKavanaugh
On the bench, Supreme Court Justices MAKE precedent. Citing ‚Äúrespect‚Äù for precedent tells us nothing about how Kavanaugh would decide cases that reach SCOTUS. And we‚Äôve seen the hypocrisy embedded in these responses before. #StopKavanaugh

Kavanaugh claims he knew nothing...yet somehow basically all of the legal community knew. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/RYYMY4pEDl
Kavanaugh himself has described the relationship between judge &amp; clerk as one only slightly less intimate than ‚Äúmarriage, parenthood, or a love affair,‚Äù yet claims he had no hint of the pattern of abusive behavior by the judge he clerked for &amp; remained close with for years after.
We need to know what Kavanaugh knew or suspected about Judge Kozinski‚Äôs harassing behavior. Kozinski‚Äôs harassment was an open secret. Did Kavanaugh do anything in response when he, as a federal judge himself, had the power to do so? #StopKavanaugh
Hiring women isn't enough. Kavanaugh‚Äôs legal record, NOT his personal relationships, is the best indicator of how he would rule as a Justice. What we know about his record shows that he is hostile to a broad spectrum of women‚Äôs constitutional and statutory rights. #StopKavanaugh

We must fight back this fall. The public comment process allows anyone to comment on proposed regulations. Make it clear to @BetsyDeVos that you support strong #TitleIX regulations that protect all students and a fair process that doesn‚Äôt give special rights to accused students.
It‚Äôs frightening that extremists are advising @BetsyDeVos on #TitleIX. This is why I‚Äôm worried about the upcoming #TitleIX regulations this Sept 2018‚Äîregulations that are likely to roll back more protections for survivors &amp; grant more special rights to alleged perpetrators. 13/14
These extremist orgs have claimed that restraining orders for domestic violence victims infringe on ‚Äúprivacy in family matters‚Äù; compared falsely accused men to rape survivors; &amp; defended former NFL player Ray Rice: ‚Äúif she hadn‚Äôt aggravated him, she wouldn‚Äôt have been hit.‚Äù12/14
It seems that @BetsyDeVos and other Trump appointees preferred to listen to extremist organizations, including hate groups and trolls, that use victim-blaming rhetoric, unsubstantiated claims about false accusations, and other misogynistic tactics. 11/14
I spent most of my last year at OCR trying to educate senior political appointees on how #TitleIX applies to sexual harassment. But since I didn‚Äôt subscribe to the false dichotomy between protecting survivors and ensuring due process, I‚Äôm not sure what impact I had, if any. 10/14
That the secretary of education does not understand how the rescinded guidance addressed the very failures she claimed were caused by the guidance is concerning. 9/14
In particular, the Obama-era #TitleIX guidance required all school officials to be adequately trained/experienced on sexual violence. And it prohibited schools from disciplining students unless they‚Äôd been given enough information to respond to the allegations against them. 8/14
@BetsyDeVos has claimed that the Obama-era guidance was responsible for several due process ‚Äúfailures‚Äù related to lack of training and notice. In reality, that guidance explicitly required OCR to enforce #TitleIX in ways consistent with federally protected due process rights.7/14
Unfortunately, this administration has promoted the fallacy that Obama-era Title IX guidance did not ensure a fair process. This false narrative is being used to justify rescinding that guidance and giving special rights, like one-sided appeal rights, to accused students. 6/14
The court‚Äôs decision, which balances both parties‚Äô interests in fair process, is supported both by civil rights and survivors‚Äô advocates and by so-called ‚Äúmen‚Äôs rights activists.‚Äù It also aligns perfectly with Obama-era #TitleIX guidance on sexual violence. 5/14
Take cross-examinations, for example. A federal court last month held that a UMichigan student had a right to question the woman who filed a #TitleIX complaint against him, but could only do so by submitting his questions to adjudicators who would ask them on his behalf. 4/14
For the record, when we advocate that schools be trauma-informed in responding to sexual violence, we are not asking the school to take away due process rights. It‚Äôs possible to advocate for both a fair process for all students and the safety of survivors of sexual violence. 3/14
Until last month, I worked at the Dept of Ed‚Äôs Office for Civil Rights (OCR). It shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that I heard a Trump appointee referring sympathetically to students accused of sexual harassment as ‚Äúvictims,‚Äù as in so-called ‚Äúvictims of an unfair process. 2/14
‚ÄúThe truth is, there is no inherent conflict between ensuring a fair process for survivors and a fair process for alleged perpetrators.‚Äù	- Former U.S. Dept of Education attorney, current NWLC attorney &amp; #TitleIX expert Shiwali Patel @wali824 1/14 https://t.co/xjIleAYocV

Work requirements also limit the set of activities that count as work in ways that discount women‚Äôs unpaid, caregiving work, which disproportionately affects their ability to remain enrolled in Medicaid under such requirements.
Women are particularly at risk of losing covg. under these types of req's. They're more likely than men to: 	‚û°Ô∏èBe sole or primary caregivers for kids 	‚û°Ô∏èBe caregivers for aging parents/other family members 	‚û°Ô∏èWork in low-wage jobs that don‚Äôt accommodate caregiving duties
The reality is that most people who qualify for Medicaid are already working if they are able to, which means that these work requirements would have little, if any, impact on how many people enrolled in Medicaid are employed. https://t.co/jXehHVYgBq
These work requirements are ILLEGAL (&amp; offensive), because they are largely based on false racial stereotypes about people who use social safety net programs‚Äìsomething we called out with 115 allies in a letter to Senators about these harmful changes. https://t.co/duz3BSxAxo

None of this is right! Tell @RIHouseofReps to reject any amendments that will weaken RI‚Äôs existing law. Instead of moving backwards, RI should join the chorus of other states choosing to protect working people from pay discrimination and pass #H7427 without damaging amendments.
They would make it so much harder for people to seek justice ‚Äì by taking away the right to go to court, or get a full remedy, and by creating a giant loophole allowing an employer who has *actually* discriminated against an employee to escape liability. #H7427
These amendments would make the state an outlier by carving out employers with 18 or fewer employees. This is something that existing RI law doesn't do, that federal equal pay law doesn't do, and that no other state equal pay law does. #H7427
RI: take action now. Before, #H7427 worked to close race and gender pay gaps. Now, #H7427 is worse for women than current law b/c it weakens penalties, opens massive loopholes, takes away victims‚Äô right to go to court, &amp; nullifies fair pay measures adopted by RI communities.

So, DC: Make sure you vote #yeson77 on June 19th, and spread the word to your friends and family. Tipped workers deserve better. They deserve #1fairwage.
Ultimately a #yeson77 is a vote to help some of the most marginalized workers in DC‚Äôs community. Not everyone has the opportunity to work in a high end restaurant with big checks ‚Äî and this law helps to other tipped workers, like nail salon workers, too.
Not only are workers speaking out in favor, but the facts back up #yeson77 and #1fairwage. In the other states that have adopted this, workers AND the restaurant industry are doing great, and poverty is lower for tipped workers. https://t.co/gBpYtmXXu9
Their intimidation is strong, but current and former workers from the industry are speaking out ‚Äî and they support #1fairwage and #yeson77. 		See here: https://t.co/vflfIvQJJn	and here: https://t.co/4ak7oIzNY0		for just two examples.
So you know all this, but you‚Äôre still seeing those daunting opposition signs all over the place, what gives? A lot of money from the rich restaurant lobby ‚Äî who don‚Äôt exactly have the best interests of restaurant workers at heart ‚Äî for starters. #Yeson77 https://t.co/EYfCzm7yL9
Data shows that restaurant workers are more likely to suffer from minimum wage violations than people working in other industries. #Yeson77 #1FairWage https://t.co/4OJG3Oitys
If you make less than the regular minimum wage after tips, your boss is supposed to make up the difference. But we know that this often does not happen. #Yeson77 #1FairWage
Tipped workers have never been given a fair shake when it comes to wages. First, they were left out of minimum wage laws completely until 1966. And   the federal tipped minimum wage of $2.13/hour hasn‚Äôt been raised in over 25 years. #Yeson77 https://t.co/WOj9VMAWSw
In fact, DC tipped workers who are women and people of color are roughly FOUR times more likely to live in poverty than other workers. #Yeson77 #1FairWage
Workers who depend on tips (and the substandard tipped minimum wage) are also on average across the country, two times more likely to live in poverty than other workers ‚Äì and in DC they fare much worse. #Yeson77 #1FairWage
The tipped minimum wage is problematic &amp; damaging, especially for women (over 50% of tipped DC workers) + PoC (almost 75% of tipped DC workers). One reason? Tipping leaves the door open for sexual harassment from customers with little recourse. #Yeson77 https://t.co/YM2sfnfVuM

In DC, women are ~50% of tipped workers in and almost 75% of tipped workers here are people of color. Both women and people of color in tipped jobs in the District face a poverty rate that is close to FOUR TIMES HIGHER than the rate for the workforce overall. #1FairWage https://t.co/9IyzKDz6qZ
Don‚Äôt get it twisted: often, a tipped worker will receive a paycheck for $0 because the legal hourly rate for these workers is a paltry $3.33 in DC ‚Äì barely enough to cover payroll taxes. Practically all take-home pay comes from tips left by customers. We need #1FairWage NOW!
Initiative 77 would ensure that restaurant servers, bartenders, hair stylists, manicurists, and all other tipped workers in DC can count on a decent paycheck from their employers, with tips on top. #BetterWagesBetterTips #1FairWage https://t.co/rMT1AkjALl
Who doesn‚Äôt want #1fairwage for tipped workers? The other NRA, who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to get out of paying workers fair wages. #BetterWagesBetterTips https://t.co/EYfCzmp9CH
FACT: employers in the District can pay their tipped employees as little as $3.33 an hour. Although they are supposed to make up the difference when there‚Äôs a slow week and a worker‚Äôs base wages and tips don‚Äôt add up to the minimum wage, that often doesn‚Äôt happen. #1FairWage
DYK: Federal law allows employers to pay people who work for tips a lower minimum wage than the rest of us. This unequal treatment dates back to slavery: after the Civil War, tipping was a way to avoid paying newly freed slaves fair wages. #1FairWage https://t.co/Ru8dWwaoCS

Instead, SCOTUS reaffirmed protections for the equality &amp; dignity of LGBTQ folks, women, people of color, people with disabilities and all others regardless of who they are or who they love. #OpenToAll https://t.co/WTTufDwSZM
Let‚Äôs be clear: today‚Äôs SCOTUS decision on Masterpiece Cakeshop did NOT give blanket permission for businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals or anyone else. #OpenToAll https://t.co/JrTNp2eZtE

Although the Court found that this particular case was moot ‚Äì it will likely arise again. ORR continues to unconstitutionally block young immigrant women from getting an abortion. #JusticeForJane
Another breaking #SCOTUS update: The Supreme Court responded to the federal government‚Äôs request to vacate an appeals court ruling that allowed an undocumented teen to get an abortion, but doesn‚Äôt punish the teen‚Äôs attorneys. #JusticeForJane
