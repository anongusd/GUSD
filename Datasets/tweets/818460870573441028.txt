Repeal and Replace, in that order! GOP voted for text of HR1436 before.It must come to a vote.I stand ready to discharge it if needed #unite
@DailyProgress not just freedom caucus - just a bill that is drafted off of collective ideas. Not tweaks at our request after the fact.
@AirSp93 check our social media the past week we have been against it from the start.Can u please try our office next week and ask 4 Andrew?
@dschleifer this plan had many flaws not presented in the better way plan. It was pulled from the floor but would have been a no vote
@indivisibleVA05 @freedomcaucus the House needs to work on passing a good bill. We will get one to POTUS and he can choose to sign or not.
@indivisibleVA05 @freedomcaucus last time we checked the President doesn't set the agenda of Congress. We will get a good bill to his desk.
@amficarra voting for bad legislation in the name of party unity will hurt the GOP far worse in the long run.
@VondaPeeples higher chance of losing the House if we support terrible legislation
I remain steadfast. The people have spoken and I agree. This plan is not the best way forward. Still a no.
@bruceholsinger don't know who said that. I have remained a no.
@CraigNews Count on it!
@sircorby still a no
@eVilleMike couldn't be further from the truth.
@eVilleMike do you even know what you are saying before you say it?
@tracesthings hand picked? Apparently you know something we don't
@tracesthings don't fret. Hopefully I'll see you on the 31st!
@tracesthings speaking of history, it was humbling winning by an all time historic margin in November!
@amberpages_g @freedomcaucus as do I. New analysis today scores this bill as even more expensive after recent additions.
@amberpages_g @freedomcaucus doubtful
@GaGal4Trump I was one of the few who stood by our President all year and continue to. But a bad bill is a bad bill. Show me a poll u trust

@tnofuentes especially as the world grows more dangerous and ISIS continues to threaten using this program as a stream for infilitration
@tnofuentes aren't these questions we should start having? Not blocking altogether, but what keeps homeland safe and encourages immigration?
@SallyLHudson @backyardconserv https://t.co/6xmsLlZxj2 I appreciate both sides of the debate but my first responsibility is ensuring HomeSec
@SallyLHudson @backyardconserv I want to avoid the "what if." I feel as if it is a matter of time and would rather enhance screenings now.
@tnofuentes but at what point should we say ok with the status quo? That works fine, until something happens.. trying to avoid the "what if"
@EvanWas8 @Reuters would like to see more details as they unfold. As a Veteran this is a particularly sensitive issue with me.
@backyardconserv @ProfessorBec always happy to engage on issues. Unfortunately the discourse this week has been far from legitimate debate.
@tnofuentes but the general concept for slowing the process temporarily and strengthening protections is something I support.
@tnofuentes when FBI and DHS officials are 100% confident in the process I will be convinced. The rollout with this had many flaws, I agree.
@stevekenning @lanalana did you read my recent opinion piece on Syria?
@tnofuentes it is a temporary pause. I have always embraced legal immigration. Ensuring the process in place is adequate is common sense.
@lanalana @brianrvincent looking forward to those as well. Details on a schedule for them are forthcoming.
@ProfessorBec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS it says that I am not afraid to support nat'l security promises made to VA5 over the past 12 months.
@brianrvincent @lanalana Thank you for calling our office. If you left your information you will be getting a reply on your concerns.
@lanalana who is disregarding them? We have official outlets to log concerns and get replies.
@desconcentrado understand that concern over harsh campaign rhetoric. However, I feel it is misleading to call this a "muslim ban"
@lanalana was never a part of that process during my tenure in the General Assembly. Issue that needs reform but I merely ran where I lived
