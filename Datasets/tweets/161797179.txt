@drlukeallen @cparsonsperez Love these points, @drlukeallen. I would add that #PrimaryHealthCare also needs to ensure that health equity is central to planning and service delivery. Otherwise, many segments of population will be missed and/or will not take up services. #Astana2018
@simoniswright Absolutely, @simoniswright. May I add, that even if/when #UHC is achieved, experience shows that it is rarely ever ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù in fact; various elements are excluded and service delivery models are not always appropriate. Advocacy needs to be etched into our DNA. #Astana2018

"Conduct unbecoming a barrister or solicitor means conduct...that tends to bring discredit upon the legal profession including, ...(c) engaging in conduct involving dishonesty or conduct which undermines the administration of justice;" #onpoli #Bill31
Are @C_Mulroney and other licensed lawyers (MPPs et al) who are immediately party to the actions of the Ontario government on #Bill31 not in serious breach of @LawSocietyLSO's "Rules of Professional Conduct"? https://t.co/yNVl0SiDKe #onpoli
To be clear, opposition to #Bill31 is NOT a partisan issue. If it were, there is no way it would have been unequivocally opposed by: over 400 lawyers and legal scholars across Canada; and, Jean Chretien, Roy McMurtry, Roy Romanow, and former Ontario PC Premier Bill Davis. #onpoli
