Dear #ATT, the last person I was transferred to was the wrong person, he promised he would transfer me to a live person - which he did not.
#ATT, the person I was just transferred to wants to transfer me back to the department that couldn't help me and just transferred me here.
Dear #ATT, took 52 min to get a simple question answered (48 min) on hold.  Multiplied across your customers, its a great GDP killer.
