@EricofOC @DineshDSouza @yaf @tamuyaf @TAMU How does government involvement in healthcare cause it to fail? That‚Äôs completely untrue. Medicare has been the biggest catalyst of the most safety and quality measures in healthcare by far. You obviously have zero understanding of what drives healthcare quality &amp; safety.
@EricofOC @DineshDSouza @yaf @tamuyaf @TAMU Also, private, for-profit business has proven it can‚Äôt be trusted to do anything for less or more efficiently. ie. Healthcare, LogCaps, Enron to name a few. To pretend it does is completely ignoring facts.

@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch This piece from the Washington Examiner states the contents of the letter were released by CNN who had it read to them and that it was after the FBI redacted it and released it up the White House. Who knows, it could have been someone with the WH who leaked it to blame Feinstein
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch Also, Feinstein‚Äôs office pointed out that Ford stated she told some friends about it and they conjectured it was probably the friends who leaked her identity. The Post has stated Feinstein‚Äôs office wasn‚Äôt their source. They broke the story.
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch Feinstein‚Äôs office said they never released the letter. My understanding was that Grassley or senate judiciary committee released the letter only after Ford herself did so, after her identity became public. The letter was released much later-after September 12th-the 16th maybe?
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch My understanding was she referred Ford to an attorney. That‚Äôs when the attorneys then tried to establish Ford‚Äôs credibility and when the polygraph was taken. These matters have to be investigated and an accuser coming forward vetted otherwise a senator and attorneys look silly.
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch I did misunderstand the timeline of when Feinstein‚Äôs office referred the letter to the FBI. I mistook what happened with Eshoo and her office‚Äôs referral to Feinstein with the referral to the FBI. My mistake. Still doesn‚Äôt change anything as the whole thing happened in 2 months.
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch Feinstein herself probably had no knowledge of it for at least a couple of weeks. senators do not have time to deal with every letter or request for contact that comes into their office. Saying she leaked the letter in early Sept. and then released it at the 11th hr. Is absurd.
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch The letter was sent to Feinstein on July 30th. To say that her office should have immediately acted on it without investigating further is to display a lack of understanding of how a senator‚Äôs office functions. She honored the request for anonymity then referred the matter to FBI
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch The letter went to Representative Eshoo first, as Ford stated under oath. Then to Feinstein. What should Feinstein have done? Pushed every unsubstantiated allegation forward? She referred it to the FBI who told her the background check was closed.
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch According to this, existence of the letter &amp; news that Ford sought attorneys came out prior to Sept. 12th. It sounded to me like Feinstein planned to just refer to FBI, who told her office the background check was closed, then move on to the vote. https://t.co/tuWOT0jpF4

@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch The first news reports on it - there was a letter from anonymous accuser &amp; Feinstein had referred to FBI. And Feinstein was bound by accuser to keep her identity anonymous. If Feinstein had come out earlier the GOP would have smeared her for releasing unsubstantiated claims.
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch Read this. This all played out in the news and during the committee hearing. Those accusing Feinstein have no evidence and no understanding of how it played out. https://t.co/C757UxIlq8
@Avenatti4POTUS Can‚Äôt wait to watch the perp walk. Don‚Äôt hit your heads getting into the police car boys.
@mkleinholzASU @senorrinhatch If Feinstein wanted the allegations out at ‚Äúthe 11th hour‚Äù why would she leak them earlier? That‚Äôs stupid and contradictory. She released them to the FBI months prior to them coming out. The Allegations against Her are based on zero evidence without a plausible rationale.

@ProudResister @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @ABAesq Another reason. https://t.co/H2hwnv9nkt
@MichaelAvenatti Why the coverup? Because he‚Äôs the Don of the #GOPCrimeSyndicate
@MichaelAvenatti Kavanaugh knee in advance who would accuse him of sexual assault. How can that be unless he‚Äôs guilty? Or committed perjury?   	https://t.co/H2hwnvqYc1
@togvrak @kylegriffin1 #KavanaughsGuilty
@kylegriffin1 Aside from witness tampering-there‚Äôs only one way Kavanaugh would know in advance who would accuse him of sexual assault because he did it. #KavanaughAccuser #KavanaughHearings #KavanaughsGuilty
@Wisc_Lisa @kylegriffin1 Which also means he knew Ramirez would accuse. But if it never happened how would he know who was going to accuse him? Sloppy drunk Kavanaugh is sloppy in more ways than one.

@JeffFlake Senator Flake, how did Kavanaugh know to contact mutual friends of Ramirez in July, two months before the story broke, yet he testified under oath he heard about allegations Sept. 24? Unless he lied or he‚Äôs guilty? https://t.co/H2hwnvqYc1

@TristanHendrix5 @IBDeditorials Perhaps you have a comprehension problem. I didn‚Äôt say the tool was ignorant because he has views that are different from mine. I said he is ignorant because he lacks a basic comprehension of facts. It‚Äôs plain to see that you‚Äôre ignorant too.
@JayCostTWS Right, because expecting that a president should fill vacancies on the Supreme Court during his or her tenure as outlined in the Constitution is tantamount to imperialism. You‚Äôre a fucking tool.

@DineshDSouza Leave it to a lying fucking scumbag like DSouza to colonize a story about liberal tolerance and the scourge of racism to point out a privileged man of power‚Äôs hysterical  stance as a victim. So entitled they even play victim when convenient and expedient.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @kanyewest Can‚Äôt wait to see you and your crime syndicate traitorous family marched away in handcuffs and locked away in a dark cell.
@kanyewest Hey West, since you seem to need help understanding this: Trump and Sessions and the GOP take millions from prison corporations and imprison millions of black men expressly to be exploited for slave labor. You‚Äôre complicit in modern day slavery if you support Trump.
@TristanHendrix5 @IBDeditorials A different view than mine? Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Donald trump have done more to imprison and exploit black men than any Democrat. Kanye is ignorant and a hypocrite by implying he is against prison slave labor and in favor of trump. And you‚Äôre ignorant too.
@IBDeditorials It didn‚Äôt take guts. It took a complete lack of comprehension of the facts. Kanye is just as ignorant as any Trump MAGAt. He proved that.
@MiaFarrow Nailed it. https://t.co/IPLPOzdCc6
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC Right. It‚Äôs never been about the truth. It‚Äôs been about the GOP crime syndicate &amp; terrorist organization doing their paymasters‚Äô biddings and ramming a black out drunk rapist through to the SCOTUS to push their retrograde taliban agenda.

@GOP @PressSec Just like the GOP crime syndicate to try to ram their square peg narrative into the round hole of reality. You criminals are shameless. Your days as a US political party are numbered.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump No, we watched an unhinged, angry, entitled maniac lie under oath and sully any pretense of impartiality the Supreme Court will have with the GOP crime syndicate politicians sitting on the bench.
@McAllisterDen Oh, man, you‚Äôre right. This must mean it‚Äôs her fault that frat Boy Bart tried to rape her. Glad you‚Äôve cleared that up.
@CowenAnthony @McAllisterDen @BrianAdams52 I guess that means it her fault that frat Boy Bart tried to rape her. You win.
@CowenAnthony @McAllisterDen @BrianAdams52 Wow, cool story. I wonder how many people Bart OKavanaugh gang raped.
@McAllisterDen Two questions, McAllister: have you boofed yet? Or done the Devil‚Äôs triangle?
@McAllisterDen The issue at hand is Bart O‚ÄôKavanaugh‚Äôs integrity, morality, and fitness to serve on the Supreme Court of the United Stares, not Dr. Ford‚Äôs chastity. You‚Äôre repugnant.
@McAllisterDen Can a human being be this ignorant and banal?
@MichaelAvenatti You know, with his epic fuck-ups and stupidity, in a way, you‚Äôre not only living in his head rent free, he‚Äôs kind of paying you to do so.
@normangoldman I wouldn‚Äôt want this guy on a PTA board let alone the Supreme Court. What a disgraceful display. He sullied the reputation of the Judiciary.
@JimCarrey It‚Äôs part of the code to be in the GOP Crime Syndicate.

@maggieNYT This was abusive and a serious transgression indicative of someone who would rape another person.

@SenBobCorker You‚Äôre a coward and a stain on the fabric of democratic civilization you partisan bought-and-paid-for shameless tool. Your GOP crime syndicate is putting the nail in the coffin of US democracy and paving the way for totalitarianism.
@SenateDems Because he‚Äôs guilty. That hearing was a farce.
@SenWhitehouse @FBI As usual. The GOP and Kavanaugh are blatant and offensive partisans.
@Amy_Siskind The history of the Supreme Court has always been tainted. This will put Trump‚Äôs mark on it.
Yes or no, Brett. FBI investigation into the allegations. Simple.
@jdawsey1 Pretty sure he asked if Dr. Ford was a political operative and whether or not she was politically motivated years ago when she discussed the attempted rape with her therapist and husband and if he regretted her coming forward. Brett didn‚Äôt answer any questions. You‚Äôre confused.
@jdawsey1 Which of his high school friends had the yearbook entry that read, ‚ÄúNo means yes. Yes means anal‚Äù? Was it Mark judge?
@DonaldJTrumpJr He‚Äôs unstable, angry, and belligerent. An embarrassment to the Supreme Court nomination process like your dopey dad is an embarrassment to the presidency.
@JohnJHarwood Same goes for child rapist priests.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I‚Äôm no biologist but it does seem weird to me that your body can move and your mouth can utter sounds while you are obviously completely lacking a brain inside your cranium.
@JoyceWhiteVance It always comes down to money for the GOP crime syndicate.
@DavidCornDC I‚Äôm fairly certain that an intelligent accomplished person with a PhD in psychology can learn to cope and overcome her fears of flying in order to do so. Anyone beyond the concrete operations stage of development would grasp this concept. The two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.
@DavidCornDC Well being able to read anything at all is apparently not a prerequisite for the office of President-as evidenced by Trump-so why would it apply to Senator?
@BillyRedacted @ThePlumLineGS That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen GOP tools running with-she says she doesn‚Äôt like flying...but she flew...we caught her lying, she can‚Äôt be trusted. As if millions of people who are afraid of flying don‚Äôt fly everyday. She‚Äôs a psychologist. It‚Äôs called coping. Like a rational adult.
@AnaKasparian Because he‚Äôs hiding out at a Delaware beach house. Nothing strange about that.
@JohnFugelsang I would feel bad for the guy if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that his place in office is imperiling the world.

@MZHemingway @SebGorka Apparently you buffoons need an explanation. The GOP is accusing the accusers of playing politics over the nomination.
