@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan Oh, man, that‚Äôs the shittiest argument to end withüòÑ, but good luck to ya üëãüèª.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan Again, opinion not the same as fact. They all plead guilty to lying. End of story.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan But you just told me Clinton and Comey lied. Without proof. Anyway, I‚Äôm done.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan Okay, got my answer. I totally disagree with you. I think it gave the Russians leverage over him. Anyway, thanks for the chat, even if we didn‚Äôt convince each other of a thing üòÑ.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan How about these: Flynn about discussing sanctions with Kislyak. Papadopoulos about being in touch with Russians. Cohen about Trump Tower Moscow. Again, why lie if it‚Äôs all so innocent?
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan Please provide the actual text. Also, you know, I‚Äôm sure, that he was indicted on *five* counts of lying to Congress, including saying that he only asked Credico to contact Assange. Even Corsi says he asked him too. So Roger lied. Question is why.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan I sure did. Please show me your proof that they lied.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan Ah, I see. True, it seemed like a long shot. But (and I think this is my last try to get you to respond): How do you feel about Trump trying to do business with Russia while running for office?
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan I have no problem with Obama (or Trump!) negotiating *politically* with Russia, because that can be a good thing. Thing is, once again - we were talking about Trump hiding a personal business interest while running for president. Are you okay with that, hostile power or not?
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan I don‚Äôt know about Bill‚Äôs speech. Reference please.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan You could ask Sarah Palin about the hostile power part.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan And, again, I wasn‚Äôt talking about indictments.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan Which indictment is that from?
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan I would like to see proof of that first.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan He wasn‚Äôt supposed to win? What does thar mean? Who says?		He should at the very least disclose his business negotiations while running. It doesn‚Äôt *matter* that he didn‚Äôt build it. He was trying to build it and needed Putin‚Äôs approval. Voters should‚Äôve known that.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan I‚Äôm right here, despite your condescension. So, are you OK with Trump keeping his business deals with a hostile power secret from voters while running for president?
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan None. We‚Äôre not talking about indictments. How do you feel about the lies?
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan I‚Äôve actually lost count on how many Trump campaign members or associates have lied about their contacts with Russia. (And, no, it‚Äôs not illegal to talk to or do business with Russians. It is, however, really weird that Trump‚Äôs people keep getting caught lying about it.)
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan Deflection. We were talking about Trump Tower Moscow.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan He was negotiating a business deal with people in the Russian government *while running for president*. That gave them huge leverage over him, especially when he decided to not tell the public. You see nothing wrong with that?
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan True. Some people get out on $250,000 bail even though they‚Äôre charged with multiple felonies while others sit in jail for years on minor charges because they‚Äôre too poor. For the ultimate whataboutism here, google Kalief Browder.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan 1) Again, I wasn‚Äôt calling it proof. 2) I did understand the sarcasm (it was still whataboutism). 3) What have I said that was fake?
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan Likewise, I‚Äôm sure üòÑ.
@TroyPallotto @nyckatyc @jonathanvswan I didn‚Äôt say I had proof üòä. I merely pointed to an article - and will happily wait for Mueller to provide evidence. If he has none, I will accept that. Meanwhile, whataboutism re Pelosi was a nice attempt at deflection.

@Sienna_Red @TIME The photos of corpses sadly can't prove when they died, only that they died. Russia's lies and actions are truly horrific.
@Sienna_Red @TIME I do understand. The deaths of 295 people are very real. Just showing their destroyed luggage is chilling.
@Sienna_Red @TIME I agree with you that the truth must be told, but this is exploitative. I don't need the photos to understand the horror.
@Sienna_Red @TIME I disagree. The families have only just learned that their loved ones are dead. They should not discover this online.
