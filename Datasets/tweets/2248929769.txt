@marcetorresg I concluded the conversation by introducing him to the concept of #mansplaining. 		Don’t call someone to ask for their advice and expertise on a topic you know nothing about and then proceed to lecture them on how they’re wrong.
@marcetorresg I answered as best as I could given the somewhat misguided questions on a complex topic. He concluded the convo by lecturing me on how he had started 8 companies and knew “numbers”. He said my numbers just didn’t make sense and that *I* just must not be understanding everything.
@marcetorresg Recently, someone called me to ask about some basics of the solar industry, since he was interested in getting involved. He was starting from zero and his questions didn’t make complete sense, but it was understandable given that he had very little context and knowledge.
@marcetorresg I have so many stories on this, we must start a blog hahhh
So many people in the sector will hate on payday loans, predatory lenders, etc, in the USA, yet champion microfinance and/or access to credit in the "developing world"-- somehow managing to ignore the similarities. Just something to think more critically about.
I've always thought that the microfinance &amp; credit sector is wrought with strange contradictions. #microfinance #credit #socent
2. "'White businessmen now recognize that the urban poor &amp; lower-income consumers can be made to pay much higher prices than affluent white suburbanites for commodities, so long as adequate lines of credit are made available to them.'”
1. "The legal documents say that a Rent-A-Center in Northern California ultimately charged, after installments, $1,379.54 for an Xbox that normally retails at $299.99, and $2,834.19 for a television that sells for $717.60."

30+ minute long lines for food @ Unidad Deportiva 	#MigrantCaravan #Tijuana
Food provided (by govt) is beans and sometimes bread— 2-3 times per day. Otherwise, migrants rely on food donations from local people, restaurants, or orgs. Those with money (rare) can go buy basic, cheap food outside— such as Cup of Noodles, tortillas, crackers.	#MigrantCaravan

"If you aren't funding these paramilitary groups, who is?" -@BretBaier, good, direct Q!		#FueraOrtegaMurillo

Nicaragua is under brutal repression by the #DanielOrtega regime. Violent attacks on pacific protesters are becoming more intense each day. The world must know the truth, and it must stand with the people of #Nicaragua		#ORTEGAKILLS #SOSNICARAGUA	@FoxNews @BretBair @SpecialReport
Why would USA have had any motivation to overthrow Ortega? He had been a figure of relative stability in Central America. 1) Helped combat drug &amp; gang activity 2) Low migration rates to USA 3) USA has plenty of money invested in Nicaragua— in zona franca, tourism, mining, etc.
My guess is he’ll push the outrageous “US-backed coup” conspiracy theory, which makes no sense and is completely unfounded.

Um, ok. #thereishope https://t.co/GQ6Mm2eJSm
#4- Take yourself seriously and the customer will, too. Professionalism, organization, and customer service in our pitch has led to "self-selection" among customers. Customers who think they can pay the system, opt in; those who don't, opt out. Obvious, but often overlooked.
#3- Tap into existing formal credit scoring practices. The unbanked already ahve a credit score; you just need to know where to look. Try the longstanding local vendor. Ask who hasn't paid their tab in a while. Yep, just like a bar. 	#Finclusion #FinancialLiteracy
#2- Credit analysits are critical for trust building. An analyst may notice small detail about a potential client, resulting in a positive assesment-- something the application may have missed. This way, we impact more people! 	#Finclusion #Unbanked
#1- "How" goes farther than "what" in a credit assesment. Pay less attention to the number value of monthly income; pay more attention to how well they know/manage household finances. In short, is the client financially literate? #FinancialLiteracy #Finclusion
.@Colibri_Global is, arguably, "providing credit in the most challenging market in the world. 66% of our clients have not had any previous formal credit or finance experience. 0% have a bank account." #finclusion #unbanked
"Our default rate is less than 2%. 65% of our customers are ahead of their payment schedules. Over 90% of customers who apply for the financing are approved."

Halfway through my #TodayInData rant w/ @Colibri_Global. #ILoveData #11days. What would you do if you freed up #11days of your life?
Still at it: #5hours/wk = 260hrs/yr. Think you spend 11 days of your year on charging your #cellphone? The avg @Colibri_Global client does.
2x/week! {45min walk + 60min charge + 45 min walk}x2 = 300 minutes = 5 hours per week spent on charging a phone! #5hours @Colibri_Global
And, lastly, the walk back home-- another #45minutes! How many times do you think the avg person does that per week? #Lastmile #cellphone
Important news. https://t.co/ZBYWx7sqcO
Hey! I forgot to mention how long #cellphone charge takes- another hour. And don't forget about the walk back! Another #45minutes. #LastMile
The avg. @Colibri_Global customer walks 45 mins ONE WAY to charge their #cellphone. #data #ILoveData #solar #telecommunications #lastmile
