Score one for LGBT equality. Fayetteville voters have ratified the city's Uniform Civil Rights Protection ordinance, 53% to 47%.
The last bag has arrived. We should have final results here shortly.
Still waiting ...
Lots of activity outside the Washington County Courthouse. The tablets with today's votes on them are starting to trickle in.
RT @NWADemGazPhotos: Early results @FORFayetteville @nwaequality http://t.co/t8T9lx6eMR
There are still thousands of ballots left to count. Last year, 14,580 people voted total.
It could be another hour or so before we get final (but unofficial results). I'm hoping for sooner!
More on early/absentee election results. Ordinance supporters take a strong lead. http://t.co/Jd4LyTqOCx
Ordinance opponents are going to have to make up a lot of ground with today's vote if this thing is going to be repealed.
In December, ordinance supporters led 56-44 after early/absentee results were in. This time it's 68-32.
Last year, 4,617 votes were cast early and absentee. So 456 fewer early/absentee votes this time around.
Early/absentee results favor ordinance supporters. With 4,161 ballots cast, 2,830 ‚Äî or 68 percent ‚Äî support the anti-discrimination law.
Polling sites are open for another 15 minutes. We're hoping to have early/absentee results shortly thereafter. Not sure yet on final numbers
With more than 4,000 early votes last week, we're approaching the 14,580 votes cast in the Dec. 9 election on a similar anti-bias ordinance.
There's been more than 10,000 ballots cast today alone, according to the WashCo election coordinator.
I'll be tweeting results from Fayetteville's special election as soon as I get them. Polls close at 7:30 p.m. tonight.

My take on last night's City Council meeting and what lies ahead for Fyville's Uniform Civil Rights Protection law. http://t.co/j8CbfMoMWK
The anti-discrimination ordinance is headed to a Sept. 8 special election. Final vote was 6-2. Schoppmeyer, La Tour opposed.
Alderman Kinion: There's going to be plenty of public debate between now and a Sept. 8 special election.
We're on the third and final reading. There could be a final vote tonight, despite objections from La Tour, Tennant and Schoppmeyer.
RT @NWADemGazPhotos: Public comment continues for the @AccessFay anti-discrimination ordinance. @NWAJoel for updates. http://t.co/nzaS1qcNDu
Josh Waters, a previous opponent, says he supports this new ordinance b/c its religious exemption is stronger.
Supporter: "This says to LGBT people: You are whole; you are human; and you are just as important as everyone else."
Opponent: Businesses shouldn't be compelled against their will to provide services to someone whose lifestyle they find objectionable.
Ordinance opponent: "Freedom of conscience is the most important freedom we have in this country."
Paul Sagan, Covenant Church pastor: Churches exempted from law on Sunday, but congregants not exempt every other day of the week.
Two transgender women have spoken so far. "I can't go to Walmart without feeling like some sort of side show attraction," Lisa Stewart said
The Dec. 9 special election, where the Civil Rights Adm ordinance was overturned, cost about $37,000, according to city clerk's office.
First opponent to speak mentions expense of a special election. "Why can't we put this on the November ballot," he asked.
All 14 of John La Tour's have officially failed. Public comment just started.
City Attorney Kit Williams on La Tour's Amendment 12: City Council can't require State Circuit Court to hear appeals of law.
Another amendment would have delayed the election until November 2016. Also died for lack of a second.
Act 137 was Sen. Bart Hester's SB202. It prohibits cities from enacting laws banning discrimination on a basis not contained in state law
One amendment would have held off on a special election until after an AG's opinion on whether the ordinance would conflict with Act 137.
None of La Tour's amendments have been seconded.
Scratch that about public comments. First we're hearing 14 proposals for amendments from Alderman John La Tour.
We're about to hear the first round of public comment. Mayor Jordan reminds everyone to "remain orderly" and "be courteous."
Alderman John La Tour: "(This ordinance) protects one group at the expense of another."
Opening comments by ordinance co-sponsor Adella Gray. Says she took concerns from opponents last time around to heart when drafting new law.
The Uniform Civil Rights Protection ordinance is being read for the first time ‚Äî 36 minutes into the City Council meeting. Here we go ...

My full story from this morning's vote on Fayetteville's new Civil Rights Administration ordinance. http://t.co/iH7KlLEUwn
Meeting adjourned. It's 3:46 a.m.
By a 6-2 vote of the Fayetteville City Council, the Civil Rights Administration ordinance has been approved.
Mayor Lioneld Jordan is making the final comments of the meeting ‚Äî strongly in favor of the Civil Rights Administration ordinance.
Aldermen Petty, Kinion, Gray have voiced support for the Civil Rights Adm. ordinance. Alderman Tennant has said he's opposed.
Fayetteville City Council mtg still going after more than 9 hours. Final member of the public just spoke. Now we'll hear from the aldermen
City Council candidates Paul Phaneuf, Michael Collins, Joshua Crawford and John LaTour have all been opposed
Several City Council candidates have spoken tonight. Aside from current aldermen, Sonia Davis Gutierrez is the only one to speak in favor
Dozens of people are still waiting to speak on Fayetteville's Civil Rights Adm ordinance.
Public comment has been limited to three minutes. Aldermen Justin Tennant, Martin Schoppmeyer and Rhonda Adams voted against the measure
The crowd outside the City Council chambers has thinned, but there are still plenty of people waiting outside.
And...We're back from break. The City Council will now take up the overall Civil Rights Adm. ordinance. Another round of public comment.
Tonight's audience has been very divided, but so far, everyone has been very civil as well.
Regardless of whether this ordinance is rejected or approved: a public vote could still be held with signatures from more than 4,000 voters
We're on a 10-minute break here at the Fayetteville City Council meeting. Discussion of amendments done. Now for the overall ordinance.
Alderman Matthew Petty: "It's not always easy being elected, but that's our job ‚Äî to make decisions."
Alderman Justin Tennant's amendment has been defeated. The Civil Rights Adm ordinance won't be referred to a vote of the people.
Alderman Matthew Petty's first two amendments approved unanimously. Now for the question of referring this issue to a public vote.
Debate on three amendments still going strong. No clear consensus on whether the Civil Rights Adm. ordinance should be referred to voters.
There's been more than a half-hour of public comment on three amendments presented. After this, we'll have input on the overall ordinance.
Alderman Justin Tennant wants to refer the Civil Rights Adm. ordinance to voters in the Nov. 4 general election.
Petty's second amendment: Ordinance shall not be construed to allow people to self-identify as a way of sneaking into bathrooms, etc.
Two amendments offered by Alderman Matthew Petty: Churches' tax-exempt areas and areas of worship exempted from Civil Rights Adm. ordinance
The line of people waiting to speak tonight is down the stairs at city hall, out the doors and along the sidewalk to the downtown square.
First, the City Council will consider purchasing 11 acres next to Gulley Park for $1.1M. Then Civil Rights Administration ordinance talk.
All eight Fayetteville aldermen and Mayor Lioneld Jordan made their way through the crowd. This meeting's about to get underway.
