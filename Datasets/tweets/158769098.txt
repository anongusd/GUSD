@IVicere Very little GOV'T welfare.  Hence the call for "War on Poverty" and AFDC (Aid For Dependent Children).
@beakinderhuman That's absurd.  Americans are charitable.  Even during the Depression, when America was MUCH poorer, women and children didn't "roam the streets and die". Some moved in with family.  Many were helped by 20,000 Mutual Aid Societies, most of which disbanded when Welfare began.
@liberalmal During the 50's, Americans were steadily lifting themselves out of poverty.  The War on Poverty sped that progress and reduced the poverty rate significantly for 7 years.  Then progress stopped. Welfare encouraged people to be dependent.
