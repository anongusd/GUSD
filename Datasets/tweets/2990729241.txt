@fricto Our members have not conditioned support for a speaker candidate on this issue.
@drewgolba If you think "waiving rules" is an acceptable part of legislative process, then there's nothing further to discuss. We disagree.
@drewgolba If you waive the rules every week, then you have no rules in practice. Following rules means not waiving them.
@drewgolba Not correct. Here are the House rules: https://t.co/NWw2tHeygN. They are waived every week. We want the speaker to follow them.
@drewgolba @LibertyBundle That story is inaccurate. House rules do not address steering committee composition. That's an internal GOP issue.
@kgorm83 From policy perspective, our members will work with anyone to defend Constitution and preserve liberty, but our focus is process.
@fricto This report is false. Our members would like to repeal Obamacare, but we have sought no such pledge from speaker candidates.
That's not correct. With respect to the speaker's role, we are asking that existing House rules be followed. https://t.co/wJ0oxBudJC
@fricto Our caucus has advocated no such thing. Media caricatures of HFC should be taken with a grain of salt.
@kgorm83 Our members have worked with Democrats in many areas: justice reform, digital privacy, Pentagon reform, trade authority, etc.
@drewgolba The House rules are literally waived every week. They are adopted by vote at the beginning of the term but are not followed.
@drewgolba Demanding that House rules be followed is not "holding the House hostage." Those rules ensure body works for all, not just a few.
@drewgolba Why ironic? This represents our mission as a caucus.
When process is respected, Rs and Ds work together for benefit of all Americans. New speaker must devolve power to preserve debate of ideas.
Constitution binds our federal government, and House rules bind our representatives in Congress. These documents help preserve liberty.
We're working to restore full and open House debate, so the best ideas‚Äîconservative, liberal, or libertarian‚Äîhave an opportunity to prevail.
