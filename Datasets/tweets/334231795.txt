MCH E.D., Senta Leff closing out. ‚ÄúWe need to act NOW.‚Äù Join MCH and @Homes4AllMN in contacting your lawmakers, because where we live impacts everything.
‚ÄúWe need to budget funding so they can build us places to live.‚Äù
‚Äú...then I had a stroke and am on disability, on a fixed income...most places in the city are out of our reach. I don‚Äôt know how a person who has worked all my life like myself has to live this kind of life now.‚Äù
‚ÄúPlaces like Alliance are deeply needed. When I became homeless in 2007...I was in the shelters and doing day labor, trying to get my own place again....‚Äù
Patrick Straw, speaking to his experience as a person experiencing homeless :
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen an increase in homeless seniors in Hennepin county...a building of 43studios for homeless seniors will fail without these tax credits.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs not a safe place to live, everything else falls apart.‚Äù
Barb Jeanetta, Dir. of Alliance Housing and resident Patrick Straw. ‚Äî
‚ÄúEverybody deserve a safe place to sleep, warm blanket to pull up, and a pillow to lay their head on. We need these tax credits. Thank you.‚Äù
‚ÄúSome projects include a unit that would house 4 homeless families...another would provide individual assistance.‚Äù
‚ÄúWithout tax assistance, these housing projects just don‚Äôt work. They don‚Äôt.‚Äù
Mayor Marv Calvin of Wilmar has the stand.
‚ÄúWe cannot overstate the importance of these tax-exempt bonds and low-income housing tax credits.‚Äù
Next up, Jolene Foss, Economic and Community Development Consultant, City of Princeton
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get something that‚Äôs good for everybody, not just good for a few.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get at our representatives...ask why they would vote on this.‚Äù
(This building is 66 West)
‚ÄúWe have a multi-unit building in Edina for youth 18-23...with full support from our greater community. We want to replicate that.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis would cut affordable housing by 50% over the next few years. We cannot do that.‚Äù
Now, Mayor of Edina, Jim Hovland.
‚ÄúIf were the greatest nation in the world, we need to start acting like it.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs personal when we elect people that say ‚Äòno‚Äô to us moving forward... one unit would house 16 individuals with long term mental illness.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn North Branch, we will loose 2 housing projects, one with 48 units...it‚Äôs personal.‚Äù
Next, Mayor of North Branch, Kirsten Hagen-Kennedy
‚ÄúDeficit-funded tax cuts will only add to our future deficit‚Äù
‚ÄúPrimarily homeowners of color would also not be served.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about 4000 homeowners that will not be able to get down payment assistance‚Äù
‚ÄúWe were stunned when the US House released their tax reform bill to find that this one piece we use to do affordable housing was gone.‚Äù
Next up, Housing Commissioner Mary Tingerthal.
‚ÄúI met my wife here!‚Äù Justyn Hardwick, resident of Common Bonds.
Edit: Justyn Hardwick, full name of current speaker.
‚ÄúWhen cuts are made...come down to the hill and look at the little guys...Look at the kids living in back of cars, you seen them?‚Äù
‚ÄúThis base of operations gives me another chance at life, to stand up back on my feet, and do what I was supposed to do in this world.‚Äù

We need a bonding bill that makes strong housing investments for all Minnesotans. @GovMarkDayton @kdaudt @paulgazelka #MCHConf
2018 is another opportunity for MN to make strong investments in affordable housing. It's a bonding year! #MCHConf
Because where we living impacts everything. #MCHConf
Your voices encouraged lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to make affordable housing a basic infrastructure investment. #MCHConf
In less than 5 years, MN has invested in $270 million in affordable housing through our state's bonding bills. #MCHConf
Bc of your advocacy, MN has made targeted, strategic investments into affordable housing, with support from both parties. #MCHConf
We can end this. The solutions are already here...and they require adequate investments. #MCHConf
Homelessness hasn't always been here. And it doesn't have to stay. #MCHConf

You told me the stories about your neighbors finding heated dog houses or empty rural hospital beds to sleep in. #MCHConf
"It was all of you who taught me what homelessness looks like in rural communities." #MCHConf @SentaLeff
Our coalition knows that just bc you live 100 or 200 miles away from an emergency shelter doesn't mean your community doesn't need one.
People in this room know this is not just a metro issue. That's one of the reasons we are hosting the #MCHConf in Greater MN every yr.
That was last October. But it's also this Morning. And tonight, and tomorrow morning. And that's just Hennepin county. #MCHConf
130 men would share 2 toilets, 3 showers, and 3 sinks that next morning. Most of them had a job they need to get up and go to. #MCHConf
I learned that a few hours later 130 men would arrive to take their bunk and try to get one of the 80 available blankets. #MCHConf
I remember learning that by noon that day all the emergency shelter beds in the entire county had already been claimed for the night.
I recall standing in an emergency shelter that day staring at 130 steel bunk beds. #MCHConf
