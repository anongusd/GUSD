@ajcarrington5 @realDonaldTrump His cult followers can't be swayed.  The real question is:  What do we do with them after Trump's administration collapses?
@Stonekettle Fuck this wishy washy self-serving loser.  He had 4 years to show who he was with Trump.  No article is going to change the fact that he tried to get a job in Trump's administration.
@CNNPolitics Yeah, because he spent 4 years being all wishy washy about it

@JamesAGagliano Missed a part:  EARN the respect of the rough and tough enlisted folks who have FAR more field experience than you do.  Only when a senior enlisted gives you a nod, have you made it.
@ajcarrington5 @realDonaldTrump Good question: does Trump taking money out of their pocket matter more than racism?
@realDonaldTrump "No money has, in fact, been brought home, and the tax cut has probably reduced national income. Indeed, at least 90 percent of Americans will end up poorer thanks to that cut."  https://t.co/OeRKkdz2v8
@thehill Imagine how those kids in cages feel.
If we have to live with this deranged, vile, racist, ignorant MF in the White House, I don't want to hear one fucking person ask if a female candidate or any person of color is "likable" enough to be President.  #SickOfDoubleStandards

@realDonaldTrump 1) This trade deal isn't signed as actual legislation 2) Your wall is nothing but a monument to white supremacy 3) Middle class tax payers need money for education, healthcare, uplifting the poor &amp; taking care of the elderly &amp; the homeless, etc.&gt;&gt;&gt; In summary FUCK YOU &amp; your wall
"The FBI reported larger numbers in 2015, and then again in 2016 and a 17 percent jump in 2017. And while the numbers for this year aren't out yet, in many ways, it felt like a very violent year.  Acts of domestic terrorism fueled by white supremacy has grown."

@TheTHBandit @oftheoceanborn @BravenakBlog @Corbinburnsin Accepting personal accountability and the fact that you have benefited from the oppression of others is hard for humans to accept.  I'll keep pushing.  Reality:  Racism is a white people problem and white people have to kill it off.
It is time for the peasant uprising?  "the tax cut isn’t paying for itself. The cost of these hikes or cuts will be much less concentrated on the top 10 percent than the benefit of the original tax cut. So the vast majority of Americans will be worse off" https://t.co/J0mlknxTE3

@realDonaldTrump All I want for Christmas is a mentally stable, wise, compassionate and intelligent President who surrounds her/himself with similar people who put our nation above their own self-interests.

@2020fight @donna_gardner Believing in Trump is marginal, amiright, @GOP?
@soledadobrien You know what's marginal?  People who believe in Trump.
@JacobAWohl Go back to your basement cave dwelling, incel.
May you have peace and contentment.  And a day without Fox News soundbites from your Trump supporting relatives.
@h8Wankmaggot45 Leave them on.

@realDonaldTrump @GOP 	Go get your boy and take him out for some solid mental health care, please and thank you. 	 --Millions of sane Americans
@realDonaldTrump You haven't spent the money you already took from taxpayers.  To paraphrase General Mattis: Go fucking pound sand, you daft traitor.
@realDonaldTrump There is no "shutdown" money, you idiot.  You are  trying to steal taxpayers $$$$ to pay for something 62+% of Americans know is a waste.  Put your little pointy-hooded robe on your empty head, imbecile.
@realDonaldTrump Merry Christmas to the biggest lying little bitch I know.  😂🤡
@realDonaldTrump Hardly alone...what with all those @GOP immoral and ridiculous sycophants surrounding you.
@realDonaldTrump It's a #TrumpShutdown  with @GOP enablers.  YOU DID THIS.  We all heard you gleefully take credit for doing it before it happened.  YOU are costing the country, not the Dems and we all know it.  Every time you tweet this bullshit, more of your base disappears.  Keep it up, clown.
@realDonaldTrump Look at this dumb ass cheering on a brutal regime that murdered a reporter who was a legal resident of our nation.  Saudi Arabia practices Wahhabism, which is another radical form of governing like ISIS, and here he is cheering them on.
@realDonaldTrump This idiot thinks he's smarter than bankers and investment houses when it come to Wall Street.  Pathetic. He can't even tweet with wildly random capitalizations.  The #Trumpshutdown and all of the criminal investigations as well as his ranting tweets might be part of the problem?

@cnnbrk Trump is a dictator and McConnell is his enabler
@Acosta @pecriel Yesterday, a war-seasoned Marine General told Trump to go fucking pound sand.  The @GOP and the nation should tell this wanna-be dictator the same.

@realDonaldTrump #TrumpShutdown   62% of Americans think this wall is ridiculous
@realDonaldTrump Border security is about modern technology.  Your 1st century solution is as outdated as your coal policies.  What a farce.  62% of Americans disagree with you and the @GOP on this wall.  You are stealing money from us to pay for it and we all know it.
@thehill Stephen Miller is such a hysterical little limp dick, besides being a vile racist.

@marcorubio Hope is as valuable of a national defense strategy as "thoughts and prayers."  The @GOP better get your shits together and help the Dems save our nation.
@marcorubio Trump's traitorous actions were too much for him.  That's not a retirement.  That's a resignation based on differences of value, strategy and tactics.  It's a vote of NO CONFIDENCE in this tinpot dictator wanna be national sell out people call "president"

@MSNBC So, Trump isn't a deal maker.  He's just a bully throwing a fit.  Border security isn't the issue.  Dems have said they support that.  A wall is a waste of money though.
@realDonaldTrump Awwwwww, yes.  2005!  The gold ol' days when you were just a D list reality tv show host who failed at everything you did until you started laundering money for Russian mobsters.  Low rate tabloid talent.  *YAWN*

@TomSteyer For generations, companies have reaped the profits while we've paid subsidies in our tax dollars to them.  Time for the corporations to take responsibility for their actions.
@TomSteyer How about the companies pay damn taxes and fees for their damage to the environment. The government should cap their CEO pay and skim a % of their income to pay for clean up and offsets. In this report, 100 are tagged as creating 70% of the damage.  https://t.co/rVwfqOK4aT

Honestly, at this point the entire @GOP seems to want a dictatorship, as long as they can cheat and steal their way into power.  They cannot recover from this and it's only going to get worse when the truth about Trump's crimes come out.
@realDonaldTrump These are the unhinged ravings of a lunatic criminal cornered like the rat he is.
@realDonaldTrump You are a very sick human being.  It's mind-boggling that someone who behaves in this infantile and ignorant manner is the President of our nation.
@realDonaldTrump Huh.  Maybe not putting a criminal family in the white house that colludes with Russia could prevent that?
@realDonaldTrump Watching your tweets come out this morning is like watching a rat scurry around on a sinking ship.  Also: Veterans haven't forgotten you mocked POWS, shamed Vets with PTSD and bullied Gold Star families while letting your golf pals interfere with the VA.  So fuck you, traitor.
@realDonaldTrump Nothing about remembering Pearl Harbor?  Of course not.  You don't give a shit about military and veterans or their families.
@realDonaldTrump Once again, you ignore the men and women who serve and sacrifice for this country.  You shit tweet about yourself only without a word of remembrance for Pearl Harbor and the lives lost that day.
@EvilBobJ I have zero sympathy for these Trump enablers.  Good riddance.  Just another example of a Veteran gone wrong, like Flynn. Shame on them.
@TeaPainUSA By Trump's own words, his ONLY problem with Sessions was all about Session's recusal from the Russia investigation.

@KittenMcKays It is required if one pursues a career as a Vet.  But it can be more than four years (which is how US awards bachelor degrees)  Makes it more like Medical school.
@KittenMcKays There are still boards and licensing to pass in the US to act as an actual Veterinary doctor.   This means this person graduated from a Vet medicine program with a bachelor degree.

@JacksonvilleTom @sisrum @MrDane1982 In all fairness, I bet Trump only knows 1 out of 3.  😂
@davidmweissman Well, I mean at SOME POINT we all have to ask: can I stay connected with people who are standing by watching awful racist things happen?  Or do I need to let them go to connect to people who are going to stop awful racist things from happening?
@marcorubio Why not help defend our nation and our constitution against a president who shits on both every day, then?  Do YOUR part, too.

@67jewelCDH yes	all of those
@realDonaldTrump The biggest con we are paying for is YOU and your group of grifters in the White House who did one thing: give yourselves a tax break that saddled the rest of the nation in TRILLIONS of debt.
@realDonaldTrump Says the guy who mocked POWs, bullied Gold Star families, shamed Vets with PTSD, failed to honor the nation's war dead on Veteran's Day, tried to kick 6M Vets off of Medicare, dodged war service 5 times and sent soldiers to the border as a political stunt.  So yeah...FUCK YOU.
@realDonaldTrump You make a farce of everything.  Anti-Midas:  everything you touch becomes shit.
@RedTRaccoon So he hasn't answered them, right?  If I took a test and never turned it in, did I actually take the test? If I paid a parking ticket and didn't send it in, did I pay it?
@heskey_ken @Barbarita101950 @jay_hernandez @realDonaldTrump Funny thing about this:  Innocent men would WANT a full investigation with the hope that the FBI would clear their name in public.  Why would you trash the very people who could defend your innocence?
@heskey_ken @jay_hernandez @realDonaldTrump Yes indeed and LOOK what a scared little bitch @realDonaldTrump is right now.  😂
@realDonaldTrump "Which criminal in Trump's circle are we hunting today?"  Funny thing about @FBI :  they need evidence to get indictments and MAN, have they gotten a LOT on your people! Plus, all those guilty pleas, too.  Hmmmmmm.
I, for one, cannot wait to see what's making Trumpy so grumpy on the FBI front.
@eScarry This makes it worse.  We knew what you meant.  Stop gaslighting.
I only have so much time in the day and making tough decisions can be hard.  Should I commit voter fraud OR should I buy 1,362 boxes of cereal?

@NancyPelosi Good.  Add Medicare for all, taxing the rich and sickly profitable corporations  and send these bills to the Senate and PROVE to the people that the GOP does NOT give a damn about them.
@StormyDaniels How is that not sexual assault?
@davidmweissman The raptor isn't Melania is it?
@thehill @VP No.  No they haven't.
@SenatorCollins Awesome!  Did you also call Mitch McConnell to tell him he needs to support protecting the Special Counsel?
@eric3233 @realDonaldTrump nearly 2019 and still can't edit a tweet.  Crazy, right? 🙄
@realDonaldTrump Your insane rantings are exhausting to our nation.  Resign.  We all know this is no witch hunt.  There have been too many indictments, convictions and guilty pleas.  Only your tiny group of supporters believes you.  The rest of us know better.
@mitojorge @kanumankalwa @krassenstein @BetoORourke @RepBetoORourke @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris  can stomp on those orange toes easily.
@krassenstein Really.  @SenWarren and @SenKamalaHarris  and @SenDuckworth are more qualified for President.  He might make a fine Speaker of the House or Vice President someday, but there are more qualified candidates for the job than he.
@SenatorCollins @RedSox @PortlandSeaDogs Ok, that's nice and all but what about protecting the Special Counsel and our democracy?
@waltshaub We don't have to look far for the reasons Sessions was fired. Trump said it over and over again:  because Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation.  SO...if that was the guidance given to Session by DOJ attorneys, then why can't he sue for wrongful termination?
@realDonaldTrump Smoke and mirrors of the backend that does NOTHING to address racial injustice, mass incarcerations and the profit-based prison system.
@realDonaldTrump Specifically, what results?  The economic trends are about 8 years old.  What have YOU and the @GOP done besides give tax breaks to the rich, increase the deficit to a record 12 year high and watch corporate profits skyrocket while wages are stagnant?
@realDonaldTrump Let's stop calling it the "Mueller Investigation."  It's the PEOPLE'S investigation or the FBI investigation of criminal activity of Trump, his advisors and key members of the @GOP.
@OMGno2trump @Bonnievee2017 How deep in treason is the GOP with cash from Russian mob money?

@SpeakerRyan Gross
@bubbagump324 This is the best thing to EVER happen in America in a long, long time.
@TopRopeTravis I was done when he announced an interest.
@CNNPolitics More smoke &amp; mirrors. It does nothing to address racial injustices nor does it address mass incarceration driven by profit based prison systems.  It doesn't enhance drug addicts access to rehabilitation programs. It's designed to send MORE tax payer money to prison profiteers.
@VP @senatemajldr @GOPLeader @SteveScalise @RepLizCheney @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @POTUS No.  No you won't.  American's went to the polls to prove to you that your crazed white nationalist, racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic agenda is unacceptable and has no place in America's future. #GetBackUnderTheRocks
@joefaz Like I got time to stand in line more than once.
@realDonaldTrump @FEMA_Brock @SecretaryZinke @fema Utterly meaningless since you berated, blamed and threatened to withhold funds from Americans dying and suffering in California. You are an utter disgrace to this nation and to the office you sit in.  You should resign. You're too unstable, incompetent and unskilled for this job.
@MaxBoot What a fucking child.
@JesseRodriguez I hate Kelly but I'd pick Melania leaving over him.

@britin17k @debiowens #UASF Vet here.  Thanks for speaking up for me, too.  He has no excuses.
@BrucePoliquin Ranked choice was rule of law when you decided to run.  It's too late to change the rules now that you realized you might not win.  Too bad, so sad but you could have opted OUT of running at all.
@candacekaru @RepPoliquin Yeah, exactly.  It was the law when he made his decision to run.  Now he's crying like a baby when he knows it's unlikely he'll win.
Maine  voted TWICE for ranking choice so we have candidates that a majority of us can agree on. People who win w/ranked choice will have to work bipartisan since they'll realize party loyalty alone won't win. Suck it up, buttercup. The will of the people prevails.  #GOPvoterfraud https://t.co/NuProu69lT
@PressHerald @RepPoliquin Maine voted TWICE for ranking voting to ensure we have candidates that a majority of us can agree on. This will mean those people who win w/ranked voting will have to work bipartisan since they'll realize party loyalty alone won't get you victory. Suck it up, buttercup.
@CIAnderson3 Heartless selfish imbecile
@BrucePoliquin Maine voted TWICE for ranking voting to ensure we have candidates that a majority of us can agree on. This will mean those people who win w/ranked voting ware MORE likely to work bipartisan since they'll realize party loyalty alone won't get you victory. Suck it up buttercup.
@jaketapper Good.  They deserve it.
@realDonaldTrump You know who flies helicopters in the rain?  Military pilots and rescue workers.  But you wouldn't know that because you only think of yourself.
@DearAuntCrabby @pecriel Once gain, proof that our country fails on mental health care.
@RanttMedia @pecriel I'm a Veteran and it is so sad to me that Vets support this imbecile 2 to 1.  Vets do tend to be older white men, so there's that, but STILL.  Admit you made a mistake and join the rest of us in stepping up to challenge this guy.

@realDonaldTrump You should have done this last week, loser.  People are DYING because of your indifference and the incompetence of your administration.  You are a heartless imbecile.
@Top_Sergeant I didn't notice either
@RedTRaccoon And military history and all history.

@thehill @cheetofacts If your political party's leaders are racist, sexist, and bigots and you identify with that party  then you just might be a racist, sexist, or bigot.
@realDonaldTrump The prospect of a criminal president being held accountable for his crimes is causing the Stock Market big headaches!
@realDonaldTrump Hi, I just want to remind everyone that this lame duck idiot, who likes to take credit for jobs and unemployment, has only been riding an 8 year trend.  Here's the government data that proves it.  https://t.co/MPdgezFSa9

@realDonaldTrump Too bad you did that.  RETURNED, I mean.
@realDonaldTrump You mean your one meeting with Putin?
Just a reminder that the ONLY reason @realDonaldTrump has ever given for firing Sessions is because Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation.  The ONLY reason.
@BlaineWHardaway Congratulations!!  So exciting...!!!!
@DavidCornDC @ZacharyPBeasley No, I ain't swallowing that back down.  Full on spewfest
@JohnLav22959059 @StormyDaniels Shouldn't YOU?
@WhiteHouse @VP Bullshit.  @realDonaldTrump is telling the VA to cut their budget to make Veterans pay for the @GOP tax scam.  Stop your lies.
@votevets And now he's cutting the VA budget to make Veterans pay for the @GOP Tax Scam.  How do we stop this?  https://t.co/ahMmr4VXHP
@realDonaldTrump Hey, asshole.  Now you plan to cut money from the VA to make Veterans pay for the @GOP Tax Scam?  Hell no.  Screw YOU! https://t.co/ahMmr4VXHP
@Paulaminger1 @realDonaldTrump @votevets You mean like this kind of budget cutting goodness?  Right.  https://t.co/ahMmr4VXHP
@seungminkim @MsActiviss Is Putin close by?  He attracts the GOP like flies to shit
@Paulaminger1 @realDonaldTrump @votevets I am a Veteran and not prone to fighting with the spouses of Veterans, but since you seem so informed,  you tell ME WHAT the guys in the back room accomplished or stay out of it.
@freedom_moates So do racists, white supremacists and basement dwelling misogynist incels.
@realDonaldTrump ...Says the dimwit TV addict with no understanding of complex issues who worries about his hair more than he worries about American Citizens.
@realDonaldTrump No. You dodged war service 5 times, mocked POWs, shamed Vets with PTSD, bullied Gold Start families, blocked @votevets from your twitter feed, &amp; use the military &amp; Veterans for political points and traded golf course memberships for "backroom" running of the VA. So fuck you.
@MaxBoot Thank you for this.
Trump is a coward with nothing but disrespect for the military and it's Veterans. https://t.co/NPlXyVTZEv
@waltshaub He's heartless scum.  You have every right to be outraged and to express that.  Also:  Hey, @realDonaldTrump, this is how a real man owns up to his mistakes and apologizes, you heartless fuck.
@jaketapper Disgusting.
@BBCWorld Imagine a so called billionaire who needs American taxpayer money to fly to Paris to hole up in a hotel while the rest of the world leaders come together to pay honor to lives lost in war.  I want a fucking refund.

@ConanOBrien @Martinjx1 Dude.  I'm dead now.
As a Veteran, I want to thank the American people for making my service possible. Your tax money kept me warm, fed me, paid for my college, my medical care, the weapons that kept me safe &amp;  gave me the opportunity to travel &amp; meet the most amazing people in the world. Thank YOU!
@SanityJ68 @realDonaldTrump Now this is TRUTH.
@StormyDaniels @tazarae20 Incels don't know ANYTHING about breasts, real or augmented.  😂
@LoveMyLordGod @thehill Well, NOW we are on the same page!  Thank you for validating what I said earlier:  the #1 cause of being rich is coming from a family that already is rich.  Your quote is PERFECT!  😂
@realDonaldTrump An angry pigeon would make a better President
@realDonaldTrump Too. Fucking. Late.  Screw you.  We all know your handlers made you write this tweet,  Your heart is as empty as a punch bowl at a middle school dance.
@realDonaldTrump Shut your disgusting, traitorous, cowardly mouth.
@LoveMyLordGod @thehill 😂  Why are  you "scrimping &amp; saving then, genius?  😂
@LoveMyLordGod @thehill So you work hard because you don't have the brains to be rich?  You said brains create wealth.  😂  And as a Veteran, I can assure you that freedom is not free, jack ass.

@LoveMyLordGod @thehill How very Christian of you to say this!  😂😂  If facts matter to you, which I am sure they do not, the number 1 cause of wealth in the USA is coming from wealth, not brains or hard work. 60% of working middle class Americans struggle with their bills.  But maybe you are rich?😂
@thehill I would rather an American scrapping by like the rest of us go to Congress than even more millionaires than are already there.  They know NOTHING of the real struggles the rest of us call daily life.
@realDonaldTrump 9 Americans dead (so far) and thousands left homeless and THIS is what the leader of our nation babbles about? Threatening people in the midst of a national disaster?
@realDonaldTrump If only this fuckstick could understand science.

@Lawrence He knows they will believe anything their cult leader says and follow him blindly

@CNNPR @abbydphillip @realDonaldTrump Send 20 more like her and @Acosta.  American heroes.
@ProudResister @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Acting like an angry little cornered rodent when faced with your criminal life being exposed is NOT the same thing as having depression. Fuck him.  He made his bed.

@azed1955 😂  the image.... LOL!  I'm willing to do it for the fun but I'll also do it for my country.
@realDonaldTrump Run away to Paris, you sad little cowardly man-baby.  We all know you can't stand to be here because our military and veterans gave you the smack down when you tried to hijack Veteran's Day for your little-dick parade.  #VeteransResistSquadron  #5TimeWarServiceDodger

@MarkHertling @sirDukeDevin Let's just call it Post Traumatic Stress.  It is NOT a disorder.  It's a sign of humanity.
@RudyGiuliani Here you are, cheering on votes NOT being counted in US lessons.  How much of that Russian money did you launder and then get to keep?  Traitor.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump For every journalist they try to kick out, 20 should replace them.
@AltUSPressSec He has no business in the DOJ
@Ocasio2018 YOU know the struggles of every day folks.  The millionaires in Congress do not.
@CheriJacobus @WrenSoar No.  He needs to go away and NOT be the AG or any other position in the DOJ
@jwheels74 @UTtanyaTU This fucker is insane
@realDonaldTrump Look.  It's trying to communicate.
@realDonaldTrump The only election fraud that's happening is the @GOP gerrymandering, suppression and down right sabotage.

@SenatorCollins Take action and stop wringing your hands.
@Milbank @Stonekettle @Acosta Are you kidding?  That's what Trump wants.  Send 20 more for every one that gets ousted.  Ignoring fascism is NOT the way to end it.
@Acosta Nevertheless, he persisted.  Fight fascism every day.
@ellievan65 @diannesopinion Wow.  These Russian GOPers really don't know what to spend their money on, they are so flooded with cash.
@RedTRaccoon @MsActiviss They should send 20 more
@CNN  Send 20 more like @Acosta
@JeffFlake NO.  He's a vile racist homophobe.
@Yamiche Millions of us are with you.  You are my hero.  Keep being YOU.
@Acosta You, sir, are an American Hero.  Sue their asses.
@realDonaldTrump Threatening the people who control and entire legislative body of the US?  LOL....Dictator say what?
@realDonaldTrump "You're a very rude person. The way you treat the Dems is horrible and the way you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn't treat people that way.  You aren't -- you aren't the best.  When you report fake news -- which YOU do a lot -- you are the enemy of the people."
@GOVTWINE @cheetofacts Is this for real:  He is saying other people treat people horribly?
Trump's only and regular complaint about Sessions what about the Russia investigation recusal.  So now what?  Trump will look for someone who WILL interfere on his behalf now that Sessions is gone?
@2Newfs Hard to be surrounded by such awful hate when YOU dedicate so much time and attention to the most vulnerable in society.  We have a challenge now to not let this move or shake us from our roots of compassion &amp; generosity.  Come visit.  A walk on the beach with the dogs is good!
@funder good
@CREWcrew Good.  Off to prison with you, criminal.  Hope your dad joins, too
The bar was so low and we still fucked it all up.  Shame on America. https://t.co/f5ggE7hc0I
I am ashamed of our nation.  Trump's racist and divisive rhetoric will only get worse and the Nazi's and White Supremacists will become more emboldened while the GOP enables all of it.
@realDonaldTrump Liar and a traitor.  You only loyalty is to yourself and your bank account.
Klansmen are voting today.	Neo-Nazis are voting today.	Evangelicals are voting today.	Racists are voting today.	Misogynists are voting today.	Transphobes are voting today.	Homophobes are voting today.	Nationalists are voting today.	Trumpsters are voting today.	Are you?
@2Newfs That's awful.  Stay strong!  And fuck those assholes.
At this point, if you still support Trump you either are a racist or you are ok with racism, which also makes you a racist.
If Dems win, get ready for Trump's lie, hate and blame.  If GOP holds, Trump will take all credit, gloat and still lie.  So....same shithole President either way.
@WalshFreedom Well, the rest of the country DOES have a say in this when Ted Cruz would be a vote to take away social security, medicare and medicaid for ALL of us. US politics are national concern for all of us. I donated and I live in Maine.

@MiraSorvino The desperate racist, tyrant, con man, tax evader has gone full out KKKommander in Chief.
This is all the desperate man has.  Full on KKKOmmander in Chief of the lowest forms of life in our nation.  Racist hate baiting at the same time he says HE can't be responsible  for murderous actions of specific individuals, he blames ALL Democrats for the actions of this man. https://t.co/mDPOaGYFlG
@realDonaldTrump Another racist ad from the KKKommander in Chief.  He &amp; @GOP WILL take away your healthcare, social security, medicare &amp; medicaid to make themselves richer on the taxpayer's back.  You have NO EXTRA money in your pocket when the @GOP is in charge.
@bryanbehar @tedcruz is the same age as Satan.  Coincidence?  I think not.
@ScooterTrash10 @panb_mn @ShadiqUnique @realDonaldTrump This is what service for the good of the nation looks like.
@Acosta At a KKKlan rally, you mean.

@MrBill8989 @JanzforCongress Lizards.... or earthworms?  Yes.  Barely evolved.  But then we insult the lizards and earth worms?
@ScottFrazier19 Check first: are they unarmed, exhausted and impoverished?  IF yes &gt;&gt;&gt; are they brown?  &gt;&gt;&gt; then call the white house

@realDonaldTrump @KevinYoder You only care about Veterans and the Military when you can trot us around for political purposes. Go fuck yourself, war service dodging coward! You shamed Vets with PTSD, mocked POWs, bullied Gold Start family and let your friends wreck the VA in exchange for golf memberships.

@JacobAWohl Idiot.
@FoxNews @PressSec Lies.
@realDonaldTrump I want to remind all of you that the Trump led @GOP wants to take away protections for medical pre-conditions, rob you of social security, medicare and medicaid.  They do not care about you.  They care only for their own pockets &amp;power.  They are also a bunch of vile racists.
@realDonaldTrump More lies from a scheming and scamming fraudster con man.  https://t.co/obCcfiirk4

@ellievan65 @GretaResister Self-appointed militia is code for fucking racist cowards.

@peterdaou More bullshit from the Terrified Toddler running this country.  He is in a MAGAt frenzy, doing anything to rally his cult.
@BostonGlobe @old_osc That's not how the Constitution works
@realDonaldTrump Lie, distract, deflect and incite hate.  It's all this sub-humanTrump  knows. https://t.co/j9Pk4uFkYH
@MrBill8989 I think it's worse than that.  I think he is using the words "invasion" for a specific reason and sending troops in the HOPES that something bad will happen (shots fired) so he can declare martial law for national security reasons and suspend the constitution.
These are the questions I want reporters pressing them on and asking about because Trump is using the word "invasion" for a very specific reason https://t.co/uA1exI3B7Y
@LanceTane @cvaaustin @teetoatee @leeceedee @JohnJHarwood well, by current law, those refugees are allowed entry to apply for asylum yet here we are because Trump doesn't like that law
@cnni @CillizzaCNN Because they define "fake news" as anything they perceive as unflattering to Trump and his administration.
@realDonaldTrump For the people sick of the fake news, I have 2 ideas for you:  	1) Turn off FOX news,	2) Stop listening to Trump, the pathological liar.
@realDonaldTrump Hey, you lying fuckstick.  I want to remind you that YOU LOST the popular vote by nearly 3 million.  The only fake news outlet we are angry about is YOU and your administration.
I don't care about his fucking umbrella.  I care that he wants to deploy the US military to "stop" impoverished refugees from entering the country legally to see asylum and that he and his cult are HOPING there is bloodshed.  I care about his racism and his lies.
@thehill Well....duh.  Who didn't know this already.  Him trying to muster up a mob lynching of 5 young INNOCENT black men cleared of all guilt wasn't a definitive clue?
@thehill Finally.  One of the @GOP Neo-Nazi White Supremacists admits it.
@MSNBC It is disgusting that out tax money if being used for these trips in which he incites hate and further divides our country.
@rthomas1 @stevenportnoy @PressSec Yes, his master plan, per Putin, I bet
@realDonaldTrump YOU are the enemy of the people and your enablers in the GOP are, too.
@Stop_Trump20 Why did that person stop him from leaving???  JUST LET HIM GO.  Then everyone run and hide.
@Weinsteinlaw @Twinklebelle_Ca When 20 kids between 6-7 years old died and politicians did NOTHING, it was that moment that I understood our country had no soul.
@thehill This from a guy who wanted to murder five innocent young black men, even after they were cleared of all wrongdoing.
@realDonaldTrump There is no "fake news."  Only the insane wild ramblings of a serial con-man and pathological liar who hates anyone who tells the harsh truth about his incompetence and corruption.
@realDonaldTrump Wow.
@realDonaldTrump Racist lies.
@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL You are a thief and a liar and in charge of poorly run businesses and charities.  You are also a serial cheater, a racist, a sexual predator and a con man.  So, you know.... YOU are not one to be setting any kind of moral standards.
He's right https://t.co/KrBzXWZRsV
@thehill I swear to god, if the Dems can't get their shit together and out message a bunch of fear mongering racist liars, I lose ALL hope.
@Lawrence @eclecticbrotha Fat chance of that.  They, mentally ill conspiracy theorists and hypocritical "Christians" are all he has.
@StephenKing "It was, like, amazing."  &gt;&gt;&gt; chills of horror down my spine
@JamesKosur I hope that kid does not follow in his Dad's footsteps and as he matures, calls his dad out for being a vile, heartless racist.
@Brasilmagic No.
@ProudResister That KY man isn't some innocent clueless person.  He knew what he was doing.
@ADIC33 I know the feeling.  You are not alone.
@RedTRaccoon Trump wants a bloodbath because his overlord Putin WANTS the US Military to shoot at unarmed, exhausted and impoverished men, women and children for trying to cross the border.
@SoulStealer25 Why bother responding at all.  Not worth your precious time.
@Amy_Siskind White nationalist
@Tennesseine @fuzhi_lin They may as well just laugh.  It's pretty obvious they do not care.
@pacelattin The guy is a white supremacist
@realDonaldTrump Nope.  It's you and the @GOP who have full on embraced white supremacists and neo-Nazis who you called "some very fine people."  You can fool your cultists but not the rest of the nation.  We know better.  The nation is rotting from the top down.  #VeteransAgainstTrump https://t.co/YOC1NHbKKJ
@realDonaldTrump A nation in crisis and this fuckstick tweets this drivel.
Trump is destroying our nation and the only way to take it back is to vote for Democrats on Nov. 6th. https://t.co/zQR8jqSghB
Do you remember a time when crazed conspiracy theorists and vile racists had no public forum beyond their own little towns where people could confront them in person or choose to laugh at or ignore them?  I remember.  Now they are trotted out in the press and forced on all of us.
@ianbassin @mommydog67 I have a real problem with my tax dollars going to this.  What process do everyday citizens use to complain and get justice over these unethical use of our dollars?
@brycetache White Nationalist Party
@JuddLegum You found the racists.
@SenGaryPeters I have an idea for you:  Write AND PASS new gun laws in our nation.
@kylegriffin1 @klr_reno I want to remind everyone that our tax dollars are being used to pay for this hate-filled, pathological liar's trips across the US where his sole goal is to further divide our country into shreds.
@Jim_Jordan No.  YOU are part of the problem, riding that Trump train all the way to this point.
@oliverdarcy @FoxNews isn't dog whistling anymore....full on racist bull horns.
@thehill I want to know HOW THIS TERRORIST was radicalized.  ANY IDEAS? https://t.co/Q6xeMgjnrN
He knows.  He fought Nazis. https://t.co/KlijIu98c4
@realDonaldTrump You are sub-human.
@realDonaldTrump @jaketapper American citizens continue to be slaughtered on your watch and this is what you do?  Incite more hatred towards the people who offer any criticism against you, even ones who had bombs shipped to them.  You are a disgusting waste of humanity.  #VeteransAgainstTrump
@RBReich Imagine you are standing on the shore of a lake within reach of someone drowning and you repeatedly yell "THOUGHTS &amp; PRAYERS" without lifting a finger to save them.  That's our politicians during and after every mass shooting.

@thehill I'm going to call bullshit on him.
@PreetBharara Or ever, to be honest
@senatemajldr People die and all you care about is your job security and blood money from the NRA.
@JeffFlake Stop wringing your hands, gather GOP leadership together and DO SOMETHING
@realDonaldTrump Well, you had the chance today but instead, chose to rail angrily and endlessly about the media and the Democrats.  You blew it.  You are a monster and you are completely unfit for office.  #UnstableIdiot  #SoullessSubHuman
