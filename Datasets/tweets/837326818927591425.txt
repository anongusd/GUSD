@FarmBureau @realDonaldTrump Sources: DEREGULATION	President Trump said his Administration was putting an end to the “regulatory assault &amp; relentless intrusion from an army of regulators.” So far, the deregulation relating to agriculture has involved killing protections that many family farmers fought for.
@FarmBureau @realDonaldTrump To that point, an unintended consequence of the new tax law could be the loss of important farm programs through the USDA. According to the Center for Rural Affairs, under existing budget sequestration rules (put in place to control the federal deficit),
@FarmBureau @realDonaldTrump In addition, data from the USDA’s Economic Research Service estimates that up to 80 percent of the law’s benefits for farmers will go to the top 1 percent of farm households by income, while the bottom 20 percent of farm households will actually see a tax increase under the law.
@FarmBureau @realDonaldTrump Sources: Trump lied to Farmers. He claimed that $5.5 trillion in tax cuts would go to working families, small businesses,&amp; the family farmer. FACT The estimated value of the tax cuts over the next 10 years is actually $1.5 trillion for families and businesses — not $5.5 trillion.
