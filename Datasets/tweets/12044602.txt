If you own a successful gym but don‚Äôt welcome absolutely everyone, you do not run a successful gym. Do better. Fitness is for each and every one of us.
The weight is the same - no matter if you‚Äôre rich or poor, no matter where you come from, no matter your race, no matter your sexual identity or orientation, no matter what dis‚ùåability you may have.
They prove that fitness is for everyone. We all have the right to be fit. There is no privilege in fitness.
When I walk through the @arnoldsports people tell me I‚Äôm their hero, &amp; I appreciate it. But tonight I wanted to introduce the crowd to some of my heroes. I want to thank Miles Taylor, @DerickCarverBST, &amp; Garrett &amp; Jabari from @SpecialOlympics for inspiring me &amp; the entire crowd. https://t.co/OSaFNcJzK6

@ledbettercarly I agree. I would love to know the process. But it needs to improve.
I‚Äôm, of course, upset about Andy‚Äôs omission. He was a groundbreaking producer who showed that independent filmmakers could make blockbusters like Rambo, Tombstone, Total Recall, Terminator 2, &amp; the list goes on. His movies created many thousands of jobs in Hollywood over decades.
Last night was one of the best @TheAcademy Awards shows I‚Äôve seen. Fantastic performances, smooth flow, and almost a perfect show. The only failure was leaving film icons like Andy Vajna, Carol Channing, R. Lee Emery, Dick Miller and others out of the In Memoriam tribute.
The VA lawmakers truly deserve praise and recognition for passing this bill. They willingly gave some of their power back to the people. I hope other legislators around the country take note.

We can all learn from his example. Today, don't just enjoy your day off. Remember that throughout our history, people from different backgrounds, races, and political parties have come together to defend America. Emulate them. Remember we are all on the same side. Never forget.
It is easy to be offended. It is easy to lash out. It is easy to think of Americans with different views as the other side. But that is the path of weakness. @DanCrenshawTX showed us how to be strong, how to do the hard work of coming together, how to rise above.
As we observe Veterans Day today, I can't stop thinking about the grace and courage @DanCrenshawTX showed on @nbcsnl this weekend. He taught all of us an urgent lesson that can help us through our current divisions. https://t.co/ch1TPpfmfZ

I want to thank every person I met who worked on these campaigns, all of the volunteers, and those of you who donated your hard-earned money to help achieve victory. You inspire me.
Earlier this year Ohioans passed their own reform. We have the momentum. The rigged scam of gerrymandering is 200 years old, but these states join California and Arizona in telling the politicians that you don‚Äôt get to pick your voters any more - we pick you.
Whether you rooted for a blue wave or a red wave, the biggest wave last night was the people‚Äôs wave. And it swept through our country. Three states - MI, CO, and MO - reformed their redistricting process and we are waiting on results from UT. #TerminateGerrymandering
Thank you. Hopefully soon, it will be hasta la vista to gerrymandering everywhere. https://t.co/zKz6paja2u

As proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that I hold above all else - American. My full statement: https://t.co/biRvY8S3aZ
Since we passed AB32, our cap and trade bill, in 2006, we are booming. Last year our GDP growth was 4.2% compared to the US's 2%. @nytimes
One issue, though, @nytimes. You say politicians can look north to see protecting the enviro won't hurt economy. They can look west at CA!
Congratulations to Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau on this great step for Canada's clean energy future. Proud of you. https://t.co/jI0OAWpI1c

For success in creating a smart energy future, we have to work together on big picture, proven solutions and leave no stone unturned. 4/4
When we add up our renewables, they don't count hydro. If we count like the rest of the world, CA will be 50% renewable by 2020. 3/4
Reducing pollution is the big picture. When we built the first power line solely for renewables, extremists tried to block for a turtle. 2/4
This is all true, and I lived through it in CA. Our enviro movement must think big picture to win. Hydro works. 1/4 https://t.co/hLpFo5kMFZ
