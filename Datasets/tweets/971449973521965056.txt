@Jaye528 Yes we actively lobby to change the narrative with our politicians and we are working towards getting legal protections for chronic pain patients.
@Jaye528 We know. That‚Äôs why our organization fights hard to break the stigmas that chronically ill and disabled patients face on a daily basis. It‚Äôs important for our wellbeing that the general public stop believing theses stigmas portrayed by the media and the medical system.
Despite prescription rates  falling drastically since 2016, CDC says 2017 was the worst for OD deaths. Why? Because this crisis is due to illicit street drugs.Not Prescriptions.		The CDC must re-direct their actions, as they‚Äôre killing the American public.	https://t.co/BwKBt5c9ow

@Enough212 @brent_kellogg @reversechapter @ScottGottliebMD @ravensspirit68 We have heard some rumblings in DC as well but nothing concrete. Our eyes are peeled for this so-called help that is supposed to be coming. It is encouraging that @SGottliebFDA is NOT using the CDC for acute guidelines. However we oppose adding more guidelines given CPP suffering
@Enough212 @brent_kellogg @reversechapter @ScottGottliebMD @ravensspirit68 We did see the statements &amp; strongly oppose it. 		They continue to make a path to remove medicines &amp; if we give up they will absolutely succeed!		NO civil rights fight was won easily		And time is of the essence.		Opportunities to speak out about these abuses is HOW we change it!
@brent_kellogg @reversechapter @ScottGottliebMD @ravensspirit68 I know it is difficult. I am sitting in a hospital bed as we speak. But when you say ‚Äúcancel the trip save your money‚Äù some people might take that to heart. We are trying to inspire hope during a very difficult time. If you tell people not to try they give up &amp; no one wants that
@brent_kellogg @reversechapter @ScottGottliebMD @ravensspirit68 I please ask you NOT to tell people not to listen to the hard work we‚Äôre doing. We are fighting too &amp; with you. 		Why are you discouraging any donations anybody helping us? 		I know it‚Äôs frustrating but why are you taking it out on us?		THIS IS WHO YOU ARE PICKING ON Unnecessary https://t.co/pHtTJjPBk0

We can accept donations on the website https://t.co/le7cKVRCgv Thank You so much for your support!!! All CPPs need it üíú
@SteglinskiAlin @brent_kellogg @reversechapter We are actually developing exactly that! We want to provide more services for a community but in order to do that we need to have some money. We will be rolling out a membership platform to encourage a small annual donation. We hope this will empower our members even more!
@LGiles1017 Thank you! We very much hope to raise this thousand dollars. It would only take a small amount from a handful of people to get us there and we will have the presence &amp; the attention of policymakers around the üåé This is an international conference &amp; put the USA in the spotlight!
@LGiles1017 Yes! We all need to take avenge of as many opportunities as we can get so we can alert the general public to what is going on and discuss this issue with the people who have the influence and power to do something about it. This event will absolutely provide that opportunity
@brent_kellogg @reversechapter Yes, they absolutely are. We are a small organization ran by disabled women. We are on disability and between the two of us have 15 illnesses. We struggle just as much as everyone else. And we suffer and fight just like everyone else. Only ask small donation so we can go &amp; fight
@SteglinskiAlin @brent_kellogg @reversechapter The 504-C creates a lot of issues however it is the only way we can properly lobby this issue. 		And, it is because of our lobbying we have been invited to this event so it has its pros &amp; cons. 	Cons we can‚Äôt raise as much money but pros we can work for a community so much better
@brent_kellogg @reversechapter We attended the 2018 RX on it and that was nearly $3000. Which I paid for myself without any donations. That‚Äôs why I was wondering why this was tweeted out as we are always forthright and honest with our work
@brent_kellogg @reversechapter Yes, these are expenses for travel and for printing materials etc. what is convention does not charge however there are many that do and quite a bit. International Pain Conference is $1300 just to attend!! Individuals think we are making money however we are not. We are losing it
@LGiles1017 Thank you Linda! Sadly, there are a lot of expenses. I wish this work was free. I‚Äôve put every penny I could including all my credit cards. This opportunity is huge &amp; it is for all of us! Small money with the thousands of us out there. $1 each &amp; CPPs will be fully represented üíú
@brent_kellogg @reversechapter We are not making any profit. I don‚Äôt know why you would put that out there. We fight and I have spent all my own personal money. We do not profit. But there are many expenses to do this work
