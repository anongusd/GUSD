(20) The level of violence carried out or enabled by socialists worldwide is staggering. 		Finishing the SW US wall represents the frontline of the international struggle for freedom against tyranny. We are all counting on this. 		#MAGA 		END
(19) The resolve of the Trump movement grows stronger each day. IMO, the vast majority of Congressional Republicans are on board with the movement on this issue. Democrats themselves have strengthened the resolve of America's conservative majority. #KeepDiggingDemocrats
(18) Those who understand the urgent need to #FinishTheWall are prepared to wait this out. By that I mean, they will not budge, and Democrats will have to blink first. 		Democrats have benefited from Republican weakness for too long. That ends now.
(17) Ronil Singh found in America a safe haven where the will of the voter was respected, unlike in Fiji. Years of American "Democrat" lawlessness (eg outlaw-sanctuary cities, open borders) have undermined core democratic freedoms. 		Americans have had enough.
(16) The obstructionist Dems falsely assume the new Congress will be able to strengthen their fight against the wall that voters have clearly demanded. 		They will be proven wrong in due course. But how many more innocents have to be slaughtered before they give up the game?
(15) The elected officials who are currently obstructing the expressed will of the people are legally entitled to do so. IMO the best response at this time is to clearly state that that is what they are doing. The daily presidential tweets on the subject are making it clear.
(14) it also means stopping deported violent criminals from simply walking back in. 		An effective border barrier is necessary but not sufficient. And it is what the American people said they wanted in 2016 &amp; at other relevant elections. 		Election results must be accepted.
(13) The lawfully elected government of the USA was chosen by its citizens, and they clearly expressed their desire for effective border security. 		In practice, that means ending outlaw "sanctuary" cities, deporting foreign nationals who commit crime, esp. violent crime, and
(12) Every country that claims to uphold democratic freedoms must respect the rule of law and national sovereignty. The governed have the right to decide who will govern over them. This requires enforcing borders. 		In short, elections have consequences.
(11) The wholly preventable, tragic death of Officer Ronil Singh provides an opportunity to talk about these "first principles:" 		&gt;the rule of law 	&gt;national sovereignty 	&gt;democratic freedoms.
(10) There are numerous examples of socialist revolution and quasi-revolution/civil war in the past two centuries. The international socialist movement seems to constantly foment civil unrest in other countries, as a solution to losing elections.
(9) Lately I've been focusing my research time on the enormous topic of "world political history," in terms of colonization/empire, decolonization, war, and the apparent tendency of socialists to just overthrow a government when they don't like losing an election.
(8) Political parties and therefore governments were divided along racial lines. This is a bad thing. 		The 2006 coup arose after indigenous Fijians who were racist toward Fijian-Indians seized power from recent election winning party, which happened to be mostly Fijian-Indian.
(7) For whatever reason, the Indian population of Fiji, compared to indigenous Fijians, tended to have higher educational attainment &amp; thus the ability to fill more skilled jobs, including professional jobs like lawyers, doctors, teachers etc. An anti-Indian movement grew.
(6) As the British Empire fell in the immediate postwar years from 1945, there was considerable migration: for example from the Caribbean to the UK, from India to Fiji, from Samoa to NZ etc. The Left make out there was mass exploitation &amp; racism; there wasn't, not like today.
(5) You may be wondering why there was a sizable population of people from India living in the Pacific island country of Fiji. Within the former British Empire, there was a labor migration system that saw people moving from place to place to supply labor in growing industries.
(4) America's latest fallen LEO hero was a genuine refugee from political violence, murdered in the line of duty in his country of asylum, by a felon unlawfully in that country. 		#BuildTheWall #BackTheBlue #FreeFiji
(3) In fact, Fiji's violent dictator, Frank Bainimarama, was head of the UN's climate change conference for 2017. How nice. https://t.co/kQHjbmmQRc
(2) The most recent coup in Fiji was in 2006. Naval Commodore Frank Bainimarama overthrow the lawfully elected govt at the barrel of a gun. Despite murder and repression, the international community "forgot" all about it &amp; even gave him a UN role. Of course.
(1) Officer Ronil Singh was a Fijian-Indian who migrated legally to the US &amp; become a police officer. There has been a brain drain of Fijian-Indians over the past 30 years bc of racism &amp; repeated coups. Many came to NZ... they are welcomed here, usually pillars of the community.

@Jonejam222 (25) Translation: We let him talk about his China-friendly ideas then told him what's really going on in the world. 		IMO, NZ needs the US infinitely more than the US needs NZ. Australia, thankfully, represents our region and firmly endorses the US &amp; its current admin.
@Jonejam222 (24) "Welcomed Deputy PM... of NZ to the WH ‚Äì productive discussion about working together on improving bilateral trade. The US &amp; NZ are committed to strengthening our friendship &amp; deepening cooperation on shared goals that benefit both countries." https://t.co/MjL7c4f4OY
@Jonejam222 (23) Winston Peters was finally allowed the honor of meeting with VP Pence at the WH this week. The Communist PM Ardern probably won't be. 		Pence and Trump know exactly how to handle someone like Peters. I'm not worried one bit about that. https://t.co/LZoN0pVXBK
@Jonejam222 (22) I've learned to like GWB. He declared war on terrorism in 2001, and that war rages on. It has since at least WWI. I cover that in other threads. 		Trump has resumed fighting the war on terror, achieving very impressive results, given what he has to work with in the EU.
@Jonejam222 (21) Foreign policy realists like myself, Trump, Reagan, Thatcher &amp; Churchill, see the world as it is, now how we want it to be. 		Everyone else is blinded by wishful thinking, which stops them making good decisions in their own country's interests. 		That's why they lose wars.
@Jonejam222 (20) During the (first) cold war, both sides co-opted personality-disordered conmen like Winston Peters, to do their bidding, often in proxy wars like Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. None of these so-called leaders were reliable or even human rights-abiding but they were useful.
@Jonejam222 (19) Right now, NZ is one of the only Western/former British countries that has almost wholesale rejected the US, embracing Germany, China and, covertly, Russia. 		All because enough of us fell victim to the psy-op. 		Peters is like all those cold war stooges around the world.
@Jonejam222 (18) But I am always happy to devote time to helping people learn about NZ, whether they live here or not. I especially want to encourage Americans and New Zealanders to forge closer relations. We had them once, and we won two world wars that way. 		Germany "worked on" NZ.
@Jonejam222 (17) My energy goes into managing my own health &amp; happiness, assisting those who ask in good faith, and learning all I can about #Americanism, bc that's what really influences what happens in the world, including NZ. 		I can't be a foot soldier, I'm already disabled from the war.
@Jonejam222 (16) After 30 years of following NZ &amp; US politics, including gaining a degree in the subjects, and serving as a NZ govt policy analyst for most of my career, I can't get excited about opposing the UN migration compact. I knew the govt would sign it. Wasn't going to waste energy.
@Jonejam222 (15) I oppose Islamism, which is tangibly violent, not Islam, which is a belief system that individuals can interpret peacefully or violently, like any belief system. 		I oppose open borders bc it is lawlessness. I am tough on law and order. 		Should be easy to understand?
@Jonejam222 (14) It's hard for us, when we're surrounded by a population that still believes CNN tells the truth about world affairs. I empathize with my countrymen and women who now think for themselves. But I won't be bigoted against Muslims, Jews, Christians, or any other group.
@Jonejam222 (13) This small group of redpilled Kiwis are the only people who have their eyes open to what is going on in the world today. Unfortunately, I no longer associate with them bc when I say "not all Muslims," they call me a cuck, or somesuch. And they're often antisemitic, too.
@Jonejam222 (12) But properly-informed Kiwis are well aware that our hitherto avoidance of jihadist attacks is nothing to do with sound foreign or domestic policies. It's just luck. And that luck will eventually change. And there will be tealights, and facebook photo filters, and so on.
@Jonejam222 (11) The reason the former supporters of Winston Peters are so apoplectic about this latest betrayal, is that most of them are very opposed to jihadism, and so am I. 		Miraculously, NZ has so far avoided being the victim of even a small scale jihadist attack.
@Jonejam222 (10) Granted, National probably *would have* signed it now that negotiations have reached that stage, but that isn't the point here. Peters is trying to dodge responsibility for what he's done, which is nothing new.
@Jonejam222 (9) Now, about the UN migration compact (aka open borders lawless insanity designed to further the ancient German, Russian and Chinese desire for world domination.) 		Peters claims that National already "signed up," more or less. This is a lie.
@Jonejam222 (8) NZ now has a batshit crazy far left govt that is intent on destroying our national security and economy, just because a 73 year old conman is still b*tthurt about his former boss from more than THIRTY years ago. 		That's narcissistic personality disorder in a nutshell.
@Jonejam222 (7) So, I feel guilty about it. That aside, it's clear that Winston Peters has spent the past 25 years telling New Zealanders that he leaned slightly to the right of center, when in fact, if anything, he leans left. At heart, his hatred for the National party overrides it all.
@Jonejam222 (6) Before the election, I could not predict which side was going to win, so I chose to vote for Peters' party, so that it would be a "brake" on the worst excesses of either. Had I known then what I know now, I'd have voted for National or ACT. Not that it would have helped.
@Jonejam222 (5) NZ is essentially a puppet state of the socialists who have run Germany for generations. We foolishly adopted their proportional representation voting system in 1993, which was designed to help left wing parties win despite losing.  		They achieved their goal in 2017.
@Jonejam222 (4) Ahead of the 2017 election in NZ, Peters was pretty unpopular. his party only won 7% of the vote, when I thought it was going to do a lot better than that. National won 44%, Labour 36%, Greens 6%. 		Most people thought National would become the govt.
@Jonejam222 (3) IMO, Peters is an extremely intelligent man (a lawyer, go figure) who has, at times, done great things for freedom and liberty in NZ. 		Unfortunately though, in 2017 he betrayed most of his own voters by enabling the unpopular Labour &amp; Green parties to take power.
@Jonejam222 (2) Peters was a National party MP from 1978 but left the party in 1993 after the leadership wouldn't promote him. The only principle Winston Peters has held over time is his hatred for the National party.
@Jonejam222 (1) Hi, I see only one tweet, but it says it all so I will comment on that (over several tweets.) 		Thread: NZ and the UN migration compact. 		MBIE is the govt agency that handles immigration and labor policy. Winston "Judas" Peters is the Dep PM of NZ.
@AwbwFyf I have no trouble telling the difference between liberals and neocons, thanks.
@AwbwFyf I'm not endorsing all on that list fully. Was just a figure of speech, not meant to be taken literally. See my other tweets about Graham. I appreciate his occasional support for Trump, and I abhor his neocon foreign policy views. Trump invited him to this mtg to keep him in line.
@AwbwFyf They're not ALL idiots. Most Republicans in Congress support the MAGA agenda. Unfortunately, the few that don't are able to ruin it for the others.
@AwbwFyf I view the current FOX editorial policy as liberal, not neocon. The younger Murdoch brother, James, is as liberal as they come. IMO, neocons as a group have shrunk immensely and have virtually no power now.

@LJT_is_me I'm not mad at Schumer, he's only doing what all Democrats are trained to do. I'm mad at the 4 GOP squishes who won't go nuclear, &amp; at every GOP non-voter who cost us our 52 majority &amp; who stopped us getting 60+ before then, too.
Having witnessed regular shutdowns for decades now, if I wanted to be a federal employee, I'd darn well set money aside to keep me going during them. 		Many federal employees are paid well enough to have this option. Those who aren't, can choose to work elsewhere. I would.
My prediction is that pro forma sessions will keep this going for at least two weeks, unless there is some kind of miracle that forces Schumer to capitulate early. It's possible. 		Barring that, the #SchumerShutdown will last weeks, not days. 		Fine with me. #BuildTheWall. https://t.co/9S0lxdY2WG
Mitch CAN'T go nuclear on this, bc 4 GOP squishes have declared they will never vote for that. 		Flake, Corker and Hatch all retiring in a matter of days. Replaced by Sinema, Blackburn and Romney.

The same thing will happen here. The polling on the wall is clear already. 		When Dems tried #AbolishIce, 85% of poll respondents were against that. Yet they continue this policy regarding ICE, and every other aspect of sane border policy. https://t.co/Pv7Cm6JmtK
Never give in to terrorists.

@ColinSkow Sorry I haven't researched that but, for example, I know Justin Amash won re-election, and he usually votes against the MAGA agenda. So I don't think soon-to-retire was necessarily the reason most of them voted against MAGA.  They're overly hardcore libertarians, or RINOs.
It's not possible to "over-conservatize." 		The overwhelming majority of Americans right now are conservative, at least on border security. Dozens of as-objective-as-possible polls support this view. The others are just more fake news rigged polls to influence, not inform. https://t.co/KXWy98CvHU
The Republican dream team. #StayStrong #MAGA #BuildTheWall. https://t.co/y20EY3XrM7
Nope, that's the wrong take. Trump's resolve on the wall is already as strong as it needs to be. IMO he held this meeting to again telegraph to the Ds the historic level of Republican unity on this issue, and to remind all present of what's at stake if they were to cave. https://t.co/3lT31Zc50C
LOL. Good luck, Chuckie. 		You already lost this battle. Just a matter of time. https://t.co/H8DtUyIdKw
Trump has no reason to concede to a deal that has less than $5.6 billion for the wall in this budget. 		$25 billion is the amount required. He's already conceded most of that, for now.

@MyPupVoted @Egil_Skallagrim @darkbeats51 No offense, but I would get the same level of predictive results from reading Tarot cards.
(20) I have seen no new information showing that it's the right time to halve the US forces in Afghanistan, which is a completely different set of circumstances to Syria. 		We (allies) must remain tough on the Taliban, Pakistan, Iran, &amp; Russia. The war on terror ain't over.
(19) Obviously, my opinion on the matter is immaterial, that's fine. In August 2017 this President made clear commitments on his #SouthAsiaStrategy, about only leaving AFG when a well-reasoned case can be made for that.  		I will read any WH statement on it with great interest.
(18) 7 hours ago I wrote all the above tweets without having heard that a troop withdrawal is "reportedly" planned for in Afghanistan, too. 		If that gets confirmed, I'll need to revise my position on all this. I do NOT want to see US strength in that theater reduced atm. But...
You know, last time we came close to a government shutdown (it wasn't even 24 hours IIRC), I sensed the mood of the sane American majority was "so be it." 		Today, it's even more so. Those who hate having secure borders have had ample time to get on board. Too bad.		#MAGA

I've seen so many public figures start out with that view of Trump but later come to admire and love him for the substance, regardless of the style. IMO he shows gravitas at least half of the time, and every time its needed eg memorials. Faultless on that.
@ckolacia @Egil_Skallagrim @darkbeats51 OK well the reply was not to that tweet. I explain about Haley in the rest of the thread. Some are saying she and Mattis want to primary Trump, which IMO is ridiculous.

@ckolacia @Egil_Skallagrim @darkbeats51 Hi @ckolacia, is this reply directed towards @Egil_Skallagrim or me?
@meowandyawn It's possible, but I don't think it would have been necessary. All he had to do was ask for his resignation. And those statements are all on-point atm anyway. It's nothing to do with the lisp, lol. It's that NO ONE can win a primary against Trump, period.
@oncewasegg Not clear what you mean, sorry, can you clarify? In the thread I list two options, including that Mattis could be faking his dislike of Trump's actions for some kabuki theater reason. And I'm not making firm arguments either way yet, just speculating with limited info.
@Egil_Skallagrim @darkbeats51 Thanks for telling me about your pinned tweet, I will read it later when I have more time. Can you tell me why he would despise Trump? Is it bc Trump didn't serve?
(17) No one can win a 2020 GOP primary against Trump. 		Unless something bizarrely new and major happens, no one can win against Trump in the general in 2020. They just can't. Waste your own time with this BS if you like, but you won't be able to waste mine with it.
(16) Haley's name has come up in the ludicrous articles I'm seeing after Mattis' resignation letter. 		I don't think Mattis would try to run against Trump, bc he knows darn well he wouldn't stand a chance. And, he's not an enabler of Democrat electoral wins. Come on now.
(15) OK those of you claiming Nikki Haley is not a natural born citizen &amp; therefore ineligible to be POTUS need to get a clue. Or at least avoid tweeting me about it. 		Her parents came to the US for her father's academic job, so their immigration status was fine. No issue there.
@maude191 @GenFlynn Where is Rogers atm?
@jray_redfever Could very well be true. Thanks for the suggestion.
@Patriotress @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @nikkihaley @bigleaguepol Do not tweet this link to me again.
@Patriotress I'm not buying that at all. Disinfo spreaders say this every time a major player resigns and besides, Haley IS eligible.
@Egil_Skallagrim @darkbeats51 Yeah, it reads like he was having a tantrum over something. If it's fake, I will certainly eat my hat. But my gut feeling is that it's real. Trump did say in oct that he's "a bit of a Democrat."
(24) My pledge to spend less time writing Twitter threads isn't working out very well.üòÇ  		Oh, Mattis. I have such mixed feelings about you. Still, I'd want you with me if the SHTF, with your plan to kill everyone you meet.üëâ¬† 		https://t.co/KMLCSbMFH0
(14) Having reassured the neolibs and neocons that he's not really much of a Trump man after all, wouldn't Mattis be the ideal Trump appointee for an international role reforming the UN, NATO, or something like that? 		As always, "we'll see what happens." https://t.co/aC030ZpVHu
(13) Like others who leave the admin, Mattis had a choice. He could go quietly, &amp; stay popular with the MAGA movement. Or he could drop these words into his letter, ensuring a Hoover Center fellowship, speaking tours, &amp; all the rest. There's another speculation, though:
(12) On another note, perhaps he did this bc he's well aware of what Trump has got planned for the prosecutions phase of #Obamagate #Draintheswamp #Lockthemup, and his heart just wasn't in it. 		That's fine. America does have people willing to step up. Thank God.
(11) It wasn't necessary, for the country or the administration, that he say this at this time. The only person whose interests it serves is Mattis. It enables him to "save face" with the Lindsey Grahams and Marco Rubios of the world. Congrats.
(10) What I find sad is that Mattis, more than anyone, knew how crucial it was to the survival of the Republic, that a President be elected who was willing to properly fund &amp; lead the military, long term. Having gotten that done, he now quibbles over style, not substance.
(9) Perhaps there is an important difference between being an outstanding General and being an outstanding Secretary. It's logical that there would be. 		I won't give up on him based on one letter. I've simply adjusted my view, subject to what I said in tweet (3).
(8) If a friendship is conditional on "treating them with respect," according to the subjective preferences of unelected officials, then they are no friend I'd want to have. 		Perhaps the Secretary doesn't excel in every area, such as politics. He excels in winning wars, though.
(7) Similarly, I firmly believe that this President DOES treat all allies with the respect that they have earned, and that is in the interests of the USA. There is nothing to be gained from playing nice with world leaders who are themselves disgraceful toward their country.
(6) IMO this President has always walked well the very fine line between non-intervention and intervention. The geopolitical world is extraordinarily complex for a POTUS at this time. He does respect the views and advice of advisors, esp. the military.
(5) Look at my Twitter bio. I proudly state I am a hawk. I support a strong national defense, for any country, and strong intervention in response to violence and threats from other countries, and terrorists. 		I guess there are several kinds of hawk.
(4) IMO, the President IS being tough on the biggest adversaries of freedom, Russia and China. No question in my mind. I think he could be tougher on them, but I have nowhere near the level of accurate current info that Mattis has, obviously. 		To hear this from Mattis is sad.
(3) Two MAIN possible explanations. Sure, there will be others. 		It could be 4D chess kabuki theater, he's certainly capable of it. 		Or, it could be his genuine feelings and desire to distance himself from some of Trump's actions. Sad.
(2) I love, love, love General James Mattis and always have, from the moment I first learned who he is. That will never change. 		I have two possible explanations for why he chose to mention "respect for allies" &amp; being harder on adversaries in this letter.

@KassMiass He means february bc its well in advance of the JCOS change in sept
@JackaLopez3 @GenFlynn Yes. IMO it absolutely has to be a veteran, preferably a 3 star or above, with combat experience. The Dep Sec is great, but he is from the private business sector.
@elburwick @Mominthestix @GenFlynn IMO, Flynn is way above that level. I think Mulvaney will probably keep the job, and is the right person for it.
@ChevronFitz That's all good, but I've said in several threads recently why I don't have enough time to watch all the videos I'd like to watch, etc. You urged me to watch it, so I'm explaining why I can't. IDC if others want to watch it or not. Maybe let it go.

(9) I've discovered several great-uncles and their friends who fought in WWI, so naturally I've been learning more about that war. In many ways, it was more significant in world history than WWII. Their personal stories are intriguing, too.
(8) "Right now, I‚Äôm scanning photos from my vast collection, in anticipation of writing books on World War One assault troops. I scan &amp; then touch up the images using photo-editing software." 		I'm doing something similar with family history pix &amp; documents. It's time consuming.
(7) In his QV article today, TW says he has "bowed out." I think he means bowed out from social media; it seems to be working for him. Every day I read tweets where people say "I miss TW." Well, my response to that is: Go find him on other websites; read one of his books, etc.
(6) I never intended to become what I now call an amateur pundit on US and world politics. But it is one of the things that gives my life meaning. If you've lost a thriving career to disability or something else, you will know what I mean. 		If I wasn't online, I'd still write.
(5) Despite our differences, it fascinates me that TW &amp; I have similar backgrounds &amp; lifestyles (he was the one who coined the term Lady Hermitess; there are quite a few of us on Twitter.) Disability forces me to spend much of my time at home, but I found the silver lining.
(4) It's pretty obvious that my favorite commentator is https://t.co/1XEJlXqZSI, and I wouldn't have known who he was if I hadn't started reading TW's tweets almost two years ago. So I am forever grateful to TW. We disagree on many issues but that doesn't matter... why should it?

@scruffchick Thank you, Linnie!
RT @GodlessNZ: (1) My thoughts on some recent Trump tweets. 		This video clip from an hour ago is wonderful. I will let him speak for himse‚Ä¶
(22) You can pretty much keep up with events just by reading President Trump's tweets. LOL. 		https://t.co/j69pLLAVKw
(34) OK, I'm all caught up, phew! 		My admiration for President Trump's intellect, character and courage is renewed. Friends, I recommend taking a short break away from Twitter every now and then. It does you a world of good. Perspective. 		#MAGA 		END
(33) New York Democrats - SSDD. 		I swear, one day, we will flip the entire state back to red, like it was in Reagan's time. Outside NYC is virtually Trump Country. https://t.co/ccFNauk1cu
(32) A short tweet, that says so much. 		I'm just going to pause and enjoy this moment. It reminds me of when Iraq and partners liberated Mosul. 		Much to celebrate. 		https://t.co/PA1ZmFIZzH
(31) There just aren't going to be enough private sector workers to get the wall finished without using USACE &amp; other military groups for at least some of it. 		Eminent domain resistors may warrant the use of emergency powers. We'll see.
(30) He specified the greatly increasing inflow of drugs &amp; crime. This increasingly justifies the involvement of the national security parts of govt. 		With national &amp; (some) local resistance, it makes sense for (eg) USACE to do the work. They are infrastructure experts.
(29) I'm glad he spelled out (yet again) that a POTUS has many ways to get this done, &amp; that the Dems &amp; the tiny, dwindling group of RINOs will NOT be able to stop him. 		The worse the border crisis gets, the more he can use the military &amp; other budgets to #FinishTheWall. https://t.co/zVbpzWTcDJ
RT @jenay_shanks: @GodlessNZ So well said. Remember what's he's done, and what he's up against. He's astounding. üá∫üá∏
@Bfklin @drawandstrike He is exactly the kind of President that the Founding Fathers had in mind. Someone who knows real life/business/common sense and doesn't need to be President, but does it to serve the country.
@dubiousbellbott Great to hear, and I feel the same way! The more I read about what our countries did to survive and win two world wars, the more motivated I am to #NeverSurrender and to keep the gains they won. 		https://t.co/oeZCs0Oetd
RT @dubiousbellbott: @GodlessNZ Sometimes it wears me out. But I will never surrender. Godspeed, friend.
(28) I'm pleasantly surprised that this bill was passed, and so quickly. He said it would be done by Christmas, and it appears that it was. 		There were some detail issues to iron out, but I assume that happened. Sorry, I no longer have time to study that, which makes me sad! https://t.co/laSgqpVRsb
(27) There's definitely scope for memes about "slat-shaming." J/s https://t.co/SFvtHRS9GX
(26) LOL. I can just hear him saying this, with emphasis in certain places. "Artistically designed steel slats... beautiful." 		Their behavior makes it easy for him to repeatedly paint them into a corner. How can you be "down" when there's all this entertainment to be had? üçø https://t.co/yRpRdgRMl6

(23) He then RT this. IMO it's important to remember that the long-overdue Space Force isn't about "fighting wars in space," it's mainly about bringing together all the things the US mil is already doing, including comms, weather, reconnaissance, etc. 		https://t.co/mUCdxZunBi

@dubiousbellbott You're right. It's just that I don't like seeing Paris portrayed as anything more than the feeble annual French dust-up that I think it is. As always, I guess "we'll see what happens."
@Bfklin @drawandstrike Very well said. I especially love how all of us were able to learn long ago how Trump does this, but literal world leaders, academics, &amp; media haven't got a clue. It's so bizarre that it's funny. https://t.co/qaMFQxhyVr
(20) Very important info here. Compelling. 		Q: Who is going to restore those who were harmed? 	A: The Trump administration.  		And, blowing it all open will educate many future voters about the difference between right &amp; wrong. Since their parents didn't. https://t.co/Dgz8DV89TY
(19) A very pertinent question, Mr President. 		I'm sure he knows to look back to the legislation from 1965, &amp; every WH &amp; Congress since then. 		And don't @ me about Reagan. Sheesh. Get a clue. 		https://t.co/wQvzl7PyfV
(18) While every POTUS has people from Wall Street in the WH, you should look up how Obama filled those roles. Pretty much outsourced the hiring process to CitiBank. And it showed, didn't it? 		That's what I call interference. But the media? Crickets.
(17) Obviously, he is not overstepping his powers &amp; literally directing the Fed on what to do, he is speaking like the American entrepreneur that he is, &amp; speaking for Main Street in particular. 		But but he's really uneducated, right? /sarcasm 		https://t.co/aatGT0gXkO
(16) OK I think it was a bit hyperbolic to say the world is blowing up around us and Paris is burning but, whatever. As always, take him seriously, not literally, folks. Unless you want to look like a Democrat fool (pardon the redundancy.) 		https://t.co/1TMqHqUh5L
(15) Another issue that I came to understand in 2016. It's sad that for some folk, it's only dawning on them now, but I guess it's down to lib brainwashing, that once affected me as badly as it has affected others. 		Sunlight is the best disinfectant. 		https://t.co/su2ERslj1n
(14) Back in 2015-16 when I started hearing the details of why ObamaCare was so bad, it was the deductibles that I saw as the biggest problem. The hyperinflation of deductibles rendered the plans worthless in practice. Crazy stuff. 		https://t.co/hL6eLRzfCB
(13) Multiple angles here. The Sessions-bashing has been picked up again bc Whitaker &amp; hopefully Barr have some things to do soon. It forces our adversaries to defend the office of the AG, &amp; esp. Sessions. Him letting the Mueller investigation happen was positive in many ways. https://t.co/enrnaTGkPz
(12) Another tweet to educate the public. 		We don't need to reach them all. Just enough of them to consider voting GOP in the next couple of elections. Trump knows that "you catch more bees with honey than vinegar." He uses every avail. teaching tool. 		https://t.co/ixYHikt1OM
Well said https://t.co/jz0ZZ03Jn2
@Bfklin @drawandstrike Trump has carefully worked on arranging things so that each of those countries will have to surrender in due course. The Iran sanctions have only been in place for a few weeks. In 3-6 months, things will be very different.
@leefelix75 He sounds like a Democrat. The ones who are like that, I don't even call them RINOs anymore.

(9) If you're tired of waiting for the big criminals to get caught, stop and think about the alternative. There's no chance that Horowitz, Huber, or anyone else who is doing the necessarily secret work of *preparing* successful prosecutions would have been able to do this.
(8) Obviously, if Golsteyn's case had been completed during the Obama years, he probably would have been executed by now. While monstrous killers higher up in the admin. got off scot free. So far. 		Trump is steadily clearing the innocent &amp; going after the guilty. Takes time.
(7) IMO this is an open-and-shut case &amp; I look forward to the complete exoneration of Maj. Golsteyn, Silver Star. 		BUT THERE'S MORE. 		(As always.) When you read about this case, reminder that a military tribunal can order the death penalty. 		J/s.  		https://t.co/bc8mpaayUQ
@leefelix75 Who is he? LOL
(6) In these many tweets about #SpyGate stuff (actually #ObamaGate), Trump is achieving several goals. He's scaring the bejesus out of the criminals, which isn't strictly necessary, but is always fun. 		He's also educating the public, day by day. Watch.
(5) The Senate has the power to stop the excesses of the House Democrats. And there are many other good things about the situation in which we find ourselves. 		Rome wasn't built in a day, folks! Hold the line. 		BTW, these texts still exist. No problem. 		https://t.co/rjKnhae2hF
(4) A lot of folk in the MAGA movement seem a bit down atm, bc of events since 11/6. I get it, I do. But I'm not feeling down about things, at all. Maybe the break helped. (I recommend it!) 		Trump always knew we'd have to #DefyHistory &amp; in fact, we did, in the Senate.
(3) Now for the tweets I missed while on a break. This one is accurate &amp; not new, but I like that he mentions collusion at the end. We've seen the clear evidence of most of the beltway MSM being paid to spread the BS dossier &amp; more. It will all come out. 		https://t.co/HNCDYYBLVl
(2) It's high time we gave proper credit to all the military &amp; other personnel who have contributed to the victory against ISIS. 		Ofc it isn't over, I know. But Trump is right to celebrate with the country the substantive victory achieved in 17-18. Local allies "have the watch." https://t.co/tZALhxqlGJ

That's what we're there for. https://t.co/jA7sbpHNqH
@Bfklin @drawandstrike I think Assad has retained power bc Iran, Qatar, Turkey and Russia want him to. 		It wasn't going to be worth the US and allies trying to take that on. Lindsey Graham would have done it in a New York minute, of course.
@Dave_Erne @Exasperated5 @KurtSchlichter @POTUS The GOP is NOT "out of power" in the Senate, which confirms judges and senior officials. that is huge. 		The few GOP politicians who haven't fully supported the MAGA agenda are actually Democrats. One is dead &amp; most others are leaving soon. Have a little patience and foresight.
@Dave_Erne @Exasperated5 @KurtSchlichter @POTUS No wall yet, but its coming. The only reason we have no House in January is that enough would-be GOP voters stayed home. Did you vote?
@Bfklin @drawandstrike Oh it would be great for the people of Syria if they weren't still being oppressed by the Assad family but, first things first. IMO it's more important that the government regains control of the country, then eventually the people can change the regime. It's a big job.
@scwiggs IDK what is going to happen with Brexit, but I know the people who voted for it in 2016 have done everything they can to make it happen, and there's nothing they can do about it rn. There's the usual fearmongering and disinfo, so I'm just waiting to see what eventually happens.
@Bfklin @drawandstrike It's not about strategic value, it's about going after terrorists wherever they are found. In this case it appears that regional partners are now willing to take over the work. They were always able, but Obama wanted to maintain perpetual war, bc it weakens the US.
@KassMiass @Fliggsy LOL, thanks.üòÇ
@scwiggs I view the WTO the same way I view the UN, EU etc. Reform is necessary but not sufficient. Going back to first principles in each case exposes what the original intent was &amp; how far away from it they've been taken. International law enforcement is problematic in itself.
@scwiggs Bilaterals are def. the way to go. They best respect national sovereignty. 		I don't have a problem with multinationals existing. There isn't an alternative regulatory system that keeps markets free. It's up to regulators (govts) to enforce the law. Crooks will always be crooks.
@scwiggs My policy work experience is almost entirely in domestic not foreign policy but I always planned consultation exercises at various stages of the process. The possibility of a US-UK trade deal is super exciting. Can't wait.
@Bfklin @drawandstrike Yes, if they're needed for an operation, they can be put in there in a matter of hours, theoretically. Also lots of airstrike capable bases/ships all around the region.

I've arrived at the following position on him &amp; Lindsey Graham: They each have a number of policy areas where they agree with Trump &amp; will vote accordingly eg SCOTUS, certain tax/crime reforms, Cuba/VZ etc, but otherwise are RINOs.
@pharmacy_trader @KurtSchlichter Thanks, useful info to have.
@scwiggs Well, multinationals are owned by shareholders like smaller companies are, &amp; individual property rights mean those investors should have freedom to make a profit within the law. Anyone can buy shares/stocks if they want to. If govt gets out of the way, free markets work it out.
@scwiggs Requesting feedback is just an exercise in going through the motions, they never listen to feedback on these things. They didn't with the TPP. The housing cap can always be changed to suit. Our housing crisis has many causes, foreign investment is a bit of a red herring tbh.
@scwiggs I admit, you've followed Assad issues more closely than me. I think MBS, Bibi &amp; Trump all want the govt of Syria to win against the rebels (of any stripe.) Assad is a murderous tyrant who gasses civilians, but Syria is better off with him than if Iran were given free rein there.

@Exasperated5 @Dave_Erne @KurtSchlichter @POTUS You're helping the Democrats. Byeeee.
@phreshoneTX Yes, I should have added the GCC. Was focusing just on Israel for some reason. I need a second cup of morning coffee.
@scwiggs The problem with this theory is that Assad, Qatar and Iran hate Israel, KSA and the US. There are two clearly demarcated camps. But I agree with you the the GCC and Israel will eventually drive them all out, one way or another. Trump told them if they didn't, things would get bad
@fivestarmichael You are anti-Republican, and anti national security. I have no interest in hearing your assertions, after 30 years of hearing them from others.
@Dave_Erne @Exasperated5 @KurtSchlichter @POTUS Asshats in both parties are stopping the wall from being built. Every Democrat is against it, while only some Republicans are.
@ABPatriotWriter Yes. It's another example supporting the theory that Obama is anti-American, so he supported causes like that of Iran, to maintain perpetual wars in the MENA, to weaken US willingness to fight and win. https://t.co/J4q7pOif9K

(23) Not interested in muh Russia, muh WMDs, muh NWO talk. Tell it to someone who cares. 		I believe Trump's decision is an excellent one, and I look forward to the naysayers having to admit that in due course. 		Meanwhile, I need some more popcorn. And cowbell. 		END
(22) Every person who is attacking this decision, whether from the Democrat side, the Rand Paul wing, or the Steve Bannon wing, is ill-informed about contemporary strategies/capabilities, and the national security lessons of the past century. 		I just ignore their ramblings.
(21) Knowing Trump's values on national security, honed by years of studying military and other history, I don't believe for one moment that he'd withdraw the troops from Syria without a better way to see the goals achieved. 		He understands the lessons of the past.
(20) Almost all current FBI staff are heroes, bc they work diligently every day to prevent crime, including the next Pearl Harbor or 9/11. We never see how many lives would have been lost if they hadn't thwarted these attacks. 		Comey &amp; co placed that work at grave risk.
(19) Yes, I'm concerned that a number of ISIS fighters are still in Syria. Frankly, they're all over the world. Look at how many thousand people are on the terrorist watch list in each European country. Look at how many attacks in the US are being thwarted by the rank &amp; file FBI.
(18) If we'd learned the lessons from Pearl Harbor, where almost as many people were murdered as they were on 9/11, there wouldn't have been a 9/11, or a Vietnam War. 		The lesson: The only way to have peace is #PeaceThroughStrength.
(17) Because of the time zone difference, the mid morning of 9/11/01 was the early hours of 9/12/01 here in NZ. Color photos of the twin towers being attacked made the front page of our morning newspapers. 		I realized that if I was able to enlist in the military, I would have.
(16) There are two seminal works explaining this phenomenon: @FieldOfFight by national hero @GenFlynn, and Gander, by his friend https://t.co/IMTNkQ3nsA. 		I will never forget my thoughts and feelings on 9/12/01. None of us should forget them.
(15) If a competent, ethical President had been in office on November 24, 1964, US involvement in Vietnam would have succeeded, and quickly. 		Of course, Islamic National Socialist terrorism was attacking the US long before 9/11/01, but that's the day most of us woke up to it.
(14) In 1964, Communist expansionism, assisted by domestic players, was the number one threat to US national security (after a nuclear bomb detonation.) 		In 2018, it's international terrorism. (And some of them have nukes.)
(13) From his first day in office, Johnson was blinded by his selfish ambitions in domestic policy. He thought he didn't have to make nat'l security his top priority, or even a high priority. He didn't actually care if Communism spread to South Vietnam, or elsewhere.
(12) The lesson I draw from US involvement in the Vietnam War is not that a potential quagmire must be avoided at all costs. It's that when you go in to defend your vital interests, you better give it everything and stay the course. 		Johnson didn't are about US interests at all.
(11) Eisenhower &amp; Kennedy each had a rational, workable plan for stopping Communist expansion through Asia, when it had reached Vietnam. 		It was Johnson who completely messed up that country, leading the American public to learn the wrong lesson from that decade.
(10) We all accept that the US cannot be everywhere. Choices have to be made. When the time is right an ally or group of allies can take over the lead in a given conflict. What we must not continue doing is walking away from a conflict just bc it is icky. That's the wrong lesson.
(9) Islamic National Socialism is the ideology that has outsmarted us for generations, now. It morphs into communist expansionism, the PLO, Al Qaeda, ISIS, the IRA, ETA, Hamas, and Hezbollah. It will morph into another form eventually. 		Are we going to do what it takes to win?
(8) I've spent the past few weeks bingeing on military history docos from WWI, WWII, &amp; subsequent conflicts. It's fascinating, and highly relevant to the present day. 		I believe we must keep faith with the work of those who came before us. Our enemy is a shapeshifter.
(7) Far more important for the policy debate within the US right now, is what to do about terrorists &amp; Iran's malign influence in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Qatar, Turkey, Lebanon, Yemen, and several African countries. I'd rather hear the Syria pundits' views on those threats.
(6) The 3 allies have plenty of regional capability that is within range of Syrian targets. I am certain that if Trump had credible information that the number of ISIS fighters in Syria could not be addressed by US partners (eg Israel), he wouldn't withdraw the troops.
(5) Israel has been neutralizing the Syria-based Iranian forces and Iran-backed forces since Trump took office in January 2017. The US has focused more on the same players in Iraq and elsewhere. 		If US-UK-FR air strikes are needed again, withdrawing troops makes no difference.
(4) Out of all the wars that Obama started or in other cases wrecked for 8 years, Syria at this point is arguably the most dispensable for the US. 		I'm not worried about the proposed withdrawal in the slightest. Israel has had the situation well in hand for nearly two years.
(3) I vehemently oppose both the Democrats' national security policy AND the moronic isolationism of the Rand Paul/Steve Bannon wings of our side of the political spectrum. 		Obviously, Trump is no longer a Bannonist on national security, THANK GOD!
(2) Bibi's other tweet. So far these two tweets have had very few retweets. 		It always amuses me when the beltway completely loses its shit for 24 hours, when all they had to do was a bit of ordinary research to find the real story. Lulz. 		https://t.co/gDjb7djfdQ
(1) Two important points in these two Bibi tweets. 		Pt 1: The US has "other ways of expressing its influence in the area." 		Pt 2. Nothing stops Israel from taking whatever self defense actions needed. 		So, all will be well. No need for alarm. #TwoWaysToWin, actually several. https://t.co/iVv5UmnOUM
Wrong. The US does have legal authority to enforce the international agreements forbidding the use of chemical weapons, plus fighting the global war on terror, which is just as bad as it was on 9/12/01, thanks to Iran, the Dems, Russia, China, &amp; Germany. 		You see it as "icky." https://t.co/Yc6g5kYWBV
Because they're totally different.  		Trump's August 2017 #SouthAsiaStrategy speech explained the reasons. AFG remains as much of a hotbed for terrorist training &amp; resourcing as it was when Obama took over &amp; LIHOP ("let it happen on purpose.") 		Iran must be free.

@ccastlex23 Indeed. It first got my antennae twitching bc I know @GenFlynn hasn't tweeted for a long time and likely won't until all this is over. He's smarter than some others, lol. 		Then I saw the spelling and finally, the Fan Club part in the bio. At least this a/c is open about it.

@basedrogbennett You can only start a convo with someone if they're willing. McSally very nearly won, which tells me she DOES appeal to GOP voters in the STATE. Attitudes like yours contributed to Sinema winning the seat. So no, I'm not very impressed with "anti-estab" talk. it lets Ds win.
@tweeterthanwine I am sure she will excel at this task, and will win her next election comfortably.
@basedrogbennett I wasn't having a disagreement or conversation with you. If you knew anything about me you'd understand why I can't be bothered spending time on the subject with someone who would say what you did. She only lost bc of Dem vote fraud, for starters.
@DoringHaak @mike_pence @MarthaMcSally Ridiculous comment.
@ABPatriotWriter That's right. All district vacancies will get filled quickly, too. And any arising higher court vacancies. Plus anything else POTUS needs to do with special/new judicial positions, and agency positions. The executive is finally being unleashed to do its job.
@Fear_Not_Ever @stevenportnoy Uh no, the judge was given incorrect information previously. Which is not surprising, given who the prosecutor is. A court can only work with the information given in evidence.

@RogerXMathew I only remember from the late 70s onward, but I can tell from learning about 20th century history that no European countries should be yoked together in an EU-style organization. It's insane, for "democracy," and the rule of law. No borders, no country.
@RogerXMathew I think Tony Blair poisoned the well, in terms of discrediting the moderates in Labour, driving the party to the far left in backlash against him bc of Iraq. IMO, until enough people on the left in the UK &amp; US understand why it was a Just War, voters will stay far-left.

(33) My current view is that the deaths of Price and Stearney were suicides, unrelated to partisan politics, and that the death of Boorda was probably the same. As always, my view could change with adequate new evidence. "We'll see what happens."
(32) If nothing else, the Navy's handling of the aftermath of Stearney's death shows how much has changed in 22 years. 		Like all government agencies, the Navy knows that the public is much better able to access official information. If they want to cover up, that will be hard.
(31) In the past, I believed the death of Boorda was not adequately demonstrated by the evidence to be a suicide, but after studying the evidence about the deaths of Price and Stearney, I've reconsidered that. IMO, it has be decided on a case by case basis.
(30) The below article is from 1996. The death of Admiral Boorda is often included in lists of suspected "Arkancides," ie suspicious deaths that may have been political assassinations, many of which were made to look like suicide.  		https://t.co/w3Y1I9aAqB
(29) I began this thread with a link to my earlier thread about the death of Cmdr Job Price in 2012. Another apparent suicide that readers should learn about is the 1996 death of then Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jeremy Boorda. The above article includes this: https://t.co/KXgVc0z459
(28) Two weeks after the death of VADM Scott Stearney there is still no info from the official investigation. However, comments at his memorial by family members, coupled with the lack of official denial, suggests this was a suicide. 		A must-read: https://t.co/xfmV4foE02
(7) Personally, I prefer "incident" to "mishap," but I know the military will have analyzed at length which terms they want to use, so I defer to their greater knowledge of the subject. Military culture =/= civilian culture; Only those who have lived in both can fully understand.
(6) When I started following military crashes I bristled at the term "mishap." It sounded overly euphemistic &amp; unserious. 		However, "accident" or "attack" narrow down the cause too early. "Incident" implies the possibility of foul play. Mishap implies accident, but is broader.
(5) Updates will be provided below.  		Investigation of these incidents is so important. It can clear the name of the crews involved and, crucially, it is how we save lives in the future and ensure the military is as ready and lethal as possible. https://t.co/e8QHjpBYxV

@AwbwFyf I do not treat the issue of religion as having any relevance in the Brexit issue, although I'm aware that a lot of people do. Not all Muslims vote for socialist causes, just like not all Jews or Catholics do. I oppose radical extremist Islamism, not Islam itself.
(22) Good point, but I believe that EU leadership &amp; the lemmings who always vote for them have such a hold over the UK Labour party that no Labour PM will be allowed to complete the Brexit process. 		https://t.co/7Q3rg0QUnK
@u2fergus Here's the thread. I hope I've answered your question fully, but if not, just say. https://t.co/mGMlP6IR3y

False dichotomy, because foreign governments are funding both groups to push a socialist agenda. 		See me after class. https://t.co/nZNjyYJ74Z
@LichenCraig Bless your heart. Read the rest of the thread, and then learn some manners.
(21) Seriously, if I were an MP, and I had the choice between ending my career to vote for what I believe is in the interests of the country, or voting the other way and getting re-elected, I'd be updating my resume/CV. 		That's probably why I'm not an MP.üòÇ
(20) The big question now is how many of the 117 Conservative MPs who voted against May as party leader will now get in behind her &amp; vote FOR the Brexit deal. That's what I'd do, but I'm a pragmatist. 		The self-above-country MPs will join the opposition and vote NO to the deal.
(19) I get that May's proposed Brexit deal is pretty sucky. See the rest of the thread for my arguments for approving it. 		The EU bosses will NEVER allow the UK to renegotiate. So it's either this deal, or no deal. 		The anti-May faction says no deal is better than this deal.
(18) Each country that chose to join the EU now has the same dilemma that the British had in 2016. Whether to stay or go. 		The wealthiest EU countries have more of an incentive to leave, since they're being exploited by the poorer countries. 		Basic economics.
(17) I absolutely support Brexit &amp; have since the campaign in 2016. It's not about immigration, race or religion (duh.) It's about civic nationalism, which is the sovereign right of the people to elect their government &amp; control their own borders. 		The EU is anathema to liberty.
(16) I'm a pragmatist, not an idealist. The criticism of May comes from purists who are, ultimately, more interested in selling books and website clicks than acting in the country's interests. Some of them are funded by socialists, to divide and conquer. 		A time honored tactic.
(15) And so it begins... 		May's opponent judges her by the standards of 30 years ago, when having only a small number of internal dissidents was viewed as OK. 		Times have changed. In 2018 these results are fine. https://t.co/RdsfU0gp8K
(14) If you look at history over decades, not months and years, you see that in the UK and the US, majorities (in general) have been shrinking. It's the new normal. IMO, we should not judge the leaders of today by the standards of 30 years ago. 		IOW, a win's a win.
(13) This is a good point, IMO. May won this vote 63 - 37%, and the people voted for Brexit 52 - 48%. 		Division within the UK has been exploited by the EU leaders who don't want to lose their cash cow. Unity within the UK is the best way to defeat them. https://t.co/BylhnAoniV
(12) Some positive comments from May's supporters. https://t.co/6D0ONXNvO1
(11) See this is what I mean. Every word of this pre-prepared statement makes Merkel, Macron and all the other socialist-globalist EU enemies of freedom smile. 		Once they take over the UK, they can assist Iran, Putin, Xi, Assad, and the Houthis and Palestinians even more. https://t.co/90jpa5yvwV
(10) RESULT: Theresa May survives leadership vote. 		For now. https://t.co/6hBewdaewb
(9) I've predicted many times before that if there is enough division among Conservative-leaning voters at the next election, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn will be a shoe-in for the PM's job, and that is very, very scary for the UK, Europe, and Israel.
(8) Because Conservatives needed the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) after the 2016 election, in order to form a legislative majority and become the government again, the Conservatives had less power to control the Brexit planning process. They had to accommodate the UUP's wishes.
(7) The UK is comprised of 4 countries; it's wrong to refer to it as England, but some Americans do that bc the 4 countries became the UK in 1801, after the American Revolution. 		Northern Ireland has the most to lose from a bad Brexit deal, or worse, leaving with no deal.
(6) When David Cameron resigned in 2016, there was a caucus election and May won. She then opted to call a snap election, to increase her mandate. She didn't have to call it, and it backfired on her. She hung on, thanks to the Ulster Unionist party from Northern Ireland.
(5) The Westminster system allows the legislature to remove a PM with a "vote of no confidence." Tonight's vote was one step short of that, as it's a vote within the Conservative party caucus. If May loses, the Caucus will elect a new leader, who is automatically the new PM.
(4) The US system was designed so that the head of govt and head of state would be the same person, and there is no provision to alter the 4 yearly election cycle. Replacements follow the line of succession. See Gerald Ford for an example of changes to the line of succession.
(3) The UK uses the Westminster system of government, which is more or less the same system used in Canada, Australia, NZ and many other countries. 		Unlike the US, the head of govt can be selected by the legislature at any time, and does not necessarily trigger an election.
(2) Live updates on the Theresa May vote here: 		https://t.co/OxdCZkfUv9
(1) The Prime Ministership of the UK. 		Tonight in London, the ruling Conservative party voted on whether to keep Theresa May as PM. The outcome will be publicly known within minutes. 		Below is info about how the British system works &amp; what might happen next.
@u2fergus Good question, I'll start a thread and include the answer there. thanks
@DeeDeCrist Communism is more of an enemy than globalism, IMHO.
The single most important news story affecting the USA rn is whether UK PM Theresa May stays in office or not. 		If she goes, that dramatically increases the chances of commie antisemite Corbyn becoming PM. 		A PM Corbyn won't respond with the US after the 3rd Assad gas attack.
@AwbwFyf I don't think Conservatives will vote to Remain, bc they know what the 52% who voted for Brexit will do, and it won't be pretty. 		They only held the referendum bc they thought Remain would win it.
The MPs voted by 8pm and apparently the result will be announced at 9pm local time. It's currently 8.20pm in London. 		She needs 159 votes to stay in office. 		Live updates: https://t.co/OxdCZkfUv9 https://t.co/6QsFvwdmFP

@divnanata Good points there. The easiest rebuttal to her attack on Don Jr would have been an article listing the multiple examples of pets being eaten for food in socialist countries. Maduro literally suggested raising rabbits for meat, last year I think. Instead, Don Jr kept digging.
@Queen0fcups OK if I see more than one reply to the same tweet again, after raising the issue, there won't be any more replies from me.
@Queen0fcups A. What does it matter what they say? Trump gets shredded more than her. B. She is still hugely popular among conservatives. C. I define success wider than just elected office. Lots of money to be made doing other things.
@eb454 That's great to hear, Beth. I apologize for implying otherwise; Had only read one piece of yrs. Will correct this in thread &amp; link those pieces. 		Found these, are there others you'd suggest adding? Very impressed by your work, 		https://t.co/KeRJaYzqTQ 		https://t.co/XCaVWSiCdX
@CornetteDave @a_place_n_time Thank you Dave, that's very nice of you to say. I'm not always respectful when disagreeing,though LOL. It depends. As it happens, @a_place_n_time is a smart cookie who I have followed for a long time. Always excellent viewpoints and I appreciate them.
@Queen0fcups Plenty of people made fun of Obama, but bc they were conservatives, likely liberal voters discounted it. Conservatives needed to expose his substantive weaknesses instead. Some did but not enough of them.
@life_is_goodQ @JesseKellyDC I'm not counting pro or anti replies, but thank anyway, lol. It will probably work better next time if you say in your tweet that you're adding commentary iso challenging the arguments made, bc that's what people assume otherwise.
@Queen0fcups Actually the mockery didn't destroy her, it made her more popular with conservatives, which is the point Jesse Kelly made. If McCain hadn't been on her ticket she may well have become VP. Her success post 2008 is probably what it would have been without the mockery.
@Queen0fcups @JesseKellyDC I've replied to one of your other tweets. I'd like to reply to the various points you raise but it gets really cumbersome to do that when there are multiple replies to the same tweet, and they're not threaded. I end up looking like I was too cowardly to reply to each.
@Queen0fcups @JesseKellyDC We don't disagree per se, we just see different layers of this. Sure, mocking her is fun, and I'm not saying never do it, I'm saying look at the other opportunities, such as talking about the policy issues themselves.
@divnanata Thanks for the info, it adds weight to the theory that she is play-acting on purpose, like GWB did.
@jeauxy @JesseKellyDC Aw, thank you Joe! So nice.
@Queen0fcups @JesseKellyDC I guess you didn't read the part of the thread where I explain that she easily could be on a committee and vote to issue a subpoena, and that that's a more interesting angle to take than mocking her and taking it no further. https://t.co/VpJMFku45b
@Dumpling88 @JesseKellyDC I block people who imply that intellect is affected by race.
@lisaradio99 @a_place_n_time Aw, thank you. It works both ways, too. There are many American turns of phrase that seem much better to me than British commonwealth ways of saying things.
@GeorgeMasonBill What do you mean? She's a very clear communicator, with excellent foreign policy credentials and ability to work as part of team.
@ZoomZoomGal It's hard to sit back and say nothing, so instead I'm going to comment on her gaffes, but focus more on the teachable moment about why she gets it wrong, ie what originalist/textualist constitutional interpretation means, and that it's not literalism.
@ceasere It's supremely stupid, isn't it? POTUS or someone in his team should try to educate Don Jr about it. He regularly drags us into these unnecessary dramas. I liked it when he stopped tweeting for several months in 2017.
RT @fonzalito: This piece is a wake up callüëáüëá https://t.co/3eo9sor5Va
@lisaradio99 @a_place_n_time I sometimes pepper my points with a bit of ad hom, but it's never my main argument. The (paid) pundits who rely on it exclusively regarding AOC are lazy; they miss the opportunities to challenge Ds on the policy issues themselves. That's what I'm arguing for.
@voidzorro @JesseKellyDC Not true. You do mock her and you advocate for others to. But I digress. Glad you finally read the article before commenting on it.
@fonzalito @JesseKellyDC Thanks. Yes, IMO it's the broader embracing of the ideas, not her own career, that interest me most. She could progress to a committee chairmanship (after just two years, probably), even a minor caucus leadership role. The biggest threat is as a campaigner/cheerleader for others.

@life_is_goodQ @JesseKellyDC That isn't actually the argument made in the thread, or the column by @JesseKellyDC, but thanks for commenting.
@voidzorro @JesseKellyDC You greatly underestimate the ability of liberal voters to seek reality. You're essentially looking for every angle you can think of to justify mocking AOC, despite the detailed, compelling arguments made. Each to his own, I guess.

@voidzorro @JesseKellyDC A threat of her becoming President, or a threat of us unwittingly helping the Democrats? I discuss it in this thread: https://t.co/F3kKB4zLvV
(19) Please send me AOC-related articles and I'll offer up my thoughts as someone who, unlike the Congresswoman-elect, IS professionally qualified and experienced to speak about the machinery of government. 		I don't feed this troll, I offer facts for the about-to-be-redpilled.
(18) AOC's response to the comments didn't address the nub of the issue. She made the threat as a member of a body that can subpoena. If she is on a committee with purview, she CAN vote for a subpoena to be issued. If not, she CAN influence others to. 		She was caught red handed.
(17) Beth Baumann @eb454 gathered several responses to an AOC gaffe in this article. My takeaway from it is that too many conservative pundits are piling on with virtually identical comments that don't draw out the policy issues in her gaffes. 		https://t.co/8Xm6gKdE2f
(16) @Amber_Athey covers several recent gaffes in this article. Notice how the random liberal photographer mischaracterized textualism/originalism as literalism? Such misunderstandings are rife among liberals. That's an issue in itself. 		https://t.co/2Wn1Sf7i0C
(15) IMO this is a good article by Kevin McCullough @KMCRadio, but trying to convince AOC to change her ideology, even in middle age, is pointless. 		Many shift from socialist to conservative over time, but not someone like her. She has no need to. 	 	https://t.co/VUqyf4COuU
(14) Oh and the actual probability of AOC making it to the top doesn't matter. However far she goes, our reactions to her will affect how much power she has to increase Democrats' vote share. I say we should withdraw the troll food.
(13) In the remainder of this thread I will link and comment on articles about our options for undermining AOC's rise to the top. 		I'm asking you to consider all your options. Her gaffes do instinctively invite mockery, but I do that differently now, and more often in private.
(12) Redpilling works like this: Once one example causes enough doubt &amp; curiosity, the person secretly starts searching for info online. He or she is then open to hearing the other side of the story on multiple other incidents. 		You don't need to do a thing. Let the facts speak.
(11) There are SO MANY points of evidence that can redpill people. For me, the straw that broke the camel's back as a one-time Hillary supporter was her ludicrous &amp; offensive #SniperFire story. In which she implied the USSS &amp; USAF would ever fail to protect a FLOTUS &amp; first kid.
(10) I don't even need to talk about the growing evidence of #Spygate, part of the wider #Obamagate. The facts about all that are coming out, they speak for themselves, and the message will be even louder over coming months as Whitaker &amp; if confirmed, Barr, release the hounds.
(9) Mocking AOC isn't going to redpill one Democrat voter, I promise you. 		What redpills Democrat voters is the incontrovertible evidence that Ds use and abuse their voters and in indeed, despise them on a personal level. 		Like the evidence in 2016. And since.
(8) I don't need to mock AOC's stupidity in general or specifically regarding the Constitution and what we policy wonks call the "machinery of government." 		I don't need to prove my superior understanding of it to anyone. Nor do you. 		A high schooler can attain it in one day.
(7) In his column, @JesseKellyDC is saying take AOC's potential for gaining even more power, seriously. 		The fact that her continued success is unpleasant to think about made me not want to think about it. 		But that's how Obama won the presidency &amp; look where that got us. https://t.co/IqaWWDuSW7
(6) I didn't want to read @JesseKellyDC's piece but I'm glad I did. He writes a cautionary note, inviting us to think more critically about our assumptions and reactions about the seemingly dumb-as-a-rock AOC. 		He's NOT saying take her IDEAS seriously. 		https://t.co/YItBgK1MYm
(5) Obama is way more intelligent than AOC, but that doesn't matter. They were both placed on the executive recruitment program of the DNC, because they were marketable. Ds believe voters are stupid &amp; will believe whatever they're told. In too many cases, they're right about it.
(4) I've been called many things but low-IQ isn't one of them. Yet even with a hard-earned top of the class political science degree and years of experience working in politics, I was still sucked in by liberal lies. The lesson for me was that we must do our own due diligence.
(3) I was one of millions who were sucked in by Obama, twice, to my eternal regret. I finally woke up to who he is when I noticed him enabling the great DNC primary elections fraud of 2016. My permanent #WalkAway followed soon after. I became a conservative &amp; a Trump supporter.
(2) I've juxtaposed above photos of AOC having freshman group photos taken recently, and Obama rising to national prominence while campaigning for more senior Democrats in 2004. He had been "posing for" promotional photos for many years. https://t.co/2fAMxZoC0Y
(1) Thread: The many gaffes of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. 		Until now I've essentially ignored her, but some conservative opinion pieces have got me thinking. I agree with @JesseKellyDC that we can either pour fuel on the fire, or not. 		The pros and cons are discussed below. https://t.co/2yUemmqRQs

(32) In the US, paid vacation leave is minimal for low to mid level workers, &amp; the working week is long, for most. In NZ, everyone gets 4 weeks paid vacation leave &amp; the usual work week is 40 hours. Even we view the French system as supremely lazy and bureaucratic.
(31) France is a very socialist country, with many periods of civil unrest in its past. The level of over-regulation is off the charts. Productivity takes a back seat to the insatiable desire to give out free stuff, like 10 weeks vacation &amp; a 35-hour work week, for votes. Insane.
(30) Destroying the streets, monuments, museums, private property and tourism industry is not going to solve France's jobs problem. 		It makes armchair quarterbacks in other countries feel good for a while, though. 		France's fate was sealed a long time ago.
(29) #JobsNotMobs was and is a powerful slogan for use in the US because there is a clear choice in the ballot box between the two. 		In France, the mobs need to put down the molotov cocktails and rocks, in order to make the country great again, leading to good jobs.

(27) If I'm in a peaceful protest and it become abundantly clear that a violent minority (of various political stripes) is ruining it for everyone, then I WOULD GO HOME. And I'd wait for a better opportunity to start again later.
(26) The French govt has the legal right to use EU-flagged vehicles to help restore the rule of law. Yes, we all know the EU would like a federal army &amp; full-throttled globalism (socialism) but that isn't the main issue today. Preventing injury is.
(25) Some are obsessing about the EU flag on armored vehicles, which is a red herring. French voters elected people who brought them into the EU &amp; maintained a major role in it. The British are in a different situation: They unequivocally rejected the EU, peacefully &amp; lawfully.
(24) What matters more atm is stopping the violence. 		Many twitter accounts are celebrating, glorifying, encouraging the violence, while using blame, denial and minimization to exploit it for their own gain. 		It's not a "war," it's civil unrest.
(23) My issue with some of the commentary about the protest-riots is this. 		Yes, the movement includes mostly peaceful protesters, with a violent majority. 		No, it does not matter who put the rioters there or why: It ALWAYS happens in mass protests, esp. in France. 		And:

@JoeFree76 Why do vehicle markings matter so much? I hate the EU, too, but isn't it more important right now that the lawful French government has enough resources to restore the rule of law, and save lives? 		A peaceful march in one city, on one day, doesn't negate the rest.

@james65878144 Your understanding of history is incomplete. https://t.co/cXvcyGDRk8
(21) Obviously, I wholeheartedly support Trump in his policies and actions. I do not support every statement he makes in tweets, but that is fine. He is right about climate taxes and trade. He also is a firm supporter of police.
(20) I also support the ability of Americans to defend self &amp; and republic IF IT CAME TO THAT. I believe the *ability* to overthrow tyranny works, as a deterrent. At this time, federal, state &amp; local law enforcement have the capacity to keep the peace. Esp. federal, under Trump.
(19) Iran is totally different. For 39 years, Iranians have legitimately had NO way of expressing themselves politically or choosing their own government. I support innocent Iranians doing whatever they are willing to do in order to change that. 		The French can vote &amp; speak.
(18) I have no sympathy for people who insist on going into the streets of France to join a "protest" once its clear that violence is a part. So IDC if the terms of their arrest and detention are harsh. They CHOSE to go there. 		Without the rule of law, bystanders get hurt.
(17) Martial law sounds wrong, but it is right. There are many components a govt can include or not. Rioting is worse at night, so curfews are introduced. Large gatherings of people can be stopped before they start. 		If they had stayed peaceful, they'd have been left alone.
(16) If the French government has to declare martial* law, the left wing criticism in legacy and social media will go off the charts. But it shouldn't. I will explain what martial law involves. 		*It's fun to see people spelling it marshall law.
(15) People are going to fear yellow vests after this. The self interested &amp; usually left wing activists who exploit genuine grievances like this, never seem to think of the unintended consequences on everyone else. They don't care. Vive la revolution!
(14) Like I said, my support for the Yellow Vests is CONDITIONAL. No violence. 		I read today that French motorists are required to carry yellow vests in their cars, in case there is a crash and they need to move about safely. Using them for political purposes was foolish.
(13) Far from unconditionally *supporting* the Yellow Vests movement, we should now be standing WITH the French government as they try to restore the rule of law and protect the civil rights of everyone who is impacted by the violence and economic damage it entails.
(12) The Russian collusion narrative is so ridiculous that certain activists who carry weight among many Trump supporters have been able to lull people into a false sense of security about what the rogue regime (dictatorship) in Russia is actually doing.
(11) Putin is laughing his ass off right now. Not only has he been able to incite violence in France (always the first to surrender), he has exploited the gullibility &amp; stupidity of the American left, making it unfashionable on the American right to criticize him &amp; his tactics.
(10) IMO, Margaret Thatcher provides the best example in living memory of how to deal with violent and terrorist movements. She withstood the terrorism of the IRA in the UK,, and Argentina in the Falklands. 		She was like Churchill: #NeverSurrender #PeaceThroughStrength
(9) But Macron, like most of his forebears, is weak and will not order adequate law enforcement that would reduce injuries and the very real risk of deaths, including among police. Compare this to the great job done in Hamburg at the 2017 G20.
(8) Macron has contributed to the problem by not being tough enough with the rioting from the day it started. Even now, there are only something like 12 armored vehicles available in Paris. It's ridiculous. He has the means to quell the violence lawfully &amp; reasonably.
(7) If Macron were to resign, he will be replaced by another president just like him. At the next election, the French will either elect more of the same, or perhaps someone who appears to give them what they say they want, who will then make things even worse once in power.
(6) Much the same dynamic is occurring in Belgium and the Netherlands. The activist groups are trying to incite protests and then riots in the UK &amp; Europe, Canada, and probably Australia, too. 		Street violence is NOT the right way to make our countries great again.
(5) The media &amp; activist groups on the left &amp; right are trying to whip up hysteria &amp; panic to justify the violence. They are very anti-Police, which all conservatives should have a long, hard think about. 		The left have infiltrated groups on the right, to make us look bad.
(4) Protests &amp; riots in France are common, year in year out. I watched the French take to the streets to resist basic free market reforms in the 80s &amp; 90s, while my own country of NZ reformed &amp; became more competitive. It was hard but it works!
(3) I don't support the protests, bc they have passed from protests to riots. They are no longer "peaceful protests." which are the only kind I support, unless you're in a country like Iran at the moment. 		Yes, the French people have a legitimate grievance.
(2) It's evening in Paris, and I expect the worst of the violence to occur in the middle of the night. Then, I assume, they will do it all again on Sunday. 		Currently nearly 1,000 arrested, 50 injured... I am sure the injury numbers are under-reported. https://t.co/Y9YFQzUGbD

@WordsMeanThing1 That doesn't necessarily mean that Issa is a Trump supporter. It could mean anything, including the desire to get him out of Congress. I'd need to spend time researching it thoroughly and I'm not able to today.
@WordsMeanThing1 Comey will be forced to answer when he is standing in the dock. If it's done before then, it risks the success of the prosecution. All these House interviews are a risk to that process. The Congressmen are self-interested. Nunes is smart, he has stepped back.

RT @lydia3829: @GodlessNZ working in government always makes one cranky, I relate
(19) I am learning that patience is the key to success in politics, business, &amp; life. 		Trump &amp; co are showing extreme patience. I love the saying "revenge is a dish best served cold," 		I'm not into revenge per se, I'm into justice. 		Keep holding the line.
(18) I'm entitled to be cranky. If you were in my shoes, you would be too. 		The criminals that were running the DOJ before Trump came into office &amp; started upsetting the apple cart, have harmed an untold number of innocent people, many of them current &amp; former employees.
(17) I proudly self-identify as cranky, because of major stuff I am dealing with irl. Much of it is due to losing the lottery of healthy genes; I live with long term medical issues that robbed me of my successful career as a govt policy adviser. I worked my tail off for 25 years.
(16) It's not my job to spend time reassuring people, finding information for them, or repeating what has been P.R.A.T.T. - previously refuted a thousand times. 		People say I'm cranky these days, as if that's an insult. LOL. 		I'll tell you why I'm cranky.
(15) The people involved, such as Rosenstein, could not give a flying harmonica what armchair quarterbacks on Twitter are saying about it. Much of what I read here is embarrassingly childlike. People are way too emotionally invested in it. I don't know how they cope irl.
(14) We are going to find out the facts in due course. 		Speculating, or analyzing and asserting, about the DOJ cases is a hobby for me. 		There's nothing I can do before the big reveal(s), so taking an interest in the subject is merely entertainment, as opposed to action.
(13) In terms of speculation about what's "really" going on, I have heard it all. 		I get more committed every day, to sticking to what I can read in factual evidence, and applying the most rigorous logical analysis I can muster. 		None of us is perfect at this, but I do my best.
(12) Also, I draw your attention to the President's comment: "the scathing document written about Lyin' James Comey." 		There is a range of views about who is and is not a bad guy in all of this. Every combination of Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, Wray and others has appeared.
(11) So that's why I have not interpreted this tweet as an attack on RR. 		The President seems to imply that signing the application for the FISA warrant means RR is "totally conflicted." 		It doesn't. https://t.co/ZzXcSi4Fkl
(10) Our opponents assert that Trump lies all the time. Their mistake is to take literally and seriously what should not be taken literally and seriously. We who have supported Trump for years now, usually understand what I'm talking about here.
(9) President Trump asserts many things in his tweets, and some of them should not, I believe, be taken literally. There are tens of thousands of assertions to examine so I'm not going to spend time supporting my own assertion about it with evidence today.
(8) So the step of signing an app is limited to affirming the belief that the work of OTHERS has complied with DOJ policy, for example. That is all. 		I believe the President's assertion that RR was wrong to sign this app is not a serious one. I see it as tactical, political.
(7) Firstly, RR signed an application, not a warrant. 		Such apps are signed by a list of people working in dif roles in the DOJ &amp; FBI. 		If a Dep AG had to read every word in an app in order to affirm the belief that it is true, he or she would have no time for anything else.
(6) Back to the updates process used in Thread #1. 		I wish to address the "Rosenstein signed the FISA application" canard.
(5) Clearly when it comes to these so-called Trump supporters who hate Rosenstein and, by extension, me, I now live rent free in their heads. 		As I've always said, I'm happy to discuss evidence and my reasoning when asked in good faith. 		In other cases, you're not owed my time.
(4) Since "coming out" as a Rosenstein supporter, I've been treated to the same level of vile behavior that we get for coming out as Trump supporters. 		I knew it would happen, but I did it anyway. Not going to let mere words on a screen from the ill-informed get to me.
(3) Of course, my approach to discerning whether RR is on the side of America or not, rightly required a much deeper dive than that. I've spent hundreds of hours on this subject since Trump announced him as nominee for Dep AG. 		Dismissing me out of hand tells me about you.
(2) The above photo is from the late 1990s Ken Starr-led special counsel investigation into WJC. I'm nearly 50 years old &amp; remember that time in detail. 		RR is a very close friend of Justice Kavanaugh. 		That should be "all you need to know" about his integrity &amp; patriotism. https://t.co/nbvnAOaRQb

@AwbwFyf Exactly. And in almost all cases, the US is obligated to assist an ally bc of a treaty like NATO for example. In a situation like Ukraine, doing everything reasonable to assist them is a no-brainer. Unless you're a fool like Rand Paul that is. 		https://t.co/3ZFtfVGzZC
@Mich_Lis Thank you! I would love nothing more than to make the move one day. Americanism is an ideology that needs to be discovered and adopted by people around the world.
@KungPao19 He might be, he might not be, but the difference is that we will have 53 votes to start with. Also, committee membership decisions are key. We'll see what happens.
@LoversWin Yes, great video, thanks for the reminder about it. That was gold.
@AwbwFyf Rand Paul's views on foreign policy are despicable IMO. He'd have been like FDR, waiting it out, failing to prepare, letting key allies get pummeled for two years, then losing a couple of thousand sailors in a Pearl Harbor. Thank God there's only one of them in the GOP Senate.
@dan007mnr That's not just one thought there, for starters. I'm with Trump, Pompeo and Mattis on this. I wish all of the Senate GOP were, too.
@wbsandollar1 I don't see them as RINOs. Without the GOP, there is no President Trump, no MAGA agenda. I see ahead to the years after the Trump presidency, and I want the gains to stick. The movement and the need for improvements is bigger than one person.
(23) So yeah, I try very hard to be consistent across my tweets about individual GOP politicians &amp; the need to support them to keep out Democrats. I'm going to call them idiots when they are idiots, too. Hopefully the reasons for this will be clear.
(11) Marco Rubio has been great on many issues, like Cuba, and speaking up in the post-midterms Broward County mess. But now he wants to slam Saudi Arabia for "contributing" to the conflict in Yemen. Wake up, Little Marco. Read a book.
(10) Orrin Hatch is a great example of someone who has supported Trump on every vote that really matters, while still saying dumb stuff about tariffs. 		Susan Collins saved the Kavanaugh confirmation and infinitely more than that, in the bigger picture.
(9) One by one, they all end up like Bill Kristol and The Weekly Standard, wrecked upon the rocks. 		The world has changed. We're not going back. https://t.co/7lbW0TINn7
(8) The saying "rust never sleeps" is like the politicians who are always trying to resist the #MAGA agenda. Rather than having the courage, faith and frankly, intellect, to get on board and give Americans what they voted for, they wait for any opportunity to stick the knife in.
(7) It's a shame that "time served" is so prevalent in Congressional Committee assignment decisions. It's actually possible to change that, if someone ever finds the will. 		In NZ, the head of the majority party appoints chairmen on MERIT incl. policy positions, not time served.
(6) Are you counting the days till Flake and Corker are gone? I sure am. We really need a good Chairman for the Foreign Relations Committee. Someone who will SUPPORT the incredibly successful, historic #TrumpDoctrine of #PrincipledRealism. Not appeasement, or neoconservatism.
(5) I'd still vote for Lindsey Graham if I'm ever blessed enough to become a citizen in the great state of South Carolina. But he's 180 degrees wrong about MbS. 		I don't place him in the same category as he who shall not be named. Graham still has redeeming features.
(4) Today I heard Lindsey Graham call Crown Prince MbS of Saudi Arabia "crazy." He literally used that word. FFS. 		What an anti-American, pro-Iran, pro-perpetual war thing to say at this time. It's like he's learned nothing at all from Trump.
(3) My heart goes out to all the patriots who have to vote for people like Mitt Romney, in order to keep a Democrat out. Your situation sucks. 		As irritating as he's going to be in the Senate, he will vote for GOP-nominated judges, and that is EVERYTHING. Absolutely everything.
(2) A lot of folk don't always #VoteGOP, and they, are the reason we don't always win elections. You can divert blame all over the place if you want, to vote fraud and other places, but this fact is inescapable. Staying home ensures that a Democrat wins.
(1) I know it must seem confusing that I have waxed eloquent about Lindsey Graham one minute and denounced him the next, so I better explain why. Same goes for Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and some others. 		I believe in always #VoteGOP while criticizing issue by issue regardless.
The Senate GOP sponsors of the anti-KSA resolution (Graham, Rubio &amp; Paul) should be sent there on a student exchange trip to learn some critical thinking skills. It would be fun to see the look on their faces when telling them. https://t.co/0b4zv5H1cl

(38) Just to wrap up this thread. I really want to be able to report in depth on the people of Alaska's recovery from this earthquake, but it has proved "too close to the bone" for me. My lasting injury from 2011 was PTSD. It's better for me to watch hurricanes than earthquakes.
(8) My thread on the Anchorage earthquake when it was breaking news. I planned to do more but, after 5 hours, it brought up memories of what I went through in 2011; too close to the bone. A useful lesson for me: I can report on other disaster types. 		https://t.co/jPfqq707qH

(22) After Stearney was found, the SecDef &amp; POTUS would have been briefed. 		If you are doubting the honesty of the head of the Navy's report that foul play is not suspected, then you are also doubting Mattis &amp; Trump. That's fine, you're entitled to your opinion. I trust them.
(21) Some of you took up my invitation to read my Cmdr Price thread, &amp; if you read the detailed NYT article in it, you'll understand my viewpoint better. 		If you've only read this thread so far about VADM Stearney, then you may not realize my professional b/g re coroner reports.
@CovfefeSally @US5thFleet I agree with your approach of "whatever the reason," but I feel it is insulting to the VADM to imply he would do this if forced or asked to do something. I am sure he would not, &amp; would report it. Also, are you questioning the honesty of head of the Navy in Trump's admin?
(20) If there was a suicide, the means would likely be visible when found, and there may also be a note. If the Admiral knew this when he made his announcement, I'd expect the content and tone to be exactly as it was today. 		All these factors weighed together led to my opinion.
(19) We'll eventually find out what time he was found, which can be at least several hours before the announcement. When a group of sailors are lost at sea, the wait for next of kin notification can be long, but this is different.
(18) The other reasons for my suspicion of suicide here is that the announcement was made late at night local time in Bahrain, &amp; the content &amp; tone of the announcement. 		Someone in Stearney's position would not be missing for long before an aide went looking for him.
(17) Like Price, where does a high ranking military officer go with his or her doubts and fears? Yes, excellent services are made available and encouraged, but as explained in the NYT story about Price, many barriers stop them from reaching out. It's so hard to help them.
(16) Cardiac risk factors are family history, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, other drug use, extreme stress eg undiagnosed sleep apnoea, and a bunch of other less common causes. 		IMO it is more likely that Stearney had been battling hidden struggles like Job Price did.
(15) Sudden out-of-the-blue fatal cardiac arrest is very rare and is usually associated with family history. It mainly strikes teenagers, people under 40, etc. If a fit, well screened male has reached his 50s without it happening, he's getting towards being safe from it, IMO.
(14) Some of the reasons I suspect this was suicide and not natural causes eg heart attack: 		&gt;Both are possible so we need to consider relative probability 		&gt;His medical care &amp; screening would have been top notch 		&gt;If there was a CVD family history they prob would have said

@ljbruton LOL. I was there, arrogant fool.
(7) So I ignore conspiracy kooks on Twitter as much as I can, knowing our fleeting encounter isn't going to achieve much that is of use to them. 		I'd rather promote mental health awareness, esp. among active duty military &amp; veterans. Depression is a life threatening illness.
(6) Much like overcoming alcoholism, the conspiracy kook can only heal if they gain insight &amp; choose to seek help. Then there is a long process of months &amp; years where they can learn about the real world, &amp; how to avoid falling into the traps set by those who manipulate people.
(5) There'll be the usual ill-timed outbursts of conspiracy kooks, &amp; I treat them with the contempt they have earned. Conspiracists are unable to cope with the harsh reality &amp; tragedy of human nature, so they seek comfort in fictional tales. There is a cure, but it's hard work.
(4) It's *possible* that his death was natural causes but with the limited info currently available to me, this has all the hallmarks of suicide. Just bc someone is near the top of a distinguished military career, doesn't mean they aren't struggling on the inside. It's so sad.

@mikamckinnon Now granted, those two quakes were centered in completely different places but to the affected public on the day, that didn't matter. We will never again trust in the decreasing intensity of aftershocks, despite the extremely low probability of a repeat of 2011.
@mikamckinnon Love your thread, TY for this info. I'm sure you're aware of the Sept 2010 &amp; Feb 2011 quakes in Canterbury, NZ, which I happened to live through. In one of your tweets you didn't qualify your comment about decreasing aftershocks. I try to say "usually" bc we were all caught out.

OK it was Summer. https://t.co/BBHfBOc3ra
(35) OK, back to the immediate day to day needs in Alaska. 		This tweet gives you an example of the kind of unnecessary garbage that disaster-affected people have to put up with. 		EARTHQUAKES CANNOT BE PREDICTED. If they learn how, I'll let you know. 		https://t.co/XvjwvxHIRu
(34) There will be an acute shortage of housing both for those with wrecked homes, and all the workers needed to rebuild them. Rents will skyrocket, too. 		People will temporarily/permanently move out of the affected area, to elsewhere in AK, to Canada, &amp; to the rest of the USA.
(33) In the short term, many lose their jobs &amp; small businesses but, at a certain point, there's a job boom for the rebuild. The US already has a shortage of skilled workers, incl. those who build homes &amp; roads. Companies will cover all relocation costs, desperate for staff.
(32) Supporters of the port's development are prob. telling the naysayers "I told you so." In the 8 years since the first of the Christchurch NZ earthquakes, we've seen bureaucratic incompetence slow the rebuild &amp; recovery. A big challenge like this certainly sharpens the mind.
(31) ... (subject to ice in the Knik Arm, I admit), then Port McKenzie could enable people &amp; freight to move between Mat-Su and Anchorage. All this will be part of the technical assessments &amp; policy decisions being made rn. Ice you can't drive on may as well get broken up.
(30) The article cited above, about Port McKenzie, covered the challenges so far in developing this seaport &amp; proposed commuter ferry terminal. 		Earthquakes often shake up infrastructure funding plans in a serendipitous way. If this port gets repaired sooner than the highway...

@rickrempel Well aware, lol. I was referring (in minimal characters) to the fact that a nighttime earthquake is right royal PITA. I know, I've experienced them. At least these poor souls have a few hours of daylight to inspect damage and check on people.
@akstyna @RangerSyl @wbsandollar1 Yes, they really suck don't they. The aftershocks tend to decrease in strength over time, but that's no comfort while one is happening, I know.
@Mominthestix It's my pleasure, just trying to help from way down here in NZ. Glad the technology exists to allow me to.
RT @Mominthestix: @GodlessNZ Thanks for always sharing clear, pertinent information.  Much appreciated!
@alaskaiii They are. Unfortunately the aftershocks will go on for days then spread out to happen less often over weeks and months. It does get easier to bear.
@akstyna @RangerSyl @wbsandollar1 Yes, the liquefaction is going to be a shocker for them. Soggy, heavy, smelly wet sand everywhere.
@Seedsaver1 TY for the vid. they did exactly the right thing, #DropCoverHold. falling debris can kill. the higher up in the building, the more it shakes. sheltering in doorways is now outdated advice.
@akstyna @RangerSyl It could take a few days for the airport to fully re-open. Runway damage has to be assessed carefully. It will be top priority along with the seaport I'd say.

@loly_poly13 I am sure that will happen this time, too. But Alaskans have funded the federal help so are entitled to utilize it to the full. And specialized resources like engineers will need to be brought in for some time. It's also good training for responders from other states.

@addmuzak Yes, I was living there in 2010-2011. Got out afterwards.
(24) Once the needs &amp; resources become clearer, the orgs working on the ground will say specifically what help they need. 		https://t.co/2yZBHYl117 has lots of info on ways to help, eg registering to volunteer. 		Like in the rest of the US, Alaskans readily help each other.‚ù§Ô∏è
(23) I just remembered, beware the #SecondDisaster of unrequested donations of supplies like food, water &amp; clothing. They only worsen the job of first responders &amp; others trying to deal with the emergency early on. 		#CashIsKing so please donate to a trusted charity instead,
(22) Here's an example of what I'm talking about. USACE will have made plans for what to do in a case like this, including wintertime when snow and ice cover adds to the challenges. 		Helicopters, too are a godsend in the days &amp; weeks after a disaster.		https://t.co/PcuiN43DsE
(21) This part of AK is like parts of NZ bc there's only one road btwn cities/towns eg Anchorage &amp; the Mat-Su valley to the North. 		Supplies &amp; ppl will need land access restored ASAP so there will be Bailey Bridges, temp roads/tracks, &amp; even the use of sea ports to workaround. https://t.co/7Coljxjjzo
@akstyna I remember reading in 2008 about her son being born at the MatSu medical center so I remembered the name. Seems like a great area to live, beautiful like NZ. 		A good question about the roads TY. I'll share some thoughts on it in the thread.

@wbsandollar1 Thanks so much. Every disaster event is a chance to redpill a few more folk to get ready for whatever might happen where they live. The feeling that something good can come from the pain of others is a silver lining. 		#AlaskaQuake #AnchorageQuake #AKEQ 	 	https://t.co/hxtXlPmMgH
RT @wbsandollar1: @GodlessNZ Great thread from the voice of experience.	I learned a lot about earthquakes I did not know.	Thanks.
(20) A perfect response and initial statement from @AkGovBillWalker. Reassurance is key (sorry, I used to draft these for a living, I can't help myself.) 		The POTUS declaration will probably be signed &amp; announced today. It allows federal relief resources to augment the state's. https://t.co/pyg2IijHpc
(19) Alaskans old enough to remember the 1964 earthquake will be able to offer emotional support to others. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And it makes buildings safer, bc it's a wake-up call. 		1964 was terrible. 139 killed: https://t.co/WKRJhrCJus https://t.co/pw5FENWN9P
(18) The last time there was a sizable quake in Alaska (January 2018) I was super impressed by how good the local agencies were with their communications. It's so important. My live updates thread from the Kodiak EQ in Jan: https://t.co/6pV7nPMkas 		Today, from Anchorage PD: https://t.co/b6voKKVCzN
@akstyna Thanks, this info is very helpful. That's Palin country, right? Everyone affected by this quake is about to become acquainted with months of road closures and slow-downs, like we did in 2011. Fortunately, crews will be able to build temp roadways around the damage.
(17) The population of greater Anchorage is over 400,000 and a major disaster affects the rest of the state, too. Total pop. is around 800,000 now. 		In addition to help from the rest of the US, Canada, Japan &amp; prob Russia will offer help, too. Pacific Ring of Fire v all of us.
(16) EQ damage to homes, businesses, and public infrastructure (roads, bridges, airports, schools, hospitals), causes disruption for months &amp; years. It's freezing cold there rn, &amp; just weeks from Christmas. 		The lower 49 will send a lot of help, esp FEMA &amp; the military.
(15) The PAGER estimate is now upgraded from yellow to orange, not good. Fatalities are always the biggest concern but IMO the economic estimate can be a proxy for size of impacts from injuries, stress &amp; other disruption. This will hit AK hard. 		https://t.co/QeNPKoY3OG https://t.co/neyTzpOUtv
@akstyna Wow that is some damage. Thanks for the photo.
@grayified @Chase_AK @nickmon1112 Learn some basics about disaster response or STFU
@Chase_AK @grayified @nickmon1112 Chase what part of Anchorage are you in? I'm seeing major damage reports from Eagle Creek. I was in Christchurch NZ in 2011 when we had a big quake. Feel for ya.
My running thread of updates on the major #AnchorageEarthquake #EagleRiverEarthquake this morning. 		No reported deaths so far, lots of damage and frayed nerves. No #Tsunami threat beyond the state. https://t.co/jPfqq707qH
(14) Here's a video of road damage. It will alarm you but remember, for me this is nothing. Most cars on the road at the time are not near the big cracks that appear. If they fall in, most people survive. 		https://t.co/91NqGvJK0D
(13) The USGS website has a model called PAGER, which autogenerates *approximate* predictions of damage &amp; impacts. It had this quake at &gt;1 death as opposed to say 1-10, or 100-1,000, so I didn't panic. But I think there could be a few deaths. I'm sorry. Mother nature is cruel.
(12) Seeing photos and video now of major damage. You can hear the alarm in people's voices. I remember the same feeling, 8 years ago. 		The good news is that after this, you'll cope better with earthquakes. Most of us Kiwis do, and the Japanese. Just wanna give y'all some hope.
@SpicyNoodles2 @Chase_AK @nickmon1112 TY, that is proper EQ damage, not like the first pics I saw
(11) The probability of a larger EQ in the same area over the next yr is VERY small but it's exactly what happened to us in 2011. We lost 115 souls in a building collapse bc the initial engineering assessment was wrong. Should've closed after the first quake. Caution is prudent.
(10) As I suspected, places like Eagle River, closer to the epicenter than downtown Anchorage, will have serious damage. Population ?around 30k, still checking info. 		Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson is there, too. https://t.co/CueZEOmM4B
(9) Starting to see reports of significant damage in some places. Performing proper safety checks on buildings &amp; infrastructure will take time. Engineers will need to be flown in, too. 		https://t.co/fqzwwGMRXf
@KassSmiley @Nat_Herz @johnaronno Reaching out because I'm an earthquake survivor too (Christchurch, New Zealand, 2011). Welcome to the club you never wanted to join. There's a free 24/7 Disaster @Distressline in the US. More info: 		https://t.co/UgT3btqm5K
(8) The Alaska EQ Center is doing a great job. Best source of info atm. 		https://t.co/ymoBrMpWtT
(7) There is no tsunami risk from this EQ beyond Southern Alaska. 		The @NWS provides tsunami info and the @USGS provides EQ info. 		https://t.co/2f4xS1qAQT
(6) The reported magnitude of EQs is usually downgraded within an hour but this one was upgraded to a 7.0 (per the below tsunami warning.) 7.0 sounds bad but this was 25 miles deep. If it was 5 miles deep, this would be catastrophic. A lucky escape. 		https://t.co/8zoJltQ2iE https://t.co/fdMZQopb8s
(5) After a good shake like today's #AnchorageEarthquake you can expect #aftershocks. 		Most of the time they are smaller than the original quake. Reassure kids, and utilize the support resources available, incl this free 24/7 helpline: 		https://t.co/qjIapZZkuE
(4) If you feel an earthquake when you're on a beach or within a few miles of the coast, be aware of #tsunami risk. 		"If it's long or strong, get gone." There is no time for warning sirens or messages. 		If you don't feel it, that means any tsunami is hours away. You have time.
(3) Some photos from around Anchorage that I've seen on Twitter. In New Zealand we have an earthquake of this type about once or twice a year. It is scary, but thankfully little damage is done. 		#DropCoverHold is the best advice. More: https://t.co/6N4UL53tuw https://t.co/aEsCtMEmUR

@Kernzell @cvpayne Cohen who? The guy is irrelevant and the President's response was on-point... Cohen is weak and not very smart, as shown by his actions throughout all this. How dare he try to undo the votes of millions of Americans by attacking the duly elected President. I'm sick of it.
@RealDKintzele @Kernzell @grey_ghost47 @cvpayne Actually @Kernzell I'm pleased POTUS cancelled his Putin meeting at the G20, since 3 Ukrainian Naval personnel are injured and a couple of dozen are imprisoned, and essentially the country is now ready for a potential ground invasion.
Well said, @drawandstrike. For Jeff Flake to be holding JUDICIAL nominees hostage at this time after the nation was dragged through the Kavanaugh saga is just... unconscionable.

@u2fergus @IndiaMaria2020 @POTUS So true, Kellie! Every time I see a major investigation/prosecution go public, it took at least 2 yrs of secret work, eg the Deutsche Bank raids overnight.

@IndiaMaria2020 @POTUS OK thanks, wow. I wish @POTUS would NOT retweet people like this, it's unnecessary. I guess he thinks he can reach large numbers of his base who are on Twitter, IDK. The tactics that worked in 2016 aren't the ones that will work now.
@Kiradiju Hi, I haven't delved deeply into that side in recent weeks so I don't know, sorry. My impression from photos is that after the main group paused in Mexico City, many dropped off &amp; the ones who showed up instantly in TJ are from around the border area. A pool of millions.

(21) It's outrageous that Mexico has allowed this encampment so close to the San Ysidro Port of Entry. A direct security threat to the US personnel guarding the border, and to the US itself. It's also outrageous that they allowed the dangerous conditions inside the encampment.
(20) The line waiting to ENTER the already overcrowded camp in Tijuana yesterday. 		Allowing more people into this camp is insane. It's a field designed for 1,000 baseball spectators &amp; it currently has 6,000 people "camping" with few facilities. 		Shame on Mexico. https://t.co/nLQJyzkmhf

(17) 35 toilets are provided for over 6,000 people (and some of the toilets are only accessible across large puddles of water outflow from the makeshift showers.)

@bobby_dread Of course. But I don't vote on gender, I vote on merit. I like her, it's just sad that states like MS and AL don't nurture and promote better candidates in the pipeline. I think they take it for granted. Losing AL did a lot of harm to the MAGA agenda.

@TurntableKittah Good point! Thank you.
@909946zill LOL. Bye.
@909946zill You've missed my point. Of course these are interesting times in general, but there is no grand conspiracy to hold exercises at military installations etc etc. Given the size of the USA, there are bound to be events like this every day. It's no great mystery.
@TurntableKittah Sorry, can you explain what you mean by "keep their pride" thanks
@909946zill It's not an "interesting time," it's just another day in a country of over 330 million people.
(8) Personally, I want to see hospitals secured like airports are. Hospitals attract people people who are crazy and/or angry. There is a lot of anger directed at health providers, because medicine isn't perfect. Receiving bad news can make someone flip out.
(7) Users of healthcare facilities need to become more situationally aware. These sites are high risk for active shooters &amp; other violence. Any place where people gather is at risk, but especially a place where stressful conversations are had, &amp; people with mental illness attend.
(6) "Shelter in place" is the usual advice but I prefer "secure in place" bc it allows for more than just hiding, if possible. 		Too many people STILL do not know what to do in an emergency. 		For that reason, I think it's a good thing that a bunch of people were upset by this.
(5) "What training?" you say. 		D'uh, get training on situational awareness &amp; response to COMMON threats like active shooters. Military personnel get this training early &amp; often. 		Look at all the resources listed on this page: 		https://t.co/82H6mBUoVg
(4) OF COURSE those in charge of the exercise did not tell anyone it was a drill. It wouldn't work, then, would it? 		When there are reports of an active shooter ANYWHERE, don't waste your energy trying to figure out if it's a drill or not. Just follow your training &amp; wait. https://t.co/KTSPiRQDrr
(3) Seriously, Jennifer Griffin, the wounded vets at Walter Reed do not expect an apology for a routine preparedness drill intended to save their lives if there is a real security threat onsite in the future. 		The same goes for all military &amp; families there.
(2) Civilian reporters are falling over themselves in disgust at this exercise and the 60 or so minutes it took for the all clear to be given. https://t.co/FecjqpK3DB
(1) Thread: The active shooter exercise at Walter Reed Medical Center today. 		It was NOT a "false alarm." It was a planned exercise. Everyone who took the proper precautions did the right thing. https://t.co/fjOC4mzmDR
@adamlongoTV @wusa9 OTOH, you could view it as a useful preparation exercise. If it wakes people up to the need to be ready to act, that's a good thing IMO.

(3) Americans &amp; her allies made massive sacrifices to win WWI, WWII, &amp; the first stage of the Cold War (1945-1991.) 		We've been fighting the second stage of the Cold War since 1991. 		In that year we welcomed the many former Soviet republics into the community of nations.
(2) That's the main US/European rationale for being allies with Ukraine but, at its heart, this now 5-year conflict is about human rights. 		Not UN-style human rights, which is merely a buzzword term selectively applied to suit it's socialist agenda. 		Actual human rights.

@drawandstrike All this talk of the cabal/deep state doing this misses the mark. Humans have ALWAYS been militarily aggressive when they think it will help their interests. This was just a matter of time, regardless of "the cabal." 		The Western Alliance will succeed, as it always does.
@heywood3 @SilenceDogood57 @drawandstrike @CatGardino IMO, the current US campaign of maximum pressure on Mexico over this issue will succeed in achieving just that. MX has the beginnings of a Southern wall... hopefully in the coming years it gets beefed up and actually works.

(4) A fun little thread on Ivanka Trump, liberal hypocrisy, and the #Thanksgiving Turkey. 		https://t.co/re7Reh5xge
(14) And as such, I can't hate Ivanka for siding for a day with those who pretend their food doesn't involve killing cute animals. We all know kids are usually fickle in their views. (Protip: Don't ever let them vote!) 		She's one of Trump's secret weapons. I like that. 		END https://t.co/g62BgmMpqf
(13) Trump, the GOP, &amp; indeed America itself need someone like Ivanka to boldly go where most others fear to tread, into the meeting rooms and offices of the US Capitol complex, to sweetly &amp; smartly tell the haters &amp; losers what's best for them. https://t.co/YsVmyAe487
(12) So I think Ivanka is not just the Trump administration's Ambassador to liberals, she's the US Ambassador to liberals. 		They've become so out of touch with what @KurtSchlichter rightly deemed #MilitantNormals, (buy the book) they might as well be a foreign country. #caring
(11) Whether she promoted a liberal food trope wittingly or not, I guarantee you that conservatives reading it eyerolled &amp; blurted out something about liberal families' poor chance of survival without urban utilities, while (some of us) are happy to hunt &amp; gut things.üòâ
(10) So, back to Ivanka. I bet her kids did say words to the effect of "I don't want to see the siblings of Peas and Carrots sliced up on my Thanksgiving dinner plate." 		If she were a strong conservative like Don Jr &amp; Eric, she wouldn't have advertised this domestic vignette.
(9) Childhood obesity can only be tackled by changing the hearts and minds of parents, who often take the easy way out instead of spending time with their children, pushing them outside to play, and benevolently manipulating their little minds to prefer healthy food.
(8) Children's food decisions must be allowed to be made by their parents, not the school, let alone the unelected spouse of the head of the federal government. 		That the Obamas failed to appreciate the effect this small decision would have on voters, tells you a lot about them.
(7) It's just common sense that people in glasshouses shouldn't throw stones. I don't give a flying harmonica what weight Mrs Obama is. I'm j/s, her school lunch moralizing revealed some of that liberal hypocrisy we so often see on every political issue of importance to America.
(6) As an ex-liberal myself, I now see a lot of hypocrisy among liberals, and much less of it among conservatives. 		One of the best examples is Michelle Obama interfering in the nation's school lunch decisions, which must be made at a local level. She then gained weight herself.
(5) Nothing wrong with a vegetarian thanksgiving, either. In my experience it's pretty common these days for a kid to want to be vegetarian. It might be a phase, or it might be lifelong. 		Mocking veganism, esp where it's hypocritical, is a fun pastime for many on the right wing.
(4) Vegetarianism is a lifestyle choice made for a range of reasons, not just feeling icky about finding out where our food comes from. If you want to go down that path, veganism is better... and if you want your young kids to be vegan, you better learn a lot about nutrition.
(3) "After watching their Grandpa pardon ‚ÄúPeas‚Äù and ‚ÄúCarrots‚Äù at the White House on Tuesday, Joseph and Arabella have sworn off turkey and are insisting on a vegetarian Thanksgiving!" 		My red state mind didn't read this in the way the blue state mind would.
(2) The caption to the above photo of Ivanka's family with the WH Thanksgiving Turkey could be read as just a cutesy statement, and nothing more. 		But it got me thinking about the differences between the sterotypical red state and blue state "mind."
(1) What is Ivanka Trump's role in this administration? 		She's the US Ambassador to Congressional Democrats (and the ever-decreasing Congressional Never Trump caucus.)  		Because these groups are out of touch with the USA in 2018. 		https://t.co/ENGr7zH4Si
@TurntableKittah Liberal CA has, but there's at least 5 million GOP voters in CA, plus all the others who will prob. vote GOP in future. I don't write off the whole state, that's un-American. They are US citizens &amp; if the state tries to secede, the law requires the US to keep them in the union.

@Smargypants He's a musician in the band on the steps. But yes, armed secret service and marines are everywhere at the WH complex, which is a good thing.
@TurntableKittah It could be, IDK yet. At the start, I thought the caravans might head to TX, being closer, but they seem dumb enough to think they have better chances to cross over in CA. I do not think veterans will be needed. Civilian action would be counterproductive IMO.
@crazycatkid I agree with those points. 		They are applying to enter legally, by saying the magic words they are given to seek asylum. It's just that they will have to wait in a squalid camp, just to be turned away in the end. 		Finally, the US has said enough. It's a great time.
(8) In recent days, the US has been backing the Mexican govt into a corner of their own making, by insisting that MX deal with its caravan-appeasing problem. Anyone who thinks they can "wait out" the Trump-led GOP on this issue is sorely mistaken. Actions speak louder than words. https://t.co/fp5Z7NGqbd
(7) US aid to Latin America is not a waste of taxpayer money. It is in America's interests to carry out a range of activities in the hemisphere, for more reasons than I will explain here. It is also a carrot the US can threaten to take away, avoiding the need to use a stick.
(6) Since Oct 11, while all this has been going on, the US military have been generously aiding Central &amp; South American countries with visits by the USNS Comfort, replete with hundreds of medical staff, operating theaters, and so on. 		Story: https://t.co/4wSsUGwDao https://t.co/jv4neBWzPC
(5) Every time I see a photo of caravaners that is designed to garner sympathy, I just think of the other 9,200,000 Hondurans (for example) who have at least as much need to "flee poverty &amp; violence" but had more sense than to drag their babies &amp; kids through all this. https://t.co/6TGNTOPiMK
(4) Tijuana's socialists cd temp. house caravaners, protecting them from violence &amp; infectious disease in the squalid "campsites." They won't, bc socialists are usually selfish &amp; hypocritical, they want to storm the border &amp; garner sympathy through photos. 		All doomed to fail. https://t.co/XY5tShkFIV
(3) I've seen liberal MSM reporters refer to Tijuana as a "town." The population is &gt;1.2 million. 		If 10k caravaners are there, that's a ratio of 1:120. There's bound to be a few open borders fans among the locals. They could billet people in their homes, but no.

(23) Substance abuse disorders are so common that all of us will know someone who has/had one. When a loved one dies from their illness, there is a lot of (unwarranted) shame, guilt &amp; blame thrown around. 		The family of Michael Hastings don't believe he was murdered.
(22) Of course I accept that *some* sudden deaths are politically motivated hit jobs. 		It's just that whether a case belongs in that very small group depends on the evidence/facts of the case, &amp; if those are insufficient, my default is a benign cause, unless new info arises.
(21) For the more innocent believers, the conspiracy theory gives them a feeling of comfort, of special knowledge. A lot of them couldn't cope with accepting the reality that the world really is a dangerous, uncertain, unfair place. Substance abuse can lead to tragedy.
(20) "What harm does it do to question things?" 		This is a strawman assertion (see: logical fallacies.) 		They're not merely questioning things. They have lined up behind a "theory" or set of beliefs about a situation, with an agenda they want to see happen.
(19) If it were possible to ensure I never see on my laptop any sources that are anti-American, anti-freedom &amp; anti- the rule of law, I'd have very few information sources left. 		#PrincipledRealism is the foreign policy #TrumpDoctrine. It works in every area of life, too.
(18) While my support for the GOP &amp; similar parties outside the USA is a binary, non-negotiable thing, my assessment of information sources is not. The facts of a case can be reported through a media outlet that is anti-American, anti-freedom &amp; anti- the rule of law. OK with me.
(17) I consider the NYMag in 2018 a highly dubious source. However, for longer than I can remember, I have tried to assess MSM articles on a case by case basis. 		Dismissing everything written in the liberal media obstructs my work to address conspiracy theories.
(16) I predict that those who feel Hastings was murdered for political reasons will attack my reliance on a NYMag article, &amp; the really reckless among them will even comment on the ethnicity of some in the media industry. Which gets an instablock from me.
(15) The 7-page 2013 article at the start of my thread is very detailed. Unusually, the journalist has done a thorough investigation. The number of such articles has dwindled to a trickle in 2018. Which encourages amateur conspiratorial "thinking."
(14) In the real world, judicial officers like coroners have to use time-honored methods &amp; principles, so I try to use them too. Coroners don't think like conspiracy theorists do. 		I can tell, right away, when I'm reading or hearing a conspiracy theorist.
(13) My previous govt jobs sometimes required me to read coroner's reports on homicide, suicide, road traffic accidents, &amp; so on. Thinking about how coroners assess evidence &amp; use judicial principles to determine cause of death taught me a lot about these kinds of cases.
(12) Recently, while reading the tweets of an interlocutor I came across his or her claims about the death of Michael Hastings after the car he was driving hit a tree in LA. I've written about cases of celeb/public figure sudden death dozens of times on Twitter...
(11) I'm talking about the hard core "Q" believers here. The ones whose comments are duplicitous, ignorant, &amp; rude in an interpersonal sense. 		You're free to be rude &amp; disrespectful to me here if you want. I'm free to enforce boundaries of my choosing.
(10) Which brings me to all this "Q" nonsense. A (very) small number of Twitter a/cs by people I have conversed with by DM, some for years, are open to "Q" being at least a benign phenomenon, potentially raising awareness among some groups among the public. Fine. I let that go.
(9) Crucially, I don't believe all the conspiracy-believing folk who *say* they support the GOP President ARE on our side. There's strong evidence that many of the peddlers of it are NOT on our side. Trying to determine the genuineness of every Twitter a/c I see wd take forever.
(8) Therefore, I enjoy seeing gullibility among Democrats &amp; their: voters, foreign friends, &amp; PR arm, the MSM. 		I believe those at the top KNOW they're lying, &amp; they laugh at the gullibility of their voters. 		But I don't enjoy seeing conspiracy theorist gullibility on our side.
(7) I consider myself a Republican first, a conservative second, &amp; everything else after that. IMO the only way to stop the slide towards violent communism-fascism is to support the largest conservative-leaning party. In NZ, I vote National now. I'd #VoteGOP in the US.
(6) There are conspiracy theorists on the left &amp; right (or *however* you want to describe the political spectrum or scene; getting unduly hung up on semantics is one of the most effective to waste the time of yourself &amp; others.) 		No political party has a monopoly on gullibility.
(5) Throughout 2016 &amp; 2017 I considered the merits of many conspiracy theories. My self-directed education process changed my understanding of world history, particularly concerning the causes, events, &amp; effects of WWI &amp; WWII. These are of critical relevance to politics today.
(4) My newly freed mind wandered onto examining the Christian faith in which I had been raised but, oddly, not the liberal politics that went with it. That came in 2016, when my disgust at the DNC for nominating the worst presidential candidate in modern history caused #WalkAway.
(3) Medical issues forced me to retire far younger than I wanted to. I LOVED my job analyzing policy options, advising decision makers (Cabinet members), &amp; drafting PR talking points. Still, I gained "intellectual freedom" to study &amp; say whatever I want.
(2) I've spent most of my life (48yrs) thinking about how people can determine what is real &amp; what is not. In college I learned how to write in a "scholarly way," then learned on-the-job how to write credible policy reports 4 politicians, then retired &amp; did "self-directed study."

@ZeroBolusZero @wokepompeo @ScottAdamsSays That's irrelevant to my point about confirmation bias. I'm not interested in the other points made in Martin's tweet, bc his confirmation bias destroys their credibility. Have you looked up the term? It's quite relevant to discussions about "Q."
@Nega_sc0tt @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest Sorry, I'm not seeing how this relates to my point about building "weathertightness," Possibly bc it's a NZ term and may be unfamiliar in other countries.

@ZeroBolusZero @wokepompeo @ScottAdamsSays My tweet only dealt with one of Martin's claims, essentially that Trump has confirmed Q multiple times, therefore Q posts definitely reflect Trump speaking to the public. Which is of course, utter nonsense. Martin should look up the term "confirmation bias."

@MultaniSaint @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest Both land and building cost are factors almost everywhere. Why not try to reduce both as much as possible? 		As to land value, those who are able to relocate to lower cost areas, should. IMO.
@TriggeredNormie @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest It's *possible* to design a concrete construction method that minimizes cost compared to brick work. Other materials are usually less structurally sound, durable, firesafe etc. Seismic strength is also costly regardless of construction method.
@nileshkoul @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest Builders are incentivized to book up their time on customized expensive non-starter homes. Some form of market intervention is needed to ensure labor supply for affordable homes, given the lower profit for the builder. Modular homes reduce the skill level needed, too.
@JimGirouard132 @neanderthalnavl @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest Making them single story would reduce the structural load, saving money. Modern homes must be weathertight, seismically strong, &amp; insulated, &amp; few buyers would settle for one bathroom. This all adds cost, but it is doable IMO.
@R439878 @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest Manufacturers have preferred to adapt slowly to such product lines because many attempts have failed eg on fire safety, weathertightness, health &amp; safety of occupants over time.

@TricksterDoesIt @Nega_sc0tt @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest Making home construction lower-skill through prefabrication of components would almost completely solve the problem of the labor shortage.
@Nega_sc0tt @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest Huge problem with weathertightness in non-desert conditions. NZ's economy has almost been brought to it's knees in the last 30 years because we copied US desert building techniques without adapting them to our rainy climate.
@TMichaelMcClur3 @ScottAdamsSays @BlightAuthority @pulte @elonmusk @kanyewest Plastic is good for cladding but there are cheaper, easier &amp; safer ways to insulate &amp; build for structural strength. Fire risk is an issue; costly to mitigate.

@AngelakBlessing @Headsnipe011 @almostjingo @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 Life is a lottery.

It's not about wanting the job. Private charities can help a lot.

@NP_Pubs Saul and I have different thoughts and we don't speak for each other. My angle was to try to explore the free markets issue. If someone can't afford the rent, they have options. It's not an issue for public policy.
@NP_Pubs Libs are never going to quit mucking it up.
@NP_Pubs I don't consider it a mistake to add other ideas, it is just hard to follow when things aren't expressed clearly or sequentially. Anyway, good discussion, all the best.
@NP_Pubs Which tweet was this in reply to?
@NP_Pubs It would help if you replied to each tweet one at a time, so people can follow the discussion. Were you answering a question in my last tweet to you?
@AngelakBlessing @Headsnipe011 @almostjingo @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 No I meant what solutions do you propose to address "The STATE usurped the "family" role and has failed shamefully!" 		The issue of aging out programs was covered in the press release linked at the start.
@NP_Pubs Actually that program is normal for this Republican administration, but anyway, whatever. The key thing is that you didn't state what argument you were making, which is fine, but it's hard to have a discussion without that. Take care.
@NP_Pubs @Debradelai @cspanjunkie1 @Headsnipe011 @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @almostjingo @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 Fair enough.

@IittleDicktator @Robertchef77 @drawandstrike LOL
Great way to compare the cost of living. 		To feed 10 people at a Thanksgiving dinner in NZ today, I estimate you'd have to work at the average NZ wage for about 8-12 hours. 		Most New Zealanders don't know how much better life is in the USA. Brainwashed to hate the place. Fools. https://t.co/X1SS2jZxSE
@Robertchef77 @drawandstrike That's the opposite of the point made in my tweet. I argue that Roberts could, in fact, be doing this in order to make the planned prosecutions of those on the dark side more likely to succeed. If so, I salute him.
@Debradelai @NP_Pubs @cspanjunkie1 @Headsnipe011 @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @almostjingo @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 Exactly. "Affordable housing" is not a natural right &amp; it certainly isn't a legally enforceable right in the US. A country built on the foundation of individual freedom to choose where to live &amp; work (in most circumstances.) And where housing demand drops, prices follow.
@NP_Pubs @cspanjunkie1 @Headsnipe011 @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @almostjingo @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 I support free markets. If an individual or couple have the ability to get good jobs in a location with lower living costs, and there aren't crucial reasons to stay, such as elderly parents, shared custody of kids etc, then they could consider relocating. I did.

@NP_Pubs Please state your argument. So far it seems to be that homelessness is a problem in large cities. Are you blaming capitalism for that?

@NP_Pubs @cspanjunkie1 @Headsnipe011 @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @almostjingo @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 Yes, it is too much to cover in 280 characters.

@cspanjunkie1 @Headsnipe011 @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @almostjingo @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 I'd call a taxpayer return on investment of &gt;$6 for every $1 spent on this program an excellent way to help those lawfully in the US to have affordable housing.
@AngelakBlessing @Headsnipe011 @almostjingo @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 They are getting that.

@djrpok @Headsnipe011 @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @almostjingo @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 Trump &amp; his admin have stated repeatedly that the safety of young kids caught up in human trafficking is paramount. Most Americans would rather such kids were not sent back with an adult willing to have them live on the street. That policy is settled. The kids are rescued.
@djrpok @Headsnipe011 @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @almostjingo @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 Accordingly, it has ZERO to do with illegal immigration. It wouldn't matter whether the recipients of the financial aid were lawfully in the country or not, bc the biggest beneficiary of the policy is the taxpayer. Young kids don't choose to be trafficked across a border, either.
@djrpok @Headsnipe011 @MAGAREX1 @drawandstrike @HNIJohnMiller @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @Debradelai @almostjingo @tracybeanz @TheChiIIum @hfinch63 Your approach to this policy issue is completely back to front.

I was relying on the principle that goes back centuries that a court can make its own rules, from English law then out to the US, NZ &amp; others. Specific US laws can &amp; do regulate that, though.
@TownFloozie Thanks xx
@Elaines2cents @Debradelai I agree. I think both of us fell victim to space restrictions on a complex subject. All good, though. I've developed my ideas further as a result.
For me, that's the key issue here. 		Absolutely EVERYONE knows that some judges are grotesquely political in their rulings &amp; public comments, &amp; that it's not OK. 		I can only assume Roberts is distancing himself from POTUS, ahead of major political corruption cases. #TickyTocky https://t.co/aqAQWdBqHx
Rhodes' record aside, I think the most telling phrase here is "the always disturbing slogan" of America First. 		He &amp; other Obama officials genuinely hate the idea of placing one's own country first in all policy and economic considerations. 		Thank God they're gone. #MAGA https://t.co/3KpioV0MAU
Khashoggi's temporary residency status turns out to be sufficient to call him a US resident, which is more than just having a work visa. 		Anyway, I don't see why CIS couldn't just have released the info on Day 1. Would have saved a lot of column inches on the subject. https://t.co/fsRlOdqRNL
While a nonpartisan DA in a county that isn't deep blue would've decided differently, lets not forget that even a misdemeanor charge could result in a conviction, which is what matters.

The AG has been issuing guidance for the DOJ, which has teeth there. The WH won the "travel ban" cases. This one is the same.

(35) When you vigorously contest Iran and their many friends around the world and inside the US, it's going to get tough. Too bad. 		My trust in this President &amp; his administration to stand up for America &amp; peace-loving allies gets stronger every day. #Thankful 		#MAGAüá∫üá∏ 		END
(34) "in a very dangerous world [the USA will continue]: 	&gt;pursuing its national interests and 	&gt;vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm." 		"Vigorously contesting" is a great descriptor for what Trump is doing re countries like Iran. 		We CAN fight back &amp; we are.
(33) We're almost at the end of this thread. 		"As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!"
(32) Energy security is economic security, and that is national security, ie saving lives at home and everywhere else. 		If the US abandons KSA over ONE murder case (ignoring the millions caused by Iran), your gas prices will SKYROCKET. 		Facts don't care about your feelings.
(31) Leftists, the phone on which you are reading this tweet is MADE FROM OIL. 		No oil, no modern world. No 2,000 different product types that rely on oil. No medical products to save your life. No job when the economy tanks for generations. 		#Read and #Think.
(30) "They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels ‚Äì so important for the world." 		BUT BUT this is just about oil profits! #KeepItInTheGround and other inane slogans...
(29) And if you focus on where he was when he said that, you're a fool. It's utterly irrelevant. 		I am trying to outline for y'all the key aspects of the #TrumpDoctrine in foreign policy. 		HE places #AmericaFirst when considering national security. Period.
(28) That's his number one Constitutional duty, as expressed in the Presidential oath of office. Just because predecessors placed politics ahead of the duty to protect the USA doesn't mean this one has to do the same. 		#PrincipledRealism #TrumpDoctrine #PeaceThroughStrength https://t.co/8CkEpXPDv0
(27) Referring to the Senators, "I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America." 		Trump has ALWAYS been open to considering opposing points of view, and ALWAYS chooses national security.
(26) Every war in human history has included acts of gross injustice affecting smaller numbers of people than the millions who stood to lose everything if the war itself was lost. 		In this statement, Trump denounces the murder &amp; makes the case for regaining proper perspective.
(25) The global war on terror never went away (thank God!). 		A huge portion of American voters allowed the war to go on the back burner for a years because they found it icky. 		Thankfully, a larger portion of voters remembered just in time that there's a war on.
(24) A goal like fully eliminating terrorism everywhere is aspirational. 		Promoting aspirational goals is core business for Presidents. They have all done it. 		This one is a bit more achievable than hope and change. 		#HopeIsNotAPlan #WakeUp #WalkAway
(23) "It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!" 		Of course he knows it can never be fully eliminated. That take misses the point. 		This goal is crucial for the USA. Those who ignore it are dangerous, self-interested fools.
(22) I have drafted countless statements for politicians over the years. They like to say they WILL do something, as much as possible. When they say they INTEND to do something, they are leaving room to adjust IF new info arises. 		He said several times that it could. Reality.
(21) "[KSA has] been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. 		[USA] intends to remain a steadfast partner of [KSA] to ensure the interests of: 	&gt;our country 	&gt;Israel 	&gt;and all other partners in the region." 		Key word: Intends. He's not writing them a blank check.
(20) This statement is NOT about Donald Trump's relationship with Mohammed bin Salman. 		It is about the USA's relationship with the KSA. 		In this White House, the real work of government is seldom reported on by the MSM. That's why the public so easily falls for the MSM facade. https://t.co/3RebiNf03A
(19) The US relationship is with the KSA, not the King, or the CP. 		A country's relationship should always be with the country, not individual leaders. Under President Trump, this is the case, despite appearances. 		The MSM ignore the official stuff in favor of tabloid nonsense.
(18) "but it could very well be that [MBS] had knowledge of this tragic event ‚Äì maybe he did &amp; maybe he didn‚Äôt!		That being said, we may never know all of the facts... 		In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." 		Absolutely crucial last point there.
(17) "Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information" 		but the MSM narrative is that POTUS doesn't believe them. Actually he does believe them since he took over, on Russian interference, and everything else. 		He comments on what is known, as it is known.
(16) Any MSM story that does NOT acknowledge the President's condemnation of the murder should be discounted. The same ppl writing such stories ignore the Muslim Brotherhood &amp; everyone in it, or linked to it, who are involved in American politics. 		That says a lot, doesn't it?
(15) "Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an ‚Äúenemy of the state‚Äù &amp; a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that ‚Äì this is an unacceptable and horrible crime." 		He's making clear that JK's actions DO NOT justify murder.
(14) Wording matters. The MSM ignore all of this paragraph. 		"does NOT condone" 		"against those ALREADY KNOWN" = will do the same if others are KNOWN to have been involved. 		He uses the word know/known 3 times in just this para. #DueProcess #BelieveEvidence #NotAllegations https://t.co/U4uIZxGjHq
(13) Admitting what basic economics tells us, enables us to understand why POTUS is right to make these points. 		No money, no military defense, no coalitions against aggressors, no life saving humanitarian aid, no way to keep taking the highest no. of refugees in the world. https://t.co/DQAuuYehZo
(12) Now, about the money. 		The USA needs to increase its wealth IN ORDER TO keep its people (and others) safer, and that necessarily includes providing humanitarian aid to the victims of aggressors like Iran. 		The USA can't afford to stop saving lives in this way.
(11) FACT: "Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism." 		MSM: Crickets
(10) "Likewise, the Iranians have killed: 	&gt;many Americans 	&gt;and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. 		Iran states openly, and with great force, ‚ÄúDeath to America!‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeath to Israel!‚Äù 		Iran is considered ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs leading sponsor of terror.‚Äù 		MSM: Crickets.
(9) "... 	&gt;propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), 	&gt;and much more. 		FOUR examples (and much more) of FAR WORSE ATROCITIES committed by Iran, against whom the relationship with Saudi Arabia is absolutely essential. 		Got it?
(8) "The country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for: 	&gt;a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen 	&gt;trying to destabilize Iraq‚Äôs fragile attempt at democracy 	&gt;supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon...
(7) Key takeaways from today's statement on the KSA: 		"The world is a very dangerous place!" 		This first line drags us back to the reality that: 	&gt;Yes, people get murdered &amp; it's terrible. 	&gt;The whole world IS a very dangerous place, so we must make excellent decisions.
(6) Do I dislike the stance that Senators Graham and Paul have taken? Yes. 		Does that make me want to withdraw support for either of them? No. 		Their votes for SCOTUS, circuit &amp; district judges are essential to the survival of the US Constitution. 		Other votes are useful, too. https://t.co/Idr6hAijcn
(5) Any President MUST consider the interests of EVERYONE affected by a decision he or she is about to make. 		Millions and millions of people are affected by his decisions regarding countries like those in the Middle East. 		Non-Presidents are free to talk the talk. That's fine. https://t.co/40nsyQhu7s
(4) One man was heinously murdered, by evil people. The population* in millions, of countries noted in the statement is: 		USA 327  	KSA 34 	Iran 82 	Yemen 29 	Lebanon 6 	Syria 18 	Israel 8 	Russia 144 	China 1,415 		*Rounded, source:  https://t.co/F001YwMYl9 https://t.co/jzQXaDb6ST
(3) Every point POTUS made was already known to me, &amp; to you, if you've been following actual events &amp; trends, instead of the MSM spin. 		YES the murder of Mr Khashoggi was AWFUL &amp; it is NOT condoned by Trump, the US, or me, or you. 		A President must consider the whole picture. https://t.co/9tWSEdSrVU
(2) The MSM critiques of the President's statement focus on peripheral aspects like his use of exclamation marks. Reflect on that, against the incredibly serious points made about Iran, international terrorism, global oil prices etc.  		Which side is talking about what MATTERS?

(34) A thread about a mass shooting at a hospital, domestic violence, and why Chicago is the perfect place to finally rebuild professional policing in the US: 		https://t.co/bi3fVlnDbZ
@sonovagun Do you feel better now?
(22) Talk to those around you who may become victimized, such as your kids, friends and family. Be the kind of active listener who they will trust to talk to. Don't offer advice necessarily; ask questions first. Show them you will be there. Help them build self esteem. Be a hero.
(21) It's an abdication of responsibility to treat domestic violence as solely a matter for the individuals directly involved. 		Bystanders, children, &amp; cops get killed. We can help the abused woman or man to make better decisions to be safe &amp; reduce the risk to others.
(20) These three tweets explain what I'm talking about. 		Chicago is at a crossroads, that will affect the whole of the USA. Something like 40% of policing is domestic violence related. 		https://t.co/a8uCqyDALE
(19) Empowering &amp; supporting LEOs is absolutely necessary. 		The Mercy Hospital tragedy could happen anywhere. By coincidence, it happened in the city that has drawn a lot of attention to its policing practices. 		We can't tackle domestic violence without backing Police.
(18) Education is key. We can't force victims to stand up to domestic violence, but the least we can do is try to show them what we know, either from experience or listening to others. So many people have low self esteem, esp. women. It's a big part of it. They target them.
(17) As someone who has been on the receiving end of domestic violence, I wish I knew then what I know now. 		If I'd had the knowledge &amp; will to kick him to the curb sooner, &amp; not go back, I'd have avoided a lot of trouble. 		Thankfully it didn't spill over to the workplace much,
(16) How to tackle domestic violence? Wew, big topic. I think the two most important things we can do are: 		&gt;Educate potential victims better 		&gt;Support LEOs &amp; enable them to do their job without getting in their way.
(15) This excerpt says a lot. Here's what happens when a bystander knows about guns and shootings... probably from living in "the neighborhood." Kept a cool head and helped others. Situational awareness is so important. https://t.co/ITmUyoMI3Z
(14) Another important clue is that the killer and Dr O'Neal were seen "walking and talking" before things escalated. Perhaps he had waited outside the hospital door at the time her shift ended. If she sensed danger she would not have continued on toward her parked car. https://t.co/oy0OenGvOB
(13) Eyewitness reports can be inaccurate but these ones seem quite consistent with each other &amp; with Police-issued information. 		This guy took a call at 1pm from the man who would later arrive and target Dr O'Neal: https://t.co/LihQY1Dgn5
(12), Sorry, just noticed an error in tweet (2): Officer Jimenez was 28 not 32.
(11) I will never understand why hospitals aren't secured like airports. I wish the industry would lift their game on this issue. Patients &amp; visitors are incredibly vulnerable, and warrant more effective security. Staff are often targeted or caught up in violence.
(10) The Tribune article says the two were seen arguing at around 3pm. That may have been the end of her shift; It's a common time for shift change in hospitals. 		Just providing security for certain employees &amp; their vehicles at this time would probably reduce a lot of deaths.
(9) Professionals advising a person who is ending a relationship with a domestic abuser always recommend assessing risk and, if necessary, going into hiding, or taking other measures, no matter how inconvenient. 		It's possible that this came out of the blue for her, though.
(8) Tragically, most people killed by an ex-partner underestimated the danger &amp; didn't take enough precautions. The reasons are complex but it's a feature of domestic violence worldwide. 		A restraining order is just a piece of paper. Helpful, but not enough.
(7) We know the Police worked to secure the first floor AND the nursery on the third floor. 		It's possible Dr O'Neal's child or children were in the nursery. Domestic violence killers often go after the kids. If she didn't have kids, perhaps someone heard a threat &amp; reported it.
(6) In the coming days we will learn the murderer's name and a bit more about him. 		Regardless, we already know the two had been engaged &amp; then it was broken off. That's usually done by the person who was later murdered. Most of us can accept rejection without getting violent.
(5) I believe that most mass shooting incidents are caused by domestic violence, workplace violence, or interpersonal violence. The other causes make up smaller proportions of the total, yet garner the most attention. 		Domestic violence usually spills over into the workplace.
(4) I often write threads about shootings and similar events. Like you, I try to get the facts, not the spin. Those who knew the victims can't bring them back, and very little can be done to ease their pain. 		Trying to prevent similar tragedies is the least we can do.
(3) I'm getting info from this article: 		https://t.co/t10h5Ct0OM
(2) The woman in the middle was 28yo Dr Tamara Neal MD, who worked in the ER. Her ex-fiance was the murderer. 		25yo pharmacist Dayna Less walked out of an elevator at the wrong time. 		32yo Officer Samuel Jimenez, a married father of three, helped save many lives. https://t.co/w2dYn75UmG
(1) These three beautiful people were murdered today at Mercy Hospital Chicago. I will tell you a little about them, what happened, and why it was not about guns, or Chicago, or politics. It was about #DomesticViolence. 		Rest in peace. 		üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/JuAv3ky8rT

@BirchJonh @butcheboy88 Sure, but upon applying for asylum, they are now detained, the hearing is fast tracked, almost every claim is found meritless, and they are refused entry. 		I wept for America A LOT more when the crooked, lying Democrat was in the White House. https://t.co/v2ZP5KatZ6
(14) But but they are fleeing poverty &amp; violence! 		No. They are dragging the child through more of that, with no chance of an asylum claim being accepted. 		&gt;9 million people live in Honduras. There are more deserving asylum cases there AND kids are safer there than on the road. https://t.co/bop7z9AN0F
(33) I use "male" &amp; "female" iso "man" &amp; "woman" not bc of the nationality of the caravaners but bc I reserve those terms for people who act like a man, woman, or parent... I feel very strongly that putting a child at risk for your own self-interest is criminal, whoever does it. https://t.co/Dv6Jm0mMIT
@sandyaschneider I've watched the caravans for over a month now and, I agree with you, however even if this baby was bused the length of the country, he or she is far too young to even do that safely. Lots of the kids have fevers, dehydration, and exhaustion.
(32) There's the port of entry and, what I assume is, the park that has been taken over by caravaners and was the scene of protests yesterday. Close to the delights of downtown Tijuana. https://t.co/cDvgU6aF6H
(31) The field is just a gentle stroll away from the main border crossing port of entry in Tijuana. https://t.co/V4W7FPxPb5
(30) I'll show you where the field is in Tijuana. Note that some caravaners are apparently sleeping under the stars, and there is plenty of indoor space in the clubhouse and other large buildings nearby. One of them is a local govt office. https://t.co/83qKjrSwPf
(29) Oh, and I'd install privacy screens and separate males, females, and "family" groups, too. https://t.co/TotLyBDgGB
(28) If you want to install makeshift showers &amp; provide sanitary conditions for a group of "displaced" people, it pays to provide a grill to stand on, or at least a hard surface sloped to allow the water to flow away. Standing water is a no-no. 		It started out sort of "OK": https://t.co/5vgnTUsL2X
(27) At first, I assumed these "showers" were already at the baseball field for some reason, but a photo of the field from 11/15/18 shows these were just block walls in the fence. Someone installed PVC pipes... the Mexican govt? A "charity" group paid off by organizers? https://t.co/pqr74Fn46Z
(26) Some might say it's good that caravaners can have a shower at this camp, but no. I'll show you in photos why it's unsanitary, contributes to the problem by attracting people to the caravans, and was literally installed just now. https://t.co/VvxtZMK6Mc
(25) It's not necessary to offer cash because they'll join a caravan just for the free food and logistical support on offer. Cash is used to pay truck and bus drivers, though. Some don't need a cash incentive, they support the political stunt, or are threatened by the cartels. https://t.co/ZWOqfL1XkR
(24) Conditions in the "camps" are squalid. Always somewhere to charge your phone, though. 		The groups providing the food, water &amp; clothing that encourage people to join the caravans are causing a humanitarian disaster. They don't care. https://t.co/mAoTDu9jsr
(23) An adult female with four young kids, one of whom is in bare feet on gravel. Granted, the soles of the feet do toughen up, but this is just insane. Sharp objects cause cuts, that get infected. And kids get exhausted, too. https://t.co/63yeMbaVXG
(22) I estimate this baby at around two months old. Far too small to be carried around in the heat, in crowds with virtually no effective infection control measures. There's no way this baby made it from Mexico's Southern border. Must be from the Northern region. https://t.co/CSPXnyvjhs
(21) Adult male &amp; child (almost certainly trafficked, not related) approaches the border, sees a US border patrol truck &amp; turns back. 		Children &amp; adults at the border are routinely at risk of sexual assault &amp; death (from violence or extreme heat), &amp; it's been this way for years. https://t.co/ozMjqzpdYr
(20) Yes, this baby is apparently being breastfed from the buggy, in the street. Oh well, at least he or she is getting some food. https://t.co/qcpuFJqDyL
(19) Americans in need after wildfires or hurricanes always help kids before adults. Not so with the caravaners. I've seen example after example of "every man for himself," and very young children in appalling, unsanitary conditions. The kids are skinny, too. The adults aren't. https://t.co/7UOaMci5gV
(18) The caravaners, bless their lawless little hearts, are often seen in festive mood (and always smoking cigarettes while the kids with them go hungry.) On the day they arrived at the beach, some were pelted with rocks after reports of crime against local residents. https://t.co/sRR7Oyvq2s
(17) The second barrier, and the portion of fence that's in the water can be seen in these aerial photos. Really, this hardening work should have been done in January 2017, but I still can't fault President Trump on border security. He's done more than any of his predecessors. https://t.co/4Tab2OMinE
(16) The area is crawling with armed CBP police on foot, horse and ATV, with floodlighting and a second barrier fence. Climbing onto the remaining portion of fence is a mere publicity stunt. Amphibious equipment may still be used to wire the rest of the fence. https://t.co/1edprpoUee
(15) HW's guide to the San Diego/Tijuana beach border in 4 tweets. 		Today, POTUS tweeted this photo from the US side. In the distance you can see fence without razor wire, because the current machinery there can't go in the water. It's still secure though, because... https://t.co/EOiooD9nY9

(12) A few violent protesters in the front row play directly into the hands of the left, who permeate the Mexican government, the international media, and the caravans' organizers.

(11) I counted 13 cameras on the caravaners' side, behind the police, and a few on the Mexican protesters' side, too. 		Pretty clear that the lying, liberal MSM is trying to frame the protesters as the bad guys. 		The police chief had no intention of protecting his/her officers. https://t.co/HFPxk3jeDf
(10) Tijuana has many monuments to historical leaders, but the protesters apparently chose to march to this one, because Cuauhtemoc symbolizes the struggle of the Aztecs against Spanish invaders. 		Those organizing the caravans shouldn't have poked the bear. https://t.co/Ef5XntaoYS

(8) It's very simple. If you genuinely need asylum, accept the offer given by the FIRST country you come to (Mexico.) You don't get to pick and choose which country to go to.
