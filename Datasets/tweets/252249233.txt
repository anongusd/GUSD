I’m hearing from Oregonians who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay. People are afraid of losing their homes or not being able to pay their bills, and all b/c Trump is using federal workers as leverage for his ineffective and expensive border wall. #TrumpShutdown
The majority of suspected terrorists enter the U.S. through airports, not the southern border. The best way to root them out is a well-funded, well-trained @TSA and @CBP – too bad @RealDonaldTrump is forcing them to work without pay for the duration of the #TrumpShutdown.
The majority of drugs smuggled into the U.S. come through legal ports of entry. Instead of spending $5B on a wall that will do little-to-nothing to stop drug flow into the US, we could spend that money on much-needed resources to support our border agents. #TrumpShutdown
While Trump &amp; his Mar-a-Lago cronies might like walls around their mansions, a border wall will be an expensive, wasteful, &amp; ineffective use of taxpayer funds.

President Trump has repeatedly promised to shrink our trade deficit with China. It just hit a record high. I'm tired of all this winning, aren't you?
A PA woman sees $1.50 increase in her weekly paycheck. Compare that to people who earn more than $500k, who will see $400+ each week. Everyone's share of the massive deficit created by the #GOPTaxScam is $4,600. Does Speaker Ryan think that's fair?
While President Trump shilled for the #GOPTaxScam and celebrated massive tax cuts for the wealthy today in Ohio, the Dow dropped more than 1500 points. He takes credit for its rise -- when do you think we'll hear him take credit for its fall?

The #TrumpShutdown is already impacting thousands of Oregonians - Community Health Centers, which serve 30,000 in Lane County alone, are unfunded. GOP leaders MUST stop pointing fingers and find a solution to this mess.
President Trump's party controls the House and the Senate. It's up to them to end the #TrumpShutdown.
The 'Master Negotiator' asked Congress for a bipartisan deal, which was delivered to him last week. He rejected it. The number one person at fault for this #Shutdown is Trump himself. #TrumpShutdown
We cannot continue to run the government on a month-to-month budget. Republicans' refusal to work across the aisle has led us to the #TrumpShutdown -- it's well past time for them to come up with bipartisan solutions.
A government #shutdown is beyond irresponsible: While GOP leaders scramble to find a solution, the U.S. stands to lose trillions in lost revenue, thousands of workers wait to find out if they will be furloughed, and people lose confidence in their government. https://t.co/oV4U0Cw6eP
