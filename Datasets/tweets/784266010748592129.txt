@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Absolutely and I am very proud. My daughter wants to be an FBI and my son is majoring Fire Science but will be going to the Air Force after college to become a hopefully a officer and a pilot.
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Totally understandable I have two kids that I can only lead by example and not circumstances. So I totally understand where coming from. One in his freshman year college and my daughter in her senior year of high headed to college this fall.
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov See I learned something about you and I cannot judge you because I don‚Äôt know your experience unless you tell me. I‚Äôm reformed gang banger, raised poor, disabled veteran 12 yrs two tours of duty in Iraq, full time premed student in her senior year.
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov But it‚Äôs there and many other issues instead of trying to see me being wrong about the issue how about ask questions and learn about the experience. It how people come together
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Lol never said it was your fault you seem to have took it there. It‚Äôs call learning from others because when I tell you as a black women that knows about things in my communities and culture it‚Äôs from my personal knowledge. I seen discrimination even when I was in the military
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Oh really... so because you see black people at the voter polls you assume there is no black problem with black voters. i see... well good luck with that thought process

But hey what do I know I only fought in war lol your hilarious
@ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Of course you feel that way but okay
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov That‚Äôs your truth because you have no idea but what you know
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov How is there no one‚Äôs own truth... and this is where we can continue to disagree. Can I ask have you lived the black experience in America? Have you lived the illegal immigration experience in America? Have you lived a person of color experience America? If no
@ReaLindaSteding @gio56 @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov When women‚Äôs right were recognized black people still couldn‚Äôt vote period and i the constitution said black were part animal not all human. Smh look I get it‚Äôs easier to read about I am going to keep saying there history that you will never know because it was pass down
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Sigh I know all this but have you lived the life of an African American at that time.. you can say all the history but can you discount what actually people went through hence why there is still civil rights issues still about voting
RT @soledadobrien: Racism runs deep with this dude, especially as it pertains to people of color born in the US. (But I get it‚Äîrelaunching‚Ä¶
@Lucy2300090 @ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov No one said they didn‚Äôt support legal immigration but I will not support racism and bigotry of a race because of falsehoods or lies of any kind. I didn‚Äôt join the military for that and the fact people Americans who believe in hate have become this I don‚Äôt support this
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Once again I say my father and mother spoke of the black experience they had with voting down south and in the Midwest at that time as well as my grand parents. So it‚Äôs typically a trait for people to believe it was okay unless they themselves went through it
@Lucy2300090 @ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov You really are hell bent on being correct hey if you believe it than you believe it.
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov True but I speak from generations whose passed down stories from parent to children. I understand you have your beliefs but it amazes me how people just don‚Äôt listen to one another. Your truth is your own I guess.

@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov At the same time someone who isn‚Äôt black can‚Äôt tell me what blacks go through nor someone who isn‚Äôt Hispanics cannot tell an Hispanics person what there truth is the same for a white person. The problem is everyone trying to say they know and have no idea just there opinions
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov I truly agree on that but I‚Äôm not go to say one political party is the cause of it. Because honestly it‚Äôs both parties and the reason wages are the way they are is because local and state will not raise the wages because they choose too. I think people forget that
@ReaLindaSteding @gio56 @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Lol okay
@ReaLindaSteding @kathycrhs @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov So am I. The act was in 1965 but was enforced till 1968. But what do I know I‚Äôm only black and raised by two black parents who experienced it.
@ReaLindaSteding @gio56 @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov I hate to break it too you that in 1968 is when they recognize it. Plus maybe I know because my dad was there smh.
@ReaLindaSteding @kathycrhs @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Actually I‚Äôm a concern veteran who happened to pay attention to issues in my country. Secondly why do you label people political affiliation instead of just saying politician smh.
@ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov That were low wage that were not on a higher spectrum of the pay scale in which made it seem as though the wages increase economically for African Americans and how do I know living in a black community and studying it.
@ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov First let me make myself very clear. I was speaking of the foundation of low wages so let‚Äôs not be ignorant or rude this a discussion not ignorance. Secondly you may not know black people are still killed in America for being black. Third 2008-2017 showed an increase in jobs
@gio56 @ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Um blacks weren‚Äôt paid at all and were killed. Hell we just received voting rights in 1968. So high wages were not in the favor of blacks. Now in regards to the farming immigrants they are just recycling what they did to blacks to them. So I‚Äôm trying to see what‚Äôs your point.
@Lucy2300090 @ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Not true when I was stationed el paseo which was in 2006 there was still an influx of illegal immigrants coming in the fence doesn‚Äôt work. But hey if you believe it I guess it‚Äôs your truth.
@kathycrhs @Lucy2300090 @ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov A human trafficking of people of color or for organ harvesting. See I‚Äôm not looking at the border because we have huge issues in our own country that needs to be tackled.
@kathycrhs @Lucy2300090 @ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Most drugs that come through the southern border are in tunnels underground how does a wall fix that. So human trafficking hmm well we rather say it‚Äôs at the border but it‚Äôs very much in urban areas in USA did you know over 300 black girls were taken in the DC area part of a
@ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov I‚Äôm a veteran and it bothers me it is this much bitterness in America smh.
@ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov the problem is everyone wants to say their here illegally okay well then all the immigrants who built this country whether they came freely or kidnap to come here built this melting pot. The sad part is everything that the Statue of Liberty stands for has just been forgotten
@ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Also yes they are both at fault but I will not push that fault on people that have been just stereotyped as bad because someone states it for political reasons. That‚Äôs like me saying all white people like shooting up schools and churches. Nope can‚Äôt do that
@ReaLindaSteding @Lucy2300090 @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Low wages were not created by illegal immigration it was created when blacks were being Lynch to keep them below the pay levels of whites. That had nothing to do with immigration
@ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov And once again I‚Äôll say this I understand there are people in America that hate people of color and Hispanics for whatever reason, but more Americans die of opioids than heroine. The opioids come from China through ports of entry. Now is drugs a problem yes but heroine isn‚Äôt
@Lucy2300090 @ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov You a singular individual but more 4 white Americans shoot up schools and churches. I understand that some Americans hate people of color or Hispanics, but we cannot use singular events to say a whole race of people are this way. Isn‚Äôt that what racism thrives on? Your opinion
@Lucy2300090 @ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Be realistic here when it comes to half truths and pointing fingers. This is why we are at this point now everyone wants to be right and no one wants compromise because it makes them the weak party. Smh tell that to the people not receiving a paycheck
@Lucy2300090 @ReaLindaSteding @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov When it comes to border security it amazes me how the blame is either the Democrats or Republicans did it.

If you ever been on deployment or had a spouse leave for one you would know how hard it is
@luckranch1 @SecNielsen @USCG @INDOPACOM I was referencing to what she said about the military period. Because that is what she spoke about and since I am veteran I understand what military families go through on a regular basis without a shutdown so I can just imagine being deployed and your family gets nothing.
@SecNielsen You would know equality or diversity if it smack you in the face lady.
@SecNielsen @USCG @INDOPACOM how can they pay the USCG if President Trump keeps the shutdown to get a wall? I would think a president who thrives off of being the deal maker to allow the military active Coast Guard &amp; Veterans in federal jobs) and Americans to be paid while he works with congress for reform.

@michael_wodtke @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow The fact that this is your truth shows a lot about the state of America right now.
@realDonaldTrump And now the stock market is in turmoil. For all the puffing of your chest you really have messed up your own success.
@realDonaldTrump Umm hate to break it to you holding people‚Äôs paychecks hostage for a wall doesn‚Äôt help either. It takes two to compromise professionally and so people don‚Äôt suffer. So don‚Äôt point fingers unless both parties want to blame themselves and open the government to then talk reform.
@realDonaldTrump We are equal... interesting. Maybe you should actually live by the words you just stated. Instead of causing division when it‚Äôs convenient for your agenda. We have enough liars in Washington how about being a president. Just a thought!

@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Lol this is why nothing productive gets done. It‚Äôs a lot of fear tactics and crap. Instead of real life change that is actually productive. My tax money when I was in the military went to federal government and my state. You know why because that‚Äôs the law. So all this extra
@michael_wodtke @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Actually they were voted in by citizens of the United States of America. So how are they representing illegals I‚Äôm confused because the represent the wishes of people who voted them in. So all those people illegals. Sigh it just amazes me at the hatred people have.
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Look if you believe that okay. You can hate or love immigrants but if that helps you sleep at night hey believe what you need too.
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Hmmm... well you just keep on believing in what you believe and I hope that train of thought helps you in life.
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Say what you will, but your own beliefs if you own. I choose to follow the we are a land immigrants and the state of liberty has been a beacon of hope even before you or I was thought of. So I guess this is the new America I was sworn in the military under the real America
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow My own beliefs in the matter. I see it through being a compassionate person. And base my opinion on the fact that as Military person I support human life and hate human suffering. Like I said you believe what you will and I‚Äôll stick to my beliefs regardless of people‚Äôs hate
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Why are you getting upset. I‚Äôm stating my point you cannot say anyone doesn‚Äôt belong here because you are afraid or don‚Äôt like them. That‚Äôs your opinion and though I feel your compassion meter is at zero it is your own beliefs. I‚Äôm not here to change your beliefs because I have
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Here we are... and as I said the fore fathers didn‚Äôt want this foolishness of you can‚Äôt come but instead they worked together and figured it out.
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow At one point some could say you had no right being here. Someone can say blacks have no right being here. Someone can say whites have no right being here because the only people who legitimately have a claim is native Americans. We all can say we have no right being here but here
@michael_wodtke @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Actually it‚Äôs not just one side because you hate them. The republican can sit down with Democrats without a shutdown. A job isn‚Äôt guaranteed but it shouldn‚Äôt be a pawn in politics either. It‚Äôs about representation of the people no matter the political affiliation.
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Right blacks that were slaves were stolen and immigrants that came of their own free will did so with the promise of the American dream. Instead of a dream here we are in a nightmare based off fear tactics and not actually truth.
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Borders security has nothing to do with that... the population that is most on welfare, social security, and Medicaid are the white population. Not illegal immigrants.
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow The immigrants that built this country wasn‚Äôt legal in no way... it seems like people are so stuck on self that compassion isn‚Äôt an option. In which is sad. I‚Äôm a veteran and seeing all this hatred and malice really is sad to see.
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow How does a wall cure tunnels underground? How does a wall stop tons of drugs coming through port of entry? How does a wall stop drugs coming in by ship? How does a wall stop opioids that come from China that is an epidemic in the US? So please tell me how does the wall help?
@TrumpForUSA2020 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow So you get the American dream and than say no others can. Interesting and that isn‚Äôt being American. America was built on the backs of slaves and immigrants. So are you saying Americans should forget what the Statue of liberty states than? ‚ÄúBring your poor and tired‚Äù hmm I see
@michael_wodtke @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Actually he isn‚Äôt because if he was there wouldn‚Äôt be a shut down instead theee would be bipartisan meetings that would be hash out while people remained with pay.

@CurtisB87458383 @SecNielsen @DHSgov So what your saying is that she can‚Äôt go to jail because their crimes are more punishable... but if your crooked and lie as you put it than everyone whose a liar in government no matter Democrat or republican should be in jail.

@davegarrison001 We are close to that now because our government is in shambles.
@davegarrison001 He cannot be offended he wanted the job and it is scrutinized by all and since the media has freedom to do their job unless he wants to be a Putin and take away the 1st amendment. He sucks up and be a leader.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump It is really happens at his rallies and calling black women in Congress stupid and belittling them. Or making fun of a person Native American heritage isn‚Äôt just racist it‚Äôs disturbing for a president to do.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump I have and calling black football players sons of bitches for taking a knee for the fallen African Americans from police brutality is horrible and saying that Chicago has the highest crime rate, but not acknowledging that is partly to police brutality to people of color
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump I know and it‚Äôs unfortunate to believe a parent could do that. I‚Äôve known of people who has done this. It sad and disgusting.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Point for political incumbents.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump I understand that in America blacks aren‚Äôt given a fair shake and are constantly tossed to the side by political and state and local officials when it comes to trafficking and kidnapping. There is more outrage for other countries over outrage about our own. It‚Äôs only a talking
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump I will look up more information on this
@davegarrison001 I disagree because a lot were attacks on others when they disagreed. Instead of being presidential he sounded like a bully.
@davegarrison001 Have benefit from it either way, but hey if people believe they believe
@davegarrison001 Actually that‚Äôs an roll over from Obama last policy leaving office as Obama received Bush roll over that he had to fix. That common knowledge but trump is using it as his own policy in which it isn‚Äôt hence the lying. Nor have my community or the many African communities I know
@davegarrison001 The problem is everyone calls names in politics trying to show who has the most power but work is being done.
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Hmmm ever been in a inner city community ask their opinion of you knowing the truth. But once again you seem to have all the answers
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Since I don‚Äôt affiliate with any party it amazes me sometimes how people tend to just say the first thing that comes out their mouths... oh right that is exactly what trump does and i guess your believer well good luck with that mindset
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Previous statement the proof was in previous statements (old tweets, video interviews and videos, paper trail with his signature... etc) so much but hey what does the world know he said don‚Äôt believe the truth if you see it.. so your very smart
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Really hmm ü§î you know it all and actually evidence from past tweets, video footage, paper trails, etc., but hey all of it was fabricated and just happened when he became president. You got everyone we all are just lying on trump
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump You do know previous presidents policies don‚Äôt go into effect or really gain footing until the next president goes into office. But I‚Äôm sure you knew that but if not that‚Äôs what Obama did and trump is saying he did it. Sorry he didn‚Äôt but hey you know so much.
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Yup you absolutely know correct because paper said so... hmm I guess you can‚Äôt pull anything over on you. I guess you told me...

A profit. Bank reform where the banks don‚Äôt hold the American people hostage. Pharmaceutical reform where these companies not only gain money off of people‚Äôs illnesses as well keeping cure or medications hostage for profit. That will fight for those who are poor
That will enhance the world. To treat our military in a respect deserving of the man and women who fights and dies for this country. A person who deal with homelessness, starvation, drugs, racism, sexism, and classisms. Education reform where companies don‚Äôt use our children as
Will there ever be a political incumbent that‚Äôs not a political incumbent. Instead it will be someone who actually represents the people whether they were poor or rich. A person whose views on the world is to keep America as a partner on climate change and technology
@davegarrison001 Agreed
@davegarrison001 He is his own worst enemy and as a president you don‚Äôt defend yourself you act in a way that your actions speak volumes. In what way does calling his opposition names or telling falsehood make him any better as the people he is complaining about
@davegarrison001 Yes they do no political affiliation and that means backing political parties or campaigns either. Because you cannot be a representation of the people if you are buying into the system that broken.
@davegarrison001 I agree he was elected because the thought was he represented the people but what people did he really represents because a true man or woman of the people would actually represent all people not one color or pay bracket.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump That is good to know because in our communities we need help all of the these communities who children get taken and when families get to close the child is killed. It sad reality
@davegarrison001 The police won‚Äôt do or care to do. Unfortunately in our communities if you don‚Äôt have money or of influence in politics or old money‚Äôs there‚Äôs no outside help

@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Because we never had it for the people because we are only photo ops and political pawns for votes
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump We in black communities work hard to find our children because no one cares unless it‚Äôs a photo op to get more votes or money. This is people lives and this is why poor or low income blacks don‚Äôt believe in saviors or protector outside of our community
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump It does matter when it‚Äôs only blacks in American who are fighting for blacks. You fight outside of America correct. Try living in a country when your ancient were slaves and were taken from their home for years. And it‚Äôs still continuous in black communities.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Trump defends himself because he uses his platform to make accusations rather than solutions. Because of his rallying of hate speech African Americans have been accosted more openly from racial slurs to actually being harm. Like I said it‚Äôs not him but his actions effect many
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Oh no one is off the hook when I say government I mean as whole. I hate politics because people are use as pawns in the next move or a barter for their own pockets. Hence why the government needs an overhaul of actually government personnel that speak for the people by their act
@davegarrison001 I appreciate and commend you for your continued service to help people. And that is commendable in itself. We will probably agree to disagree, but know you have my respect for helping save lives from human trafficking.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Before military protection can be given a government overhaul should be done or what will be the point. We can build a wall but if the government policies are still destructive to our liberties that we fought and died for than it‚Äôs really worthless.

@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Is more talk and make irrational decisions that are not only tyrant like, but cause more harm than good
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump True but who is the sitting president...Trump is and the only way to change things is to change things. As I stated the government needs an internal overhaul to fix what‚Äôs broken. I never said that other past presidents weren‚Äôt to blame, but don‚Äôt be a president that
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Except for the communities and no one from the government said a word. It happens every but at least our government could care instead of the constant bickering like children with government officials.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump I believe that but in America it‚Äôs not a bigger deal than it should be because of the children coming form low income areas did you know in a two month time frame earlier this year 35 black little girls were missing in the two low income areas no one said nothing
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump That only an government overhaul can fix not a wall or camps. So until the government starts taking action to clean up in house this is the chaos that will continue to be the norm.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump I am not anger or not showing or equality, but what I am saying if this is the case than rather than building a wall... the problem is that the government doesn‚Äôt have a system in place that separates the two illegal and legal immigration in which is a problem
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump As I stated if you are a immigrant whose doing it the legal way and the government has a system why would illegal immigrants be lumped in with legal immigration? It sounds like the system needs an immigration overhaul not a wall.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Are they delayed because that‚Äôs an excuse to push the agenda like saying oh because of them you can‚Äôt become a citizen that‚Äôs very divisive. The cases of those who are legal should be separate from illegal. I guess in the government common sense isn‚Äôt common
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Then why aren‚Äôt they and 1940‚Äôs there was actually system that followed the rule of law for immigration. This system hasn‚Äôt been used nowadays especially with trump Administration and the whole give me your tired and your poor doesn‚Äôt apply anymore.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Really hmmm... if you say so but you know we are living in country where opinions or freedom to speak truths is considered fake so however you see it is however you see it I guess.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump They maybe taken but wouldn‚Äôt die in custody. I never said it wasn‚Äôt happening since the 1990‚Äôs what I said was they kept the family units together, but you know when their such an hatred for immigrants or people of color what do you expect
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump I know of this, but did you know that America has a human trafficking problem of children of color grom low income neighborhoods being abducted and no one sayings world from the administration or for people who use this as a talking point about immigrants
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Someone running from tyrants and what type of country that will allow a child to die in their care? What type of country went to another country to steal their people to be slaves for another color and has constantly killed and harassed them based off their color?
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump They didn‚Äôt keep the cages they did keep them together with their families and sent them back as families. So once again make sure you state everything before comparing. Under Trump children and adults have died. Human rights village from NATO across the board
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump He hasn‚Äôt done anything but rally and complain. When he actually start being a president I‚Äôll then stop stating how he is not a leader but a follower of dictator countries. Hey you say tomato I say tomatoe
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Be country united.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump No he wasn‚Äôt elected by the people the electoral college elected him difference. As for harassment he does that to women, people of color, and those who oppose his views when he is wrong. So unless he is going to actually lead I don‚Äôt think we will ever be a
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Nope didn‚Äôt assume anything and just as I stated Your facts maybe revenant for when Clinton served as president but he isn‚Äôt the sitting president now. So how is it revelant
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Once again not affiliated with any party just see wrong as wrong. Why isn‚Äôt any trump supporters call everyone a liberal if they don‚Äôt like what they say?
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump This is happening right now sorry to tell you the grass ain‚Äôt greener on the other side.
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Lol are you serious it‚Äôs more loop holes to more companies than there is to the troops. The spending on goes to weapons and the pay raises were 2.5% not 10%. So please spare me.
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Didn‚Äôt say that what I said was the only sitting president Ronald Regan was the only president that actually did right by the troops. Secondly not his fault but his lies don‚Äôt help to fix the problem neither
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump And can‚Äôt think for themselves to see pass the lies. But feel and think what you want.
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump As I explained in the other post don‚Äôt lead if your not the example and don‚Äôt promise things you have no intentions on doing. Since so many rather believe the lies try go visiting the veterans and troops it actually effects. Smh but to me most are so brainwashed
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Because our president doesn‚Äôt care because his promises sound so good people believe anything instead of actually talking to the people effected by the lies.
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump The mini clinics that are veterans are run down buildings. In which has been known by all presidents and even this one who said he would change what has been broken because our troops and veterans deserve it. Right his secretary over VA hasn‚Äôt done anything
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Sat there so long instead of having proper burials. Did you know that the military personnel who returns from combat don‚Äôt receive the best care this country can give unless it‚Äôs from one of the major hospitals like Texas or Washington DC. Did you know that
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Are still happening right now veterans aren‚Äôt getting paid and did you know in the state of Illinois that One of their VA hospitals had 100‚Äôs of veterans bodies in a morgue that wasn‚Äôt secure to handle bodies and their remains started to liquify because they
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump The military and I‚Äôm not a republican, but know my Military history. Now as of now if trump is going to say or claim he has done more for the military over any sitting president he should have facts to back it up. Did you that the problems with the VA
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump As I stated I don‚Äôt care if you what party because I‚Äôve been critical of ALL presidents no matter the party. See that‚Äôs the difference between party Over country and country over party. In this no sitting president except for Ronald regan has done just by the
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Amendment so a black women I shouldn‚Äôt feel the need to have to ready for a white women or man to disrespect me for my color in 2018 because of they feel emboldened by the president. Next two children in US custody died we are already in violation of NATO law
@McHugh1966 @realDonaldTrump Easy a dictator insights hate to cause chaos and then uses it as leverage to push his or her agenda. Since he has been in office there has been more hate crimes against minorities and bomb threats all because of racist comments or comments against the 1st
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Is a great man, but even the irrational of people can eventually see when they have been fooled. It isn‚Äôt party over country it‚Äôs country over party. But your opinion is your own.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Of a man child. I can‚Äôt respect him or his party regardless because they take liberties and freedoms for granted. As I stated I cannot respect the man nor the party he stands for because he is the reason they look like fools around the world. You may think he
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump This is all under this president watch because he placed someone over VA and he did no better than any other president. He had to be pressured to visit the troops and he rather tweet than actually be a leader because his tweets are transparency they are whining
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump In Illinois the bodies of veterans were left in hot morgues where they started to liquify where is the justice in that? The VA computer system hasn‚Äôt been updated since 2000 and crashed causing veterans to not receive benefits for disability and education.
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Children were left to die in camps that weren‚Äôt for humans to be in and that in itself is a war crime under NATO. There are some many veterans with PTSD and other mental plus physical issues and the veterans hospitals are piss poor
@davegarrison001 @realDonaldTrump Shown their true colors because of it. We talk if immigrates being dangerous when we have more home grown terrorist in the United States and they get passes. A seven year black child was killed by a white man while in a park car with her family... two immigrant
