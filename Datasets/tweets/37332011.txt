Laws were created to deal with the shittiness of humans. We expect people to behave morally due to sheer delusion. We see things not as they are but how we want them to be. Libertarians, for e.g, engage in a consensual hallucination to arrive at such a worldview.
All of this really comes to the premises. Do people behave morally in the absence of laws? Consider the way people speak on the internet: it's the Wild West. NO laws. NO moral conduct.
To expect morality from a business in a capitalist system is delusional. Amazon behaves legally. If it's legal, people will do it. All of history has proven that.

Increased prevalence of PTSD among youths in our criminal justice system consistent with their high rates of trauma exposure (avg of 14 distinct lifetime traumas)
Fairly certain that as the DSM gets larger + larger, it'll encompass every single person leading to the inevitable conclusion that disorder (disruption of normal mental functions) belies it's own premise that "normal" exists
