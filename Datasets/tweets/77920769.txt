So that’s the story of how a social welfare organization helped one person get a Cabinet job that was widely considered a stepping stone to higher public office without having to say who paid for it all. Thanks for reading my #thread -30-
Because of last year’s policy change, when this pro-Pruitt group files its 990 for 2018 (a period in which it spent $400k on ads attacking a Democrat), the group may not have to say anything at all about where its money came from. 9/
But even without obtaining the donor identities, I learned a lot from the redacted version released by this pro-Pruitt group–including that just 17 corporations/people provided some pretty big checks to support Pruitt. 8/
Mitchell praised the IRS’s 2018 decision to let 501(c)(4) groups keep their donor lists secret. There’s “no public policy imperative” since the donor identities are not publicly released, she argued. In other words, why bother if no one will ever get the names anyway? 7/
She doubled down on that metaphor in a 2012 paper that argued more disclosure will chill First Amendment rights (and that the media “love[s] the regulation of everyone else’s speech because they have their very own carveouts from regulations”) 6/ https://t.co/u3J9FX8T1k
And she’s a longtime critic of expanded disclosure requirements for social welfare nonprofits. She wrote this in 2010 about a bill that would have boosted 501(c)(4) donor disclosure requirements. (The ACLU also opposed the bill, FWIW) 5/ https://t.co/M40QaoS2XE https://t.co/VgcGcPkb3S
How does this loop back to Pruitt? He hired Cleta Mitchell as one of his lawyers last year. She’s one of Washington’s top campaign finance and tax attorneys. She used to sit on the board of the National Rifle Association, a 501(c)(4) group. 4/
Last year the Trump administration changed IRS policy so that 501(c)(4) groups like this one no longer have to tell even the IRS who their donors are. That means even the basic info I was able to get will no longer be available. 3/ https://t.co/kmU1f0zjVS
I was only able to find out how many significant donors the pro-Pruitt group had and how much they each gave. Their identities are disclosed to the IRS, but not to the public. 2/ https://t.co/ehTOlVEufJ
