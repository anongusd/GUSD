The Problem Solvers Caucus met earlier today to discuss potential steps to get our government opened again. We all agreed that Congress must work together in a truly bipartisan manner, and through open, constructive, and good faith dialogue.
We're open despite the unfortunate government shutdown. My staff and I are working and able to help with things you need such as social security or Medicare. We're also out attending important events and meetings around the district. https://t.co/MZ2d6VmxiP
These issues include addressing our spending priorities like the Children's Health Insurance Program and paying our men and women in uniform. We also must address our failing immigration policies.
In Washington, we continue to work out the details of a  bipartisan  solution. This week, the Problem Solvers Caucus, which I  co-chair, held a  bipartisan meeting with over 50 House and Senate  members looking to bring stability to government and solve the problems we face.
I want to assure people I will not stop working until a solution is  found. In the meantime, our office will remain open, accessible and able  to help as many people as possible with the things they need such as  social security checks, Medicare, or veterans issues.
The unfortunate government shutdown is further proof that the extremes on both sides of the aisle continue to focus on their own self interests and not the needs of the American people. I am deeply disappointed these extremists, who are refusing to compromise, have prevailed.
