@susanlschaffer1 @RealJamesWoods @TuckerCarlson Unfortunately, the're coming anyway.  I bet paying each $5,000 a year for life would be cheaper than supporting them in the US -- add up Healthcare, Education, Welfare and Crime.  I am certain the annual cost per illegal immigrant is much greater than $5,000.  Just a thought.
The sad fact is, the USA will be out of pocket  billions in either benefits or foreign aid.  It seems interesting to get these people on record that they are willing to forgo entering the USA for a few dollars. https://t.co/39Sim1Xkdi

The average Honduran earns 9,700 HNL monthly. That's about $510 in US currency. So, $10,000 will support them for 18  months. https://t.co/WUtNETYZRw
Simple: (1) They sign an agreement waving any right to enter the USA, and (2) They don't get their money until they return home.  I think it's a better solution than providing foreign aid to their corrupt governments and cheaper and more beneficial to the people. https://t.co/kzWGcGuVud

Let's not quibble over a few nickles.  $150 Million is a fraction of our five year cost to support 15,000 immigrants.  Heck, give 'em $15,000. I believe those that reject the offer are MS13 and other nefarious souls and should he denied access. https://t.co/eRvrphqrY4

@ACMelass Annette... You are so right.   This is not about religion but rather dysfunctional immigration policy. #POTUS ban only effected 8% of the Muslim pop.  #POTUS is the only President in the past 20 years that is courageous enough to step into the line-of-fire to protect America.

@TweetiePieKC54 You are correct.  Drone use should be tightly controlled.  Unfortunately, expect nothing until something horrible happens.  Americans just love their freedom and won't give an inch.
@TweetiePieKC54 You are on point.  Our right to bear firearms is enumerated in the Constitution....The right to have drones, however, is not.  I'm a pilot and my flying is a privilege, not a right.

@AmericanHilbily @jessebwatters Scotty. Thank you. Based on the reviews, INDEFENSIBLE is a good read.  My mission is to enlighten the masses of High-tech Jihad with drones
@pearlskylar1 That is my wish
@pearlskylar1 Yes. The details are coming together. Met with the production group a week ago...now we are meeting with the finance people.  Very exciting.
@pearlskylar1 Inch by inch... It's only a matter of time...
@greggutfeld Keep us sane Greg! It's sad Fake News emanates from all factions.  We must demand honesty. Read INDEFESIBLE https://t.co/UbF1wVIgBo
.@jessebwatters Jesse, you must read INDEFENSIBLE -- Looming threat of Hi-Tech Jihad with weaponized micro-drones: https://t.co/iHFY4CdKh6
@TeeSparks1 @NicolosiFrank @TuckerCarlson Imagine 500 embedded jihadists each releasing 25 armed micro-drones.  That's 12,500 random targets threatening more then 1.3 Million souls.
@TeeSparks1 @NicolosiFrank @TuckerCarlson Unfortunate for us. I believe America is just too large to defend against random High-tech Drone Jihad. Millions of valuable targets.
@_POTUSTRUMPNEWS @pwitunski5 Great!!!!  There is hope!!!

@STxStargazer Laura, I'm pleased you're enjoying INDEFENSIBLE. Unfortunately, the story is frightening and inevitable.  Thank you for your kindness.
@NicolosiFrank @TuckerCarlson Unfortunately, the asymmetric U.S. battlefield is too large with thousands of targets making defense problematic &amp; costly even with LASERS!

@BigMtnRider @TuckerCarlson @RandyTedford The reality is Radical Islam Terrorists are not stupid, just evil. High-Tech Jihad is inevitable regardless of my book. We must be aware.
@Mexicanpov Jack, Yes. High-Tech Jihad is inevitable and serious.  We see movement away from suicide events to cars and trucks smashing into crowds
@Mexicanpov Ted Smith was a genius.  My last bird was a 310R I sold last year. New owner crashed last month after losing the right engine at KSNA üò£
