Guys, I'm out for a few days. Life has been a bit of a wreck lately w/ my Mom + little brother being ill. I have so much to do &amp; Twitter isn't helping me get it done. Back later. Maybe a week. Just didn't want anyone thinking I'm a horrid snob or having Lyme flare ups. Have fun!
RT @seanmdav: Mammas don’t let your babies grow up to take theology lessons from libertine atheists. https://t.co/eCuBfadxIE
@seanmdav I may be wrong but even if a person was not a Christian, just a human w/ a soul,  shouldn't we care about ANYONE being murdered much less a tiny baby!?!?!?! WOW. People are crazy...
@El__Bohemio Tell them they need to go to twitter for small talk and gossip! JEEZ! are they animals!?!?! :P
@tugboatphil @GluedThumbs That is the key! It's hard. I'm a horrible boss to me. LOL
@tugboatphil @GluedThumbs I totally get it. LOL I do a lot of business to business and have contracts so i am only kind of my own boss. :P
@lordthx1139 ISWYDT
@GluedThumbs IKR&gt; Maybe i shoudl just annoy myself and stop trying. :P
@GluedThumbs Don't be so annoying! :P

@El__Bohemio I work alone in my office alone and only deal with ppl indirectly over net or phone if necessary and most my clients are business to business bc i hate talking to ppl 1 on 1 very much. LOL
Oh and in case anyone is like what the crap is she referring to. AOC said she has 200 activists in a constant text message she can detonate on Dems if they vote with Rs or something.  https://t.co/f29UC2E1yb
@El__Bohemio I could never stand it long enough to even have fun with it. LOL
I've muted #FF twitter threads before and those are all people being nice...
If I was in a group text with over 200 ppl who referred to themselves as activists of any party or persuasion I think I'd just destroy my phone and never use the internet again. https://t.co/2Vg5KXRSbl

@JSmithLClass @PolitiBunny https://t.co/3L8AiPRkNO
@JSmithLClass @PolitiBunny They are not the same. Things are ok btw if you don't kill yourself. If you step off the ledge. It's way more ok than being dead. Also, stating that it's stupid and it destroys one of the best things about Trump is not getting spun up but OK :)Have a good one!
@JSmithLClass @PolitiBunny That's apples and oranges. He could easily have said nothing either way. No need to say he believes him no need to say he did not. He took his strongest point - blunt honesty and threw it in the trash for no reason. It did nothing but infuriate ppl. But you do you buddy.
@JSmithLClass @PolitiBunny How about just not say anything about it? Why pretend like we believe him and say that we do when we don't? One of the only good things about Trump is his being blunt and honest.

@BenHowe If it is you singing, I acknowledge the comedic genius. :)
@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg It is murder. If the mother health is at risk and the child is 7 - 9 months in the womb the baby can be delivered. Period.  If he/she can be delivered rather than dismembered in the womb there is no other thing to call it but murder.
RT @PolitiBunny: I always sort of figured pro-aborts would come for preemie parents eventually because we've seen tiny babies survive again…
@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg Glad we came to the same conclusion :) 	So from here out please remember at 7 - 9 months in the womb there is NO reason the child be killed in the womb for the health of the mother rather than be delivered. Have a good one :) YW.
@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg No. Insurance will not force you to carry a child if your life is in danger. 	Yes, Many mothers make tough decisions for their children once the child is born. None of those decisions REQUIRE them to kill the child 7-9 months in the womb when they could deliver the child. *shrug*

@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg You admitted you can not find a single case where the child could not be delivered rather than killed. Just stop. I give you 1 more tweet then I am ignoring you bc you are either purposely obtuse or a troll.
@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg WHAT!?!?!? That is the point There is NO decision to be made. If the mother's health is in danger for carrying the child you deliver the child. You do not kill the child in the womb...
@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg You continually switch terms. A baby who is dying once it is born &amp; a mother late term aborting said baby in the womb are not anywhere close to being the same. Stop pretending it's the same. And Insurance will not force you to abort a child rather than deliver it...
@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg A baby needing compassion is not the same as a mother who kills that baby in the womb at 7 - 9 months in the womb. Sorry, it is not and acting like it is changes nothing about the reality.
@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg Give me a single reason. A single case where the baby is 7 - 9 months in the womb and the mother has to kill it rather than deliver it and it would save the life of the mother.  #IWillWait

@ann_sappington @JennMGreenberg Yeah ummm the point is if the child is late term and there is a health issue for the mother, you don't have to abort the kid you can deliver it and then if it is on life support , removing the life support is not same thing as killing the kid in the womb. #SorryNotSorry

@DaBirdDaPlane YES!! Or uncontroallable laughter when nervous like interviews or something. That's me.
I also have a face that kind that either says exactly what I think w/out being able to help it or it is the exact opposite. Example: my hubby often thinks I am smiling while I am really in pain or wanting to cry.  #FaceCrimes are gonna be really awful for me!
@JeanPaulZodeaux I know I am weird. I am very social if put in social situations but they drain me and i try to avoid them as often as possible. LOL
As a person w/ Resting B*tch face ( I look mad/ sad unless smiling) This whole #FaceCrime wave where we hate ppl for looking like they are smirking or w.e is gonna hit me pretty hard. I may become even more anti-social... and I wasn't sure that was even possible. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

@aggierican we both decided it was weird. LOL
She's an eclectic music listener and kind of constantly has some kind of music in her ears so yeah she knows both Weezer and TLC. We both decided it was weird. I'm also sad no INXS on the covers album seeing the other ones they did. New Sensation woulda' been cool.

@TarheelKrystle @liars_never_win He was suspended for making a vegan joke.... 	As if we did not have enough reasons to hate vegans.

I honestly don't get why PPL cannot separate personal dislike for him vs. the need to be informed &amp; policy positions. I don't personally like Trump &amp; find some of his policies have been great and some of them kinda sucky. I still want to hear what he has to say.
@Debt49095828 I don't even like Trump, but even if it was Obama saying I can keep my healthcare form a hospital I would have wanted to hear it... Like I said, might just be me.

@physicsgeek YEP! WW was awesome. This one is great, a few really bad dialogue scenes but overall i loved it and the visuals were some of the best i have seen since Avatar.
Action scenes are good. Dialogue is a little cheesy but that's a superhero movie thing. I liked it over-all. #Aquaman is perfectly awesome &amp; carries the whole movie. 3 out of 4 stars bc the visuals mostly make up for anything crappy. / end :)
I TOTALLY FORGOT WHY I SIGNED INTO TWITTER, TO BEGIN WITH! 	#Aquaman  #NoSpoilers Review. 	It is the fun easy going DC movie. It's like if Thor were a little rougher and more grungy. haha. Visuals are fantastic. Like super fantastic. /1
@dgramlin1977 see tweet #2 :) agree he is masking it w/ other crap.
@thevoice325d Understood.
@Gardrail You too!
@thevoice325d It just empowers the left to try and make more bans ect via executive order if they are ever in charge. IDC about the bump stock itself, never used one, never will have a need to but how ppl just don't care bc of who did it is wild.
@Rifleman4WVU @NRA 100%
@aggierican https://t.co/kcw8iYDrik
@sheilaaj YOU TOO!
@redcar_tenken @Ramani33_ Dude has been WAAAAAY better than I thought he would be. I think he has done some really great stuff. But that does not mean we just say ok breh, no biggie when he does sucky stuff.
@Rifleman4WVU @NRA Agree. I don't use them either but that does not mean the President has the right to ban it via exactive order / federal regulation. If it were Obama ppl would be going nuts or celebraitng it in HIGH numbers and we all know it.
@TxLobo Been there many times. https://t.co/EbK9YErQp9
@jess_reign_bass I really don't have to expect something to happen. 	The only thing I expect is for the govt. to stay out of my business &amp; for ppl to be as upset about principles no matter who did it. But like i said, maybe that's just me and I am ok w/ that.
RT @Ramani33_: @Artist_Angie And he did this by executive order. It’s another move that used to cause outrage (but it’s Trump, so...meh)
@physicsgeek I couldn't fit it all on 1 tweet ❤️
@bartonlukester Sorry but it's not about want. I don't use them either. 	Still shouldn't be a fed. regulation and I'd say that under ANY President.
@jess_reign_bass WOW. I love you but GOP won't be in charge forever. It is totally opening the door for more regulations and if you trust ANYBODY in Govt. (regardless of affiliation) to not want more of your rights, we need to hang out more. :P
@scasey79 https://t.co/lBV1GlG13X
@redcar_tenken I saw a few but nothing like what it should have been and would have been had it been Obama.
Ok, I am going back to my black hole. I just could not go another day w/out saying how much that move sucked. Maybe I will see you guys after New years. 	*fingers crossed* 		I do hope you all have a GREAT Christmas and a Happy New Year.
&amp; by y'all I obviously don't mean the few hundred ppl I DID see being honest about it and saying it sucks snot or even the lefties who thought it was cool, At least they are being consistent w/ their principles and not changing bc of who did it.
Trump officially banned bump stocks 2 days ago. If that were Obama my TL would be filled w/ outrage on 1 side &amp; celebration on the other. I know I've been absent, but what happened to y'all? I think it sucks. I'd think that under Obama too, but maybe that's just me... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
PPL have questions about "losing" a kidney. It's still there &amp; functioning some, just not very well, so she will have to go back on dialysis. Saying lost it was just brief description for twitter. Any prayers you can send our way will be appreciated. ❤️
My Mom has been really sick. She lost our kidney I donated to her 8 yrs ago and  &amp; I have had a Lyme recurrence and other health set-backs. I'm simply not feeling very witty or Angie-like. I'm ok. I'm just gonna be low key silent on the social media for a while. Much love / end
I have tons of messages. Thanks so much for caring about me and checking on me. I really do appreciate it. IDK when I will be back to twitter regularly. I have to be honest with you all.  /1

For me being a HUGE Harry Potter fan I give it 3.75 stars out of 4. There are some things you will roll your eyes at but over all if you are a fan you will love it, if not, meh, prolly not love but you can still enjoy it.  / end
I don't think anyone would go in &amp; love it if they don't already know something about the world. Overall it has great action, cool "OMG MAGIC" moments and I think Newt is a lovable character and we learn more about him. Also seeing Young Dumbledoor and McGonagal is pretty cool /3
Things that make you feel immersed in that universe again. If you are just kind of a HP fan but just for Harry and not the whole universe you are gonna get annoyed and probably bored and confused. It's not a stand alone kind of film. /2

@Gormogons @molratty @secjr112 @ihate_everyone2 Agreed. They obv. never felt it trying to suck out their souls. It's like a flipping dementor. Cats had to be where J.K.R. got the idea for those things. :) https://t.co/cP5rNyPBOL

@molratty 😂😂😂 I swear I did not have anything to do with the writing of this article or the headline.
@rjeff74 Agree. I will probably drop netflix for Disney if we are being honest. We will see how it goes though.
@JamesWhomever I understand. It's pretty awesome so far though. 	I am sure that there will be another way to see it eventually.
@rjeff74 Agree. No way to keep them all. I do not do hulu or prime as it is. I will see what the cost is on Disney. We will see.
@JamesWhomever NO!!!! and it's really good so far. I mean it could suck as it goes along but so far 3 episodes in and it's good.
So total Nerd Alert, but I have been watching #Titans and it is really good. It's only available on DC streaming but I swear the 5 bucks is worth it for this show. I think the same guy that does #TheFlash is doing this one. Anyway. It's awesome 3 episodes in. #NerdStuff
@MCampbell1041 100% agree
@Ivanv1 I really liked Defenders, and that is good you kind of need to know what happened in Defenders in order to pick up on where we start w/ #DaredevilSeason3
you find yourself feeling sorry for &amp; caring about some of the ppl who are supposed to be bad guys. Overall fantastic season and a great series. This season is just as good as season 2 which to me was going to be really hard to meet. So final verdict 4 stars easy. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
In this season that seems to drag along and not be as good as the others but it was necessary for some backstory. I absolutely loved the villain almost as much as the Punisher but not quite. They did a great job of rounding out all the characters and  /2
I promised a review on #DaredevilSeason3 when I finished, so here you go w/ #nospoilers. I love this series in general. Since season 1 it has been top notch and Season 2 was the best! Season 3 definitely held up the same standard.  I thought it was great. There is 1 episode /1
@MccordJavon @ThatIsNotRight_ No, I don't tend to even give randoms a reply. So consider yourself lucky :) 	1. I'm libertarian. 	2. I plainly stated nobody is responsible for anyone actions except their own ( that would include Obama). 	3. This will be my 2 tweet limit on idiocy	4. Bless your heart. 😘
@MccordJavon @ThatIsNotRight_ Yes. I think Trump is a king. Totally... did you even read the tweet? hahah

@jannyfayray @molratty @FoxNewsSunday @ShepNewsTeam 😂😂😂
@ThatIsNotRight_ @FoxNewsSunday @ShepNewsTeam Good Point 	I still say nobody's rhetoric, no matter how annoying, is responsible for another individual's actions other than their own.

@Muelann @FoxNewsSunday @ShepNewsTeam LOL thanks! :)
And anyone who follows me for any period of time knows I am not even a Trump fan. I admit when he does good, but I call him out as being full of crap on a regular basis. Still can't blame him for the actions of ANY individual other than himself. Period.
Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday just showed @ShepNewsTeam the door. WOW! Good for him. If Bernie Sanders isn't responsible for supporter going rogue neither is Trump. Rhetoric can be reprehensible but still not responsible for individuals making own choices. This isn't hard.
@Rifleman4WVU ME TOO! SJWs would go insane over that movie now though.

The best thing about @SusanSarandon is #RayDonovan and I don't even agree w/ her on much politically, but at least she's not a complete partisan hack like @DebraMessing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@Isla_78 Same. I waited tables all through college. Made great tips, but I did smile. LOL
@steelerfanaticx @PolitiBunny Magic 8 Ball says Mostly True. :P https://t.co/hmr51aICNK
@Isla_78 LMBO! That is hilarious!
@Isla_78 😂😂😂	Seriously! If i am not smiling everyone thinks i am mad or sad! 	Hence why I smile in all my avis! haha
@RufusPutnum @_wintergirl93 @aurora_g96 I give it 2 days before you tell me i was right. :P
@_wintergirl93 @RufusPutnum @aurora_g96 😂😂😂	😍😍😍
@RufusPutnum @_wintergirl93 @aurora_g96 Nah. I am the worst.
@aurora_g96 ❤️❤️❤️
@Emily30Red NP. I did not take it as anything bad at all. :) No worries!
@_wintergirl93 @aurora_g96 ❤️❤️❤️
@discus74 In your defense I have been gone a lot lately so it's ok :) LOL
@Emily30Red Oh I agree. She was totally joking though. We had just talked about how she looks just like me and our faces look mad or sad if not smiling right before that. If it was anything other than us knowing 100% it was just a joke w/ right timing she'd be grounded. LOL
@kamando @aurora_g96 She's awesome. You'll like her. :)
@discus74 No, it really was just the convo we just had. When I am not smiling if I just have resting face, I look mad or sad. It's just my face. LOL
@RowdyRick73 @PolitiBunny 😂😂
@RollCall79 She's a lil' bit sarcastic... https://t.co/90FXOpYvz7
@BSBiker @aurora_g96 Probably not, being honest, she and I are kind of known for being a bit clumsy and messing normal things up in regular life, so I would not count on it. 😂😂😂
@oaty_3 She's a mess &amp; lucky I love her. LOL
Random but you all should really be following @aurora_g96. Honestly one of the most underfollowed accounts on twitter. She's hilarious. Also, a sweet person but don't tell her I said that part.
Daughter: MOM Are you ok?	Me: Yeah, Why? 	Her: You look so sad. 	Me: This is just my face.	Her: Yeah, I guess I'd be sad too. 	Me: ... I can't even be mad, it's funny, so I just have to walk away. https://t.co/jJVPBUb74W

@scasey79 It really is and it is sad bc they did so many GOOD things. Woner Woman is awesome, casting for Aquaman and Superman were perfect. Batfleck sucks and they have issues tying stories together in movies.

Why do facebook people suddenly think I like them enough to "donate to a charity" in honor of their birthday like they are a celebrity w/ some kind of influence? The only reason I typed Happy Birthday was bc FB TOLD ME it was your birthday, it's not like I remembered that crap...

@lordthx1139 As for the too old thing it goes back to my original tweet and from experience i can tell you there is no case of childhood sexual assualt that is "too old" to be brought to light. If deemed unusable let victim or police decide.
@lordthx1139 No. None apply to issue at hand. Nobody is asking for the things you keep bringing up. PPL (mostly victims) are asking for the cover-ups to be exposed. If nobody was found guilty of anything there is no cover-up, if victim doesn't want to be exposed also not called a cover-up.

@lordthx1139 Nah. Nobody is asking for counselors records or confessional records. They want to know who accused who and when and how they covered it up. It's not hard. It's not even a gray area.
@lordthx1139 some of the records are not confessional records though, the records are all about the accusations and the cover up. IDK anyone who wants confessional to be opened.

@Flipper628 I am sorry :(
Anyway, just my 2 cents but the Catholic Church should release all of their records. Shine a bright light on the blackness. God will be fine. Don't protect evil of the past, it just makes it evil of today.
@Tryxt3rocks Sorry for all the typos. even worse than usual, ❤️I'm a bit annoyed :)
@Tryxt3rocks They have great records and one of the reasons i wnat tehm to shine a bright light on the mess. The church will be fine. Peopel do not define the church.
And this is not an indictment against Catholics. I love the Catholic Church. I myself am nondenominational and the person who hurt me was NOT Catholic. I love the tradition and suport the Catholic Church. I just want them to open records and shine a light on evil of past.
@Isla_78 I don't understand why they keep covering it up either. They could open their records and shine a light on it. Shining a light on the evil of the past would not hurt who the church is today.
I'm not saying the church is responsible for individual's actions, but defending the cover-up and protecting the ppl who did this, no matter how many years ago is not ok. No matter who did it or what they are trying to protect.
I just saw a defense of the church bc "it was 50 years ago for some of the cases". As a victim of childhood sexual assault by a man who was supposed to be a "man of God" I can 100% tell you I'll feel the effects of it my entire life. Even after therapy, healing &amp; forgiveness.

@AposticMark As God as My witness, I will never tweet like Blanche again.
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 I'm not a Republican, have never been registered as one. Always registered Independent. I'm a conservative who leans libertarian.
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 No Way! I don't want anyone silenced. Even the libs. :-)
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 never. LOL
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 It's not a free speech issue bc it is not the govt. but there is a technology information monopoly so silencing voices greatly inhibits the user experience and that sucks but yes I see multiple sides to the issue and I want ALL voices to be heard, even the ones I disagree with.
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 Also, that is not the same thing as a person individual not listening to someone speak. Company such as apple is actively suppressing information for its users, and that's fine, but it still is sucky and scary.
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 I think a private business has a right to do as they wish. I still find certain companies w/ a information monopoly not treating all customers the same scary. But I don't say that's a free speech issue, it's just censorship and annoying.
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 What was the agreement? LOL I just asked when I said it was wrong?
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 When did i say it was wrong?
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 Actually, I have said if you RT infowars nuts into my TL I will mute or unfollow, bc they have every right to say w.e but I don't gotta respond, so yeah, I have called them out as nutbombs fairly regular and also been pretty consistent in saying they have right to be that way.
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 Can't think of anyone I would not be willing for them to speak so that I could highlight why their ideas suck or are dangerous. I prefer to shine a bright light on ignorance and evil and debunk it and destroy it not hide it.
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 Yes bc, I am obviously a very UNreasonable person.... I mean I even answer ppl I never spoke to, don't follow, and obv. don't agree with in a fairly calm fashion and I don't even call them names or stuff. :/
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 I already told you where I stood on infowars thing you just refuse to listen. I never said infowars was about free speech, it's private company not govt. but I can still think it's scary for this stupid climate where ppl to want to silence others constantly for disagreements.
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 When you aggress upon another person property or rights it is not ok, and nobody said it was... I think you are barking up any random tree to hear yourself type. You're simply moving goal posts to see if anyone bites.
@Rhogart NICE!
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 TOS has nothing to do with my tweet? 	You're conflating 2 separate tweets. 	If you want to read what I tweeted about #infowars you will see I say a private company can act as they wish but I still think it's scary how many ppl are cheering silencing voices bc they disagree w/them
@DFHobbs @hcmv007 I'm saying that all ppl have a right to be ignorant if they wish and even if you disagree w/ what they say if you don't protect their right to say their stupid stuff one day you might be the one the side of more ppl wanting you to be silenced. It's not a difficult concept.

@SlickeryTrigger yes and i don't want to silence ppl who disagree with me... 	You are just trying to convince me bc they want to do that i have to be the same as they are and I am not ever going to be the same as them. No matter who tells me i must.
@SlickeryTrigger I didn't say nothing. I said soemthing. You commented on it. 	You just disagree w/ the fact that I don't want to destroy thier voices bc they want to destroy mine.
@SlickeryTrigger Umm no. They were fighting for literal independence form an opressive govt. This fight is wether ppl compete on an information platform level or not... Can a business model fight a apple or google if they offered platform w/ no censorship. That's the question. It's not govt.
@SlickeryTrigger No you want to force thier submisson and not allow them to disagree or have a voice unless they agree w/ you. You want to be the person decidng what speech is good or bad insteead of them. I want them to be free to be stupid if they want. I'd fight it for tou, them and me.
@SlickeryTrigger I'll do the same thing i have always done. I will fight it head on. I will shoot it in the face if i have to, but I will still fight for both myself and them to be crappy ppl w/ crappy ideas if they wanna be. :)
@SlickeryTrigger So again you don't even have the same fight I have. You want to FORCE submission same as they want just different sides of the coin. I want you both to be able to have your crappy ideas broadcast to the ends fo the earth.
@SlickeryTrigger No I would have been a colonist. In this situation though,there is side 1,2, and 3, and possibly 4. Forcing ppl to sit down &amp; shut up is not ever going to be somethign i subscribe to. Stand up and yell about it, fight about it, even if you are losing or don't. Either way. :)
@SlickeryTrigger It's not that we didn't fight or we are not fighting. You are just insistent that the fight has to be or must be the same way they did it by FORCING them to have no voice. That's not a fight i am fighting. I am fighting to have them say what they want, and you, and me.
@SlickeryTrigger That doesn't even make sense. LOL 	My saying you both suck for trying to FORCE your ideas on each other and censor each other IS taking a side, it's just not yours or thiers.
@SlickeryTrigger THat's my entire point on this Alex Jones thing. I think information monopolies are deciding it rather than society. It's not a hard concept to say a person can not compete with Apple or google to get out information.
@SlickeryTrigger You do that. I'm never going to say freedom to express your idea is wrong. 2 sides of same coin are doing that to each other. I just wanna say when one of y'all suck w/out being censored for it on information platforms that would be impossible to compete with. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@SlickeryTrigger Yes. I think they can say that and the free market ( the white ppl or w.e person the stupid busness decided to offend) deals w/ them by not participating in buying thier product which brings me back to if information monopolies should have same rules as regular business.
@SlickeryTrigger So your answer is let's be authoritarian fascists like they are so we can force them into submission bc they did it first? That doesn't make it right and it still wouldn't fix the root issue. It just changes which person gets to decide what speech is acceptable.
@SlickeryTrigger The only speech/activity I'm for limiting is if it hurts or agresses upon another human like murder, assault, pedophelia, ect. Other than that, if someone wants to be an a-hole w/ bad jokes or stupid ideas, I am fine with it. I'll happily engage as to why their idea is stupid.
@SlickeryTrigger ok. :) I'll fight for rights of ppl to say anythign they want. I am just trying to figure out how I convince them to fight for mine as well. I'd prefer not doing it by being what they are and forcing them to it by being authoritarian facists. But yeah that's prolly just me. :)
@tedwallingford 😂😂
@SlickeryTrigger I didn't say it was anything wrong with it. 	I said it was scary. 	I simply believe ppl should have the right to say w.e they want and I'd fight for them to do it even if I disagree w/ what they say.
@SlickeryTrigger IDK that saying a private business can act as they want and we should compete by offering a service they do not provide (free speech) is taking the high road or losing. Is it? The issue is the information monopoly and if they have same rights as regular business.
@SlickeryTrigger I don't think it is possible to win a war of ideas in a climate where freely expressing your ideas depends upon almost monopolies of left-leaning corporations. I am very torn on this on bc I 100% believe in the right of business to act however they want.
@StillCrankyAF 😂🤣😂	It does not bother me. hahah	It's just goofy. 	As am I.

The speech you disagree with or find reprehensible is the most important speech to protect.
I am all for private business running a business as they see fit, but same time cheering on death of freely expressing ideas on social media platforms is pretty nuts. And FTR. I'd say this if it was some whacky left leaner too.
I'm not even an Alex Jones Fan and I do not think #infowars is helpful to promote actual conservative ideals. The number of ppl cheering the death of his account pretending it a good thing, whether you agree with his speech or not is fricken scary.

@UnrealAllan I'm ok w/ them reversing Roe v W like you said that judgment seems extra reading into the constitution and i 100% agree it shoudl be left to the states.
@MolerJason Semantics are important sometimes &amp; defending the mantle of a movement I've associated with since I was 16 or so seems worth the battle. It's ok if it's not to you. But words do have meanings. That is my main point &amp; we can still agree on 90% of stuff &amp; fight the left together
@cabbieBot @Taxpayers1234 @PolitiBunny @TomiLahren No person or govt. entity has the right to de-person another human. 	This is a tactic used to make it ok to kill it. The right to life is THE most important right and all other freedoms MUST start from being alive.
@PolitiBunny 😂😂😂
@teapartytempest I'm not any political party. I lean libertarian but I used to consider myself a conservative. If it still means what it used to mean i still consider myself that. If not then I am just politically homeless Prolife Independent who preferes small govt.  :)
@MolerJason I just want ppl to use words that have the proper meanings. As I stated I want ppl to defend her as a Republican all day and I am cool w/ it. I have defended her a few times. But conservative used to mean something. It either still means it or it does not.
@GreekVikingX It does have an agreed meaning. 	it has for over 40 years as a collective group meant prolife and small govt. 	Just bc you don't agree to those does nto mean it did not have a specific menaing in the past.
@UnrealAllan You are actually agreeing with me. You just say the states need to decide it rather than the fed and i am fine with that, and it woudl still make Roe unconstitutional.
@teapartytempest I at no time had any vitriol. I actually requested ppl defend her as a Republican and use the proper term and even in the 2nd tweet stated she undoubtedly has some conservative views but that one was not one.
@TheComboBreaker It has been established for 40 years by the members of the group who call themselves that,  the word has a meaning &amp; if the meaning changed it is up to the group as a whole to decide that. It used to mean prolife &amp; small govt. as major tennats.
@MolerJason It's not judgeship spot. Why is this hard to understand? 	Conservatism for the past 40 years has meant specific things. 	It either still means that or it does not. 	Same as if you call yourself a cat it does not make you a cat.	WORDS HAVE MEANINGS.
@teapartytempest you certainly can call yourself that but words do have meanings and you can also call yourself a cat it does nto mean you actually are a cat. :) YW.
@teapartytempest fiscal conservatives are just called Republicans and the mantle of "conservative" has usually in the past 40 years been reserved for ppl who hold both fiscal and socially conservative views especially regarding pro life and small govt.
@MolerJason Then you are confusing republicanism with conservatism. They are not the same. THey agree on about 90% of stuff but one is not the same as the other.
@MolerJason The word conservative has to have a meaning and the ppl who call themselves that should make it clear what those principles are, and for over 40 years tthose tennants included Pro Life &amp; Small govt, if that changed then no, I am no longer one and that is fine. :)
@teapartytempest Words have meanings. 	Why is this hard? 	In order to be a liberal you would have to hold a certain # of liberal views and vise versa. 	Why is this hard? I really don't get it. 	CONSERVATISM HAS TO HAVE A MEANING OR ANYONE CAN CALL THEMSELVES ONE.
@MolerJason However if you do not do one of those 3 things that seem ot be the only requirements i am aware of to being a Christian then no you would not be one. 	See how simple this is? Words. Have. Meanings.
@MolerJason Christianity only requirement are 3 things that i am aware of: 	1. Believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God died for your sin. 	2. Admit you are a sinner and need Jesus to pay for those sins.	3. Repent and seek forgiveness of those sins and accept Jesus. 	So no it does not.
@Patriot_Musket PURITY TESTS ARE WHY YOU ALL LOSE YOU GLOBALIST ABORTION SCHILL!
RT @Patriot_Musket: Capitulation on abortion is not winning on abortion.
@RealLiteSleeper I can make an argument for pro-life being libertarian as well but it is not officially in the platform.
@TheComboBreaker How is it a purity test to say these are the tennants of conservatism and if you don't subscribe to tehm you are not conservative but we can still agree on 90% of stuff? LOL
@cabbieBot @PolitiBunny @TomiLahren Actually there are no rights if you hae no life so you kind of have to start there but, that's cool. You do you, just do it without calling yourself a conservative and we can get along fine. 😘
@UnrealAllan So you just think the states should legislate it? Fine. That really changes nothing about my point of eitehr thinking a life should be protected or not. There is no kind of pregnant thing in the middle on that point.
Words have meanings guys. Either conservative has a meaning w/ a platform &amp; tenants to subscribe to or it does not and if it doesn't "conservative" has no meaning. But in 2018 that is no surprise. 2018 is not concerned with truth, it's concerned with feelings.
@UnrealAllan i disagree. we legislate morality all day every day and if you believe an innocent life is being murdered it is exactly the same as if any other innocent life is being murdered and should follow the same rules.

@UnrealAllan what's your stance on laws against murder?
@MolerJason And yes there have been basic tennats accepted as conservatism since goldwater and a fight for small government, lower taxes, and prolife have all been in the accepted tennats since before i ever called myself one and the REASON i called myself one. :)
@MolerJason Well, conservatism has to have tennets that are accepted as conservatism or else anyone gets to call themsleves that (including Hillary) and it means nothing. 	Words have meanings. 	If the word means nothing then fine nobody is conservative and it is cool too.

@Major_Skidmark Agree
@JereCTN Yep and i am totally fine with it. We can agree on like 90% of stuff. Where i have the problem is when they muddy up the waters trying to call somethign conservative that is not.
I'm not saying she may or may not have some conservative views. She undoubtedly does, but being ProLife and being SMALL Govt. are HUGE requirements of carrying the mantle of conservatism. This is not however a requirement for being Republican or Libertarian.
Defend Tomi as a Republican all day, it's cool, but her stance on abortion is not conservative. Either a life is human, and protecting it as an innocent is REQUIRED or it is not. It's like you can't be kind of pregnant, you can't be kind of #ProLife ...

@lordthx1139 @BlueEightySix you are reading what I wrote incorrect. Yes, they have to charge you your state rate, hence the problem there are over 12,000 sep counties / codes and it is an unreasonable expectation to ask ppl w/ no actual building in that state to do this.
@JustinRWalton @LennyGhoul We are not gonna agree on this at all. It is not ok. IDC how you want to try to get around it or rationalize it and ppl used to know taxing the internet was stupid. No offense to you. It's just not ok.
@JustinRWalton @LennyGhoul you aren't taking into account various rates or counties for each state over 12,000 of them and who knows if you want to source that out or not. You are the one held responsible for being out of compliance and 20 mins is a low estimate depending on what you are selling and where.
@LennyGhoul @JustinRWalton I don;t think peopel who have not had to do this understand the difficulty of having to do it for 50 states not to mention if it changes by county.
@JustinRWalton that is not free money that is you doing free labor for a state you do not live in unless you make a profit for the time. ANd i don;t think you have ever filled out a quarterly sales tax and use for 1 state much less 50 or you would not think of it that way at all.
@JustinRWalton No it isn't. Unless I am making a profit form doing that service i was still taxed with my labor and loss of time on my business. That is not a win. It is forced taxation by another state.
@JustinRWalton Offering a discount on the burden and taxation of a business to do the job of a state they do not live in does not make it ok... IT IS NOT OK.
@JustinRWalton That's what this case does, it opened door of forcing that onto the business rather than consumer. They want it to be hard. In Roberts dissent he makes the point with more than 12,000 different state &amp; local taxing districts, the ruling would present a “compliance challenge”.
@JustinRWalton Ummm no. If I live in IOWA I do not have to collect and remit taxes for CA. It is the job of CA to do that and raising the cost of doing business for small business is a big deal it is going to not make a difference to huge corps but it will hurt small business.
@JustinRWalton IDC if it happens or not it is still not my job ad a citizen in 1 state to collect and remit taxes for a different one. That is taxation without representation. I get no say in how that money is spent.
@JustinRWalton Nah, I do quarterly for my own state and it will be time consuming and it can be very costly. Sure 3rd party software ro paying someone, but it can change quarterly by county and for 50 states. It willl really hurt small business a lot.
@JustinRWalton that is how it is supposed to be before this case. PPL are supposed to claim their online purchases and apy own sales and use btu were not doing it so now this ofrces that labor and cost onto the business.
@JustinRWalton no you don't understand. The business is going to have to collect, charge and remit those taxes. IDK how they plan to enforce it. do we now have to do quarterly sales and use for 50 states? Also have apparatus to calculate it all.
@JustinRWalton A state I do not do business in or have representation in should not be able to force my labor, therefore, a tax on me by having to calculate, and know tax code for 50 states collect and then remit that tax to each state. It's an unreasonable expectation for small business.
@JustinRWalton https://t.co/Hj68v7iHZQ
This day is awful. 	Charles Krauthammer. :(
@HandleIsRandall @Courtneyscoffs No, they are not enforcing YOU pay it they are forcing labor of a business not doing business in your state to collect and remit tax FOR A STATE that they have no representation in.
@JustinRWalton I gotta run but there is a long thing on my TL on one of the tweets that explains why it is. I may not be back on until way later if you don't find it i will look for it.

Everyone is all IMMIGRATION! THE KIDS! IMMIGRATION! 	And I am over here looking for tea to throw in the lake across the street because TAXATION IS THEFT but TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION IS EVEN WORSE ... #SCOTUS #InternetSalesTax https://t.co/qP1sr1CgRP
@BlueEightySix remove the e. IDK why that got there. LOL 	I am mad so my typos are worse than usual. 😂
@BlueEightySix I'm sick to my stomache. :(
@_grammar_ All my typos and you pick that? 	OK grammar Police. LOL
@Red_Eye_Robot They could. They will not.
@BlueEightySix It shoudl still be up to each state to collect it's own taxes. I should only have to do it for the state i live and operate in.
@BlueEightySix They could. The issue is it is a tax and undue burden to force me to collect tax &amp; remit to state of CA. It is up to CA to obtain thier own taxes. I have no representation there so i should not be taxed via labor or any other form to collect and remit taxes for them.
@BlueEightySix I'm not asking to elimintate sales tax. I am saying it is not the burden of a business in a different state to collect it fro the state with representatives they did not vote for. It is a tax and undue burden on the business who does not do business nor get represented there.
@BlueEightySix well that is up to ND not small businesses not in ND!
@MBrandt3 @JeanPaulZodeaux @OrdyPackard And what about sales and use? Do we now have to file this quarterly for 50 states as we have to obtain taxes for all 50 states? This is totally taxation without representation.

@MBrandt3 @JeanPaulZodeaux @OrdyPackard no. the state is obligated to collect sales tax from businesses in thier state. my business is not in that state. it is not my obligation.
@OrdyPackard @JeanPaulZodeaux It can take quite a bit of time especially if you have to update it each quarter as some states change tax rates according to county ect. and it can change quarterly and you will have to update it for all states all the time.
@MBrandt3 @JeanPaulZodeaux @OrdyPackard The state you do not live in is putting it upon you to collect thier tax for them &amp; calculate that tax making you spend man hours and time and money doing so therefore it is an open door of taxation without representation. John in Iowa does not need to collect CA tax.

@BlueEightySix IDC how they think they are helping it is wrong. It will destroy small business to the point only huge corporations can handle this kind of calculations and keep up with this. It is unreasonable &amp; taxation w/out representation.

@deplorabledora @OrdyPackard This opens door for say CA to say I as the business owe them sales tax bc CA person purchased my item on the free web even though i do bus. in Iowa or wherever.  This will help. Norquist is not my favorite on everythign but he is right on this. 	https://t.co/Hj68v7iHZQ
@JudsonMcCulloch @BlueEightySix The person in the state (the business) already pays sales and use taxes every quarter as a small business as they should.
@BlueEightySix The purchase is not being made there. The purchase is being made on the free web. It is created and sold in the state of the person who is selling it and that person is responsible for taxes in that state not the purchaser.
@deplorabledora @OrdyPackard Yeah, I am sorry but me being forced to pay a tax to CA when I make my product in another state and sell it in that state as well is not fair. It's called taxation without representation and it sucks.
@BlueEightySix It is mind boggling and stupid and it is 100% taxation without representation. Norquist is not my favorite person ever but he has it right. Link to his article: https://t.co/Hj68v7iHZQ

@BlueEightySix Yes, it is. California can tax ppl until they leave then tax you who does not live there for doing business in your own city bc someone bought something from you and they are in CA.
@BlueEightySix Technically it opens the door for ppl you did not elect to tax you so it's wrong.

@OohMyNose @JamesWhomever Dude - read the thread, that was 1 of the examples given of why ppl who commit suicide cannot be held responsible for actions as they often can't think clearly, make good choices, or trust own thoughts. It was 1 example also listed, bipolar depression &amp; severe clinical depression

@OohMyNose @JamesWhomever I'd say anyone who actually commits suicide had some sort of debilitating depression or they would probably not kill themselves... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@JamesWhomever I am glad you've seen ppl who could overcome it but I know ppl who could not. Feel free to disagree, IDC, but if you never saw the true struggle of a person unable to make clear thoughts you don't get it, and that is ok, but you simply don't get it.
@OldRifleman If you are ever in that place and feel totally alone please DM me. 	You are not alone. I get it. I understand you can't just make it better. 	I am not always on twitter but i will answer as soon as i see the DM.
@JamesWhomever Then you didn't have the kind of depression I'm talking about. You still made coherent thoughts &amp; could trust your thoughts. Very different. No offense, Just you obviously were able to make choices &amp; some cant. Like how some diabetics are insulin dependent while others aren't.
RT @redsteeze: The absolute gravitas of how Krauthammer could dismantle an argument so effortlessly is something we haven’t seen in awhile…
@JamesWhomever but I mean you are allowed to disagree, it's fine. It is just a lack of understanding. Most ppl really can't understand it unless they have experienced it or someone they love has experienced it and they saw it 1st hand.
@JamesWhomever It's not like when some ppl get sad, or standard depression where you can do talk therapy, it literally affects the ability to think/see things clearly. Bipolar depression, Severe depression, or Suicidal thoughts caused by meds, those aren't issues you can just "push through"
@keving31 yup and ppl who just get sad is not the same as a person with severe debilitating depression or bipolar depression or medication that is supposed to help with depression but forces suicidal thoughts in their head instead. :( Complete lack of understanding.
@JamesWhomever Those who are in a debilitating state of depression and often ppl who are on medication that has an adverse effect forcing suicidal thoughts into thier head have no ability to make good choices. And not everyon who has diabetes gets kidney failure either.
This is a complete lack of understanding regarding debilitating depression. A person who commits #Suicide  IS NOT ABLE to make good choices, it is part of the illness. It's like condemning a diabetic who dies from kidney failure for not making insulin... :( https://t.co/quTJDX4A7Z

#MondayMotivation #SCOTUS made the right decision! 		Now if you are a person upset about #MasterpieceCakeshop you should not support them and you should support a bakery you DO LIKE. 	Go forth and practice your freedom of association and be proud! 😘😘
RT @rlg100619: @Artist_Angie Should take one from Star Wars and call someone "Scruffy looking nerf herder!"
@thebestwolfeman IDK why but i tend to call ppl goats who I don't like and it seems to work just aas well as any curse word on the satisfaction scale. LOL
@PhillyTalk 😂😂😂	I'm vulgar.
@StonerBrewingCo 😂😂😂
@StonerBrewingCo 😂😂😂	Didn't you give me 1/2  a point for a-hole?
Pretty sure I should be the goto person for #alternativecursewords as I've been using them since before Twitter existed but Forget y'all. Ya bunch of marshmellow fluffin' snot suckin' a-holes.
IDK why this HT is trending again 2 years later but this is still my favorite. :)
@mudflap54 @wildauburnrebel @PolitiBunny Thanks to you both. You are very kind. Thank you, I appreciate the compliment. I'm horrible at accepting compliments so really ty. :)
@snapdragon4561 @iamsambee I only speak for myself. Never asked anyone to agree. Don't care if they do or don't. It's the beauty of being an individual who thinks for myself. You are welcome to have others speak for you. Not a problem, it's just not my thing. Thanks!
@TFinn82 @glenn21701 ❤️❤️
@yieldright https://t.co/Uwkgja0Zat	❤️❤️❤️
@yieldright I loved it. :) I did a mini review day after i saw it but i thought Chewy/ Han relationship was fab and it was very true to originals. It deserved a better opening weekend. After 20 mins i stopped saying he is not Harrison Ford and just enjoyed the movie!
@yieldright Did you like it?
@TomOlson8 @HowardStern Aww. Taht is sweet. TYVM. :)
@TomOlson8 @HowardStern I don't want to force companies to fire ppl for speech. Freedom of association means they get to make their own decisions about who they hire or fire and why. TBS shouldn't have to follow ABC rules of employment. That's my thing.
@TomOlson8 @HowardStern It probably won't. Equal opportunity does not = equal outcome and I am 100% ok with ppl pointing out double standards but we should never expect equal outcomes. It's just not realistic.
@Fore_not_four TYVM, Appreciate that.
@TomOlson8 @HowardStern I'm a total free speech advocate so I am fine with anyone saying anything they like whenever they like a man, woman, or whatever.
@El__Bohemio Well Imma chick biological and however else i need to be one. hahaha

Good Evening. I am a woman and NONE OF YOU SPEAK FOR ME. 	Not you, Not Samantha, Not Roseanne, and some of us would appreciate you all stop trying to force us into groups with labels and groupthink. THANKS! https://t.co/P40u7lTi9K

Fun review from @lisathegeekmom on #SoloAStarWarsStory 	(bonus: she mentions me1) YAY :) 	https://t.co/EqlWHtpfol
@ScotsFyre @RadioHostRick @DatOtherMichael @AshevilleBrewin 😂😂😂
I've been busy but both #RoseanneBarr &amp; #SamanthaBee have the freedom of speech to make any jokes they want even if offensive &amp; both their employers have the right to fire or keep them BC of freedom of association. We have the freedom to watch something else.  Easy. 	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
FTR I feel the exact same about #RoseanneBarr as I did about #michellewolf (imagine that). 	Comedians can make any joke they like, but they better know their audience and there has to be mutual respect if there is a personal target or it can go really bad really quick.
Ambien is no joke. I don't cook. Like ever. When it's my night to cook we order pizza or make a sandwich. I made a whole breakfast, scrambled eggs and bacon and just put it all on top of the fridge on Ambien. Not saying it can make you racist, but it totally made me cook.

@Manderskat @RantyAmyCurtis @Dawnsfire @hboulware @aggierican @ChelieinTX @molratty @JHolmsted TYVM!
Overall it felt very true to the originals without being cheesy and it added some new info with a twist at the end. Easily give it 3.5 stars out of 4. If you like Star Wars you should like it. It's not gonna change your life but it was a lot of fun and very nostalgic / end
At 1st you keep saying to yourself "This is not Harrison Ford" but after about 20 mins you stop saying that and you actually do accept that he is young Han Solo. The Casting was AWESOME. The relationship between Han &amp; Chewy was THE BEST! / 2

@HuskerHaHa I was fine with them kneeling did not bother me one bit, but I am not a sports person other than UFC.  Yeah, they can still do it by not going on the field. I'm just saying the NFL making a rule bc it was affecting their bottom line is in NO WAY a curtailing of free speech.
Guys, an employer setting rules for the workplace is not curtailing FREE SPEECH. The players are still allowed to protest and say anything they like on their own time. They just are not gonna get paid to take a knee when it was hurting the league's bottom line... https://t.co/Ff8QReucXm

@rlg100619 NO WAY!?!?!?
@keving31 Highly Annoying!
#IfSiriAndAlexaMet 	They could share double the amount of your personal information with the government!
Political news opinions:	1.  I find Tomi Lahren highly annoying &amp; she shouldn't get stuff thrown at her in public	2. I find Trump highly annoying &amp; he should be allowed to block ppl on his twitter account 	3. I find football highly annoying &amp; private business can make work rules
@keving31 LOL! IDK why but that cracked me up.
In honor of #WorldTurtleDay Mitch McConnel will be acting as our human representative to bridge the gap. https://t.co/jn1qdb1vzm
@DWCDroneGuy @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I think the ruling pretty much narrowed it down to particular public officials so it would not apply to regular ppl on the forum. even though that is stupid.
@WoMyers63 RUINED IT FOR ME! TOTALLY RUINED!
@lordthx1139 @DavidLimbaugh but they are still available even if blocked all a person has to do is log out and look at it. not that hard.
@WyldStalyn5150 FREE is always a plus. LOL
@Corduroyalism @dgramlin1977 come on rogue one was great even if you did not like last jedi. and no matter if you hate any new ones the originals still are always gonna be awesome.

@AngelRTalk @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ok but with this ruling, I am saying he can switch that and get around the ruling the way I am reading it.
I'M SEEING #SoloAStarWarsStory TOMORROW NIGHT! 	WOOP WOOP! https://t.co/iOYhNhfnXp
@PeterF0x @realDonaldTrump @POTUS TY!
@AngelRTalk @realDonaldTrump @POTUS but if he used POTUS to just tweet general stuff he can say anything he wants as DJT personally and IDK how even this stupid ruling can prevent that.
@PeterF0x @realDonaldTrump @POTUS NO! SERIOUSLY!?!??! 	You have a link to that? 	JEEZ
@doublee64 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS so as long as he just tweeted direct tweets there he should be able to block anyone he wanted from his personal account. That is how it seems to me.
#HammeredDisney	Snow White Russian and the 7 Drunks.
This is the dumbest ruling I have ever read in my life. 	If it is based on Trump being a public official, he should still be able to block ppl under personal account @realDonaldTrump but not under @POTUS, right?
