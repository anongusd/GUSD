@KnightGeorgeJr @KCStar @SenFeinstein People don't typically go to prison for committing a misdemeanor, which is what entering the country without documents is. And no one should ever be jailed for the perfectly legal act of seeking asylum, yet those parents and children are also being separated.
@KnightGeorgeJr @KCStar @SenFeinstein Yes, I reported on that, and it was appalling. Unfortunately, this is even worse.
Unfortunately, even @SenFeinstein's law wouldn't necessarily stop the Trump administration from separating asylum-seekers from their children.

@ccpecknold @ebruenig but they're sacrificing their own lives, not someone else's. Scorsese has ratcheted up the degree of difficulty.
@ebruenig @ccpecknold I need to read the book. But I can see why Scorcese put the cross in his hands at the end, and had him give in to prevent others from being tortured. That makes it so much more morally complicated than that he gave in to save his own hide and never looked back.
@ccpecknold Not gains eternal life that way, but having done so can never gain it? How does that line up with the constant possibility of salvation?
Loved this movie but is it really the mark of a superficial Catholic to be willing to endure anything but unwilling to let others die? Since no one alive has died for faith, we don't know what we'd do. And you're saying his apostasy made later salvation impossible? Don't see that https://t.co/NMk5hJsPch
