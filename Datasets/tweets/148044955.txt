@NateSilver538 Any worries about voter fraud are a PR problem.
@NateSilver538 The integrity of our actual voting process is simply not something people should be afraid of in most States. Basically the only thing needed in the other States is paper records. That's it.
@NateSilver538 An election system with decentralized local administration, any process at all to register or check identity and challenge dishonest behavior, and which keeps paper ballots stored and ready for investigations or recounts is **extremely** secure.
@NateSilver538 I'm a nuclear engineer and could tell plenty of stories about PR problems with nuclear power plants that definitely are not substantive problems. Instead, I think election security/fraud is actually one of the best examples in the US right now.
@NateSilver538 Giving them the right information at the right time to react to problems and make good decisions takes real skill.

@atomicnews @lukeweston @arclight If we can associate nuclear energy with dependable, that's a win. @NEI_media, get on it!
@lukeweston @arclight @atomicnews The story you just told is good. Tell it often. That's better than inventing a buzzword.
@lukeweston @arclight @atomicnews If there's a single word for that, I haven't heard it. If you want to make one up, you might want to pick a word that doesn't already mean something else. We **do not** help our case by blurring definitions or appropriating terms from history or other industries.
@atomicnews @arclight In most regions, you have to assume it won't and maintain more reserve capacity.
@atomicnews @arclight It's just as big a problem when the timing of peak renewable production and the timing of peak demand don't match.
@arclight @atomicnews Then, the nuclear community tells the world that nuclear plants are better than others *because* they're 'baseload generators'. There's a lot to unpack there, and most of it *is* misleading IMO.
@arclight @atomicnews The problem arises when people conflate some subset of load with specific generators. There's no technical reason to do that.

@seferry @Robotbeat @thompn4 Can't get away from that. You have to balance the last bit of demand with supply somewhere.

@Robotbeat @seferry @thompn4 Germany just did. More renewable MW available in 2016, but fewer MWh on the grid.
@Robotbeat @seferry @thompn4 You might need to be able to go a whole year with unfavorable weather and low renewable production.

@thompn4 @DeepShort7 @JesseJenkins No way around it: We really need proper legislation to price and/or trade CO2.
@thompn4 @DeepShort7 I agree. CAA matters more than who wrote it. CAA probably isn't the right tool for regulating CO2.
@DeepShort7 @thompn4 @atrembath @jsfreed @sbrinton @JesseJenkins No substitute for looking at specific states and scenarios, which we did.
@DeepShort7 @thompn4 @atrembath @jsfreed @sbrinton @JesseJenkins CPP is complicated, weird structure, different treatment of tech classes.

@CindyDPishere @leahmcelrath @drvox Would expect fierce opposition from MIT profs if outside group wanted hiring influence.
@CindyDPishere @leahmcelrath @drvox MIT has accepted Koch money, will check what it paid for. At least one building.
@CindyDPishere @leahmcelrath @drvox FSU-Koch situation is insane. Been in school a long time, Texas / MIT, never seen anything like that.
@leahmcelrath I agree, there's a lot of sloppy material out there. Most academics aren't focused on public comms; risk is hard to explain.
@leahmcelrath You all should see our buildings/offices. Weirdly shabby. Google Img search MIT - we only have 1 nice building.
@leahmcelrath Trying to picture the scene where our profs get asked by donors about texts and such. Donor gets kicked out for sure.
@leahmcelrath PhD candidate in Nuclear Engineering. Started on thermal engineering, moved over the last ~3 years toward economics.
@CindyDPishere @drvox Not familiar with this landfill but very curious. Link?
@CindyDPishere @leahmcelrath @drvox MIT grad student here. This does not happen. Most of our texts are 30+ years old. We'd love new books!
Fascinating new angle - Our professors are brainwashing us! Never saw grad students cited specifically before. https://t.co/epMdft5riN

Political battles are exhausting. But we now have signs of support from several faculty to save the @TexasSPS lounge! #TexasSPS
Gaining support and momentum to SAVE THE @TexasSPS LOUNGE! Thanks everyone that's been signing in! Show them this space matters! #TexasSPS
Help save the #TexasSPS student lounge! Send your thoughts @TexasSPS and follow the discussion on our Facebook group!
@superotterman That makes good sense. Maybe the distinction is whether you're talking to the person/group/entity or about them?
Awesome, @guycrazygenius ! Many thanks. Still loving grad school?
Potential novice Twitterer fail: is it preferred to highlight a group with a hashtag #TexasSPS or an at name @TexasSPS ?
Just spent a long afternoon planning for a full week of SPS business and cleaning and improving the lounge! Check it out tomorrow! #TexasSPS
I'm now on Twitter. That is all.
