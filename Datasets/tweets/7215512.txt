The warming Arctic is changing the weather near you. Wait, what? https://t.co/hUujzn4WSY
In short, renewable energy can be great, but it’s a lot more complicated than just “good” or “bad.” And how states define it has a real impact on what they actually accomplish.
Maryland counts burning trash as a top-tier renewable. This means a trash incinerator in Baltimore — single largest source of industrial air pollution — received more than $3 million in renewable energy subsidies in 2015.	https://t.co/BShX7AsTTa
When states set renewable energy targets, they define which types of energy to include. Some state definitions are a little weird.
Renewable energy means a whole lot more than just wind and solar. In some states, the definition of “renewable” might surprise you. https://t.co/gj1eUbZUOz

Check out our interactive map here and please don't forget to vote! https://t.co/w6Wv8stOge
New Jersey 7th district (64% worried): this district stretches from NYC’s western suburbs to the banks of the Delaware River. The river serves as the water supply for more than 15 million Americans. It’s also a source of worry, from polluted runoff to and frequent flooding.
Texas 32nd district (65% worried): this district northeast of Dallas saw unprecedented rains and flooding this fall, and an extreme drought and heat wave this past summer resulted in a remarkable uptick in heat-related hospital visits.
Texas 7th district (65% worried): this district west of Houston is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change in the form of freak storms. It has suffered extensive flooding from Harvey and at least two other storms in the past five years.
Florida 26th district (67% worried): This is a special place where both candidates have explicitly backed climate action. Carlos Curbelo, the Republican co-founder of Climate Solutions Caucus faces Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, former associate dean at Florida International University
California 48th district (67% worried): This district includes much of coastal Orange County, and the local midterms are about as melodramatic as an episode of The O.C. This coastal district is a hotspot in the debate over offshore drilling.
We took that data and put it on a map! Even in those districts where folks seem less concerned about climate change, a majority of people worry about it. And in a handful of tight races, climate anxiety could be a decisive factor.
We analyzed how climate anxiety might affect who gets elected in 2018’s tightest congressional races. It turns out worry is one of the strongest predictors of how people respond to climate change. https://t.co/w6Wv8stOge

“The residents were here first,” Yvette Arellano from t.e.j.a.s told Grist. “This is their community.” https://t.co/OYKtL3Hjv9
The burden of fighting for their health rests squarely on the community itself. Residents are voicing their concern at public hearings and creating innovative tools to gain information and keep those in power accountable.
Now, Valero is seeking a permit that would allow its Manchester refinery to emit 452 tons of hydrogen cyanide. Valero always emitted the neurotoxin, but the new permit will allow almost nine times the emissions currently spewed out into the air.
In recent years, oil refining giant Valero has bought out residents in order to grow its petrochemical complex. Last year, Houston agreed to sell Valero several Manchester streets near its refinery to expand their facilities.
Manchester is not the only community bombarded with potentially harmful chemicals. According to the Environmental Justice Health Alliance, nearly 40 percent of the country lives within three miles of a chemical facility. #EJ4ALL https://t.co/OYKtL3Hjv9
Community members are grappling with the negative health effects of living so close to these hazardous facilities. Manchester residents are actually at a 22 percent higher risk of cancer than the overall Houston urban area.
For this "fenceline" community, which is overwhelmingly POC and low income, a witches brew of toxic chemicals wafting into their spaces is a daily reality.
Houston, we have a problem. Houston’s Manchester neighborhood is ringed with toxic industrial facilities, including oil refineries, chemical facilities, and a metal recycling plant. https://t.co/rQ7VaWLURw
