@latimesopinion I applaud the proposed studies. We need to look at how the pipeline was established to look at how people with disabilities were routed to jail instead of medical treatment. What organizations &amp; groups have contributed to this epidemic. There is a racial/ethnic element also.

The result is more people w/ mental illness in jails &amp; many in street, self-medicating, traumatized.		https://t.co/irs74xCalb https://t.co/epGiDxDMVs
