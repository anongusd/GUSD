@FlowWithTheGo81 @Lindafblue @Patrickesque @BernieSanders @NRA The point is that about as many people are dying by firearm in VT and in IL, which includes Chicago, so, what is your point? A dead person is dead whether the gunshot came in a violent crime or some other way.
@CetaceanFreedom @Patrickesque @BernieSanders Whoops! Thank you for catching that error. It is indeed per 100K residents. I don't think I can stand rewriting all those tweets though...		 https://t.co/LjH0DbTcvh
@FlowWithTheGo81 @Lindafblue @Patrickesque @BernieSanders Right. Because Chicago is the red herring @NRA likes to use, omitting the fact that majority of Chicago crime guns can be traced to sellers in Indiana, Wisconsin, and other states with laxer laws. Why we need to #UpdateBackgroundChecks #HR8 https://t.co/AjNVGrAJJd
@Rbird820 @Patrickesque @BernieSanders You are welcome. See the state-by-state breakdown here: https://t.co/s4eQFT1HGP
@Kzsoze1 @Patrickesque @BernieSanders All gun deaths are violent, and there is very little difference in the numbers between VT and IL.
@SpearIt @mercernole @Lindafblue @Patrickesque @BernieSanders WA is in pretty good shape. OR less so, but they don't have a flank of strong states to the east as VT and NH have to their west and south.
@mercernole @SpearIt @Lindafblue @Patrickesque @BernieSanders Nope. These numbers are per capita and thus comparable. Most crime guns in Chicago are bought in WI or IN, states with weaker laws than IL.
@SpearIt @Lindafblue @Patrickesque @BernieSanders It is much harder to smuggle guns into a port than over a state line. Hawaii has the lowest rates of gun death per capita in the nation, largely because it is very hard to get guns there in the first place. IL has high gun death because of weaker laws in WI and IN.

@LaurieArnston @jennifergarlen @peter_joffrion @JohnHMerrill @MilamForAL As a poll worker I can assure you an explanatory poster would be much more effective. Too many variables for us to be able to tell a voter why they are labeled inactive and too many glitches in the system. It relies on a postcard delivered to a mailing address.

Yup. Vote Alabama. Every 🗳 counts! #alpolitics https://t.co/e6nEpo3ZwS
@LaurieArnston @jennifergarlen @peter_joffrion @JohnHMerrill @MilamForAL Absolutely. But we poll workers don’t know why they are marked inactive. Every time I work the polls there are voters who seem to match all requirements to be active and yet aren’t. All we can do is ask them to fill out the form and hope SoS processes it.
@LaurieArnston @jennifergarlen @peter_joffrion @JohnHMerrill @MilamForAL He still should have been given the form to verify.
