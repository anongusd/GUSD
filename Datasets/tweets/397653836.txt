@B52Malmet The decline of gospel truths by religion has more to do with moral decline than sinners entrapped by sin.  There was a reason they made separation of church and state the first amendment. There parents and grand parents had fled from where church and state were mixed. dark ages!

@jax_persists Same god that chose Hitler chose this POS. Most likely the god of this world (Satan). One thing I do know, it was not the God of Biblical Christianity. The Christian Right are not Christians! They are Religious Nationalist who have more in common with Nazis than Christians.
@TellTheTruth2me @SenSanders @NRA You are wrong...believe the lies if you want.  If Sanders had not run and roll purges, uncounted votes, polling place closure and other Rep/Russ red state election fraud activities prevented, she would be POTUS right now. What you say only has value in light of them using it.
@TellTheTruth2me @SenSanders @NRA First she didn't lose. I am saying without Sanders campaign of division where his supporters didn't vote for Hillary, we would have over come the Republican/Russian election fraud in red states.  She would not only have had a big popular vote but gotten the electoral vote to.
@RWPUSA @HillaryClinton @CNN What real unity looks like is that Sanders does like Hillary and not run at all! Instead he and she get behind the candidates and then jointly get behind the primary winner.  Now that is what Sanders should be doing in 2020. That's what good for America in unity looks like.
@RWPUSA @HillaryClinton @CNN Dear Democratic Party &amp; members		We feel it is only fair to let you know now that we will NEVER vote for Bernie Sanders for President, the person responsible for putting a traitor in the white house! 		Anyone but Sanders!		Sincerely,	Clinton Democrats	Never forget 2016
@TellTheTruth2me @SenSanders @NRA No that is simply not true! That would have no effect at all except for the Sanders and Republican lies and propaganda machines using the nothing burger.  Just look at since then how others have done so and it is no biggie with no machine driving it.
@SallyAlbright @Uterider @KAMALAMODE @succuvy I know there is because I am one. We are the majority in the Democratic Party. It is about policy not Bill or Hillary. It doesn't require a Clinton to run to be a Clinton Democrat candidate. Middle class out economics, socially liberal and centrist elsewhere. They set those parts

@joncoopertweets Three reasons why Traitor in white house: #3 is Comey &amp; Republican hearings, #2 Russian/Republican election fraud in red states, #1 reason was Bernie Sanders attacks and disunity campaign that had voters setting out or voting 3rd party. Never will vote for Sanders! no 2016 redux!

@joncoopertweets What real unity looks like is that Sanders does like Hillary and not run at all! Instead he and she get behind the candidates and then jointly get behind the primary winner.  Now that is what Sanders should be doing in 2020. That's what good for America in unity looks like.
@krassenstein Did you then switch and watch the Jerry Springer show to complete your trash entertainment  TV viewing beige?
@thehill If you don't know the difference between a Social Program and Socialism, you need to get out of government! So tired of Republicans selling the lie that if one supports social programs it makes one a Socialist. Our national and states democracies couldn't function without them!

@thomaskaine5 I am open to any of the nominees except Bernie Sanders.  We will not vote for him even if he gets the nomination.  I bet there would be millions with the same thought.  We will set out!
@HenryJGomez @KAMALAMODE No question that red states are committing election fraud.   Red states are now blatant about it. FL, GA, SC, NC, TX, AZ,  roll purges, missing voting machines, closed precincts, gerrymandering, uncounted absentee and provisional ballots.
@thehill You do if you think you are above the law.  If you think you can shoot and kill someone on times square in view of everyone and get away with it.  You would be stupid enough to write a check for hush money.

@chrislhayes He was talking to their base that follows the 3 stooges:  Hannity, Limbaugh and Jones.
@tdraicer Newspapers still have investigative journalism along with op-ed. It's not the papers fault that the "Jerry Springer" TV media only cherry picks garbage.  No 24 hour news network is really news! It is one big Jerry Springer show trash entertainment. Jerry is more honest, tells you
@BernieSanders Do not run! We 39 million strong will not vote for you! 2016 is unforgivable!  Be like Hillary and not run for unity sake! You are not the only one! We have many great candidates! Pick one and unify through them!

@TwitterMoments @PaxNostrum The levels of "above the rule of law " acts being done by Republicans and this administration must be seriously addressed.  Arrests, convictions and sentenced has to be done so that democracy is restored to our country.
@ABC @JimAngone Sarah Sanders lips are moving, of course she is lying.  He is as guilty as sin in conspiring with the Russians! Just like red states are guilty of elections fraud in collusion with Republican/Russian election fraud.

@AOC @yayitsrob Our infrastructure has need attention for decades and if we don't do something it is going to fall down around us.  It only makes sense that while giving it our attention that we update it green!  Green is not only good for planet but it is most up to date tech out there!

@dcpoll @AmericanWoman8 @jkbjournalist Jeffrey Epstein and Trump partied together a lot according to Trumps own words on the Howard Stern show.  There is no doubt in my mind that both should be in jail for child rape as serial sexual predators

@RedTRaccoon @AmericanWoman8 Someone has to step up and do this at some point! 2018 was even worse then 2016 in red states! Republican election fraud in red states will just get even more blatant.  The 2016 election should have been called invalid because of Russian/Republican election fraud in red states

@reesetheone1 @KAMALAMODE @BernieSanders Three reasons why Traitor in white house: #3 is Comey &amp; Republican hearings, #2 Russian/Republican election fraud in red states, #1 reason was Bernie Sanders attacks and disunity campaign that had voters setting out or voting 3rd party. Never will vote for Sanders! no 2016 redux!
@SarahKSilverman You watched a different 2016 Democratic Primary then I did.  He used Russian and Republican attack lies and then pouted at the convention.  No his token campaigning even had caveats.  He has since admitted the Russians were using him and knew it fully at the time.

@cbouzy @KAMALAMODE Three reasons why Traitor in white house: #3 is Comey &amp; Republican hearings, #2 Russian/Republican election fraud in red states, #1 reason was Bernie Sanders attacks and disunity campaign that had voters setting out or voting 3rd party. Never will vote for Sanders! no 2016 redux!

@TellTheTruth2me @MrDane1982 I disagree, Comey had the least effect!  I mean all the hearings and hours of testimony did that work.  2 things Bernie Sanders(who Russia was pushing) and Russian/Republican election fraud in red states were to blame. With out Sanders we would have even over come their frauds!

@Socratic1 Election fraud isn't! Republican/Russian election fraud in red states done by those states election officials is blatant  and rampant.
@RepDMP @HouseJudiciary @HouseGOP The NRA and Republican worship of guns is just BS! We can have comprehensive universal  background checks and the second amendment both.

@KamalaHarris Attack only? You are down playing it.  They are disappearing fast! I am literally appalled, disgusted and embarrassed by these useless &amp; deplorable Americans for elevating a narcissist, sexual predator, traitor, racist and criminal with over 200 convictions of legal record.
@BookishOne44 I am literally appalled, disgusted and embarrassed by these useless &amp; deplorable Americans.  Trashing one of the great public servants who has zero charges or convictions, despite their efforts and elevating a narcissist, sexual predator, traitor, criminal with over 200 convicts
@thehill another lie to the useless &amp; deplorable.  And they swallow it hook lie and sinker.  Sadly nothing new!
@OMGno2trump Or just lie that it is the greatest deal ever....  Finish the wall..lol  You have to start a new spot not just replace worn out places that have been in place for decade.
@ColMorrisDavis @SenThomTillis @GOP Well that little tidbit has ended his hand shaking days.  I wonder how those who have known him are reacting to this sharing....all washing hands very thoroughly.
@DesignationSix @NBCNews Sure it is, I just saw a picture of it today.  They were all standing side by side holding hands.   Oh you meant a real wall like his original vison he campaigned on like that of the game of thrones or the walls of Babylon where 4 Humvee can drive side by side on top of it....lol
@MrDane1982 @ManMet80 Being a Clinton Democrat does not require a Clinton to be running.  Just a candidate who is going to apply Clinton middle out (not trickle up or down) policies, practices and understanding for countries governing.
@MrDane1982 @ManMet80 You are so right, We Clinton democrats will not support anyone who attacks Hillary or anyone they would not support.  If they do pick a candidate to stand behind, that is who we will all vote for!
@MrDane1982 @ManMet80 I am a Clinton democrat since voting for Bill the first time and think they have the best policies for America.  I still think Hillary Clinton along with Bill have the best grasp of what is good for America. Still I prefer she mentor and stand behind a candidate and not run.
@thehill Can we keep them there?  Can we get the rest of the useless &amp; deplorable to join them there in a place they can do less harm
@stonecold2050 Who?
@bowmanmitche Can't think of a better use of their time. If we can get all of them to go there and stand around and never leave would be the best thing to happen to America since November 2016
@Specneedsmom4 Now if we can just get them to stay there.  Better use of their time than the BS they usually are doing.
@BryanJFischer @POLITICOMag Why do you have an objection to a single person being President?	Why do you have an objections to a gay person being President?  	little late to worry about a sexually deviant being in the White House.  By any standard the current occupant fits that description.
@BryanJFischer @johniadarola @POLITICOMag They do not need special rights as they have the exact same rights as all other Americans.  We just need to bring to justice all those who try to take those inalienable rights away or act out in a bigoted way against an fellow American. We will defend our fellow Americans!
@BryanJFischer @POLITICOMag What America is not willing to except is bigots like you spouting and spewing forth hate.  As a Christian I would not accept your America or your unchristian Christianity. I as an American can accept a single President and I can even accept a gay President in our CIVIL government

When Trump/NRA crazies threaten their civil war and they have guns, remember:	1.3 million law enforcement officers	1.3 million military personnel 	800 thousand reserve military personnel	all sworn to protect and serve Americans. Small % of gun toting wacko's vs that is No match!

@ktumulty @romerca It is not voter fraud, that is a Republican term that is mythical.  It is however Election fraud that is all to real in red states.  One is done by voters(again mythical) The other is done to voters or their vote.  It is criminal and why are we not convicting Republican persons?
@4YrsToday @OnlyWhiteTiger This is a MAGA kind of thing to say....Not American values! UnAmerican!, Anti-patriotic, Anti-democracy!  not taking poll only commenting on your lack of human being

@thehill I could agree with that plan!  Send you and all your cult members down to stand guard all along the 2000 miles in the middle of nowhere boarder is at least more high tech then your archaic wall plan.
@TeamPelosi Speaker Pelosi thank you for being there! You are now America's best line of defense against the 2016 election fraud coup that the Russian/Republican perpetrated against America. We pray daily that God gives you the strength to save our democracy from these traitors!
@SenKamalaHarris Why are there bull dozers tearing up a national butterfly preserve?  Who is running those bull dozers?  Is the Army guarding or building without congressional approval?
@thehill Bring it on loud mouth parrot! Nancy is just waiting to bring reality crashing down on Russian Asset#1s head, again and again!
@senatemajldr The American people did not hire Russian Asset#1, Putin did. The Russian/Republican election fraud in red states is a national emergency.(not to by confused with Republican mythical voter fraud)! Clinton Democrat economic policy implemented by President Obama makes economy hum!
@senatemajldr Americans are now paying for your historic wealth grab(tax bill for the rich) Regulatory scam is truth. sadly the denial of the truths by our own intelligence agencies says you are parroting Russian assets#1 lie about ISIS. You haven't done anything to stem the tide of opioids.
@senatemajldr @POTUS haha Traitors will be wearing orange is the only thing before Russian asset#1 along with all his other Russian assets cohorts.  Destroying America time has come to an end thanks to Speaker Pelosi! A real American public servant is once again in charge, Thank God!

Myself &amp; children never attended public school only Christian education but support public ed. and religious teaching has no place there. The wall between church &amp; state must be absolute.

All U.S. citizens We the People must stand up as patriots for democracy against assets of a foreign power.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I can't express my level of anger at traitor #1 and Senate Majority leader McConnell because of their heartless selfishness. They are destroying our country, hurting millions over a archaic wall. Nobody wants these two or their shutdown. Free the hostages! Dump Traitor #1 &amp; Mitch
@GOP @realDonaldTrump ROFLMAO.  Oh yeah you're the party that makes its own facts...lol  that's right ignore the polls, the emails, twitter, the news, and listen to your co-Russian asset squatting in our white house.  2020 will be here soon enough and will not have forgotten at all!  Say bye-bye to DC

@robreiner The Republicans and the christian right no longer believe in American democracy or equality.  There are leaders of both who will do anything for more power including election fraud and treason.  2016 was a invalid election because of how much of this they did.
@robreiner Sad to say but it is not just Trump who is conspiring but the whole Republican party hand in hand with christian right leaders have been going down that path since 2000 elections. Election fraud is real, voter fraud is not! Now so is a comprised conservative leaders for power

@RashidaTlaib @senatemajldr McConnell make no mistake about it, We hold you and the traitor in chief 100% responsible for this totally unnecessary government shut down.  All the harm to our country is all yours and his fault!  The "wall" is archaic security! Your "wall" would only be a monument to racism!

@CarolVernon7 @LindseyGrahamSC @ClemsonFB He took support from the same sources as well.  Compromised and complicit!
@srichar65196771 Some of them are as well as they received support from the same sources.
@tribelaw His base and the Republican party knew beforehand and didn't care. Many of the Republian Senators and congressional leaders are even complicit as they have taken support from same sources. This is way more serious then the American people think.
@ChrisCoons @FoxNewsSunday No! Never FAUX NEWS!  The white nationalist network is not a news network. It is closer to the Jerry Springer show than news.  Propaganda station for racist, traitors and liars.

@EdKrassen Christianity has become the religion our fore fathers fled from. It is quickly losing the "reformation" truth by trading them for power with a corrupt government.  Religion and government both lose when they mix and mingle power. Both become corrupt and persecuting bodies.

@SenatorLeahy The 2016 election should have been made null and void a long time ago! With all the election meddling and election fraud we have no idea who really won!(do not confuse election fraud with the mythical voter fraud). Roll purges, gerrymandering, lost ballots uncounted are all real!

@clairecmc @jhadleyconrad We do not need this boondoggle boarder wall!  The vast majority of Americans do not agree with this administrations attitudes towards asylum seekers and immigrants in general either in country or those wanting to come to this country.
