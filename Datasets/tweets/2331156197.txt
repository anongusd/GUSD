@HannahRSchwarz Check his Assembly account from NYS BOE site. Also it's second hand, but, if he received donations from the Blue Dog Dems, then it's tainted $ because they get NRA donations. Last person to say this was blocked by Brindisi on Twitter.
@ShopSoarBlue @GOP @NRA I completely agree, the downfall is, he is Schumer and Pelosi hand picked person. Even Gabby endorsed him. Totally crazy.
@ShopSoarBlue @GOP @NRA Guy running for Congress in the NY 22ND has a A+ NRA rating and was endorsed by them in 2016 when he was re-running for his NYS Assembly seat. He also recently said no ban on AR15 or similar weapons, after he marched with the students.
@EvansMichaelJ @claudiatenney I would trust Brindisi more if he hadn't sent himself donations from his State Assembly account to his Congress account, which by FEC laws can be considered illegal.
@M_Lavendr @claudiatenney @ABrindisiNY If one actually read about this, it's a new ploy that is being done to gain voter support. It's called do or say anything to get elected. Also it's being done where Pelosi isn't well liked. She didn't hand pick him and send him large donations for nothing.
@downwithtyranny They won't dump them, which is unfortunate.
@GabbyGiffords @jimmykimmel Gabby, you endorsed Anthony Brindisi and he has a 100% rating from the NRA and was endorsed by the NRA in 2016 when running for NYS Assembly. Also supports AR15 sales. üò≤	One would hope you would pull your endorsement of him since he is in the back pocket of the NRA. ü§î

#2018IsHere and I hope to see less bash campaigns and more how that person is going to make a difference if elected. 	It's the year of the #Resistance not the year to run the guy in oval office style campaign. Make a impact on #integrity and #honesty. ‚úå
@_pamcampos I cannot wait to see what 2018 has to offer for you! Your a inspiration for so many, me included! Your destined for greatness.
@RaceforNY22 I know there will be no impeachment. Otherwise one would have already been done. All I see is candidate's and politicians playing to the public's fear. No how they will fix things to erase the fears.
@RaceforNY22 Besides whom ever wins has to contend with 2 years (unless there is a impeachment) of knowing nothing will be signed unless approved by him or some desperate behind the doors deals selling their soul to get something passed.
@RaceforNY22 Nice take on 2018 and 2020. Very glad to have stepped aside to avoid being front line of the ****show. The phone call and behind the scenes grimy tactics and harassment was enough for me. I prefer to discuss how I would fix things than bash someone.

@BeMoreWestmo @RaceforNY22 @PatrickHMadden @JonLipe @GOP @ABrindisiNY @RepTenney Hate to say this Ron, but to me your wrong about the accussed having to prove their claim. That is why so many people stay victims and stay silent. 	My word against your word is hard to prove and most people tend to brush it off as a who cares. That's why people get away with it
@RaceforNY22 @PatrickHMadden @JonLipe @GOP @ABrindisiNY @RepTenney My last thought on this feed 	I believe people should be held accountable for what they say or do. 	When we want something so bad we ignore any accusations that make us no better than the accused.	Meaning we are also just as guilty because we turned our backs on someone!
@PatrickHMadden @RaceforNY22 @JonLipe @GOP @ABrindisiNY @RepTenney When they go lower, go higher (Courtesy of Michelle Obama üòÉ) 	I have found people will believe what they want even with any form of proof ex: scientific, audio, witness.
