Great article about the Medal of Honor Review for #AAPIVeterans provision that I included in the #NDAA17 #AAPI https://t.co/ecIBcshsxX
During the #KoreanWar and #VietnamWar, #AAPIVeterans were discriminated against due to the color of their skin. #AAPI
#AAPIVeterans were often under-awarded or not awarded at all for actions of valor that go far beyond the call of duty. #AAPI #Veterans
I intro'd HR 3870 last year, it has 86 bipartisan cosponsors. Lets call for action for our #AtmoicVeterans. https://t.co/u7FrNsb5is
W/an approximated 35% rate of cancer, families have lost many of these #AtomicVeterans, &amp; those who survive battle health problems everyday.
Though Congress it, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act doesn't cover #AtomicVeterans who cleaned up radioactive debris. #AtomicVets
H.R. 3870 provides for the treatment of #AtomicVeterans who participated in the cleanup of #Enewetak Atoll. #AtomicVets
I honored Memorial Day by remembering our #fallen &amp; calling for action on H.R. 3870, the #AtomicVeterans Healthcare Parity Act. #AtomicVets
Read my full statement honoring our #Fallen and calling for action for these #atomicvets here→https://t.co/8eRmAJiYNq
The #AtomicVeterans Healthcare Parity Act, I intro'd would provide these benefits to surviving Atomic Vets. #MemorialDay2016
There is a group of #veterans, many still alive today, who served our nation honorably and are now suffering because of it. #MemorialDay2016
To honor our fallen heroes we must renew our commitments to those currently serving our nation, many who are in harm's way. #MemorialDay2016
Every year, we gather today to remember those who gave their lives for this nation. Let us never forget their sacrifice. #MemorialDay2016
#MemorialDay2016 is a reminder of what makes our nation the greatest in the world, citizens willing to give everything for our democracy.

Last week #Congress responded by passing inadequate funding that fell short of the $1.9 billion asked by @POTUS to combat the #Zika disease.
Now, nearly 1,400 Americans, including more than 275 pregnant women, are confirmed to have contracted the #Zika virus.
