@TuckerCarlson Tucker thanks for your reporting on the possible impeachment of	Judge Brett Kavanaugh. I was not aware Nancy Pelosi is planning to impeach  Judge Brett Kavanaugh
@TheFive The Democrats plan to impeach Judge Brett  Kavanaugh.If the House go	Democrat this is who there going after.
@LouDobbs The Democrats plan to impeach Judge Brett Kavanaugh in 2020.Why  now I do not have answer for you or anyone else who may this see on Twitter.
@OANN  California  tried to solve the illegal immigration problem with prop	187.  The prop was both supported and opposed. I saw your ad on Your channel.	I do not know what would end the issue.
@JimInhofe Sir Can you tell me why the Senate Democrats want to impeach Judge	Kavanaugh in the year 2020? I understand the impeachment process the House of Represenatives go first with articles of impeachment.What I do not know is why.
I hope they do not. this means @realDonaldTrump will have to replace Judge Kavanaugh with another nominee. https://t.co/KF7GmJnvAE
According to @OANN  The Democrats in the Senate want to impeach Brett @mlonpolitics  Kavanaugh after he gets into The Supreme Court.
Anyone on either lists in my twitter account.Consider this when watching the	Kavanaugh hearing was a rape kit done on any of  the three accusers. You will	not hear the answer. A Rape kit proves their was a sexual assault.
