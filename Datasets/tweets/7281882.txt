So I guess always double check the email address you use. Don't put in what you think is a throwaway address because sometimes they're active. Don't misspell it in case someone else has the misspelling. You can't trust any company to not send a stranger your private info
I contact the companies when I can and try to get my email removed, less because it's annoying to get them and more because I don't want to be liable because their digital security is lacking. The responses I've gotten are so telling and I'm not at all shocked at massive breaches
like, booked flights and hotels and caterers and stuff for weddings and other events. Mobile accounts, crypto accounts, bank accounts. The opportunities I've had to be an asshole and cancel people's plans or steal identities have been numerous.
I have an email address that's a common word @ gmail and I've gotten maybe thousands of emails since 2004 that were meant for other people, sometimes because people used the email when booking something or creating an account

@omgnatalya @princessemoji But yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure whatever is fundraised directly though fb can be written off by them, or be added into total funds raised by that bullshit charity organization zucc and priscilla started
@omgnatalya @princessemoji I did too lol but I made the donation viewable to just me and also donated to an organization doing the same thing in a different state because fb made me feel icky. And raices ended up offering up a massive check outside the White House so cool knowing our donations went to that
@omgnatalya @princessemoji lol I got into a full fucking fight with someone who made a pointed status about not seeing everyone on their list donating to that massive raices fundraiser and I was like look you don‚Äôt get to lecture people because you feel superior about giving an organization $10 via fb
@omgnatalya @princessemoji I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs actually true but considering how the Red Cross has gotten away with so much shit it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me
@princessemoji @omgnatalya I think they also don‚Äôt have to reveal exactly how much of what they get is actually donated so like, even if it‚Äôs just a dollar they could be keeping like 80 cents of it

@jakemcintyre @Nicole_Cliffe This is the only answer I‚Äôll accept and it‚Äôs only partially because I love Lilith so much I want a shirt of the Frasier logo with her name on it
@Nicole_Cliffe I deeply love FRASIER but I refuse to believe he was so wealthy and so much of a celebrity having a call in show on AM radio that he could afford an Eames chair, let alone that whole apartment
@VartIsCool lol even not being wealthy and taking advantage of services that exploit their workers is being complicit in the system (even if it‚Äôs necessary like otherwise not being able to afford food/clothing) so idk how anyone with real wealth thinks they or their family are somehow exempt
@_pnasty I kind of hope this person‚Äôs co workers are fully aware that they‚Äôre a trust fund baby and make sure to talk extra shit about the rich around them on purpose
I'm so fucking suspicious of people who say their grandparents/parents arrived with nothing and got super rich just by working. How many people in the same situation did they fuck over? How many people paid for your wealth by being underpaid and overworked? https://t.co/iiZQOAZC8W
