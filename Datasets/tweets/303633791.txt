#Dodgers celebration feels very low key. Maybe 9-1 score? Celebration is also missing @SteveLyons12.
@becksvotto Majority my tweets re #baseball &amp; #HermosaBeach oil drilling. Both important to me. Next time, I will check b4 replying. Sry
@becksvotto My tweet before yours was about CBA &amp; decrease in oil rev projections. Mobile didn't show convo chain so thought re that.
@JimmyGomezCA @Dodgers Lucky you to represent the #Dodgers and @Dodgers Stadium. My dream is to someday throw out 1st pitch. Someday!
Congrats @Dodgers for your 2014 NL West title. @TheRealMattKemp just said it best, "we ain't done yet, baby." Hello #postseason #baseball
@MDKanin @Dodgers @ClaytonKersh22 Yes, plays w/ so much heart &amp; passion. #admirable. Had chance to meet him couple years ago. Nice guy too.
RT @TMitrosilis: Here's Yasiel Puig's throw to nail Blanco at third if you missed it. Incredible. (via @gifdsports) https://t.co/1WfakVjb3e
And @YasielPuig throws another strike to third base for second out.  This guy is exciting to watch. #Dodgers #Letswin the division tonight!
Awesome triple by @Dodgers Ace @ClaytonKersh22 to tie the game. 1-1. #GoDodgers
#HermosaBeach proposed oil drilling project near park not worth it. #health #environment #cleanair  #childrenshealth #baddeal
@becksvotto TOT will help.
@becksvotto Lots of revenue options besides harm #environmental &amp; #health impacts from oil drilling. I'm for incentives to bring in retail.
Final Cost Benefit Analysis concludes #HermosaBeach may receive less than $1M/year to City's General Fund for oil drilling #environment
@MBennett117 Thank you for your work for our busineses &amp; #community.  #HermosaBeach
@MBennett117 Agree. City does good work too and needs revenue as well from healthy safe sources such as #farmersmarkets. #HermosaBeach
@MBennett117 Yes. That, along w/ALL Chamber rents/salaries paid from $400K+ Fiesta profits. City has revenue needs too. #HermosaBeach
Also didn't agree w/ 1year trial arrangement. If Rotary makes Friday #farmersmarkets flourish,  they shouldn't have it taken away aftr 1 yr.
Voted no #Farmersmarket move b/c I'd like city to consider takn over market &amp; keeping $40K profits for #community &amp; #schools +other reasons

Let me be clear, an "oil tax" is NOT needed if NO on oil drill per CBA, "city can finance cost to be paid through alloc of City rev" CBA 100
If NO to oil drilling, #HermosaBeach respon for $17.5M. City has budget $7M, bal = $10.5M paid through allocation of existing City revenues
#HermosaBeach residents should read Cost Benefit Analysis ("CBA") to learn the TRUE cost for a yes vote on oil drill'n #factsareimportant
+ If voters say yes to oil drill, #HermosaBeach loses free public beach access parkn spots. Cost to build parking structure=$18.8M CBA p. 54
+ If voters say yes to oil drill, #HermosaBeach loses $6.4M revenue from storage facility that will house new City Yard.  CBA p. 55, 9.4
If voters say yes to oil drilling, City responsible =$3.5M settlement fee + $14M for temp &amp; perm reloc of city yard, remed + (CBA p.52-69)
