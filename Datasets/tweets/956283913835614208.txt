Thanks to @POTUS, the era of backdoor deals in the drug industry is coming to an end, ushering in a new era where drug prices come down, discounts are delivered to your pocketbook, and every interest in our system finally has to put the American patient first. #CPAC2019 https://t.co/22DWboDgLo

Thanks to @POTUS, the era of backdoor deals in the drug industry is coming to an end, ushering in a new era where drug prices come down, discounts are delivered to your pocketbook, and every interest in our system finally has to put the American patient first.
Congress has an opportunity to follow through on their calls for transparency, too, by passing our proposal into law immediately and extending it into the commercial drug market.
Building a new system that really works will require cooperation—from drug companies that want to compete for patients, from pharmacy benefit managers who want to negotiate for patients, to physicians, pharmacists, researchers, and patient advocates.
Each year, more than $150 billion in rebates are passed around the drug industry, with patients left totally in the dark.		Under our proposal, the rebates moving around Part D, which total more than $29 billion, will be passed directly to patients, right at the pharmacy counter.
Today’s rebate system is set up in the shadows, to serve entrenched interests: drug companies who set these prices so high, and the pharmacy benefit managers who receive billions of dollars in rebates without patients ever knowing where the money goes.
How can anyone defend today’s catastrophically broken status quo that rewards higher prices, conceals kickbacks to middlemen, and denies seniors tens of billions of dollars of savings at the pharmacy counter?

And for those who continue to repeat that list prices don’t matter, let’s remember: Anyone who hasn’t spent through their deductible or has coinsurance is paying all or a percentage of the list price of the drugs they need. List prices matter.
For those listening in the pharmaceutical industry: The list price increases must stop. Prices must start coming down.
Maintaining the status quo, where higher priced drugs are more competitive and patients pay more, is unacceptable. Companies that announced price increases in January admitted they were doing so to funnel payments back to PBMs in order to keep the preferred status of their drugs.
.@POTUS and I will not stop our work until list prices go down. All options are on the table. We will continue with more regulatory and legislative proposals, and we will work with Democrats and Republicans, until we see list prices come down.
We’ve seen some good behavior from companies such as Merck, Gilead, and Amgen, who announced lower prices for their drugs. We need to see more. @POTUS and I won’t stop until American patients see the lower prices they deserve.
Drug prices must start coming down. https://t.co/MToQA77cvn
2018 saw historic progress made approving generic drugs and working to fix a broken system. But drug companies continue to raise prices hurting American patients. We will continue to implement @POTUS's blueprint to lower prices and costs for patients: https://t.co/i9TpyoIbHw https://t.co/v6aeP7qOlz
Happy birthday to the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. I’m proud of my colleagues who continue the Commissioned Corps’ 130-year legacy as the frontline defender of public health, providing critical health expertise and rapid response to public health emergencies.
We are moving swiftly to implement the policy @POTUS laid out in his drug pricing blueprint. We’ve taken serious action, seen results already, and more is on the way. Stay tuned!
Our work isn’t finished; every time a drug company raises their list price, patients’ out-of-pocket costs go up as many patients pay all or a percentage of the list price. This must end. Our goal remains to put American patients first and reduce drug prices.
Thanks to the leadership of @POTUS, in 2018 drug companies announced smaller and fewer drug price increases. Initial data show that price increases effective Jan. 1, 2019 are smaller and fewer than those effective Jan. 1, 2018.
Happy New Year from all of us @HHSGov.
Thousands of my @HHSGov colleagues routinely work weekends and holidays, and many are tasked with working through shutdowns, to fulfill our mission to protect and enhance the health and well-being of all Americans. I’m grateful for their commitment &amp; proud to be their colleague.

About to join @mikeallen to discuss the work the Trump administration has done this year to transform America's health system to one that costs less and provides greater value for patients—and to look ahead to 2019.
At #RyanWhite2018, I announced co-chairs selected for the President's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS: Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of @AIDSadvocacy, and John Wiesman, Secretary of Health for Washington State, @WaHealthSec. Both are great leaders in the fight to end AIDS.
With the tools available today, we should feel that each new HIV infection is a public health failure. We have the opportunity, in the coming years, to make incredible progress in the fight against HIV. We have no time to lose &amp; we all know our country can defeat this epidemic.
Today, I announced that @NIAIDNews will soon make new funding available for research collaborations across the southeast between public health departments, community organizations, and Centers for AIDS Research, to improve the implementation of tools for HIV prevention and care.
Stigma can be an even greater challenge when it intersects with the historic marginalization of particular populations, including the gay community, African-Americans and Latinos.
Stigma can be a debilitating barrier, preventing someone living with HIV from receiving the healthcare, services, and respect they need and deserve.
As I told #RyanWhite2018, we're committed to removing barriers to treatment, battling stigma &amp; improving the care of Americans with HIV. We can become a country where the spread of HIV is halted through increased access to treatment &amp; effective prevention. https://t.co/vOCb7praAp
It's a privilege to join #RyanWhite2018 to discuss the progress that everyone involved in the Ryan White program has made in the fight against HIV—and the remarkable potential we have to make more progress with the tools we have today to prevent and treat HIV.

We must also continue our work to remove the stigma that surrounds HIV so that no one is afraid to learn their HIV status, and receive treatment or take steps to prevent infection.
By ensuring access to and the availability of effective tools, such as PrEP and daily antiretrovirals, and strong support for new methods of prevention and treatment in the research pipeline, we're optimistic we can continue our advances toward ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

As we drive toward value, let’s remember that paying for outcomes means paying for the right inputs—whether they are healthcare services or human services.
We believe we could spend less money on healthcare, and help Americans lead healthier lives, if we align our healthcare investments with human services needs—addressing challenges Americans face before more serious problems develop.
By addressing social determinants and creating better connections between healthcare and social services, we believe patients will see greater improvements in their care and savings on the cost of that care.

Yesterday, we declared a public health emergency in California due to the wildfires. This will help ensure those who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP and are affected by the fires have continuous access to the care they need. https://t.co/ueQddsA68i https://t.co/N8n6kzYBLh
Today at lunch, @HHSGov leadership and staff enjoyed a Thanksgiving meal here at the Humphrey Building. I’m grateful to work with an incredible group of people so committed to improving the health of the American public. https://t.co/t8LdRX1RGZ
Thanks to legislation signed by @POTUS, Medicaid will be able to reimburse for services at pediatric recovery centers, which have sprung up to help support new mothers struggling with opioid addiction and their children. I’ve been able to see the incredible work first hand. https://t.co/IiNjwa2C8b
There are so many stories of Americans with serious mental illness, and their families, who end up with tragic outcomes because treatment options are not available or not paid for. I urge everyone involved in state Medicaid programs to consider applying for these waivers.
As with the SUD waivers we’ve granted to states, we strongly emphasize that inpatient treatment is just one part of what should be a more complete continuum of care, and that participating states will be expected to take action to improve community-based mental health care.
It was great to address #NAMD2018 today, where we announced CMS will be providing historic new flexibility around the IMD exclusion for treating patients with serious mental illness. https://t.co/sJ5jXhEgLC
It’s great to be at #NAMD2018 this morning to discuss innovation in Medicaid. With a spirit of partnership between federal and state governments, we have tremendous potential to confront the serious health challenges our country faces.

RT @HHSGov: HHS @SecAzar shared his vision for moving to a truly value-based healthcare system. Read his full remarks today at the Patient-…
We’re not going to stop there: We will use all avenues available to us—including mandatory and voluntary episode-based payment models. We need results, American patients need change, and when we need mandatory models to deliver it, mandatory models are going to see a comeback.
I shared today that we intend to revisit some of the episodic cardiac models that we pulled back, and are actively exploring new and improved episode-based models in other areas, including radiation oncology.
Last year, the administration reduced the size of the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model and pulled back the other episode payment models, including those on cardiac care. We've now reexamined the role that models like these could play in value-based transformation.
A step in value-based transformation is bundling payments, rather than paying for every individual service. CMMI has been working in this area for a while now—and we’re going to be trying a lot more such ideas in the future.
That kind of payment model would radically reorient power in our healthcare system—away from the federal government and back to those closest to the patient.
Imagine a system where physicians and other providers only had to worry about the outcome, rather than worrying about their staffing ratios and the individual reimbursements for every procedure they do and every drug they prescribe.
We recognize that patients are just one side of the relationship at the heart of healthcare. We need physicians—especially primary care providers—to be empowered, too. We want to remove substantial burdens and allow them to focus on the delivery of care for their patients.
Today I talked about the vital role that @AdamCMMi and I see primary care providers playing in building a value-based healthcare system.
Imagine a system where patients are in the driver’s seat, able to shop among providers empowered to make decisions and focus on them instead of paperwork; where we reward outcomes, not box-checking; where diseases are prevented or cured before they cause unnecessary suffering.
Our senior adviser overseeing this effort, @AdamCMMi, has laid out four paths to drive value-based transformation:	▶Empowering patients as consumers	▶Making providers into accountable navigators of the health system	▶Paying for outcomes	▶Preventing disease
Delivering better value from our entire healthcare system may be the most ambitious among our priorities. But it is incredibly important that we find a way forward for change—I believe we owe the American people a better healthcare system.

Whether threats are naturally occurring, accidental or deliberate, we must face up to challenges and work together to overcome them. We will continue to work to make health security not just a priority for every country, but a reality.
We must strengthen our capacity to prevent, detect and respond to infectious diseases. As we launch GHSA 2024, we need to determine how we build a culture of preparedness for each of our nations—where strengthening and maintaining health security becomes a core health investment.

The U.S. currently pays, on average, 180% of what other wealthy countries pay for costly physician-administered drugs. We've put out a plan that will ensure American patients get a more fair deal—saving patients and the Medicare program billions. https://t.co/KWbfUYGo6h
We’re providing a new way of paying for physician-administered drugs within Medicare that will lower drug prices and cut down on foreign freeriding. I was glad to have the chance to discuss our plan today with @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness. https://t.co/WKmRrryOaY
This model does not include any restrictions on patient access or choice of drugs, just more deals from drug companies—delivering on our promise to lower drug prices while respecting patient access and choice.
With the IPI model that @POTUS announced last week, we will ensure that American patients get a share of the deals drug companies voluntarily give to other countries, potentially saving American taxpayers $17 billion and beneficiaries $3.4 billion out-of-pocket.
Last week, we released data showing that in part of Medicare we pay 180% of what other countries are paying for the same drugs—letting others reap the benefits of American Rx investment and innovation while the costs fall on our patients and taxpayers. https://t.co/KWbfUYGo6h

I look forward to hearing from @POTUS later today on the administration's efforts to address the high cost of prescription drugs, and our work to put American patients first. Stay tuned.
Overall, the prices for Part B drugs in America exceed the prices paid in countries with similar economic conditions. These higher prices mean that Medicare pays nearly TWICE as much as it would for the same or similar drugs in other countries. We can and must do better.
All of this means that the Medicare program and its beneficiaries spent an additional $8.1 billion—47% more—on these drugs than it would have if payments were scaled by the calculated international price ratios.
In fact, Medicare was found to be paying the highest price for 19 out of the 27 drugs studied compared to these other countries. There was only a single case in which the US was paying lower than the international average.
For the main analysis, we included 27 different drugs. In total, this accounts for $17 billion—a majority of Part B spending on drugs. Among these drugs, on average, the US pays 180% more than the international price. And in some cases, more than 400% the international average. https://t.co/1uIzx6Bn4c
We compared the high prices Medicare pays to prices paid by countries with similar economic conditions, to better understand the discounts drug companies voluntarily offer them.
Unlike traditional, pharmacy-dispensed drugs, payers are not typically involved in negotiating better deals for people with Medicare.
Because @POTUS wants to end global freeloading, we compared prices for the most costly physician-administered drugs that are covered and paid for by Medicare Part B.
The latest report from @HHS_ASPE provides troubling insight into how the current international drug pricing system has put America in last place. American patients deserve better. Let’s take a deeper dive. ⬇️ https://t.co/a2z8hxggck

Plateauing at such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory. But everyone involved in fighting this crisis should know that their hard work is having results.
These positive signs are finally starting to show results in lives saved. The number of Americans dying from drug overdoses has skyrocketed since 2010. But toward the end of 2017 and in the beginning 2018, we have seen the number of drug overdose deaths begin to plateau.
As we consider those currently struggling with addiction, we know efforts to support treatment at the state, local and community level are having a real effect. From '15 to '17, we saw a statistically significant decline in the number of Americans who misuse prescription opioids.
RT @MilkenInstitute: "We badly need better ways to treat pain. Not just less addictive methods, but methods that are also more effective" @…
We recognize that pain is a real problem—one where we need better, more effective treatments. So, we're also leading on scientific efforts around pain and addiction, laying a base of scientific knowledge and promising leads for new treatments.
We recently met with mothers whose infants were born physically dependent on opioids—some ensnared in addiction by treatment they got following very common health procedures. One mother started misusing opioids after she was prescribed them for a broken finger—a broken finger!
Simply put, America has prescribed, and still prescribes, a stunning amount of potentially addictive pain medications. The majority of America’s heroin users started by misusing a legal opioid, whether one they were prescribed or one they bought or obtained from someone else.
As we continue our efforts to address to the opioid crisis, there are two particular areas where @HHSGov has taken the lead: preventing addiction by promoting evidence-based pain management, and supporting treatment &amp; recovery services for those struggling with addiction. #MIFHS https://t.co/F6oVbqXksB

Make no mistake → The American drug-pricing market is already changing. But it will have to change a lot more until patients get the deal they deserve. @POTUS has already taken more action on drug pricing than any president in history—yet you’ve just seen the tip of the iceberg.
It's no coincidence that the industry announced a new initiative *today* that will help make cost information more accessible. But placing information on a website is not the same as putting it in an ad, and it’s taken them five months since the @POTUS’s blueprint to make a move.
There is no reason it should be any different for Rx drugs. You buy a car every once in a while—but millions of American patients buy expensive drugs every month. Despite the ample precedent for this commonsense measure, the pharmaceutical industry has resisted it fiercely.
But since 1958, car companies have been required to post their sticker prices. People still get discounts when they go to purchase a car, but sticker prices are considered an important piece of consumer information.
More than 60 yrs ago, large car manufacturers came under criticism for inflating sticker prices, making it impossible for buyers to compare prices. Manufacturers protested that these prices weren’t meaningful, so mandating their disclosure wouldn’t help consumers. Sound familiar?
There is no single more meaningful number than the list price when it comes to determining what patients, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a given drug. Taking action to protect consumers from opaque pricing is far from unprecedented. In fact, here is an example ⬇️
Last week, @POTUS signed legislation to give you the right to know the lowest-cost option at the pharmacy. This week, he’s proposing to give you the right to know your drug’s price when you see it advertised on TV. As promised, he's putting American patients first! #NAMmtg
Patients deserve to know what a given drug could cost when they’re being told about the benefits and risks it may have. They deserve to know if the drug company has pushed their prices to abusive levels. And they deserve to know this every time they see a drug advertised on TV.
Today, @POTUS is taking historic action to bring patients more transparency through consumer advertising. We're proposing to require drug companies, for the first time ever, to include the price of any drug paid for by Medicare or Medicaid in their TV ads. https://t.co/4WOBIwONbk

Read my full remarks from today on the progress we’ve made to improve health insurance markets for Americans, and the steps we must take to continue moving forward: https://t.co/Xmkrdjk98c
Empowering the decision-makers closest to the people is the way of the future, a return to what once made American healthcare great, and the vision @POTUS has to deliver better care for all at lower prices.
There is a better way to do healthcare. It involves sending power back to the American people—to states, to local communities, to your doctor, and to you, as American patients. It involves building on the successes we’ve seen when patients have choice.
One of the best things about American healthcare is that we believe if you don’t like your plan, you don’t have to keep it. If you don’t like your doctor, you don’t have to keep them, either! Medicare for All is the opposite—if you don’t like your plan, there’s no way to leave.
The cost of "Medicare for All" would be staggering. By one recent estimate this system would cost taxpayers $32 trillion over a 10-year period. Today, 28% of federal spending is on healthcare. Under "Medicare for All," 58% of our federal budget would be devoted to healthcare.
The promise of "Medicare for All" is that all should get the quality care like seniors receive today. But the reality would be no one gets that quality—not working Americans who lose their employer insurance and not seniors whose program would now be altered beyond recognition.
Now, rather than reckon with the failures of the ACA, the same suspects are now proposing to repeat them—by imposing these failed ideas on all of American healthcare. I’m referring to the various proposals to create “Medicare for All.”
Let me repeat that: Under @POTUS, prices are dropping and choices are returning. The President who was supposedly trying to sabotage the ACA has proven better at managing it than the President who wrote the law. And we're still approving measures to further bring down premiums!
BREAKING: We are announcing today that, for the very first time under the ACA, the premium for a typical federal exchange plan will actually drop. Insurers have proposed to cut premiums for these benchmark plans by 2% nationally.
Turns out when you have a president who's willing to take decisive action, who understands business, who’s willing to work with the private sector, you can find a way to help American patients—even within a failed system like the ACA. We now have clear evidence that this is true.
When @POTUS took office, he took aggressive action. Literally, one of the first significant actions by the President was stepping in to help the American people by stabilizing the market as best he could within its broken confines.
The previous administration’s major healthcare achievement, the Affordable Care Act, was an attempt to use more government regulation and intervention to improve American healthcare. As we all know, the results were disastrous, with skyrocketing costs and disappearing choices.
Watch LIVE at 12pm ET as I deliver remarks on the progress of @POTUS to strengthen health insurance markets and provide relief to American patients, as well as the flawed promises of “Medicare for All.” https://t.co/IwKnl6IPOQ https://t.co/TkJ0QPmeZj

Today, we announced the release of an unprecedented strategic plan for TB research that will address fundamental research questions, while accelerating work to transform diagnosis, prevention &amp; treatment with the goal of ultimately eradicating TB. https://t.co/F3vi5o4bz6 #UNGA
We've shown our commitment to fighting #tuberculosis. Through both private philanthropy and government institutions like @NIH, the US generously supports TB research. By one estimate, the US provides 44% of the world’s donations toward the cause. #UNGA
Tuberculosis is an ancient affliction, but also a modern, devastating health threat for millions worldwide. It is the world’s deadliest infectious disease, and the US believes it deserves a commensurate response. https://t.co/AxtOqfkNwv #UNGA

Everyone, inside and outside government, wants their countries to be safe from the threat of an infectious disease outbreak. We recognize that, our policies recognize it and we are eager to work with others to make meaningful cooperation with the private sector a reality. #UNGA
Just because an organization has stockholders or profits doesn't mean they aren’t interested in helping to solve the health problems our world faces. Indeed, the incentives they have for innovation can make them a vital part of our efforts to confront infectious disease. #UNGA
Infectious threats do not respect boundaries between countries and can rapidly spread. We're committed to working in public and private sector partnerships with other countries to prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate and control disease outbreaks. https://t.co/93l8WrkJcT #UNGA
This is a critical step to ensuring patients have accurate information about their options when paying for prescription drugs at the pharmacy counter, and we look forward to these bills becoming law.
We at @HHSGov have worked with Congress in support of this approach to lower out of pocket costs, and we applaud Congressional action in passing both The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the Know the Lowest Price Act which would prohibit ‘gag clauses.’
Within two weeks of @POTUS's American Patients First blueprint release, @CMSGov put health insurers on notice that it is unacceptable to impose ‘gag clauses,’ which can cause seniors to pay more for drugs by prohibiting pharmacists from discussing cheaper options.

RT @CDC_NCEZID: Follow the AMR Challenge kickoff event NOW with the hashtag #GlobalAMRChallenge
Today, we're launching the #GlobalAMRChallenge, a year-long global call to accelerate progress in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. We invite stakeholders across public and private sectors to identify ways they can contribute to the fight. https://t.co/e7KvEpneUs #UNGA https://t.co/h4NCde4lvH
In the US, drug-resistant bacteria infect 2M people each year &amp; more than 20,000 people die as a result. Aggressive global action is needed to slow the development of new resistance, prevent the spread of existing resistance &amp; spur development of new antimicrobial products. #UNGA
Antibiotics have brought so many medical &amp; public health advances, from safe surgery &amp; childbirth to the treatment of cancer through chemotherapy. The emergence &amp; rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance threatens to undo this progress, at enormous human and economic cost. #UNGA
Infectious threats to the health and well-being of Americans and people around the world are ever-evolving. With the help of these public-private partnerships, we can continue to prevail against them. Read my full remarks: https://t.co/zd1ENfW8Id #UNGA
CARB-X’s first 2 years have exceeded expectations already, with 33 investigational drugs, including 10 new classes of antibiotics for a particularly dangerous type of bacteria. There hasn't been a new approved class of antibiotics for these bacteria since 1962. #UNGA https://t.co/9HMmFjP8sw
Our ability to prevent, detect and respond to infectious diseases depends on cooperation, as well as our ability to develop innovative solutions to age-old problems. We’ve seen success in this vital work with CARB-X, the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Accelerator. #UNGA
The single most important global health priority for multilateral organizations like the @WHO must be the cross-border threat of infectious diseases. No single country or sector can fully address on its own the threat posed by infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics. #UNGA

These actions are just the beginning of a sea change in drug markets. We have plans in the works to deliver on every aspect of the blueprint, and market actors who have responded to actions so far can expect reforms that aim toward a new, patient-friendly system to continue.
Together, these strategies will work to build a new drug pricing system characterized by real competition, lower prices, and healthy incentives for innovation. But despite the progress made, the most significant parts of the President’s blueprint are largely still in the works.
Within weeks after the blueprint’s release, @CMSGov also made changes to its Drug Pricing Dashboard, highlighting the individual drugs with the highest price increases in Medicaid, Part B, &amp; Part D, &amp; for the first time, manufacturers that are responsible. https://t.co/BTRdhb9wMr
Within a week of the blueprint’s release, @CMSGov put health insurers on notice that it is unacceptable to impose “gag clauses,” which can cause seniors to pay more for drugs by prohibiting pharmacists from discussing cheaper options. https://t.co/MRQz1nTWMb
In a historic step, @CMSGov gave Medicare Advantage new tools to negotiate lower prices for expensive Part B drugs for enrollees. The savings from these lower prices could be passed on to the 20 million seniors enrolled as soon as next year. https://t.co/UXsEtGUFPA
In some parts of the drug market, there isn't enough competition to drive down prices. That's why @POTUS made tougher negotiation by Medicare and Medicaid a key piece of his vision for lowering drug prices. We've delivered negotiation tools even faster than many thought possible.
We also launched an unprecedented workgroup to examine how importation could address access and public health problems caused by price spikes in the U.S. of sole-source drugs that do not have blocking patents or exclusivities. https://t.co/yznd9GMAZr
In the past 100 days, actions taken by FDA and @SGottliebFDA resulted in approval of the first generic drug under a pathway designed to encourage competition, first generic EpiPen, and a new biosimilar competitor for an expensive drug that fights infection in cancer patients.
Before the launch of the drug pricing blueprint, @US_FDA made it a priority under President Trump to accelerate approval of generic drugs, resulting in a record number of generic approvals in 2017. Since the blueprint, this record pace has accelerated. 📈 https://t.co/8HOJTulMJw
When we released the blueprint with @POTUS, few believed that, within months, drug manufacturers would begin to change their annual ritual of significant price hikes. Yet that is exactly what happened in the months following. https://t.co/3Zy8bmxTiW

All of these efforts to promote competition are part of advancing the President’s American Patients First blueprint for lower drug prices—and July’s news from FDA reinforces that they’re having a real benefit for patients already.
We’ve laid out product-specific guidances to help encourage the development and efficient approval of complex generics, where competition can be slow to materialize. https://t.co/6HPnhCCIDN
The agency has also highlighted all the instances where there is a marketed drug that’s no longer patent protected but doesn't face any generic competition. @US_FDA will expedite the review of any generic drug application for a product on this list.
I’m also having @US_FDA examine how the safe importation of certain drugs from other countries could help address price spikes in drugs that have no patent protection and no competitors here in the U.S. https://t.co/mp61DRS0EM
As part of DCAP, the agency has taken actions to stop the gaming of FDA safety programs by drug companies, who try to use laws meant to protect the public health to pad their profits instead, by blocking generic competition.
So how do we get more low-cost generic competition? @US_FDA has outlined a Drug Competition Action Plan (DCAP), which supports efficient review of generic drug applications with the goal of timely approvals and increased competition.
This is a key way to drive down drug prices through market competition, and one the U.S. does better than much of the world: we prescribe more generics, often at lower prices, than any other wealthy country. https://t.co/WEiEuyOnsb
Why are these approvals so important for American patients? Because generic drug competition drives prices down—a lot. Especially after two or more generics enter the market, prices drop dramatically. https://t.co/XPVhQ8Kek5
Last year, @US_FDA approved a record number of generic drugs in a year, more than 1,000. This July, they approved a record number of generic drugs for a month, at 126. https://t.co/pHf3YLpkwv
So here’s a tweetorial on the importance of generic drug competition, because competition plays a major role in delivering on @POTUS’s promise to bring down prices for American patients.

Some companies that make these drugs have had huge, abusive price increases in recent years—like in 2015, the 5,000% hike in the price of Daraprim, a drug approved by FDA in 1953. (2/3)
Today’s groundbreaking approval from @US_FDA speaks to the importance of building competition for drugs that are off patent but have inadequate generic competition https://t.co/xNR3AsE432 (1/3) https://t.co/5ggMYXffdu
Secretary Margaret Heckler’s boldness in taking on health disparities and HIV/AIDS is a proud legacy of our department, and I hope everyone at HHS and all Americans remain committed to the ideals she espoused of creating a healthier America for everyone. https://t.co/6oWj3UKsqG

With an openness to change, to innovation, and to real economic dynamism, under this President, we can secure American exceptionalism in healthcare for generations to come.
Our actions will be aimed at building markets and competition, restoring price signals and incentives, and empowering consumers through choice, rather than having government decide what is best for the individual.
If something in our healthcare system isn’t working, we’ll see if there’s a regulation in the way. If prices are high, we’ll see if there’s a tax involved. If prices keep rising, we’ll see if there’s a subsidy driving them.
One of America’s greatest leaders, President Reagan, applied commonsense solutions to the supposedly intractable challenges of his time. Like @POTUS, he saw straight through how Washington works, and had a pithy description of how problems are usually handled here. https://t.co/96NQF3g3MA
America’s healthcare system is huge, and immensely complex. It is the single largest sector of our economy, at more than one-sixth of GDP. But just because we have a complex system, and complex challenges, does not mean there are no simple principles for reform.

Finally, there was @US_FDA’s record-setting year in generic approvals: more than 1,000 drugs approved in FY17, more than ever before. These drugs are estimated to have saved patients nearly $9 billion in 2017. https://t.co/UWON4ZV5HM
Last year under @POTUS, we made a change to how Medicare pays for prescription drugs that will save seniors $320 million a year on their out-of-pocket costs.
As part of their Drug Competition Action Plan, FDA has taken numerous actions now to stop the gaming of our regulations by big drug companies trying to stop competition from generic drugs.

The Department of Health and Human Services knows its mission. We’re executing on that mission: working to protect the welfare of the children with whom we have been entrusted. We remain focused on complying with the court’s order.
The facts present a dangerous situation: In more than 20 percent of cases, our vetting processes have kept children from going back to adults who were not their parents or who were unfit for other reasons, including instances of serious alleged criminality.
Of the 103 children under the age of 5, there are 22 not eligible for reunification, in part, because:	❌11 adults had serious criminal history: child cruelty, trafficking, &amp; kidnapping;	❌7 not actually parents;	❌1 falsified birth certificate;	❌1 alleged to have abused child. https://t.co/OTghOg6gFj

We're continuing our diligent work to reunify children in compliance with the court order. The important work our teams perform through background checks and DNA testing has proven critical to protecting children against the risk of trafficking or abuse.
I have been honored to count Brett Kavanaugh as a close friend for 30 years. He is a great man and judge of soaring intellect and warm compassion and will be a superb Justice. Great choice, Mr. President.
Those who increased prices will be remembered for creating a tipping point in US drug pricing policy. The President’s noticed, I’ve noticed, and more importantly, the American people noticed.

We know our mission at @HHSGov and are committed to seeing it through. As we adapt to meet new demands and new circumstances, we have committed tremendous resources and deployed hundreds of additional personnel to expedite the reunification of minors with their verified parents.
We're working the challenge step-by-step within the restraints placed on us by conflicting court orders and a fundamentally broken immigration system. But make no mistake, while the Administration calls on Congress to act to fix the problem, @HHSGov is executing on our mission.
We are continuing to work overtime to connect separated minors with verified parents within the constraints applied by the court. While reunification with most parents is in the best interest of the child, proper and careful vetting for child safety essential.
We've deployed more than 230 personnel — including members of the Office of Preparedness and Response, the National Disaster Medical System, and the U.S. Public Health Service — to improve existing efforts to connect parents in the custody of @DHSgov with minors in @HHSGov care.
As we navigate the process of providing minors transferred to @HHSGov custody with a speedy release to a parent or sponsor, we've brought every resource to bear to comply with the courts order while ensuring our top priority: the safety and welfare of each child in our care. https://t.co/dxinr0Wpht
