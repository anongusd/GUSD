@RyanLEllis @jmculling Great use for leftover carcass of a whole roast chicken. Just wait u til you have 2-4 for rich flavor. Same with leftover ends of onions, celery, carrots, etc. Ain‚Äôt gotta be pretty for stock - use the ugly throw away bits.
@jmculling @RyanLEllis Chicken carcass, chicken bones, etc. simmer w cut onions, carrots, celery, bay leaves, rosemary, thyme, garlic cloves, peppercorns, water for like a day. Strain, then you have homemade broth. Re-add fresh cut veg and chicken and boom - homemade soup.

If you prefer Hunt's ketchup, you're a total psychopath.
@scrapper135 If you're going to use ketchup, that's CLEARLY the only acceptable option that's for sure.
In a lot of places in the South, its comms to order a hot dog or burger "all the way." That typically means bacon, chili, mustard, white onions, cheese (if on a burger). But to get slaw, you have to say "all the way, with slaw."
RT @HungryLobbyist: This is an important read. https://t.co/3oslSHmeZt

I'd love to see a bi-partisan infrastructure bill. But we just did a highway bill 3 years ago. No one is raising the gas tax or addressing the free-rider issue electric cars/bicycle lanes, etc cost. Davis-Bacon laws are still inflating project costs. Major major hurdles.
Clients should legit be focusing on the administration and what Treasury/IRS and agencies can help with. Trade, taxes, visa issues, and regulatory stuff with DOE/EPA. VERY few things will happen in Congress. Small extenders/MAYBE TCJA fixes are one of about 3 that pass.

@SecVII I think you are correct, but it will still fail. Maybe in the context of moving to a true consumption based tax system will pricing in carbon ever have a chance of becoming a bi-partisan reality. Until then, it's the 1993 BTU tax all over again...and we know how that went...

@JoeNBC you're happy right?
Kasich is 1 for 28 and polls less than 10% nationally. But sure, good thing you called for Marco to drop out. You're welcome Hillary.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all those who supported Marco with your time, money, and your heart. God bless the Rubio family.
