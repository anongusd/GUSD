Big question is can Trump convince his base this isn‚Äôt a cave?
He says then they‚Äôll negotiate the requests of ‚Äúthe experts in the field‚Äù for a Homeland Security Package. This proposal Trump is outlining as a deal is what Democrats have been calling for all along.
On Day 36 of the shutdown Trump says he will sign a temporary spending bill for 3 weeks, with backpay ‚Äúvery quickly, or as soon as possible.‚Äù
Trump: ‚ÄúWe have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.‚Äù
If Trump does endorse the plan as reporting suggests, this is a big win for Pelosi. Democrats have been calling for this the whole time.
A Democratic aide says the short term funding bill would last through Feb 15, Senate would vote first then would go to conference between House and Senate. It would not include wall money, it would include a provision to backpay furloughed employees.
GOP senator in the room confirms that McConnell just told them the president is endorsing a plan to reopen the government temporarily while they negotiate border security.
Trump is considering endorsing a short-term plan to reopen the gov and continue negotiating border security, exactly what Democrats had been calling for. @SenKevinCramer told me if Trump backs it he'll support it, but acknowledges the base will be unhappy. https://t.co/CEjRLiw8sW

Donnelly is a NO, before all of the allegations came out he was a top target to support Kavanaugh. Indiana went for President Trump big time in 2016, Donnelly is in a tough re-election making calculation a vote against Kavanaugh won't sink his race. https://t.co/f1kbHfD1rG
