A cult is a system of religious beliefs and rituals that is regarded as unorthodox-doxor spurious,with a great devotion to a person,idea, or thing.
The bible explicitly warns us that in our time there will be an increase of false religions which part from the true faith and try to seduce believers and non believers  into following false doctrines that have nothing to do with the God that we know from the bible.
