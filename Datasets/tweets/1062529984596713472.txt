@ThyConsigliori YES... 		🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@ThyConsigliori i agree... which is why i think we need to start to talk about the strategic solution to the situation.  trump is just tactical and short term (however another 6 years is short term -- if we are lucky).  we need to start talking long term for our selves, family, country. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@ThyConsigliori 2. we must reaffirm the strength of the family and faith so as to assure penetration of influence is offset by critical thinking and core values. i'm still formulating other areas where we combat the influence. /end
@ThyConsigliori I agree with this... BUT i also wholeheartedly believe we have a grave issue in academia.  I cannot for the life of me sort out how we gut academia.  Only thoughts:  1. we must be VERY selective where we allow our children to go (less humanities more practical education). 1/

Imploding their own party. They will eat their own. BUT when she throws a frenade in to our camp there is no reason to withhold the counter attack. She is not one of ours. She is one of theirs (in disguise — she’s really an anarchist).
UPDATE: we need to view Cortez as an anarchist to blow up the establishment. Leverage this...!  		What do I mean?  She will attack both the right and left. She is an anarchist.		As a result, when she throws a grenade into the left camp, they will struggle attacking back without
@SGTHarleyDaveK No one said they’re smart. The issue is they are organized. As a result, we never relax and we must make sure we don’t attempt to fight a flame thrower with a rock. If we do, who is stupid then?

It may not be today, but Tecumseh said: where one twig is weak a bundle of twigs strong. Remain strong. Remain together. We are on the same battlefield fighting the same enemy. All have different tools and strengths. Stay focused.
We must remain calm and thoughtful. No knee jerk reactions. The third attempt this week was : 		Trump doesn’t care about the troops, he never visited them. 		They are trying to split up this glorious movement to take our country back. We cave, we die. It’s that simple.
https://t.co/5lHu0XIGFU
Do not let them bully you into ‘choosing’ a side. Stick with the belief system. Rule of Law and no more War Economy.  Do not let them divide. We divide, they win. This country will not survive.
Remember the elders in the church &amp; how they tried to corner Jesus in his beliefs? They are doing that now w/ tempting on ‘choosing a side’. Eg  If you are for Rule of Law &amp;  against illegal immigration your anti Jesus. Wrong. If you are for Mattis you are anti troop withdrawal.
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:		New Democrat tactic = fracture / split the base (as they are imploding themselves). Found in the following:		Illegal immigration retort: Jesus was a refugee. 		Mattis resignation:  End world policing by withdrawing over troops. 		STAY GROUNDED...!
