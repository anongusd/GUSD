Final note on Warren's Iowa trip: She earned a reputation for assiduously avoiding the press in the Capitol and being miserly with access in general, but that's been changing and she did press avails after 4/5 events this weekend
Warren's team knows convincing people she can win is a hurdle -- especially since no one really knows what "electability" even means now.		Gender is part. One woman told me: "I just don't think our nation is ready for a woman, and esp for an older woman."	https://t.co/LUSpg85vzB

@GoodsonLarry Wouldn't even have to. It takes two-thirds of Senate to convict and remove, that's 67 senators, so 22 (!) Repubs, assuming all 45 Dems vote in favor in 116th Congress. No one believes that's likely, even pro-impeachment people, which is why they have an interest in eliding that.
Impeachment =/= removal from office, but lots of people conflate them and statements like this from pro-impeachment Dems don't help. https://t.co/dNhQwUIWcX https://t.co/yE83u7oyFv

Coming up on MSNBC with @KatyTurNBC to discuss the Florida recount.		Here’s my dispatch from the circus &gt;	https://t.co/YjsJaxdSIr
Here's the resolution to the emergency hearing today on Broward's election issues: 		All parties have agreed and judge is preparing to order 3 add'l Sheriffs Deputies be in place at the SOE. Asks they be in place in next few hours, remain until end of recount.
BUT he wants "some additional layer of confidence,” suggesting (but not ordering) that they add 3 Broward County Sheriffs Deputies who report to a different supervisor. https://t.co/u3eta0Z61A
JUST IN: Judge denies Rick Scott campaign request for injunction -- at least for now. Parties will reconvene in an hour. 		"I don’t think I have any evidence to enter a mandatory injunction right now,” Judge Jack Tuter said.
Meanwhile, things seem to be going much better than Broward next door in Dade &gt; https://t.co/cCV6WbDNwz
Scott team's demands turn out to be fairly minor. Want Broward ballots+machines to be impounded when NOT in use: "We’re not interested in interfering with the recount at all."		Atty for SOE argues it's an attempt to get a small-ball ruling that *looks* bad, even if does not much.
The Broward County Courthouse is shut down for Veterans Day, like a ghost town — except for this emergency hearing on a lawsuit filed by the Rock Scott campaign. 		Lots of motions and counter motions. “So, everybody wants to intervene in every case, basically?” judge asked. https://t.co/4hselWaFM6

Here's why the FL recount takes so long		Broward alone has 714k ballots, consisting of 3.5 million pages. 		Right now, all they're doing is sorting the 1st page, which has all 7 races being recounting, from the rest. 		That sorting alone will take 30-35 hours. Then they count.

That’s a wrap on today’s DNC meeting, thanks for playing.		The biggest surprise? A DNC event ended *early* (by 6 minutes).
Bernie Sanders stmt on super delegate reform: "Today's decision by the DNC is an important step forward in making the Democratic Party more open, democratic and responsive...I want to thank Tom Perez and all of those who made it happen.”
It's official: The DNC has stripped superdelegates of their key power and reformed caucuses by adopting a reform package by voice vote.
Big unexpected twist in DNC super delegate twist:		Don Fowler, the leading opponent of the reform package, stands to essentially concede. 		He calls for suspension of the rules to allow for speedy approval of the change. Get a standing ovation.
Finally back after lengthy vote count:		Perez' ruling (no need for charter amendment) upheld overwhelmingly: 329.5 to 106.5  		Good sign for reformers ahead of main vote. 		(And yes, you can have half votes in DNC because it's Democrats) https://t.co/KNE62D4uD3
@GovHowardDean @AFSCME Strong objection to super delegate disempowerment from DNC Vice Chair Karen Carter Peterson: "Are you telling me that I’m going to go to a convention, after my 30 years of blood, sweat and tears for this party, that you’re going to take away my right?"
@GovHowardDean @AFSCME Crucial procedural moment now on the DNC reform package: Does it require a charter amendment (2/3rds vote) or not (simple majority)?		Tom Perez rules it does NOT require an amendment, but is opening it up to full floor vote by paper ballot, w/public debate.
@GovHowardDean @AFSCME There's a lot more to this reform package than super delegates. Especially notable is changes to caucuses. Details --&gt; https://t.co/BN1oCZPd3w
@GovHowardDean @AFSCME Former DNC Chair Don Fowler has the floor to give the opposition's argument.		Opens by calling it "disenfranchising," for removing 200 AfAms, 100 Latinos, etc. who are super delegates, calls that antithetical to Democratic value. 		Some boos and shouts of "lies!" in response.
DNC meeting opens w/video from @GovHowardDean and fiery speech from @AFSCME Pres. Lee Saunders in favor of reform package.		"We’ve debated this ad nauseam," says Saunders, who is black, pushing back on opposition from some AfAm DNC members: "It doesn't disenfranchise anyone."

Regardless of the horse race, maybe you just shouldn't be a U.S. senator if you've been indicted? Yes, innocent until proven guilty, but seems like the bar for admission to the Senate is a little higher than that.
