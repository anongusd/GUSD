@leslietfj I would like to know from you the order of candidates that you would support in 2020. Thanks!
@leslietfj Instead of attacking Bernie, tell me which Democratic candidate for President you like and why?  Be positive.
@leslietfj He endorsed Hillary for President after he lost the Democratic nomination and campaigned for her all over the country. He caucuses with the Democrats in the US Senate. He was the pivotal vote to save Obamacare from being repealed in 2017 by Senate Republicans.
@leslietfj Plus, Bernie’s father was born in Poland and if you know your European history, Polish people are no Russian puppets. You must be thinking of Jill Stein who had dinner with Russian President Putin and Michael Flynn.
@leslietfj He is more progressive than many of the Democrats running for President. Thanks to him many of the Democratic candidates adopted his policy positions. Hillary lost because she didn’t campaign effectively in the blue wall states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

@Ho8Go8L1N @gmsuelly @wericstafford Studies have shown that prices of a McDonald’s burger would go up by a few cents and no one has to lose a job. People lose jobs because there isn’t enough demand for services or goods to be produced. And why there isn’t enough demand? b/c people don’t earn enough $ to buy things.
@Ho8Go8L1N @wericstafford At least it won’t saddle them with a mountain of debt which is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Many young people can’t afford college because it is too expensive. It takes an average college grad to retire student loans between 15-30 years.
@Ho8Go8L1N @gmsuelly @desettiks @wericstafford Of course. The more the merrier. Steak/burger, beer, peanuts = paradise.
@Ho8Go8L1N @gmsuelly @wericstafford I can tell you for a fact that had the minimum wage of $7.25/hr been indexed to the Consumer Price Index for inflation, it would have been $15/hr a long time ago. A person can making $15/hr can buy more goods than someone making $7.25/hour. It will spur economic growth.
@gmsuelly @desettiks @wericstafford I graciously accept.  Looking forward to the beer summit. Desetti are you in?

@wericstafford The way to get the bottom 50% to pay higher percentage of taxes is to increase affordable educational opportunities. A college education in a marketable field works wonders. We need the State of Kansas to make Regent colleges affordable again.
@wericstafford @gmsuelly All the churches would not be able to feed all those who are on food assistance or care for those on cash assistance. That is why we have the government as a social safety net. Churches do good things to supplement government assistance but cannot be primary source of help.

@Ho8Go8L1N @gmsuelly @wericstafford I used to work for DCF as a child support enforcement attorney and saw the daily struggles of the working poor trying to make ends meet at $7.25/hour. They desperately relied on the child support monies to put a roof over their children’s heads and to feed them.
@desettiks @wericstafford And the invite should be extended to @gmsuelly for a beer. Would love to explain to these two fine gentlemen the fallacy of supply side economics. I subscribe to demand side economics.
@desettiks @wericstafford Mark, I would love to have a beer with you as well. Hope Eric Stafford will join us.
@gmsuelly @wericstafford Senator, there are more people in the bottom tax bracket than in the top tax bracket. If the folks on the bottom were to make a living wage of $15/hour, they would be able to purchase more good made by the business owners. There has to be demand, first, before folks can get hired
