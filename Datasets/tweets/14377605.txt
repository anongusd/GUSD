And last but not least, we‚Äôre building for the long term. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve invested in helping elect Democratic candidates for attorney general and secretary of state across the country this year to ensure fair elections in the future.
Because we know how important it is to meet voters where they are, the DNC has invested to equip state parties and campaigns with voting rights toolkits for constituency groups and communities, including translating this voting information into 7 languages.
We‚Äôre working with state parties, including in FL, TX, NV, MT, TN and GA, to recruit hundreds of voter protection staff, lawyers, and poll watchers for Election Day. Are you a lawyer who‚Äôd like to help protect the right to vote? Sign up here to volunteer: https://t.co/SyUbef0drK
For voters who prefer texting or are hearing impaired, our hotline is also running over SMS for the first time ever. Text ‚ÄúQUESTION‚Äù to 43367 and we'd be happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have about voting in your state. https://t.co/GEkeu2hbe8

Voting is at the heart of what it means to be American. That's why here at the DNC we've expanded our Voter Protection Hotline. It‚Äôs now a permanent hotline and bigger than ever, with more than 100 volunteers staffing it between now and Election Day. https://t.co/KTboiPfcIp

Shirley Chisholm once said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt make progress by sitting on the sidelines whimpering &amp; complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas." #SeatAtTheTable is the DNC‚Äôs way of getting off the sidelines to actually engage &amp; organize with Black women &amp; we want you to join.

We‚Äôre looking for women like you to help secure more Black women‚Äôs #SeatAtTheTable. We need you in Georgia to help elect @StaceyAbrams as the state‚Äôs first African American &amp; first woman governor, which would make her the first African American woman elected governor in the US.

States can save money and keep their records up-to-date by using AVR. It promotes voter registration and reduces the potential for voter fraud. Electronically transferring voters‚Äô information is secure and cuts out paper and extra administrative costs. -@TeamKCP
It does this in two ways: 1. Any time an eligible individual interacts with a participating government agency, they‚Äôre registered to vote unless they opt out. 2. That person‚Äôs voter registration information is electronically transferred to election officials. -@TeamKCP
Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) is a huge step towards fully implementing the NVRA because it automatically registers voters when they use public agencies. 13 states and DC have already adopted this law. -@TeamKCP
Although the NVRA is a federal election law that comes before any conflicting state law, many states are not in full compliance with the law. -@TeamKCP
It also created a requirement for public agencies, such as the DMV, to offer voter registration. Because of this, it became known as the ‚ÄúMotor Voter Law‚Äù. -@TeamKCP
The NVRA was designed to streamline the process of voter registration and create national standards for mail-in voter registration and voter list maintenance. It was a huge victory and a key step in closing the voter registration gap  -@TeamKCP
NVRA was passed by Congress in 1993 after finding that ‚Äúdiscriminatory and unfair registration laws‚Äù in many states reduced voting by minority and low-income citizens. -@TeamKCP
