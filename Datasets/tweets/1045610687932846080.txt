@Johnekdahl is 100% correct.  I am a lifelong Democrat, from a family of lifelong Democrats.  What's more is I am a True Liberal, unlike the fake liberals that call themselves Democrats today.

@mybeerbelly1 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL I will give you Gillum, but O'Rourke is an illusion sadly.
@mybeerbelly1 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL Still waiting to find one I am in the district of that is neither too far left, or trying to earn their way into the established power structure of the Clinton party.
@mybeerbelly1 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL I will call them the Democratic party again when they stop using the DNC to disenfranchise voters in the primaries.  Sorry if I offended you, but I got very upset starting in the Iowa caucuses.  Wasn't enough to vote for Trump, but I didn't vote for Clinton either.
@mybeerbelly1 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL We need politicians that are pragmatic, considered, honest, and not beholden to special interests or corporate ownership.  Neither party offers that.  Politics in general does not offer that.  I'm not sure what the answer is to start truly dealing with the problems we face.
@mybeerbelly1 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL the globalist ends the Clintons got paid so well for.  We need a Democrat party that is closer to the party of JFK so we can kick the Republicans out of office and not have it damage the country.  I think it's going to require a massive house cleaning though.
@mybeerbelly1 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL Fair enough.  It's not exactly like Gillum can try to turn Florida full socialist on petroleum profits, though the expansion of state welfare programs have gone poorly in some other states.  I am of the Democrats need to fix the issue of the extreme left pulling the party towards
@mybeerbelly1 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL My point was just that as bad as Russia is right now, which it is, Venezuela is in much worse shape at the moment.  I did miss the satire, I admit.  Sadly, it is currently remarkably hard to tell satire from reality with many people out there that will say stupid things honestly.
@jonathanweisman Versus the Democrat position of #resist.  Hence the slogan #jobsnotmobs.  Yeah, I think it's going to be successful.
@duchessdecaff @jonathanweisman To say that science is science, not feelings.
@Bobmorevc @jonathanweisman So you failed biology in High School?
@mybeerbelly1 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL Visit Venezuala, visit Russia, then come back and try to tell us that.
@itvnews Not only is the explanation of Khashoggi's death "not credible," but so is any explanation on why we should care about Khashoggi when so many die in our own countries and he wasn't particularly important to the Western world.
@FelineWinston @WSJ https://t.co/a5wgFJ3hnE
@WSJ But I thought Trump loved Putin and was owned by Russia.  Are you saying we've been misled by the MSM playing partisan politics rather than maintain journalistic integrity?  Nahh, that can't be it, right?
@wgd1601 @Timcast @RachelSuperEli1 Can't really argue with that.  I like Bob too.  I prefer the one without the history in Puerto Rico though, for personal moral reasons.
I tend to call all propaganda style journalism fake news, but this does seem to be the most accurate description of how others use it I've seen. https://t.co/8MQytYyNwd
@bryoneill11 @Timcast @Cernovich Liberal is a specific philosophy.  For a long time in America, the right or conservatives, were classical liberals and the left were progressive liberals.  We were able to maintain a country by both being wings of liberal.  Now the left are Marxists and the right reactionary.

@MSNBC @HardballChris Seriously, updating the voter rolls and requiring IDs is just  common sense.  Complaining about it because you can't have a repeat of 1960 is funny at this point
@Yaraduagroup @RaheelB51889648 @cnni Proving the existence of God would tell all the Monotheists, Deists, Panentheists and the like that they are correct.  The rest would still be debated until the end.
@MSNBC @HardballChris Considering the history of voting in places like Chicago, the rampant abuse seen in Texas, including the Democratic party sending registration cards to non-citizens already marked that they are citizens, the 4 women arrested for voter fraud involving seniors, I think it's okay.
@washingtonpost I guess that is a downside of being less popular than the House, which was until recently less popular than the Senate, both less popular than Trump, who we all know isn't exactly popular.
@CNN I guess being reminded that Khashoggi was close to the previous bloodthirsty Saud regime and his ties to terrorism is bad for optics.
@MSNBC @Lawrence Because @Lawrence is convinced almost everything that comes out of Trump's mouth is a lie.  So did I back in the campaign.  The difference being, lacking TDS and ignoring propaganda let me realize from is actions he is more honest about this stuff than most politicians.
@benshapiro Beto O'Rourke's campaign transcended politics to be a black hole for money and enthusiasm.

@SenWhitehouse A constitutionally legal action is legal, regardless of the intent.
@DrSamuelGregg It discriminates against the culture of Secularism that is based on living as if God's existence doesn't matter.  That's the culture that they want more of in the Catholic Church.  Sadly, Pope Francis might give it to them if his protection of the rot doesn't get him first.
@CNN Most honest thing President Trump has ever said.
@PattyMurray Too bad the ACA ballooned healthcare costs, even beyond the rate they were ballooning before.  It only took a loss in healthcare quality, forcing young healthy people to partake in the insurance/pharmaceutical racket, and lying to the American people about it.  But trust Dems!
@PattyMurray Soup kitchens, food pantries and the like do not ask questions.  Government programs however, should, seeing how they are paid by our tax dollars, taken from us by force, not given to charity.  If you feel the need to feed them, feed them.  Don't force me to.
@jackshafer Make sure to save up money to pay for his legal costs after this gets thrown out.  SLAPP down!
@MichaelAvenatti Dude, it's best not to talk crap right after you've been SLAPPed.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Illegally crossing the border is wrong as well.  They can keep from having to put their children through this by going through legal channels or not coming here at all.  After all, we are told this is a horrible place for women and minorities.  Why would they want to come here?
Not that anyone reads my twitter, but for those who aren't aware, mob activity by the left has been met by mob activity from the right, and now we are having mob brawls in the streets.  Exactly what anyone could have told you would happen.  Way to lower the bar America.
@Hereforthenews8 @washingtonpost I do, and everyone I have ever met who has been around someone who has been breastfed that long.  Academia is nice and all, but all actual experience has shown me it's a horrible, horrible idea.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich @FoxNewsOpinion I support the wall, just like I support separating children from adults.  Not because it hurts the families, but because it hurts the child trafficking from those that will use children as props.
@washingtonpost It's not an issue wit the body, it's an issue with the kid.  4 years old is too old if the kid is not mentally damaged, because breastfeeding at 4 years old will damage the kid.
@obianuju @spucscotland Stay with God and He will see you through.  Just a few minutes in and the forces of Satan are attacking you.  Let there be no doubt that we are in the midst of a tremendous spiritual war.
@RitaPanahi I wish there was something we could do about this, but Pakistan will be Pakistan, and the US does not have enough leverage to save a Pakistani citizen.  Just remember, Jesus will not come again until the number of martyrs is complete, and there is no doubt that she is a martyr.
@obianuju @NBCNews The media does not want the truth to come out.  Kermit Gosnell shows the lies that they have been spreading, and they can't have that.

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump It's Saudis being Saudis.  It has never bothered us in the past.
@washingtonpost Noting the General Lee kept beating Union Generals until Lincoln put Grant in charge of the fight is acknowledging history.  Nothing more, nothing less.
@SenFeinstein Saudis killing Saudis happens all the time.  If this hasn't been a problem in the past, when we have gone to war for them, it's not a problem now.  Besides, I'm not going to get worked up over another Muslim Brotherhood supporter biting the dust.

@mattyglesias How dare he disenfranchise the dead, felons, illegals and people who have moved out of state.  They want to make their Democrat voice heard.
@MicahWillarthy @TIME True, but I don't have to respect her for her lack of perspective.
@_ciller_cisses @sploork @SaneResponz @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Because it in no way, shape, or form meets the legal requirements.
It turns out that politicians lie.  Also, water is wet and the earth revolves around the sun.  Don't tell any flat earthers that last one.  I'm not sure their hearts could handle it. https://t.co/xm18Z3STdC
@MicahWillarthy @TIME That's funny, because I never said that.  I said that teenage girls are the only ones I was AWARE OF that have committed suicide because of the internet.  I never said they were the only ones that did.  I did say Melania should be above that.
@MicahWillarthy @TIME Well, teenage girls are the only ones I am aware of who have killed themselves over what people say on the internet, but I am always willing to be educated if you are able to point out other examples that I am currently unaware of.  Still doesn't make Melania's point better.
@_ciller_cisses @sploork @SaneResponz @RandPaul Last time I checked Heather Heyer wasn't a journalist.
@MicahWillarthy @TIME Cyber bullying is what people do to insecure teenage girls.  World famous models whose husband is super rich and have the most powerful job in the world should be able to overlook a bunch of morons on the internet.
@gatewaypundit So you are saying she's an establishment type Democrat?
@washingtonpost Then stop spreading your own fake news.  You can come down on outlets for spreading Trump's propaganda when you stop spreading globalist and leftist propaganda.  Propaganda is propaganda, one is not morally superior than the other.
@ColJSMosby @axomamma @charliespiering Unlike him I am pro-Lincoln and if there was a single issue I voted on, it would be anti-slavery.  Doesn't come up much, but it was how Trump won my support after I did not vote for him in 2016.  Never had a President fight human trafficking to the extent he does.
@dutpekmezi3 @Froundlol @cnni @CNNOpinion It is also far too common throughout other parts of the Middle East.  It's why I said we need more Indonesian Islam, less Boko Haram.  Islam is a truly patriarchal culture unlike Western Civilization.  It allows things like FGM to spread beyond where it started.
@axomamma @ColJSMosby @charliespiering Resorting to insults rather than arguments doesn't exactly make your case.  Unlike conservatives, Marxists did have meetings.  It was determined by Lenin that the most effective way forward would be to have Marxists infiltrate American academia and the Vatican.  Very effective.
@RealJamesWoods Nahh, Stalin simply piggybacked Lenin's brave bold vision.
@axomamma @ColJSMosby @charliespiering Harvard, Yale, Princeton, all of these started as conservative seminaries.  History is a fascinating thing if you take the time to study it.
@axomamma @ColJSMosby @charliespiering There wasn't a meeting.  There was a choice of those of that generation, on an individual level, to pursue business instead of academia.  That was a poor choice.  The universities have moved so far left under the influence of Marxism that it hurts everyone.
@washingtonpost You have to admit though, "Hillary for Prison 2016" was a catchy slogan.  Sen. Feinstein should also answer for why she started employing a Chinese spy right after her husband invested millions in Chinese business in the late 90's.
@RealJamesWoods They did not fail if they were undertaking weakening the US.  They were very successful at that.  I would prefer to think of them as duplicitous and competent rather than remarkably stupid and incompetent.
@axomamma @ColJSMosby @charliespiering After WWII conservatives went into business and let the left take over academia.  Like all things, it would have been preferable to have a balance, instead of entering the damaging cycle of the pendulum.
@axomamma @ColJSMosby @charliespiering You have to go way back for that.  Most of our top universities started as fairly conservative seminaries.
@vkswede @Rasha0994 @RandPaul Hussein was our guy.  He thought he had enough support to invade Kuwait.  He was unpleasantly surprised when we started attacking him.
@SenJeffMerkley Republicans don't need dirty tricks to drive up healthcare costs.  They were going up just find before ACA, even more after ACA.  Trying to act like them going up is different now is just lying.
@cnni Sadly accurate.  It definitely gets hard to get through each day.
@GOP I doubt we've had a President who liked to hear himself speak as much as this one before.  He's the opposite of Calvin Coolidge.
@washingtonpost This is a good example of the best aspects of our country.
@SaneResponz @RandPaul Journalists aren't under threat in the US.  Republican politicians on the other hand...
@dutpekmezi3 @cnni @CNNOpinion You may say that Islam has nothing to do with FGM, but statistics say otherwise.  All cultures have their weaknesses, but there is definitely some which are better than others.  We need Indonesian Islam, not Boko Haram to be the norm.
@ColJSMosby @charliespiering Giving up the universities was a horrible mistake of previous generations.  The media outlets are more the result of careful planning by the globalists.  The right has been woken up, but the midterms come first.  Give it a couple more months.
@ColJSMosby @charliespiering When the right fights back they use guns.  Hell, even a bus full of hillbillies would have wiped the floor with the Kavanaugh protesters, no weapons needed.  Imagine how it would play on CNN watching the mob get laid low by a few dozen "deplorables."  Better to wait for now.
@cnni @CNNOpinion It's been time to act.  However, action requires us to accept that some cultures are superior to others, and academia refuses to acknowledge that simple fact.  Especially once Islam becomes involved.
@ColJSMosby @charliespiering Better fingerwagging than war in the streets.  Once things go hot, it will be bad for everyone, especially the progressives.  Women and beta males do not win wars, especially against heavily armed veterans

@FoxNews @POTUS @foxandfriends Who respects Kanye West?
@RandPaul He went to all the effort to support a coup in the country.  You can't honestly expect him to cut off military sales now, no matter how moral it might be.
@AP It's time we held Hollywood producers responsible for the crimes they commit.  Weinstein is a start, but it should be nowhere close to the end.
@MicahWillarthy @TIME Compared to punches and kicks, social ostracization and the like, I find it hard to count mean comments on twitter as bullying.  Especially when you consider their net worth and the building she lives in.
@eastversewest @CNN I disagree.  I cannot condone subjecting any child to DFS for anything short of actual child abuse, regardless of the stupid statements made by their parents.
@MicahWillarthy @TIME Repetitious comments don't change the accuracy of the statement.
@CNN She should try being physically assaulted daily at the public school she is legally required to attend, and then talk about how bullied she is.
@FoxNews @POTUS @foxandfriends If you ask Bill Kristol and Co, no.  If you ask actual conservatives, Bill Kristol and Co. are no longer a conservative.  So effectively, yes, if yes effectively means losing a chunk of the Never Trumpers.

@RumpturdsO @SenFeinstein Sexual assault is neither parties concern.  If it was Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton would not have been politically covered.  Keith Ellison would face justice.  If it was Senator Feinstein would have cared about Dr. Ford more than political points.
@LeRoyInSB @LaineyRubin @SenFeinstein No clue.  But in Southern Missouri it's getting cold at night but still warm during the day.
@RumpturdsO @SenFeinstein I wanted Senator Feinstein, the only one that could have kept Dr. Ford from going through this, to handle things the way she should have in the first place.  It just goes to show that all politicians are alike, and none of them actually care about Dr. Ford.
@jimstev03759375 Of course Trump is corrupt.  He's a politician.  What surprises me is tat you think the Democrats are better.  It would not have been necessary to reopen anything if she gave them the letter before the FBI finished it's investigation.
@jimstev03759375 @SenFeinstein Which would have happened if Senator Feinstein decided that Dr. Ford's allegations were more important than winning political points.  It is sad, but the Democrats played politics with this just like the Republicans are, and that is why there was no FBI investigation into it.
@bjb1018 @LaineyRubin @SenFeinstein She doesn't care about the circus.  She cares about stopping the nomination.
@RumpturdsO @SenFeinstein It just shows that Dr. Ford was not her concern, but rather the power of the seat on the Supreme Court.
@RumpturdsO @SenFeinstein She did not turn it into the FBI when she had a chance because she wanted to use it for political purposes.  Now that the other side is acting political she is crying foul.  Back to my original statement.  #bothsidesaretoblame
@RumpturdsO @SenFeinstein I want her to turn it over to the FBI when she gets it.  Remember, the FBI is who is supposed to look into it.  She said so herself, repeatedly.
@SenFeinstein You have to realize at this point that pulling out more people will not stop this nomination.  You had a chance to do this right and you did not take it.  You still have not answered why. #duckingresponsibility
@Nitemists @SenFeinstein You caught me!  You can take screenshots and I'm new.  #pointless
@RumpturdsO @SenFeinstein I am saying she should have taken it more seriously.  How is that letting sexual assault slide?
@mobilematt @SenFeinstein I produce 0 lumens, so I would say I am far more than dim.  #nolight
@rhonda_harbison @SenFeinstein I never said anything about Mark Judge, and it has NOTHING to do with what Feinstein did not do.
@Reflecting_onit @LaineyRubin @SenFeinstein I don't think I smell like vodka.   #smellslikecookies
@SenFeinstein Senator, this is the cost of the partisanship that you guys started with the way you handled this process.  It is unfortunate that it has come to this, but you had to realize blowback would come eventually.
@LindseyGrahamSC But yelling makes them feel like they are accomplishing something, or earns them Soros funds.  Don't you want disorganized mobs to have high self-esteem and lunch money?  #astroturf #magicpaper
@LaineyRubin @SenFeinstein Yes, just like Beardo the partisan counsel explained to Dr. Ford that the Judiciary Committee was willing to fly out to meet her so she did not have to speak in public.  Pull the other one. #dontbuyit
@CNN A Democrat is voting no on Kavanaugh?  How is this news?  Next you will say that Ted Cruz voting yes on Kavanaugh is news.  Up Next: Gravity is a thing. #statingtheobvious
@SenFeinstein Why did you not turn in your information when it could have done the most good?  I find it disingenuous that you act like you care about Dr. Ford any more than the Republicans do. #bothsidesaretoblame
@CapitolHe11 @SenWhitehouse I am not saying that she leaked it.  I am saying it should have been turned in at the beginning of the process properly redacted.  If it had, the Republicans could not have kept the FBI from doing everything they could.
@MarcVitale4 @jasondhorowitz We have sworn statements from 3 "witnesses" that say that Kavanaugh was not at a party like Dr. Ford described.  We have a whole lot of people that claim that Hillary Clinton is a Satanist.  If we are going by numbers... #QAnon
@SenWhitehouse The reason they are uncorroborated is because Senator Feinstein decided it was preferable to score political points with Dr. Ford's story at the same time the Republicans decided to pass their nominee.  This is what rank partisanship gets you.  #botharetoblame
@msla07 @CNN Hopefully it will be before Judgement Day.  #notmuchlonger
Not even 5 hours and I'm already winning at Twitter.  #makingmoreshashtags #narcissism #ibelievesanta
@CNN Are we supposed to act like we really care what Jimmy Kimmel thinks now?  #icantactthatgood
@nytimes Wow, Beardo the partisan counsel is making a lot for a "Pro Bono" case.  #mkultrahandler
@KamalaHarris Cool!  I love pointless petitions that accomplish nothing!  Can we scream helplessly at the sky next?  #chickenlittle
@SenGillibrand I would say let's not try to pretend that this entire thing has not been handled on both sides in a rank partisan manner, but then again, you are a politician.  #wearedoomed
@msla07 @CNN Sometimes, we have to set aside how we wished the world worked, and look at how it actually does work.
@kswesq @Citizencrack @nytimes Yes, but the FBI's definition of credible and the Senate and Media's definition of credible are two entirely different things.
@nytimes Our "facts" are your propaganda.  Fixed it for you.  #allnewsisfake
@Citizencrack @nytimes Yes it did.  Feinstein sent the letter and information she had to the FBI.  They saw there was not enough information to go on, so they just sent it along to the White House.  It is what happened, regardless what hacks on both sides say.  #TRUTH
@msla07 @CNN Ummm, hate to break it to you, but there is a reason the FBI passed.  She does not have enough information to actually pursue anything.  Did something happen to her?  Yes.  She simply does not have enough details to actually press charges.  #lawislaw
@CNN Anyone else wonder why she looked more uncomfortable while the Democrats were waxing poetic about her bravery than when the prosecutor was asking her questions?  Also, what was with the controlling body language from Beardo the partisan counsel?  #MKultra
@CNN Less killers sounds like a good thing.  #savethefish
@nytimes Good thing the ABA is not in charge of investigations.  #FBIalreadypassed #notenoughinfo
@CNN Does this mean I need to go to the NRA for medical checkups now?  #ithinkitsgrowing
@CNN Neither side wants answers, they just want to win.  #TRUTH
@jasondhorowitz Can you prove that Hillary did not attend a Satanic Dinner?  Remember, credible accusations must be disproven rather than proven now.  #througthelookinglass  #bravenewworld
@colesprouse @dylansprouse @bobertpollson is definitely a shit account
I used to watch Professional Wrestling, but it just can't keep up with the news anymore.  #MAGA #metoo #walkaway #SMOD2020 #CPL #unicorns
