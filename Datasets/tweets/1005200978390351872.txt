Government Report Card is ramping up! We wanna hear about your concerns or enthusiasm for/about our elected officials. 		We also are looking for volunteers to spread the word. Become a Social Media Blaster today! Like and Retweet - lets do this!

Its a simple question but a good one to start off with...		Do you trust the US federal government?
We are going to start a weekly poll next week beginning with #WashingtonState - help us grade @GovInslee, @PattyMurray, and @SenatorCantwell. Grading will be based off issues they have set as their focus. Have they done well, some good/some bad, or have they failed to achieve?
Would you like to volunteer in getting the word out about the Government Report Card project? We are looking for avid social media users to share messages and updates. #GovReportCard #social_media - Volunteer as a #SocialMediaBlaster today!
@owebdevelopment Thank you so much for reaching out! We are not at the stage of starting the development process but will keep your inquiry on hand for when we reach that point.
@SteveWebDesign Thank you so much for reaching out! We are not at the stage of starting the development process but will keep your inquiry on hand for when we reach that point.
We need to hire website developers, admins, info gatherers, writers, PR, and more! This is a HUGE project for the people, by the people.
To those who follow this page - please share and Retweet this! We need to get the word out. A GoFundMe is in the process of being set up. A site this huge needs your support. We don't want gov or politician funding because we dont want to be beholden to anyone but the people!
@PonderingMindz @LarsLarsonShow It will also track promises made during elections like polls where you vote on whether each promise was addressed and/or kept. Big project!
With the US political atmosphere  as it is today, wouldn't you like a central place to view and rate your gov officials? Would you like an up to date website that tracks the promises made by your representatives? We are planning just that kind of site! Find out how you can help!
There will also be a profile page for each party. During presidential elections you can watch who is running for nomination and who the pick is for that party. Grade the party, grade the nominee.		What do you think?
@atlassheepdog @PonderingMindz Hello Atlas! While the vote is the most important way to get your voice heard, there has also been a lot of folks out there who would like an up to date central location to view opinions on their officials when the vote time comes around. Also, helpful to officials as well.
@PonderingMindz Thank you Pondering Mind! Glad to have you on our team. #LetsDoThis

What kind of things would you like to see on a site where you grade your government officials? 		Here are some of our ideas:		- Profile pages for each elected official	- Comment boards to voice your opinion on each profile	- Public and/or Anonymous ways to vote		ALL NON-PARTISAN
@JonnyBoGermany @PonderingMindz @elonmusk Thank you Bowen! Please RT too so we can get the word out. Its going to be a HUGE project.

We are putting the U.S. Government on notice. The American people are sick of the lies and want to remind you that you work for us, not the other way around. A project is under way to build a site where U.S. Citizens will be able to rate/grade their local, state, and fed govs.
