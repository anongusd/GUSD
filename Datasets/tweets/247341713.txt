@cbinaiea Hi Chris... I don't jest. Trump lies about so many things that no one believes more than half of what he says. It's not hate. I is just no Trust or Respect.	He came home after the last summit with such a glowing report. What happened? Nothing.	Same with China initially...
@RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul This is why the Trump administration did a foolish thing. They brought in all these laws without thinking what the consequences would be. Without having the resources in place! Without a plan!	This is just poor management!	NOT the immigrants fault. The numbers were going down!
@RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul So school boards need to adapt...classroom sizes need to be smaller. More teachers equals more jobs.
@RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul 2.We need more immigration judges! We need to give them due process in court QUICKLY, to get them off any assistance, so if they are accepted, they can work, pay tax. If they aren't, they are deported back. It's the backlog that is causing a lot of the problems...poverty.
@RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul Public assistance depends on the state but most don't allow it except for the women and children you prev mentioned.	But how are asylum seekers supposed to live?	They can't work legally. We are keeping them in our jails and detentions.	To me the Whole process needs to be speed up
@RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul None of that bothers me at all. I think it should be a matter of pride. It is taking care of pregnant mothers, infants and children. I would NEVER want to see ANY child suffer if we can help them in any way. It is biblical to take care of these, as well as the widows.
@RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul Approx 30% of those are Immigration Re-entry crimes ONLY.	But the numbers are high.	I think the system is to blame though for many. They come here and can't work legally. They wait over 2 years just to get a hearing before an immigration judge. So what do they live off?
@RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul 2. The wall is a nuisance only but not an insurmountable one for those who are determined.	I think after more wall is built, you will NOT find the drugs going down, nor the Gangs reducing, nor the criminals gone. Nor significant decrease in illegals	It is just political rhetoric!
@RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul The wall IS effective there. The reason? They just cross the border elsewhere. So those statistics really don't mean anything overall.	Again...anyone who wants to get across will...over with a ladder, under with a shovel, through with a blow torch, or around by sea or air.
@twitasiahk @charliekirk11 Thanks for the article. It was interesting. I agreed with most of it. Except I don't recall anyone saying that the reason we should allow immigration, is to decrease World Poverty!	I also think that, just because we can't change the World's poverty, that we shouldn't help some!
@thecoffeebarons @tracybeanz Then say 'bad infrastructure'. Say 'corruption' although that's wrong in that they ALL aren't corrupt.	But he didnt because he wasnt talking about those things.	He was talking IMMIGRANTS from sh-t hole countries!	That's clearly RACISM, by any standard!
https://t.co/uXwURJuv7q
@thecoffeebarons @RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul The other post about racism was a response to a different Twitter conversation.
@thecoffeebarons @RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul Dream on..
@twitasiahk @charliekirk11 Have you ever talked with these unfortunate people?	Do you have any idea what they are escaping and what extreme things they will do for a safer better life?	To think that they won't come is unrealistic. They will just risk their lives more. And we will be accountable for that!
@twitasiahk @charliekirk11 Isreals wall is only 400 miles long. It is one of the most highly militarized borders in the world, with massive military presence and all its support of guns, helicpoters, drones, several layers of razor wire, etc.	This Wall is no comparison!
@thecoffeebarons @tracybeanz Seriously?	I think you have a big problem if you don't see that one!	Encompassing whole countries as " sh_t holes". Whole nations?	Really?
@thecoffeebarons @RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul It gets more dangerous for the immigrants crosing the deserts, going under the walls, going over the walls, for the people paying human traffickers.	These are desperate people. They will come anyway. Now the risk will be greater and more lives will be lost!
@twitasiahk @charliekirk11 Human  Trafficking will contiune. It will just be more dangerous, more costly for them in money and lives!	But they will still come....
@thecoffeebarons @tracybeanz Trump calling African countries "Shot Hole countries..."	There one big one for You!
@thecoffeebarons @RedCaligirl6 @steph93065 @RandPaul It is a tempory deterrant...I think the human trafficking will just get more dangerous and more expensive putting more lives at risk than ever before.

But Trump wanted to go alone. Americans are paying the consequences of those Tarrifs still.
@chupacabra66 @DerekMAGA2020 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse We have had the biggest GDP in the world for decades! Although it grew faster in 2017 under Trump but it has slowed down in 2018. So Trump get slight credit but not for having the biggest GDP.	Canada gave over very little and America lost a friend because of Trumps bully methods
@chupacabra66 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse I agree that no administration, with its thousands of workers is beyond corruption.

@DerekMAGA2020 @chupacabra66 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Your facts are wrong.Not true.	There are many articles to support this.	Here's one financial one.	https://t.co/ME85GXtAId
@DerekMAGA2020 @chupacabra66 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Spending one trillion a year?	That's 4 trillion over 4 years?	You are wrong.

Look at 2014, 2015, etc.
@DerekMAGA2020 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 4.

Yet we take it for granted today.
@DerekMAGA2020 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 3. Unions..Trump has reduced or removed many of the employee safety standards that unions have fought for. So employees breathe more cancerous products in their air, have more dangerous jobs.	But apparent you support all these cutbacks.	People forget that Unions gave them...
@DerekMAGA2020 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 2. Unions ONLY have power to fight for employee changes if they have all people supporting them. Otherwise a union can threaten to go on strike but half the workers don't belong, so they keep working and nothing happens. Greedy employers keep their money.
@DerekMAGA2020 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse He has weakened Unions by making laws that people can "choose to contribute."	Sounds good. But the problem is that initially a few may choose not to contribute but they get the same benifits unions do. After a while, a lot will refuse to contribute thereby weakening unions power
@DerekMAGA2020 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Trump is TRYINGto get all inheritance tax dropped (probably so his kids can get ALL his money, even though he has probably paid very little tax...that's why he is hiding it.)	Dems want an inheritance tax over 10 million. That's reasonable. The "little" guys wont get affected.
@DerekMAGA2020 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse The top tier SHOULD pay more tax.1% owns over 50% of America's wealth.They do it on the backs of workers.	Although this is business and not personal tax, How do you feel about a huge company like Amazon paying nothing in American taxes in 2017?	That's because OUR laws allow this.

The problem with Trump is that he backs out of everything without a better plan or often with no plan at all. So HE has lost the faith of other leaders and most of his experts, who have quit.

But during good economic times, a gov't should try to reduce spending and try to balance the budget at least, if not REDUCE the national debt!	But Trump keeps OVER spending of a Trillion a year,  despite the lowest unemployment rate, instead of trying to balance the budget.

@katcald @l_jxson @DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse READ the words..."Drugs and alchohol" are in every country!
@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump It is NOT "KILLED". No one is killing babies! That's propaganda!	Cong Abnormalities die because they are UNABLE to live! They don't have a brain or kidneys, etc.	Healthy "abortion babies" are usually born at 20 to 24 weeks premature, most of them being way too premature to live.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @senatemajldr @l_jxson The bill talks about a live babe being born after abortion.	An "late abortion" is an induction of labor. These babies are induced for different reasons...one being severe abnormalities like little or no brain or no kidneys. They are born alive but die within hours or days of life
@AwesomeGodMAGA @senatemajldr @l_jxson Yes I did read it.	The problem is lawmakers who DO NOT understand the intricacies of birth, health and life, should NOT be making those decisions. Each case is individual and needs to be assessed individually and expertly depending on many medical factors.	One law can't cover it
@FiddlerForest @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You still do not understand. This is why having people who DO NOT understand health care should NOT be making laws! The medical world needs to make these decisions.	They are not "incompatible with life" because they are aborted but because of prematurity and their abnormalities!
@l_jxson @DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse What?	You think one doesn't have the freedom to look for other jobs in DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM?	People change jobs ALL the time. Same amount of freedom. 	What on earth are you reading?	There is complete freedom in Canada!
@l_jxson @DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Raising the minimum wage has little effect on inflation. It just helps people get off welfare. If you make less or the same going to work over welfare, most would stay in welfare.	Raising everyone's wages significantly does up inflation but that's not what we are talking about.
@l_jxson @Bonzer56 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Experts in one small area.
@DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse The problem is "money is power". They want power.	Trump gives his big donors positions in govt. They control the EPA, the Education dept, the courts, etc.	So you are happy with allowing these 1% to control your gov't? Usually people who have inherited the money! Not experts?
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse That's because it's a capitalist society. That means for profit! Profiting off people's need to have education. Putting prices up because they can. That's why some govt regulation is GOOD for the people.	Statistics show the rich just want more money in their pockets.
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Increased inflation?	At $15 an hour?	Really?	In Canada, people keep their own doctor..they are his clients.	No big deal.	We have talked about how to pay for universal health care..just like every other country that has it does.	We are supposed to be the richest in the world!
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse People have taken unions for granted because they have been there for so long. But after losing them For a while, they will regret it. 	People gave their LIVES to fight for workers rights out of necessity! 	Companies were treating employees very badly. It will happen again!
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Leslie..if you take away the money, you take away the power!	If one choses not to pay union dues,  they should NOT get any of the wage increases, benifits or safety measures the union has fought for.	Initially they will match it but over time, as more drop away, they wont.
@katcald @l_jxson @DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Alchohol and drugs are a huge problem. Again, they are in every country, yet they do NOT have the high percentage of gun violence that we do.	It is accessabilty to guns here! 	That is by far the biggest factor. 	If you can't get a gun, it's hard to shoot yourself or someone else.
@l_jxson @vertigoagain @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse They are recommending that Estate taxes would ONLY kick in for those who are to inherit over $10 million!	It would not affect the average person like you or I.
@l_jxson @katcald @DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse I agree this is a factor. 	But most other westernized countries have deinstitutionalized their mental health clients as well, WITHOUT a resulting increase in gun violence. 	So clearly the problem is much more than that!
@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump That is what I am saying. The Parents of infants at that age, no matter the circumstances, have the right to chose aggressive treatment or to NOT chose it!	If they chose it, they may be in for a lifetime of caring for a severely handicapped child due to its severe immaturity.
@katcald @l_jxson @DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse And easy acessabiluty to get guns!
@katcald @l_jxson @DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Just what has this POTUS done to help them?	Please list...
@katcald @l_jxson @DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse But you are voting for Trump who has made NO policies to help with the homelessness. In fact, he has made it harder to get Medicare for them, harder to get social assistance, taken funding away from safe needle drops.	He has NOT increased minimum wages.	Not added assisted housing
@l_jxson @katcald @RealJamesWoods @nanc_eeeee The question is and will be, whether or not there IS a National Emergency!	Congress says NO.	The CIA has NOT mentioned any Emergency at Southern border, which is their area of expertise.	The Representatives on the Border States say it isn't an emergency.	The Statistics show none
@LaurieF21757404 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Laurie...I am just saying that it's not impossible that one or two insane "doctors" have done it but I have no evidence of that. 	It is NOT done anywhere within the system that I have ever seen nor ever heard of. 	We fight to save these little lives, NOT KILL them!
@chupacabra66 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse No one is being fooled here. Its looking at their policies!	Dropping taxes for the rich so they pay no more than the working class. 	It's stopping inheritance tax on the rich.	It's giving Important govt positions to wealthy donors.	It's keeping tax evasion loopholes open.	Etc..
@chupacabra66 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Why are the GOP always looking backwards and blaming someone else for their problems?	Why cannot they live in the present?	Why can't they hold the present accountable?	Its like a Child with his hand caught in the cookie jar saying..I didnt do it..my brother took it 2 years ago!
@chupacabra66 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Please tell me what are the wonderful new values if the GOP?

@AwesomeGodMAGA @senatemajldr @l_jxson 5. So, I think those decisions should be made by the medical community along with the parents. No law can begin to cover all the intricacies.	If I had my way, there would be NO abortion but if babe is born alive at 23 weeks, ie, that decision should be left up to Dr and family.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @senatemajldr @l_jxson 4. Many are dependant on help for the rest of their lives to eat, to do everything. So even if it is NOT an abortion but an early spontaneous delivery, parents are still given the choice whether they want aggressive treatment or not. At what point do we say enough is enough.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @senatemajldr @l_jxson 3. ..chance to live. They are on ventilators often for months. Their heart may stop 4 to 5 times and they have to be brought back to life. If they live, they have a good chance of having cerebral palsy, have chronic chest problems for life plus other complications.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @senatemajldr @l_jxson 2. A law like this cannot undrstand the intricacies of life during and after birth. These little ones are probably only 22 to 24 weeks old. Life is very difficult and critical at the best of times. They have a 10% to 60% at the very best, chance to live even...
@AwesomeGodMAGA @senatemajldr @l_jxson Hello.	Again to make it clear, I do NOT support abortion. But I also DO NOT support lies. Most, if not all, of the accusations floating around have little or no TRUTH in them.	I would not support this bill because, although I agree with the text in General, a law like this cannot
@FiddlerForest @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Sorry..that was "parents"
@danrockss @Chad_Smith013 @eugenegu @OmarKelly @realDonaldTrump I dont agree with New Yorks law...but still, it needs to leave those decisions with the medical staff who understand the intricacies of the situation. The GOP bill does not do this and thats why it is NOT a good bill.
@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump David...unless you have stood at the bedside of these situations like I have, you cannot understand. Drs and nurses fight to save lives, NOT KILL them. 	But just because we have the technology to "save" lives, it doesn't mean we always should.	Sorry, but you don't understand.
@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Drs and families make these "end of life decisions" almost daily in hospitals...At what point do you stop treatment and let them go?	That is probably why they don't want laws, that don't understand the edical intricacies of life to be making those decisions...
@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump 2. Remember none of these babies would survive without very aggressive treatment, their hearts often stopping numerous times and being "brought back to life".	It is not dissimilar to end of life decisions. At one point do you say no to treatment. At what point do you let them go?
@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Remember these "healthy" babies are maybe only 22 or 24 weeks old. They need weeks or months on a respirator with maybe only a 10% to 60% chance of making it	Even parents who do not want an abortion are given the option of NOT doing treatment because of risks
@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump David, we are talking severe congenital abnormalities that are NOT compatible with life. They are wrapped in warm blankets and cuddled by their parents till they take their last breathe. It is a very sad event with everyone, even Drs and Nurses eyes filling with tears.
@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the article.	As mentioned...I do not support abortion but I DO support the telling of TRUTH.	MOST of the GOP articles are accusations that have little or no TRUTH in them. 	INFANTICIDE is illegal in America.
@Bonzer56 @GOPChairwoman @l_jxson @realDonaldTrump A Wall is a sense of FALSE SECURITY. 	They only need an outdoor ladder, a shovel, or a cutting torch!	They will still get in.

@DavidYoder13 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump If you understood the complexities of birth, you would not sign this either. Sometimes a pregnancy with a FETUS who is NOT viable, due to abnormalities, is induced early on. Many would call that an abortion. Yet it is only brings on the birth early of a Child who would die anyway

The FBI, by putting details together, KNOW who is telling the truth now. Cohen will NOW tell the TRUTH...	his prison sentence depends on it!!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Let's see if the president brings home anything concrete...	That will be the test!	Hopefully it's more than just another photo op.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Because they know that Trump is insincere. Look at his other policies.	That it is a political move only.	Because he specifically is trying to go after Iran!	When many other eastern nations do similar human rights violations.	Perhaps he should be addressing women's rights!!
@seanhannity The ULTRA RICH pay almost the same amount of taxes  as the MIDDLE CLASS yet they make 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times more! Thanks to Donald Trump!	They hold 90% of the America's wealth!	THEY SHOULD PAY MORE TAX!

@RepMarkMeadows Many, many including probably Don Jr. are all guilty of lying to Congress.	Trump has surrounded himself with liars, cheaters and criminals. What's the chance that he is scott free?	Almost nil!
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse I agree Leslie. 	Give them a living minimum wage though. 	Help with more non for profit housing. 	Free Medicare.	Free training to upgrade skills	Elderly and disabled need a living wage though..something they can live off of.

@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse They have enough?	Making $7 an hour, having to work three jobs just to pay rent and buy food?	That's enough?	Really?
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Plastic straws are killing our wildlife in the sea, in the air and on our land. We should be willing to do that without govt control because we care about the creatures God gave us.
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse You are talking welfare and welfare only. There are lots of other ways to help them instead.	1. Living minimum wage	2. Universal health care	3. Free education to retrain	4. More non for profit housing	5. Better afforyable public transport to get to their jobs.	Etc...
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Giving a $15 minimum wage doesn't help the poor?	Giving annual cost of living wage increases doesn't help the people?	Giving Seniors and the disabled a living wage doesn't help them?	Companies passing on some of profit to the workers, instead of their own pockets, doesn't help?
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Please, again, tell me what freedoms you are talking about that Big Business, Small government gives you?	Everyone quotes it but what does it mean to you?	What actual difference does it make in your life?
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 2. Not closing loopholes so the rich to hide their money in tax havens like offshore banks, Shell Companies, etc.	Allowing buybacks of company shares, concentrating the wealth in the rich.	Removing the power of unions that fight for pay increases or safety standards for workers.
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse I have not pointed out greed in individuals of one party. Almost all politicians are very rich.

@DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse How many jobs have actually been added because of the tax cuts...very few in the steel industry with no new plants, very few in the coal industry with no new plants. Companies as just putting the profits in the pockets of their shareholders and very few are reinvesting it back in
@DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 3. Debt is skyrocketing on the backs of the working class people. The rich pay virtually the same tax as the middle class but they have tax loopholes, offshore Shell Companies, offshore banks and get away with paying little or nothing, despite owning 50 to 90% of America's wealth
@DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 2. Corperations are no longer passing profits on to their workers like they used to. They are rebuying back shares, concentrating more wealth in fewer hands. All these things are just widening the gap between the rich and the poor.	Meanwhile our national debt is skyrocketing..
@DougRowe1973 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Thanks for your comments.	I do not like the new tax cuts. The very rich saved millions on taxes while the average worker may have saved a few hundred a year.	I disagree with over 50% of America's wealth being owned by 1% of the population and 90% owned by 10%.
@Newsweek So give them a $15 living minimum wage, with yearly cost of living increases. Allow them to work  and to make that work pay enough to live!	Make companies share their profits with their workers!
@GovMikeHuckabee The Green New Deal is a long term project over decades, gradually replacing old technology with NEW. It is forward thinking, carrying about future generations and NOT just about corperate GREED for today's rich!

@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump How are we going to take care of them? You like the idea that the rich pay little or no tax.	You don't want government programs to help them. Funny how you say you want to help "our own" but resist any ploicy that might do exactly that.	 Rather hypocritical I think.
@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Only if they meet the requirements.	And why not?	Are you going to deny a Child the chance to better themselves? You want them to stay poor and uneducated forever?	Statistics show by the second generation they are contributing very well to our society, including lots of taxes
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump They will still come. Poverty here is still much safer and manageable than poverty There!
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Look up the clips from his earlier campaigns?	Over and over he said a "Big Beautiful WALL from sea to sea"!

@l_jxson @maraz678x @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump One or two at most are advocating to tear down the present barrier. Most ALL disagree. We have some extreme left wing people, like you have some extreme right wing people.	That as you know does NOT MAKE PARTY POLICY, But when you listen to the crap Trump posts, one would think so
@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Leslie..it's NOT about " hate". You know that. 	It's about bad policy, ineffective decisions, and emotional, untrue rhetoric.
@l_jxson @GolfCartQueen @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump He couldn't get all of his own GOP to agree. If he could not persuade a few Dems that it was necessary to get the 60 votes, then clearly it wasn't believable or not good policy.
@l_jxson @GolfCartQueen @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The courts will decide that. Clearly that is a very debatable issue. For my understanding it is AGAINST the CONSTITUTION! 	"Loopholes" are an abuse of the intent of the CONSTITUTION.
@l_jxson @GolfCartQueen @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Can you please send me the info on these 10 areas please, that all 3 departments requested?
@l_jxson @imowired @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Did you even read my response?	I said I don't hate. 	Did you read her tweet to me?	Be fair Leslie...
@l_jxson @imowired @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Leslie..I am responding to another tweet who again told me I am full of hate. I get that all the time from GOP yet I dont swear at them, I dont name call, I am not rude to them.	That's why the word " hate " is in quotations marks because it was NOT my use of the word but theirs!
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump 2. Help reduce their poverty, help by increasing trade to improve their economy.	We are doing it for Venezuela now, who's problems don't affect us, yet we won't do it for the Central American countries that do affect us!	Why? Oil!
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump And it only takes one ladder or one metal cutter or one shovel to get over, through or under a WALL in minutes or hours.	There is no perfect system that will keep them out if they want to get in...they will get in.	The answer is to help their countries get rid of the corruption.
@l_jxson @clarice36252244 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yes it slows them down for a day or two but at what cost to the public?  How much difference does a day or two make? In the long run?		I appreciate you too but clearly we disagree on this!
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump 3. If you lived in circumstances like that, (and throw in poverty, no chance to escape or improve), are you going to tell me you wouldn't risk almost everything to have a better life for your family?
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump There are all kinds of wars...wars against the people from corruption, from drug cartels. 	You think it only counts when you are murdered, if it's by another govt?
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Have you lived there?	Have you even visited there?	Do you know what it's like to not trust anyone, NOT the police, NOT the judges, NOT the gov't. To be afraid to step outside your home in case you get raped or murdered?	To pay the little money you do make in extortion fees?
@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yes Leslie...I have said several times that Trump has started to see the reality of his "campaign WALL"....It's weaknesses, it's huge problems, huge cost, that BORDER SECURITY involves so much more than a inadequate wall. These are things the Dems have been saying ALL ALONG.
@ben07ben07 @JR_22159 @l_jxson @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Have you ever thought that they are being responsible about hard earned tax payer DOLLARS to deliver the MOST EFFECTIVE BORDER SECURITY for the money?	That a WALL is not effective unless it's supported by extensive technology, huge amounts of manpower, infrastructure like roads
@elkhunternm @AndrewPollackFL @l_jxson What point of American Law do YOU NOT understand... that they, refugees, have the LEGAL RIGHT to apply for ASYLUM and to receive their due process in front an Immigration Judge?
@leslie7855 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 2. Who deserves it?	THE RICH, who make the decisions borrow the money, go bankrupt, often numerous times using others money (Trump went bankrupt 6 TIMES for hundreds of millions each time) or..	THE WORKERS, who do ALL the work, making it possible for the rich to get wealthy?
@leslie7855 @OliverMcGee @l_jxson @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse Who said they weren't? There are many who are not wealthy though...comfortable but not excessively weathly.	Most politicians are fairly weathly..on both sides!		But the point is NOT about the politicians but their POLICIES on HOW to divide up America's WEALTH. 	Who deserves it?
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump A barrier works in high traffic areas. But only when it is accompanied with lots of technology and high levels of manpower, lots of infrastructure, roads, etc.	Otherwise, people who want to cross just find another method or area to cross.
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The areas where it was most benificial was completed then. The Rio Grande Valley could also benefit and 55 miles of barrier was granted for there with the last bill. Elsewhere it is NOT effective. Other types of border security are better suited for the cost.
@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump 2. Trump realized how foolish and how impossible this 2000 mile wall truly was!
@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump "Trumps, which puts politics over safety"?	I don't think you meant to say that but I totally agree with the statement!	This was about Trump, his foolish promise and his political loss if he didn't carry it through.	He gave up his idea of a full wall over a year ago because he...
@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump 2. ...But the feelings, purposes, words and the intent behind them, is what is hurtful and DOES NOT represent the VALUES this country was built on!	That ALL are created equal...
@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump A wall is useful in certain highly populated areas. Stop.	Trump "vision" of a coast to coast brick wall concept to keep the "rapists" and "criminals" out, and sold in those very terms is what is racist, immoral and evil.	Bricks themselves provoke no feelings but the ideas...
@JR_22159 @l_jxson @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump But your point was, he was going to cross a border checkpoint, they saw him and they caught them.	What therefore does this have to do with a Wall?
@ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @l_jxson @realDonaldTrump Researching facts to determine truth!	I watch non biased news or only very slightly biased news. I get live news and most from tweets from POTUS, all senators, all representatives, both sides of the equation.	Why do you assume all Dems watch CNN or MSNBC?	We search for TRUTH!
@Eileen2rte @AndrewPollackFL @l_jxson No...crime is always terrible and a scourge to our society. 	But to expect any single race to be perfect, to have no crime, when their crime is already 1/2 of what ours is, is hypocritical.

@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump A SMART WALL...A lot more effective...now they monitor them, identify them, track them before or after till they are stopped.	https://t.co/L9k5X1C3NA
@l_jxson @JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The "caravans of thousands" come to the border entries, to apply for asylum. As is their LEGAL right!	A WALL won't stop them!	You are decieved!	Here is GOP Hurd's SMART Wall	https://t.co/L9k5X1C3NA
@l_jxson @clarice36252244 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump EXCEPT, don't you get it?	90% of the drugs are smuggled in at border crossings.	A WALL won't help that.	Nor will it stop the cartels...They will get their drugs through no matter what...a few steel slats won't stop them.	So it's just a sense of "expensive false security"!
@l_jxson @GolfCartQueen @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump A Wall does NOT protect the border. BORDER Security does. He was given the money for the additional things he requested, including judges, etc. but just 1.38 billion for 55 miles of actual wall in the Rio Grande Valley, a place where it could be most useful	That solves the crises
@l_jxson @GolfCartQueen @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump A "National Emergency", to get money against the wishes of CONGRESS, is against the CONSTITUTION.	Congress was given the  "Control of the Purse" for the very reason to control the President!
@l_jxson @GolfCartQueen @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Except he had control of Congress for two whole years!
@JR_22159 @ben07ben07 @GOPChairwoman @l_jxson @realDonaldTrump If you think the Dems support only surveillance cameras, you are poorly informed!
@sookie1_ @politico 17 % more?	Are you kidding me?	That would be a very noticeable amount!!	That would be $100 to $170 a week more, depending on your wage for the mid wage earner! OR $400 to $680 month!!	I think people would've noticed that!	But they haven't, have they?	Because it's NOT TRUE!
@David03593245 I appreciate that. Knowledge is invaluable. But we need to have balanced fact based knowledge. We need to constantly double check the facts. We need to try to NOT pass on the emotional hate and divisive language.	I need to remind myself of that too from time to time too.
@David03593245 I appreciate that!
@David03593245 Thanks David
@pattigorges1 @thehill Coal jobs are temporary as machines do more and manpower is needed less. In fact during 2017, men were laid off.	WV has to find new ways to make money. They have to diversify like the rest of the world has.
@pattigorges1 @thehill In WV, they are stripping off mountain tops, wasting the Lumber, to strip mine the coal.( They need much fewer workers than in deep mines). They are filling the valleys with rock, destroying the landscape, contaminating the water, and all for a few hundred more tempory jobs?
@l_jxson https://t.co/SXT5pxEYZm
@imowired @GOPChairwoman @l_jxson @realDonaldTrump But needing all these other "means" is exactly the point	A WALL is the most expensive of ALL OPTIONS, yet it is the least effective on its own. So after spending all those billions, it still needs technology, more manpower, more infrastructure at border crossings, more mantinance
@imowired @GOPChairwoman @l_jxson @realDonaldTrump I don't hate. Not at ALL!	It's so funny because I NEVER mention "hate".	Yet over and over again, it's the GOP TWEETS  who swear at me, insult me, call me names and tell me I am full of "hate"	Are you so full of it yourself that you see it in everyone else? Even if it's not there?
@stevemur @CarlosAndinoJr @l_jxson They are Democratic Socialist blend with a market economy.

@stevemur @CarlosAndinoJr @l_jxson Every country listed has or has had Democratic Socialist governments at some time.

@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 4. The GOP employ scare tactics of "corrupt dictatorships", to frighten them. They are not informed enough to understand that that has NOTHING to do with democratic socialism.	They play on their ignorance.
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 3. And yet the GOP, with the class of people who would benifite MOST  from any sort of social plans, are the ones who are indoctrinated to refuse ANY plans to improve our society. They don't understand that they are voting for the greedy to be MORE greedy!	They don't understand.
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse 2. They would rather that 90% of the nation's wealth and power stay in the hands of very few, (less than 10% of the people).	How will that actively help the unfortunate?	The divide is getting further and further apart. With less and less people having more and more of the wealth.
@l_jxson @hongliuli @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ElbertGuillory @WhiteHouse If we continue on in a pure capitalist way, our citizens will never be cared for more than they are now. It's odd that GOP capitalists say that about our country but have no desire to do anymore about it. They fight any sort of Democratic Socialism plans that cares for citizens!

@David03593245 @MargaretheBrac2 @BridgetKF30 @DNC Archives of the earth?	Suddenly you believe in science?	Or just the science you WANT to believe in?
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC Trump, instead of working to change things within a partnership or an agreement, likes to walk out like a spoiled child! He did that with the TPP, with the Paris Accord, with NAFTA, with the Russia Missile Agreement, with the IRAN deal.	Now no one trusts or respects us anymore!
@David03593245 A respectful child learns to walk away. A belligerent, disrespectful teenager doesn't.	I didn't watch all of it but about 45 minutes of it.	So why does he have the right to sue?	Personally I hope the case gets thrown out because a win would encourage other kids to do the same.
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC Please explain this comment.	My MONEY?	Them, I assume you mean govt controls, having power over me?	I would rather a social caring democratic govt have the power rather than greedy corperations who refuse to share their wealth, or protect my safety, or the conditions I work in!
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC David, be serious. We can't change It? We can't stop It?	We can't stop clearing all the forests?	Or stop contaminating the water?	Or stop polluting the air?	Or stop building mountains of garbage?	Or stop wasting 1/3 of our food?	Or stop encroaching on wild life inhabitant?
@MargaretheBrac2 @BridgetKF30 @David03593245 @DNC Thanks dear but I am over 60!	The violent weather patterns have definitely accelerated! They were always there but NOT as frequently!
@BridgetKF30 @David03593245 @DNC That's why the Paris Climate Accord. So ALL countries would feel pressured to participate. But Trump, who could be one of the most positive influential leaders, turned his back on it and walked away! MONEY and Corporate GREED of his supporters and lobbyists was more important!
@David03593245 David..He could have backed up and walked away. THAT would have diffused the situation. That's what most of us would've done. But he refused to and defiantly held his ground, knowing it was aggravating the situation.
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC The irony of it all is that you and I won't benifit. Unless you own a massive company.	Yet the RICH and POWERFUL lie and indoctrinate us, the workers, to fight their battles for them.	To what avail?
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC David..five years at most, over 50 years?	10 years over 75 years?	15 years over 100 years?	What kind if a legacy are you leaving your grandchildren and great grandchildren?	Trees all gone, most of the water contaminated, air barely breathable?	All for selfish greed of a few rich
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC 3. Would you publish something that not only would cost you your job but make it difficult for you to ever work in that field again, because of powerful corperations and lobbying?
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC 2. This is the same way that scientsts working for drug companies only release what the drug companies want...such as the whole Percocet/OPIOD pill abuse scandal. True statistics are hidden, all for corperate greed, not for TRUTH. So they are NOT to be trusted!
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC The reason govt funded scientists support climate change is because they CAN be impartial. 	Private corperations pay the "scientists" to study only what they want, how they want it, and when they want. They ONLY publish information benificial to the corperations. Pretty obvious!
@David03593245 @BridgetKF30 @DNC There are repeated patterns of climate throughout history but never at such an accelerated rate. Never have we had the violent weather patterns so frequently.. Many types of species have become extinct or are endangered. We are clearing the forests that used to cleaned our planet
@Sherry27557249 @DailyCaller Taxes are graduated according to wages...They are similar for lower and middle class but since Trump removed many of the taxes for the rich and the ultra Rich in America, Canada's rich pay a greater percentage.

@BoomBoom1953 @GOP You are right. It is a state issue and 3 states still have it in their law.  Although rarely used as lethal injection is most common. But drug companies don't want them using drugs to kill people so they can't get the drugs anymore.

@l_jxson Leslie..we have come a long way...in many areas racism has been all but wiped out. In many other areas, it is alive and growing.	There has been a lot of hate shown on Twitter in the comments towards Central American's...that's Not Mainstream media...that's individual people.
@massdelusion221 @paulholbrook5 @dbongino @CNN @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @FoxNews I watch news that is only slightly biased. Mostly PBS and BBC. Mostly I get my news straight from the source...I get tweets from ALL senators and representatives, govnt from BOTH PARTIES. Also from many news sources, even Brietbart. 	I make up my own mind. 	But thanks anyways.

@pattigorges1 @thehill Trump doesn't care about the Legacy we leave for our grandchildren or our great granchildren, if the Lord tarries!	TRUMP only cares about using the earth today, to make profit TODAY!

@David03593245 He can't continue his education?	Really?	Because he was seen on camera as being rude?	This is just greed.	But once they found out more information about the whole situation, the news stories cleared him.	So he wasn't taunting him. He certainly wasn't being respectful.

@Jewsky2 @CBNNews WHITE Supremists or not, he clearly stated that he sees nothing wrong with being a White Supremist! That says it in itself!	He clearly is racist...his comments on many things indicate that. The WORLD has changed. America has changed. You can't go back 100 years ago.
@Sherry27557249 @DailyCaller EVERYONE pays for it in their taxes.	Canada's taxes may be sl higher at the present but their wages are significantly higher in many areas than the USA.

@massdelusion221 @paulholbrook5 @dbongino @CNN @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @FoxNews Where do you get this garbage?	I looked it up and there isn't ONE reputable web site that says anything about this?	Not ONE of them have any evidence, any statistics...it's all garbage! 	What on earth are you filling your mind with?
@Sherry27557249 @DailyCaller 2. Some provinces have some private clinics for MRIs, etc, which reduces that waiting list but generally if your condition warrants it, it is done right away! Overall a great system.
@Sherry27557249 @DailyCaller I have spent much time in Canada working as a nurse. 	The health care system is not perfect but is still excellent. Urgent cases are handled immediately. Elective cases wait a little longer depending on the surgery or the city. But it's totally free for everyone.
@David03593245 Most of the Mainstream NEWS is  factual. They get sued if they aren't. It's OPINIONS that are biased. 	There is "news" sources that CLAIM to be news but have little or NO factual information in them. These include The Daily Caller, the Drudge Report, Beitbart. They are not NEWS.
@Scott72696541 @NBCNews @CevallosLaw The Smolliet case is incredibly sad!

Yet Trump makes a huge deal about any minor infractions of the Dems. He also DISMANTLED the Voter Fraud Commission
@pattigorges1 @DonaldJTrumpJr Perhaps not the first day but since when did that ever stop Trump from talking about it. 	I get a lot of people complaing the media doesn't present the violence against the GOP but here is a clear example, one of many, that shows the White House SAYS NOTHING about Dem Violence.
@Jabba53e @PressSec @David03593245 They are often called Three Houses...the WHITE HOUSE is headquarters for the Executive Branch!	The Executive Branch is far more than just the POTUS. It includes the VP,  the CABINET, as he delegates the Presidential Powers to them, etc.
@l_jxson But it is not an area of many races...mostly, if not all, white. Poor probably but not understanding of different racial backgrounds.

@paulholbrook5 @dbongino @CNN @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @FoxNews Russia probe far from over. The Senate Investigation is NOT done yet. The House investigation is just getting started.
@Techtronix5 @dbongino This is concerning in that 22 million users get distorted news from a source that is considered Extreme Right Wing, that promotes anger and division in America. 	Hopefully they also watch some unbiased news to get a better perspective!
@dbongino Keep passing on FAKE NEWS Dan! Please keep DIVIDING America!	It seems clear that you want violence and war, NOT unity and peace.	People like you are the PROBLEM MAKERS!
@dbongino It's not scary at all when you are considering that he was PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE from a POTUS who quite possibly as CONSPIRACING with a Foreign Enemy!!	McCabe was just doing his JOB! And well, might I add!
@dclark551 @David03593245 @POTUS READ the WHOLE THING.	This tweet is more Fake Information, twisted till it isn't truth.	She also said	Pelosi added, “I don’t think that there’s any difference between Democrats and Republicans on our relationship with NATO. This is not partisan in any way.”
@shoenutz1950 @jimsciutto Clearly, it takes a police INVESTIGATION to uncover the facts. 	If we waited till every investigation was done, news would hardly be reporting on anything. They have been openly publishing the deception since they knew the truth!

@David03593245 @PressSec Thanks for the info David.	The problem is that there is little difference between the lower and middle incomes gaps. Perhaps 40 to $60,000. But at $200,000 there now is a gap of $300,000! With a tax increase of only 3%. Then over $500,000, it's unlimited with only a 2% increase!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Gun restrictions help a lot. But NOT when one state has it and the next doesn't. 60% of guns in Chicago come from other states	Look at Statistics. America has by FAR, the highest percentage of gun deaths in the civilized world. That's because it's the ONLY ONE without gun control
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 50 % of illegals overstay their VISAS. AND a wall will not stop those who really want to come in. There always will be illegals as long as their is poverty! Get past it. Look more at how we can help them in their own country, keeping them there.	Like Trump is helping Venezuela!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson As I mentioned, Trump ONLY meets with those who fit his agenda. 	And he's sure to politicize it! 	He's sure to get a photo op!	Nancy meets with hers privately without the Big Show Trump likes to put on. 	But clearly it's working for his base.

@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I don't agree with abortion but I do agree with most everything she does.

@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2...Prefer to think rationally about it rather than emotionally. I think using emotional words like "hate" doesn't help anyone, especially me. It creates anger, bitterness and more hate. It also prevents one from seeing logically.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I do agree that traditional values are often not tolerated.

@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Crime IS lawlessness! 	I agree about the lack of respect of authority and lack of discipline. They have become lost values!  But that's universal and NOT specific to immigrants, legal or otherwise.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Thanks for sharing this. It is dreadful isn't it.	I don't call Trump racist for anything I have read. I base it on his tweets and live footage of his own words. That is all.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Even if you had to leave America for so.e horrible reason, would you not still love the country that you came from?
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots I agree..Almost all Democrats agree as well. 	Does that surprise you? 	But if they come in illegally, we want them to be treated with compassion and respectfully as human beings. 	As Christ would.

@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Most places have unions to prevent that, certainly the state workers should.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Give me facts...	Give me evidence..	In today's world, one has to have a long record of complaints to fire anyone. One cannot fire someone without clear evidence, certainly NOT on political views. Perhaps on thier attitude or behaviour or their inability to get along with others.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Where do you get this information?	Do you double check your sites for impartiality? 	Do you look up the media bias of your sources?	Do you research each one?	Do you fact check?	If you want to know the TRUTH, you will do this.	Until then, you are very succesptable to propaganda!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson It concerns me that you choose a Leader, Vote on a Leader, NOT on his policies (aside from abortion), nor his Character but rather on emotions after watching opposing "hate propaganda" and a distrust of the media.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson It is not the MEDIA that's his worst enemy. It's his own SELF thats the problem, in his tweets, his rhetoric, his own speech, when he goes off script! Then we knows how he really thinks! 	He can hardly dispute what comes out of his own mouth.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Please tell me the transformation you have seen?	Last time I heard him, he was still calling people names, calling Central Americans " criminals and rapists", still refusing to listen to his own experts, still refusing to quote accurate statistics, etc..
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Please tell where you get most of your news sources from?	Including your tweets?
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson There are lots of independent newspapers who are impartial or mostly impartial. They can be found if you want to look for them. 	I DO know that FOX is definitely NOT one  of them. It is considered to be extremely biased, along with CNN.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2. He has taken away safety measures for workers.	3. He has put a hold on 100 thousands of Federal workers.	4. He is dismantling Medicare for those who need it, etc.		Please tell me how he is helping the workers?
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Please tell me how Trump is giving a "hand up"	Please don't say tax cuts because those gave the rich billions and the working class only a few pennies.	Don't say tarrifs because it has really hurt manufacturing and farmers.	Trump has weakened unions, taken away safety measures...
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Again, I haven't heard about delaying a "spontaneous" delivery, and never deliberately at Risk to the mother.	If it's an abortion, they would wait till the medication works BEFORE they INDUCE the labor. That just makes sense to me but I haven't worked with those abortions.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Crime is mostly caused by poverty, racism and big differences between the rich and the poor.	Of course there is mental illness, drug addiction and corruption, but most is caused by poverty.	Eliminating that helps reduce crime.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Absolutely nothing. But asking for asylum IS legal! 	No matter how they get here.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Actually you can research his quotes and find out yourself.	Yes there are criminals that come in. Every country has their share of criminals. In fact, America's rate, per capita, for sexual and murder criminals is signif greater than theirs. But we expect theirs to be perfect?
@DarwynRowland @l_jxson @TeaBoots I do a ton of research. I dont believe hardly anything I read UNLESS I research it for facts on a neutral or sl biased site. Unless I see it in its entirety myself, I take it with a grain of salt.	If 90% of the news is "fake news" to you, did you ever think you could be wrong?
@DarwynRowland @l_jxson @TeaBoots Are you really serious about these conspiracy theories? Really?	It's paranoia and complete propaganda.
@DarwynRowland @l_jxson @TeaBoots Mexico is NOT deemed a "safe country" by international standards...so they can claim it in America.
@DarwynRowland @l_jxson @TeaBoots America signed the INTERNATIONAL Treaty known as the Refugee Convention for asylum in 1951. That treaty indicates what America's responsibilities regarding  asylum are.	ONLY an IMMIGRATION JUDGE can determine accurately whether they fit the criteria if they claim asylum.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson The media did report it...It was easy to find.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2..is the same as saying ALL RIGHT's are WHITE SUPREMACISTS!	Do you see the danger here? The twisting of information to use it for political gain? To incite hatred?	Although both parties do it, I see the Right, in their language, their name calling, their anger, more prevalent
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson The incident that you referred to was in August 2017 at Berkely by an Extremist leftist group called ANTIFA.	They say they are against racism. This incident and group was criticized strongly by ALLPARTIES including the DEMOCRATS! 	But labelling this as Democrats doing violence...
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson This one was by a White Supremist! Not a Democrat.	https://t.co/bPMIcbxfWU
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Please open your eyes...blacks are stopped just because they are black. Spanish are stopped just because they are Spanish. Muslims are stopped because they are Muslims	There is a LOT of racism in America in our police force. Whites mostly still police blacks. This needs to change
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots It has nothing to do with disrespect of the military! That's Trumps words	In FACT, he originally sat out in protest but then started kneeling to show more respect to the military!	It's a silent peaceful protest against the injustices to black people, and the way police treat them
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots I agree it's etiquette. NO problem there...but my point is that TRUMP used it POLITICALLY to divide this nation.	 He is very clever at Branding, at Working a Crowd, at Igniting his Base, about whipping them into a flurry.
@David03593245 @PressSec Yes, it will help a little but not significantly considering the costs.	The thing it will do is make it more dangerous for those who insist on coming across, costing them more money, putting their lives at more risk, allowing them to be exploited more. But they will come.
@David03593245 @PressSec I do leave my door unlocked often...my husband hates it.	I figure if they really want in, they will get in anyway.	My aunt tells the story of never locking her door..she only had an apple pie stolen once and she felt that whoever stole it needed it more than she did! :)

@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2. Once you accept that there is hate, anger and violence on both sides, that one side is no better than the other, that we are ALL AMERICANS, then it's easy.

@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 6. I think there is clearly a reason that he cannot stand up to Putin. For someone who normally has no problem speaking his mind, he has been conspicuously quiet about Putin.	I could go on but I probably have tired you out already...
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 5.I have a hard time with his morality, his history of prostitutes and mistresses, his attitude towards women sexually. I think there is a high degree of probability that he is guilty of tax fraud, of money laundering, off shore accounts, and of some sort of collusion with Russia
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 4. I can't bear Trumps rhetoric...his name calling, his attacking people's character, his attacking companies he doesn't like, his attacking the FREE PRESS, which work for us to help discern truth, as long as we understand the biases.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 3. ..We live in a small world now, with fast travel, the internet, international businesses, trading, long range missles, satellites, international monetary system. Being isolationists is impossible now. We are ALL interconnected now.what one does affects another.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2. I disagree totally about Trumps foreign policy. I think he understands very little about foreign affairs...It makes me very nervous that he has cut off most of our alliances. 	I don't agree with NATIONALISM. I think that history has shown it to be very dangerous!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2..GOP used to be the party about caring for people but now, they have become the party of BIG BUSINESS and the rights of the RICH. Dems used to be that, but have changed to become more caring about the working people. 	I also dislike Trumps rhetoric about "US" vs "THEM"...
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I have conservative roots but I have dislike how Central Americans have been villanized because they are poor and want a better life. I think as a Christian, outside of the abortions issue, Democrats line up with my values more, about caring for the less fortunate. The GOP...
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Thanks Leslie
@AmyR29258817 @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2. ..It's OUR RESPONSIBILTY to find out what is real and what isn't. BEFORE we pass it on.	I also try to avoid "emotional" language that stirs up emotions in myself or others. That's feelings, NOT FACT!	That is my goal and I am trying to encourage others to do the same.
@AmyR29258817 @TeaBoots @l_jxson Lies come both ways! They even come from the very top of our nation! We can say "NO" to LIES.	We research the TRUTH ourselves first, with unbiased sources, then we can refuse to retweet, send, repeat anything that is NOT TRUE.	There is a lot of propaganda and lies out there....
@AmyR29258817 @TeaBoots @l_jxson Incite violence? Absolutely not! 	But it goes both ways, on both sides. 	We ALL have a RESPONSIBILTY to say "NO" to hate! 	 "NO to speaking It! 	"NO" to spreading It!	"NO" to encouraging It!	"NO" to hearing It!	We can be respectful of each other despite our different views.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Again..I have never heard of that.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Trump is so "white" and is so accustomed to racism in his life, he doesn't even realize it when he is being one. Or when his words have racial overtones. 	He has a history of racist comments publically going back decades.	Yet he condemns Northam for his "blackface" 35 years ago.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots To start with, he calls Mexicans criminals and "RAPISTS". That's like saying because we have some sexual predators in America, AMERICANS are ALL SEXUAL PREDATORS!	He called for a COMPLETE shutdown of ALL MUSLINS entering the country. So ALL Muslims are TERORISTS?
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2. ...But I chose not to be one. 	There has always been hate, but I chose not to celebrate it. 	I chose not to incite it. 	I chose not to feed it.	If Christians really believed what they say, NOT ONE of them would either!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Having said that, I fully recognize there have been rude incidents in restaurants such as Sarah Saunders incident, that are totally not acceptable for anyone. But it has gone both ways.	The difference is I don't focus on the hate. There are always hateful people both sides....
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson If the incident of people wearing a MAGA hat, being beaten on the head with a pipe and left for dead was true, there would be news about it. It would be a serious and noteworthy crime.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson If you see the whole clip, there is debate that it had to do with him being FIRED, not necessarily ANYTHING to do with the logo on His hat. He clearly stole his hat because the clip shows that but NOTHING about it being a MAGA HAT. People distort clips to use them to incite anger
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots https://t.co/14paO1s4wG should NEVER be used for advertising purposes for ANY purpose. Did you see Trumps advertising campaigns?	3. It should NEVER be held flat or horizontal. Sports events do this regularly.	Yet Trump chose to pick on those kneeling peacefully. They were spit on
@AwesomeGodMAGA @l_jxson @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Trump made it a sign of disrespect when he interfered, twisting it and mading a deliberate big deal about it. Before that, kneeling was not a sign of disrespect. 	It DOESN'T say in the flag code that one has to stand or can't kneel. It does say that you should not WEAR a flag....
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots https://t.co/1jouOuJbwZ
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots Leslie, can you send me that clip again as I can't find it. Although I listened to most of it twice at the time, I will relisten again.	Thanks
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson This was in response to your " freaking flying purple people eaters".	Your next tweet was more subdued and less emotional which I appreciate.
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson I said legally. Requesting asylum IS legal. 	10 to 20,000 people in a country of 350 million is NOT much. And that is NOT all from the southern border but at least half of those are from OVERSTAYED visits from elsewhere.
@David03593245 @PressSec You are right..we only have estimates based on history of drugs coming across. But Again, a wall, no matter how sophisticated, will not stop a determined, organized CARTEL or Gang from getting drugs through.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Would you like it if I condemned you for all the bad GOP did?	That's exactly what you are doing to me. I am a DEM and I don't agree with abortion at all. But you would condemn me for it.	See how your preconceived ideas about people are wrong?	I am also a Christian. 	We have guns
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson https://t.co/RRvyiGDaaY 28 weeks, another u/s was done. The baby had NO kidneys, among other things...so tearfully she agreed to induce the babe (some would say abort) which is the normal method. The babe just lived minutes. She cuddled till it died.  This is just one example.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 3.For instance my sister found out at 18 weeks she had a babe with many severe abnormalities, likely not comparable with life. Because she didn't agree with abortion, she keep carrying the pregnancy. But she cried herself to sleep for 10 weeks, couldnt focus on anything....
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2. But the Legislation would be there to make that possible.	The issue is almost ALL DEMOCRATS don't agree either with the possibility of a very late term abortion	They want the law to be there to protect mom's who discover severe abnormalities late and want to terminate the preg
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Anything to save a mothers life is exactly that..to save her life. If it's an intended abortion, say for mental health reasons, it wouldn't be to save her life, as that's not life threatening. But I understand that it's extremely rare, if ever been done at all....
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots Let's hope that we can see some more bipartisan bills passed	 I'm afraid this "National Emergency" won't make it any easier. They feel Trump chose "winning for the wall" over Congressional support and the Constitution.
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots Trump has known for years that there was a severe shortage of Immigration Judges. And that the average wait for holding them was over 700 days with many being longer. But it's not been a priority till the Dems put pressure on him.	This last passed bill included 50 more judges!
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots A wilful abortion is different than a delivery to save a mothers life Having said that, most later abortions, done by induction, for a severe abnormality non viable babe would be included in those numbers and it is a tearful heartbreaking event for ALL! 	I have attended too many!
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Only 1.3% of abortions are over 20 weeks and ONLY APPROX 1% of those are over 24 weeks, which is the legal limit in some states. 	Of that, the majority are for severe fetal abnormalities. Only 7 states allow abortion with no limits...those are where those later abortions occur.
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots As I was saying to deplorable..., a C/S or an Induction is just a METHOD of delivery, whether it be for a mother at risk, a baby at risk, a deceased babe over 20 weeks or an abortion over 20 weeks.	It didn't make sense what she was trying to say. What you are describing helps!
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots It depends on the health issue...if she has HELP syndrome that's not stable or a placenta abruption or a placenta previa, then c/s is imperative. But if it's not a severe preeclampsia, and an epidural is available and effective, they could give a trial labor.
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots I said it was a "racist view"..(but the word should have been "descriminate" or "predjudiced" view, rather than racist, as racist means race"), when one attributes a whole group of people ( over half of a nation) to have the same extremist views as three flag burners.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Whose not listening?	Whose not tolerating it?	We don't tolerate hate speech and racism but then nobody should.	It's propaganda to stir people up and that's all!	We ALL have the right to free speech!	I for one would not take that away...it's one of our founding values!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Again, induction is the METHOD of delivery for all births after 20 weeks, that don't start on their own, whether inducing for the mothers sake, a live or a dead fetus or an abortion.	Please remember that I stated twice that I don't support abortion.	But you info is all messed up!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Yes, we've agreed on your statement several times.	But what's the point?
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson This is all utter nonsense. 	I am not sure what propaganda you are reading but it doesn't make one bit of sense.	Again, never heard of it in 42 years of nursing!
@l_jxson @donnah2244 @TeaBoots Who said it was? I said "so many" and that is true. Out of hundreds of tweets, 95% that I receive are full of anger, name calling, rudeness and swearing. That has been my own personal experience. I also see it from Trump, Trump Jr, and numerous GOP senators and Represenatives
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Who said it was?
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Induction is the METHOD. No one had to fight for it.	Again, you are not making your point clear..
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Did I say it was one sided?	No.	But I have received a TON of it on a daily basis from the Right...most of which I block.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I have NO idea where you are coming from. 	I, in my whole career, have NEVER heard what you are talking about.	Please explain...	It's not making any sense to me at all.	What is "delaying the pregnancy to abort"?	Unheard of...
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots It's NOT our flag that makes us patriotic. 	It is a symbol ONLY. 	It's our hearts and  common values that make us Americans, like those in the first Ammendment	That's why it is SO frustrating when the Right "patriots" claim they are the only true ones, but go on dividing America!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson As we have already said, yes. 	Whats your point??
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Trumps propaganda. Not the peoples.
@l_jxson @AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots Kneeling is NOT disrespectful.	If you don't stand when you pray to God, do I call you disrespectful?	No	This whole thing was Trump's Politics and stirring up anger. That's all. If he hadn't interferred, it would have blown over. But HE made a huge deal, using it to anger his base
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Seattle and Portland were 2 of the 3 incidents I referred to...one each, not "regularly". 	What other episodes of "disrespecting the flag" are you talking about?
@l_jxson @Audragirl01 @TeaBoots Even if he was talking about graffiti or breaking a window, which I don't agree at all, surely that is NOT worthy enough to tell those people to "leave America"!	Really?
@l_jxson @Audragirl01 @TeaBoots Destroying property is never acceptable.  But one side doesnt hold that " honor" exclusively and to say so is wrong and divisive.	Threats and intimidation are also not acceptable!	Yet Trump openly pushes the "violence" that will happen if he loses power!
@TrumpMovement2 @TeaBoots @l_jxson Please tell me "principles" the left is tearing apart?	I want to make sure we understand each other.	I think the First Amendment makes it quite clear.	By the way, we were not the first people's here...we all are immigrants from somewhere.
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots That tweet was a misunderstanding and I apologized but in the next tweets he made himself clear about the " unwashed masses"!
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots Asylum is LEGAL means...acvording to the law, if their feet are on American soil, they can apply and are deserving of their due process by the proper Immigration Judges!
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots But, according to the LAW, they have a right to due process for their claims, NOT by a border patrol who does not understand the intricate details of Immigration Law but by an IMMIGRATION JUDGE!	They are NOT receiving that due process! 	Trump doesn't care.
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots 2. ...the people who apply for asylum have the right, according to the LAW, no matter how they come in, to recieve their due process according to that LAW.
@l_jxson @DarwynRowland @TeaBoots Leslie, did you read his tweets?	"Hordes of unwashed masses" with their "Backward cultures"?	Apparently you don't think that's racism! I am shocked.	Who has EVER said to disrespect the law! Not me. I am all for law abiding citizens. 	That's exactly why people who apply for asylum
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson That's the point...he is telling anyone who doesnt think like him, probably over 50% of the population to get out of America!	You think that's right?	That's admirable? That's helpful?	That's inspiring?	There is no hope!
@l_jxson @TrumpMovement2 @TeaBoots Trump and the GOP are deliberatly puting out propaganda, saying that if Trump loses, their will be VIOLENCE! Some GOP are posting ads with bloody faces full of violence stirring upthe GOP up to hate, anger and violence.	If you for a moment think that link was uplifting.....
@l_jxson @TrumpMovement2 @TeaBoots Leslie...are you kidding me? Charlotteville never happened? The Tea Party Protests? The violence against Muslims. The violent rhetoric? Again I say Really?	Dems take to the street to protest as is their constitutional right. Are there a few extremists? No different that the Right
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson Sorry Darwyn..You are so full of anger and hate and as so, are unable to reason, that I am no longer interested in communicating with you.	Goodbye.
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson Darwyn, they are applying for asylum. How many generations back was your family "not American Citizens"?	And if you think a wall will stop them, you will be disheartened!	Under, Over! Haven't you seen in Europe where they come by boat?
@l_jxson @TrumpMovement2 @TeaBoots He mentioned that only briefly.	The rest was divisive speech, saying if you don't think like "me", get out of America.	I was surprised you retweeted it.
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2...is NOT division. It is political debate about different views, WITHOUT anger and hate language.	We are ALL AMERICANS. No one needs to divide us unless you let them.	Research your facts and info please. Send RELIABLE sources to back your statements up.	Don't pass propaganda!
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson Darwin, you are filling your head with propaganda!	Where did "evil straight white men" come from. I didn't say it. No one else said it on this feed, except you.	Are there a few extreme left out there? Of course, just like there are extreme right out there.	But my purpose....
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson You are "NOT intolerant"?	You don't care about race?		Didnt you just say "poor unwashed masses" and "backward cultures"?		I think you need to recheck how racist those comments sound!		Your words are NOT matching your apparent thought process.
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson 2. ...The world has become much "smaller" now. Things cannot go back the way they were. If so, the Indiginous People would kick us "intruders" ALL out!	People change. The world changes. To say you have some rights because you were here "second" is ridiculous. Adapt to the change!
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson Forgive me. I did read it wrong and misquote. My apologies.	The ruling class and middle clases were white. There were many indigenous First People here as well as many, many blacks. 	But with fast travel, the internet, international business, the world has got much "smaller"....
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I didnt make the "prejudiced" statement. You did. So why are you turning it all around?	If you spread hate, you will receive hate.	If you spread acceptance, even without understanding, you will receive acceptance, almost ALL the time.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson You ned to send some RELIABLE statistics and articles to defend what you are saying. Those are pretty serious claims you are making. It sounds mostly propaganda from Conspiracy Theorists to me.	If it is true, it should be easy to find them.	If there is none, then it is not likely
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I am not sure of the point you are trying to make. What is the question?	Yes, life threatening situations for the mother or babe are delivered as soon as can be done if unable to stabilize them.	But the point?
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I was responding to your previous comment, which was the latest.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson "Third trimester" is the correct term for a fetus over 24 weeks. A babe is considered "term" over 36 weeks although most go till 40 weeks or later.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Late term usually means over 20 wks or 24 weeks depending on the state. 24 weeks is the beginning of the third trimester.	Again I don't support abortion, which I've said already. I just don't like it when information and stats are quoted by people who don't understand the issue.
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson Actually, it's not millions and millions, year..it's tens of thousands. That a big difference.	Immigration Lawyers say that all asylum claims should have a right to due process, not by some border agent that doesn't understand the intricacies of immigration law but by a lawyer!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Can you explain what you mean by that?	I have NEVER heard of that!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson And that's exactly what happens, either by induction or a c/s depending on the urgency., after 20 weeks. 	But the "right" calls that a "late term abortion". 	That child won't be viable till at least 24 weeks or even a week or two after that.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Clearly you have no idea how many life threatening occasions happen to a mother after 24 weeks. Have you heard of eclampsia, for one?
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson There is only a total of 3 incidents that I could find, since 2016, where a flag has been burned.	That's approx one year. 	Not quite "regularly". 	I think you are reading too much PROPAGANDA. 	Although I don't agree with it, it is seen as a symbol that America has lost its way!
@DarwynRowland @TeaBoots @l_jxson Hi Darwyn. You are right about not letting everyone stay. 	But EVERYONE has a right to apply either for immigration or asylum. 	If asylum, they only need to plant their feet on American soil to be able to apply. They, then according to law, have a right to their due process.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson "are"
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Read the text...I said that believing that ALL people who don't support Trump are extreme leftists who burn the flag is racist. I should have used the word "prejudice"! My apologies. You ate attributing one trait to a whole group of people!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson You're ignorance about "late term abortion", which is NOT a true medical term, is showing.	But if it helps to make feel more righteous than others, please keep repeating that propaganda.	If you want a serious discussion about the real TRUTH, let me know...
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I am a labor and delivery nurse and NICU nurse for 42 years...if you want to debate and find out who is telling the truth, I know and UNDERSTAND it very well. You may be ashamed of your comments.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson You have this narrowly defined preconception that anyone who doesn't like Trump is a left wing extremist that burns the flag. that unless we are full of anger, we are not Patriots! 	That's your problem, not mine! 	But it is not Truthful at all. In fact, it's a very racist view.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I have guns. I support ALL AMENDMENTS. But some details are up for debate and have been debated for a hundred years	I don't burn the flag...But because ONE did, we all did? Seriously?	I don't agree with abortion. But I hate it when people distort and use it for political purposes
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Then why am I talking to you then?	I have said that I enjoy hearing different opinions	You assumed that we don't want to hear it. Propaganda tells you we dont want to listen and for some extremists that may be true. But you will find most when treated respectfully, are respectful
@David03593245 @PressSec But the numbers are going down..less than ever before. That's why although it may be a crisis, it's NOT an emergency!	 Despite that almost everyone agrees we need better border security. But where and how is what's debatable.

@Audragirl01 @TeaBoots @l_jxson Trudy...telling over 50% of the population to leave IS NOT uniting!	We are ALL AMERICANS and proud of it. 	We CAN have different political opinions and values.	When all learn to accept that, we will be a UNITED AMERICA!
@Audragirl01 @TeaBoots @l_jxson Uniting? For who? Right Wing America?	Or America as a whole?	Please rethink this...	Thanks for your polite comment without name calling. 	Always appreciate polite different opinions.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Remember:	ALL MEN are created EQUAL. 	That we have Freedom of RELIGION, (not just Christianity, although it's mine.)	Freedom of SPEECH and the PRESS!	Freedom to PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE!	Perhaps you need to reread the FIRST AMMENDMENT instead of the 2nd!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I retract the thanks for NOT using name calling. You've regressed.
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson WHO does not like America?	WHO does not like our Constitutional Rebublic?	Where do you get these ideas?	We also LOVE our country! We love and value our Constitution!	We respect the office of presidency, just not the man. He has to deserve it for me.
@donnah2244 @TeaBoots @l_jxson Donna...I don't get why you and so many GOP,  feel the need to insult other people who have a different political opinion than yours. We are ALL AMERICANS! We are a multicultural society!	But you chose angry, divisive language. Why? Does it make you feel better?
@donnah2244 @TeaBoots @l_jxson ALL MEN are created EQUAL. 	We have Freedom of RELIGION, (not just Christianity, although it's mine.)	Freedom of SPEECH and the PRESS	Freedom to PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE	Perhaps you and your friend need to read the FIRST AMMENDMENT instead of the 2nd!
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson I apreciate you aswering politely instead of angry name calling. Thank you.	Untill people can accept that WE are ALL AMERICANS, no matter how we think politically, our country will be divided and eventually fall. (like other great empires have...from the inside out)
@AwesomeGodMAGA @ThreeWyverns @TeaBoots @l_jxson Where in the constitution does it say you must stand to respect the flag? We pray on our knees to God who is far greater. 	Who doesn't want to say the pledge?	You ASSUME that unless one is a right wing "patriot", one isn't one and doesn't love this country?	You are VERY WRONG!

@JackSpa78266706 @Newsweek Time will tell.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Reproduce? Punishable by death?	David I think you have been reading some propaganda. Be careful what you read.	They were not allowed to build more HOUSES in the disputed West bank area, an area apparently belonging to the Palestinians.	This has been disputed since the 1967 war.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Actually there were 8 other countries but smaller ones. The problem is that it's a hotspot and by moving the embassies to Jerusulem made the whole area more unstable!!	 That's why other countries either refrained from voting or voted against it.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi In the article, it also said we were withholding aid recently and that UNICEF was frustrated by it.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi No military background...not since my grandfather.
@JackSpa78266706 @Newsweek I have not suggested that we interfere. Not once. 	I have said that what happens there can easily affect us here. 	It's a small world with international travel, international businesses, internet, satellites, long range missiles!
@JackSpa78266706 @Newsweek But ours was a civil war, within our own country. Many countries have civil wars. But that's different than swallowing up other independent countries.	Again I don't fully understand the situation there but it makes me nervous as I am sure it makes many of the other countries near
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi I think your figures are off. Until just recently, we have not sent any humanitarian aid since 2009, according to this article..		https://t.co/t1na5wIzmN
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi God will bless you for that.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Glad to hear.
@JackSpa78266706 @Newsweek Do you know how far Russia is from America...mere miles across the strait.	If Rusia is starting to pressure other smaller countries to join with them, where will they stop?	Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia, Poland??
@JackSpa78266706 @Newsweek No I am not suggesting war. Just the necessity of Russia absorbing it after the people fought so hard for independence?
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Military funds though?	Federal funding?
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi I thought N Korea has been under American sanctions for decades. I thought Russia and China were their main lifeline.	I am not aware of USA helping.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi That's wonderful to hear. All Federally funded? Done by the military?	I know there are huge private organizations that are instrumental.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Awesome...did you get much chance to get off the base and do some tourism?
@StormIsUponUs @JackSpa78266706 Joe, this is because the Senate Investigation is NOT over. They are still interviewing.	R Burr gave his own opinion only...not necessarily the opinion of the committee. It will be months before there is a report.	The MUELLER INVESTIGATION is still ongoing.	So basically, fake news
@JackSpa78266706 @Newsweek Peacefully from one dictator to another! What about the people? They don't have a choice.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Is your home perfect? Are your relationships perfect?	Life will never be perfect. Does hat stop you from helping others, giving tithe or helping the poor?	I think not, at least I hope not, especially considering your faith and the Commands we have been given.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Overstretched compared to what?	An average home here is a palace elsewhere. We throw out 1/3 of the food we grow. We are wasteful, take for granted what we have. I don't mean we need to feed the world but we have a responsibilty to do what we can, where we can.
@JackSpa78266706 @Newsweek Belarus only won independence from Rusia in 1991. Although I don't profess to understand the relationship well, the thought that Russia is expanding its territory again, swallowing up a small country, is frightening with its past history.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi When you see the poverty, yet the kindness of others despite their poverty, it is humbling. But this is why I think it is selfish to lay claim ourselves to the blessings we have here in America, when most of the world has so little.	God said to go out to the world, not hold it in
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Pleasure. I love history, experiencing different cultures, architecture and nature. I also am passionate about photography. My husband enjoys it but mostly on our own continent.	I find it opens your mind to others. It also makes you grateful for what we have here.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi I agree.
@David03593245 @InGreensboro @gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning They are both considered extremely biased. You get all the emotional baggage with both. I listen to PBS for facts. It is very slightly left but considered very accurate in its factual recording. I get tweets from both extremes so I get some of the "feelings" from both sides.

There has to be some fairly objective sites to base it on. It is shocking how emotional the language can be and how some can distort the facts beyond truth.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi It was a difficult time for America and the whole world. Also a very difficult to take on the presidency.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Yes, we live in an Amazing small world. I didn't travel the whole time but often. I have been to China, S Korea, Morrocco, Istanbul, most Europen countries, as well at all states except for two and all Canadian provinces many times.	As a result I have a more world view than some.

@catspadog Interesting article. Thanks for sending it. 	I hope you read it all the way through. Its encouraging.	Although first generation immigrants use more welfare, second generation use less as they become educated and are able to get better jobs. In fact, they are harder workers!
@catspadog Thanks for the article.
@gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 Huff post is moderately to strongly left but factually correct.
@gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 Fyi John...here is the media bias on "FAIR"	This is by an international media company with reputable standards.	Please note their assessment...	It is always good to know if you are reading real facts.		https://t.co/tyVurMXpLh
@catspadog @gonzo_555 @america_winning @David03593245 Clearly your heart is hardened and you have little or no interest in helping mankind.	The birth lottery was fortunate to you, allowing you to be born in one of the richest countries in the world.	It could've easily been otherwise.	Good day. God bless!
@catspadog @gonzo_555 @america_winning @David03593245 Just some info on "FAIR".	This is an international media bias site..	You might want to know this...		https://t.co/tyVurMXpLh
@BillWilliamsJr3 @trileyjr33 @seanhannity That's always an easy answer, isn't it.	Just call someone a name...
@catspadog 2. By assisting Mexico with eliminating corruption and helping with employment, Mexicans are now happier to stay in their own countries. Apparently very few illegals come from there now. The answer is to eliminate poverty and fear and lack of education.	A Wall won't help that.
@catspadog Thanks for the article. I have read similar. There definitely is a cost, especially to the judicial and DHS system. But as long as there is a big difference between rich countries and poor, they will come.	Our only answer is to help those countries like we helped Mexico...
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Yes..already very personal.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Yes...that's a tough one. 	I dont know how much the recession played into the decision. Or if he campaigned on that. 	To be honest I didn't follow politics closely till this last year so I am somewhat ignorant of the past. 	I traveled a lot around the world those last few years.
@David03593245 @gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning Can you find info on that for me?	I'd appreciate that.
@David03593245 @gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning It does vary according to state. And there is always some percentage of fraud.
@catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 Rudeness...	Happy to debate and share but please avoid the swearing!
@gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 But I believe that it is never wrong to give infants a good start to life. I don't begrudge the infants and children at all. We can give a child a better opportunity for life by giving them education. I fully support that. We are the richest nation on each. We can help children.
@gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 I agree Huff isn't an unbiased source. But the info basically agree. Illegal women get maternity care, infant supplements and care, emergency visits only with no follow up. The children get schooling with some free lunches. That's very little..meets the needs infants and children
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi 2. ...that doesn't mean we need to support bad leadership. I think we need to pray for them, that God will give them wisdom and clarity of thinking, etc. And to be careful what and how we talk, but that would be all	Can I ask you if you supported Obama in this same spiritual way?
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi David I understand and appreciate what you say, and I agree that God can use whoever he chooses to use. But I believe, based on the Old Testament, that God often uses a bad leader to punish a nation. So although one needs to understand that God is in control of everything....
@gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 This article, although NOT  legal document, makes it easier to understand about what they do receive. I understand some states vary.		https://t.co/aQtI4PRVY2
@gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 I understand you were disagreeing with me. I just get tired of rudeness, there is so much of It, and I am trying to have civil discourse without it. 	I am glad to have you join. 	I appreciate differing opinions.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi 3.And on top of That, with the exception of about one or two things, I disagree totally with his policies. I think he does not understand foreign policy AT ALL. 	I still believe he thinks mostly of himself and his own path, NOT whats good for America. That concerns me greatly.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi 2. Would you spiritually support a "young child" over a "mature adult" as your leader? No of course not.	One has to grow. 	This is all hypothetical because we have NO idea! I have seen little or NO change in his rhetoric, his name calling, his not telling the truth, his swearing.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi 1As God forgives us, we have a obligation to forgive others. Who are we NOT to forgive?	But a new start doesn't mean no consequences for past actions. It doesn't mean it's an easy path...the learning curb is steep.	IF he is repentant and changes, there is STILL a lot of growth...
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi You are right. That's why we need spiritual discernment.
@catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 Rudeness? Insults?	Do you debate or just name call?
@gonzo_555 @catspadog @america_winning @David03593245 Join the conversation if you have worthy debate. Name calling, swearing, and rude comments aren't appreciated on this feed.
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi Thanks Ben. I appreciate that. 	It goes both ways. 	So thank you too.	There is way too much anger in America right now and it will destroy us from the inside out!
@JohndogDoe @BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi 4. That doesn't mean every one case is NOT SAD. It IS sad!  And if no "bad guys" were here, that wouldn't happen. 	But how can we expect any other race to have NO crime, when our OWN rates of crime are significantly more than theirs. 	That's hypocrisy to me.
@JohndogDoe @BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi ...as we saw in Europe with the Gypsies or the Jews. That same attitude is developing here. WE want  to base our policies on facts, NOT FEAR. Trump loves to spends hours taking about FEAR, the detailed raping, the killings, the drugs, the gangs. Yet statistics show they have less
@JohndogDoe @BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi That's why the Dems get their back up about it all. Not because we want illegal immigrants. Because we want them treated humanly and not blamed for all America's ills. We want factual information, not emotional disinformation. There is great danger in villanizing them ....
@JohndogDoe @BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi You are right...thousands do. BUT they are NOT all from illegal immigrants as others would have you believe. For some reason, Trump encourages everyone to "blame the immigrants" for ALL the illegal activities in America. Their portion of that, is far less per capita than ours.
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi I enjoy hearing both sides and I try to be respectful and try to avoid name calling. We all want the best for America! We just have different viewpoints on how to get there.	I appreciate your considerate debate too.
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi I don't have a problem with guns. We have several. But I do believe in tighter control. I think that would help a lot. David and I have discussed this I think..a 3 day wait while history is checked at least, a licence, guns locked up separately, ammo locked up separately.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Yet they honestly don't care if central Americans die of thirst in the desert as they wander around for days. Or get murdered. Or die of starvation!	That's the hypocrisy I cannot stand!	If you value life, you value ALL LIFE! Not just the ones you choose to value.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi But this is the problem...It is exactly what they are condemning Norham for and on ALL the Dems!	There is NO attempt to understand.	It's a lot of just plain hysteria!	They don't believe you can be a DEMOCRAT and not support abortions either. To them that's impossible.
@l_jxson @MikeBastasch @DailyCaller We will chose to disagree again.	A habit lately! :)
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi It means that on your own, without mechanical assistance and or multiple surgeries, that you would not live.  That your organs cannot sustain life on their own. 	It doesn't mean help with feeding or personal care, which are normal. It is unable to sustain LIFE itself.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi But these are the circumstances that many right wing are jumping all over the Dems for..	This is what Northam was trying to explain. He's a Pediatrician, vowed to SAVE the lives of children. But they just destroyed him without understanding anything!
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi I would love to know that I am wrong. 	It would be the best thing for America!	But when I look at the corrupt people he has surrounded himself with, I do pause to wonder if possible	You are equally just to confront me. 	I am worried that the public will not be shown the evidence
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi You know, I sometimes wonder if that might be possible. Unfortunately, he has a lot to learn and every word and action is in the public eye and judged accordingly.	But one way or another, he is still accountable for his past actions, his rhetoric today and there are consequences.
@l_jxson @MikeBastasch @DailyCaller I think that, despite it being not planned, students can learn a lot from their ability to exercise their right to free speech and even more so, the power of many voices together. 	It also is a great lesson on Politics and Government. 	It will be a lesson that they will remember!
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi There is a good article on "Christianity and Politics" by John Macarthur, a well respected Christian scholar.	It's slightly off on a tangent but it's a worth while reading. It's in 4 parts. I'll send you the first one...		https://t.co/XWQ9U1RPBU
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi David, I have done that too. Perhaps not as much as one could but I have.	I also think God gave us intelligence to see clearly and UNDERSTAND. To not let ourselves be decieved. 	To look for evidence of the "Fruit of the Spirit".
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Based on Trump past history with prostitutes and mistresses, its quite likely that the rumors are true and he has paid for numerous abortions.	I feel his life does not match up with his words. 	There is little evident "Fruit of the Spirit" to indicate otherwise.	God is his judge.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi I am not here to challenge your relationship with God. 	But being a Christian does NOT mean that we have an obligation to support Trump, just because he said he will support a pro life stance.	I believe he knows "which side his bread is buttered" and is using Christians.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi It's not as clear cut as one would think...it has Benn debated, changed slightly and changed again.	Here's an interesting article on the history of the second ammendment.		https://t.co/r99n6H3m2l
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi ..not compatible with life. She held it while he gasped his last breathe minutes after birth. 	Do you have the right to say what she did is wrong?	She is a firm Believer but she feels she can stand before God with a clear conscience!	Do you have any right to question that?
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi I CANNOT carry this baby for another 12 weeks! She was a wreck..she couldn't work. She couldn't sleep. She finally decided at 28 weeks she would induce the birth, which is usually what happens to a "late abortion". The baby was born with no kidneys and other abnormalities. ...
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi David, my sister found out at 18 weeks that her baby had numerous abnormalities not compatible with life. Because she did not believe in abortion, she could not decide to "abort" this baby before the 20 mark. She cried about it every day for 10 WEEKS, before she finally said...
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi Lol!
@l_jxson @MikeBastasch @DailyCaller Did you ever take the kids on a school trip?	Same thing.		In the 70s, I attended a protest. Amazingly enough I still went on to post secondary education.
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi That's your choice...EVERY time you climb into a vehicle, you are choosing to take a risk. But it's clearly your choice as an adult. Unless you are kidnapped! :(
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi But that's intereferring with life! 	If God created a life that would die without MANY serious, numerous interventions, what right do we have to intervene if the family, who will be their caregivers for ever, chose not too	By the way, cleft palette unfixed is compatable with life
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi So you think you are able to judge all those decisions?	That some are right?	That some are wrong?	Unless you are standing at the side of that person, involved with their care or their family, you have no right!	 God is our witness of our compassion and loving care!
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi One can argue that every time we resuscitate a person, no matter what the age, that is playing God!	They died...Then we brought them back to life!	Do you not support resuscitation?	Or surgery?	Or antibiotics?	All life saving measures done EVERY DAY in hospitals.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Ethical questions are asked and decided by families EVERY DAY in hospitals	When do you take a patient off life support?	Do you resuscitate an elderly person with cancer?	Do you resuscitate a baby that has only 1/4 of his brain?	How many times do you resuscitate a 24 week infant?
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi They may not charge him while he is POTUS, but he will be charged the moment he is not. And he will have to account for that to America and before God. He will also have to pay the consequences for any crime. 	I think that's why he is so desperate to stay in power.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi Then that's between you and God.	I cannot support a man who I believe is morally corrupt and a selfish narcissistic leader.	Time will tell but don't be surprised if, in addition to his life of prostitutes, he is found to be guilty of tax invasion, fraud, conspiracy, and perjury.
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi I respect the position of POTUS but cannot respect the man!	He needs to be deserving of that.	We are told to give the tax due to "Caesar", to obey the laws of the land but we are never asked to support him! Would you have supported Stalin a leader? (no comparison intended).
@David03593245 @BenJackd1 @SpeakerPelosi David...I do NOT agree God chose or placed Trump to be present!  He ALLOWED it to happen, as He has many other leaders before, good or bad! Sometimes as punishment. He allows us to live out those consequences of those choices. 	Morally I cannot support Trump.
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi The PUBLIC does NOT understand these issues at all. They have gone berserk over this whole issue, with little or no understanding!	I don't agree with late abortions just because a woman wants it done, BUT there are MANY other reasons why it is done and should be allowed to happen
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi I have spent my life trying to save little ones all the way back to 23 weeks of age. NO ONE takes these little lives lightly at all! But there are circumstances, where these little ones lives are NOT compatible with life, that they are allowed to pass away, on their OWN.
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi ONLY 1% of the 1.3% of late abortions are done close to term. As a nurse who has worked in the delivery room 40 years, I fully understand the circumstances in which these occur. I have been there with parents crying while cuddling their little one as they took their last breath.
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi Actually it Does!
@l_jxson @MikeBastasch @DailyCaller Personally I think they may learn more about social issues, enviroment issues, sociology, their rights, relationships, etc. on this one day than they could EVER learn at school on any given day.	It's only ONE day for goodness sakes, not a week or a month!
@David03593245 @america_winning There was a lot of racism against him.	His rhetoric and tweets were not rude and divisive. He had a far better understanding of politics in general, especially foreign policy! 	He was much more articulate.	No one ever agrees with all ones policies but we chose the best candidate.
@David03593245 @america_winning Yes but we need to make that easier and faster!
@David03593245 @america_winning Yes..I remember..that's why I said we have been there. But you weren't sure they were illegals, just immigrants?	I think we all would do the same thing if we were in their shoes. I appreciate that.
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi You can break it down how ever you like, but that doesn't change the fact that all 32,000 were killed by a GUN! 	If those guns hadn't been so readily available, many, if not most, would be saved!	Stop making up excuses!
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump What about the almost 40,000 killed in America by guns a year? 	That's a NATIONAL EMERGENCY!	That's 100 TIMES MORE than the approx 400 that are killed a year by illigal immigrants! 	That's not to say that every loss is not sad, for they all are. 	But it is NOT an EMERGENCY!
@BenJackd1 @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi GUNS kill 200 TIMES more a YEAR than illegal immigrants! 	200 times MORE!	Yet Trump doesn't care about those "angel moms".	He has done NOTHING to prevent these deaths!	That should be the FIRST MATIONAL EMERGENCY!!
@PressSec @David03593245 This is NO NATIONAL EMERGENCY!	There are NO statistics to indicate it at all. 	This is Trump rhetoric and its a political emergency for him only so he can look strong!

@David03593245 @america_winning Not everyone is a BILLIONAIRE, in fact some house representatives are from blue collar families.	Trump owes America his salary as he has used public bank money to go BANKRUPT 6 TIMES, each time for hundreds of millions of dollars. All so HE can become RICH.	So is it his money?
@David03593245 @america_winning I would far rather pay a POTUS his $350 thousand year salary and have a POTUS that I agree with his  policies, than NOT pay one that divides America, creates more gaps between the rich and the poor, puts tariffs on, that destroys all of our nation's allies, and is a PUTIN puppet!
@David03593245 @america_winning Many many donated their salaries during the Trump Shutdown.
@David03593245 @america_winning Warren Buffet and Bill Gates not just give their salary but 90% of ALL their money away to worthy causes!	And they don't get kickbacks like housing, cars, jets, vacation, clothes, parties, etc.	They are the top 2 American philanthropists!!
@David03593245 @america_winning I think it's admirable that he donates his $350,000 salary to worthy charities! 	Dont forget he also gets perks worth FAR MORE than that...housing, no payments, travel, limos, jets to use, etc. 	It's his policies I don't agree with!	Nor his rhetoric!	Nor his moral history!
@David03593245 @america_winning Interesting you would go to Mexico but you don't want them here.
@David03593245 @america_winning Their business would have a different exemption.	I am talking personal wealth here!	They would have to leave America.	Ang go where? 	To Europe where the taxes are just as high?	But this is foolish talk...Trump would NEVER deny his RICH BUDDIES that pay for his campaigns! SWAMP!
@pattigorges1 @thehill @SecretaryCarson But my point is, what about the tens of thousands of "angel moms" whose children have been killed BY AMERICAN GUNS?	Whose defending them?	Whose giving them a stage?	There are far more of them than the ones Trump is "using"!
@David03593245 @thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump David, I get It! That IS the point!	A WALL is crazy expensive and its totally inadequate on its own. The maintenance costs hundreds of millions every year.	It's useful only in certain critical areas.	SMART TECHNOLGY is 1/10 the cost, cheaper to maintain, and is effective in areas
@David03593245 @america_winning How do you feel about companies like Amazon paint no taxes?	The tax portion is so low, they just write it off!	And we are left paying for Trumps, the Big Spender, extra 2 TRILLION DOLLARS worth if debt!!	Trump has already said he doesn't care about it cause won't be his problem!
@David03593245 @america_winning But if ALL the States have the same policy and they close the loopholes that allow them to take their money Off Shore (which Trump promised to do, ha, ha) or to set it up in offshore Shell Companies, it wouldn't happen!	These people make thier money on the backs of working people
@pattigorges1 @thehill @SecretaryCarson It is heartbreaking. I agre. 	Although I think it's not right to use mothers for a political platform like Trump does, I wish they could have a platform and that people would value the lives they have lost!

@senatemajldr @POTUS Oh yeah. I forhot. In Trumps world, its ALWAYS  someone else's fault!	Certainly not his for not getting it done in the two years when he had a three HOUSES!
@thehill What about all those angel mom's whose children were killed by American GUNS? The tens of thousands!	Do they have a say?	Are they given a platform?	Or does it only count when an illegal immigrant killed their child?

If so, you aborted a fertilized egg or "fetus", albeit a very young one. 	At what point do you say it's ok and not ok?
@l_jxson @NBCNews Trump has a bad reputation for treating his contractors very poorly in his own business!
@l_jxson @NBCNews It was the republicans in this article that were saying the contractors should receive back pay and did not understand why Trump refused it.	It was the Democrat that says they are still working on it to get it passed.	I understand they had to remove it to get Trump to sign today.
@Calverdk1 @adjunctprofessr @David03593245 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You clearly don't understand the significance of a FOREIGN power, an age old ENEMY of the UNITED STATES, who's foremost desire is to see the FALL OF AMERICA, interfere with not JUSTour elections, but in our FORIGN POLICY!

@globalnews @realDonaldTrump He is so ignorant.
@GOP @PressSec This is misinformation!	The Senate Investigation is NOT done and Burr is NOT the official spokesman for it. The MUELLER Probe is NOT DONE. It is more thorough and no one knows the results of it. And the CONGRESS INVESTIGATION is just starting so NOTHING is Decided yet.

Its an unbelievable amount of corruption.
@David03593245 @katriotic @IntelOperator You know, I am much more concerned with RUSSIA interfering with our foreign policies, by manipulating Trump, thereby isolating us from ALL of our friends and allies in NATO etc, than I ever was concerned about Obama's birth certificate!

@GOP During this time in late 1800s, the Robber Barons were relentless in their search for wealth! They exploited workers	Tenements and slums sprung up nationwide. Heating, lighting, sanitation and medical care were poor or nonexistent, and millions died from preventable disease.
@GOP The info in this article is twisted. During the Guilded Age, late 1800's, America looked RICH on the outside, but was CORRUPT underneath, with poor Working Conditions. They worked 10-hour shifts, six days a week. The wages earned were barely enough to support their families!

@luvnmedogzz @RepMarkMeadows Save the beds for the "known criminals", and let the ordinary asylum seekers go with ankle bracelets. It's silly to detain them at 100's of dollars a day for an average of 700 days before they see a judge even.
@zimzimjr @RepMarkMeadows @FAIRImmigration You cannot stop the Asylum seekers! 	They have a right to due process under American law!	Get over your unrational fear. 	The American population has almost twice the violent criminal rate as asylum seekers do! You should worry more about your neighbours!
@RepMarkMeadows Sort out the ones with criminal records, use the beds to detain those criminal ones!	Let the rest be free with an ankle bracelets. It's stupid to warehouse asylum seekers at the costs of hundreds of dollars a day per person. Why treat them like criminals when they are not?
@RepMarkMeadows No, they are trying to make ICE  save beds for the violent criminals Trump talks about and NOT use beds for asylum seekers whose only crime is wanting a better life. Asylum seekers wait an average of 700 days to get before a judge. That's very costly and not right to hold them.

@David03593245 But a wall will not stop that, David. Criminals who get paid millions will always find a way. 	A wall is FALSE security!

@David03593245 @LadyRedWave Good...we are gun owners too but I believe in responsible gun control!
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave David, my husband is in forensic psychiatry.	If a weapon is easily accessible, one can do it in a fit of rage, not premeditated.	But if it's difficult to get it, it has to be preplaned and arranged ahead of time.	Sorry, you are off on that one.
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave No it does NOT. Even third world countries do not have the gun deaths America does.		https://t.co/aGJhx5Jzhm
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave Knives injure but kill only 1/6th of what guns kill every year. That's 30,000 lives a year saved!	Statistics in many many countries show that gun controls work well with much less deaths. 	Very few other means of significant amount of deaths (unless terrorist).
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave Again, much of that has to do with poverty and unemployment.		They have traced at least 60% of Chicago's illegal guns that come from "out of state"... Indiana mostly. Thats those they know about so probably far more. Gun control in ALL STATES would solve many of those problems.
@David03593245 Desperate people who live their lives in fear will KEEP coming.	Till we help solve the problems in their countries.	There are much fewer Mexicans coming because we have helped them with their economy and helped reduce the corruption there.	That's what is really effective.	Plug on
@David03593245 Because you said saving one American life would make it worth while. But what about the thousands of children killed on the other side of the "wall"?	Who will care for them?	Who will keep them safe?	We can't save them all but those who do make the huge effort to come, we can save
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave Unfortunately, with guns, there will always be a criminal element but poverty is part of that problem. If you have policies to eliminate poverty, you will make huge inroads to reduce crime	But Trump doesn't care about the impoverished. He only cares about big business so no hope.
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave By the way, gun control doesn't take away guns from responsible people, it only makes them keep them much safer. 	So it won't prevent all the gun deaths but would probably cut it down by 60 to 80%, if you look at other similar countries statistics.
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave Sorry David, but that is the silliest comment that gun owners say!	If you didn't have access to that gun, would the crime be done? Could you "shoot someone"?	And if the intent was still there, with the use of another weapon, would that person die or just be injured? Usually not.
@David03593245 Again I say, the crime moves elsewhere but still comes in. So it distorts the figures, making it appear better but in reality isn't.
@David03593245 What about the hundreds of thousands of children who die every year in Central America because of corruption, crime and murder?	Or are their lives not important?	Because they aren't white or American?
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave I understand. There is no limit to the value of one life.	But if that we true, we would take ALL the guns away because they kill 36,000 people a year, including MANY, many children! That doesn't include the maimed.	But somehow I doubt you would be quite so empathetic on that one!

@David03593245 It is true...we must root out that evil.
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave Because the statistics show that they have less violent crime than American citizens.	Almost all just want to improve their lives and be safe!
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave You forget that, by American law, they have a RIGHT to claim asylum and have their case receive it's due process before an immigration lawyer.	Hiring hundreds more Immigration Lawyers would help because as I've said, it would either get them to work, paying taxes or deported.
@David03593245 @LadyRedWave Ideally, yes David.	But you are naive to think that a wall will make much of a difference. Perhaps minimally but I think you will be shocked how little the numbers actually change.	So great COSTS for minimal savings.
@APWestRegion This is ridiculous!!!

@l_jxson @realDonaldTrump Apparently they are usually compliant while waiting for immigration court but once they find out they are refused asylum, then 3/10 cut their bracelets off while "waiting for deportation" and disappear.
@l_jxson @realDonaldTrump ....Trump should have hired hundreds of immigration lawyers 2 years ago when he realized the need. But he didn't really care about that. A wall was more important to him	There is an increase average now of 700 days before a case goes to court. This should be a priority!
@l_jxson @realDonaldTrump These people that have ankle bracelets on, often followed the rules...now they have to wait years before their case comes before an immigration lawyer.	That's why it is SO expensive to keep them there..it's the same cost per person as a prisoner probably.	.....

@realDonaldTrump How do we say this so Trump can understand!! 	"NO ONE WANTS OPEN BORDERS INCLUDING THE DEMS".	That is a TRUMP LIE!	They just disagree on the effectiveness of a wall and support technology, more manpower, more immigration judges and a more humane way of treating asylum seekers!

@l_jxson @sherrynron Sad to hear it.

@l_jxson @sherrynron Trump likes to have inexperienced people around him in "acting status" because he can manipulate them and threaten their job security. 	He truly wants to be a dictator like was in his business empire.
@l_jxson @sherrynron They were defintly rude about it but he was refusing to answer their questions. They knew it. That's why they will probably subpoena him and bring him back	He clearly was out of his depth. I think Trump chose him because he could manipulate him, not because he was truly qualified
@l_jxson @sherrynron They wanted yes or no answers. That what lawyers want. They didn't want him rambling on about something indirectly related, wasting their time.

@l_jxson @sherrynron Leslie, although I didnt see the morning, I saw the afternoon. I think they were all very mindful of their time limit of 5 minutes which goes by really fast. It seems rude but he was prevaricating. He clearly knew the answers but was refusing to answer them and they knew it.

Rarely are they able to do so otherwise.	So they have a responsibilty to the working class.	By the way, what major charities does Trump donate to?	NOT his fraudulent Foundation
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Whose demonizing them?	Only the ones that hide their wealth in off shore banks and shell companies, but otherwise it's not their fault...anyone would take a tax break.	It is the fault of Trump policy (lately) for significantly lowering their taxes, while pushing national debt up.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows If the RICH aren't hiding their income in off shore shell companies to avoid taxes( which Trump campaigned on stopping but hasn't done of course), and pay, it would help.	Look at the rate of illegal immigrants over the last 50 years. They have dropped considerably!!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows This is true for those that make a decent wage. It is NOT true for those who can barely scrap enough money together for rent and food after working 2 or 3 jobs.
@Persister911 @l_jxson @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Again his spontaneous words and actions betray the words his speech writter writes for him to repeat on hid teleprompter.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Yes, they clearly were on their guard...but they had reason to be. They also asked for this meeting to be private but Trump wanted it in front of all the cameras. It came back to bite him in the end though we he said he would happily take FULL responsibility for the shytdown.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Trump is a movie star. He knows how to put on the charm. He knows how to make people feel welcome or how to intimidate them. He knows how to "make the camera " love him"!
@Persister911 @l_jxson @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Trudeau from Canada had a "preplan" how to avoid Trumps nasty arm pulling handshake. In fact it became a standing joke for European leaders how to avoid it.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Trump loves the spotlight. He is a very social person. He he loves adulation! That's why he seems warm and friendly to his fans. Funny, he isn't warm and friendly to the 55% Dems, despite you saying he loves ALL AMERICANS.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows You know that sounds wonderful..."less government" but tell me practically, what are you going to get them to stop doing?	Infrastructure?	Schools?	Health care for the poor?	Safety?	Immigration?	What they could stop doing is building a WALL,  SPACE PROGRAM, 50 White House Lawyers
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Sorry. It IS due to Trumps tax "cuts"...as we have been saying, it benefits the very Wealthy but the lower classes barely get a cost of living increase, if that.	It hurts the lower classes the most yet they are the ones fiercely defending it! The only explanation is ignorance!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows That's why it should be federal...but tell Donald that!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I agree with vocational trading too. We have too many kids that don't make it through high school. It would give them some practical training, making them more successful.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows The reality is that we are paying health care for the poor anyway that show up in hospitals. Because they don't have consistent follow up care , their health is worse, costing the system even more.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I dont think a higher population affects it one way or another...the poverty and unemployment rate would.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows What I don't get is the GOP base is apparently more blue collar workers, and therefore are the ones that would benefit the most from a democratic socialist society but yet they have been " brainwashed" ( I can't explain it any other way) to believe it's such a terrible thing.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Income disparity is one of the problems of capitalism...Europe is slightly Moe democratic socialist and the top 10% own 37% of the nation's wealth...in USA, where the capitalists fight democratic socialism, they own 50% of the nation's wealth and growing more every year!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Lots of countries have built their nation on grit and determination and hard work. Canada for one.	Yet they have more social programs and are considered some of the happiest people in the world. Economy is capitalistic but society more caring about people.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows For instance, the infant mortality rate in the USA is almost twice as high as comparable countries in the world...so much from for the "great health care"	It's interesting reading.	Look up "best countries in the world to live in" and the "happiest countries in the world to live"
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I hate to disagree but USA is NOT the best country in the world, not by any study. Switzerland ranks 1st, Japan 2nd, Canada 3rd and the USA is 8th. Interestingly, the one study mentioned since Trump took over, in 2016, they now question Americas future influence in the world...
@Persister911 @l_jxson @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I am a Christain as well and yet I base my voting on many things in a Leader...with Truth and good moral character being one of them.
@l_jxson @toothmanelite @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows But the question is...are these homeless illegal immigrants?	I doubt that no more than a very few Are?	And if they Are, how do you know that a WALL will stop them They may have come in a different way.	I feel Trump is blaming Illegal immigrants for ALL America's social problems!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows A mixture of "deocratic socialism" and "capitalism" has worked and working well in many countries!	Pur capitalusm is just greed and control by the RICH. It created only two classes. The reason we have a middle class is because we have some level of socialism such as unions, etc.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows No, it is to tax the top 10% who make 90% of the wealth and the top 1%, that make over 50% of the wealth!!	The lower and middle classes are left paying little tax!	It is all graduated.	Trump tax cut probably saved you a few hundred a years! It saved the RICH millions a year!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Unfortunately, the party that used to care for the poor several decades ago, the GOP, has lost their way and are becoming a pure CAPITALIST party, caring little for the improverished or unfortunate.	The Party that used to be the capitalists have become the Democratic Socialists.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows 3...advocating straight "Socialism" where everyone shares ownership or shares in companies.	Democratic Socialists in America want SOME of the values of a socialistic society, similar to the values of Christianity, where everyone is equal and the RICH help care for the poor!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows ...Socialism is that Democratic Socialists don't want the government to own the means of production and Socialists do. They believe that certain general social goods like health care should be run by the government, but otherwise support capitalism.	NO ONE in America is....
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Most people get democratic socialism mixed up with with Straight Socialism.	Most have little idea what they are talking about.

Then hopefully Trump will agree!
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I don't believe he has been very fluid on this publically till the last month or two.

@l_jxson @toothmanelite @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I agree about CNN. But I feel FOX is at the same category...Again the regular NEWS for both are less so but the commentaries certainly are!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Sanctification is a long process. But a Leader, especially the most important man in the world, needs to control every word that comes out of his mouth. He will be judged for it because he has chosen to be such a Leader.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Yes, it sounded that way. Unfortunately his actions and other rhetoric, NOT written by his speech writer,  often indicate otherwise.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I strongly believe pastors, like Billy Graham learned early on, should stay out of politics. I do not think they should be preaching politics from the pulpit.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows No I think they should hold office but I believe that, like a judge, they need to be impartial.

@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Yes both do occur , as they do in our cities and towns by American citizens...they just head a huge sting operation that busted hundreds of Americans, including a border patrol agent and a pastor.

@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Please DO go on about his accomplishments....
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Record unemoyment is great. It has been rising for 8 straight years.  I am not sure how much that is from the tax stimulus or how much is an upswing of the economy. We will see as over the next few quarters.	I agree with exporting DANGEROUS Illegals but NOT normal asylum citizens
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Agree about constitutional judges but can we know that they are truly impartial? No, we can't!	I agree about having better border security everywhere in America, including the southern wall,  but I believe in a SMART WALL, more infrastructure, manpower and Immigration judges.
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Redistribution of wealth is NOT in constitution but it is a caring compassionate policy for any society and has been since the beginning of civilization!	We were lucky in the "birth lottery" but many many aren't.	Why should they be penalized?
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I totally disagree about getting out of the climate accord but I don't think the carbon tax is the best way for consumers...perhaps for large businesses only.
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Sorry...don't agree with tax cuts..it is easy drop tax rates for the middle and lower classes based on income but keep personal income taxs high on the extremly weathy	I agree about NATO, but they had all made comittments to do it anyway over next 3 years.
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows One more chance...	Please tell me what you think he deserves credit for?	Please give me data for somethings that DO NOT BENIFIT THE RICH and  do not include the ineffective WALL.
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Actually I think you are beyond being able to accept ANY fact, even if it would hold water.	Suit yourself.	So I am no longer interested in debating with someone who is blinded by his adulation!	Good bye.
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows So ALL AMERICANS  are RAPISTS?	Do you deny that there are many  rapists in America?	Funny, I bet you don't agree with that logic!	Funny...the stats say there is a greater percentage of rapists who are American citizens than illegal immigrants!
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows You realize HE IS  the head of the "corrupt" Fderal government?	That he is part of that corruption?
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows It is amazing that so many of the people close to Trump have been indicted and plead guilty regarding the case. That his Foundation is indicted.	Yes we don't know 100% but we have a very good idea.	But don't worry..the Truth will come out!	He has nothing to fear if he's innocent!
@czyolman @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi My point exactly! 	About the far right being unable to debate politics reasonably. Instead, they are ONLY able to name call, show rudeness and divisiveness.
@Biggy12Rbign1 @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi I have spent 42 years working in delivery rooms and NICU fighting to save babies lives. There is NO HATE THERE!	Sometimes a little one is born with SEVERE congenital abnormalities, INCOMPATIBLE with LIFE, and they are held till they pass away. There is NO MURDER.	Stop hating!
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows https://t.co/pi5xIpbmTB
@TDufon Look up how the Pill prevents the egg implanting in the uterus!
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Yes, but being POTUS is different than running your own little business empire!	One needs to understand way,  way more than that, which is why he is failing.
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Again...you are blinded to his probable corruption. I could accept it better if you could admit it, but not the fact that you pretend it doesn't exist!	That's hypocrisy!
@TDufon Have you ever taken the Pill or your partner or used an IUD?	That is "aborting" a "conceived", fertilized  growinfg egg...do you call that murder?	I am just curious...
@l_jxson @toothmanelite @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Respecting the office is different that excusing bad actions. 	This is extreme but Nero was in the office of Cesear during the early Church but he was one of the most wicked leaders known to this day. They respected his office but NEVER condoned his actions or Words!
@countrysherry @usmc0207 @David03593245 @CSkaar1 @Diehard45C @SpeakerPelosi Clearly we don't know the details on this. If he was wrong, he was wrong! And he will get diciplined for that. The Dems promote zero tolerance of racism from anyone!	But rather than get your emotions all stirred up, wait till you get the real facts.
@countrysherry @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi I see a lot of tweets EVERY day, full of anger and emotion, calling the Dems "haters" and "murderers" etc.	I rarely see those words going the opposite direction.	Just saying...
@David03593245 @countrysherry @Diehard45C @SpeakerPelosi David, I am not talking necessarily about you because your responses to my tweets don't indicate that,     but the "re-tweets" you post often are full of emotional anger and posted "hate" language.	I think we all need to be careful what we re- tweet. Me included. I am trying.
@toothmanelite @l_jxson @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows He is on public TV saying exactly that.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Words and actions should agree, otherwise there is conflict as is evident. Otherwise neither can be believed or trusted!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows The audit is finished. Now the Senate Finance Committee is looking for ways to prevent the House from seing them.	He is deliberately hiding them because he has something to hide. Otherwise it would NO PROBLEM!	Same as the MEULLER investigation! 	He should be happy to be cleared.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows There is a big difference between respecting and admiring someone and worshiping him!	He has risen to cult status for many far right wing GOP.	They don't see him in normal light. 	I understand I have some bias but even with that taken into account, I am shocked by the emotions!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Leslie...please list off things he has accomplished?	Aside from things he has done for the RICH.	Even the child tax benifit, he increased  the limit so that people who make up to $400,000 a year can claim it! (up from $200,000).	Mist of what he has done is for the rich!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Some do worship him. In fact many do. Its evident in the extreme emotions they feel about him, as I see on Twitter frequently. Its more than respect. They can't see the truth from falsehood even if the stats are staring at them. No matter how corrupt he may be, they overlook it!
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows When has he corrected himself when he has given the wrong info?	He is the POTUS...he is, and rightly so, held to a much higher standard than others. He is supposed to give ACCURATE data and information. He has thousands who work for him that make sure that it is correct	No excuse
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Thats Deception! 	You keep excusing him by saying "everyone lies"!	But I don't know of a POTUS that has either lied or deliberately misinformed people over 4300 times in two years.	The fact that Christians, who should have a very different standard, excuse him is wrong.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows For instance, when he says ICE has confiscated hundreds of thousands of DRUGS, while advocating for the Southern Border Wall, yet 90% of those drugs come in through LEGAL ENTRY POINTS at any of our 7500 miles of borders or through airports, seaports, etc. He doesnt tell them that
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Yes, many of the statistics he quotes are not lies but are inaccurate or misrepresented deliberately to influence the uniformed listener to think otherwise. To me, that's a form of a lie because you know the resulting INTERPRETATION is NOT the Truth.
@l_jxson @toothmanelite @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows https://t.co/gxCmx3MEXo
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows If he is a Christian, and promotes it, being in a position of power, he should certainly be more self controlled...yesturday he called Schumer a "Son of a Bi...ch" publically.	His public words and behaviour make me question his sincerity about being a Christian.
@l_jxson @Persister911 @toothmanelite @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows I agree with Persister. I think Christians should stay out of  politics and the State should stay out of religion.	We are a multiculteral society, all people are to be treated equally with freedom to believe as they wish.	My personal beliefs should not diminish your rights.
@l_jxson @toothmanelite @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows You think Fox is balanced because of YOUR BIAS. The people who judge 600 News stations around the world disagree. Because I listen to mostly non biased or slightly biased news, I also disagree. CNN and FOX are clearly in the same category.
@l_jxson @toothmanelite @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows It is a very fair comparison. I think you are a little blinded. Almost every neutral company that judges bias, say they are BOTH extreme right or left in their opinions or editorials. Both get slightly "left or right" of centre on their NEWS if you don't listen to their "opinion"
@l_jxson @toothmanelite @Persister911 @madvandale @RepMarkMeadows Naturally that is true...but as you yourself has said, many of us, because of our experience have a good sense of reading people.	Yes, I have biases but then so do you. The TRUTH lies somewhere in the middle. 	But his actions and his OWN words tell much of the story.
@ProudRepublica4 @Brenderm1 More name calling.	More rudeness.	More anger.	More false information.	If you really want to share debate and not the hate you seem so interested in, please use statistics and real information please.	If not, stay off my feed.
@Brenderm1 If you are really interested in debate, please cut out the name calling and swearing. I am happy to have vigorous debate but only with someone who can rise above the rudeness.	If not, no problem...
@Brenderm1 90 % of ALL DRUGS are smuggled through at border entries!	That fact that you would suggest that ANY AMERICAN political party wants Cartels, drug trafficking, stealing and raping suggests to me how brainwashed you are by false emotional propaganda. NO ONE wants that!!
@brendapower88 @Brenderm1 Brenda, you seem to be full of anger. 	Vietnam was 45 years ago. 	Parties change! 	Both have big time.	Let the past go, focus on todays reality and real statistics please. 	You are the ones calling us baby killers, NOT me calling you!
@Brenderm1 The immigrants would be happy to work. Then are often very hard workers. Then they would pay taxes...it's when we keep them in limbo for years that it becomes a problem.	We need more immigration judges to settle their cases.
@Brenderm1 Dems want fair taxes...they just want the very RICH to pay more, NOT the lower middle or lower classes!	90% of ALL WEALTH is owned by 10% of our population, with 1% of them owning 50%! They make their money off the backs of the workers. The GOP used to tax the rich but dont now.
@Brenderm1 To begin with, only a few states allow "late abortion", which is over the usual 20 weeks, but not after 24 weeks, except in exceptional cases.	Only 3% of all abortions fall into these last two categories, with almost all of them being in the few days or week after 20 wks.
@Brenderm1 You know, I support the Dems but I don't support abortion.	As a delivery nurse and NICU nurse for 42 years, I was in the business of saving fetuses, not aborting them but I do have some expertise in the area of late stage "slaughter" or "infanticide", which you chose to call it!
@Brenderm1 I support the Dems now. Only recently though.	Are they perfect? No!	But they care about real people, NOT just BIG BUSINESS and the RICH.	Aside from abortion, which I don't agree with, I support FAR MORE of their policies than I do of the GOP under Trump.
@CSkaar1 @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi I don't hate. I am not obsessed!	But the far right feels that everyone who disagrees with them does.	I say, get over it!	It's not true!
@CSkaar1 @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi Do want me to keep going?	The Rebublicans, when I supported them USED to care about the People but now they only care about the RICH and NOT the working class. They used to be the party of a balanced budget but now has INCREASED DEBT more than ANY POTUS in good economic times!
@CSkaar1 @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi They support gun controls to help prevent the 36,000 deaths every year from GUNS in America.	They believe that all people are created equal and should be treated humanely, NOT in separating familes and putting them in cages. Or calling a whole race rapists and murderers!
@CSkaar1 @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi They support small business, NOT just big business like the GOP.	They support more opportunities and more affordable post secondary education, more money into schools rather than private schools like the GOP. They support free pre-kindergardens.
@CSkaar1 @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi They support taxing the 1% super rich that make OVER 50% of ALL AMERICAN INCOME, and the 10% who make 90% ,to pay for better benifits for workers and the disabled and poor.	They support better maternity leave for women.	They support carrying for the environment for our children.
@CSkaar1 @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi The left supports the workers with safety rules, which Trump is dismantling. They support medicare for all and because I have experienced it in Canada and abroad, I believe in it.	They support higher minimum wages which Trump does not...he would rather the RICH keep in the money.
@CSkaar1 @Diehard45C @David03593245 @SpeakerPelosi So you agree with me we can disagree on policy, without hating?	THAT is the point! 	It's not me throwing that word around.
@sdeitch @Chrisconsrv1776 @David03593245 FYI, I do not support abortions. I have spent 42 of my working life  trying to save babies in labor rooms and NICU, not kill them.But I hate it when people deliberately demonize the other side, twisting information they know little or nothing about, making claims that aren't true
@sdeitch @Chrisconsrv1776 @David03593245 Abnomalties DO  crop up in the middle of a pregnancy, depending on when the U/S is done. Often that's 18 weeks and sometimes a week or two later.
@sdeitch @Chrisconsrv1776 @David03593245 So these states, where abortion is allowed up to 24 weeks, account for  the majority of late term abortions in America, which often occur just past 20 weeks.	Many of those are for abnormalities and certainly the vast majority beyond that 24 week age, are for severe abnormalities.
@sdeitch @Chrisconsrv1776 @David03593245 This, as you read, is a very inadequate study with lots of limitations. It calls late term abortions anything after 20 weeks, which means you could call a 20 weeks and 1 day late abortion. Unfortunately several states allow abortions up to 24 weeks which is the age of viability..
@IrmaBel53130008 @Diehard45C @robjh1 @SpeakerPelosi No, this was exactly what the governor was talking about...letting little ones go that weren't "compatible with life" or weren't "viable".	But the GOP got on the bandwagon and spun it to say Dems supported "infanticide", that they were murderers. THIS WAS WRONG!
@David03593245 @Diehard45C @SpeakerPelosi You are right...nothing is free but the 1% rich who own over 50% of America's wealth can help. 	Did you know Trumps last change enanles a family up to making $400,000 a year can recieve child tax credits with this last Bill, up from $200,000.	The wealthy get wealthier!!

@murray_montana @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Yes, the USA gets a slightly better percent of milk (3.6%) without tarrifs, as opposed to 3.2% to the other T.P.P. countries, but not significantly. These issues could have been dealt with easily without tariff wars, within the T.PP.	But Trump always has to do it his bully way.

@murray_montana @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Posting and buying back their shares to make their shareholders twice as rich. So RICH companies are just getting richer, owning a greater % of the shares than ever before. So fewer people are owning almost ALL of the wealth.	They pay little tax and our debt is climbing crazy.
@murray_montana @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump The economics are that while Trump has been in power, the rich have gotten substantially richer, 30 to 40% and the working class has barely increased the cost of living.	These big corperations, instead of investing in New plants and better wages, they are just posting.....
@murray_montana @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Trump has the LEAST women in SENIOR CABINET positions than the last two administrations. He has only 22%.	Obama had 32% in his first term, 35% in his second term.	Clinton had 31% in his first term and 41% in his second.	Maybe Trump means "secretaries"?	Try researching real stats.
@murray_montana @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump NAFTA was not a trainwreck...all agreed it needed updating including Canada it because they were losing to the USA in services	All Trump did with his bulling methods was to lose a friend in CANADA.

@murray_montana @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I truly believe Trump is narcissistic...that everything he does is to further his own needs.

@murray_montana @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump The GOP used to be for having good international relationships but now Trump is destroying them.

@murray_montana @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump You are right...Although I have always had conservative values, I am strongly disappointed by the GOP lately. They used to be the party of caring for the people but now they have swung over to BIG BUSINESS. They used to be for balanced budgets but now they are for big spending..

@GOP A WORLD LEADER?	Who are you kidding?	He has done more damage to AMERICA than ANY other POTUS. 	None of our democratic allies trust Trump! They are just hanging in there till we have a new LEADER!	He has dismantled more relationships by being narcisstic, rude and untrustworthy.

@dbongino Dan, you clearly have litle or no understanding. I do NOT support abortion but, as a delivery room nurse of 40 years, Do SUPPORT letting a baby go that has a severe congenital abnormality that is incompatible with LIFE. You apparently call that infanticide!
@dbongino I agree...but I am curious. Does your wife or partner use the Pill or an IUD or equivelent?	Because if so, she is, in effect, aborting a fertilized growing egg? 	It prevents it from implanting into the uterus.	So I assume not?
@rjp674 @KellyannePolls @mboyle1 @mschlapp @MattRooneyNJ Congradulations! I trust she is healthy!	I imagine you had quite a journey. Did her heart ever stop?	At 24 weeks, we are able to sustain life...but a week or two earlier and we are unable too. Every day counts at this point.
@frfrankpavone @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He is NOT the most pro life POTUS in history...lots have come before him.	In fact, other than rhetoric to appease you, what exactly has he done to prevent it??
@nolaelizabeth22 Yet when anyone suggests that we let a baby with severe congenital abnormalities die peacefully because THEIR little lives are NOT COMPATIBLE with LIFE, you all cry "infanticide"!	I do not support abortion yet this makes me very angry!	Most people have NO idea about the reality!
@nolaelizabeth22 That is a very simplified statement..many times we restart a heart!	Because of technology, the question is how long do we try to prolong a life? At what point do we say, it's in God's hands, it's time to let them go? That's the issue.
@cnsnews Would you rather these little ones, whose little lives are NOT compatible with LIFE, be used as guinea pigs? To experiment with?	Would you want that for your child?
@cnsnews These babies are NOT VIABLE. 	Perhaps their spinal cord is outside it's body.	Perhaps their brain is 1/4 it's size.	Perhaps they are so premature, say 22 weeks, so they are incompatible with life.	So these little ones are cuddled till they pass away.	This is NOT INFANTICIDE!
@cnsnews How many thousands of births have you been at?	I have been at many. What he is saying has been done for hundreds of years	What you conveniently choose to OMIT is that these babies have SEVERE ABNORMALITIES that are INCOMPATABLE WITH LIFE! 	Perhaps NO kidneys, or NO abdominal wall

@DanetteFulk @RepMarkMeadows You know the RIGHT talks of hate all the time! Trump has filled your heads with this propaganda!	Have you ever thought we simply don't agree with HIS POLICY?	Or his RHETORIC?	The right is consumed with the word "hate"! And it is rarely true!Please get over it.
@pippyschlo @jgrande42360408 @RealDrGina @AnnCoulter @ABC7 No matter what they decide, we need a system that immediately identifies the breech, then tracks them till ICE gets there. 	Trump was supposed to have hired 15,000 more SECURITY guards in March 2017 and ONLY 33 have been hired! Incompetence!!	We need 100s more Immigration judges!
@DanetteFulk @RepMarkMeadows Overwhelming evidence that they work IN THAT AREA because they just move elsewhere where it is easier. Or wait till another tunnel is built! 	But does it help OVERALL AMERICA? NO! 	You don't understand the fear and determination in these people to have a safer and better life.
@pippyschlo @jgrande42360408 @RealDrGina @AnnCoulter @ABC7 Except that less than 2 weeks ago, almost 300 people went OVER the WALL, Then turned themselves in for asylum. Near the same area, days beforehand, almost 400 went UNDER THE WALL and turned themselves in.	So  working individually may be a problem, but collectively, it seems NOT.
@thehill Clearly the POTIS has some very damaging information to hide in his tax returns! 	As the first POTUS EVER refusing to show his tax returns, there must be a significant level of corruption there. Or at the very least, off shore shell companies where he evades American Taxes!
@YankeeMikeH0tel @Robertedinger2 @RepMarkMeadows Apparently it was very old technology that was not useful..the Border guards are requesting new technology as well as infrastructure and lots more manpower.	Technology has improved vastly since then
@Chrisconsrv1776 @David03593245 THIS is fear mongering at its worst.	NO ONE supports INFANTICIDE!	You must understand what "NOT VIABLE" or "INCOMPATIBLE with LIFE is!	Would you resuscitate a child with no abdominal wall to keep his guts in or a child with their spinal column outside their body? 	Of course not.

@robinsondebby1 @RepMarkMeadows We need Good BORDER SECURITY...perhaps a few more miles of WALL in critical areas only. But I believe that a SMART WALL is more effective elsewhere at 1/10 of the cost of a solid wall, allowing the saved money to hire LOTS of manpower and build other infrastructure like roads.
@GOP No one wants 3rd trimester abortions. If you had a baby with no skull bones, or no stomach muscles to hold the guts in or as baby with his spinal cord outside his body, or one with no kidneys, are you going to vigorously resuscitate that child?	These conditions are NOT VIABLE!	NO
@GOP THIS is wrong.	This is just lies about open borders and 3rd trimester abortions. Something the GOP has no problem doing...lying!	The Democrats don't want those things.	Dems STRONGLY SUPPORT BORDER SECURITY... But a SMART WALL  with manpower, not a solid wall.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Trump has had 2 years to hire more border guards But has only hired 33!	He has had 2 years to hire LOTS more Immigration Judges to help with the thousands of back logs of immigrants waiting. He has done nothing!	He has been so obsessed with his WALL, that he hasn't done anything!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Pleeease...what does having a WALL help with the exploitation of women and children?	The desperate come no matter what...by leaving them waiting for months for their claims to be processed, by not giving them jobs, Trump is causing these women and children to be exploited.

@bailysisland @RepMarkMeadows https://t.co/L9k5X1C3NA
@bailysisland @RepMarkMeadows Government statistics say that. I am not sure how they know. 	You have to remember that drugs come in through airports, seaports, from China, etc. Not just the southern border. 	I understand it is 90% of ALL DRUGS!
@deborahann770 @RepMarkMeadows The question is, if we are using all that manpower and technolgy anyway, do we need an extra wall that costs 10 TIMES the cost of a SMART WALL. Is the cost of building it and the maintenance worth it for the additional difference that it makes. We KNOW they can breech it easily.
@deborahann770 @RepMarkMeadows But Deborah, Trump never campaigned on any of those additional things...he is only recently, in the last month or so, been talking about them at all publically, in addition to a WALL. This is good though, as a WALL is ineffective on its own. I am glad he is seeing more clearly.

@Robertedinger2 @RepMarkMeadows THIS is true but the big cartels that smuggle them through usually go through border entries. The little guys probably don't.	With A SMART WALL, we can immediately identify the "Wall" has been breeches, and then can track them till they are caught.
@deborahann770 @RepMarkMeadows But if you had a SMART WALL, we would know exactly When and Where they breeched the border and have a tracking system to follow them until they are caught.	With a WALL, they can go over or under it and no one is any wiser.
@David03593245 Please send me info that illegals get $3500 month. I can find NO such info. In fact, I find the opposite to be true.	Not accounting for corruption of course.
@Cat69Q @RepMarkMeadows But a SMART WALL would notify them immediately of the breech and then track them till they are caught.	Now, and with a regular wall, they can go over It, under it and no one knows they came in.	A SMART WALL would change that.	It would also prevent them dying in the desert.
@David03593245 Do you think a Wall will protect America from its social evils?	You are sadly mistaken.	90% of ALL DRUGS are smuggled through at border crossings.	50% of illegals overstay their visas. Caravans have a right to apply for asylum according to law	So your great saving will disappear
