@indigopiglets When applying online, Experian may serve a unique referral code to an applicant for over-the-phone verification. Did you see a referral code when the page asked you to call? If not, you will need to go to a Certified Enroller for in-person verification.

@adjoro We understand. It may be necessary for the County office to correct the application since they are the only ones who have access to the system. If it's possible to wait a few days or until next week (after the CoveredCA deadline), it may be easier to get through to a caseworker.

@MoultonHawk Our apologies for any confusion. One aspect of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) included a tax penalty for those who remained uninsured for more than 2 months in a year. That penalty has been removed, starting in 2019. More here: https://t.co/rz3CqjG2K0
@jwl_weaver Okay, thanks for confirming. We cannot provide medical advice, but we encourage you to call your health insurance carrier to get a list of in-network doctors you can visit. Do you currently have a health insurance plan through Medi-Cal? Or Covered California?
@MoultonHawk Hi there, thanks for reaching out. The Affordable Care Act is still intact, although the individual mandate has been removed for 2019. Please let us know if you have other questions.

Since 2014, more than 3.4 million Californians have purchased health insurance through #CoveredCA, and nearly 4 million have enrolled in Medi-Cal. Together, the gains have cut the uninsured rate in CA from 17% in 2013 to a historic low of 6.8% in 2017.
#CoveredCA saw a ‘gold rush’ of 15% new consumers selecting Gold plans, which have a lower premium due to cost-sharing reduction surcharges that were added to Silver plans. https://t.co/Af7mDIlNLE https://t.co/yZB8ZDiBqM
@JoshuaFAPeck We appreciate the support, Joshua!
“With robust marketing and strong partnerships in communities across California, we attracted more people to #CoveredCA to newly enroll in health insurance this year.” - Executive Director Peter V. Lee

@LordStreetGuru Thanks for the clarifying information. Please know, Medi-Cal and CoveredCA are two separate organizations. Individuals who are eligible for Medi-Cal cannot enroll in a CoveredCA plan with financial aid. How did you initially apply for coverage with Medi-Cal? DM us if you prefer. https://t.co/MZjGnCs8oK
@LordStreetGuru Hi there, thanks for reaching out. The tax penalty for being uninsured for longer than 2 months in a year applies for 2017 and 2018 taxes. The coverage that you had last month, was it through Medi-Cal?

@hannahm0nster If you were not provided this code, or Experian is not able to confirm your identity, you will need to go to a Certified Enroller for in-person visual verification with your Driver's License or ID. You can find one in your area here: https://t.co/dMaJg2KatP

@roger_brenz Hi, we wanted to let you know that the elimination of the individual mandate does not go into effect until 2019. Please refer to page 39 of the tax bill, which states the amendments "shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2018." https://t.co/iBNYK4TfDh
@fannerfifty He can contact the county office where he currently resides to submit an application, or have his enrollment transferred from another county if it is still in effect. The link above will list the contact information for the county office(s) he will need to call.
@Sucobe Hi Hardy, have you tried contacting your health carrier? They should be able to provide you with a list of in-network providers to change your primary doctor.  Find your carrier's contact information here: https://t.co/mm2BQBi9Ae
@cynderellaaa_ Okay! Your current insurance carrier will know when your coverage ends. To avoid a gap in coverage, we encourage you to contact your current carrier to confirm. If you'd like coverage starting April 1, please apply in mid-March. You may view plans here: https://t.co/dEZxWileCH
@cynderellaaa_ Thanks for confirming. Since you are eligible for Special Enrollment, which allows you to enroll outside of Open Enrollment, you may apply now for March 1 coverage. Are you currently covered by your parent's health plan? If so, when does that coverage end?
@fannerfifty Since Medi-Cal and CoveredCA are two separate organizations, please contact your local county office to inquire on your son's enrollment status: https://t.co/jk9yWaClL1
@fannerfifty Hi there, we appreciate you reaching out for your son. Please know, eligibility for Medi-Cal is based on income. Changes in income must be reported within 30 days. When a member's income is too high, Medi-Cal will send a letter informing them they no longer qualify.
@53_charlie Also, please note, the elimination of the penalty does not go into effect until 2019. Those without coverage in 2018 will face the penalty unless they are exempt. Learn more here: https://t.co/rz3CqjG2K0
@53_charlie Hi Charlie, if you don't make enough to qualify for CoveredCA, have you looked to see if you're eligible for Medi-Cal? You can use our Shop and Compare tool to find out: https://t.co/dEZxWileCH
@DT_800 That's great to hear! Thanks for the update. We're happy to help, feel free to reach out to us again if you should need anything.

@Tinydelta2003 If it is less than 9.56%, your wife could enroll in a plan through CoveredCA, but would not be eligible to receive tax subsidies to lower the cost. She would likely not be eligible for Medi-Cal because your income will be included when filing your joint tax return.
@Tinydelta2003 Sorry for the delayed reply. Is the cost of your health coverage (only yours) more than 9.56% of your income? If so, it may be considered "unaffordable" and allow you and your wife to have a subsidized plan through CoveredCA. Read more here: https://t.co/rSfjJUbXgR

@theLauraQ Great question, Laura! The short answer is no. Medi-Cal renewal takes place on an annual basis, based on when someone was initially enrolled. So you would need to renew their Medi-Cal coverage in September 2018. Also, Medi-Cal and CoveredCA are separate organizations.
@catchynameguy Our pleasure, and we regret the frustrations. Thank you for your continued patience.

@scottdbender We understand the frustration and concern, Scott. Unfortunately we are unable to assist, however we did want to clarify that you will have 60 days to enroll in CoveredCA once you are released from Medi-Cal since losing coverage is a life qualifying event for Special Enrollment.
RT @CAproTem: Enroll or renew today to meet the @CoveredCA deadline to ensure your coverage starts January 1st, 2018. https://t.co/9sAYZU0y…
@MissymariaMaria For more information on Special Enrollment Qualifying Life Events, please click here: https://t.co/pXgcfZZ9nd
@MissymariaMaria Hi Missy, great question. Losing coverage - such as by turning 26 - would make your son eligible to enroll via Special Enrollment. It is considered a "qualifying life event". He must enroll within 60 days of his birthday in order to be eligible.
@RonaldOnTheRoad Hi Ronald, great question! December 15 is the deadline for coverage which would begin on January 1. However, Open Enrollment in CA ends on January 31. Our apologies for any confusion.

@TaniaBradkin Hi Tania, our apologies for the delayed reply and frustrations. Do you still need assistance?
@bhennelly Hey Brian, this is great! We're so glad to know you're covered! Just one correction - Open Enrollment in CA ends on January 31 :).
@scottdbender If you are determined eligible for CoveredCA, you can enroll! The good news is that Open Enrollment ends January 31, so you still have time. However, for coverage starting Jan 1, you'll need to resolve with Medi-Cal and enroll with CoveredCA by December 15.
@scottdbender Okay, thank you for clarifying. If you qualify for Medi-Cal, you would not be eligible for financial help through CoveredCA. So, your eligibility for CoveredCA may not be determined until your Medi-Cal status is resolved.
@MatthewParvis Hi Matthew, we're here to help if you need us! https://t.co/MZjGnCs8oK
@scottdbender Do you know if you are eligible for CoveredCA or Medi-Cal? Please note that these are two separate organizations.
@scottdbender Please note that the December 15th deadline only applies to CoveredCA applicants who want coverage to begin on January 1. Not Medi-Cal enrollees. Medi-Cal enrollment is available year round. Also, CoveredCA open enrollment ends January 31.

@purva_epi Hi, Purva. We are required to send a notification in case the change was made without your knowledge. Thanks for understanding.
@ChrysantheTan You're welcome! Unfortunately you can't change plans unless it is Open Enrollment (which ends January 31, 2018) or you experience a life-changing event and qualify for Special Enrollment. Find more info here: https://t.co/j4hpWKaYsb
@EPHChospital Thank you for your support!
@bored_agitated For more information on Special Enrollment qualifying life events, please click here: https://t.co/pXgcfZZ9nd		Please let us know if you have any other questions, we're here to help!
@bored_agitated Also, if this change occurs outside of Open Enrollment, it's ok! Losing coverage is considered a "qualifying life event" for Special Enrollment. As long as you apply for new coverage within 60 days of your old plan being terminated, you should be eligible to enroll.
@bored_agitated Hi, great question and thanks for reaching out. Please note, you cannot enroll in new coverage while other coverage is still active. However, if you know when your employer provided coverage will expire, you can enroll so your coverage start date begins when the other ends.
@ChrysantheTan It's important to report any changes of income as they occur so your tax credits can be adjusted to reduce the chances of having to pay them back. Learn more here: https://t.co/J2C6YFxY3v		Let us know if you have any other questions. We're happy to help!
@ChrysantheTan Hi Chysanthe, thanks for your question. Tax credits are based on annual income, but are given based on what you estimate. If your income turned out to be higher than you projected, then you likely received too much and will have to pay back the difference at tax time.
