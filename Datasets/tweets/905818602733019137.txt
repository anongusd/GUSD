#Justice4nera10 is what all Southern Cameroonians want. The unconditional release of our leaders and the withdrawal of the satanic soldiers of LRCameroun from our territories. We will rest when the violation of international law committed by Buhari and Paul Biya is corrected
This is the president of S.Cameroons incarcerated with others in by yaounde junta regime/tried as terrorists in a military court. They risk death penalty or very long prison term if @AsstSecStateAF @realDonaldTrump @USUN does not ask üá®üá≤ gov't to do #Justice4Nera10
DictatorBiya says he is ready for dialogue. Our leaders are facing treason and terrorism charges. The question is, who is he going to dialogue with? Is it Issa Tchiroma ‚ÄòMinister of lies‚Äô or Atanga Nji ‚ÄòMinister of blacklegs association‚Äô. #Justice4Nera10
@antonioguterres @UN_GP_RtoP When are you going to stop the genocide that is already in full gear? Is @UN_GP_RtoP abdicating its duty? Or has the @UNSG @antonioguterres decided that Cameroon's dictator is above the international law? Someone answer me? #Justice4Nera10
