"People want fame, they want money ... it's happened to me many times," Trump says when asked how allegations against him affect his thinking on the charges against Kavanaugh.
Well, it was bound to happen. Trump is lashing out as the women who have accused him of sexual assault and the media for its coverage of their allegations.
"I was accused by four or five women," Trump says, suggesting without evidence that his accusers were paid. (There are at least 17 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.)
"It's a very tough situation for a women, there's no question about it ... I'm not saying they had to report it," Trump says. (Thing is, he already attacked Kavanaugh's accusers for not reporting in real time.)

Asked if he can understand, as the father of daughters, why women don't report sexual assault, Trump continues to discredit accusers: "Thirty-six years, no charge, no nothing. People are doing to have to make a decision."
"This is one of the highest quality people that I've ever met," Trump says of Kavanaugh. "These are false accusations."
"They know it's a big, fat con job," Trump says of Democrats and allegations against Kavanaugh.
"I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.  But I have never done that to her or to anyone," Brett Kavanaugh will testify tomorrow. "I am innocent of this charge."

"I do not believe that a claim of sexual assault is invalid because a  15-year-old girl didn‚Äôt promptly report the assault to the authorities, as the President of the United States said," Jeff Flake says. "How uninformed and uncaring do you have to be to say things like that?"
"I don‚Äôt believe that Judge Kavanaugh is some kind of serial sexual predator, as has been alleged by some on the left," Jeff Flake says.
Jeff Flake: "I don't believe that Dr. Ford is part of some kind of vast conspiracy from start to finish to smear Judge Kavanaugh, as has been alleged by some on the right."
All 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are calling on Trump to withdraw the Kavanaugh nomination or order an FBI investigation into the allegations against him.
"These people are not props for us to make our political points," Jeff Flake says on the Senate floor of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanugh.
In statement, Lindsey Graham dismisses Avenatti as "the lawyer to porn stars"; the case involving Stormy Daniels has proved to be among the most impactful of the Trump presidency.

Upon his return to Washington, the President plans to meet with members of Congress behind closed doors at the White House tomorrow afternoon.
Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump push the same talking points when pressed on Russian interference in the US election: That the real story is ‚Äòcorruption' within the Democratic Party. (12 Russian military officers were indicted last week for hacking &amp; leaking Democratic emails.)
Putin denies once again to Chris Wallace that Russians have dirt on Trump: "I don‚Äôt want to insult President Trump when I say this, and it may come as rude, but before he announced that he will run for [the] presidency, he was of no interest for us."
As Chris Wallace confronts Putin with last week's indictment of 12 Russian military officers, Putin laughs. Wallace attempts to hand a copy of the charges to Putin, who declines.

Kennedy addresses Dreamers in Spanish, then translates: 		"To all the Dreamers watching tonight, let me be clear: Ustedes son parte de nuestra historia. Vamos a luchar por ustedes y no nos vamos alejar.		You are a part of our story. We will fight for you. We will not walk away."
Kennedy: "We are bombarded with one false choice after another: Coal miners or single moms. Rural communities or inner cities. The coast or the heartland."
In #SOTU rebuttal, Joe Kennedy speaks of ‚Äúthat nagging, sinking feeling, no matter your political beliefs: this is not right. This is not who we are."
The state of the union, in Joe Kennedy‚Äôs words: "Russia knee-deep in our democracy. An all-out war on environmental protection. A Justice Department rolling back civil rights by the day. Hatred and supremacy proudly marching in our streets."
