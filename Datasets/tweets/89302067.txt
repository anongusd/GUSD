All I have to do is make it to Friday, and I can sleep in.
I suddenly realized how busy of a person I am this week. Is this what it's like being an adult?
I hope tomorrow is unseasonably warm. Just sayin'.
It occurs to me that The Big Bang Theory was on last night and I didn't watch. I've failed as a nerd.

#20factsaboutme 13. I'm quite sarcastic. Can't help it...
@redmeansstopftw XD LOL that's awesome :D
#20factsaboutme 12. I think @jacksfilms is adorable. Except when he's doing creepy face. Creepy face is creepy.
@redmeansstopftw oh dear, what was it?
#20factsaboutme 11. I don't know why I'm not comfortable being myself when I'm not around close family and friends.
#20factsaboutme 10. I listen to music from just about every genre. So don't ask what kind of music I like cuz I'll just say "everything." XD
#20factsaboutme 9. @JeffBryanDavis and @TobyTurner are probably my favorite celebs in the whole wide world. &lt;3
#20factsaboutme 8. I think @jasonsegel is just adorable. :3
#20factsaboutme 7. I still haven't got my RT from Jeff :( (but I'm not gonna go spam him about it)
#20factsaboutme I just realized I stopped numbering these and now I have to go back and count... XD
#20factsaboutme I love wearing crazy socks. If I'm wearing black or white socks, it's cuz all my awesome ones are in the laundry.
#20factsaboutme I do #FFs every week cuz I love my friends and followers. &lt;3
#20factsaboutme 3. I usually follow back, unless you're an ad-bot, or if you've been on twitter for like 10 years and have 0 tweets.
#20factsaboutme 2. I HATE my hair. It's just ridiculous. If shaving your head was the trendy thing to do, I'd jump on the bandwagon.
#20factsaboutme 1. I turned 18 last month. Adulthood, woo!
Bored, so I suppose I'll do #20factsaboutme.
*sigh* Its cold and rainy and I wanna go back to sleep :/
