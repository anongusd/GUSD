@POTUS President Obama needs to suspend his vacation and visit Louisiana. The people of Louisiana needs  him NOW. MR PRESIDENT,ACT NOW
@TheLastWord  Donald Trump and Gov Christie are good friends? Really? SeriouslyAnd Donald Trump's comments on Bridge gate? A friend?
HillaryClinton needs "hot, die-hard" surrogates not the "lukewarm " type. Not someone who cannot defend her honesty. I'm nauseated 😩
It is disheartening to watch a HillaryClinton supporter dodge a simple question about whether Hillary is honest or not. Not a good supporter
Wait a minute, why should a HillaryClinton's supporter find it so hard to answer a simple question: Is HillaryClinton honest or not? Why ?
Listening to Donald Trump's Law and Order speech; l did not hear anything new.TelePrompTer with Donald Trump? Really? He criticized its use😉
The media needs to proof check every statement made by all politicians in this nation. Telling lies with recklessness is unacceptable.

Can anyone imagine President Obama responding to everyone negative things said about him all this time? Is anyone listening?	Unbelievable!
Americans deserve a great president who has thick skin, cares about our Military and respect all citizens of this great nation. Wake up!
If The American President has to respond to every negative statements about him;what does this say about the largest Democracy in the world?
Bernie Sanders has a great future ahead of him. He will do great. He should act as the unseen VP Nature would reward him beyond expectations
HillaryClinton should grab Bernie Sanders by the right hand and take him everywhere.This will further unite the party. Barrack, Bernie,Joe👍
HillaryClinton sowed a seed in then Senator Barrack Obama. That seed has produced great harvest.if Bernie sows bountifully,he will reap same
History is on the side of HillaryClinton. Bernie Sanders has a great role to play in Hillary's success. He should not be taken for granted.
Believe me, Donald Trump had a great chance to win this election. He just wasted every opportunity to make history. This is unbelievable.
Donald Trump has one chance to make fortune from this election:He will make a movie out of this process; Will the movie be a hit? Probably 😀
Donald Trump had a great chance to win this election but wasted the opportunity. Can he still make it? No. The train has moved on.
Donald Trump is not going to believe this. He will lose this election for 2 reasons: his conduct, and because it is another time for change.
HillaryClinton's presumed set back will become her setup for the Presidency. We shall all witness this great time in American history. 🙏🏻

I think  politics is all about service to the people. It's not INSULTING people. Right?
Daddies &amp;Mums come out in public &amp; say awful things about fellow Americans in public all in d name of politics,what is the lesson for kids?
So Much hypocrisy on display here.Did you hear RudiGiuliani accusing Bill Clinton of infidelity? Really?Live in a glass house&amp; throw stones!
When people open their mouths any how in the public and say negative and dirty stuff about people in the name of politics,= immaturity. 😩
Rudy Giuliani said  " some police shootings justified, some unjustified .... Hmmmmn. Really?
Giuliani's utterance about Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton is nauseating. I used to hold Giuliani in high esteem. 😩

Bernie and Hillary have the political smartness and maturity for the job. Americans are smart enough to choose the best among these two.

Governor Nikki Haley goofed. Everyday is never a good day because bad things happen. Politicians exaggerate too much. We are not stupid😉
The job of a president is a tough one. It requires more than a college degree;native intelligence, charisma, knowledge and wisdom are vital.
The problem though with Mr. Trump is the ability to provide and define specifics about policies. He needs to get ready for this.
Something tells me Mitch McConnell doesn't know that Americans elected Uncle Barrack to be American President 2x &amp; so empowered him.Amnesia!
