@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump If we nominate donald it will be the end of the gop as we know it! Who was it that said that #lindseygraham? √ëyet
@RepMarkMeadows Just cause the gop has bought donald's snake oil doesn't mean the rest of America has &amp; you're loosing ground everytime donald talks, tweets, or takes responsibility for shutting down the government!
@RepMarkMeadows ZERO is what you're getting for a wall today, tomorrow, whenever! Forget it, now start the negotiating when 800,000 workers get their paychecks. 35 yrs gop, no more! " If we nominate donald it will be the end of the gop as we know it" lindsey graham f all you fool with russian $!
@SteveScalise Maybe if there weren't all the guns in America you wouldn't have gotten shot &amp; all the school kids etc wouldn't have lost their opportunity to grow &amp; have a long happy life.Yes we need border security but it involves way more than a wall that Mexico was going to pay for! Grow up!
@DenisD206 @SteveScalise @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump These people had a right to expect to live a long and potentially happy life. Im not trying to take guns away but things have gotten way out of hand.	Thanks to the kids from MSD High School 4 there perseverance &amp; their efforts. Thanks nra for involving russia ...greedy jackasses!
@DenisD206 @SteveScalise @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump What about all the American school kids &amp; church &amp; theater goers etc that have been killed by Americans with guns? Do their lives matter?
