@LFFriedman @christophjoyce @axios Good point!
You're the second person to suggest this. I'm no WH reporter, but I reckon a scientist will never get a question in a WH press briefing. https://t.co/Rx2WtskUj0
@christophjoyce We do that at @axios -- I was in WH post-Paris speech last week. But you can't expect that to be the case every time climate comes up in WH.
Our two options are: 1) no climate questions and 2) climate questions without a ton of climate expertise. Option 2 is better than option 1. https://t.co/KxjkmqD0ac
