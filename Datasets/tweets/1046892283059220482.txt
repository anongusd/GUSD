But only an occasion to advance the real cause which is the accumulation of power to make the revolution.” 	― David Horowitz, Barack Obama's Rules for Revolution: The Alinsky Model
“An SDS radical once wrote, “The issue is never the issue. The issue is always the revolution.” In other words the cause - whether inner city blacks or women - is never the real cause, https://t.co/rhIgel5efV
We are making America great again with or without the resist party.🙏🏻
If you have people like Kanye West supporting Trump, then you know the left is in trouble. I’ve been seeing it more and more and the democrats try to hide it,but it’s coming. They have no platform to run on except, hate. Not many sane people will vote on the side of hate.
They actually think this is going to grow their base. All they are doing is making everyone mad and lessening any real chance they might have had for a blue wave. I predict that not only will there not be a blue wave, the Democrats a creating a red wave.
I have said it before and I will say it again. They liberals are their own worst enemies. They should be going in on Trump for the $824 billion budget that does not fund the wall and fully fund Planned Parenthood. But they are too busy distracting us with this circus.
Half the population should not have to be afraid to be nice- It's infuriating . Being complimentary is part of who I am.
The " Rape " card is way out of control . Absolutely there should be a law that when a woman falsely causes an innocent person to go jail she should be jailed for a long time - in this case 28 years . I myself usually compliment women all the time - now I do not out of fear .
