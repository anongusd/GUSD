"To put patients in a position to economize on health care, I recommend that high-deductible health plans with fewer mandates be widely permitted. . . . To help patients finance health care spending and empower them, we should adopt large, liberalized HSAs for everyone."
"Instill far stronger incentives for patients to save money when considering health care and to equip consumers with the tools to do so. This needs to be coupled with breaking down anti-competitive regulations, so providers would then necessarily compete on price and quality."
"Reducing ACA regulations and allowing health care markets to operate more freely than they do now can significantly reduce health care costs without compromising quality."
"Single-payer systems are deficient on almost all availability and quality dimensions."
"Implementing a single-payer system in California would create an extremely expensive and very poorly performing heath care system. The very positive portrayal of single-payer health care that is presented by its advocates is simply wrong."
"In the absence of reform, California will be extremely vulnerable to a budget crisis and health care will become even more regulated, resulting in reduced availability and lower quality for all those unable to circumvent the system."
"Medi-Cal is taking an increasing share of the budget, as it now accounts for nearly 38% of tax revenues. . . . health outcomes for Medicaid patients also tend to be worse . . . and finding a physician who will accept Medicaid patients is becoming increasingly difficult . . ."
"Within California, the ACA has greatly increased reliance on government-provided health care."
"The ACA regulatory framework has reduced competition in medical care by generating substantial consolidation through mergers of doctor practices and of hospitals."
"The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has imposed substantial new regulations, costs, and taxes on the economy . . ."
