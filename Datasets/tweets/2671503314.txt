@Kushanarchy @dandock At least Chandler got called out on it. Ross was way meaner about it.
@DocChristopherB @thexzoomxcat @thelindsayellis To the art dealer, who might be analogous to a publisher, but not to the public.		An artist who paints but doesn't sell is still considered an artist while a writer who writes but hasn't published isn't a writer.		We can't see the product so we don't appreciate the talent.
@thexzoomxcat @thelindsayellis Like, if you went and bought a canvas and supplies and painted a beautiful painting, no one would say you're not an artist.
@thexzoomxcat @thelindsayellis And that's another thing that sucks because there's a part of us that craves external validation and self-publishing will never really satisfy that.		...which is SO weird because we don't do that with any other art form. In fact, it's the opposite.
@thexzoomxcat @thelindsayellis I think Lindsay makes a great point about how this is often gendered. A lot of dudes can just show up and write about dude things and it will resonate with other dudes resulting in high fives whereas women either have to write dude things or struggle to find an audience.
@thexzoomxcat I need to amend the first tweet to take it up a notch.		"If Patricia Fucking Krmpotich can feel imposter syndrome, no one is safe from it."		‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Three things about this: 1) If Lindsay Fucking Ellis can feel imposter syndrome, no one is safe from it. 2) That fact, in and of itself, is kind of inspiring for others. 3) It seems to be implicit in Dunning-Kruger that you have to be good at something to feel imposter syndrome. https://t.co/qZxejRrhI3

@conib0 Bernie is attractive to voters who realize they are getting screwed by capitalism and are able to parse consumerism and race.		I haven't seen a candidate talk about how they're inextricable, but the only director and movie that did @BootsRiley @Sorry2BotherYou weren't nominated.
@conib0 Not that it's a conscious effort to promote a political agenda, but that they can't engage emotionally or intellectually with material that doesn't resonate with them.		Reconciliation just feels more authentic to Late Boomers than to the generations that have followed.

@TheRealXPac This is something I've always wondered. Why do so few guys breaking in not learn how to work a headlock or something basic? HBK and Owen Hart - 2 guys who COULD do the daredevil act then asked - did nearly 10 minutes around a headlock and it was great. Cost zero spines too.

But the bigger problem in shifting to this trans-erasure narrative is that it doesn't deal with the question of what happens to trans women who will be forced out of "women-only spaces" and into men's spaces.
But in engaging in the hypothetical 'rape' scenario, they acknowledge that trans women can be indistinguishable from cis women and therefore subject to all the same oppressive patriarchal bullshit cis women are.
But the real trap (pun!) is that these #terfs started with the position that "woman" is a political construct oppressed by patriarchy and that trans women can't possibly experience that oppression because they're really men (and therefore PART of the patriarchy).
And also implying that if you have consensual sex with someone you think is cisgender and later find out they're trans, you've been raped. #traptheory
So the rhetorical shift (or maybe subset) seems to be "we need to discuss whether or not trans people exist because their existence would be problematic for lesbians." 		That includes harassing LGBT+ writers who say that women who have sex with trans women are still lesbians.

Undisciplined owners and the lack of salary cap drove up costs.		The owner of those same NJ Generals suggested moving the season to Fall to compete directly with the NFL and suing them for antitrust violations.		The USFL won that antitrust lawsuit...
As I'm contemplating grading, I'm watching Mid-South Wrestling, as is my Saturday tradition. Bill Watts mentions that Dr. Death Steve Williams has been drafted by the USFL's New Jersey Generals.		The USFL was the most successful outdoor alterative to the NFL running from 83-85.

Yes, the plot of this film is so cookie-cutter that you could well-expect to receive gingerbread Brian Mays from your aunt at Christmas, and that's a valid criticism, but hoping to use someone who clearly wanted to keep that part of their life private as a representational
However, his Queerness was NOT the most fascinating thing about him, and calls for a film to focus on his gay relationships or his drug-fueled debauchery are even more reductive than what we got out of this film.

@realDonaldTrump You can tell that this is collusion because of the way that it is. That's pretty neat.
Ainsley says she doesn't feel like her sexuality doesn't diminish her importance in the White House...		... and that's pretty much the last we hear from her as she wound up in Mandyville at the end of the season. Highly important.
And Ainsley, üëâA LAWYERüëà, argues that he's not engaging in sexual harassment even though another woman told him his comments were inappropriate and made her feel uncomfortable.
Usually in Sorkin, whoever gets the last word wins the argument. That's why 3.14 "Night Five" is so gross. Sam makes a lewd comment to Ainsley and then spends the rest of the episode ignoring her U.N. speech concerns in order to make it about how he's not sexist. #TheWestWing

Her friendship with Willow probably would have developed differently as well. Willow is basically a surrogate sister in the first four seasons. Does that role change if Buffy already has a sister?
Today's showcases Dawn busting into Buffy's room to investigate Buffy's scream after Buffy learns Angel is a vampire. It occurs to me that Buffy's personality would likely be very different balancing Slayer duties with her custodial duties.
So #SlayerLit has a little thing they're doing where they insert Dawn into scenes from the first four seasons. Most people hate it "Because Dawn reasons," but they're sadly missing out on an opportunity to engage the material anew. #Buffy #BuffyTheVampireSlayer

I actually really appreciate @secupp's position here.		And long-term she might be right.		But in the short-term, this position enables corruption and allows misery to permeate.		(Also, S.E. Cupp would SO fail at Game of Thrones.) https://t.co/9cdSTx6oAV
So good for @SteveSchmidtSES for finally coming around, but the Republican Party didn't just 'become' this toxic. Schmidt contributed heavily to that and he should acknowledge his role.
@realDonaldTrump winds up being the nuclear bomb that resulted from that. There's a large segment of his supporters who, let's face it, kinda enjoy the misery they've created in others. It feels like justice.
@SteveSchmidtSES is the J. Robert Openheimer of the political landscape, introducing @SarahPalinUSA  to the national stage.		Palin was the splitting of the political atom. For the first time, a politician could subsist wholly on hatred for the other side. No policies needed. https://t.co/JwTvvipwb3

#CuppsWager
Cupp's Wager: If Sara Elizabeth contributes time, rhetoric, money, and votes to the toxic party, she may be able to lower its toxicity. BUT, in the meantime, and in the long-term if she fails, she's increased the power of the party, contributing to the damage they're causing.
Scenario: Sara Elizabeth belongs to a party that she (rightly) feels is toxic. She feels that the party once did represent her values. She also feels that the other major option doesn't represent her values.
I'm not sure if there's already a political science principle about this, so I'll propose 'Cupp's Wager.' Like Pascal's but with stylish glasses. #CuppsWager
