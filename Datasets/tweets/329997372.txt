@DavidHuzzard Wasn’t talking about his height/weight. Was describing a franchise player, a star.
@PVarga I think he’s really overvalued too. But if they sell him they’ll be sending the signal to every player in the league that they’re willing to quit on a team pretty easily. And I’m still sore about the Strasburg shutdown too - I’m not getting into that today...
@PVarga Because the Nats would be pulling the plug on a team that still has plenty of time to compete - and competing is kinda the whole point.
If the Nats are thinking about their future long-term, they should also think about the signal it'd send to future free agents if they trade a Harper-sized player down 7 games with two months left to go and so much baseball left to play.

Let’s goooooooo UMBC.
Heels beat Duke twice and played hard all year. Most of these players have also been a part of one the best runs in the history of the school. Respect.
Regardless of what happens in the final three minutes of this game that UNC most likely won’t win, this group of players is going down as among the most accomplished and most fun to watch in the school’s history. To Joel Berry and Theo Pinson specifically - Bravo.
This first half - no bueno. C’mon Heels!!

In the past week, I've thanked so many coworkers and friends who made my time here at WAMU so special. It's truly been an honor to work with so many amazing people.
