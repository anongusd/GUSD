Kavanaugh: "I’m not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person at some place at some time. But I’ve never done that to her or to anyone."
Kavanaugh, tearing up, says: "I intend no ill will toward" Christine Blasey Ford. He said his daughter, Eliza, 10 yrs old, said to her mom, "We should pray for the woman."  Said Kavanaugh: "We mean no ill will."
Kavanaugh cites his trial lawyer mother’s advice: “What rings true? What rings false?...”
Kavanaugh: "I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone. Not in high school. Not in college. Ever."

RT @lrozen: Franken asks Clapper, have you appearedd on Russia Today? Clapper: not wittingly. Yates  laughs.
@normative I love Clapper saying that leaking unclassified info is not leaking. That's a 'non-sequitur," he said.
Clapper appeared to confirm that UK intelligence 1st learned of interaction bet Trump advisors &amp; Russian IOs in late 2015, then walked back.
Asked if Gen Flynn lied to VP Pence, Yates said: That's certainly how it appeared.
Yates told WH Counsel of Flynn's risk of blackmail. "It really wouldn't be fair of us to tell you this &amp; expect you to sit on your hands."
Sally Yates speaks publicly for the 1st time about her warning on Flynn: "You don't want your nat sec advisor compromised w the Russians."
Former DNI Clapper said he was not aware of the FBI's counterintel probe of Trump associates' collusion until Comey revealed it in March.
"Unmasking" USP identities is not the same thing as leaking info, former DNI Clapper makes clear.
Ex-DNI Clapper tries to demystify "unmasking." Says in 2016 there were 1,934 requests to unmask US persons' identities--he made several.
Strong words from ex-DNI Clapper on Russian meddling: "If there has ever been a clarion call for vigilance and action..this episode is it."
Sen. Graham forcefully contradicts Trump on DNC hack. "There's no doubt" Russians did it. "Not some 400 pound guy sitting on a bed.”

FBI Dir Comey has gone 3.5 hours so far at this hearing without a break.
Comey added that he was not aware that any of the 12 classified emails got into the hands of anybody who used them to damage natl security.
Comey count on HRC emails found on Weiner laptop: 40,000 found. 3,000 work-related. 12 classified. "We'd seen them all before," he said.
Comey agrees w Sen. Whitehouse that overclassification is a serious problem in the USG.

Comey accuses WikiLeaks of pushing out "intelligence porn"-releasing classified info "to damage the United States of America."
Comey contradicts Trump on DNC hack: "We have high confidence that the Russians did the hacking of the DNC and lots of other organizations.'
Feinstein chided Comey for not notifiying Congress in classified setting, keeping to tradition of not announcing investigations.
