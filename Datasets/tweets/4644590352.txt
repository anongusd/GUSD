@SyedIsVader @oliviaholmes5_ @CaptainWatchdog Yep read the entire thing. Just saying people can take it out of context to justify horrible acts.
@N0tICE_ME_H @oliviaholmes5_ @CaptainWatchdog I am not distorting. I am simply putting forward verses that can be used by an extremist to justify actions. The Quran has a lot of good too
@oliviaholmes5_ @CaptainWatchdog Quran 2:191 - 193... I don't plan to convert so I guess they have the right to kill me according to the Quran. There are many others too.
@oliviaholmes5_ @CaptainWatchdog Have you read the Quran?
@PodcastOne @orobles32 Thank you!
@PodcastOne Fix your new app now! It is frustrating because you click on one show and it takes you to another. Also it stops randomly!
@orobles32 @PodcastOne It's a pain in the ass to download anything. Plus I click on one show and it takes me to another! Very frustrating
