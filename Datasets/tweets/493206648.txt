High Water Everywhere How many people believe the American Dream was just Marketing for Capitalism and was never real to begin with?

High Water Everywhere. How many people know someone who can't get a job they're qualified for because they don't have good credit? How many know someone houseless living with and helping out a struggling family to keep from being homeless?
