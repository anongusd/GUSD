@PlowPlot @HJ4Indie @molliegauthier @NancyPelosi @GerryConnolly @realDonaldTrump Because of Speaker Pelosi, we ACTUALLY HAVE The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. Millions of Americans without health coverage are now getting the health care they need. Speaker Pelosi told Pres. Obama that, if committed to health care, she would push it through-and SHE DID! https://t.co/t8mpHpeXoo

@mmeyerdc @jdorrancfarnham @bannerite @sethmoulton @RepMarciaFudge Agree, contrary to my earlier comments. Stupid to start Dem civil war. Republic in peril, House barely won under Speaker Pelosi's leadership, gangster 'president,' his grifter crime family &amp; minions. No fratricide. Friendly fire ain't. Hope springs eternal. Happy Thanksgiving!
@JusticeRodger @RedTRaccoon @thedailybeast @realDonaldTrump Ah, the old ad hominem attack. If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts.

There's an old expression: "Friendly fire ain't." https://t.co/kX8QUsSLf9
@jbendery @SlythSeeker Bad enough to have a total jerk of a gangster, who: cares only for himself, defames the US daily, is unfit to serve. 'Bonus' is his whole grifter, rag-picker crime family.

@TheSarcasmShow Another Cardassian clone - look it up on Star Trek - famous fer bein' famous. Seems like any ol' tinpot blowhard can be a bloviating, humorless 'conservative' commentator these days. Quite the growth industry - and no shortage of rubes to grease the skids and provide the shekels.
@TheSarcasmShow Yeah, and guess who'd own the roads, not you 'n me, Pilgrim... Already, the Ambassador Bridge from Canada to Detroit is privately owned. I know the zillionaires would love to own all of the infrastructure in the good ol' US of A. Piranhas, all of 'em...
