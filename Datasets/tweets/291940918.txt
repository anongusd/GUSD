@realMattCosta Sure.  Democrats always raise more money than Republicans but even tho she spent almost twice as much in 2016 as Trump she still did not win.   Money given to the Clinton foundation by Russians on Uranium board should be counted as contributions as well. $145 million.
@LawWorksAction If the FBI is corrupt, and it is then Democrats will continue to be above the law.  She destroyed laptops containing evidence of her crimes.  Comey cleared her before he inter    viewed her.
@realMattCosta Hillary raised 1.2 Billion in campaign contributions in 2016. Superpacks were her biggest donations follow by hundreds of donors that gave over $100,000. Trump raised 648 million. $280 million came from donors of $200 or less. Superpacks have to go.

@SenGillibrand @realMattCosta Drugs, mental illness and an entitlement mentality that young people don't have to work but expect us to give them food stamps, health care, housing, cell phones from higher taxes we have to pay for  others to receive for free. Lazy and unwilling to work.
@SenGillibrand @realMattCosta Greed does not make gang members shoot each other.  Greed does not result in people shooting themselves.  Greed does not keep people from working full time and receiving health care paid for by an employer.  High taxes on the working class hurts us all.  Many problems are social.
@SenGillibrand @realMattCosta A great economy solves unaffordable health care.  Policing gangs can solve most of the gun violence.  No gang members have back ground checks.  High percentage of deaths by gun are suicides and gang related shootings.  Great economy fixes people just getting by.
@CNN @CNNOpinion I will never understand how a person can kill a living baby inside their womb.  Protect turtle eggs on Florida beaches unborn as they are but inject a living baby in a mothers womb with no protection.  Unborn Turtles are more valued than unborn children.

@peterzarrella @EAKoyle @ProudResister @FLOTUS If at conception it is taking of innocent human life. If at birth then the baby turning over and kidding mama in her tummy, and strong heart beat is just tissue.
@peterzarrella @EAKoyle @ProudResister @FLOTUS The difference is when does life begin. At conception or at birth.
@peterzarrella @EAKoyle @ProudResister @FLOTUS Murder is murder.  The unborn child is being killed.  Murder is not a right.

Hillaey paid fusion GPS to create lies about her political opponet, the creator of the lies was a Russian ex spy.  Obama used it to get okay to spy and wire tap.
@Nola_11 @EdKrassen This will keep oil prices low for decades to come.  Russia wants oil supply low to drive it back to over 100 dollars a barrel again. Hillary okayed sale of 20% of our Uranium to Russia in exchange for $145 million in contributions to Clinton foundation while she was Sec of State.
@Nola_11 @EdKrassen Be logical.  Russia's economy revolves around the price of oil. Hillary is opposed to any energy producing expansion.  Pipe lines, coal production, drilling in Alaska, off shore drilling.  Oil prices would go up.  Trump compl e ted pipe line, and opens multiple off shore drilling
