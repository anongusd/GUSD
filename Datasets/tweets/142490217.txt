What @SteveScalise told me right after the #SOTU: “I was shocked that so many Democrats sat down when the president called on all of us reject socialism... that’s something they’re going to have trouble explaining to most Americans who love freedom and reject socialism.”
Nearly every GOP statement since SOTU has had “socialism” in it. @nrcc just now on Woodall retirement: "We look forward... to nominating a top-notch Republican candidate who will protect individual freedom and expose the Democratic agenda for what it truly is - socialism."
Full quote: "We'll see what happens but I certainly hear they're working on something, and both sides are moving along. We'll see what happens. We need border security. We have to have it. It's not an option. Let's see what happens."

The @Trump Org has received at least 1650 foreign worker visas since 2001, most for low-skilled temporary foreign labor like cooks, waiters, housekeeping workers, etc.
It's notable that even as @realDonaldTrump has gone after every other type of immigration, the programs his companies use — H1B, H2A and H2B especially — haven't been high on the target list. In fact, this week he's talked about expanding them even as he goes off about illegals.
Even as @realDonaldTrump ratcheted up his anti-immigration efforts in 2018 his family company was bringing in what appears to be a record number of foreign workers for the organization. According to analysis of Labor Dept records, this is the org's most visas since at least 2008

And looking ahead to 2022, TX is expected to pick up 2-3 House seats. You can bet the R's controlling the map are gonna try to retrench their incumbents, and minority growth has fueled the population boom. I'd expect most if not all of these new seats to be drawn for Dems. https://t.co/M0QrRJgNfw
Also, Beto's 2.6-pt loss could very well be the beginning of a new era in TX and not just a particularly strong performance, though I do think Cruz's flaws made this close and are unique to the race. If a Dem seriously puts this in play at the presidential level, all bets are off https://t.co/jgWAz4RlXj
Looking closer at the TX House map, R’s dodged a real bullet. Six won by less than 5pts: Hurd (assuming he hangs on), Marchant, Roy, Carter, McCaul, Olson. Betomania may mean this is Dem high water mark — but some of these seats could be vulnerable in ’20.

After all is said and done, Heller, Donnelly and McCaskill all ended up losing their Senate races by near-identical margins of 5pts — and Cruz came slightly closer to losing than Tester (2.6 pt win vs 3.1pt).

@shripal734 I mean I'm skeptical barring an amazing candidate (NH too). But James is good... And I'd say the same thing about TX for you guys.
I’d bet the 2020 fight for Congress is almost all about the 26-29 Trump-Dem seats, the 3-8 Clinton-GOP seats left, and on the Senate side AL &amp; maybe MN/MI/NH for GOP targets, CO/ME (and maaaybe GA/NC/IA/TX) for Ds. https://t.co/OkadFqPqCP
Even gov races followed this pattern. six of seven Dem pickups were in blue states or ones Trump barely won — Kansas is the only exception. Fell short in Trump-trending IA/OH. Only strong GOP incumbents in MD/VT/MA broke this pattern. https://t.co/OkadFqPqCP
The Senate was a similar story. If Trump won by 5pts or more, the GOP won, except @jontester @JoeManchinWV &amp; @SenSherrodBrown, whose margins were all closer than seemed likely six weeks out. If he lost the state or won by &lt;5%, Dems won or it hasn't been called yet (AZ/FL).
This House will be the most polarized in modern memory. At most, there will be six Democrats in Congress from districts Trump won by double digits (@collinpeterson &amp; 5 new Dems) and at most eight Republicans from districts that Trump lost. Why bother working across the aisle?
There are 20 House districts Trump won by less than five points. Democrats held eight of them before Tuesday — and picked up 10 more, giving them 18 of those 20, the biggest difference in the House fight.
Dems won or are still waiting final results on 22 of the 25 GOP-held Clinton House seats. Of the 42 House seats they flipped or are too close to call, 32 were in districts Trump lost or won by &lt;5%.
Finally had a chance to crunch the #s on exactly how polarized the 2018 election was. Short answer: Incredibly. Dem in seats/states that went to Trump by 5+ pts almost all lost. They won nearly every race in seats/states Trump won. https://t.co/OkadFqPqCP

And just noticing, but it looks like landslide @jontester has finally cracked 50% in an election. 50.1%-47% with all precincts reporting. He’d hit 49% in ’06/’12.
GA-6 wasn't contested in '14 at the House level, but plenty of Gov/Senate action. Total votes were 210K in 2014, 322K (!) this year. Similar dynamic in IL-6. 229K votes in '14, 297K this time.
Everywhere I look, I keep finding eye-popping turnout. Will Hurd barely won in ’14 in an election with under 120K total votes. This time his nail-biter had 208K (!) votes cast. Curbelo’s district went from 160K votes cast to 235K. Both districts hotly contested both years.

@JHagner Yeah I'm not confident about that prediction at all either.
Okay, all 24 prewrites done with 15 minutes to spare before polls start closing! I’ve seen the future, and it includes carpal tunnel.
I've followed Gov races more sporadically, but would put big money on Dems winning IL, MI, NM. Also think they pick up close races in FL, IA, KS, ME, NV, OH, WI. Least confident about KS &amp; OH. GOP wins OK, SD. Who knows in AK.
I wouldn't be surprised to be wrong about AZ, IN and MO, and think TN and MT are the most likely to surprise me in this group. And I'd wager they all tend to break in the same direction.
I feel less confident in my Senate predictions. I'd bet Dems grind out wins in NV, AZ and MT (but like 2-3pt wins, AZ the closest), barely win IN, barely lose MO, come 3-4 points short in TN and TX and lose ND going away. That'd be zero net change.
I bet I'm wrong about a dozen seats, and did this while intentionally not looking at other (better) prognosticators' calls so as to avoid internalizing their thoughts. But that's what I'd guess! Now to look at @Redistrict @nathanlgonzales and @kkondik
These lean a bit more GOP but still very in play, I'd put them in the slight lean category and wouldn't be surprised about any of them: AK-AL (Young), AR-2 (Hill), CA-50 (Hunter),  IL-13 (Davis), OH-12 (Balderson),TX-32 (Hurd), VA-5, WA-3 (Herrera Beutler), WV-3.
I'm giving the GOP the slight edge in these true tossups: FL-15, KY-6 (Barr), GA-6 (Handel) NC-13 (Budd), PA-1 (Fitzpatrick), PA-10 (Perry), TX-7 (Culberson).
True tossups that I'd guess go Dem: CA-10 (Denham), CA-25 (Knight), CA-39, CA-48 (Rohrabacher), FL-26 (Curbelo), IL-14 (Hultgren), MN-1 (currently Dem), NC-9, NJ-3 (MacArthur), NM-2, TX-32 (Sessions), VA-2 (Taylor), VA-7 (Brat). That'd give Dems 37 seats if I'm counting right.
Dem-tilting races: Dem-leaning races: CA-45 (Walters), IL-6 (Roskam),  IA-3 (Young), KS-2, ME-2 (Poliquin), MI-8 (Bishop), NJ-7 (Lance), NY-19 (Faso), NY-22 (Tenney), UT-4 (Love), WA-8
Dem locks for pickups: NJ-2, PA-5, PA-6, PA-17 (Rothfus), AZ-2, CA-49, CO-6 (Coffman), FL-27, IA-1 (Blum), KS-3 (Yoder), MI-11, MN-2 (Lewis), MN-3 (Paulsen), NJ-11, PA-7, VA-10 (Comstock)	GOP locks for pickups: PA-14 (open Lamb), MN-8 (open)

My final House forecast: Dems are near-locks to win 16 seats, GOP to win 2, 3rd a tossup. 10 more races tilt slightly Dem. Just those would get Dems the majority. Then there are a dozen pure tossups, and more than a dozen more tilt R races. https://t.co/WzovhKuDHf

And Menendez up 15 in the final Q poll has to settle some Dem agita as well.

There's been lots of talk this week about whether Steve King might go down. If I were gonna pick a sleeper upset possibility for a congressman who's said controversial things about Mexicans and Jews, I'd pick Don Young: https://t.co/WtUxZiqt4c
Also, Don Young has had so many wild moments over the years that his reportedly pulling a knife on John Boehner and his walrus penis gavel didn't even make it into my copy: https://t.co/WtUxZiqt4c
Of course I had this "Could Don Young lose?" story all reported out and set to go for Monday when the @CLFSuperPAC got concerned about his standing and dropped six figures into calls today. https://t.co/WtUxZiqt4c
“The more outrageous stuff he’s said the more it tends to help him. But this time feels a little bit different,” said AK AFL-CIO head Vince Beltrami, whose union isn't backing Young this time. “I always think Don’s going to pull it out in the end. But this could be the year."
Former Alaska GOP Chairman Peter Goldberg: “It’s certainly closer, and it’s reasonable to expect it to be closer, than it has been at times in the past because he has gotten older."
He hasn't topped 51% of the vote in his last two elections, this time he doesn't have third-party candidates helping to split the anti-Young vote, and the national mood has an impact even in Alaska. He's also been outraised and outspent by a dynamic, young female opponent.
Don Young, the cantankerous dean of the House, may actually be in trouble in Alaska as the House map keeps expanding: https://t.co/WtUxZiqt4c

And thanks to the data gurus and local experts who know this stuff better than me for walking me through all the data: @ElectProject @tbonier @Garrett_Archer @ElectProject @RalstonReports
Again, a lot of this is sussing out conflicting data and some of this relies on modeling. Only thing that's clear is early vote is WAY up over '14, and in states with competitive statewide races voters on both sides are very engaged. But Dems are happier with these #s than Rs.
NV also looking good for Dems — they're building the needed firewall in Clarke County. And while AZ isn't quite as rosy for them, it looks like they've turned the corner the last few days.
Not all clear good news for Dems. FL early vote is looking better than '14 but not a slam dunk for Dems, suggesting the private polls I've heard about showing close races may be more accurate than public polls with Dems up outside MOE.
These numbers have me seriously wondering for the first time since about mid-summer whether @BetoORourke might be able to pull off a huge upset against @tedcruz. And If the current % AA holds in GA (a big if), @staceyabrams might be able to avoid a runoff against @BrianKempGA.
They're most excited about Texas and Georgia, where excitement around O'Rourke and Abrams really does seem to be changing the electorate in beneficial ways for Dems. Who knows if it'll be enough, but there appear to be some big swings in the makeup of the early vote electorates.

So, about those earlier tweets… https://t.co/DLLy7VrFM4
That said, King has barely campaigned — been dark on the air for a while, getting heavily outspent. Also it looks like the top of the ticket is gonna be very strong for Dems in the state this election and competitive in-district. Doubt this materializes... but could be a sleeper.
King's recent internals had him up 18, and even Scholten's own last released internal had him trailing outside the margin. Trump won the district by 27 (though Obama only lost it by 2 in '08).
I've talked to a few plugged in national &amp; Iowa Dems about this internet poll showing @SteveKingIA in a dead heat. No one buys it based on other data points and private #s.

Strategists in both parties aren't sure what the impact will be (and since most campaigns stop their tracking polls a week out, the next clear data set may come on election night). But when Trump's personality is the national focus, GOP #s in other races have dipped in the past.
It's just one data point, but Trump's @gallup approval rating dipped dramatically from the previous week to last week — biggest one-week drop since the family separation crisis.

@LSATtutor @DCRangersFan @instapundit @DeanHeller the state's impossible to poll and public pollsters have often gotten it wrong here. i trust private pollsters more but even they admit it's been extra hard to poll this year, people just aren't answering their phones.
That turnout's extra remarkable since both these candidates aren't exactly all-stars. Dems intentionally found the closest thing to a generic D candidate they could, and Heller's awkward dance with Trump and weaving on Obamacare repeal wasn't exactly graceful.
Early vote has been bonkers so far. “It’s about three-quarters of a presidential turnout. I’ve never seen that before — ever," the gold standard in the silver state, @RalstonReports, tells me.
Both D &amp; R polling has Heller trailing @RosenforNevada, contradicting (mostly garbage) public polling. But the state's always hard to poll, leaving everyone on edge.
The #NVSEN race is far from over, much to Dems’ chagrin. @DeanHeller is still in the fight — and early vote suggests a close finish, though Dems feel more confident than R’s. https://t.co/7DOpYK7rc3

HOW HAVE WE NOT HAD A PUBLIC POLL IN MONTANA IN A MONTH PEOPLE
What I've seen across the map in the last month is a further polarizing electorate with high levels of intensity on both sides. That helps Senate R's on the whole, while it's a mixed bag for the House.
The Senate side is looking a lot better for the GOP than it did before Kavanaugh. Dems' slim chance at the majority looks even slimmer now, and the GOP's hopes for gaining seats look more realistic.   https://t.co/WvKn8Le7rX
With two weeks from the election, Dems remain the favorites to flip the House — but it doesn’t look quite as certain as it did weeks ago. Dems see growing suburban opportunities bu struggles in Trumpy rural districts. https://t.co/WvKn8Le7rX
This strategy isn't new. GOP closed on the message that ebola-infected ISIS members were sneaking across the border in 2014, likely winning them #NCSEN and #AKSEN. And Trump in '16, obvi. But it stalled out in #VAGOV &amp; #PA18 in the past year. https://t.co/5CLheWEJ9R
And both D's &amp; R's say it's drawing blood, at least in red states. Evidence it is: @JoeforIndiana having to go up with his own ads disavowing "abolish ICE."
This GOP strategy has been on display in a few races for months, but has really surged in recent weeks as @realDonaldTrump has fear-mongered about left wing mobs and the caravan.
The most charged GOP ad I've seen was from @NRCC in #MN01: "Prima donna athletes protesting our anthem. Left-wing mobs paid to riot in the streets. Billionaire George Soros bankrolls the resistance — and Dan Feehan." https://t.co/cKbCVJI95M
This is happening all across the map, mainly but not only in red states and districts. Places where this is at least partly driving GOP ad strategy: red states like #INSEN #NDSEN #MTSEN #MOSEN as well as purpler ones like #NVSEN #AZSEN.
House &amp; Senate R's are following @realDonaldTrump's lead in key races, leaning hard into the culture wars with controversial ads on sanctuary cities, George Soros and the "liberal mob": https://t.co/5CLheWEJ9R

Here's my full recap of the race: https://t.co/MEkQI2iDyA
I honestly wonder, though, how effective Madigan attacks will be in Chicago when every single GOP ad in the state (inc. the zillions Rauner is running) are about Madigan. Diminishing returns. Everyone hates Madigan, even Dems, but they hate Rauner just as much and Trump more.
The @CLFSuperPAC is up with a new spot hitting @SeanCasten in #IL06, which I just got back from: https://t.co/R1lmaUZJxl 	Goes after his business record and calls him a "Madigan-machine politician."
The district is the heart of the anti-Trump suburban clapback — swung 15pts (Romney won it by 8, Trump lost by 7). Even knowing that, I was surprised how many former R's I ran into who were furious with Trump and backing Casten because of it — most of them women.
Roskam headed the tax subcommittee on Ways &amp; Means and was intimately involved in crafting and pitching the law. If he can't sell the law (and he clearly doesn't think it's the best use of his campaign resources), I'm not sure who can.
@peterroskam hasn't run a single TV ad on the issue, but @SeanCasten is up hammering him over the law, which is underwater in most national polls and seems to be especially unhelpful in suburban districts like Roskam's that have high state and local taxes.
When the GOP tax plan became law, one of its authors promised it'd be a central part of his campaign. It is — because his opponent is raising it. https://t.co/MEkQI2iDyA

Everyone expects a squeaker of a race. And Donnelly's independent brand seems to be holding up with a fair amount of voters — at least for now. Even R's admit he's likeable. @SusanBrooksIN: "Everyone acknowledges that he is a nice man and he is an incredibly hard worker."
At the same time, while national R's crow about Kavanaugh being a silver bullet (and @mike_pence was happy to blast him on it), local R's not so sure. Notably, @braun4indiana didn't even mention it in his Saturday morning speech introducing Pence.
Donnelly's rather tortured response when I asked him about the Kavanaugh vote was telling: “I stood strong with President Trump to say look, I would be more than happy to find you another nominee who can serve.”

Everyone's talking about #FLGOV as the most racially tense and polarized gov race in the country. I think #GAGOV takes the cake. And I'm not sure I've seen a race anywhere in the country where the two candidates have such obvious disdain for one another. https://t.co/ymICa6odno
Abrams, unlike past GA Dems, is running as a strong progressive and not shying away from discussing issues of race in her campaign. Her model for winning is to turn out huge numbers of young and minority voters — many of whom she's helped register over the years. https://t.co/rKEwvM2nqS
Kemp has been involved with multiple investigations of voting rights groups over his years in office. Many have done great damage to the groups and people he's investigated. Basically none have ended in guilty verdicts. https://t.co/JHrstEQ7rU
Kemp and Abrams have been warring for years — especially during 2014, when he launched an investigation into her voter registration group for fraud (it didn't yield much) and she took him to court for not putting new voters on the rolls. https://t.co/EaavTRBTtA
Since he became secretary of state (and even before), Kemp has been one of the most aggressive anti-voting rights Republicans in the country, a number of civil rights leaders tell me. https://t.co/hc5T0ZDZZR

More interested in how Collins/Flake/Murkowski are feeling about this. https://t.co/eSGVgp1MzD
Kavanaugh says he’s never passed out from drinking. His good buddy Mark Judge from his memoir: 	“Do you know Bart O’Kavanaugh?”	“Yeah. He’s around here somewhere.”	“I heard he puked in someone’s car the other night.”	“Yeah. He passed out on his way back from a party.”
“You’re interviewing me. You’re interviewing me. I’m sorry to interrupt…” Kavanaugh butts in with soft-spoken @SenFeinstein. If he’s gonna be this hair-trigger, can’t wait to see how he handles former prosecutors like @KamalaHarris or @SenAmyKlobuchar.

RT @evale72: The woman he is talking about thought the yearbook comment was about sex and withdrew her support from him
Kavanaugh: “Our yearbook was a disaster… this past week my friends and I have cringed when we read about it and talked to each other."
Kavanaugh: “I liked beer. I still like beer. But I never drank beer to the point of blacking out, and I never sexually assaulted anyone."
RT @blakehounshell: Kavanaugh is trying to contrast his detailed memory with Ford’s hazy recollections.
"Dr. Ford did not attend" one of the Catholic girls schools whose students he hung out with, Kavanaugh said. "She and I did not travel in the same social circles."
Kavanaugh chokes up when talking about his daughter telling another daughter “We should pray for the woman.” Long pause to collect himself after saying “We mean no ill will."
Kavanaugh blames “Revenge on behalf of the Clintons.” This sounds almost like Trump wrote it.
Right but it’s at least as important if not moreso for him to convince wavering Senate Republicans worried about the optics (and potentially the truth) as Trump. https://t.co/F6zvThvLwa
An angry Kavanaugh attacks the committee Dems: “You have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy."
The optics of Kavanaugh yelling his opening statement are not going to help him here.
Does @JohnCornyn believe Mike Judge? "Well, he testified under penalty of perjury. That’s all I can tell you.” Does he believe Ford, also under oath? "Without any corroboration I don’t think she can meet the burden of actually establishing what she claims happened." https://t.co/N2aw2EYLjv

Gasps and incredulous laughter in the #Kavanaugh overflow room as @ChuckGrassley tells @SenAmyKlobuchar “You’ve got what you wanted, I thought you’d be satisfied"
Ford says “basic memory functions” make her positive it was Brett Kavanaugh. The psych professor into the neuroscience of memory formation. “Absolutely not” a case of mistaken identity.
Ford says she’s suffered from “anxiety, phobia and PTSD-like symptoms… more specifically claustrophobia.” Says in the four years after the event “I struggled academically” and socially in college.
You could hear a pin drop for the entirety of the time Ford made her testimony, including as she just spent a minute reading her letter. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a crowd so rapt — anywhere.
Clearly a big optical improvement over having Grassley and the other (mostly) old men on the committee question her directly. https://t.co/jTXiSrCuXI

@PoliticsReid Yup. Think it's a strong piece. Just was puzzled that this tweet suggested Mitch has overseen a shrinking, not growing, city.
@PoliticsReid Not disputing that. But Mitch's legacy is of a growing city that has some gentrification (and resulting tensions) not of a shrinking one. His father dealt with white flight. He dealt with the opposite. His time in office bucked the long trend.
Kinda worth noting the impact Katrina had here, no? And the fact that New Orleans actually grew significantly (and got whiter I believe) in Mitch's eight years in office? https://t.co/T6rN9KWt6w
