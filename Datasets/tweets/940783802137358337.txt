In case you ever wondered what the Romans felt like as their once greT empire crumbled read tweets from the Pagliaccio Of The United States.  When I was in elementary school I probably aspired to become the president.  I certainly didn’t have @realDonaldTrump in mind
@realDonaldTrump You can’t really be that ignorant.  Only native Americans or children of the original colonies would qualify.  I f you can remove the fourteenth amendment with an executive order what’s to stop you from removing the second amendment?  #2A. Answer:  a well regulated militia
@GOP what do youstand for today?  Good Old Prejudices or “Get off my lawn!” People?
@SarahPalinUSA I’m predicting that if an executive order to remove our second amendment rights.  #2A
@nanacmm @realDonaldTrump @PRyan @SpeakerRyan #2A cannot be removed by executive order Pagliaccio of theUnited States is what #POTUS represents now.  I can’t believe that the @GOP stands for Grand Old Party anymore.  Good Old Prejudices or “ Get Off Of my lawn “ People is more appropriate now.

One thing about @realDonaldTrump is that he says what’s on his mind.  His late night tweets are an insight into what ‘s keeping him up at night. I present my favorite quote from Pagliaccio Of The United States #POTUS  “Puerto Rico is an island surrounded by water,a lot of water .
