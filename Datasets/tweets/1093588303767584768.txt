@RepJuanVargas Also we are no longer supposed to call it an "occupation" or "occupied territories" -  see @walshfreedom for details
@RepJuanVargas Also if anyone asks you about Bibi's indictment for bribery - make sure to say that you're withholding judgement until the facts come in, which we expect to be sometime AFTER the election"
@RepJuanVargas Dude - did you not get this morning's talking points? We're now supposed to say that "No one is saying @IlhanMN can't criticize US policy on Israel, only that she's intentionally being anti-Semitic all the time no matter what." This is why you have to join in the conference calls

@KevinMKruse Dude you weren't supposed to fact check. Totally lame. Let me explain it again: 	We say something that our base wants to believe and then we bash you for it. 	Then you say something your base wants to believe and you bash us. 	Let's work together ok? Fact checking ruins it for us
@jpodhoretz I read it as he knew the FOX brand was aimed at the NFL audience. That's why to help qualify his brand, he got the NFL for his broadcast network. When Mayer says the "3 networks" she was referring to the news operations of NBC, CBS, and ABC, which he'd go after with Fox News
@JKDAnthony10 @brianstelter We did consider that and then remembered the POTUS can't spell "hamburger" or "smoking" and can't go 5 minutes with taking credit for even the slightest mundane accomplishment (Like getting 1,000 hamberders for the Clemson Football Team).
@brianstelter John Huntsman  Jr. or Murder on the Orient Express
@natehen22 @eiregirl58 @WalshFreedom And finally, as Jim Jefferies pointed out, who or what are you doing that has people looking to murder you? Most likely, you are like 99% of the pro-gun guys - you just like guns. This law change in Kentucky does not affect your ability to collect and shoot guns at all.
@natehen22 @eiregirl58 @WalshFreedom With all due respect, the purpose of rescinding the training requirement is simply to prove unquestioned obedience to the NRA. This change in law won't make you safer but it will make it easier for nut jobs to avoid any level of scrutiny.
@natehen22 @eiregirl58 @WalshFreedom I'm dodging the issue? The issue is that Kentucky's NRA-enslaved pols are rescinding the one qualification for concealed carry: state-police certified training that you can get at any number of gun stores. Are you saying you wouldn't be able to pass that training?
@CamEdwards Wait - false alarm! It was just his router. He unplugged, waited ten seconds, and and plugged it back in. Everythings fine - he's getting 2-day shipping and operation "they'll remember me now" is back on track! #GodBlessAmerica
@CamEdwards Quick! there's some disheveled lunatic muttering something about "a list" who's being given the slightest bit of scrutiny over his online purchase of a Mark 12, a M&amp;P15-22, a Kevlar vest, and 1,000 rounds of ammo! If he doesn't get these by Thursday the republic will fall!
@brianstelter Serious question: what is the probability of this changing the president's Republican approval numbers?  0% ? 1% ?
@ChuckWendig you're being way too charitable re the "last ten years"
@AndrewSnell2019 @MichaelAvenatti So are you saying their parents won't hire a PR firm and lawyers a la the Covington Catholic kid?
@MichaelAvenatti Didn't you learn your lesson with the Covington Catholic kids? The swastika cup arrangement walked into the middle of these kids!  A handful of black people were yelling at them just off camera!
@BretStephensNYT Meh. This is just the worst scandal of the morning.... but he's probably not even out of bed yet, so maybe I should wait before declaring that.
@HoarseWisperer @tedcruz @marcorubio @JohnKasich @JebBush @ChrisChristie @ScottWalker @RandPaul "Well its been so long now... our pride and self-respect are long gone... now its just something we deserve.

@jonathanchait Over the next 5 weeks I predict we will get a lot more "Israel is under attack from Muslims and anti-Semites INSIDE the US Congress! Now more than ever we need Bibi! Never mind his lies, corruption and racist new friends!"
@jonathanchait This all seems like a convenient distraction from Netanyahu's bribery charges and to lay down the marker that anyone who points out his mainstreaming of far-right racists into his coalition before this election will be shouted down as anti-Semitic.
@jonathanchait Please point to her statements where she insists any support of Israel is "dual loyalty" She does imply AIPAC et al have outsized influence within both parties to quickly shut down any public criticism of the Israeli gov's policies or leadership. Is that what is anti-Semitic?
@BretStephensNYT @IlhanMN You are right. You don't expect her to publicly make a loyalty pledge to Israel. But you do expect her to sit silently and accept the Democratic leadership decision to be passive and willfully blind to the far right takeover of the Israeli government. Doesn't she know her place?
@natehen22 @eiregirl58 @WalshFreedom Some of the bullets Mr. Spencer fired ended up lodged in my neighbor's front porch. My friend's kids were walking home from a school event.  If they had been 1 block closer they could have been hit in the crossfire. All these stupid teens wanted was money. You can replace that..
@natehen22 @eiregirl58 @WalshFreedom I would give him my wallet and live to file a police report.  I understand that you think the brave/responsible thing to do would be to brandish a firearm, but in the moment - especially without the proper training - you won't be as ready as you think you will be.
@natehen22 @eiregirl58 @WalshFreedom dude on my street was robbed at gunpoint.  he pulled his gun and they shot him. he died on the pavement. He did manage to get a couple of shots off...  They just wanted money. Totally Worth it - gun definitely saved his life... https://t.co/c64IMLVvvf
@ThomasSowell ðŸ™„because they know charter schools are often shameless cynical grifts run by shameless cynical grifters like De Vos.   (I thought you were supposed to be super smart.  You could have looked this one up yourself)
@mattyglesias Right now the "sensitivities" seem so open ended as to not only preclude any criticism Israel's leaders and their political approach to our own politics, but to allow equally vicious recriminations and character attacks on anyone (particularly Muslim women), who dares to do so
@mattyglesias I agree with your first point, and can follow your second. But it would be tremendously helpful for those that want such stringent policing to explicitly outline the language that is acceptable for criticizing Israel's chosen leaders, govt, and policies
@thedailybeast Um... they've been fully embracing nationalism and bigotry of every stripe from the beginning ... how is this news?
@nytdavidbrooks You should know. You've been re-centering the Republican Party's descent into intellectual dishonesty and corruption your entire career. Trump is the natural outcome of the center-right media not holding Republican politicians to any standard of honesty.
@jonathanchait "itâ€™s certainly true that many Israel hawks do label criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic without a good basis to do so. There should be more space in American politics to advocate criticism of Israel and support for Palestinian rights."  AGREED
@thehill What if they think they're above the law because a bunch of cynical toadying cowards in the U.S. Senate have pledged total loyalty to them instead of the nation and constitution they swore to defend? Could they possibly write checks then?
@jessesingal @DavidAFrench @mattyglesias @jonathanchait @katrosenfield The most troubling thing about this is that "Kosovo Jackson" is an awesome nom de plume.  Can't we get a "problematic exemption" so that at least that name can continue on?
@joeblow17936880 @jessesingal @benshapiro Where do you go to school?
@CNBC "Secretary Mnuchin stated that after he and Secretary Ross had received their $14,000,000 and $28,000,000 refunds, respectively, the average refund in their for members of their country club was now $3,000"
which gets back to what @jessesingal wonders - where it starts to be bleed into real life, as it is in YA fiction, it could be an actual problem. However, it still feels like to me that these idiots could just as easily be ignored. After all, they are shooting at themselves
IMHO, I've worked and lived in many different workplaces and communities and for 99% of real life, I see people of all stripes getting along. They may disagree -some don't like each other - but they get along. The whole "leftist takeover" to me is a political foil that falls flat
But to be fair, I am sure there are "worse" businesses or worse industries than others, just like there are probably tons of workplaces where being a openly gay or even a women would be hell.  (like female firefighters in the forest service)
I'm awake - I just don't elect to be alarmed about what I view to be politically motivated crises. If James Demore is the canary in the coal mine for you, so be it. To me he's just another entitled arrogant twit who got over his skis with the delusion of his own importance.
@ashleyshaneb @Robot_Bastard @Edward_Carney @harshpathos @jessesingal Don't forget  - Harry Potter was also orphaned and disfigured - J.K. Rowlings knows none of that pain, and yet she felt entitled to write about it anyway ðŸ˜¢
@joeblow17936880 @jessesingal @benshapiro If I was you I would transfer immediately. There are literally thousands of schools where you won't have to deal with that silliness. Vote with your feet! (also, record the class and put it online - the university would be horrified by the bad press)
@elantrian7382 @jessesingal @benshapiro Most workplaces have too much diversity of political opinion to be overtaken by a self-appointed group of powerless and feckless extremists. YA lit is an oddly specific arena, but it makes sense that this particular culture would be unusually susceptible to this nonsense
@joeblow17936880 @jessesingal @benshapiro These people are as easy to ignore as every other interest group on campus: first-time libertarians, country club young republicans, etc) They have no more individual power than any of us. But they sure are useful as a foil for our own political agendas!
@jessesingal talk about a circular firing squad... but to your point, if actual young adult readers don't even know these folks exist, why do the publishers even care what they think? Let them all go ahead and indict each other, and the rest of us will go on with our day.
@Robot_Bastard @Edward_Carney @harshpathos @jessesingal Thanks for reminding us of how problematic Harry Potter is. They should really cancel that series too before it can cause real damage.

@JerylBier @bradheath She was responding to people she believed to be disingenuous with their criticism.  They were going to attack her regardless, so she wasn't going to dignify their nitpicking as legit criticism. I agree that she should be held to a higher standard of truth than a grifter like Wohl
@JerylBier @bradheath AOC was addressing those who intentionally lose sight of the forest from the trees to declare your larger argument illegitimate. Honest people may occasionally get some facts wrong, they may use the wrong wording; but to dismiss an otherwise moral argument as dishonest is wrong.
@WalshFreedom Would you at least agree that 1) we can afford universal health insurance coverage 2) we can afford to make a quality college education affordable; 3) And that while addressing climate change will require sacrifice, the alternative of doing nothing is much worse?
@CNBC "The president's lawyers argue the framers did not intend to ban payments in exchange for services such as hotel stays." 		Uh-oh- I hope there aren't any strict originalists on the court! That could be awkward if that was actually a thing and not some empty right-wing trope

@SykesCharlie But what if he is in fact is a homophobic bigot? Are you saying that as long as he invokes his Catholicism as the rationale of his bigotry, that aspect of his jurisprudence should be shielded from scrutiny? Are we obligated to giving him a lifetime appointment before we find out?
@SykesCharlie @gabeschoenfeld @BulwarkOnline What's that expression? something about candies and nuts?  never mind -  its not important...
@jcoff316 @DanielDenvir I 100% agree with you - but first we have to win the elections. All I am saying is being aware of  your surroundings is a good thing. Since my primary is in May, its all but done by the time I get to vote. I just want an electable nominee who is principled and effective.
@BarxBarl @jcoff316 @DanielDenvir I do think better things are possible - that's the point. But it will take everyone from the center and the left to make progress. I just don't think defining centrists as the enemy will make the job easier.
@LKNavy @sedallas @rkh1376 @Soulman978 @IlhanMN I agree - that's why all corporate boards are filled with CEO's. They set the market and most of the investor class is fine with the $100,000,000 she got paid to drive HP into irrelevance. All I'm saying is that she didn't get that $ because she was good at her job.
@online_nobody @jcoff316 @DanielDenvir Fair enough and good luck.  I hope you win and the special interests that exert their influence are vanquished.
@jcoff316 @DanielDenvir in reality anyone, regardless of their ideological position or tactical approach can be co-opted. For example, Trump's mega-donor team doesn't care why you didn't vote for Hilary  - just that you didn't vote for her.    2/2
@jcoff316 @DanielDenvir They don't run the table - they own it. They just begrudgingly let politicians sit at it. I take no joy in that assessment - I'm just saying the incremental improvement is preferable to none. Certainly centrists are vulnerable to  being co-opted - some clearly are... but   1/2
@sedallas @rkh1376 @Soulman978 @LKNavy @IlhanMN Man! you continue to totally own me!  Anyway - no, I just saw your response - but regardless you are on fire with that wit! Congrats! Total hat tip for putting me in my place.  I needed that.
@jcoff316 @DanielDenvir I am a democratic centrist voter.  I do not care or advocate for mega donor profits, but I do realize that no matter what, mega donors will be at the table and will always exert their influence as best they can. Recognizing power dynamics is pragmatism.
@sedallas @rkh1376 @Soulman978 @LKNavy @IlhanMN Thx for pointing out the number of followers - great burn! 		She may be smarter than 99% of low/medium skilled workers, although 99% is a bit high. That alone shouldn't entitle her to a rigged pay package completely divorced from the actual value of her performance in her job.
@DineshDSouza So to be clear, as editor of the paper, a student presents to you a racist satire piece, you review it, you clear it, you publish it - but you didn't write it. Got it.

@SenatorCollins Your words mean nothing because your actions always betray them. You must really know something about the gullibility of your constituents that the rest of us cannot grasp.
@SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline They will cross the red line. Again.
@RichLowry But not as much Russia, or the latent racism and bigotry that is nurtured and condoned within the upper apparatus of the R party's intellectual and political leadership, but that goes without saying, I guess is your point
@sedallas @rkh1376 @Soulman978 @LKNavy @IlhanMN There are tons of mediocre to incompetent CEO's that take away with 8 figure salaries all the while running their company into the ground. (Jeffrey Immelt, Carly Fiorina, Marcelo Claure, etc). Both the good and the bad make the same ridiculous money.
@WalshFreedom TFW when you realize you can't make the argument that the R's stand for anything remotely like fiscal responsibility and you have to go all in on  #BothSides!
@SenToomey And especially, mostly, in the hands of the 1% -as promised, as designed, as directed
@RealSaavedra "I just see dis-empowered, marginalized workers that can be exploited for profit"
@RichLowry I like the R's plan for addressing climate change: tax-sheltered off-shore REITs to buy up higher-ground real estate to gouge the nation as we are forced to move inland. Ask Rich for a prospectus the next time you see him at the club. He's says we'll clean up.
@RadioFreeTom Kinda like how AIPAC can smear shame anyone who dares criticize it or its policy agenda? Askin' for a friend...
@jkcarnah @IlhanMN Yet you don't reject anti-Semitism in your own home. Here is the chance for you to lead boldly. Set the example and resign.
@ByronYork Whose tax returns would the R's have subpoenaed? Did you ask?  What are the names of the politicians?
@soledadobrien Looks like I better cancel my subscription to Privileged White Male Mag - err Esquire....
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump You know this tweet makes you an anti-Semite right? Wait - your not a Muslim woman? OK, you can probably say it.
@RichLowry Rich, since you are such as stickler for honesty: Yes or No: did the IRS, as per the tax bill,  adjust withholdings to make people think they were saving money on taxes in their weekly paycheck when really they were just getting their refund early? You'd answer honestly - right?

@ChrisVanHollen I wish we as Democrats felt as impassioned about the right of children born in Palestine to have a future beyond occupation as we do about condemning vague comments about AIPAC's lobbying efforts, but I guess that would make me anti-Semitic.

@EWErickson So much dishonesty in this post. Are there really any thoughtful conservatives left, or are they all grifters?
@nytopinion @SteveRattner Once again sober-minded centrist Dems explain how we have to take one for the team and clean up the mess created by the massive right-wing tax frauds.  As if the goal posts won't just get moved again. FDR and LBJ just did the effing work instead of just meekly giving up
@bariweiss Here's another hateful anti-Semite claiming AIPAC spends money to lobby the U.S. Congress! Everyone knows AIPAC never NEVER EVER spends money in U.S. politics.  LIES!!! The Post's anti-Semitic hate speech is unacceptable! https://t.co/jTG0cVwifP
