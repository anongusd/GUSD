@renato_mariotti @RalphNortham Does it matter? They're both heinous, and he knows that. To claim one costume over the other doesn't make his situation better, and by implication, throws the other guy straight under the bus. They're both culpable to the same degree.
@BobHarryD @TheRickWilson 100%. I grew up up north where there were literally no people of color in our whole town, so moving to the south was rather a shock at the systemic racism everywhere. I judged them, but still had no idea what I myself had internalized w/ my own family's attitude about POC.
@rdelevan @Mark55____ @TheRickWilson Ding ding I bet you're right about this.
@BobHarryD @TheRickWilson Ralph Northam isn't that much older than me, and he might also be grappling with a clueless or racist past. I do hope, if so, he gives a complete mea culpa about it, and...it could be a HUGE teaching moment for many many white southerners who choose to listen with open ears.
@BobHarryD @TheRickWilson job that I didn't even know I didn't know, but it STILL wasn't enough. It's taken me all of the Obama years and these last two more to have it hit home just how offensive our thought processes were all our lives. 		Racists can change if they want to. 2/2
@BobHarryD @TheRickWilson In the 80s, I told a bunch of black co-workers that I had sung many "Ne*** Spirituals" in college and they were gobsmacked that I used that word. Then they were even MORE gobsmacked that I didn't realize it was offensive. I learned a LOT about bias and systemic racism at that 1/2
@RockShrimp @TheRickWilson HAHA SERIOUSLY. 		We went to a gun show last year where some racist bitch was campaigning for Corey and I overheard her say something about climate change being fake and I wanted to stomp her.
@RockShrimp @TheRickWilson I love Ralph Northam, but he's not my governor, so my opinion doesn't matter; I agree Fairfax would be great. I also feel that mayyyyybe Ralph could keep going if he gave a full and sincere apology and explanation, but I'm not a person of color, so it's not up to me.
@BobHarryD @TheRickWilson Sigh. No.		My ex f-i-l has a Civil War tribute musuem THAT HE BUILT HIMSELF in his back yard. In the 70 and 80s, he participated in Civil War reenactment shoots where they proudly wore the uniform of the Southampton Grays. The racism in rural white areas around here is a given.

@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber NO HE WON'T OVER MY FUCKING DEAD BODYYYYYYY		The world IS fucked up, tho, I'll give you that, but I just have to be positive that he won't do a 2nd term or I'll just give up. 		Here, look at this positive post to cheer u up: https://t.co/23FqwBUjMJ
@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber My husband does that but I don't have the patience for stupid people.
@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber Yeah, I don't miss most of them either. 		Sighhhhh....I hope when the Trump era is over we can go back to our hobbies etc. I'm exhausted from being anxious all the time.
@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber Also, since a lot of them actually use their real names on their FB profile, they can't freely complain about Trump w/o fear of losing their jobs, or something, so they all just ignore me now. Because I NEVER stop complaining about trump.
@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber Lol same! Too many Bernie supporters in my friends list.
@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber True. I'm on Twitter more than I watch tv.
@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber I'm sick of all those decorating shows...they're completely unrealistic. I suppose that's why we gravitated towards MSNBC ... that and the news is breaking all day every day, now, so, I kinda just turn it on and leave it on.

@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber Me too. It is like, OH SHIT, that was only 5 miles from here!! Lol
@Phucktrumpny @GenStasia @madbadthoughts_ @theori @PhotosByBeanz @PUSHA_T @AriMelber They did another series that took place not far from here, and you'd think THAT would have held my interest, but it was just too boring to get through the first episode.		While looking it up, I just realized the show is called Killing Fields!! Oops!
@LOLGOP The disconnect from reality might be the hardest thing to take about this era. MSM somehow feels obligated to act like this gaslighting is just politics as usual and it's nuts.

@LisaSeaFL @xtrixcyclex I'm so grateful my sisters also escaped [although one is still in the church, just not in the cult of trumpism] and we all hold each other up. But our relationship w/ our mother is a sham. That's the hardest part, tbh. I don't really miss my friends but mom is just a mystery.
@LisaSeaFL @xtrixcyclex Exactly.
@LisaSeaFL @xtrixcyclex I find it just tragic. I had to move on rather than try to convince any of them and I really had a lot of good friends in church. I wasn't strong enough until recently to do any convincing, regardless.
@godivademaus @xtrixcyclex @C_Stroop Oh, and Stroop has a lot of insight into the current evangelical fascination with Putin, relating to authoritarianism, that will interest you.
@godivademaus @xtrixcyclex I highly recommend following the exvangelical twitter folk, particularly @C_Stroop. His personal and professional experience, research and approach to current events is invaluable.
@LisaSeaFL @xtrixcyclex Yes, it's so strange to me, too. 		Honestly, the biggest factor that drove the exponential growth of bigotry is media, specifically talk radio, cable entertainment and the internet. Before those inventions, bigotry was much more pocketed and hidden.
@LisaSeaFL @xtrixcyclex My sister is dating a lesbian woman who is recently out of the mormon church; they are ALSO male-centric, and the women are raised to never ever see themselves as equals. A desire/need/love for authoritarianism is a HUGE factor in all these groups who vote for trump.
@godivademaus @xtrixcyclex alrighty carry on
@godivademaus @xtrixcyclex TBH, I never thought of fundamentals as being evangelical at all..it wasn't until the trump era that they all started glomming together as a political movement as the larger whole.
@godivademaus @xtrixcyclex Yes, that's true...the evangelicals I knew, and I was, wasn't afraid of women being in charge or felt that brown people were SERIOUSLY inferior, so skin color wasn't an issue on the surface. The fundies were the skinhead types. But homosexuality and abortion are still problematic
@xtrixcyclex the ones in the south truly feel, although, they definitely are racists down to the bone. They just don't realize how racism manifests itself. 		In the trump era, evangelicalism has managed to glom onto many of the other bigoted subsets of humanity but they don't always align. /x
@xtrixcyclex ..these cultural territories, to us humanists, then they have allowed satan permission to run the world, and because of that THEY will be judged by god. 		The civil war era resentment against brown people isn't something that northern or western or any other evangelicals than 3/?
@xtrixcyclex cultural, in that, they are trying to control the cultural narrative, and no, it's not in their bible that brown people are in charge, nor that women are equal, or that men can love other men or that women can decide not to be baby factories. If the cede these territories 2/oops
@xtrixcyclex I'm a former evangelical, worked at CBN for 15 years. 		It's true: evangelicals feel as if they don't belong, but not because of the civil war, but because the scripture commands them to "be IN the world, but not OF the world". 		The civil war they are fighting now is 		1/2
