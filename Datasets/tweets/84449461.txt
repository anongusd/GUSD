We’re here to help you impress your friends! These are the top three stories to read this week:  https://t.co/sA03VddSca #OpportunityZones #health #housing https://t.co/iNB06LA6i2
The most important economic development asset is talent. If you've got a large-scale way to produce marketable skills in a neighborhood, the chances you can attract an employer to invest in a neighborhood rise dramatically. -@LISCMaurice #PlaceBased https://t.co/umaRHVqWSH
[Job training programs] should have an individual walk away with a skill and a credential, and the ability to build wealth. -@LISCMaurice #PlaceBased https://t.co/kwI7Jl8xj4
Real opportunity is a system that helps the private sector see an economic incentive to invest alongside the public sector. -@LISCMaurice #PlaceBased https://t.co/FUPK4XLa3S
#placebased
We sit around dreaming of systems that are so perfect that people don't have to be good, but there is no system like that. People have to be good. We have to get good people in the right places. -@LISCMaurice https://t.co/Mgvgmw99F7
RT @Allie_Policy: How can, or can, federal investments drive local growth? One key point of view is that we can not separate people from pl…
For-Profits play the best role in the apprenticeship space, and non-profits play the best role in the pre-apprenticeship space. The federal government's best role is to bring these two together. -@LISCMaurice #PlaceBased https://t.co/gZaUWZQAnM
The Federal government works best when it creates incentives for the private sector to work with non-profits, says @LISCMaurice #Placebased https://t.co/ZS71FbYaQs
#placebased https://t.co/1vgqHahbdc
Work is only part of the picture. If you can get a mother a job but she can't secure childcare or a way to get to her job, it's not enough. People's lives are complicated. -@LISCMaurice https://t.co/gy9nj9I59l
Just getting a job isn't enough, either. It's important to get a job that leads to a marketable credential or certification that leads to higher wage jobs and careers. -@LISCMaurice #placebased https://t.co/mvssq9yDmO
Just helping folks find work isn't enough. You have to solve transit, housing and education issues. Government, non-profits and private sector can play a role here too, says @LISCMaurice #placebased https://t.co/hzXg9VZZlE
Helping folks find work is a team sport. Non-profits, government and private sector need to cooperate, says @LISCMaurice #placebased https://t.co/U3MLIeUs4O

And we’re excited that leaders from prominent healthcare orgs are joining LISC’s advisory boards, like @Randy_Oostra, CEO of @ProMedicaHealth on @LISC_HQ national board and in San Antonio, Prof. McKieran @UTHealthSA sits on @LISC_SA board. #SaludTues
We need to look at what the data tells us about interconnected health, housing and mobility challenges. Life expectancy maps from @VCU paint a stark picture about differences across neighborhoods that call for action across sectors. #SaludTues https://t.co/C9JdAhkruQ
Let’s learn from successes like the $200 million Healthy Futures Fund, which deployed resources from Morgan Stanley, Kresge Foundation and Dignity Health to support production of housing co-located with health care and services. #SaludTues https://t.co/VSchz0TANo
And in Richmond, VA, we’re working with @BonSecoursRVA to tackle asthma triggers in housing and support small businesses on vital retail corridors. #SaludTues https://t.co/JCy9ljl4fW
In #Toledo, for example, we’re partnering with @ProMedicaHealth to address the connections between health, housing and economic opportunity for residents. #SaludTues https://t.co/4V8wvtnoHL

A baby born in an under-invested neighborhood may live as many as 20 fewer years than a baby born in a more affluent area. Upending all the social determinants of health--which includes more and better affordable housing--is key to closing the life expectancy gap. #SaludTues https://t.co/VFt2fuuuUO

That’s why creating more affordable housing, and preserving what exists, is so important. Federal programs like #LIHTC  and the new #OpportunityZones tax policy are critical in bringing capital to communities where affordable housing is in high demand. #SaludTues
Gentrification, speculation and a lack of affordable apartments in hot markets like the SF Bay Area, Boston, &amp; DC has played into the crisis. #SaludTues
More recently, the affordability crisis has exploded as part of larger economic shifts. Since the 2008 crisis, many Americans lost the stability of home-ownership and became renters, while rents have increased in much of the country. #SaludTues

@ShelleyHearne Glad to have you Shelley!
LISC builds and preserves homes that will remain affordable, even as market rents rise. It's a critical social determinant of health, and a launch pad to opportunity and growth. We're committed to helping ensure that every American has access to an affordable home. #SaludTues
Being rent-burdened has a direct impact on health: stress from financial instability is linked to chronic disease. Families are forced to choose between paying for housing and food, medical care, education &amp; recreation. No one should have to make those choices. #SaludTues https://t.co/wI5KPNvuCx
A home is one of the basic requisites of life—key to individual well-being, and the foundation for sustainable, vibrant and diverse neighborhoods. "Affordable" means housing costs aren't burdensome—no more than 30% of a family's income. #SaludTues https://t.co/rBhB8B6Ed1 https://t.co/eOYk92E1tu

Get talent prepared in #OpportunityZones and opportunity will come to you says @LISCMaurice, placing his bet on addressing the demand for prepared workers to fill the 16 million jobs needed by 2024 as the key to US economic growth.
How aggressive states and local municipalities market #OpportunityZones will determine who quickly Opportunity Funds are formed and deployed says @LISCMaurice
CEO @LISCMaurice says that #OpportunityZones can be a tool for states like #Maryland and #Virginia to offer a plan for housing and job training in order to attract large companies like @amazon in their search for #HQ2.
On housing, @LISCMaurice says #OpportunityZones are a chance to bring in a whole new group of investors to affordable housing development. If we don't get more investors involved, we'll have a hard time keeping up with the need for affordable housing.
Asked if #OpportunityZones should be expanded to include transportation work, @LISCMaurice says yes, this should be an investment activity and should include things like broadband in #rural areas
"At the state and local level, it would be most helpful to have the state work with the municipalities and private sector to advertise the benefits of #OpportunityZones"  - @LISCMaurice
CEO @LISCMaurice: "This is a focus on equity capital. The exclusive focus on getting more equity in these communities is essential. #OpportunityZones"
@LISCMaurice: "Individual states and municipalities should work with private sector partners to ensure that #OpportunityZones investments provide the most benefit to low-wealth communities and their residents."
@LISCMaurice: Congress should consult closely with the Treasury Department during their next phase of rulemaking to identify whether there are areas that may require statutory fixes to provide clarity to investors and improve the flow of investments into #OpportunityZones.
@LISCMaurice: "we will increase the stock of quality affordable and workforce housing in #OpportunityZones."
@LISCMaurice: "we will invest in new real estate developments and rehabilitation of existing underutilized buildings within targeted communities to attract businesses, bringing quality jobs to underinvested communities and their adjacent neighborhoods." #OpportunityZones
@LISCMaurice: "We will inject equity capital to catalyze the growth of manufacturing, health care, and companies in other growing sectors that are providing quality job opportunities that are accessible to community residents." #OpportunityZones
@LISCMaurice: "It’s because we have seen first-hand the impacts that tax incentives can have on spurring community revitalization, most notably the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and New Markets Tax Credit, that we believe #OpportunityZones hold a great deal of potential."
Right now CEO @LISCMaurice is in front of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress to talk #OpportunityZones. He will be joined by leaders from Enterprise  and the Economic Innovation Group.  Listen to the livestream here: https://t.co/1Y9qoEKWMC

Problems with #TCJA, according to @dashching 	1. 3x income boost for the top 1% vs working class	2. It pays for the tax cuts with cuts to health coverage	3. $1.9 Trillion of revenue lost for the US infrastructure	4. Lots of new loopholes for corporations	#Liveaturban https://t.co/JTX3VYZ8Ao
The results for the #TCJA are "idiosyncratic for individuals," according to #MarkMazur @TaxPolicyCenter https://t.co/1GSMfccAGn
Four tenets of good tax law, according to @jjsahadi 	1. Is it simple enough for people to understand?	2. Does it raise enough money for the government?	3. Is it efficient to implement?	4. Is it equitable?		Does the #TCJA live up to those tenets? 		#LiveAtUrban
