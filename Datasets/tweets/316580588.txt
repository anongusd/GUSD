@JohnKronz John, here's the explanation from @rbruce721 :FYI - whole blood is everything in your system.  Double red cells does not take your white cells and platelets.  Platelets are the stuff minus red/white cells.  Have given 13 gals whole blood over 38 years.
@rbruce721 I agree, and good for you!  13 gallons is represents a LOT of time in the chair!
@DPA_Insight It's Chappaqua, they can afford it!  (And I'm donating the $ to charity anyway...)
@Bulldogrescuer Excellent!  I'm told my AB- blood type is rare and ergo, useful.  AND...on another topic...I told a friend I wanted a bulldog, and she knew someone from the bulldog rescue society.  Which is how I got Winston.  Because it was actually the BOXER rescue society--(he's boxer mix).

"We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama and that's what you get when you get her."  @realDonaldTrump closing line of the debate.
Tonight's best performance in a presidential debate:  Chris Wallace.  Sharp questions and facts at the ready.
So if American voters tell Trump "You're fired!" on Nov. 8th, what exactly will he do?
Trump declines to commit to accept election results; says he'll "take a look at it afterwards."
Hillary praises the Clinton Foundation. No one is questioning the work of the CGF; it's where its money comes from and does the $ buy favor?
Trump blames HRC campaign for stirring up stories from women who accuse him of inappropriate advances.
HRC promises not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250k and says she won't add to the deficit.  Hmmm....
Isn't it hard to believe tonight that he invited her to and she attended his wedding?
Sparks fly  between Trump and HRC over Russian hacking and Wikileaks.
Confronted with speech content released by Wikileaks, HRC turns it to a case of "Russian espionage", "sanctioned...by Putin."
HRC:  "We are a both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws."  If so, why are 15-million immigrants here illegally?
@realDonaldTrump :  Secure the borders first, deport the drug lords and bad illegals, then we'll make a determination about the rest.
@realDonaldTrump "We need strong borders.  She wants to give amnesty, which would be a disaster.  We have no country if we have no border."
Trump is going for it.  Says he'll appoint pro-life justices to SCOTUS.  Hillary answers that she applauds Roe v. Wade.
@realDonaldTrump "Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the country and the most gun violence."
@HillaryClinton says she supports the 2nd amendment.
@realDonaldTrump says he'd appoint pro-life, conservative justices to SCOTUS.
Debate:  HRC wants Merrick Garland confirmed by Senate.  Suggestion is out there that she wants a younger, more liberal appointee.
Topic 1 for final debate:  Supreme Court.
Time to debate!  Tune into Fox News for the final presidential debate at UNLV with Chris Wallace moderating.
Winston is beyond excited about tonight's final pres debate on Fox. We'll watch together from the leather sofa he's destroyed. https://t.co/Z6HIi02GaO

.@HappeningNow: We are bringing you full reaction and analysis from last night’s #debate! Hope you're tuning in..
Who do you think won last night's presidential #debate?
Question:  "Would either of you say anything positive about the other?"  HRC:  "I respect his children."
HRC momentarily pinched her nose while DJT spoke on energy policy.  Can't wait for the freeze frame.
"I want a Supreme Court that will stick w/ marriage equality"--HRC.  Musta really steamed her when Bill signed the Defense of Marriage Act.
@HillaryClinton gives props to Bush43 for his help for NYC after 9/11 attacks.
@realDonaldTrump "She (HRC) has tremendous hate in her heart."
@realDonaldTrump: "He (Pence) and I haven't spoken and I disagree"...(after moderator reminds him Pence suggested targeting Russia in Syria)
HRC:  "Situation in Syria is catastrophic..."  But no mention of the Obama administration's policies (or lack thereof) which owns the chaos.
HRC is wearing a second, white lapel mic.  Trump isn't.  Curious.  For dedicated campaign commercial use, perhaps?
@realDonaldTrump " to HRC: Honest Abe never lied--that's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you."
It's the ultra-subdued @realDonaldTrump who showed up for debate tonight.  Alec Baldwin won't have much to work with on SNL...
HRC admits Obamacare needs overhauling.  "Costs too much, premiums are too high."
HRC:  Good that someone with temperament of @realDonaldTrump won't make it to the White House. @realDonaldTrump "Because you'd be in jail."
@realDonaldTrump says if he wins, he'll have special prosecutor look into @HillaryClinton email situation.  Draws a broad smile from HRC.
