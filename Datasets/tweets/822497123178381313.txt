@DebbieF12381 @ScottCecil @ezraklein Because Trump is President you turn to an addictive doing to help you get thru the day and you think you will be able to stop when he leaves office?  Also, we have tried prohibition. It didn't work so why do you think Trump will take away your drug of choice?
@Cjmorelle @captgmreed @TammyforIL Then why on Earth would you want your friends, family and neighbors, who would be there to protect you, to give up their guns under this administration?
@Cjmorelle @captgmreed @TammyforIL Do you trust the Trump administration?
@HuffPostPol His words were extremely careless and wreckless but he had no intention of breaking the law, therefore no criminal charges will be pressed.
@vocalmajorityus @RichardHyssong @kalerob22 @AnnCoulter He was taken off the case but the fact that these texts happened before and during his time on the investigation opens the door for doubting his decision making abilities.  As I said, it is possible that he did leave his bias at the door, but the optics are different
@vocalmajorityus @RichardHyssong @kalerob22 @AnnCoulter But none of us were investigating Trump. He was and he dropped the ball by using a device that could be searched at any time. He should have kept those texts on his personal device. He is the reason there can be doubt, valid or not, about his actions
@THErealEmmettW @dwolfsedona @kalerob22 @AnnCoulter I watched the hearing and neither side came out looking good. It's possible to set bias aside and do your job. It's also possible he acted on his bias. His mistake was using a government device to express personal opinions. He said he does not have bias, that was an obvious lie
@TheRealGavRoss @time2trade2 @RepRatcliffe No one remembers or cares about the 20 years of solid service, they only care about the 1 time someone drops the ball. He should have been smart enough to voice his personal opinions on his personal device instead of on the govt issues one that can be searched at any time.
@KKStrawn @IngrahamAngle Were the credit cards backed by a Russian bank?  Not all men are weak minded and unable to pay the debt they accrue. How is this compromising?
@IngrahamAngle I don't see in the article where it says he defaulted on the debt. Why is this news?  Had he not paid the debt, that would be news.
@Parrish_Sky @CantLetItbe @CharPinkRibbon @SnarkyGinger1 @TopRopeTravis @Alyssa_Milano Franken stepped down. He should have gone thru the ethics investigation and stayed if he did nothing wrong. I don't know much about the allegations against Jordan, but I don't really care for him. As I said, if he knew more than he is letting on then he should be tossed.
@GinaMoxie @CharPinkRibbon @TopRopeTravis @Alyssa_Milano @RepMaxineWaters @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Trump is not the problem, he is the result of the problem.  The problem is an increasingly divided voter base which has been growing since the 90's. Tribalism will bring is down faster than any one man can.
@CantLetItbe @CharPinkRibbon @SnarkyGinger1 @TopRopeTravis @Alyssa_Milano Roy Moore was scum. Jim Jordan, if the facts back the story should be removed, but do I have to remind you of Anthony Wiener?  For serial cheaters I can think of Bill Clinton and JFK. Please make sure your house is clean before commenting on others.
@perlmutations Everyday for the past 15 years
@AsteadWesley If he sold before the meeting he is fine. If he sold after the meeting he needs to be indicted
@KamalaHarris We desperately need leaders in Washington. You should have stopped there.
@Joe_Gatto How dare you go get healthy and skinny.
@KamalaHarris No one is targeting legal immigrants. Saying Trump is targeting immigrant communities makes you just as guilty of playing politics with immigrant communities.
@KamalaHarris Dreamers should not be used as pawns in a political game they can't win. You are using them to say the GOP hates immigrants. GOP is using them to say you care more about illigal immigrants than US citizens. If a law is passed these lies will stop. Stop the games, pass a bill.
@Evan_McMullin Wouldn't paying for opposition research sourced from Russians also qualify as receiving Russian support?
@thehill Explains a lot. Who wouldn't want the opportunity to deport their in-laws?
@CitizenWonk @morgfair It wasn't his proposal, it came from one of the parents at the meeting. Trump did seem to like it and said it would be discussed. He also said it didn't have to be teachers, it could be a janitor or a cafeteria worker or any other school employee willing to carry.
@AdamBaldwin Teachers are underpaid as it is. To expect them to pay for a weapon, ammo and the extensive training it takes to conceal carry is not right. Teachers need to focus on teaching.
@JohnJHarwood Those must only be the people who gave a yes/no/don't know answer. If you add a 4th option it would be closer to 1% yes, 2% no, 97% don't care.
@MMFlint Wouldn't the FBI holding kushner and jr hostage until Trump resigns for no reason make them the sociopaths?
@KamalaHarris Then they deserve the respect of you and your colleagues doing your job and negotiating a law that will tell them where their future is instead of using them as pawns to make Dems look overly emotional or Reps look like heartless devil's. Do your job and this will be solved
@Slate Either are gun manufacturers or legit gun dealers.
@zmondaine592 @RobFromSac @SoCal1964 @latimes Under oath? 0. Since breakfast too many to count.
@hardball Everyone knows Russia spread propaganda to influence voters. We don't need Trump to admit anything. According to FBI and other intelligence agencies there is no proof of any votes being changed. This doesn't change anything. Trump is still the president until he is impeached.
@NotJetWooKim @SoCal1964 So you had no problem with Bill cheating on his wife in the Oval Office because he was not part of the "Family Values" party?
@RobFromSac @SoCal1964 @zmondaine592 @latimes Last president to be impeached was Bill Clinton who was impeached for lying under oath not cheating on his wife.
@Bisexual420Hex @TayloredSince83 @NBCNews Americans have the right to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness and beer makes me happy so by that makes beer a right.
@Jason_sunset @CNNMoney @maggieNYT No one cares what he does with his fun parts. It's not news that powerful people are not faithful to their significant other.
@ThanFiction @gradearadioAS1 @CNNMoney @maggieNYT @CNN Oh no...Trump cheated on his wife before he ran for office. I am disgusted.  If only he could be more like JFK or Bill Clinton instead of an unfaithful husband.
@TheVicVega @CNNMoney @maggieNYT True. That worked to impeach Clinton.
@CNNMoney @maggieNYT No one recgnizes the national enquirer as a legitimate news source, just a tabloid.
@debra_cork @thehill Will you have that same appreciation if the investigation turns up in Trump's favor?
@moveover4me2 @funder We will have our new election. It is scheduled for 2020.
@_News_Matt @DCSportsRule @latimes If Trump lies about it under oath, like Bill he should be impeached like Bill.  If he paid her off with taxpayer money he should be punished.  Until either of those happen I don't care.
@ACDCABA @StevenTDennis Absolutely not true. Republicans would be screaming for impeachment and Dems would be saying there are no grounds for impeachment. Kind of like what is happening now in reverse.
@cathyAnnSmith2 @Enrique_Acevedo @maggieNYT Don't be confused, none of them are working their asses off. They have had 5 years to make DACA a law and didn't. Both sides want these people as a negotiating tool.
@maryderrickart @thehill He put a bill on the table and the Democrats have not.  How does that make him uninterested in negotiating a bill?
@dylan_forest @Swim_Harder @thehill The court is allowing congress to do what they always do and kick it down the line. This has to stop. DACA is not law. A law needs to be passed in either direction so these recipients will know their fate. We need this congress to do their job.
@RosenzweigP @KieranJGarland @Susan_Hennessey @qjurecic @mattwaxman1 @pwnallthethings @OrinKerr @BobbyChesney Our system didn't just break in 2016. 2016 is a result of disenfranchised voters. The parties put up the only candidate who could have lost to the other.  Different Dem candidate would have beat Trump. Different Republican candidate would have beat Hillary in the popular too
@MMFlint I bet you believe the sunset is nature's way of giving Trump the finger.
@RepPeterDeFazio Here is a crazy idea. Instead of pushing a democratic plan and demonizing the republican plan, how about actually working together and coming up with a plan both parties can accept.
@RandPaul A shut down definitely makes us a weaker country
What did I say? I was blacked out https://t.co/iyQIH2VfKT
@Steve_in_RI @JustAJ_O_B @SarahKSilverman We are pitted against each other by our leaders and the media. They want us fighting with each other so we are to busy to see what they're doing. Notice during any shutdown all "non-essential" people don't get paid but the over paid babies who won't do their job still get a check
@Steve_in_RI @JustAJ_O_B @SarahKSilverman If you keep adding taxes without adjusting where they are spent the tax payers will just keep paying for our public servants to get richer.
@Steve_in_RI @JustAJ_O_B @SarahKSilverman We need to know where our taxes are being spent.  Are they still going to programs that no longer exist? Have they been diverted to something completely different?  If we get the answers to these questions we can direct the taxes we currently pay to education or childcare
@Steve_in_RI @JustAJ_O_B @SarahKSilverman I don't have a problem helping the needy or struggling.  As good human beings it is our responsibility to help get them on their feet. I do have a problem with the few that take advantage of the system.
@Steve_in_RI @JustAJ_O_B @SarahKSilverman You're sadly mistaken if you think pure socialism will work in a country this size. Those are issue that need to be fixed but the solution is somewhere between free and where we are at. Want cheaper college? Get rid of govt subsidized loans.
@Steve_in_RI @JustAJ_O_B @SarahKSilverman And last I checked we already have all the basic services and rights enjoyed by every single other developed nation on Earth plus a few more.
@Steve_in_RI @JustAJ_O_B @SarahKSilverman No, they don't simultaneously stop making money but things do get more expensive when an entire country depends on a few people. The rich will always be driven to be rich but if you start taxing the middle class they slowly disappear leaving the rich with the entire bill
@Steve_in_RI @JustAJ_O_B @SarahKSilverman What happens when the rich who are footing the bill run out of money?
@DJBurn77 @Cernovich Yeah. What a shame. If only Trump could have used Clinton's or Obama's service as an example
@Alyssa_Milano We already have smaller ones on Armed Forces Day.
@LouDobbs I think both memos purposefully leave out key information and are meant to make their base feel warm and fuzzy. Neither memo means anything without the underlying data, which we will never see. The truth lies in the details, not in summaries written by partisan hacks
@Jugbo @nuzzel Who cares?  I'm sure there are hundreds of women who can say the same thing. It doesn't matter.
@Destined00 @vetlife4 @greta My parents got an email from apple care asking for information. The called me and I told them to delete the email. They confirmed with apple it was a scam.
@greta I have been getting that call weekly for the past 3 months. Still haven't been arrested.
@Lee8772 @jasoninthehouse Funny how Russia can't be trusted and are trying to undermine our democracy unless they are speaking out against Trump, in that case they are to be trusted 100%
@MomarHall @jasoninthehouse Which part was a lie?
@fatsodoctor @jasoninthehouse Any elected official?
@delyju @jasoninthehouse About?
@TheRealJPO1 @jasoninthehouse No, our elected officials need to play but the rules of the voter regardless of party
@loudlong @jasoninthehouse Misleading doesn't mean wrong. It could also be used to cast doubt over the content.  I would like to see all the data released and would also like to know which parts were misleading and what the real story is.
@georgejensen @jasoninthehouse Trump doesn't really have a choice. If he delays or denies the release it will turn a lot of heads and not the way he wants them turned.
@tiffanylloree @jasoninthehouse No such thing as integrity in DC
@cindyrburk @jasoninthehouse DOJ reviewed the nunes memo last Sunday. That is part of the process that has to be followed to release what was classified at the time.
@DadoftheDecade @GolfFanPC @Alyssa_Milano In your opinion, who gets credit for the market gains since Trump's election?  When does that change?  These are easy questions cookie.
@DadoftheDecade @GolfFanPC @Alyssa_Milano I didn't mention Obama other than to say Dems have repeatedly stated the market was climbing because of his policies, not Trump's. No need to yell princess
@DadoftheDecade @GolfFanPC @Alyssa_Milano Yes, he has been taking credit and it more than likely has nothing to do with him. the Dems, not Obama, have been saying the gains were due to Obama and not Trump. I can see you lean towards gains are because of Obama and drop is due to Trump. Thanks for playing cupcake
@DadoftheDecade @GolfFanPC @Alyssa_Milano Who's market was it when Dow was climbing after Trump was elected?  Was it Trump's or Obama's?  I understand if you don't want to answer the question.
@DadoftheDecade @GolfFanPC @Alyssa_Milano You missed the point. Since Trump has been elected the market has continued to climb. Until today all I've heard was the gains were due to Obama. And Obama did a lot of blaming Bush for the bad things that were happening.
@DadoftheDecade @GolfFanPC @Alyssa_Milano That goes both ways. Dems have been saying Trump had nothing to do with the market when it was climbing. When did it officially turn to Trump's market from Obama's?
@SenBooker You had 5 years to make sure this didn't happen. Now it is heartbreaking. What about the others it happened to before him?  Didn't care about them?  Now that you think it makes the right look bad it is heartbreaking?  This belongs on you and the rest of Congress.
@IronStarRosse @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @tedtoake1 @klrw2 What Trump did do, and I agree with is force congress to do their job and create a permanent solution instead of keeping a temporary program going forever.
@IronStarRosse @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @tedtoake1 @klrw2 The effect of the tax bill will be seen in a couple years. You can assume that it will have a negative impact based on history but this time might be different. Trump did not rescind DACA. Obama set and expiration date and is approaching.
@IronStarRosse @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @tedtoake1 @klrw2 We don't know what she would or wouldn't have done. We do know she would have been the same as Obama which a lot of voters didn't want. They wanted change. Gorsuch is only incompetent to you because you are liberal, to the right he is better than Garland.
@tedtoake1 @Carolyn_Hoechst @Sensata2014 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC No, they won't get worse because we pulled out of the agreement. They would still get worse even if we were in it because the other nations don't have and weren't required to have as strict of standards as we currently have.
@Carolyn_Hoechst @Sensata2014 @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC Fires were definitely bad this year and the smoke in the air was worse than I can ever remember. Had to keep the kids inside for a few days. I think they were trying to kill me because of that too.
@Carolyn_Hoechst @Sensata2014 @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC I wasn't close to any of them but I had some friends and co-workers who lost houses.
@Carolyn_Hoechst @Sensata2014 @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC None of that is new. Earthquakes, fire, flood and drought. That's what CA is all about.
@Carolyn_Hoechst @Sensata2014 @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC And all the fires have been put out, for now
@Carolyn_Hoechst @Sensata2014 @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC I live in SoCal
@Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC You realize the right would be saying the exact same thing if Hillary won and they would sound just as ridiculous.
@jhn7537 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @tedtoake1 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC Trump could save a baby from a burning building and the left would criticize him for taking to long. Just like the right would criticize everything Hillary would have done, or not dine had she been elected.
@Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC No it isn't worse than most years. Yes he lies a lot. No he isn't doing decades worth of damage. The world isn't on fire.
@KennethProctor2 @thehill Nobody cares what he does with his naughty parts. In case you forgot 2 major horn dogs and serial cheaters belonged to the Democratic party. One was even impeached for lying about playing hide the cigar with an intern.
@Carolyn_Hoechst @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @Sensata2014 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC Recessions happen all the time, they even happened under democratic presidents.
@Carolyn_Hoechst @tedtoake1 @jhn7537 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @Sensata2014 @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC You don't hate to say it. That's like me saying I hate donuts.
@Workhorse95 @ArrogantLizard @tedtoake1 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC More than any time I can remember.  Either way we need to get rid of the children we have making demands right now and replace them with adults who remember what negotiating looks like.
@Workhorse95 @ArrogantLizard @tedtoake1 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC The people didn't but the republican congress did.
@Workhorse95 @ArrogantLizard @tedtoake1 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC To be fair the Republicans resisted Obama just as much.
@jhn7537 @tedtoake1 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @TGowdySC There is a bubble and it is about due to pop. Average gap between recessions is about 27 months. That is not Trump's fault, just the natural cycle of the market
@Workhorse95 @ArrogantLizard @tedtoake1 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC I think to Trump was a choice and Hillary was another one, both equally bad in my opinion. How sad is it that people more qualified than both of them will not run because of both the cost to run and the cost of dragging your family thru the muck to get to the finish line
@ArrogantLizard @tedtoake1 @Sensata2014 @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC That's because you identify more with one side than the other. I lean right but know everyone up there is full of crap and only looking out for themself. Trump was a terrible choice and a result of the past 20 years.
@tedtoake1 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC Time is all we have. Can't change the past but we can use that knowledge to better our future.
@tedtoake1 @Sensata2014 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC Not just Republicans. The crap is swirling on all sides, one is just better at hiding it than the other.
@ArrogantLizard @tedtoake1 @Workhorse95 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC I agree but not taking that step now will guarantee it never happens. Clean house one room at a time.
@tedtoake1 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @Sensata2014 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC Hard to hold them accountable based on rhetoric.  Our only real chance is to clean house and replace with new people willing to work together.
@ArrogantLizard @Sensata2014 @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC Totally agree.  The more we fight with each other the more distracted we are. I hope we wake up before it is too late to do anything.
@ArrogantLizard @Sensata2014 @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC We need this to stop but I don't see that happening any time soon. We can start in November by electing people who are willing to work together regardless of party affiliation.
@ArrogantLizard @Sensata2014 @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC That is exactly what the "other side" says about the left
@ArrogantLizard @Sensata2014 @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC The spin makes it hard for me to believe anything out right now. In my opinion if there was anything proving Trump to be what he is accused of it would have been leaked by now. With The amount of leaks since last Nov it's hard to imagine someone keeping something that big secret
@ArrogantLizard @Sensata2014 @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC Have you seen this evidence first hand or are you going off information from your chosen media source?  The other side is just as adamant the mountain of evidence is as mythical as Bigfoot. I am anxious for the results of the investigation no matter what they show.
@Sensata2014 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC And, not to defend someone or something I don't know but don't we all cherry pick what we want to reply to?
@Sensata2014 @ArrogantLizard @Workhorse95 @Carolyn_Hoechst @IronStarRosse @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC I agree, the investigation should be allowed to come to a conclusion. The problem is, no matter the outcome one side will say it was tainted and the other will say it is 100% legit. Everyone right now is hoping they are on the side that can point and say I told you so.
@PUNCHDUMP @Carolyn_Hoechst @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @Sensata2014 @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC Good one...
@DavidMa15073886 What group is protesting Americans right to free speech?  How many people were protesting the women's March a couple weeks ago?  No one is trying to block the liberal marches and speakers.
@DavidMa15073886 @TheLastWord Not true. Both parties have the same goal, just a different way to achieve it. Not one of them wants to cut human rights. Republicans are a bit more business oriented where Dems are more emotional. This country needs both to succeed.
@Michael_Fisher_ @CharleSoulHaven @selectedwisdom We never get the full story. Most of that is intentional and self inflicted. We tend to only pay attention to media sources that confirm our feelings then we discredit and dismiss anything that makes us uncomfortable and retreat to our packs for support
@NotDumbocrat @sxdoc @ggeett37aaa @RepAdamSchiff That would put our entire govt in jail
@TweetyBR @KamalaHarris That would have been awesome and Congress has wasted 5 years where that could have been done. Now it it last minute and punting the ball will only put them in the same position at a later date. Taking care of it now will be the only way to give them peace of mind.
@DavidMa15073886 @TheLastWord It's not just the Republicans, the Democrats are doing a great job of destroying their party too.
@QGilbertMontez @TheLastWord This wouldn't be a leak of classified information. This would be a declassified memo being released to the public. Kind of a big difference between this and a leak
@99sjkronen_k @TheLastWord @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Looks like you are prime for some disappointment. As hated as he is and as many leaks as their have been, he can't pass gas while using the restroom without someone telling the press how bad it was. If there was anything indicating he would be charged it would have been on MSNBC
@NVGhost005 @TheLastWord @MSNBC If it's true I agree, but how do we prove it was changed?  How do we know the memo is accurate?  You see it already, Dems say it is all lies and Republicans are taking it as the Bible. Who do we believe?
@Luluwatching @KamalaHarris Congress has had 5 years to figure this out.  Give them more time and they will hit that deadline in the same spot we are in today. Congress needs to do their job and pass a bill. And a majority of dreamers are over 21, hardly babies anymore.
@4everDemocratic @KamalaHarris McConnell kept his word. There is a bill on the table. How is that the GOP delaying when Schumer is the one who said he won't even talk about that bill?
@spitterati @KamalaHarris Trump is also living up the the rules of the agreement. Obama set an expiration date, Trump didn't extend it, instead he is making congress do what they were elected to do. Both parties in Congress are keeping these people on the edge for political gain.
@kfr0329 @KamalaHarris @POTUS They don't have to accept the deal on the table, I would lose what little repect I had for them if they did. They need to negotiate and agree on a bill that both sides can live with.
@accurateDNA @KamalaHarris That's kind of what happens when to tell the feds you refuse to work with them. When you stop cooperating they have no choice but to put more agents in our neighborhoods and run their own show.
@TonyRandazzo8 @KamalaHarris That would take negotiation and Schumer already said he has no interest in discussing the current offer. I'm sure if they would go to the table the 12 would be reduced along with other items being lowered, but the 1.8 would probably be cut too
@GateKeeper1776 @KamalaHarris The largest bucket of dreamers are between 21 and 25 so you can also say a majority are 25 and under.
@thebayzdonyae @KamalaHarris Trump did not end DACA. Obama set a sunset date and Trump is making congress do their job and come up with a bill that will appease both parties. He laid his terms out, it is now on the Dems to lay out their terms and then both can start negotiating.
@JLB99902 @KamalaHarris Not all 800,000 are working and paying taxes. More than half are 25 and under and there is a good chance they are still in school or in an entry level position. It will have an impact but not as bad as you seem to want it to be.
@TweetyBR @KamalaHarris Dropping the deadline just kicks the can down the road letting the people we elected to create the laws off the hook of doing their jobs and making the hard decisions. Our govt has a habit of doing just that, kick it to the next guy and hope they are in the other party
@Nic00167 @KamalaHarris They are planning on voting no because of the rest of the stuff in the bill. Somewhere in the past 8 years the people we elected to negotiate on our behalf have forgotten how to negotiate. Instead they stomp their feet and make demands like children.
@3jindismay @KamalaHarris @BethAshworth5 Not trying to be mean, but what is stopping her from applying for citizenship?  I would like to know how many of the dreamers over 21 have applied for citizenship and why the ones who haven't are waiting.
@KamalaHarris Go do something that will give them peace of mind instead of posting meaningless words on social media. Work on passing bill that is acceptable to both parties.
@Carolyn_Hoechst @Workhorse95 @IronStarRosse @Sensata2014 @tedtoake1 @klrw2 @jhn7537 @TGowdySC True, Trump has cheated on all his wives and will probably cheat on the next one too. If only Republicans could stay loyal to their spouses like all democratic presidents do. At least Bill Clinton and JFK only cheated on 1 wife.
@THOMASBMALONE @KamalaHarris @MSNBC Trump didn't end the program. It had an expiration date set by Obama and Trump put it on congress to make it a permanat program. To date they have failed because one side refuses to talk over other items that can probably be negotiated down.
@chrislhayes Who does more?
@scott_satzer @GovCTW @PreetBharara @USATODAY I believe the investigation needs to be completed. If Mueller is fired it will just kick off another one wasting more money. Will you accept the outcome even if the result is Trump is innocent?
@Karnythia Dispatch then told me the driver knows he had the right address and he remembers my house. I asked them to tell me what was on my porch. Next thing they said was it will be delivered later that day.
@Karnythia I was expecting a package from ups so I stayed home all day waiting. Got a text saying they attempted delivery but no one was home. I called and was told the office building was closed so they will deliver on Monday. I live in a house.
@knotaboy @Charliijean @315Robin @galerwife @Alyssa_Milano I miss when we could get news from news sources instead of biased opinions. The suit thing was an indicator of the crap to come. We all should have paid more attention.
@knotaboy @Charliijean @315Robin @galerwife @Alyssa_Milano DACA and border security go hand in hand. Military spending can be separate from these two. Border security comes in many fashions, a wall is one of them and increased border patrol is another.
@knotaboy @Charliijean @315Robin @galerwife @Alyssa_Milano I also have the ability to converse with anyone despite not agreeing with their opinion. I don't have the need to change their mind, they don't have to agree with me. My life is fine either way.
@knotaboy @Charliijean @315Robin @galerwife @Alyssa_Milano I dislike Dems and Republicans equally. Both parties are spineless and only say what they believe their base wants to hear then blame the other party for the fall of mankind. They forget when they point a finger at someone else, they have 3 fingers pointing back at themselves
@knotaboy @315Robin @galerwife @Charliijean @Alyssa_Milano Now one member of Congress said that was racist
@knotaboy @315Robin @galerwife @Charliijean @Alyssa_Milano We have a Congress of petulant children who want to point fingers and will find fault in anything the other side comes up with. Like Trump saying he supports a pathway to citizenship for not only the 800k who properly applied for DACA, but the other 400k who didn't
@knotaboy @315Robin @galerwife @Charliijean @Alyssa_Milano A bipartisan effort would be nice but that has not happened and will not happen with this group in office. Neither party is willing to listen to the other side. They both sit on their side of the room and lob demands at the other side. That's not how negotiating works.
@knotaboy @Charliijean @315Robin @galerwife @Alyssa_Milano Congress, again
@knotaboy @315Robin @galerwife @Charliijean @Alyssa_Milano Congress is completely to blame and now they have to make a decision. Either take action and come to an agreement or they all get deported. Trump, like him or not is forcing them to do what they should have done under Obama.
@knotaboy @315Robin @galerwife @Charliijean @Alyssa_Milano He didn't create the crisis, it has been there since Obama used executive action to create this program. The minute he signed that order he should have set the timeline and requested action from Congress. He didn't and now it is on Trump to either kick the can or do something.
@315Robin @galerwife @Charliijean @knotaboy @Alyssa_Milano DACA is Differed Action for Childhood Arrivals. It is a temp program put in place until a permenant solution was decided on. Our leaders have done what they do with everything else, kick it down the road until someone, hopefully the rival team has to make a tough decision
@bigbiggs57 @AlexMohajer @HillaryClinton I believe it was Romney who warned us about the Russians and he was laughed at.
@cmcarroll62 @BigHeadTales @chrislhayes I agree. Hard to believe how willing people are to accept change.
@KathyWestfall5 @thehill @realDonaldTrump @CNNPolitics @seanhannity @JulianAssange @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenateGOP @RudyGiuliani @TGowdySC Firing Mueller would be the biggest mistake he could make. Makes him look guilty and will start the process all over again with another investigator. Let him finish his job and everyone needs to accept the findings.
@tamaracalif @thehill @POTUS Trump did not divide the country. The country has been divided since Bush vs Gore and the gap has increased with every adminstration since. No one has done Jack to fix it because people would rather be on the "winning team" instead of work together.
@StrikklyRealDea @thehill Wouldn't a 360 send things pointing back to Trump?
@CBSNews Hope they try him as an adult and then go after his parents.
@JoeNBC When Dems declare war against the president and his supporters just because Trump won the electoral they are being patriots but when Republicans declare war against the FBI it is anti-democratic. Did I get that right?  Both positions and declarations are dumb.
@BigHeadTales @MrReginaldJames @chrislhayes I don't think that is the only reason. Less choice in carriers was also a major contributor to the increase.
@MrReginaldJames @BigHeadTales @chrislhayes I can accept that. Are the premium increases attributed to both also or totally on DT?  If only on DT, why is that pinned to Trump where the market increase is shared?
@BigHeadTales @chrislhayes Good luck to all of us. If the majority is right we are gonna need it.
@BigHeadTales @chrislhayes Dr told me I had to be more optimistic so I'm giving that a shot.
@BigHeadTales @chrislhayes Thanks you for the civil discussion. I agree about the market to a point and am anxious to see what happens this year. If it crashes I will buy more stocks, if it gains I will enjoy the returns. Trickle down has never worked, but it only takes one time to change that.
@BigHeadTales @chrislhayes I agree but would like to see how this works out. I'm not one to jump on the we're doomed or the everything is peaches and rainbows bandwagon.
@BigHeadTales @chrislhayes Click on the link and it is the first thing you see. This might seem off topic, is the increase in the stock market a result of Trump's policies or Obama's? If they are a result of DT's policies I accept your position, if they are a result of O's policies, why are they different?
@BigHeadTales @chrislhayes As far as the tax being permanent for business and only 10 years for us regular people, there is still time to make our permanent and I will gladly accept the 10 year reprieve and drop a good part of that into savings.
@BigHeadTales @chrislhayes Inflation hasn't changed in years. And extra 1.7% does help. Also HC premiums have doubled since 2013 according to this article. That is an avg of 25% a year. We have to wait to see what the increase is before we call it dramatic in comparison https://t.co/OP3V73AH2q
@BigHeadTales @chrislhayes Based on the attached article the average median income for 2017 was $57,617. While I agree that a 1.7% bonus isn't much, it is far from pennies and can ease a bit of financial pain for a couple months.   https://t.co/DwUs47TUC9
@chrislhayes Do you know If they are giving the bonus in lieu of an increase?
@daverburgess @kjhurls1888 @JoeNBC @realDonaldTrump Please correct me if I am wrong, but a green card expires and can also be revoked at any time for any reason. How does that help the dreamers?  If they haven't applied for citizenship by now why would they apply for it after they get a green card?
@cdelbrocco @paulkrugman Yes, Republicans are the only party that lies. Dems always tell the truth no matter how hard it is or what it will cost them.
@Karnythia If my father in law wanted to do that for his daughter it is within his right to do so. We also need to recognize, that money was given to her and not us. We are not entitled to anything with the cash, it is hers to spend. I would drive the hell out of the car though.
@Fight4Goodness @Mamthew @virginiafoxx @SpeakerRyan Wrong. It is the responsibility of both parties to negotiate in good faith and not air their grievances on social media to make the other side look like monsters. All that does is divide the voters more.
@Mamthew @virginiafoxx @SpeakerRyan Need 60 votes to pass a budget in Senate. Unless Republicans hold 60 seats the Dems can tank the talks by voting along party lines. In this case simple majority doesn't matter, but you probably already knew that.
@johnwhitehead81 @virginiafoxx @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr You also can't run a government by not negotiating. One side does not need to bend to the others will, both sides need to give a little and take a lot less.
@virginiafoxx @SpeakerRyan Senate is holding the American people hostage. There, I fixed it for you.
@jeremyscahill And the Dems are all pure as the driven snow. Saying this is one parties issue is wrong.
@raphaelha67 @Slate If it comes out that he committed an impeachable offense then I am with you. Until then I want him to stop tweeting and start focusing on bringing the 2 parties together. Ok, maybe not stop completely but cut back to only while in the bathroom like the rest of us do.
@thebellyboy @NoahFinneburgh @Slate We will probably never see evidence of it and I'm fine with that, but based on his track record my money is on the Clinton's would be a lot richer if Bill would have kept his pants on.
@raphaelha67 @Slate I don't know what he is doing and either do you. You think he is golfing and kicking back at a Cabana grabbing chicks by the...I like to think he is getting some work done. Truth is, it is probably a combination of both.
@raphaelha67 @Slate He isn't golfing 24/7.
@raphaelha67 @Slate Another thing I don't care about. If he is working while at his resort that isn't a vacation. If he is playing with Russian hookers while on vacation then I will have a problem.
@thebellyboy @NoahFinneburgh @Slate You really think we know about all of Bills escapades?  Or Trump's for that matter. Are you sure Bill has never paid any hush money? My bet is on he has paid a lot of people to shut up. Maybe not Trump level but he did his best.
@codyryanmua @SenatorLankford If it was that simple the budget would have passed but to pass a budget they need 60 votes. Even if all Republicans voted for the bill they would need 9 Dem votes. 48 Dems voted against it.
@ArlottyB @SenatorLankford That would be true if it was a simple majority vote, but it isn't. Most people know how this works.
@SenatorLankford Cool story, now go do your job and negotiate a budget instead of wasting time on social media to point the finger at the Dems. You are all to blame.
@raphaelha67 @Slate And a better chance it wasn't funded by tax payers. Bottom line, I don't care if he cheats on his wife. Not a single representative in DC is 100% innocent. As long as they do their job, at which they are all failing, what they do with their pants parts is none of our business.
@NoahFinneburgh @Slate Do I have to bring up Bill Clinton and the settlements he paid?
@Slate Unless it was funded by tax payers I don't care.
@JoeNBC No, this is the result of our elected officials refusing to do what they were elected to do. They are there to negotiate and get the job done not stomp their feet and point at the other team.
@NYGovCuomo I thought it took 60 votes to pass the budget. How many Republicans voted against the budget and how many Dem voted for it?  Seems to me it is a failure if all our representatives not just one team.
@Karnythia @arsmith326 @AbelUndercity Bacon makes everything better. Except mushrooms
@thehill That's not what Trump's Dr said yesterday. I would believe a Dr who performed the checkup over a Dr who didn't.
@morgfair @voxdotcom No, the handing out opioids like candy is to blame for the opioid epidemic.
@biezzer1 @Pollueloenfuego @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 @paulkrugman The pilgrams are the reason we have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. What happened between their arrival and where we are today was terrible but it isn't something we can change now. Colonize might have been the wrong word but I can't change that now.
@Pollueloenfuego @biezzer1 @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 @paulkrugman Phys Ed is vital and so is nutrition. Raising our kids to judge on actions and not looks would show them we are all in this together.
@biezzer1 @Pollueloenfuego @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 @paulkrugman Are you assuming I only think about me because of my stand on deportations?  Illegal immigration impacts the poor more than the middle or upper class. Making sure all people who come here do so legally also means they can bring their wife and kids with them.
@biezzer1 @Pollueloenfuego @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 @paulkrugman Pursuit of happiness doesn't mean you achieve happiness just that you are free to follow your dreams to get there. As I said I agreed on the environment part. If seeing others deported makes you sad then do something about it.
@biezzer1 @Pollueloenfuego @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 I completely agree with you. Bridging the Gap begins with us and it is done by electing people to office that will work across the aisle. The tribal environment we are currently in is toxic and will only divide us more over time.
@Pollueloenfuego @biezzer1 @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 That's the problem with all elected officials, Dems are just better at manipulating thier base to believe the lies they are preaching.
@biezzer1 @Pollueloenfuego @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 @paulkrugman None of what you listed is considered a right, maybe it should be but that was not the question.
@biezzer1 @Pollueloenfuego @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 @paulkrugman Obama deported an average of over 850 people a day. To be at that pace Trump would have had to deport 310k people since taking office. I agree with the the environment and healthcare although I think ACA needs major changes to be sustainable.
@biezzer1 @Pollueloenfuego @nuckles87 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 @paulkrugman What rights have you lost under Trump?
@AGentileInBoca @CharlieCookDC Does everything include jobs and the stock market or just the negative stuff?
@gelles @morgfair Journalists do play a major role in our society. That is why it is vital the ones writing news keep their biases out of the story and just report what happened. The people are not as dumb as they think we are. Well, most of us aren't.
@Pollueloenfuego @nuckles87 @biezzer1 @KFrequency @susanmcnerney @marcilynflanne3 @paulkrugman No, it was created to give states with smaller population a say in who is elected president. What if CA, TX, FL and NY were red States?  The keeping psychos out of office is a small part of it which would have failed either way this past election. Both candidates sucked
@floridarocket There are some people who can eat what they want with little impact to their health. Others eat a piece of pizza and their numbers go nuts. It's about knowing your body and how it reacts to the food you are consuming.
@seraphinaspang @Barb4Ward @w_crawford @SmilelyLoriLynn @sadamerican4 @nwarikoo @SRuhle @SteveSchmidtSES @HoneyDemForce @maddow @realDonaldTrump Obama administration averaged over 850 deportations a day thru his 8 years in office.
@ezraklein Or the result is they found nothing and the DNC refuses to accept the results. Kind of like Hillary and the emails. When will our elected officials stop playing school yard games?
@msvickimoore @EricRWeinstein You don't hear from them because they are immediately shut down as centrists, called bots and instantly blocked by those we speak out against. We are told to pick a team and blindly follow. There is more truth in the silent middle than on the outspoken edges.
@cheezebiscuits @Mtngrwn This started way before Obama and every administration is responsible for driving the wedge and fostering the my team vs your team environment that got us a president Trump.
@ezraklein Doesn't matter who is in office, the opposing party will freak out over anything and supporting party will shrug it off like it's nothing. This isn't new.
@geekyteacher1 @BigDawg_73 @existentialfish Every president receives interview questions in advance. By your statement no president can be trusted in an interview, including Obama.
@jill_woodie @existentialfish Clinton got a debate question in advance of a debate. That is the difference. Clinton also receives interview questions before to make sure she won't be blind sided. Receiving interview questions in advance is common practice for people at their level.
@Former_CAM @existentialfish @KatCapps @realDonaldTrump @GOP There is a difference between getting interview questions and getting presidential debate questions in advance. One is common and the other is unethical.
@DDT_RN @JuddApatow @FoxNews Out of all the charges filed so far not one is for treason or collusion.
@GBeganovic @RawStory @SpeakerRyan Why didn't we think of that before?  All we have to do is demand they step down and they totally will...
@oaktownca51 @RawStory Yes, because burning down business in your own neighborhood is the way to solve decades of problems in Washington. Great idea.
@Allsehendes_Aug @thehill I hope the truth is exposed whatever it may be. I also hope everyone accepts the outcome.
@Slate How is it unconstitutional?
@EdKrassen How much were you paying per post in 2015?
@graple12 @EdKrassen @WolfKJM Don't need to ask directions. My wife tells me when I am wrong.
@GenDesignInc @RuthSorbello @SenBlumenthal Still waiting.
@gatita_bonita_s @Joy_Villa Only time will tell and not enough time has passed.
@gatita_bonita_s @Joy_Villa The economy has grown since he took office, true but he has his flaws, more flaws than not. We are too early into his term to call him a success.
@Apkamps @greta I don't think it was as big an impact as it is made out to be. She was a flawed candidate with trust issues. Trump was/is a total Trainwreck but he is different from the status quo politics that she ran on. I agree that he did hurt her but not to the degree that he cost her.
@Apkamps @greta Or it could make it so prosecution isn't an option.
@Apkamps @greta Right but his original statement called out gross negligence which makes her actions prosecutable. That was changed and the tone was softened.
@Apkamps @greta No, he can't make up facts but he can change wording to make things seem more or less dire like the Comey announcement. Gross negligence is a crime, extremely careless is not.
@Apkamps @greta Not true but when someone is as passionate as he is about his hatred toward the target they are bound to make some comments in passing.
@Apkamps @greta It would be awkward for me to yell out how does that chart look while in bed...
@Apkamps @greta Absolutely not. I also don't send messages to my wife from my work phone or my work email account.
@Apkamps @greta And that was the right thing to do, but I'm sure everyone in the office knew how Strzok felt. If he was sending messages like we have seen it is highly unlikely he swallowed his words during conversations at the office.
@Apkamps @greta He never should have been involved in the first place. I'm sure there are agents just as qualified as he was that didn't have such extreme hatred for the target. Including him gives the other side the ability to say the investigation was biased.
@Apkamps @greta Everyone has their opinions which taints how we look at data in front of us. I'm not saying only Republicans should be investigating or only Dems should be involved. Im saying his actions, and the actions of a few others should be investigated.
@Apkamps @greta That wasn't your point. Your point was his messages should have remained private, unless I read that wrong.
@Apkamps @greta He also sent similar emails using his FBI account. Those are public record. If the phone he is using is company issued, any communication using that device is also public record.
@greta People were going to question the integrity of the investigation no matter what. All of them could be clean as a whistle but one side will cry foul while the other side will scream I told you so.
@gatita_bonita_s @Joy_Villa 3 examples of people elected to office that had 0 experience. Al Franken, Jesse Venture and Donald Trump.
@GenDesignInc @RuthSorbello @SenBlumenthal Now, please tell me what part of my statement was false?
@GenDesignInc @RuthSorbello @SenBlumenthal I have not attacked you or called you any names. That is what a troll does. I am open to having a conversation if that's what you want to do.
@GenDesignInc @RuthSorbello @SenBlumenthal Doesn't matter who did, and it isn't a false narrative that Clinton was involved in funding the dossier. I just find it funny when I support my statement with an article from politico I get blocked. Is everyone who disagrees with you a troll?
@RuthSorbello @GenDesignInc @SenBlumenthal To that I say, Bye Felicia
@RuthSorbello @GenDesignInc @SenBlumenthal Amazing. I get called a troll and blocked for answering questions and linking an article to support my statement by the person asking for my source. I have never blocked anyone for merely disagreeing with me. I enjoy a good conversation with people having different beliefs.
@RuthSorbello @iliza @UnicornsPuppies Digging a little deep here aren't we. Bored?  Might I suggest finding a new hobby?
@RuthSorbello @GenDesignInc @SenBlumenthal This right leaning rag right here. https://t.co/7cb5l38o0M
@RuthSorbello I'm not the only one. You really think an agent married to someone working at Fusion GPS is just a coincidence?  It is called conflict of interest and is a terminable offense in most companies.
@RuthSorbello @GenDesignInc @SenBlumenthal Along with the DNC and Clinton.
@jeff_of_fish @EricHolder It is also hard to say the investigator married to a lady working for Fusion GPS is unbiased.
@LjollyRenay @EricHolder @chrislhayes All members of Congress. None of them will pass any kind of investigation.
@jeff_of_fish @EricHolder Hard to say one is unbiased when he is texting things like he can protect the country in multiple ways and there is no way he will win but it is like an insurance policy.
@Zachary_Scottie @ReRe_76804 @EricHolder The FBI didn't show blatant bias against Bill. They investigated him, as they should have and  he liked under oath.
@maggieNYT Sometimes, when people quit a job they decide to go renegade causing immediate removal. We will never know the real story, just 2 stories with the same result but a different path to the end.
@GenDesignInc @SenBlumenthal Another reason it matters. We now know the Steele dossier was funded by the DNC and the Clintons. We also know one of the investigators is married to someone who worked for Fusion GPS during the campaign. While it may all be coincidence it should be looked at.
@GenDesignInc @SenBlumenthal You should have stopped at grandstanding should be shut down. Firing Mueller would be a mistake but the texts from Strzok and the fact that he changed text on the email document from grossly negligent to extremely careless when the law calls out negligence should be investigated.
@RonWyden Where were you when this was being drafted?
@Alyssa_Milano 2/3 of white women who voted. Not 2/3 of all white women
@YahooNews You are right. He is accused not convicted. But do you really think he was the best man for the job?  Out of all the people in Alabama these are the 2 they go with?
@ISLEOFMODELS @YahooNews Calipornia?  Burn baby burn?  Who hurt you?  You do know Calipornia donated a ton of money to help those of you in Florida after the hurricanes?  Not once did they say drown baby drown.
@YahooNews Barely beating a racist homophobe who is also accused of touching kids for a 2 year job is not an ominous sign for anyone. It is another sign of what happens when you run 2 candidates who are a slight upgrade from a dumpster fire.
@EKoubek @babsnyny @KamalaHarris Franklin might not be planning on leaving but Franken announced he was leaving last week.
@markfuture2 @KamalaHarris He could have stayed. It was his choice to listen. The only reason to listen to those  pushing him out was if they knew what the ethics committee was gonna find.  I'm pretty sure Mueller would be there without Franken.
@markfuture2 @KamalaHarris Franken could have stayed but he quit. That means he doesn't want to be there.
@babsnyny @KamalaHarris Franken chose to leave, he was not forced out.
@elizabethforma @GDouglasJones He barely beat a racist homophobe who was accused of touching kids. If he was a great candidate it would have been a landslide. He won because Republicans couldn't vote for the guy hoping to represent their party.
@Torontoprof1 @ChipnNolna @jbendery Both parties want us dependant. One want us dependant on the federal govt the other dependant on the rich. It is up to us to sort thru the muck and pick who will be best for all people, not just people we agree with.
@Torontoprof1 @ChipnNolna @jbendery The end goal of both parties is the same. The only difference between the 2 parties is how they get there.
@Torontoprof1 @ChipnNolna @jbendery No party is denying healthcare to anyone. One party wants to change the system that is admittedly flawed from the beginning. I agree with the second statement and most of the third. Destroying education is a stretch. You are blinded by your hatred of a person.
@ACLU That will only be an issue for conservatives.
@IQ133 @Alyssa_Milano @b_b_baconator What if they are there to vote for Moore?
@sirDukeDevin @floridarocket No actual proof tillerson called him a moron, just stories from unnamed sources. McMaster was not wrong. His accusers, just like all accusers should be heard. Would you rather he had a cabinet of ues men like the last few administrations?
@Torontoprof1 @ChipnNolna @jbendery GOP is no more evil than DNC. All elected officials will sell out their base if it will put them in a better position. Dems just continue to pretend they care.
@MColeen75 @jbendery @HuffPost This isn't a GOP thing this is a govt thing. It is always party first. Only difference now is the GOP quit trying to hide it. It has been a problem since Regan.
@cpierson8 @actisharon @BLEmmerth @RonWyden @Lawrence @realDonaldTrump Bill Clinton was investigated but not impeached for his behavior. He was impeached for lying under oath. Had he not lied he would not have been impeached.
@tariqnasheed What does this have to do with the kid?  Don't let the sins of his parent detract from the fact this kid is a vitim of bullying and needs some help. Is his situation less dire because of his mom?
@VassalloDeb @sallysrock @sarahTRUMPMORON @RepSwalwell @mikefarb1 They say based on the evidence it didn't happen
@VassalloDeb @sarahTRUMPMORON @RepSwalwell @mikefarb1 You can think it happened but the evidence isn't there. I think I am in perfect health but the evidence my Dr has is hard to argue with.
@VassalloDeb @sarahTRUMPMORON @RepSwalwell @mikefarb1 Where is your proof?  The same intelligence angencies that said Russia was spreading propaganda stated there was no evidence any votes were changed.
@sallysrock @sarahTRUMPMORON @RepSwalwell @mikefarb1 @sallysrock even though you blocked me I saw your reply. They looked, they didn't find anything. Sorry if my statement of facts is counter to what you wanted to happen but life sucks sometimes.
@sallysrock @sarahTRUMPMORON @RepSwalwell @mikefarb1 It has been reported since the election and has been asked in multiple congressional hearings about Russian interference.
@sarahTRUMPMORON @RepSwalwell @mikefarb1 Not one vote was changed. Russia did the same thing they always do with greater success because both candidates were such train wrecks. They tried to hack into the voting systems but were not successful.
@thejunkqueen85 @latimes @DNC @SenateDems @NancyPelosi First he has to commit an impeachable offense. Any action before that is like spitting into a fan
@ExportedFromMI @geegeeloch @NYGovCuomo They are?
@IntegralAnswers @Cernovich You think Trump is the first president to constantly lie?  Far from it. He is just bad at it
@geegeeloch @NYGovCuomo @ExportedFromMI If they are unsubstantiated why did he apologize and why is he resigning?
@ladydth @Staypuffft @DFusit @NYGovCuomo You can get a gun with a misdemeanor but you probably won't get a concealed carry permit which this bill is about.
@JBPNW9 @NYGovCuomo How many mass shootings have been carried out by someone with a concealed carry permit?
@triciat1123 @NYGovCuomo Last I checked the right to bear arms is in the Constitution, so by that the GOP is protecting our constitional form of government.
@ctpapps @JasonLaz @NYGovCuomo You're right, Vermont does not require a permit to carry open or concealed. This bill allows those with Concealed Carry permits to carry in other states meaning if you live in Vermont it is still illegal to carry a concealed weapon in another state because you don't have a permit
@NYGovCuomo If they are convicted of a violent misdemeanor they probably don't have a concealed carry permit which means it is still illegal for them to carry concealed weapons in any state. You also forgot the 16 Dems who voted for the bill.
@politicarchy @ArashMarkazi @maggieNYT The students were going to be charged with a crime and serve jail time. They were not allowed to leave the country. The president saved them from doing time in China.
@mkuwabee @michaelianblack @Rosie @realDonaldTrump They were in a communist country where they admittedly stole several items from high end stores. Just because they don't live there doesn't mean they don't have to abide by the laws of the land. if you were visiting London and spoke against the queen, you would be arrested
@MindsEyeWithME @SenFeinstein President can't fire an elected official. They aren't dictators.
@nicholasrmiller @SenFeinstein All presidents are temporary
@SalVulcano Why so late?  Christmas has been at Costco for 3 weeks already
@hallelalaluwah @CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint And so much better than Hoyer and Bethard
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint Half way thru the SB season as well. It was an awesome team that played incredibly well together.
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint And, if I remember correctly, Smith led the team to the championship game the year before and also had a winning record before he got hurt
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint He made plays because he was relatively unknown. What happened the next year?  He struggled because he couldn't adapt to a new system.
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint Helped won games. Didn't win on his own. They would have gone with Smith taking snaps also. They were a great team with an incredible D
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint I don't think he is as good as others. I think he was a fast running evasive qb with a strong arm. Once teams got tape on him he was done
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint Kap only has one of those
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint Kap is not as accurate as he needs to be. With strength plus accuracy and the ability to stand in the pocket he would be a top 10 qb.
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint Smith was replaced while out because of a concussion. Harbaugh was forced to start Kap when Smith was healthy.
@jtbarabasz @VeniceMase No, he got injured and gabbert took over. He then went to have surgery which took him out for the year. Gabbert sucks
@richardfrias @VeniceMase I disagree. Solid backup not a starter. He had a great line and above average receivers. When forced to play in the pocket he sucks.
@CaptRyMo @scrizzzo @VeniceMase @ShaunKing I agree, he is a solid backup. Should have been on a team as a backup. Then he sues the owners. He is done
@CaptRyMo @pat_loewen @VeniceMase @HalFurman Yes. The owners aren't racist. They care about money. Lynch has been sitting for years. He is on a team because he still brings in the money
@CaptRyMo @VeniceMase @LakersFanJoint Strong arm with no accuracy. Is not a pocket passer. If first 2 reads are covered he runs. Oh, and he is suing the owners for collusion
@debbielala58 @FnTslovechild @thehill I know better than you because I watch football and am a fan of the team he abandoned.
@debbielala58 @FnTslovechild @thehill You don't watch football but you believe they blackballed him?  I'm a Niner fan i've watched his career. He is the reason he isnt on a team
@debbielala58 @thehill No one has ruined his career. Lynch has been sitting for years, he found a new team with no issues.
@debbielala58 @thehill He wasn't let go. He opted out because he thought he could get more money on a different team.
@Alyssa_Milano If it could have been done it would have been done by now. Let the investigation close first otherwise it is just a day dream
@washingtonpost The result of sanctuary cities will not be a safer city, it will be more federal agents in the city.
@thehill Liberals have believed a comedian was a legit news source for years.  Comedy Central, More trusted than CNN
@kcookingcorner @Alyssa_Milano So true. Please wait where you are, the police are on their way to arrest you for this post.
@flitedocnm @Alyssa_Milano No, Trump will not arrest anyone for not standing. It is a school policy not a law.
@michellemalkin Stay gold Ponyboy
@FrankArmy There is a lot of desert on the way to Vegas. No one gets off on Zyzzx
@PrisonPlanet That's what it turned into, but it started before anyone though Trump had a shot at winning.
@proviewsusa @Alyssa_Milano @templargoddess @realDonaldTrump Do you think the govt is doing a good job at running the VA and Medicare as it is now?
@Saazuka @DAMDIVA1 @TheAntigonaki @chelseahandler @realDonaldTrump Wasn't Obama working with SA on terrorism?
@RepKihuen @RubenKihuen @USCBO Has the CBO run numbers on what would happen if Obamacare was left in place?
@floridarocket @MSNBC Probably the same kind of people who say Trump and all his supporters should die
@FrankArmy Depends on if you approve my approval.
@jail_bush @business Liar
@jail_bush @business I don't want you to miss me
@jail_bush @business Don't have any answers, huh?
@jail_bush @business And I care about you because I am a person
@jail_bush @business I am still going because you haven't answered any of my questions. I'm guessing you don't have any answers, just blind rage
@jail_bush @business Looks like a bunch of players will be cut soon. Oh wait, they don't suck at their position.
@jail_bush @business I am watching Moana with my kids. That is doing something.
@jail_bush @business I would need a drink if I was you too. Enjoy
@jail_bush @business Still waiting.
@jail_bush @business But go ahead and tell me how racist and moronic I am and how the NFL should be shut down because he sucks.
@jail_bush @business Owners care about wins, not his protest. The first team that needs a QB will pick him up. Rumor is the Bengals are looking at him this week
@jail_bush @business And since you are an expert is football, tell me what starting QB is he better than?
@jail_bush @business Does name calling make you feel tough?
@jail_bush @business He is a one trick qb and everyone knows he runs after his second read is covered. I watched him play for 3 years.
@jail_bush @business He will be signed soon. Glad you are a rational person. We need more of you to tell the rest of us how terrible we are.
@edwardbrowden @ipasuuple @chrislhayes He has the right to his form of protest. Only morons are denying that. The president has the right to voice his opinion.
@BBCNews Abortion is not a crime.
@Byteflux @jail_bush @business Last I checked Kaepernick decided to opt out of his contract to get a better payday. Niners didn't cut him, he quit.
@jimmykimmel @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC @ChrisChristie I have an idea. Instead of trading one sided words in public why don't you guys get together and come up with something.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump So much for the peaceful transfer of power she was bragging about when she thought she was gonna win.
@Desi_Kills @ChristineFerea @RockyPMMA @GGGBoxing GGG was the champ.  Canelo had to win decisively to take a decision. Regardless, the decision tonight was what's wrong with boxing.
@CBSNews @PressSec @jemelehill I don't watch CNN for sports or ESPN for political statements. Fortunately for her ESPN leans left. She will probably get an award
@1LightwaveTech Good idea.  Nothing wrong with eggs.
@JohnS138 @blessinginchaos @USATODAY The govt can't manage the VA, approx less than 3% of US population. What makes you think they would do a better job with total control?
@1LightwaveTech That's great news.
@1LightwaveTech It sucks you have to go thru all that mess. The good news is she will be home soon.  I'm hopeful everything will work out.
@1LightwaveTech Hey Ron. Just wanted to check and see how your wife's recovery is coming along.
@RyanQuadri @cnnbrk Are you just as offended by Bill's actions?
@RyanQuadri @cnnbrk I agree with you on both statements. Any abuse should not be tolerated.
@KamalaHarris @ThatChrisRyan Figure out how to run the VA and I will agree with you
@RyanQuadri @cnnbrk And there is no proof he abused women. Just audio of him talking.
@RyanQuadri @cnnbrk Not ok but is a far cry from abusing innocent kids.
@RyanQuadri @cnnbrk None of the allegations against Trump involved children.  Thanks for playing.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Makes sense. My wife works at a CPA firm and I am in wireless.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Why would you leave a state job?  They never get fired and are one of the only jobs that still comes with a pension.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano To bypass FOIA.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano What you see as lies others see as valid, like the server. It was careless and wreckless. It was also advised against. Some see it as a way
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano I am not smart enough to write language for a bill.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano That's part of the problem. If someone doesn't do their job they should be fired. Their job isn't to do what I want them to do.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano They are getting better but it has been a long process.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Few A-Holes that will work their people to death. Look at Amazon, they had a high turnover rate because of a toxic environment.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano They should be allowed to but not at the detriment of their employees.  Most companies will not take advantage but we all know there are the
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano It could be if our elected reps would act like adults instead of kids. My twin 4 year olds act more grown up then our officials.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Good stuff. I live in CA. No way we could afford to even rent without 2 incomes.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Occupations we have, but there should also be risk of termination for not doing their job.  Some teachers get tenor and check out
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano This all starts in school.  Our education system rewards the gifted and stifles the struggling. Teacher should be one of the highest paying
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano If I had that answer I would be a lobbyist in DC, not an analyst.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Not to pry but How do you make ends meet?  Obviously you don't have to answer.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Some people will always need help and they should never be left behind.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Help them. Dependency is not a solution, it is a crutch. Set deadlines and goals. Give them confidence to do things on their own.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Have you ever been unemployed?
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano It isn't that simple because people suck. We have labor laws because we need them, they protect us from unfair practices.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano First to step in with aid and to help get back to whole. It is on the individual to accept the help and improve thier situation
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano If any of my friends or family were on hard times my house is open to them.  If someone doesn't have anyone then the state should be the
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano If a person is between jobs it is all of our job to help them until they are back on their feet.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Needs are different for everyone. I am fortunate enough to have a decent job and am able to take care of my needs.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Not at all. How is the govt supposed to know what will make 330+million people happy?  They are there to protect our rights and keep us safe
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano In office to do their job. That job isn't to make us happy. That job is to negotiate on our behalf. It isn't to only fight when they can win
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano What would be fine for me?  A govt that works for the people by doing this job. As people we need to recognize our elected officials are
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano As a citizen it is not my right to be happy with the govt, it is my right to voice my opinion and challenge if I see fit.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano I don't agree with most of what Trump says and does, I do agree with some of it. I had the same opinion of Obama.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano In my opinion the government should be there to protect and help, not decide what is best for us on our behalf.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Once we are dependant on government we lost. They will decide what we do, what we buy and from who. They will also choose when re we live
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Democratic destruction. We will lose rights left and right, starting with free speech, then the right to choose our own individual path
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano The people want to be united, not divided. People know this division, also not caused by Trump is toxic and is leading down a path of
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano I'm not allowed to agree or disagree with this statement.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano That is not a knock on Trump. It has been busted for years. Trump is the result of a broken system. He is a band aid but not the cure
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano I don't know if Comey's firing was responsible but I do think it was inevitable. Our govt is broken and no longer represents the people.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano I don't parse words.  it only confirms what I want to hear, not what was actually said. I learned that from being married.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano So what you are saying is, Trump fired Comey because he had evidence against Hillary
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano Classified information.
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano He did have evidence against her. Even stated others more than likely would be prosecuted for the careless and wreckless way she handled
@edisn @Alyssa_Milano So now Comey and the FBI are complicit?  Is that why Comey was fired?  For working with Russia?
@MJMcKean Go to the restroom and sneeze on her lunch as you walk by
@ABCWorldNews Just shows how out of touch she really is. Blame everyone and everything except what actually cost her the election.
@SocialPowerOne1 Don't hold your breath.
@FoxNews @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr The debt ceiling only provides opportunities for fiscal discipline if you stick to it instead of raising it every 6 months.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Sorry to hear about your wife's medical issues. Glad she is doing better.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein But they are also the most experienced and know more about the business. The 10% they took was more than the 20% taken by most workers in $
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I do enjoy the conversation we are having though. All of them. It is nice to discuss different ideas in a non hostile way for a change.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I will be in meetings all day so I might be slow to get back to you.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I think the younger generation never learned how to ask for a raise or a promotion instead the expect it to fall in their lap.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein In my opinion, min wage jobs are entry level and meant to be used as a launching pad to a career not to sustain a family.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Back to full time again
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Managers took a 10% cut but the workers took a 20% hit. I do know the owner of the company did not draw a check until the workers were
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I do agree in tough times bonuses should be scrapped for everyone. I worked for a company that cut us back 1 day a week in 2008.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Product or utilities.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Line increases by about $208k a year. Most of the money usually gets dumped back into the business so that is $200k a year less for
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Employee can find an equal job at a competitor. If a business owner has 100 employees and gives all of them $1 an hour raise their bottom
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein They are the ones with all the risk and also the ones employing all the people. If the business goes under they could be ruined where the
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I agree with most of your statement. I don't believe it is up to us to tell a business owner how much he/she is allowed to make.
@MandyBTweets @Alyssa_Milano And now Dem Congress is refusing and could cause the end of DACA. The order was never meant to be permanent. It was written to be temporary
@onestopjosh @mdlandeene @NancyPelosi Could explain the way DC has been running recently.
@patriciocaca @mdlandeene @happy_chick222 @onestopjosh @NancyPelosi Rumor is Trump's and Hillary's trials will be running at the same time. Should be good for sweeps week
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein What happens in lean times when payroll exceeds income for the company?
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein And a living wage for experienced workers.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein If I am reading your message right, and I might not be because I have been traveling, you think there should be a min wage for new workers
@MandyBTweets @Alyssa_Milano Still. He could have killed it immediately but didn't. Now it is on congress, as it should have been years ago to do their job.
@Alyssa_Milano He could have killed it immediately, instead he gave Congress 6 months to do what they should have done years ago and passed a bill
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein But should they get paid as much as someone with more experience and time on the job?
@capmotion @1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein I blame Ron. 😀
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Every working person should be able to provide for their families. No question.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Also, who is going to take the hit for the wage increase?  The people or the business owners?
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I agree with your definition of a living wage but it also depends on where you live. Do you believe a 16 year old should make a living wage?
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein What is your definition of a living wage?
@RepAdamSchiff Then do your job and pass a law that will protect them, something you should have done years ago. You all have 6 months.
@Robert_Aderholt Something you guys should have been doing for the past 10 years. Way to get a late start. Now you have 6 months to do both.
@K_Darshea @JuddLegum That's kind of their job. The president doesn't make law, Congress does. So what you are saying is he's a pussy for making them do their job
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein With the divide in this country, this shit show would have happened under any president. This one just happens to be a social media moron.
@MEShifrin @NicolleDWallace And we all know rumors are always true, especially ones that reinforce what we believe about Trump.
@thehill So basically he is forcing Congress to do their job.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Obama care wasn't perfect and has degraded over time. It was never meant to be sustainable, only a path to single payer.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein It would resemble Obama's almost identically, the train wreck would be all the scandals and other crap that follows her like a poltergeist
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Either way we are watching a train wreck.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Trump is a train wreck but Hillary would have been a different type of train wreck
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Her performance could not have been worse but just as much of a cluster as the current administration.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Much like BO, her way was the only way and everyone else was wrong.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Not one bit. She says what she thinks we want to hear and then does what she wants, which is what all politicians do.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein In my opinion she felt entitled to the oval office because of her name. She was struggling against a socialist and didnt change her ways
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Sorry for the tweet storm.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein She didn't speak to the working class as much as she thought she did. They didn't relate to her.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein She lost because she took key states for granted and assumed they would be a tight race but ultimately go blue.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Therefore her loss but then goes on to blame Russia, Trump, her team, the DNC, even the data she obtained from the pacs that supported her
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein And that backfired. Everyone saw right their her and now she blames everyone except for herself for losing. She says it was her campaign and
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Like all politicians. She never intended to implement any if Bernie's platform, she only used them as talking points to win the vote
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Because she thought it would put her in a good spot politically. She is calculating and manipulative, like a good politician. She lies
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I don't give her credit because has shown less flexibility than you give her credit for. She only recently came out in favor of gay marriage
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein That's because he didn't want the job, he just wanted to win the primaries. He didn't think he had a chance against Hillary.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein No chance she would have as much self inflicted trouble but 100% she would have just as many issues from her previous questionable actions.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein The lesser of 2 evils is still evil, but she was the evil we knew. That was most of her problem.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Was definitely not the answer either.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein And in my opinion our govt stopped working for the people years ago and needed to be fixed. Is Trump the answer? 99% chance no, but Hillary
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Neither was a better choice. That's the issue I had. You could vote for a turd or a turd. Either way there would be a turd in office
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Maybe it was their way to bring in a third party to the mix but then the third parties give us Stein and Johnson. Major fail on all sides
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Were trying to lose this past election season
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein The only person Trump could have beat was Hillary and the only person Hillary had a shot against was Trump. It was like both major parties
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Their families drug thru the mud and every word they say to be scrutinized to no end.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein We need to find a system that will give better choices than we had. There are tons of qualified people who won't run because they don't want
@chelseahandler I don't think Kim Jung-un has twitter
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Except for you, so far we have had a great discussion about our differing opinions and I appreciate that.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein When they hear someone did not vote for Hillary they get mad and shut down any conversation.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein When libs hear someone voted for Trump they immediately start in with the you racist and hate people instead of listening to their reason
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I heard this on a podcast and agree with it, not all Trump supporters are nazis but all nazis are Trump supporters.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I will agree with you but the Dems need to stop classifying all Trump supporters as these A-Holes. It is the wrong message.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein And this is coming from someone with a very low opinion of people in general.
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein And not many new people are signing up for their idiotic group sessions. People are better than that
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein This was planned for 6 months and only hundreds showed up to carry torches and act like fools.  Their message of hate is a dying message
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Charlottesville was a terrible situation but one that had little to do with Trump. These morons have been having rally's since the 80's
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein I never said I was embarrassed by BO. I didn't agree with a lot of his opinion and thought he could have done more to unite the country.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Gerrymandering is done by both sides, Republicans are just worse about hiding it.
@1LightwaveTech @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein If he is ousted I will accept the inevitable I Told You So as long as you accept the same from me when he leaves office after his term.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Ok, do you really think it would only take $1million for a governor to do that?  That amount is nothing to them.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein And do you really think a governor would take just $1 million Rubles, or $17,386 American to change a vote?
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein That's the same as me telling you to read the Britbart article claiming Trump is gonna rescue 15 yellow lab from Houston kennels.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Why would I read that?  It is a biased outlet pushing their wishes on the people. Where is the proof?
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Dems do it too. Nothing happening right now is new. Dems might get some seats back but if things keep going this way it won't be enough.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein The polls were not tampered with last time. Where is your proof of such tampering?
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Part of me hopes this happens for you but I have a feeling the Dems are chasing emails and birth certificates on this one
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Remember according to both polls and media Hillary was going to win in a landslide.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein What are you basing this off of?  Can't count on polls. Media is doing what it does best and only telling part of the story.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Not to mention, do you really think the Dems want Pelosi to become the first woman president?
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Add another year for an investigation into Pence and that is the full term.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein There are a lot of ifs and hopes in that article. I still say it is never going to happen. Investigation will take 2 to 3 years just for DT
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Pelosi?  Oh Lord!  She isn't even in the top 18 in the succession line. Ryan and Hatch are 3 and 4. Carson and DeVos are even ahead of her.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein You are stretching again.
@CBSNews He needs to be placed on unemployment.
@FarcicalGuy @thehill True.
@FarcicalGuy @thehill True colors show when you're anonymous.
@FarcicalGuy @thehill You really think any of them voted for him the first time?
@KamalaHarris Jerry Brown even said that's a bad idea.
@mitchellreports Trump said all options are on the table. Didn't know all options does not include diplomatic solutions.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein But I don't think he is smart enough to bury messages in his speeches.  He is blunt and speaks his mind.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein I think we spend too much time reading into what Trump meant or didn't say instead of listening to what he says. He says a lot of dumb stuff
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Because of multi color. Liberal media would ask why does Trump hate all animals and bury that he said he likes zebra's in the last sentence
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein That is on both sides. Trump says he supports zebra's. Conservative media would say Trump loves all animals and his favorite is the zebra...
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein I will try to find the study after I get off work.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein None. All media has a bias that is determined by their consumers. Fox and CNN are equally biased to opposite sides. I can't watch either
@KamalaHarris You also have to be willing to listen and admit you don't have all the answers
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Fox is no more right than CNN is left and by MSNBC standards cnn is right of center. That is based off a study done earlier this year.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein One of the reasons I pay for Pandora. No news just music I want to hear.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein People only listen to media to reaffirm their beliefs. No one wants to hear contrasting views anymore.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein You need to include MSNBC and CNN, actually all paid "news" sources in that list too. No media fair and balanced. That's the problem
@NYCMayor @realDonaldTrump Same as all the other tax proposals in the past. Nothing new to see here
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Either is total obstruction at all costs. Yeah, it kind of worked for repubs this time but that doesn't mean it will work again.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein I am for supporters of both parties realizing their opinion won't work for all 330 million others in the country
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein I am for both parties opening their eyes realizing they are elected by us to negotiate on our behalf and do their jobs.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Hope DNC makes the right changes and does not repeat the past. 1st thing they need to realize, it's ok for others to have different opinions
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein And here we go with the assumptions and name calling. Never said I was in GOP side. They made a ton of mistakes which paved the way for DT
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein They backed the only candidate that could lose to Trump. Anyone else could have won.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Neither party is rooted in reality. None of our reps live like the rest of us do. They all get rich while in office.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein If the DNC was so in touch with the people it wouldn't of thrown all support behind a candidate that a high % of their base disliked
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Most of the statements are taken out of context and reported to the masses in a decieving manner. But I agree, they could communicate better
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein This is the opinion of a person who disagrees with their platform and is not willing to listen to anything they don't agree with.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein They can't have town hall because people of "the resistance" disrupt and make it impossible for their supporters to hear the message.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein After I read your posts I hear Rick Flair yelling WOOOOO!!!!!!
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein You're great. You even get me pumped and I don't agree with you. One thing for sure, more has to change for the DNC to have a shot in 20
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein You really think they are secure now?  Didn't podesta get hacked by a phishing email?  Smart...
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein I find that hard to believe given their inability to keep their mouths shut when it comes to anything negative about Trump.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Impeaching a president because you didn't vote for him is a slippery slope. Without proof of a crime even a Dem house won't do anything.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein What we have now isn't solid proof. Once there is solid proof of an impeachable offense he should be impeached. Until then we have 45 for 4
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein I really hate to see you like this.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein All this anticipation just to be let down because it's not gonna happen. Like a kid getting socks for Christmas instead of a bike
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Impeachment does not mean removal from office. See Bill Clinton for reference.
@1LightwaveTech @capmotion @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @SenFeinstein Never gonna happen. Dems might gain majority but the only time the President and Vice President leave office at the same time is end of term
@Quimby_Jones @Mr_Jackpots_ @active_50 @LadyLiberals @JaniceOinGA @ACLUVA The guy shooting the gun clearly was not in any danger and should be prosecuted. The guy throwing fire towards a crowd should be charged too
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Dems remind me of the repubs waiting for the Hillary emails to drop. You are gonna be just as disappointed as they were, but keep hoping...
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Keep dreaming. One day it might come true. 46 will probably be Dem but not before Trump or pence completes this term
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Unfortunately for your party a good portion have been naughty. if you get rid of 45 you get Pence
@1LightwaveTech @Nichola63513866 @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein Isn't the closest Dem 17 down the list. Good luck with that thought process.
@1LightwaveTech @JohnFit00782884 @capmotion @SenFeinstein The proof has been coming for 8 months. Nothing is gonna change. Don't have to like it but santa isn't delivering an impeachment for xmas
@Lisagallant10 @katkinson702 @VanJones68 So if someone doesn't verbally condemn they are by default condoning an action or a movement?
@Lisagallant10 @katkinson702 @VanJones68 The blood is on the individuals who were at the rally in support or in protest. They are responsible. no one else, Just them.
@KamalaHarris How about we fix K - 12 and then worry about college. Maybe more kids will qualify for scholarships if they actually learn in primary school
@AlexBednar3 @Slate They did.  They used passenger jets
@iliza To get it for free someone else has to pay. Who pays the bills for all the free stuff?  Free stuff is awesome but in the end we all pay more
@Alyssa_Milano Now you believe Russia?
@CSonafelt @kkelly120_kim @SethAbramson @RealMuckmaker What is your evidence to support this claim?
@traceracer @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend He tried at first then stopped and started clowning the other side.
@RurikVarangian @Jakeaustincooke @henny_s @the_lilhill @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Anyway, my kids will be waking up in a few hours and I need some sleep. Have a good night
@Jakeaustincooke @RurikVarangian @henny_s @the_lilhill @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend You responded with statistics. Their community is probably different than the average which guides their views on life.
@RurikVarangian @Jakeaustincooke @henny_s @the_lilhill @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend That doesn't mean they are wrong, that means they see things different.
@Jakeaustincooke @RurikVarangian @henny_s @the_lilhill @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Based on that you agree that all Trump supporters are violent racists. If it's true for one it's true for all, right?
@RurikVarangian @Jakeaustincooke @henny_s @the_lilhill @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Not at all. I have read everything you posted. I know you got blocked. I know why you were blocked.
@RurikVarangian @Jakeaustincooke @henny_s @the_lilhill @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend How am I missing the point?  You were trying to tell a person they were wrong because they didn't see things the same way.
@Jakeaustincooke @RurikVarangian @henny_s @the_lilhill @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend You should probably read the whole conversation before cherry picking what you want to reply to.
@Jakeaustincooke @henny_s @the_lilhill @RurikVarangian @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Those are averages which means some places are worse than the statistic. But you are educated so I'm guessing you already know that.
@Jakeaustincooke @henny_s @the_lilhill @RurikVarangian @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Do you know anything about the person you are replying to other than they are not white?  Those "facts" mean jack in minority communities
@Jakeaustincooke @henny_s @the_lilhill @RurikVarangian @Rosie909294 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Are you really trying to change someone else's reality with your perceptions?  Put the beer down and realize others have it harder than you
@sarahkendzior I tell my kids that politicians are nothing more that bullies with money. Raise them with respect for all people.
@thehill If they can endorse a candidate, they can pay taxes.
@WestGaylor It was nice talking to you. The kids are sleeping so I get to sleep also. Good night.
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend I am teaching him what I know. My wife loves when I cook and I love cooking for her.
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend I do my best, but the smoker in the garage is not my only one. Hard to pass up good bbq. My son likes to help me cook.
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Me too and I have twin 4 year olds so I feel like I'm 77
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend I hope in ours but will take my kids.
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend We do and it sucks for sure but we will get there.
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend All jokes aside, all parties have to be willing to listen in order to effect real change. I think we are close but could be wrong.
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Hoping she goes on a trip and I can put it together before she makes me take it back.
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Easier to ignore than talk about. Same reason I didn't tell my wife about the smoker I bought that's sitting unassembled in the garage.
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend No elected official since then has done Jack to bridge the gap because we have elected them to block at all cost
@WestGaylor @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend I agree, this country has always been divided but the gap has been growing since Bush v Gore.
@fr__nds @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend To say America is racist is wrong. To say parts of America is racist is more accurate.
@fr__nds @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend It's pretty clear. It means despite pockets of the country where racism is clear, the rest of the country is not racist.
@fr__nds @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend America as a whole is not racist just like France as a whole is not.
@fr__nds @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend So does France where they throw bananas at soccer players.
@rahgirl @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Not debatable it was in an interview at the end of his presidency. I will agree he did not call them the enemy but he did take shots.
@ExDHS @henny_s @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend This is going no where. You are determined to convince me the gop caused all the issues we have now. I disagree.
@ExDHS @the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend I know.
@ExDHS @henny_s @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend For sure and Dems would have fought it.
@ExDHS @henny_s @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Or, because Romney wasn't in office.
@henny_s @ExDHS @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend I hear you. Me too but I have to admit I had fun.
@henny_s @ExDHS @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Didn't mean to make you sigh...
@ExDHS @henny_s @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Why would GOP fight against a Romney care?  Party before country. Dems are guilty of it too.
@henny_s @the_lilhill @ExDHS @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend At the same time if Trump launched the ACA the Dems would have fought just as hard. Healthcare works at a state level but not at fed.
@ExDHS @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend I'm not blaming the black guy. I'm saying the former President could have done more and admitted to that.
@ExDHS @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Not as fruitless as what happened. It would have shown a willingness to work together which could have mended the gap a bit and prevented DT
@the_lilhill @henny_s @harrisonmarkey @_dannybob_ @Newtpnp @DiDaDo123456 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Addressing isn't the same as resolving.
@TylerJames248 @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Garland wasn't exactly a conservative. He was more conservative than others but still on the liberal side.
@DiDaDo123456 @the_lilhill @harrisonmarkey @Newtpnp @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend I will go to Vegas but no promises of going to a museum. The siren song of the craps table is just too beautiful and strong.
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend We have gone too deep into the hypothetical. It's like a ferris wheel. It moves, but doesn't go anywhere
@Elelith @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Somewhere along the road we all became obsessed with winning instead of what's best for everyone
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend That requires hiring another lawyer and the fact the law is still on the books and enforcible makes your chances of winning anything slim
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend They also have to tell their company what is happening. Depending on their field they might get fired.
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend They get arrested, go to jail, post bail have to hire an attorney, take time off of work to defend themselves in court.
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend But it wrecks the life of the individual arrested. Cop is ostracized but doesn't lose his lifestyle.
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Because all it takes is 1 bad cop to make an arrest based on that law. If it is on the books the cop can't be reprimanded
@the_lilhill @Newtpnp @TJM_III @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Just want to say thank you to all on this string. We have managed to discuss our different views without insults and name calling.
@Xurocken @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend No 1 group or person is entirely to blame. They all created the mess we are in now, which means we also contributed by electing them
@Newtpnp @the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Yup, my bad...
@Newtpnp @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend If the entire country is racist, that means you are racist too.
@Newtpnp @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend That's your opinion, I'm not trying to change it. My opinion is while there is still racism in backwards places, the entire country is not
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Because they are still on the books and can be enforced.
@the_lilhill @DiDaDo123456 @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Your biology, probably nothing. Your ethnicity definitely does.
@the_lilhill @TJM_III @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Racism is alive in America. If you don't see that then I suggest you look outside your boundaries a bit. IMO America is not racist though.
@Xurocken @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend McConnell is 1 person. There were maybe 10 that refused to work with Obama, not all GOP refused. At some point Obama stopped trying.
@CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @henny_s @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Dems to the rescue...  It ended because they all agreed they should probably get back to work and were close to losing their seats.
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend There are some racist laws in the country. They typically aren't enforced but they have not been removed.
@SkipToMyLou_00 @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Most of the time it is because he is being slammed for something Obama and Clinton have done or also do. I will never defend his tweets
@henny_s @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend I didn't hate him. I voted for him once and stand behind that decision. I didnt always support him but I dont support Trump always either
@henny_s @the_lilhill @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend I'm out on this one. Not my area to tell you how to feel and if you feel it is racist then it is racist.
@henny_s @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend 8 years. Same as Trump, but in his case maybe 4. His job is to get our elected officials working together.
@CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @henny_s @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend We elect people to negotiate on our behalf, not to force thru what we want.
@CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @henny_s @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Yes. And I remember being pissed about that. It could have been avoided if they were willing to talk.
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend I agree. I think states have a better understanding of what their people need. We do need fed govt to oversee states
@CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend He did try at first but later in his first term and thru the second he stopped. He carries as much blame as GOP.
@henny_s @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Nope. Wide awake and watching, just like I am now.
@the_lilhill @henny_s @CriesOfCons @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend They didn't block everything because eventually Dems took the house. Just like Dems aren't blocking everything now. They have 0 control
@CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend On this we agree. He is a train wreck but he is sitting president.
@henny_s @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Not arguing that point. I agree with you. If they were gonna block they should have been developing their plan. They failed.
@CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Get them all in a room and talk it out. Same thing every CEO does with board members. Negotiate.
@henny_s @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend 8 was enough
@dmosk253 @henny_s @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @BardJames084 @johnlegend He did pressure Congress. He also said thing like if you don't agree with me, I just don't know what you are thinking.
@henny_s @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend Now you are mad that Republicans had some say in ACA?  And you admit it is failing?
@henny_s @CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @BardJames084 @johnlegend His job is to bridge that gap. A select few decided to block everything but not all. He could have worked with the willing. He chose not to
@wheredthesodago @kristiderickson @johnlegend Are you saying you are smarter than everyone who voted for Trump?  Must be a tough burden to carry.
@kristiderickson @learh @johnlegend We will have one in just over 3 years
@kristiderickson @johnlegend Most of the time with someone who voted for Hillary.
@CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Trump is not the reason for the divide, he is contributing to a gap that has existed since Bush vs Gore.
@CriesOfCons @the_lilhill @dmosk253 @henny_s @BardJames084 @johnlegend Obama didn't do much to unite the parties either. He has even admitted he didn't reach across the aisle as much as he could have.
@SarahTheNasty @ericgarland @aliasvaughn @lulu_lemew @dark_wisdom_ Yeah, sure. Same thing was said a month ago, then a month before that and nothing has happened just like nothing will happen now.
@hardball @PhilipRucker They can. Trump is not a dictator.
@kylegriffin1 @floridarocket Is this a quote of a quote from and anonymous source?  It agrees with what I want so it must be true.
@SaylesJon @thehill @CNN @WhiteHouse At this rate cnn will = Trump within 6 months. They have pulled more stories in this past week than they have under 8 years of Obama.
@barb_culligan @yashar By this logic, I can shame you because I disagree with your political beliefs? Is this really what you are saying? Not a good message at all
@greta No chance of them working together when we elect them to blindly oppose the other side. This mess is on all of us.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump No but the left helps the poor to control the poor.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump The left is for the rich under the guise of supporting the poor.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump No, the majority is in the middle. The vocal majority is the left. I don't want far anything ever.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump We need to start electing people to represent the majority of us, not the hardcore left or right.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump I think it will be closer than you want it to be. We are still in the phase of electing to blindly follow or obstruct at all costs.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Lose all of either conservative and they lose their seat
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump If they get behind Trump they lose all moderates. If they abandon him they lose all hard core blind supporters.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump They have a guy in office wrecking their chances of reelection.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump When you tread a fine line you eventually trip.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump If they had a chance to do it they would.  They hate him too. Probably more than libs because he is head of their party.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump He did donate though. If he keeps it up he can't be touched. If he donates all foreign $ he can't be touched. We will see what he does.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump I also like to talk to people like you because I appreciate your opinions. I might not agree with them but I respect them.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Um...thanks?  I know he is a train wreck. I didn't vote for him but I also want solid proof before I get on the impeacent bandwagon.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump You don't know that he won't. He already donated his first 3 months pay.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Until they stop kissing his as which means Trump is not loyal to anyone.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Hillary would have fired him on day 1. We all know Trump is an idiot. Comey was gonna be fired no matter what. Trump is not loyal to anyone.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump His daughter getting 100 million for what?  As long as he donates all foreign payments as he said he would there is no issue.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump The invisible tapes were another example of trump being dumb
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Comey was gonna get fired no matter who won.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump No all media is biased because they cater to their base and get money based on viewers.
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump People to work together instead of obstruct the other party
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Let's bypass that and move on to the party where we agree something has to change and this divide will only get worse until we get elect
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Are we to the attack the non liberal portion of the conversation?  Call me uninformed and dumb because you can't provide solid proof?
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Watch something other than CNN or MSNBC and you might learn something also. I don't watch fox. All media is biased. What else do you have?
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Half is a stretch. He fired Comey knowing the investigation wouldn't stop. What witness did he intimidate? Proof of accepting foreign $?
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump I am awake and know what is going on. I am just not on the impeach Trump train and won't be until there is proof of something impeachable
@GhostWalker40 @jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump 3 presidents. My point was although Trump lies more than most he is not the first liar to sit in the oval office.
@TOPPINRAY @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump What law did he break on Twitter?  Asking for a friend...
@jmkrej @Joe_dragonfly @Garywrjr @crittaluvva @NancySinatra @dfa73 @realDonaldTrump Lies: "you can keep your plan", "you can keep your Dr", "rates will drop","no new taxes", "I didn't have sexual relations with that woman"
@maxgarciajr @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @BarackObama Remember Bush Sr's no new taxes. How about Bill Clinton's I did not have sexual relations with that woman. Or Obama's you can keep your plan
@MMFlint Kind of racist isn't that Mr Moore?
@KNX1070 About time JB did something that makes sense
@RVAwonk All the data that has rolled in there is 0 evidence of collusion, obstruction would be hard to prove and we know about Russian interference
@chrislhayes But it shouldn't be at such a high rate. Just my opinion.
@chrislhayes I was taxed on the money I used to invest. I assumed all the risk. Not saying I shouldn't pay tax on the return if there is one...
@perlmutations This is one thing we can agree on.
@MaestroGaeta @chrislhayes But can Steven Segal do the splits across 2 chairs?
@chrislhayes Ok USA!!!
@DaveWeasel @NRA You're right.  Let's take guns away from everyone. Only cops and govt officials should be allowed to carry.
@CheetoLovers @bebp @sarahkendzior @sartorialskwirl What if the non voter wants to vote republican?
@sarahkendzior Libs are contributing to the disenfranchising of the base just as much as conservatives. The comments made by both extremes are disgusting.
@MichaelJSuich @heidihamilton True story. I just called the empty toilet paper roll dude.
@bakerlarry84 @FoxNews @POTUS Bottom line: Dems still lost in all districts and should have won at least 2. They still have over a year to mess up 2018 chances too.
@LouJujutsu @thehill That wasn't me expressing hope for a switch in 2018. In my opinion every state should have an equal number of reps from both sides.
@LouJujutsu @thehill That's as effective as nearly winning the lottery. In the end I just wasted money and dreams.
@nicholasvirzi @nytimes Aren't all politicians liars?
@ClayTravisJewBe @JoeNBC Once they invade your taxes will rise. You should hope they stay where they are.
@bobcsko @dbongino Is there such thing as a liberal Patriot?
@bobcsko @dbongino So you want a country run by people who think as you do and anyone else can leave?  Funny, liberals want the same thing.
@bobcsko @dbongino How are they trying to overthrow the government?  By running for office?  They aren't rushing the Whitehouse with torches. Majorities change
@bobcsko @dbongino That's the problem. It shouldn't be only about winning. This is a stupid war between parties and it will only hurt us in the end.
@kkaliszewski @Keith_Andone @thehill Is it me or does Handel look like Margot Martindale?
@msdebmn @VoteDocBryant @thehill @realDonaldTrump Wow!  What did you think you would accomplish with that bit of racism?
@mamasittalove @thehill I agree, the stupidity and childishness on both sides needs to stop. We need to remember it's not about who won or lost. It's about people.
@mamasittalove @thehill Stop. This was happening way before Trump ran. I remember people getting into fights over Bush vs Gore campaign. This one is not on him
@mamasittalove @thehill This is not on Trump. This is on the psychos who decide they want to harm others. Trump did not tell a Bernie bro to shoot anyone
@thehill How about telling libs to quit shooting at lawmakers?
@rickygervais How Dare You!
@Rcmellish @Alyssa_Milano Wouldn't a dictatorship require all people to purchase a product or service and penalize those that don't?
@LittleVioletBel @justray01 @Alyssa_Milano He was quoting Nancy Pelosi talking about the ACA
@RWPUSA @floridarocket It actually does list where his debt are. Germany and US banks. Do you think if Russia was listed it wouldn't be front page everywhere. https://t.co/FjbNs9jwNK
@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump No it isn't. Do you really want to see everything he tweets anyway?
@BeauWillimon @realDonaldTrump With an Income of $594M to add to his $1.4B in assets, a Debt of $315M falls just short of the definition of a shit-ton.
@AK47fan_91 @Pyrotese @vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei You would think gun violence is drastically increasing if you only follow liberal news sources.
@Evan_McMullin @morgfair Both sides lost that fight years ago
@vivianmedina67 @Pyrotese @AK47fan_91 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei Obama's policy was never fully put into effect.
@AK47fan_91 @Pyrotese @vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei Ok tough guy. That's exactly what I saw, your intolerance for stupidity. Not someone who can't have a conversation without attacking.
@AK47fan_91 @Pyrotese @vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei What are you exposing about yourself when you call a woman stupid and dumbass?
@AK47fan_91 @Pyrotese @vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei Didn't say it was tough guy, but you are trying to demean a woman you have never met over the internet.
@Pyrotese @AK47fan_91 @vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei Not you. The other person.
@Pyrotese @AK47fan_91 @vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei She is, but there is no need to call complete strangers a dumbass.
@AK47fan_91 @vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei Does it feel good to call someone you have never met a dumbass?  Nice internet muscles tough guy.
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump We wouldn't have any politician left if that happened. The anarchists would be happy
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @HillaryClinton Thank you. This is why I engage in conversation. I get blocked a lot because people are not willing to have a civil discussion.
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @HillaryClinton She did have a ton of experience to consider but the with so much crap swirling around her some of it had to be true.
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @POTUS44 He had 8 years to accomplish what he wanted. So far Trump has only been in office for 5 months.
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump I agree with this statement. People have to want to work to find a job.
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump I didn't vote for this man. I didnt vote for her either. My opinion was both would be a train wreck
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump I don't buy that completely. People want change, but only change they agree with. A large part of the population felt dismissed by Obama
@iliza What did I miss?
@vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei You mean the one that was passed with bipartisan support?
@MikeTango22314 @GeorgeTakei Last i saw it was the antifa trying to shut down speeches from people they don't agree with.
@vivianmedina67 @MikeTango22314 @jdmeac @datfreakyderp @whiskyjack42 @whaleerules88 @GeorgeTakei Yes, let's take guns from law abiding citizens and only allow criminals and cops to carry. We all know they can be trusted.
@hardball I think hope is the proper word, not think.
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump people want more change because there was not enough under Obama. People still want transparency in govt, but there's no chance of that ever
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump I am not happy with Trump. Didn't vote for him but I can see why he won. Obama was elected on hope and change.
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @HillaryClinton She has done some great things. She was also surrounded by a cloud of muck and lies. Like when she said she always supported gay marriage
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump He was not the first to do that. Remember Bush Sr?  Read my lips, no new taxes?  Or Obama saying he was closing Guantanamo?
@RealAlexJones Except for the part where he told Harris she was making him nervous.  Other than that, sure
@GotBrent @Alyssa_Milano If only the Dems ran a better campaign or candidate
@DeaqonJames @Alyssa_Milano Because Clinton lied under oath. As of yet, Trump has not.
@richardprankin @Alyssa_Milano @washingtonpost I would say since nothing has stuck and it appears there is no collusion with Russia, he currently is not tired of winning.
@Alyssa_Milano Only difference if Hillary won would be the party crying for impeachment.
@Slate Didn't she move in yesterday?
@KTLA Wasn't aware that was an option.
@tedlieu I thought "I don't recall" and "I don't remember" were acceptable answers in a hearing.
@davidfrum What about Illinois, where the guy was from? Did he buy the gun when he arrived in Virginia?
@SydneyLive5 @Bluepuppy @SenSanders Please tell this to Fox, CNN, And MSNBC
@AnthonyIrwinLA Anyone betting on McGregor is betting with their hearts. I want to see Mayweather lose but know it won't happen in a boxing match.
@guardian How about it is a tragic event for America that hopefully brings us together instead of driving us further apart?
@KMOXKilleen @KNX1070 Last I checked this wasnt a bar. It was a park full of unarmed politicians playing baseball, and 1 faux tough guy.
@jodiecongirl @BlackandBlueCom @WylieBear1 Difference is you're an adult who chose to be in public view. He's a kid who had no choice and shouldn't have to defend himself to an adult
@kylegriffin1 @floridarocket He is not the first to not recall a lot
@ForgetTrump2020 @DonaldJTrumpJr You didn't see it because you weren't looking for it. You probably didn't even know the MN play did it because it wasn't in central park NY
@KamalaHarris @Alyssa_Milano Did you have an issue with it when Hillary gave the same answers during her hearings?
@thehill Which part bothers him more?
@SethAbramson She has been calling for his termination since before he was confirmed.
@MarkRuffalo Still waiting for hard evidence. Can't convict without it.
@hmfaigen Don't let them win
@LanceStrasser Speaking of pedophilia, are all Catholics pedophiles because some of their priests touched little boys?
@LanceStrasser I never defended the acts committed by the extremist groups. I will defend the peaceful people who happen to be in the same religion.
@LanceStrasser But go ahead and keep trying to paint me as you wish I was.
@LanceStrasser Saying all people who follow a religion adhear to the letter if their Bible is misleading and wrong.
@LanceStrasser Not what I'm saying at all. There was a period of time where they were. I'm saying just because it is in a book doesn't mean they all follow
@LanceStrasser Deuteronomy 17 verse 3 thru 5	Deuteronomy 13 verse 6 thru 16	Numbers 31		We can cherry pick verse all day.
@LanceStrasser Just saying grouping all members of a religion based off a few is wrong. But you take it as you will.
@LanceStrasser @HuffPost @samanthastorey Most Muslims are great people. Some have perverted the religion, same as churches like Westboro Baptist church twist Christianity
@Agressivehongi @RighteousWing @DaveWeasel I assume any man taking selfies has no penis. Gun is irrelevant
@BlueVotr @Alyssa_Milano 3.5 years at least
@sullivanclean @Alyssa_Milano @justinhendrix @MaxineWaters Impeach him for what?
@mikeohio2323 @Alyssa_Milano Clinton was impeached
@Trumpbits That record was broken in his first week
@Karnythia How dare you have an opinion that differs from mine!  Ok. I'm over it.
@RighteousWing Fake news. There is no way 2 different women want to be with Cruz. Just sayin...
@nknkoo @KC11A18A @thehill Lynch will go down before Trump does.
@dangermarin @Sethrogen I don't understand people blocking someone because they don't agree with them. I want to talk to people with different opinions.
@AoDespair @TheBigPlus1 With regular people you have no prior opinion like everyone does with both Trump and Comey.
@AoDespair @TheBigPlus1 You can't read into what was not said because you will only confirm your own beliefs. Maybe with regular people, but they aren't regular
@RVAwonk @morgfair Wouldn't matter if there were tapes. Lib side would never believe they weren't doctored if he isn't on tape asking for both.
@JuddApatow Congrats. I just passed the 10 year mark with my wife yesterday.
@PKrukonis @BevH111 @KamalaHarris exchanges were unstable long before 45 took office. I'm not a fan of the new idea but to say 45 is responsible for current state is wrong
@nycjaneyvee @TheAtlantic @ariabendix How is she a patriot?  She stole data and released to the press.
@Markmywords9002 @steph93065 Not all his memos were classified. He didn't leak the ones that were. Not illegal to hand notes to a friend.
@TheAtlantic @ariabendix Guess i win this round. https://t.co/k61MZesvQk
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix And Trump does have the ability. That's why he is not getting railed for what he supposedly did.
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix Election tampering was known. That's why she is dumber than most. Leaked information most people knew about.
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix Guess what. She didn't hack. She was trusted with that data and broke the trust. Had she hacked it she would probably be free, and Russian
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix Because it is an ongoing investigation.
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix Both are just as bad. Difference is Trump has the ability to do what he did, Reality didn't. Right or wrong, she was wrong
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix They were covering it up because it was classified.  That means they were doing their job
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix Things have been wrong in govt for many years, not just the past few months. This whole thing is ridiculous
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix Ok I will tell you what is legal and illegal. Leaking classified docs to the press is illegal and worthy of jail
@shelly2161 @TheAtlantic @ariabendix Yes. She broke the law. We knew there was tampering and she leaked classified information to the media.  She is not a hero.
The best part about #ComeyDay is each side claiming victory over the other. Face it, you both lost
@brianklaas @floridarocket I don't know...those Clinton's are sneaky smart.
@greta Don't you know people don't like to read or hear stuff they don't agree with?
@The_Autism_Dad @realDonaldTrump Maybe he pulled a Clinton and smashed his phone.
@KenDilanianNBC @morgfair We all know he is now. Hence the special prosecutor
@mitchellvii Is it really a leak if the info is not classified?
@SavannahGuthrie Because they have to justify their pay check
@michellemalkin He also stated Trump did not do anything illegal. Not impeachable.
@limonpoker @benshapiro Not yet anyway
@limonpoker @benshapiro The true record shows Trump won. Popular vote is as meaningless as your insults. You might be at war with Russia but the rest of us aren't.
@limonpoker @benshapiro Accept that and move on. Focus on the next election that Dems might have a chance at winning.
@limonpoker @benshapiro Been called worse by better. I know she got the most popular votes. Trump got more votes that matter. She lost. He is your President.
@limonpoker @benshapiro Nice tactic, go to name calling and trying to demean. She got the most votes and is still sitting out of the Whitehouse. Great job. Next
@limonpoker @benshapiro Hillary didn't get screwed, she screwed herself. Impeaching Trump, if it happens at all gets you president Pence not president Hillary.
@limonpoker @benshapiro Russia is known. They need Trump to be complicit in their acts. Without Trump connection to Russia they will need a new story
@limonpoker @benshapiro That's not what he says. He says there is no collusion, which to this point he is right.
@limonpoker @benshapiro You are right, but none of them have connected Trump or his campaign to the interference.
@Alyssa_Milano That is how all of this should be viewed. Don't try to read into a vague answer. Accept it for what he said, not for what he didn't say.
@ijackiejohnson @Alyssa_Milano I hope for their case that turns out to be true.
@Alyssa_Milano States lost the right to discriminate against gays the minute they charged a fee for a marriage license. It's no longer a "religious" ritual
@ijackiejohnson @Alyssa_Milano That's only because it is relatively new in comparison. Give them time. They will catch up to straight marriage eventually.
@ezraklein And the Dems effort to spin the other way is just as dangerous. If our elected officials dont have higher standards than this, we're screwed
@Dubs_Duh @GoneGirlDev Thank you for posting this. My kids aren't in school yet, I have twin 4 year olds but I am already worried about this situation.
@DavidCornDC They said they never felt pressure to break the law, this would include lying.
@ThatChrisRyan It would sum perfectly up how ridiculous these times really are
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano Blocked in 3...2...1
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano If Trump is partially to blame if your kid turns out bad, does he get credit if your kid turns out good?
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano As a parent it is my job to teach my kids to be human. If they act in a way I find inappropriate it is my fault if I don't correct them.
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano What does Trump do because he likes to do it?  Teach kids how to be bullies?
@radbcc @Alyssa_Milano @robreiner @ReformedBroker @NancySinatra @morgfair Oh no!  They must be plotting their lines of questions over 2 scoops of ice cream. Not everything is a red flag. Sometimes dinner is dinner
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano And please show me how I deflected accountability with my post.
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano The ones setting the example should be the parents. If kids mimick what they see it is our responsibility to correct them.
@JPK3714 @ibkozi @Alyssa_Milano Trump raises my kids because he likes to?  Sweet. I have been looking for a nanny to help out while I take naps
@MirFerg @Alyssa_Milano @UnfollowTrump Instead you can follow in the shadows. Yeah, that's not creepy
@Sara_Tonyn @Alyssa_Milano @DearAuntCrabby So everyone who has blocked someone else is a coward?
@CarolsDaughter9 @LTZBusa @Alyssa_Milano His message is all over the media no matter what. I'm sure the blocked will stll get the message.
@HenryJPalmer3rd @funder Did you expect him to tell the truth?
@natespuewell @Trumpbits Taking money from charity is terrible. How much money donated to Clinton foundation specified for Haiti actually made it to Haiti?
@Alyssa_Milano The problem with reading into vague answers is you always come up with what you want to hear but in reality it is a mix of both sides.
@RufusKings1776 @benshapiro Yeah, this is the part I find petty too. Maybe it was said in jest and is out of context here.
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano Please don't reproduce and if you have already multiplied, please stop.
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano That right there is a lack of accountability. Accepting some blame but pointing to outside influences to justify. AKA bad parenting
@Kimbly73 @Alyssa_Milano Parents are to blame. Just like you are to blame for judging people you don't know assuming they are uneducated based on who they support.
@ibkozi @JPK3714 @Alyssa_Milano So if your kid pushed another at the playground whose fault is it?  Yours for raising a kid who thinks that is ok or Trump's?
@kaslina @Alyssa_Milano They are getting it from their parents only. Kids of conservative parents aren't the only bullies. Libs are doing their fair share too
@Alyssa_Milano Now it's Trump's fault people raise A-hole kids?  How about parents are setting the wrong example for kids by being intolerant DB's
@Makesickloggins Don't you want to see the magic as it happens?
@perlmutations When did Russia become enemy #1? Obama and liberals laughed at Romney for saying they were the biggest threat in 2012.
@kylegriffin1 It's almost like he just signed it to keep a promise and is doing everything he can to say the opposition didn't let him put it thru
@SeeIenaGomezz @neverknownfacts R
@The_Autism_Dad @realDonaldTrump The only person you are depending on is the same one you wanted fired in Oct?  He isn't going to say anything close to what you want to hear
@leahmcelrath @morgfair She is going to trial for something everyone already knew happened. Future Leaders of America...
@samfbiddle @YourAnonNews Or ties to Trump
@Alyssa_Milano We already know this. What is missing is any collusion by team Trump.
@uncle_luigi @CNNPolitics Remember when Trump was talking about voter fraud and he was basically laughed at?  Good times.
@kurteichenwald @Trumpbits "May have" is the new "definitely did"
@neilpX Some would argue the same laws would also prevent Hillary from taking office.
@RonBalicki Is it possible to believe in climate change while not believing it is necessary to send unknown amounts of money to other nations?
@cmkahuna @Silvergirl1072 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump I looked and don't think it played as big a role as people like to say. They need a boogy man and he is the closest person besides herself
@cmkahuna @Silvergirl1072 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump If he had a major impact, that would have been seen in the popular results.
@cmkahuna @Silvergirl1072 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump IMO, When his letter came out the voters were decided. He might have swayed a couple from her to a 3rd party but not enough to matter.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump I'm anxious to watch but he is still bound by confidentiality so will not answer any questions of value.
@cmkahuna @Silvergirl1072 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump He was not responsible for her loss by himself. It was a combination of ick, not just him.
@MrMomforNow @TedLWilliams @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Kfc washed down with some Kool aid sounds good about now
@Alyssa_Milano Wow. Next thing you will tell me is Yelp isn't really good for accurate reviews and businesses have to pay to take down fake bad reviews.
@JibsStein @AriShaffir Griffin ruined herself a long time ago.
@ToneLoc108 @AriShaffir Curt Schilling was fired from ESPN for agreeing with North Carolina's bathroom law. What Maher and Griffin did were far worse.
@rickygervais If it were only that easy to change minds.
@jmarkwalk @jeremyscahill We started down that slope years ago
@latimes At least now we know where the additional gas tax and registration fees will be going. You're welcome China.
@lizzbeth5301 @latimes Exactly!  We will put adult diapers on our country when necessary.
@ScandalSheet @iliza @kathygriffin Not defending her at all. It was a disgusting act. And my mom said nice abs mean little pecker
@ScandalSheet @iliza @kathygriffin That is how you took it. I took it as she is a moron who doesn't want to work for a while. Are you really scared of a 90 lb comedian?
@JeffW1964 @iliza @kathygriffin Those sending threats are just as bad. No one has done worse since they're not in the public eye. Nugent doesn't count. He scares everyone.
@ScandalSheet @iliza @kathygriffin It was not a call to violence, it was a disturbing publicity stunt. Stop reading into it deeper than it was, and put your shirt down.
@thundercat696 @iliza @kathygriffin they were both in on it and no one thought it was a bad idea. Why should we go after anyone?  She will suffer the consequences on her own.
@frankwestwood @KatrinaPierson To be fair, he does make himself and easy target.
@marglarson2105 @buster_cult @thehill Been the same for a lot longer than that
@buster_cult @thehill And people think it is totally ok for a somewhat celebrity to pose as she did. There, I finished for you since you ran out of space
@JimmieJohnson I think the easy button is on the right.
@MrsC_46 @SkyNews Disturbing as it was it is not a hate crime and is covered under 1a. It is the same free speech being shot down in places like Berkely
@Slate Yes. It is all Trump's fault!  No one has to be accountable anymore, as long as you blame Trump.
@Melissa32137 @thehill You should be pissed she allowed him this gift of being the excuse of choice.
@GodzStr8Shooter @thehill I can her her and Bloom on the walk back to the office. "I think that went well. Great Job!"
@PFTompkins Me too. I think every gun owner should have control over their gun.
@iliza That can be said for both parties.  What she did was disturbing but nothing is worthy of death threats. People need to stop
@Alyssa_Milano Looks like someone needs to increase the frequency of their therapy sessions.
@JackPosobiec She is experiencing the consequences of her actions which are protected by 1a. Death threats are ridiculous and need to stop.
@Alyssa_Milano May risk. Read the title.
@USATODAY He knows if he does declare June as Pride month the liberal side will immediately disagree.
@mcuban IF what he said is true and the number of mines shut down here are offset by the mines open elsewhere, how does that help the climate?
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 For some reason your replies aren't showing up in my notifications anymore. Nice talking to you. I appreciate your opinions. Thank you.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 I applaud you for that. People do need to grow up and not judge others for not voting as they did.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 why judge someone you don't know?  We agree on a lot but because I didn't vote for your candidate I am a terrible person. Doesn't make sense
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Agree but some voted against her because they felt she was not the right candidate too.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Not voting for someone I cannot support is irresponsible?  Voting for someone I can't support because it is popular is wrong.
@arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Did I say that?  Nope. I didn't. You did. I said she was a bad candidate
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Yes, my single vote in CA is responsible. At least I voted. That has to count for something. I refuse to vote for people I can't support.
@ConstanceQueen8 @KamVTV @SandraTXAS @LVNancy @JrcheneyJohn @SpecialKMB1969 @LeahR77 @mikandynothem @GeorgiaDirtRoad @Corrynmb @American1765 There were consequences. She lost her job at CNN and will lose a lot of money. It was disgusting, not criminal just like the Obama hangings
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Most of my friends are in your boat.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Good for you. I will never judge you for that. But you will judge me for my dislike of her.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 For sure. Petty as hell and they should have been voted out.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Yes. People were helped by it but when the entire population is impacted good is not good enough.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 My vote had no impact on you.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 That's the problem. They didn't run. No legit person wants to run because of what they will go thru. Instead we got these 2
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Nothing is without flaws. I think more should have been done to keep insurance companies from being able to pull out.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Agree.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Kinks are pot holes and can be easily fixed. Issues are quick sand. No way to know how deep until you hit bottom.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 I could not bring myself to vote for either of them. I have issues with both of them. Voted 3rd party and i don't think I wasted my vote.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 I do think she was a bad candidate. I also think Trump was a terrible one. There are many far .or qualified people other than those 2.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 There will always be kinks but there were known issues when this was released.  Kinks are fine, issues are not.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 At the same time it was released with flaws. Something that impacts 100% of the population should have been closer to perfect than it was.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 I have lot of issues with the right and just as many with the left. I live in the middle and the extremes scare me.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 The extremes from both sides are the problem.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Also agree here.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 I agree.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 The ACA was based off a republican idea, that's what people forget.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 You were elected based on a lie.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 I do. Imo If you are voted into office based on your platform and then either stop fighting for or completely drop the issue that is wrong.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 That bothers me. They run on one platform and completely drop it once in office.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Am I a racist in your opinion?  Based off the limited conversation we have had.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 The extreme right is as you say. The extreme left is just as blind. Not all his supporters are extreme.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 I agree. But they aren't the only hypocritical party. All our elected officials have a public stance and another in Chambers.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 So you like not knowing what our leaders are doing?  I think we need to know more.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Quit making points I agree with. He is his own worst nightmare.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 No he isn't but there was a better shot at transparency than she offered.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Once again we are in agreement. Not the point.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Not arguing that point. I agree with you there. Media should not have any kind of bias. If they do they are entertainment, not news.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 But some change was necessary. Obama was elected on hope and change. Nothing changed as far as govt transparency.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 That's where you lose me. Some are but most aren't and lumping them all together is just as wrong.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 They chose change. Media was and still is biased against Trump because their viewers lean left. That's where they get their money.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Not everyone who voted for him is a misogynistic racist. She told her truth dut didn't relate to people who were hurting.
@arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Not at all. The fact that you think that is funny. Just because my opinion is not yours I must be a sexist jerk.
@HollyontheMove @arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 Welcome to the party. He ran a better campaign than she did. He catered to his base and also the working class. She only catered to her base
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 Both. She did mess up with her emails. Also for ignoring the working class and Not being more personable.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 That would have been awesome too.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 I don't demand anything, I do expect our leaders to be accountable for their actions. None of our leaders are accountable for anything.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 See!  It's not all bad.  Can you imagine Trump having Hillary as vp?
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Gerrymandering is wrong and how reps get away with it is baffeling. Maybe we should go back to winner is pres, runner up is vp. 😉
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 You see it but are not willing to accept someone disagrees with you. If they dont agree they must be dumb.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 I agree. We also need to start listening to each other instead of waiting for our turn to talk. Moderates in govt are not a bad thing.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 I live in SoCal and most of my friends are liberal. They were appalled that some people in middle states saw things different than they do.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Our govt should work for all people and the people should recognize their way isn't the best for all.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 We need to recognize people in different states have different needs that one party caters to and the other ignores.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 I also want to say I appreciate being able to have a decent conversation with you. Thank you.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Bernies position has never changed since he first took office. I dont agree with him but he is consistent.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 I get what you are trying to point out, I don't agree with you. Not that Bernie was a better candidate but I think he could have beat Trump
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Still. Superdelegates counted in the results. Polls don't matter as we learned this past November.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Those are pols not results.  SD's were counted in results.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Out up a legit candidate and I will vote for them. Trump was great on TV, terrible president. HC has too much muck around her, True or not
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 I disagree that she didn't have a hand in it. Bill did and she has his ear. She also had DWS and Obama.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Her lead was because of superdelegates not popular vote.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 I didn't vote for her or Trump because neither was the right candidate and both would be a train wreck. I voted 3rd party
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 All I am saying is she is not clean. She has more deamons than you are willing to admit.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Doesn't matter, he was still in it. I get that he isn't now and never was a Dem, only ran as a Dem because independents never have a shot.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 This is what wrong with the extremes. Not willing to see the other side. Immediately jump to mocking instead of engaging.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 Is your opinion Hillary has never done anything wrong?  My opinion is there is too much crap around her for it to all be lies.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Getting CNN question ahead if time is normal campaign banter?  Bringing up ways to bring down another Dem candidate is normal banter?
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Because Trump was doing more damage than WikiLeaks could possibly have done.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 Again, WikiLeaks was because of things she and her campaign had done. Had she not done some of that Trump would have lost.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Those are the extreme right wing morons and no, the middle all saw that for what it was. That did not change votes.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 The Comey letter had an impact but not a huge impact in my opinion and was because of the investigation of her emails.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 She is ultimately to blame for her loss. Everything that she feels impacted her was done because of her actions. Nothing else really matters
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 I know what you are saying. Just felt you needed a quick bump in blood pressure this morning.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 That is a question only she can answer.
@KimDotcom @andersonDrLJA We allowed that to happen by accepting the T's &amp; C's. Every item, app or website that makes life a bit easier also steals a bit of privacy
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 Not really. It is a subtle deflection of blame. She says she is to blame but so are theses things...she should stop at I am to blame.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 Also, dont they vote republican anyway?
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 The interference is not acceptable but was also because of her mistakes.
@bryanp77 @HAM_Renegade @NateSilver538 Never been there and don't know anyone who is from there so I have to take your word on it.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 That is not accepting blame. That is saying I hit my brother but they hit me first.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 I agree, a group is only as smart as it's dumbest member. Some of the blame for her loss falls on her and she has not accepted that out loud
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 And "Pennsyltucky" isn't a majority of the poulation.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 My sister in law lives there. I also have friends from there.
@HAM_Renegade @bryanp77 @NateSilver538 Some yes but not most. The states she took for granted do not fall into those groups.
@bryanp77 @NateSilver538 I agree to some extent, but she does need to accept some blame. If misogyny and racism were to blame how did she win the popular vote?
@arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 She also lost  because people like you assume anyone who disagrees with you is an idiot instead of a person with different needs
@arealshilljoy @schroedertony @NateSilver538 She lost because she didn't campain as well as Trump. She came across as robotic and cold. She didn't speak to the middle class.
@latimes This is dumb.
@nycmally @jfreewright Got to love not having the chance to respond to a tweet because you have been blocked.    https://t.co/LlEuwSgupq
@nycmally @jfreewright You're right. It is totally his fault someone made a decapitated head that looks like him, posed with it and posted the pic for comedy
@kittylerspeare @jfreewright @OaflingDavidSMa Fox news, duh...
@junkets313 @jfreewright Obama's did privately address the negativity with their kids telling them there are some bad things out there and to ignore it.
@Cali4niaDreams I take that back. You might be right. In media gay is more valuable than female.
@Cali4niaDreams No, it isn't. Gilbert Gottfried and Billy Bush were both justifiably fired for things they said. Neither were as bad as what Griffin did.
@Cali4niaDreams Not at all. Sorry you feel that way.
@Cali4niaDreams Not true at all. He would have been fired faster than Griffin was.
@pennycentury @Kiwigirl58 @activist360 Get help
@JakiBaptiste @activist360 @ecclesias It is a sick mind that thinks hanging or beheading someone they disagree with is ok. It is a weak mind that supports the same acts.
@JakiBaptiste @activist360 @ecclesias I disagree. You are glossing over an entire middle that is just as offended by the Obama stuff as this.
@pelverud @activist360 She should have thought about what it would detract from before she had the idea to pose.
@MartiniDude @activist360 If anyone in the public eye did that there would be backlash. Instead it is a backward redneck whos opinion stays in the trailer park
@jmflatham @activist360 Trump saying his son was freaked out by a pic of his beheaded dad = using him as a shield? More like stating a fact. It was a disturbing pic
@JakiBaptiste @activist360 @ecclesias Only one was Ted Nugent. no one takes him seriously since cat scratch fever. If Griffin was holding O's head the outrage would be the same.
@Kiwigirl58 @pennycentury @activist360 Any depiction of anyone hanging or beheaded is sick. Protected by the 1st, but still sick and disturbing.
@Alyssa_Milano Covfefe is really ancient russain script for you are all idiots.
@Makesickloggins @emilynussbaum @Sulliview I think this applies to the majority of America.
@NancySinatra @tribelaw Kind of how some felt when Obama was running things, but they were all nutjobs and not worth of being listened to.
@xtrixcyclex @TeaPainUSA @paradexes They might do any or all of the above, but chances are they will do nothing and people are just looking for a reason to panic and cry foul.
@monte1223 @Alyssa_Milano @kathygriffin Bush was hung and burned in effigy. Obama was hung. Trump is beheaded.  None of this is new and all of it is disturbing and disgusting.
@juliemason Jokes are the new hate speech
@caseycdutch @JaynePenelope What is facist about reporting someone who is shouting about committing a crime? Would you let someone drive if they brag about being drunk?
@tedlieu If he falisified docs he should be fired and prosecuted, but since when is incompetence a disqualifying factor for a govt job?
@growsomepls777 @kylegriffin1 @TruthEqualsFact They are kids acting how they think their parents would, not from their own beliefs.
@growsomepls777 @kylegriffin1 @TruthEqualsFact They are, but you stated the ones who refused we're geniuses which would imply those who stayed are not.
@perlmutations Macron says it, HERO!  Trump does it, RUSSIA!  Not a trump fan. Didn't vote for him either but come on.
@OG_HAMBURGHINI @Jimusmc @perlmutations We did, after they used chemical weapons on their people.
@dandrezner It will never happen.  No intent to break the law.
@Slate You mean the Bernie supporter who wanted to kill all who voted for against Bernie?
@debbienunn11 @kylegriffin1 @EdSkipper You do realize not 1 Trump EO has been put into law yet, right?  We are still working with laws passed by the Obama administration.
@debbienunn11 @kylegriffin1 @EdSkipper My eyes are wide open. I look at both sides, not just the one I agree with to confirm my opinions.
@debbienunn11 @kylegriffin1 @EdSkipper Really?  Where?
@debbienunn11 @kylegriffin1 @EdSkipper This government is broken, not because of trump. It is broken because of GOP and Dems.
@debbienunn11 @kylegriffin1 @EdSkipper What do you call Fidel Castro and Che Guevara?  They are not praised by GOP. Both sides are serving ice cold Kool aid and the masses love it
@debbienunn11 @kylegriffin1 @EdSkipper How many less people are uninsured right now because of GOP?  0. No one thinks anyone should drink and bathe in toxic water. Talking point.
@debbienunn11 @kylegriffin1 @EdSkipper GOP hates Americans just as much as the Dems. No party is free from BS and hate.
@OpiniatedArtist @kylegriffin1 That is sad. There is no reason to threaten kids for their opinion.
@growsomepls777 @kylegriffin1 @TruthEqualsFact What about the 8th graders who chose to stay?  Are they less than the ones who didn't?
@NancySinatra One side is stupid the other blinded by hate. If Trump came out with ACA the Dems would say it is the worst thing ever. There is a middle.
@benshapiro Or an affordable product for those who want it and bring back accountability. If you get sick or hurt w/o it, you get to pay your own bills
@Alyssa_Milano Remember when Romney said the same thing when running for President in 2012 and was laughed at?  Yeah. Good times.
@rheliaz6000 @GhostPanther I want as many differing ideas and opinions around me as possible. Being in a group that all think like me would be both boring and scary
@rheliaz6000 @GhostPanther No
@iliza Congrats. Just remember, if he does something that pisses you off it is either because he thought it was funny or didn't know any better
@brianklaas And you still wonder what kind of system could be so broken we end up with president Trump.
@draiochta14 Did you feel the same about Bob Etheridge in 2010?
@JoyAnnReid @morgfair @MalcolmNance Are you saying Trump was right in firing him for how he handled the email investigation?
@jennah_justen @funder I seem to remember someone else who couldn't remember or recall things while under oath.
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner I also have friends and family in healthcare. Some on the insurance side and other on the practice side.
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner I'm not saying it didn't help a lot of people, I'm saying it hurt a lot of people as well. Mostly in the middle class living check to check
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner I am paying attention. The extremes are the ones blinded by pure hate or pure love to see there is a lot of junk floating in the pool
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner No one got this upset w/ the Bush's. They knew how to play the game. This guy doesn't. He says what is on his lips w/out his mind knowing.
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner This is about all politicians playing their base for fools thinking they know best for everyone.
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner Or it will fail when they decide it isn't profitable enough.
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner Any regulation forcing all people to pay for a service has to be always affordable and fool proof. Insurance CO's have to be bought in
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner There were people hurt by Obamacare and they are still being hurt today. It was not perfect and should not have been passed until perfect
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner If Obama was country first he would have done more to engage the reps willing to work with him. Not all were on board w obstruct at all cost
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner You really believe Hillary or Obama are country first? No politician is country first. They will sell out the base for a piece of bacon
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner Ask yourself the question, it is obvious the Russians successfully manipulated some voters. Would you be this up in arms if Trump lost?
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner There are a lot of things I find odd and I do not have a blindfold on. I prefer to wait for proven facts before I get excited about anything
@terry_erickson1 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner Same reason I got my name...
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner Proof? Or are you assuming based off rumors?  Points don't count until the ball is in the basket.
@terry_erickson1 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner This has been going around for 2 weeks now. He never tweeted. There was nothing to archive other than a bad pic
@emerald0522 @Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner Of?
@truegirl81 @Alyssa_Milano @JennifersWayJE @jaredkushner Wedding and dinner plans.
@Alyssa_Milano @swingleft He lost to a guy who body slammed a reporter just days before the election. Margin of loss would have been much larger if not for that act
@JonRiley7 @MichaelfRizzo Hope you all took note of the source.
@Alyssa_Milano Yeah, but that was when I was only 6
@tedlieu @NancySinatra @POTUS Media was the first to throw isreal out. He is a moron but the media is just as bad.
@opiejeanne @kylegriffin1 No need to use use the 5th if you don't recall or can't remember anything.
@ezraklein Immigration helps. Illegal immigration does not. Why is the word Illegal always left out?
@marmaree1 @CNN Either way. Have a good night. It was nice talking to you.
@marmaree1 @CNN If 10% of the class walked in protest, that would have been a solid message. 2% is just cute enough to make a story almost interesting.
@marmaree1 @CNN It was a powerful statement made in a peaceful manner, but not as powerful as it is being made out to be. Some kids walked out. That's all
@marmaree1 @CNN And a majority of the graduating class stayed and listened. If 80% of the school is Catholic that means 20% isn't so 2% is minimal.
@marmaree1 @CNN Still, a group of students who identify as Catholic is not the same as a group of students who practice Catholicism. Even at ND.
@kurteichenwald When I tell a Dem I didn't vote for Hillary I am called an idiot racist who threw my vote away because I hate women.
@kurteichenwald When I tell a trump supporter I didn't vote for Trump I am asked why so I tell them I thought he would be a train wreck.
@marmaree1 @CNN Identifying as a religion doesn't mean much. I was raised Lutheran and oppose most of his beliefs.  How many went to church at least weekly?
@marmaree1 @CNN I would agree with you if all who walked out were actually from Indiana. It was a peaceful protest. No one should be mad.
@realbigboyshit1 @ABC Apparently Big Boys Block. I'm sure gonna miss his misplaced anger.
@realbigboyshit1 @ABC Gotcha. You must be easily annoyed
@SFmaman1 @ABC What did they give up?  Did they have to give their degree back?  All they did was walk out to avoid hearing something they disagree with.
@realbigboyshit1 @ABC It's great some exercised their 1a right by walking out but sad others exercised theirs by staying? How was your life impacted by this?
@johnUWLatLARGE @ScottJonesy @DynelD @MMFlint How exactly did gerrymandering help Trump win the electoral votes?
@daxshepard1 I blame rap music and bad parental upbringing.
@MattWalshBlog @benshapiro And if he isn't colluding, what is he then?
@JudgeJeanine Has a right to be frustrated but it could have been avoided. If he is innocent as he says, he has nothing to fear. If not we need to know
@julesk_fighter If avocados were on the ballot they would have had my vote.
@pattonoswalt Yeah, but she didn't win
@CarolineFeraday @BraddJaffy It is the But My Brother Hit Me First defense.
@BraddJaffy @Karnythia Someone needs to redirect his Twitter to a fake domain where he thinks he is sending messages but they really go into an abyss.
@perlmutations I have a friend in secret service. He told me his code name is dipshit
@alexandraerin @SvizraLion @NoraReed If I'm not mistaking I did invite you over for a steak to talk about our differing ideas.
@alexandraerin @SvizraLion @NoraReed Yes, that is the point of owning property. I can display any message I want. Your right is to buy the lot next to me and put up your own
@NoraReed @magicalfeyfenny @alexandraerin @SvizraLion Oh and good morning my friend.
@NoraReed @magicalfeyfenny @alexandraerin @SvizraLion No one is taking healthcare away. That bill is dead in Senate. By the time HC reform is on the table Trump will be out of office.
@magicalfeyfenny @SvizraLion @NoraReed Don't listen the the far right. Listen to the people who lean right. Listen to others who disagree with you to understand their views
@magicalfeyfenny @SvizraLion @NoraReed Ok, so calling a group of people names just because I don't agree with them is fine in your world?  Even though a majority are normal people
@magicalfeyfenny @NoraReed Oh lord. Pence is not my choice either. I don't agree with his stances on many issues but get ready for his presidency if Trump is impeached
@magicalfeyfenny @alexandraerin @SvizraLion @NoraReed No one is saying they are gonna kill you and your kind.
@Akheloios @SvizraLion @NoraReed As much as I hate to say this, Anne Coulter is not a nazi. The people she was invited to speak to are not nazis. She has a right to speak
@alexandraerin @SvizraLion @NoraReed That was the wrong address. I felt bad. Here is my real address. 50 N Burhans Blvd, Hagerstown, MD 21740
@NoraReed @SvizraLion Welcome back. I missed you
@alexandraerin @SvizraLion @NoraReed Forgot my address. Sorry. I live at 1313 mockingbird Lane, Los Angeles, CA. See you soon?
@SvizraLion @NoraReed The problem is people are picking a side and not listening to the other. Picking a side is fine but we have to be open to different opinions
@SvizraLion @NoraReed Yes, they are victims. Not what I was trying to say but you are right. There are no victims between Dem and republican. Both parties suck
@alexandraerin @SvizraLion @NoraReed Anyway. Come over. I will throw a couple steaks on the grill and we can talk.
@alexandraerin @SvizraLion @NoraReed There is a difference between vandalism and free speech.
@BlueSpaceCanary And there are people who believe one side has no faults. Both sides are dirty. Both sides are wrong.
@alexandraerin @SvizraLion @NoraReed That makes no sense. Why not let someone listen to a speaker they want to hear?  What does free speech mean to you?
@TommyAFK Have you ever lost an argument to a 4 year old because they refuse to eat the lunch they asked for?  It's rough
@TommyAFK Twin 4 year olds. Thanks for the correction. They wear you down and suck the brain out of you.
@SvizraLion @NoraReed And the other side is just as bad. Calling people fascist while shutting down speakers they don't want to hear. No one is a victim here
@phantamanta44 @NoraReed If I'm the annoying one then, hey!  That wasn't nice. If I'm not the annoying one, you will learn how when you have 4 year old twins
@NoraReed Oh well.  I was looking forward to hearing what you had to say. Good night.
@NoraReed you know this how? I have not attacked you or called you names. I have contributed more than fart, name calling and no. Ask me a question
@NoraReed Why not?  Scared you might agree with some things I have to say?  I might agree with you on something also.
@NoraReed @SvizraLion So far all you have contributed is fart and name calling. Prove you are smarter than me by having an adult conversation.
@NoraReed @SvizraLion Thank you again for your witty comments.
@SvizraLion @NoraReed Fall into this category. Calling all Trump supporters nazis immediately closes them off for any type of discussion that could go somewhere.
@SvizraLion @NoraReed I agree, there is a small faction that welcome being called nazis and they are terrible people but not a majority of trump supporters
@Royalgeorgehk @Charleneorrn @michellemalkin Any cop who says they are never scared on duty is a liar. Not justifying her actions. I'm surprised at the verdict but all cops get scared
@KyleRowland17 @kevinrns @timkmak @Su_Doe_Coup Better safe than sorry. Turn yourself in and bring grandma with you.
@FoxNews One side will eventually claim partisanship in the results. Either Trump paid him and obstructed or he is incompetent.  He can't win.
@kurteichenwald What info did he share?  That they are trying to use laptops as bombs on airplanes?  The info that has been in the local news for 2 months?
@Vikinggal @TIME If that is true, they are doing a terrible job.
@TIME It's all lies! For the price you pay at 5 guys the burger should beat in n out.  But @innoutburger is hands down the better burger
@MT_Jasko @mymac24 @timkmak There is no typical politician that isn't shady AF. Anyone who thinks he is the saviour is badly confused but she was also not the answer.
@WeSupport45 @TheDemocrats @SenSchumer @MaxineWaters I would support a super pac that targeted corruption from either side. One side is not more crooked than the other.
@TheLastWord @amyklobuchar When Russia or others try to interfere again. They have tried for years. They aren't gonna quit now since they have succeeded once.
@MT_Jasko @mymac24 @timkmak Hard to believe these were the best either side could come up with.
@MT_Jasko @mymac24 @timkmak You have to admit she is as shady as Trump is dumb. There is way too much swirl around her for all of it to be false.
@MT_Jasko @mymac24 @timkmak So NYT is legit and the cash flow into the Clinton foundation is questionable and possibly illegal? Which also agrees with Trump.
@kevinrns @timkmak @Su_Doe_Coup Yeah!  Let's arrest anyone who has traveled to Russia or uses Russian dressing.
@MT_Jasko @mymac24 @timkmak Same question to you. Is NYT legit news or do you agree with Trump that it is fake?
@Trumpbits @PalmerReport I am anxious to find out the results so we can put this behind us and finally move forward.
@Trumpbits @PalmerReport Are you ready to accept the results IF they come back with he is clean? All I know is what I read and both sides are adamant they are right.
@PalmerReport @Trumpbits Or, he knows Trump is not guilty and wants someone trusted by the Democrats to break the news. At this point it really is a coin flip.
@PreetBharara @ggreenwald Will you say the same if he finds Trump did nothing wrong?
@NoraReed Hit me up when you want to have a discussion. Until then, good luck with your gas issues.
@NoraReed That is why libs are losing. Cant argue so call names and spout nonsense like fart then call opposition fascist and Nazi.
@NoraReed You have nothing of value to add so you resort to name calling. Nice tactic.
@Manjit096398321 @katewillette @brandonlk @ABC I always admit my mistakes.
@NoraReed Why am I ignorant?  Because I don't think comparing Americans to nazis is a valid argument?  You don't know me or my politics.
@Hal_Duncan @Karnythia Can we stop comparing the party opposite our beliefs to nazis?  Neither party is even close to that status.
@benshapiro Can it be both?
@Manjit096398321 @katewillette @brandonlk @ABC My apologies. I thought you were calling me dumb. I have not met him but his actions are not consistent with intelligence.
@Manjit096398321 @katewillette @brandonlk @ABC Have nothing of value to add so you resort to insulting someone you have never met. Very brave of you.
@SethAMandel Accurate or affirming your hopes that Trump is as dirty as anyone in DC?  Only difference is Trump doesn't know how to hide it well as them
@MelissaTweets Got it.  I was a little confused that someone would actually admit what they were doing.
@MelissaTweets So anyone who disagrees with you is the enemy and must be destroyed?  Awesome. Way to threaten people to keep them quiet.
@katewillette @brandonlk @Manjit096398321 @ABC We were but you chimed in with only presidents can be impeached and I didn't want you going thru life being wrong. You're welcome.
@katewillette @brandonlk @Manjit096398321 @ABC ”impeachment is 4 deeds that by definition only presidents can do" this reads as though only presidents can be impeached and is wrong
@neezed @ABC To be more accurate you should rephrase to No One is telling the truth. We get bits that both sides want to hear but nothing usable
@katewillette @brandonlk @Manjit096398321 @ABC Only presidents can be impeached?  Crazy, I didn't know Gray Davis was president.
@DannyZuker Would dems act differently of Obama was accused of this?  We know the answers from both sides. There will be a lot of self loving tonight.
@JohnCar05366874 @floridarocket @CNN And most people are dumb enough to fall for the deflection.
@JohnCar05366874 @floridarocket @CNN Same applies to Dems. Country is divided because one side is pointing fingers at the other to distract from them behaving in the same manor
@stephibug @hardball @margarettalev @realDonaldTrump You are totally right. The GOP is the only party acting like kids and pretending to be working for our best interests.
@pattonoswalt The NSA, who was in the office at the time said it didn't happen.
@pattonoswalt So based on an anonymous source who was not in the office at the time we are positive he gave up secret information when the head of
@chelseahandler So you are saying his advice is sound?
@LouiseMensch @MichaelfRizzo @TrueFactsStated Remember when they said Hillary's deleted emails have been found?  Yeah, this is the same thing.
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Sounds like what GOP did for the past 8 years. Why would you think Dems would act different?  Did you think they were actually grown ups?
@stephenkruiser Once I think I feel a sniffle I grab a couple jalepenos. Probably all in my head but it works for me
@feecklejarr @freakinuts @Alyssa_Milano ACA has not changed and will not change until there is a better alternative. Both sides are playing the people to stay in office.
@feecklejarr @freakinuts @Alyssa_Milano The GOP didn't do anything because what was passed will die in Senate. All they did was push thru a bill to make it look like the delivered.
@freakinuts @Alyssa_Milano Same with the Dems.  If GOP created ACA the Dems would say it is a horrible idea. If GOP said open boarders they would scream build a wall
@kellyana4u @FoxNews You left out Fox news and Britbart. No news outlets report just the news. They all spin to their base. Get money out of news and politics
@Alyssa_Milano @DebraMessing No party cares about people, just what will keep them in their protected seat.
@Mareedvb @Alyssa_Milano Do you believe anyone who disagrees with you is an idiot?  Trump winning the presidency was a strong message.
@stephenasprey @Alyssa_Milano What has he done?  He signed some EO's that will never pass.  Has your life changed in the past 4 months?
@freakinuts @Alyssa_Milano Is GOP the only party with liars?  Dems never lie?  All politicians lie to get elected.
@RedGypsyBlues @Alyssa_Milano Are they cowards because they don't agree with you?
@alan_flippo @Alyssa_Milano November 8th
@thehill Anyone who is upset by this should realize it would also be happening if he lost and they would be supporting it.
@greggutfeld Anyone who ever lied should resign so honest people can be elected.  Wait...
@ashleytisdale What happens for dinner meetings?
@MichaelfRizzo @LisaLimonTx @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan The only one who would be able to complete a term going forward is God himself.
@MichaelfRizzo @LisaLimonTx @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Pretty much everything that is going on against Trump right now and will happen to every sitting president from here on out.
@Amy_Siskind I find it sad that from now on the opposing party will hope and try to impeach the sitting president. Our system is now a joke.
@Alyssa_Milano @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @ABC @CBSNews @NewsHour @DRUDGE_REPORT Wasn't covered anywhere because it is not news. Everyone already knew this information.
@RVAwonk Timing is suspect for sure, but only a fool thought Comey would last a year no matter who we elected.
@TheLastWord Duh
@gene423 @jaketapper @floridarocket Was Comey the only one investigating?  That would be the only reason any investigation has stopped.
@Alyssa_Milano @POTUS Libs didn't trust Comey and thought he rigged election against Hillary.  Now they are saying he is trustworthy and mad he got fired?
@Karnythia My kids are 4 and bullying does concern me. We haven't had that talk yet but I plan on telling them the same.
@Impeach_D_Trump Why just Trump?  reps aren't the only party causing damage.  This election we all learned people are dumb and DNC is shady at best.
@Karnythia Why not both?
@BraddJaffy @floridarocket Did Flynn still have his security clearance after being fired by Obama?
@Married0305 @floridarocket @realDonaldTrump According to this, he is guilty until proven innocent. Is this true for all or just him?  If true for all, you are saying the 5th = guilty
@BBCBreaking @BretBaier Did she lose because of sexism too?
@rickygervais Don't break the sidewalk.
@kylegriffin1 @MichaelfRizzo Hillary used private server to avoid the same foia requests.
@iliza I can't unsee that. It was awesome.
@BenjaminPDixon Everyone has the right to affordable healthcare but having the govt run a 1 size fits all plan from DC is not the way to go.
@joerogan Canelo is a great boxer but I don't think he has fought anyone who can take a punch like 3g. It will be a great fight for sure.
@thehill If his are forced public, so are theirs.
@robreiner Wouldn't that pretty much clear out all our elected officials?  None of them are honest.
@Alyssa_Milano The media was fine, it's the people who chose to only read items that validated their beliefs.
@elonmusk Chuck Norris
@Ocean_Theory @iliza @UnicornsPuppies I am with you.
@Ocean_Theory @iliza @UnicornsPuppies He just wanted to prove a point.
@Ocean_Theory @iliza @UnicornsPuppies Because most people are morons. I wasn't a fan of Obama because I felt he was arrogant. Not a fan of Trump because IMO he didn't want to win
@iamcandydax @iliza It's never gonna happen. Just like the wall and mass deportations. This tragic bill will die in Senate if it isn't rewritten.
@GeorgeTakei 1st. This won't pass Senate. 2nd. Maybe if Dems sat at the table and negotiated the bill would be more acceptable to everyone.
@thehill Did every Dem read the entire ACA bill before voting?
@tedlieu @perlmutations And not a single republican voted for ACA?  They are the same in that they don't represent the people who put them in office once in office
@CCStrickland @iliza Education system is busted if they let him thru.
@traceyanoble @iliza Every person that ever ran for office has some degree of narcissism. Trump's is higher than most but he isnt alone
@brianklaas @floridarocket This also didn't happen yet and will never make it out of Senate.
@iliza I'm good.
@iliza @tigergal7175 I think I need to start.
@iliza @traceyanoble Hard to prove either way. We do know he hates to be challenged and that is all I can go by
@traceyanoble @iliza Maybe of I crack some jokes about Trump to his face he will do everything he can to be the best broke person ever...
@traceyanoble @iliza DT doesn't like to be challenged or upstaged. He would have reacted the same if Obama​ was white.
@RepAdamSchiff @NancySinatra The answer is 0. No one lost insurance today. This bill will never make it out of Senate as is and you know that better than most of us.
@103Psalm17 @iliza GOP railed against Dems for releasing an imperfect plan then turn around and do the same. Both plans are a wreck and will hurt people
@iliza Racism can be blamed for a lot of terrible things, but our elected officials refusing to work together is not one of them.
@iliza Racism had nothing to do with this. Pure stupidity, selfishness and refusing to work together like we were taught in 1st grade is to blame
@floridarocket Something this important and impacts everyone​ young and old needs to be perfect. This pass then fix at next level idea is completely wrong
@CBSNews Once their older son took an earlier flight they lost the seat.  Both parties are wrong. Delta should have handled differently.
@VinTechman @thehill No, they aren't.  I live in LA and they are gearing up to double down in 2018.
@Brady5thOrBust @p9cker_girl @thehill Then please tell me how I misread your post and how I was supposed to take "thats who she is doing it for" In reply to risk for constituants
@Brady5thOrBust @p9cker_girl @thehill She is risking nothing. Agreeing with Trump would be taking a risk. She is being dramatic and actually securing her seat for 2018
@thehill She is a rep from CA. She is risking nothing by opposing Trump.
@JohnFugelsang @julesk_fighter There will be a lawsuit against this by end of tomorrow. I think they have a pool to see which EO gets sued the fastest and DT has this one
@JudgeJeanine Religious freedom is what this country was founded on but allowing churches to influence politics is a mistake and will never pass.
@Realpersonpltcs @jimeh5 @mitchellvii IMO they all share some blame. Not a single person up there is looking out for our best interest.
@Realpersonpltcs @jimeh5 @mitchellvii No matter what this bill will never pass w/out major changes. Might get thru today but will stall without bipartisan contribution.
@atomicnerfbat @blucollarlib @Gr8SageEqlofHvn @WLCA1 I agree. As I stated previously this started before Obama.  The divisivness started back with bush gore and has grown to the gap it is now.
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 Anyway, it was great reading your opinions and thanks for the civil conversation.  I have a sick kid and work in the morning. Good night.
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 By my needs
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 They know how to help their people better Than dc. What is best for me probably isn't best for you so it isn't fair to force someone to live
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 I agree.  That is why I have a problem with the way things are. State and local govt are closer to the people they serve.
@blucollarlib @Gr8SageEqlofHvn @WLCA1 Cops have been doing that for years.
@blucollarlib @Gr8SageEqlofHvn @WLCA1 I'm not saying everything they want to do is a great plan. I think most things they do are wrong and I think the same of Dem side
@blucollarlib @Gr8SageEqlofHvn @WLCA1 They want less govt over the people and more accountability on the people. I tend to agree fed govt should have less of an impact on my life
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 So has the Dem side. No side is without fault. They forget we elect them to negotiate on our behalf which includes compromise.
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @WLCA1 @blucollarlib Did they go to the table?  Or did they say if you call it a replacement we won't deal?
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations I might change my mind on some things and so might you. If we don't at least we tried.
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations I expect them to act in the best interest of the people like they were elected to do. We are having a civil conversation while not agreeing
@WLCA1 @Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations They could have gone to the table, fixed what was broken and allowed GOP to call it what ever they wanted. Instead they didn't even try
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations They are both a childish act and things would go much better for all if they negotiated instead of demanded.
@blucollarlib @Gr8SageEqlofHvn @WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations No there are 2 parties that think the other side are morons.
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations It needs to stop and soon. Our lives depend on it.
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations All I have seen out of DC over the past 12 years is a bunch of foot stomping and tantrums then rush to the media to put down the other side
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @blucollarlib @WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations Regardless, we need our reps to get something as massive as healthcare right. To do that they need to work together, not obstruct and demand
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn @WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations Once again I am not trying to equate the 2 bills. I am stating you cannot condemn one side for doing what the other side has also done.
@WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations ACA and whatever this is fail, although this is far worse.
@WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations To be a foolproof plan in place that helps everyone.
@WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations Also ACA did help a large number of people but it was not perfect and also hurt some as well. When passing a bill like this there needs
@WLCA1 @atomicnerfbat @perlmutations I am not trying to equate the bills. They are not equal. I am trying to point out the hypocrisy of both sides that led us to this point.
@atomicnerfbat @perlmutations This is the kind of crap that got Trump elected. The us vs them BS is hypocritical at best and will end up hurting us all
@atomicnerfbat @perlmutations That's right.  It doesn't excuse it but it is the same thing so saying asking what kind of people do this then pointing to GOP is wrong.
@perlmutations Wasn't it Barbara Boxer who said we have to pass it to see what's in it about ACA?  This current plan is horseshit but it isn't just GOP
@MIAARIBELL I hate when that happens
@ezlusztig @MichaelfRizzo Trump did say that but he is also considering going after Julian Assange so that point is kind of usless.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton In this case I strongly opposed both candidates. I live in CA so my vote is not gonna change much either way.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton It is a fine line for sure but one we should test. First step should be to get money out of politics.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton That has to go. Like I do. Good night.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton We need to start electing people to work together for all of our needs not just to obstruct the other side with kid games.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton I don't think the people need to be united. We need to have diversity in beliefs. That is how we will progress.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton Anyway. It is time to go back to work at the vodka distillery. 😎  Nice talking to you. Thanks for the conversation.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton They are all afraid to work across the aisle out of fear of being replaced.  This is a problem.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton There is not 1 politician in office right now that has been 100% honest with their constituents.We need to vote them out regardless of party
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton And I am a real person. I promise. I lean to the right but prefer a balanced govt that works for everyone. No one side is always right.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton Yes our fault. We all share blame for this freak show. If we were more concerned with accountability than winning we wouldn't have Trump.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton Not trying to manipulate you at all. Just trying to have a discussion with someone I don't fully agree with. Thank you for keeping it civil
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton Julian Assange was asked about why he isn't leaking GOP leaks and basically said Trump is damaging himself more than what they saw in data
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton Nothing in the email could have painted Trump in a worse light than the conversation on the bus or his build the wall crap.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton We were also manipulated by both parties to think these 2 were the best options we had. We the people are pretty dumb and selfish.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton But totally not new. People only read items to confirm their beliefs.  It is our fault. We let the russians influence us.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton Truth does matter, but it has not mattered in politics for many many years.  That is something we can fix.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton Bipartisan does not exist because WE keep electing people to oppose the other side instead of working together FOR all people.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton They did interfere but that is not new. They have been trying to get their person elected since the 50's. But there was no vote hack.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton They only released DNC which were damaging because what Trump was doing was way worse than what was in the GOP email.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton But I also want to know the truth if there are ties. This is something we need to know.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton I definitely​ do not want there to be ties found. Not because I think he is awesome but because that would be tragic for the country.
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton I hear you. There are some strange things going on but at the same time there were some strange things about the emails and that netted 0
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton But it seems to me you are biased on this. Instead of weighing evidence and facts you have chosen a side and discredit anything that opposes
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton What if the truth shows no ties? Would you accept it? Do you really want the truth or do you want the truth to be one way and not the other?
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton Do you really think some proof would not have been leaked?  Lots of things have been leaked yet nothing solid on this. Why?
@BeckiLewis @thehill @HillaryClinton There are no ties to Russia. It is the Dem version of Hillary emails. Just talking point to enflame one base against the other.
@blissedbitch @thehill If this were true how do you explain her winning the popular vote?
@7hontor @thehill If this were true the numbers would have showed a closer race on election night. Did she do anything that could have cost her the election?
@Slate Problem is insurance companies charging what they want and pricing people out of the market forcing something like ACA to be necessary
@RVAwonk She was not the right candidate in 2008 or 2016. Bernie is not a democrat. DNC made sure he didn't win. She should only blame herself &amp; team
@Alyssa_Milano We also need to stop attacking people for their views and stop saying things behind the keyboard that we would not say in person.
@Alyssa_Milano Personal accountability from govt down to us regular people. Also realize just because I don't agree with you doesn't make me bad and racist
@Slate @nytimes So are you saying we should only read articles we agree with and never challenge ourselves to see the other side?  Great idea.
@Alyssa_Milano Would lying under oath be one of them?
@silencednot @bakedalaska *Ghetto
@PrisonPlanet If that was actually true she would have also lost the popular vote.
@Shirtsgirl @chelseahandler They are changing that as of last week.
@chuckburke13 @chelseahandler @blahblah8976 They are already. It's called russiagate
@chelseahandler Just like Obama said you can keep your plan and you can keep your Dr. Don't act like Trump is the first to lie in office.
@MIAARIBELL I appreciate your posts and did not want to start a storm, just wanted to say there is a difference between legal and illegal immigration.
@MIAARIBELL IMO it is important to distinguish between the 2 when making a case for immigration and not illegal immigration at the same time.
@MIAARIBELL I am for immigration but like many others have an issue with illegal immigration.
@MIAARIBELL Context is hard to grab in 140 especially when you talk about foreign objects ok but people not.
@MIAARIBELL Very few people have an issue with immigration. It is Illegal immigration that most people have an issue with. 2 very different things.
@genaro_inc @tinaissa @GOP Too busy shaking their heads in disbelief.
@TeaPainUSA @floridarocket Did Flynn's clearance get renewed in 2016? Trump should have done his due diligence but prev admin does not escape blame if they renewed it
@Karnythia I love them. they stopped knocking when I told them I could cut their bike payment by half but they lose all rights to the bike for 20 yrs
@VanJones68 @realDonaldTrump Shocker
@CNN We are born with inalienable rights meaning they are not granted by our government but are to be protected by them. Freedom is one of them
@maddpig @CNN The God in which you believe. If you do not believe in a deity then no one or nothing. Fact is you are free regardless of who allows it
@Katieleen17 @benshapiro No one cares unless there is a benefit to them. It is called being a flawed human, which we all are.
@AP What was the growth in Obama's first qtr of his first and second term?  Cherry picking is biased reporting.
RT @49ers: Following a trade with the Bears, the #49ers selected Stanford DL Solomon Thomas with the 3rd overall pick.		📰 https://t.co/JuCL…
@Karnythia Anyone who says they would turn it down is either a liar or already wealthy.
@FrankArmy @DishNation The midget dies
@MaxineWaters Russian ties are equal to Hillary emails. Neither are valid, just talking points to enflame both bases.
@Karnythia That means they were willing to pay more than the good Dr asked for.
@latimes Your Bias is showing. Might want to cover that up a bit
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Maybe the amount would be less if previous adminstrations made it harder to move funds offshore.
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 Maybe they would be a better target than someone taking a risk to provide jobs and a service to the community.
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 Why aren't you mad at the building/home owners for charging too much for rent or the utilities for charging too much for gas or electricity
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 No one said it was a right but it is creating jobs which is what everyone wants. More jobs more tax revenue.
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 And you have not answered any of my questions.
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 Without the business owner the worker is not a worker. Don't sympathize for the owner but you should care about the worker losing a job
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 2 years is fairly new, it's not old either. What happens when you have a poor 2nd month?  Do you pay your employees or you utilities?
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 Every spot is great when it opens but will have a dip in the 2nd or 3rd month. What happens if they can't make payroll?
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 You are right, but only because it is new. With a high min you reduce the ramp time for a place to build its base of regulars.
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 They will be closing soon
@JesseKenn @KeefeLynn @SamAustin2103 I didn't say they were closing I said they were not opening as fast. Keep an eye on them. If they aren't successful from jump
@KeefeLynn @JesseKenn @SamAustin2103 Workers should be able to make a living but if you think the manager should bring home more than an owner you are slightly confused.
@KeefeLynn @JesseKenn @SamAustin2103 Allowing big corporate restaurants to serve food. I am a huge fan of small joints. They care for quality unlike large chains.
@KeefeLynn @JesseKenn @SamAustin2103 The owner loses everything. Most small places can afford to pay the $15 min so basically what you are doing is removing them and only
@KeefeLynn @JesseKenn @SamAustin2103 Owners have a greater risk than their workers and should make more than them, yes. If their spot closes the worker loses a job...
@KeefeLynn @JesseKenn @SamAustin2103 Not what I said at all but if it fits your narrative go ahead and use it.
@larsolsson @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump There are also old videos of Hillary taking the exact opposite stand on gay marriage and keystone Pipeline among many other topics.
@larsolsson @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Mostly because social media wasn't as prevalent as it is now and most politicians are too old for technology.
@Just_Sayin411 @LisaWerkmeister @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump 3 months in office, almost $10 million in golf trips. He is on pace to outspend Obama's vacation costs in his first year.
@newnorcalgal @Impeach_D_Trump That's right. Shut down the govt over stupidity and let more of our friends and family lose a paycheck.  That will show them...
@TheLeadCNN @RalphGarman @jaketapper How about we demand non biased news?  All media has a side. People only read/watch to confirm their beliefs. All other views are called fake
@jyangelo @SarahKSilverman There are none. Do you think we would still be having these conversations if there were?  If released I will look but I'm not obsessed
@Karnythia I work from home a couple days a week and the kids are there with me. I don't think 30 will cut it on those days.
@tracyreynolds67 @SarahKSilverman Like signing a bunch of exec orders, deporting a bunch of illegals and lying to the American people?  Yeah, Obama didn't do any of that.
@jyangelo @SarahKSilverman They can demand all they want, it is not required for him to show his taxes. There are worse things to be concerned about than this
@montetjwitter11 @Alyssa_Milano 1st of all, we can spell. B, internet cafe, not library. Thirdly no rush. We have no where to bee
@MatthewGellert @Alyssa_Milano Where is their other hand?
@Thereallydeath @BernieSanders That's just what they tell us.
@JesseKenn @SamAustin2103 The best Italian meal I have ever had was in Seattle in a basement.  Me was a chalkboard with 3 things. They are now closed.
@JesseKenn @SamAustin2103 I would rather see anyone wanting to open a small family spot be able to do so.
@Thereallydeath @BernieSanders The dnc chose Hillary
@JesseKenn @SamAustin2103 More restaurants are either adding a surcharge to offset or including tip in the total. It slowed down openings of small family owned spots
@AdamBaldwin Hire them if they are most qualified.  My political beliefs do not have to be the same as theirs.
@MichaelfRizzo How is that different from them being exempt from ACA?
@Karnythia Show me an honest politician and I will show you one who is 0 and 1
@FrankArmy Very distracting for sure.
@SherriEShepherd Lemon pepper is good but nothing beats the Louisiana Dry Rub
@thehill No dumber than a bullet train to nowhere neither of which will ever be built
@poptart9000 @thehill He is not the first predator to sit in the oval office
@gingertop7 @NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley Both are at fault. People attending a peaceful rally do not show up wearing helmets or masks.
@FoxNews Absolutely
@Alyssa_Milano Yeah it was all him, don't hold the other 4 who agreed with him accountable. Just blame Gorsuch.
@benshapiro But he doesn't own a yacht, yet
@NikPalomares @Penetratinshite @CindyMunz @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley @realDonaldTrump I did not vote for Trump and won't defend those actions. Or Trump u.
@NikPalomares @Penetratinshite @CindyMunz @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley @realDonaldTrump Egomaniac and a blowhard for sure. I would say out of touch with common reality and common people over bigoted or sexist
@NikPalomares @Penetratinshite @CindyMunz @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley @realDonaldTrump I don't think he intended to incite during his campaign, but he did nothing to stop it either.
@NikPalomares @Penetratinshite @CindyMunz @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley @realDonaldTrump What circumstances since he took office has he incited his supporters?
@NikPalomares @endlibhypocrisy @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley Sure. I prefer to call it the roaming a-hole factor.  There would have been tension last week at Berkeley but someone had to throw a rock
@NikPalomares @endlibhypocrisy @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley It only takes 1 person looking to take advantage of a situation to escalate.
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley I think we done slipped down the censorship slope already.
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley Kind of a loaded question isn't it?  Only if violence occurs can you prove the speech was intended to incite. People need to be smarter
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley I might pay for that.
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley Because it is her right to speak there and it is the right of those that invited her to hear her speak. I highly doubt she will throw down
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley I hear you on the devil's advocate part.
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley If she gets up there and tells all Trump supporters to punch a liberal on the way out then you will have a point.
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley The ones who are triggered by her presence need to realize it is alright for others to have different opinions. It is nothing against them
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley What happened last week was not one sided. Both sides went looking for a battle.
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley And you can absolutely yell fire in a theater but you will just as absolutely be punished. Free speech &lt;&gt; free from consequence.
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley How progressive can the campus be if they don't allow different opinions and thoughts?
@NikPalomares @charlescwcooke @washingtonpost @AnnCoulter @UCBerkeley That is quite different from not allowing someone to speak because you don't agree with them.
@Alyssa_Milano @wikileaks WikiLeaks said they have stuff in Trump but nothing more damaging than what he does in his own.
@YahooNews They are $16 of you buy them in a Vegas casino.
@christas_cheryl @FoxNews What does this have to do with the post you replied to?
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump If you tell your kid to stop hitting their sister so they go and hit the cat, they are in compliance but not living up the to spirit.
@RalphGarman Trump supporters really need to avoid bringing up travel when comparing to Obama. It is a losing battle
@TIME @Kaepernick7 He did it to change the narrative of why he isn't playing. If he was still the starter he would never have started his protest
@AwardsDarwin That's not a tramp stamp, it is road rash...
@AlmightyLyriq @Bigdaddybtc @ShaunKing @StoneyD BC rapes and harasses multiple women the left says nothing, but the accusation of harassment against DT is an issue. Definition of hypocrisy
@MarkRuffalo I am willing to bet this issue is not unique to Fox news.
@SDebidour @WSJ How does Anne Coulter accepting an invitation to speak incite violence?
@SDebidour @WSJ That was 2 groups looking for issues not just one. People going to a peaceful rally do not wear masks. That does not answer my question
@thehill Democrats: The party of accountability.
@Slate That's like telling everyone the team that placed second actually won because they had more heart, just no trophy
@rhondarealtor @thehill Did you think it was wrong when people who opposed Obama suggested the same thing?
@harrooorahrah @thehill When did he do that?
@BlueBax1 @TFinn82 @SDebidour @WSJ Why?  Does it trigger you?
@SDebidour @WSJ Thats like saying the person that just got punched started the fight by breathing in the wrong air.  Makes no sense at all.
@SDebidour @WSJ How is giving a speech trying to incite violence?  They accepted an invitation to speak.
@RVAwonk Remember when people called Trump dumb when he said to watch out for election tampering?  Yeah. Good times.
@thehill She could have beat him in 2016. Only one that couldn't was Hillary
@downpunxx @RVAwonk And it also appears you agree with Trump's theory of voter fraud and election hacking.
@downpunxx @RVAwonk Are you calling the Obama admin and Obama himself fools?  They were the first to say there is no indication voting results were hacked.
@judgingyouhard_ @brandongroeny I agree with you.
@DrainThatSwamp @brandongroeny I agree. If he did it he needed to go.
@judgingyouhard_ @brandongroeny I agree it shouldn't be partisan, but when you praise fox for firing O'Reilly but refuse to admit Clinton was as guilty it becomes partisan
@mln63 @brandongroeny What proof do you have he is a predator?
@IrinaViscardi @brandongroeny Who did Trump rape?  What is your source and where is your proof?
@Slate This is like when I told my parents the F on my report card was for Fantastic. A loss is a loss no matter how slim of a margin
@washingtonpost Kind of ironic the side claiming Trump wants to limit 1a rights are limiting 1a rights of anyone they don't agree with.
@PimpTasticRglyd @markjschilling @rickygervais @amyschumer @Discovery Totally forgot about that. Was busy putting kids to bed.
@Marlene02374846 @NHLFlyersHockey @SethAbramson How did the reps cheat?  Do you have proof or are you venting because there has to be a reason other than poor candidates for Dems to lose?
@Karnythia Not sure it will matter since we don't know where in the world she is and also can't seem to find Waldo.
@PimpTasticRglyd @markjschilling @rickygervais @amyschumer But she is a hell of a lot funnier than I am, but I do have my moments. Trophy hunting has it's place even though I don't agree with it
@abc7newsbayarea Regardless of religion he shot and killed 3 innocent people. I would say that is a terror related crime.
@Evan_McMullin @morgfair @StandUpRepublic Nope. Won't change anything
@PimpTasticRglyd @markjschilling @rickygervais I don't want to bounce one of the 100 you follow when you would replace me soon after. We see thing different.  I appreciate hunters.
@Cernovich Can't see this backfiring at all...
@PimpTasticRglyd @markjschilling @rickygervais Steve Irwin saved animals, he also died by one.
@PimpTasticRglyd @markjschilling @rickygervais Assume away, that's your call.
@PimpTasticRglyd @markjschilling @rickygervais The mom probably supports her deceased husband's lifestyle and will marry another hunter.
@mentaldrippage @rickygervais Even better, they got dissected
@THESheilaDalton @rickygervais Or ever again since the one who dined plus another are now dead.
@PimpTasticRglyd @markjschilling @rickygervais Because kids raised without a dad never have any issues at all.
@Karnythia I got solar panels 2 years ago. The power company now wants a $10 min charge for the cost of transferring power both to and from my house.
@chrissyteigen A bag made from baby seal
@floridarocket So Dems will block what could up the amount of discretionary $ because Trump's taxes or are they anti reform and this is a "valid" excuse?
@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump Title 36 Subtitle 1, Para. 301 of the US Code states hand over heart facing the flag while the anthem is played
@genaro_inc Obama didn't buckle, what makes you think Trump will?
@kiarafrobles @Lauren_Southern @bakedalaska @BrittPettibone Once a brawl breaks out any speech is irrelevant. People need to grow up and accept people have different ideas and that is ok.
@kiarafrobles @Cernovich What point am I missing?  All I saw was a bunch of overgrown kids throwing rocks and punches, not a rally for free speech.
@deecee3737 @MarkRuffalo I have 36 followers now. Thanks for the boost.
@deecee3737 @MarkRuffalo You do know the other side was praising Hannity for his coverage of the email crap?
@deecee3737 @MarkRuffalo Probably less than that since I'm pretty sure 30 are porn bots...
@MarkRuffalo Brilliant reporting?  Wasn't she the one who took an hour to prove Trump paid about a 25% tax rate which was $38 million in 2005?
@paththatsclear @queenofnoirs @robreiner Yup. Trump &amp; Pence will be gone and Hillary will be given the throne she deserves.  Then you wake up and go back to work in the real world
@Gallaecian @Mistress_Jan @robreiner @uglywebsites And if you are around any of them talking about this, they might be breaking the law.
@GeorgeTakei @MichaelfRizzo Maybe if the Dems listened to their base you would have a different president.
@SarahKSilverman That covers a ton of people, you might need to be more specific
@MarkRuffalo Oxygen and my twins. I guess the wife also.
@Nasty_Woman1 @yearbookceo @SethAbramson It's time to calm the rhetoric. Women will lose no more rights than men.
@susieqd601 @SethAbramson Name 1 politician who is honest most of the time.
@socal_american @FoxNews @POTUS Things are always hidden from us because we are dumb enough to think we know it all.  Everyone here thinks they are smarter than the others
@socal_american @FoxNews @POTUS You will assume the worst no matter what. If they show nothing, you will think they are fixed. As for transparency, I kind of agree with you
@socal_american @FoxNews @POTUS Same way you are so confident they will. Do you think he is the first one beholden to others while in office?  Far from it.
@socal_american @FoxNews @POTUS I am very much awake and know his taxes will not show any ties. IF they exist they are hidden. What he does in office is our business.
@ChrisBastianBkl @dbongino Let's start with our public servants pay. No one in public office should be getting rich.
@socal_american @FoxNews @POTUS What he did as a business man before taking office is none of our business. The truth will come out about any ties eventually.
@pacelattin @FoxNews @POTUS Do you really think if he received $1 trillion from anyone he would only claim to be a billionaire?  The rhetoric is getting thick.
@ChrisBastianBkl @dbongino I also pay top % but I feel the money I earned is better off in my pocket than the governments. I don't need a cut but it'd be nice
@EndorNPS @StephenKing @DoctorMcCoy2017 I am not ignoring you if you reply. My twins will be up in a few hours and I am working on an awesome hangover. Have a good night.
@EndorNPS @StephenKing @DoctorMcCoy2017 I agree with you there. Our govt stopped representing the people long before Obama took office. They only care for themselves, not us.
@EndorNPS @StephenKing @DoctorMcCoy2017 I am all for an investigation. If it happenswe need to know but right now this is looking more and more like the reps Hillary email chase
@Uldihaa @radiometricx @StephenKing Not embarrassed at all. But if it makes you feel better, oops.
@LittleChicago_1 @StephenKing @realDonaldTrump You obviously have not read Christine or idle hands.
@Pippinsgirl45 @collins11_m @StephenKing If we were respected then NK would not be testing nukes and Iran would not be holding our soldiers at gunpoint and chanting death to America
@EndorNPS @StephenKing @DoctorMcCoy2017 Isn't it the Dems calling the propaganda they feel cost H the win an act of war?  They want to fight over false news dumb people fell for.
@lstl5 @StephenKing @MarilynAEdmonds How many attacks happened under Obama?  Far more than any other president. Yeah. He kept us safe. Tell that to the people in San Bernardino
@Uldihaa @radiometricx @StephenKing Tomahawk missiles. If your gonna talk smack at least get it right.
@StephenKing The world was far from stable. Only difference is we went from a pres who drew a line then watched to one who doesn't bother with lines.
@Hell_HasCome @thehill If you were united we would have president Sanders in office. DNC doesn't care what you want.
@QoSBaszler Rightfully so.
@MichaelfRizzo @CoreyRees @adamzyglis @TheBuffaloNews So did the opposition. Both sides were controlled by hope and fear brought on by both parties.
@CoreyRees @adamzyglis @MichaelfRizzo @TheBuffaloNews What does that have to do with anything?  If anyone thought he would do everything he ran on they were naive, that goes for both sides
@eileenhargis1 @taxmarch Didn't he pay $38 million in 2005?  Wasn't that about 25% of his income?  I want to be in a position where $38 million is little to 0 too
@ezlusztig Yes, things were much better when we were drawing lines then doing nothing. We aren't targeting innocent people unlike who we are targeting.
@JuddApatow What is your solution to NK?  Let them keep launching tests while threatening to hit the US with one?  That has not been effective
@johnhornor Your post was misleading.  Headers like this are how we ended up with Fake News and Trump.
@floridarocket @PalmerReport This is like Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown.
@adamzyglis @MichaelfRizzo @TheBuffaloNews You act like he is the first to change his mind while in office. Obama changed his mind on a lot. Most notably was gay marriage
@RandiRhodes @Trumpbits @MalcolmNance Remember when that headline was Hillary to be arrested for contents of her email?  Good times...It's all BS.
@brianklaas @Trumpbits How disturbing. Who knew our elected officials make contradicting statements once elected?  This is a first.
@artistjerry @Alyssa_Milano No one said I was a trump fan. Your assumption based on me not agreeing with you is wrong.
@artistjerry @Alyssa_Milano Ok. You just changed my mind with that point.
@Chappie1947 @Grandpawgamer @Alyssa_Milano Terrorist Ted Kaczynski used envelopes.
@artistjerry @Alyssa_Milano Accomplished nothing?  Other than destroying one of their hubs and taking out a number of their fighters all with no civilian casualties.
@1IncredibleHull @Alyssa_Milano That would suck
@BhattiShamil @Alyssa_Milano All lives matter, except the one wanting me dead for no reason other than I pray to a different deity.
@Alyssa_Milano No more terrifying than the thought of a dirty bomb in your neighborhood.
@DrewGarrisonSBN No more inefficient than building it and letting it collect dust.  Far more efficient than sending soldiers into the caves on foot
@LouiseMensch @Trumpbits @HillaryClinton So are you saying Trump was right when he warned about voter fraud?
@Thunderballs2 @LouiseMensch @HillaryClinton Kind of like what the left is doing to Trump. These childish games needed to stop under Obama.
@mia_francesca9 @LouiseMensch @HillaryClinton If misogyny played a part she would not have won the popular vote. Neither are trustworthy
@Karnythia The worst possible thing that can happen is a govt that is 100% one party or the other.
@Karnythia It isn't right for me to force you to live by my standards, which are probably much different than mine because of the areas we live in
@Karnythia We need more moderates in office that are willing to work together for us. What is right for me is not necessarily right for you
@Karnythia In my opinion our reps stopped working for the people under Bush. Trump is the result of both bases trying to piss off the other side.
@ALLYSONFORSYTHE @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Alleged treasonous criminal because nothing has been proven.
@AllisonHazell @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump DNC colluded to make sure the their candidate was the only person Trump could beat, that is how we got here.
@soleilani @swingleft @DanaRohrabacher @IndivisibleCA48 What good is it if our leaders are on the same side when the people are not?  We need representation from both parties to get true progress
@taxmarch 10% of $1 million is a lot more than 30% of $100k
@thehill This just in...The cost of attending college in the NY just tripled for families earning $125,000 or more a year
@Mjay343 @LibyaLiberty What does this say about Hillary?  She was worse than the dumbest republican?
@jillralston30 @MarkRuffalo I was in collections a lot when I was young. I found if I was nice they worked with me. Older me knows it's easier to pay my bills on time.
@Coolhorsegirl @MarkRuffalo Just under 4 years at least
@Summerlover_5 @MarkRuffalo Asking people who borrowed money to pay it back is racist?
@jillralston30 @MarkRuffalo When the choice is to be a collection agent and get paid or starve and not feed your family, the decision is easy
@nancaroling @MarkRuffalo We will never know for sure.
@nytimes I have met many people more important than me including actors and athletes but I don't say I know them.
@RealJephNelson @TIME Free first class for life where ever Delta flies
@joshspurgers @Brad_Philly @Cernovich Your blood pressure is probably lower than mine
@heidihamilton Did you fly United?
@jilevin @JuddApatow Is it really a surprise?
@MarkRuffalo How does a republican win deal a blow to the GOP?  An ugly win is still a win.
@joshspurgers @Brad_Philly @Cernovich I bypass anything either of them put online. I follow both because I want to know what kind of crazy is out there.  140 is all I can handle
@joshspurgers @Brad_Philly @Cernovich I will agree when Maddow is off that station. Maddow = Britbart.  Social Media is full of keyboard warriors trying to look smart and tough.
@joshspurgers @Brad_Philly @Cernovich I agree.  Fox and CNN are just as biased only on different sides.  MSNBC is in a world of their own. Most social media leans left.
@joshspurgers @Brad_Philly @Cernovich Yes fox blows out Dem errors. Rep errors get blown out on MSNBC, CNN, and most written news feeds.
@brianhail @Cernovich Mayberry voted them in
@CTEBRgirl @runninintokyo @Cernovich I watched the press conference and knew what he meant but still cringed when he said it. Extremely poor example to use.
@wtcgroup @jennyyangtv Maybe the airline knew his record and chose him hoping we would look past their acts because of it.  It's only a quick search away
@Alyssa_Milano Oh lord...
@chelseahandler Does winning an election count?
@MarkRuffalo @HuffPostMedia 2 very different environments and targets.  Both equally tragic.
@Alyssa_Milano That's right, don't believe our president about anything but Do believe the leader of Russia. When he talks about Trump.
@1Love0neHeart @Alyssa_Milano Relax, this one has only lied to us for a few months.  The previous administration lied to us for 8 years. Same with the 2 before that.
@DanielMiessler No, you should expect the airline to honor the contract you have with them after they allow you to board the plane.
@brucedudley1 @kenvogel @JoyAnnReid @POTUS When this turns up squat, are you gonna be just as upset as the repubs with Hillary email and beghazi?
@PropAgile @kenvogel No, that was misogyny
@BronxLaugher @kenvogel @JoyAnnReid It's been proven the voting machines weren't hacked. The hacking he is talking about is the DNC hack. Podesta wasn't hacked, he was fished.
@XENAtheBA @robjshearer @voxrob @MaxineWaters @Shareblue He will get off just like Hillary because there was no intent.  Isn't that what Comey said about the classified emails on her server?
@chefman @SandraDunsmoor @iambrianlynn @jaimestein @MuskieMcKay @united Is Trump now responsible for all violent acts in the country?
@LisaLimonTx @MichaelfRizzo Looks like another week nothing on your list will be done. Might want to come up with achievable goals for the next one.
@Gottabite1 @Alyssa_Milano What did you say to people who felt the same exact way under Obama?  Opposite of your beliefs isn't necessarily wrong, it's just different.
@IamNukeLaloosh @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Hey meat. We knew there were PED's in baseball. People think Trump worked with Russia and want it to be treasonous.  Both are a waste of $.
@z196linux @nauga54 @Alyssa_Milano Wishful thinking. Trump Russia will turn up the same nothing as Clinton email.
@loveleigh101 @Alyssa_Milano 17th
@chrissyteigen @BRANDONWARDELL I generally don't want my dumbass comments to be retweeted.
@ShawnaGrafton @davidz_ssl @Alyssa_Milano I think your numbers might be off.  Recent stats show up to 95% killed in Obama drone strikes were not the intended target.
@StarDagger @Alyssa_Milano How many have suspiciously dead bodies are tied to Trump?  Same question for the Clinton's.
@finafyr @Alyssa_Milano Really?  Mass murderer wannabe?  How many died under Obama's drone strikes?
@lhhalstead @Alyssa_Milano @ericgarland Dems 2013 bombs away, 2017 he shouldn't have done that all while calling Russian propaganda an act of war.
@Theaetetus @JanineBliss @Alyssa_Milano @BarackObama @HillaryClinton Did you miss where Hillary said Trump should strike the Syrian airfields and said this is one thing he got right after he did?
@Karnythia I miss the days of accountability. We have become a society obsessed with winning and being both right and untouchable.
@CSRA_prsn @sismismo @ilyseh 2013 Reid used the same method to put all executive nominations and judicial appointees. SC was not included either was legislation.
@SphallSteve1245 @MichaelfRizzo The fact is Reid used it paving the way for Reps to use it too. When was the last time an SC nominee was Filibustered?
@LiberalDemIda @SphallSteve1245 @Naijai3 Only difference between the 2 is you agree with one side. Both parties do what is the best interest of the party, not the people.
@MattMackowiak @benshapiro Dems used it in 2013 for all pres nominations but SC. They forced the Reps to do this so they didn't have to when they control the house
@KathySilke @flippable_org @fawfulfan Both sides are currupt. Dems used the same option in 2013 for all appointees except for SC judge. Corruption is not 1 sided. Never has been
@JohnstonErwin @CBSNews Thanks. With all the crap floating around I must have killed the brain cells holding that info.
@JohnstonErwin @CBSNews I thought If this bad option goes thru they need 51, otherwise they would need 60. If they didn't have the 60 why not have a vote?
@CBSNews If Reps didn't have enough votes to confirm Gorsuch why would the Dems Filibuster?  Was it to force them to use the nuclear option?
@Mikel_Jollett @julesk_fighter Didn't Ried use the nuclear option in 2013 for all presidential nominations except for SC?  Why wouldn't Reps do the same to get their way?
@Mikel_Jollett Why is it called the Biden rule?
@AP They didn't block anything, only delayed it a bit.  They asked for the vote to be pushed to April 24th
@Karnythia Sorry to hear that. Keeping your dad in my prayers.
@Alyssa_Milano Gorsuch is the next justice
@thehill Anyone other than HC would have won. She might have won if she didn't assume she had certain states in the bag
@jennkleine @thehill This is not an indication of sexism. If America was still "so sexist" she wouldn't have won the popular vote. She took key states 4 granted
@JackFindlay3 @KTLA We have the right to bare arms and some really shouldn't.
@KTLA Who owns city hall?  This would make it possible to remove people who have opposing views to council members.
@DBleizeffer @MarkRuffalo Maybe next time
@mamasandyg @ZacharyLevi Hold on to them and offer them to unwanted guests.
@thehill It doesn't hinder access it cause doubt. The media is there for you to see. Now you have to decide who is lying on top of whats for dinner
@Alyssa_Milano Now you know how we got Trump.
@Karnythia Hoping your dad has a quick recovery.
@Shakespeare527 @thehill You do know that this option is only available because of Dems, right?  Dems aren't working to see Reps pov either.
@Meljanx @FOXLA @HalEisner @JerryBrownGov We did. They spent the money on other things. It is funny how they are trying to pitch another tax as a win for the taxpayer.
@FOXLA @HalEisner How about finally killing the bullet train that has already cost billions instead of raising our taxes again.
@thehill This would be news if it hadn't been said at least once a minute everyday since Trump won the electoral votes.
@kbecker66becker @sueannette4 @chelseahandler My wife disagrees with that premise. I just tried it and she yelled louder.
@DarStarr7 @IreneBeatrizz @Alyssa_Milano Over a year of investigation and they have yet to prove any criminal acts. What do you know that they don't?  Maybe you should share it.
@ShereeSwanson @Alyssa_Milano Maybe with the impeachment/prison combo  we know for sure they don't do anything for impeachment alone.
@sueannette4 @chelseahandler No need to snip at each other. I understand hatred but not blind hatred. I dislike people too but can also give props when they do good.
@oz_renick @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP So you want to get into a war with Syria too?  I thought Republicans were the war hawks.
@sueannette4 @chelseahandler I know. It is disgusting how Ivanka does not get paid for her role and DJT just donated his first 3 months pay to Park Services.
@MaryAliceBisho2 @Pamela_Moore13 How are they hero's?  They spent over a year on this and what have they found?  Don't you think it would be all over the news if they did?
@MarkRuffalo Democrats would never wrongfully slut shame women accusing a powerful man of harrassing them.
@StormChaseLisa @keithellison Glad that didn't have a chance to be proven. Just FYI, I vow to never win the lottery.
@NYCMayor @Alyssa_Milano @POTUS There is a difference between immigrant and illegal immigrant. Please stop blurring the lines. Very few think all immigrants must leave
@LouiseMensch @Trumpbits I think you mean why are THEY not in jail already. By your own comment he is not the only guilty party.
@MtgKaylesh Unfortunately either does my government.
@MtgKaylesh Mine do that too, mostly because I hide them. Parents have to have some fun too.
@MtgKaylesh There is a middle ground but no one wants to meet there. It really sucks because most of us are in the middle watching this trainwreck
@MtgKaylesh Thanks. My 3 year old twins are gonna wake up in about 4 hours. This should be fun.
@MtgKaylesh To help you out. But it is your responsibility to get off state help as soon as you can.
@MtgKaylesh Do as I say or you lose what you have kind of stuff. I believe you should ask for help when you need it and other will be more than willing
@MtgKaylesh At some point the state system can become a crutch and impose their will on the less fortunate by threatening their lifestyle.
@MtgKaylesh Nice meet you. I am in Southern California. Only reason I am awake is to drink water to hopefully avoid a hangover tomorrow.
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano I think the state should be a last resort, not the first option.
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano A paycheck. If you can't pay back on the track they laid out it is up to the individual to make arrangements and live up to them.
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano A loan is something you have to pay back, it is not a gift. It is the individuals responsibility to pay back loans they take by earning
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano I take it you live in the Netherlands based on the fact you are awake now and brought up their student loan system.
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano I will help people in need until they start taking advantage of me if I had the means to do so.
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano Everyone needs help at some point.  At what point do you go from being helpful to being a crutch?
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano And pay back any debt I accrued while I was legless and recovering.
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano Since we are living in the hypothetical world, I would do what it takes to get back on my feet and provide for my family once again.
@DaniGuzmanJim the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.  This was a hate crime.
@hale4jesus @BedBathBeyond Did you not read the post?  They are a large company and can't control all employees every move. They apologized for the rep. Move on.
@Lara5124 @BedBathBeyond Trump won the electoral not the popular so technically, there are more of them.
@Kittie56Michele @Alyssa_Milano @Khanoisseur Something has to give. Neither side is right about anything. The answer is in compromise.
@Kittie56Michele @Alyssa_Milano @Khanoisseur That is good to hear but with the current rift in our country it appears our officials only cater to one extreme or the other.
@Kittie56Michele @Alyssa_Milano @Khanoisseur Nice. I don't know him and based off a quick search it appears he is farther to the right than the norm.  I could be wrong.
@Kittie56Michele @Alyssa_Milano @Khanoisseur He seems a bit far right the be in touch with the average American.
@MtgKaylesh @Alyssa_Milano Share what and with who?  The only people entitled to my earnings are my family. If I choose to donate I should get to pick the benefactor
@Kittie56Michele @Alyssa_Milano @Khanoisseur Name 1 politician who is in touch with the average American. None of this is new, or news.
@FrankArmy Don't judge me. sometimes a great steak is worth some discomfort.
@ParkerMolloy @julesk_fighter Can't be and chooses not to be are totally different.  Maybe they have an agreement and he is respecting her wishes.
@RoryLennon01 @stacyherbert There are many far more qualified than those 2, but none who wants to put their family thru the destruction of a presidential campaign.
@FrankArmy Maybe but the joke is on you, I am a fat hairy man.
@FrankArmy @Groupon @DishNation I wouldn't ditch you, but I wouldn't put out either.
@BostonSophie New to Twitter, probably newer than you. New to reality, I'm guessing have been here a lot longer than you. Who were you quoting?
@RMMichaels @Karnythia Most of us can't drive when its dry out either. One of the reasons I drive a truck
@JeanaMamer @Karnythia It's not that bad if you get into your own bubble and watch the morons in action.
@chelseahandler until they find something based in fact and not feelings, thoughts or opinions.
@FHFshow @USATODAY guess I have to stop eating there now. BOO!!!
@BostonSophie @SoFlaSportsFan you know the box you check agreeing to the terms and conditions of the site?  That is you agreeing to it
@BostonSophie @SoFlaSportsFan who are you quoting?  Weed was legal until someone made it illegal. Either was tearing the tag off a mattress
@BostonSophie @SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman it's a product of tech advancing too fast. We can't catch all pitfalls proir to happening
@BostonSophie @SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman it wasn't illegal before. Obama passed a law that would have made it illegal. I was for that
@BostonSophie @SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman I think it is a terrible thing but I'm not in denial that it was happening before.
@BostonSophie @SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman this regulation was just passed and not yet in effect.
@BostonSophie @SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman because you said so?  What is your proof?
@facttrumpstrump @1PurrcentCat @KY_Heart1959 @Dr_G_Enigma @jeffpeguescbs both sides are to blame. DNC was shady, RNC let Trump win.
@easlreh @Reuters also part of the problem. We need to stop electing people only to oppose and annoy the other party.
@superfares @Reuters he is only a small part of the problem and we are to blame for the situation we are now in.
@bryanfunk1 @Reuters bipartisanship, much like accountability and common sense has been banned from DC for a long time now.
@MaryMey76544694 @Reuters we need all the help we can get is more like it. We are being run by kids who make demands instead of compromises
@SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman it's one of the reason I do most my shopping on my work computer...😀
@SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman your browsing history has never been private and has been sold many times over.
@SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman that has been shared for years. It is why you see ads for what you just looked at when you open your email?
@SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman it is something I teach my kids. Nothing you do online is private. Even pics posted on "private" boards
@SoFlaSportsFan @SarahKSilverman that happens already. Companies have people whose only job is to dig up social media posts for candidates.
@SarahKSilverman anyone who thought their internet search habits were private before this is confused.  The internet was never private.
@JamieObama @AP cool, so when does she get sworn in?
@SethAMandel @benshapiro people confuse freedom of speech with freedom from consequence. Say what you want, but you have to accept results
@justiceseeker03 @chelseahandler @realDonaldTrump they are so corrupt they got busted getting debate topics in advance. No, wait...
@thehill I demand our officials stop making demands that will never happen just to look tough. We are run by a bunch of whiny children.
@chrissyteigen I wouldn't invite you to a wedding. Already had one, not planning another. I would invite you to a BBQ though.
@Karnythia if I give up grilled salmon, can I still have smoked salmon?
@Karnythia I'm my house it's more like this	 "I'm cold."	"How are you cold?  It's 75 in the house."
@Brasilmagic @MichaelfRizzo fed govt should have little say in my life. Each state has different needs. State govt should regulate instead
@leahmcelrath @Alyssa_Milano we have become a society obsessed with winning. Until ACA is fixed or replaced, no one wins.
@theminnguy @hungryrealtor @Alyssa_Milano that's the problem. Neither side has been reasonable for the past 12 years and the result is Trump
@KAT1111984 @Alyssa_Milano both sides are full of liars.  Can't move on till both sides see this. Until then, Trump.
@theminnguy @hungryrealtor @Alyssa_Milano the problem is neither side is willing to listen to the other and that is reflected in our reps
@Sensfan16 @Alyssa_Milano we went from 8 years of blaming bush to 3 months of blaming Trump. Can Dems do anything wrong?  Besides pick HRC
@ezraklein @jonathanchait there is a ton of good in ACA but there is some bad too. Like raising premiums and deductibles.  this is not a win
@ezraklein so now if ACA fails it is Trump's fault?  How?  ACA was always a path the single payer. What upgrades were made since it launched
@jkarsh @Karnythia shifting blame is not new. Obama blamed bush and Republicans, DNC blames Russia, Trump blames everyone else.
@Alyssa_Milano don't you realize they don't care about our opinion. They tell us one thing to get elected then do what they want.
@serafinab_90 @Karnythia I have seen it only not a gf booting a bf, it was one roommate bouncing the other.
@ABC CA's next rainy season is in about 10 years. Should be enough time to fix the damn dam.
@rcrocket1 @Alyssa_Milano if pence is out then Ryan is in.
@Alyssa_Milano @Independent taking Feinsteins word about Trump as truth is like saying Hannity was right about Hillary all along.
@Karnythia I'm not much of a baker but I can grill a mean ribeye and smoke the heck out of a shoulder or trip tip. A cold drink is a given
@Karnythia @kurteichenwald It gives people a platform to hide behind a keyboard a spew nonsense with no accountability.
@Karnythia @kurteichenwald social media is the worst thing to happen to humanity.
@lisaxmay it has only been 2 months and everything he has done has been contested. Please don't make me defend him, give him a chance.
@Karnythia I agree but a mechanic and a Dr serve totally different purposes.  Both are skilled in their craft but one is more valuable.
@jparise858 @YourAnonNews only reason he won is Hillary was his opponent. Bernie would have beat him and we would still be recounting.
@siouxeeq nice talking with you. I'm happy we could disagree civilly.
@siouxeeq does not pass the sniff test
@siouxeeq Trump can't fart in his own bathroom without it being covered by people like Maddow yet she did not dedicate an hour to this
@siouxeeq since you aren't my boss I will tell you I have some down time at work and read a ton of news. I have only seen 1 story about this
@siouxeeq I agree.  Makes it look like he is hiding stuff but it is not a requirement to release taxes. Maybe it will be going forward
@McandrewTroy @joerogan @nytimes most of the people are good people, our elected officials are the 1% that make the rest of us look bad.
@siouxeeq if he was in violation of the emoluments clause that would be all over the news. It isn't.
@siouxeeq would you be ok if it is proven all profit from foreign govt is donated as he said it would be?
@siouxeeq I get it and am with you but we will never see returns prior to him swearing into office.
@siouxeeq what is unconstitutional about him not releasing his taxes?  Other than the whole need to know where his money comes from part
@siouxeeq @peacegalaxy @20committee easy to say when you are not in a position to pull the trigger.
@SenWarren @SageHillfarms I think the central problem in America is our overpaid elected officials act like kids instead of working together
@siouxeeq @peacegalaxy @20committee by grows a soul do you mean risk prison for releasing without permission?  Would you take that risk?
@YahooNews what did she think would happen when she dangled a golden carrot promising to prove they were right all along?  She fell short
@ezraklein @voxdotcom both sides are guilty of using cases which agree with their idea.  Both need to stop thinking their side is the norm
@Alyssa_Milano tying this to Trump is a bit of a stretch.
@mitchellvii @zainabrq that doesn't matter because they are covered by a policy they can't afford to use.
@Karnythia @angelsscream I always enjoy reading your side and appreciate the conversation. Have a great day.
@Karnythia @angelsscream and we don't have to agree. I just needed to speak out against the idea that the right want all immigrants to leave
@Karnythia @angelsscream I agree, silence is a form of consent. But I have been called names for speaking for deporting those here illegally
@Karnythia @angelsscream no argument there. Not all reps want all immigrants out. We are a nation of immigrants. Only the dumb deny this.
@angelsscream @Karnythia saying one side want all immigrants out is. There are some morons that do but a majority agree with your side.
@Karnythia @angelsscream and that is totally wrong but saying Repubs want all immigrants out contibutes to that idiocy.
@Karnythia @angelsscream I do realize that but saying people want immigrants out is misleading and causing some of the issues.
@angelsscream @Karnythia how do you not realize a majority of people are not against immigration but think Illegal immigration is an issue
@TIME it is because of weather.
@Cernovich how can they be elected on repeal and replace then when they get in office not have brain cell 1 to start coming up with a plan?
@MichaelfRizzo @TIME I didn't either but we all share the blame. He is what happens when we elect officials strictly to oppose the others
@MichaelfRizzo @TIME have they learned from their mistakes?  Trump is the result of disfunction on both sides. He is all of our fault
@MichaelfRizzo @TIME how many did Dems lose in the past 8 years? 1,030?  Including Congress, state and governorships?
@MichaelfRizzo @IorettaIynch they were wrong for being jerks about it, no argument there.
@MichaelfRizzo @TIME no, but a lot of Dems are. Why do you think that is?
@MichaelfRizzo @IorettaIynch ACA was supposed to limit that. It didn't. ACA is not perfect. IMO it never should've passed until it was.
@MichaelfRizzo @TIME all elected officials who refuse to work with each other should be voted out. Problem lies with us and how we vote
@MichaelfRizzo @IorettaIynch it's a problem, but lies from DC are not new or unique to the right. Remember the if you like your Dr line?
@IorettaIynch @MichaelfRizzo it is incredible we have been around this long and they are the 1st 4 politicians ever to tell a lie.
@Quiznos you post pictures of Togo's sandwiches?  Sweet!
@PrisonPlanet I hope she doesn't procreate.
@MIAARIBELL have to admit I only followed to get the rest of the story. It had me on edge till the end. Thank you.
@TIME either was Obamacare but no one cares
@YouHadOneJ0B bro, that is an epic sign. Now where did I put my flip flops?
@Alyssa_Milano me too
@Karnythia is that frowned upon?
@dbongino we went from 8 years of blaming W to 50 days of blaming Trump. Go to love accountability
@LarryAltman why was the 2nd guys bail the same as the first guy?  He proved he is a flight risk and at least 1 of the charges is a felony
@World_Wide_Wob @Cernovich you left out getting stuck in traffic.
@rowingtosweden @benshapiro you're ok with her saying he's a baby punching rapist but he is wrong for fixing her grammar? Wow. Priorities
@washingtonpost @PostEverything that is a great headline if you want to inflame a specific group and guarantee no one will read the article
@Alyssa_Milano reminds me of all the whats in Hillary's Email crap. This will net a big giant nothing.
@joerogan remember that next time he licks your face.
@Kissanurse75 @stuart0415 @john_macbean @suzaina8 @RealBenCarson this might be what he is referring to. https://t.co/ESkAietkak
@Impeach_D_Trump @genaro_inc because the golf course is the only place that isn't bugged, duh...
@HealyLee @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump that's not nice, @Schwarzenegger is not a has been yet.
@YouHadOneJ0B DAMMIT!!! I was so close. Dang gold star dependency...
@Karnythia nice talking to you. We might disagree on some of the issues but I'm glad we were able to talk a bit. Have a nice day.
@Karnythia did not enjoy the customers or working nights, holidays and weekends.
@Karnythia no, I think people are rude in general. I enjoyed my time in retail. Made some good friends and worked on commission.
@Karnythia the deli was cool. Free sandwiches when the boss wasnt looking...If I worked at an ice cream shop I would be huge right now
@Karnythia from there I went to retail. Worked at Sears selling hardware and paint. Should have stayed at the deli. Retail sucks.
@Karnythia how did you get a market research job at 16?  My Dad helped me with my first job and best I could do was sandwich maker...😀
@Karnythia I meant the type of job you had not the need to work. Sorry I wasn't clear on that point.
@Karnythia you were not the norm
@Karnythia that is where a majority of us gained work experience which allowed us to move up to where we are today.
@Karnythia what happens to all places like that if they had to pay $24 an hour today?
@Karnythia you provided a valuable service for them. I worked at a deli making sandwiches. The owner could not afford to pay more.
@Karnythia just trying to understand where you are coming from
@Karnythia I made $4.32 an hour. So a kid in SoCal should make $24 an hour with no experience or real education just because they live in CA
@Karnythia that would be nice but that puts the hourly pay between $14 and $24.  What about high school kids working their first job?
@Karnythia How much annually would you consider a living wage?
@ken_mcninch @joerogan there aren't many things that can beat a Santa Maria style tri tip smoked with oak.
@Alyssa_Milano or took him out to dinner.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump this isn't new. This has been happening way before Trump took office.
@randy_dahl @Alyssa_Milano how long did Obama serve?   What about Bill?  How many years was he in the service?
@Cernovich @SamHarrisOrg just do it already
@LoveTrumpsHate9 @LouiseMensch @PutinRF both parties are done as we know them. The establishment lost because it was shady. Enjoy the ride
@curtmilam @LouiseMensch @AndreaChalupa @PutinRF yeah, because he is known for quitting.
@Belairviv @LouiseMensch @LiberalsAreCool @PutinRF that will happen right after Dems admit they rigged the primaries against Bernie
@MasterMarquette @LouiseMensch @AndreaChalupa @PutinRF I think it goes to the house, which is Republican so still no Clinton.
@SportsGirlLiz @LouiseMensch if there was anything to show it would have come out instead of the Billy Bush audio. They have nothing.
@spindoctormario @TimRunsHisMouth none contributed without expecting favors. How is the Clinton foundation doing since she lost?
@janetgilmanolso @subzerov690 Everytime I see demand I picture lots of foot stomping and arm crossing with bitter beer face
@janetgilmanolso @subzerov690 name one elected official that has acted like an adult for the past 12 years.
@Truthbomb44 Ok. Have a good night. Nice talking to you.
@Truthbomb44 already said I didn't like the golf deal. Military I am more in favor of.
@Truthbomb44 we are paying for a lot of things that can be removed. I live in CA and pay for a train no one wants that will never happen.
@Truthbomb44 the cost of college increases exponentially.
@Truthbomb44 not all grads will own a business and employ others. the ones they employ pay the same % for the education they didn't get.
@Truthbomb44 I've struggled more than some, less than others. I was the reason I didn't go to school till later but I had every chance to go
@Truthbomb44 we all have a chance to go. Some take it others don't, it's not for everyone. Should those who don't have to pay for others?
@thehill this makes my brain hurt
@Truthbomb44 not just educated citizens, all citizens end up paying that tax.
@Truthbomb44 @JuddApatow @MarkRuffalo not a fan of Trump wasting our $ but there is no such thing as free college. Someone always pays.
@sanskrit4 @Lux55 @NewAmericanEcon but I would do the same thing they are doing if I was not fortunate enough to be born in the country.
@sanskrit4 @Lux55 @NewAmericanEcon how is wanting a better life for your family selfish?  Of course they should do it the right way...
@thehill it is BS like this that causes you to lose all credibility. I get free speech, but this is close to fire in a crowded building.
@Alyssa_Milano every senator and congressman has ties to Russia.
@bluskabucknut @Alyssa_Milano @robcorddry he was detained because he was breaking the law. He knew the risks when he came over the wrong way
@Marciablanco3 @MarkRuffalo @HuffPostPol ICE detention facility in Louisiana. It was in the article you didn't read.
@bluskabucknut @Alyssa_Milano @robcorddry and please remember who was president when Elian Gonzalez was picked up.
@bluskabucknut @Alyssa_Milano @robcorddry remember that when police arrest the person breaking in to your house.
@maggiesmithpoet @Alyssa_Milano @robcorddry what about when an avg of 855 people per day were deported under Obama?
@lisaxmay if killer whales can't kill anymore do we just call them whales?
@YouHadOneJ0B I would want to see what happens but probably end up telling them.
@synapze net a better result with someone who will make both sides happy.
@synapze and the only reason we were stuck with them is the divide between right and left. If we come together our next election will
@synapze my opinion is Trump is doing better than we are led to believe. I also believe both DT and HC were the worst possible choices
@synapze @chelseahandler good. Do you think that comments like you made only make his supporters dig in deeper causing a bigger gap?
@MMwritescanada @Evan_McMullin you already know the answer and Russia didn't have to interfere for Clinton since the DNC had that covered.
@synapze @chelseahandler have you cut ties with all people who don't believe as you do?
@synapze @chelseahandler so are you smarter than all of them or just unwilling to talk to any of them?
@synapze @chelseahandler I think they are past her emails now and are on to She Lost to the only person she could have beat.
@RealShawnKing @latimes @DougieP2016 @Sportmigos you are the reason they think all conservatives are racist.
@ABC he banned all immigrants from entering?  Oh, wait. This must be a liberal talking point to cast others as racists and anti-human.
@HuffingtonPost how was that roasting?
@ucla_007 @sallykohn the only people trying to suppress 1st amendment rights are the libs rioting to shut down conservative speakers.
@ddiamond didn't Obama ask if he could block Fox news?  Trump just didn't ask. Both are wrong.
@socal_american @FoxNews @HowardKurtz @POTUS press should be just as accountable for what they say as POTUS. Who holds them accountable?
@thehill 40% of registered voters didn't vote. They are bitching over something they could have prevented if they werent lazy or complacent
@gjbilger @CNNPolitics what?  Is lying new to politics?  If you like your bubble you can keep your bubble.  Until big bro regulates it.
@ChrisMurphyCT yeah. Our Congress is known for their cat like reflexes and lightning speed to action.
@ChatittaAlvarez @CNN I agree. No one leaves their home in search of status quo, but they accept the risk by crossing illegally.
@harmyx @DwightS94296988 @CNN 45% isn't even most using common core. I don't know now of a penalty for doing things legally, do you?
@Alyssa_Milano I agree with you 100%. Problem is no news source reports the news without bias because there is no money in honesty.
@lisaxmay driving w/o a license is a crime. If they are illegal they can't get a license, unless they lied about who they are which is fraud
@SenSanders what did you do to earn their money?  Probably as much as I did. Difference is I don't feel entitled to other people's money.
@marioraez1 @VeniceMase I say my tolerance for people is better when they are high. I can use that as an excuse for their stupidity.
@OnanuMD @VeniceMase unfortunately the restroom issue wasn't a law yet. Weed is still illegal which is also unfortunate.
@inZane86 @infowars justified for what?  He shot a gun because he got mad someone stepped on his grass and couldn't handle a group of kids.
@MyInfo26676503 @CFPetrella @Kaepernick7 @ShaunKing @LeftSentThis an injured person can still kill. Cops don't need retraining our kids do
@Alyssa_Milano seems there are many definitions of right vs wrong today. Who decides which one to use?  Right to you is wrong to others.
@chrissyteigen that is my version of heaven.
@NevilleLouann @BraddJaffy why should they?  Just so you can yell at them and tell your friends, "Yeah!  I got them good with that one!".
@NevilleLouann @wotdhel1 @BraddJaffy GOP got rid of unions?  Does anyone still paying union dues know this?
@thetrumpmafia @Cernovich Ok, so when Elizabeth Warren is elected in 20 and undoes everything Trump is doing where does that leave us?
@thetrumpmafia @Cernovich this us vs them will only divide us further. We need common ground to overcome our situation. United we stand.
@MarkRuffalo @HuffPostPol it starts with the parents of non trans kids. Teach them to not be a'holes and there is no issue.
@mtracey @Cernovich knowing the demographic of the area I would say it is not a great representation of the community.
@buckjoni @chelseahandler probably when you learn the difference between "are" and "our"
@BeKindOkk @chelseahandler James Otis is Apparently heir to the Otis Elevator Company. I don't think he needs your money.
@HopeLibertyLove @chelseahandler 3 years probation.
@benshapiro she said yes
@CBSNews I'm glad I'm not on that jury. It would be hard to hear someone try and defend or justify those actions.
@mitchellvii don't forget the daily show and Stephen Colbert.
@Slate there are so many to choose from, how do you prioritize?
@Inc @sonyaellenmann how is Trump forcing companies to choose sides?  Looks to me customers are pushing that issue.
@genaro_inc @HuffingtonPost I think that started while Obama was in office. Dems lost over 1030 federal and state seats.
@France4Hillary now you believe Russia?
@StobiePiel hit me up if you are right and I will admit I was wrong. Will you do the same if you are wrong?
@BellaLibelle @TeaPainUSA the one person who took responsibility for his actions and surrendered to police.
@BellaLibelle @TeaPainUSA you can't pick and choose which crime to be upset about when many were committed. You really can't be mad at
@BellaLibelle @TeaPainUSA charged. How many liberals surrendered for inciting and or participating in a riot?
@BellaLibelle @TeaPainUSA should. Was released and not charged because they might not have enough to charge him. Once they do he will be
@BellaLibelle @TeaPainUSA what about all the liberals throwing bricks and lighting fires?  Shooter turned himself in as a responsible person
@ladailynews CA welcomes all, as long as you believe as we do. If not then you can go to another state because you're not wanted here.
@BronxLaugher @StobiePiel @JillFilipovic Neither of us are gonna budge on DT. Milo was talking about kids. That is worse in my opinion.
@StobiePiel @BronxLaugher @JillFilipovic Russians don't know anything. You're stuck on Russia just like the repubs clung to emails.
@BronxLaugher @StobiePiel @JillFilipovic no proof he assaulted any women. Walking in on girls is the same level of bad as what Milo said.
@curtprich @JillFilipovic @AmandaMarcotte big difference between boys and women. No one approves of children being abused.
@BronxLaugher @StobiePiel @JillFilipovic what has Trump *actually* done that is worse than what Milo said?
@peterdaou @MichaelfRizzo spreading propaganda is not the same as hacking. Changing minds is legal, changing votes after the fact is hacking
@williamjordann Milo was invited to speak that night and was blocked for being a "fascist" by people acting like fascists.
@DaleJr but, did he answer your question?
@RyanTaylorReal @nak_mkw I was taking about Berkeley where he was invited and shut down by riots. The CPAC issue is different and valid.
@RyanTaylorReal @nak_mkw he was invited to speak which gave him the right.
@Brasilmagic this is not specific to him. It appears all of us are guilty of dismissing news that opposes our beliefs as fake or lies.
@nak_mkw @RyanTaylorReal he wasn't supporting Milo. He was supporting his right to speak PRIOR to this new video.  Timing is everything.
@Megs1492 @kylegriffin1 @PrincessBravato we all chose this by electing people who refuse to work with the other side.
@MichaelfRizzo not to defend him but the country has been divided for the past 12 years and has gotten progressively worse every year.
@Slate anyone who didn't use a sick day or plan ahead for a vacation day deserved to be fired.
@chicfire45 @RonWyden @cdelbrocco where were all these facts during the campaign?
@jerryjamesstone @ColeFloFlo @CNN reverse sear is a way to grill a steak. I would lie to them about not eating meat.
@FabbrisHair @BoogsterSU2 @CNN to me the worst part is no meat products.
@FabbrisHair @BoogsterSU2 @CNN if you were a Trump supporters, why would you want to live there anyway?
@ColeFloFlo @jerryjamesstone @CNN I would lie to them then a week later let them walk in on me reverse searing a rib eye.
@kristinlaun @SaIIyYates @PlumpyTrumpy to be fair, Trump pissed Mexico off when he announced he was running for office
@kimmyd525 @NabilaHaniss @ChelseaClinton it was proven Bill assaulted women it was not proven Trump did. Do you have proof Trump did?
@thehill why does this matter?
@chrissyteigen the one in front of you
@weloveamerica17 @Amy_Siskind @JoyAnnReid while I might disagree about the results of his policies I hear you and appreciate your opinion.
@Jamesdo222 @Amy_Siskind @YahooNews have you started your bunker yet?  Mine was started during Obama.
@volduckmike @Amy_Siskind @JoyAnnReid @YahooNews I'm with you on both points. Although detest might be a bit strong for me.
@POTUSTrump11 @Amy_Siskind @JoyAnnReid I thought WikiLeaks was the devil.
@blu03boy @Amy_Siskind Dems are not much, if any smarter. Kind of sad both sides look at the other as morons and lemmings.
@weloveamerica17 @Amy_Siskind @JoyAnnReid that is kind of why he won, to destroy the political system as it stands.
@donald_fitzhugh @Amy_Siskind @JoyAnnReid @YahooNews only an unbiased press can be trusted which removes foxnews, CNN, MSNBC and the rest
@Riela2 @Amy_Siskind they should ask Hillary how she did it.
@_WhatRachelSaid @AnInquisitor are you aware CNN is just as biased as fox?  Saying thing you agree with does not change bias
@DaniGuzmanJim they lost me at no meat. What would I throw on the grill if they say no meat?
@JeffHartle @Cernovich @TheStreet but since you brought it up, IMO a business that refuses to serve other based on lifestyle will close soon
@JeffHartle @Cernovich @TheStreet I know sarcasm doesn't come across in text but I thought I would give it a shot anyway.
@Cernovich how dare you walk into a restaurant, unknowingly disagree with their political beliefs and expect to be served. Smh...
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME arrested too which happens in raids.
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME under Obama, so far those here illegally with a record are the targets. Others here illegally have been
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME people who come here illegally do so knowing there is a risk and they have accepted the risk. Just like
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME I sympathize with them. They did not ask to be brought here but were brought by their parents.
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME stay here too?  What about dreamers with criminal records?
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME so will you support his order if the dreamers are protected?  What about their parents?  Do they get to
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME again, either did the way the order was written but the rhetoric Trump spews when he speaks killed it
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME that was not in the order he signed. It was in the dumb stuff that came out of his mouth.
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME they were not happy with the change and voted for more drastic change.
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME put up the wrong person against the other wrong person.  People voted for Obama on hope and change
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME Trump is a moron who only won because people were tired of the same stuff over and over again and the dems
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME accepted but not when it happens under Trump?
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME deporting people here illegally?  Obama deported an average of 855 people a day for 8 years. How was that
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME but he did block all travel from a country for 6 months. Why was that constitutional and Trump's not?
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME granted Obama did not say all thing dumb thjngs leading up to it that Trump did
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME what has he done that is unconstitutional?  The "Muslim" ban?  That was also done under Obama.
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME most of his base are not racist xenophobes and will block anything close to that.
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME right, because we haven't learned from our past. We are all morons and will let that happen again. Got it.
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME you're right, we don't know the future but I am 99% sure internment camps will not be making a come back
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME you do know he is not gonna round them up and put them in camps, right?
@PhoenixWytch @theo9873502 @TIME which one?  There are quite a few dark times is history.
@jrodfromoz can you park it outside of my office?
@USHEMP @FoxNews didn't Hillary win the popular vote?
@democracynow they know they are taking a risk by entering illegally. I sympathize with them but in the end the result is not on us.
@MichelleDunla12 @PJM143 @DropTheTap @pattonoswalt yeah he is. I did the math before I posted but it would have killed my argument so Shhhhh
@Bambiquinn @chelseahandler they are not immigrants when sitting in international water.
@shaunlysen @paulrobertsGA @lwalshmill @Pontifex he has called it a ban and his anti Muslim rhetoric is what killed the original order.
@RatedArrrrrr @PJM143 @DropTheTap @pattonoswalt 3 times in 4 weeks. Wow. The nerve
@RatedArrrrrr @PJM143 @DropTheTap @pattonoswalt sorry you don't like differing opinions. Back to your safe space. Enjoy.
@RatedArrrrrr @PJM143 @DropTheTap @pattonoswalt topic was Trump golfed 3 times in 4 weeks number of times Obama golfed is relevant.
@DropTheTap @PJM143 @pattonoswalt there is a difference between defending and comparing. Stop holding Trump to a higher standard than Obama
@chelseahandler that's cute how you think the working man can afford $100k for a club membership.
@RatedArrrrrr @PJM143 @DropTheTap @pattonoswalt we all know W took more vacation that Obama. That wasn't the point but nice deflection.
@PracticalLefty @TheCloser16 @Tallulahs_Ghost like it or not Trump is president because of the political divide. It is both parties fault.
@theClaudiaInez @pattonoswalt there is nothing wrong with free beer!
@PJM143 @DropTheTap @pattonoswalt Obama played 306 rounds of golf in his 8 years in office.
@mitchellvii it has only been 4 weeks. A bit early to claim victory in my opinion.
@speakeasy583 @chelseahandler is a troll anyone who disagrees with you?
@dllerma @chelseahandler @LittlemRX do you really think this is the first time another country has done this?
@parkerk1954 @chelseahandler proof of pee please or are you also taking the Russians word on this
@Syr829 @chelseahandler @StopNuclearWar but the hacked DNC emails weren't valid...
@Rosethornnane @chelseahandler depends on what tje definition of "is" is.
@Bambiquinn @chelseahandler do you think this is the first time a foreign ship has been anchored in international waters?  Nothing new.
@michaelsookee76 @chelseahandler did you watch the press conference?  That's not what he said.
@ChirpCaseyChirp @chelseahandler if there is fire when you pee you need to see a Dr.
@PeevedMichelle @chelseahandler proof please. Or are you taking the Russians at their word?
@aamiac @chelseahandler their argument is, "she isn't president!"
@SandyMarieN @chelseahandler @Native_Hashtags sadly this is all hearsay but 87% of Dems take it as fact
@16campaignbites @chelseahandler @Jugbo Trump peed on was not proven. The NSA job is a shit sandwich. Would you want it?
@eledawva @chelseahandler you are aware he acknowledged it was there, right?  Or was that an attempt at humor?
@lynlu07 @Alyssa_Milano @CNNTonight @AC360 what if he is investigated and vindicated?  Will you change your mind?
@pickmand07 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump sad part is people only believe what they agree with. The other side is always wrong.
@MatWBT @Alyssa_Milano @the_moviebob people do change their mind but I guess that only matters when it fits your argument.
@MatWBT @Alyssa_Milano @the_moviebob in 2013 Hillary was against gay marriage. When Obama took office he was also against gay marriage.
@spiderlou2099 @Alyssa_Milano you need help
@DerrickBergman @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump is the Republican party the only party that lies?  Dems stick to their side also.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonald this probably would have been more effective before he became president.
@nickbilton at least it is an upgrade from Hitler.
@tedlieu the AP article you are referring to is about a draft that never made it to Kelly's desk.   https://t.co/8WZ9fQwV63
@BernieSanders how is that different than passing ACA before reading it as Pelosi recommended?
@mfwooten1  you might be right. I interpreted the statement based on things @VanJones68 has said in the past about the giant oompa loompa.
@mfwooten1 @VanJones68 I am fat and bald it is done with some spite
@mfwooten1 @VanJones68 my friends and family call me fat and bald, because I am in fact fat and bald. Anyone who does not know me calls says
@mfwooten1 @VanJones68 I get it and somewhat agree but since when is name calling not done in a somewhat hateful way?
@mfwooten1 yes his skin has the fake tan hue.
@mfwooten1 @VanJones68 not my point. If you preach fight with love, then calling names out of hate is contrary to your message.
@VanJones68 isn't calling DT Orange menace showing hate and hypocritical to your statement of love?
@JessLGames @mashable also a good question. Probably gold plated.
@geowest96 this is a clip of a video prefaced with what @BraddJaffy wanted you to hear and distract from what was actually said.
@pd_arrington @BraddJaffy did you watch the video?  Did you hear him say he was going to sink the ship?  He said he wasn't going to.
@BraddJaffy how was that musing about blowing up the ship?  You worked extra hard to twist this one up.
@mashable I want to know where he is buying his drugs.
@HuffingtonPost so it is the media's job to keep him inline but he is totally unhinged when he calls them out. Got it.
@ssaustx @oxminaox have to agree with you on that point. Yours didn't teach you when to use a comma.
@SherriEShepherd @realDonaldTrump for lying to Pence. Usually people who don't do anything wrong don't lie to cover up their honesty
@benshapiro not yet but thanks for giving them the idea
@Evan_McMullin how is leaking classified information to reporters for a story defending the Constitution? If that is what happened.
@JaxAlemany @benshapiro what if he is right?
@MyCat4Prez @JWilsinatra @thehill don't ignore it but find a new shop and tell your friends what haopened. The shop will eventually close
@Shirley_I_Jest @thehill i agree with you but why would you want to do business with someone who doesn't want to do business with you?
@c_cauterucci @Slate it's a result of tanking subscriptions. Let's be honest, people read the articles to get to the pics.
@abu_trump @NBCNews you too.
@abu_trump @NBCNews I can only imagine. I am not cold hearted, I just appear that way on social media.
@BJMrozek1 @laurenduca @Ravager619 I enjoy taking to people with other views and never mean to attack or come off trollish.
@abu_trump @NBCNews I'm sorry you were inconvenienced thru that order. empathy is better but enforcing immigration laws is not cruel.
@abu_trump @NBCNews that is not what we are taking about. And it wasn't a ban on Muslims. It was a bad idea rolled out even worse.
@abu_trump @NBCNews all part of the legal process for entry. We are all seeking a better life, most of us do it without breaking laws.
@abu_trump @NBCNews Ok. Do we show empathy to all who break the law or just the people here illegally?
@Patrici76267702 @NBCNews there is a pathway to citizenship. It is called legal immigration.
@rolypolyistaken @Cernovich because they need protesting. The rest of us can wait for the cops to show up
@rolypolyistaken @Cernovich you have to prove your life is in grave danger and they will still deny. Unless you are a state senator
@BJMrozek1 @laurenduca @Ravager619 then you are one of the few. Most of my lib friends call anything opposite of their view fake or lies
@MyPetGloat @jeremyscahill @billmaher isn't Milo Jewish and gay?
@DesertWolfPS @Manfeelings90 @TitsyMcGee @SNOOPaLUPE @jeremyscahill so you beat the ones who want to hear him. That makes sense.
@CranBoonitz @Sean_Drohan @StaceyR55146083 @VillagersMang @turambar112 @n8r0n74 @Luvina_things @Soverpowered just lame opinions.
@CranBoonitz @Sean_Drohan @StaceyR55146083 @VillagersMang @turambar112 @n8r0n74 @Luvina_things @Soverpowered 0 of those pics prove fascism
@CranBoonitz @Sean_Drohan @StaceyR55146083 @VillagersMang @turambar112 @n8r0n74 @Luvina_things @Soverpowered not to defend the DB but
@Cernovich @jeremyscahill not true. They opted for option 3 at Berkeley. Now options are debate, run away or block free speech with fire.
@BJMrozek1 @laurenduca @Ravager619 why are you condemning them for doing the same thing you would do?
@MeliNMatthewa @laurenduca same as Dems not believing released DNC emails. They were more upset about that leak.
@IAmHerPersist @laurenduca and those who oppose him will believe anything that makes him look bad and nothing that makes him look good.
#OneWordOffBooks Fun With Dick and Chains
@Makesickloggins @Mikel_Jollett valid or not all the BS is what cost her.
@Makesickloggins @Mikel_Jollett it wasn't the lack of male parts that lost it for her, it was the cloud of shadyness surrounding her
@Makesickloggins @Mikel_Jollett but HC was the wrong candidate.
@Makesickloggins @Mikel_Jollett you think Trump's campaign was the only one that lied?  Admittedly he made it an art form
@Mikel_Jollett @Makesickloggins @realDonaldTrump and yet she still lost. Could it be that some found her less than trustworthy?
@nytimes looks like all Dems are getting voted out for not listening to their base
@thehill this situation is horrific if true but weren't Dems saying to ignore DNC emails because they were leaked?  Different but not really
@dealwithron @nytimes and Hillary asked if they could drone Julian Assange while secretary of state. Guess she can joke but Trump can't.
@kevinarnovitz make them watch it so they know the true meaning of time lost
@business no difference here. Just like under Obama some with no record have been arrested.  But if it makes you feel better you're right
@TeckieGirl @funder everyone one knows BO only shut down DAPL because he knew DT would open it again. If HC won DAPL never would've stopped
@joerogan an atomic bomb is a type of nuclear bomb. The other type is hydrogen. Someone is trying to flex their brain and ran out of cells.
@DGChristensen @ThatChrisRyan they are progressing thru the 5 stages faster than expected. Probably regress at some point near summer.
@DGChristensen @ThatChrisRyan no argument from me there. I blame rap music and bad parental upbringing.
@DGChristensen @ThatChrisRyan that would go over like a fart in church with the Dems.
@business only reason Obama deporting 2.5 million didn't cause the same is it didn't get the coverage.
@ThatChrisRyan OK, but who will be acting President in the mean time. Pics of Obama show he is having way too much fun to come back.
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven sorry for the rant. I'm new to this Twitter thing...
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven undo what was previously done or obstruct what needs to be done.
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven we need our reps from both sides to pull their heads out and start negotiating instead of finding ways to
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven as Americans we are under the belief we are owed happyness but that doesn't mean always getting what we want
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven I had an issue then and I have one now. How can we advance when our reps won't do their job?
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven much like the reps during Obama the Dems have 0 interest in working with him.
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven how do you expect him to act when he has been face to face with hate since he announced his intent to run?
@thehill bunch of spoiled children running our country no wonder the sense of entitlement has been growing faster than inflation.
@thehill nothing since bush vs gore has been normal. Why should this be different?
@andrewmcgill @DemoFacts @TheAtlantic no problem. I am sure I am in the minority on this. The colors make sense if you do more than glance
@PolitiSass @HomeChasingANut @leftytgirl @SenWarren name one politician who thinks they aren't above the law.
@DemoFacts @andrewmcgill @TheAtlantic doesn't help I am building my own charts for work using the same charts and color schemes.
@DemoFacts @andrewmcgill @TheAtlantic sorry. Analyst eyes. Red means bad
@DemoFacts @andrewmcgill @TheAtlantic unless you think only Republicans lie
@DemoFacts @andrewmcgill @TheAtlantic coincidence Republican cabinets take longer than Democrat?  It appears lies have nothing to do with it
@TheAtlantic @AdrienneLaF everything is easier said than done, except talking that is about the same.
@AdamBaldwin I wonder if he would believe them if they reported Trump had no knowledge.
@roxanna_3000 @WarpedSage only have opinions based off of what news source we believe in because the others must be fake, right?
@roxanna_3000 @WarpedSage and you do?  The only people who know what we are taking about are the ones in the room. The rest, all of us
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven so it is more important to assign blame and be right than to hope we come together as a country?  Got it.
@greyscape444 @roxanna_3000 @rileysven @thehill are you smarter than anyone you disagree with or do you just play this way on Twitter?
@greyscape444 @roxanna_3000 @rileysven @thehill has different beliefs.
@greyscape444 @roxanna_3000 @rileysven @thehill no, failure is the worse outcome for us and the world. But go ahead and  keep hoping he
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven @thehill you do realize if he fails it impacts all of us not just his supporters, right?
@thelovemaster @midnight stop it!  I have to go to bed and these are keeping me up laughing
@roxanna_3000 @rileysven @thehill really glad to see you enjoy the mess that is happening just because you don't agree with his beliefs.
@rileysven @thehill when did she get sworn in?
@stevewaggs @mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump best qualified don't want the job. That's how we got stuck with those 2 options.
@washingtonpost my son plays with his sister's doll house. He puts his hot wheels in it and calls it a garage.
@LynnyontheFly @MisteCaulder @Cernovich it was and still is. If it is allowed to continue it will tear us apart.
@MisteCaulder @Cernovich If any of Obama's advisors did the same thing you would be demanding their heads just like the libs are doing now
@sahouraxo @Cernovich it gives them the glimmer of hope and the ability to say I told you so.
@joansbiz @AdamBaldwin that position is appointed, not confirmed by Senate. The More You Know...
@PrisonPlanet he is getting better at the whole handshake thing.
@simonhedlin @TomiLahren Russians have been trying to interfere in our elections since the beginning of time. It is not a new thing.
@MichaelfRizzo DAMMIT!!  I HATE WHEN I FORGET HOW TO READ!!!
@MichaelfRizzo your question was "He isn't changing the American people, right?". As an American person I have not changed.
@VeniceMase might have to test that theory
@MichaelfRizzo I haven't changed and none of my friends have changed. Have you changed?
@jd_Constitution @ShafPatel @KellyannePolls if you change Islam to stupidity and Muslims with Morons I would agree with you.
@LocalSP1 @chelseahandler @realDonaldTrump does the sun ever shine in your world?
@Cernovich my pulse
@YahooNews @YahooMovies it is easy to criticize when you are not part of the working class.
@Jackapedia_ @NPR I don't think you have to tell him that.
@mitchellvii just my opinion.
@mitchellvii we need to get over the idea that winning is more important than the country and work together for the common good.
@mitchellvii while the lefts people are more vocal the rights opinions were the same. How does this help us as a nation?
@mitchellvii this asshattery is not new just reversed. For the past 8 years our elected officials have been acting the same way.
@jenstatsky he has been golfing for a long time and it hasn't happened yet so I'm thinking lottery type odds.
@BarryHingley @NancyPelosi @FBI @POTUS yeah, it was the FBI's fault she ignored the rust belt states and the working class.
@KHolm77 @washingtonpost no, I think it is sad. I also think she committed a crime by using an SSN that was not hers.
@onetruebritt @metadinex @PussyGrabsBack2 @TheEconomist that's me saying nut up and get a job so you can vote for whoever. Not whining.
@LibertyGyrl nice talking to you.
@KHolm77 @washingtonpost I did read the article. 75% of the sweep had felony convictions the rest misdemeanors or were here illigally.
@KHolm77 @washingtonpost a crime meaning 9% were "non-criminals".
@KHolm77 @washingtonpost Obama didn't? According to https://t.co/7njlOx3fBR 91% of the people he deported had previously been convicted of
@LibertyGyrl the ones you agree with as absolute truth. That is what they all want.
@LibertyGyrl prove he still has ties to his business and is profiting from the government. The info is out there you can't just take
@LibertyGyrl to whom is he denying basic human rights?  Ties to Russia are hearsay as of right now but I will give you suspicious.
@LibertyGyrl what has he done that you can prove is against the law?
@metadinex @PussyGrabsBack2 @TheEconomist only 28?  By 28 I had been working for 13 years and on my own for 9 years.
@LibertyGyrl who says I am not annoyed with what is happening?  What is more annoying is having to defend Trump over blind hatred.
@LibertyGyrl things Trump does that scream for valid criticism.
@LibertyGyrl and if you are tired of the "Obama did it too" reply quit picking points that beg for that reply. There are SO many other
@LibertyGyrl Trump did not make it a public display. Media did. Media also made the fact that Obama deported an avg of 855 a day quiet.
@karaswisher I hope your new band is better than Creed.
@washingtonpost Obama deported 2.5 million people. That is an average of 856 per day while in office. Where was your outrage then?
@LibertyGyrl @Reuters yes, routine. Obama deported 2.5 million undocumented immigrants.
@janelynne @Reuters did you read the article or just judging because of the header?
@YahooNews Don't say it Joe!!  It isn't true!!
@chrism573 @Allowaay @TheEconomist so is accepting statistics without examination. Not enough data here to accept or dismiss as false
@HFAreddit and I was gonna workout, but I didn't.
@abc7davekunz @ABC7 have to have your headlights on if your wipers are working. That way you can see how bad everyone else drives in rain
@DailyBreezeNews how about they were here illegally and then a majority of them committed another crime.
@chelseahandler do you find it ironic what you just said has been said by the other side for the past 8 years?
@shawn_everhart @ponyexpress_gsc @BOLG8TR @SenFeinstein I would but the weather really sucks anywhere else.
@Impeach_D_Trump replace Democrats with Republicans and Trump-Russia with Hillary-Email. We have seen this movie before.
@SheWhoVotes @floridarocket he probably owns stock in Nordstrom's and knew speaking out would have this effect.
@France4Hillary yeah. Boycott Trump!  Great original idea. In the end he will still be rich and will still be President.
@GrapefruitJello @thehill if the Dems put up a better candidate we would never know half the country is mentally ill. Good job.
@JimmyTusheets @YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric just chili and cheese for me.
@JimmyTusheets @YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric thank you.
@JimmyTusheets @YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric like the sinking feeling you get after eating Tommy's on the way to a Dodger game
@JimmyTusheets @YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric didn't she cancel it when voting closed?  Playing a hunch?
@JimmyTusheets @YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric maybe she knew she wasn't gonna win.
@JimmyTusheets @YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric nope. "borrowed" from brother in law.
@JimmyTusheets @YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric rush's book was great for starting my smoker.
@JimmyTusheets @YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric just thinking it is odd timing for a senator who is not known for taking to press.
@YahooNews @SenWarren @katiecouric this will be great publicity for her book.
@brettmorrison @thehill @ACLU I'm thinking Monday.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump not to hate but the numbers might be rounded.
@SenSanders you do if they are ignoring the rules. This is the problem with society now. No one is accountable for their actions anymore.
@Alyssa_Milano my guess would be context. She was using it to degrade while others were not.
@chelseahandler I might be going out on a limb here but I don't think Trump is the first one to do this, just the first one you hated.
@ABC another reason to watch something else.
@RepBrendanBoyle @VanJones68 maybe if our elected officials weren't so set on opposing each other they would be able to stop what you fear.
@nytimes this is the result of a government blinded by partisanship.
@KeithOlbermann is Trump the only president to fill his cabinet with people who agree with him?
@YahooNews Hillary joked about hitting Julian Assange with a drone strike. Where was that story?
@thehill this is what happens when 2 parties are so completely against each other. The people suffer because of childish attitudes by both
@SariHorwitz @washingtonpost Dems play loopholes too. It is not one sided. We need officials who want to work together not block each other
@areacomedian @POTUS you left out, with his bare hands and a popsicle stick.
@CMillerWrite go ahead and boycott. That will leave more for me.
@CanstrCa @dented1one @popdorn @KaraCalavera daughter and if I heard anyone talking about them in that way there would be issues.
@CanstrCa @dented1one @popdorn @KaraCalavera please don't think I am trying to normalize his behaviour. I am not. I have sisters and a
@CanstrCa @dented1one @popdorn @KaraCalavera I understand that is the problem. He said he could grab them not that he did grab them.
@latimes by saying nothing she said everything.
@LizHabib one more reason to hate the Pats
@dented1one @popdorn @KaraCalavera @CanstrCa neither is acceptable but one is definitely worse
@dented1one @popdorn @KaraCalavera @CanstrCa words vs actions. We know one absolutely did touch others and the other said he could.
@dented1one @popdorn @KaraCalavera @CanstrCa bill was caught lying about catching a bj in the oval office from an intern and then impeached
@ESPNSteinLine it's all your fault
Good night Twitter. You have kept me entertained enough to stay awake and drink enough water so I won't be hungover tomorrow.
@AngryLogician @BBCWorld @BBCNews government has been offensive since they decided to stop working together.
@cinemalins @marburyjack @Ksguy77 I like the turkey legs myself.
@ExtremeInfidel @LadyDiane057 @mhruza1975 @DavidGMcAfee @realDonaldTrump @TheOfficialPORP run everything.
@ExtremeInfidel @LadyDiane057 @mhruza1975 @DavidGMcAfee @realDonaldTrump @TheOfficialPORP the worst thing that can happen is to have 1 party
@Victori40970124 @CeeBre @MiladySkye @brad_oland @ZaneTheSane @TammyRRay2 and use that knowledge to come to common ground and fight together
@Victori40970124 @CeeBre @MiladySkye @brad_oland @ZaneTheSane @TammyRRay2 never mute the voices you don't agree with.  Learn from them
@MichaelfRizzo @RoguePOTUSStaff cool. Just curious because he can be unhinged at times.
@MichaelfRizzo have you confirmed @roguepotusstaff is actually on the staff or are you just taking them on their word?
@TeaPainUSA the problem with polls is almost all of them had Hillary winning.
@KarenAl46190326 @KMacMusic @realDonaldTrump you can tell fire in a crowded room the consequence is you will be arrested.
@KarenAl46190326 @KMacMusic @realDonaldTrump free speech is not free from consequence.
@FOXLA worst news ever.
@AoDespair @KamBrothers @gdholtby protest and cause a scene. The minute you start burning and breaking stuff you lose your message.
@latimes how can it possibly go any slower?  Just kill it already.
@thehill where can I get these pills?
@jk_rowling lucky you
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid I agree with you but the 35% in not all on one side.
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid total morons and blinded by hate. The others are smart people and grouping them together is not they way to swing them
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid that is your opinion and the opinion of a majority of the country, including me but others disagree. A good portion are
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid have been smarter than we were.
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid yes they did and they poisoned the minds of millions on both sides of the aisle. That is the problem. We should have
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid was it authoritarian when Obama was signing EO's?  The people can stop him but not if we are so divided.
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid and to encourage the elected officials to obstruct because "they did it for 8 years" won't help us as people
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid your chosen candidate was you, as in people not actually you, voted for them because of hatred for the other side.
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid I'm not arguing that at all.  The people have become so divided over the past 12 years that no matter how full of shit
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid we have become more concerned with winning than with what is being said and that is sad.
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid our democracy will vanish faster than we think.
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid the path changes with the people and who we elect to office. If we keep putting up officials who refuse to work together
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid I never said accept. Most of the stuff is crap but to do what they did to Obama is the same level of silly
@ealison @monsmaark @Impeach_D_Trump @HISTORY so https://t.co/luJ8Hk4OC9 is wrong, you are right based on what? He still lived there?  Ok
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid opposite views is the hurdle to coming together.
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid I have said before, the best thing Trump can do is unite the people either with him or against him. But attacking
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid but the rhetoric of choking progress vs toxic BS is not helping anything. The GOP felt the same as you about Obama
@Ptaray @JoyAnnReid I agree the GOP has conveniently forgot their proud record of obstruction thru Obama which equaled a child tantrum
@ramonashelburne what do you consider a real journalism outlet?
@CarreauStrauss @TIME the article is talking about refugees which are legal immigrants.
@TIME all legal immigrants help make America great.
@WtfAmerica4 being blocked by people who can't handle someone else's opinion, is this supposed to hurt my feelings?
@billoram @MarkG_Medina there is a good chance he hasn't seen a lot of anyone commiting terrorist acts since moving here.
@Slate that's right. We should all live in a constant state of panic and fear until libs occupy every elected position. They know best
@kenLumken77 @Impeach_D_Trump @LiberalResist that is exactly what the Republicans did in 2008. How does it feel to be the same as they were?
@ealison @monsmaark @Impeach_D_Trump real facts. He was impeached but not removed from office. https://t.co/46nsuFX0aX
@joe_nca @FITNIF @lkristinexoox @AllyKadel @Impeach_D_Trump 24.9 billion USD
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 let me know about that hug
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 I was just wondering why you said I was 100% bullshit when I was at most 3% full of shit.
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 I was wrong on 1 point which I clarified. Doesn't make the rest of the statement wrong.
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 it wasn't bullshit and I'm not offended. Just having a discussion.
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 or a hug.
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 what I said was accurate except for the mistake I admitted to. you seem like you need to talk
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 I admitted I had the department wrong. that is what people do. doesn't prove I'm full of shit.
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 so you have no facts to back up your claim that I am full of shit?  Cool.
@ericdrunk @JenniferMeyer6 @NBCNews @PressSec are people on her team who agree with the order and would have done a good job defending it.
@ericdrunk @JenniferMeyer6 @NBCNews @PressSec she was fired for telling her entire Dept not to defend the order. I am fairly certain there
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 nice talking to you too. Enjoy the match.
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 is there more to your statement or are you just venting?
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 she stuck to her guns, which in these days is admirable but her termination was justified.
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 anything in favor of Trump.
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 only thing I found was the report on Huffington Post and we both know they would never post
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 happen to agree with.
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 top lawyer is sworn to uphold legal orders to the best of their abilities not just the ones they
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 an article in the Huffington Post states the order is legal but not a good idea.
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 bad of an idea it is, the order is legal
@tonymurf6969 @RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 I misspoke. Office of legal counsel approved the legality of the order. That means no matter how
@RacistJohnTrump @DSchill44 @tonymurf6969 the order was reviewed and deemed lawful by the DOJ. AG decided she wouldn't support a lawful EO
@stoofer2 @thehill and to not judge people until you know them
@stoofer2 @thehill I have 2 kids, twins and no gun. I am teaching them the difference between articles meant to get a reaction and real news
@thehill I follow the Hill to make me feel smart. Thank you for being there for me.
@mcuban @alexgibneyfilm Republicans who don't speak out against their party are spineless, Dems are enlightened and brave?
@thehill this is the dumbest thing I have ever read.
@PalmerReport @Trumpbits @DailyNewsBin how does this help us?  I had an issue with Repubs doing this crap and I have an issue now.
@NateSilver538 why is this a good thing?  Apparently we haven't learned from previous admin that road blocks divide, we are divided enough
@DebChantson @nunyabus1 an action should never tear families apart. As I said I don't agree with it at all
@DebChantson @nunyabus1 I can agree this was implemented terribly and should have been thought thru more than a week.
@DebChantson @nunyabus1 I don't agree with the action but when both sides are swinging so far off center it only feeds the beast.
@DebChantson @nunyabus1 that is why it is now being called a ban on Muslims instead of a stay on visas from specific countries.
@DebChantson @nunyabus1 no where in the EO does it mention banning based on religon but Trump did make statements for a ban based on it
@DebChantson @nunyabus1 I can find both sides with Google. That is part of the problem. There is no unbiased source to reference.
@DebChantson @nunyabus1 @ABC @Slate you can't come to the table with a source as biased as slate. That's like me countering with Breitbart
@nunyabus1 @DebChantson @ABC it is now but during the campaign he did mention a ban on Muslims and walked it back later.
@realbigboyshit1 @ABC you can't call Trump's entire base racist. Well, you can but you lose some credibility in my opinion.
@realbigboyshit1 @ABC I would say 30% safety 70% money for our elected officials in both parties. Just a guess. I really don't know.
@nunyabus1 @DebChantson @ABC while it is similar to the others none of them said they would ban a religion like Trump did in the campaign.
@realbigboyshit1 @ABC too much money involved with that one. Not just Trump but others as well.
@goatbob @ABC weren't there more terror attacks under Obama than previous presidents?
@omarosasdignity that is on my mind as well, like I said I have to believe otherwise to stay positive and not fall into the abyss.
@omarosasdignity like all that came before him
@omarosasdignity no he doesn't and the way he talks with his hands is odd, but I have to believe he is doing what he feels is best just
@omarosasdignity his speeches because I don't trust the media to not put a spin on his words either favorable or other.
@omarosasdignity I am with you on that point but I look at it differently.  Not so much worried, just a bit concerned. I listen to all
@omarosasdignity @RichardPrice5 @make_trouble that's just my opinion though and probably not worth much to you.
@omarosasdignity @RichardPrice5 @make_trouble the best thing Trump can do is unify the nation either with him or against him.
@omarosasdignity @RichardPrice5 @make_trouble believe it to be true. Just like both sides are doing now.
@omarosasdignity @RichardPrice5 @make_trouble was telling them. They also never bothered to read the opposite side because they didn't
@omarosasdignity @RichardPrice5 @make_trouble and were afraid of what he would do becaue they only believe what their chosen news source
@omarosasdignity @RichardPrice5 @make_trouble they felt that way for the same reason you feel this way now. They disagreed with his position
@omarosasdignity @RichardPrice5 @make_trouble it was rational to them just like it is rational for you now.
@omarosasdignity @RichardPrice5 @make_trouble you guys watch too much tv. You do realize the other side felt the same way in 2008, right?
@purplefi not bothered. Just curious.
@purplefi you can have an opinion but it doesn't mean much if it isn't impacting you at all.
@KillaryClintons I might have commented on the wrong string. Been drinking a bit.
@purplefi @KillaryClintons @Telegraph how does a stay on refugees coming to America affect you?
@georgezab @floridarocket this whole thing is a wreck but both sides are guilty of spreading bullshit.
@mspretty7159 @chrisbrown you want people to respect you but you condemn others for their voice. How does that make sense?
@mspretty7159 @deadpriest_d12 @lulabuma you gave an opinion on an open source but won't let others give theirs?  You are thick.
@saebinsabrinayi @seankent that person changes based on your beliefs.
Serious question. Why is it both sides, Dems and Repubs think they are better and smarter than the other?
@CBSNews he is willing to do what it takes to succeed including lie, cheat and steal just like any other liberal or conservative politician.
@fbaumler14 @seankent that's why no one was able to find anything!  This whole time they were looking for a Kenyan. What morons...
@seankent it was and somehow we still ended up with the 2 worst possible options.
@nytimes no, they're not
@AP @adgeller what else do you call people who oppose most things you do?
@Hope012015 @Trumpbits @nytimes were Hillary's people scum when they embraced some of Bernie's platform?
@surrealblues @MichaelfRizzo @POTUS @billmaher @NastyMindy acting like little kids and work together
@surrealblues @MichaelfRizzo @POTUS @billmaher @NastyMindy I didn't like when Obama did it. I don't like it now. Our officials need to stop
@USCGctm @Reuters no, it isn't but it is where he is gonna start. By the time he gets to the ones we care about he will be gone.
@USCGctm @Reuters what is wrong with removing people here illegally who have committed a crime?
@ABC never gonna happen.
@FoxNews @oreillyfactor @POTUS what about all the states ignoring federal drug laws by allowing either med or rec weed?
@davidgregory @WSJ you back out of the meeting so you can stick to what you have been saying all along.
@AP by cancelling he is accepting the wall. The only way to negotiate is to show up for the conversation.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I appreciate you and I can have a civil conversation while coming from different angles
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC not greet total strangers with F off or go away just because I don't see the world the same way.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC the most important thing we can change is how we treat each other even though we have different ideas
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC most of them do deserve to be there. Some, including this one do not
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC they all think they deserve to be there
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC 99% of people who run for president have a high level of narcissism.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC to listen to his words and not the interpretation of his words.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC as much as you hate him, you need to listen to what he says just like the people who hated Obama needed
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC here illegally.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC those already in jail or with a record of violent crimes. He will never be able to deport all
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC most of it is hyped up by media. Yes he is going to go after those here illegally but he is starting with
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC that is out of line. I am sorry you had to have that conversation with your kid, it couldn't have been easy
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC he does need to calm his retoric down a ton and lose Twitter.  He will eventually pay for anything he does
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC do not believe that
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I know you do the believe that.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC who the president is we do not change who we are.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I am trying to see the positive because I have 3 year old twins that need to know no matter
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I did not vote for him but at the same time I was not with her either.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC only because the fact is his presidency is legitimate. I do not support most of his ideas.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC does that surprise you?
@danahaswell @TexRangers1984 @_RScottWhitley_ @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC good one.
@Gypsygirls1012 @not_a_ten @ABC losing the popular is killing him but that still does not delegitimize his presidency.
@nate510 @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I agree
@Marnithia @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC we will see.
@Gypsygirls1012 @not_a_ten @ABC that is your right but it is not a fact. It could be an alternative fact though...
@Gypsygirls1012 @not_a_ten @ABC as defined by our system he is in fact our legitimate president.
@Gypsygirls1012 @not_a_ten @ABC fact: he is our president. Opinion: he is illegitimate. Alternative opinion: he is legitimate.
@Gypsygirls1012 @not_a_ten @ABC how is he illegitimate?
@RogueNASA how sad is it that the same thing happened under Obama but was not noticed because social media wasn't as prevalent.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC you too.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC again, I think he is a train wreck in motion but I am holding on to hope.
@bonzoniinc @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC if that is the case, Trump and all screaming illegitimate are both right. That would be awesome for all
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I agree with a lot of what you said. Only difference is I am hopeful.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I'm not trying to change your mind. I appreciate you have a different opinion.
@not_a_ten @Oolahmoon @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I would be saying the same thing I am saying now.  It is a waste of our $
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I also know he can't do anything on his own
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I see what is happening, I just see it thru different lenses
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC others know you are right. Only time will tell.
@not_a_ten @Oolahmoon @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I know. Heaven forbid he finds something and screws himself.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC there are a lot of people hoping you are wrong, Including me. Others are positive you are wrong.
@HerbzDunGoofed @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC unfortunately in our system the popular vote does not mean the same. By your definition he is.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC that makes no sense. Calling him illegitimate does nothing. Proving he is does everything.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC is it all doom and gloom to you? Remember when people were saying Obama was gonna make us Muslim?
@not_a_ten @Oolahmoon @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I am Mexican with family in Mexico. My dad is diabetic. You're assuming I voted for and like him
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC how many people have died or went to jail in the last 4 days because of him?
@genaro_inc @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I agree.  I dont think 3 million illegally voted against him.
@genaro_inc @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC point taken but just because you think he is illegitimate doesn't mean he is.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC now you are being overly dramatic. I'm just trying to understand a different point of view.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC how shallow am I?  He did not win the pop vote.
@Hug34leg @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC apples to oranges when comparing to Obama. Obama's was historic, Trump's was back to normal.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC that should have been worked out during the campaign. Now is too late.
@Oolahmoon @not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I agree on both points. Does not change the fact that an insane person is
@_RScottWhitley_ @VasgirdJohn @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC why when I can read great stuff like shoo and fuck off from someone as awesome as you?
@_RScottWhitley_ @VasgirdJohn @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC nice. I appreciate your humor and the fact you will get more likes for that one. Good job
@_RScottWhitley_ @VasgirdJohn @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC just because I want a witty comeback, what?
@YahooNews @biannagolodryga nothing, nothing will happen to them as long as they don't get arrested for another crime.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC Most of us are frustrated. Most of us are aware he is unstable at best.  That's not enough to change results
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC every state has better things for him to spend that money on. I prefer it spent on a better hair stylist.
@mashable @HillaryClinton remember when some people wanted to resist the last president they were called racist?  Ah yes...Good times.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC once again we agree. Waste of tax payer $.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC yes we do, 3 million people did not illegally vote against him. if they did it was done in the wrong states
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC if his assumptions are proven then yes, that would make him illegitimate. Until then he is legit.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I get it. I don't like it either but calling him illegitimate will not change the system.
@YahooNews I don't see a problem with researching the claim. I disagree with the claim but when nothing is found they will be silent. Maybe
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I agree. He does slip in a truth now and then, possibly by mistake. That still does not delegitimize him
@business yeah, but only to ignore our millenial kids.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC he does lie more than most though
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC all politicians lie. Name 1 politician who only told the truth.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC I understand and partially agree but that still does not make him illegitimate.
@not_a_ten @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC yes I do care that he is arguably insane. It scares me but that does not change the fact that he won.
@_RScottWhitley_ @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC sorry, I thought you might have something other than fuck off trumpbot to add. My mistake.
@_RScottWhitley_ @Gypsygirls1012 @ABC wow. First of all thank you for attacking me for asking a question. Second. What makes me a "trumpbot"
@guardian what will cancelling do?  Nothing. If you refuse to talk you automatically lose.
@Gypsygirls1012 @ABC how is he illegitimate?  Did he or did he not win the electoral vote?  Like it or not, with the current system he wins
@washingtonpost are you saying the murder rate is not high in Chicago?
@_Memoh @ABC7 please tell me how that is Trump's fault.
@thetruthranger @thehill I have a few lottery numbers but they are always wrong. Nice talking to you.
@thetruthranger @thehill I meant  I wish I knew what you know. But nice to meet someone in that biz. I used to be on the aftermarket side
@thetruthranger @thehill I wish I knew what you do. It would make life a lot easier. Should I buy a house or a new truck?
@thetruthranger @thehill I agree.
@thetruthranger @thehill what do you know?  Other people also think they know he won't. I know he has the potential to do either.
@thetruthranger @thehill why should I trust you?  Do you trust me?  Im not saying it won't happen I'm saying I hope it doesn't.
@thetruthranger @thehill sounds like you are hoping for failure.  Good luck with that.
@thehill is this a bad thing?
@thetruthranger @thehill freedom of speech isnt freedom from consequence.
@kR1ptic09 @CNN @Reuters the press briefings are to pump out their own version of the truth.
@scott_fraley @Cheyne_Dunford @VinLibertad @washingtonpost do you know this for a fact or are you making an assumption based on media?
@business why is this important?
@kshackelford1 @washingtonpost prove he is. Just saying he is doesn't prove anything other than you want him to be.
@LibDem48 @washingtonpost @POTUS have a nice day.
@LibDem48 @washingtonpost @POTUS doesn't matter if they were invited.  Your party your rules. Anyone inciting is your guest unless removed
@cincydolphin @washingtonpost wear whatever hat you want. That is your right as an American.
@realtruthkings @washingtonpost so you want to arrest people who say thing you don't want your kids to hear?
@AdrianNolan77 @washingtonpost president or not he is still sitting in the oval office.
@tulong_tusei @washingtonpost it is not one sided. Both sides are guilty of acting like bullies.
@VinLibertad @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump prove he is under Putin's thumb
@lupinehero @Bridget00685720 @washingtonpost today was a great example of peaceful protest. Yesterday was not. Big difference.
@cincydolphin @washingtonpost peaceful disrupters are fine but show me one time a person disrupting a Trump rally was peaceful?
@LibDem48 @washingtonpost @POTUS he invited the violence?  He paid people to take attention away from him?
@BLACINESE @washingtonpost how is he the rioter?
@MickeyAlaska @thenewtube1 @washingtonpost apparently not trained very well
@kshackelford1 @washingtonpost prove he is a traitor.
@DebbiePeter3 he paid people to pay attention to him not to take attention away from him in both of those examples. So no, not plausible.
@USATODAY why is this news?
@DebbiePeter3 @AuntieMargot and several blue states are trying to take away freedom of speech.  2 things that will never happen.
@DebbiePeter3 @AuntieMargot there is about as much chance they were paid by Trump as him being the best president ever.
@thehill did you expect him to keep it?
@DebbiePeter3 @AuntieMargot no one wants to outlaw protests. Protesting is how change happens. Violence deligitimizes protests
@DebbiePeter3 @AuntieMargot @washingtonpost Trump paid thugs to protest and take attention away from himself?   Yeah that makes sense
@scrivener50 @FoxNews all that and he still beat Hillary.
@AuntieMargot @washingtonpost I don't know many people who grieve by breaking stuff.
@mellow170 @NBCNews I am glad we agree on that. All we can do now is sit back and enjoy the ride thru the turbulence.
@mellow170 @NBCNews you took that stand before Trump was president so it is a valid point. Would you hold it against her if she won?
@mellow170 @NBCNews Hillary said the same thing when she told Anderson Cooper the enemy she is most proud of is the Republicans
