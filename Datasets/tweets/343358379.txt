RT @Perduesenate: "President Obama wants Michelle Nunn in the Senate to fight for him, I want go to go Washington to fight for you." #GASen
RT @Perduesenate: "Stand with me and I'll be YOUR Senator." #GASen #GApol

If there's anything Michelle Nunn has "declared her independence" from, it's Georgia common sense. #perduecountry
Fact: @Perduesenate was not a part of the Washington-created crisis that led to the govt shutdown. http://t.co/UZLieSyeE5 #GaSen
RT @Perduesenate: Nunn supports Obamacare, which is not fixable and to hurts Georgians. #GASen #GApol http://t.co/TM3eSwpCzL

RT @Perduesenate: Obamacare is killing 2.5 million jobs. #GAPol #GASen
Takeaway from the debate so far: Michelle Nunn supports President Obama's policies. @Perduesenate thinks America can do better
RT @Perduesenate: CBO says raising the minimum wage will kill 500,000 jobs. Let’s grow the economy for all Georgians. http://t.co/GgI0H4WrY…
