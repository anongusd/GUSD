Food for thought.
@YousefMunayyer @IlhanMN "Part of that is investigating the role and impact of interest groups. That goes for interest groups of all kinds of topics and we should be skeptical of interest groups around guns, like the NRA as well, and criticizing the role of money and politics on a wide range of issues.
@YousefMunayyer @IlhanMN "But I don‚Äôt think the correct answer is that we can‚Äôt talk about it. I think it is very important in this moment to have a robust conversation about U.S. relations with Israel.
@YousefMunayyer @IlhanMN Both of those things are true and it is important to find a way to talk about the latter without furthering the former, and that‚Äôs not easy to do. Twitter is probably not the best medium for nuanced conversation.
@YousefMunayyer @IlhanMN "At the same time it is also true that there are various impactful, perfectly legal pro-Israel interest groups, which are playing a role, impacting and shaping U.S. policy toward Israel, which has resulted oppression of Palestinians.
@YousefMunayyer @IlhanMN "That is very real, it's undeniable, it's pernicious and these kinds of tropes long predate the modern state of Israel.
@YousefMunayyer @IlhanMN ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important to recognize that there is a very real history of anti-Semitic tropes around the idea that there are a small number of rich powerful Jews that control the world through spending money and buying influence.
I had a conversation today with @YousefMunayyer about @IlhanMN. What he said was so thoughtful that I think it is worth posting here in its entirety. So here goes:

Senate just passed the bill to reopen the government by voice vote. Next stop: the House.
The plan includes none of the money for the wall that he had demanded and was essentially the same approach that Mr. Trump rejected at the end of December, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse. w/@peterbakernyt and @npfandos https://t.co/QWjATMq26b
SOTU is still up in the air, Pelosi says. "The State of the Union is not planned now," she said, adding that she had told the president that once the government was open they would work on a mutually agreeable time.

Watch for this theme -- that Trump is making up a fake crisis. Schumer says Trump used the Oval office address to "manufacture a crisis."
Pelosi/ Schumer are up now, tag-teaming it. Schumer: "We don't govern by temper tantrum." Part of their long-running effort to paint Trump as a bratty toddler.
Well, that's it. No declaration of an emergency. But it could still happen -- maybe after his trip to the border.
@BarbinMD You caught me! That was the only single quote without context. Check my TL.
"Some have suggested a barrier is immoral." By some, he means Nancy Pelosi. Interesting that he didn't name her.
Trump says the wall will be paid for "indirectly by the great new trade deal" he has cut with Mexico. Not exactly the same as having Mexico pay for it.
"At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall," Trump says. But I don't know of any Democrat asking for a steel barrier.
Trump: "This is a humanitarian crisis. A crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul."
Oval office addresses are extremely difficult to deliver -- especially for presidents like Trump who thrive on live audiences.

Pelosi, on whether she will be speaker: "I heard the president say I deserved to be the speaker. I don't think anybody deserves anything. It's not about what you have done, its about what you can do. . . . And I think I'm the best person to go forward."
Pelosi dispenses with the notion that "women's issues" consist only of matters like child care. She wants women members to also have a "security credential" -- to take a role in foreign affairs and national security issues. "That's one of the ways they will change the Congress."
Pelosi says the president she quoted most often on the campaign trail was . . . . Ronald Reagan.
Pelosi on the Democratic agenda: "We're not going for the lowest common denominator. We're going for the boldest common denominator."
Pelosi is reminding people that she worked "very productively" with George W. Bush when he was president and she was speaker.

Judge Kavanaugh choked up a little when talking about his family. He concluded by saying "I revere the Constitution." And, it's a wrap. Back at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. Here's our live briefing: 	https://t.co/zYvyFWfjEw
A humanizing moment. A lot of talk today about Kavanaugh's coaching his daughter's basketball team. He drew appreciative laughter when he gave a shoutout to each player by name.
Kavanaugh is using his opener to pushback against Dem assertions that he is partisan and favors big corporations over the little guy: "I am not a pro- plaintiff or pro-defendant judge I‚Äôm not a pro prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro- law judge. "
At last, the swearing in. https://t.co/OEzezE3FXl
Lisa Blatt, a self-described liberal feminist Clinton and Obama supporter, and SCOTUS lawyer, is introducing Kavanaugh, says she took heat from friends over it. ‚ÄùI was raised to call it like I see it and I don‚Äôt see the choice before you as difficult.‚Äù
Well, that didn't take long. https://t.co/rdr7QVx2Ok
Now it's time for Kavanaugh's allies to introduce him. First up, former Sec. State Condoleezza Rice: ‚ÄúBrett is wise.  He is an old soul who was made to help steady us in these complicated times.‚Äù 		Live updates: https://t.co/0F5rOYBj7L
Grassley is clearly exasperated, vows not to allow interruptions tomorrow. "Either you run the committee or it runs you," he said, "and you guys have been very successful at running the committee today." Follow @nytimes live updates: https://t.co/0F5rOYBj7L
Senators have wrapped up their opening statements. Sen. Grassley has just called a 15-minute break. After that Judge Kavanaugh will be introduced, and will give his own statement.
Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the Parkland shooting, tried to introduce himself to Judge Kavanaugh. Here's what happened: https://t.co/j4HVSlJ1D7
Now up: Kamala Harris, another 2020 Dem. aspirant, telling a made-for-TV story about barely missing attending segregated schools. "For me a Supreme Court seat is not  only about academic issues of legal precedent or judicial philosophy -- it is personal."
Cory Booker is giving a sweeping speech at Kavanaugh hearing, voice rising and falling, touching on civil rights, the founders and "the ideals of this nation." Can you say: Presidential candidate?
Democrats are laying the groundwork to portray Judge Kavanaugh as a political hack. ‚ÄúJudge Kavanaugh has been knee deep in partisan politics,‚Äù Senator Maize Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, said. Follow @nytimes live briefing: https://t.co/0F5rOYBj7L
Ralph Nader has asked to testify at the Kavanaugh hearings. He's not on the witness list. https://t.co/cnRtphdcpH
Sen. Ben Sasse, delivering a civics lesson and call for de-politicization of the Supreme Court, turns folksy. "We need Schoolhouse Rock back."
Sen. Durbin: "This is a president who's shown us consistently that he‚Äôs contemptuous of the rule of law. It's that president who's decided you are his man. . . So are people nervous about this? Are they concerned about it? Of course they are."
Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, to Judge Kavanaugh: "Congratulations and condolences. This process has to stink."
Kavanaugh hearings are back in session. Senator Amy Klobuchar,  D-Minn.: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt normal. It‚Äôs an abdication of the role of the Senate and a disservice to the American people.‚Äù Follow @nytimes live briefing: https://t.co/0F5rOYBj7L
Senator Grassley has just announced a 30-minute break. Tells Kavanaugh that Justice Gorsuch returned 10 minutes late, "so be on time."
Jon Kyl, Former Senator, Is Said to Be Choice to Replace McCain https://t.co/awshczJEoN
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, offering some statistics. 		Of 73 SCOTUS cases decided by a partisan 5-4 split w/ GOP appointees in majority, he says, GOP interests won "every damned time." 		Dubs the 5 GOP justices "The Roberts Five."	https://t.co/0F5rOYBj7L
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is making the GOP case that Kavanaugh is apolitical. Notes that despite working for Bush, he ruled against the Bush administration 8 times in 2 years. "For you it simply doesn‚Äôt matter who the parties are." https://t.co/0F5rOYBj7L

Dick Durbin is up now: "What we've heard is the noise of democracy. This is what happens in a free country when people can stand up and speak . . . . It is not mob rule."
Cornyn: " I sincerely hope this week we can all take a deep breath."	A few giggles in the room.	"We‚Äôre not doing very well so far.‚Äù
Winner, most unusual shout from a protester at Kavanaugh hearings: "I had to have a background check to work in a laundromat!"
OMG. Dumb southerner. That is not going to go over well with the base. https://t.co/o7p0a3R62l
Leahy also denounced the hearings as "a sham." https://t.co/oV9xYfVG71
Pat Leahy, has voted on 19 confirmations: ‚ÄúI have a sense of history. And I‚Äôve never seen in that 44 years so much at stake with a single seat. But I‚Äôve also never seen such a dangerous rush to fill it.‚Äù
@blankslate2017 @nytimes @GOP https://t.co/gfFHkE3V23
One thing you did not know about Brett Kavanaugh, courtesy of Orrin Hatch: He likes to eat pasta with ketchup. "Nobody's perfect," the senator said.
The Kavanaugh hearing is now officially underway. Senators are delivering their opening statements. Orrin Hatch is forecasting the soft tack GOP will take. "At only 39 years of age you knew more about the law than most lawyers who have practiced for a lifetime."
Senator Grassley is trying to deliver his opening statement, but is being drowned out by protesters. "Kavanaugh is a threat  to democracy!" One shouted. They are being arrested, one by one.
The Kavanaugh hearing has been underway for an hour now -- without getting started. The two parties seem to be at a stalemate, with Democrats continuing their demands to postpone.
Grassley is frustrated.	‚ÄúCan I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle:  How long do you want to go on with this?‚Äù		Kavanaugh hearing has now been underway for an hour. Documents fight ongoing.
A little levity -- &gt;&gt; https://t.co/sFRTHStoBa
Cornyn is accusing Democrats of engaging in "mob rule." A low murmur went up in the room.	Watch for this as a GOP sound bite/ theme.
Pat Leahy has been in the Senate for 19 SCOTUS noms. His is a strong Democratic voice. "What are we hiding?" he asks. 		Says that w/Kagan, committee had 99% of her White House records 12 days before the hearing.
Why Grassley keeps ruling Democrats out of order ---&gt;&gt; https://t.co/U7Jw9Jbcgj
Grassley: "I would like to have this be a peaceful session."		So far it has been anything but.
Sen. Grassley is trying to push ahead with the hearing, repeatedly ruling Sen. Richard Blumenthal's motion to delay as out of order. Both sides are sounding increasingly frustrated.
Kavanaugh hearings erupt in protest before they even begin. Women are being carried out by police. Democrats demanding a delay to the hearing. Follow our live briefing here: https://t.co/zYvyFWfjEw
