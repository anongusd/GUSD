@WinboltOlivia @andreas_wisst @ChronicPainDad @2RobinLyons @AmyL_Henry If you want, click on his name 2 message him &amp; ask; I think it was to tag us with his friends so we could chat if we wanted? I'm uncertain.
@WinboltOlivia @andreas_wisst @ChronicPainDad @2RobinLyons @AmyL_Henry You look beautiful in your profile pic! Also, thank you for the nice compliment. 😊Hope you're having a good day, darling!
@WinboltOlivia @andreas_wisst @ChronicPainDad @2RobinLyons @AmyL_Henry It connects u with other people who see this convo of ours, but ask @andreas_wisst how it shows up on FB-I don't explain that well, sorry!💕

@estarianne Also the possibility of more of his help..so it's a v difficult balance choosing when to interject w/hubby
@estarianne I completely understand and relate to being of no help, it's the worst feeling-but if I don't interject w/Troy's tasks, I lose my voice-⚖️
@estarianne May I ask how many you have? We love kids, we're 🙏🏻 &amp; hoping for one desperately after my #HipSurgicalRecover of 6 mo total. ❤️🤞🏻❤️🙏🏻
@estarianne That actually gives me the most confidence as it's like the running thought in my brain constantly looping; if we share that, I have + hope😘
@WinboltOlivia @andreas_wisst @ChronicPainDad @2RobinLyons @AmyL_Henry You're very kind Olivia! ☺️💕
@WinboltOlivia @andreas_wisst @ChronicPainDad @2RobinLyons @AmyL_Henry My same hopes and thoughts for my best are to be kind and thoughtful to every living thing, animal, earthly elements, &amp; person on the 🌎 💕

What darling #CatCuddles those two are doing! Aww!! Thank you for sharing! ☺️💕😻
@estarianne I'm so happy 2 hear you've had such a long track record &amp; ur hubby still #caregives I worry I burn Troy out, but he says keeps him young 😘💕
@estarianne Sounds like he really stepped up &amp; despite not liking it, not complaining is a crucial facet of the caregiver relationship-esp. w/marriage 2
@estarianne 22 years married?! Wow! Congrats, I need to be taking notes from you! Although I already do the same literally laundry, laundry list, lol.😂😘

@estarianne Please let me apologize &amp; reset! After just having surgery the #brainfog is awful, but I'm truly sorry I made an assumption as I did! Truly😔
@estarianne It might seem that way, but he sounds like a good hubby thus far! I'm so sorry 2 be a jerk &amp; assume, honey! How rude &amp; awful-so sorry!

@PamelaHope3 Oh no, love, I'm so sorry 2 hear u've had multiple abusive and/or harassment from ur romances-u truly don't deserve what u went through 😥💔😔😰
@PamelaHope3 Which I happen 2 adore, but should be a good omen 4 dating &amp; 1day if u want, replacing with married 1! Ur dreams r the only limits! ☺️❤️💕
@PamelaHope3 After living through this nightmare? A healthy relationship is going to be a breeze-you never should've been put down as you were, so sorry😥
@PamelaHope3 If u were treated or labeled a placeholder 2 someone else, u certainly are not &amp; never will be that! You're ur own smart, beautiful person❤️
@PamelaHope3 Oh sweetheart! 😥 I think especially if it was secret &amp; sexual, then I'd would consider break up because your feelings must've felt broken 💔😥
@PamelaHope3 I can't wait to be proven wrong and hear all about it! 🤗❤️🙌🏻💕 #HopelessRomantic
@PamelaHope3 I agree! &amp; good call reading up &amp; educating urself now-better knowing going in, and then working together 2 ⚖️caregiving &amp; relationship as 1
@PamelaHope3 Last crushes R always the hardest 2 get over; &amp; there's something about '1 who got away'-it's overhyped b/c there was already break-up pain😥
@PamelaHope3 No, I don't believe that, nor thnk u deserved any secrecy in romantic relationships-u deserved the same outward affection everyone does, ❤️!
@PamelaHope3 It's quite a workout; the #Caregiver routine, but worth exercising when always happening with ur partner everyday #Cargiving U deserve  it!💕
@PamelaHope3 Sounds 2 me like a dud- he may have a 'perfect life' on paper, but he's missing out on an amazing catch, my perspective. Sorry 4 his loss!
@PamelaHope3 Hubby doesn't have 2 say how much exercise he gets as #caregiver ;often lifting me 2 &amp; from places-what 'active' guy is against that? 🤷🏻‍♀️
@PamelaHope3 💔😥 That's horrible, I'm so sorry, Pamela! 💕
@PamelaHope3 I'm so sorry Pamela, ppl can leap 2 preconclusions &amp; judgements 2 quickly nowadays, let alone the viciously critical aspect of dating! Hugs💕
@PamelaHope3 already a topic usually reserved 4 later in the relationship than it should, but still it's unfair ppl don't ask u 1st b4 assuming anything

@Reactively @mikes_recovery @MillyZebra @EvadeTheVoices Never say never, eh? 😉 I'm getting someone's tissue that matches mine, so you never know, they could've had what I have, also!
@Reactively @MillyZebra @EvadeTheVoices My orthopedic surgeon is writing a paper-I'm his first patient to have both hips done 😊❤️
@Reactively @MillyZebra @EvadeTheVoices It's an experimental operation and the hospital told me they'd call with my check in time. Just their process &amp; policy at Evergreen Hospital
@Reactively @mikes_recovery @MillyZebra @EvadeTheVoices Unfortunately with genetically inheritable Tissue we aren't the most sought after donors, but our Tissue might save someone like us. ❤️
@mikes_recovery @MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Exactly, Mike, gifting of Tissue is one of the most incredible gifts one can give and/or receive in life. It's a second chance 4 ur body❤️
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Oh love, I wish I could send resources and doctors your way so badly! 😥💔
@Reactively @MillyZebra @EvadeTheVoices No, scheduled my time just now for 10:30 Friday morning! I'm so excited but still nervous, too! ❤️ TY 4 asking! 😊
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices It's life changing 2 have done-I'm excited to have the right done too so they're even! I can finally engage muscle I couldn't b4 after Left😊
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Wish I could send you to see my orthopedic specialist near me! 🙏🏻❤️
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Makes sense-actually that's why my hip reconstructive surgery Friday is special because cadaver tissue will build what I was born without
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Aw I'm so sorry Milly! I was lucky to have many labrum tears sewn and stabilized with pins in shoulders, hips, thumbs, and more 4 relief.
@Reactively @MillyZebra @EvadeTheVoices It depends per person, but 4 me, dislocations &amp; subluxations r extraordinarily 😣 painful! Stabilization surgery helps prevent them 4 me.🙏🏻
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Oh it can absolutely b a mixed bag, with kids &amp; questions-especially given the environment, too. Kids will see as parents do, &amp; follow lead
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Exactly! Kids ask the questions i wish grown adults could ask!
@Reactively @MillyZebra @EvadeTheVoices Exactly! That seems like the mature and adult response to have if any, rather than demonstrative or prejudiced questions! Ur spot on!
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Yaaasss! 🙌🏻❤️👏🏻😍
@MillyZebra @Reactively @EvadeTheVoices Such eloquently phrasing for 'Put Yourself In My Shoes-for even a second!' I love it, Milly! ☺️❤️🙌🏻
