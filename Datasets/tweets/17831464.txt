Yes they do, although not every year.  Albatross chicks have a pretty high mortality rate, but one of her banded chicks actually showed up near her nest last year. Which was pretty exciting. That chick had hatched in 2001. https://t.co/aNHZHdr9V4
@kaikane @Kat4Obama Wow! I’ve only seen them in their colonies. That must be incredible.

Wisdom the albatross is ... 	#Wisdom (4)
Midway Atoll is home to over 70% of the world's Laysan Albatross! Most albatross return to the place they were born to breed and raise their young. So it is likely that Wisdom and her long term mate Akeakamai are surrounded by family members. Welcome home #Wisdom (3) https://t.co/BJRN5iVCo9
Wisdom was first banded by biologist Chandler Robbins. In 2002, Robbins returned to Midway to find the birds he banded in those early years. He "discovered" Wisdom still there at the same nest site. Over 250,000 birds have been banded on Midway Atoll! #Wisdom (2)		📸USFWS https://t.co/AnKm5mR4SU
She's Baaaaaack! Wisdom - world's oldest known wild bird-  returned to Midway Atoll NWR on 11/29 and laid an egg! Wisdom was first identified and banded by biologists as an adult in 1956 – making her at LEAST 6⃣8⃣ years old! #Wisdom (1) 		https://t.co/Iv8GZr5os9 https://t.co/fC3sbHxmF7

Nicole gave birth to Simon on September 12. Much has changed since then. The fire that started on Sept. 2 was finally 100 percent contained on Nov. 30 after burning 48,831 acres. For Jared and Nicole, their life has found a new normal. https://t.co/gpdwokWqmU https://t.co/hLyrxCtTpA
“It was scary because I was due so soon; I was actually late already. It was crazy to just watch because the fire was moving so fast. Sometimes it felt like the refuge was already on fire because we could see the fire everywhere. Fire was imminent daily.”  https://t.co/gpdwokWqmU https://t.co/d172z92w2Q
Nine months pregnant, Nicole Strawderman watched the Eagle Creek fire engulf tree after tree, acre after acre. Nicole and her husband Jared, caretakers and residents of Pierce Refuge, tracked the blaze as it burned across the Columbia River in September.  https://t.co/gpdwokWqmU https://t.co/hjW5OnmyFa
