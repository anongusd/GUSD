@KrisAmber799 @letanimalsbe @JoshuaBomb @realUSDOE @GobAbiertoBOL @AOC I disagree, I'm a real American, she is not fighting for anything that I agree with.
@GobAbiertoBOL @AOC Bahahaha
@GobAbiertoBOL @AOC Well said, thank you!
@AOC What about the jobs you fought against?  That's ok, New York doesn't need them, they will just go to another state.
@AOC Maybe SHE should stop with her anti-Semitic rants so that people wouldn't associate her to Islamic Radicalism...  		#reapwhatyousow #MAGA
@tedcruz This is ridiculous.
@SenFeinstein I live in Colorado so I'm losing that deduction, too.  With that said, it's fair because states that don't pay state income tax don't get that deduction.  Suck it up California...
@EcoSenseNow @VAXiDAsh2 @MichaelBalicki @AOC Agreed.  And let's not forget about all of the people (millions) that would lose their jobs.  How would they live &amp; support their families?
@VAXiDAsh2 @MichaelBalicki @AOC Except for all of the jobs that would be lost...
@nuggets  You tell him, Coach Malone!  Can't believe these refs! #MileHighBasketball
@benshapiro Stupid
@EdKrassen @AOC Wow.  That's rich.... Bahahaha
@JoshuaDover Have him on your show... What an idiot.
@WillTheThrillB5 is getting the team fired up!  What a run, we're still in this!  Let's do this!  @nuggets
Crowd is yelling "these refs suck" #denvernuggets #MileHighBasketball
Not sure what the problem is but the @nuggets couldn't make a basket if they tried...  #MileHighBasketball
A little defense added with some offense would be really good about now.... Come on @nuggets we need this win. #MileHighBasketball
Come on Nuggets!  Let's finish this!  #MileHighBasketball
@Jim_Jordan @AJSmith00043 Ridiculous
Double technical foul on @thats_G_ - are you kidding me? #MileHighBasketball

@ArashParsi12 @AcresJack @ShanePrentice2 @SenatorBennet By the way, human sacrifice is already legal in Colorado, it's called late term abortion.
@ArashParsi12 @AcresJack @ShanePrentice2 @SenatorBennet Again, there are very few cases where this applies and thousands of abortions each year.  If you really wish there were no abortions are you willing to support a more limited law?
@AcresJack @ArashParsi12 @ShanePrentice2 @SenatorBennet Thank you, Jack.  This is exactly my point.  In Colorado, third trimester abortions are also legal.  I don't believe anyone can say that an infant that is viable outside of the womb is just a tissue massage.
@ArashParsi12 @ShanePrentice2 @SenatorBennet I can't pretend to know what you meant with this tweet, about the gun, I mean.  If someone made me chose between my daughter and myself and was holding a gun to my head of course I would choose my daughter lives.
@ArashParsi12 @ShanePrentice2 @SenatorBennet Thousands of babies are aborted everyday in America, most for convenience.  If the woman's life is at risk I'm sure most people would be ok with trading one life for another.
@kodom0336 @SenatorBennet Agreed.
@JEMaher2 @SenatorBennet Respectfully, I disagree.  I don't want my tax dollars to fund abortion.  With that said, it's the law of the land, per the Supreme Court, so if a woman wants an abortion she can have one.  If you look into it, most insurance policies actually pay for them.
@SenatorBennet I don't agree with my tax dollars being used to fund abortions.  #ConservativeColoradan #MAGA
@SpeakerPelosi just gave a speech in #Laredo 		Let me summarize:		@POTUS is bad. #Trump is wrong, he's not going to get his way, there will be no #borderwall 		I'm just doing my job, that's what she said...		Hey, #Democrats come on over to the Conservative side! We welcome you.

@AOC This one reflects how Americans feel... Maybe not all but many.  You're an idiot and have cost jobs for your state.
@benshapiro mentioned on his show yesterday that there may have been some #CampaignFinanceLaws broken by the @AOC campaign. Is orange a good color for her skintone?  @DineshDSouza went to PRISON, complements of @BarackObama - Anyone have info on this? @POTUS #MAGA
@w_terrence Wow, I'm so sorry.  Get well soon, I'll be praying for you.
@AOC I feel like you're going to jail soon for breaking campaign finance laws by funnelling payments to your boyfriend!  Possibly you should concern yourself with your own wealth.
@SenFeinstein #JessieSmallette - just an FYI
@AOC https://t.co/ncg2cmIM06
@TimothyKotsay @SenatorBennet Timothy!  I thought I was the only one in Colorado that felt that same way!  Pelosi says a wall is immoral and won't work and that the American people don't want one.  I believe at least half of America does!  #ColoradoConservative
@SenatorBennet Senator, respectfully, Coloradans are much smarter than that and realize the retoric being spewed from the left.  #ColoradanConservative #MAGA
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Shut up...
@POTUS can you use a #LineItemVeto on this stupid bill?  #MAGA
@SenFeinstein I wish you mentioned that they are paying less taxes each week so they are bringing home more money... So the loss of the deduction is given back each week in their paycheck.

@AOC We obviously were not watching the same #SOTU address last night... @POTUS knocked it out of the park! #MAGA

@SpeakerPelosi It tells us alot that Democrats cheat, continuously and want illegal aliens to be able to vote... Of course we need to get stricter...
@AOC Incorrect.  If you poll 1000 people who live in New York then 999 will say no to a border wall... Poll 1000 along the Texas, New Mexico and Arizona border and it would be the opposite.
@SenFeinstein Walls are just part of border security, just think, the walls forced them to take the route they did which helped border agents catch them.... Come on Senator, we are not stupid. #BorderSecurity #BorderWall
@JoshuaDover We don't "Fear the Beard"
@LindseyGrahamSC Great questions that many Americans would like the answers to!  Thank you! #MAGA

@SenatorBennet @Morning_Joe Then let us have our wall.  Half of America wants the wall, half doesn't, how about a compromise?  You represent ALL Coloradans, not just the liberals.  #BorderSecurity #Borderwall #ConservativeinColorado
@SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump Respectfully, Senator, I disagree.  We should consider every option to protect the U.S., including a wall.  Please, spend more time working on solutions and not spending it  criticizing the President. #ConservativeinColorado #BorderSecurity #Borderwall
@SpeakerPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @FSCDems Your brooms must be in the closet...
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Wouldn't it have just been cheaper if you and @SpeakerPelosi had just given us a  #BorderWall &amp; #Bordersecurity
@AOC Oh, we fact check everything...
@SpeakerPelosi if @POTUS gave all DACA kids citizenship, free medical, free college and a guaranteed government job in exchange for border security, including a wall you would turn it down because the only thing you care about is the President loosing!  #MAGA
I need a MAGA hat...
#Democrats - @SpeakerPelosi says there is no reason for Sen. Republicans not to sign the Bill opening the government without #BorderWall funding. I would say that there's NO reason for Dem's not to sign the Bill being presented by @senatemajldr - #Compromise
@POTUS - keep up the great work... No caving!  We need #Bordersecurity and a #Borderwall ... No giving into @SpeakerPelosi or @SenSchumer because they are not trustworthy! #MAGA
@LindseyGrahamSC Bahahaha
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Aren't you precious.
@SpeakerPelosi -no wonder you don't have time to meet with @POTUS &amp; worry about #Bordersecurity. You're too busy worrying about what to do with @AOC! Bahahaha! Yesterday she reported that people in Alabama have ringworm due to a lack of healthcare because the US has billionaires!
Hey! The #Demoncrats &amp; #Libtards are trying to get out support for @POTUS to decline...  If you realize what @SpeakerPelosi, @SenSchumer &amp; the #FakeNews are trying to do to Trump and your support IS NOT wavering the please comment &amp; retweet!  #Trump2020
@realDonaldTrump Disappointing that they are just doing this to keep YOU from being successful! This is not a popularity contest... Please don't open the Government until we have the money we need for #BorderSecurity - Dems are not trustworthy.		 #MAGA #Trump2020
@SenSanders - your comments about @POTUS yesterday are unforgivable.  Calling Trump a racist is like calling you a Communist... Are you?  #MAGA #Trump2020
Has anyone considered the real reason @SpeakerPelosi is against #BorderSecurity ... Is it because she &amp; her husband own wineries in California &amp; need cheap Illegal Aliens to pick their grapes... #ImpeachPelosi #PelosiSchumerShutdown
@POTUS - stay strong - we've got your back!  Keep the Government closed until @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer  come to their senses about #BorderSecurity &amp; give us the $$$ for the #BorderWall.  #MAGA #Trump2020
If you're a #Dreamer #DACA kid please contact @SpeakerPelosi &amp; let her know you want her to compromise and accept @POTUS offe r so you won't get deported!
@RealCandaceO @GTSFarmer Congratulations!  You're a super cute couple!
@SenCoryGardner - it is important that you vote in favor of @POTUS compromise for #BorderSecurity &amp; the #BorderWall tomorrow. Vote with the President, vote for security of America &amp; for jobs being filled by Americans! Conservative Coloradans will be watching your voting habits.
@KamalaHarris Bahahaha
@SenSchumer - @POTUS supporters don't want the Government opened before #BorderSecurity and the #BorderWall  is funded because we don't trust YOU OR @SpeakerPelosi ... Just thought I would clear that up for you since I heard the lies you were spewing in a recent interview.
If you're a #Dreamer please call @SpeakerPelosi and ask her to accept @POTUS 's deal... That will keep you from being deported!
@POTUS - if you open the Government without #Bordersecurity and a #BorderWall then you know that @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer will not give us what we need!  #Democrsts are not trustworthy... Hold tight, Mr. President! #MAGA
@SpeakerPelosi If you are one of the 800,000 DACA kids you should call @SpeakerPelosi and insist that she accept this deal with @POTUS... It seems to me that she is throwing away your future by being stubborn...
@CNN reported today that @JohnKerry is meeting with leaders all over the world and they discuss @POTUS direction and policies... Is this even legal?  Sounds like #collusion to me!  #LockKerryUp #MAGA #Trump2020
@thehill @AOC do you hear yourself?  Blaming @POTUS for #Antisemitism? To date, that may be the most ignorant statement you have made. You do realize that Trump has a Jewish Daughter, Son-in-law &amp; Grandchildren, don't you?  Maybe you just don't know what the word "antisemitism" means...
@CNN @CNNPolitics it's not surprising that you are reporting that @POTUS had a bad week, his address to the country was not new &amp; Democrats are right to not negotiate...
@SpeakerPelosi owns the Government shutdown now!  She didn't accept @POTUS compromise...   Half of America wants a wall &amp; border security... #MAGA #PelosiShutdown #BuildTheWall #BorderSecurity  #ImpeachPelosi
@SpeakerPelosi are you watching my President??? This is what tons of Americans want... Do your job!  We don't care that YOU don't want the wall - we do!  #MAGA #FundTheWall #BuildTheWall #BorderSecurity
@POTUS - please don't open the Government until we get #BorderSecurity &amp; a #BorderWall   @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer ARE NOT TRUSTWORTHY...  #MAGA #Trump2020
#ImpeachPelosi Speaker get to work &amp; fund #BorderSecurityNow
@SpeakerPelosi - Liar, liar pants suit on fire... Get to work, fund border security and then open the Government.
@SenCoryGardner I believe someone has told you that if you vote w/Dems that they will re-elect you in '20. That's not going to happen. You need Conservative Coloradans to vote for you so get on the #TrumpTrain or start looking for a new job. #MAGA #BuildTheWall #Bordersecurity
Does anyone know why @SpeakerPelosi lies so much?  She must think all of her supporters are stupid... If they believe her then maybe they are... #MAGA #BorderSecurityNow #BuildTheWall
@LindseyGrahamSC I'm so grateful that you're leading the committee because I know you will be fair and honest.  #MAGA
@SenFeinstein And Democrats are running off to Puerto Rico, @SpeakerPelosi is nowhere to be found... This is NOT a Republican issue....  #BuildTheWall #BorderSecurity  #MAGA #Trump2020
@SpeakerPelosi should be in Washington D.C. everyday until the Government is open... #MAGA #BorderSecurity #BorderWall
Stay strong, @POTUS - if you open the Government without #BorderSecurity &amp; the #BorderWall then WE LOSE.  #Democrats are NOT trustworthy, once the Government opens they will  move toward more investigations of you.  #MAGA #impeachPelosi
Looks like the Refs have already decided this game... And it's still the 3rd quarter... @nuggets

Democrats - @POTUS &amp; the American people are not STUPID.  We know that once the Government is open we won't get border security, including a wall.  Talk about #Deplorable
@AOC Sweetie, don't believe everything you read in the newspaper.  Additionally, the House didn't vote these men into office, the citizens of their communities did...
@POTUS is winning on Border Security &amp; Democrats are loosing, time to start talking about Russian collusion again... #MAGA #BorderSecurity #BorderSecurity

You're doing the right thing,  @POTUS keep the Government shut down until @SpeakerPelosi gets out if her own way.  The security of the country is your job, paying for it is hers!  #BuildTheWallNow #BorderSecurity #MAGA  #ImpeachPelosi
@JoshuaDover why do the Ref's that call #MileHighBasketball games ALWAYS suck????
@AOC What amazes us is that you didn't think about the fact that you would need a place to live if elected to the #HouseofRepresentatives ask your socialist buddy @SenSanders how he has several homes... Or @SpeakerPelosi
@SenGillibrand Actually, the American People want border security, it's @SpeakerPelosi  &amp; @SenSchumer that are holding us hostage.  #BorderSecurity #BuildTheWall #impeachpelosi
@JoshuaDover The point should be Patriots Suck!		Being a true blue Bronco fan I hate KC &amp; my second favorite team is whomever is playing the Pats!		So, I'm conflicted 'cause I want KC &amp; the Pats both to lose next week.		So now I have to chose which one I want to lose more, suggestions?
@AOC Are you getting paid?
@SenFeinstein Agreed, let's get the wall built and then go after the Visa Overstayers!  They need to go! #MAGA #BuildtheWall #BorderSecurity #ConservativeinColorado
@realDonaldTrump Agreed!  Wow! Amazing win by an excellent leader!
@POTUS - keep fighting the good fight!  We need Border Security, including a wall or fence!  If you give in now we will NEVER win again. You're doing a great job - keep  it up! #MAGA #bordersecurity #BuildThatWall #ConservativeinColorado #nottiredofwinning
#impeachpelosi
@SpeakerPelosi - #BorderSecurity &amp; #BorderWall are a no brainier... Even @cher knows YOU are going to LOSE on this issue... Stop playing #BirdBox with the American people and give us our security &amp; wall.  You've met your match with @POTUS
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I think it @POTUS that they don't support, which is sad.  I love the President &amp; America. It's unfortunate that @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer don't even love America. #MAGA #BorderSecurity #BuildTheWall  #ConservativeinColorado
@SenCoryGardner don't give into Democrats or we have no hope of ever getting border security!  Why are so many Californians are moving to Colorado because they can't afford to live there?  Don't be fooled that they will vote you in in 2020!  #MAGA
America-we need 10 years of Nancy Pelosi, her husband &amp; her children's tax returns... She is third in line for the highest office in the land...We need to make sure her stand against border security isn't an effort to help her winery and other family businesses.  #Pelosi #potus
@Acosta @CNN @CNNPolitics @KellyannePolls @SarahHuckabee - wow... I never thought that I would EVER agree with anything #AssholeJim had to report but miracles do occur!  Thank you, Jim, for making @POTUS 's point... Barriers work! #MAGA #BuildTheWall #BorderSecurity
I hope everyone realizes that @SpeakerPelosi is refusing to compromise for #BorderSecurity to force @POTUS  to use his powers for a National Emergency to build the wall because she already has a left wing libtard federal judge waiting to block his declaration.#MAGA #BuildTheWall
@SpeakerPelosi Are you saying that the #PelosiSchumer #OpenBorders are?
@AOC are you still wearing makeup that is tested on animals?  You always look very pretty but wearing makeup that is tested on animals is offensive (to me, at least) #peta #Liberals #CrueltyFree
@CNN @CNNPolitics @PoppyHarlowCNN - just wondering where your outrage was when @POTUS44 was knowingly lying to the American people???  What about President Clinton and his lies?  #obamalied #clintonlied #MAGA #
If Democrats, really care about the Government employees affected by the shutdown and spend billions of dollars for wasteful things all of the time then why not give @POTUS the money he's asking for to secure the border?  Help all of the American people...
@storylake That's where you're wrong!  Millions love @KellyannePolls &amp; I'm so glad she put @Acosta in his place (he is an asshole).  #MAGA
@SenCoryGardner Show your appreciation for them by supporting @POTUS and border security, including the addition of more Border Patrol Agents.  #MAGA #ColoradoConservative
Agreed https://t.co/qfhQimlqyv
@SenatorHassan Respectfully, it's time for @SpeakerPelosi to compromise for the good of the American people &amp; put #BorderSecurity ahead of her own ambitions &amp; the #Democrats - the Government should stay closed UNTIL the welfare of all Americans is put ahead of those employed by the fed. gov.
@SenatorHassan Respectfully, it's time for @
@Acosta - I don't like you either!  Bahahaha! #MAGA 		@KellyannePolls - thank you for putting that jackass #JimAcosta in his place!  You, we love!  Keep telling 'em like it is!
@SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer if you are so worried about the Government being closed &amp; people not getting paid then compromise and give the American people border security and situation solved.  #MAGA #BuildTheWall  #BorderSecurity
@RepPerlmutter remember that you represent all of the people in your district. We need border security, including a wall. It doesn't matter that the government is shut down, we need border security! Step outside of Democrat vs. Republican &amp; do the right thing for Americans.
@POTUS you know if the Government opens before we get border security then we'll get nothing!  Don't let the #Demoncrats trick you. Remember, @SpeakerPelosi told everyone that you had to vote for Obamacare before you could read it... #MAGA
@SenCoryGardner - great address to the American People by @POTUS tonight!  We can't give into the Dem's!  Stay strong Senator Gardner and Coloradans will stand behind you in 2020!

@SenCoryGardner don't give into politics-There are plenty of Conservatives that will vote you back into office in '20. @POTUS needs money for border security &amp; the wall!  If we give into the Libtards now we will be giving in for the next 2 years &amp; that won't get you re-elected.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Agreed
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP That's because there is no money for a border wall.... #MAGA #BuildThatWall

@ScrewedHumans @AJSmith00043 I bet all first ladies cry, probably the President, too. Because they are no longer in power, they have to move, their lives are forever changing. It's easy for her to say that and spin it to sound like she was crying because of President Trump. The Obama's are both so divisive.

@RealCandaceO just wondering if your makeup is #CrueltyFree because the $20 lipstick @Ocasio2018 has stated she wears was tested on animals as late as May 2018.  I have to assume Socialists and Liberals just don't care about animals, do you? #MAGA
Liberals don't seem to care about animals or maybe it's just Socialists that don't care.The $20 a tube lipstick that @Ocasio2018 wears that, until May 2018 was tested on animals &amp; made in China shows a blatant disregard for animals. @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson
@TomiLahren what brand of makeup do you wear?  Just wondering how you feel about #CrueltyFreeMakeup ....  The lipstick @Ocasio2018 reported wearing was made in China and tested on animals until May 2018...I'm guessing Liberals &amp; Socialists don't care about animals. #PETA #MAGA
@NancyPelosi do you support cruelty free makeup?  @Ocasio2018 wears lipstick that's tested on animals... What is your stance on this?  Liberals do care about animals, don't they? #PETA #CrueltyFreeMakeup
@SenSanders how can you complain about the profits Walmart makes when your socialist buddy @Ocasio2018 wears lipstick that costs $20 a tube that is NOT cruelty free and is made in China. Where do you draw the line? You both seem to be living pretty well. #PETA #CrueltyFree
The lipstick @Ocasio2018 wears was NOT cruelty free until the end of May 2018... She has some nerve preaching to us about Global Warming when she has been wearing makeup made in China that is tested on animals.  #PETA #MAGA

@jpodhoretz She wears lipstick that costs $22 a tube... Therefore, she is not poor, you buy this from Sephora, Ulta, etc., not from Walmart.  Possibly, like many millennials she should learn to manage her money - especially since that is one of the jobs of Congressmen in the House. #MAGA

Acosta should've lost his credentials sooner. He doesn't ask questions of the WH, he lectures them on his liberal leaning views. The disrespect shown for this office should have gotten him kicked out sooner. In the words of @POTUS , he'll run the USA, Jim can run @CNN. #MAGA

@SenBennetCO Respectfully, Senator, when Democrats ran the country the deficit grew larger &amp; larger.  Cutting taxes to give Americans relief (&amp; the opportunity to spend their own  money how they see fit) will have a positive effect on the economy.  #Redwave2018 #Maga

@SenGillibrand Senator, you've seen the FBI report, why don't you tell us about the witness tampering on the part of Dr. Ford's team?  Why don't you tell us that, in this case a mistake was made so that survivors everywhere will be able to come forward knowing they won't go through this circus.
@_Annas_Dad_ @SenBennetCO Not hardly... Conservatives are rising up... @SenBennetCO has seen the FBI report - it would be nice if he would come forward and say @BrettKavanaugh is innocent of the charges but he is voting no because of political issues.
@Meg_WritesStuff @SenBennetCO People who are accused without coborated evidence shouldn't be found guilty. There is evidence of witness tampering on the side of the accuser. I believe this has been a slap in the face for survivors because the allegations, in this case are untrue. All just to punish @POTUS .

@SGroucho @Hollaworldwide @D2onTop @ThisFineShrub @SenateGOP @FBI Love your comment!  Couldn't have said it better myself.
@D2onTop @ThisFineShrub @Hollaworldwide @SenateGOP @FBI Sunday, I live in Colorado and that's what was reported by her attorney.
@Hollaworldwide @SenateGOP @FBI Incorrect.  Ramirez was interviewed, I live in Colorado and it was reported by her attorney that she was interviewed on Sun. Ford doesn't need to be interviewed because she testified under oath on Thurs. The other 1 was not found to be credible so the FBI didn't interview her.
@Saintsswimmom @mortgageinstein @ThisFineShrub @MamaTransitions @SenateGOP That's so funny. Conservatives may have Supreme Court Justices that were accused of a sex crime, accused but not coborated, Dems have plenty of sexual  preditors, as Presidents, including 1 that was impeached for lying about it. Give me a huge break!.  #MAGA
@ThisFineShrub @MamaTransitions @SenateGOP There was not a need to investigate Dr. Ford because she testified under oath on Thursday... No need to investigate @BrettKavanaugh for the same reason.  What else would the FBI ask them that their answers would change?  I'm asking you honestly so I would appreciate your answer.
@MamaTransitions @SenateGOP The people that Dr Ford said we're there were interviewed plus 9 additional people... What else do you want?  What would make you, Mary, happy?  Or would you be against @BrettKavanaugh no matter what?

A contradiction, I know.  This is settled case law (although, settled incorrectly because, like marijuana, it's a state issue, not federal).  I believe this is what everyone
@JetBlueLub @DarwinFarr @doris23x @AlisasellsCO @BlueJayResist @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Of the yearbook vocabulary so in my heart I can't say that he lied.  People's drinking can be measured by how much is too much, he admitted to drinking and occasionally drinking too much.  The text message conversation was deemed incorrect or having been taken out of context.
@JetBlueLub @DarwinFarr @doris23x @AlisasellsCO @BlueJayResist @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump I don't drink anyone's Kool aid.  I have listened to both sides, I am very socially liberal and fiscally Conservative, probably more of a Libertarian (although I am not pro-choice)... I've looked at the facts, I don't believe there is a dictionary
I've been the victim of lies &amp; the news exploiting a situation by not reporting the facts or not reporting both sides. This is probably the reason I am waiting to get the facts I don't believe anything the news reports, I even received death threats because of the news reports.

@pccrasher @vetter_helen @Ocasio2018 This is not a job interview, it's a witch hunt.  If @BrettKavanaugh would just go on record that he's ok with baby killing as settled case law then Dems wouldn't be so insistent on ruining his life.  Republicans control the Senate, they gave it a good shot but he'll be confirmed.
@youlondat @JaShew82 @Ocasio2018 You are also correct about Kavanaugh being accused of a sex crime.  Fortunately, in America, you are afforded the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.  Just because she said he did this does not make it so.  We will just have to wait and see what the FBI comes up with.
@youlondat @JaShew82 @Ocasio2018 Ran out of characters:		Because the Dems refused to hold a vote on any Bush SC nominee, no matter how qualified, Schumer even changed Senate rules to accomplish this.  		Basically, Republicans did the same thing to Obama that Democrats did to Bush.  		Right, Wrong or Indifferent.
@youlondat @JaShew82 @Ocasio2018 I'm a Conservative &amp; you are right, Garland was qualified for the SC.  Liberals (specifically Chuck Schumer) set the precedent to block Bush's nominations due to the upcoming election in '07, it was made clear - NO SC nom. would be voted on until after the next Pres. took office.

@SenBlumenthal Actually, she said she had never met @BrettKavanaugh so how could she have been at this "supposed party"?
@SenBlumenthal You're serious?  Democrats are way off base here and the American people can see it.  #MAGA #Holdthevote
@KristySwansonXO Yes, I saw her... She's big in the #MeToo movement... Can't wait for Judge Kavanaugh to get confirmed...
@BrettKavanaugh @cspan Great job today!
@SenFeinstein Yes, absolutely!  He is the BEST we can do.  Having a Justice that understands &amp; will uphold the Constitution is what the American people need!  #voteyes4kavanaugh #HoldTheVote #MAGA
@IngrahamAngle I found her to be flaky &amp; not credible.  It was odd what she was 100% sure of &amp; what she wasn't.  She couldn't even remember if she had a polygraph on the day of her grandmother's funeral.	I do think something tragic happened to her &amp; that's sad but it wasn't by Brett Kavanaugh.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews @ChickfilA Loved your pationate plea today and can't wait to see you in Hannity tonight!  #HoldTheVote
@SenCoryGardner - vote Yes for @BrettKavanaugh - with no corroboration to the allegations by Dr. Ford against Judge Kavanaugh &amp; 4 witness statements stating it didn't happen he must be given the benefit of the doubt &amp; found to be innocent. #HoldTheVote #ConfirmKavanaugh #MAGA
@SenatorCollins - what is happening to our country?  I hope you'll put @SenFeinstein &amp; crew in their place by not giving in to their attempts to block a Constitutional Conservative from the Supreme Court.  Vote YES for @BrettKavanaugh #HoldTheVote
@natalia13reagan I felt that she was treated with respect and kindness, I felt proud of the Senate for that.		With that said, I believe something happened to her but I do not believe it was by Brett Kavanaugh.  		I hope she can get help.
@christinamoses Wow.
@maggiecassella Excuse Me - she asked to be heard.  He wanted to tell his side... Why should he give up his right to be on the Supreme Court because someone brought allegations against him.  Real men stand up for their reputation and name.  Judge Kavanaugh will be a great Justice!  #MAGA
Unbelievable. https://t.co/x6yKEFIjsL
@whatevsaid You've got to be kidding me!  Ridiculous.
@howardfineman @GOP Seriously?  I know you don't really believe this... It does make good news though.  I actually felt they were being sensitive to her by having a nonpartisan question her (and Brett).
@AshleyJudd I believe something happened to her but I don't believe it was #BrettKavanuagh.  I hope she can get help, especially after @SenFeinstein	threw her and her friends under the bus today when she accused CBF or her friends of leaking her letter.
@crystalmother @blindlady @_juliannemoore I believe that she was heard... Wasn't that what today was all about???
@glennbeck Agreed
@DanielTurnerPTF @RyanAFournier Agreed.
@IngrahamAngle I'm so proud of him, I was at work, listening on the radio and crying!  #MAGA #HoldTheVote
@BrettKavanaugh I'm so proud of you!  I'm sorry for what you and your family have gone through in this process and I'm praying for you all.  You're going to be an amazing Justice!  #MAGA #HoldTheVote #WalkAwayDemocrats2018
@SenFeinstein - wow, how quickly you threw #ChristinaBlaseyFord under the bus today.  I hope she takes you to court for leaking her letter...  #MAGA #JudgeKavanaugh4SupremeCourt #WalkAwayDemocrats2018
@LangstonBowens -OMG - loving the program today and so glad you're covering the Senate Hearings!  Did @SenFeinstein commit a crime?  Wouldn't it be great if #ford Sues her for leaking her letter?  #maga #HoldTheVote #WalkAway
@LindseyGrahamSC - Wow!  So proud of you!  Thank you for standing your ground for @BrettKavanaugh !  		#MAGA #BrettKavanaugh
You tell 'em, Brett!  #kavanaugh4supremecourt
@SenCoryGardner hope you aren't letting the #Libtards &amp; #Demoncrats "Sal Alinsky" tactics influence your stance on #JudgeKavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court. We need another Constitutional Conservative on the Court. Do the RIGHT thing- Vote Yes 4 Brett! #BackBrett #MAGA
@DenverChannel In the end, I believe @POTUS will be found to be correct! #backingBrett #MAGA #turnColoradoRed
@TomiLahren So true!
Question for EVERY man who has wanted to have sex since puberty...Are you worried? If Judge Kavanaugh is not appointed to the Supreme Court due to 30+ year old allegations of sexual advances, rape, etc then none of you are safe...Ridiculous. #kavanaugh4supremecourt #MAGA #libtard
Great job today, @POTUS
@AsheSchow Me!  I definitely believe that!
@realDonaldTrump #Libtards are out of control!  #JudgeKavanaugh for Supreme Court Justice!  #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump I'm there!
@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Standing behind you, President Trump &amp; Judge Kavanaugh!  Please don't give into these #Libtards
@realDonaldTrump - please - don't give into the swamp!  American's believe in @BrettKavanaugh - this behavior by Democrats cannot be allowed... #Draintheswamp
@BrettKavanaugh - please, don't give into these left-wing kooks!  America believes in you... We need to drain the swamp.  #MAGA
What is happening to America?  What happened to the rule of law?  What happened to being innocent until proven guilty?  #JudgeKavanaugh should be afforded the same rights of ALL Americans.  #MAGA #Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court!
@AnnCoulter Judge Kavanaugh has been through MANY security checks, interviews, etc.  Why hasn't any of this come up before, say, when he was part of the Bush administration or even his current position on the bench?  This is ridiculous AND Americans know it! #MAGA
@RobinVieira1 @AnnCoulter Agreed
@AnnCoulter Ugh... #Ramirez is from my beautiful state of Colorado...
@AnnCoulter We need to drain the swamp... On both sides.
RT @KimStrassel: The left made a mistake with this Ramirez story. It isn't just how embarrassingly flimsy it is; she was inebriated; took s…
Well, just like #rushlimbaugh predicted.... #Democrats were stalling on #ChristineBlaseyFord testimony so that "more" women could come forward with additional complaints.  Unbelievable...
Agreed https://t.co/ISpPsUwLrw
