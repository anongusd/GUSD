@NiskanenCenter Well said - thanks for a great event!
Times are tough.  Reform is tough.  Americans are tougher.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. 6/6
Most importantly, equality and the rule of law require us to play by the same rules and to respect the results.  We all lose when either side tries to cheat to win or rig the rules. 5/
My primary bias is that we have to orient any future political movement around core American principles.  The seemingly simple things of communication, compromise, character, and decency.  Truth, equality, and justice. 4/
I don‚Äôt know that I heard anything particularly new, but what‚Äôs important is I was hearing it all in one place and at the same time.  We won‚Äôt have a clear picture of where to move politically until we have these conversations, together. 3/
Surprise surprise, no one panelist had the answer.  Lots of overlap amongst speakers but not one clear direction.  But that‚Äôs what this event was all about - unifying the various threads of thought around how to proceed from the center-right. 2/
#StartingOver just got out, and proved an interesting examination of the center-right.  Excellent panelists and thought leaders to dissect where we‚Äôve been, where we are, and where to go from here. 1/
@oren_cass our first commitment has to be to an economy that supports workers of all types.  Can‚Äôt just have a top down approach that decides simply ‚Äúglobalization is good‚Äù and then decide what works
@asymmetricinfo 2018 midterms were not just about Medicaid.  Most voters were getting out based on Trump not just economics.  Can‚Äôt completely rule out cultural issues.
@oren_cass 40 years of free market religion has failed to provide the promise of a rising tide.  So what is our message to those who have been left behind despite our economic success?
@davidfrum we‚Äôre potentially in a moment of flux in the Trump years.  Playing musical chairs with our political movements.  Frequent flair ups in American history for greater moral character.
@asymmetricinfo in many ways economic system, by intent and accident, has been far more biased towards the college educated.  Makes American Dream more out of reach than prior generations.
@davidfrum can only solve today‚Äôs problems if we actually identify what the problems actually are.  Because conservatives solved problems with big government in 1970‚Äôs, keep trying to solve those problems over again, not solving new problems.
@asymmetricinfo with the left supporting more spending and right supporting more tax cuts, hard to see any overlap on either side towards governing.

A lot of tough questions/comments by the audience on whether the GOP can be reclaimed from populism after Trump, or whether it is inexorably tied to him moving forward.  The crystal ball here is clear as mud.		#StartingOver
@JuleannaGlover as preposterous now to be thinking about a third party today as it was to be thinking Trump could be President in 2015.		 ‚ÄúI think we should break the two party system.‚Äù
@RuleandRuin with a great line on third parties in history: they‚Äôre like bees, they sting and then they die.  Usually address specific issues but don‚Äôt survive.
@JuleannaGlover mostly given up on the GOP.  Concerned about what the GOP will be once Trump leaves office.  More interested in third-party/unity tickets.
@murphymike election night 2018 looked like a win for Trump with Abrams, Gillum, and ‚ÄúBeto/Jesus‚Äù all losing.  Masked the major win for Dems - largest gains since Watergate.		#StartingOver

@WhitAyres results of 2018 election reinforced the same political movements at play in 2016.  GOP traded suburban, high growth counties for more rural, slow growth counties.  Creates a numbers problem for the future GOP.

Looking to Europe, political movements have increasingly trended towards open vs closed.  Problem with this thinking is that sometimes ‚Äúclosed‚Äù will win.

How has the technocratic state bored voters into democratic complacency?  Because government is frequently boring, should we be surprised when candidates excite voters by dramatic appeals?
‚ÄúThis is a very long list‚Äù - yes it is!  A lot of moving parts in describing Western decline.
Another note - seeing a general breakdown of many of the leading political parties across the Western world.  Seeing new alliances forming around different concerns.
Also need to look at how political communications have caused revolutionary change.  From printing press, to radio, to TV, now to Internet/social media.
A few things western democracies share:		- don‚Äôt understand price we‚Äôre paying for American failures.  Iraq War seen as an inflection point.	- Ukraine crisis makes US and West look like a bystander.	- recession ended assumption that Western democracies had all economic answers

@mindyfinn says that a Coalition for Political Renewal (hope I said that right) requires speaking to Millennials and to Generation Z.  Increasingly these generations are voting and finding their voice - need to impress upon them importance of democratic and republican principles.
@jon_rauch focuses on George H. W. Bush‚Äôs ‚Äú1,000 Points of Light‚Äù as a succinct consideration of what a center-right domestic policy can be.  The power of communities to address great national challenges.
@Pete4CA previous panel concluded that 9/11 caused us to focus on foreign instead of domestic policy in conservative circles.  Helped caused stagnation in conservative thought about what conservative domestic policy can look like beyond simply tax cuts and regulatory reform.
@mindyfinn on both sides there is a huge economic incentive.  Major money for those at the extremes.  Currently we‚Äôre in a crisis zone, but that also opens up opportunity.  Can be used to piece together a new, center-right infrastructure.
@jon_rauch saying we aren‚Äôt going to convert people to centrist.  Always had fierce partisanship (see: Jefferson/Adams campaign).  Now competing with ‚Äúpolarization for profit,‚Äù but finding success when bringing people together on common conversation.
@lindsey_brink notes that when @NiskanenCenter hosts discussions, often participants agree on American fundamentals, but ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait‚Äù to disagree on everything else again.
@mindyfinn notes most of their constituency agree on common concerns of rule of law, truth, and justice.  Most wrestle with how to move forward - within two-parties or as independents?  Acknowledges seems more likely must exist within ‚Äúduopoly‚Äù but has lessons for both parties.
@jon_rauch motto of @BetterAngelsUSA is to ‚Äúcome as you are, leave as you are.‚Äù  Lowers the expectations that we will change one another‚Äôs minds - focus instead upon the process and the conversation.
@Pete4CA now talking about the @AmericanProj at Pepperdine School of Public Policy.  Working to bring together various conservative voices of academics and activists to chart a path forward for the movement.
@jon_rauch the mission of @BetterAngelsUSA is scalable because of the genuine interest of grassroots.  Individuals gaining agency and control against commercialized politics.  Look at country from top-down, things look pretty bad.  From the bottom-up, things look a lot better.
@jon_rauch here representing @BetterAngelsUSA - a cause in which he initially expressed skepticism.  By having structured conversations, people are genuinely able to build cross-partisan relationships.  Gives hope for future depolarization.
@mindyfinn when we have conversations about common American principles, people tend to feel our wide policy differences are not so intractable.

@catlawson Thanks!  Trying to balance listening and sharing some of the more notable insights.
@Peter_Wehner drawn to conservatism because of commitment to objective truth in contrast to relativism.  Distressed that Trump is so popular with GOP based on his aggressively anti-Truth rhetoric.
@Peter_Wehner puts the point more finely.  Previously may not have listened to intellectuals - now have segments which are explicitly anti-intellectual.  Politics becoming more performative than focused on hard work of governing.
@BillKristol talks about how often he has supported primary candidates who haven‚Äôt won the primaries.  Not like the base has alway listened to elites in the first place.  But still finds that there is robust debates occurring in conservative circles.
@JRubinBlogger intellectuals don‚Äôt do very well in an anti-intellectual political moment.  Goal now is to appeal to a broader audience.
@jerry_jtaylor cutting deep - this panel doesn‚Äôt have much influence in GOP today.  Intellectuals/elites have lost influence - why did it happen and how can it change?
@jerry_jtaylor makes the relation of Southern ‚ÄúDixiecrat‚Äù Democrats moving to GOP; Dixiecrats fueled George Wallace and now those same type of voters fueled neo-Wallace of Trump.
@Peter_Wehner much of Trump appeal came from his role as a fighter.  Party base wanted someone who would bring a ‚Äúgun to a knife fight.‚Äù  Won base over as the wrecking ball against the establishment and would ‚Äúslash the throat‚Äù of the Democrats.
@BillKristol makes great point - Trump didn‚Äôt know how dangerous his rhetoric was.  We worried about Pat Buchanan because we knew he was playing with rhetorical fire.  Trump didn‚Äôt know what he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt say‚Äù and simply charged forward.
@BillKristol calls racist, demagogic, xenophobic elements of the movement ‚Äúrecessive genes‚Äù which included Joe McCarthy and George Wallace.  How leaders like George H. W. Bush rejected these ‚Äúrecessive‚Äù elements.  Now these elements increasingly dominant within the movement.
@BillKristol gives defense of his support for Palin as VP pick by noting his then-stated preference that McCain pick Joe Lieberman in 2008.  Flatly states that Trump is first truly ‚Äúdemagogic‚Äù President in US history, despite past demagogic elements in political history.
@Peter_Wehner mentions how Trump began political career based on racist conspiracy theory of birtherism.  Followed by pointing out intellectual history of conservatism compared to current moment. Ends saying Trump experiment is likely to ‚Äúcome crashing down‚Äù in 2019.
@JRubinBlogger more critical of conservative movement overall.  As I heard, movement failed to keep up on policy and keep creating new solutions.  Also mentions conservative blind spot on race.
@monacharenEPPC starts with a defense of prior conservative policy, critique of identity politics, and concern over the reactionary backlash to identity politics.

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got, folks.  I pray Election Twitter is kind in noting my inevitable inaccuracies or incorrect conclusions.  I also pray there is a gerrymandering question on the Bar Exam.  19/19   #ncpol #SCOTUS #Gerrymandering
Judge Wynn‚Äôs opinion considers numerous legal theories to justify the District Court‚Äôs unanimous ruling that partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  If SCOTUS is willing to continue holding out, Common Cause may prove to be the ideal test case moving forward. 18/
Thus ends my rambling on today‚Äôs rulings.  I will again draw your attention to a certain District Court opinion out of North Carolina, Common Cause v. Rucho.  The case is based on individual challenges in each congressional district, helping plaintiffs achieve standing. 17/
An argument for political parties, to which Justice Kennedy is likely receptive, may be that the result is to burden the associational and free speech rights of political parties in their representation of their members. 16/
In other words, while individual plaintiffs may not challenge legislative maps on a statewide basis, it may be appropriate for political parties to assert statewide challenges. 15/
But one sentence jumped off the page, and could impact how future cases proceed: ‚ÄúPartisan-asymmetry metrics such as the efficiency gap measure something else entirely: the effect that a gerrymander has on the fortunes of political parties.‚Äù 14/
SCOTUS rules that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue, and sent the case back to the District Court in so the individual plaintiffs may retry their case under the proper standing rules.  This is anti-climactic, but in keeping with longstanding SCOTUS jurisprudence. 13/
The result of this ruling is that, for individual plaintiffs, the remedy ‚Äúrequires revising only such districts as are necessary to reshape the voter‚Äôs district ‚Äì so that the voter may be unpacked or uncracked, as the case may be.‚Äù 12/
He votes for a single representative.  The boundaries of the district, and the composition of its voters, determine whether and to what extent a particular voter is packed or cracked.‚Äù 11/
‚ÄúTo the extent the plaintiffs‚Äô alleged harms is the dilution of their votes, that injury is district specific.  An individual voter in Wisconsin is placed in a single district . . . 10/
In Gill, however, the individual plaintiffs alleged the unconstitutionality of Wisconsin‚Äôs legislative districts based on the map as a whole, not on the basis of each individual district.  But here, SCOTUS is saying that this novel theory of standing is not appropriate.  9/
Gerrymandering jurisprudence has traditionally required that plaintiffs allege the unconstitutionality of a specific legislative district.  ‚ÄúWe have long recognized that a person‚Äôs right to vote is ‚Äòindividual and personal in nature.‚Äô‚Äù 8/
‚Äú[Two questions remain]: what is necessary to show standing in a case of this sort, and whether those claims are justiciable . . . the plaintiffs in this case have not shown standing under the theory upon which they based their claims for relief.‚Äù 7/
Chief Justice Roberts admirably got a unanimous opinion by reducing the question to standing ‚Äì did plaintiffs have the ability to sue?  Standing requires that plaintiffs have been injured, that the defendant caused the injury, and that a court may redress that injury.  6/
Which brings us to Gill! https://t.co/nFcz13dVtx		First of all, Gill offers a great summary of partisan gerrymandering jurisprudence.  A great entry point or refresher on how partisan gerrymandering works, or doesn‚Äôt, under the law.  5/
1) Plaintiffs missed their chance by waiting until 2017 to challenge the 2011 maps.  2) The District Court properly denied the injunction since partisan gerrymandering claims are murky, and it was ok deny the injunction until after SCOTUS offered guidance in Gill v. Whitford. 4/
SCOTUS reviewed a preliminary injunction to prevent the 2018 election under the existing 2011 maps and require a redraw.  At issue is whether the District Court properly denied the injunction due to the unsettled nature of gerrymandering claims. SCOTUS makes two main points.  3/
First at bat is Benisek, the Maryland case, which is basically all procedural - https://t.co/WSuk2J0GSW  2/
A quick Bar study break is clearly in order to take a peak at what SCOTUS hath wrought in its partisan gerrymandering cases.  Based on my *haphazard* review of their rulings today, a few thoughts (ok a lot of them): 1/

There are many ideas about how to ‚Äúfix‚Äù Washington, but a perfect starting point would be reclaiming regular order and passing a budget.  It may seem minor, but if Congress can reassert its most basic responsibility, then perhaps there‚Äôs hope for the republic. 5/5
I think the political impact will be minimal. Midterm elections have low turnout, so mobilizing the party base is a top priority.  This shutdown will play well with both parties‚Äô bases, while those in the middle will continue to feel frustrated and alienated by DC dysfunction. 4/
The Trump era news cycle moves at warp speed.  The Trump Presidency has created or sustained more controversy in one year than past Presidents could fit into four years.  My guess is that the shutdown will be long forgotten by the time voters show up in November. 3/
The 2013 shutdown had little impact on the 2014 election.  By Election Day, voters were far more concerned about ISIS and Ebola than the shutdown - regardless of who they blamed for it when it was happened. 2/

@catlawson Couldn't agree more!
All that said, a fantastic and thoughtful read for anyone interested in our political moment.  Haidt‚Äôs writing is well-structured and readable, and his hypotheses heavily researched and fairly explored.  Well worth your time! 7/7
Finally, for his third theme, Haidt looks to evolution to explore our tribal minds and group selection.  In essence ‚Äì when and why do we shut off our individual self and focus on the good of the group?  He uses this to explore nations, religions, and politics. 6/
For the second theme, Haidt is concerned with the ‚Äútaste receptors‚Äù of morality ‚Äì what activates our moral senses and which senses are strongest?  He outlines the six senses of morality, and posits how they are interpreted differently by liberals and conservatives. 5/
The first theme focuses on the balance between reason and emotion.  Haidt‚Äôs research found that, more often than not, reasons acts to justify our emotion.  In other words, we hear a fact, make a judgment, then reason our way back to that judgment.  4/
Haidt‚Äôs general premise breaks down into three main themes: (1) ‚ÄúIntuitions come first, strategic reasoning second‚Äù (2) ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more to morality than harm and fairness‚Äù and (3) ‚ÄúMorality binds and blinds.‚Äù 3/
Shout out to the dynamic duo, @catlawson and @josh_lawson for this very timely recommendation.  I've personally been pondering our tribal politics, and Haidt's book (written in 2012!) presents an empirical and science-based review of the moral psychology behind tribalism. 2/

I‚Äôm clearly fascinated by this moment in gerrymandering jurisprudence.  There is major action on the horizon, and I‚Äôll keep an eye on things so you don‚Äôt have to.  Until next time, Twitterers! 14/14
I think I‚Äôve sufficiently bored y‚Äôall, so I‚Äôll mercifully bring this thread to its overdue end.  All of this to say that I find it likely SCOTUS will take up Common Cause and hear it along with Benisek.  13/
All three of these cases are singing from the same hymnal of 1st Amendment claims (among others).  Clearly they got the message from Kennedy‚Äôs concurrence in Vieth, which preserved partisan gerrymandering as a claim 12/
With Kennedy close to retirement, I think he wants to rule on a partisan gerrymandering standard one last time before leaving the Court. His concurrence in Vieth v Jubelirer pointed plaintiffs towards 1st Amendment rights as the proper basis for partisan gerrymandering claims 11/
The two are also both congressional district lines, unlike the state legislative districts in Gill.  This would allow the Court to rule on similar district lines from opposing political parties, thus establishing a more firm footing for whatever their decision may be 10/
What I‚Äôm getting at here is my belief that SCOTUS is highly likely to take on Common Cause for the Spring term.  It would pair a GOP redistricting with a Dem redistricting in Benisek, helping to erase concerns of judicial partisanship 9/
Pulling all these together - it seems likely to me that Kennedy wants to have a ruling on partisan gerrymandering.  Not certain, but just a guess.  Gill used to look like the only vehicle for a ruling, but now Benisek and Common Cause seem to be better candidates 8/
My running question has been whether SCOTUS would rule on Gill based on the merits, or reject it on standing grounds.  To my knowledge (and I welcome corrections!) Benisek and Common Cause do not appear to have those same standing concerns. 7/
VERY brief detour to point out that, in redistricting jurisprudence, congressional lines and state legislative lines are often treated differently.  As such, the SCOTUS ruling in Gill would influence Benisek or Common Cause, but would not be entirely conclusive 6/
Which brings us to Common Cause v. Rucho.  Like Benisek, the basic complaint is a partisan gerrymander, but unlike Benisek, it is based on Republican drawn lines. 5/
Meanwhile in Maryland, Benisek v. Lamone has been called up by SCOTUS for a hearing in its Spring term.  The basic complaint here is a partisan gerrymander of Maryland‚Äôs congressional districts.  Of note - these are Democratic drawn lines. 4/
There was a big standing issue which may get in the way of a merits-based ruling in Gill.  The plaintiffs sued the plan on a statewide basis, whereas typically standing should be found within each legislative district. 3/
For those of you playing at home, SCOTUS heard Gill v. Whitford in October, but has yet to issue a ruling.  Claim there was a partisan gerrymander of the Wisconsin state legislative lines.  2/
Won‚Äôt have a chance to read the ruling in Common Cause v Rucho right away, but a few thoughts on how this fits into the context of partisan gerrymandering claims. 1/

That's the end of my Thursday ramblings - feel free to correct or inform me.  Tomorrow I'll post some notes on Cooper v. Berger #ncpol 18/x
SCOTUS touched on party/race question in Cooper v. Harris.  Will continue to be of concern moving forward, particularly in the South 17/
If African-American voters are overwhelmingly Democratic, how can district lines be drawn for partisan purposes without touching race? 16/
Same thing here.  Lines struck as racial gerrymander, redrawn without considering race.  This starts to get into the race/party issue 15/
Echoes Common Cause partisan gerrymander case.  After Congressional lines struck down as racial gerrymander NCGA only used partisan data 14/
NCGA explicitly chose not to use racial data during its redraw.  Plaintiffs explicitly used racial data in their redraw. 13/
I cannot possibly guess how this process will play out.  I‚Äôm most interested to see how/if Prof. Persily uses racial data during redraw 12/
Mostly unsurprising order.  Court is formalizing what they implied in their original order ‚Äúintending‚Äù to appoint Prof. Persily 11/
Beyond that, order focuses on the procedure to be followed, and the manner in which the parties may (or may not) engage in this process 10/
And finally, may consider race in redrawing the districts ‚Äì something which NCGA expressly chose not to include as a criteria 9i/
After districts are redrawn, may be adjusted to avoid pairing incumbents BUT otherwise cannot consider incumbency or election results 9g-9h/
Strive to i. split fewer precincts than 2011 ii. Draw more districts more compact than 2011 iii. Consider municipal and precinct lines 9f/
Use 2017 redrawn county groupings; comply with Whole County Provision if possible, but only while in compliance w/ federal VRA 9d-9e/
Use 2010 Census Data; draw contiguous districts with population deviation up to +/- 5% based on 2010 district sizes 9b-c/
Beyond that, fix other 5 gerrymandered districts without changing surrounding lines unless necessary to remedy these lines 9a2/
Must redraw the 2 Sen &amp; 2 House gerrymandered districts, and any others within that county grouping needed to cure the gerrymanders. 9a1/
More importantly, the order details the criteria which may be used by Prof. Persily in drawing the districts. Here we go: 9/
Court then formally appoints Prof. Persily, outlines process for analysis and redraw, and how parties may or may not engage in process. 8/
‚Äú‚Ä¶ the [NCGA] was prohibited by the [NC] Constitution from redrawing these districts.‚Äù  i.e. redrew 10, when only allowed to redraw 5. 7/
‚ÄúNone . . was found to be an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, nor do any of these districts adjoin such a district.‚Äù 6/
This leaves 5 House subject districts to be remedied, court concerned 5 other House districts surrounding these were improperly redrawn 5/
In this order, the court notes ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù that 2 Sen &amp; 2 House seats ‚Äúfail to remedy‚Äù the racial gerrymander. 4/
In last order, the court found ‚Äúlikely possibility‚Äù that 2 Sen &amp; 7 House seats remained unconstitutional despite the legislative redraw. 3/
As a reminder, in last order, District Court announced its intention to appoint Prof. Persily, subject to objections from the parties. 2/
A little late on this, but looked at the Covington order formally appointing Prof. Persily as Special Master in this case #ncpol 1/

@persily Entirely possible that they uphold the maps as redrawn.  Perhaps we'll have a final answer by Thanksgiving . . . ü¶Éü¶Éü¶É
In other words - federal judges w/ broad dockets want someone of @persily's expertise to evaluate "likely possibility" of failure to remedy
‚Äú...the Court expects...the Special Master to assist the Court in further evaluating and, if necessary, redrawing the Subject Districts.‚Äù
Appointing the special master ‚ÄúIn anticipation of the likely possibility of such a finding‚Äù ‚Äì i.e. haven‚Äôt technically ruled on the maps.
Tip their hand saying ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù 3 Sen and 7 House Districts ‚Äúeither fail to remedy‚Äù the gerrymander, or ‚Äúotherwise legally unacceptable.‚Äù
Technically, judges are not saying that the lines failed to remedy the racial gerrymander.  Instead, hiring special master to help evaluate.

@mellanzzz @WFULawSchool So awesome!  Great quote by Mickey - ‚ÄúKelsey performed beautifully, answering the panel‚Äôs many questions with confidence and ease.‚Äù #godeacs
I believe Americans can unite towards the ideals which founded and sustained our nation.  It all starts with listening to one another again.
"Self-correction is the secret strength of freedom. We are a nation with a history of resilience and a genius for renewal."
"And it means that the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation."
"Americans have a great advantage: To renew our country, we only need to remember our values."
"The health of the democratic spirit itself is at issue. And the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand."
An excellent speech from former President Bush about the challenges facing America - both foreign and domestic.		https://t.co/SZ8NhMGMay

@sdgilleran Thanks!
In case my earlier tweets weren't enough, here's a helpful take from @newsobserver on opening day of Common Cause v. Rucho. https://t.co/sDtnYREteT
@washingtonpost You may now return to your regularly schedule Twitter TL.  Thanks! 22/X
@washingtonpost Ramble over, thanks for letting me flood your TL.  Sorry to @washingtonpost for accidentally replying to you on most of this storm. 21/
@washingtonpost Literally no idea how court may rule.  Middle District has not been kind to NCGA lately, but partisan gerrymandering is unsettled law. 20/
@washingtonpost In per curiam opinion, district court denied motion.  Shows an openness to partisan gerrymander as a justiciable issue, not political. 19/
@washingtonpost Earlier in litigation, Def. moved for summary judgment under Rule 12(b)(6) "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." 18/
@washingtonpost Trial was originally scheduled for July, but delayed.  Despite Gill v. Whitford before SCOTUS, district court still wanted to proceed. 17/
@washingtonpost Defendants also skeptical that this is a judicial question.  Rather, partisan redistricting is a political question, not judicial. 16/
@washingtonpost Defendants argue they followed ‚Äútraditional redistricting principles more closely than any other congressional plan in [NC] history.‚Äù 15/
@washingtonpost Plaintiffs' goal to show impermissible viewpoint discrimination, equal protection violation, and/or elections clause violation. 14/
@washingtonpost Not same standard as efficiency gap, attempting to find alternate measure for discriminatory effects, even if not within Gill framework. 13/
@washingtonpost *Another sidenote - this Duke website goes into detail about methodology of one of the experts https://t.co/YSrJT1w7Vl 12/
@washingtonpost Purport to show NC lines are statistical outliers measured against traditional criteria, and reflect maximum political advantage. 11/
@washingtonpost Common Cause plaintiffs have called experts who drew thousands of maps using traditional redistricting criteria. 10/
*Sidenote - Helpful article from @WashingtonPost re: efficiency gap here: https://t.co/kLYNkDfm3S 9/
League Plaintiffs using same framework.  Also implicating Efficiency Gap (used in Gill) as the proper measure of discriminatory effect. 8/
Gill used 3-prong test 1) Intent to discriminate politically; 2) effect to discriminate politically; 3) was there state justification 7/
Core of complaints is same as Gill v. Whitford.  When legislature entrenches itself through partisan advantage, abridgment of con rights 6/
Plaintiffs now challenging lines as partisan gerrymander.  Two suits were merged ‚Äì one by Common Cause, one by League of Women Voters. 5/
During map deliberations, House Redistricting Chair David Lewis stated using political data as criteria was ‚Äúto gain partisan advantage‚Äù 4/
Quick background here ‚Äì NC redrew congressional lines after Cooper v. Harris ruled that congressional lines were racial gerrymander. 3/
For my fellow redistricting nerds, Common Cause v. Rucho began today in federal district court - newest NC redistricting case on the block.
#NCPOL Weather Alert ‚Äì Redistricting Tweetstorm Imminent.
@sdgilleran Perhaps, but same logic applies to NCGA.  Requiring SM suggestions seems more about judicial efficiency since lines must be ready for ‚Äô18.
RT @AnneBlythe1: Judges prepare for possibility of appointing special master to redraw #NCGA maps.#redistricting #gerrymander #ncpol https:‚Ä¶
Ultimately three options - 1) accept NCGA maps, 2) accept plaintiff maps, or 3) draw lines themselves.  1 &amp; 3 seem most likely here.
Regardless of how (or if) court answers that question, possibility remains for court to draw lines themselves via special master.
Big picture - if original lines impermissibly used race do new maps, which did not consider race at all, remedy the racial gerrymander?
