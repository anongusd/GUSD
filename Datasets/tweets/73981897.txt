@LeeStriar I THINK [not super sure] that its the ability to plow capital gains from earlier investments [or stock options from work] into an OZ w/o realizing capital gains then,  that drives it. AND, the tax breaks -10% at 5 years, 15 at 10 - are similar to lock ups w/ hedge funds and PE

@slbernhardt @mustafarashed My original point was that McConnell's attempt to cause trouble for the Democratic senators running for President by forcing a vote on GND resolution was typical DC nonsense that voters won't give two fucks about either way come the primaries next year or the actual election
@slbernhardt @mustafarashed Hell, I'm not the one who compared the two, Mustafa was.
@slbernhardt @mustafarashed All I meant, at the start of this, was that the Wall is a very, very popular thing with Trump's base. GND is very popular with the left. Neither had/has much chance of quick enactment. But GND isn't being presented as a promise in same way the Wall was. It's more aspirational
@slbernhardt @mustafarashed A wide swath of the population like GND policies when they're presented in a favorable light.
@slbernhardt @mustafarashed I think they're both very popular ideas with their respective bases, and I think the other sides are happy to elevate them to deflate said bases when they aren't delivered.
For its role in '08 crisis, DB agreed to spend $4.1B to help poor borrowers and underwater mortgages. Now, it's gonna use it for new loans. It's already being investigated by a joint house panel. This may inspire more hearings: DOJ for allowing this.    https://t.co/HepObkrHSH

@DanthePHLman @JGitto @phlsharp @aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ Clarke would be the most impact, obviously, and I suspect isn't as hard a target as everyone just assumes because of his council presidency. His district has changed a ton... a well-funded, thoughtful candidate who has ties to North Philly could take it...
@DanthePHLman @JGitto @phlsharp @aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ Henon is pretty on board with Urbanist stuff, but he's in the NEast so none of the Greater Center City urbanists care. Squilla just does what the local RCOs want - he's very explicit about that! Quiñones-Sanchez almost scuttled American Street, is deeply unpopular with the party
@DanthePHLman @JGitto @phlsharp @aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ So far, there appears to be one urbanist-friendly candidate, Lauren Vidas, out of ten districts. Like, recruit someone to run against Jannie! I've been to lots of community meetings in West Philly, and community leaders there are DEFINITELY open to the idea of new blood.
@DanthePHLman @JGitto @phlsharp @aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ I don't disagree that the clubby stuff should change. But that's an even larger, more intractable issue, and I don't see any thoughtful strategy to win district council seats. And any bureaucrat worth a damn works within the system, so calling for their heads is just asinine.
@aaronbauman @phlsharp @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ Yeah! That! Do that more! Less dunking on your natural allies in government! Or calling everyone names online! That doesn’t help!
@JGitto @phlsharp @aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ I mean, guys, I’ve followed this for years and Philly is super behind almost every city. I know you’ve been mobilizing — that’s good! — but the twitter stuff is a constant step backwards
@phlsharp @aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ Make arguments that appeal to them — OTIS does this. Bike lanes are good for small businesses - emphasize THAT, not your own safety. More bikes = less cars, faster traffic. And just don’t resort to the hysterical online mob stuff. That really hurts the cause.
@phlsharp @aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ ... so screaming that it’s tantamount to murder will only make people think you’re insane — that’s just what people do, after all. Urbanists in philly seem to assume everyone already reads streetsblog; you need to meet residents where they are and coax more.
@phlsharp @aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ That’s a tougher question and like most journalists I prefer to point out problems without offering solutions. But: change tone. Talk to neighbors without the histrionics — even if you’re right about blocked sidewalks, that’s the prevailing norm in most philly hoods...

@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ But raising the ire of your opponents motivates them to turn out at RCO meetings. Consider a new strategy or tactics is all I’m saying — I’m very sympathetic to the goals — because the current one is failing miserably.
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ I’m sure I’ll get dunked on some more for this response, but seriously, Philly’s urbanists are often their own worst enemy. You need to convince people who don’t already agree with you; you alienate them instead. You’re not numerous enough to mobilize in great numbers...
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ Sure, Philly shouldn’t be the place where Councilmembers introduce bills for someone because “he’s a good guy” BUT IT IS. You’re not going to reform government AND get your urbanist policies! So pick one and try to make it happen!
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ I can’t count the amount of times in my 4 years covering all this that someone in council or city government said “those guys are assholes”. It doesn’t help your fucking cause to be known as assholes! Philly has famously relationship-based politics!!
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ And when you go to the meetings, they almost always HATE bike lanes! I know you want a more technocratic government BUT you don’t have it. So Jesus fucking Christ, realize the political realities and change course.
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ Like, aren’t you guys tired of fucking losing every goddamn fight? Of bike lanes taking years to happen because of council’s pusillanimity? OTIS WANTS the same things as you. They just don’t want to get fired and so they have to listen to what neighborhoods want
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ So call me an asshole, an idiot, a fucking privilege ableist, whatever. Call for the heads of middle level bureaucrats who are really on your side but because every RCO except for like 3 are vehemently against your side can’t do what they really want.
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ People who should be on your side — people who are on your side!! — really dislike how you guys operate. You remain a minority in the city and trying to shame and harass people to your side will only repulse people. It’s not helping!
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ I’m not some anti-urbanist asshole, but apparently everyone fucking forgot that. I am sick of watching a protected bike lane on pine/spruce become maybe a left side bike lane. I’m sick of urbanists losing every. single. fight. The online mob is counterproductive.
@aaronbauman @jongeeting @bluebees @bensh__ Everyone is missing my point. I’m getting attacked online and anonymous accounts are calling me ableist, which is absurd because I’ve written more about wheelchair accessibility than anyone. My point isn’t about policy. It’s about politics.

@aaronbauman @bluebees @bensh__ @jongeeting All I'm saying is: setting up an US v. THEM when they have a massive numbers advantage is a losing strategy. If you were trying to sway them, that'd be great, but I don't see any evidence of trying to win over potential converts. Just mobilizing the choir.
@aaronbauman @bluebees @bensh__ @jongeeting Right. And if you had data on times that led to accidents, I'd be with you. And if Philly wasn't rife with aggressive jay walkers, I'd be with you. But we don't even have anecdotal evidence and people cross between cars in the dark and nearly get hit by me on a bike like daily.
@bluebees @aaronbauman @bensh__ @jongeeting The urbanist crowd seems to want the city to institute these sticks against cars - parking bans, stricter ticketing, etc. - pitting you against the majority of voters. Maybe look at some carrots? Look at ways you can win over car owners a bit?
@bluebees @aaronbauman @bensh__ @jongeeting But that'd be bad for a lot of the city-based customers, who'd then be stranded. I know there are safety concerns about blocking peds on sidewalks, but that's always struck me as a bit of a red herring - it's annoying, sure, but is it a legit safety issue?
@bluebees @aaronbauman @bensh__ @jongeeting Almost all bike shops put bikes-for-sale out on the sidewalk. Should that be banned? Sidewalk cafes? 		Car-related businesses need room for customers' cars. Room is at a premium in the city. I know you guys want all those businesses to relocate to industrial wilds or burbs...

I don’t get PA GOP’s end game here. Do they think voters in that district will be happy that Williams is denied seat on a technicality that the courts took a pass on (arguably because of a different technicality)? It’s a single seat and they still have a sizable majority https://t.co/2RdBnRqrJS

@lizgreenspan This is something I heard from a few folks today -- Philly consulting/law firms well positioned to market services to Amazon, plus some vendors. As for commuters, well, its a ridiculous commute [though some do it!] Also heard hope more firms priced out of NYC/DC move here

Also, this line held up well: "If—and this is the $5 billion “if”—this is not just a clever way of eliciting larger subsidies from the company’s secretly favored location, Philadelphia’s business and civic leaders think the city has a real, honest-to-goodness chance."
Now, the fun stuff: How much is Amazon getting from New York and Virginia in incentives? Will Philly and the other also-rans release their bids now, or continue to fight FOIA/RTK law requests in court? Will my editors allow a "Amazon to Philly: HQ2 bad for you" headline?!? https://t.co/dqZyZB0Sag
I'm not saying those fears were founded, but they were real. And now, all moot.
Also, after the initial hype, outside of big city booster types, I think I heard more anxiety from folks about what Amazon would mean than excitement. Like, anyone not in tech or business seemed worried about what it'd do to their rent or property taxes.
The NoVa folks will be upset that I call Crystal City "DC", but, like, c'mon guys. Everyone call that "just outside DC"

Also, reading this having recently finished Profiles in Courage, polarization and party divides can only be healed by the party in power. It requires someone to not press their advantage for maximal gain, and that usually carries massive political costs. 	https://t.co/2h9Bu1dvYt
I should add that the economy is still booming. That might not be the case come 2020 - we're 'due' for a downturn. Dem attacks on tariffs might land then. But Trump/Reps will play this same playbook, and it doesn't look like Democrats have figured out a counter yet...
But that doesn't seem likely. Forecasters predict Senate stays with the GOP, House may flip. So I think we might settle into this same partisan bunker mentality we're in now and have been in the last 2-3 years. 		https://t.co/2h9Bu1dvYt
One thing that seems evident to me as moderates lament how quickly the GOP has embraced Trump is that they have been winning on many issues dear to them: taxes, regulations, judges. They might change tune, find spines, put country over party, etc. if they lose big on Election Day
@jtannen215 Haha, yeah, esp. because 2010 was the GOP's 1st REDMAP year - I think it history will deem it an one-off Tsunami among midterm waves; this year, Dem's have their own nat'l state race effort to match it. Still, it's very neat stuff and I appreciate all the number crunching.

@JGitto Nah, we got at least a full day of liberal outlets dissecting Warren's decision to renew this fight as either smart or stupid, same on the right, plus different native groups weighing in with their competing takes.
Like, I don't really think there is a huge untapped market of news consumers out of the rest of America who is turned off by political coverage, so I get why for profit outlets go after the eyeballs they can get, and even why nonprofits do too. But I still wish it happened less
The Warren/Trump bickering about native heritage strikes me as one of those stupid fights that make non-partisan Americans hate politics but partisans love. And because partisans are news fiends, it gets a lot of coverage because stupid political fights = lots of clicks.

@ByChrisBrennan And they dedicate staff to this kind of internet trawling for stories that'll be used by Dems to virtue signal on social media and thus go viral, instead of dedicating staff to original reporting.
@ByChrisBrennan I don't think editors are holding thoughtful conversations about how and whether to cover this kind of thing. I think they go "this will get the clicks" and that's it.
@ByChrisBrennan Chris, as I think you know, I think highly of PMN. There's a reason why I called out NYT and not the inky. You guys covered it appropriately. But every national outlet tele-parachuting in to cover the comment is amplifying it and rewarding bad behavior. I bet Wagner got a $ bump
@Haver_Lisa @PhillyInquirer I'm not dissing the local coverage. It's not the Inky's fault - they covered the comment the appropriate amount. It's the dozens of other national outlets that pick this up as 'news' and thereby reward this sort of thing.
@Haver_Lisa Like, the NYT has resources Philly outlets can only dream of. Maybe they should have a reporter work on actual issues instead of piggy backing on a dumb comment that'll only further discourse's death spiral
@Haver_Lisa No, but that's a false dichotomy. There is no thoughtful debate about whether to cover this or how much - it's an editor going "oh, he said something outlandish, lets do a story" - that's it. There are real issues here - education, guns, pensions, etc. - maybe do stories on them?

In contrast, Democrats can safely expect ~90% of the African-American vote in any given race. The assumption has been that GOP anti-immigrant rhetoric would drive Hispanic support behind Democrats, but they lag in likelihood to vote, and of those expected, sizable % back GOP
A lot of people assume Hispanics must love immigration, but they're pretty split. Anecdotally, a LOT of ICE agents are second gen. Polls show sizable chunk oppose paths to citizenship. Also, it's not the #1 issue for them.		https://t.co/1WuPL0UPlV	https://t.co/AScTsGrZNs https://t.co/C9mSelUjkA

@citrusade This is a fair point but this is a debate, quite literally, above my pay grade. I have rules my bosses have laid out that I need to follow here.
@bradamant I very much believe that SCOTUS justices should be held not just to a higher standard, but the highest standards. 		GOP seems to believe making this a partisan fight helps them retain the senate (per a Politico story I can’t find right now)
@citrusade I need to get working on some deadlines, so all I can say at this time is, as I said earlier, I am very concerned that this nomination affair will turn what shouldn’t be a partisan matter (believing women) into a partisan matter going forward.
@citrusade *were. Stupid autocorrect
@citrusade I’m a reporter, I can’t take sides in allegations. 		It’s a reference to things self-identified MeToo supporters and Kavanaugh opponents of his age have said to me: that there was, back then, a rape culture that they now recognize as horrific but we’re complicit in at the time.
@citrusade I did not say that, and if that’s how it came off, I apologize. I’m very much just trying to explore some of the thinking by supporters and opponents alike. As I said, and to be clear, none of this is meant to condone the alleged actions
RT @SteveKornacki: Two days after a poll (whose methodology was challenged by @PollsterPatrick) put Menendez up only two points in NJ, here…
Hell, it probably already has. I haven’t been following all that closely. Anyway, we’re all floating down shit creek without a paddle, and as I read more about the Reconstruction era, I have my doubts we will be able to heal the shallower divides now
Perhaps just as unfortunate a side effect: believing women may become caught up in the partisan divide. I fear #MeToo may get painted as just a rebranding of the “radical feminist agenda” and “another attempt by Hollywood and NYC to impose their liberal values on real Americans”
But he didn’t. They’re appealing to partisanship and that “larger truth” again. And it’ll probably work, and the nation will go even deeper and further into the partisan divide that threatens to make the nation ungovernable.
As Harris says (and I’ve seen others say it too): there’s a chance BK has no recollection because he was blacked out at the time. The gambit would have been to admit this and apologize, seek forgiveness, offer an example of how other men could confront their past, shameful selves
To be clear: I don’t condone in any way the alleged assault on Dr. Blasey Ford, whom seems credible to me. And I was -1 years old in 1982. But a year prior, Porky’s came out, and the protagonists, the “good guys”, spied on girls in a shower and it was considered all good fun.
This sums up most of my thoughts on this matter. I’d add only that many BK supporters (+ some opponents I’ve spoken to) question judging his ‘82 actions by ‘18 norms, i.e. the argument that guys back then were oblivious to the traumas they were causing.		https://t.co/2wnGzODK53

Like this DEFINITELY reads as "No, really, fellow Serious Adult Americans, I'm like you, please don't blacklist me after this fiasco is all said and done (should we survive it)!" It's like a bullshit buffet, its so self-serving.
Also, like, don't you get "effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more" with President Pence, minus all the bad? And can't you go on record and very publicly declare this danger and force the House GOP to consider impeachment?

@wbender99 This is the kind of tweet that will emerge right after you get hired by the Times or Atlantic, and then cause your immediate firing.
@ryannorthmiller That's a good point. I think I'm too influenced by Philly politics, where all the Dems kind of hate each other and the Reps largely don't matter. Philly has tons of liberals and lefties, but Dems in general don't inspire the same party loyalty as the GOP, and esp. so 'round here
@ryannorthmiller Like, average individual GOPer SHOULD, in theory, go "sure, some GOP colleagues will lose, we won't control congress this round, but I'll survive and face weaker primary opponents + still-feckless Dems in general; and we'll be back later." but thats not how it seems to game out.
@ryannorthmiller It also requires a level of myopia - can't let GOP lose a few races after reforms - that is ultimately irrational or requires them to be venal, i.e. a belief that voters would never swing back after. That would require THEIR belief their policies aren't best for broad US public.
@ryannorthmiller Gotcha. I guess what I still struggle to fathom is how people who would be so party loyal/unselfish [in that they put party + policy ends above own political gains] are also so unloyal/selfish that they are quitting in droves right now.
@lil_yenta @rw_briggs No, your random person tweets were semi-coherent lefty statements of support, not incoherent maybe-lefty attacks.
@ryannorthmiller So even if the donors scare up a primary opponent and fund them well, the hypothetical GOP incumbent has incumbency on their side, this issue, and, presumably, a relatively orthodox Republican voting record to run on.
@ryannorthmiller Eh, I don't buy that. That requires people - not just donors, but voters - to care about procedural matters, when they largely don't. And even if they did, those reforms are broadly popular. [https://t.co/Q4l4VNvqJG + https://t.co/y5M346io2b].
@rw_briggs @lil_yenta Eh, re-reading random person tweet attacking developers, it might not be a lefty attack. It's a little incoherent. Anyway, i stand by my bet that this bill passes

@rw_briggs @jongeeting The route would entail ripping up all of Rouse Blvd or Broad or both. and they'd have to take serious pains to avoid knocking down one of those fancy ass new buildings or historic old ones. Absent helicoptering, that's disruptive for all means, including the free bus!

@rogerdupuis2 None of that should be considered inherently offensive. The book I quoted is the ONLY book I could find that even attempted to explain railfaning, so I decided to quote it at length.
@rogerdupuis2 It is, &amp; one I think is valid here. All the railfans I spoke w/ that Saturday understood that outsiders might find their interest peculiar. All were game to try to explain it. All basically said what Burkhart did-they couldn't really say why. That left me to speak with academics

@Andypry @rw_briggs I'm a long ways away from refing that level. Good luck to your bro!
@Andypry @rw_briggs Like, by analogy, the reason is "I once dropped an egg because my hands were greasy and it broke" so the rule in response is "egg cartons must come with labels that say 'if you drop an egg, it will break'". The response will do nothing going forward or change any behavior
@Andypry @rw_briggs This is the thing! That's never going to be dispositive in a lawsuit, which itself would be exceedingly unlikely! And if its mandatory, it ONLY impacts liability if a company ignores it, but even then, not dispositive! [unless the statute says it should be taken as negligence]
@rw_briggs Also, they are all stupid. This is my main gripe. They are really goddamn stupid.
@DanthePHLman Rugby is a club sport for the most part in college. There are some varsity squads out there, not sure what level ref certification I would need, but presumably higher than my current status: lowest
@rw_briggs Truth. I get the intent, and there's a workable theory that not enough people were aware of child abuse/knew to trust their gut and say something. But, seriously, I'm not working with kids, and the ref isn't the guy who'll be in a position to see something.
@Andypry While this is undoubtedly the reasoning, it is bad reasoning. I can pretty much guarantee that this will do nothing to mitigate liability.
@YoChangedMyName This is undoubtedly the reason. Also why I'm going through multiple background checks that ask me to list every address I've lived at and ever person I've lived with going back 12 years before I was born. 	I don't think these are effective measures at preventing another Sandusky
Also, I aced the pre-test, why do I have to go through the entire hour long module? This is insanely annoying
I really don't understand why, to ref college, men's and women's rugby, I need to take three hour+ long training modules on recognizing and reporting child sex abuse.

@DanielDenvir The independent and Dem Trump voters in Wash. county I spoke to said they were open to Lamb. Disliked Saccone on unions. Lamb avoided saying a negative thing publically about Trump. I think he wins a bunch. Everyone took pride in their lack of party fidelity
@DanielDenvir Like, I don’t think he’s doing much pandering to voters on issues. I think he really believes in most of his positions.
@DanielDenvir He ran mostly as a pro-union populist. Saccone’s positions on the far right allowed him to go moderate on some issues (e.g. Min. wage) without sacrificing labor voters. Also, I suspect that’s really just what he thinks

@abgutman That happens, but you may also need help with the pitches themselves then. Personally, I was slower to respond to super long pitches. Anyway, I gotta get writing but, like I said, happy to talk more in person sometime.
@abgutman Yeah man, move faster. After 24 hours, follow up email, say you'll pitch it elsewhere if you don't hear back. After 48, pitch someone else.
@abgutman Anything that has to turn around faster than like 3 days, then you need to talk to an editor about being a semi-regular contributor or stringing on those kind of topics. It's only worth broaching this if you've written a bunch for that editor and you two get along.
@abgutman I mean, that's the tough thing. I've had pitches sit for a week that I wound up writing. It depends on how timely you're talking. I think your stuff should have a decent shelf life, generally.
@abgutman But you're probably not doing any news - more analysis/opinion stuff - so your story should be able to remain interesting at least 3-4 days after you pitch it [1 day to accept pitch, day to write, day to edit]...
@abgutman 1) If you can get the editor's actual email, do that. Always worth asking around if anybody you know knows an editor at the publication.	2) This is tough, but never simultaneously. Rule of thumb: 1 day. If really fast moving, say so in pitch's 1st graf +say when you need response

@RobJoswiak But another reason to not speculate: we don’t know what other Republicans or Democrats may challenge in the primary. Some said this race was GOP’s way of just clearing Saccone from senate race, that he’s not the best candidate they could’ve run
@RobJoswiak But assuming no big changes, I think you’re right. GOP support will be spread thin, so presumably Lamb would outfundraise and have more time to get his name. His strategy is very in-person dependent, too, which is time intensive. Extra few months helps
@RobJoswiak I said as much in the piece but we ended up cutting it, and for good reason: until we know what the district will look like, it’s rank speculation. Lamb’s Mt. Lebanon home could remain in 18, or end up in 14 or 12.

So Broad Street line and Market Frankford lines will be free all day Thursday courtesy of IBX. Sorry for wrong tweet earlier, thought it was all modes. Not the case.
Lots of buses will be detoured Thursday. CCT running per normal but expect lots of delays because of the parade route street closures. https://t.co/FXvdhpti6W
Regional Rail: limited express service, ala pope visit. trail pass holders can get on. Plus 50,000 special day passes will be sold. Trains running just inbound in morning and outbound at night. (Except airport line, I think)
Free*
Deleted previous tweet because not all SEPTA Modes fee Thursday. Just subway, el, city trolleys. IBX sponsor.
MIGHT only be city transit lines. They said all free but just said normal fares on NHSL... https://t.co/FZ6zZAGJup
