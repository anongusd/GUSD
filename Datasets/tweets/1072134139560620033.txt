Just voted to end the #TrumpShutdown. Republicans have supported the bills we passed today to fund the government. Now it's time for the Senate and @realDonaldTrump to do the right thing.
Humbled and honored to take the oath of office today. Family and friends traveled all the way from California to join me, and I am so grateful for their support. Thank you! https://t.co/IDWD8zVKrl
Today's the big day! People in the 49th and all across the country called for new representation that shared their values, and now they're going to get it. I'm ready to get to work.
Must-read article exposing how @realDonaldTrump's EPA is making Americans sick. They put corporate special interests ahead of our health and well-being. 		Unacceptable. They're going to hear from me in the new Congress. https://t.co/9rWrZsS7ts
I commend the bipartisan work Democrats and Republicans did to unanimously pass a government funding plan in the Senate. But the president preferred a shutdown, and now we're here. 		Find out how the #TrumpShutdown could impact YOU: https://t.co/jdP2vsuZjO
The president said he would be "proud" to shut the government down. Well, the #TrumpShutdown is here. 		@realDonaldTrump, are you "proud" that over 420,000 federal employees - including law enforcement - are working without pay this holiday season? https://t.co/HKBauKkUZk
If the president decides to shut the government down over his immoral and ineffective border wall, he‚Äôs going to hurt people right here in the 49th. 		@realDonaldTrump, do the right thing. 	https://t.co/hhmWQJhCnJ
Six years since Sandy Hook.		The current Congress has done nothing to address the epidemic of gun violence.		The new Congress is coming soon.  The time has come to act.		I‚Äôm honored to be a new member of the Congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. https://t.co/h129YjNGEZ
I‚Äôve never been prouder to be a Californian.		-We protect our environment.		-We‚Äôre a hub of innovation.		-We believe in voting rights.		-We celebrate our diversity.		-We aren‚Äôt afraid to stand up to this administration.		I couldn‚Äôt be prouder to be representing #CA49 in Congress.
@arjav_rawal Just temporarily.  Moving to official account soon.
