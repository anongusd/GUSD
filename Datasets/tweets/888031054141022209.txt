Payrolls increased by 250,000 for October, and wage gains pass 3% for first time since the recession. Unemployment rate is the lowest it‚Äôs been since for nearly a half century. Thanks to the tax cuts and deregulation, our economy is firing on all cylinders! https://t.co/uEqRJbTqC3
Today‚Äôs ECI report is a strong indicator that worker pay and benefits are growing at the fastest pace since 2008! More evidence that @POTUS pro-growth policies are providing a better future for all Americans! 		‚Üí https://t.co/kkRpP3xLot
Under the leadership of @POTUS, this Administration reduced regulatory costs on businesses by $23 billion in FY18! This decrease is spurring innovation and job growth. 		‚Üí https://t.co/7Z7Y6RLdfh https://t.co/ty2L7SZibA
After years of failed policies, we are seeing the real benefits of President Trump‚Äôs economic agenda. Today‚Äôs #JobsReport shows continued job creation &amp; the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level since 1969. #MAGAnomics
Under the leadership of @POTUS, the United States now has a much stronger trade deal with Canada and Mexico. True to form, this president continues to foster economic excellence, and the new #USMCA deal will help grow an already booming American economy.
I applaud @SenRonJohnson and @SenatorLankford's legislation, the Reforming Government Act of 2018, which provides the Administration with the necessary tools to make the federal government more efficient, effective, and accountable to the American people. https://t.co/OlOTgYuy0f

Delighted to see @POTUS nominate Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. He is a highly qualified candidate who will be faithful and loyal to the Constitution. The Senate should swiftly confirm him.
