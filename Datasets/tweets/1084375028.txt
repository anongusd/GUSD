Manny Pacquiao humble and classy as always in post-fight interview.		Adrien Broner starts popping off when interview moves his way, Jim Gray shows he‚Äôs the superior counterpuncher by pointing out Broner only landed 8 punches per round and is 3-3-1 in his past 7 fights.
Round 12 goes to Pacquiao. 11 rounds to 1, 119-109 on my card. Easy decision. PacMan looked great tonight. #PacquiaoVsBroner
Round 11 to PacMan. Broner‚Äôs given up. Not even trying anymore. #PacquiaoVsBroner
Round 10 to Pacquiao. Broner running around the ring but not throwing punches. This is the problem with a counterpuncher uncomfortable with forcing the action when they‚Äôre way down on points late in the fight. #PacquiaoVsBroner
Huge Round 9 for PacMan. That left almost sent Broner back to Cincy. Barely stayed on his feet. Big night so far for Pacquiao.
Broner shows some life but Round 8 goes to Pacquiao. Continues to go upstairs with the jab as well as landing a number of body shots on Broner. #PacquiaoVsBroner
Huge Round 7 for Pacquiao! Broner hanging on for dear life. #PacquiaoVsBroner
Round 6 to Pacquiao despite big shot by Broner at end. Broner finally guards his face and leaves his midsection open. PacMan up 59-55 through six.
Round 5 could go either way, giving it narrowly to Pacquiao for landing more punches. #pacquiaovbroner
Broner comes alive and wins one in Round 4. Finally lands some counters. Still letting Pacquiao push him around and drive the action though.
Round 3 to Pacquiao. Up 30-27. Steady rights to Broner‚Äôs face the story of the fight. Broner usually good vs. southpaws but asleep at the switch tonight. #PacquiaoVsBroner
Round 2 goes to Pacquiao as well. Works in some power shots this round along with the steady jabs. He‚Äôs in clear control so far.
Round 1 to PacMan. Some good counters by Broner though.
PacMan coming out to ‚ÄúEye of the Tiger‚Äù! #PacquiaoBroner
