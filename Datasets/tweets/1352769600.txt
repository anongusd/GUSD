@I_CU_boy is a Buff legend. He was running as hard on his 41st carry as his first. Reminded me of Rahsaan Salaam in 1994 against Texas.
Saw an alarmingly lack of fire from the coaching staff. This isn't Jim Leavitt's defense anymore. Longing for the #moneygang
That was one one of the worst defensive performances I can remember seeing at Folsom. Appeared to be no adjustments to stop the QB from running all over us.
Before I start ranting about the CU game, let me get the prerequisites out of the way: I love the Buffs and will always support this team. Bleeding black and gold means being heartbroken when they lose.
