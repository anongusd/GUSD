And, of course, it should be noted that Pruitt has virtually no experience in enviro regulation or policy, unlike previous GOP EPA admins
To conclude, EPA nom Pruitt's legal efforts have appeared almost solely driven by politics - not the law.
(cont.) In one, he filed a Clean Air Act challenge in the wrong court, shopping for a more sympathetic judge. That led a speedy dismissal.

Woops. Sea World wasnt yesterday. It was Friday.
Also, today marks the second straight day where DC Circuit has upheld an agency action and Kavanaugh has dissented. (Sea World yesterday)
Kavanaugh has voted to uphold some EPA regs. But for EPA's three biggest rules - #CSAPR, #MATS and #GHGs - he has criticized the agency.
In the #CSAPR #SCOTUS case, it was Kavanaugh, who dissented at DC Circuit - again based on EPA's cost considerations.
Irony of the #CSAPR and #MATS cases: In #SCOTUS EPA argues they can consider costs. In #MATS, say they don't have to. Diff. sections of CAA.
Kavanaugh also quotes Cass Sunstein on cost, even though he OK'd the MATS standards when he was at OMB.
Kavanaugh dissent quotes Kagan in arguments in #SCOTUS CSAPR case on costs, which was argued the same day and hasn't been decided
Industry challengers in the MATS case still have options - en banc rehearing or Supreme Court. Either way, will be bolstered by Kav dissent.
Lot of discord in this MATS opinion. Majority clearly thinks Kavanaugh is more interested in rhetorical flourishes, than substance of law.
Majority in MATS case says Kavanaugh dissent on costs "rests on a false premise."
Largely upholds the rule - EPA's landmark rulemaking from Obama's first term.

Not "they've been hurt too badly," LA, should be "I hurt them too badly."
Maybe LA shouldn't keep referring to himself in the third person. Might make him sound more genuine.
At least he's apologizing to O'Reilly. He ruined her life.Wonder if Mike Anderson is coming next...
@MysteryPollster right...

Re. Webb, Kaine has ruled out a SEN run, but not completely. Said previously that he planned to stay on as DNC chair.
