Alexander stops short of saying he'll vote with Dems--speech was something of a warning shot at Trump, asking him to reconsider
Alexander would tip the resolution of disapproval over the edge into passage if he votes with Dems on this. Trump has threatened to veto if it passes--and his vote wouldn't be enough to override a veto https://t.co/gFHHrr1pat

@shiramstein I'm obsessed with is how partisan the press releases are--it's not totally uncommon for each side to claim a victory on some big messy thing and ignore the parts they didn't like. But most of these bills are true compromises. And the messaging from everyone is is "I WON!"

Ball is entirely in McConnell's court now when it comes to votes of any kind
Committee is adjourned. Chorus of "what" from reporters
Seems like there is lots of confusion among senators about what Flake is actually asking for and how it would be executed
Cornyn says there is still some disagreement on what the investigation will consist of.
Flake says he will only be comfortable moving forward on the floor if the FBI does more investigation than they have done already. Grassley says he will advocate for the position Flake too but he cannot guarantee it.
Grassley says it will be completely up to Schumer and McConnell on whether the FBI investigation requested by Flake and agreed to by D's will happen. Flake says that is correct
Grassley starts the vote
Flake says Dems would accept and endorse a 1-week FBI investigation limited in time and scope
Grassley tries to start the vote, Dems object.
Flake said he would advance the nomination if the investigation is agreed to. Says he's spoken with many republicans
Flake calling for a 1 week delay on floor vote to allow for an FBI investigation into the current allegations--limited 1 week investigation
Grassley allowing @JeffFlake to speak

Sasse and Tillis also haven't spoken. Grassley says the vote will happen at 1:30, those who have not spoken can speak. Whitehouse says that there's conversation happening in an ante room and suggests pushing back the vote. Grassley says they already decided on vote time.

The last person to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda was Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii who died in office in 2012. Inouye was a WWII vet who lost his arm in combat. The story is just too stunningly amazing to fit into a tweet so go watch him tell it: https://t.co/2L3hnIhHnx

Raul Labrador flatly dismisses that there was laughter or applause for Trump‚Äôs comments on Sanford. And he says it may have lost the president votes on the immigration legislation. Says Trump was there to convey that he had their backs and a different message was sent.
Meadows says at this point there are no efforts to remove the speaker. Says the speakers race will happen after Nov. 6
Meadows says he will vote for both rules today and will vote for Goodlatte.
Meadows says he‚Äôs getting more calls on family separation than in any issue in a long time.

Funny thing about all this fresh drama on immigration: GOP leaders wrote the compromise bill to conform with Trump‚Äôs four-pillar demands. It was crafted SPECIFICALLY to meet his criteria while still getting at least close to enough votes to pass.
So...house GOP leaders are preparing to vote on two immigration bills that split their party and probably can‚Äôt pass. That was the case BEFORE the president said he won‚Äôt sign one that has he best shot of passing...before an election...on an issue that Ds think they‚Äôre winning.

Whips and McCarthy are now aggressively working freedom caucus members. They‚Äôre getting verrrry close to the scheduled vote on passage of the Farm Bill. This isn‚Äôt what it looks like when leadership is sure they have the votes to pass something. But there‚Äôs still time.
Ryan just came out of the House R cloakroom. Whips and staff all huddled around deputy whip McHenry who seems to be maintaining the whip list. Freedom caucus is largely back in their typical hangout in the way back/middle of the floor.
Things are looking pretty heated on the House floor. Leaders counting votes for the Farm Bill

More Than 20 Staffers Come Forward With 'Serious Allegations' Against VA Nominee-- Update w/ comments from @SenatorTester https://t.co/n3qiTWPtvt
Re: alcohol @SenatorTester "on travel and he is the physician for the president and the previous administration. We were told stories where he was repeatedly drunk on while duty where his main job was to take care of the most powerful man in the world. That‚Äôs not acceptable.‚Äù
On rx drugs @SenatorTester says "most of them are the ones that make you want to sleep and then make you wake up. These are basically were doled out, and by the way we had 20 military and retired military folks tell us these stories these were doled out on overseas trips..."
More @SenatorTester on @npratc on Ronny Jackson Allegations "They fall into three different areas: improper dispensing of prescription drugs, repeatedly drunk while on duty while traveling and creating a toxic work environment."
As @SenJohnThune told reporters a few minutes ago "It is standard practice to do the background ahead of time before a nominee is advanced and sent up to the hill so hopefully this current example is the exception and not the rule."
I'm sure there are a number of failed nominees who would be happy to call the vetting process "disgusting" but vetting is the routine, constitutional duty of these committees. Typically a WH does their own deep background research first to try to avoid landmines in the Senate.
RT @Phil_Mattingly: Reality on Jackson nom is it's not really a Democrat/obstruction issue at this point - it's Republicans, already uneasy‚Ä¶

Ok so I think the posting order/threading got screwed up because I was sending from a phone. Whatever. You get the point. Journalism is important and what‚Äôs happening at tribune tower in Chicago sucks.
Is that silly and sentimental? Sure. Of course. But it still sucks to watch the paper that inspired me go through this. Much love and respect to the reporters who are muddling through it all. //
A physical manifestation of purpose and strength and he sheer imposing power of reporting and sharing the stories with people so they can understand the world around them. So they could participate in institutions instead of watching from afar. 6/??
Getting into journalism is hard. Making a living at it is sometimes even harder. But I saw that building and it reminded me every day that papers like that didn‚Äôt just matter in news stands, they occupied the skyline in prime view. the building is a statement 5/??
I loved the people I worked for and I am deeply grateful to this day for everything I learned in that job (including how I very much didn‚Äôt want to go to law school). But I saw trib tower every day and it nagged at my heart constantly 5/??
So if that work continues, why does a building matter? It mattered a lot for me in my early 20s when I was figuring out my life (still don‚Äôt have that all figured by any means but you get the picture). I worked in a building across the river from trig tower 4/??
I really respect the resilience of reporters who keep focused on the important work of holding powerful people accountable and just telling the stories of the real people and human lives in an enormous mass of humanity like Chicago. 3/??
I know some fabulous reporters I Chicago. And I know a lot of them have struggled for years through layoffs, cutbacks, management shifts and complete reimaginings of their journalistic missions as these shakeups keep happening. 2/??
I just keep thinking about this. And about how Chicago deserves more and better journalism, not a continued dismantling of the great papers of a great city. Yes. The trib and the valuable work of their reporters will continue in another building. 1/??

It was pretty clear for the better part of the past 24 hours that all of these immigration bills would fail. The path forward is essentially a big ??--that doesn't mean Congress couldn't decided to add a DACA fix to some other bill--maybe the omnibus spending bill next month?

RT @ericawerner: Sen Cornyn is not anticipating dedicated floor time for immigration again anytime soon. 	Maybe something on the omni.
This is not surprising---the other two bills were bipartisan and had significant D support https://t.co/QT5oSn35e6
The Trump-backed immigration bill failed 39-60. That's the lowest number of YES votes of any the four immigration bills, meaning it had the least support despite being the only one the president agreed to sign.
@brfreed while it is difficult to judge based on photos alone, my immediate response was "likely nightmare haven for overpriced beers and cocktails. Also bros."
The second bipartisan bill goes down, leaving only the WH backed grassley memo, which is not expected to have the votes to pass. If all goes as expected, that means the Senate will have failed to pass an immigration bill with just over 2 weeks to the March 5 DACA deadline

Tax reporters: a brief appreciation 1/4-- As a person who has slowly, over the past couple of years, transitioned from Tax Reporter to more of a generalist, I want to give a HUGE and proper shout out to brilliant, hard working people in the tax policy trenches on the hill.

Very Good point, though we expect more amendments today that could add to the cost. https://t.co/3X3M6h0JM3
Higher long-term cost of a tax bill won't NECESSARILY spell doom for the bill in the House. It DOES means the House bill far different from the Senate bill, more so than we already knew. That spells trouble if they ever get to conference &amp; try to get to the finish line. 2/2
