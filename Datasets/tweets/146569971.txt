@robin_luich @madonna_jerri There are many people working on development of better flu vaccines, but the changing nature of flu viruses make it a constant moving target and one of the world’s biggest public health threats.
@robin_luich @madonna_jerri There are usually three or four types of flu viruses that circulate during flu season. Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the 3 or 4 different viruses research suggests will be most common during the upcoming season.
@madonna_jerri Correct, people are unlikely to become sick with the same flu virus strain twice during the same season, as our bodies develop immunity against the virus we are infected with.

@JRCFoundation @CDC_eHealth An analysis of death certificates over 9 seasons (1990-91 to 1998-99) suggested about ~500 deaths annually classified as pneumonia or influenza-associated deaths among children aged &lt;5 years.  Not all of these were due to influenza. https://t.co/Xry9qAVIQP
@lisanne10n @CDCDirector However, we know these early estimates may change as we collect more data. More information about CDC flu VE estimates and how to interpret them is available at https://t.co/YKu7zsSzSw.
@lisanne10n @CDCDirector One reason for the difference may be that the U.S. has a bigger vaccine effectiveness network that may be able to better measure effectiveness when estimates are lower.
@lisanne10n @CDCDirector The main difference is estimated VE against H3N2 viruses. CDC found statistically significant protection against H3N2 of 25%, whereas the Canadian VE estimate against H3N2 was 17% and not statistically significant.
@lisanne10n @CDCDirector The estimates of flu vaccine effectiveness in Canada and the U.S. are not really so different. The Canadian and U.S. overall flu vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against both flu A and B are similar at 45% versus 36%, respectively.
@lisanne10n @CDCDirector Canada uses more trivalent (three-component) vaccine and the U.S. uses more quadrivalent (four component) vaccine. However, the vaccine composition this season is the same as that of U.S. trivalent vaccines.

@lisanne10n @CDCDirector From past seasons, we typically see less flu and less severe flu among vaccinated people than unvaccinated people.
@lisanne10n @CDCDirector This data is not available for adults, but among flu deaths in children reported to CDC in prior seasons, about 80 percent of children who died were not fully vaccinated against flu; that proportion is similar so far this season. https://t.co/ykisyCxmXO
@Tbeffs @CDCemergency @CDCFlu Here are more tips on caring for someone who is sick (https://t.co/WOSzUzuj0K and https://t.co/JLskUBTWQj). We wish your child a speedy recovery.
@Tbeffs @CDCemergency @CDCFlu CDC recommends that people who are at high risk of serious flu complications who develop flu symptoms contact their health care provider. Children younger than 5 years old, but especially children younger than 2 years old, are at high risk of developing serious flu complications.
@Tbeffs @CDCemergency @CDCFlu Theresa, we are sorry to hear your child is sick. CDC cannot provide medical advice for individual patients, however we suggest that you contact your child’s pediatrician or primary care provider.
@saintsuzy70 Vaccine effectiveness and the number of people who were vaccinated also can have an impact on the severity of the season. Flu vaccines also tend to work less well against H3N2 viruses than against H1N1 and influenza B viruses.
@saintsuzy70 One reason this flu season has been difficult is the most common flu virus this season is influenza A(H3N2), which is often associated with more severe illness.
@saintsuzy70 Early estimates showed flu vaccination coverage was similar to the same time last flu season for persons 6 months and older. https://t.co/ydAIAiiLtE
@DrewN1977 Our early estimates show that flu vaccination has reduced the risk of having to go to the doctor due to flu by 36% overall, so far this season. Here’s more from our latest report. https://t.co/pfcNZTQD0r
@DrewN1977 We are sorry for the delay in responding to your message, which is due to a high volume of seasonal flu inquiries.
@Ijolite_Hypatia This data is not available among adults, but among flu deaths in children reported to CDC in prior seasons, about 31% of clinical complications were associated with sepsis. https://t.co/ykisyCxmXO
@enigmagolfer Early estimates now show that overall flu vaccine effectiveness is 36% in the U.S., so far this season. The high dose vaccine is only approved by the FDA for people 65 and older. https://t.co/Im6GDylfCj
@anneboleynwins More detail about this process at https://t.co/jhEZSQ4iAd and https://t.co/GthhDbGlDi.
@anneboleynwins There are many people working on development of better flu vaccines, but the changing nature of flu viruses make it a constant moving target and one of the world’s biggest public health threats.
@anneboleynwins Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the 3 or 4 different viruses research suggests will be most common during the upcoming season. But flu viruses change frequently and unpredictably and sometimes the viruses change during the months that it takes to develop vaccine.
@anneboleynwins We are sorry for the delay in responding to your message, which is due to a high volume of seasonal flu inquiries. There are usually three or four types of flu viruses that circulate during flu season.

@Justus_Ben TB disease is treated by taking several drugs for 6 to 9 months. The length of treatment time it takes before symptoms end depends on many factors, like patient characteristics, how long the person has been sick, and the person’s response to treatment.
@nebulouswonder The BCG vaccine's ability to prevent adult forms of TB is considered rather poor. It only works about 50 percent of the time in preventing adult TB disease of the lungs.

@alienintraining An estimate for this season is not yet available, but during a similar H3N2-predominant season in 2012-2013 CDC estimates that 56,000 people in the U.S. died from flu. For a detailed explanation, please visit https://t.co/qy83bRDDy5 and https://t.co/OHYIOXtRA4.
@alienintraining CDC uses models to estimate flu deaths each season based on information including vaccination coverage and vaccine effectiveness estimates.
@alienintraining Great question. Flu deaths in adults are not nationally reportable, therefore CDC does not have an exact count of how many adults die from flu each year.
@HannahW14802103 Most people with flu have mild illness, will not need medical care or treatment, and recover in less than 2 weeks. Stay alert for these signs: https://t.co/LhxRbfsdh8
@HannahW14802103 Flu vaccine is the best available tool we have to prevent flu, but it is possible you may still get sick with flu or flu-like symptoms.
@HannahW14802103 Even though you’ve been vaccinated, it is still important to avoid close contact with people who are sick with flu and practice these other healthy habits. https://t.co/SKBm4lPcM4

@greg_black12 Continued improvements in vaccine technology are needed and CDC and partners are supporting advancements in vaccine technology. But for now, a flu vaccine is the best available preventive tool we have. https://t.co/jkRvxGudHW
@greg_black12 Some evidence suggests that if you do get sick after vaccination, your illness may be milder than it otherwise would have been. Vaccination can not only reduce your risk of getting sick, but it can also reduce your risk of being hospitalized or dying from flu.
@greg_black12 It’s possible to be exposed to #flu shortly before getting vaccinated or during the 2 week period after vaccination, before protection from the flu shot takes effect. For more possibilities, please visit: https://t.co/qYfIL6129Q.

@NJHLove93 These healthy habits can help protect you from flu. https://t.co/SKBm4lPcM4
@NJHLove93 Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose: https://t.co/DrvaOwDviY.
@NJHLove93 Flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away.
@gochico When flu vaccines and circulating flu viruses are not well matched, the use of influenza antiviral medications may be more important than usual. Visit https://t.co/YKu7zsSzSw for more on vaccine effectiveness.
@gochico CDC has been reminding clinicians and the public about the importance of prompt treatment with influenza antiviral drugs because we anticipate lower vaccine effectiveness this season.
@gochico Vaccine effectiveness (VE) data for this season will be available in mid-February. #H3N2 flu viruses have been most common this season and #flu vaccines tend to work less well against H3N2 viruses.
