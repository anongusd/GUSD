.@realDonaldTrump, this shutdown has gone on far too long. Our national parks will be a wreck if this goes on any longer. Plus, I am sure you don‚Äôt want it to go on for more than 21 days, which was the longest in ‚Äò96, and because you always bash the ‚ÄúSchumer Shutdown‚Äù ü§îüßêü§Ø

So, .@realDonaldTrump, I recall that during your campaign for president in 2016 you were saying that Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Apparently, that did not happen. So, I have to ask, what happened to that idea? And why were our tax dollars used to pay for the bill? ü§îü§îü§î
@AOC Senator Claire McCaskill is not covering for the GOP. She is being serious. For example, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is a Republican, had not been a supporter of Trump in the 2016 primaries, and had even mentioned that he still drove him crazy... this is crazy
This is very upsetting. Why can‚Äôt we all just get along for once? No matter our political affiliations. https://t.co/Cklvqd8e7E
