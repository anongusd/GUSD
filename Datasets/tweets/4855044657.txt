@Punkster1011 @patton6966 Thank you for posting. I guess we all interpret scriptures differently. I know God anoints some to preach and some to teach. The teachers I have heard teach prosperity always focus on salvation foremost and teach prosperity so that we're able to be a blessing to those in need.
@patton6966 I think I get what you mean though....that if that's all they're teaching and not salvation, that's wrong. I haven't really heard any not teaching the full gospel though but of course, I haven't heard them all.
@patton6966 Mark, I know God speaks through you and have read all your prophecies. I just wonder why you're so against prosperity teaching....God wants us to prosper. And in one of your prophecies, God calls for his millionaires and billionaires to buy out the untruthful news outlets.

The Stupidity of Ballot Harvesting and How It Steals Elections https://t.co/7F7awJrtye
@RyanRoach5 @coral_turpen @trusthistruth @StormIsUponUs I hope they ARE still investigating in other states. There were many who kept "finding" votes way after election day...and I thought ballot harvesting was only legal in California. Harvesting is one thing....filling out ballots &amp; illegally signing as a witness is illegal in Cali.
@god_high @StormIsUponUs I don't know if that's the reason he agrees with calling for another election. I took it as meaning he realizes the election could not be trusted, so needed to be redone, for the sake of the voters to have trust restored for the electoral process for that election.
@god_high @StormIsUponUs He paid for absentee ballots to be distributed (legal) &amp; that's all &amp; was assured that's all that would be done. The company he hired either collected ballots illegally with or without his knowledge. He says without. His son warned him. He either didn't believe it or ignored him.

@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan It's amazing how many times McCabe, in his interviews...and the interviewers...used the words "thought he might be, thought he may be....maybe...may...could have been"....SO incredible....and they are really careful when they say it, KNOWING there was NO evidence!
@lillysmithstee1 @mnfriedman @bobbyjoeybilly @WaysMeansCmte @SpeakerPelosi Right and there is a place on the W-4, line 6 that says "Additional amount, if any, you want withheld from each paycheck".
