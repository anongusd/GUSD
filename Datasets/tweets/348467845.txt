I'm back. Still sounding like a mix between a dying toad and Kathleen Turner...
@WGNNegovan This is true.
@WGNNegovan @WGNMorningNews And it was so much more gratifying than I imagined. He's really going to miss me.
@WGNNegovan has made the most of his spray tan. Transforming that pasty canvas into a sculpted six pack is nothing short of miraculous.
@WGNNegovan See??? Extra icing on those rolls. Fast.
@WGNNegovan is salty this morning. He doesn't know it, but he needs warrm cinnamon rolls, hot cocoa with marshmallows and a hug.
@WGNNegovan bumped my arm when I tried to type the 'a' in withdrawal. He puts the twit back in tweet.
Where are you @frankhollandwgn? @WGNNegovan is determined to make our last three days as married anchors painful. Withdrawl.  ;)
@WGNNegovan @WGNMorningNews 	I hate it when he hits me with the morning nudity. For goodness sake, I'm hardly through my coffee.
@WGNNegovan doesn't know his tea includes a couple special ingredients. He's just easier to work with when he's relaxed. ;)
@WGNNegovan has me addicted to a new hot tea elixir. I swear it's not legal in several states
