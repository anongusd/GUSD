@JohnWDean @SenBlumenthal WOW.		@SenJohnKennedy just said to @JohnWDean: as an American, I think you and your fellow co-conspirators hurt our country. You only did the right thing when you were cornered like a rat. It's hard for me to take your testimony seriously.
@JohnWDean .@SenBlumenthal calls out anonymous op-eds while questioning @JohnWDean: cases are not built on anonymous op-eds...need ppl to come forward openly
@JohnWDean Prof. Peter Shane talking about issues w/ aggressive presidentialism--ability for prez to be immune from review by Congress/judiciary
@JohnWDean Former K law clerk Prof. Jennifer Mascott: #Kavanaugh knows the impact the judiciary can have on the legal profession, the state of the law, and the lives and futures of real people
@JohnWDean back to back witnesses, prof. Adam White &amp; prof. Lisa Heinzerling both addressing #Kavanaugh on administrative agencies
@JohnWDean Prof. Rebecca Ingber: there is often a robust process and debate that accompanies major decisions...but even a robust process can lead to presidential overreach
@JohnWDean Former solicitor gen Paul Clement: #Kavanaugh recognizes that each case is the most important case for the clients and lawyers involved and treats each case accordingly
.@JohnWDean up: If #Kavanaugh confirmed We will have the most pro-presidential powers SCOTUS in the modern era...There is much to fear from an unchecked president who is inclined to abuse his powers.

Businessman Kenneth Christmas: as a lifelong Dem, it is inconvenient to support Kavnaugh. But it is the right thing to do.	As an African-American, I expect a nominee to have a deep sense of obligation to protect the interests of the disempowered. K is such a nominee
Former deputy sol. general Maureen Mahoney: Kavanaugh has demonstrated fairness...has ruled for an al Qaeda terrorist, a woman suffering from battered womens syndrome, a pro-choice democratic interest group, and against the Republican party
15-yo Hunter Lachance w/ asthma: Clean air is a life or death issue for people like me. Need SCOTUS who will protect clean air
13-yr old Jackson Corbin up w/ Noonan Syndrome: "the cost of our care is more than my family makes in a year. If ACA repealed, my parents will not be able to afford to pay. We must have justices on SCOTUS who will save the ACA."
Rebecca Taibleson: #Kavanaugh is independent, and stubbornly so. He cannot be pressured by his law clerks, and he cannot be intimidated by other actors in Government. It's not part of his process.
Former #Kavanaugh clerk Rebecca Taibleson: Process protects us from snap decisions, shortcuts, and prejudgments. that process also protects us Americans from unelected judges ruling based on their own preferences.

@ChuckGrassley @ABAesq @LindseyGrahamSC @ChrisCoons .@SenWhitehouse: did you have a chance to look @ any patterns in his decisions?		ABAw: we examined ev. decision he rendered. I did not see a pattern. If there is a pattern its in #Kavanaugh's allegiance to law, a dedication to looking @ facts...and a faithfulness to precedent
@ChuckGrassley @ABAesq @LindseyGrahamSC .@ChrisCoons: would it concern you if we considered a judge w/out taking ABA's advice?		@ABAesq: yes...our work is important/confidential/authentic...we do it on a pro bono basis. We want good courts, and we represent regular people

.@BenSasse third round of questioning on #Kavanaugh is basically just an opportunity for them to nerd out about the Constitution &amp; where rights come from.
.@BenSasse what's the core purpose of the First Amendment?		#Kavanaugh: we protect it so individuals can express their views, speech, writing...truth develops thru debate when diff perspectives are shared. A lot of ideas began as unpopular ideas
Hirono: if you did some writing that questioned some precedent, would that suffice as some notice for SCOTUS to overturn precedent		Kavanugh: factors SCOTUS considers are established...you may disagree w/ how those factors applied
Hirono: do you believe a justice should be able to make it easier to overturn precedent?		Kavanaugh: factors considered in overturning are whether precedent is deeply wrong, inconsistent w/ subsequent developments, and has bad real world effects
.@maziehirono says all it takes is 5 votes to overturn precedent. Says precedent creates predictability, stability, but said some justices want to be in position to overturn precedent (says Alito, Gorsuch)

#Kavanaugh speaking--a protester begins yelling, joined by several others. Kavanaugh falls completely silent for duration.		Afterwards, @ChuckGrassley "this is your opportunity to speak to the American people."
.@ChuckGrassley q: "would you have trouble ruling against the president/the executive branch?"		#Kavanaugh: "No one is above the law in our constitutional system."
.@ChuckGrassley opens w/ a recap of yesterday. Seconds in, protests erupt: "Our courts are broken!" "Sham president! Sham justice!"		Forecast for today: still spicy.		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing
WASHINGTON, D.C.‚Äîgood morning, it‚Äôs day 2 of the #KavanaughConfirmationHearing https://t.co/wPF0UxX9x5
Annnnd that's a wrap on Day 1.		See y'all tmr.		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Kavanaugh ends with: I am optimistic about the future of America. I am optimistic about the future of our independent judiciary. I revere the constitution. If confirmed to SCOTUS I will keep an open mind in every case...thank you Mr. Chairman.		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Update: the end is not in sight tho 5 pm is. wondering whether senators will still get their questions in or whether that will wait till Day 2
Kavanaugh gets slightly choked up while thanking his friends for support in the last few weeks		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Kavanaugh says: SCOTUS judges do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle...If confirmed to the Supreme COurt, I would be a part of a team of 9...committed to the laws of the United States.		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Kavanaugh says: I do not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences...I am a pro-law judge.		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing

@LindseyGrahamSC @HillaryClinton .@LindseyGrahamSC end of statement: "you can't lose the election &amp; pick judges. If you want to pick judges you better win."		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing

.@MikeCrapo opening statement:  "what we'll hear today is an effort to re-litigate the 2016 election....the attack is on @realDonaldTrump, not on the nominees."		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing
My fav moments of the #KavanaughConfirmationHearing so far:		-@BenSasse saying we need Schoolhouse Rock back	-the protester who said; "I'm leaving!" after an initial outburst	-the back &amp; forth about whether its possible to read 42,000 pgs overnight (aka 7,000 pages per hour)

.@ChrisCoons opening statement: asks, what is the majority &amp; @realDonaldTrump trying to hide? Cites concerns about Kavanaugh's record on LGBTQ rights, Roe v. Wade, &amp; executive authority		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing
.@SenSasse says solution is not to find judges who will be policy-makers. says solution is to restore proper system of constitutional balance of powers w/ an independent judge, not a Republican/Democratic super legislator.
.@SenSasse 4 points:		1. Legislative branch supposed 2 be center of politics	2. It's not b/c more legislative authority delegated to exec branch	3. Transfer of power means people wanting politics 2 work give that to SCOTUS	4. Need 2 restore proper duties/balance of power
.@SenSasse opening statement: "since your nomination, Judge, you've been accused of hating women, children...[being] an existential threat to our nation...This is absurd."		#KavanaughConfirmationHearing
