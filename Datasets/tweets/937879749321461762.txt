Watching the reactions of certain Dems in white attire, e.g. @RepAOC, was troubling. They are like school children who want their own way or they will pick up their toys and go home.		I wish they would go...somewhere they cannot spread socialist ideals. https://t.co/GWklj5PhQ0
@FullFrontalSamB @JacksonLeeTX18 Guess what's in our hands.		(Who knows, maybe @SpeakerPelosi's dentures?)

Um, like not a real thing.		The Founders had to make sure people like @AOC could not use political views to punish the President.

The zombies behind @staceyabrams are kind of creepy, and distracting.		"Caging children"...touching those heart strings...
@SpeakerPelosi, you look so irritated. The look is not good.		Perhaps you should stop with the facial and become stone-faced. It might look better than your weird looks and adjusting your dentures...		Just saying...
@RepAOC, I guess you are done.		@POTUS does not like the direction you would take our country.		#ByeBye
RE: SOTU		@SpeakerPelosi is way ahead on adjusting her dentures.		@AOC &amp; Co. are mostly like, "Whatever!" about most. They did like 58% of new jobs going to women.		@POTUS has not clapped hardly at all.		The bland response is coming...
@RepAOC, how sad that you are acting so immature and have a stone face for the world to see.		This will hurt you in politics in the coming months.		Pathetic!!
@IlhanMN But you are an anti-Semite.		So many Americans are confused.		You talk out of both sides of your mouth.		(And you have the "Black Power"/Black Panther fist prominently displayed.)
@SenSchumer Thanks, @SenSchumer, for spreading the great message from @POTUS about you. I had not seen your petty remarks in full and now will go throw up...maybe literally.		You need to get out of politics. Maybe 2020 will be a good year for you to retire, Sir.
@AOC As a freshwoman in Congress, this is just amazingly naïve and divisive!		Do as you will, @AlwaysOnCamera.

So the answer, according to @HillaryClinton, is to allow the killing of more babies. 		How dare those forming babies endanger mothers.		Could it be that the data is slanted?

@SenSchumer Thank you, O Wise and Fake-Looking @SenSchumer! 		I guess your fellow Americans need not view the #SOTU since you told us what to believe.

@AOC Well, to be honest, you are vastly more ignorant about basic governmental info than most thought possible.		The three branches of government are not "the Presidency, the Senate and the House."		Your extreme radicalism is edging closer to communism.		The gov is good, but not all.
@IlhanMN Not true! Most Americans are not for giving 70%+ of their money to the government so all can have more money.		This is not generosity, it is expanded welfare which keeps people in bondage and increases their dependence on the government.
Interesting how she threw "trans" into the mix. PC for sure.		She speaks with conviction, but no court would convict her of knowing too much.		#Abuse: Always wrong, never right!		@AOC is for #Abortion and nevers defends these helpless girls and boys in the womb.

@MarkYoungTruth If there is a bonafide doctor's prognosis, absolutely.		@SpeakerPelosi does seem to have the beginnings of some mental issue. At times, she makes zero sense, but how much is part of a physical problem and how much is because of her extreme politics?
@SarahKSilverman Random killing of animals, I agree.		But there are legitimate reasons.		If you believe that we are just animals on a higher plane, killing animals would seem almost wrong sometimes.		If you believe humans are special, maybe even created by God, then the picture changes a lot.
The baby just before birth, during birth and after birth is human.		The baby at conception is human.		The only thing non-human about a baby is when one is born, grows up and decides it is ok to kill another baby not fully developed, that is in-human! https://t.co/80FLByvrdK

Now isn't that precious. Bless her heart. Her life if filled with hardship. Earning $174,000 per year, and that second apartment just pushes it over the top. Maybe the government should subsidize her rent in D.C. @AOC is 29 years old. Some people need to grow up. #RealLife https://t.co/9azUrvLXTD
@AOC, there are quite a few people giving you a hard time just because you do not understand politics, economics, history, grammar, etc. Some are taking the acronym and going to town: Alexandria Occasional Cortex, Always On Camera, etc. Your ideas are dangerous. User beware.

Absolute nonsense! @AOC would have Americans taxed into oblivion for minute results. Raising the tax rate to as much as 70% to "save the planet" is foolery. She is a good dancer. She is good at getting media attention. She stinks at actionability. She stinks at truth. https://t.co/hmtk4clNK7
@AOC @CBSNews Have we devolved low enough to assume that we "need" key ethnicities or races in all walks of life regardless of ability or training? #IdentityPolitics needs to go away, permanently! @AOC, you are out of your mind if you think that you can go after liberal/lefty media and win.

@AOC Maybe it's the fact that you do not even notice glaring errors in many of your Tweets. What does "If you won't look the mirror" even mean. Look "into" the mirror works, but then "people will do it for you" is completely nonsensical. If I look into a mirror for someone, I see me.

The article is, of course, self-serving. The Press do not enjoy being pressed on anything. They have enjoyed a largely one-way street for a long time. They hold all accountable without accountability for many of their own actions. Reporters should report! #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/LQwkVC73bc

Sorry to burst any bubbles out there, but this is not only a moral issue, but an actual impossibility. You see, there was this event we know as creation and God made humans distinct and unique. There are no monkeys in my family tree! #TheTruth #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/zTb8GMKdI7
So many people hurting in this world. A walking-bridge collapse in FL ended the lives of precious humans. Prayer is in order, and seeing if this was avoidable in need of some justice. #Prayer #jayesun4uscongress

Yes, the article is quite clear. Certain politicians do not mind releasing large numbers of illegals/immigrants in our neighborhoods. Why don't any of them offer to allow some MS-13 people into schools where their children attend? #KeepingAmericaGreat #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/az5x9YFU0u
Love the @NRA commercial about certain media outlets burning their own reputations. Most Americans are smart enough to understand what the leftist media are pushing. #KeepingAmericaGreat #gunsense #jayesun4uscongress
Looks more like "conclusion" than "collusion." The investigation had more than ample time to look for smoke, which apparently was not inhaled in the end. #Collusion #KeepingAmericaGreat #jayesun4uscongress

@SteveForsberg0 @POTUS Love the picture and will respond after I read the article. #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 @AnnCoulter This certainly is true of some, but the US gives well over 400% more to charity than any other nation on earth. A broken world without borders becomes a prison. We need to maintain the tension between national health and compassionate outreaches. #Wisdom #jayesun4uscongress

@conservative22 ...John, I do want to affirm that I know that the Delegates will be the ones deciding who wins Endorsement on May 19.  No one controls them and they will hopefully do the right and proper thing.  If the Hughes campaign does not pull any "shenanigans," all's fair.

Just to be clear...my respect for any President is high, my admiration for many is sealed, my support for @POTUS Trump is real. He is human and still fallible. He has done some very amazing things and does not muck around...I like those things for sure. #jayesun4uscongress
@AnnCoulter Frustrating for all who realize what a soft border it is. The northern border is far worse, but Canadians have it pretty good. Bad country=people try to leave; good country=people stay #Immigration #jayesun4uscongress
@TimTebow @TimTebow , I am an abortion survivor and would like to tell you my story...about 10 minutes is enough time. 651.354.7749 #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 Since when is difficulty and inconvenience proper justification for failing to do the right thing?!? There is a process for sure and it may require a number of steps, but action is needed. #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 Hannity was interviewing an official out West who verified that illegals can easily get a driver's license without proper papers or birth certificate...which is the only thing necessary to register to vote.
@SteveForsberg0 I agree. If they knowingly hired illegals and have shown a pattern in their actions.
@conservative22 @LisaGreenVNL He was riding the Trump Train and will get demolished this time around. I have other info and stats I will not be sharing with you. I know people in high places and will respectfully enjoy defeating Dave. Spoke with Amanda too.
@conservative22 @LisaGreenVNL I see. Are you a Delegate voting at Thumper Pond? We only have 1/3 of the final lists so most actual Delegates are not official yet. Is there any point in trying to prove that I am far more qualified in actuality?
@SteveForsberg0 When given a gun as part and parcel of your responsibilities, there is no excuse for this lapse in judgment. People died needlessly, he could have saved some lives. No problem though, he was afraid for himself. Something to think about...
@conservative22 @LisaGreenVNL Just curious...	Are you part of his campaign team or are you thinking about who to support at Thumper Pond?
Had to get back home in time for our Daddy-Daughter number at the Ice Show. Things went off without a hitch...or fall on the ice for me. #familytime  #KeepingAmericaGreat #jayesun4uscongress
@conservative22 @LisaGreenVNL Hey, John, how well do you know Dave Hughes?
Campaigning in Silver Lake and Melrose today. Spreading a message of hope for better days in MN and the US. I met MN Sen. Torrey Westrom and gubernatorial Candidate Jeff Johnson. What a great chance to meet so many strong Republicans. #KeepingAmericaGreat #jauesun4uscongress https://t.co/VXL74IT68p
The campaign trail is long and interesting. In about 70 days, the Republicans will decide who they are endorsing. I know what the right choice will be. The other choice is not much of a choice and will be ineffectual in Congress. #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 Yes, we should confront those who knowingly employ illegals! Thankfully, it is not an either/or, but a both/and. Ultimately, if all Americans uphold the Law personally, then we would see morale rise, crime diminish, and immigration laws enforced consistently.
@SteveForsberg0 If we use an argument from authority, then most people should not speak on most issues most of the time. I do not need to splash in every mud puddle to know they are dirty. I know Greek, but that does not disqualify all opinions from people who have not studied that language.
@SteveForsberg0 Well, the 19-year old criminal was not a trained sniper and the bullet speeds are completely relative, within a fraction of a second different. Self-preservation was more important than preservation of multiple lives. Cowardice is shown most when courage is needed most.
@RubyJewelHeart @TimTebow @cchodges14 Thanks! Do you have specific suggestions?
@AGJeffBSessions spoke in CA and said, "...we intend to follow..." the Orders the @POTUS has put forth. Law &amp; Order and a lawful immigration process does good for all Americans. #KeepingAmericaGreat #jayesun4uscongress
Oh, well that's nice. People have been fired for doing less than she did. I think she could benefit from talking to Jesus more, and, who knows, maybe God will talk to her in some fashion. Maybe she should ask Jesus if He has ever talked with humans. Never mind, we have the Bible. https://t.co/c2uiHMPUKq
It's almost like reality is anything CNN does not like or approve of. There are other news media which distort reality as well, but truth will prevail. @VP is spreading a positive message with dignity. #KeepingAmericaGreat #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/PTn3zQfwYw
Yes, yes, it is. This may be a mind-blowing moment for some. But the Russians evoke darker images than those sneaking in via our southern border. I do think that even the Democrats would want a Wall if no "illegals" votes went their way. #KeepingAmericaGreat #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/4cg7FKQuux
After watching the Opening Monologue of @TheOscars, I understood later why viewership was at a record low. Virtue signaling gets old. If they want Hollywood cleaned up, they have the means. #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 Whenever a doctor needs to clean out a wound, there is pain in the process. If we are ever to get back to the place where American citizens obey the Rule of Law, parts of the process will be unpleasant. We need to be wise, sensitive &amp; bold...at the same time. #KeepingAmericaGreat
@SteveForsberg0 Not liking Trump is popular and if any person in the US watched only CNN, I would not blame him/her for disliking Trump. But no person is that powerful and not even Trump could be as horribly corrupt as Hillary Clinton has demonstrated herself to be. #KeepingAmericaGreat
@SteveForsberg0 I may not have been in uniform, but that does not discount an opinion. This is not identity politics. I was in harms way several times in the Philippines and I was in enemy territory several times (Abu Sayaf and NPA), so I know danger. Cops are given a gun for a reason. #Protect

@AnnCoulter is right, letting in illegals and then allowing them to collect government benefits is stealing from legal immigrants and citizens alike. Open borders destroys morale, is fiscally unwise, allows unaccountability, and makes a mockery of our laws. #jayesun4uscongress
Even @MSN is admitting that the record low, 26.5 million viewers, is leaving pundits scratching their heads. The "injection" of political messages and moral statements on issues was obtuse. People want to be entertained, not preached at by actors/actresses. #jayesun4uscongress

@AnnCoulter has a mind that the liberal media must envy. They have some talk show hosts and a certain comedian, but their cause could benefit from some real facts that are just reported. @BenShapiro is someone who all #Millennials should at least listen to. #jayesun4uscongress
@VP @SecondLady @NatlGovsAssoc May I suggest, Sir, that putting stickers on the outer doors of our public schools that read "This is a Gun-Free Zone" does not help the cause. #jayesun4uscongress

@SteveForsberg0 @AndrewPBrower2 The right to bare arms does not speak of knives, forks, spoons, toothpicks or nuclear weapons. It is about guns. We all understand what a gun is and so did they. #jayesun4uscongress

Democrats are alarmed; Republicans are up in arms. We will have to see what happens when the dust settles. #Memo #jayesun4uscongress
#Tolerance is not allowing everything that everyone wants, it is about living with freedom within boundaries and allowing others that same levity.  #OpenBorders cannot be tolerated because it does not respect national boundaries or common sense. #Immigration #jayesun4uscongress
@jasoninthehouse Rep. Jason, please have one of your staffers give me a call at 651.354.7749.  I want to bolster the Republican voice in the House in this mid-term election next November.   I am running in MN CD7 and want to unseat Rep. Collin Peterson.  #jayesun4uscongress
#PresidentTrump did a great job on his very first #SOTU address!  We need to support our Leader in every way possible and when our conscience is "disturbed," there is no need to impolite.  There were some who actually boycotted the event...pathetic! #jayesun4uscongress
Lord willing, when I sail into Congress next November 6, I will help #DrainTheSwamp for the good of ALL Americans. #jayesun4uscongress
The #collusiondelusion is coming to a head.  "Be sure your sin will find you out."  McCabe may have thought "all that" was behind him, but others will have their day in court as well. #truthislouder #RussianCollusion #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 Steve,  I will look into this today and get back to you soon.  Thanks, my friend, for challenging my thinking!  #jayesun4uscongress
I love, love, love Hannity's opinion yesterday that the liberal media are "impervious to facts."  Ben Shapiro rightly said in essence, "The facts do not care about your feelings." #norussiancollusion #thefactsmaam #jayesun4uscongress
Any #PathtoCitizenship should only and ever start AT THE BACK OF THE CURRENT LINE for Citizenship.  The 1.8 million immigrants number is gracious for sure and is not even remotely #Racist! #immigration #jayesun4uscongress
The only #IllegalImmigration I can support would be making concessions for those who were minors at the time they came to the US...no true choice of their own.  ALL other immigration should be cut off and not provided with citizenship.  #ImmigrationReform #jayesun4uscongress
It seems that if #PresidentTrump says something it is questioned because he said it.  Other former Presidents have essentially said the same thing and there was no backlash.  #hypocrisy #Immigration #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/4QRJv7YTMa
Tomorrow #POTUS will give the #StateOfTheUnionAddress for 2018.  We have a great nation and someone in the Oval Office who gets things done and is #DrainingTheSwamp.  All Americans should watch regardless of party affiliation.  #unity is important! #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 So what issue do you want to challenge me on next?  I look forward to your thinking!
It appears that the media is not so good at golf since they committed another #Mueller-gan. They are claiming "a bombshell," but it could likely "blow up in their face" as they club the obstruction story line to death. #jayesun4uscongress
@jasoninthehouse Jason, would love to connect with you in the near future. 651-354-7749 I am running for Congress in MN CD7. My name is #JayesunIsraelSherman. God bless you, my friend! #jayesun4uscongress
I love learning how to support MN small cities.  Of the 853 cities in MN, most are under 10,000 in population. #LMC #jayesun4uscongress
#POTUS  gave a great speech yesterday and declared America "open for business" again. #MakingAmericaGreatAgain #KeepingAmericaGreat #jayesun4uscongress
Just getting in a workout before my City Council training. Just 2.2 miles and some weights...oofta. #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/3QkkSiSVHy
#POTUS said in part, "...regulation is stealth taxation..." #awesome #MakingAmericaGreatAgain #jayesun4uscongress
Since I am Mayor pro tem in my city, training is part of what helps me do my best for City Council in #Windom. #NeverStopImproving (Thanks, Lowes!) #jayesun4uscongress
@realDonaldTrump Correct, a #SchumerShutdown was not the answer.  Playing chess when you do not fully understand a gambit is unwise. Cannot wait to join US Congress and make an important difference after being elected in MN CD7 next November.  #jayesun4uscongress
@VP Mike Pence, thank you for serving our country!  President Trump was wise to choose you!  I am an Assembly of God ordained pastor in Windom, MN, and I am seeking the Republican endorsement in MN CD7 so I can join Congress in 2018. https://t.co/CmEy3fVyMm #jayesun4uscongress
@SecondLady Karen, if you have a moment or two, feel free to check out my website at https://t.co/CmEy3fVyMm  I am a born-again Assembly of God pastor who wants to do the right thing and help America as a Congressman. #KeepAmericaStrong #jayesun4uscongress
@SecondLady Karen, thanks for being a person of influence!  Some seek it and others cannot escape it.  I have a tremendous amount of respect for your husband as well!  I felt compelled by God to enter the 2018 race for MN Congressional District 7...here I go. #jayesun4uscongress
The #GovermentShutdown was more like a #GovernmentShowdown.  The #SchumerShutdown must not happen again.  People are not pawns in a game of chess.  The military is an essential service that we can ill afford to do without. #KeepAmericaGreat #jayesun4uscongress
This #blizzard is for real in SW MN. CD7 take care! #jayesun4uscongress
I was for the Vikings over the Eagles, but it is not to be. #Vikings #jayesun4uscongress
RT @SpeakerRyan: Shutdowns cause "governmental chaos." Something we can agree on. Senator Schumer, end this and reopen the government. http…
We know who the #Vikings will face if they win. With respect... #jayesun4uscongress
@gettinnoticedmo @KamVTV @cspan When only 5 Democrats vote yes on this basic stuff, it is their fault. FYI, President Trump does not, indeed cannot, vote on anything. He can veto, but Congress can override even a veto. #governmentshutdown #jayesun4uscongress
@cspan Democrats completely! They should not be holding out for a #DACA. #jayesun4uscongress
@cspan Do the members of Congress know how to debate fairly? Fighting fair is a skill that starts in Kindergarten. #jayesun4uscongress
Am I the only American to notice that Rep. Pelosi is losing that edge needed to be a Rep? #jayesun4uscongress
It is not Republicans who are disrupting House proceedings. #SchumerShutdown #jayesun4uscongress
@KaylaKhang @POTUS @DHandyJr54 Kayla, you can make a huge difference! I am a candidate for MN Congressional District 7. My website: https://t.co/Ha3yDE6KM8 #jayesun4uscongress
#GovernmentShutdown is the complete fault of Democrats this time around. They tried to pin it on President Trump, but the American people know better! #MilitaryFirst #CHIP #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/Oy2UmsV06K
@SteveForsberg0 Yes, I agree. You are a self-professing liberal, yet you see McCain as a hero. I do too. Most liberals would not be so forthright in praising him. Glad to see it! #jayesun4uscongress #AmericanHero
RT @RepTomEmmer: Today, Americans from all over the country are in D.C. to #MarchforLife &amp; give a voice to the voiceless. I stand with them…
Yes, there is just something about facts that makes scare tactics irrelevant. #TaxCutsJobsAct  #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/NvcZM0k2p5
Democrats are supposed to represent "people power," hence the name. The moral "high ground" would be following the immigration laws already enacted.  "Sanctuary Cities" are an affront to Law &amp; Order.  A law unenforced is merely a suggestion.  #jayesun4uscongress #Immigration
What an honor to be on the front page of Cottowood County CITIZEN newspaper here in #Windom. #jayesun4uscongress #TogetherWeCan https://t.co/CRWvxohoNS
Just got done with another BPOU in Bagley, MN. #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/wmRW4PnVfV
"Never stop improving" is one of my life-mottos. I am trying to learn bass more, so I dusted my bass off...here I go. #improvingtogether https://t.co/gyfTBe1qMV
Tomorrow, my plan is to weather this weather and meet a ton of MNans in a lot of smaller towns. Can't wait...  #jayesun4uscongress
Congrats to the Vikings on a well played game...and the win! #Skol #jayesun4uscongress
Getting things prepared for my next trip through MN CD7.  Feel free to follow me on https://t.co/3PdiLqHJXq as well. #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 True enough! McCain has done much good. His family must be so proud! #jayesun4uscongress
March is quickly approaching and action must be taken on #DACA and #ImmigrationReform  #jayesun4uscongress
Just what the doctor ordered. The start of another campaign day. 	#coffeetime #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/bGfasNHGWd
The beauty around MN CD7 is amazing. Here is but one example while I was campaigning. #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/rImFSUD3OU
It has been enjoyable making contact with so many BPOUs in MN. MN Republicans can take our great ideals and do something tangible to make a difference. #jayesun4uscongress
Senator Feinstein has apparently decided to become transparent on important issues.  At least it is a dose-ier of reality. #OnlyNow #jayesun4uscongress
Today, I learned a valuable lesson. Having been in this #MNCD7 race officially about 2 weeks, some pieces are beginning to fall into place. Give me 4 more weeks and I will expose the stagnant ideas that are abounding completely! #jayesun4uscongress
@SteveForsberg0 Thanks, my friend. The other guy tried to patronize me...said I should no speak if I do not understand the question. I think I have his number now.
Spent time campaigning today. #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/ZDQLK5B7Mx
#JakeTapper has to know that he is being condescending and disrespectful as he interviewed Miller.  CNN has lost my respect completely.  I do not believe that fake news network anymore. #FakeNewsCNN #Trump #jayesun4uscongress
Fake news...it never ceases to amaze me how people can mix their own bias with facts and fail to own their opinions. #jayesun4uscongress
Just finished my first Candidate Forum in Otter Tail. #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/kEWwFQD446
@VP @POTUS Vice-President Pence, I am sooooo glad you are in your position "for such a time." I am just beginning my run for US Congress as a Republican in MN CD7. I want to unseat a long-time incumbent, Rep. Collin Peterson. #jayesun4uscongress
Things are starting to roll. My business cards came in time for my initial event on Saturday. #jayesun4uscongress https://t.co/o3pQ83MS3K
@cabauman11, just wanted you to know that there is yet another Candidate running for the MN CD7 race to unseat Rep. Collin Peterson.  That would be me. #jayesun4uscongress Check out my evolving website at https://t.co/Ha3yDE6KM8 #MNCD7
Build, not Burn.  Bridges should be built whenever and wherever possible.  If opponents want to divide, we do the right thing still. #Unity
#VoterID is simply about accountability.  Nothing to hide?  Then let's make things official. https://t.co/RimMFmJizr
The #GOPCandidateForum in Otter Tail County at Light &amp; Life Auditorium from 2-4pm is just two days away.  I am gettin up to snuff on issues and am excited to meet my soon-to-be friends.  #TogetherWeCan
#RocketMan, Kim Jung Un, was educated for a time in Europe and has traveled abroad more than the average person.  He DOES know right from wrong, but his thirst for power is really all consuming.  The more he slings mud, the more he loses ground.  #freedom
@RepTomEmmer, my name is Jayesun Israel Sherman and I am running for US Congress in MN CD7 as a Republican.  At some mutually convenient point in the near future, I would love to have a short meeting with you.  I will contact your office soon. #jayesun4uscongress
Immigration is a privilege, not a right.  Once a person goes through the naturalization process, s/he has a right to be in America and should be supported in every appropriate way. #ImmigrationReform
No people can be oppressed forever.  If true oppression is ongoing, the human spirit cannot, no, WILL NOT endure it.  Freedom is hardwired within the pinnacle of creation--humans. #IranProtests
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, the people of America love to hear kind words like yours. #myPresident
Enjoying watching my daughter practice on the ice. #familytime https://t.co/lewXTIWQFI
We have an obligation to speak for those who cannot, to help those who cannot help themselves and to be the best people we can be for a brighter future. #ProLife #charactermatters
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, thank you for doing your best!  Keep doing what you feel is right and has been approved by those who advise you.  I voted for you and will do so again the next chance I get. #TrumpforPresidentin2020
Tomorrow begins crunch time...the campaign will be a great time to connect with thousands of hardworking MNans. #jayesun4uscongress
Just the fact that I can actually close my closet door shows I am off to a great start in 2018. #FreshStart2018 https://t.co/It5UzBJScX
Happy New Year to all my family, friends, and supporters!!!! May this be our most productive and adventuresome year thus far!
Wisdom and humility are far more valuable than most other skills at one's disposal.
The fire in New York City took too many lives. No matter how many tragedies happen here or abroad, we need to keep praying and helping.  #newyorkcityblaze
President Trump is correct about #globalwarming being a waste of money.  There are highly capable and well-intentioned scientists who disagree on just about everything, including whether or not pollution affects weather on earth detrimentally.  #factsmatter
We need to focus on victories more than deficits. When Americans get to keep more money in 2018 few will complain. But life is so much more than mere "stuff."
Just a few more days until my first forum...should be a good time!
Ice-skating with my amazing daughter, Grace, and other fam. https://t.co/a4CmcSede5
@RepTomEmmer Rep. Emmer, 	Hope your Christmas was, indeed, merry! 	I am just beginning my campaign to unseat Rep. Collin Peterson. I would love to speak with you precisely about this potential. My # is 651-354-7749. Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks!	Respectfully,	Jayesun Israel Sherman
In the next few days, I will have to start fundraising for my campaign...so much to do. It will be worth all the effort and I certainly want the opportunity to serve in a bigger way, i.e. US Congress. #jayesun4uscongress
Spent a couple hours volunteering at Union Gospel Mission earlier today. What a great ministry to those who need some hope! https://t.co/iXwW3UoRrl
@krassenstein @ThyMafia @realDonaldTrump I would be interested to see what you actually understand about the stock market. Your personal feelings of malice toward the President are clouding your ability to assess on a level that rises above morasse.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I am praying for you. Have a Happy New Year weekend!
Together we can do much more than we can alone. Nothing of great importance comes without teamwork on some level.
In just a few days, 2018 will be here...a fresh start. Happy New Year!!!!
The government should save wisely, spend frugally, invest fearlessly, and give sparingly.  When we help people in the US who could help themselves, we do not help anyone. #Government
@gowdy4congress  Congressman Trey, Jayesun Israel Sherman here.  We have not met yet, but I have been watching the good stuff you have been doing.  I live in MN and am hoping to join the Republican ranks in Congress in 2018. #jayesun4uscongress
@jasoninthehouse Jason, when my family is in Washington next, we hope to meet you if you happen to be in D.C.  Also, I am hoping to unseat a Democratic Congressman (Collin Peterson) this next go-around. #jayesun4uscongress
Oh Chong Songbeen is a brave young North Korean defector!  Often we can tell how good a country is by who tries to get into it; or a bad country by who tries to get out.  North Korean leaders are demonstrating "criminal thinking errors." #NorthKorea
@madwestt  Hello, my name is Jayesun Israel Sherman and I will attempt to gain the Republican endorsement for MNs Congressional District 7 and unseat Collin Peterson in the 2018 election next November.  I will need lots of help to do this.  Feel free to call  me at 651-354-7749.
@realtimwilliams @wsdot_tacoma Such a tragic event!  The people who were involved in this accident needs our prayers and support! #Amtrak501
Concerning the tax code, I am not as concerned about whether the US has 4 vs 7 levels so much as I am concerned that taxes are lowered to the lowest amounts possible.  We can never irradicate taxes, but we sure can do a lot more to lower taxes, government spending, and much more.
The political race for Congressional District 7 is about to get more interesting...
Yes, when we remember tragic (and ultimately avoidable) events like these, we continue to honor their lives and ensure that this will not be repeated. https://t.co/hW3P8G1Xq7
Congress should be filled with those individuals who are passionate and fresh.  Some have been in the game too long and need to make room for others who can carry on the vision with new zeal.
President Trump's picturesque cutting of red tape will stick in the minds of many.  Hopefully, the President will master the art of tweeting as well.  My deep respect for the position President Trump holds demands that I do my part to be united and be a terrific team-player.
On a far different note, many in the Midwest are hoping that Aaron Rogers is back soon and for good.  #GreenBayPackers
The approx. 185,000 pages of Tax Code and associated documents is astounding!  Trimming that down substantially is not merely necessary...it is urgent.  For good citizens to contribute best, cumbersome loads must be lifted and discarded.
Senator John McCain should at least consider how much longer to serve our country.  Brain cancer is terrible and his family could benefit from some more of his presence.
Republicans and Democrats alike are vying for the attention of all Americans. We need to be mindful of all sources of "news" and make sure the facts and opinions are recognized for what they truly are. Those who sling mud lose ground.
The irony of those who would castigate President Trump for alleged Russian connections and refuse to indict Hillary Clinton for undeniable offenses (not to mention her husband) does not escape the attention of many Americans.
Ambition is not my thing, I just want to change the world.
