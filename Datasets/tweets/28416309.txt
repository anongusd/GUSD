President Trump’s shortsightedness, his advisors’ longstanding aggression towards Iran, our Gulf partners’ desire to change the regional balance of power, and even foolhardy provocations from Tehran itself are all potential pitfalls to be avoided. /end
As @SecPompeo is in Warsaw today for a conference (once meant to be focused on Iran, until U.S. allies pushed back on that agenda), this story serves as a sobering reminder:		The United States must not be drawn into another war in the Middle East
They should work to stop any program that measurably increases our chance of open conflict with Iran.
Leaders in Congress need to ensure that the appropriate oversight is being conducted over this and any other covert programs.
(which was secured by the P5+1’s agreement with Tehran, which President Trump withdrew from). https://t.co/jdyysMvQnV
U.S. security interests would be far better served by participating in international monitoring work on Iran’s nuclear program
Those same capabilities, however—and the risk of escalation that they present—are a reason to be extremely weary of the use of such covert activities.
To start, the exposure of ongoing covert programs can be problematic, especially when they are targeted against adversaries like Iran that have serious asymmetric response capabilities at their disposal.
&lt;Thread&gt; The United States has “accelerated” a covert program designed to “sabotage Iran’s missiles and rockets.” 		This raises several issues worth addressing. https://t.co/BmujFhcG9a

Ultimately, Barr will need to face thorough questioning by the entire Senate Judiciary during his confirmation hearing, and commit to concrete, Watergate-style protections for the special counsel’s investigation moving forward. 8/8
Words of assurance are insufficient in the context of a uniquely corrupt and disingenuous administration. Barr is a private citizen unaffected by the shutdown, why wouldn’t he have as many meetings with committee members, Republicans and Democrats, as possible? 7/

Diplomatic and military leaders (rather than the president, because he cannot be trusted to tell the truth) should speak before Congress to give a full accounting of both our strategic goals and withdrawal timeline in Syria.
Based on that, a troop withdrawal was welcome news. 		At this point, however, it is not clear _what_ U.S. policy in Syria is. 		The American people deserve an explanation for this twisting in the wind.
For nearly two years, the Trump Administration has been escalating U.S. military activities in Syria with no proper legal authority, plan for the political or military endgame, or regard for the human consequences.
Either the president is lying about a victory that never happened and a withdrawal that never will in order to falsely claim a political victory, or the commander-in-chief is being willfully ignored by his subordinates due to a difference of opinions.
Bolton is only the latest to contradict the president’s claims about withdrawal and ISIS. 		That leaves two possibilities (neither are good).
#2: It is increasingly unclear who in the Trump Administration sets policy and makes decisions.
The administration’s Syria policy is wrong for two key reasons: 		#1: The abrupt troop withdrawal has already produced irreversible consequences: Mattis and Special Envoy Brett McGurk already resigned.
For those keeping score, that directly contradicts his message less than a month ago that “they’re all coming back and they’re coming back now” because ISIS was fully defeated. https://t.co/5wrfVyiIBd
The commander-in-chief, on the same day, said: 		“I never said we’re doing [a full troop withdrawal] quickly”	 https://t.co/I8pWUYXLZj
John Bolton suggested there were “conditions” for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which President Trump had previously characterized as immediate.		That’s problematic. Here’s why. https://t.co/9lyVBskxxZ

Democrats who are coming to power  this year have an urgent responsibility to make up for a deficit in accountability to date.

And finally, Mueller’s investigation remains in full swing. 		With Trump threatening Mueller and his team, @senatemajldr must bring the bipartisan legislation protecting the special counsel from a politically motivated firing to the floor.
Trump has undermined the world’s fight against climate change at every opportunity—withdrawing from Paris, rolling back rules restricting carbon emissions, etc—despite the danger to American lives. 		State and local leaders are picking up the slack and need our support now.
The US should be leading the world in a time of crisis—not rejecting those seeking asylum or ripping apart families. 		Congress must secure oversight of family reunifications and a DACA fix, and urge Trump to end the military deployment at the border.
Trump made the wrong decision when withdrawing from the Iran Deal and reimposing sanctions— Tehran was in compliance. 		In the year ahead, the Trump Admin must not be drawn into another war in the Middle East due to their aggression towards Iran or the president’s idiocy.
Verifiable, phased denuclearization is the end goal in North Korea. 		Given his susceptibility to flattery and lack of knowledge on nuclear policy, Trump should not meet one-on-one with Kim again; instead, technical experts and diplomats should be the ones in the room.
Russia interfered in both our 2016 presidential election and 2018 midterms, yet Trump keeps cozying up to Putin—look no further than his shameful performance betraying the intel community in Helsinki. 		Moscow is no friend to the United States.
The United States confronted many challenges in 2018. Time and again, the Trump Administration failed to meet those challenges, sacrificing U.S. leadership and values along the way. 		Here’s where we stand.

He should allow a vote in the full Senate so that the American people can be confident in the knowledge that everything possible is being done to determine the true extent of foreign interference in our democracy.
Considering the president’s demonstrated hostility towards this kind of evidence, Mitch McConnell should stop blocking the bipartisan legislation protecting the special counsel.
Meanwhile, the report says, ‘The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract, and ultimately discourage members from voting.
The report states that these posts were made to ‘benefit the Republican Party — and specifically Donald Trump.',
(The same agency that has since been charged for interference in our election by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.)
This report is the first to study the millions of posts on Facebook, Twitter, and Google over the course of several years, up to mid-2017, that were connected to the Internet Research Agency.

A failure by the Acting AG and the White House to make such a commitment will be interpreted as a hostile act against the notion of independent oversight, and the American people will respond accordingly.
Whitaker cannot be allowed to control the ongoing investigation; he must recuse himself from this issue and commit to stringent protections for the special counsel and his work.
Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker is an unacceptable choice to oversee the special counsel’s investigation, at the bare minimum due to his publicly expressed hostility towards Mueller and his work.
Jeff Sessions’ recusal safeguarded Mueller’s investigation. 		That work must continue.

With rumors of Jeff Sessions’ replacement persisting, it will be critical that leaders in Congress demand any new AG commit to significant protections for Special Counsel Mueller and his work immediately. https://t.co/bBItFS43hC
Of particular concern is the continuation of the special counsel’s investigation:
Given the president’s unpredictable nature and thin skin, we must be prepared in the coming days and months for him to lash out as he is reminded of the constraints of his office.
The new Congress will have a critical responsibility to reassert itself as a coequal branch of government.
Or attacked the notion of independent oversight of his actions https://t.co/Qc47wzS7FX
Governed with a spiteful xenophobia that does nothing to secure our homeland;
Rolled back policies that were designed to make ours a safer, more just nation
Time and again, the president’s Republican enablers have stayed silent or made only performative gestures when he failed to represent American values on the world stage;
Voters have sent an unmistakably clear message: 		It is time for Congress to hold the Trump Administration accountable.

the INF treaty should be expanded by technical experts and professional negotiators rather than thrown out hastily by idealogues like Bolton.
Russia has been in violation of the treaty since 2014, but it is a cornerstone piece of the arms control regime that ended the Cold War and prevents a modern nuclear arms race;
Instead of playing to an audience of one, Bolton should be working with Russia to preserve the INF Treaty, which he is pushing President Trump to abandon.
It will make him look little more than naive and weak to Moscow.

A successful nominee for this post will embody the values of liberal internationalism, including ironclad beliefs in diplomacy first, international development, and a true, cooperative multilateralism.
The United Nations is an imperfect institution, but the United States should be leading the way in making it more effective—not hamstringing its budget and attacking its legitimacy.
The next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations must serve as a check on President Trump, not as his puppet.
She also played a key role in pushing for increased tensions, if not outright conflict, with Iran.
She indulged in untoward Trumpian bullying of our allies and partners, gleefully slashed development funding, and supported U.S. withdrawal from different pieces of the U.N. infrastructure.
Nikki Haley’s tenure at the United Nations was a mixed bag. 		She was verbally tougher on many of America’s adversaries—particularly Russia—than the president, but ultimately, she was a representative of President Trump through and through.

Trump's attacks on Sessions—such as his latest claim, “I don’t have an attorney general”—clearly show his desire to see the Mueller investigation ended by firing Sessions and appointing a new attorney general who would then shutter the special counsel.

President Trump’s foolhardy tactics against China over trade ultimately only hinder negotiations to resolve differences and cause American consumers to bear the brunt of the cost of the tariffs.

It remains to be seen exactly what “corresponding measures” the United States is expected to take, or who will deliver those terms to the Trump Administration.

In the midst of the largest refugee crisis since World War II, our leadership must not be held hostage by small-minded xenophobia.
When we turn away those fleeing horrific violence, we indulge the narratives of the extremists causing their suffering: that their choices are to submit to extremist rule or die. America must offer a third choice of safety, opportunity, and diversity.
Accepting refugees is the right thing to do, and it makes our country stronger.
Refugees pose virtually no security risk to the United States, and the administration has shown no data to the contrary. https://t.co/CM9Bte6lu2
...despite the fact that no refugee has been involved in any terrorist attack since the Refugee Act of 1980 established our vetting processes and that refugees are reported to be beneficial to the American economy.
Furthermore, Pompeo claimed this decision was made in light of U.S. national security interests...
Secretary Pompeo has falsely created a link between the vetting processes for refugees and asylum seekers, when, in fact, these two groups are processed entirely differently.
For this year, the Trump Administration set the historically low cap of 45,000—but only 20,918 have been admitted thus far—and now they have set it even lower for next year.
President Trump’s cruel refusal to allow entry to those fleeing war and humanitarian crises represents an abdication of American values and a failure of American leadership. https://t.co/gFF5PcQVqS

The facts here are clear: President Trump’s anger at the special counsel grows every day, and Republican leaders have said that Special Counsel Mueller should not be fired. This is an easy, bipartisan step towards preventing that outcome. 4/

Today's thread is long, but here's the BLUF: Secretary Pompeo’s certification on Yemen yesterday is simply not enough. The United States must not continue to fund and support the cause of such human suffering. Read more ↓↓↓ https://t.co/HnKYudf0gD
Ultimately, Secretary Pompeo’s certification is simply not enough: The United States must not continue to fund and support the cause of such human suffering. 12/12
...as well as by conducting a serious review of the practices and goals of partner nations like Saudi Arabia. 11/
Moreover, leaders in Congress should reassess our involvement in the region through serious, public debate about replacing our overly expansive and outdated 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs)... 10/
Options to do so include (but are not limited to): briefings on the devastation, hearings on U.S. involvement to date, and further legislative efforts to defund operational support or oppose the authorization of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other participating parties. 9/
Leaders in Congress must act now to reduce U.S. involvement and sponsorship of Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. 9/
Supporting this policy and its resultant human misery is not only wrong, but ineffective counterterrorism policy as well; the conditions Saudi Arabia is fomenting will contribute to more extremism, not less. 8/

There is no evidence, however, that the secretary’s claim about Saudi Arabia and the UAE is accurate. The war in Yemen is not only illegal by international law, but rendering plainly immoral consequences. 4/
By way of background, members of Congress inserted a provision in the NDAA requiring Secretary Pompeo to make this certification to Congress because of increasing, bipartisan concern about the brutality of and human suffering inflicted by Saudi Arabia’s war against Yemen. 3/
You can find the full text of the secretary's statement here: https://t.co/8Edh1KFLQW 2/

And finally, all of these increasingly powerful storms are a sobering reminder of the threat that climate change poses to our security and resilience. 8/8
In addition, the administration should be preparing for Hurricane Florence as it heads towards the Carolinas and Virginia this week with “life-threatening” storm surges and flooding, which the president described as "tremendously big" and "tremendously wet." 7/
The Trump Administration failed to help the people of Puerto Rico in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria and every day since. We must continue to send any aid and resources required to protect the island in the current hurricane season. 6/
Therefore, rather than continuing to falsely claim a “success” in Puerto Rico—or transferring nearly $10 million of FEMA’s budget meant for disaster response, recovery, and preparedness to ICE—the administration should work quickly to right at least this wrong. 5/
FEMA has received 2,431 applications but approved only 75, because a certificate attributing the death to the hurricane is required. The Trump Administration’s disastrously slow response led to the first inaccurate toll, which is now depriving families of assistance they need. 4/
Last month, Puerto Rico raised the official death toll from Hurricane Maria from 64 to 2,975; each death, however, was not individually reviewed over the course of the independent study those numbers came from, so individual death certificates were not reviewed or updated. 3/
.@realDonaldTrump, meanwhile, claimed that “I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,” and “I actually think it is one of the best jobs that’s ever been done with respect to what this is all about.” https://t.co/pjITsJBOAx 2/

Flattery and friendship between @realDonaldTrump and Kim are no substitute for defining what exactly denuclearization means and establishing a rigorous verification regime to ensure North Korea's compliance moving forward. 8/8
Instead, in coordination with smart, targeted sanctions and the hard work of negotiators from South Korea, technical experts and professionals with actual experience in statecraft should work to determine the basis for a serious nuclear agreement. 7/
Given his inability to correctly interpret events on the Korean Peninsula, the president clearly cannot handle the necessary negotiations concerning denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. 6/
In other words, @realDonaldTrump's boasts that Pyongyang is ‘no longer a nuclear threat’ or that there is unprecedented progress in slowing their nuclear program are false. 5/

We should be leading by example and debunking extremist narratives, not reinforcing them. Fear-mongering on this and other areas of immigration policy does not make us safer, no matter what the administration says. #RefugeesWelcome 6/6
The Trump Administration needs to stop trying to demonize refugees and start living up to our historic leadership role in welcoming those who are fleeing extreme violence and seeking a better life for their children. 5/
This politicization of intelligence—including the manipulation of data to claim a threat where there isn’t one, and changing policies on the baseless claim that it is in our national security interest to do so—is highly unprofessional and entirely unacceptable. 4/
Moreover, the administration has done this before: HHS previously suppressed a report showing the positive effects of refugees on the U.S. economy. https://t.co/UkyXWjBf9e 3/

There needs to be a thorough examination into all of the assertions made by Cohen concerning President Trump immediately.
These payments, and the clear effort to cover them up, challenge the credibility and stability of the President of the United States, as well as make him potentially vulnerable as a security risk.
With Cohen’s guilty plea on Tuesday, legal experts agree that President Trump has been implicated in—and in fact, allegedly directed—a serious crime. https://t.co/s8soWbuIoY
Also, the fact that these payments came from Trump forms the basis for a potential campaign finance violation as the payments were made in the interest of not harming his presidential campaign.
And the audio recording of the president discussing the payments with Cohen ultimately contradicts any claim that he was unaware.
However, President Trump’s past false statements about the payments, as well as those by his communications staff, are well-documented. https://t.co/M6gUy4x483

In light of today’s news, leaders in Congress should move quickly to pass existing, bipartisan legislation to protect the special counsel and his work from a politically-motivated firing.
At the end of the day, all investigations into potential misdeeds by the Trump orbit—including the president himself—must be allowed to continue without impediment.
Today’s show of bipartisan unity by Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) and Ranking Member Mark Warner (D-VA) drives home the need for a thorough examination.
Meanwhile, Michael Cohen’s guilty plea raises serious questions about illegal actions allegedly directed by President Trump.

Revoking Brennan’s security clearance as retribution for legal political speech against the president is an unprecedented and petty use of executive power.

Assuming Russia will not comply, leaders in Congress should watch for this action from the administration while also pushing for other means to hold Moscow (and President Trump) accountable.

Change must come within Iran—it cannot be produced by an artificial revolution, and it must not be attempted by outside forces, which could well lead to another costly and destructive war in the Middle East.
Meanwhile, the administration should refrain from flirting with the idea of regime change in Tehran.
Instead of using tough, American-led diplomacy, the United States is going it alone while our allies and partners uphold the deal to ensure that limits and monitoring remain in place on the Iranian nuclear program.

Instead of reupping their declarations of success, the administration should establish a serious nuclear agreement with North Korea.

Congress must therefore check @realDonaldTrump by passing @LindseyGrahamSC and @SenatorMenendez's bill to strengthen existing sanctions against Russia, require congressional approval for withdrawing from NATO, and impose additional sanctions on Putin’s private-sector cronies. 9/9
Though Sec. Pompeo wisely refused to recognize Russia's seizure of Crimea and insisted the president understands the threat from Moscow and supports our intelligence community, his words mean little if they are not backed up by @realDonaldTrump’s own words and actions. 8/
And finally, he also admitted that North Korea has continued producing nuclear fuel for its weapons program, which contradicts the president’s insistence that Pyongyang is making good on the promises from Singapore. 7/
Sec. Pompeo also tried to rewrite history and cast the White House as supportive of Russian sanctions only forced through by an overwhelming bipartisan congressional vote. https://t.co/lLpfeh0fvm 6/
Beginning his testimony shortly after the announcement that Putin’s  U.S. visit will take place next year ‘after the Russia witch hunt it is over,’ Sec. Pompeo refused to answer what Trump and Putin agreed to in Helsinki, arguing, ‘Presidents are entitled to private meetings.’ 5/

Meanwhile, the Trump Administration needs to clarify how its new sanctions plan will not harm the Iranian people more than the regime, as well as avoid inflicting economic ‘friendly fire’ on our closest allies (many of whom are already antagonized by threats of trade wars). 10/10
Leaders in Congress must unequivocally reject any push by this administration to use military force to achieve political goals in Iran, which would amount to another incredibly costly conflict in the Middle East in the name of regime change and nuclear nonproliferation. 9/
The regime in Iran needs to change for the betterment of Iran’s people, but that change must come from within— it cannot be produced by an artificial revolution, and it must not be attempted by disastrous regime change. 8/
.@realDonaldTrump, meanwhile, appears little more than petulant and unhinged with his Twitter performance. 7/
Ultimately, the core of Secretary Pompeo’s strategy —the reimposition of banking and financial sanctions—comes at the cost of U.S. participation in the nuclear agreement, which continues to successfully keep the most dangerous weapons out of Tehran’s hands. 6/
The United States, however, faces an uphill battle here—both with our allies and partners, who the Trump Administration recently broke an international agreement with, and the Iranian people, who are incredibly skeptical of American efforts to influence their politics. 5/
To be sure, Secretary Pompeo was right to denounce the repressive nature, human rights abuses, and corruption of the regime in Tehran. 4/
Meanwhile, @realDonaldTrump threatened Iran in ALLCAPS on Twitter last night. 3/  https://t.co/agVTDldzhW

Additionally, the Senate should continue to serve as an example by passing bipartisan legislation to protect Mueller from a politically-motivated firing.
Now, they need to take further oversight steps to ensure that the Trump Administration is working against Russian interference in 2018, 2020, and beyond.
SSCI has set a strong example of how protecting our elections from foreign involvement should be in the bipartisan national security interests of all Americans.
It also contradicts many of the claims made by House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Republicans, including that the Steele Dossier had nothing to do with the intelligence community’s previous judgement.
Russia did interfere in our election, and they did it to help Trump win.

In order to allow this, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must bring bipartisan legislation to protect the special counsel’s investigation to the Senate floor for a vote.
Despite Congressman Trey Gowdy’s demand for Rosenstein to “finish [the Mueller investigation] the hell up,” it is important that the special counsel carry out and then conclude its work appropriately, without political interference.
Rosenstein and Wray repeatedly confirmed that political bias did not affect any work within the Justice Department and that they are following proper protocol in releasing any requested documents. https://t.co/vmatFu5Hr9
During which is was again made clear that political bias was not at work in either the Clinton investigation or the special counsel.
A subject of that report, FBI agent Peter Strzok, stood before the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees for 11 hours on Wednesday. https://t.co/YddIqXEWv9
Republicans also returned to the subject of the IG report released the other week, claiming it discredits the Mueller investigation when it rather concludes that political bias did not influence the Clinton investigation. https://t.co/EHMKIQRE8C
The House’s resolution demanding the Justice Department hand over documents by 06 July, therefore, does nothing but malign the work of career officials.
During the hearing, Republicans accused Rosenstein of purposefully withholding documents about the Clinton email investigation and the Russia investigation—when in fact, thousands of pages of documents have already been released and more are expected.
While the hearing was underway, the House voted to demand the DOJ to turn over all documents requested by House Republicans concerning the Russia investigation and Clinton email investigation. https://t.co/EMTt6nA02o

Her ability to lead DHS is dependent on her credibility in communicating information about safety and security to the American people, and she has destroyed that credibility in service of the president.
And finally, because she spent two days insisting that there was no family separation policy and that “Congress alone” could fix the problem, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen should resign;
Leaders in Congress should oppose both bills, as well as denounce President Trump’s latest executive order and his increasingly dangerous rhetoric about immigrants.
Both include hardline provisions (like baseless attacks on the Diversity Visa Lottery) and funding for the ineffective and wasteful border wall.
Congress will (might?) vote today on two immigration bills; neither provides a clear and simple path for DACA recipients to recover from the Trump Administration’s recission of the program.
The conflicting statements by officials today only underscore the confusion around all of this.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should stop hiding and put forth for a vote the Senate Judiciary Committee’s bipartisan legislation to protect the special counsel’s investigation.
There is absolutely no connection between the players in this story and the Mueller investigation, yet President Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani demanded yesterday that “tomorrow, Mueller should be suspended and honest people should be brought in.”
As was obvious they would from the start, the Trump Administration and its allies are using the IG report to attack the notion of oversight even beyond the Department of Justice and the FBI.
But critically, it must be said that nothing in this report changes the fact that President Trump already admitted on live television that he fired former FBI Director James Comey because of “this Russia thing." 		https://t.co/h5wKiR9FKc
Any hypothetical efforts to undermine him (none of which, to be clear, emerged in this report) were moot.
While Republicans and some in the media rave over the text messages of a couple of individual FBI agents, the obvious fact remains that President Trump won and is now in office.
The IG report’s core conclusion is that political bias did not impact the ending of the Clinton email investigation.
As the President tweets lies in a rage, it’s important to remember what yesterday’s report actually says.

it has been more than 30 days since Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance that bill.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must allow legislation to protect the special counsel to come to the Senate floor;
In light of these continued attacks (as well as President Trump’s ire at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom he reportedly asked to un-recuse himself from the investigation)...
we need to understand the scope and strategy of Russian election interference in 2016 so that we can prevent it from happening again in 2018, 2020, and beyond.
It bears repeating that Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation is an exercise in the bipartisan national security interest of the United States;
It’s a dangerous conspiracy theory to make up even by the president’s standards, and it could lead to authoritarian-style claims of illegitimate results come this November.
Without a shred of evidence, he is claiming that a legal and necessary oversight investigation headed by a credentialed and respected public figure is planning to illegally interfere the 2018 election.
President Trump routinely lies about elections. This, however, is a step further. https://t.co/fuNLb0iyhA

And, as has been the case for months, the United States needs a qualified, career professional ambassador to South Korea and a fully staffed State Department that advocates for the use of diplomacy.
And that members of Congress pass legislation that explicitly requires an Authorization for the Use of Military Force before any supposedly preemptive or preventive nuclear strike.
It is critical now that the White House not lapse back “fire and fury” rhetoric.
Diplomacy must always be America’s first, best option for resolving any international conflict.
His true nature has always been one inclined to impulse and combativeness, and now we must work to ensure that his words and actions do not accidentally or deliberately escalate in a devastating conflict that he clearly cannot comprehend.
Setting aside the utter embarrassment of this letter, it is now clear that grandiose declarations about President Trump as a historic peacemaking president were premature. https://t.co/HWoIXHPm8c

And congressional leaders should simultaneously encourage McConnell to bring the bipartisan legislation to protect the special counsel previously passed by the Judiciary Committee to the floor for a vote.
Critically, this upcoming meeting should not impede Mueller’s investigation.
Regardless, it is of utmost importance that those who do ultimately view these documents prioritize U.S. national security above party politics.
The details of the meeting Kelly will set up—such as what documents will be viewed, which congressional leaders will view the documents, and where the meeting will take place—remain unknown, though it is likely to take place before week’s end.

As for the vice president’s remarks, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said it best: 		‘That's not Vice President Mike Pence's decision to make.’”
He appears to be de-escalating this latest manufactured crisis now—possibly because officials have shown him that releasing the information that he wants made public would damage information-sharing arrangements with our allies abroad.
Chairman Nunes in particular has been very eager to prove that the DOJ, FBI, and other institutions have acted somehow improperly in the course of the special counsel’s investigation, but he’s come up short of any proof every time.

Is it proper for him to be doing the duties of a Secretary of State far before his confirmation?
What sort of oversight did these conversations have?
Serious diplomacy is always preferable to threats of regime change or fire and fury, but this raises some significant questions. https://t.co/gb8EmduYxF

More broadly, as Bolton enters his new role in a time of crisis on multiple fronts, leaders in Congress must demand that the Trump Administration seek solutions not by rushing to military force but by leveraging all the tools of national power.
Leaders in Congress need to be vigilant against any manufactured conflict with Iran in particular, given Bolton’s longstanding advocacy for war with Iran and Iran hawk CIA Director Mike Pompeo having his confirmation hearing for the post of Secretary of State later this week.
He will now serve a president desperately lacking in impulse control, judgment, and national security experience.

An inane vanity project that he has promised time and time again will be paid for by Mexico, not American taxpayers.
And leaders in Congress should be wary of this rhetoric and plan if it is an effort to somehow reorient the military into paying for President Trump’s foolish border wall.
The WH should clarify because the government of Mexico has requested as much. https://t.co/TpEtQcYUbF
It remains to be seen if there is an actual plan for this deployment, or if the president was once more simply making things up as he went.
Even if it was, any such plans will still need to be assessed in the context of his demonization of immigrants, tensions with Mexico, and tendency to ignore legal precedents and restrictions.
While previous presidents have mobilized the National Guard for border defense, the WH has not clarified if that was what the President intended to communicate,
The U.S. military has too many critical missions around the world for deploying indefinitely along a 1,954 mile border to be an efficient or strategic use of people, funding, and material resources.
U.S. military personnel are trained warfighters, not law enforcement or border control officers. 		Trump’s plan to use our armed forces to guard the southern border is a bad one.

Finally, Congress needs to reassert its authority as a coequal branch of government by debating the appropriate scope, scale, and duration of a new AUMF that addresses current threats and is aligned with our strategic objectives.
Briefings on the devastation wrought by the conflict.		Hearings on U.S. involvement to date.		Legislative efforts to either defund operational support or oppose the Trump Administration’s authorization of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other countries participating in the war.
Congress should take serious steps to curtail U.S. involvement and sponsorship of Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, including but not limited to:
Leaders in Congress should reassess our involvement in the region first and foremost through serious, public debate about replacing our overly expansive and outdated 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs).
The United States must not be complicit in furthering this conflict.
The conditions Saudi Arabia is fomenting will contribute to more extremism, not less.
Supporting this policy and its resultant human misery is not only wrong, but ineffective counterterrorism policy as well.
Civilians are being deliberately targeted, and the resultant famine, disease, and death are affecting millions of innocent men, women, and children.
Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen is not only illegal by international law, but rendering plainly immoral consequences.

@StateDept Finally, we remain gravely concerned about the Trump Administration’s continued degradation of the U.S. Department of State, as well as the continuing departures of qualified diplomatic personnel from our civil service.
@StateDept Based on his public record thus far, however, there is cause for serious skepticism about his appropriateness for the role.
@StateDept We intend to follow the lead-up to his confirmation closely--he must face responsible, serious questions on Russia, North Korea, Iran, and other topics integral to U.S. national security.
@StateDept His track record thus far indicates he will be of little help in containing the president's basest instincts for boorish and dangerous behavior on the world stage—indeed, he seems likely to exacerbate them.
@StateDept As for Director Pompeo, let us be clear:		He has no requisite experience for the position of Secretary of State.
@StateDept Given that the Trump Administration says he was fired on Friday, perhaps that is why he felt he could break with the president and stand with the UK last night in condemning Moscow for the poisoning of Sergey and Yulia Skripal.
@StateDept He did, however, speak out against Vladimir Putin’s Russia in an administration otherwise incapable of doing so.
Rex Tillerson often failed to represent the values of the United States on the world stage. 		He was often slow to react, questioned our most critical alliances and international institutions, and did serious damage in his budgetary cuts to and mismanagement of @StateDept.
Rex Tillerson often failed to represent American values, but Mike Pompeo could be worse. 		Our statement: https://t.co/eW20eSNhcX https://t.co/f0bNFpf7kn

More critically, without the #IranDeal in place, Iran will have no limits or inspections on its nuclear program—leaving us in the dark about their capabilities and setting us on course for another devastating war in the Middle East.  5/5
The #IranDeal does not need to be ‘fixed’ because it is working to keep us safe from an Iranian nuclear weapon. If we break our word, we will tarnish our diplomatic credibility--leaving us unable to rally our partners to impose sanctions if Iran does commit a violation.  4/
Moreover, this is exactly the kind of message he shouldn’t be sending about America’s willingness to stick to our commitments if he truly is going to sit down and attempt to reach a nuclear deal with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. 3/
The White House has not commented on this particular story, but President Trump has made a habit of threatening the #IranDeal--despite having no alternative plan to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 2/

He needs the support of career professionals—such as a qualified Ambassador to South Korea—with serious expertise in diplomacy and real experience in negotiation.
In order to ensure a real solution on the Korean Peninsula, President Trump must be even-keeled, well-informed, and absolutely firm in his positions on behalf of the United States.
Pursuing denuclearization through serious and robust diplomatic efforts remains the best course forward.
Furthermore, the Kim regime will likely employ every trick in the book—including flattery, inconsistency, and deception—to gain an advantage over the United States in terms of policy concessions or optics on the world stage.

4/4  Leaders in Congress must assert their constitutional authority and demand an open debate regarding the military strategy, political endgame, or legal justifications for conflict with Assad's regime and our presence in Syria.
3/ The increasing irrelevance of the United States due to @realDonaldTrump's weak leadership is obvious when all this happens in a region where our men and women in uniform are deployed but the White House’s only response is to issue a statement 24 hours after the fact.
2/ The Trump Administration deployed additional U.S. troops to Syria (absent the contours of a wider strategy, solid legal justification, or robust congressional debate) knowing that the conflict is prone to messy, escalatory situations like this one.
1/ On Saturday morning, an Iranian drone entered Israeli territory from Syria; in response, Israel launched eight F-16s to strike around Palmyra. Syrian anti-aircraft missiles subsequently shot down one plane, though Israel recovered both pilots.  https://t.co/N2YbDQaHLr

9/9 And to top it all off, @realDonaldTrump, who campaigned by harshly criticizing past information security practices, should be ashamed of all this flagrant hypocrisy.
8/ Porter should never have made it past initial interviews (let alone been given the benefit of cover by Kelly), and Kushner should have his temporary clearance revoked and permanent clearance denied. This process needs to be taken seriously.
7/ The emerging narrative of the White House's lengths to provide cover for Porter is obviously and egregiously immoral. But the Trump Administration's persistent disregard for the concept of security clearances is a national security concern, too.

5/ Minority Leader @NancyPelosi made it clear in her historic speech yesterday that House Democrats expect Speaker Paul Ryan to allow a vote on DACA if he wants Democratic support on this budget deal --&gt; https://t.co/cGSU36m6wU #GoNancyGo
4/ What this bill does not do, however, is address the larger immigration impasse—specifically, a fix for DREAMers, whose futures the Trump Administration threw into legal limbo by abruptly rescinding #DACA last year.
3/ Being a strong and resilient country means funding more than just the Pentagon budget, and this compromise at least partly recognizes that.
2/ There are many smart choices for our national security in this package: the removal of the defense sequester in general, of course, but also funding for the VA, disaster relief, the National Institutes of Health, and infrastructure development.
1/ Today, lawmakers are expected to vote on a spending package, reached by bipartisan Senate leaders, that will fund the government for two years and lift spending caps imposed by the sequester.	 https://t.co/n086gblIfK

President Trump’s enablers in the White House as well as leaders in Congress should work to stop the plans for the military parade from moving forward. 6/
Rather than proving who has the bigger button, President Trump would be casting himself into a similar role to the parade-loving North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. 5/
Clearly, this bizarre proposal would be nothing more than an exercise to stroke the president’s fragile, insecure ego. 4/
The expense of shipping tanks and hardware is also very steep, ensuring that the process would be excessive and wasteful. 3/

And we should all be concerned about @realDonaldTrump's eagerness to impugn law enforcement and notions of independent oversight throughout this charade, because it is part of a much wider troubling pattern in his presidency. 8/8
HPSCI Chair @DevinNunes, who said he recused himself from these matters a year ago for his botched efforts to bolster President Trump’s false “wiretap” claims, should also be removed from his chairmanship for acting in an unabashedly partisan way. 7/x
An accompanying memo, composed by the minority on HPSCI, should be released today to provide additional context and explanation—an obvious choice if the majority really cares about getting all the facts to the American people. 6/x
Even its cherry-picked facts undermine the lines that admin allies are pushing: the Russia investigation is based on the Steele dossier (it isn’t) and that former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page was targeted for his involvement with Trump (he was flagged much earlier). 5/x
That might have something to do with the fact that the memo is little more than a transparent effort to muddy the waters of the ongoing important investigation into the Trump orbit’s relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. 4/x

In general, they should defer to experienced career experts—and stick with coordinated economic pressure rather than an illegal, preemptive military strike that could lead to a rapidly escalating war.

Our statement on the #SOTU: https://t.co/qfttOoiKxp
One mention of Russia, as a ‘rival.’ No mention Russia’s interference in our election...or the Russian sanctions that @realdonaldtrump was supposed to implement today. #SOTU
For the big finish, one step towards ‘national unity’ would be an apology for saying there were ‘very fine people’ on the side of the white supremacists who killed Heather Heyer in Charlottesville. #SOTU
Economic pressure and coordinated diplomacy are the way forward to deal with North Korea. Threats, bluster, and childish namecalling are not. #SOTU
Any so-called “bloody nose” preemptive attack on North Korea would have deadly consequences for thousands of American troops and millions of South Korean and Japanese civilians. #SOTU
This rhetoric may sound measured, but @realdonaldtrump’s Twitter “diplomacy” is anything but. #SOTU
Russia sanctions passed Congress 419-3. Why weren’t they mentioned in the #SOTU along with Cuba and Venezuelan sanctions?
Military and diplomatic leaders around the world and within @realdonaldtrump’s own administration agree: The #IranDeal is working. #SOTU
If @realdonaldtrump derails the #IranDeal, he will alienate our allies, make further international sanctions less likely, and leave Tehran without nuclear limits or inspectors. #SOTU
The #IranDeal is preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon. #SOTU
Iranian citizens protesting for their freedom deserve the praise of the United States. Russian protesters deserve the same. #SOTU
The Trump Administration has not yet articulated a strategy or end state for the war in Afghanistan, despite planning to send a thousand more U.S. troops there. #SOTU

As we await President Trump’s decision, Rep. Nunes should be removed from his position as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 8/

Carter Page was suspected of working as a Russian agent well before the Trump campaign. 6/
Furthermore, from what we know about the memo at this time, it seems that all Rep. Nunes ‘discovered’ is that there was a viable reason to surveil former Trump campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page. 5/

Demonizing immigrants and wasting taxpayer money on vanity project on the southern border will do nothing to make us safer. #NationalSecurityStrategy
Lip service about "all the instruments of national power" means nothing alongside massive cuts to the State Department's budget and personnel. #NationalSecurityStrategy

The Trump Administration's inconsistency in messaging on the threat posted by North Korea would be comical if it was not incredibly dangerous to U.S. allies and troops in the region and beyond. #NationalSecurityStrategy
Trade deals should always prioritize American workers and companies, but pulling out of them lets other countries (like China) set the rules of the road on their own--agnostic to our interests and values. #NationalSecurityStrategy
The #ParisClimateAgreement was the most serious global effort to tackle the threat of #climatechange, ever. Now, we are the *only country in the world* not participating in that effort. #NationalSecurityStrategy
"Massive investment" in defense is ineffective if it lacks an accompanying comprehensive strategy as well as funding for diplomacy, development, and democracy promotion. #NationalSecurityStrategy
President Trump talks about our legacy of turning enemies into the "best of friends," but he has projected nothing but uncertainty and blustery criticism to our partners in East Asia, NATO, and beyond. #NationalSecurityStrategy
