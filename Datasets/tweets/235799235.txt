@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii More people gained insurance than lost it. And again it was only "disastrous" because it was undermined by the GOP because they wanted it to fail.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii De-humanizing immigrants, "illegal" or otherwise, is bigoted. If you can't see how that makes you a bigot too.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Actually the immigrants in the news article linked are not "illegal". Besides "improper entry" into the US is a misdemeanor. Regardless, committing a crime doesn't make one less than human. The fact some immigrants are "illegal" doesn't excuse comparing them to a swarm of insects
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii It became a "nightmare" because it was undermined at every chance by the GOP. Regardless I don't agree it was a nightmare. It was not a "success" but it wasn't as disastrous as you imply.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii I'm not the one de-humanizing immigrants.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Wrong. You keep confusing socialism with authoritarianism.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii you liken immigrants to insects by calling it an invasion, but suuuuuure you don't feel superior at all. 		Fuck off bigot. Good riddance.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Bullshit, you've been gaslit if you believe blanket statements like that. Socialism and communism are by definition not the same
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Keep digging this hole deeper. I don't quite think you've touted your white supremacy enough.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii A "socialistic" society can be just as "free" as a "capitalistic" one. Socialism doesn't imply authoritarianism in the same way capitalism doesn't imply democracy.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii This is a great example of racism. Doesn't "prove" anything about diversity though. Good try.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Wasn't talking about slaves, but whatever. Glad you think we're better of that we were able to take advantage of their labor.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Authoritarianism is whats wrong with Venezuela, not "socialism".
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii you realize laws can be, and have been changed, right?
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii But that doesn't happen because when people from Norway try to come here we let them.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Did the majority of the inhabitants of these lands come from Europe or no?
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii nice deflection. also it's gibberish. What does China have to do with Canadian healthcare?
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii They were "legal" because they said they were. Now that brown skinned people are trying to come here all of a sudden they've been defined as "illegal". All "illegal aliens" would suddenly be "legal" immigrants if we simply allowed them to be.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii This is a country (almost) entirely made by immigrants and their children. They've ALWAYS been pouring in. Why don't you have a problem with the way your ancestors "poured" in.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii so what you're saying is that canada's healthcare system sucks because its better than other countries systems so being used by foreigners. You realize that makes zero sense right?
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Obama "hoodwinked" us and millions more people were able to afford healthcare. Meanwhile trump is giving tax breaks to millionaires and you have no problem with that.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Wait whose system? I thought you were canadian?
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Sad news. But your one example doesn't mean no one is ever misdiagnosed in America.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Democratic socialism isn't the same as authoritarian socialism and is not mutually exclusive of capitalism, but keep grabbing for straws.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii We've had more than some degree of socialism for sometime now. If you hate socialism so much I guess it is time to disband all police and fire departments, we should tear down all the roads and highways too. Bye-bye municipal water systems.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii And yours is the opposite. Meanwhile the facts support my position better than yours.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Greed. 	Fed by capitalism.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii So what you're saying is you've made up your mind that capitalism is good and socialism is bad and no facts could change your mind.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii It's MORE successful than America's.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Riiiiiiighht, but no healthcare companies in America try to gouge patients with unnecessary treatments.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii so?
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii And american healthcare is better how?
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii More fair drug prices seems like a success to me.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii So Canada's healthcare is a success or no?
@spudahoi90 @ravencottage1 @mitchellvii Fine lets have it your way. Lets kick everyone out of the country who immigrated here, and their "anchor babies". Oh wait... thats the entire country. 		Your fearmongering sucks, try a different tact.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii If Canadian healthcare sucks so much why are so many Americans traveling to Canada to use it?
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Feel free to come use our healthcare if you're so envious of it.
@ravencottage1 @robwatterson @mitchellvii Yeaaaaahh.....riiiiiight. because Europeans never get into wars. Never had slaves. Those "settlers" that founded America definitely didn't support slavery. Colonialism definitely isn't "conquering for territory". /s		Fuck off bigot.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii You really don't understand what democratic socialism is do you?
@ravencottage1 @mitchellvii Just like the trump family is dependent on government freebies right? Your family immigrated here, does that mean you're reliant on government handouts? Your bigoted narrative needs work.
@ravencottage1 @robwatterson @mitchellvii Riiiiight yeah the bottom 50% are living like kings, meanwhile the top 1% are living like peasants because they have to pay so many taxes. Millionaires cant afford a bigger yacht. Poor millionaires.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Yes their tech employees make decent wages. But the tech employees make a small percentage of all amazon employees. Just ask any amazon warehouse worker whether or not they make a fair wage.
@ravencottage1 @robwatterson @mitchellvii Could you be more racist? Sorry they didn't meet your standards for intelligence. They existed in harmony with the land they lived on for thousands of years. We have barely been here 300 and have have cause irreparable harm to the ecosystem.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Amazon decided not to make a new HQ in New York because they are greedy and some other state will pay them better to build there. Corporations will do whats best for their bottom line unless forced to act for the common good by regulations.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Riiiiiiiight, but paying thousands of people a minimum wage which is unlivable is isn't a form of slavery at all. /s
@ravencottage1 @robwatterson @mitchellvii "Settlers" and "colonists" cute names for "thieves" and "backstabbers"
@ravencottage1 @robwatterson @mitchellvii So you're saying your ancestors stole the land from the nation-states that were living there before?

@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Riiiiiight dems are the alarmists, meanwhile the GOP is manufacturing national emergencies to push through their agenda. /s
@ravencottage1 @robwatterson @mitchellvii The top one percent have a majority of the wealth, the bottom 50% HAVE virtually nothing. Why should those with the most wealth NOT pay the most in tax?
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii I have no idea what that means. It's just gibberish. You'll have to be more descriptive of the type of government/economy you're describing. 		And by gaming the system do you mean like giant corporations (and wealthy people) who make billions in profits and pay zero in taxes?
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Thats simply not true. Don't believe everything you hear from fox news. Universal medicare would save the American tax payers money.
@ravencottage1 @mitchellvii Tax breaks for millionaires at the expense of education, healthcare, and other social services funding is what is overwhelming those programs. Besides if we allowed those people to legally immigrate they would pay their fair share of taxes, supporting those programs.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Shall we go back to hunter-gatherer societies then?
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii They already have capitalism. Strong social programs do not preclude capitalism. Case in point: IKEA exists.
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii democratic socialistic policies do not preclude capitalism. 		Do you support our police force? Fire departments? Do you ever drive on our Interstate system? Do you ever use water from a tap? 		Do I think Obamacare is the answer to our healthcare problems? No. Medicare for all is.
@LisaSing75 @HallHalsey @mitchellvii Taxes are not theft if they're implemented democratically. They're allowed for in the constitution. Do you or do you not support our constitution? 		Remember the revolutionary war mantra was "no taxation WITHOUT representation". It was NOT "no taxation"
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii When did I say that?
@HallHalsey @LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Democratically implemented policies are by definition democratic, whether or not they "restrict freedoms". Not that I'm advocating for a restriction of freedoms, I do however advocate for increases in the general welfare of the population.
@robwatterson @mitchellvii In 2017 there were 1.1 Million legal immigrants. 	This is approximately .03% of the population (317 million). 	This is approximately 23% of all new US citizens (3.86 million babies born)
@robwatterson @mitchellvii Educate yourself: 		https://t.co/OvczPAAJin
@LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Norway, Sweden, Denmark. 	America (medicare, social security, police forces, fire depts, the interstate system. All these are examples of "social welfare programs" aka "socialism") 	Democratic Socialism is what makes this country great. Capitalism makes the wealthy wealthy.
@robwatterson @mitchellvii If our country didn't let in immigrants your ancestors would've had to turn their ship back around to Europe. 	Be thankful for this countries pro-immigration history, its what Made America "Great" in the first place.
@robwatterson @mitchellvii Stop making up numbers.
@robwatterson @mitchellvii But we're not letting them come here legally, those that try to come here legally are having their children taken away never to be seen again.
@LisaSing75 @mitchellvii Authoritarian socialism is not the same as democratic socialism. Authoritarianism is bad whether its based on socialism or capitalism. 		The way you talk about socialism you must hate our police force, and fire department, and paved roads, and stop lights, and potable water...
@robwatterson @mitchellvii Not one of those people would have a problem of paying their fair share of taxes if they were allowed in legally. 		Billionaires in this country on the other hand are giving themselves tax breaks and blaming our failing economy on the most disadvantaged and you're falling for it.
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Putin?
@mitchellvii If there is a crisis, it's whatever is causing them to migrate, not the fact they are trying to come here.
@revrrlewis Do those walls have doors? or does he apparate in and out?
@CharlesHamerle Why? Why no path for citizenship? and What about for those who never committed the crime of improper entry, who came her legally then overstayed their visa?
@CharlesHamerle If you‚Äôre tired of paying for them then maybe we should give them a path to citizenship and let them pay more taxes.
@CharlesHamerle @mitchellvii We‚Äôre not, we‚Äôre giving that money as tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires. ‚ÄúIllegals‚Äù boost our economy. The reason you can afford groceries is because of ‚Äúillegals‚Äù. Just ask trump, he wouldn‚Äôt have any hotels or golf courses without ‚Äúillegal‚Äù labor.
@WinstonJournal @mitchellvii So wait, are your ancestors immigrants or pioneers? Because remember it is you who linked the article about pioneers. I was only using the language you seem to prefer.  And please explain to me the difference, why were your ancestors considered ‚Äúlegal‚Äù, was it their skin color?
@WinstonJournal @mitchellvii This is the ‚Äúland of opportunity‚Äù that was the appeal before America existed and that remains the appeal now.  You have not demstrated how migrants to these lands now differ at all compared to migrants of the past. What makes your ancestors ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù and them ‚Äúillegals‚Äù?
@WinstonJournal @mitchellvii ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt immigrate to something that isn‚Äôt there.‚Äù		So what American ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù created North America? Did Columbus bring trillions of tons of soil over from the Old World? Was there just ocean there before?
@WinstonJournal @mitchellvii ‚ÄúPioneers‚Äù aka thieves. Let‚Äôs ask some NATIVE Americans who immigrated here and who didn‚Äôt. Seriously fuck off with this gaslighting bullshit.
@WinstonJournal @mitchellvii America is a country built by immigrants. Fact.
@WinstonJournal @mitchellvii What constitutional law is that exactly? 		What makes your ancestors different from these brown skinned migrants you seem to despise so much?
@steve_durnan @mitchellvii Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that most ‚Äúillegal aliens‚Äù entered the country legally but overstayed their visa. Those who aren‚Äôt violent criminals should be allowed to stay. Just like your ancestors were allowed to stay.
@WinstonJournal @mitchellvii I‚Äôm for more stringent background checks. I don‚Äôt think weapons BANS are the answer. But I would certainly love to see some restrictions on how readily available certain weapons are. Whether that‚Äôs increased taxes for weapons with increased lethality, or through other means.
@WinstonJournal @mitchellvii It‚Äôs not my job to decide what can be dont. But gun laws in one state are meaningless if the next state over doesnt have any laws. If we don‚Äôt attempt to solve this problem nationally we won‚Äôt make any progress. No one policy change will solve everything, but many could help.
@bourbasted @dsigal @bigfive6721 @mitchellvii All drugs should be legal, taxed, and regulated. The war on drugs is a failure. That policy sux go find another.

@steve_durnan @mitchellvii Stop making up numbers. The number of arrests in 2017 was 300,000. That‚Äôs less than half the number per month than you claim. This is less of a crisis than at any point in the last 50 years. 2 of which trump wasted giving tax breaks to himself, rather than solving this ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô.
@spk2943 @mitchellvii Drugs come through the legal ports of entry. So a wall wouldn‚Äôt help. 		You know what would though? Legalizing safer medicines such as marijuana.
@dsigal @bigfive6721 @mitchellvii Exactly this. 		Besides a wall is only effective if it is properly manned, so even if we did build a wall we‚Äôd need just as many border patrolmen. You know because ladders...exist.
@bigfive6721 @mitchellvii But said drugs come through the legal points of entry. So how would a wall help?

@Big_Bob_Mac @GayRepublicSwag You said it. Not me.
@Big_Bob_Mac @GayRepublicSwag If he wants a wall he must offer permanent DACA legislation. He already missed his opportunity to pass a wall while the GOP held both chambers of congress. That‚Äôs all on him (and Mitch)
@Big_Bob_Mac @GayRepublicSwag I‚Äôm not disputing the NPR article, just pointing out trump could have had his wall a year ago if he was willing to compromise. He‚Äôs not. If trump is unwilling to offer DACA legislation then he will only get offered 1.3 mil for border security.
@Big_Bob_Mac @GayRepublicSwag That‚Äôs the deal he gets if he won‚Äôt pass DACA.
@Big_Bob_Mac @GayRepublicSwag trump wouldn‚Äôt sign because he won‚Äôt compromise. It‚Äôs not dems fault for calling his bluff. It‚Äôs his for bluffing.

@JeanB19580597 @RyanAFournier Evidence: he was accused of rape. 	Also the only other person in the room at the time refused to defend him. Also his self released calendar from the time did not exonerate him. In fact it gave a likely exact date on which the event occurred.

@JeanB19580597 @RyanAFournier Absolutely will keep an open mind. 		To me it‚Äôs simple. An innocent person welcomes an investigation into credible allegations and the forthcoming exoneration it would provide. Only a guilty person would try to undermine such an investigation at every step of the way.

@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 That is exactly what he wants. Thats exactly how he wins 2020. We cannot lose sight of the fact that IT IS NOT NORMAL to have a senile, deranged geriatric in the white house. (not to say Biden would be like that, but he is old, the presidency takes a toll). 	/end
@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 Ok now I want to address something. 	 	 "And trump has set the bar so low on mental capacity that Biden is a perfect candidate " 		I really dislike the way you phrased this. We need to be extremely adamant against letting trump lower the bar for presidential standards. 	/ps
@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 Biden strikes out on all three, so does Bernie, but his policy I think is better.  Beto, Warren, and Harris are my current favorites, with Harris edging out the others. But I am excited to see how the field shapes up, and cant wait to see the first debate.
@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 In the end it all comes down to policy, I will vote for the (well supported) candidate whose ideas I most like. But there will be a few dems with GREAT policy resumes, and all things being equal I would prefer to vote for a candidate that is NOT old, not white, and not male.	/6

@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 They must not only survive the stress but be able to still have the tenacity to continue pushing the legislation through congress that our country (world) so desperately needs (basically the Green New Deal). 	/5
@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 In 2020 it is extremely important for my that we elect a candidate who will be able to handle the extreme stress for all 8 years (plus campaign time). Its only been two years and we're already seeing a huge decline in trumps mental capacity. 	/4
@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 BTW I was an ardent Bernie supporter in 2016 but will (most likely) not be voting for him in 2020 for the same reason. His age was a concern in 2016, but so was Hillary's, and her health seemed worse. 	/3
@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 [sorry this got so long]		I agree age doesn't matter as long as the candidate is physically and mentally capable, and Biden does seem to be in great shape. But by inauguration in 2021 Biden will be 78. That's old. Even the most fit 80 year old in the world is well past his prime
@MetalHeartbyRen @kathrynresister @Stop_Trump20 I completely understand and agree with your sentiment, however, still stick by my statement. My comment implied age is the only factor for my aversion to Biden, which is not true, he has some other concerns. All in all dems could do A LOT worse, but we can also do better. 	/1

@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier You clearly forgot what you just said about our hypothetical country. You said neither tax option was what you would prefer. You preferred the first scenario (no taxes) over either other scenario, 2 (sales tax, i.e. fixed amount) and 3 (income tax, i.e. fixed percentage).
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Oh good. Dehumanizing poor people. How civil of you.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier It does seem obvious. 	No taxes = no government.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier I was talking about our hypothetical country with that stat.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier So how does the gov‚Äôt exist if they can‚Äôt collect taxes?

@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier 13.9% ($6.95). 	Total tax: $9.45. 		So in this example a ‚Äúsliding scale‚Äù tax was substantially beneficial for 2/3 of the country. For the other 1/3 it was minimally less preferred. 		For A and B it was ~5% better but for C it was &lt;1% worse.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Common misconception would be to think C would have to pay $13.9 in taxes. For the first $50 he makes in the year he‚Äôs taxed at the same rate as everyone else, 5% ($2.50). It is only once he makes more than $50 that he gets taxed higher, and only on that additional amount.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier 4) to collect the $10 the gov‚Äôt could use this tax structure:	5% income tax for those making less than $50. 13.9% on income greater than $50. 	All needs covered and 	A has $0.95 (their best outcome)	B has $9.50 (also the best outcome) 	C has $90.55 (marginally worse than before)
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier 3) fixed % tax. 9% tax. 	As before all three now live and have some money to play with. 	A has $0.91	B has $9.10 (better than option 2) 	C has $91 (worse off than option 2 but happier neighbors) 		And now the fun part. The sliding scale tax.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier 2) gov‚Äôt taxes with a fixed $ amount. 	$3.33 each. Works for B ($6.67 leftover) and C ($96.7). But A can‚Äôt afford it so maybe since they‚Äôre poor the gov‚Äôt will cover the missing $2 it for them. To do this the gov‚Äôt must inflate the money supply (or tax the others more)
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Now we have 4 scenarios b/c we‚Äôre adding in a sliding scale tax. 		1) no gov‚Äôt, no taxes. 	Person A dies. 	Person B lives but has $0 leftover after buying basic necessities. Person C has $90 to play with.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier In regards to the sliding scale: 		Let‚Äôs change the hypothetical. Now there‚Äôs three people. A makes $1. B makes $10. C makes $100. 		Basic necessities cost $10 per person, if bought from the free market. But If the government provides all basic needs they can do it for $10 total.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier You completely misunderstood my premise. In option one the poor person DIES because they cannot afford their basic necessities.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Ok we‚Äôll move onto the sliding scales in a moment. 		But so you agree. In our hypothetical  country it works out best if rather than taxing everyone with a fixed dollar amount we instead tax everyone with a fixed percentage?

@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier 3) the gov‚Äôt collects the $2 using an income tax of ~2%. Now both have all their basic necessities covered AND both can afford ice cream. A has $0.80 and B has $98 and both can happily enjoy their ice cream together. 		Now, which option is best for this hypothetical country?
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier 2) the gov‚Äôt collects $2 in taxes by charging everyone $1 in income tax. 	Now both A and B have all their needs covered. B has $99, but B still doesn‚Äôt have any friends to enjoy the ice cream with, unless he buys it for A.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier There are three outcomes: 		1) the gov‚Äôt collects no taxes. Person A can not afford all basic necessities and dies. person B can and has $98 to spend on ice cream, but no friends to enjoy it with.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Person A makes $1 per year, person B makes $100. These are thre only two people in this country. Now let‚Äôs say ‚Äúall basic needs‚Äù for both can be provided by the government for $2, or purchased from the free market for $2ea. And for fun let‚Äôs say ice cream costs $0.50.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Here‚Äôs a hypothetical for you...
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Here‚Äôs the problem with your ice cream analogy. We‚Äôre not talking about deciding whether or not to buy a snack. We‚Äôre talking about mandating everyone buy something regardless of if they can afford it.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier I‚Äôll leave you with this thought. With even the most extreme income taxes, such as the 70% proposed by AOC or the 95% seen after the new deal; under no circumstances does earning a higher income cause you to take home less money after taxes. Earning more ALWAYS nets you more.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier You are absolutely NOT going to convince me a regressive tax is more fair than a progressive tax. 		So if I can‚Äôt change your mind then yes lets agree to disagree. 		Thank you for maintaining a civil discourse.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Relativity doesn‚Äôt make it any LESS valid either. 		50% is 50% 		0.15% IS 50% more than 0.1%		0.1% is infinitely more than 0%		So a drug that is 0.1% effective is infinitely better than one that works 0%. One that works 0.15% would be even better for a patient.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Do they not?
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Why should one person pay 1,000 times more for a gov‚Äôt service? Because they make 1,000+ times more income. 		Alternatively, why should someone who makes the LEAST amount of money pay the HIGHEST percentage of that income as tax?
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Ok whatever. 		Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that an opinion is NOT a fact.
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier https://t.co/YF5Dgw1mJH
@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Actually sales tax is NOT the same for everyone. The poor, who spend a higher percentage of income of consumable goods, spend a higher percentage of their income on sales tax than the wealthy.

@garethdavidza @tannerstake @RyanAFournier Here‚Äôs the truth: the top 3% own a (much) higher percentage of the wealth in this country than the percentage of taxes they pay.

@SSG_Davis_Ret @RyanAFournier The average immigrant consumed $6 more in cash assistance, $7 more in SNAP benefits, and $98 more in Medicaid than the average native did. However, the average immigrant consumed $56 less in SSI, $610 less in Medicare, and $1,808 less in Social Security retirement benefits
@SSG_Davis_Ret @RyanAFournier Figure 1 compares all immigrants with all natives. The average value of welfare benefits per immigrant was about $3,718 in 2016, about 39 percent less than the $6,081 average value of welfare benefits per native.

@Penny34066068 @Thomas1774Paine If it was as you say, and he did ‚Äúpush her arm down‚Äù a couple things would have happened. It would‚Äôve pulled her shoulder and body in that same direction somewhat. And I think it would also have caused her to look AT his arm in response. 		6/
@Penny34066068 @Thomas1774Paine The last detail, watch her body. Once she gets a grip on the mic she turns her body, starting to walk off, as she‚Äôs pulling the mic towards her, and presumably out of his hand. 		It‚Äôs not until after she realizes he‚Äôs not letting go that she turns back to look at him. 		5/
@Penny34066068 @Thomas1774Paine As she‚Äôs reaching out, her fingers fumble momentarily finding a grip. Just as she gets a grip she starts pulling the mic, which is when 		Watch again, focus on two things. The movement of the microphone and the movement of her elbow, notice how in sync they are. 		4/
@Penny34066068 @Thomas1774Paine He WAS moving his arm down, to ‚Äúmeet‚Äù hers I guess  is how I look at it, to kind of put his arm on hers in a ‚Äúhold on‚Äù type of way.		After the recoil , he continues to track her arm with his. But i still contend her arm is moving down because she is pulling the mic. 		3/
@Penny34066068 @Thomas1774Paine Watch the un-doctored video. This angle is pretty good. 		https://t.co/jRrlYcYicV		Slowed down to .25 really helps see the little details. Notice the moment their arms first meet, it is Acosta‚Äôs hand which recoils from the contact, not her arm. 		2/
@Penny34066068 @Thomas1774Paine Yes, thank you for actually having intelligent discourse to add to the discussion, rather than just insults and rambling nonsense. It‚Äôs refreshing to disagree with someone but still have a civil discussion. 		Now back to the topic at hand...
@Notellin5 @Thomas1774Paine @Acosta You‚Äôre the one who brought up past presidents records. How is bringing up the current presidents record regarding press conferences deflecting when the subject at hand is the current president‚Äôs press conference. 		Typical trumpkin doesn‚Äôt have an argument so just insults.
@jimmythegote @Thomas1774Paine Holding onto a mic is assault?
@Penny34066068 @Thomas1774Paine I would go one step further. Perhaps he could‚Äôve avoided contacting her arm. But I don‚Äôt think he ‚Äúpushed her arm down‚Äù.  	Her arm moved down because she was trying to pull the mic from him.
@Penny34066068 @Thomas1774Paine Agreed, not a crime, but it is a crime for the WH to restrict a journalist‚Äôs freedom by stripping his credentials and falsely accusing him of a crime to justify doing so.

@BradLoerzel Right. Beyond doubt (in my mind) that‚Äôs no different than you saying hillary committed a crime. You believe she did beyond doubt.
@JensonTaylor @freedom_moates Wtf are you talking about? That tweet makes zero sense.
@BradLoerzel You didn‚Äôt use the word guilty, but guess what, in the English language you can use other words to mean the same thing. I.e. ‚Äúhillary committed the crime‚Äù is the means the same as saying ‚Äúhillary is guilty of committing a crime.‚Äù
@BradLoerzel Why the fuck are you quoting yourself in the third person? How many different Russian trolls are you?
@BradLoerzel Still no different than my comments about trumps crimes.
@BradLoerzel Right. And has that happened with hillary? No? Then why are you presuming her guilt?
@BradLoerzel ‚ÄúMuch more deeper in depth‚Äù 		Before you dive into case law I really think you need an introduction to an English dictionary first.
@BradLoerzel I do! It‚Äôs you who seems to be having difficulty with the concept. Or perhaps its your grasp of the English language. At any rate it should be clear to any somewhat mediocre mind that saying someone actually broke the law when they haven‚Äôt been convicted IS PRESUMING their guilt.

@JensonTaylor @freedom_moates Doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt happen. Just means the republicans in control are just as guilty as he is if they oblige his treason.

@BradLoerzel You‚Äôve done the same regarding hillary.
@BradLoerzel I‚Äôm not saying there shouldn‚Äôt be a trial. But if I were a juror on that trial, given all the evidence currently available, I would conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that trump is a traitor. The fact trump doesn‚Äôt want to sit for an interview w/ mueller is further proof.
@BradLoerzel Yes, that is how the court system works. The COURT must presume the defendant innocent until proven otherwise. It is NOT illegal for CITIZENS to have a presumption of anyone‚Äôs guilt of a crime. It is my first amendment right to speak out about  those I feel have violated laws.
@BradLoerzel Wtf are you talking about here? He took the plea deal.
@BradLoerzel You seem to conveniently not remember a lot of the transgressions trump has gotten himself into. Cohen named trump as a co-conspirator.

@BradLoerzel And if we didn‚Äôt have a GOP obstructing the investigation at every step of the way that would be the case. Unfortunately the GOP would rather have a traitorous president who happened to run as an (R) than to do their job and search for the truth on behalf of trump American public
@alocke4454 @ValB3470 @freedom_moates Sorry. Your opinion is not the truth.
@ValB3470 @alocke4454 @freedom_moates Keep deluding yourself but if that were the case Cohen wouldn‚Äôt have just pleaded guilty to committing campaign finance laws on behalf of trump.
@BradLoerzel You asked for ‚Äúproof‚Äù. Not evidence. There is plenty of ‚Äúevidence‚Äù, as has been detailed by most of the media. More than enough evidence to convict him ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù that he violated the foreign emoluments clause of the constitution, in addition to other crimes.
@BradLoerzel All the proof I need. 		Why did trump have a meeting with putin in the first place? And why was the meeting held without any witnesses? https://t.co/OkHPldm0Ab
@Rockpirate420 @freedom_moates You realize that during his guilty plea he directly implicated trump. Said he made the payments at the direct request of trump. That makes trump a co-conspirator.
@Rockpirate420 @freedom_moates The media was silent in 2008 because that payment happened in 2013. Good try though.
@Rockpirate420 @freedom_moates What do you call a witch hunt that finds witches?
@NCSheepdog trump has neglected to implement  the Russian sanctions, that was the trade he and putin made. 	Also Hillary paid a US company for the dossier not Russians.
@Rockpirate420 @freedom_moates If they ‚Äúgot nothing‚Äù then why did Cohen plead guilty? And why won‚Äôt trump submit to an interview?
@NCSheepdog @freedom_moates I‚Äôm not defending Hillary. She was absolutely the wrong choice for the Dems in 2016. 		But I am pointing out that conspiring with a foreign government is a worse crime. 		PS trump has been using his personal phone continuously since taking office.
@Rockpirate420 @freedom_moates trump conspired with a foreign government to influence an election. In return for Russia‚Äôs help trump has refused to enact sanctions on them passed by ~98% of congress. trump is a traitor. 		Using campaign funds to pay hush money to porn stars also happens to be illegal.
@Joan1Barb @RachelSuperEli1 @freedom_moates Russia financed his campaign. trump hasnt had money of his own in decades.
@BradLoerzel But conspiring with a foreign government to influence an election is ok?
@freedom_moates Riiiiiight, it‚Äôs the left who are hypocrites, but for the right when Obama breaks the law, or Hillary sends an email they ‚Äúshould be locked up‚Äù. But when trump commits an objectively worse crime it‚Äôs ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump But I thought you only hired the best people? 		Michael Cohen: Guilty 	Paul Manafort: Guilty 	Rick Gates: Guilty 	George Papadapalous: Guilty 	Michael Flynn: Guilty 		Not so great a batting average there @realDonaldTrump, and you‚Äôre obviously trembling in your boots.
@freedom_moates Don‚Äôt worry, Pence will be impeached as well. President Paul Ryan will be just as bad a pres though. President Nancy Pelosi will be the next pres though under this circumstance. And just imagine how insane the gop will go.

@FrandsenLasse @freedom_moates For immigrants in general. I think that everyone should be given a chance. Unless there is a specific reason not to. Obv actual terrorists/gang members should not be let in. All Should enter at legal entry points, but most cross illegally bc they know they‚Äôll get turned away.
@FrandsenLasse @freedom_moates Pretty much yeah. For asylum seekers we could detain them humanely, with their family together, while their cases are being processed.

@jayray119604 @Mee_first @FoxNews @POTUS trump is on pace to play as much golf in his first term as Obama did during all 8.

@FrandsenLasse @freedom_moates From your very handy link: 		For the first improper entry offense, the person can be fined (as a criminal or civil penalty), or imprisoned for up to six months, or both. This is considered a misdemeanor under federal law (18 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 3559).
@FrandsenLasse @freedom_moates Second of all do you know that the law does NOT mandate jail time for first time improper entry offenders? It is (was) trump‚Äôs decision to arrest, detain, and separate those families. He could have followed the law (with zero tolerance) but not locked them up, instead fining them

@jwinklerPDX @Gopo_Pogo @MrDane1982 I don‚Äôt believe that the Russians changed votes. Their involvement was purely cyber, hacking the emails, fake social media accounts, advertisements. They might‚Äôve had a hand in the registered voter purging but I don‚Äôt think the republicans needed any help there.
@jwinklerPDX @Gopo_Pogo @MrDane1982 Only crazy in battleground states. Much different for those of us in the solidly blue and solidly red states who knew where their electoral votes where going.
@Gopo_Pogo @jwinklerPDX @MrDane1982 Hillary was supposed to be the moderate Democrat who could pull across party lines. That didn‚Äôt happen.
@Gopo_Pogo @jwinklerPDX @MrDane1982 Why don‚Äôt Johnson voters ever get blamed, they outnumbered Stein voters something like 4:1. And as far as I can tell not a single ‚Äúnever-trump‚Äù republican voted for Hillary, many left it blank. Not to even mention the 51+ percent of the electorate who didn‚Äôt vote at all.
@Gopo_Pogo @AnthonyUplandpt @ChrisNelson64 @MrDane1982 How do you really feel ‚Äútotally non-divisive person‚Äù?
@jwinklerPDX @MrDane1982 Then Hillary‚Äôs reluctance to campaign on it cost her the election.
@AnthonyUplandpt @ChrisNelson64 @MrDane1982 So you want them (Bernie‚Äôs ‚Äúoutside the tent‚Äù supporters) to vote republican than? Cause that‚Äôs what they did in 2016. (Not me) 		What does that even mean anyways?
@ChrisNelson64 @AnthonyUplandpt @MrDane1982 It took Al Gore 9 days, after Hillary conceded and endorsed Obama, for him to endorse Obama. 		Most of Obama‚Äôs endorsements happened after he started winning primaries handily. Before that he only had a a few notable endorsements. While Hillary had the whole rest of the estab.
@ChrisNelson64 @AnthonyUplandpt @MrDane1982 Look at this list of Hillary endorsements. 		https://t.co/K3yQTrkucZ		Then compare to the handful of Obama‚Äôs endoresments that happened before he started winning primaries. 		https://t.co/x6W3xEsfKo
@RhmRich Got anything more to add bright one?
@notatro76076410 @MrDane1982 Ahhh. Yeah well if he cant handle the first amendment then maybe he‚Äôs part of the problem.
@Pauletteaz2 @MrDane1982 I didn‚Äôt call obama establishment. He won in 2008 and 2012, the only years you can call dem wins since 1996. 2000, 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2016 all went poorly. Blame obama if you want for 2010/2014 but I‚Äôll blame the DNC establishment for ignoring the people in favor of corps.
@AnthonyUplandpt @MrDane1982 You can call it hacked but that‚Äôs the electoral college for you. Comes down to a handful of voters in rural states (and Florida) Hillary has never appealed to those voters. If gop hacked in 2000 and 2016 why not in 2008?
@AnthonyUplandpt @MrDane1982 No, let me remind you Obama was the long shot candidate who beat the establishment candidate: Hillary. the establishment has since let him into their ranks. Kinda what happens when you win. And Gore and Hillary lost. They were establishment and lost. That‚Äôs the point.
@100realwood @MrDane1982 Are Hillary‚Äôs hacked emails the reason republicans still control the house and senate too? 		And it‚Äôs not progressives fault the dem establishment chose a candidate under (then) current federal investigation. Regardless hillary‚Äôs overall qualifications, that was dumb.
@NotUrNegro @MrDane1982 Like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez? Agreed.
@MrDane1982 You mad bro?
@MrDane1982 Long story short the Democrats need a new establishment.
@MrDane1982 And by won I mean overall for a while election cycle. 2008 and 2012 don‚Äôt count since obama was outside the establishment and the Dems did so terribly in 2010 and 2014.
@MrDane1982 Sounds like you need everything the democratic establishment isn‚Äôt. Not sure if you‚Äôve been paying attention but the democratic establishment hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwon‚Äù and election since 1996.

@lavo323 @RealCandaceO No, the Dems "colluded" with Fusion GPS, an AMERICAN company, who in turn worked with foreign citizens to collect intel.		trump (and/or his team) worked directly with Agents of the Russian Government to coordinate swaying the election.  		see the difference?

@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier The US dollar wouldn‚Äôt exist without the US gov. If you like trading your time for US dollars that‚Äôs not possible without the gov. The gov can‚Äôt exist without collecting taxes. So if you want to go back to a system of nomadic bartering clans than perhaps we can stop paying taxes.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Here‚Äôs the thing about taxes. The government has been (legally) collecting taxes for years. When you go to work you damn well know you must pay taxes on the money made. Don‚Äôt like paying taxes? Don‚Äôt work! Or don‚Äôt trade your time for the currency that the us gov makes.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Ok first of all. The constitution changes. I agree that we shouldn‚Äôt be able to reinterpret it at will. But we can change it. When the founders gave us the constitution they also gave us the first 10 changes to it and told us the process to make the changes we desire.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Ok cool. Yeah that works. And people who don‚Äôt pay their taxes don‚Äôt get to drive on the roads. Dont get power or utilities to their house. Cant call the fire dept if their house burns down. Must pay out of their pocket for healthcare. Don‚Äôt get to call the cops in an emergency.
@TomiLahren But what you do for a ‚Äúliving‚Äù is definitely not attention seeking foolishness.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier We live in a free country. That does not mean you are free to do ANYTHING you want. You can‚Äôt kill others. You can‚Äôt otherwise deprive others of your freedoms. The constitution allows for the government to exist, and collect taxes. Again what do you have against our constitution?
@TheGoodGodAbove ‚ÄúI picked a bad week to quit smoking weed‚Äù
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier No we aren‚Äôt. No one is demanding that if you have the finances you can‚Äôt still get whatever healthcare suits your needs/desires. We are demanding that the gov better utilize the funds it currently collects to ensure that everyone can afford/be provided adequate healthcare.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier It‚Äôs not comply or die. Have you ever not paid your federal taxes? Did the government come to you house and shoot you? Is the punishment for not paying taxes the death penalty? Hell no!
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier No you don‚Äôt. You just have to have congress pass a bill to change the way in which we distribute the money that the gov already CONSTITUTIONALLY takes from us. It‚Äôs not illegal. It‚Äôs not holding a gun to our head. It‚Äôs constitutional.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Also it would be cheaper to provide single payer universal healthcare than to subsidize the healthcare Industry in the way we currently do.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Yep sure do, every person should be covered. As you said, let‚Äôs promote healthy lifestyles through education. 		Currently you can be penalized on the organ transfer list for such unhealthy lifestyle habits. No reason for that to change.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier You‚Äôll have to rephrase. I have no idea what YOU‚ÄôRE alluding to. Your words have lost their meaning in your  ambiguity.
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Ok let‚Äôs address it...		Do you not believe providing healthcare to its citizens is good for the ‚Äúgeneral welfare‚Äù of the United States. Or do you believe unhealthy citizens have no bearing on the ‚Äúwell being‚Äù of a country?
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Taxes are directly allowed for in the constitution. So is it the constitution you believe is wrong?
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Article I, Sect 8, Clause 1: The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the US
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier We can all agree that some of the money is spent poorly. Hence why we def oppose trump and the GOP for the tax scam bill they passed right?
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier So what about modern society is it that you have a problem with. Is it the highways? The schools? Do you hate the police? Fire? The military? What about these public services makes you so angry towards paying the taxes which fund them?
@Jake77052429 @alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Stop pulling ‚Äúfacts‚Äù out of your ass. We are taxed nowhere near 50% of our income. If that was the case not only would the US be able to afford Medicare for all, and free higher education for all, it could probably House us all very comfortably.

@TheBeetIejuice @RyanAFournier I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. But do you know the way in which planned parenthood obtains taxpayer funds?

@tabletop45 @lisamurkowski Why can‚Äôt you (conservatives) be grateful that it was a progressive black man who turned the country around after GW‚Äôs (a conservative) disastrous policies, and wall streets actions, caused the worst economic recession since the Great Depression?

@TheBeetIejuice @RyanAFournier He opposes women‚Äôs rights regarding abortion. So naturally since you support abortion rights you would oppose him being confirmed.
@TheBeetIejuice @RyanAFournier They don‚Äôt use tax money though.

@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom The ‚Äúgvmnt‚Äù subsidizes the oil and coal industry to the tune of $20 billion dollars annually. Subsidizing solar/wind by this much could significantly decrease the cost of installation. Making them more profitable at current efficiencies/longevities. 		https://t.co/PMJbfViuXX
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom If you‚Äôve studied this to death than you should have some sources to back up your claims.
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom Right, I get that. But what I‚Äôm saying is that the technology is already at that point. But the government is standing in the way by subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and refusing to (adequately) subsidize the clean energy industry.
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom Sorry if a random twitter persons ‚Äúreal world experience‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough evidence for me to doubt scientific studies. And sorry if thinking about problems on a larger scale than a single residence at a time is too complex of a topic for you to grasp.
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom Yes this might be true on a single home basis, this is due to the governments subsidies of the fossil fuel industries, which in turn lobbies to keep the gov from subsidizing the solar/wind industries. If they were subsidized the same even then your ROI would be there.
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom Source for energy use: 	https://t.co/nvsmNcqSO7
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom That‚Äôs great. But that‚Äôs one example that would save SOME energy, not a solution to our energy problem. Lighting makes up a small percentage of our national energy use (&lt;20%). Cleaning up the entire supply of electricity is what‚Äôs needed to reverse the large scale impacts.
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom Source:		https://t.co/SbCUWyZsTl
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom Why would we stick with old tech when the new tech is not only cleaner, but also cheaper? 		The time is here. Renewables are better in every way than fossil fuels. The only ones who disagree are those profiting off fossil fuels, and those that theyve duped into rejecting science. https://t.co/jcyasTz9ES
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom The upstart cost is a difficult hurdle for most average Americans I know, but that is why we need government investment in large scale solar/wind projects. Or in tax rebates for solar instillation.
@PowerCat46 @WalshFreedom Solar cell efficiency alone is a worthless metric to judge performance of a solar panel. You need to factor in the cost to produce said panel. And the fact is in 2018 we can produce energy far cheaper with solar than with oil or gas.

@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA It‚Äôs not actually his call though. In this country ‚Äòpresident‚Äô does not mean ‚Äòdictator‚Äô like it does in Russia. Here we have something called separations of powers. Congress writes the legislation, the president enforces it, if they pass it overwhelmingly, he doesnt get a say.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA Then investigate it! How many times do I have to say it before you acknowledge it. And I didn‚Äôt say that it doesn‚Äôt matter. Just that there‚Äôs more urgent national security concerns.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA Wait...wait...wait. Let me see if I can get this straight. Russian collusion was a hoax because Anthony Weiner was a child molester? 		Really not sure how you made that connection. You‚Äôll have to elaborate.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA It matters little to me whether trump is a crook or an imbecile. Either way he‚Äôs a terrible (US) president
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA Trump refusing to implement the bipartisan Russian sanctions says it all. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he wittingly colluded. Russia interfered, wanted him president because he‚Äôd go easier on them, and then got what they were looking for.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA Whatever that is supposed to mean.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA Whatever, Neither of them are president now. There are more urgent matters at hand.

@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt pin it on me‚Äô 		Wtf does that even mean. You just used it in your previous tweet. I didn‚Äôt imply that you invented the word. I was just using the quotes to emphasize it.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA The 13 indictments of the Russians is a formality. Used to validate the idea that Russia actually did interfere. Also I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs aware he has no extradition power. But those people can at least be permantly banned from the country.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA Good quote. 		Define mainstream media organization though. 		Should I just listen to random internet strangers instead?
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA His ethics are preventing him from investigating criminals? 		You‚Äôre argument is crumbling. But keep digging if you must.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA Remember, Manafort was trumps  handpicked, original campaign manager. He was certainly part of the inner circle.
@ehazzard @BruceSherbert @RealJamesWoods @NRA The indictments on Manafort will be part of the plea deal to get him to become the key witness in the trump case. Gates already flipped on Manafort it seems, putting the pressure on. And then The new indictments today are secret for a reason. They must be more involved charges.

@WalshFreedom Yes, and it is not controversial that ALL speech is NOT protected by the first amendment. Threats of other people‚Äôs lives, for example, is not. There are people in this country that ought to be denied their access to guns because they threaten other innocent lives by having them.
