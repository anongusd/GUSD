Who are you?
@zenoilsmiranda @isaacmashman H. E. H. E. * I am elated that you share your Honest opinion... I adore more that you mention Equality as the most important part of maintaining balance between Humility and Empathy
@zenoilsmiranda @isaacmashman Do you believe one is more important than the other?
@isaacmashman @zenoilsmiranda Humility vs Empathy, what is your definition of the two? How do you separate them?
Stop worrying what we have done and focus on what still needs done... I promise, it has absolutely nothing to do with money #Prevention #healthcare

@JohnCleese Why 42? I believe the answer is (4x4)x1! 4 to the 2nd power!  Or better yet 4 squared!
I'm hooked on S.P.E.E.D		Stay Honest	Practice Empathy	Encourage Harmony	Exercise Humility	Demonstrate Equality		What is your addiction? https://t.co/XstxADuWZW
like pre-written Christmas Cards... where is the humility in automated messages... where is humility in not speaking directly to your audience?
@zenoilsmiranda @isaacmashman I believe that! Put ourselves in the other person's shoes... try and see the situation thru their eyes
@isaacmashman Honesty*Equality*Humility*Empathy 	which of these are lacking most in society today?
Don't H.I.D.E. behind Hope	H.A.V.E. Faith	We are all D.I.V.A.'s in 1 way or 1 other! https://t.co/wb1tH6Zh4P

If we could change one thing about Healthcare, which option would you choose?
If you could live for an extra 10 years, would you? Surprisingly enough, more people are ready to die than there are people ready to live.
@MichelleObama Preventative Medicine... I am close to finding a way to get people interested but I need help.

@RandPaul @randpaul sooner than later, no one is going to know how to read the constitution, cursive is no longer a trait the government believes is important. We can go ahead and get rid of all other handwriting professions also
