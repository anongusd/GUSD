Yes,  we do need to protect our borders, but in a humane way and certainly that will not be done by the Racists &amp; Bigots residing in @WhiteHouse  that are looking to divert people attention from their everyday law breaking habit. https://t.co/NKKILY4kIF
Yes, it is cruel and sick to haunt wild animals just for the fun of it but you have to admit that requires certain amount of guts to go in the wild and do that which these cowards lack.

@Claude44937605 This is your tweet ‚Äú Examine her past and present point of view about America, Sharia law etc.‚Äù                     Sir!  You need to support your argument with facts not fiction.  Omar was lynched the day she spoke against AIPC and that is it.
@Claude44937605 You well know that sharia law story is nothing but an invented story, these folks do not have sharia law in their own countries let alone that they ever can impose it upon Americans or Europeans.      story invented by AIPAC &amp;NRA, promoted by @FoxNews for the gullible.
@Larry69Hanson @Claude44937605 @mzee26 Omar have much more dignity and is much more American than the puppet president and his Fraud Family.
You are full of lies and corruption no one believes a word you are saying. You and your family! #FirstFraudFamily https://t.co/LbzFBzsEHT

@SebGorka @hrw So any kind of criticism of Israel even if it is true &amp; even when Israel killing babies &amp; children you consider it to be as antisemitic.   You are using antisemitic word EXCESSIVELY!      Not to mention that you are in the foot steps of those who brought holocaust upon the Jews.
