@thehill Assuming adequate consumer protections, this long-standing bipartisan ‚Äúopen MEP‚Äù proposal should encourage broader coverage, although few expect it to have a dramatic impact.
@thehill HR 6757 does include #RESA‚Äôs provision permitting unrelated small employers to realize economies of scale by co-sponsoring a single multiple employer plan (MEP) for their employees
@thehill #RESA would do significantly more good than harm and therefore should be enacted. However, the Senate and industry proponents have been trying, to no avail, to get the House to sign on.
@thehill While 2.0 may be only a pre-election political play, its #retirement component (HR 6757 ‚Äî the Family Savings Act) is not. As part of a less conspicuous but serious legislative process, much of HR 6757 is likely to become law within a year or so.
