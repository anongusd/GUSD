The hearing was illuminating for our members who have been working on solutions to the #opioidcrisis. https://t.co/nxzROhpnFe
"In 2015 for white non-Hispanic men &amp; women aged 50 to 54 w/o a college degree who are much more seriously at risk than those w/a college degree‚Äîdeaths of despair are ~110 per 100,000. 50 are accidental overdoses, 30 are suicides, &amp; 30 are alcoholic liver disease &amp; cirrhosis.‚Äù
"The opioid deaths are the largest component, but the other two causes are not far behind.‚Äù
‚Äú...opioid deaths [are] part of a broader epidemic of rising mortality[,] deaths that we refer to as 'deaths of despair.' They consist of suicides and deaths from alcoholic liver disease as well as accidental overdoses from legal and illegal drugs.‚Äù
@POTUS Professor Sir Angus Deaton was a notable witness for this hearing because of his expertise. You can see his testimony here. Some excerpts: 		https://t.co/dAPoc5e91F https://t.co/71wVRFNAjO
@POTUS Look at this terrifying chart depicting 2015‚Äôs Opioid Overdose Death Rate by State. https://t.co/E4QZkjDqQK
@POTUS Growth in drug overdoses is driven primarily by deaths associated w/prescription &amp; illegal opioids. In 2015 white non-Hispanics accounted for 82% of opioid overdose deaths. Total drug poisoning deaths have nearly tripled since 99, &amp; in 09 surpassed traffic deaths for 1st time https://t.co/kecuhhvE2F
@POTUS The increase, argued Deaton and Anne Case, is due to a rise in drug, alcohol and suicide related deaths; they stated that the liberal prescription of opioids for pain relief fueled the epidemic. https://t.co/k2pCl61h59
@POTUS Sir Deaton argued that deaths from legal and illegal drugs are contributing to an almost unprecedented increase in overall mortality among middle-aged white non-Hispanics. A century of mortality decline came to a halt at the end of the 20th century in America. https://t.co/pKduySIG3b

@ZekeJMiller @DavidMDrucker This is a sign that they believe the economy is strong and still in the right place. Here is our Chairman‚Äôs statement: https://t.co/T8aHgb3Wou
@RepErikPaulsen "‚Ä¶Pro-growth economic policies are working.‚Äù		Note: Today, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise its interest rate target 25 basis points.
@RepErikPaulsen "After years of subpar performance, the economy grew at a 4.2% annualized rate last quarter; wages are rising, unemployment rate is its lowest since 2000; consumer confidence is at its highest since 2000; small biz optimism is its highest ever, &amp; inflation remains low &amp; stable‚Ä¶" https://t.co/DYXssEfM9L
Chairman @RepErikPaulsen released the following statement responding to the Fed‚Äôs decision to raise its interest rate target. 		"The Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision today shows its confidence in the continued strengthening of the U.S. economy‚Ä¶" https://t.co/RexVYxUFms

‚ÄúAmerica is now in one of the greatest capital construction booms from coast to coast in American history. America is "making things" again.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data show 6.5 million unfilled jobs and a shortage of workers to fill them. This is the very definition of a ‚Äútight labor market‚Äù and will likely lead to higher wages to come and bonuses to workers."
‚ÄúAmericans can feel the improvement in their financial situation. Black and Hispanic unemployment rates have hit all-time lows.‚Äù
‚ÄúThroughout the Obama years, at most about three of ten Americans rated the US economy as good or great. Today that number has rocketed to 7 of 10.‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶the total increase in economic output, according to the Congressional Budget Office is $6.1 trillion higher over the2018-27 ten year window. This will generate roughly $1.1 trillion more federal revenue and nearly $500 billion more windfall revenues for states and cities.‚Äù
‚ÄúTrump inherited an economy growing at 1.6 percent and now for the last five quarters we have 3 percent growth and for the past two quarters we have achieved over 4 percent growth.‚Äù -@StephenMoore, @Heritage Foundation
"If we want to give all Americans a chance to thrive, we should understand that the standard story is more complicated than we‚Äôve been hearing."
"The children from the poorest families ended up twice as well-off as their parents. People in the top quintile did no better or worse than their parents." https://t.co/nBgbvNxeXt
‚ÄúJulia Isaacs‚Äôs study for the Pew Charitable Trusts finds that children raised in the poorest families made the largest gains as adults relative to children born into richer families." https://t.co/Kj2m6wYxrP
"The US economy has more than doubled in real terms since 1975.‚Äù -Russel Roberts, @HooverInst
‚ÄúThe data also show how employers have been providing more paid time off, which means that earnings per hour worked is increasing more than earnings per hour paid.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe hourly amount that workers are paid can be an important indicator of economic performance and economic policies. But how wages are measured turns out to greatly affect estimates of their level and trend over time.‚Äù -Casey Mulligan, Chief Economist @WhiteHouseCEA
‚ÄúIf we allow American businesses to invest in their workers, they will invest in their workers. If we let Americans keep more of their money, they will put it to the best uses for their families and their own well-being, and our economy will thrive.‚Äù
‚ÄúAccording to a Washington Post analysis, there‚Äôs been a 3.3 percent increase in jobs for blue-collar workers in goods-producing jobs, the best rate since 1984.‚Äù
‚ÄúAmong those without high school diplomas, the unemployment rates of blacks, Hispanics, and whites have fallen 8.1, 3.8, and 3.3 percentage points, respectively.‚Äù
‚ÄúJob satisfaction is its highest since 2005 according to a survey by the Conference Board‚Äù -Chairman @RepErikPaulsen

‚ÄúInnovators working on genome editing, commercial drones, driverless cars, and the sharing economy are all finding more hospitable homes outside the regulatory purview of the United States.‚Äù
‚ÄúContinuing to apply these regimes is not only discouraging innovation, but pushing innovators to pursue better regulatory climates overseas.‚Äù
From Christopher Koopman‚Äôs testimony: 		‚ÄúThe culture of ‚Äòpermissionless innovation,‚Äô which was responsible for much of the economic growth associated with the growth of the internet, is now being stifled by old regulatory regimes.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe increasingly live in a global economy in which firms in traded industries have to compete not just for foreign markets but also those here at home. Overly rigid regulations in these industries can reduce U.S. competitive advantage.‚Äù
‚ÄúPlace more emphasis on reducing the cost of over-regulation. Regulators should actively seek input from industry and major stakeholders on ways to reduce the cost of compliance without affecting public goals.‚Äù
‚ÄúRegulators should assume technology will continue to advance. Rules should not only anticipate innovation: they should encourage it.‚Äù
‚ÄúIntelligent rules can increase the amount of competition in a market. Reduce barriers to entry, increase the flow of information, or allow new approaches to comply with existing regulations. Significantly increase productivity by speeding adoption of existing innovations.‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶regulations can either inhibit innovation or encourage it, depending upon how they are written. Good rules tend to increase the amount of public information, reduce uncertainty about future regulation, and set goals but allow flexibility in achieving them.‚Äù
‚ÄúRules that use market tools like price signals and information to fix the problem are most likely to do a better job of encouraging innovation than command and control, technology-specific rules. So is regulation that gives companies clear long-term and achievable goals.‚Äù
From Joe Kennedy, Senior Fellow of the @ITIFdc: ‚ÄúCongress and regulators need to view the problem from a dynamic viewpoint: develop rules that encourage firms to discover new ways to achieve social goals as efficiently as possible.‚Äù
The goal is to reduce by one-third the number of restrictions on businesses and individuals in Kentucky.
5.) Leave the regulation as it is currently written.
4.) Combine the regulation with other regulations to include a single subject matter, such as fees or applications, in one regulation for ease of review by those subject to it.
3.) Amend and modernize the regulation to make it clearer and simpler to understand by those subject to the regulation and also make it easier to update in the future.
2.) Amend the regulation to conform it to a federal counterpart.
1.) Completely repeal the regulation as its original purpose is no longer relevant.
‚ÄúAlthough there are many aspects to job creation, a key component of that effort is regulatory relief. As part of Kentucky's Red Tape Reduction Initiative, every Cabinet and agency has been directed to review every regulation."

An advance that can improve lives and raise productivity generally leads to higher wages‚Äîand many Americans are in dire need of that kind of prosperity.		After all, technological progress is what ultimately brings us better living standards.
Our regulations should always serve the public interest with minimum collateral damage to the economy. Where innovations are concerned, regulators shouldn‚Äôt slam the door in the face of new ideas.
Not all regulation is bad. After all, some gives job creators necessary guidance and stability in their work. When done well, sound regulation can make up for where markets fail to appreciate important public benefits or costs.		How can we stop hurting, and start helping?
U.S. leadership in the world has been based largely on technological prowess, and for it to continue, our regulations must foster innovation rather than inhibit it.		Our witnesses will discuss regulation hindering advances and even driving it away to other countries.
In Washington, regulators can put an idea to death before it is ever tried, foreclosing a future of opportunity and progress. 		We should know better. 		Americans enjoy a better quality of life today than decades ago, thanks to technological innovation.
As lawmakers, we must recognize that the only way forward is to place our trust in the American ppl, and to get out of the way. 		The private sector knows all too well how needless red tape imposes costs on businesses, increases prices for consumers, and reduces consumer choice.
From Chairman @RepErikPaulsen's opening: 		The U.S. recently dropped out of the top 10 in the 2018 Bloomberg Innovation Index. 		We were at 9, and now we are at 11. 		Such news is a call to action. America‚Äôs tradition of invention has been at the heart of our economic strength.

Finally, @HFurchtgottRoth argues that despite "early receptivity to the Internet, governments in other countries today are threatening the further development of the information sector."
More @HFurchtgottRoth: "The United States played a pivotal role in innovation in the information sector. Important factors included: increased protection of property rights; a lighter regulatory approach; and an emphasis on competition."
@HFurchtgottRoth testified as well saying that, "Global economic growth in the past generation has been more profound than any in prior history, and innovation in the information sector was at the core of that growth.‚Äù
Yet @MichaelRStrain notes the threats posed by imprudent regulation, which can stifle innovation, slowing economic growth and the rate of improvement of living standards.

The overall debt burden is little changed. @USCBO projects a debt-to-GDP ratio for 2027 only 5.5 percentage pts higher than its January 2017 estimate. 		Compare that to the 24.2 percentage point increase from Obama‚Äôs 1st year to end of 2017. https://t.co/7leGdHpXtm
@USCBO projects there will be 2.6 million more jobs by 2027.	üöÄ	2.6 million.	üöÄ	More. 	üöÄ	Jobs.	üöÄ	It credits #TaxCutsandJobsAct for 1.1 million additional jobs on average over the forecast period.		Those new jobs likely will accrue largely to those who have not gone to college. https://t.co/PvtlQzOu8A
Check out this chart: It shows that @USCBO raised Q4-2017 to Q4-2018 real GDP growth from 2.0% to 3.3% despite many claiming 3% growth was no longer possible. 		The growth projection doesn't account for ongoing policy reform efforts such as in regulation &amp; infrastructure. #TaxDay https://t.co/5wdjQg08nF

Meanwhile, pro-growth policies of this Congress and Administration #TaxReform, raised the projected debt-to-GDP ratio by a mere 3.3 percentage points. 		Solving America‚Äôs debt issue requires mandatory spending reform; higher tax rates aren‚Äôt the answer.		https://t.co/OUufFZlfON?
Concerns about an ‚Äúexplosion of debt‚Äù due to #TaxReform are substantially overblown. The previous Administration &amp; Dem Congress reduced the economy‚Äôs potential &amp; increased the debt-to-GDP ratio by 31 percentage points relative to initial CBO projections.		https://t.co/OUufFZlfON?
According to CBO‚Äôs 2018 Budget and Economic Outlook, the US economy‚Äôs estimated economic potential was revised upward for the 1st time after being revised downward every year since *2008* 		It also noted that 3.5% growth over the next 5 yrs is possible. 		https://t.co/OUufFZlfON?
Our friend @LarryKudlow criticized CBO today as "always wrong, esp w/regard to tax cuts, which they never score properly because they don't understand the growth, the incentives and the encouragements to reward success.‚Äù Fortunately, CBO has some good news in their recent report.
