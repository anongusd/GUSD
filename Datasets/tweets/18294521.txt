@ChrisALadd “W. A. Criswell, in a discussion of racial integration, stated that he expressed astonishment at the cowardice of ministers “whose forebears [sic] and predecessors were martyrs and were burned at the stake” but who themselves refuse to speak up about “this thing of integration.” https://t.co/dXGOvufqzA
“Criswell’s bizarre formula, as it metastasized and took hold elsewhere, could allow white nationalists to continue their campaign as a “culture war” long after the battle to protect segregated institutions had been lost.“   — @ChrisALadd https://t.co/aXmb1cp972

In a passage that managed to avoid explicit racism, he described what would become the primary political weapon of the culture wars.” https://t.co/OxOiLdH4bQ
“Don’t force me by law, by statute, by Supreme Court decision…to cross over in those intimate things where I don’t want to go.“		 — Pastor Criswell, Present of the Southern Baptist Convention 		#JimCrow #CivilRights https://t.co/Rn87eDZTQO

“The rise of the religious right is usually credited to abortion activism, but few evangelicals cared about the subject in the 70’s. The Southern Baptist Convention expressed support for laws liberalizing abortion access in 1971.” 		— Chris Ladd https://t.co/M03sHDYIw5

who rebuilt the Democratic Party and seized control of southern state governments by brutally suppressing black voters and eliminating the power of the Republican Party below the Mason-Dixon line. 	https://t.co/uPNXxpLkmC
In the decade after the 1876 presidential election, the Republican-dominated state governments in the South, which had provided the basis for black political participation during Reconstruction, were undermined by former Confederates and their sympathizers who rebuilt the ...
by the 1890s party leaders were in agreement that Republicans needed southern white voters more than they needed southern black voters. “Equalitarian ideals,” explained a leading historian, “had to be sacrificed to the exigencies of practical politics.”	 https://t.co/QIpdDfAetL
Gradually, African-American leaders at the national level began to abandon their loyalty to the GOP. While the party’s political strategy of creating a competitive wing in the postwar South was not incompatible with the promotion of black civil rights,
Through political factions such as the “lily white” movement, which excluded blacks, and “black and tan” societies, which extended only token political roles to African Americans, the party ceased to serve as an outlet for the politically active cadre of southern black voters.
Weakened to the point of irrelevancy, southern Republicans after 1900 embraced Jim Crow as a way to curry favor with the political power structure. They abandoned black voters in order to preserve their grasp on issues as basic as  patronage jobs dispensed by the national party.

Charlottesville's African Americans had been very active in Republican party politics at the turn of the century.

Daily Progress article, "NEGROES AGAIN BARRED FROM G.O.P. CONVENTION." Reported the dismissal of the Cox delegation and the seating of Flannagan's "lily-white" delegation. https://t.co/0CxQVTc5li
One, led by R.N. Flannagan (President of the Henry Anderson Independent Club), was all white. The other, led by City Chairman L.W. Cox, included four African Americans. The convention decided to dismiss the Cox delegation and seat the "lily-white" faction of Charlottesville.
The African-American Republican leaders felt the full effects of the "lily white" movement when they, along with their delegation, were barred from the Republican Congressional Convention held at Luray in July, 1922. Charlottesville sent two delegations to this convention.
The Republican party proclaimed that it was a white man's party and had no room to accomodate African Americans. In "WILL IT WORK," published August 13, 1900, The Daily Progress questioned the feasibility and fairness of excluding African Americans from the Republican Party.
