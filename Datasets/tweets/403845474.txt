Since I have been elected the applicant pool has become less diverse.  We must make sure these opportunities are available for all Minnesotans, not just the wealthy. This is crucial to our future workforce.
As someone who had to work my way through school, an unpaid internship was not an option for me and many of my friends. The cost of education has risen dramatically over the last 20 years, making this even more challenging for many students.
If you divide $147k by 70 (average number of interns), each intern could make about $2000 a session, about $15 an hour.
If the Senate is paying the Lt. Governor’s $147k legal bill, then we should be having a conversation about paying our interns. #mnleg https://t.co/qJCg5E9L52
