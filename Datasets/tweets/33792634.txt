@yashar @PreetBharara I'm not recommending it, but there is a netherworld of people who specialize in gaming the system, and I'm pretty sure they focus most of their attention on sales after the book's release date.
@yashar @PreetBharara I hear you. But getting TV bookers/producers to pay attention (if not well known prior) is only possible by moving Amazon. My advice would be, in a perfect world, to mobilize your fans/followers to buy on the same day or two, likely the day book is released. Like a film opening.
@PreetBharara @yashar Preet: For you this doesn't matter: your book will sail onto the list. For lesser knowns, buying a book when others are buying too pushes it up Amazon's lists bc it is tracking momentum of sales, literally by the minute. DM &amp; I'll explain.
@yashar The best shot of pushing your fav author onto Amazon's lists is likely in the first day or two of its release when hopefully others are also buying. Your incremental purchase could be the deciding factor in getting on Amazon's lists, which are counted in REAL-TIME.
@yashar Not sure I totally agree with this, especially if you're recommending pre-orders on Amazon. For helping sales generally, you‚Äôre right. But if you‚Äôre trying to push your fav author onto Amazon‚Äôs best-lists, which propel even more sales, momentum + velocity of sales matters a lot.

@decklap @GregJKrieg @AOC I‚Äôve repeatedly said I wish incentives didn‚Äôt exist. (Read my feed.) But if you gave me the binary choice between offering an incentive that creates meaningful jobs or getting no jobs, the choice, to me, is clear.
@GregJKrieg You cover @AOC, right? "If we were willing to give away away $3 billion for this deal, we could invest $3 billion in our district ourselves if we want to. We could hire more teachers, we can fix our subways, we can put a lot of people to work for that money if we wanted to."
@chasingwaterme1 @owillis I have long sought a major revamp of the tax code so it can‚Äôt be gamed.
@mehughes124 Those companies are located in Manhattan. The goal was to bring a major tech company to Long Island City, a place that for decades has sought a major anchor tenant and been unable to attract one. That‚Äôs why it is the capital of NYC parking lots for taxicabs.

@MrRabble The Foxconn deal was terribly crafted. The Amazon one, assuming it wasn‚Äôt later renegotiated, actually has teeth.
There is a financial literacy epidemic in America. 		Quick lesson: NYC wasn‚Äôt handing cash to Amazon. It was an incentive program based on job creation, producing tax revenue. 		There isn‚Äôt a $3 billion pile of money that can now be spent on subways or education.
@PoliticsPoorly Let me leave this with you: The tax code is a mess and needs to be fixed. It has been corrupted by lobbyists and special interests. We must fix it.  I‚Äôve been writing about this for years.
@NatalieElsberg Totally agree. Subsidies shouldn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôd probably outlaw them if I could (though that would hurt the most vulnerable areas without attractive Econ/Edu ecosystems.) For NY, it was a missed opp at revenue for schools, subways, police, etc.
@yeleajay @amazon Let‚Äôs hope.
@AliceAlch6 @TheBubbleBubble ‚ÄúWell crafted‚Äù in that the incentives were not front loaded. Amazon had to produce the jobs to capture the incentives. Here is a good explainer: https://t.co/mFzWtfoid5
@FWC_Rift @ERattner1 NYC will be fine. But it is a missed opportunity.
@bardsilfan The missed opportunity is for Long Island City. Companies happily locate in Manhattan w/o subsidies. But, at least thus far, they haven‚Äôt been clamoring to move to Long Island City. As financial industry contracts, attracting tech companies to diversify NYC revenue base is key.
I would love to do away with subsidies for businesses, but the reality is they exist. Unlike many sweetheart deals, the one for Amazon was well crafted and would have created meaningful jobs and revenue for NYC. https://t.co/LwZn6WnDVv

Thiel: "On the record, I am not a vampire"		#dealbook
Thiel thinks there haven't been many breakthroughs in consumer internet businesses #dealbook
Thiel thinks the Democrats badly overplayed their hand re allegations that Trump is tied to the Russians. He also thinks he'll support Trump in 2020. #dealbook
Q: Do you think the economy is set to boom in 2020?	Thiel: I do, actually.
Q: You don't think this president demagogues any more than his predecessors?	Thiel: No. (And the nicknames, like "Low-energy Jeb," are incredibly accurate)
On polarization, Thiel says it's not healthy -- but thinks Trump isn't the main cause. "Not even remote[ly]"
Thiel thinks Obama and W both lied -- about ACA and being able to keep your doctor, and the Iraq war -- and that whatever lies Trump has told are not any bigger

When asked about 2 former Goldman bankers being charged in relation to the 1MDB Malaysian corruption scandal, Blankfein tells #dealbook conference: "When we see bad behavior, we jump on it."		Pressed, he adds that it appears a former banker lied and evaded firm controls
Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, speaking about the differences between him and his successor, David Solomon:		"He's a DJ. I'm a JD."		#dealbook
Q: Was Cohn ever really your successor?	Blankfein: The job was not up for grabs at that time.
Q: How do you look at Gary Cohen's tenure in Washington?	Blankfein: I think he was imbued by the same spirit as my last 5 predecessors. ... I think he was a dollar-a-year guy. ... On the whole, I think it was wholly positive for the stuff he got done
Blankfein says Goldman isn't incentivizing employees to go into government service -- the firm just removes the punitive aspect of doing so. (He's trying to counter the perception of Goldman promoting "Government Sachs" -- ie, the revolving door)
About those post-financial crisis bonuses: Blankfein says "it would have been a helluva lot worse if we lost the essence of our staff" because they didn't get paid
"In the absence of us defining what the firm does ... people filled that in." 		Blankfein saying that Goldman bore a burden of not being well-known.

Pichai: "I think it's important that the US invests in AI" -- but there's global development of AI. "Based on what I can see coming out of China, there's impressive" work there as well.		But is this an AI race? Pichai says he doesn't view things through that lens.
Quoted Pence's comments demanding that Google stop work on its Chinese work, Project Dragonfly, Pichai says, first there are more companies doing work in China than we are. And we're happy to coordinate with the US government if need be
Asked about Google's work on China, Pichai says Google is always exploring things. "Our mission is to sell things to the world"
Q about James Damore: How do you balance that position with the culture?	Pichai: "At the company we allow a lot of people to speak up, but we still have a code of conduct."
Pichai compares the decision not to pursue the Jedi AI contract with the Pentagon to geneticists drawing lines at genetic engineering
Pichai: "We do work with the military. ... We're committed to doing that." Adds that the military "protects us." And also, "It's a bit of a misunderstanding to say we won't work with the military."		But when it comes to AI, there are others who can provide these services [to DOD]

@Redheadretreat I hear you. It is not that I won't ever be satisfied. In this instance, the Ethics office of US just said it's problematic
@satex At most established news orgs, there are stringent policies on things like stock ownership.
@countryman100 @kevcirilli agreed. See my next tweets.
@satex If I run for office, sure. Public deserves it. But you don't have to read my articles or tweets or watch on TV if you don't want.
@QuantTrader You are right. Let's see. But my sense is that if he planned robust disclosure, it would have made sense to announce that.
When I suggested Trump get a corp monitor in my column last month, I wanted monitor to regularly write report to public. This isn't that.
@amandbrar agreed. See my next tweet on disclosure!
ICYMI: Trumps plan to donate foreign profits &amp; hire ethics adviser is good idea ONLY if there is disclosure for public accountability!
@jtl2000 you are right. see my next tweet. we need disclosure
@ChairmanF85 agreed. read the tweet I sent next!
@jkjdixon you're right. disclosure is needed. that was my next tweet
@gmsheehan yep. see my next tweet. you nailed the prob
@thehowie agreed. see next tweet
@DaveHormell1 agreed. see my next tweet
@Thabiso_XT see my next tweet!
The problem w/Trump's plan to donate foreign profits remains issue of disclosure. Public needs full disclosure for accountability + trust
Trump's plan to donate all profits from foreign money received by Trump Org is a unique and seemingly promising idea.
Trump Org's appointment of ethics adviser+compliance counsel is good  step. But only if the public trusts them. More disclosure would help.
Trump Org to appoint Ethics Adviser + Chief Compliance Counsel. Sounds a bit like corporate monitor. My prior column https://t.co/L6E5E5lDqX
@Capitol_Finance You're presuming these execs want to sell stock and buy treasuries. Only then is it a benifit.

@rubinoftoronto Let's agree to disagree on this one.
@rubinoftoronto When she first got hired, yes. Then she bought off the activist directors + filled board with her picks. Crony capitalism
@emilynussbaum So deserving! Huge congrats.
@rubinoftoronto You're missing the point. Anybody could have been CEO + its value would have increased because of the Alibaba stake.

@ptucker516 @MakingAMurderer BTW: Based on what I've read, they left stuff out. But dunno if it would change how u feel when it is over.
@ptucker516 @MakingAMurderer Dunno if he's guilty or not. But maybe beside the point. It's an eye opening look at criminal justice system.
@ptucker516 @MakingAMurderer Saw it already. Amazing. Loved it. Can't stop thinking about it.

.@timmullaney @mashbusiness Dunno if Bobby would play. The odds aren't in his favor. And he cares about the odds. But the payoff is big!
.@mashbusiness Q11. First : Honesty and integrity matter. Second:  Don‚Äôt get too greedy. Third: Ask this q of Bobby Axelrod! #Billions
@JohnBanksJr @mashbusiness @mindmeister @evernote evernote is great! i use scannable
.@dpinsen @mashbusiness happy to talk #billions. what can i tell you?
.@mashbusiness Q10. Great q. If you can comfortably afford the debt payments, better to take the loan. But that's hard for most startups.
@vikngws what do you mean?
@CaptainKinnard @mashbusiness not horrible, but def harder...hey @jack..feature idea!
.@mashbusiness Q9. The advantage is capital and being on the public stage. The disadvantage is being on the public stage. #BizChats
@iamdaviddoswell @mashbusiness love em. it's a strange obsession, i know. i've tried every flavor. i buy them by the box.
.@mashbusiness @Samantha_Fong Q8. Investing in managers and infrastructure even when it feels too early. It's hard to be big w/o them.
.@mashbusiness typo! i meant "discipline."
.@mashbusiness Q7. Everyone says being private is better. But I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe early on. Being public brings disciple ‚Äì and capital
@virali007 @mashbusiness i doubt the pivot is now on renewables. it's take another decade...or many...
.@mashbusiness Q6. Your most important relationship may be with your lawyer. Not a good place to skimp. I'm serious. #BizChats
.@mashbusiness Q5. By the way, on the RxBars, I'm addicted to blueberry and pumpkin.
.@mashbusiness Q5. Also, I'm now into https://t.co/ufXzCRxPGQ for handwritten cards
.@mashbusiness Q5. Can‚Äôt live w/o my iPhone, TripIt, Boomerang Calendar, Uber, UP band, Buffer, Spotify, Texture &amp; RxBars!
.@mashbusiness Q4. Politely :)
.@mashbusiness Q3. Right now? Old school energy. Everything on sale‚Ä¶can‚Äôt stay that way forever. Also: Fintech. Banks will be disrupted.
.@mashbusiness Q2. Totally depends. Hoof it as long as you can. But don't wait to take money just when you need it. It might not be there.
@mashbusiness Q1. Angel investing is so much harder. We‚Äôre closer to 9th inning than 1st. Fundraising, my guess, will trail downward in 16.

@ShoelessJoe1910 @ddayen  and us govt was backstopping bear deal. aig deal wld req chinese govt apprvl. not happening.
@ShoelessJoe1910 @ddayen no. jpm knew bear well + 60 hrs to study. hard to say chinese knew aig as well. chinese would have had 8 hrs, tops.
@ddayen it's preposterous chinese would have bought aig w/no diligence within hrs of bankruptcy. that's all greenberg has to sell public!
@ddayen remember: paulson knew chinese. they had done no diligence. if u need proof it wldnt have happened, see MS days later. they walked
@ddayen quick public answer: all these supposed "approaches" by china or middle east never would have turned into deals. and not in time.
@ddayen cool (on the cousin part.)
@ddayen ok...to be continued...
@ddayen the Dinallo opportunity didn't cover the hole, not by a longshot
@ddayen the chinese "interest" was bogus...a dozen "investors" went thru aig at the end and no one ponied up.
@ddayen what's new? we knew aig was denied bank holding co status.
@ddayen you agree "Greenberg is not a reliable narrator" right?
@ddayen there's no game changer in there. everyone's looking for new answers because nobody likes the current answers.
@ddayen hardly. whatever info was produced was either known or doesn't change the basic facts.
@RBtrageur @tyillc @Chris_arnade @eisingerj interesting. For my money, I think the risk element is the one to watch but I take your point.
@RBtrageur @tyillc @Chris_arnade @eisingerj I meant it sincerely. Which bank did u think was more competent than GS?
@RBtrageur @tyillc @Chris_arnade @eisingerj Which firm did u think was MORE competent?

@ArnottACBJ @hamiltonnolan yes, i read him all the time. yet i understand what you're talking about. sorry.

@JoshRosner I hear you. Not bowing out. Just have to go to sleep. Past my bedtime. Let's get a drink soon.
@JoshRosner @NYFed Maybe so. It doesn't have to be an either or. I pick all of the above.
@JoshRosner If only it was all his fault. It is more complicated. He was one of many who missed it. That point is well established. Gnight.
@JoshRosner I suspect he gets lumped into that group but maybe not.
@JoshRosner We are in agreement on this point. He failed in his role pre-crisis.
@JoshRosner Having said that, he helped keep us from toppling over. The question is how history will judge the totality of him
@JoshRosner Those are very much his failings. He missed the crisis in advance and he gave away a lot on the other side.
@JoshRosner His bias was always immediate "confidence" -- anything he thought could impact it, even temporarily, he thought was bad
@JoshRosner He would say, I think, that he was worried they wouldn't be able to raise matching funds &amp; that would undermine confidence.
@JoshRosner Sadly, that's exactly right.  Geithner says as much in the book.
@BillGriffeth @Kelly_Evans @CNBCClosingBell Love it but too slow
@zerohedge I'm not sure either are true. He said he reluctantly took Treasury but I quoted Rahm saying opposite. And he wanted Warburg gig.

@retheauditors mixed message problem: "distressed babies" were one example of aol's healthcare costs, not entire reason for 401k switch
@HFBondsTrader my understanding is was he was told abt the medical costs at a finance meeting
@HFBondsTrader no. it would have been easy. but they have 5k employees so not monitoring every medical issue.
@robbm02 from a policy perceptive, probably better for employers not to know the names, right?
