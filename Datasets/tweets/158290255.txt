[*Sheriff] #RantingCausesTypos
The kicker: 		‚ÄúBecause the jury found that [the Sherrif] was only 1% responsible, THE VERDICT WAS REDUCED TO $0.04 CENTS, and then, because the jury found that Hill was drunk at the time, THE FINAL PAYOUT WAS NOTHING.‚Äù 		(emphasis and endless screaming mine.) #BLM #ThisIsAmerica
People have lost all sense of compassion. Awarding this family $4 is crueler than offering them nothing. 		Oh but wait, it gets worse!
‚ÄúHill's oldest child... who was 9 at the time... sat on a bench at the school across the street as the encounter unfolded. She testified that her dad's hands were empty.‚Äù		BUT AT LEAST THE JURY GAVE HER FOUR DOLLARS FOR HER TRAUMA! #ThisIsAmerica #BLM @Drake
‚Äú[Police] indicated loudly that Hill had a gun and then the garage door closed. Despite the door being closed, Newman fired his handgun approximately four times and killed Hill... Once inside, officers found Hill dead with an unloaded handgun in his back pocket, not his hand.‚Äù
‚ÄúCity law prohibits ‚Äòunnecessary noise‚Äô and provides that offenders get a warning on the first offense in 24 hours and a citation on the second. A third complaint may result in a misdemeanor charge. This was Hill's first.‚Äù		And now he‚Äôs dead. Some fucking warning. #BLM

Conclusion: ‚Äú#RapeCulture directs women to police their clothing, beverages, behavior, and sexuality at all times to avoid men. It portrays men as powerless against their violent sexual urges. Rape culture demeans everyone, and everyone should speak out against rape culture.‚Äù
‚Äú5. Don‚Äôt forget: Honesty is the best policy. When asking someone out, don‚Äôt pretend that you are interested in them as a person. Tell them straight up that you expect to be raping them later. #rapepreventiontips
‚Äú4. Carry a rape whistle. If you find that you are about to rape someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you.  #rapepreventiontips
‚Äú3. Use the Buddy System! If it is difficult for you to stop yourself from raping someone, ask a trusted friend to accompany you at all times. #rapepreventiontips
‚Äú2. When you see someone walking by themselves, leave them alone. #rapepreventiontips

Had to walk 6 blocks to get a cab, but when I finally got one, he gave me a cigarette to smoke in the car. There is justice in the world.
Dear New York City, I just endured a NINE HOUR @Amtrak ride to get to you. Let's make this weekend worth it. #amtrakdelay #amtrakistan
After NINE HOURS on the train, we are FINALLY arriving in NY!!!! #ohhappyday #amtrakistan #salvation #amtrakdelay

There aren't even seats for all the passengers we picked up in Philly. The quiet car resembles a refugee camp. #amtrakdelay #amtrakistan

Still haven't left Philly. Tons of new passengers came out of nowhere. Quiet Car is no more. Chaos ensues. #amtrakistan

@AustinSchindel Mutiny is the only option.
NOW WE'RE CHANGING CONDUCTORS? AND SWITCHING FROM "EXPRESS" TO LOCAL SERVICE?!? Fuck this noise. @Amtrak you're dead to me.

@jonathanmaster Yes. But wait until I tell you about the loud drunk couple in the quiet car, who are no longer in the quiet car. #likeaboss
@jonathanmaster I've been taken hostage by @Amtrak. I'm now a resident of #amtrakistan. @Max_Fisher will be the leader of the rebellion.
6.5 hours later, and we are JUST pulling into Philly. They say 1.5 more hours until NYC, but I don't know what's true anymore. #amtrakistan
"I feel like I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship with the train. It teases me and gives me hope, but it inevitably lets me down."

Calling @Amtrak customer service in the morning and demanding a refund. Very likely I will make the call while still on this train.

6 hours deep. Still on the train, and barely over halfway there. #thisismadness #amtrakproblems @Amtrak get your shit together.
Aaaand the conductor has now gotten involved and is removing the loud drunk couple from the quiet car. #victoryismine #quietcarmeansquiet
