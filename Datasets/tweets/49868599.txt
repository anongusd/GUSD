@BlackDickNixon3 Agreed. Good find on the transcript.
@BlackDickNixon3 No, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that. Speaker Paul Ryan basically told him to stop talking immediately. Okay, I am no longer confused.
“If Crimea or election interference were important enough, the summit wouldn’t even be happening.” https://t.co/6J1RT9h6Vv
@BlackDickNixon3 You agree with Speaker Ryan because he stopped McCarthy from elaborating? Or because Ryan begged for the comments to be kept secret? I’m confused.
@Dianne658 @PhilippeReines I love that you’re speaking of him in the past tense (tick tock). Tomorrow will be wild.
@_Kevin_USA @FoxNews @BarackObama I loathe Hillary, but I’ve not felt compelled to leave the Democrat party because of her, despite her winning the popular vote (yuck) and “leading” the party until she conceded. In any case, we are talking about one person (Obama) when it is about the party’s platform.
@_Kevin_USA @FoxNews @BarackObama That makes about as much sense as Republicans leaving the GOP just because Trump is a disgrace. I don’t/wouldn’t buy that claim.
@FoxNews @BarackObama I miss him so much.

Two weeks before his inauguration, Trump knew (for a fact) that Putin had personally ordered the 2016 election hacks. The evidence was indisputable, and Trump was described as having been “grudgingly convinced” of Putin’s role. https://t.co/JT5X2quHUL
