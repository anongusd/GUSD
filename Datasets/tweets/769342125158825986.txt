@resurgent @EWErickson True, in between lying about the size of his crowd and the crime rates of El Paso over the last 15 last years, he did tell the truth about Gov. Northam.
@AnnCoulter Because you finally see he doesn‚Äôt care as much about these conservative positions as he presented to. The dude wanted to build a hotel in Moscow and who knows where else right now. He had no intention of actually winning. Lol. This ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù was, to his mind, just a long deal.
@NoahCRothman Why can‚Äôt you just take the win...? This is great politicking by Mitch McConnell. Stop being THAT guy. It‚Äôs terribly annoying.
@NoahCRothman Okay? There is absolutely no need to bring this up for a vote except to highlight the moderates from the far left of the Democratic Party. With the goal being to weaken moderates in the primary.
@NoahCRothman Like seriously? Are you going to sit here and with a straight face and try to pretend like you don‚Äôt clearly see this as a tactic to separate the moderates from the left. Positioning the folks best positioned to beat Trump to either tack left or face pressure from the dem. base.
@NoahCRothman It‚Äôs good politics, doesn‚Äôt mean it is right. This is what I don‚Äôt get/like about you man. You‚Äôre too smart to need to be so smug. Mitch McConnell never put a bill on the floor that he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to pass. The only reason he‚Äôs doing this is to divide the dem. party.

If Democrats want to find success in the midterms and in 2020 they need to learn first and foremost how to capture And more importantly maintain the attention Of folks who currently support their overall mission.
My overall point is that Our president looks at turning out the vote the same way he looks at marketing the opening of a new hotel. I‚Äôve not heard any analysis on how many people are even aware when their primary or general is held during the midterms.
I mean let‚Äôs put this in perspective; how many times did you spend an entire segment discussing how Barack Obama was going to a rally. How many times have you discussed that with regards to President Trump.
Who knows how the 2010 mid terms would‚Äôve gone if Barack Obama tweeted every single day and always went to rallies where he had the strongest support and always attacked FOXNews and the entire other side as not being truthful etc...
I don‚Äôt think you guys realize how many people simply just don‚Äôt know what is happening. Folks who consider themselves liberal, conservative, or independent. Just like any good marketer trumps biggest asset is being able to keep the attention of his supporters.
Take this family separation issue for instance. We look at all these polls and see who supports and doesn‚Äôt support this policy, but we don‚Äôt poll what % is even aware of this policy. MSNBC and CNN and ABC News and CBS News and NBC News have a total reach of 10 million people max
This is almost a bigger reason ‚Äî in my opinion ‚Äî for the Democrats then the actual support on the other side. Especially in mid terms it‚Äôs going to be more about who can turn their base out; not who can win over more of the populace per se.
We saw this is specially playing out in 2016, where Clinton got killed in terms of turned out in Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Detroit. She carries Barack Obama‚Äôs numbers and she wins definitely Pennsylvania and probably Michigan.
@SteveKornacki Your last guest brought up a very very very important point. Republicans Seem to be able to overlook the shortcomings of their person in office and continue to support them. Democrats are a lot more easy to dissuade from voting altogether...

@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin I own a business just like you, I would rather pay lower taxes just like you; but I‚Äôm not unrealistic. We can‚Äôt have our cake and eat it too. We can‚Äôt have unlivable wages ‚Äîwhich leads to only half the country paying taxes‚Äîwhile cutting taxes on everyone else.
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin But even taking your point How has an all republic DC decreased our spending or our long-term deficits? This is what I mean even if we take your point all the Republicans did this past year is passing PERMANENT budget of over $1 trillion; something Obama never did.
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin We finally got it back to a deficit similar to pre-recession and now through the tax cuts and a huge budget we are back to nearly $700 billion annual deficit. https://t.co/wxf3Vbaiho
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin What are you talking about? Tax revenues technically get higher every single year as the country grows. In terms of net increase when you adjust for inflation, population growth it is declining. https://t.co/HGInOJyH72
He‚Äôs trying to provide a context to the larger point that there are things that aren‚Äôt explicitly said in the constitution that are commonly understood to be either unjust or illegal. Pardonig yourself being one of those ‚Äúcliffhangers‚Äù.

@lauferlaw @realDonaldTrump Ew, what a crass and unnecessary comment. Sad because you have such a good point in terms of under cutting trumps claim that he has never met or barely knows Felix Sater.
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin Increase *^
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin Okay but you have both houses and the presidency yet budget cuts are not taking place. That is just a talking point. Raising the minimum wage would Increased federal tax revenues without having to raise taxes on anyone.
@Neil_Irwin Explain *
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin ?
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin Good point, I will give that to you. Trump doesn‚Äôt have much effect on federal interest rates but overall I don‚Äôt really see what he has done for the economy that jives well with fiscal conservatives.
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin ‚ÄîThose deficits were primarily caused by the Great Recession and were temporary. By contrast, the trillion-dollar Trump deficits are permanent changes to the federal budget outlook caused by enacted reductions in revenues and increases in spending.‚Äù		Am I not seeing something?
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin https://t.co/AasCmAkmhY		‚ÄúFor the record (and before the trolls come out to play), there were indeed four consecutive trillion-dollar federal deficits during the Obama administration from fiscal 2009-12‚Äî
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin ... in his bullshit you don‚Äôt even realize that Mr. Trump is not a fiscal conservative. He may be a cultural conservative now; but he never was and never will be a fiscal conservative.
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin https://t.co/qsf0Ez9vGd 		But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre fine paying more at the pump, with a president whom just passed a $1 trillion dollar budget, because we can say we pulled out of the Iran deal. This is the probably with voting on ideologically lines buddy. You‚Äôre so wrapped up...
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin And on oil specifically... I‚Äôve never heard somebody refer to themselves as a fiscal conservative yet be so clueless about global economics. Venezuelan sanctions plus withdrawing from the JCPOA has led to not enough output for our consumer and commercial demand.
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin https://t.co/nAJAhn7FfA there is nothing new or special about these job figures yet there‚Äôs an incredibly new narrative that is constructed whenever under a republican president.
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin Furthermore, my point wasn‚Äôt that Donald Trump has a direct effect on those things ‚ÄîI never once said that... I was talking about Mr. Irwin‚Äôs reaction to Trump and Obama‚Äôs economic outlook... and more pertinently the double standard he has taken.
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin Just sayin‚Äô
@CrackenDick @Neil_Irwin Um... If you don‚Äôt think that the hand-picked Federal Reserve chair of Donald Trump and his decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal doesn‚Äôt have an effect on both the fed rates and oil prices you shouldn‚Äôt be commenting on this tweet.

@aisnabi24 @RepLeeZeldin which included the final four months of Obama's term and the first eight months of Trump's presidency.‚Äù Just saying, deportation is different than apprehensions. If we want to fix our immigration system in this country, we need to start with immigration courts...
@aisnabi24 @RepLeeZeldin ‚ÄúYet these deportation totals pale in comparison to the removal numbers of the early Obama administration. ICE deportations under Obama peaked at 409,849 in fiscal 2012 ‚Äì nearly double the agency's deportations during fiscal 2017,

Once the DACA + WALL bill is on the ground it will be the senate‚Äôs responsibility to pass the second bill ‚Äîat least through committee. It may be tough, but with the right touch you could get that broader package back to the house and passed by summer. (leaving 6/8 wks for some

I completely understand that administration would worry that getting one bill would be hard enough, let alone another. Yet, I think this could have found a creative way around. Specifically, they should‚Äôve drafted and released both stages at once. #thecarrotandthestick
I am always reminded to what I believe was the biggest policy blunder the president has made so far, renegading on the idea of two immigration bills; one for DACA + Wall/Border Security, and another for larger immigration reforms.

For reporting on his observations that this guy has an orange face with white circles in the middle of his head. If our president is going to make himself look like a buffoon people ought to be able to report on that when they‚Äôre in a conversation with him.

@NicoleVedEnvy @sarahkendzior @NateSilver538 But he has every right to do so, and He is not stupid enough to jeopardize the ongoing federal investigation.
@NicoleVedEnvy @sarahkendzior @NateSilver538 I love how everybody in this country loves to gripe about the freedom of speech and what not and then when somebody tries to actually exercise it with some courage they get shot down. You can think He is sanctimonious, and you can think he‚Äôs completely out of step to do this.
@NicoleVedEnvy @sarahkendzior @NateSilver538 No, you are exactly correct. Furthermore there‚Äôs no way in hell that Comey didn‚Äôt clear this with federal investigators before publishing this book, tell this to Mueller‚Äôs team are year ago or whenever he asked, and has every legal right to speak about it.
@sarahkendzior @NicoleVedEnvy @NateSilver538 Again you make no sense. You have no idea when and what he told Mueller but I‚Äôm sure it was a lot more than what‚Äôs in his book and a lot sooner. We should be picking our battles right now

You may not like the guy but I hate people just casually throwing around terms like breaking federal protocol.
@NateSilver538 What are you talking about? I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs precisely what you do.

I hated this during the 2016 election when talking about the Clinton investigation, and I hate it now. Everybody should just shut up and wait for him to finish. Then you can judge whether or not his findings are plausible or not.

@caitoz @grnmedina_chris @shoptb1 @AlongsideWild @jeffgiesea @ggreenwald We don‚Äôt know explicitly that he‚Äôs not still under investigation, for all we know this could have tipped him, or more importantly his associates, off. By now they will have immediately purged their devices for fear of software bugs/other IT surveillance.
@caitoz @grnmedina_chris @shoptb1 @AlongsideWild @jeffgiesea @ggreenwald And when I said timelines timelines timelines, I am pointing out that the fact he was under surveillance for a year pokes a hole in the entire basis for this memo and bolsters the reason why this is dangerous to release to the public.

@Mmarie2539 @webclam @shoptb1 @caitoz @AlongsideWild @jeffgiesea @ggreenwald A Specific number of people. That is why the FBI director has come out with such frustration against this being released.

And most of the leaks are coming from the defense lawyers of the targets of this investigation.
@Mmarie2539 @the_lowdownz @webclam @shoptb1 @caitoz @AlongsideWild @jeffgiesea @ggreenwald Leaking information that is confidential is much different than forcing information that is classified regarding an ongoing investigation
@the_lowdownz @Mmarie2539 @webclam @shoptb1 @caitoz @AlongsideWild @jeffgiesea @ggreenwald Please look at my response to Marie, I go through this clearly. Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right, but regardless Devon Nunez did not even read the underlying evidence complete farcical to say that he could‚Äôve just leaked it.
@Mmarie2539 @webclam @shoptb1 @caitoz @AlongsideWild @jeffgiesea @ggreenwald Cute, @Mmarie2539 Unfortunately you‚Äôre wrong.
