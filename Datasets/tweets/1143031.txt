@tferriss @Jason that was an important post - am sure it touched a lot of people. Have found recently when I've 'gone there' that it similarly is well worth it.
@mnathani may have been a momentary glitch - seems up here now
@KellyDunning Thanks Kelly - I appreciate that what I do has helped. Thanks for your encouragement. Glad you're finding the reading and exercise are helping!

5/5		The battle continues but I'm finding myself in a much better place.		If you're struggling - you're not alone.		If I had to pick a place to start it would be to tell someone ( doctor, family member or a friend). 		I hope something in this is of encouragement to you!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
4/5		8. reading fiction (for fun) and non-fiction ( for learning)	9. creating new projects (builds anticipation/hope)	10. volunteering (giving back, focusing upon others, not just myself)	11. prayer/meditation
3/5		5. telling friends + family, asking them to check in on me (amazed how many others shared they had similar battles)	6. improving my diet (more ‚Äòreal‚Äô natural food, less sugar and processed crap)	7. journalling (gratitude, affirmations, positive thinking, processing feelings)
2/5 		1. talking to my Doctor	2. being prescribed a small dose of meds to help find my feet	3. exercise (daily walking and lifting weights 2x a week)	4. getting a dog (ironically a black dog)
1/5		I‚Äôve had a number of people ask recently how I‚Äôve been working through my depression. 		Each time I share they say I should write about it.		Here‚Äôs a quick list of things that have helped me:		Note: I'm not a doctor, this is just my experience. I hope sharing this encourages

@RaviKapoor I've used Twitter's actual interface more the last few years but I still can't get used to this change even after a week or two of using it cc. @TwitterSupport
is anyone else frustrated by the 'New Twitter' design on the desktop? 		I find the 'Tweet' button in an unintuitive spot being above' where you enter the text.		To me being below makes more sense as that is where your eyes are. https://t.co/WTf6ocQUTu
@HiOlena appreciate you sharing your thoughts on the topic!
@chellemcquaid @NickCraig1 Interesting episode - I particularly enjoyed where Nick talked about having purpose as like having a kid. 		Great analogy. Going to share this into a group I run. Thanks for doing the interview.

@jesslaw I'm biased - I live in Melbourne. 		Cairns is one of our favorite destinations though - depending on the time of year (avoid rainy season). Can be humid too.		Melbourne can be dreary in our winter though.
@jesslaw Depends what you like doing:		Cairns - more tropical, good for great barrier reef	Whitsundays - never been but friends sail there	Melbourne - city known for it's food, art, culture - some day trip available to see coast, wildlife, wineries etc

@mike_allton @JoSaundersAU @HeatherSmithAU @Yvonne_Adele @eernoult @AgoraPulse this would be good.
@JoSaundersAU @eernoult not sure if we met last year.
@augieray great insights - I agree both are important.
@ashhmarketing yep - I think a good mix of both to be used in different situations is important.
@matiasbaldanza agreed!
@polishepolyglot good points.
@djpappas yes! So true.
@Donners66 Yeah - my gut feeling was to go for the up and coming team... and yellow works for me.
@eernoult can't wait to see where you take it. I'm finding it's particularly helped my ability to track and interact with those who comment. With large accounts it's so hard to be able to make sure you see all comments and respond well.
@TheresaWagar nice!

Blogging is often a collaborative effort. And not just in terms of creating the content. Here's how Jacob West and some of his friends got the "Live Life Liberated" blog up and running by working together. https://t.co/rjMfhxgdkM
If everyone waited until they became an expert on a topic before blogging about it, there wouldn't be anywhere near as many blogs around. And readers probably wouldn't learn anywhere near as much about those topics. Here's why. https://t.co/I6kXxG3OG1 https://t.co/4HtoM9OqOq
Do you want to start a blog but don't think you have the time or the skills to create and run it yourself? Why not ask your friends if they'd be willing to help? That's what Jacob West did for the "Live Life Liberated" blog. Here's how it all happened. https://t.co/rjMfhxgdkM

"Your competition isn't other people. Your competition is:		üëâ your  procrastination	üëâ your ego	üëâ the  unhealthy food you're consuming	üëâ the  knowledge you neglect	üëâ the negative behavior you're nurturing 	üëâ your lack of creativity. 		Compete against that."		@JOURNALISTAJAD
@whatjanesays Love it.
A short story from our 10 year old. https://t.co/1d3VO6KiFS
Courage is always preceded by fear. 		If you feel fear today you also have the opportunity to experience courage.		PS: courage rarely feels euphoric, more often than not it is accompanied by doubt, timidity and wobbly knees #WobblyCourage.

@ronaldnzimora no it replaces it - the UltraStudio was increasingly not picking up my camera at all. In the early days it would pick it up 50% of the time but today it wouldn't see it at all.
FYI - I got a CamLink (USB dongle) and it worked without a problem straight out of the box.
@PixemWebDesign @Blackmagic_News @OBSProject it's the box that sits between camera and software that wasn't working. Just picked up a CamLink and it worked without a hitch.
@PeopleTalkDaily @DannyAndCleo @CEOHaize camera has hdmi signal coming out

@doyouevenblog Thanks for sharing that. Glad the article resonated.
Also... 		The world needs more kindness. 		We never know what is happening privately for those we encounter. 		Some are not ready to share their struggle but battle in silence. 		As a result approaching others with grace and compassion is the best starting place.
@TraciLGarceau My pleasure
Many battle with their mental health alone thinking they‚Äôre the only one in their network - not knowing that they are surrounded by others with similar struggles. 		We need to talk more about it.		I hope this prompts others to tell their story too.
This year I‚Äôve battled with depression. 		As I‚Äôve slowly moved into a better place I‚Äôve started talking more about it. 		I was wary how people would react but most times I share my story I see a wave of people saying ‚Äòme too‚Äô or ‚Äòmy husband/wife/brother/daughter/etc too‚Äô. &gt;&gt;
@garyvee Looks fun.
‚ÄúHaving a superpower has nothing to do with the ability to fly or jump, or superhuman strength. 		The truest superpowers are the ones we all possess: willpower, integrity, and most importantly, courage.‚Äù		Jason Reynolds		Sadly not everyone uses their superpowers.

32 hours after leaving home I am looking forward to bed... although no tooth brush, pjs or anything to wear tomorrow. Fun times! Lucky I don‚Äôt have to get on stage tomorrow! :-)
Long day. 1st of 4 flights delayed so rerouted on a new route. Get to LAX. Bag not found for almost an hour which meant I had to sprint to make the next flight which sat on tarmac for ages. Get to Orlando at midnight &amp; they lost my bag again! Comedy of errors @Qantas @AmericanAir

@Qantas Sure. Sent them although the service desk was helpful.
@SterlingTravelr @jpcoombs @Uber @Qantas @AmericanAir First flight delayed to the point I would miss connecting flight to SF so now In Melbourne 6 hours before going anywhere and going through Brisbane. ‚ÄòFun times‚Äô :-) one less flight though as it‚Äôs BNE - LAX - Orlando from there.
@chrisbrogan just got the notification that I was in the less than 1%
@hawkbullhorn They moved me onto a Brisbane flight at 2pm. Hope they can sort you out too.

@Qantas I am on QF420 to Sydney with a connection to San Francisco and then Dallas and Orlando. Just been announce first flight is now delayed 90 minutes. Can‚Äôt see making the next flight. Any tips?
@Kate_Seear Yeah, I think they have season 3 emerging as we speak.
@Kate_Seear Yep.
@Kate_Seear Again I went with amazing... need a thesaurus.
@Kate_Seear Yep. I can think of some words too. Been listening to a podcast about Lewinski/Clinton and is amazing how the religious right reacted in that situation as compared to recent times.

@SterlingTravelr @Uber @Qantas @AmericanAir It was strange but when I booked ages ago Qantas only had less direct routes available. Later I checked and there were direct options but they wouldn‚Äôt let me change. Guess I will just have to see it as an opportunity for extra points.
@SterlingTravelr @Uber @Qantas @AmericanAir Way home is nicer. Orlando-SF-Mel.
And so the commute to Orlando for #fincon18 and #SuccessIncubator begins. 		1. @Uber to airport	2. @qantas Melbourne to Sydney	3. Sydney to San Francisco 	4. @AmericanAir SF to Dallas	5. Dallas to Orlando	6. Uber to Hotel		Surely there was a more direct route!

The dual SIM got my interest but at that price I think I can just pack an old 2nd phone when I travel ;-)
Had a look at the Apple iPhones keynote. At up to A$2,369.00 I think I'll wait another year... or two to upgrade. My frequency of purchasing Apple products has definitely slowed the last couple of years. The AU$ is probably not helping but they're getting so expensive.

What made you feel most alive as a 10 year old?
Perhaps some of them will be things that you can see you do today or perhaps there will be other sparks that you observe in your younger self that might give you hints about what you could try next. üëá
I‚Äôm amazed how many people I meet whose childhood interests, passions and obsessions shaped their future and thought it might make an interesting exercise to visit your childhood self to ponder what sparks you see there. üëá
Of course there were some things back in those early years that I enjoyed that I never pursued (I never played tennis at Wimbledon or won the Commodore 64 video game championship for example).üëá
Today I can see them as hints of what I‚Äôd end up doing as an entrepreneur, in the field of photography, being a content creator with a blog and podcast and regularly speaking. üëá
These four experiences were little first tastes of things that gave me energy - ‚Äòsparks‚Äô if you will. üëá
Another time I remember the first time I ever got on a stage in front of a group of people at a camp and had to share something - I loved it. üëá
A little while later I remember recording ‚Äòradio shows‚Äô on a tape cassette player (remember those?) and discovered that I enjoyed speaking. üëá
Around the same time I remember my father letting me start to use the family camera and I remember the rush of energy I felt in using it to document the world around me. üëá
When I was in primary school I started my first business (selling pictures of Brooke Shields from my mothers magazines to the boys in my class to put on their school books). üëá
One of the realisations I‚Äôve had in the past few years is that a lot of what I love to do today actually had its roots in my childhood. üëá
What made you feel most alive as a 10 year old? 		This is today‚Äôs reflection question I asked in our ‚Äòsparks challenge‚Äô that I am running. 		Read on for the rest of the prompt üëáüëáüëá
@millionsofmyles yeah - that'll be interesting to find out.

@PaulCunningham @GregBriggs Golden State play Boston in Boston on 26th Jan - side trip!
@GregBriggs @PaulCunningham Greg - surely it's your turn for a boys trip!? ;-)
@itsntconsult @Ticketmaster_AU nothing close for a group of 5 sadly
@PaulCunningham @GregBriggs I'd love to see Celtics play them! Then over to see Golden state...
@PaulCunningham @GregBriggs Let's do it - when do we go?
@Ticketmaster_AU Really disappointing - I'll be sure to let my kids know they missed out because of a missing 0
@itsntconsult @Ticketmaster_AU @VisaCheckout thanks - gave up - good seats are gone. Not paying $700 to sit in the rafters ;-)
@braydizz @ASternWarning @VisaCheckout Yep - big stuff up.
@GregBriggs @Ticketmaster_AU @VisaCheckout agreed - i was only going to do it if we could get Level 1 tix or better. Am sure it'll be on the box.
@braydizz @ASternWarning @VisaCheckout Thanks. Sadly to get decent tickets I would now need to split my family up or sit in row v of level 3. Hope it‚Äôs on TV.
@BasketballAus @jimbob_canale @Ticketmaster_AU @VisaCheckout Tried for almost an hour now and still no success. Went from having floor seats to being offered level 3 row V. Giving up now. This has been a big fail.

@FalconSays @Ticketmaster_AU @VisaCheckout Indeed - went from having floor seats to being offered Level 3 in row V!
@tminear @AleksDevic @Ticketmaster_AU Same - now they're offering me Level 3!
@EtihadStadiumAU @usabasketball Seeing a handful of people saying they got tickets but after half an hour of trying to use the checkout I'm giving up
@jadehaz @Ticketmaster_AU @Visa @VisaCheckout hopefully it's on TV
@jadehaz @Ticketmaster_AU @Visa @VisaCheckout no - I'm giving up after half an hour of trying.
Epic fail @Ticketmaster_AU and @VisaCheckout. After half an hour of trying to buy these tickets I give up. Kids will be devistated but I can spend the $700 on spoiling them some other way. https://t.co/0qTzNbX8Sm

This prompt is part of my 30 day SPARKS Challenge mentioned in this article 		https://t.co/m3XJPhHovq
What problems have you been noticing lately?		Get in the habit of doing this exercise and you never know what might result.
You don‚Äôt need to find the solution to the problems straight away - but sometimes just noting them helps you keep on the lookout for answers.
EXERCISE: So take a moment today to notice some problems. 		You might come up with two lists:		‚ùå problems that you have (or have had in the past) 	‚ùåproblems that you see others having around you
Noticing a problem of those around you (or one YOU face) puts you in a position to start searching for or creating a solution.
Almost every good idea that I‚Äôve had over the years in my business has emerged from noticing a problem of one kind or another.
What Problems do you observe?		This thread could help you turn them into your next big thing....

@theverbsblog agreed!
@FOXTEL_Help @l3oaussie we are having the same issue on 504 - did you get any resolution?
@FOXTEL_Help we are having lots of glitches on 504 at the moment - noticing others are having it too. We are on cable. No other channels are impacted. It was occasionally bad yesterday but today its unwatchable.
‚ÄúIf you feel stuck in your life, like it‚Äôs passing you by, 		like there‚Äôs something way better for you somewhere out there and you‚Äôre missing it, 		try this...		try throwing yourself into the small things and repeating to yourself: 		This is where I start.‚Äù 		‚Äï Rob Bell

@Ola_Olajide Thanks. Appreciate the share.
@gadgetsquirrel Thanks for sharing. Hope it helps someone.
It could just be that without the ‚Äòwrong turn‚Äô you took that you will never reach your ultimate destination.
üëâ what skills did you develop?	üëâ what knowledge did you gain?	üëâ what lessons did you learn?	üëâ what relationships were strengthened?	üëâ what passions and interests were stimulated?	üëâ how did your character mature?
So next time you feel like you are at a dead end or have made a false start ponder these questions.
I didn‚Äôt know it at the time but the accumulation of all those skills and strengths actually positioned me really well to end up doing what I do today.
‚úÖ I‚Äôd learned communication skills	‚úÖ I‚Äôd become a proficient photographer	‚úÖ I had sales experience	‚úÖ I‚Äôd studied some psychology	‚úÖ I‚Äôd travelled abroad to see development work and learnt about cross cultural communication	‚úÖ I had met mentors	‚úÖ I had grown in maturity
Years later I realised that over that decade while I‚Äôd never really developed a ‚Äòcareer‚Äô that I‚Äôd actually built quite a good skill set.
At the time I wondered if I had been wasting my time with so many false starts.
From the ages of 20-30 I had around 20 jobs (in addition to starting two degrees at university - only one of which I completed).
Do you ever feel like you have taken a path in life that has been a waste of time?

@JeffHarbert good advice - thanks.
@libsyn @Spotify Thanks - will do so.
@ImJenHanson great - already on the schedule!
@JeffHarbert aaah - that's disappointing. We just booked a ticket for a tour of Pearl Harbour which was supposed to include that - doh!
Advice needed - our family is off to Honolulu tomorrow - never been before. What do we need to do/see/experience while there?
@parkslifeblog @Deeksha_shr @bloglove2018 @thebloggersknot @BloggerLS @abranchofholly fantastic! Thanks for sharing what we're doing!
@Claire doh!
This time tomorrow will be in Uber to Airport - can't wait to get to Hawaii. @thesurfjack - here we come!

@michaelehenson @Spotify @libsyn yeah - that's what I tried. Mustn't have been approved
@rads I touch on it in this podcast - https://t.co/MZHBDpXjGL
@katairobi @Spotify @libsyn Yep - that's how I submitted it - looks like I wasn't approved.
@SpotifyCares I wish that was a bit clearer - I was told it took two weeks so guess I've not been approved. Strange that all my colleagues seem to have had no problems and mine is in every other directory :-(

@Gayle_Pescud @Coles I suspect the handful of people who wouldn't spend the 15c compared to the number of people not willing to spend their $100's a week will hopefully flip this decision. I for one went to @woolworths today with my Envirosacks in hand.
@GuestSnapApp @MomentsAU @Coles Wish our government would step up and do something like this cc @TurnbullMalcolm
@TheMissionHQ Appreciate the opportunity to publish this with you - had so many messages and emails as a result of it going up. Hope it's been worthwhile for you too.
@declan_wilson_ thanks for reading and sharing!
@MomentsAU @Coles Disappointing that @Coles caved on this one. Our environment will suffer because people can't get themselves organised to get a bag or two or fork out 15c when they forget? Took me two days and a few $s to get a couple of bags that I keep in my jackets. #Coles

"People rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing." - Dale Carnegie
I wrote it up many years ago in a series on ProBlogger - as it applies to bloggers at https://t.co/91hcDkSbM5.		Excuse the broken images - something in the archives broke - but you get the idea. 		Never considered applying it to networking - great episode.
@TheMissionHQ 		1. Rejection to Attention	2. Indifference to Interest	3. Skepticism to Conviction	4. Procrastination to Desire	5. Fear to Commitment		I still use it today in speaking, podcasts, sales copy etc
@TheMissionHQ loved your AIDA method episode. I was taught a similar method in public speaking way back in the early 90s. It had an extra step though and for each aim there was a challenge - or a 'state' that the other person was in.		It went like this  &gt;&gt;

@hardlynormal It's a constant balancing act.
Been thinking about Ambition:		üëâ Without it we don't really have progress.	üëâ But it also can become an obsession and can lead to comparisons and burn out.	üëâ It also tends to focus us on a destination/goal rather than the journey.		Joy is found on the journey.

@randfish aaah - makes sense. Would be a great addition - I value replies more than anything else.
@randfish Looks good - one question though. Why isn't the replies you get to a tweet a factor? Seems like this is increasingly a factor in SM algorithms.
Don't feel you're an expert on your topic?		Here's the types of content to create:		üëâ Personal stories	üëâ Case studies	üëâ Interviews	üëâ Guest content	üëâ News items	üëâ Curated content	üëâ Research results	üëâ Answers to discussion questions		https://t.co/FNJt8IMBxu

What can you DO today to bring about the CHANGE you want to see in the world?		Today I see lots of strong words (and retweets + likes) calling for change. 		But change is almost always a result of groups of people taking action together.
@PatFlynn Can't wait to see how it goes.
@outersanctum01 @CollingwoodFC good news - hope others follow.
@briansolis Todays social media response to what just happened gave me a glimmer of hope - but I hope all the talk, retweeting and liking drives people to action and change.
"Throughout history, it has been 		üëâ the inaction of those who could have acted; 	üëâ the indifference of those who should have known better; 	üëâ the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most; 		that has made it possible for evil to triumph."		Haile Selassie
@FootyClassified SOS did great.
@PatFlynn congrats mate - you'll put on something special no doubt!
@PRisUs excellent! We're connected!
@SoundingBoardEp @barrettdamian @craighutchy Looking forward to it.

@CareerPivot @MackCollier sounds familiar.		I've actually found a number of my mistakes turned out to be the start of new things! :-)
@CareerPivot @MackCollier One of my early podcasts was on 21 mistakes bloggers make - most of which I made too :-) #blogchat		https://t.co/DfFPz3Jjmu
@MackCollier If I share a mistake I always try to share something I would do differently or something I am doing to fix it. 		This gives others something constructive to do if they are in the same situation and shows you are not stagnant. 		#BlogChat
@savingjoyfully thanks for listening - I appreciate you letting me know it helps!
@manojpandey thanks
My blogs are largely about helping people to eliminate some kind of pain or to help them make some kind of gain.		To show readers I'm on the same journey (and have not 'arrived') I think helps motivate people.		 #blogchat
Having said that - I don't think you have to blog about everything. 		Bloggers have a right to privacy and it's good sense to have boundaries about what you will and won't blog about.		#blogchat
I know when I am most vulnerable with my readers they have responded positively every single time.		I know I'm anything but perfect and have a lot to learn in the fields I write (and as a human) about - I have no problem admitting that :-)		#BlogChat
üëâ Transparency in blogging is really about trust.	üëâ Sharing your mistakes makes you relatable.	üëâ Showing your imperfections shows you are human.	üëâ Being real makes you believable.		 #blogchat
A quote from Robert Frost I think is relevant to us as bloggers:		"No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader. No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader."		Be personal, passionate and engaging in your writing. 		#BlogChat
@GorgiCoghlan Saw this earlier - staggering.
Here's something I regularly say to friends (and myself):		You‚Äôre doing fine. 		While it seems everyone else is achieving, being productive + making dreams come true you‚Äôre only seeing a snapshot in time.		Trying is powerful.		Rest is powerful too.		You‚Äôre doing fine.

Follow on from last tweet - interested to know two things:		1. Name 1 thing you're passionate about?	2. What came before the passion? (or where did it emerge from?)
@JeffGoins Can't help myself.
Do what you're passionate about is the advice so often given.		I'd rather:		üëâ pay attention to what I'm curious about	üëâ gather information about it	üëâ learn skills needed to do it	üëâ practice it	üëâ work to master it		I find passion usually follows.
This makes me sad and angry.		https://t.co/35YTszNsmH		We can do better than this.

If you're looking to improve your photography check out these 'Action Cards' that we're promoting on @digitalps at the moment. 		https://t.co/fuzmXpFDao		This kind of 'card' is a great idea for a product too. I reckon many bloggers could adapt it to their niche.

@hughriminton @AngelaBishop @tendailyau @channeltennews Delete the 'probably' and 'in public' and it's approaching an apology.
@Woogsworld @stemplemanmp It's a hard one - evil needs to be stood up to - but standing up to it tends to give all the nutters something to rally around which sadly feeds and can make them stronger.
@Woogsworld @stemplemanmp Having said that - I think media/social media gives a disproportionate amount of air time to the bad ones so we don't hear about the good people. This week has been a good example of that - I fear that this whole thing is feeding a beast.
@Woogsworld @stemplemanmp Yep - I reckon it would attract a certain kind of person. I suspect the pressure/environment brings out the nutter in good people too.
@Woogsworld do you think it's a higher proportion of general public? Or do we just hear about the dodgy ones while the good peeps work quietly away?

üëÜüëÜüëÜ All of these things are what I like to call #WobblyCourage		I've had to show quite a bit of it in the past couple of weeks. It isn't easy but good things flow from it.
I think some of the most courageous things a person can do is to:		üòê  show that they are scared	üòê  to ask for help 	üòê  to admit they're not ok		If any of those things are true for you today - you're not alone. I for one stand with you.		Tell someone.

@publiclawjunkie Carlton. FootbLl is dead to me :-)
@publiclawjunkie Yep. Once it opened up its been good to watch.
@kenlee_au Maybe, although they will watch any NBA game that is on no matter the team :-)
@kenlee_au Yep. If/when it opens up its good, but just wish our game which can be so spectacular would start with a bang and not a fizzle. Worries me when my kids wander off a few minutes in.
@bartman6 @rohan_connolly Or they wear bibs with their position on it and have to say in their zone :-)
@bartman6 @rohan_connolly Yep. Mine don‚Äôt mind it live, although they are younger and find it a bit long/boring. Live experience could do better in comparison to what US sports do. Again, they are comparing to NBA.
@bartman6 @rohan_connolly A couple minutes into the game my sons asked when NBA starts again and volunteered to go to bed! Younger generation isn‚Äôt engaging and if we lose them in another 10 years supporter base will be lower.
@bartman6 @rohan_connolly There were 6 in the first 60 seconds! Not a great way to start a game. Something has to change.
@Lennytalk @japanesejohno 6 stoppages in the first 60 seconds. Spectacular... not.

@chiddickstree sounds like me - I find I often outline posts in the notebook which helps when I sit down to write a lot #BlogChat
@chiddickstree Another little technique I use is to write a post with a person in mind - almost like I'm emailing them. I wouldn't email someone without a benefit/purpose for them - I find it helps me keep it more value filled. #BlogChat
@seancarp @Kathrynclang it's on our site at https://t.co/psUyIxm9YV if you go look at the 'courses' tab - we should go live with it in the coming week
@chiddickstree I find doing this ahead of time means when I sit down to write I'm more able to get into the flow of actually writing. #BlogChat
@chiddickstree I find a lot of people get stuck on the 'ideas' part and get into trouble because they sit down to write but then need to come up with an idea on the spot. I put aside time each week just to brainstorm topics. #BlogChat
@chiddickstree I think for me working out what the block is is part of it. Are you blocked for 'ideas', for 'writing/creating' or for 'finishing'. Most bloggers seem to get stuck on one part. Then putting aside more time to focus on that bit can help. #BlogChat
@Kathrynclang @seancarp so glad to hear that - I'm amazed how many people have gone through it over the years! #BlogChat
