@KaylaNaab @crissymoss @TanteKee @TraceeEllisRoss @ACLU You cannot say there is a systemic problem with the full knowledge that WOMEN MAKE DIFFERENT LIFE CHOICES, accounting for the "pay gap."
@KaylaNaab @ceneblock @TanteKee @TraceeEllisRoss @ACLU You have to PROVE that there is a "systemic failure" based on racism and misogyny. Just because you WANT it to be true does not mean it IS.

@KaylaNaab @TanteKee @TraceeEllisRoss @ACLU You attempted to prove your fake narrative with a biased source based in England &amp; the link to the "research" was broken. You are a parrot.
@rileyliter @mommabfly @TraceeEllisRoss Were you there for negotiations? 		Are you saying that the producers of Blackish are RACIST MISOGYNISTS? 		ARE YOU REALLY MAKING THAT CLAIM?
@dechaannelle @mommabfly @TraceeEllisRoss Why is it that you think u can get away with lying? It just makes you seem uneducated &amp; silly. Name-calling does not help your credibility.
@dechaannelle @mommabfly @TraceeEllisRoss Women DO make less than men because they make different life choices, not because men hate women. You are NOT A VICTIM.
@KaylaNaab @TanteKee @TraceeEllisRoss @ACLU Oh wow compelling evidence you have there. Baseless claims hold no credibility no matter how many hashtags you have that say otherwise.
@KaylaNaab @TanteKee @TraceeEllisRoss @ACLU @GOP I could not agree more. That is why non-biased facts based on non-cherry-picked data MATTERS.
@mommabfly @TraceeEllisRoss LOL Who makes more? Specifically? You people make stuff up as you go, you are so DESPERATE to be victims. How boring. THIS IS WHY TRUMP WON.
