Lower census results for cities can keep federal funding for (for example) infrastructure, emergency preparedness and response, rural development out of state and local hands FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. Thus, we see non-partisan state &amp; local leaders filing suit against the rule.

But WILL they? A lot depends on the midterms, and how the party leaders react. House GOP leaders have already vowed a fight over the border wall, but the Senate GOP isn't so hot on that idea. And, never underestimate Congress' desire to just Be Done Already.
There's plenty of bipartisan priorities Congress COULD address before year end: criminal justice reform, driverless cars, 5G cell service, Jobs Act 3.0, corrections to last year's tax law, budget/approps reform, and updating the Hill's harassment policies.
Keep in mind: Congress has ALREADY funded about 75% of the government, including defense, veterans affairs, health and human services. Further, the Department of Homeland Security at the center of the border fight is largely exempt from the effects of a shutdown. So...
Then there's what parties WANT to do: House Republicans and the White House want a confrontation over President Trump's border wall and immigration priorities that could trigger a partial federal shutdown, just in time for the holidays.
The Senate is clearing out for elections, and the House is already gone. When they return on 11/13, they'll have a long must-do list: Farm Bill, tax extenders, Violence Against Women Act, wrapping up year-end funding.

Thank you @WeAreUnidosUS and @HartSurveys for this illuminating poll!
Survey takers overwhelmingly oppose funding cuts for #snap and school lunch nutrition assistance programs for low-income families @WeAreUnidosUS
Survey takers strongly oppose allowing insurers to refuse coverage based on pre-existing conditions, barring states from expanding Medicaid, shifting costs onto older Americans
Strong support among @WeAreUnidosUS survey takers for expanding Medicare to offer affordable coverage for more Americans, though GOP and independent voters not as strongly
Most surveyed by @WeAreUnidosUS have favorable views of CHIP, Medicaid, Obamacare. Only 16% believe #Obamacare has failed, the rest approve or think it can be improved.
.@WeAreUnidosUS surveyed 1,600 Latino voters. Healthcare, immigration top 2 by far.

To be clear, the majority has some limits on what they can do in reconciliation. But, the possibilities are broad enough that Democrats should be ready for the GOP majority to pull this resolution out of the back pockets at any time.
Reconciliation is filibuster-proof, so the minority (Democrats) in the Senate would not be able to block it as they can with other bills. GOP has already used reconciliation to pass last year's tax cuts, almost pulled off ACA repeal until a few GOP Senators broke with the party.
Reconciliation can order cuts to "mandatory" spending usually out of the reach of appropriators. Examples: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance, student loan subsidies, veterans programs. This draft pitches $5.4 TRILLION mandatory cuts.
The typical function of a budget resolution is to set spending limits for appropriators, like households sit and write out their budget before spending the money later. HOWEVER, a tactic called "reconciliation" allows budget writers to make big changes to federal spending.
DON'T SLEEP ON THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION. It's a filibuster-proof vehicle for the GOP majority to attempt partisan priorities like ACA repeal, cuts to social safety net, more tax cuts. They could act on it at any time through end of year. https://t.co/nMo5NnjPDp
Tday we glimpsed a Homeland Security funding bill amid new controversy over the Trump Administration's border and immigration policy. What does the new bill tell us about prospects for policy changes, a federal shutdown, and the midterm elections?  #hustle	https://t.co/jZkGN2jlVS
The Subcmte didn't add more border wall funding as White House wants: $1.6 billion for border security, similar to last year's levels. That's another gamble: POTUS has threatened several times to veto a DHS funding bill that doesn't fund his promised border wall.
Subcommittee advances the bill on a voice vote. Next step is full Senate Approps Committee markup on Thursday morning, expect more debates as more Senators get a look at the bill.
Sen. Capito refers to traditional divide between appropriators (funders) and authorizers (setting policy). While this is tradition, appropriators frequently include "policy riders" into their bills to change agency policy. Capito says instead full Congress needs to act.
Chair Sen. Shelley Moore Capito: #FamilySeparation needs to change, but this bill funding DHS activity doesn't address it. This could cause problems for this bill in the Senate: Democrats and growing # of Republicans demand separations end.
Today the Senate Appropriations DHS Subcommittee is introducing their draft FY 2019 Homeland Security funding bill. This bill contains annual funding for DHS including Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Coast Guard, other agencies.
Another pntl victim of a trade war: agricultural states exporting soybeans, grain, rice, fruit abroad. These are strong red states, but will that support hold through the midterms if we enter a trade war? https://t.co/wXgv4DMhLF
We're on the brink of a trade war with China (starting July 6) and many U.S. allies. If it happens, voters may be hit with price increases on normal goods. Higher prices ➡️more consumer debt ➡️ economic slowdown, just in time for the midterms. https://t.co/CqPbnQyNvx

Stan Korosec of Detroit Intl Bridge Co gives northern border update: Canada's about to legalize recreational marijuana, would could increase smuggling drug smuggling concerns at northern ports 🍁
Al of @CT_Strategies 2 priorities in deploying new technology: "Screen at speed," and "run the operation live." Move port inspection around people/goods, don't make the goods/people come to clogged ports. Mentions @PercepticsLPR, who set up such a system at US-Canada Peace Bridge
Our friend Allen Gina of @CT_Strategies is onstage at @MexicoInstitute #UsMxBorder to talk port design and management. https://t.co/PN3fgkEm4k
McAleenan talk about CBP efforts to scan 100% of cargo coming onto US for contraband (currently scanning WAY below that). Understaffing at CBP big obstacle. #UsMxBorder
CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan talks future of cooperation with Mexico: trusted trade program, anti-opioid effort. Says current US asylum law forces family separation policy: "A better system will allow us to keep families together." @MexicoInstitute #UsMxBorder https://t.co/d9Tu9V6kqL
Jose Martin Garcia of Mexico's Finance Ministry talks Mexico's vision for cargo processing at the border: in #NAFTA: rather than sending trucks through border agency, local govs, environmental/ag inspections, do the #wholeenchilada in one place. @MexicoInstitute #UsMxBorder
#NAFTA isn't perfect. How to improve? @MariaLBoyce of @UPS: modernize and secure supply chain. Antonio Vidales of @Grupo365: Each gov has trusted shipper program, but govs should recognize neighbors' programs.  @MexicoInstitute #UsMxBorder
RT @MexicoInstitute: "I don't know a single economist that says trade deficits are bad." Jose Martin Garcia @SATMX #UsMxBorder
From the private sector #NAFTA panel at #UsMxBorder @MexicoInstitute: Trade deficits are NOT the way to measure who's winning or losing in trade. Doesn't tell whole story about positive economic benefits of international trade, economic growth over time.
Reps from @UnionPacific, @UPS, CAAAREM make the $ case for three-nation #NAFTA. Trade between US-Mexico alone has grown 7x since 1994. #UsMxBorder @MexicoInstitute https://t.co/TlkLmYwlx8
Can California, Texas, other border states make free trade agreements with Mexico? @JA_Zabalgoitia says best deal is renegotiated #NAFTA: North America as a region must come together to compete with Europe, Asia #UsMxBorder @MexicoInstitute
Next: @JA_Zabalgoitia says US-Mexico region, if combined, makes the world's 4th largest economy. Border management is not just immigration control, blows to Mexico= hits to US economy. @MexicoInstitute #UsMxBorder https://t.co/j5TS6eJzzh
