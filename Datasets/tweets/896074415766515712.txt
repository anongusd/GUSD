@I_Bresnick @CoastalElite28 According to Dave Min I've been connected at any point in time to his rivals' campaigns, Mimi Walters, and the Russians.		In truth I'm just a concerned citizen who thinks Dave is too sleazy for office, and who also has more liberal taste.

It's highly entertaining to see the Min campaign roll out a few dozen Twitter bots. All created in the last few days. No profiles. No followers. But  you better believe they all have on thing in common:		All they tweet about is how great Dave is.		#DesperateDave strikes again.
@I_Bresnick @CoastalElite28 She's probably more nervous at the idea of facing off against Porter.

Dave Min is throwing everything at the wall to see if something will stick because he‚Äôs desperate. But his desperation proves his dishonesty. 		Mimi, Kia, Brian, and Katie can‚Äôt all be to blame. But Dave has blamed each one in turn.		Thou doth protest too much, Dave. #DropOutDave
4. It was actually Katie who invented the rumors about her rumors. She spilled the beans to the HuffPost to get a hit piece out on Dave and self-victimize herself. (This comes from Dave‚Äôs supporters, and is mentioned nearly anytime anyone brings up Dave‚Äôs attack ads.) #CA45
2. It was actually @KiaForCongress that started the whispers. (This comes from Dave himself.) 		3. It was actually @BrianForde who started the whispers. (This comes from Dave‚Äôs supporters and is listed on his campaign website as ‚Äúeyewitness testimony.‚Äù)
Dave Min‚Äôs and his surrogates‚Äô attempts to deflect the whisper campaign show how untrustworthy he is:		1. Dave was mentioning that Mimi had disqualifying information about Porter. It was out of concern that he was mentioning it to delegates. (This comes from Dave‚Äôs supporters.)
Everyone: "Dave Min doesn't support a single-payer healthcare system."		Dave Min: "HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT!!! ... I just don't want my donors to have to pay for it."
@gaytakibitch Yikes. You voted for Min?
Dave Min's #DadAgenda involves denying coverage to the most vulnerable members of society: the poor, the young, and the elderly.		Let's hope he at least provides his own children with a nice healthcare plan, even if he doesn't want to support everyone else having one. https://t.co/K1Ra6343EZ
Dave says he appeals to moderates because he is a "pro-growth" Democrat (the implication being that most Democrats are anti-growth?).

This seems cut and dry to me, no matter how they spin it. https://t.co/rNmqFrjL27
3. Are we to actually believe that these whispers are different than the whisper campaign mentioned in the HuffPost article?		It seems that we now have proof of multiple Minions openly admitting they heard whispers from Dave. #DadAgenda #CA45
So basically, Dave heard negative rumors from Mimi‚Äôs camp, and then told people about them. This is weird.		1. Why would Mimi be building oppo against Katie so early (before the convention)?		2. Why didn‚Äôt Min warn Katie? Why did he only whisper it to his delegates and friends?
The latest attempt to defend Dave Min is a true feat of mental gymnastics. Diehard Minions like @TimBurns88 are now admitting that they heard whispers about Katie, but that they were about Mimi having information that would sink Porter in the general. https://t.co/XvnBz1HtEL

2. They know they can't rely on strong polling numbers, because they spent $30k on a poll and never released it.		3. They know they don't have enough grassroots support, so they're dumping cash into negative TV and mail.
Let's be clear: @DaveMinCA and his Nebraskan import @PaigeHutchinson went negative out of fear.		1. They know they aren't the strongest candidate, so they resort to weakening his opponents.

Katie isn't a lawyer = Min doesn't have an active bar license (Katie does)		Forde is a Republican = Min acts like a Republican (while Brian opts to behave like a decent human being)		Kia started the whisper campaign = Min got caught whispering and needed someone else to blame
BREAKING: Min doesn't hold an active law license in Washington, DC where he would have done extensive work on deregulating Wall Street.		This should surprise no one, because if you want to know what Min is: look at how he attacks others.
Dave Min‚Äôs hypocrisy knows no bounds! ‚ÄúThe world can be better if we could only learn to love each other,‚Äù he said glibly while depositing another $15,000 into his attack ad fund.

To be clear: I am not saying Dave Min dislikes #LGBTQ people or is bad for the LGBT community.		What I AM saying: @EQCA's endorsement is a sham. And their public justification for the endorsement rings false. You can't endorse someone for their track record when no record exists.
Dave Min has NOT worked on policies that specifically address the LGBT community.		He has NOT worked in a space where LGBTQ issues were tangentially discussed. I can't imagine #LGBTQ issues were at the forefront of discussions on banking regulations and Wall Street deregulation.
Dave Min has described himself in many ways to many people. To some, he's a father. To others, a [assistant] law professor. To others, "someone who studies money." (I'm not making this up.)		What Min is NOT, is an experienced or practiced defender of #LGBTQ rights.
.@EQCA's endorsement of Dave Min is one of the more confusing to have occurred this cycle. Sure, we know that it only happened because @RepMarkTakano forced it through.		But they CLAIM they endorsed based on Min's "track record" of standing up for #LGBTQ issues. Say what now? https://t.co/gCECKKqxQt
@TimBurns88 @bayofarizona @eqca @DaveMinCA It was written by an award-winning journalist and Pulitzer grantee and was only discredited if you believe Min‚Äôs weak attempt to pass blame while totally ignoring the question about his donor‚Äôs remarks.
@eqca @PaigeHutchinson @DaveMinCA The future is fearless, but Dave Min isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs terrified of losing, which is why he decided to spend $15,000 tearing down LGBT allies and Democrats instead of running on the issues.		P.s. Min has never worked in or for the LGBT community; he has no ‚Äútrack record‚Äù to endorse.
Dave Min's ignorance of scholarly literature explains why he's running for office. Academia requires a lot of reading, and he just isn't cut out for the job.		Dave would make a great politician (if not a good public servant): he lies, goes negative, and is desperate to please.
3. "All told, the research literature does not bear out the idea that negative campaigning is an effective means of winning votes."		Dave Min doesn't care, though, because he's so hungry for power he thinks his only path toward victory is destroying his Democratic opponents.
2. ‚ÄúPrior work finds that voters punish candidates for sponsoring attack ads."		I don't think the attack ads alone will explain Dave Min's impending loss, but they have certainly contributed to some voters abandoning Min's increasingly desperate ship.

@TimBurns88 @DaveMinCA Now that Dave Min has gone negative loudly and proudly, you still think he's the best candidate?		Surely a candidate strong enough to beat Mimi wouldn't need to go negative against fellow Democrats.

That would clear things up very quickly. (Newsflash: he won't denounce it, because he paid for it and approved it.)
@district_45 We can agree that Katie is 10x better than Mimi.		Dave is an empty suit, with no ideas of his own, willing to say whatever the people in the room want to hear.		He's couldn't get tenure as a professor and sees Congress as his only option to make something of himself. Sad.
.@ContraryMeri there is no "disinformation chaos agency" targeting Dave. Dave released an attack ad. Period.		It is truly mind-blowing how you people refuse to believe anything negative Dave has done; it couldn't possible be true. It's always some evil plot by Russians, Mimi, etc
@district_45 You're going to vote for Dave despite everything he's done and justify it as "Well, I'll still vote for Katie even if Dave loses."		If you cared about beating Mimi, you wouldn't vote for the candidate who consistently takes the low road and talks out of both sides of his mouth.

3. They, quite astutely, reguritate the old word of caution, "Follow the money." ... But it was already established in #1 that the money leads to... @DaveMinCA. Who they are trying to defend.		Don't try to compete in the mental gymnastics with Min's crowd. They'll run you ragged.
2. They insinuate @LEBasset wrote this story "for the clicks," as if anyone outside of OC is really going to pay much attention to this story. (This is yet more evidence of the average Minion's sense of self-importance.)
The comments below are a wonderful example of Minions being delusional.		1. They insinuate @RepMimiWalters had a man in Denver donate $2,000 to @DaveMinCA's campaign, then spread rumors before the convention, then Tweet something nasty about @KatiePorter months later. https://t.co/lW4iaKFNbz

.@PaigeHutchinson: your boss is a garbage person. Careful hanging out around him too long -- the smell isn't going to immediately wash off. It'll cling to you.
Prediction: @DaveMinCA will wrap @Jane_Stoever around himself like a precious invisibility cloak and suggest that because his wife does work with domestic violence victims it is therefore impossible for Min to be an asshole.		The conclusion does not follow from the premise.
In effect, Dave Min is going to be that guy who says vaguely racist things and then when called out on it says, "Hey, I'm not racist. I have a black friend."		Dave may not commit domestic abuse himself, but he's not above using it as a cudgel against his opponents.
This man has given $2,000 to @DaveMinCA's campaign. He probably saw values in Min that reflected his own. https://t.co/SF3z4cLzNN
"Kevin Matthews in Denver has donated $2,000 to the campaign of Dave Min, Porter‚Äôs leading primary opponent. He is also friends with Min‚Äôs wife on Facebook."		Can't wait to see how @PaigeHutchinson and the Minions try to spin this one. #CA45
.@DaveMinCA has no shame. https://t.co/DLAEvnY5FG
#ItStillAmazesMe that Minions still rabidly support @DaveMinCA. They consider mentioning anyone but Min a personal attack.		He's established a cult of personality not unlike @realDonaldTrump amongst his followers: largely ignorant and fiercely loyal.
.@DaveMinCA, for all his talk about having "personally met 10,000 voters", is apparently pleading with @DCCC for field assistance.		Poor little guy isn't knocking on enough doors, and @PaigeHutchinson made the rookie mistake of sending out mail and getting on TV way too early.
"Eat your vegetables or @DaveMinCA will be your Congressman when you grow up."  #FunnyThingsMomsSay
.@PaigeHutchinson, your boss should rethink his "dark money" messaging. https://t.co/IoG9UqmXCF
@kath_krueger Dead.
Once again, @DaveMinCA lobs bombs at @EMILYsList, referring to their efforts to elect women to Congress (how DARE they!) as some nefarious plot by a #DarkMoney super PAC.		Newsflash: Your male privilege is showing. Women are just as entitled to serve in elected office as you are. https://t.co/yK4j8xxo8V
@emilyslist What do you have to say about men like @DaveMinCA who are trying to spin Emily's List endorsees as candidates that rely on "dark money super Pacs" and "outside influences" to win races?		We in #CA45 stand with you, but some like Dave are trying to tear you down.
POLL: Is @DaveMinCA...		Like: ... so out of touch with the average voter he genuinely believes someone making $120,000+ a year is a member of the #WorkingClass.		Retweet: ... doing what he does best and pandering to the wealthy donors in the room. https://t.co/rChCus6xM2
I'll leave this right here... A month ago when I said this would happen I was called a liar. @CA_Dem's and @DaveMinCA's insecurities are showing.		If they were confident he was the "best candidate" they wouldn't use technicalities and dirty tricks to undermine other Democrats. https://t.co/XG8QXPLbPK
But wait, there‚Äôs more! @Deborah080 isn‚Äôt content to simply punish people who refuse to #BendTheKnee. She‚Äôs also tacitly admitting that @DaveMinCA is in fact waging a whisper campaign to smear @KatiePorterOC.		Her ‚Äúwink wink nudge nudge‚Äù is indicative of Min‚Äôs underhandedness. https://t.co/XLXuCE5bKM
Remember when I said Fran Sdao was threatening to change the bylaws in order to punish delegates who didn‚Äôt line up behind Min?		The response was that I was a liar, and I was even accused of being anti-feminist (??).		Here‚Äôs Fran‚Äôs regional director, in her own words. #CA45 https://t.co/bqIzjC5RXl

@MSignorile @SXMProgress You should do an episode on @DaveMinCA's dirty tactics in #CA45. It's a mind warp.
The future is bright. No more @BlueDogPAC Democrats hindering progress. The #youthvote won't stand for it, and that gives me hope. https://t.co/6CF0qKYLG8
@TheAlanvargas Why don't you support @DaveMinCA for Congress?
#ProTip: try to be a little better today than you were yesterday. Change is hard, but you're a #dad and are probably familiar with the concept of "baby steps."		Maybe try to limit your lies to 10 a day for now (or at least like, fewer than 5 per email), and work your way to 0.
CONCLUSION: You are intentionally misleading people. I think you're dumb, but I don't think you're dumb enough to not know you're being dishonest, @DaveMinCA. #CA45 #BlueWave
THIRD SENTENCE: "Major super PACs announced that they're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dark money to try and stop us."		5. You're trying REALLY hard to paint @EmilysList, a group that works to elect pro-choice female Democrats, as a political boogeyman in this race.
4. The exact wording of the article was: "Min could develop into a strong opponent if he makes it past the primary." Again, that is a far cry from concluding you're the only chance of beating Mimi.		You're just flat-out lying to your email list. :( #DadAgenda #CA45
SECOND SENTENCE: "@CookPolitical came to the conclusion that our campaign is the ONLY one that can beat @RepMimiWalters this fall."		3. Not true. The question of "which UC-Irvine law professor she'll face" is raised. They didn't conclude you were the only viable candidate.
2. @CookPolitical is highly regarded, as you say. Which is why it's strange that you're trying to spin @Redistrict's brief synopsis of 7 Houses races was some highly anticipated deep-dive into our district.
FIRST SENTENCE: "@CookPolitical just released its LONG AWAITED analysis of our race here in #CA45."		1. It wasn't a "long awaited analysis." It was an article on competitive House races in California that included "updates" on a few races.
&lt;THREAD&gt; Today on "@DaveMinCA: Bald-faced Lies and Stretched Truths" we'll be examining his recent email touting @CookPolitical. It's sure to be a doozy, so buckle up!		PARENTAL ADVISORY: Exposing children to Dave Min may lead to increased instances of fibbing and obfuscation. https://t.co/tZwGaKpUrw
@troysride @TheButterfas @DaveMinCA @RepMimiWalters Everyone is agreement that Mimi must go! Woohoo!		@DaveMinCA represents a clear and present danger to Democrats winning back the house and stopping Trump. He will not beat Mimi.

@mykstern  https://t.co/2fpb6GPtf0
@melindahill I don't get it.
Dave wants it both ways. He's a compulsive liar who says whatever the people in the room at the moment want to hear, hoping he won't be held accountable for his inability to take a stand on an issue.		Single payer is just today's example. This is Dave. This is who he is. #CA45
5. Remember when @DaveMinCA tried to downplay his opposition to #singlepayer because he wants "universal coverage" (??), and called single payer a "fringe policy," and then said people were lying about his opposition to single payer?
4. Remember when @DaveMinCA and @PaigeHutchinson said they opposed #singlepayer because it would be too much of a burden on OC taxpayers?		... but then also said it was unfair to describe him as opposing it?
3. Remember when @DaveMinCA is in the minority of healthcare providers, Californian voters, and voters nationally in his opposition to #singlepayer?		He isn't standing up against "The Democrats when they're wrong." He's standing against everyday people.
2. Remember when @DaveMinCA is a "nationally-renown economic expert" and yet he refuses to accept the fact that a single-payer system would save the majority of Americans money?
1. Remember when @DaveMinCA RAISED HIS HAND when the host of the @NextGenAmerica #YouthVote forum asked who supports: "a single-payer option".		Skip to 19:10 here to see with your own eyes: https://t.co/HSZ2DP5zJs
"I'm proud to be the only Democrat who won't blankly endorse @BernieSanders' #singlepayer healthcare plan. I'll stand up against @TheDemocrats when I think they're wrong." ‚Äì Dave Min at #FCLA Forum		There's a lot to unpack here. https://t.co/UX3rpoVRBJ
Weird how #DadAgenda Dave implies his Democratic opponents haven‚Äôt worked with Democrats (which is absolutely absurd)...		... yet Dave wasn‚Äôt endorsed by his Democratic boss, @ChuckSchumer. I haven‚Äôt even heard a peep of support for Dave from his old Democratic colleagues. ü§î https://t.co/ARuRjb0TN9
Furthermore, it appears Min is having to take out a loan or give himself a personal loan in order to afford his deluge of mail, lawn signs, and TV ads.		Remember: about $100,000 of his "cash on hand" is reserved for the general election. Which he'll be broke by. #CA45
The newest word on @DaveMinCA's cashflow isn't good.		His unethical snatching of @AhnforCA34's donor list caused the money in LA to dry up pretty quickly. He's being rebuffed by OC donors for being arrogant and entitled. He's had to fly to #NYC to raise money as a last resort.
It's really difficult for @DaveMinCA supporters to wrap their minds around the fact that I simply think Min would be a terrible representative. He's sycophantic, insecure, and desperate to be liked. He tries to please anyone because he has no principles of his own. #DadAgenda
Another example of @DaveMinCA's trickle down Mintality: his little #Minions only agree with women who claim they were harassed if it was someone else doing the harassing.		They willfully turn a blind eye to Min's shameful behavior, but call on others to resign. #CA45 #DadAgenda https://t.co/mKP2fSdwWX
... speaking of #superficial: "Lawn signs are only 98.3 percent useless." https://t.co/5hxFDQSxzy Why is a man with so little money to spend wasting it on yard signs? @PaigeHutchinson, any ideas? Does he just need his ego stroked? Likes seeing his name real big? https://t.co/jLySnVPrg2
It was clear @DaveMinCA had a problem with women when he accused @BrianForde‚Äôs wife of ‚Äúdisgusting behavior‚Äù for... its not entirely clear why. 		None of the things he has done or said is justifiable. He‚Äôs a bully, and his support of women is superficial at best.
It is clear that @DaveMinCA still has a problem with women when he attempts to discredit the efforts of a PAC whose sole purpose is to expand representation and equality by electing more women to office. #CA45 #SheShouldRun
It was clear that @DaveMinCA had a problem with women when he remained silent after @RepCardenas, whose #endorsement he gladly accepted, was credibly accused of sexually assaulting a 16 year old girl. #MeToo
It was clear that @DaveMinCA had a problem with women when he harassed a dozen of them at the @CA_Dem #Convention2018, telling his staff to follow them, speak over them, and physically block their movements.
The actual quote in @CookPolitical is that @DaveMinCA ‚Äúcould develop into a strong opponent.‚Äù		Could = not guaranteed  	Develop = isn‚Äôt currently		Give him a Minch and he‚Äôll take a mile.		P.s. Interesting how he‚Äôs referring to @EmilysList as some nefarious super PAC. #CA45 https://t.co/6Aue4hAGbf
Ever the bandwagoner, never a leader, @DaveMinCA will wait a respectable number of hours to make sure he‚Äôs in the majority before making a peep about his maligned endorser. 		Grow a spine, Dave. You‚Äôre running on the #DadAgenda. Be someone your kids can be proud of. https://t.co/mQmXJE3Nlh
It‚Äôll be easy to delete tweets and press releases touting @RepCardenas‚Äô endorsement, but difficult to scrub it off all the glossy mail that‚Äôs already been printed.		#MeToo Min isn‚Äôt just a catchy phrase describing his behavior at the convention ‚Äî it also describes his friends. https://t.co/ny7If9N4rD
#ThrowbackThursday to that one time @DaveMinCA accepted an endorsement  from an icky individual and the PAC money that came along with it. https://t.co/shXWUH5Hze
@FrshSqueezedOC @DaveMinCA @michelleisawolf Yes. She's a comedian. That's literally her job description.
@FrshSqueezedOC Taking liars to task is serious. I'm sorry you don't feel that way.
@julianrouth This is amazing. Good on them.
#OpenCall to all @DaveMinCA voters: go through my tweets and find one to refute. Comment providing contradicting evidence or a substantive counter argument and we'll discuss.		Leave your complaints about negativity, party unity, or anonymity at the door. #CA45 #DadAgenda #Minions
Notice how Minions never actually criticize the substance of what I tweet? Only the way in which I tweet or the tone of the tweets?		It's strange. Almost as if, deep down inside, they know they're wrong in their support of a compulsive liar and bully. #WednesdayWisdom https://t.co/gqtDArvRXe
@FrshSqueezedOC @DaveMinCA You're the type of person who'd complain about @MichelleIsAWolf's humor at #WHCD. "She's so mean and snarky!" Sometimes a spade needs to be called a spade, and it doesn't require purple prose or "elevated speech" to call Dave what he is.
@FrshSqueezedOC @DaveMinCA There's no conversation to elevate, friend. If you cared about anything but Dave Min's feelings you wouldn't be upset about "snark" and "antagonism."
Jesus, Dave. It‚Äôs printed on literally everything you own: you‚Äôre the most proud of @CA_Dem endorsement. This was a softball and you still managed to bungle it while sounding disingenuous. 		"Young people are the future." Wow. How long did it take for you to cook that one up?
‚ÄúDave, what‚Äôs the endorsement that you‚Äôre most proud of?‚Äù		Dave: ‚ÄúUh, young people. High school democrats and UC Irvine College Democrats. Those are the ones ‚Äî young people are important ‚Äî and we know that you guys are the future.‚Äù #Pandering
Highlights from the @NextGenAmerica #YouthVote forum last night: @DaveMinCA's hesitance to raise his hand on support for single-payer and sanctuary cities.		His arm got shorter and shorter the more uncomfortable he became at having to openly change his position.
@FrshSqueezedOC You have a fundamental misunderstanding of this account's purpose, which is to highlight the hypocrisy, duplicity, and dissemblance of @DaveMinCA.		If you can't handle snark or antagonism, get ready to plug your ears, shut your eyes, and yell "I can't hear you" for the general.
@BobbyBigWheel @DaveMinCA @NewUniversity @AdamGreen @DavidNir @databyler @TYTPolitics @NewUniversity says an more extensive version of the article is available on https://t.co/uXbYYKlXeE but it doesn't appear it's been published there yet.
Dave Min probably thinks: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to wait for then indepdent analysis and focus group results come out before I offer a substantive response to those issues.‚Äù https://t.co/mtqJJMj2hf
Stop the presses! @DaveMinCA has "I've actually worked with Democrats."		Please let @SenWarren and @KamalaHarris, who endorsed Katie, know they're not Democrats. Ditto to @SherrodBrown and @SenatorHarkin, who endorsed Kia. Better alert @BarackObama, Brian's former boss, as well. https://t.co/4qtZI7HoLw
The implication being that @KiaForCongress, @BrianForde, and @KatiePorterOC DO believe in raising taxes on working families?		It's clear that while Min pays lip service to @WorkingFamilies he's trying to reassure the 1%. "Your money is safe with me." #CA45 https://t.co/QaSpmtkftO
First up: Min's opposition to #SinglePayer healthcare, which puts him at odds with Californian voters, the current efforts of @KDeLeon, and gubernatorial frontrunner @GavinNewsom. 		Min offers a beautiful non-answer: "I'm not supporting this at this time, but I'm not against it." https://t.co/R4KX5Xywbg
Guys. We need to talk. @DaveMinCA has just been too much lately. In an interview with @NewUniversity he made some non-sense. If you're looking for another reason why Min is a confusing choice for Congress, please read on. CC: @AdamGreen, @DavidNir, @DataByler, @TYTPolitics #CA45

@LiberalChick Just @RepMarkTakano.
Remember when @Lake_Research did an internal poll for @DaveMinCA, but the results didn't show Min doing well against @RepMimiWalters so he never released it to the public or @DCCC? 		I do, like it was February 6, 2018. @CelindaLake, give us a sneak peek at how poorly Dave polled. https://t.co/NPbY6AQfBU
@RepMimiWalters Where's the beef?
1. Min relies on fear tactics to raise money, which proves he's just as disingenuous as I've being saying all along; or	2. Min is actually having financial difficulties and is actually in dire straits		He's either a liar or he's running out of cash. Or both. #CA45.
I was having a bad morning but then got an email from @DaveMinCA's finance director @FrancescaNLucia titled "I'm worried" and immediately felt at peace with the world.		I know what you're thinking: "That's just a fundraising tactic." Which is also okay, because:
Rumor has it @DaveMinCA called a big OC donor recently and demanded a meeting. When he was rebuffed he got "cocky," according to someone with knowledge of the call. The @CA_Dem endorsement has really gone to his head.		The good news? #DesperateDave is running out of money.
"I think we're in a strong position and most importantly we're the campaign that can beat @MimiWaltersCA. I'm running on something called the #DadAgenda."		1. Show us the money, Dave. Where's the poll showing you're the strongest vs. Mimi?	2. Enough with the "Dad Agenda" already.
.@DaveMinCA's question to @finkd if he were there: "To what degree is Facebook's whole business model about an intrusion on traditional privacy norms?"		Not the "nerdy" "wonky" answer I expected from Min. For someone who claims to have started in tech, it's a sophomoric question.
It's not in your resume because it's probably either untrue or an embellishment. Where are all your unicorn donors? Why are you running out of money if some of your "best friends in life" are big ballers in #tech?
.@DaveMinCA: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really in my resume but I started my career at a couple start-up tech companies. Some of my best friends in life are CEO‚Äôs of unicorns and things like that.‚Äù
Who was it? Please. Please share. If anyone was contacted by @DaveMinCA in the last year or so to run for office, feel free to reach out. I smell a weird, compulsive lie that he made up on the spot during the interview. #DaddyDelusions

I'll be Live Tweeting my listening of @DaveMinCA's interview with @kuciFM tomorrow. I've heard it's absolutely full of classic Minisms (read: lies). I. Can't. Wait.
.@EQCA, why did you just endorse a candidate who started a whisper campaign about one of his opponent's sexuality? @DaveMinCA isn't the type of person you should be embracing. He's a shameless bully. Definitely not a champion for the LGBTQ community.

@eqca @DaveMinCA This endorsement is ming boggling. lol Min hasn't done anything for the LGBTQ community that the other candidates haven't; he has no practical experience working with the community; he isn't better/different on the issues.		What a joke.
There‚Äôs a joke about name recognition in there somewhere... https://t.co/wmSBy8lFDo
He stands for gun violence so strongly that he didn‚Äôt turn up to support the students of the #NationalSchoolWalkout. 		Min tweets more than he acts. https://t.co/O09i30Y5X7
@mikehtrujillo @DaveMinCA I'm shocked. Shocked that Dave Min would do such a thing.
Apparently @DaveMinCA was talking himself up (back in the early days of the campaign) about how Bobby was going to endorse him. That never materialized when Dave tactlessly asked for Bobby's list before even getting to know him. 		That makes the recent list snatching even worse. https://t.co/AECbOIJF0i
It's no secret that spendthrift @DaveMinCA has struggled to raise the money his campaign needs. But stealing @AhnforCA34's list to solicit donors without permission is beyond the pale.		That's a good way to not only lose one big donor, but a multitude of them. #AmateurHour
If Dave had even a MINuscule idea of how to fundraise, he wouldn't be relying on hacks whose unethical practices get him into hot water with the donor class. This will greatly diMINish his ability to raise funds, something he was already struggling to do. #CA45 #BadDaveNoCookie https://t.co/uWX0QRRcgY
Like most Americans, I prefer my #patriarchy with a side of #mansplaining. I‚Äôm just not sure any of us could figure life out if it weren‚Äôt for #relatable folk like Dave Min. I mean, gosh. 		Where would women and young people be without the #DadAgenda? https://t.co/EOzB6zRiI8

Last thought on Dave's @PDAmerica questionnaire: he uses "I need to learn more" as a cop-out.		#CA45 voters: are we sending Dave to Congress to learn about progressive issues or to take a stand? The last thing we need is another #uninformed fence sitter.
"According to the @CEPR, subjecting all income over $250,000 to the Social Security payroll tax would impact only an estimated top 1.5 percent of wage earners." Closing tax loopholes and making millionaires pay into Social Security isn't a complicated idea, Dave. https://t.co/D7LrWGShke
.@DaveMinCA opposes @KeithEllison's Inclusive Prosperity Act, probably the Humphrey‚ÄìHawkins Act &amp; similar acts.

.@DaveMinCA does not support a #MedicareForAll single-payer system. He is on record multiple times saying that either it would be too much of a tax burden on the wealthy. He opposes the majority of Americans, and Californians, who are in favor of a single-payer system. #CA45 https://t.co/BaCGpVkTFh
.@DownWithTyranny, have you noticed the majority of @DaveMinCA endorsers haven't maxed out their donations? Maybe they don't believe in him as strongly as they'd like us to think.		Min can't pay for ads in endorsement tweets; he's hemmoraging cash and isn't raising nearly enough.
"THE ONLY CANDIDATE ENDORSED BY @CA_Dem" isn't the kind of specificity of language I'd expect from a law professor. Then again, maybe it explains why he lacks tenure. ü§∑		Here's a list of other candidates endorsed by the California Democratic Party: https://t.co/NYO24dEBNY
.@DaveMinCA's credentials as "someone who studies money" (lol) have always been suspect, but after seeing his latest ad I'm beginning to doubt his lawyerly credentials as well.
Pre-endorsement quarter: $212k	Post-endorsement quarter: $219k		The way he stamps the "ONLY CA DEM ENDORSED" on every piece of paper that comes across his desk you'd think it were a golden goose. But it's just another MINipulation; a shiny exterior on an otherwise empty suit.
.@PaigeHutchinson, has @DaveMinCA come around to supporting single-payer now that it's safe to do so? Or does he still think its a waste of taxpayer money? https://t.co/eGtS45Vn66

@ClaudiaPEREZOC @DPOC @katieporteroc Let me get this straight: because Fran is a woman, she's above criticism? Or because Fran is a woman, her terrible leadership must be tolerated?		Fran's shortcomings are gender neutral.
@emilyslist Too bad @DaveMinCA received the @CA_Dem endorsement, even after referring to @KatiePorterOC as a "nasty woman."
@BOLDPAC @DaveMinCA I hate to be that guy, but Dave is no progressive. He's a moderate Democrat (which isn't a sin, but also isn't what Bold Pac says it stands for). 		Remember that one time Dave and his campaign manager said he opposed #universalhealthcare because it would be a tax burden? I do.
.@PaigeHutchinson's boss is the kind of guy who swears he knows where to get the best carnitas burrito in town but is only ever seen eating Caesar salad wraps. #NationalBurritoDay
.@DPOC chair Fran Sdao is committing political malpractice by threatening to strip party members of their delegate status if they support anyone but @DaveMinCA. She must be modeling herself after @DWStweets: ruling through fear and intimidation. #WeakLeadership
.@DaveMinCA's newest branding push suggests he's "the honest and ethical candidate." Funny how the other candidates don't find it necessary to proclaim their honesty or ethicality. 		Thou doth protest too much, Dave.
It is shameful that a man who never misses an opportunity to wrap himself in the cloak of #MeToo continues to wage a behind the scenes whisper campaign of sexism and misogynistic ad hominem against the only woman in the race.
.@DaveMinCA has been conducting a smear campaign against @KatiePorterOC for the last several weeks. He's accused her of things I will never repeat and derided her endorsement by @EmilysList, saying, and I quote, "I would have got it if I had a uterus." When will enough be enough?
.@PaigeHutchinson, do you actually care about the @TownHallProject or do you just find their branding timely and convenient? It doesn't seem like you're trying to live up to the spirit or intention of their town hall. https://t.co/OLaUEkYOue
@downwithtyranny Terrifying.

Paging @DaveMinCA.		Step 1: Organize  last minute town hall when your opponents announce theirs;	Step 2: Latch onto zeitgeist and attempt to own it;	Step 3: Make it about you: "This is my fifth town hall, I'm very transparent."	Step 4: Wait to see if Min cancels or invites others https://t.co/9BmMBGiX9X
Obviously Desperate For Attention #DestroyABullyIn4Words
Someone on @DaveMinCA's staff please let him know that because @CA_Dem endorsed by the skin of their teeth doesn't mean we agree with his nastiness in closed-door meetings.		Trash talking @BrianForde's wife for her "disgusting behavior" at the convention? The irony is palpable.
‚ÄúSome California Democratic Party leaders have recently posited that too much competition in the upcoming primaries may be a bad thing. This is short sighted.‚Äú https://t.co/nqtufqW2uw
Moderate #NewDems endorse moderate wouldbe #NewDem. This. Is. Truly. Unexpected. 		There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a moderate Democrat of course. Aside from the fact that they adopt uninspired policies and preserve the status quo, which benefits no one and stems progress. https://t.co/1kUNEHlm5X
@BobHop62 @DaveMinCA @GregRaths Like I said: check my older tweets. There's no dishonesty there. All my allegations are credible/truthful. Your inability to get past my pseudonym does not impugn the validity of my criticisms. That's not how facts work.
According to @DaveMinCA's latest ad, he can now add "Endorsed by @Bounty Paper Towels" to his list of accomplishments. @Charmin Ultra Soft would have been more on-brand, but beggars can't be choosers, I guess. #TuesdayThoughts #DaddyTissues
@BobHop62 @DaveMinCA @GregRaths This account was created to point out when a certain candidate wasn't sticking to the facts. People like Trump get elected when you treat lies and misinformation as just another opinion and "let others decide whether they agree."		I'm here to provide #JustFactsNoBullshit.
@BobHop62 @DaveMinCA @GregRaths Scroll through the older tweets. I‚Äôll give you a shiny new nickel if you can find one that isn‚Äôt true.
@BobHop62 @DaveMinCA @GregRaths Hang out around his campaign enough and you‚Äôll hear it for yourself. And yes, it‚Äôs being said still.
Dishonest @DaveMinCA has been telling democrats that @GregRaths is running, and therefore there exists a risk that two Republicans will finish at the top in the June 5th primary. 		This is of course categorically untrue. But hey, we don‚Äôt call him #DishonestDave for nothing.
These issues are above @DaveMinCA's pay grade. How many #CA45 voters are confident in his ability to be an effective lawmaker in a way that restrains @realDonaldTrump? Min proved in @SenSchumer's office he wasn't even capable of standing up to Wall Street. https://t.co/tkFE3WrL0P

‚ÄúDave hasn‚Äôt thought about that yet,‚Äù said Paige Hutchinson, the campaign manager when asked whether he'd support @NancyPelosi. &lt;-- The very definition of disingenuous. Then again, Dave doesn't think about a lot of things.  https://t.co/Wy4SinzBTK

#IdesOfMarch are particularly relevant to my namesake, Mr. Dave Min. He's stabbed enough people in the back to know that it'll catch up to him eventually.
The facts @DaveMinCA doesn't want you to see as he peacocks as a progressive on healthcare while opposing #UniversalHealthCare. Not only is he on the wrong side of history, he's in the minority in his own state. https://t.co/tITB7h9xPW
Ah, yes. The candidate who rejected #UniversalHealthCare as "fringe" policy should definitely be the man to carry the banner in our battle for more healthcare coverage. That makes sense, right? https://t.co/CDAkCxqx9n
@TopherSpiro @RepMimiWalters @DaveMinCA Let's hope it's @BrianForde, @KiaForCongress, or @KatiePorterOC and not Dave that ends up running against Mimi. He doesn't have the funding, support, or credibility to assail her on healthcare (and many other issues).

@SlythSeeker2017 I agree, but it‚Äôs also important not to cut oneself off from dialogue. Not everyone who disagrees with you is a troll/bot! To change minds we need to keep ours open.
One wonders whether Min will become a recluse like @MimiWaltersCA if elected. Ever desperate for affirmation, Min will find townhalls unpleasant when faced with criticism. Unfortunately for him, society hasn‚Äôt quite yet reached @BlackMirror ‚Äî there‚Äôs no blocking in real life.
#MiffedMin has, like a handful of his supporters before him, used the block feature to avoid tough questions. This is the way of the #Minion: loudly proclaim loyalty, use personal attacks and innuendo when confronted, and block when backed into a corner. https://t.co/X5FAUqR8tE
@AdamMarangell @DaveMinCA @nytimes @MimiWaltersCA He will lose. Anti-single payer. No experience. Burning bridges left and right... in other words: the ideal Dem candidate to lose to Walters.
When your candidate doesn‚Äôt know the issues, can you blame his campaign manager for misrepresenting them? https://t.co/DG8tRMAfP8
@DeArmondB @RepMimiWalters We need to unite, but the person we unite behind needs to stand for our values. Uniting behind just any old democrat won‚Äôt do, and won‚Äôt be enough to flip the district.
@Chief_zero @RepMimiWalters The poll shows @katieporteroc winning, yet 30 local delegates endorsed @DaveMinCA. It will be up to voters to ensure the right candidate runs against Walters.
@democraticJon She wasn‚Äôt the only victim at the convention, unfortunately.
@PaigeHutchinson @DaveMinCA True. Nominate the wrong Democrat and CA45 will stay red. We need to nominate a true progressive to contrast with Walter‚Äôs conservatism. Someone who supports single payer; who doesn‚Äôt kowtow to the wealthy elite. Someone unlike Dave Min.
@NathanCarle @MimiWaltersCA @DaveMinCA @RepMimiWalters @katieporteroc Trolls gotta troll, and I‚Äôve gotta keep self-righteous Minions like yourself in their lane. 		Disliking what Min stands for and how he conducts himself is not a crime. Asking a candidate to disavow someone who disagrees with you is as preposterous as it is delusional.
@NathanCarle @MimiWaltersCA @DaveMinCA @RepMimiWalters @katieporteroc Denounce this account for being critical of Mr. Min? The horror! Stop the press! Someone disagrees with my candidate! Mommy! Help!
@NathanCarle @MimiWaltersCA @DaveMinCA @RepMimiWalters The first sentence is not germane, and the second is incorrect. If you sacrifice your values in order to win, you've already lost. When your argument boils down to Min being the lesser of two evils, it's not anyone's fault but his own for receiving negative attention.
This is being parroted by Min supporters: "Standing up against Min's bullying is helping @MimiWaltersCA."		NEWSFLASH: if @DaveMinCA's victory requires you to sacrifice your values; if it requires you to defend bad behavior... he's not the right candidate. #MinyMimi #BadMinions https://t.co/itvQDzkHEO

.@DaveMinCA recently learned pushing the #DadAgenda was rubbing women the wrong way. Focus groups said ‚Äúparents‚Äù are unisex and a larger demographic. In a shocking move to capture this newfound market, let it be known that Min now pursues the totally inclusive #ParentAgenda.

@DaveMinCA @cadem @RepMimiWalters @realDonaldTrump What a travesty. A man with no vision or understanding of the issues wins an endorsement through a solid ground game (albeit a ground game founded on intimidation and harassment). #CA45 has shot themselves in the foot.

@F0rwardM0mentum @yassaminansari @DaveMinCA @KamalaHarris @SenWarren @SenSherrodBrown Transparent attempts to make a petition racist are transparent. Your criticism has neither substance nor [rhetorical] style.

2. "Sit down. Stop causing drama" is their response to women speaking out.

#IStayPositiveBy living by the age old adage, "If you need help realizing what you deserve out of life, befriend a pathological liar." I'm just a big helper, constantly pushing those around me closer to discovering their true worth. #YoureWelcome
My campaign staff is 100% female. But don't worry, there's a strong #daddy in charge! #GoRedForWomen

Does anyone have the contact info for the defense lawyers? I have a fundraising benchmark to reach before lunch. #AskingForAFriend #TaintedMoney #DaddysLittleSecret https://t.co/Xu8bIAX7ms
I'm observing #WorldReadAloudDay by reading my campaign finance reports, skipping over the part where I accepted money from @JaredKushner's lawyer Jamie Gorelick. Taking money from guys who are defending #Trump &amp; Co. from legal ethics issues is always nice. #WinningOrSinning
Don't expect the lies you spread to stay a secret forever.  They will come back to bite you in the tushy. #WednesdayWisdom
@CryptoCabra As someone who has never told a lie, I can honestly say that
I'm really curious about a lot of things. Syria. China. Taiwan. Does anyone have any book recommendations so I could brush up on these issues? Does anyone know if @UCIrvine offers a discount to would-be politicians who need a crash course in foreign policy? #TuesdayThoughts
#MyWelcomeMatWouldRead "I Hope No One Notices That Many of the Delegates Who Said They Would Vote for Me at the Convention Will Not Actually Be Eligible to Cast Their Vote and Therefore Their Support Is Misleadingly Inflated." It just rolls off the tongue, don't ya think?
I can say with the utmost confidence that I have raised the most money in #CA45 despite the fact that finance reports are not public and I have no idea how much anyone else has raised. üí∞üîÆü§ë #WhenYouKnowYouKnow #DaddyIntuition
My campaign is on track to raise every penny I'll ever need to run successfully -- currently estimated at $2,000,000.35. #EconomicExpert #DidTheMath https://t.co/jII1sKh8tM
#ThingsThatCreepMeOut when a certain Other Dave tried to have this account taken down for impersonation. Just be honest with everyone and verify which of these Tweets hit close enough to home to be considered truthful enough to be impersonation. #PleaseDaddy
I'm a pretty forgetful guy, so often times I'll say lil' fibs here and there and then deny it later because I can't remember saying them. Help me remember by submitting untruths I've spoken to DishonestDave45@gmail.com! https://t.co/NnOTf00HAJ
.@DaveMinCA (1) my account name is not your name, and (2) my bio states this is a parody account. This account couldn't be construed as "impersonating" you unless you were actually this patronizing, insecure, and dishonest. Unless you're trying to tell us something...? üòé
I will always protect a woman's right to choose, unless they can't decide where to go for dinner. (Am I right, dads?? lol )#DadJokes #DadAgenda
Wow, @huangmiller! You're a regular Sherlock Holmes. Keep up the good work, detective!
This is fantastic news. "Are You My Friend" is actually a catchphrase of mine, as the delegates at @CA_Dem know all too well. lolol Don't mind the camera, guys, it's just to ensure you're putting your vote where your mouth is. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 https://t.co/uYdjkMkTUT
#IWouldNameMyRockBand noMINally. It just has so many meanings. Like my campaign, it's versatile!
I don't get the #GrammySoMale thing. Dads are male and dads are awesome. We need to support our community of fathers. Lift each other up, boys! Don't let the haters get to you. #BoyPower #DaddyStrong
To date one of my proudest accomplishments is having personally met 20,000 individual human beings. (Pregnant women count as one, even when carrying twins.) This year I want to bump that number up to 25,000. Please start returning my calls, guys! #MotivationMonday
People often stop me on the street and ask, ‚ÄúDave, what‚Äôs up with the dad joke generator on your website?‚Äù Don‚Äôt they understand that having robot slaves create lame jokes on demand is the most innovative thing congressional campaigns have seen in generations? #DaddyDisruptor
I‚Äôm running on the #DadAgenda because the #patriarchy hasn‚Äôt gotten a fair shake. It‚Äôs 2018, people. Time to embrace cutesy paternalism and traditional gender roles. #YesDaddy
@socalmacias @MartinOMalley Yes, thank you. I have a PhD.
@socalmacias @MartinOMalley Trump‚Äôs America and everyone else‚Äôs, though I do have an enduring respect for the youth currently protesting Putin‚Äôs tyranny. Huzzah!
@cetjaf @MartinOMalley The funny/sad thing is everything posted here is true. üò± Thanks for your support, champ!
@socalmacias @MartinOMalley Exactly, Alexa! Always let the write one in. You are the reason I have so much hope for our countries future! #NothingIsImpossible
It's important to remind the #youth to strive for the impossible. One illustration of this is the time I voted for @MartinOMalley in the CA primary despite the fact that he wasn't on the ballot. Some said it wasn't possible. I didn't let that stand in my way. #FollowYourDreams
@downwithtyranny Oh wow. Big guy with the spellcheck, huh? Try being named Dave for a day. See how far you can walk in these shoes, pal.
@downwithtyranny I'll get you for this, Howie Klien!!
