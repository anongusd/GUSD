@shestheman @Jennyi43 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife We didn't. The sources are in the articles, Don't be so closed-minded.		But since you are not open to the truth there is no reason to continue. 		Muted.
@shestheman @Jennyi43 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife LOL we're not the source. Investigations, Congress, state agencies etc cited in the articles are the source. Try again.
@TNMouth Thank you.
@TNMouth No excuses. The votes are the votes. Dems blocked defunding in the Senate, as we provided proof for a few tweets ago.

@TNMouth Omnibus with defunding would have been defeated by Dem filibuster. We did try harder. Blame the right people, not the pro-life Republicans who have tried to defund.

@ChosenOfEnlil @benshapiro The abortion procedure is not – ever – necessary to save the life of a mother. There are, however, maternal health risks that require a treatment that cause the unfortunate, indirect, and unintentional death of an unborn child.
@ChosenOfEnlil @benshapiro Except we provided evidence from a specific conference of 140 medical professionals gathered to address this exact issue, who reached the conclusion they are not.
@ChosenOfEnlil @benshapiro Merely to make a proposal stand in court around a what if. It's not any admission that abortions are actually medically necessary.

@ChosenOfEnlil @benshapiro A claim they are... doesn't mean the claim is true.
@ChosenOfEnlil @benshapiro It's a what if. Not recognizing that abortion is needed. Keep Googling.
@ChosenOfEnlil @benshapiro You haven't shown that to be true.

@ChosenOfEnlil @bethtay37689300 @benshapiro The Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland confined an abortion would not have saved Savita’s life.  Instead, mismanagement surrounding Savita’s care was determined as the main cause of her tragic death.
@guiscaesar @benshapiro Except they are acknowledged in multiple areas of the law, even though you don't agree.
@ChosenOfEnlil @benshapiro “As experienced practitioners and researchers in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, we affirm that direct abortion is not medically necessary to save the life of a woman."
@ChosenOfEnlil @benshapiro Experts in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, mental health, and molecular epidemiology presented new research, and shared clinical experiences on issues surrounding maternal healthcare to the packed Symposium attended by more than 140 Irish medical professionals.

@MaryCohen68 There is a downside to ending the filibuster. When Dems control Congress and WH again they would railroad through a bill that would legalize abortions up to birth, infanticide, and overturn every pro-life law nationwide.

@rebekahap @FreedomReigns78 @Amyloukingery Actually most late-term abortions are on healthy babies. https://t.co/jkFzq9vxzp
@benjoel26 @amandapalmer Thanks for your opinion, we respectfully disagree. The meaning is very clear.
@FakeCrypt @wendymarie5980 @mrszowiejones Ever heard of parenting? It happens.
@catherineb2319 We get poetry, but thanks for the condescension.
@inkstains10 There is a grieving process associated with killing someone? Where is the compassion for the baby who was killed?
@benjoel26 @amandapalmer No one is demonized. Disagreement isn't demonization.
@FakeCrypt How can it be false when her entire song is referenced including the lyrics.? Sorry you don't like that people disagree with her views. No morals is finger-pointing and name-calling, like you did.

@Voldfield284 @ShellyCov The lawsuit specifically says their child is "an additional unplanned child" and that they wanted the abortion "to maintain and limit the size of their family.”		They didn't want to have to raise this child. It's disgustingly clear.
@Voldfield284 @ShellyCov They headline is 100% accurate.		They had an abortion because they didn't want the baby. otherwise there was no reason to have an abortion in the first place.

@RealLiteSleeper And it would just be overturned right now. Not a matter of backbone, matter of SCOTUS ruling.
@evsmimi They are abortion activists pushing for late-term abortions...
@RealLiteSleeper Because an abortion ban would still probably be overturned under Roe until SCOTUS reverses. Can easily ban after SCOTUS overturns. There are other cases moving up to challenge Roe so another test case isn't needed.

@RoseHazel12 We disagree. The headline is totally accurate. But appreciate your perspective.
@ReformedBritt @marmstrong2014 Agreed.
@RoseHazel12 The first sentence of the 2nd paragraph literally says the opposite of that:		Sen. Jason Smalley, a pro-life Republican, said he believes unborn babies’ lives should be protected....
@marmstrong2014 @ReformedBritt We've already said the bill should be amended to not prosecute women. As we've reported for 26 years, that's been a hallmark of the pro-life movement.		https://t.co/mw08TWVE4e
@RoseHazel12 What is misleading? It;s 100% accurate.
@ProLifeDad4ever The opposite is true. But we've already educated you on this before and you persist with the same false claims.		https://t.co/AJbuV4I61d

@RoseHazel12 Agreed. But, that can easily be amended out. He could merely have worked out an agreement with the sponsor for such an exemption before the hearing or moved in committee to amend the bill.

@JeffEpps16 @GOPLeader No because as soon as you remove the filibuster you invite Democrats, when they have power again, to push through their bill to invalidate every single pro-life law in America.
@LotteChitty @jodipicoult Nothing about the article is ridiculous. It's based on factual information about the number of babies dying in abortions worldwide last year.

There have been over TWO WEEKS of calls for Democrat Ralph Northam to resign after he promoted infanticide.		Just because the liberal media moved on, it doesn't mean we will.		Northam needs to go. 		#RalphNortham #RalphNorthamResign
@xan_desanctis Totally agree. Here is our take:		The abortion culture should be blamed for convincing vulnerable parents like Zirlott that the most compassionate thing they can do for an unborn child with disabilities is to subject them to a violent death. 		https://t.co/eCBIYvoSG8

@mhowarth_ @EzekielMajors @SarahsCunning @sun_shine_Bill @caulfieldj600 @JudgeJeanine Muting now. You just want to hear yourself talk as opposed to discussing actual science.
@mhowarth_ @EzekielMajors @SarahsCunning @sun_shine_Bill @caulfieldj600 @JudgeJeanine All they did was list 30 studies showing evidence of fetal pain. Sorry you're too closed-minded to actually engage with the data.
@mhowarth_ @EzekielMajors @SarahsCunning @sun_shine_Bill @caulfieldj600 @JudgeJeanine Easy to see premature babies and babies in the womb during surgery respond to pain.
@mhowarth_ @EzekielMajors @SarahsCunning @sun_shine_Bill @caulfieldj600 @JudgeJeanine By 7 weeks, pain “sensory receptors appear in the perioral [mouth] area.” ∼ New England Journal of Medicine		By 14 weeks, preborn humans exhibit conscious “motor planning” and “social behavior.”  ∼ PLoS ONE

@mhowarth_ @EzekielMajors @SarahsCunning @sun_shine_Bill @caulfieldj600 @JudgeJeanine The research shows that the nervous system develops much sooner than had previously been thought, which could point to pain sensitivity.

@debsuhr1960 No, President Trump was accurate:		ex·e·cute	verb	2. carry out a sentence of death	synonyms: put to death		Leaving a baby to die is putting a baby to death. It's actually worse than an execution because the baby never got a day in court.
When the CEO of Planned Parenthood is more upset at how President Trump condemned infanticide than infanticide itself.	 https://t.co/bYftyKkdtc
@DrLeanaWen @realDonaldTrump President Trump was accurate.		As Northam said:		“If a mother is in labor…the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired..." https://t.co/6ncFoe55js

@KiKi1185 And they will.
@debsuhr1960 Trump was right. It is an execution of a baby via death by neglect/failure to provide medical care. 		Such a decision is purposeful, like an execution.		Don';t lose the plot.
@JonnyLawrenceI1 When it's declared unconstitutional it won't save a single baby from abortion.
@Wheeler_Pol Not yet that we know of.
@LilaGraceRose Thanks for sharing the truth Lila!
@mogicrz And Republicans approved and President Bush signed a prior bill stopping infanticide during his presidency.

@ctztforester @LeeSouthwell96 @StevenErtelt @SBAList Did you not read any of the tweets we sent? We lost the votes to defund....
@LeeSouthwell96 @ctztforester @StevenErtelt @SBAList The bigger point is worry less about what ifs and more about what is... what is the case is the Senate now has votes to defund and we need the House now.
@LeeSouthwell96 @ctztforester @StevenErtelt @SBAList a. Our understanding is there are reserve funds that go into play.		b. PP gets its funding here via reimbursements. They'd probably just have a delay on the reimbursements and then get the funds and likely sue if they didn't get them.		But the shutdown ended so...
@LeeSouthwell96 @ctztforester @StevenErtelt @SBAList Trump has been defuding. https://t.co/6G8yte7zby		But yes, a pro-abortion President won't defund PP, obviously.

@TwitJanet No, we're saying MFL is saying the kids were victims. Sorry for any confusion.
@MarlonLee1 She said it yesterday, easy to copy and pate in Google.
@lynnsdoll Yes but there are no Republicans running for president except President Trump at this time.

@TwitJanet That's what MFL is saying.
@RuthMBusby Wasn't meant to be funny. It's sarcasm to expose the Left's outrage against pro-life teens but tolerance of abortions until birth.
@KatyHatesMayo @GurlPower72 @cleanjimin Why is every reply just hate?
@KatyHatesMayo @GurlPower72 @cleanjimin But you haven't proven anything a lie.
@KatyHatesMayo @mandyyurkanin @pistrix Actually it's a peer-reviewed study published in a medical journal.

@RainMirron Those sources are false. It claims we are not factual and provides no proof except a Snopes article that we've proven false.
@RainMirron Where does it say it is pro-life? 		You have provided no proof the web site is even factual. And WHO CARES WHAT SOME RANDOM WEB SITE SAYS.		We are YOU so desperate to trash us that you rely on some random web site?
@RainMirron @VampLuv83 You haven't cited any problematic methods. What methods are so problematic?
@RainMirron @VampLuv83 And a non-factual web site making unsubstantiated claims has no bearing on OUR beliefs.
@RainMirron @LifeNewsToo So you celebrate abortions too?
@RainMirron @LifeNewsToo Oprah is promoting killing babies in abortions. If that is not shameful to you then are you really even pro-life? 		How can you defend supporting abortions and claim to be pro-life?
@RainMirron @LifeNewsToo Except he did promise to appoint judges faithful to the Constitution and pro-life groups endorsed him as a result. https://t.co/9LtiJL9kZj
@RainMirron @VampLuv83 We are a science and fact based web site. But you are using a non  fact-based web site to claim we're not. That fact check web site, when saying we're biased o r not factual, has no facts.		We cite all of OUR sources, unfortunately that web site that says we;re not factual doesnt
@VampLuv83 We understand where you are coming from. We're condemning the hypocrisy of abortion activists who trashed a bunch of pro-life kids for doing nothing but who don't condemn toxicity from their side. 		Anything else you think we are saying beyond that, we are not saying.

@VampLuv83 @RainMirron We're done replying to the thread. It's odd how a pro-life person uses a non-pro-life web site to made pro-lifers look bad. This has been the strangest conversation.
@VampLuv83 The same liberal activists and liberal media who are comparing pro-life teens to the KKK and called for doxxing kids for merely dancing with a Native American man's drumbeat did not condemn the same behavior done by liberals to a Trump supporter,		Our wording is not the issue.
@RainMirron @VampLuv83 Who cares what some random web site that's not even pro-life says. We are a pro-life news outlet. Our only bias is pro-life. And unless you're not pro-life there is no reason to have an issue with that.
@RainMirron @VampLuv83 We use all sorts of hashtags on our stories to attract readers, everyone does. That means nothing.		At the end of the day, we are pro-life. If you're pro-life too then we agree.

@RainMirron @VampLuv83 Anyway, there is no bias and misinformation here at LifeNews. We accurately report pro-life news. Not sure why someone who is pro-life is trying so hard to besmirch the reputation of a pro-life organization, especially using non-pro-life web sites to try to do that.

@RainMirron @VampLuv83 2nd: That KGOV web site is run by a hardcore right-wing conspiracy theorist who makes a living trashing pro-lifers.		President Bush compiled a pro-life record while in office and selected quite a number of pro-life judges. https://t.co/IFOb51omNR
@RainMirron @VampLuv83 Here is what one TNS professor said about pro-lfiers:		https://t.co/Ii76SVrsAk		So you are literally relying on a pro-abortion web site to attack us. How can you be pro-life and do that?

@RainMirron @VampLuv83 A pro-abortion web site calls us biased. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯		If you're pro-life, why would you rely on pro-abortion information? Makes no sense.		And what misinformation? You didn't mention any examples.
@VampLuv83 That's weird. The tweet is OPPOSING toxicity. It's literally opposing toxic harassment of someone. Not sure why you're confused about that.

@lkoneal @BamaStephen @SouthernKeeks @RedState We did. 		Muting conversation. Ceased to be productive ages ago.
@lkoneal @SouthernKeeks @RedState Okay, have a good day. Not interested in name-calling.
@lkoneal @SouthernKeeks @RedState He smiled and danced with the drummer. How awful.
@anghunt26 @AndreaNRuth @SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @RedState We don't have an unwavering support for Trump. He was last on our list of candidates in 2016. 		Please deal with what we wrote, not what you think we wrote.
@anghunt26 @AndreaNRuth @SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @RedState The only point we have is that everyone should be welcomed to the March for Life regardless of their politics or what they wear and they shouldn't be told to keep their pro-life politics at home.
@lkoneal @SouthernKeeks @RedState They were dancing. If you've been to any youth concerts recently you'd see the same thing.
@markayAcheson Thanks for the input.
@Eandhistoaster But we're not doing that. :)
@anghunt26 @SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @RedState We've made that clear repeatedly. Ross writes		"the pro-life cause should work very hard at not shutting others out for any reason."		And then she tells Trump supporters to leave their MAGA gear at home.		If you say welcome everyone then actually welcome everyone.
@BamaStephen @lkoneal @SouthernKeeks @RedState ..... "Don’t ban #MAGA wear," ...		So we agree. :)

@Eandhistoaster Thanks!
@mleighmiller @SouthernKeeks Nuance indeed:  Ross writes that the March should celebrate tolerance and diversity and wants pro-life politics left at home. So which is it?		Should people leave their religion at home too? That can be divisive.
@lkoneal @SouthernKeeks @RedState We've been for changing hearts and minds for decades. Same team.
@lkoneal @SouthernKeeks @RedState We never advocated making the March about politicians. We don't even run the March.		The message of the March was lost because the liberal media and abortion advocates falsely accused some teens of harassment and racism. Perspective please.
@righty64 @AndreaNRuth @SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @RedState We agree. That's what our country has devolved to.
@anghunt26 @AndreaNRuth @SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @RedState Yep, we don't care about others, which is why we've dedicated our lives to fighting abortion, why we have worked closely for years with pro-life blacks, Hispanics, gays, Democrats etc. and why we think an article about EXCLUDING people is wrong.		That must be it.
@SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @RedState We've been advocating a nonpartisan pro-life movement for 26 years and helped found Democrats for Life. Glad you agree,

@righty64 @AndreaNRuth @SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @RedState Actually 2 Democrats spoke. There would be more but 98% of Democrat politicians are pro-abortion.
@johnvgerardi @anghunt26 @CaseyMattox_ @SouthernKeeks @RedState We've had quite a number of articles on NIH funding aborted baby parts and the work to stop that. It gets volume from us.
@lkoneal @SouthernKeeks @RedState Our only priority is ending abortion. If you think it's anything other than that you've misread our 26 years of fighting to end abortion. Part of ending abortion is political. It's ultimately impossible to end abortion without laws to protect the unborn, which requires politics.
@jwvansteenwyk @SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @RedState Imagine that.
@AndreaNRuth @SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @RedState Novel thought: If you write an article claiming to celebrate tolerance and diversity at the March for Life... then tolerate diversity.		And what is tacky about making America great?
@markayAcheson They are the subject of the article. Nothing is being done to heap ridicule or criticism on them, in fact the opposite is true. We're defending them.
@SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @RedState Nothing was untruthful about what we've written. To flippantly label criticism and disagreement untruthful is a rude dismissal of the thesis of someone's retort.		Address the substance without the needless labeling please. THAT is not a good look.
@SouthernKeeks @CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @RedState We were truthful. But here is more truth...		Your article is written in a context in which the ONLY debate is over teens wearing #MAGA hats. 		And it claims to support tolerance and diversity yet doesn't tolerate people expressing political support for a pro-life president.

@johnvgerardi @anghunt26 @CaseyMattox_ @SouthernKeeks @RedState Agreed, bioethics have been the exception to the good record on abortion and personnel. It also hasn't gotten as much volume unfortunately as it was back in the Bush days.
@anghunt26 @CaseyMattox_ @SouthernKeeks @RedState Ross writes		"For those who are unaware, the pro-life movement is one of diversity and inclusiveness."		Then she tells Trump supporters to leave their hats at home.		Doesn't sound particularly inclusive or diverse -- especially in light of the harassment they are now enduring.
@johnvgerardi @anghunt26 @CaseyMattox_ @SouthernKeeks @RedState That has certainly been a disappointment for us all and is a stain on an otherwise good record. The good news is the Trump admin is moving in the right direction on stopping the funding and putting $ towards ethical alternatives.
@CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @SouthernKeeks @RedState And the thread actually began with us noting how Kimberly Ross wrote		"the pro-life cause should work very hard at not shutting others out for any reason. "		as she sought to exclude Trump supporters.
@CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @SouthernKeeks @RedState If you're aware of the challenges than you understand it makes no sense to blame President Trump as he and his administration are literally in the process of ending various streams of Planned Parenthood funding and after he cut off one on week one of his presidency.
@CaseyMattox_ @anghunt26 @SouthernKeeks @RedState And WHY is it still funded? If you answered President Trump you'd be wrong.		https://t.co/uawJWHpFfe

@anghunt26 @CaseyMattox_ @SouthernKeeks @RedState What has he not done that you think he needs to do?
@CaseyMattox_ @SouthernKeeks @RedState Trump has governed at least as pro-life as any past president, if not moreso.
Only one of these is racism. https://t.co/AJQ8qpf3Vz
@SouthernKeeks Our reaction to your article is a "problem?"		The problem seems to be inconsistently advocating for a March for Life that welcomes diversity and excluding those people whose political attire you disagree with -- not our pointing that out.
@SouthernKeeks Speaking of "misinterpretations," let's address yours.		LifeNews has spent 26 years advocating both legislation and changing hearts and minds to support women and children and saving babies from abortion. Both work and both are needed.		Not sure why you need to portray otherwise
@SouthernKeeks Because this screams "Thanks for the good faith reply:"		"If you have an issue, message me directly instead of spreading your misinterpretations all over the place like you did last time. "		¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@SouthernKeeks And we only have one Savior here at LifeNews. His name is Jesus Christ.
@SouthernKeeks And yes, President Trump has defunded PP in part and is presently working to defund PP in other parts. Thanks for the reminder to share this again. :)		https://t.co/6G8yte7zby
@SouthernKeeks Wow, didn't expect that kind of hateful reply. Sorry that you make public claims but don't expect a public reply to those claims.		Your article goes on and on about how everyone is welcome at the MFL and then you exclude people based on their politics. Seems inconsistent.

Why haven't liberals and reporters deleted or apologized for tweets falsely blaming the #maga kids? 		Because they never have to face consequences. They won't get suspended, won't lose their jobs and won't get doxxed.		And they will do the same thing again next time.
Here's the video liberals are using to say the #maga kids harassed Nathan Phillips.		* The kids are just dancing to his drumbeat	* Phillips keeps playing so they can dance	* Not only do they NOT harass Phillips, one kid says "Leave him alone"	* He could have left any time. https://t.co/N3T56lgFl2
@SoftPocket The tweeters like you are the ones who make up lies about people and laugh when they can in trouble because of what you did.

@pitacom @RepSeanDuffy That's false. The U.S. has added more than 2.6 million new jobs over the past 12 months. Unemployment is at record lows.	 	Wages increased 0.4 percent last month, pushing total wage growth to 3.2 percent for 2018.

@sinisterporpois @MichelleReuthe4 Sorry you are too closed-minded to article read the article and consider information from a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that refutes your claims.		And also... https://t.co/6F6x1lilbv
@Donnalee222 We did already but didn't have room for it in this tweet. https://t.co/yLSe6Dqx5e
@sinisterporpois @MichelleReuthe4 No, it's a report about a study authored by economists Phillip Levine and Douglas Staiger and appeared in The Journal of Law and Economics and other studies on the topic.
@sinisterporpois @MichelleReuthe4 "Banning abortion doesn't stop it."		Thanks for admitting it does.		We're not concerned with anyone's womb, we oppose killing babies.
@sinisterporpois @MichelleReuthe4 No we don't hate LGBT people. We've featured many articles from and about pro-life LGBT people.
@sinisterporpois @MichelleReuthe4 Parents putting their children in a school that best suits their needs isn't even close to hating people.		And proven laws have proven time and time again to reduce abortions. https://t.co/RCHObw4Lbu
@sinisterporpois @MichelleReuthe4 Your hating on people doesn't make the word a better place.
Hope for the future. A new poll finds:		* 70% of Millennials support limits on abortion	* Only 7%agree with Democrats on abortion up to birth	* More Millennials than not support Roe’s reversal	* By 3 to 1 margin millenials would rather fund health centers than Planned Parenthood

@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy We could go on and on but we actually need to focus on saving babies today not refuting friendly fire.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "They understood that if we are ever to end the evil of abortion, we’ll need more than the support of conservative Republicans."		LifeNews has been reporting on pro-life Dems for 26 years and helped DFLA get started.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "However, they didn’t dedicate themselves to the defense of ostensibly pro-life politicians on every issue or point of controversy."		False. Most pro-life groups still solidly support Trump.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "https://t.co/IyiZiamHPX has been harming its own credibility with these practices over the past few years. "		False. We're getting more readers and more kind words than ever before. Our readership keeps growing exponentially.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "https://t.co/IyiZiamHPX’s new focus hasn’t just included making issues relevant to defending Trump, but also fuel for the outrage machine that’s meant to keep the right in a never-ending state of angst."		False. Ignores the 1000s of positive stories we've done over 2 decades.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "If you think a freshman California Congresswoman issuing a profane call to impeach President Trump has nothing to do with the pro-life cause, you’d be right. "		False. Impeaching a pro-life president certain;y impacts the pro-life cause.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "If Lifenews kept to limiting itself to stories related solidly to pro-life issues, it would have very little to say about the Trump Administration."		False. Trump has a lengthy pro-life record already and some pro-life groups and leaders have said he's governed solidly pro-life.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "Trump has signed bills that have provided $1.5 billion in funding to Planned Parenthood during his time in office."		False. He wanted PP defunded, we lost the vote.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "Many grassroots pro-lifers have complained that, despite promises to defund Planned Parenthood, the President continued to send the abortion behemoth hundreds of millions of dollars."		False. See https://t.co/XMnFtYqaGe
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "but the President refuses to sign the Democrat’s funding bill, not because of abortion, but because it doesn’t fund his border security policies."		False. See previous tweet re SAP
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy "However, the linking of the two facts implies President Trump is refusing to sign the bill over Planned Parenthood funding. "		False. The SAP clearly mentions abortion concerns, as we reported.
@shanevanderhart @CaffThoughts @idahoguy Can't even get past your lede.... "To find #prolife news on https://t.co/Zco9aAlXWr  one has to wade through a lot Team Trump cheerleading that has little to do with the pro-life cause."		That's false on so many levels. We only do pro-life news. Been that way since 1992.

@TimOverlin @She_Brings_Joy It's breaking news because the vote tomorrow was just announced. Senate didn't have the votes to pass last year. No change in pro-life stance.
@TimOverlin @She_Brings_Joy The fact is Democrats filibustered pro-life legislation and we didn't have votes to overcome the filibuster. We still may not but it's worth giving it a try since we got more votes in the Senate in November.		It also tells House Dems their abortiin funding agenda is a nonstarter.
@TimOverlin @She_Brings_Joy Sorry you have to make a crass political statement on the back of trying to protect babies from abortion. We've not providing cover for anyone. Out only goal is to end abortion. Shame on you for making the disgusting accusation otherwise.

@Jadmai Muting again. The science is clear that abortion hurts women, as most peer-reviewed studies show. Have a good day.
@Jadmai The truth is https://t.co/JUbfbkjCzu
@Jadmai We didn't cite ourselves. We reported on a review published in Sage Open Medicine.  https://t.co/3P0wBbsHKs
@Jadmai Actually https://t.co/aDpoXKhux6
@Jadmai Try again. https://t.co/42zdzCcfol
@Jadmai And now you're reduced to attacking us and can't even get the year of the study correct. Looks like there's little reason to continue the conversation. Good day. #muting
@Jadmai The study was from 2012. But it covered data from parts of 4 decades. https://t.co/1x9KpVIXSl
Youngest Black Legislator in America is 19 and Pro-Life https://t.co/NDCySMVoHv #maga #Prolife https://t.co/KCFbv6WpOw
@Jadmai You know you've lost the argument when you're reduced to attacking the authors of a study instead of the study itself.
@Jadmai Yes appealing to a politicized medical group that has lost 1000s of members as a result really refutes science.
@Jadmai And for the record, Koop called for more studies on how abortion hurts women. And now we have them.
@Jadmai So if you want to rely on conclusions from the 1980s instead of modern medical science, ten feel free to be a scientific neanderthal.
@Jadmai In fact, the final “report” was not a report at all. Instead it was merely a letter to the President explaining why there was insufficient data on which to base a report. And at the time there wasn't the long list of studies we have now.
@Jadmai So you don't really know what happened with Dr. Koop, you just cut and pasted something and twist Koop’s non-report into a claim that no dangers to abortion could be found, ergo, abortion is safe.
@Jadmai The fact remains that the overall conclusion of studies is abortion is worse for women than childbirth.
@Jadmai Giving birth, on the other hand, was shown to reduce women’s suicide risk compared to the general population.
@Jadmai Anyone can examine the data, which found that women who had state-funded abortions were 2.6 times more likely to die from suicide compared to women who delivered their babies.
@Jadmai So you can't actually refute the study, which is based on data from the California government, in what is probably the most pro-abortion state in America. Got it.
@Jadmai Not dense at all. lol		We understand if a medical procedure is needed to save a mother's life but ends up hurting her baby. But a. doctors have an obligation to try to save both patients and b. you'd e hard pressed to find a case where purposefully killing a baby saves her life.
@CaffThoughts @idahoguy What kind of pro-life blog attacks pro-lifers TWICE within the span of three days? 		https://t.co/vNMEA0nXii		Did we close down Planned Parenthood and now you have all this time on your hands to trash pro-lifers? Grow up and move on, this is life or death not high school.
@CaffThoughts @idahoguy YOU: LifeNews should focus more on Planned Parenthood's racist past.		We literally ran an opinion column yesterday on that.		https://t.co/7mZyV4UqFV
@CaffThoughts @idahoguy Short take: LifeNews is less pro-life because it supports pro-life President Donald Trump for being pro-life.
@CaffThoughts @idahoguy Must be no more babies left to save from abortion if you have time to trash pro-lifers. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@Jadmai Yes, because scientists NEVER rely on studies done by scientists from other nations. #facepalm 		And we cited an American study. But you're SO desperate to deny facts.
@Jadmai No  one is forcing anyone to have a baby. You've heard of contraception?

@Jadmai In neither case is an abortion medically necessary and in many such cases the diagnosis has been wrong.		https://t.co/0lpxvF6DCu
@Jadmai Giving birth, on the other hand, was shown to reduce women’s suicide risk compared to the general population.
@Jadmai Linking these records to death certificates, the researchers found that women who had state-funded abortions were 2.6 times more likely to die from suicide compared to women who delivered their babies.
@Jadmai One U.S. study examined Medi-Cal records for more than 173,000 low-income California women who had experienced abortion or childbirth.
@Jadmai Alas the analysis we cited covered WORLDWIDE studies. 		But since you like American-only studies.... Large record-based studies from the United States have found that overall death rates were higher among women following abortion compared to those among women who had given birth.

@TheOtherParas @Jadmai @WillWtroyer Keep up. We're citing another study that is a meta-analysis. https://t.co/ePBG2T4HUa		"Within a year of their pregnancy outcomes, women experiencing a pregnancy loss are over twice as likely to die compared to women giving birth."
@TheOtherParas @Jadmai @WillWtroyer Happy to flood your mentions with examples of pro-abortion hate.  There are people on both sides of the abortion debate who say hurtful things.		But nice job desperately trying to change the subject.
@TheOtherParas @Jadmai @WillWtroyer A meta-analysis of ALL worldwide studies on the issue found childbirth is safer than abortion for women. "Within a year of their pregnancy outcomes, women experiencing a pregnancy loss are over twice as likely to die compared to women giving birth."
@TheOtherParas @Jadmai @WillWtroyer That is the mot clueless tweet ever. We're CONDEMNING that.
@TheOtherParas @Jadmai @WillWtroyer Yes abortion is super safe for black women. https://t.co/nvOI3B7oHI
@TheOtherParas @Jadmai @WillWtroyer The study involved over 500,000 women covering a span of decades.
@Jadmai @TheOtherParas @WillWtroyer This isn’t a biased study with a relatively small sample size. This research was conducted at the national level, over the course of a decade, providing substantial credibility, a comprehensive level of detail, as well as earning publication in respected medical journals.
@Jadmai @TheOtherParas @WillWtroyer The medical records are profoundly reliable because the data was compiled from Danish government sources including fertility records of births and stillbirths, the national abortion registry and cause of death registry.	The study covers an extensive period.
@Jadmai @TheOtherParas @WillWtroyer The record were used because they are the most comprehensive abortion record anywhere. The study includes a large number of women—nearly one-half-million—experiencing first-time pregnancies.
@March_for_Life Let's make it happen!
@TheOtherParas @Jadmai @WillWtroyer Here is a link to the study. https://t.co/1x9KpVIXSl		Other studies have confirmed this.

@Jadmai @WillWtroyer We want to save both mother and child. :)
@TheOtherParas @Jadmai @WillWtroyer Actually...		During the first six months after an early abortion (12 weeks or less), a woman has double the risk of death compared to birth.	    	During the first year following a late abortion (after 12 weeks) a woman has over three times the risk of death compared to birth.
@TheOtherParas @LifeSite Actually this is the LifeNews account and we're men and women who value life. 		https://t.co/rpvJU4OKcA		You're not inhibiting our work to protect women and children. :)
@fatooshee34 Two cases. First one, at SCOTUS, was on Obama's mandate. This one is on Trump's protections. Story explains.
@Jadmai @WillWtroyer No, we oppose mothers dying. And babies. :)
@Jadmai @WillWtroyer That is literally in the story you responded to and in others we've written on the topic. We've been reporting accurately for 26 years. :)
@TheOtherParas @GRRNow @LifeSite We already do.  :)		Sorry you can't take responsibility for not even getting a basic fact correct. But then facts aren't your strong suit.
@ShirleyCatron It will probably be back there.
@TheOtherParas @GRRNow LOL. Find a mirror.
@TheOtherParas @GRRNow @LifeSite And when an unhinged abortion activist can't even figure out the right Twitter username lol
@TheOtherParas @GRRNow So much hate. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@Jadmai @WillWtroyer So we're fake news and liars but you can't even prove a single thing false in our story. Figures.

@idahoguy @CaffThoughts Again, we get it you hate Trump. If you don't like LifeNews, don't read it. Whoever you are you don't follow us anyway.		Have a good day. Muting conversation. Not interested in a circular conversation with the same criticism over and over again.
@idahoguy @CaffThoughts No, they give out an award named for her!
@idahoguy @CaffThoughts An attempt by abortion activists to impeach a pro-life president is pro-life news.		We get it, you hate Trump. Move on.
@idahoguy @CaffThoughts And if you're shocked that a pro-life organization would support a pro-life president then I don't know what to tell you. Seems pretty obvious.
Pro-abortion Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has announced she will be running for President. #maga2020 #kag2020
@queenbellaIam No too bad she's not pro-life.
@idahoguy @CaffThoughts a. We cover only pro-life news.		b. If you don't understand that retweets and hashtags don't equal endorsements then you should rethink your participation on Twitter. We use a very wide variety of hashtags to attract readers and discussion.

@idahoguy @CaffThoughts Obviously we don't support any racist statements, we merely support his pro-life policies. Don't falsely conflate the two.
@idahoguy @CaffThoughts And we're wrapping nothing in any banner. Supporting a president because of his pro-life policies does not equate to supporting every other comment or policy position he takes.
@idahoguy @CaffThoughts False. We have praised Trump for the defunding steps he has taken. https://t.co/6G8yte7zby
@idahoguy @CaffThoughts Nothing was misleading, on your portrayal of the article. The SAP clearly mentioned abortion and PP funding in two full paragraphs. https://t.co/z6jXITHLu8

@RdubHall God bless Rick. Let's work together to get this done!
@JulioZ32 @_MariaBetty The article says who :)
@RdubHall We didn't have a pro-life Senate because of the pro-abortion Republicans, until November. Now we do.
@RdubHall No the word is but. We would have pass the bill BUT those pro-aborts voted pro-abortion.
@RdubHall Then you just made it easier for Democrats to fund abortions and PP when they take over.		And we didn't have 50 votes to defund anyway. As we reported... https://t.co/erPfYkMaKQ
@RdubHall @1classysinger The part where you acknowledge WHY PP wasn't defunded. 		See https://t.co/erPfYkMaKQ
@RdubHall It's not pathetic, it's what happened. Virtually every Republican voted to defund PP btu we didn't have 60 votes because....		wait for it....		here it comes....		a Democrat filibuster. 	https://t.co/A79OwtyP8B		#Facts101
@Sierra0505 @RdubHall They make promises because they actually want to defund PP. And they trie. We simply didn't have the votes.
@RdubHall Voting to defund PP is not pro-life? That's odd.
@RdubHall We lost the House, that's not the fault of pro-lifers trying to defund PP. Sorry defunding the biggest abortion business is just posturing to you. Its important to the rest of us.
@RdubHall House voted 5 times to defund PP, we lost in the Senate for lack of votes. Not "nothing."

@idahoguy @CaffThoughts He made an entire movie trashing a pro-life VP.

@BasicKoell @EagleStarNET Proof please.
@BasicKoell @EagleStarNET That must be it. https://t.co/6G8yte7zby
@EagleStarNET "One one has to wade through a lot Team Trump cheerleading that has little to do with the pro-life cause."		Example #1: LifeNews condemned Democrats for funding abortions and applauded Trump for defunding International Planned Parenthood. 		Defunding PP now not pro-life?
@EagleStarNET Must be no more babies left to save from abortion if you have time to trash pro-lifers. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@EagleStarNET Short take: LifeNews is less pro-life because it supports pro-life President Donald Trump for being pro-life.
