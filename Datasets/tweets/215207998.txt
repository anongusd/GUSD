@Lurkyton @_R_S_S_ Trump  could:	1. Seek engineering bids.	2. Select plan.	3. Bring in prototypers whose models don't fail.	4. Land clearances.	5. Determine wall efficacy vs. other action.		But that won't give Fox  erections, so jump to a wall that can't be built without any of this done already.

I live in Texas. No one in a border city is being evacuated. They are going out to the eat, heading to the movies, driving around. 		How can Trump not be sending the military to evacuate these poor people from his emergency?! (That’s certainly a question a court will ask).
Trump world: “There’s an emergency! We have to get this person to the hospital in the next decade!”		He’s going to be humiliated arguing that  a “wall” with no contracts, no engineering, no building schedule, and no emergency constitutes something worth throwing out Constitution.
...for, I don't know, maybe there being evidence to suggest he could be a foreign agent, or compromised by the Russians, or mentally ill?
The question that Trump and the Trumpettes never address when they scream  FBI and CIA conspiracy theories.		Why would such a "political conspiracy" take place?		...and if it did, wouldn't it suggest  law enforcement and intel had reason to believe Trump was a threat to America?
A bunch of Trumpers, aping their  leader, are proclaiming the wall already being built. NOT the part passed into law more than a decade ago. The "Trump" wall.		Don't argue with them. You're right, Cult45! He's amazing! Thank goodness that wall's all paid for now and being built.

@SirPantsington @MarvelStudios @SonyPictures Google “tongue swallowing.” Every reference is to seizures and major head injuries. We’ve tried educating by saying “put nothing in mouth” and get response “but how do you stop them from swallowing tongue?” So message is tongue swallowing is a myth. Which marvel is perpetuating.
@DarkoWhite_ @MarvelStudios @SonyPictures In the event you are not a troll, THIS IS NOT TRUE. Put NOTHING in a mouth during a seizure.

For @MarvelStudios and @SonyPictures:		During seizure, someone jammed pencil in my mouth to stop  mythical "tongue swallowing." Clenching jaw bit through. Folks watched in terror to see if Id inhale jagged wood &amp; die.		Take  "swallow tongue" line out of  upcoming Spiderman movie.
@patrickfcox_cox @MarvelStudios @SonyPictures Yup. But prying someone's mouth open or putting a spoon in there does nothing but shatter teeth. If something SUPER soft, like a wallet, is not used BEFORE the seizure starts, biting is pretty much inevitable.
@Unitedshashe @MrWallingford @TomHolland1996 @SamuelLJackson Unfortunately, this gets too complicated to explain, so we suck it up and bite tongues/lips. Full: Something SOFT (like a wallet) should be placed in mouth if a seizure is COMING to limit biting. Falsehood is you use spoon AFTER seizure starts to stop imaginary tongue swallowing.
@Sanchordia @TomHolland1996 @SamuelLJackson Tried that. They don't give a damn. So hoping actors will invoke their "you better damn care...I'm not putting my face behind something that could result in protests" power behind it.
@JoshMills @MarvelStudios @SonyPictures ...at essence, you are giving people too much credit. If the line was "dont let him drool on you, you could get an STD" do you think the entire HIV/AIDS community would be in an uproar, even though it never says AIDS? Of course - because THAT is where the myth strikes.
@JoshMills @MarvelStudios @SonyPictures The sole applications of "tongue swallowing" myth is in epilepsy and  head injuries. We say "dont put things in people's mouths" and  response is "but what about the tongue swallowing?" So we say "tongue swallowing isn't real!" That gets  response. Now, Marvel says it's real.
@TomHolland1996 @SamuelLJackson 3...as if it is real. It is not. This  line could easily result in people's teeth being shattered by the well meaning trying to stopnon-existent tongue swallowing. Neither @SonyPictures nor @MarvelStudios gives a damn. Make them take the line out before film is released.

@warren__terra @GayleKing So, please contact all publishers of American history textbooks to tell them when they use the historically correct term for the legal status of Africans brought to VA in 1619 they must run the “tone” of the correct usage by you.
RT @kurteichenwald: @Clodagh831 @GayleKing Only in modern america can people be chastised for being correct.
@warren__terra @GayleKing No, it is a historical fact. There is a difference between an indentured servant and a slave. That 50 year transformation for black Africans from IS to slavery is the ultimate proof of the racism that drove slavery, because few other indentured servants were made slaves.
@Clodagh831 @GayleKing Only in modern america can people be chastised for being correct.
Folks, learn your damn history. Northam is correct. First black Africans brought to Virginia in 1619 were indentured servants. @GayleKing is wrong. There were no laws for slavery in VA til 1661. The evolution from IS to slavery is essential to understand depth of evil of slavery.

Here's a wild and wacky idea. In the future, how about we elect people for president who have had, oh - I don't know - experience in government?		No more vanity billionaires who learn on the job. We aren't selecting king and queen of the prom.

One of most interesting things:		When Trump was a Democrat, the Democrats knew he was a fraud. 		When he then moved to the Reform Party, Reform Party members knew he was a fraud. 		When he moved to the GOP, Republicans thought he was a God.
When Donald trump was a child, he punched a music teacher in the face because the teacher wouldn’t do what Trump wanted. (True story)		GOP logic: the music teacher was responsible and little Donny should be praised.
The bottom line for modern republicans and this “we aren’t responsible for shutting government for not getting what we want” shows this is the infantile party that takes responsibility for none of its behavior.
Its amazing so many GOPrs have become so deluded they say a person who says “if you don’t give me what I want I’ll hurt people” isnt responsible for hurting people if he doesn’t get what he wants. 		Unless a dem did it. But they don’t. Not enough sociopaths in Dem party for that

Id bet $1,000  the reason Trump caved is:		Rich people needing to travel to and from Wall Street could no longer use LaGuardia Airport. That is the only "pain" people like Trump and Ross  understand" "When bad things happen to rich people."		The struggling? "They're on vacation!"
@the_in2 @FoxNews They started this weeks before she had pneumonia - and them proclaimed it wasn't pneumonia, but all the nonsense theyd been saying.		Which makes you wonder: Did Assange find out she had pneumonia, so they were started pumping  evil interpretations for when she showed symptoms.
While @FoxNews refuses to acknowledge that its pre-election "Hillary is dying" propaganda was orchestrated between Corsi and Stone in conjunction with Assange, here is the take that they DO say is the meaning of the Stone indictment.		Keep paddling, gang. You're going under. https://t.co/zvCIJY2Pzy
@FoxNews 15...was as it  happen. The media has a lot of responsibility here. And @FoxNews, Hannity, Tucker, Breitbart and all the rest have to answer NOW - why were you parroting a line of argument pitched by cons conspirators in Russian disinformation campaign? #ItIsTreason		Done
@FoxNews 14...goddamn RUSSIANS were driving one of the most insane storylines coming out of conservative media, and TONS of you ran with "raising questions" stories. ALL of you were suckered into this. And it wasn't hard to see what was going on. I was pointing out how insane it all...
@FoxNews 13...THAT why you engage in irrational, vast-conspiracy attacks? Is THAT why you were working with Cohen until he flipped? You have a LOT to answer for.		As for the rest of the media. For GOD'S sake, see the links. Assange to Individual 1 to Stone to Conservative media. The...
@FoxNews 12...almost IMMEDIATELY after that email, Hannity jumps into the water, proclaiming that Hillary is not well. Then the pile on begins quickly. Tucker, Breitbart etc all join on quickly.		Maybe it's time for @foxnews to fess up: Are your commentators witnesses to this crime? Is...
@FoxNews 11..two more document dumps. In that same email, Person 1 says what the hackers are planning, and then adds the key phrase "Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke – neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus..." https://t.co/s9wa9nwJFB
@FoxNews 10..I know anything as to who it is, I only know of two prominent Trump supporters in London who would be in contact with online political commentator in US - and both of them are jaw dropping if they are involved.) After that, Person 1 reports that Assange is going to do....
@FoxNews 9...Person 1 was in contact with Stone regarding Wikileaks releases. Stone sent an email to Person 1 asking him to get someone to Assange in Ecuadorian Embassy in London to pick up emails. Person 1 then sent that message to a Trump supporter from London. (While I am not saying...
@FoxNews 8...here is the relevant info. Stone was publicly claiming to be in contact with Assange by early August 2016. Lots of emails/text message were swapped around about this. (What idiots these guys are.) A guy deemed Person 1 was a political commentator with an online publication...
@FoxNews 7...to how insane they would get in trying to proclaim Hillary on death's door.		Until today. Now I get it. It was part of the Stone/Wikileaks conspiracy described in the indictment. Watch your emails, Hannity and Tucker. You might want to see if you are implicated....
@FoxNews 6...of nothing. When she had her issue with Pneumonia, and had a doctors record release to prove it, Tucker said on the air, "Well, I don't believe it. I think it's something else." This was reckless but it always amazed me that they were all on message, all together, no limits..
@FoxNews 5...flabbergasted that someone claiming to be a doctor would say these things that were demonstrably false. But Hannity and all the rest of the conservative liars went with it. It was soon after it expanded to Parkinson's and later Multiple Sclerosis. Again all on the basis...
@FoxNews 4...were public, and showed nothing. Hannity actually found some hack doctor to come on the air and diagnose Hillary with epilepsy on the basis that she had a goofy head movement once that was obviously her being humorous. Real neurologists - I know a lot of them - were....
@FoxNews 3...came down with pneumonia. She was accused - on  basis of nothing - of being infirm, weak, old, with Parkinsons, with epilepsy, etc etc. It always struck me as the ultimate proof that the conservative media bubble conspires in agreed-upon frauds, since her medical records...
@FoxNews 2...allegations. This, however, comes directly from an email, so I think it can be deemed fact. One of the most bizarre things in the entire election was the relentless build-up on Fox and other organizations about Hillary being infirm and sick. This started long BEFORE she....
1. There is a jaw-dropping line in Stone indictment folks are missing. It implicates  entire conservative media bubble - including Hannity, Tucker, Breitbart, and  rest of @FoxNews - as participants/dupes  in a fraud directed by people in Stone-Individual 1-Wikileaks conspiracy..

@CNN @MSNBC ...and the reason I didn't suggest @FoxNews ask aggressive questions about the feasibility and usefulness of a wall is....are you kidding? This is Fox we're talking about. 		"Fox...helping the GOP keep you in the dark for two decades."
Every anchor on @CNN and @MSNBC must start asking every Trump wall-nut the basic questions that have been ignored: "Why a wall? What experts, by name, have you used to determine that is the best form of border security? Why does  Heritage Found disagree? https://t.co/9LxjT65oWS
@Heritage 35...and for the idiots....		No, the wall not going to cost $5.7 bill. That is the number Trump pulled out of his butt as the amount they "need" to build the first segment, even though there are no contracts, no bids, no engineering. It is a fiction. TOTAL cost a min of $49 bill.
@OrdyPackard @gac_well @Heritage ....which is, based on prototypes that have not had the necessary engineering specs done, 3 times as much. So I am assuming Trump - if he ever got this cockamamie wall - would go with concrete rather than his idiotic steel idea.
@OrdyPackard @gac_well @Heritage Thats the initial payment for a short amount of wall. On top of the $1.6 given two years ago. If you CARE about this, Ord, why don't you know that? The lowball estimate for a concrete one is $25 bill. The non-political estimate is $49 bill. Now, Trump is saying "steel slats"....
RT @CommittoVote: @kurteichenwald @Heritage And Cato is no left wing think tank either. https://t.co/xfDtyufloT
@Heritage 34...the bottom line: The only way this insane shutdown is about border security is because the democrats are trying to stop the GOP from blowing $50 billion on a boondoggle that is the least effective means of security - leaving us unable to afford  others.		Done.

@Heritage 24...now, let's return to Heritage, and what it says should be done. We just finished item 4. They have not mentioned a wall yet.		5. Reform congressional oversight of DHS	6. Encourage private-sector investment in border infrastructure. (This does not mean wall.)...
@Heritage 23...so make absolutely no mistake. We know what is supposed to be done. A wall is not it. But that is simple to understand, even though - like saying "close the borders to keep people with Ebola out - the experts say it worsens what you are trying to fix.....
@Heritage 22..yup. You heard that right. The GOP obsession with a simplistic solution that can be voiced on Fox News has  DAMAGED border security. Fox viewers don't have the time to say "Fully finance SBInet &amp; launch proper technology...(trails off)" when they can say "BUILD THAT WALL!"...
@Heritage 21...So why is the BEST option recommended by the experts always struggling to get financed? Come on...you can guess. Just think about it. The GOP  controlled Congress for awhile....		THEY KEEP TAKING MONEY FROM SBInet - WHICH WORKS! - TO FINANCE A WALL THAT DOESNT!!....

@Heritage 18...Border patrol agents. It deploys a combination of both infrastructure and technology, such as cameras, radars, sensors, and towers, along 387 miles of border, with the goal of creating a "virtual fence" to help border agents detect people as they try to cross the border....
@Heritage 17....		4. Ensuring that SBInet is fully funded. Now, this one requires a moment break. Probably zero members of Cult45 - and probably not Trump, Coulter or Rush - even know what SBInet is. SBInet is designed to bring new technologies and capabilities to support the work of...

@Heritage 12...be a tiny part of the border security, if it is used at all. This entails getting FORMAL, OFFICIAL notifications from US Customs &amp; Border Protection, based on ANALYSES with EXPERTS as to how much wall is needed, and if it is worth the cost compared to other alternatives....

@Heritage 5...remind them: This ONLY became the "solution" when empty-headed fist pumpers, led by a man who knows nothing, decided a wall was the best answer. THIS is why Trump has refused to do the basic engineering, and the GOP has refused to hold hearings on best options for border....
@Heritage 4...look at what they say. And the answer is pretty clear: Everything that the Trump Administration has done runs counter to what the conservative Heritage Foundation experts on border security recommended. Everything.		So when they equate "a wall" with border security...

@M_Ben_Yehuda It is not a crime for Trump to lie. If it was, he would be serving a life sentence.

12...now there is one thing that is possible as a problem in this scenario for Trump: If he knew after the fact what Cohen said and made no attempt to correct the record. His oath is to faithfully uphold the laws. If he doesnt - by staying silent - that is violation of oath.

@chris_appleget @nytimes He didn’t.
@FemaleFoto @nytimes As an investigative reporter for decades, I will tell you: the better the sourcing, the more they demand extreme anonymity.

@mr_mookie There is zero chance that any wall will be built by 2020. They haven't done the engineering, they haven't done the contracting, they haven't issued bids. It will take years before they even start, if it was fully funded today.
@Raine86666 Wait...if you were there and witnessed events that have allowed you to conclude Trump has done nothing, please contact the Office of Special Counsel and turn over the evidence.		If you are just saying this because you like Trump...hush. No one cares what you "think" is true.
@Libertarian247 Unlike you, I don't care which side "wins." I would rather not have a president who suborns perjury, so no, I didnt want it to be true so badly. And I have been cautioning all day that there was reason to suspect it might not be.
@zaherring I agree. But if it happens - &amp; if courts so compromised they allow it to happen - then the same power is in hands of democratic presidents. I would prefer we abide by the constitution, but since GOP trumpists want to play the short-game, we have to realize the long might change.
Ok, Trump is setting it up. If courts back up his ability to declare a national emergency to fund something that won't make a damn bit of difference for a decade, the the next Dem president can declare national emergencies on climate change, guns, and health insurance.
@TrappdInTheEcho ...and that's his job - to say nothing except in court.
Great. Looks like Trump is going to declare a national emergency to get financing for a wall that he has not done the engineering or land clearances on - despite having the money - and that won't be built for a decade.		In other emergencies: There will be an earthquake in 2029.
@Arsenalhound @ViajaMasTerca @Jeff68Anderson I'm saying folks nitpicking between inaccurate and untrue have not seen enough statements by prosecutors over the years denying news reports. "Inaccurate" is the go-to. Also Mueller almost never puts out statements, and certainly wouldn't if this was a nit pick.
@Arsenalhound Lawyers and professional spokespeople say "inaccurate" because "untrue" and "false" can blow up in your face. All someone has to do is marshal a series of facts that ARE correct and say "how can they say it is untrue when this is true?" Same doesnt work for "inaccurate."
@laf13laf Prosecutors do not dispute stories for having inaccuracies. Most stories have inaccuracies.  Mueller has almost never said anything, except when he told everyone to beware of "inaccurate" reports and this one. He uses inaccurate, like any good prosecutor, to mean incorrect.
I know I angered some people by having been throwing some shade on the suborning perjury story, and now for highlighting Mueller's statements. That is the way journalism works: I dont care about what the accurate portrayal of facts show, I just care if it's accurate.
....If another outlet reports something, don’t run with it unless you have your own sourcing to back it up.”		And note: That time he used the phrase "inaccurate." Criminal prosecutors don't tend to say "untrue" in statements.
Why to exercise caution on stories about Mueller: He said to in April. “Many stories about our investigation have been inaccurate. Be very cautious about any source that claims to have knowledge about our investigation and dig deep into what they claim before reporting on it...

If Cohen denies it, there is no story here. And we haven't heard from him yet. So I want to be clear I am not confirming the story.
I want to be very, very clear. IF @MichaelCohen212 says Trump instructed him to lie to Congress, I believe it because it fits Trump's pattern of behavior of perjuring himself to Congress.		However, I am not confirming the Buzzfeed article that Cohen is saying this. I do not know.

@Jericho3K @MarvelStudios @SamuelLJackson @TomHolland1996 Then @MarvelStudios will need to have protests from the epilepsy community. They already have strike one because "Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse" contained strobes that could cause seizures, meaning folks with epilepsy couldn't see it. Both easy fixes. https://t.co/3RzmyCFsY4

@SunGirlLeo @MarvelStudios @SamuelLJackson @TomHolland1996 Im so sorry this happened to you. It is horrible that this tongue swallowing myth causes so much damage. Im doing everything in my power to fight it - unfortunately, this action by @MarvelStudios could undermine years of effort to get the message out tongue swallowing isn't real.
@ConcernedFruit @SinisterOneSD @MarvelStudios @SamuelLJackson @TomHolland1996 Jesus. Why do people have opinions on things they have no knowledge about? Just search "tongue swallowing." See how many hits are to having seizures. We have found ONLY way to combat putting spoons in peoples mouths - and breaking teeth - is to stress tongue swallowing isn't real
For those saying "Oh pish-posh, how important is it that @MarvelStudios is perpetuating the myth of tongue swallowing in #SpiderManFarFromHome? It doesnt SAY epilepsy."

@Jericho3K @MarvelStudios @SamuelLJackson @TomHolland1996 The campaign we have been engaged in is to get the message out TONGUE SWALLOWING ISNT REAL.

@SinisterOneSD @MarvelStudios @SamuelLJackson @TomHolland1996 How are so many people so fucking stupid? Weve been fighting for years to get ppl to understand that tongue swallowing isn't real because folks with epilepsy get their teeth broken by the well intended trying to stop the "swallow. A major film saying it is real undermines that.
@JeffreyFlood @MarvelStudios @SamuelLJackson @TomHolland1996 Gee, you're right. I should say nothing. The fact that we have been working years to say there is no such thing as tongue swallowing in order to keep little kids and adults from having their teeth broken shouldn't get in the way of marvel having a joke in their movie.
@g8rmwr @WFSecurityNerd @MarvelStudios @SamuelLJackson @TomHolland1996 Search "tongue swallowing." It is ONLY (falsely) connected to seizures -from head injuries &amp; epilepsy. The point we have been trying to teach an exceedingly ignorant public is that there is NO SUCH THING. We get our teeth broken for this. Marvel doesnt have to perpetuate the lie.

Congress gave Trump billions last year for a wall/border security. He didn't spend it.		Dems have offered billions this year for border security, but not for a wall given no engineering, no land clearances, no plans.		Trump refuses.		Trump is impeding border security.

But, you know, customs. Like giving a hearing to a Supreme Court nominee. So dont ooze about customs. The GOP has thrown them all out once they did Garland.

@BushwickBob Not permanently. If GOP is going to dine out on shutdown, the only way they will stop is if their contributors and other "not effecting me so I don't care" types get ground down. Shut the airports, let it all close. A day later, it will reopen and they won't do this again.
The time has come to allow the GOP finally crash the federal government. If you have a job available, check into hiring a federal worker.		Extortion as means of legislation  has become the GOP go-to. The US will crash one point or another from this tactic. May as well be now.
@HighestGoodHHC @AFGENational Not sure what the law is for feds, but you're not striking if you are not getting paid.
I hope @AFGENational will call for a mass walkout by government employees. Shut it down. Stop protecting GOP from consequences of their blackmail. Close airports, everything.		Youre not getting paid. Fed gov not following rules of employment. Slavery is illegal.		Shut it down.

People keep asking why I didn’t reveal before the election all the things I have been tweeting this weekend about Trump. 		I did. It was all in Newsweek. My editors encouraged me to pursue everything I found. People were just more caught up in Trumps visit to Dr Oz and her emails
@Phins4Ev @Caddyshark @DameWritesalot ...you cannot underestimate one major fact: A lot of democrats spent so much time attacking hillary because she wasn't bernie, that many of these stories about trump went unnoticed.
@Caddyshark ...this is why people have to stop saying "I didnt read it, so you must not have said." Here is the beginning of these stories, told in 6/2016. However, it may have been buried on the dems side because Bernie-its were attacking me relentlessly for a piece I wrote the week before. https://t.co/3EhNgGuvZL

@BardLackey @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity Seriously, how stupid are you guys? Brennnan wasn’t in the CIA in 2001.

Remember, Trump began attacking CIA NOT because he was being investigated for possible collusion. He did it because the intel concluded that  Russia was interfering. 		Then fellow travelers of Fox - like @TuckerCarlson and @seanhannity - started attacking our intel agencies too.

@marcuswelby360 @FoxNews I’m saying if they do it, they have done it. Once the crystal is broken, it can’t be put back together well, so the new crystal must be accepted. And in this crystal, we have a almost unitary government. So GOP can live with what they created.

@izvansky That is changing. Metrics garland and then the “anything goes” trump admin with gop slavishly lying and dissembling. Time for dems to wake up and recognize that there are no rules with the GOP. And it’s happening.
@ErnestScribbler Yup.  Can’t wait to see @Hannity defend the seizure of private property.
@PepinLachance @FoxNews I agree. I just hope the @gop figures out that this isn’t simply one of their “let’s do something stupid so we have good coverage on fox tonight” events. They need to see the slippery slope, just like the one they created on different topic with Merrill garland.

Take a listen to my interview about A MIND UNRAVELED, my new book about living with intractable #epilepsy, on @AllOfItWNYC with @alisonstewart. Thanks Alison for s great interview. https://t.co/PdmbgCmnSu
Next democratic president could simply say: 	Through issuance of relentless propaganda undermining democracy, @foxnews poses a threat to the national security and must be seized. 		Oh, there will be so much that could be done if trump takes this insane, anti constitutional path.
@MishaFromwiller I do too. But if the GOP is dead set on wrecking centuries of constitution al government to appeaS Fox News, then have to adapt to the result and crush them with it.
amazing GOPrs clamoring for a “national emergency” to build a wall when they haven’t done basic engineering work and land assessments required - and that they already had the money to do. 		Idiots wrecking constitution. Oh, they will hate what is done by Dems with that precedent.
@ClaudiaLamb The constitution has a strong failsafe against that. And military is sworn to uphold constitution. I don’t fear that. Although looney tunes might try.
I’m really of the mindset: anti-constitution republicans slobber at the prospect of declaring a national emergency? Do it. Please. 		Because then, next dem will overrule your anti-science, anti-expertise know-nothingness for real change. Live by lawlessness, die by lawlessness
@MaggioMatt Yah well. We know that the republicans are willing to break the law for their tantrums. Too bad. They want to abandon the constitution, they live with the consequences.
....this is the benefit of having one party that bases all of its decisions on what will play well on @foxnews that night. They don’t think long term. And long term - a national emergency for stupid wall could set the precedent to attack climate and guns.
I think it’s worth it for Trump to shoot GOP in foot to set precedent to declare national emergency for decade long project.		Next dem president: cancel wall, adopt cheaper and more effective border controls, then invoke national emergencies to deal with climate change and guns.
Ok, let’s abandon constitution with a declaration of national emergency because trump can’t get more money for a boondoggle. 		Here is the Pentagon report on the national security threat from climate change. Next dem president: if trump declares, do same. https://t.co/BZon2p4rkf

The wall debate is another example of the refusal of GOP to accept that experts know more than some uninformed guy.		Experts say a wall is least effective, most expensive option. But it makes GOP excited so to hell with experts. 		Just like climate change, biology, history, etc.
...bottom line: this is about Dems fighting to stop trump from wasting billions on a stupid idea advocated by people who know nothing about border security simply so he can get cheers from the uninformed.
Democrats just said it: theyre willing to pay for border security using the high tech options recommended by security experts. But they are not willing to honor a dumb campaign slogan to flush billions away on a wall that experts say is most expensive, least effective approach.

@Dennis90510086 @AP_Politics Funny...I remember dems running against the wall and winning the house. 		And just because people who get info from non-experts think $25 bill should be spent on something security experts said is the least effective way to achieve goal doesnt mean we must waste the money.
I think it speaks volumes about the values, morals and irrationality of many conservatives that they can look at someone saying "Give me what I want or I'll shoot this other guy in the head" and cant see the terrorist - not the guy who refuses to negotiate with him - is to blame.
@themotleyfool No.
@DHMrs Find once a democrat said "Unless you do what we want, we will shut down government."  But dems dont do that. The GOP does. Which is why they are responsible.		And no one argues against fixing immigration. It's the wall that is a boondoggle that security experts say is nonsense.

@babbdbd Offer up your proof - not sherlock holmes "if you see this, then this then this" or arguments - I will agree with you. If dont have it, I will wait to make a conclusion until the information is out.
How to stop shutdown instantly:		House passes rule that, cause of limits in fed banking/securities oversight, trust fund distributions be put on hold until shutdown ends.		The flood of big donors demanding to start flow of cash to their kids again will overwhelm GOP phone lines.
This is what Trump is doing to our federal workers. They are left begging so they don't lose their homes.		This is what happens when we have government by narcissistic sociopath. https://t.co/ZIBjETvShx
...people misunderstand. I am not saying Trump DID NOT know. I am saying that is his only remaining real defense.		Did he know? I don't know - I wait until I have the solid information before I reach conclusions. But it looks bad.
Remember - Trump celebrated Manafort as a poor, abused person. Manafort, who fed intel to Russia. Trump's campaign - and kid - met with a Russian agent charged with role obstructing Russian money laundering.		Trump has ONE out on collusion: He didn't know. But everyone else did.
One redacted sentences from one filing in one of many Mueller cases is publicly revealed. And we learn that Trump's campaign chairman fed internal data to a Russian national with alleged ties to Russian intelligence/the Kremlin.		There are witches being found in this hunt.
It is amazing @GOP is only now beginning to understand that Trump has no endgame in his shutdown nonsense.		He has, and always will, tell you who he is: He says his "gut" is smarter than other people's brains, and that he doesnt need to study to be smarter. He acts w/o thinking.

It's amazing that we are all sitting here wondering if the president is going to declare a national emergency and seize control of congressional functions over a lie.		How the hell did we get here? For GOD'S sake, vote next time.

@Palmetto_Joe So joe I’ve enjoyed exposing you as a pedo supporter, but I’m done for the night, tell all your fellow pedos - too bad I got your friends locked up but your propaganda ain’t gonna save you. Youre all going to jail.
@Palmetto_Joe Why do you keep repeating arguments of pedophiles and showing excerpts from one of the key guys who repeats the pedophiles argument? Why not read the sworn testimony before Congress I linked?		Oh, sorry. That would require reading. Like showering ,not one of your great skills.
@Palmetto_Joe ...and yup... you are quoting one of the folks whose writing mouths the propaganda of pedophiles. What a shock.
@Palmetto_Joe Because you don’t shower. And I googled “how to take a shower” to make wonderful, feed-shared fun of you. You know, for being a neckbeard loser. And this was the video that turned up.		Watch it.  A shower might help you.
@Palmetto_Joe Take a shower, you pedo scum. And find a job that isn’t embarrassing. Stop being such a loser.
@Palmetto_Joe I see you can’t read and still repeat the pedophile lines. 		Get over it Joe. I took away the kids you and your ilk abuse. I got them into good lives. Some are parents now. 		And you and your pedo friends who can’t get over my battle against pedos will always be scum.
@Palmetto_Joe ..but even though you are a pedophile gamer with an embarrassing job and no personal hygiene, I'm willing to help you. Watch this video, it might allow you to at least take a step toward rejoining civilized society. https://t.co/DjWehOqXMt
@Palmetto_Joe I LOVE that I said "stop vid games, shower, get a girlfriend, get a job that isn't embarrassing" and you reply "I've got a girlfriend."		HAHAHAHA!!! So, embarrassing job of an unshowered gamer. Who claims he has a "girlfriend." Yeah, right.		Does she know you repeat pedophiles?
@Palmetto_Joe Wow, Joe...how many internet lies you repeat?		And wow...you have a girlfriend. Im so impressed. 		So...why you lying? And btw - neckbeard? Incel? Toxic gamer? All three? Which is it for you?
@Palmetto_Joe ...by the way, I like how you slammed NPR while being fine with the pedophiles and their supporters whose words you repeat.		You're disgusting. Get away from kids. I spent a lot of effort rescuing em from scumbags like you. I'm good at taking your kind down. Happy to do it again.
@Palmetto_Joe Joe...stop playing video games. Shower. Get a girlfriend. Get a job that isn't embarrassing. You are not a "demon of the internet." Just a stain on society.		Real people who do real things - like rescue kids - will never cower to your BS. Because you're nothing but a loser.
@Palmetto_Joe Wow. At BEST you made a stupid argument not knowing facts. Youre shown info that shows, in fact, I rescued dozens of kids and saved this kids life. You can read GOPrs celebrating me. 		Youre told your words are straight out of mouths of pedos. And you repeat them. How revealing.
@Palmetto_Joe ...and PS - yes, you can find lots of articles. Almost all of them written by pedophile supporters, pedophiles themselves, or people who didnt do any reporting. Then find the ones where people did reporting and didnt desperately want to molest kids like the folks you read. (SAD!)
@Palmetto_Joe Again, read hearings; https://t.co/WG17ruvIed		And read what kid you are referring to had to say when testifying. (attached)		I know people like you live in basements, drains on society, accomplishing nothing, finding your value in attacking people who have done good things. Sad. https://t.co/XKBJk97qRc
@Palmetto_Joe ...so Joe, I guess you're still mad I rescued one of the kids you and your pals wanted to abuse.		What other reason could you have for attacking the person who saved the kid and many more like him? Why dont you point out the GOP argument, rather than repeat the pedos? I know why.
@Palmetto_Joe Yup. You are. Or at least  repeating their arguments. it is strange that you feel compelled to attack someone who rescued children. Here, kiddie-diddler, read the hearings where I was cheered by GOP:	https://t.co/WG17ruvIed		And from that hearing, the kid I saved you discussed: https://t.co/mkhxZuzorD
@Palmetto_Joe ...in fact, I think my followers have a right to know: how DID you end up repeating the lines barfed up by child pornographers I got locked up? How did you come across them? Cause I don’t want molesters on my feed and if that’s you - go to hell you kiddy abuser.
@Palmetto_Joe I saved the life of dozens of kids who were caught up in child porn. I was celebrated by republicans in Congress for it.  Bunch of pedophiles went to jail. You are repeating their argument. 		So...I assume you are a pedophile or at least friends with some.
If trump declares national emergency, I can’t wait to see hannity and tucker start justifying the government seizure of private property on the border that will be required. 		Cause GOP and Fox stand for nothing. Every principal can be sacrificed. Except tax cuts for the rich.
@maddpig @GOP The house impeaches. They are dem led. The senate convicts. If house impeaches, goes to trial in senate.
If trump declares a fictional national emergency to subvert the constitional requirements on appropriations, he must be impeached for violating his oath of office. 		Presidents don’t get to fund their pet projects all on their own by invoking fantasy.
It is amazing Trump is considering declaring a national emergency as a political stunt, to deal with a bogus "crisis" at the border which was a political stunt, which was fueled by election promises that were a political stunt.		There was a time when government was for governing.
A national emergency....		* To require the building of a wall that will take more than a decade to finish	* That Congress has had power to approve until now, but didn't consider.	* That Trump had power to seek, but didn't.		If he is allowed to do this, there are no rules.
@Reality0982 @NotreDame It's not. But fighting back will require him to disclose publicly that he has uncontrolled epilepsy. And reality is, those with CONTROLLED epilepsy have 3x the national umployment rate: We arent hired. 		As his mom said to me, "He needs to work someday." So they stay quiet.
@41030RRWms @TheRickWilson He never would have made it 4 a week. Democrats have never nominated lunatics. The "it doesnt take any intelligence to be president" disease infused the GOP in 2008 with Palin. 		There is a reason Trump left the democratic party: No one in it would give him power. So he went GOP.

The 4,000 people cited by Trump - but not stopped at border - are just on terror list.		So now, GOP says people on the terror list are terrorists. Ok.		So why has the GOP fought tooth and nail for people on the terror list to be allowed to buy guns unimpeded?		#FlexiblePropaganda
Trump claimed "some former presidents" told him he was right about wall. Of course, they said it in secret, like all the magical people Trump cites who agree with him.		Carter says not him.	George W says not him.	Clinton says not him.	Obama criticized the wall.		Lies endlessly.
This is classic:		@realDonaldTrump, @PressSec Sanders, @VP: "4,000 terrorists have been stopped at the border!"		@DHSgov Homeland Security contacted to confirm, replies: "The number stopped is classified."		So...the REAL number cant be disclosed. And Trump keeps lying.
...and what it is really all about.		There is no sudden "crisis" at the border. That is why the Trumpers keep lying about terrorists.		There is a crisis for Trump's ego: He started a fight to get cheers from Fox, Limbaugh and Coulter, with no idea how to get out. Ego is all. https://t.co/yOkD9WoSsz

@arthurwerry Rather than using slogans that appeal to the uninformed, we should do what the security experts recommend and use a combination of significant technology use and specific law enforcement undertakings that work. A wall appeals to the unread cause it seems logical. It does nothing.
If there is a "national emergency" at the border, the LAST thing we need is a border wall that will take decades to build and cost 25 billion minimum (not including annual upkeep.) 		This is like saying "Emergency! The school is on fire! Let's build a firehouse!"

If you believe that any criticism of something a female politician does is, in and of itself, sexist, please unfollow me. I criticize male politicians, I criticize female politicians. I will not create different standards of analysis based on gender.
@LoriDTindall @KimRippere @RashidaTlaib Could you explain how applying same critique to men and women for 15 years is "mansplaining"?		And yes, it is pressing. Pelosi understands the long-game. Making impeachment seem purely partisan while cursing is short-game, and has given a weapon to the GOP they are already using.
@photos2C @fresafresca3000 @RashidaTlaib No, they aren't. You can't get into the camps. But the massive protest where people who were undocumented showed up, who had family in the camps, was in Austin.		Join in next time. (My favorite sign from there below.) https://t.co/tGJ0FeH1WM
@Bookwormroom What the hell are you talking about?		Perhaps you should actually read the stuff I write rather than make yourself out to be a fool. Read a few of my business books. Or the book on investing I co-wrote. Or listen to my speeches at business schools. Or at corporations.
Shutdowns are never appropriate. If politicians can't do their damned jobs, if they think extortion is a legitimate element of political debate, they should go home.
...and everyone coming on to comment is arguing that this is still sexist. Because...reasons. 		Somehow, applying consistent principals is discriminatory. 		This is why we lose.
GOP on health care:	Pay doctors with chickens.		GOP on federal employees:	Cut the grass for your landlord.		GOP on corporate donors:	"Here, have some tax cuts AND subsidies AND power AND control of regulations. Poor, poor suffering corporations."
@robsalk @DavidNeiwert @lauraapollo @peterdaou EXACTLY. Running with the "let's impeach! Let's impeach!" means that when Mueller report arrives, if it has anything serious to say, it will be much harder to persuade the people needed to convict to take it seriously.
To be clear: I criticize decisions, actions and failures. If you see my criticism solely through the prism of whether I am talking about a man or a woman - and have a different opinion depending on which it is - then YOU are sexist. My standards dont change depending on gender.
@Malaury25041412 @peterdaou Again, long-term strategic success or flippant self-satisfaction. Thats the choice. And it astonishes me how many people are choosing indulging their emotions rather than succeeding.		This  is now being positioned by conserv media as proof impeachment is purely partisan. Benefit?
@disasterpastor Nope. Their contributors - other than the biggest ones - use airports for business travel. Make them wait for 40 minutes in a security line and the phones will be ringing off the hook on capitol hill.
@erinmaggiehvote @RashidaTlaib The sexism you demonstrate to make this a woman's issue - when I condemn everyone who demeans us by cursing as a form of political debate, starting with Dick Cheney - is ridiculous. Just because I treat women the same way I treat men doesnt mean I am discriminating against women.
Gee, for some reason, TSA employees who have been ordered to work without pay are starting to call in sick in mass numbers. That means lots of chaos at airports. 		Will GOP ever figure out no one will work for free long-term? When the planes are grounded, maybe they will get it.
@davidharsanyi @whpresscorps You?
@amore20188 @peterdaou Youre not a member of congress. You are allowed to say whatever you want without consequence to long term political strategies.
@peterdaou ...when you are with a president who might be mentally ill and a GOP that won't fight him, we don't have the luxury of handing weapons to GOP simply so we can feel a moment of personal satisfaction.		Play the long game. Focus. Acknowledge when there's a dem error. And move on.
@peterdaou Peter - here is how this would have gone away. "I used an inappropriate word for the President. The office deserves more respect than that."		Done. 		Instead, we are still discussing and excusing, while Fox is using it as proof that impeachment is purely partisan. It is ALL loss.
@truckindawg1 @HonestPolitics7 @billy_rothman @findtruthalways @RepWilson @realDonaldTrump Im trained in deception detection. Have spent my whole career doing that. And the first time I spoke to Trump in 1987, the first words out of his mouth were a lie. He lies more than any person I have ever known. And since he became president, he has gotten worse.
@Celticlassy10 @cincity631 @peterdaou I see you would rather indulge how you feel than succeed. 		If impeachment is spun purely as something partisan, before there is even a final report, then it will not succeed. But you'll feel good about using words about a president that you would never accept for a dem president
@WhenIs2001 @peterdaou Yes, and it is absurd. What is so difficult about saying, "Yah, that was not appropriate to say about a president. She was in private and a new Congresswoman, so she'll learn. Let's move on..."		Just because GOP rationalizes with idiocy when their wrong doesnt mean we should.
@riseup1moretime Cant have both. Winning is hard and requires long-term strategy. Flippant acts for self-satisfaction can - and almost always do - undermine strategy.
@TeaRocckanova @ProgressNow00 @RashidaTlaib Because I am more concerned about long-term strategic success than about feeling good because I cursed someone I don't like. Smug self-righteousness and an inability to engage in self-recognition of error is why we lose.
Self satisfaction is the enemy of success. 		Success is a long game, self-satisfaction is often flippant and poorly thought out.		If you fight to feel good about yourself, or to poke a stick into political opponents, you lose.		Fight to win.
@Frank_P_Ramsey @peterdaou No, I'm not. This "we cant criticize our own actions cause everything they do is worse" is the prescription for failure. This event already become a talking point about how impeachment is purely partisan. We will hear that for months. Self-satisfaction often undermines success.
@hear_tweets @TylerLClark @RashidaTlaib The option is not be crude or be a wimp. I wreck lots of institutions in investigative reporting, and never have I cursed at them. 		Be tough, fight hard, be civil. Being uncivil just undermines chance of success.
@La_Avion_ You have to remember, I have known this guy since 1987. There is no grand plan. He is this dumb.
@peterdaou Peter, Jesus. This is the kind of sophistry that makes everyone look stupid. Don't adopt the GOP "whataboutism." When someone makes a mistake, chide &amp; move on. Don't say "OH! BUT WHATABOUT...?" 		If you insist on doing that, join the idiots on fox news, cause thats their argument

@Lizerenity ....suggesting I have to use a different standards when I am talking about a woman is the height of sexism. Members of Congress, the Judiciary, and the Executive are not just any other people. What they say can mean the difference between success and self-satisfactied failure.
@Lizerenity I am signaling her out because, on the first day of the Dems in Congress, she just gave ammunition that is being fired everywhere proclaiming that impeachment discussion is pure partisanship. It has given "evidence" that will be marshaled in Senate debate if there's impeachment..
@TylerLClark @RashidaTlaib So how low should we go? Start waving signs on the floor of the congress saying "F*** YOU!!!" 		Perhaps we should stop proclaiming that the most crude and obscene president in history should set the standards of behavior all of us should follow.
@carlielion7 @fresafresca3000 @RashidaTlaib I am offended that you are speaking about that rather than about children in cages.		See how stupid that is? It is using actual suffering as a means of cutting off discussion people don't want to hear. Not DOING anything about it, just using it to refuse to discuss a dem's error.
@sallyfoxboro @RashidaTlaib But again, this is typical Republican "what about" argumentation. There is right and there is wrong. There is behavior that advances goals, and there is behavior that impedes it. This will now be held up for months as proof that impeachment is only partisan. Self-indulgent harm.
@Lizerenity I dont know if I have ever used a swear word to describe a political leader. I know I have never done so in public.		And I have relentlessly condemned Trump's crude and obscene statements and behavior.		And it is pure sophistry to pretend this has anything to do with gender.
@fresafresca3000 @RashidaTlaib I can't stand it when people say "I dont like what you are talking about, so talk about something else."		Too bad. I do not cater to one set of beliefs. My "team" is not always right. If you need someone to reinforce your beliefs and only cater to your outrage, thats not me.
@ProgressNow00 @RashidaTlaib What does objecting to the use of obscenities to describe political opponents - which I have condemned all the way back to the first one I heard of, Cheney in 2003 - have to do with her being a woman?		YOU are being sexist.
@AndersonLance @HeyJude080349 You are doing exactly what I am saying should not be done. You are saying "He is terrible, so why can't we be terrible?"		Because we are better than that.
@Casmyr @RashidaTlaib 1. I've been there. I've met with the folks who crossed the border. Have you? Or just tweeted about it?		2. By making impeachment seem purely partisan, it makes removal - if case proves out - more difficult. If youd rather say "MF!" than act on crimes and misemeanors, so be it.
@MBrodeur @RashidaTlaib ...so, when I condemned (as did democrats universally) Cheney for saying "f*** you" to a democratic senator, i should have just sided with the "boys will be boys" excuse?		How in the name of GOD is this a gender issue? Wrong is wrong.
It's amazing that this country has become so infantile that many believe it is not only appropriate for leaders to spew obscenities about political opponents, but is somehow necessary.		It is better to be successful than "right." Possible impeachment cannot be cast as partisan.
@jmk_bnr Like I said, the biggest problem with dems is that they would rather be "right" than successful. As a result, they constantly feed attack lines to the Republicans. This one will be used to portray any impeachment action as purely partisan, not as part of a Constitutional crisis.
@kevinwatts @RashidaTlaib There is a strong probability that Trump requires impeachment. I believe it is a serious Constitutional issue pertaining to abuse of power, witness tampering and obstruction.		And I believe she just made it incredibly easy to say it is all partisan. She's in congress, not college
@fresafresca3000 @RashidaTlaib Ummm...yes, repeatedly. Even went to Austin to visit with folks directly affected. What did you do?
@thencarolsaid @RashidaTlaib ...feel free not to follow me.
@HeyJude080349 So, she cannot do all those things without calling the president of the united states a mother******? Without making impeachment sound like a "hey let's do it!" before there is a final report?		Is it more important to be successful or to be superior?
@strongjalopy @RashidaTlaib ...this is like Republicans justifying torture because the Taliban cuts off heads.		You compare yourself to the standards of civility, not to Trump.
...the problem with making impeachment an applause line: It undermines the serious of this and portrays it as a partisan endeavor, not a serious constitutional issue that must be resolved. If impeachment is needed, it must be through deliberation and seriousness, not this.
I strongly condemn @RashidaTlaib use of an obscenity to describe the president, as well as using impeachment as an applause line.		These are not 2 competing football teams. And that President "Grab em by the P***y"  is crude is irrelevant. You dont sink to the level of the worst.
I think the most pathetic thing in this country is that the GOP no longer can just say "this is a policy we have to support." EVERYTHING is a crisis, everything is going to kill us all, everything is terrorists. 		The cowardice and histrionics and deception are just astounding.
New lie: Pence says "7 terrorists arrested per day" at border. White House just upped it to 10 per day EVERYWHERE, not just border. 		Reality - not arrests, encounters. Everywhere. Of people on terror watch list. Same list of ppl GOP says should not be limited from buying guns.

@BluAngel54 Why? No security expert recommends a wall. Almost all say it is the worst option in terms of expense and efficacy. They universally recommend technology developed by military and tested law enforcement. "Wall" is just a good chant. We should really spend $25B on the worst option?

A simple question:		If Obama shut down government unless Senate fully funded Obamacare, would GOP have blamed GOPrs? And if not, why are they blaming dems for the same thing, only it's the wall?		We cant know what dems would do. They have never shut down government for blackmail.

@authorclondon Tell @notredame. Their explanation for driving the kid out are so insane that they either are lying or just incredibly blinded by their own incompetence to recognize they violated the law.
@cwmagee @NotreDame Nope. From a stroke in utero.
@kathedden @NotreDame @NDAlumni ...they accepted him. After they learned of his epilepsy, and received notification from his doctor that if they did not allow him a single room he could die (complex explanation unsuitable for tweet), they said "Well, that's too bad. Risk death or leave."	.
Most interesting things coming out of my tweeting on football day about @notredame driving out a kid with epilepsy: Sociopaths replying "no one cares" and "let football players play." 		THIS is what is wrong with this country. And if ND alumni - something wrong with that school.
@OldBreed1775 @NotreDame @NDAlumni Yes, because nothing is more important than someone playing a game. For god's sake, stop talking about the school breaking the law and destroying a kid with a disability! There are balls to throw!		What a sociopath.
Since people are paying attention to Notre Dame today because of football, tell me @NotreDame and @NDAlumni: Why the school refusing to accept offer from people from a prominent epilepsy group to meet with you &amp; educate you bout epilepsy so you dont drive out kids with it again?
As Notre Dame trends for football, remember: This is the same school that drove out a kid by refusing a tiny accommodation for his epilepsy. Perhaps they could've used .0000001% of their football $ from JUST today to abide by the law. @NotreDame @NDAlumni https://t.co/9OoIZ6xOBF

Normally tweeting that president should resign would have zero meaning. But because the lunatic in the White House is a narcissist obsessed with praise, using #TrumpResign #ResignTrump  #ResignTrump makes him go berserk. So, to open the government, keep tweeting all of those.
@AlexRad17 ...walls work as military strategic items when the wall is occupied by soldiers. It works somewhat for personal security (George Harrison was murderer by a guy who scaled his wall ). Walls unmanned and designed just to keep people from crossing a line done work.
@AlexRad17 You literally are comparing a wall around a home for personal security to a 2,000 mile wall designed to keep people from crossing a particular line? Again, perhaps before assuming you’re smart and barfing up talking points, read what even conservative expert analyses say....
@AlexRad17 ..and the idiocy of all this is you have been deluded by people pretending this will help when it is known to be very very low return and structurally, given the actual border, impossible. This is why border town republicans oppose it. They know it is stupid.
@AlexRad17 ...and if people like you read expert analyses rather than bumper stickers and watching Fox, you would learn that a wall is the most expensive, least effective means of having security. Wall in Arizona less effective than stepped up law enforcement and specific strategies.
Trump: “We MUST MUST MUST have wall money right now because there is a CRISIS at border.”		Reality: billion of wall money unspent, no builder contract, land issues unresolved. Wall will take decades. How will this solve a “crisis”? We shut down the government to please Limbaugh
Most laughable brandings: the GOP as the party of “personal responsibility.”		These people NEVER take responsibility for what they do. Even now - a last minute “give me what I want or I’ll shut down the government” -they blame on others for not giving them their shiny objects.

Here is how to discuss the wall in a simple graphic. San Diego has used both physical block - i.e. fence or wall - and specific law enforcement programs.		This shows: Physical blocks did nothing. Law enforcement efforts worked well. Trump wants $20 bill for what doesnt work. https://t.co/89eq849pSy

I really do believe that Trump has concluded the results will be different if he calls the "wall" the "steel slats."		Because that was always the issue. What to call it.

@Epicurious_me ...they wont care about that, because they have no understanding how one thing connects to the next. They'll just say "Good. All Muslims. let them kill each other." Without realizing how this could play out in a way that wrecks the west.
I really wonder, if Trump's insane blunder in Syria sets off a mideast conflagration - as army war college warns - will cult45 say "It was worth it, so we could 'own the libs'" thus demonstrating, once and for all, that they are motivated by the same reasoning as a 5 year old.
If we lose Mattis, the last sane control on an ignorant president who could get us all killed, will go. But who can blame him, when a president - without warning - declares false victory against ISIS and sets in motion a possible middle east conflagration. https://t.co/5I9nEAARtv
I remember in 2016 when Trump proclaimed he knew more about ISIS than the generals. 		Now he says ISIS is defeated. None of the generals agree. I guess “knowing more” means “knowing nothing.”
How many donations and applicants is @notredame willing to surrender just so they can continue refusing to meet with epilepsy experts willing to travel to school &amp; explain to them that they gave a kid with epilepsy a choice of "risk death or leave."		Intransigence is never smart.

Since tomorrow will be the 50th day of my tweeting at @notredame regarding them driving out a kid with epilepsy, I will tweet something special to celebrate. Or....apologize, Notre Dame.
@KingOfZarembo @RIPProgDadTV @chrisvognar @dallasnews Well...enemy of stupid people who slavishly drool whenever Fox dangles shiny rage-jewels in their face, I guess.

Another quick note to @NotreDame: Recently recorded an hour-long event for national television about my book, A Mind Unraveled. Spent 10-15 minutes discussing Notre Dame driving out kid with epilepsy and it responding by ignoring issue and just defaming me. 		You come off great.

@socdemnow ...when millions are slaughtered because you rely on simple bumper-stickers rather than actually reading about the intense complexities of where things stand in Syria right now, recognize: choosing belief and ignorance over reading is a very Fox thing to do.
@lashray Yes.

13...in Syria does not line up with Putin's interest. So it is a distinct possibility that, if they DO have any sense of what they are doing, Trump is just ceding power in that part of the world to Putin. That is clearly going on, but the added part is that are only method....

...note, this "acceptance" does not go outside the realm of state media and cult45. And Trump's fluffers. But still, it just goes to show that there is no reality anymore, that non-existent threats are threats, that real threats are not. All that matters is declaring victory.
@TennS4Ever Fox and Cult45.
It is simply jaw dropping that we have a president who can declare "victory" against an enemy - when even his own intelligence agencies and pentagon say it is not true, along with all the military specialists who say the same - and "victory" is suddenly accepted as fact.
Trump's Syria strategy as a house sale:		"Great, we are negotiating our departure from the house in hopes of protecting our interests in the neighborhood. Ok, the house is yours. We are moving out. Once we are gone, we'll start negotiating price."		Art of the Idiotic Deal.
@h0lyspirits @NotreDame Yah...by defaming me. They pretend the actual issue isn't an ADA violation, so either they have really really bad lawyers or think this is going to pass. So, slandering and libeling me seems to be their go-to strategy. 		Won't work.

@GoldenRuleLover I'm not breaking them up that way. They are divided by those who spread conspiracy theories and those who based in reality. Trumpers are consumed by conspiracy theories, but it has become so basic to conservatism that many others are too. No problems with reality-based ones.

Ummm....Rudy just confessed on Trump's behalf. "The bank robbery was over before the election." And no, the crime is not collusion. It is conspiracy, aiding and abetting, etc. in the collusion.

@catgrinner ...just my medication to stay alive costs $50,000 a year in non-negotiated price. (Insurance companies negotiate price down with pharma companies, which is why uninsured prices are so high.) If I lose my insurance and am not ready to leave, I risk death after I run out of money.

@ImpeachAgtOrang @GOP ...and if you ever get the self Awareness to realize YOU and your fellow protest voters put kids in cages, YOU knocked millions off of their health insurance, because YOU knew it woild happen. You just cared more about being able to preen in front of friends about your purity.

@morovis00687 @clifftyll They would prefer if we die. Whenever republicans call people with chronic diseases and disabilities “freeloaders” that is exactly what they are saying.
@ImpeachAgtOrang @GOP ...next you will tell us that President jill stein will save us all. 		Grow up and face the real world that your narcicissm created. Protest voters disgust me. “I love humanity, but to hell with the millions of real people who suffer because of my self righteousness”
@ImpeachAgtOrang @GOP Ha. I knew it. Who did you “protest” vote for? What “statement” did you make that got kids locked in cages and millions without health insurance?		Protest voters are pure narcissists and frigging evil bastards because they KNOW the stakes. They just don’t care.
@EnsellJudith @alexbaltzegar I will not put my life at risk for politics. There are real countries in the world where people who live successful lives despite preexisting conditions are considered admirable, not leeches on society who need to die.
@ImpeachAgtOrang @GOP You are either a bot or one of the protest voters whose “purity” put us in this nightmare to begin with. Republicans vote to win. Democrats vote to feel good about themselves. Real people suffer. Screw it.
@alexbaltzegar To be blunt - screw you. I am not going to stay here and die of a preexisting  condition becAuse self-righteous protest voters are willing to put us all in hell and doom millions to misery for their “purity.” 		So, when your life is at stake, sneer. Until then, shut the fuck up.
@clifftyll Still have a few years. When my wife has to retire, we will only have my group insurance for me. If I lose it in GOP america, I will die or go bankrupt. So, we stay until she retires.
@mslassie I know. And that rips me up. But it is the problem of living in a country where huge numbers want to burn it down just to “own” the libs while not realizing this is all about aiding the rich.
@JonasPWerner Good luck. But I am being told this country doesn’t want me or people like me with chronic diseases. I would rather give up on america and live rather than stick with it and die.
America is not number one. The people who chant that have no idea. Now that people with chronic diseases once again must fight to obtain medical care, it is time to go to a real country. My wife has renewed her foreign passport. We will be leaving when she is ready to retire.
Thanks to the sociopathic obsession of the @gop to make sure that as many Americans as possible suffer: prexisting conditions are no longer required to be covered in the United States. High risk pools don’t work. Welcome back to hell.
Its tough to remember all the Trump scandals, but a reminder: Trump is the first president in American history to enter into a civil fraud settlement shortly before he entered the White House. GOP ignored Trump University fraud while going after Clinton emails for millionth time.
I am at the same spot with Trump that I was during the Clinton impeachment falderal: While I do not know yet if there is enough to make impeachment necessary or wise, I have no doubt that the president through his actions has contaminated the office through lies, and must resign.
@DavidLewis61 @POTUS @Twitter Cant. That would require court having provided injunctive relief. It only gave declaratory relief cause an injunction would be a statement it believed Trump would ignore ruling, which said "all government officials are presumed to follow the law as has been declared." Not Trump
@trexmarshall @POTUS @Twitter Or, rather than sneering, you could read the attached court decision to see that what you wrote is 100% correct: Trump is violating a declaratory judgment, which was not issued as an injunction on the SOLE belief that he would follow the law. The judge says that. Trump didnt.
@libertytosay @POTUS @Twitter Interesting that you talk about liberty, but blow off a ruling by the court regarding our constitutional rights. Flexible principles I guess.
...bottom line: As everything else has shown, this president has utter contempt for the law. Courts cannot issue declaratory judgments on Trump, because if there are no "we can hold you in contempt" elements to the ruling, Trump will blow it off. Like any other criminal would.
When @POTUS fought to keep blocking people on @twitter, he lost. Court in May told Trump his actions are illegal, but said it didn't need to issue a court order since "no president is above the law" &amp; judges felt certain he would comply.		Im still blocked. https://t.co/7v0ZjTx6nC
@laurelworlds @NJDSC It is wrong when anyone does it. You cannot have flexible absolutes. If you stand for nothing but manipulating victory, you stand for nothing.

@Kallen130vt @NotreDame That's the difference between you and neurologists, epileptologists and other experts: They understand the issues and medical complications; you don't.

@ConsultantsUnlt Good. Tell the kid he has my thanks and admiration.
I find it amusing how many people are so angry at Trump that when they read the word “deal” - even though it is one designed to expose his BS and does nothing else - they go berserk.
A simple proposal: Trump said he would get Mexico to pay for the wall because he is such a good negotiator. 		So Congress makes a deal: agree to authorize a dollar for a wall for every dollar Trump negotiates from Mexico. He only has to do half what he promised. (He’ll get none)
@sirpenski A master race doesn’t drive puke green cars from the 1970s. A Dodge Dart is one from that decade that is not a collectible, but just junk. Therefore it is making fun of their self-identification as top of the world.  		Got it?

@tinselkitty @bradley_texidor @Katie53286169 @NotreDame Following you
@JimmyJamesWWG1 Thus why it is a case out of the us attorney for southern district, which is dealing with financial fraud, and not special counsels office, which is dealing with Russia case. Ah, facts...they are so difficult to keep up with.
Trump says the filings today "cleared" him.		This is why you can't discuss this kind of stuff with Cult45. They will repeat this - fueled by garbage from Fox - and have no idea that the documents actually implicate Trump in a series of felonies, and his company in many more.
Done.
27...you can't go to jail for fraud - and money laundering that follows it - if you do not have the intent to commit fraud. There is no transitive property of financial fraud.		So, if the CFO testified Trump knew...thats the end of his presidency. Or would be in a normal country.
26...belongs in jail, not just impeached and convicted. These are major financial crimes, far more than a campaign finance violation. 		BUT...dont jump the gun. Dont proclaim his guilt or make up standards ("CEOs are responsible even if they don't know" or other nonsense)....
25...was paid in 12 broken up pieces to disguise it from being a pure reimbursement. Instead, it was portrayed as a consulting payment. This, again, is evidence not only of criminal intent, but of money laundering.		So, P2 is the key to this. If Trump knew of P2, he....
24...Trump was involved on the front end - P1. We will know, once the testimony of the CFO comes out, whether Trump was involved in P2, the back end.		One fact I forgot: The $460,000 payment to Cohen (the stormy payoff, the fake IT work, the tax bump up and the $60,000 bonus)....
23...BUT he was given immunity. And you don't get immunity if all you have to offer up is lower-level executives.		Which brings us to the last piece: We do not know yet if Trump was involved in this. We also don't know that he wasn't. What we know is this happened - and that...
22...if the Trump Org received ANY additional loans since 2016, and failed to disclose these activities, it will be an ongoing bank fraud. There may be tax issues, but hard to know yet.		Back to the CFO: He is the key witness in all of this, potentially the key participant.....
21...the bank that was raided not too far back. If Deutsche KNEW of this crime, then it is part of the conspiracy. If it did not, then the Trump Organization engaged in fraud by violating its covenants with the bank (i.e.: Don't commit crimes) and failing to disclose....
20...a roundup for taxes PLUS a bonus for what was done. And it was done for the campaign.		Next, fraud: The Trump Organization has what are called covenants with its banks. The only bank in the world that is willing to lend these bozos money anymore is Deutschebank. As in....
19...steps it takes, the more evidence of money laundering. Making it all the worse - they upped the amount to account for taxes, kicked in a $60,000 bonus. This is strong evidence of conspiracy to commit a crime. Think about it - how often does anyone get paid money with....
18...the recipient of the payment, reimbursed by a corporation to the owner of a HELOC, all in violation of campaign finance rules. That is money laundering - manipulating directions of cash used in a crime for the purpose of concealing its provenance. The more....
17...innumerable operations, including the break in. Here, the Trump Organization is the sole contributor to the slush fund. Now, making this all the worse is that the money flowed through multiple sources to disguise its ultimate source - from a HELOC to a bogus corporation to..
16...use the Trump Organization as a slush fund for cash to the campaign. Think of it as being like the slush fund of Nixon in Watergate. Nixon WH shook down corporations for $ which was then under the control of campaign and white house officials. It was used to finance....
15...the IT payment is the drop dead element. Given the supposed IT work was done for trump CAMPAIGN, paid for by the Trump ORGANIZATION, it shows that his company was issuing checks to cover campaign expenditures. This establishes the intent to commit the crime - that is, to....
15...so, what do we know about P2? It was paid after submission of an invoice - a frigging INVOICE - from Cohen to Trump Org saying it was for campaign expenditures. It billed not only the $130,000 for the Stormy payoff, but also another $50,000 in IT work for the campaign...
14...which would have been a lock-down, undeniable campaign finance violation.		It is much much much much worse than that. The payment - P2 - came from Donald Trump's company, the Trump Organization. And everything about how it was paid suggests - or shows - criminal activity....
13...given what Cohen said in court when he pleaded guilty, he had been reimbursed, but the question was down to who and how. It could have come from Trump, which would have made a campaign violation almost impossible to prove. Or it could have come from the Trump campaign....
12...interpretive: was this considered a contribution from Cohen, and was it done purely for election purposes? The repayment was always the important issue. The potential illegality of the original payment was hard to prove without knowing about the repayment (P2). I figured...
11...conspiracy, money laundering, fraud AND campaign finance violations. To explain: In P1, Cohen sent money from his home equity line through a corporate shell ultimately to Stormy Daniels. The proof, without P2, that this was in violation of campaign finance laws is largely...
10...the CFO, Allen Weisselberg, would know everything about P2. Including if Trump's approval was sought for it. If so, Trump would definitely be implicated in not only of campaign finance violations through P1 and P2, but MORE important, would be implicated in...
9...one of the most interesting witnesses in all of this case was the CFO of the Trump Organization. When I saw he had been granted immunity in August, I thought: Financial crime. I assumed it was linked to info related to Cohen, but knew that was speculation....
8...which leads us to P2 - the MAJOR crime, with the payments coming out of the Trump Organization.. The sentencing memo does not say that Trump was involved in P2. It doesn't say he wasn't. If he WAS, he belongs in jail. And prosecutors know if he was already....
7...knowledge &amp; intent regarding that payment, he could easily argue technical violation based on poor information -or disagree that there was a violation at all by saying this was not about the campaign, but for, say, keeping Melania from finding out he had banged a porn star...
6...Trump could fight this one and, in the end, he might defeat it by simply saying "Cohen told me this was out of his home equity, I considered it a favor, and did not have anything to do with my campaign." Not so believable? Sure. But without specific designation of Trump's....
5...as described, crimes. P1 is the one where Individual 1 is specifically implicated - that being Trump. That constitutes a campaign finance violation. However, this is a low level violation, and one that is open to interpretation depending on the specifics of what Cohen says..
4...the distinction between these two payments is absolutely critical. Trump himself has been implicated in P1 both by Cohen and in the sentencing memo. The Trump Organization...and officials there...have been implicated in P2 through the sentencing memo. Both P1 and P2 are...
3...so, let's discuss this so that everyone can understand what the memo says happened, because it is jaw dropping. 		There are two payments at issue here - one of which for $460,000 was broken up into 12 payments. Let's call them P1 and P2, recognizing that P2 was broken up....
2...many are ranting with little understanding of corporate crime, the law and the implications. They are mixing up one payment with another - or many others. They don't understand the magnitude of what is going on here. And that is because it is not their area of expertise...
1. Everyone has some area of expertise. Mine is in corporate crime. I reported about it for 20 years at NY Times, wrote all or parts of 4 books about it, give lectures at biz schools and major corporations about it. 		Which leads us to the Michael Cohen sentencing memo....
@PurpleChad You are not responsible for criminal conduct in a corporation if you are unaware it occurred unless you purposely structured it to be unaware. So hold on. Wait to see if he was involved in repayment. They know. They have CFO testimony. If he’s involved, he committed major crimes
@carpinsandiego Individual one agreed to cohen making payment. He doesn’t get mentioned in reimbursement and method of reimbursement. That is the big crime. Did he do it? We will find out.
As @FoxNews rants about poor Manafort being charged cause he wouldn’t tell Mueller what he wanted to hear: read filing. Manfort repeatedly told 1 story, then changed when informed of evidence. He lied bout contacts with Trump officials...Mueller has the electronic communications.
Folks seem mad that Im refusing to say "Trump knew" about illegal payments out of Trump Organization.		Im opposite of cable news: dont speculate. Memo doesnt say Trump, so Im not comfortable saying any POTUS committed such a huge felony based on my belief. Only say what I know.
@Wakefield990 That is not the same thing. It is the nature of the payment, where it came from and how it was paid that elevates this from a campaign violation (which Cohen said Trump knew about) to conspiracy, money laundering and fraud.
By the way, when @FoxNews etc start bleating "nothing about collusion" in the Cohen sentencing memo that lays out huge financial crimes at Trump Org, remember: This is not from Mueller. This is Southern District of New York US Attorney. They aint investigating collusion.
In the grotesque and deeply criminal money laundering, fraud and campaign violations coming out of Trump Organization as depicted in Cohen sentencing memo, im NOT saying Trump knew. Memo doesn't say. I AM saying, if Trump did know, we have a financial felon in the White House.
@BPiblic $460,000. Money laundering, fraud, conspiracy, AND a campaign violation. Perhaps if you read, you would learn. Read the memorandum. These are major crimes. Someone at Trump Org is going to jail. If Trump knew about it or agreed to it - we have a financial felon in the White House
5...depending on how it reported on the books, it could also be tax fraud. If Trump knew ANYTHING about this payout, he is a criminal. When Fox bleats "nothing about collusion" it would be as if they said on B. Clinton "nothing about Lewinsky, ignore the bank robbery in there."
4...disguise the nature of the payment - one massive payout in an illegal campaign contribution from Trump Organization - they break it up into multiple payments distributed over the year of $35,000 each. This is conspiracy, money laundering, campaign finance violations, fraud...
3...to the Trump Organization, submits a bill for CAMPAIGN expenses. He also submitted a $50,000 bill for campaign related IT expenses. The company then pays him $180,000, rounds it up so he breaks even on taxes (to $360,000), THEN kicks in a $60,000 bonus for $420,000. To....
2...it is jaw dropping. If Trump knew ANYTHING about this (which Cohen had said he does) he must not only be impeached, he must go to prison.		Cohen borrowed $130,000 from his HELOC, washed it through a bogus corporation, paid Stormy Daniels. Ok, knew that. THEN, he goes back....
1. I have been reading the Cohen sentencing memorandum, thinking "Yeah, ok...yeah, ok.." Not much of a reaction. Clearly Cohen, Trump et. al. are smarmy as hell.		Then...OMIGOD! Trump Organization $ laundering, illegal campaign contributions, done in coordination with...someone..
This sentence from the Cohen sentencing memorandum is easily the funniest - and (though legally-required to be written this way) most ridiculous - I have ever read in a court filing. I wonder who individual 1 is? https://t.co/YilIhU2Ljb

3...and remember, like all good propagandists, they tell viewers that they can only believe Fox, and all other media sources lie. We have to accept - the people who watch this are gone. They are unreachable by reality. There is no debate to be had. They cannot imagine that....
2...then an attack on French president Macron (seriously) who has been a thorn in Trump's side. Then, a quote from Trump attacking Tillerson, without explanation in headline of where this came from. Then opinion piece after opinion attacking Mueller, Comey and. yes, Obama...
1. Looking at @foxnews website, it really is like an alternative world, both factually and journalistically. The world's biggest story? Comey wouldn't discuss confidential material when Trump's DOJ told him not to. (Fox portrays it as Comey's choice, and call him "gleeful")...
Now that Rex Tillerson is talking about what it was like working for Trump, Trump is raging that Tillerson was stupid and lazy. Yet...trump bragged only HE knew how to hire the best and hired him. So which is it @potus? Was Tillerson good or do you not know how to hire the best?
@CraigNJ66 @Comey @FoxNews No one cares what was said. It was just a shadow dance for fox programming.
As I wrote back when GOP was pushing huge tax cuts - huge tax cuts in a strong economy would force federal reserve to raise interest rates, mostly hurting middle/working class. All happened. Now Trump rages about Fed, not understanding HE and the GOP caused the increase.
As expected, the millisecond the republicans finished up with their questioning of @Comey in a closed hearing -which he wanted public so they wouldn’t run to @FoxNews to twist what was said (they refused to let it be public) -they ran to fox to talk about what was said. Pathetic.

@topherralph @NotreDame It is just another drug, like the 20 or so others. Each has a different impact on different patients.

@lukemburgess @NotreDame Ppl like you who believe they are experts because too stupid to know ur stupid, disgust me. U could read the research on this by googling epilepsy stigma. Or come with me to epilepsy groups I’m seeing and hear about lost jobs, friends, education. Or be arrogant in knowing nothing
A major epilepsy advocacy group is ready to go to @NotreDame to meet with officials there to explain how their driving out a kid with epilepsy was illegal or pure discrimination. 		They are just waiting for me to let them know when I believe theres no chance ND will admit error.
@lukemburgess @NotreDame “I know nothing so I will tell you my uneducated opinion because I am an American where certainty of belief has become a substitute for knowledge.”	https://t.co/qil8osLa0t
At American Epilepsy Society meeting, I told the CEO of a major pharma company all details of how @NotreDame drove out a kid with #epilepsy.		He says: “What idiot doctor said their decision was rational?”		Me: None. Consulted no experts. Wouldn’t even call kids MD.		CEO: Idiots.
Plz retweet		This is 32nd day Ive tweeted bout @NotreDame driving out a kid with #epilepsy. This wont stop til they apologize. 		Today I was at American epilepsy society meeting, telling doctors, advocacy groups and companies what ND did. All jaws dropped. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
@ShortArmOtheLaw @NotreDame You are an idiot. That is not how the ADA works. By your logic you could say “even students without wheelchairs don’t have ramps, so that’s not discrimination.”		Read up in the LAW. Are all Notre Dame grads/defenders as ignorant as this?
This will be the 32nd day I tweet about @notredame driving out a kid with #epilepsy. But...it will be delayed till later tonight. Out for evening. So I will discuss NDs ignorance, discrimination, and lack of integrity later this evening.
Many thanks to the wonderful people at @GreenwichBio for their work in CHICA - a system that will help patients and families learn about the danger of death in #epilepsy through #sudep (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.)
@ShortArmOtheLaw @NotreDame ...bottom line: you can’t say “risk death kid” and say it’s tradition and “not even athletes” who WONT die from this don’t get out of it. 		And if you support that - you are exactly the kind of person people with disabilities like me are fighting against.
@ShortArmOtheLaw @NotreDame A. They broke the law. “We prefer otherwise” does not allow them to ignore the ADA. 		B. Your captured by same ignorance as ND: that you know more than the doctor who has treated this kid his whole life. No, you don’t.  And discrimination comes from people who presume they do.

The story of @NotreDame driving out a kid with epilepsy -&amp; a 2nd school that did the same to another -shows the reality faced by those with #epilepsy. Whether from ignorance or discrimination, public fear of those with epilepsy leads to severe discrimination. This must stop. Now.
@twit_elder @NotreDame So, if someone's family member is murdered, are they biased for decrying people who break the law by murdering?		Bias means unreasonable presentation contrary to fact. Notre Dame broke the law. No bias enters the equation.

@TallManShort @NotreDame The source was...I found out about it as one of the many calls/emails I received from people on Notre Dame campus telling me horror stories. And what difference do the details make? Either a single room for a disability is not allowed or it is.
@TallManShort @NotreDame My source is directly involved. At the school. And why do you need the source to respond? And also - since religious institutions can’t receive federal money, will Notre Dame hand back the $100 mill they have receive in last decade? Or abide by the ADA. Can’t have it both ways.
@TallManShort @NotreDame ...and they don’t get credit for abiding by the ADA sometimes. Just like you don’t get credit for usually going the speed limit. When they break the law they break the law.
@TallManShort @NotreDame Perhaps if they want to be an  exclusively religious organization that is fine. But since they take federal funding: they are not and they are subject to the ADA. https://t.co/SzPAsxbsih
@TallManShort @NotreDame Ok. Explain this one. They made exactly this accommodation for the child of a large donor who had a different disability. Are these rules set in stone except when they affect people who give money? Do “religious” reasons disappear for donors?
@TallManShort @NotreDame Here’s the difference between you and me. I have read all the records and know what they say. You haven’t and think you know more. Hint: people who know less do not know more.
@TallManShort @NotreDame Read the Americans with Disabilities Act. If they are keeping someone out by refusing a reasonable accommodation, it is illegal. And no, there is no “religious” reason involving whether freshman have a roommate.
@TallManShort @NotreDame Seriously, are you THIS stupid? Believing that they can drive out a kid with epilepsy because they want freshman to have single rooms? Your rationale could be used to keep every kid with such a need out of every school.

@ChuckGrassley WAIT! I fell for it again. Republicans in the trump era have no commitment to reality. They recount “facts” and “events” not based on truth, but if what they make up reinforces their argument or belief.
@ChuckGrassley Umm...that never happened senator. He had a specific criticism of a particular decision and his criticism proved to be true. He never said a word about Alito. If you remember him rebuking Alito  - time to retire.  		And STOP the whataboutism. It is not an argument. It is whining.
@Lichten_Bright Yup. Go back and look at what I wrote in Newsweek months before election. In one article, i detail the breakdown he had in front of me in early 1990s that led me to change my mind about his psychological health.
13....so someday, just like when we discussed it in 1990, we will have to explain the incompressible events of trump. And I know the answer: just like it took me from 1990-92 to accept the truth, today many people still don’t see the President is mentally ill.
12....attacks on mueller, proclaiming the possibility of him being investigated causes the stock market to drop, etc. This is a dangerous situation, because when reality starts crashing down that he is not perfect, he will lash out even more....
11....not give trump the credit of calling him a liar. He is much more dangerous than that. He has no idea what is true or isn’t. All he knows is that he is perfect and he needs constant adulation to reinforce that belief. This is at the foundation of “fake news” screams....
10...the ill person believes he KNOWS what is true (in this case, he is perfect), but the pesky facts just keep getting in the way. So, folks like this conclude the facts are wrong, because it contradicts what they know to be true: for trump, that he is percent. So do...
9...discern the difference between truth and fiction. He starts with a psychologically unbalanced need to be considered perfect, better than anyone. As one psychiatrist explained to me this type of condition in someone else, facts become annoyances....

7....successful business folk don’t host game shows. So he spewed our, proclaiming himself to be whatever would get him applause - the same behavior we saw when we concluded he was mentally ill in 1990-92. He said he was smarter than everyone, better than everyone. He claimed....
6...went insane, electing a man whom banks would no longer loan money to (other than deutsche) who legit businessfolk wouldn’t go near. America thought he was successful because that’s who he played on TV. They never considered the reality that....
5...if they failed, saying “oh it’s just a branding deal” and if it succeeded saying “it’s because of my genius” even though he had nothing to do with it. Once he landed on a reality game show, it seemed like a spot we would have predicted back in 1990. But then, our country....
4....trump would simply end up being a failed businessman...wrecking companies, sailing along on his daddy’s money, and striking deals with his only real asset, the marketing value of his name. He did that - making deals with other builders to put his name on their projects...
3....one of the premier business writers of that time said, in 1990, “how will we explain trump to our children?” The question meant, how could anyone explain why banks loaned billions - even in the 1980s nutty financing - to such an unstable man. We all shrugged, assuming that..
2...was the consequence of strategic feigned insanity or the real thing. I was naive and could not believe someone as ill as he would have to be could function. So I said it was an act. It took two more years - 1992 - until I sides with others who said he was mentally ill...
1. Back in 1990, a bunch of New York Times reporters - including me - who wrote about Trump were all discussing him. There was a debate - was it an act or was he nuts? This was not a political debate. He was only a bizness guy who was looney, and the question was whether this...
@Kaisercash007 @NotreDame You misunderstand the point. It is very easy to see the absurdity of  using “community standards” as a qualifier for attendance when there is a race based issue. They have “community standard” that could kill someone with epilepsy and see nothing wrong with that.
@SamValley Sorry...doesn’t work that way unless they want to abandon all federal money - research, federal student loan benefits, etc. Private school is not a “all discrimination is legal” out.

I find it interesting that, in their decision to libel me for pointing out their abuse of a boy with epilepsy, @NotreDame relied on false information from: Russian disinformation organizations identified by CIA, pedophiles I got locked up, and alt-right trolls. Not bright, ND.

@itsauntB @NotreDame They can claim it. That is the gamble Notre Dame mad- that they would use that term and scare the kid that if he fought for his legal rights they would cost him a fortune. Even thought they are in the wrong. So I am doing it through public disclosure.
@TallManShort @NotreDame 4....listed three possibilities - they are stupid and didn’t consult a lawyer, they didn’t want a kid with epilepsy, or both. Given that they have now chosen to reiterate their illegal rationale as a justification AND libel me, I now believe stupid is a high probability.
@TallManShort @NotreDame 3....or obtain their own expert as the family requested. Instead they just said “we want students to have roommates.” By their standard, kids with brittle epilepsy cannot go to college if every school says “we want them to have roommates...”  Now, I....
@TallManShort @NotreDame 2...if someone has a doctor that says “because of this boys disability, the school’s desired tradition could kill him” the school can’t just say “well that is the way we want it.” It is not even close to legal. They also refused to call the doctor, the epilepsy foundation...
@TallManShort @NotreDame 1. The law is very simple: if someone requires an accommodation for a disability, it has to be provided. The sole exception is significant cost that leads to an undue burden. You can’t simply say “well, we have a tradition so screw your accommodation”....
Man. @NotreDame  doubled down on its excuse for driving out a kid with epilepsy rather than making a legally required accommodation by saying “we preferred otherwise” as if they can violate law because they feel like it. And in the process, they are libeling me too. Smart guys.
AMAZING! Rather than apologizing to the kid they drove out of school because of his epilepsy (which they are STILL excusing as “we preferred not giving him an accommodation”) @NotreDame has elected to libel me. 		Bad move.
@TallManShort @NotreDame Wow! Lies AND libel. @notredame ignorance is escalating this to the point of no return.

...AND apologize to the kid. I will never stop until they do.
Since @NotreDame refuses to apologize to the kid they drove out for epilepsy, my warned escalation begins. Today, I’ll discuss on national radio, start disclosing the names of the officials involved. ND has to retrain them on ADA and bring in neurologists to explain epilepsy.

How @GOP concludes that Navy Seal leader of Bin Laden attack must not be a republican:		Because he didn’t slavishly buff trumps privates while bowing and cringing to him, but instead stood up for foundational principles of America. Making him the enemy in GOP eyes.

@bulicny @bgoncalves @NotreDame ...and how many of them did not disclose it to the school before they arrived? How many needed a tiny accommodation that was refused? And what does your point have to do with the fact they drove someone out? Illegally, I might add.
SUDEP, just 1 type of death from #epilepsy, kills more kids every year than sudden infant death syndrome or house fires. It is 2nd only to strokes in loss of potential life years. And it accounts for less than half of deaths from epilepsy.		Why don't people know epilepsy kills?

For antivaxxers: from 1979 through 1995, only Japanese girls were required to have rubella vaccinations. Many boys went without.		Fast forward: rubella epidemic has broken out in Japan. Almost all of the infected are men from the years they were not innoculated.  Rubella kills.

@CannibalHoliday @NotreDame @NDAlumni @usedgov People here don’t see it either, unless they have epilepsy. It is done quietly. Even in Canada. That is why I am pushing this so hard. People need to find out what is happening to those of us with epilepsy. It needs to stop. https://t.co/Q5XlhmZVIn

@sgermano There is a category of democrats who are too narcissistic and self-impressed to vote. No amount of education can reach them. The party could spend 80% of its campaign funds trying to beg and plead for these people to vote, but it would be nothing but arguments about reality.

16...making it more interesting, 7 democratic incumbents did not face reelection, and 7 GOP incumbents also did not. In this, democrats made 7 pickups against republican incumbents. The total votes were pretty equal, so what about the spread? In Florida, it was 0.7%, coming off..
15...imagine if the dems had won 23 governorships and GOP had won 12. Those were the results in the senate, which Trump et al are presenting as a victory. But that is ONLY about majority retention. On actual wins, no. But governorships are just individual races, one on one....

10...to call this skin-of-the-teeth victory a major win is as ignorant as the dems who thought senate was going to be some sort of easy takeover. If this had been the only thing that happened, the story could be spun as "surprisingly close, but a victory for the GOP." But...
9...even look at the big flip: Florida spread was 0.4%, with GOP governor against the Senator. Both with huge public name. In Mississippi - yes, Mississippi - the Republican has only 0.6% lead (about 5,000 votes.) So, yes, GOPrs won mostly by small margins in red states...
8...was 2%. In deep red texas, a progressive lost to a deep red conservative by 2%, or 200,000 votes. That, while a GOP victory, shows a sea change happening in TX. In Arizona - friggin' Arizona - the Republican is only projected to win, because vote is so close - 0.9% spread...
7...the totals are this: 45 million people voted for dems in the senate, 33 million voted for GOP. That's right - in the closest (but sloppy) proxy for a national election, dems won 12 million more votes than GOP. The spread is also terrible for the GOP. In Texas, the spread....
6...that's right. The dems won almost twice the number of seats as the GOP, but did not take control. That shows how bad the numbers were this year. So, you have to look at the numbers every decent analyst was waiting for: total and spread. And those are horrible for GOP...
5...or others tried to explain the reality of the numbers, dems with more hope than facts would often proclaim that the senate would flip, as if it was some sort of super-house where everyone was up for reelection. In the end, it appears the dems won 23 seats, the GOP won 12....
4...kept coming up in describing path to victory. To win senate, dems would have to win 26 seats they already held, then flip two republican seats in red states to dem. Possible - that is why so much hope was placed on Beto. But still very unlikely. Unfortunately, every time I...
3...that meant that, to flip the senate, the dems had to win 28 races. To keep the senate, the GOP only needed to win 8. Moreover, the election map was, according to 538, the most unfavorable for any party in history of US elections. This is why the term "thread the needle"....
2...let's start with the most important numbers: 26 and 9. These are the key to the BS claims of "victory" by GOP, and why every smart politico ahead to the election was saying probability of dems winning senate was as close to zero as possible. Dems defending 26 seats, GOP 9...

@JermePhilip The number of times in my life when people hav said “x party will never have again” has included House,senate and presidency.  Political cycles always swing. Always. That’s why compromise is the usual style of governance, until modern times.
...the numbers that state the numbers needed to win in 2020 incorporate today’s results so far.
For same reason flipping senate in 2018 was a long shot, 2020 is stronger. With 26 seats to defend, dems had to win 28 races to flip senate; with 9 seats up, GOP only needed to win 8 to keep it.  In 2020, gop has 20 seats to defend, Dems 11. So GOP will have to win 17,dems 14.
@jaimesevyn Because Democrats had 26 seats they had to defend, and gop had nine. In other words, dems had to win 28 races to flip senate while GOP only had to win 8 to keep it.
I knew, if GOP held senate, even though everyone knew Dem takeover was a long shot because of seats up, Trump would proclaim great victory and White House would credit trump. Mass loss is a win in trump land, and delusional leader must take credit for the fantasy victory.

@1Marchella Why do I come away from this believing you actually *didn't* vote because you were too pure to do so, given that no candidate was as perfect as you (and you can't be bothered to run to advance what you believe because you think posting memes is just as useful)?
Tomorrow on my eighth day of tweeting about @NotreDame decision to drive out this kid because he had epilepsy, I will be linking screenshots of some of the documents, so that ND students and alumni can know who was behind this obscenity. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
Please retweet		This is my 7th day tweeting about @NotreDame decision to drive out a kid with epilepsy. The will continue - &amp; escalate - until they apologize.		I was thrown out of school for this too. I know how traumatic it is. I'll not let it rest. Ever. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
...and please note where the lies generated from agents of the Cuban government were printed: The Daily Caller, then operated by Tucker Carlson. Conservatives are such easy prey for foreign agents because they will print ANYTHING so long as it is anti-dem.
I am still marveling that conservatives have continued spreading the lie about @SenatorMenendez and domican girls half a decade after it was show to be a scam. Now, in addition to working with agents of Russia, the GOP is working with agents of Cuba. Here is 2014 investigation: https://t.co/zpqx6alemu
@reggiejackson78 @SenatorMenendez ...but...they were BRIBED! And admitted it. And told the police they lied. And FBI concluded there was nothing there. And the money was traced to a Cuban sugar company, with Menendez being  huge block against trade with Cuba.		Seems like GOP will work with any foreign actor.
I had no idea conservs were still spreading lies about @SenatorMenendez and Dominican Republic. It seems nothing stops fantasies. Women admitted they were bribed - and a Cuban sugar company was implicated. But to conservatives - reality doesnt matter. https://t.co/t7uRrTU4ld
Interesting that @jimgeraghty - in typical propaganda mode - chose a photo of @BarackObama and @SenatorMenendez arriving to address American troops at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J. What's the matter Jim? You hate the troops? Or dont give a damn about deception? https://t.co/4ufcJtfW35

@pattigee No, it doesnt. That is a hypothesis. This is the kind of garbage I am talking about - people who know nothing about pharmacology saying "this does that!" You don't know. And you are harming people by pretending you do.
@CrackSpread What the fuck is wrong with you? First, you spew garbage about what I believe. Are you Russian or just stupid?		Second, you see tweets about people suffering and use it to advance your "love" of humanity that hates people. You are a liberal Trump: Consumed with narcissism.
@Sir_Bradford ...please stop. This is just ONE of dozens of anti-convulsants. It treats limited forms of epilepsy. It is necessary, but it is not a cure-all. It does for the vast vast majority, 		We've been hijacked by the "legalize marijuana" crowd who spread false information about epilepsy.
13....this has been my primal scream. Because I am tired of seeing the photos of the dead, the families who have lost their children, or parents, or grandparents, and then hearing TV producers say epilepsy is not serious.
12...I dont know what to do about it. It is an iron circle of torment. It is an iron circle of death. And it will never end until the media stops portraying us as weird, funny, no big deal, have miracle cures, etc. There is no cure.....
11....people with epilepsy hide, praying each day that they don't have a seizure in public. They tell no one. Because of the false beliefs of the public. Which is reinforced because no one speaks. And no one can speak, because the gatekeepers to media believe the ignorance....
10...we are dying. We are tormented. And TV producers cite all the falsehoods as a reason to ignore it. We are fired from jobs, we are thrown out of school. Both happened to me. We face the prospect of death every day. But the producers say it is not serious...

5...when I was at NY Times, every epilepsy article was run by me. I appreciated that, and I fixed a lot. Then, after I left, errors creeped in. But the Times tries. TV and most media - not really. Old wive's tales take the place of reality. 		And they won't....

The way discrimination against folks with disabilities work: the act is disguised in a false invocation of “burden” notifying the victim that they have to fight in court for their rights. 		That’s what @NotreDame did. Apologize or this will never end. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
The most outrageous reaction to my telling the story of how @NotreDame drove out a kid with epilepsy: that I’m attacking Christianity. 		Christianity is not a “get out of human decency” card and the ones who argue this have no idea what the religion means. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7

When discussing A MIND UNRAVELED with TV producers, we've repeatedly heard them recount falsehoods they believe about #epilepsy as reason not to discuss it. We face stigma, no one talks, and ignorance keeps it off the air. This is why I have come forward. https://t.co/OJHEekMbPn
@HRAskMe The workplace is horrible for people with epilepsy. The fear it engenders is overwhelming. I was fired my first day at a new job hours after they learned of my epilepsy. In Britain (only place poll taken) 62% of employers say having somebody w/ epilepsy would be a major issue.
I have no financial reason to promote A MIND UNRAVELED. Royalties go to #epilepsy charities. Because of stigma, millions with this disease hide, hoping to keep you from finding out.

Why did I write A MIND UNRAVELED, about living with #epilepsy?		Folks with epilepsy face stigma, lose jobs, education, friends. As a result, people with it refuse to speak. Ive had enough. Buy this book, which reviewers "remarkable" and "extraordinary.'' Read below to understand: https://t.co/WqAbf7pE9i
@pattio666 No, voting is not easy. But they can't stop you if you know the rules and are prepared to go through all the hoops. Yes, it can be difficult - that's the point of what they do. But they can't stop you. And local Dem party will help you know the blockades and how to pass them.
@BurkhanKhaldoom When you have a party that cares about nothing but tax cuts - but continuously throws out red meat to the faithful that they are *really* about hating gays, immigrants and stopping abortion - eventually even the most ignorant has to be able to see the scam.
@William_S_Chen They can't say "you're black so you have more requirements." They have rules that are most difficult for poorer communities, the elderly and college students. But if they are met, and if you are ready to do what it takes - even going to the board of elections - they cant stop you
@BurkhanKhaldoom Even the sickest patient can rally and recover. Or die.
@RlorD_2012 Yup. But they can't stop you no matter what. They throw up barriers, some of them insane (white kid has to go to multiple locations, finally to the board fo elections, to vote because they kept blocking him). If they break the law, keep pushing.
In 2008, my vote split between dems and GOPrs. In 2010, when GOP started going nuts, I voted almost all democrat except for Republicans I knew. Now - with the GOP in the throes of insanity, conspiracy theories, and lies - I have fully abandoned that party until it is sane again.
I voted. Brought every possible form of ID plus utility bills, changed out of my t-shirt with the name of a small eastern college. Voting was easy. You can jump through the hoops Texas GOP erects. Don't be put off on voting because of the barriers. They cant stop you if you try.

We're always listed as most stigmatized. I wrote A MIND UNRAVELED to combat that https://t.co/C2LZghqNMi
My book A MIND UNRAVELED was meant to counter vast public ignorance/stigma about epilepsy. But TV folk don't understand. We are told:	1. Epilepsy not serious. (Truth: Many die from it, stigma is brutal.)	2. Epilepsy cured? (No.) 	..and more. Can't educate if no one wants to hear. https://t.co/ynKb2wGxyN

@tgutting @JacobAWohl @Jack_Burkman I think I will need to explain to them what a pen is. And that there are two meanings of that word. And that they will soon be residing in one of them.
@Blodaksen @JacobAWohl @Jack_Burkman The bribery attempt, if it occurred, is really bad. It could be charged as a federal conspiracy to obstruct justice. That is MUCH worse than attempted bribery. If they DID bribe anyone else, then it is bribery, conspiracy and possible fraud. Real time.
@tgutting @JacobAWohl @Jack_Burkman I have a feeling we will find out that they learned it is VERY hard to fake an affidavit in proper form. They need a notary - one who is identifiable - and no one is going to lose their notary license and go to jail for fraud to help these knuckleheads.
@Robertwaldeck @MichaelGamache If she is not telling the truth, she dropped out just in time to avoid charges.
Hey @JacobAWohl and @Jack_Burkman: How stupid are you guys? You can't docusign an affidavit. Perhaps next time you want to engage in nonsense, speak to a lawyer about how this works. Meanwhile, go back to being more brilliant than Mozart while the rest of us laugh at your idiocy. https://t.co/RXbaiuwwCy
@LudwigsGhost ....so whatever she said is not in play yet.
@LudwigsGhost She has said nothing and signed nothing. Whatever she says to these two knuckleheads is irrelevant - she didn't actually sign the document, and you are legally allowed to lie to a couple of idiots.
@MichaelGamache @Robertwaldeck if the bribe part is true, yup.
@SportingHutchie Dont post this. Delete or get blocked. I will not be connected in any way with people outing this woman. She has stayed silent, and there is no evidence she signed anything.
@horrorpalooza Yes, it's docusigned. Its an online signing thing. It is "click" over the internet. This is as much of an affidavit as a piece of toilet paper.
@Robertwaldeck ...too late. It is an overt act in an ongoing fraud. Offering the bribe - if that is what happened - was the crime. This is also the evidence of intent. These guys need to grab their toothbrushes for a trip to federal prison.
@snowydroplet Conservatives are so certain that it is so easy to set up fake sexual assault allegations - which they keep accusing democrats of having done - that these idiots thought all they had to do was trot this out. The Two Stooges.

A note People didn’t understand: I was there with friends who knew what to do and were dealing with it. If @LesleyRStahl or anyone else had gotten involved, they would have been in the way. The best thing she could have done was what she did - move the table and go back to work.
@coyotecreek158 @LesleyRStahl She did absolutely the right thing. I had friends there who knew what to do, they were dealing with the situation, and other people would have just been in the way.
@HRAskMe @LesleyRStahl Stay calm, do not put anything in their mouths, put something under their head, do not hold them down. If you don’t know if the person has epilepsy, call an ambulance. If you know they do have it, and they are still seizing after four minutes, call one then.
Trump has now declared that about ten percent of the people in America are illegal aliens.  And you know there are idiots out there who will start to say this over and over, squawking like a parrot repeating their masters gargantuan lies.
...by the way @LesleyRStahl - at the time I was in my twenties, a nobody doing work with the 1984 election unit. So you would not have known me.
In my book A Mind Unraveled, I describe when I had a seizure in the CBS cafeteria and was told I landed ON or NEAR @LesleyRStahl I Was told she was cool about it, moved her table and went back to work. I don’t know if it was on or near. Lesley - if you see this - do you remember?
@janna_bastone @POTUS @FoxNews Because in addition to being told how weak and whiny everyone else is, they are constantly told how everyone is abusing conservatives and oppressing them. Making them weak and whiny.
A test for @foxnews: either tucker or hannity say something negative - anything negative - about trump. Just once. Something that isn’t treating him like state media treats Kim Jong Un. 		Then watch the death threats roll in. Join journalists that do real work, not c-buffing.
.@potus, @foxnews griping that reporters saying Trumps tone of hate and aggression contributed to mass murder and assassination attempts. 		We know it’s true because anyone who writes anything that doesn’t kowtow to trump gets death threats from loons. Constantly. Never before.
I’ve come to think, after years of believing they were spinning for money/power, that @FoxNews, other conserv media and GOP politicians actually BELIEVE their conspiracy theories about Soros, stand down orders, Kenya, caravans, Dems sending bombs to themselves, etc.  It’s insane.
As best I can find, trump said nothing about the 11 massacred people who were buried yesterday on trip to Pittsburgh. He did however find time to whine about how cable news covered protests of him. Malignant narcissism.
Republicans are ranting about imaginary Islamic terrorists hidden among the “caravan” walking now through Mexico. 		...and ignore the white supremacist terrorists who are actually killing Americans.

Please retweet. 		This is the first of what will be a daily tweet until @NotreDame apologizes in writing to the young man they drove out of school because he has epilepsy. 		ND: The emotional impact of your discrimination can be extreme. Apologize. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7

Perhaps, @NotreDame, let me remind you of the faith you profess to practice. Read 1 John 1:9. 		And if you still won’t seek the forgiveness of the boy you pushed out because of his epilepsy, you have shown the world what you really are. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
A note to people applying to @NotreDame: if you have a disability that might scare them, go somewhere else. And if you are an alum, ask them why they are putting the school’s reputation at risk. I will never let anyone forget their discrimination. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7

I have deleted my tweet that said this has nothing to do with trump and the GOP. I did not know at that point that the guy was ranting about two @foxnews trump conspiracy theories: Caravan and Soros. If that lunacy inspired this, then they bear responsibility. Wait to find out.
@kaelaishere What we think doesn't matter. It is what we can prove. Based on guy's writings, there is no evidence to support that Trump fanned this flame; it was already raging hot before Trump appeared. We have to stay on the side of evidence. Someone has to in our post-reality world.

@Resister_1776 @NotreDame That is an old wives tale that came from god knows where. This is why more than a few folks with epilepsy have broken teeth.
I wrote A MIND UNRAVELED so people could know how to manage trauma. But also to point out how badly people with #epilepsy are treated. We are driven from jobs and schools. More than half of Americans say they dont want to work with us. Many believe we shouldnt marry. So we hide.
As I hear horror stories about discrimination against people with #epilepsy - things I experienced being fired on a first day of work after my seizures disclosed and thrown out of school - I want to thank @CBSNews and @nytimes for how great they were after learning of my epilepsy

@VerityPlayer @NotreDame That is how discrimination happens. People make assumptions that the experts are just another opinion and that uninformed beliefs are equally valid opinions. And people like James and me pay the consequences.
@StillUnsocial @NotreDame Neither your nor Notre dames’ beliefs of what is important matters at all. It is illegal to force people with medical conditions to face death because of “tradition” or preference. The accommodation must be so expensive to be prohibitive, or it must be done. We get educations too
@DianeSATX @NotreDame I hear VNS has good levels of success for refractory Epilepsy. Give your son my best and all best wishes.
@MaryDav54584129 @BluAngel54 @NotreDame You are my hero of the day. Thanks!
@WilliamEisley @NotreDame Not really. The problem with light is mostly from strobing. Screen blockers don't do anything about that.
@VerityPlayer @NotreDame ...or, like Notre Dame, you should make your conclusion based on what the experts say. "Risk death" is not something you ignore the doctors about.
@Look4English @NotreDame Most important things: People need to be able to have lawyers pro-bono and to file their complaint under a pseudonym. I know many people subjected to discrimination cause of #epilepsy. None of them filed, for fear disclosing their seizures would cost them jobs and education.
A @NotreDame tradition could kill a student with #epilepsy. He asked for accommodation under the ADA. Using ADA loophole, the school said the accommodation - which cost nothing and affected no one - was "an undue burden." That's how schools dodge the ADA. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
Folks reading this are saying @NotreDame should readmit James. He wants nothing to do with them. They have shown what they are. Another top school took James immediately and offered him accommodation he needed before asked. Notre Dame doesn't deserve him. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
I was thrown out of college long ago because of #epilepsy. The school has since apologized, refunded my tuition, and built a strong relationship with me. @notredame drove away a kid with epilepsy this year. Let's hope they grow a conscience.

If you agree that @NotreDame should find some decency and apologize to this boy for demanding that he risk death from his #epilepsy by honoring a school tradition or that he leave, let them know, as I have: Apologize to the kid. And next time dont be evil. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
70% of people with #epilepsy say they face stigma. 25% of Americans think they should not be allowed to marry. Half do not want to work with them. I was thrown out of school decades ago for it. Little changes: @NotreDame drove out James this year. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
A month ago, I tweeted to @NotreDame a cryptic tweet that annoyed some of my followers. I was reinforcing to them that the story they hiding was going public, and they needed to stop ignoring my requests for comment. They never replied. Here is the story: https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
I was thrown out of college decades ago because of my #epilepsy. James was forced out of @NotreDame just this year for the same reason. In this piece, I tell what happened. My school apologized decades later. Join me in telling Notre Dame to apologize NOW. https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
The neurologist told @NotreDame that following a school tradition could kill the incoming student because of his #epilepsy. The school position: "We believe you. But honor it or leave." This kind of discrimination is faced by people with epilepsy every day https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7
My latest story: This year, @NotreDame demanded that an incoming freshman with #epilepsy make a choice: risk death by honoring a meaningless tradition — or leave. They succeeded in forcing the kid out. Also thought it would stay secret. Wrong. Read it here https://t.co/M8wuL1FXA7

Given the gazillion death threats and attempts to harm me from Trump supporters, today I have had to notify people close to me not to touch any packages they don't expect.		THIS is life in Trump's America. You want to talk about "mobs" and "incivility"?? YOU cause this, GOP.
Politely asked to leave a restaurant because staff is enraged about ripping children from their parents: UNCIVIL. Trump rages 		Taking a knee: UNCIVIL. Trump rages.		Sending bombs to democrats on the GOP conspiracy theory hit list: Well, those things happen. Trump says nothing.
...sigh. One of the two just got one. Maxine Waters.		One left. Then @FoxNews and Trump can cheer themselves for inciting attempts to murder the conservative hit list.
Two more particular people need to receive a bomb, and then the entire @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump hit list of "evil democrats" will have faced an assassination attempt.		Perhaps if they had been asked to leave a restaurant Trump would personally say something.

So, let's see if I understand. Trump says there are "10 middle easterners" in migrant caravan now in Mexico. Sarah Sanders says we know they're terrorists.		So why aren't we identifying them to Mexican government? Why talk about it publicly, so "terrorists" can hide? #LousyLiars

Today's @nytimesbooks review captured the essence of my new book, A MIND UNRAVELED. It is about living a joyous life, even in the face of horrible trauma, a message i try to communicate by being  brutally honest about terrible events in my life. Read the review here: https://t.co/MKCd6zTVbd
Some people who are reading my book A MIND UNRAVELED are expressing distress at what I went through dealing with an intractable brain disorder. 		Don’t. Facing my mortality taught me to love life. Managing trauma was my secret for happiness. That is what the book is all about.
I’m again being told neckbeards, toxic gamers, white supremacists and other social misfits/basement dwellers are attacking my feed. No worries. They are being blocked before I see my feed. I don’t see these losers’ posts. Hopefully they will find a life to live off the Internet.
Living with an often incapacitating brain disorder, doctors told me “say nothing. Hide or life plans will be over” I did for years, then stopped hiding. 8 weeks later, I was thrown out of college for seizures. This is part of my story of overcoming trauma. https://t.co/S3MYhX2Ceo
Bedridden by a brain disorder and a blood disease, I was told by a doctor I could die in days. After more than a decade of battling, I survived, though the disorder is still with me. A MIND UNRAVELED is my story of falling into hell then climbing back out https://t.co/OJHEekMbPn
I didn't know they review books, but a review of my new book A MIND UNRAVELED by @arabnews: 		"Beautiful, tragic, and strong...The story of one man's battle to pursue his dreams despite an often incapacitating brain disorder."		The best reviewed book of my career. https://t.co/Y2jl1IcNj5

The idea "rogue" Saudis murdered and chopped up an American resident in the consulate without official sanction demonstrates that those saying it - Trump, GOP and Fox - either know literally NOTHING about Saudi Arabia government, or have learned that any lie is believed. Or both.

@dadofccx3 @_HARD_WIRED_13 Yah. The GIF did not play automatically, and I suspected what it was because it came from a Trump "MAGA" nut. Someone else checked it, like defusing a bomb. These types of guys are the ones who try to kill people with disabilities while proclaiming how liberals are crazy.
Hey @_HARD_WIRED_13 - here is the indictment of the last guy who did what you did. But he didn't go after a room full of people with epilepsy, in front of half the politicians in Chicago. This guy is facing 10 yrs for just me. What do you think u'll get? https://t.co/Rg65lHnqaU
@dadofccx3 @_HARD_WIRED_13 Yah, except this time the psychopath (who declares "liberals are lunatics" on his twitter page - oh the irony) struck when he knew I was at an epilepsy fundraiser. Surrounded by kids with epilepsy. And a table away from the Mayor of Chicago, members of Congress etc. He's screwed.
...another thing, @_HARD_WIRED_13: Feds gathered evidence - copying a bunch of the last guys accounts without him knowing - for 3 months. Then BOOM! Raid the house and drag the guy from Maryland to Dallas. So, in 3 months? The cops -who think you're scum- will be there to say hi.
@EXstrategy @_HARD_WIRED_13 There have been more than 150 people who have done this to me alone, even AFTER the one who succeeded in triggering a seizure was indicted and faces ten years in prison. And every one of them said MAGA or some variant on their ID page.
@wizwit101 @_HARD_WIRED_13 One other guy who already been indicted for this, and about 150 others who are in the FBI investigative file. But this new one is a peach: He tried to hurt a roomful of people with epilepsy, with the Mayor of Chicago, members of Congress, and city council sitting nearby.
Im curious for thoughts. This guy @_HARD_WIRED_13 says on his account “liberals are lunatics.” The same guy who attempts to trigger seizures at an epilepsy fundraiser by strobing. Are these people just psychopaths? Amoral? Neckbeards in a basement? Don’t care about going to jail?
@lawyit12 @_HARD_WIRED_13 I didn’t. I saw it was a gif from a trumper and handed my phone to someone else at the benefit who checked it. And rage of the crowd folllwed because this asshole tried to hurt peoples children for laughs.
By the wat @_HARD_WIRED_13 - the last guy who strobed deleted his account &amp; had multiple fronts in place to hide identity. And the FBI found him anyway, showed up at his house at 6.00 am and arrested him. And that was without Chicago city government enraged. (Check what CURE is.)
Again showing what psychopaths  MAGA types can be, a Trump maniac sent a strobe onto my phone when he saw I was at an epilepsy fundraiser. Fortunately, half of the city’s politicians were here and they want to drag this idiot @_HARD_WIRED_13 to Chicago jail. Enjoy prison, idiot.
@_HARD_WIRED_13 @nilslofgren @CureEpilepsy Congrats. The effort to track you down has begun. People much more powerful than me want to lock you up since you went after an epilepsy charity with massive governmental support. Get ready to travel to Chicago and watch your life go down the toilet. Say hi to rivello in jail.

8...can slander them after their murder because its politically convenient? I despise when people like Sean throw out absolute factual garbage, and then scream "Why isn't the media covering this?" Because it is garbage, Sean. It is you spewing ignorant crap you pull of twitter...
7...deal with and undercut potential threats, instead just sitting around so idiots who don't know how to read a book (read a BOOK for god's sake, @DonaldJTrumpJr before joining in on tearing down a dead man who has done more to protect this nation than you ever thought to do)...
6...delivered a message trying to persuade bin Laden to abandon violence as part of his strategy. Khashoggi did not see bin Laden since then. In fact, American reporters visited bin Laden after that BECAUSE HE WAS NEWSWORTHY. Are idiots of the mind that we should not try to...
5...working on behalf of the Said Royal Family, Khashoggi once again reached out to bin Laden in the early 1990s. At that point, the split between bin Laden and the Royal family was extreme. Through Khashoggi, they attempted to bring bin Laden back under control. Khashoggi also..
4. 4...resources, Khashoggi gathered information from across groups. Will @seanmdav and @DonaldJTrumpJr now start attacking EVERYONE of our intelligence assets from the 1980s? Or is it just reserved for people who have been cut to piece by Trump's friends? Next thing....
3...in the late 1980s, like any good journalist, Khashoggi saw a story in the Bin Laden fighters joining the American-supported mujahideen fighting against the Russian. At that point, he was working with both Saudi AND American intelligence. Like MANY of our human intelligence..
2...that @seanmdav feels justified in slandering the name of a brave man who has been slaughtered simply because it feeds into a poisonous GOP narrative kowtowing to the Saudis - and based on crap he found online - is beyond despicable. Now let's deal with truth...
1. Since, like a coward, @seanmdav blocks my tweet, please tweet to him. His ignorant, uneducated attack on Jamal Khashoggi is the kind of garbage the "say anything to win" crowd does. He is so uninformed that he spews lies while claiming that people are hiding the truth.... https://t.co/YQasasC5Tk
America's trade deficit has exploded following Trump's trade wars. How completely predictable, since every economist outside of the Administration screamed that this would happen. Trade wars always backfire.

@MattOrgan79 @Boudewijn1972 @MejoMelissa @Robert_Brown0 ...and why are Republican prosecutors so incompetent that they have not brought a single case against these "millions" of illegals who voted. Shouldn't you be demanding they be removed from office for covering up this massive fantasy crime?
@MattOrgan79 @Boudewijn1972 @MejoMelissa @Robert_Brown0 Like I said, anyone who isn't a conservative. I asked for specific info: Legislation, words from a credible democrats' (not just some person), or indictments. You cite people who call democrats "leftists" who offer no evidence. I am not denying there is propaganda. Show evidence.
@MattOrgan79 @Boudewijn1972 @MejoMelissa @Robert_Brown0 Name one credible person - other than a conservative - who has said they want illegal aliens to vote. Name one bill introduced in congress to help illegal aliens vote. Name 3 illegal aliens who have been charged with illegal voting. Or admit this is another GOP conspiracy theory.

@stevemur @AliceEngelmore @suzrunnr68 It's not really an outlier. It's statistical nonsense. As soon as I saw the number, I thought "small sample, single location" then downloaded the study. When i can nail the flaws before reading it, that's a bad study.		Point is, its findings are meaningless because of the flaws.
@stevemur @AliceEngelmore @suzrunnr68 This study is ridiculous. It is based on ONE small town, with very few felonies reported  (study says) over nine years. In that time, there were 45 rape reports. Thats about 5.5 per year. This has no statistical validity - controls for no variables, too small a sample.
@BonnieEisenberg It's people on the same side that are often the problem. When trying to discuss something with people making stupid points - "boys are in danger!!" - getting down to "don't tell that story, because the girl is not a demure, sexless virgin" insults women and undermines the lesson.
@BonnieEisenberg Sigh. So, I should make up an example that has nothing to do with my point to satisfy your desire to make some other point? Tweet your own examples. But if it is "sex with an incapacitated girl who expresses no interest in sex is rape" - yah, no kidding.
@BonnieEisenberg ...this is about the choices boys make. The number of times that boys say the incapacitated girl came on to them is not miniscule. But the point is - an incapacitated girl is incapacitated, and no behavior changes the fact that she cannot consent like that.
@BonnieEisenberg So...we can't show a circumstance where the woman - while incapacitated - is interested in sex? What should be the example? A rapist on the street choosing not to rape? A situation where no sexual issue is raised and the boy chooses not to rape? This goes to the nature of consent
@Boudewijn1972 @MejoMelissa @Robert_Brown0 The rest of the world has simple voter ID - not huge restrictions on what constitutes ID. We have ALWAYS had voter ID - the problem is the GOP has limited what is used for ID. And as former GOP governor revealed: Consultants urged him to do it because it blocked ppl from voting.

@AliceEngelmore That's not what this is about. This is not saying "oh, it's horrible that he is thought a rapist." Yes, crazy people think that. You don't take the extreme and say they are normal. That's like saying all Trump supporters are nazis. It's absurd.		This is about how to behave.
...by the way, he's not gay, was single. Reason not to do it: She was incapacitated and he did not trust she was making a reasoned judgment, and so was not able to give consent. Which is why she thanked him later when she was sober.
A true story of how easy it is to avoid sex assault: Frat boy sees drunk girl horribly incapacitated at party. Fearing for her well being, escorts her to her room. She throws herself at him.		He says no. "Sober up, we'll talk tomorrow." Leaves. Next day, she thanks him. The end.

@Olkoth_Awoken Wanna do Voter ID?		1. EVERYONE must obtain a specific Voter ID, in person, not driver's licenses etc.	2. Anyone going for Voter ID gets day off from work.	3. Free transit takes people for IDs.		Never happen cause it ends attempt to block voters, &amp; puts everyone in same position.
@CoolAidanJames Mmm-hmm. Where are indictments? Please stop using Veritas, which has been shown repeatedly to be a fraud that edits its videos to fool people like you.		So, where are indictments? And if they don't exist, should Republican prosecutors be thrown out for failing to find witches?
Here's what makes me sick:	Republicans: Voter fraud is rampant!!!!	Democrats: Where are the indictments?	R: Voter fraud is rampant! Chase the witches!!!	D: Here are thousands blocked from voting. Where is your evidence of actual fraud?	R: Voter fraud is rampant!!!
@Olkoth_Awoken People like you make me sick. Okay - where are the criminal cases? They have been investigating forever chasing these phantoms you guys make up. Where are they? I can cite studies of hundreds of thousands blocked from voting. Where are your criminal cases?
@Blue_Water_life Thank you for admitting they are targeting democrats.
Let me explain the fraud of throwing out registrations in Texas: If I register as "Mickey Mouse" i have to present a government issued ID at voting showing my name is Mickey Mouse. They are targeting registrations for ONE reason: To block democratic leaning cohorts from voting.
@RobertauxBruce They were filled out incorrectly based on made-up rules. 		The law says "signed." Under Texas law, electronic signatures are recognized as signatures. People with signed registrations also have to present government ID to vote. How does ANYONE commit fraud here?
The Republicans are throwing out registrations all over the country for various made-up standards that are not in law. Check your registration every day - they will not stop until election day. Here is where to check:		https://t.co/NZt5oW8HBt
...and by the way, they are rejecting electronic signatures for ONLINE registrations. Perhaps they want people to sign their screens? https://t.co/rMvxpPSKNB
@RB83313 https://t.co/rMvxpPSKNB
Here is the bottom line: Republicans fight and fight and fight to keep people from voting. As they just started to in Texas, they make up rules to throw out registrations from targeted groups. 		Check your registration, over and over, every day until election. They wont stop.
I sold my house with an electronic signature. Taxes too. And corporate contracts. 		But in Texas, GOP officials have decided - with no legal support - that such signatures for registration can't be done. They are throwing out 1000s of registrations, largely from young people.

@PissPisstie @NRO Hm..I guess your right. Nothing dumber than reading varied thoughts and opinions both to challenge/strengthen/evolve your own beliefs. Only read exactly what you know agrees with you going in, because u get constant affirmation.. You're just like a Fox News viewer.
@stmorecowbell @NRO Sigh. Okay, I take it back. Your beliefs are beyond dispute. Everything you think is perfect, reasoned, and factually backed. You have no reason to read anything that might challenge that. Anyone who contradicts you is lying. Okay? (Same as Fox news viewer attitude, btw)
No thanks, @NRO. Your pages today filled with conspiracy theories, rage and intellectually vapid arguments has created a point where, after decades as a reader, I believe your time has passed. You are just another clickbaity loony outlet. https://t.co/V8ZTtv9zrc

@stmorecowbell @NRO Anyone who thinks they have a monopoly on truth is not well educated. The only way to solidify your beliefs is to test them. Sometimes it changes your mind, sometimes it reinforces them. But only reading\/watching what you agree with is the path to an idiocracy.
@Rocky4President @AimeeDemaio @StuffedFantod Crazy (or Vladimir) gets blocked.
@PegReed57 @marstu67 So...the tweet wasn't about you. Unless you protest voted those two elections. Then it is about you.
@CHHolte Yes, if things were different they wouldn't be the same. And no one can "force" anything, particularly when there is a huge portion of one party that no one can take seriously as having their representatives' backs.
@Chris4943 @NRO That's what I thought, but I haven't read Commentary for years. Is it still thoughtful? Or is it just rage-bait where, if parties were reversed, it would be saying the exact opposite?
Now that @NRO has finished devolving into clickbait conspiracy theory/rage side of conservatism (for money no doubt) which periodical remains  un-foxified to give info on conservative intellectual thought? Real answers only please. Want to find new one to read.
...my background with @NRO - Ive been reading it since 1984, probably longer than a lot of its writers have been alive. So I know what it was. And I can tell what it is. And those have nothing to do with each other. Despite it's pre-election attack on Trumpism, it joined the fold
@Barraman4evr @NRO Not only do I read it, I am a subscriber to their daily email/week in review. And @NRO - feel free to tell them if I'm lying. Look me up in your database.
12...part of the conservative scream/conspiracy bubble. If William F. Buckley Jr. saw the horror show his magazine has become, how it appeals to the worst of our souls, he would have been appalled. So, @NRO - take Buckley's name out of your history. You arent what he founded.

@WhoIsDTJackson ...the problem with the protest voters is they have no idea, no understanding, that if you try for everything at once, you get nothing. Except in massive, nationwide crises, huge change in one go never happens. So they do not vote to make progress towards their goal. Instead....
@WhoIsDTJackson Sigh. This is such a tiresome refrain. Reality:	Single payer was very unlikely. Now, no doubt - it will never happen. Because this: It presents massive constitutional issues re: government role in private contracts. And now SCOTUS is full of justices who will side with insurers.
@AimeeDemaio @StuffedFantod Okay, so the answers are:	1. "I didn't like the person who got the most votes for the nomination, and i didn't care who won." That's fine - but then they can have no objection to Trump, because they didn't care.	2. Don't care	3. Too busy	...add "forgot" and that's 55%.
@WhoIsDTJackson ...um, and if you took all the people who "protest voted" and had them take their vote seriously as an expression of which of two directions did they want government to go, they both would have won electoral college. And with Gore, SCOTUS ruled. That ended it under Constitution.
@truth_trumpet No, it probably wont. There are many many Democrats up for reelection, and very few Republicans. Chances of a senate turnover are slim. House turnover are high.
With Trump in office, been waiting for Mitch McConnell to revise the “no confirmation in year before prez  election” trope he used against Garland. On fox, He said it applies when senate different party than president. No need to rage bout his hypocrisy - like saying “fish swim.”
@goodgirlcrystal @astroeric12 The candidates who run are people who choose to run. The ones who win the nomination are the ones who get the most votes. 		Get off your high hors and face it - your attitude is built in narcissism, self righteousness, and ignorance.
@StuffedFantod ...and I’m sure they all took the time to play video games and watch Netflix. 		But they couldn’t find the Tim to vote because, ya know, what-EVAH. 		But they will be out there protesting for attention, while ignoring the only thing they can do that’s effective.
@StuffedFantod I have no disappointment or anger. I have nothing against people who voted for Trump because they wanted him to win. I have enormous disgust with people who are such narcissists that they "protest" as if anyone cares about their "message," then complain about the outcome.
It is disgusting that @KrisKobach1787 demeans the victims of 9/11 by lying (or being too stupid to look up the truth) for political points. According to 9/11 commission, only 2 of the 19 hijackers overstayed their visas. Neither was stopped for a ticket. https://t.co/ABk1rpS8ZN
Just a note to remember:		If all Democratic protest voters had instead voted for the person who could win in both 2000 and 2016, the Supreme Court would currently have a 7-2 split with seven justices named by democratic presidents. The Voting Rights Act would still be in force.
@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC Yah, sorry you got caught up in that. Andre announcing on national television that he would think his daughter was mistaken if she said she was raped and it didn't line up with his Inspector Clouseau standards just infuriated me. That girl is destined to hate her father.
@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC Sorry....I wasn't speaking to you. I was speaking to Andre, who said he wouldn't believe his own daughter if she said was raped &amp; other people identified as being there - and potentially breaking the law - said they didnt remember.

@AndreBauerSC @SteveGoldstein1 ....the exact opposite? Absolutely. I would not. Allegations of sexual assault - told by someone months and years before a nomination - are not a "political trick."

After raging that anyone would EVER investigate allegations of assault raised against SCOTUS nominee long before the nomination - the House is going back to investigating the investigation of an investigation based on a 6-yr old investigation of a Dem not in office for 5 years.
@EXstrategy @LindseyGrahamSC So, you believe that investigating claims of sexual assault by a supreme court nominee - claims made months and years before he was nominated - is partisanship?		Would you say the same if the accused was a dem? Because my position would not change.

@SteveGoldstein1 @Kennedysccamp @AndreBauerSC So. your position is that if someone writes in with a credible allegation that a nominee for the Supreme Court committed a crime, it should be ignored?

@Bookwormroom ...victims were told very very very clearly - if it's inconvenient for us, please shut up. 		Democrats are accused and resign amid GOP cheering and dems nodding their heads.	GOPrs are accused and GOP rages, impedes investigations.		This is not caring about facts.

@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC "WE" have nothing. YOU have information spewed by conservative politicsns and media outlets trying to lead you to conclude you know something about the facts.		I dont know what anyone said. I know names of the many many people who were not interviewed because of restrictions.
@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC There is tons of corroboration. What you are saying is that you don't see confirmation. And - absent video tape, DNA or confession (and even sometimes not them) - sexual assaults almost never have confirmation. They have corroboration.
@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC ...have a credible conclusion. You don't care about how it sells on television, or whether people can trot out talking points that an investigation unlike any in history is okay. You do it the way the agents are trained to do it, then reach a conclusion.
@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC ...she offered up to discuss, you do NOT refuse to speak to people calling your office with information, you do NOT ignore the sworn affidavits of people who sent them in because you were ordered not to interview them.

@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC In any investigation, you start off believing the victim. You first go out to examine corrupt motivation - in other words, if she said nothing about this until the day Kavanaugh was nominated. The evidence is opposite and shows she has talked about this long before....
@LindseyGrahamSC Sir...this is neither "winning" nor "victory" nor a "defeat."		This is Senate executing its Constitutional authority. It is supposed to be non-partisan. By making this pure partisanship, youve torn USA apart and forever undermined the credibility of SCOTUS, regardless of reality.
RT @smotus: No matter which way you wanted the #Kavanaugh vote to go, this was not a fight the nation needed to have, and it’s done damage…
@KanehBisRex ...so yah, I don't think Kavanaugh is going to be a rubber stamp. However, he does have significantly stronger belief in corporate rights than many judges. And why do you think the folks who depend on millions in corporate $ fought so hard to put him in? Thats all this was about.
@KanehBisRex Ok, so where do you get your flawed opinion about what Kavanaugh is in terms as a judge? I base my thoughts on his actual decisions. He is NOT Alito, who is the worst justice in history. NOT based on outcomes, but on his manipulated written decisions.
@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC ...ah hell, here is a mass link. Many many studies. https://t.co/MnDiyTGXLs
@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC So tell me: What have you read on memory that leads you to the conclusion:	1. People remember "time place" etc details of a traumatic event?	2. Others who did not experience the trauma would remember surrounding circumstances decades later?		Im happy to link to studies on this.
@KanehBisRex You said Kavanaugh was in judiciary for decades. He has not been. You dont even know how long he has been a judge. So yah, you know nothing. It's all "own the libs!!!!"		Get ready to be disappointed by him - read decisions, dont just watch Fox.
@SteveGoldstein1 @AndreBauerSC Perhaps you should interview victims of crimes and what they remember before going online and proclaiming how easily you would turn against your son. Knowledge is power...ignorance is twitter.
@KanehBisRex ...IOW, other than the corporate side of things, in which he does side with companies over people very often, he is not a lock for what you want to believe. all that was needed for the case to be well investigated - as both you and i wouldve wanted if he was nominated by a dem.
@KanehBisRex What you don't know about Kavanaugh because this is a game to you: In Seven-Sky v. Holder, he rejected case attacking Obamacare and set the groundwork for how Roberts court upheld it. He has argued that precedent is grounded in Constitution, and that a reversal cant just be 5-4..
@KanehBisRex ...and wait, all these decades? You don't even know BASIC information about Kavanaugh. This is all just a frigging game to you - "own the libs!!!"		Policy and law is not a competition. If you cant be bothered to read a damn thing, get out of the discussion.
@KanehBisRex So, you think she was sending out texts and emails and letters and talking to her husband and friends and psychiatrists not only about Kavanaugh days, months and years before his nomination, but also about every other possible nominee? Or did Fox not tell you about that?
@KanehBisRex ...here is the bottom line: I don't know what happened. I am intellectually honest enough to admit that. You are not.		I know how FBI investigations work - I have written about them for decades and been part of 2 of them. THIS is not an FBI investigation.
@KanehBisRex ....affidavits to the FBI when the FBI refused to speak with them? Why are there text messages of her identifying Kavanaugh as her assailant before there was even a nominee? Why did she notify Congress before Kavanaugh was selected? Why did she tell people years ago?
@KanehBisRex I am engaging in this conversation because it is fascinating to see someone recite "facts" that are completely false. Other than hearing this through propaganda, how do you know any of this? Are all the shout-out witnesses lying? Why did they have to send in their own....
@KanehBisRex Watch something other than Fox.Background checks are not "interview everyone he has ever known." There was no attempt to check this be4 because no one knew about it. 		Real investigations require interviewing complainant and accused. And all witnesses identified. Never happened.
@KanehBisRex ...and by the way, I have read many Kavanaugh rulings, which is why I think a lot of people are overreacting both ways. He is not a rubber stamp, which one side wants and the other fears. He is not Alito. You will be disappointed in him. 		But this deserved real investigation.
@KanehBisRex Name a Kavanaugh ruling and why you agree with it. Don't look it up. The reason I ask: It's "enjoyable" - this isn't "stick it to the libs" That behavior is infantile. Nor do I doubt Kavanaugh is qualified. 		BUT when accused of a serious crime, it must be investigated seriously.
Let's make this clear: If you impose the criminal law standard (innocent til proven guilty) then you must have an investigation with the scope, length and authority of a criminal investigation.		This is why civil cases have lower standards of proof and job interviews lower still.

So, @AndreBauerSC - are there any other crimes you would say your daughter is "confused" about if other people potentially implicated in a crime said they didn't remember, or is it only rape?		Seriously, this is the most horrific thing said by a politician this year.
@antoniodjtone @AndreBauerSC ....so....he'll never regret it?
@AndreBauerSC You said youd think your daughter didn't understand what happened if she said she was raped, and others said they didn't remember what happened. Loving dad - speculating on national TV about your child's sexual assault, &amp; announcing terms under which you'd consider believing her.
Winner of the today's worst human being in the world, and likely headed for a nasty confrontation with his daughter when she grows up and learned he said this on national television: @AndreBauerSC 		https://t.co/28mIXwQenN
Some of Collins's statement is fine. Then she talks about Ford. Horrible. She discusses people not phoning FBI -as opposed to FBI being allowed to conduct unfettered inquiry - then puts on her Inspector Clouseau hat 2 suggest Ford might be lying since particular people didnt call https://t.co/QgZUGT9GvU
@johnstodder @julieowagner Nope. Not at all.
@darryn_briggs I don't get why this is hard to understand.		This has nothing to do with politics. It is about victims of a horrible crime. Nothing is changing that Kavanaugh is confirmed. But maybe by shoving people's faces into their own hypocrisy on sex assault, they might learn what matters.
@RegulatoryHell Apparently, I know case facts and you don't. She told a private investigator who was secretly recording her that it was horrible, but if they subpoenaed she would lie. They subpoenaed, she filed an affidavit saying it never happened, then recanted. She has 5 shout out witnesses.
@dcinsb @celtic_traveler What you are saying is a total fiction. Her claims were not investigated by Ken Starr. Not at all. She gave an affidavit in the Paula Jones case, saying it was not true. Then she recanted her affidavit. No further investigations occurred. But she had 5 shout-out witnesses.
@RegulatoryHell Ok...so, this change anything? She told a private investigator who was secretly recording "it was just a horrible horrible thing," that she "wouldn't relive it for anything" and then said if she was subpoenaed, she'd deny because she considered him too powerful. Which she did.
@celtic_traveler Im trying to use this as a teaching moment. Broaddrick had exactly what Ford did: Shout out witnesses, and other evidence. But look at how angry dems are getting for my bringing this up.		Point is: ALL of us dismiss victims without even trying to hear them first.
@DuedoOliver THANK you. Not many people are getting the point.
@mizmaimee Nope. Didnt investigate it. Broadrrick wouldn't cooperate.
@colleenschlegel You are reaching for an easy dismissal based on information that doesn't rise above impressionistic. You are doing exactly what GOP doing now. 		I'm trying to strip politics out and show how our behavior empowers the powerful to abuse, because we don't believe "our side" does it.
@julieowagner Your evolution is a sign or great integrity and true concern for the harmed. 		Unfortunately, not a lot of folks show that anymore.
@Thano Good dodge. 		Answer the question. Do you believe accusers's claims should be respectfully and fully investigated, or not? Regardless of political party?
@_Chris_Shepherd You seriously have to get your news from someplace other than sites that you know will feed back what you want to hear. They did not interview the alleged victim, her shout out witnesses, the alleged perpetrator and 20 others. Because White House said no.
@_Chris_Shepherd ...those came out after the first three came out and were investigated. Did you say "Well, let's wait until we have a whole slew of them first, and ignore these first few." 		I dont get why ANYONE would fight investigating. GOP STILL would have gotten a Trump nominee.
@LostAmerican76 I want to ask a question. Neither you nor I know what happened with Ford. We know she told others long before he was nominated. We know she warned in July.		So, should no one have raised it? Should no one have investigated? Even if it was all true? Because neither of us knows.
@_Chris_Shepherd Like what? The only evidence they had is the years-old shout-out to others. The same evidence Ford had.
@_dziga_ So, what us your solution? Saying F*** YOU to people who believe just as strongly as you?		This isn't about who is right and who is wrong. This is about pointing out, if no solution is found to the hatred, we are done as a nation.
@JessePariseau I agree.
@IUseVATSTooMuch Tell me how we pull out of this death spiral if two halves of America hating each other doesnt stop. Do you think one side that hates the other will listen to what the other has to say?
@SerenityFoods Oh, pish - I've been threatened with being murdered so many times since I started covering Trump in 2016 that now it's like having orange juice. A day without death threats is like a day without sunshine.

@StanHansen It's easy to investigate, Mr. "No Crimes Can Be Solved." I can identify who was probably there. That will ultimately lead to the person who had the party. Anyone found to have been there can recount what they saw.		You really think cops and the FBI cant do anything?
@StanHansen Home town. No idea how I got there. No idea how I got home. I can guess who was there. And I don't know what anyone else would remember.		Welcome to the real world.

This is the kind of basic lack of business knowledge of Trump that made financial reporters roll their eyes in 80s-90s. "The time value of money" is about potential of investment returns over time.

@David_Quinones @JonGabrielB No one can be this uninformed. You may as well say "watching really good movies will decrease federal debt." Everything you have cited has nothing to do with levels of debt. Or is a political fantasy.
@notatechproblem No. It is just stupid, stupid people who are consumed by "I want I want" mindset who can't see the long term impact. Greed will be what kills us.
@JonGabrielB @David_Quinones Irrelevant. This is NOT about cost compared to cost. It is about government cost v. cost. We're drowning in debt, &amp; the interest on debt is exploding. Once we hit the fast interest cycle - *even if universal adds nothing to debt* -  most programs on budget will be crowded out.
@PhoenixArielle @4everNeverTrump Accept that we brought this on ourselves. The financial fantasies on both sides, the refusals to vote, allowing politicians to drive us off a cliff. It's all on us.
@SkyMogul72 So? You think American financial institutions - which own most of this debt - are going to say "Oh, don't worry, USA...don't pay us our interest. We will just smile." No...the entire financial system, which is largely built on Treasuries, will collapse.
@zampella @MARYANNBROWNMFT It's too late. The numbers simply do not work anymore. A few years ago, maybe. People dont take into account the full cost - including such items as the $4 trillion in investments held by health insurance companies that use returns to offset losses. Debt on interest kills us.
@David_Quinones This has to be a joke. Or skilled trolling.
