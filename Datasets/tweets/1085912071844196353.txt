@lilbulli1031 @SweetKat111 @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi are you on some kind of bad medication?  You can't complete sentences and you're constantly losing your train of thought.  Listening to you is like a kaleidoscope of nonsensical words smashed together with no direction.  Time to retire much? smh
I love we they try and act normal ü§£ it is so awkward!  	#DerangedLeft #SocialMisfits All we need is #HeelsUpHarris and we've got a three of a kind.  Dolts! https://t.co/g19eLkEl9d

This is not the first time Cuomo has rebuked Pelosi over the wall and her refusal to strike any meaningful deal with Trump over border barriers.	Chris Cuomo discusses wall with Don Lemon, criticizes Dems for their role https://t.co/B8dUfGZBqs via @YouTube #MAGA #BuildTheWall
@John_R_Berna @KamalaHarris To be clear this has nothing to do with race. We don't care if you're purple, just come into the country legally. Go through the vetting process, prove you're a productive applicant that want's to assimilate to American culture &amp; you do not have a criminal background or agenda.
@PolishPatriotTM @SeidkonaM @realDonaldTrump He tells it like it is.  This is another reason they hate him, he exposes their misleading bullshit! A politician that can't lie and mislead is DOA. #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp
@RealJamesWoods Or in Spanish "SANCHA"
So true! @MeryRobins https://t.co/F4iUdT6d4f
@GOPLeader -  Why do Dems not care about this, not one of them openly object?  More, importantly why are our Republican leaders not speaking out for American lives! @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP #RuleOfLaw #SaveAmerica @POTUS @PressSec https://t.co/taIEgpCwnG

@seanhannity "Moderate reforms" doesn't she mean; we'll get there, but we need to slow down the death of health care in America for now? 	#MAGA @FoxNews https://t.co/vWgDoLMIF6
@ChuckCallesto Just another step in their plan to undermine America and American Values.	1. Create a gender war = Toxic Masculinity 	2. Remove God from America	3. Tear down the Constitutions one Amendment at a time	4. Open Border	5. Globalism		Stop the madness! @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @POTUS
When will the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP do their job and start raising issue with this rampant anti American left! We're heading down the path of socialism and you all are either incompetent or complicit! STAND UP FOR AMERICA &amp; DEMOCRACY #MAGA @POTUS @IngrahamAngle @RealJamesWoods

@RandPaul #MAGA KY Senator Rand Paul and a partner teamed up to do pro bono eye surgeries for the poor on summer break. Do you ever Wonder why the media isn't interested in this huge American patriot story? Guess it doesn't fit the image they try to create for conservatives. https://t.co/836zPH5vxh
Corrupt Dems openly lie! What are our Republican politicians doing to stop it?  Acknowledgement is step #1, Step #2 is stopping it! Step #3 see step #2 https://t.co/C6fXWnO9Cs
@maga_joey @AOC And now deep thoughts by @AOC.....  	It's like listening to a 5 year old tell you how smart they are.. Does she hear herself?  LOL I'm telling you she is pure gold!
We are in for the fight of our lives in 2020 folks. If the Dems gain the Presidency they will move quickly to continue to tear down America. Their #1 goal is Globalism! To make America just another country.  Do you think China will go Global?! That answer is NO! Let that sink in.
@LaBagporte @John_R_Berna @AOC168 Agree 100%. Who knew a rational dem still exists!?
@BreitbartNews Be carful Chuckles!!  POTUS always has a plan to keep America safe regardless of your hate for us!!!

RT @heyitsCarolyn: I have a feeling that the Supreme Court is RUTHLESS... 		Just curious as to why Fox News would actually show on air a im‚Ä¶
@BreitbartNews Why do we pay credence to this lunatic? She‚Äôs obviously suffering from some kind of mental disorder that is under medicated.  Sad yes, but we all need to get her help not validate her lunacy.
Funny because it‚Äôs FUNNY! https://t.co/LLPbVKmV1B
If Hollywood wants to continue to be the anti-America why do we Americans continue to buy tickets?
@Alyssa_Milano after 9/11 we were told to be tolerant about the hijab. That not everybody was evil what‚Äôs different about the MAGA hat?  #MAGA #GodBlessAmerica
@Alyssa_Milano where is your tolerance. After 9/11 we were all told that not everybody wearing a hijab was evil. So a MAGA hat is different?
@JackPosobiec Wait a few minutes we'll have more choices!
How many remember 9/11 &amp; when ISIS was in it's prime? When America &amp; the World were growing fearful of anyone in a hijab? Didn't the MSM shame us all for "Profiling" Muslims? Weren't we all told "Just because a person wears a hijab doesn't make them evil" Just a thought #MAGA https://t.co/KKixRKgmsn

@SaraCarterDC Remember the left do not care who they hurt as long as Trump is hurt too.
@SaraCarterDC Someone has to give in here. I think POTUS should make a statement favoring himself as the "Adult" in the room and open the government. The left will claim victory of the battle, but the right will ultimately win the war.  Securing our border will happen. #SecureOurBorder @POTUS
Perfection! https://t.co/gpMiLhT28O
@KristySwansonXO @realDonaldTrump I like it...But isn't that called taxes? The proceeds of my citizenshipü§£ü§£ü§£
There are none so intolerant as those who preach tolerance to all the rest of us. There are none so quick to judge as those who tell us to be non-judgmental
@kimguilfoyle @DailyCaller Come on @kimguilfoyle don't parrot MSM naritives...it's not Trumps wall...It's America's Wall! Trump is just our champion in this endeavor.  #BuildTheWall #MAGA #GodBlessAmerica
@MattBevin This was the best quote I've seen in quite some time: ‚ÄúThere are none so intolerant as those who preach tolerance to all the rest of us. There are none so quick to judge as those who tell us to be non-judgmental‚Äù  Well said sir! #GodBlessAmerica
@RealSaavedra Ryan she is pure gold. Every time she opens her mouths she exposes so much..  number one being our schools need a major upgrade.

@DailyCaller @ADL_National Shouldn't there be some level of expectation, or even confirmation that you intend on supporting American ideas and the American way of life before being allowed to be part of it's government? #GodBlessAmerica #MAGA #StoptheMadness
@BFT_Podcast Doesn't Hollywood have a large Jewish presence?  Where's the outrage? Where's the "F" Omar? It's hard to take anyone seriously anymore. Hey Hollywood stick to dancing and singing please, go back to entertainment, you're lousy at politics.  #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
@DailyCaller Why are tax payers paying for her to go to the West Bank?  Shouldn't her focus be on on the 13th District of Michigan? Let me ask this: What was her first act as a Congress woman for Michigan, book a flight to the West Bank? #MAGA #GodBlessAmerica #AmericaFirst
