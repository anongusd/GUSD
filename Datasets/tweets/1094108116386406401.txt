Notice how quickly the candidates are shifting their doublespeak and shills are recreating narrative. All #ADOS and #BlackVotes must realize that our votes are worth more to the #DNC in the 2020 election than EVER. WITHHOLD and they will KNOW what our vote costs. #blackboylogic

@Schiffon @princss6 @DrJillStein @DemSocialists @GPUSyouth What advances have been made? H1Bs stealing our high end jobs. Legal/Illegals stealing construction and trade jobs. Overseas immigrants securing business and school loans/grants. We are still the permanent underclass. What social program is DNC or Green offering to remedy this?
@Schiffon @princss6 @DrJillStein @DemSocialists @GPUSyouth That the point. There's been NO advance. Shuffling parties has made them used to offering the MINIMUM it would take to make you jump parties. Now even the party that pretended it wanted you the most is offering 'rising tide' policies that are no better than green party offerings.
@Schiffon @princss6 @DrJillStein The strategy is to HOLD your vote and NOT just give it to the 'next best thing' or 'lesser of two evils.' Withholding your vote shows ALL parties the power of our votes when we are ready to use them.  We number in the 10s of MILLIONS.

@TezlynFigaro @ProudMisisipian At this point if you try and pretend that you weren't trying to imply that #Kaep sold out you'll just come off a bit douchey.  Logic would suggest you dont try it.		And oh yeah...  #ADOS
@TezlynFigaro @ProudMisisipian You went from "speech on the issue" to "speaking on justice" and now you want to pretend you were talking about "speak on the NFL."  Nice try but I haven't hit the bong hard enough yet.  #ThanksForPlaying #blackboylogic
Problems with @NAACP and the like is actually rooted in the fundamentals of capitalism. These orgs simply have no competition. Operating as monopolies, they have NO INCENTIVE in competing/performing for our support. That works awesome whey they are infiltrated and bought. #ADOS
@IndyMama8 @ProudMisisipian @OfficialCBC is a joke. @NAACP is a joke. @BET is a joke. These institutions (and others) have been on the #DNC dole for decades. THIS is why no progress has been made in decades. Its not that we're not organized. Its that the opposition has paid and infiltrated our organizations
@craziforlife Because gang, gang.  ...kidding.		Who tf knows?  The point is...  he's probably not the one. #KIM #blackboylogic
@TezlynFigaro @ProudMisisipian It's actually a silly question. The confidentiality is with respect to the *agreement* itself. It only takes two brain cells to process this. Obviously the 2nd Amendment is in full effect and #Kaep can speak on #COPMURDERS if he wants to.

@Eedwardsellis Because 40 acres and a mule were promised to the slaves HERE. #ADOS seeks what our ancestors are OWED. Immigrants that came here after Jim Crowe are people of MEANS with no claim to our struggle. Yet they go to our colleges, use our grants/scholarships. Now want our #Reparations

@Amazon_Queenn peace to you my sister.
@Amazon_Queenn wanting change without wanting people to change is the antithesis of logic.  the movement is about changing status quo.  boyce is the first casualty.
@Amazon_Queenn no need to block you.  i understand your position and simply disagree.  as far as ‘injection’ all is needed are his hash tags and followers.  if he keeps directing them this way, what is the harm?  we need numbers.  not petty arguments fought out in these twitter streets.
@Amazon_Queenn should the movement come first?  can tone and yvette alone defeat the media shills that have 1000x their platform?
@Amazon_Queenn they had philosophical differences on where our people should go that was rooted in their failed business relationship. watched it go down in realtime.  logic falls on yvettes side of what went down. no question. also no question to the pettiness then.  ...and whos grown from it.
@Amazon_Queenn the movement needs as many people as it can get and boyce has at least 5x tones and yvettes numbers combined.  he could literally hijack the movement if he wanted to and has offered support.
@Amazon_Queenn logic would suggest that yvette is acting petty on the subject and wrong.  1) he is ADOS 2) he supports it now. Far different than whats happening with @DNC. They are running an active campaign against the movement and have phalanx of media shills and a war chest backing them.
