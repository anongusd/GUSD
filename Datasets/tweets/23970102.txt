Michael Cohen feels betrayed and wants vengeance. That’s what Congress is getting. Hopefully, Americans understand what’s going on here.
https://t.co/t0XTzVHt0g
It is not my job to defend Donald Trump or any other public official unless I know the absolute truth in the face of a falsehood. And in the case of Michael Cohen, I do.
We get it, Cohen hates Trump. But to say under oath that the President wanted to run for his brand not the national good is absurd. Over the years, I’ve had many conversations with Donald Trump about policy? Iraq? His brand?
I believe that backlash against lunatics on the far-left is coming.  I fervently hope it is.	            	America remains a great country.  Good people must keep it that way.

The corporate culture in massive media operations is always politically correct and most often liberal politically, with a few exceptions like the 89 year old Rupert Murdoch.  With so few controlling news messaging, it is not difficult to form a political bloc.

When Donald Trump leaves the national stage, all three cable news operations will likely decline in a major way.  Covering the news fairly and accurately is difficult.  Today, cable news doesn’t even try.		https://t.co/NvwobVqYVY
All three cable networks basically stopped covering the news, devoting most of their presentations to Trump.  Unending Trump. 		Always Trump.		Many viewers became exhausted-- https://t.co/NvwobVIAky

People like calm. Donald Trump is not a calm guy. His opponents including the press are trying to exploit that.  The actual worthiness of the wall is not even on their agenda.  It’s all a political show.	https://t.co/LWNXUwzb27
President Trump helped his case with the national TV address.  However, this is a long game for the democrats.  They want to create chaos in the federal government with the hope that Americans will become exhausted and oppose the President’s reelection.  		That’s the strategy.

Want to see anti-wall arguments demolished?  Check out the @NoSpinNews on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
I believe most Americans want border security and would support a wall. But the relentless media opposition to the wall blunts the voices of the folks.  Democrats know the press is providing them cover and seek to oppose Mr. Trump hoping to embarrass him.
There is a crisis at the southern border.  Millions of people have illegally crossed into America over the years, and millions of tons of hard drugs arrived here by being hauled across the border.

I’m exhausted after that wall thing. Corgi shutdown. https://t.co/nLsL4HRJPn
Nancy Pelosi &amp; Chuck Schumer use their seven minutes to appeal for an end to the government shutdown. They offer no solutions to border chaos &amp; both agree that President Trump has “manufactured” the border situation into a crisis.  Not a strong presentation in my opinion.
Speaking a little too fast, President Trump made his case that Americans need to be protected from people smugglers and drug importation at the southern border.  The problem is real and I saw no misinformation in the President’s presentation.
Nice to see Ted Koppel say the networks should carry President Trump’s border address tonight.  The hard left press objects to it.  Ted understands Americans are best served hearing from the President directly.
Anyone who brands someone racist for supporting a border wall is a dishonest extremist.  The tactics of demonization should be condemned by all fair-minded Americans.  Policy disagreements can make free societies stronger.  Peddling hatred weakens the country.
The leftist mantra presently is that a border wall is racist and that’s all there is to it.  Never mind the vast quantities of hard narcotics that are smuggled across the border and forget about the millions of people who have sneaked into the USA.  		Not factors.

The “hate Trump” press, which is most of it, knows blood has been drawn and can be counted on to keep up the “smear du jour” with the intent of getting Trump deposed.  There is no seeking the truth involved here.  		Corporate decisions have been made:  Trump has to go.

The policy of keeping peace in Syria should be assumed by the United Nations.  But that won’t happen.  So President Trump is pulling troops back because he doesn’t like to deploy American soldiers on foreign soil.  He’s made that quite clear in the past.
The media’s negative reaction to the Syria announcement is kind of strange because it supported President Obama’s policy of letting ISIS run wild. Correct me if I’m wrong but I did not hear media cries for American forces on the ground to crush the terror group back then.

The ongoing battle between the national press and President Trump will not have a happy ending for the country.  Already, the annual White House Christmas party for the media is in doubt, and the Washington Correspondents dinner is a shadow of what it used to be.

It is almost beyond comprehension that the Democratic Party basically supports open borders and is fine with providing welfare payments to millions of undocumented aliens when the country is $22 trillion in debt.

Americans, even those who despise Mr. Trump, understand the media has sold itself to the devil, have largely stopped informing the folks.  The national press has become a weapon of mass destruction.	 	And Americans know it--https://t.co/hZst1pGaRo
When Mr. Trump leaves the stage, watch what happens to network and cable news.  He’s the entire industry now.  Without him, there’s nothing.
At this point much of cable news is boring and predictable.  There’s little perspective in reporting about the President and hate on display is tedious.  I have tuned out.

Today is the Eve of all Hallows and many spooky things are happening in America. Here’s a partial list--https://t.co/5OPWHEIgsJ
The fix was in the moment President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.  The media chieftains and their corporate masters immediately launched a guerrilla campaign to bring down the Trump administration.  	 	And that’s what we are seeing play out.
The cold truth is that the vast majority of the American press is fighting a guerrilla war against the President, hoping to wear him out &amp; turn public opinion against him. In turn, Trump counter attacks &amp; creates ill will toward the press by disparaging his constant critics.
Read almost any newspaper or watch network or most cable news &amp; you will absorb negative stories about the Trump administration ad Infinitum. The latest being the President is partially responsible for the terror bombs and the Synagogue massacre because of his persona &amp; rhetoric.
During the Vietnam War, the Viet Cong communists were expert at disrupting the South Vietnamese infrastructure.  That eroded the people’s confidence in the Saigon regime and drastically weakened it.		The same thing is happening today in America.
President Trump continues to say that some members of the press are enemies of the people.  But it’s far more than that.  Please check out the Message of the Day on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.		https://t.co/8yoIuKbA96
Politics in America have never been more poisonous.  Tonight on the @NoSpinNews we’ll continue our honest analysis of the recent terrorism, the migrant caravan, and the upcoming election.  		Important show this evening.
It is literally horrifying for me to hear charges of mass anti-Semitism made for political reasons.  I worked on my new book Killing the SS for a year so I understand what true anti-Semitism is. To diminish this evil by applying it dishonestly for political gain is barbaric.

Don’t count on the corrupt American media to uncover the money behind the caravan just as the press ignored the presence of far left zealots in the Kavanaugh controversy.
The plan seems to be to goad President Trump into doing something that will mobilize young liberals and Hispanics to vote for Democrats in the midterms. 		https://t.co/9XVZzcgdom
Earlier this year, the migrant child separation deal on the border worked well for the left as President Trump had to change his immigration policy because “babies were being ripped from their mothers.”
CBS glorifies George Soros who was a bomb target.  I have to correct the record on Soros and will do so on the @NoSpinNews tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
In August, the activist group Pueblo Sin Fronteras put the word out on social media that asylum could be obtained in America if certain directions were followed. Thus, the planned mass journey began to take shape.

The Judiciary Committee is pursuing this story. It has asked Ford’s lawyers to turn over relevant correspondence on the matter.
This might spell big trouble for Dr. Ford and her lawyers. https://t.co/EtwwLFkwkT
With the Senate voting to put Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination on the floor tomorrow, the country will likely have a new Supreme Court Justice by Sunday.
According to the leftwing mob, all “survivors,” “victims,” or whatever other label is used, must be believed, no matter if the allegations are denied.  		And if you don’t immediately believe the accuser, then you are an abuser. 		https://t.co/WpZjkvyMSA

Think about this: no matter what the @FBI report says, a significant number of Americans have convicted Brett Kavanaugh of heinous crimes in their minds. The implication of that is staggering. Please read my new column and Message of the Day on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
If the FBI report does not implicate Kavanaugh in wrongdoing, the majority of Americans will support him, according to @NPR poll questions already published.
Many Americans like me are furious that Kavanaugh is being denied due process by the left.  Morons like Senator Richard Blumenthal loudly bellow that they believe the accuser.  	 	Based on what? 		https://t.co/WpZjkvyMSA
Enter polling about Brett Kavanaugh... https://t.co/0RzN4mvai7

Was it wise for President Trump to disparage Christine Ford? Please read the Message of the Day on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
Americans are deeply divided on the Kavanaugh case so opinions really don’t get us anywhere as a country. This should be a fact-based situation and the FBI will deliver those facts very shortly. 		https://t.co/CEd4W3ZRgb
So everyone should button it until the FBI weighs in.  Or am I wrong? https://t.co/mGqGEXNYOF
Although many people do not believe Christine Ford’s allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, it would be wise for the President and other elected officials to avoid comment on her testimony. FBI should be the final word.

It would be foolish to decide a vital issue based on emotion. All I can say with certainty is that the Judge would never be convicted in a court of law based upon how the facts line up right now.
The prediction here is that Judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court next week.  We’ve posted the facts on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.  Hope you check it out.
The latest to emerge from the busy left wing propaganda machine is that Judge Brett Kavanaugh is essentially seeking a job and therefore his fate should depend on a perception of him rather than affording the man the fairness of due process.		Pretty slick. https://t.co/r6HJQKGALy

While writing my upcoming book Killing the SS: The Hunt for the Worst War Criminals in History,” I kept coming back to a simple question: how could the German people have allowed the brutal Nazi Party to seize power?
My feeling is that Judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed.  What is harder to ascertain is how the American people will process this entire movement that uses allegations as facts. Will people who deny due process finally be called out?

Tonight on the @NoSpinNews, we will take a hard look at the midterm election situation that could alter this country forever.
There are only two possibilities in the accusation against Judge Kavanaugh: that something untoward happened 35 years ago, or this is one of the most vicious setups in American history. https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C is compiling the evidence. We seek the truth.
The radical left is demanding that federal law not be enforced and that ICE be abolished.  They oppose a border wall and believe all asylum seekers should immediately gain entry to the country.

President Trump would be wise to put emotion aside for the next two months and concentrate on accomplishments rather than feuds.  He should have a new Supreme Court Justice, and a booming economy to bolster him.
Realistically, a robust economy is about the only thing that could crack the blue wave.  Remember, the Obama administration got crushed in its first mid-term election despite a fawning press trying to help Mr. Obama.
The media-blue wave fascination is basically a wish-fulfillment thing, that is the liberal press desperately wants President Trump’s power diminished and, ultimately, that he be driven from office.		https://t.co/ip0cWCsLPx

Scores of cities actually harbor aliens who have committed serious crimes after entering the USA illegally.  This is absolute madness and Kate Steinle is dead because of that.
Mollie Tibbetts would be alive today if America enforced federal immigration law.
President Trump would be wise to reform immigration law in a disciplined way.  Long overdue, and might help him rally support for his administration.  	    	He should start with reviving Kate’s Law.

Well, I tried. Very hard. But I failed. I simply could not watch more than ten minutes at a time of cable news last night - even though the Cohen/Manafort thing is important.
Because President Trump objects to the government of South Africa seizing private land from white farmers, the far left is again branding him racist. Insane. South Africa is stealing from its citizens based on skin color. Racist?
Michael Cohen betrayed his client Donald Trump.  Was the betrayal justified?  https://t.co/KWt0O2z8ra

Donald Trump goes to extremes at times with personal invective and overstatements.  That is certainly true.  But it is him against the media hordes, so he apparently believes that scorched earth rhetoric is needed to protect himself.

The political smear industry subverts our Republic. You won't see much reportage about that because many news organizations make good use of it.		Guttersnipes have been around since Washington was in charge.		But never have they been as powerful as they are right now.
Ever wonder where all these “anonymous” sources come from? Political groups run some of them - doling out unattributed dirt to sympathetic media who don’t check anything. Also, not unusual for money to change hands when accusations are made. Some far left groups very well-funded.
President Obama was the target of smears - the birther stuff being the most vivid example. But the national media basically loved him, so the Obama haters had a much tougher time getting the garbage picked up.		Today, every anti-Trump story is fit to print.
These "theme of the week" stories have been dominating news coverage and are obviously promoted to demean the President. They give Trump's legions of media critics easy opportunities to frame criticism anyway they want.		Nonstop sniping at its meanest.
Far left outfits routinely contrive narratives in order to debase political opponents. In the case of President Trump, a kind of “theme of the week” is designed and fed out to sympathetic media people.

Russia's interference in the 2016 election has succeeded in embarrassing our current president with ongoing allegations, gravely harming the FBI, creating partisan hatred among the American populace, and pretty much destroying the image of the American press as a seeker of truth.
Putin is a menace to the world and President @realDonaldTrump should certainly be aware of that. He is trying to neutralize the martinet - not likely to happen. It’s worth a try, but Vlad is a psychotic megalomaniac. 		Tough to play nice with a person like that.

The media makes money from political polarization and so continues to inflame the hatred. Many politicians do the same thing. And President Trump continues to hammer his detractors in very personal ways.		The cycle of political hatred will not stop anytime soon.
Political hatred dominating the national discourse. Media loves it because big profits are made. Politicians embrace the hate to harvest votes. How did we get here? Check out the Message of the Day on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.

If you are angry about social injustice, you will find more kindred spirits in football.  It is a much more volatile atmosphere.  The game is violent and attracts aggressive personalities who take many things very personally.		There is little of that in baseball.
Big league baseball honored the country yesterday and does so every day.		So what’s the difference between baseball and pro football where a strain of public dissent has caused major controversy as a few players would not stand for the National Anthem?		https://t.co/JLYcpdHzSr
It was illuminating to see Major League Baseball celebrate Independence Day with a variety of patriotic displays.	    	All the players respectfully stood during the National Anthem and again later in the game when some teams like the Yankees play America the Beautiful.

Throughout our nation’s history, we have made mistakes, and we try to correct those mistakes. That is our way.	 	Meanwhile, the dark left (the hidden industry behind the far left) thinks the USA is rotten to her core and always has been.	 	And the media eats that narrative up.
Throughout the history of our country, Native Americans, African Americans – not treated well. It is a fact and no rationalization can change it.	 	Foreign policy mistakes over the centuries? Absolutely.	 	But at its core, the United States is a noble nation.
What did millions of Americans fought for over the centuries? Freedom. We, the USA, have freed billions of people all over the world, and have sacrificed tremendously to do it. That's our tradition.
Our traditions are why millions of people all over the world want to come here.
As a historian who has written 8 books on history and how it pertains to contemporary life in America, I know the reason that the USA is the most powerful nation the world has EVER seen is because of our traditions – justice, fairness, capitalism (ooh!) and FREEDOM.

Tonight I continue my reporting on the social civil war in America. During this week honoring our Independence, it's worth paying attention to the current political struggle. My @NoSpinNews analysis is a bit slanted, I admit.		Because I am extremely proud to be an American.
A president does not define the country, he or she represents it for four or eight years. A president might hurt or help the nation, but the person cannot change the basic nobility of what we’ve accomplished since 1776.
On the eve of July 4, it is worth thinking about your country and how you feel about being part of it. 		For me, the legacy of the USA is simply this: the country has provided more opportunity to more humans than any nation on earth- &amp; it isn’t even close. https://t.co/8PEsokD8ah

The leftist media loves the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez story.  She demolished a white, career politician who was largely an establishment player.  Had I been living in a Queens hotel, I would have voted for Alexandria as well.  At least she cares.
I have heard some Republicans deride Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and I think that’s a mistake. She won by outworking long time Democratic Congressman Joseph Crowley and seems to care more about people than power. A good thing for any politician.		Socialism never works. Ask Venezuela

The entire Russian thing is damaging the country and unless Mr. Mueller has front line evidence of high-level illegalities by the Trump campaign, he should wrap things up for the good of the nation.
Even though Robert Mueller removed Peter Strzok from his team after the bias was uncovered, the investigation is tainted. It would take a dramatic piece of evidence to convince non Trump-hating Americans that the fix was not in. https://t.co/4Gia0ZQI5c
Strzok's smoking gun email provides strong evidence that some high-ranking FBI investigators loathed Trump so much that they tried to “block” his chances of victory. So Mueller is gravely damaged no matter what Strzok tells a congressional committee today.

On a personal note, my debates with Charles on the Fox News Channel were epic. He was always smart and honest. 		He also did not suffer fools.
Fate dealt him a cruel blow when he was paralyzed after a diving accident as a young man. But Charles graduated from Harvard Medical School and then went on to national success as a journalist.

I believe that Donald Trump has now thrown down the gauntlet and is running for re-election - and he's using this situation at the border as his main thrust to get people's attention and to solidify his base.
The humane policy would be to crush the people-smuggling industry by making it extremely difficult to illegally cross the border.  A well designed wall would go a long way in accomplishing that.		https://t.co/08qmJ21AE7

The press will never report the incredible violence and corruption surrounding the people smuggling cartels.  For the far left, open borders should be the policy and anyone who opposes that is a bigot. The media is sympathetic to that point-of-view.
Even after President Trump issued an Executive Order allowing migrant adults with children to stay together after apprehension on the border, the hate-Trump press continued to hammer the President in deeply personal ways.		No surprise.

So, what was the motivation?  Michael Horowitz doesn’t say.  But based upon released evidence, there is only one reason that FBI personnel would knowingly botch a high profile investigation like this one: political bias.
Lost in the press hysteria over migrant children being detained w/o the adults who brought them here illegally is the testimony of Horowitz.	    	To the relief of the hate-Trump media, Horowitz reports that his team found no evidence that political bias stimulated the violations.

I mean how many times must we be subjected to the phrase  “at the end of the day?”  Or “kick the can down the road?”  Or “move the goalposts?”  The cliches are exhausting.  There should be fines.
The same phrases are used on TV over and over. The lazy interviewer who will not formulate a specific question often asks a guest, “what do you make of that?”		Here’s what I make of that- you’re a moron if you can’t frame questions that do more than elicit tedious generalities.
This is why Trump threatened the tariffs in the first place. 		If I’m Trump, I go for $100 billion – every year. https://t.co/QKLAxDAbjM
By an overwhelming majority, Americans told @PewResearch they are “worn out” by the amount of news coverage on display in the USA. Those with news “fatigue” is 68%.		I feel their pain-even though I have worked in the news for 45 years, I, too, am enervated after news consumption.

Critical mass has been reached when the media is so one-sided that any sense of fair play has been extinguished. If you are a non-liberal and get caught up in controversy, you will be savaged. If you are a person of the left, the treatment is likely to be far more gentle.
Traditionally in America our values are based on the Ten Commandments - those are displayed in the Supreme Court building.  Drives the far left crazy to hear that, but take out the God part and you have a solid list of things you should not do.

Ultimately, the Constitution was upheld in the same-sex wedding cake case - and the traditions we have that make America strong live to fight another day.
As a Roman Catholic, I could bake a cake for a gay wedding without violating or committing a sin in my religion. But that’s not the case for every religious sect - including Christians, Jews, and Muslims.
What troubles me with the same-sex wedding cake case are the lower courts, because they don't rule as far as the Constitution is concerned. They rule on their own belief systems. You can't have that in this kind of a republic. Judges must follow the written law…!
Hillary Clinton would have appointed judges like Sotomayor and Ginsburg-- Trump goes the other way and tries to get the traditional judges on the court. This is huge b/c the President's power doesn't equal the power of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the ultimate power.
The slogan of my website https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C is “Take Your Country Back,” and I get a lot of mail asking, “what does that mean?!”	 	Know that your country is under siege - but at least we have a system at the Supreme Court level that reads the law the way it was written. https://t.co/ZCaaTBrTbi

I am perplexed by @realDonaldTrump's lawyers. I don’t know what they’re doing in the Russian collusion probe. Maybe Trump's lawyers want WE THE PEOPLE to get so sick of it all that we demand it stop.		Maybe that's the strategy, but to me… button it!

Will the White House hiring of Rudy Giuliani turn the tide against the Russian/Collusion investigation?  Please read my Message of the Day on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 for the inside story.
It is hard to believe that Mayor Giuliani would take the job if there was a chance strong evidence would emerge against the President. Why would Giuliani risk tarnishing his reputation? 	https://t.co/BXG7Erd2y2

And how about Washington Post legendary editor Ben Bradlee being best pals with John F. Kennedy?  Then there’s Post columnist George Will’s deep friendship with Nancy and Ronald Reagan.  Tons of other examples. Media hypocrisy never dies.
It really is a travesty watching the media scorch Sean Hannity over his friendship with Donald Trump.  In 1992, an open mic caught Larry King saying this to Bill Clinton about CNN founder Ted Turner: “He’s a big fan of yours.  He would serve you.”

SF's problem is homeless substance abusers. There are thousands of them living on the streets.  They use the city as their personal toilet, inject narcotics in public, approach people on the street demanding money, and generally cause non-stop trouble.

Generalized propaganda has no place in any school.  But I can guarantee you that some districts will buy the new AP textbook even though it will damage students by feeding them ideology not fact-based history.
Public schools have the option of buying textbooks of their choice. A new AP History book written by James Fraser apparently portrays Christians, conservative Americans, and Trump supporters as bigots who fear non-white ethnicities. https://t.co/rxPiKrl3v4

The reason the press is getting away with massive deceit is that no one is holding them accountable.  There is no judge, no jury.  The only justice is that many news agencies are failing. 		https://t.co/dnkAP7JmYV
Yesterday, a spokesman for Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller warned the press that many stories that are printed and/or aired are false.  And that’s true.  During Monday’s news cycle, I counted six direct lies from reporters covering the Sean Hannity - Michael Cohen situation.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: plan your summer trip this week. Otherwise, the good stuff might be booked!

The whole sordid thing revolving around the special prosecutor is harming America.  Tonight on the @NoSpinNews, we will advance the Comey story and assess the damage being done to the President.
The country suffers b/c the Trump administration is constantly on the defensive fighting battles that have nothing to do with policies that help the ppl. Things are coming to a head as the hate-Trump movement, which includes most of the national press, senses blood in the water.
It was sad for the country to see the former FBI Director trash the President of the United States on national television as being “morally unfit” to hold the office.
A no spin assessment of James Comey’s attack on President Trump posted on https://t.co/fqUvO5WfNy.  Please check it out. https://t.co/I3L7ACjIdL

The air attack on Syria was justified.  If a government uses chemical weapons and is not held accountable, the world will descend into anarchy.  Britain, France and the USA would not “collude” to mislead about the situation.  That’s impossible.

Here’s the tip of the day:  the well dressed man knows the end of his tie should hit the middle of his belt as it hangs.  President Trump sometimes lets his ties droop way too long.
The FBI raid on the President’s lawyer makes things very difficult for investigating authorities. The FBI and by extension Robert Mueller are now in a box.  Vivid and honest analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.  Hope you check us out!
You might want to check out my new column on how leaks to the media are hurting the country badly.  We’ve posted that on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.	https://t.co/ygf9f6e3nX
Today many college campuses are full of “safe spaces” and witch hunters seeking out “aggressions.”  It’s a horror that can lead to permanent damage for unsuspecting young people.
According to the School, any gender competition is bad and “excludes” some human beings.  How that exclusion is possible is a deep mystery of the universe. https://t.co/W5yx6Kh5ns
Penn State has dropped the homecoming king and queen description because they are not “inclusive” enough.  Instead, when Nittany Lion alumni return to campus in the fall, they will see no display of gender selection in any capacity. https://t.co/EpZcToWDg1

President Trump finds himself in a tough spot after the raid on his lawyer. What should he do?  The question will be answered on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight!
Donald Trump has to maintain discipline because if he fires Special Prosecutor Mueller, he will be under siege for years.  It will be Richard Nixon all over again.  So, the President must let the investigation play out.
There are many leaks coming from Robert Mueller’s office and from the White House itself.  These whispers to the press are doing grave damage to the President. https://t.co/8uDxolHRiI
The Trump haters had a good day Monday with the FBI raiding the home and office of the President’s personal attorney Michael Cohen.  If you missed my analysis of exactly what happened and why - it’s available today on the site. https://t.co/SRi9CQ9dA0

After listening to the initial reporting, it looks like the raid on President Trump’s lawyer today is a bank fraud beef.  Might be associated with payment to the porn lady.  An educated guess from your humble correspondent.
Looks to me like Trump will now fire Mueller after the FBI raided his lawyer’s office this afternoon. The Trump-appointed FBI Director might also been in the exit zone. All this is terrible for the country as military action against Syria looms. https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 is on it.
Should the USA bomb Syria for again using chemical weapons on civilians?  Yes, but a smart attack must be used.  Analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.	Also, the Kimmel - Hannity war.  What’s at stake?
We are at the point now in America where the politics of personal destruction is accepted and nurtured.  It has become an industry that is destructive and corrupt. Late night television is part of that industry.
A few days ago, Kimmel mocked Melania’s accent on his late night show and Hannity called him out.  The back and forth twitter war speaks for itself with Kimmel finally waving the white flag yesterday.	https://t.co/skCamA2nYV
The essence of the feud between Sean Hannity and Jimmy Kimmel is the personal attack situation in this country. Imagine how First Lady Melania Trump and her 12 year old son Barron must feel watching the President get smeared everyday of the year.  Extremely painful for them.
Life is hard.  Many naps are needed. https://t.co/NmtE6qj0lO
Get the truth about what’s really going on at the southern border.  https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 provides honest analysis!  Check it out this weekend.
This is a largely unreported story that should be exposed.  Mexico should be working with the USA to stop illegal immigration. Then a wall would not be needed. Get honest analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5WfNy
President Trump should immediately ask for a UN commission to investigate the horrific abuse of poor people, mostly women, trying to cross Mexico to enter the USA.
President Trump is right on border security but wrong on how he’s selling it.  Check out honest analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5WfNy.
President Trump is doing the right thing at the southern border but the wrong thing in explaining the policy. Mr. Trump continues to personalize our problems with Mexico by mentioning rape etc. thereby fogging up the issue.
Chaos in Mexico presents a national security problem to the USA, drugs are pouring in here from Mexico and millions of people have bypassed our immigration system to illegally enter America.  Every sane individual knows those are dangers to we the people. https://t.co/ZU9aQk6AOn
Here’s the Tip of the Day: if you stop drinking sugary beverages you will shed pounds without Marie Osmond coming to your house. There are plenty of drinks with less than 15g of sugar (read the label), or drink water with lemon. Saves you money when you eat out as well.
No tariffs on Corgis! I’m getting a petition on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. https://t.co/poJy1a3HKm
The National Guard will essentially back up federal border patrol agents, making their jobs and lives easier.  Sounds like a plan, right?  Who could possibly object? How about every left wing commentator in the universe.
Moving National Guard troops to the Southern border is something I have been suggesting since the Al Qaeda attack in 2001. Now, President @realDonaldTrump is doing it in the face of a vicious opioid epidemic and continued illegal alien crossings.  https://t.co/Ha8WHUDJUy

President @realDonaldTrump got a rare win with Robert Mueller publicly saying he’s not a target for crimes committed.  Hate Trump media hates that, yes they do.  But there is more drama to come.  Honest analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
We predicted that Robert Mueller would not find Mr. Trump engaged in criminal activity about a year ago when the @NoSpinNews first began here on https://t.co/fqUvO5WfNy.  So, how did I know?
Tonight’s @NoSpinNews on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C: I talk to @eScarry about his new book “Fraud and Fiction: The Real Truth Behind Fire and Fury” and get his take on media reports about President @realDonaldTrump.
The tone was funereal last night in the media when the news broke that President Trump is not being investigated for crimes associated with Russian interference with the 2016 election.  I thought some hate-Trump commentators were going to cry.

I admire Roseanne for putting on an honest program. Most actors would never do what she’s doing - they would never go against the Hollywood flow.
If you did watch @RoseanneonABC, watch out - the zealots are branding approval of Roseanne’s character, who likes @realDonaldTrump, a racist action. This is more of the same, elitists smearing Trump supporters with hateful descriptions.	https://t.co/Dx48DLS2Ka

The tweet from @IngrahamAngle was ill-advised and Laura has apologized.  But know this: the sponsor boycott is not some spontaneous uprising by companies.  It is being directed by powerful, shadowy radical groups who want Laura Ingraham off the air.
There is no question that if you are a conservative commentator in America, elements on the far left will try to harm you.  The Laura Ingraham situation clearly illustrates what is going on. https://t.co/kSY1mUSEFE
Watching JC Superstar on NBC. Who knew Jesus of Nazareth ran a tattoo parlor? Geez.

Hollywood cannot be pleased by this because it has an important political implication. Tonight on the No Spin News, I will analyze the politics of Roseanne and what the show is signaling.	https://t.co/vJMlP0xLpK
More than 18 million viewers tuned into ABC to watch @therealroseanne on Tuesday night, a stunning number. The reason is that Ms. Barr herself has been somewhat supportive of President Trump.  She even told Trump-basher Jimmy Kimmel to zip it on his own show.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: pay bills twice a month - on the first and 15th.  Put all paper bills in a single place.  Organization leads to prosperity.
Roseanne @therealroseanne scores big in the ratings. Did @realDonaldTrump supporters make a statement here? We’ll deal with tonight beginning at 7 on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.

Last night on The No Spin News, we analyzed how the Trump-women situation is hurting the country and how the President should protect himself legally.  I hope you saw that.

With the help of the hate-Trump media, there is a full out campaign to marginalize Mr. Trump and destroy his ability to lead. We predicted this would happen months ago when the Russia-collusion investigation began to totter.

So, Anderson, some guy threatened my baby daughter to my face but I was too scared to tell the police but not too scared to tell @60Minutes.
If someone threatened your young child with harm, would you not go to the police?  Even after you saw the man who did it?https://t.co/zSllyYcnN0
So much for the porn performer on “60 Minutes” who’s story doesn’t stack.  She says she didn’t want money to attack Donald Trump but accepted money.  She doesn’t want money now either.  So why are you on national television with all this garbage?  Does that help your daughter?

Here’s the Tip of the Day: plan your summer vacation now. I’m heading to Ireland in July and flights are almost sold out already. Airlines are using smaller planes on many routes. Hotels booking up as well. The improving economy means more folks on the move.
Ms. Daniels is obviously seeking more money and attention by alleging a tryst with Trump long before he got into politics.  She already accepted payment and now wants more.  So why is the press helping her out? https://t.co/VjA5QLPQOO
Increasingly obvious that President Trump did not actively seek Russia’s help winning the Presidency. Trump's opponents desperately trying to sell that premise - heavy odds are they will fail. Therefore, it is the women accusing Donald Trump that will soon dominate press coverage
As usual, my analysis will be fact-based and honest.  We have not been wrong yet on the ongoing jihad against Mr. Trump! https://t.co/qFwiK8Q6Tq

All the more reason to admire Bob Woodward for speaking the truth.  I have interviewed him many times and believe he is an honest journalist with a healthy dose of courage.  A rarity in the American media today.
Speaking to Newsweek, Bob Woodward described some media people as “emotionally unhinged” and scolded them for adopting a tone of “ridicule.” https://t.co/jorj2qlBCa
Tip of the Day: now is a good time to buy dividend-paying stocks that don’t have wide price swings. Dow is down two thousand points from its high.
Big story the national press is ignoring.  A torrent of leaks coming out of Robert Mueller’s unit, all designed to hurt President Trump.	We’ll tell you what’s going on tonight beginning at 7 eastern on The No Spin News. Take your country back! Check out https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0
A big show down coming: Trump vs. the investigators of the Hillary emails and Russian collusion.  That will affect every American.  The truth on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 right now.  Also, best analysis of the story on the No Spin News tonight beginning at 7 eastern.
The upcoming report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz will tilt this ultra-serious situation.  At this point, it looks like Mr. Horowitz will criticize FBI leadership.  Andrew McCabe would not have been fired on Friday, if he were blameless.
Comey and McCabe both lost their jobs and are now insinuating the President tried to obstruct justice during the probe into Russia.  Both men deny any wrongdoing themselves or by the Bureau. https://t.co/VXyzybi1T2
Is the President taking March Madness too far?  Get honest analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.  Corgis do! https://t.co/nGZzeKBG9y
Leftist media will try to make Comey and McCabe heroes.  All of the chaos will hurt Special Counsel Mueller.  On Monday, we’ll break it all down and have honest analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.  Something that is difficult to find these days.
Titanic battle shaping up between fired FBI guys McCabe and Comey and their one time boss President Trump.  Much hinges on the upcoming report from the Justice Department Inspector General on the FBI.
The Corgi nation wishes everyone a Happy St. Patrick’s Day! https://t.co/XMOPaxjKTV
As predicted, FBI agent Andrew McCabe has just been fired late on a Friday night. That foreshadows big trouble for James Comey, Loretta Lynch and possibly Barack Obama.  President Trump has to be happy tonight.
Here’s the Tip of the Day:  knowing your family’s history is fun and can teach you about yourself.  It’s worth some time and money to find your ancestry.  We are all unique.
The illegal alien who killed Kate Steinle is apparently suing the federal government. Sinful. Please read the Message of the Day on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. 	https://t.co/Z6hEN6BuFy
We are investigating this disgusting situation and will have a full report on Monday.  In the meantime, please check out the No Spin News highlights from this week, and my radio chat with @glennbeck.
In a story almost entirely ignored by the corrupt media, Jose Zarate, the illegal alien charged with murdering Kate Steinle but acquitted of all but gun charges, is reportedly suing the federal government for “malicious prosecution.” https://t.co/Z6hEN6BuFy
Here’s the Tip of the Day: snacks are good, they lift your spirits. Right now I am liking Bachman butter twist pretzels. No sugar, no fat, reasonable calories.
RT @NoSpinNews: Tonight on the No Spin News, Bill will analyze Trump fatigue and what is likely to happen next.  Also, we will introduce yo…
Ratings for CNN and Fox News have fallen substantially.  A few hate-Trump programs on MSNBC have added viewers but they will soon leave because the shows are boring.  Most of us have had enough.
There is Trump fatigue sweeping the nation.  Americans are getting to the point where the President’s daily journey through life is so exploited by the media, that it’s numbing. https://t.co/ND6xxBs8kf
Here’s the Tip of the Day: plan stuff. Right now I am booking a trip to Ireland for the summer. Weekend flights almost sold out as are many of the good hotels. These days many Americans procrastinate. That will cut down on options.
The prevailing sentiment in the nation’s schools is that the Second Amendment is bad and gun restrictions are good.  For many teenagers, there is nothing more than that because they are ignorant of history and policy.
Thousands of school kids will mark the 30 day anniversary of the Parkland shooting in Florida by walking out of class today.  This action has both positives and negatives attached to it. https://t.co/bekTi4UhsX
RT @NoSpinNews: Tonight on the No Spin News we’ll look at California’s philosophy in what will be very entertaining analysis.   See you beg…
Homeless legions have almost destroyed downtown San Francisco and Los Angeles, taxes are cruel, and traffic is punishing. But far worse is the social fascism that attacks non-liberal viewpoints.  The state is politically correct to the point of paralysis.
California has changed drastically since Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon came out of there.  While the state maintains it’s natural beauty and hospitable weather, the population has turned dramatically left. 	https://t.co/71lKwFjjo1
President Trump rolls into California to raise some political money and look at border wall prototypes.  Since the Golden State rivals Havana in anti-Trump sentiment, Mr. Trump is not exactly welcomed in the land of entitlement.
We predicted Secretary of State Tillerson would go. So, how did I know? We’ll tell you this evening on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. Also, I will analyze the chaos that is California.
The debasement of the national media continues. On the Trump-hating CNN network, a paid commentator uses a foul image to object to the House Intel Committee’s report saying no Russian collusion. Get honest news analysis, on https://t.co/fqUvO5WfNy.
Tip: America is getting meaner, people less trustworthy. Has to do with the intense struggle for acceptance &amp; wealth. Therefore self-protection becomes vital. Do not put personal stuff on social media, just trivial pursuits. Watch what you say even to folks you think are friends.
President Trump knows his past private life will now become a present headline.  He knows the news agencies that despise him will hammer away relentlessly with the women issue.  So, now, he will relentlessly attack those media critics seeking to marginalize them with the voters.
The war between President Trump and the national media has reached hysterical proportions. Who is winning the conflict and why is it being waged in the first place? We’ll answer those questions on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 beginning at 7pm eastern time this evening.
I reported months ago that the media would use women to try to destroy the Trump presidency. The media and the stealth anti-Trump organizations will concentrate on accusations against the President from a variety of women.	https://t.co/akSE2T2YuQ

Here’s the Tip of the Day: do something nice for an elderly person this weekend. Even if it’s just a call to say hello. Important for Americans to treat seniors with respect.

This proves beyond any doubt that the hate-Trump media could not care less about peace, the denigration of threats, or improving the state of the world.  All the haters want is to destroy Trump.
Hard to believe but some MSNBC commentators are hammering President @realDonaldTrump for a proposed meeting with the North Korean dictator. Find out why the Trump haters are furious right now on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. https://t.co/Ra90CTmYsQ

Here’s the Tip of the Day: cut down on bread, bagels, and rolls. After the age of 30, they bulk you up. Donuts too. Once in a while, okay, but knock it back 50 percent and you’ll have a lot more energy and look better. The Pillsbury dough boy looks that way for a reason.
Aside from the hypocrisy of a “rights” group embracing a hater like Farrakhan, there is subterfuge and deceit. We will also tell you who is funding much of the “Women’s March” movement.
We have been telling you that many of these women-empowerment groups are not what they appear to be.  Radical and hateful people are often embedded in the movement. https://t.co/awCHqQUeCK
Here’s the Tip of the Day: overtip for good service, undertip for mediocre performance. Accountability is important.
Big changes developing in cable news ratings. Find out why on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight beginning at 7.
Many media people simply want accusations, they have no interest in seeking the truth about important situations. If truth is not paramount for the nation’s press corps, our Republic is weakened.  And that is the case right now. 		https://t.co/2UWN6RKees
Veteran journalist @Stevenbrill is launching an internet site to expose “fake news.” That might be a good thing if it is entirely fact-based and steers away from ideology.  Americans certainly need to identify the deceivers in the media.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: a recent study says many millennials, younger Americans, brush their teeth just once a day. Minimum three times, please. Protect your teeth and gums or you will pay a painful price.

Oscar telecast hits all time low viewership. Hollywood smug not playing well. No Spin analysis tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 beginning at 7 eastern.
As we predicted the Oscar telecast was a ratings bomb. America has had enough of Hollywood posturing. Analysis posted right now on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C https://t.co/8wY1CFhHNL
Spare me the Oscar telecast where artistic achievement has been replaced by idiotic bombast and shallow posturing. That's not entertainment.
Was very happy not to watch the Oscar show last night because phonies on parade has zero appeal for me. Right now there is a judgment jihad in Hollywood about politics and behavior.  Cheap shots and false perceptions are running riot. https://t.co/dUfJei2Tkc
Don’t hate me if I win best supporting Corgi. https://t.co/YyIIjtSSxp

If you go to https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C, you can hear @glennbeck and I talking about the gun controversy. Worth a listen.
The companies that disrespected @NRA member by taking away discounts will suffer in the marketplace. Americans know far-left totalitarians are behind the economic threats and they don’t like it.
Turmoil in the stock market continues and Friday on the @GlennBeck radio program, we discuss President Trump’s policies and money. Good, lively back and fourth, hear the radio extravaganza at https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. 		https://t.co/e5RdjNwkRu
Here’s the Tip of the Day: don’t over explain anything. State your case clearly, no repetition. Then politely ask if there are questions. You’ll command attention that way. You can see the technique on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
Are you a happy American? A new study says most of us are not happy campers. Find out why on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C this evening starting at 7 eastern time.
As you may know, there are no more rules in journalism - rumors, allegations, and innuendo are now presented as fact.	https://t.co/gYRmWqWAaO
The leaks are beginning to sprout again from the Trump White House and that is bad news for the President.
Here's the Tip of the Day: someone you know is in distress. Call or text that person tonight. Just to listen if they want to talk.
As it turns out, CNN did not fraudulently provide questions to a student in that Town Hall on guns. So why was the story misreported in some places? It all has to do with CNN itself. Full analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5WfNy beginning at 7 eastern time this evening.
More ridiculous analysis of the Trump administration. Hope Hicks is leaving as communications director and the media really doesn’t know why, but that won't stop the brutal speculation. Keep track of what media people are the most irresponsible. Maybe we’ll put out a board game.
I ignored the story because I knew it was most likely bogus. No TV person would script something like that- too easy to get caught. Once again, some members of the media fell for a bogus story. That will not happen on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C because we are experienced and honest. https://t.co/MxqpHaqDU9

Here’s the Tip of the Day: when someone is rude to you, don’t say anything. Just give them the Corgi stare and walk away. https://t.co/sjHCYk22Ea
Tonight on the @NoSpinNews, I will tell you exactly how the media’s blatant bias is directly hurting your life.
One of the most important stories in America is press bias.  In a time when many citizens refuse to pay attention to their country, the national media is trying hard to influence policy rather than report facts.
Does press bias bother you?  It should because it directly affects your life. Please read my message today on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. https://t.co/9ALSZ5SJm9
Here’s the Tip of the Day: Americans drink tons of sugar drinks and diet drinks. Both are bad for you. Look for beverages with less than 12g of sugar or pound that water. You’ll feel more energized almost immediately!
Just got back from Denver, land of legalized pot! Tell you what I saw there tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
Many Americans correctly believe that with 325 million citizens, those with power in the public arena, can only do so much. Therefore, responsible and smart Americans must be self-reliant.

Is there now a crisis because the American media is so hateful? I think so.  @GlennBeck and I talked about it on the radio. You can hear it on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. You won’t be bored. https://t.co/SS02I0y5Fd
Today, we’ve posted my radio chat with Glenn Beck about CNN’s performance and the gun controversy in general.		https://t.co/XyNg1nH9Wr

Anger mounting over the gun issue. Does anyone have a clear, smart perspective? We do. Check out https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
Right now, guns remain a political situation, with the left generally wanting to empower the government to regulate weapons.  That, of course, weakens individuals in their quest to protect themselves.		https://t.co/sRMF8CiaPm
The white hot gun debate is essentially about harm reduction, crafting laws and regulations that will make it more difficult for bad people to use guns to injure and kill. The divide between the left and the right is bitter.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: fight the power. Slap a time limit on using your devices everyday. You’ll feel much better.
Teenagers and gun control.  What is actually happening here?   There’s some good and some bad.  Also, a sneaky media intrusion.  We’ll lay it all out on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
When does the White House press briefing begin again? https://t.co/bHbutnMnZU
Tip of the Day: if you love your country, you have an obligation to pay attention to what is happening to it. Right now there is an attempted coup underway engineered by powerful media people. Vital that Americans pay attention to this. https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C has the facts.
Using teenagers to make political points on guns. A good thing or media exploitation? We’ll debate it tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. Tough but fair analysis.
The national press believes it is their job to destroy the Trump administration by any means necessary.  So if the media has to use kids to do that, they’ll use kids. 		https://t.co/6U8Hurbxmm
The big question is: should the media be promoting opinions by teenagers who are in an emotional state and facing extreme peer pressure in some cases?
Former Republican Congressman Jack Kingston suggested on @CNN that some of the high schoolers in Florida are being used by leftist people in the gun control debate. While this is most likely true, there have been a few young people that have taken a more conservative view.
Tip of the Day: the media using kids for commentary in the emotional Florida shooting is exploitative and, in a way, cruel. When emotions are running high, think things through.		I’ll deal with this situation tomorrow on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
The media mob, of course, is siding with LeBron James and diminishing Laura Ingraham.  Just another example of corruption.  Labeling Americans racist has become a vicious sport that the national press embraces.
https://t.co/Vud1PWRfqI
My viewpoint is that LeBron James has a perfect right to use his sports platform to dispense his opinions.  But when he lambastes Donald Trump and says the President doesn’t care about Americans, he should accept the inevitable criticism that kind of punditry always brings.
This verbal brawl between Laura Ingraham and LeBron James seems to be escalating.  After the NBA all star game last night, Mr. James continued defending himself from Laura’s contention that he lacks the expertise to provide political analysis to the nation.
Mr. James should check out https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 to see what cogent commentary on the awful Florida shooting looks like.
The anti-Laura Ingraham pile on continues and it’s absurd. If LeBron James wants to use his basketball platform for political punditry then he should expect criticism from analysts like Laura. If LeBron has the stronger argument, let it flow. But spare us the indignation, please.
Laura Ingraham being called racist for criticizing LeBron James’s political point of view.  Unfair and foolish.  I’ve known @IngrahamAngle for decades and she wants equality for all Americans.  When will we stop with this race card business?  When?
Here’s the Tip of the Day: relaxing on the weekend is good! Keeping it pithy. https://t.co/3iFLkzKQvn
Today begins the Year of the Dog.  Please send my presents to https://t.co/rryWmzeOZa. https://t.co/u0bFfrGcsD
As I pointed out last night, gun legislation will not stop mass killings- only increased security especially at the nation's school will do that. https://t.co/BHtNM3EFrb
The majority of Americans do not want the federal government to ban defensive weapons but will support reasonable restrictions in the gun area.
Did you know that gun murders and shootings have dropped dramatically in America?  Chances are you don't, because the dishonest media will not report it.  This weekend our analysis of the horrific Florida school massacre is open to all.  Get the truth, it will enhance your life.
RT @NoSpinNews: Please take a few minutes to watch our analysis of the Florida murders, which is posted for all to see this weekend. It may…
The bitterness and anger surrounding the massacre at the high school in South Florida is a good thing if positive action comes from it. But nothing constructive will happen if hateful partisans hold sway. 		https://t.co/Hd9qHKvsDK
Here’s the Tip of the Day: violence is almost always driven by money and/or fear. The Florida mass murderer is a good example of that. We profile him and others like him on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight. Important analysis.
The national press is not providing astute analysis on the Florida massacre.  On https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C we will.  The broadcast is open to all tonight beginning at 7 eastern.  Get the straight story!  See you then.
If we are ever going to improve school safety, you have to identify the root of the problem- I will tonight beginning at 7 pm eastern. https://t.co/lfLEJCCcBe

Can’t take it anymore. All morning I have wasted my time listening to cable news “analysts” fail to provide any workable solutions to school gun violence.
https://t.co/FY6DXUU9x6
It is all about rage when kids decide to kill. Money is not involved nor is political terror. It's personal. https://t.co/QpV4v5DuBf
The epidemic of school shootings is obviously a very troubling part of American life. Although violent crime is down significantly in this country, we see horrific crimes involving children far too often.
Something should be done but what?  Tomorrow we will put forth analysis that may help. For now, please pray for or think about the innocent victims.
Another black day for America with the senseless violence in South Florida. We the people are used to discussing solutions to terrible problems like mass shootings. But the truth is that individual rage is driving the murders, which are now occurring on a regular basis.
The national media desperately wants to destroy WH Chief of Staff John Kelly because that would create chaos for the President. So how should the White House handle the Kelly problem?
How should the White House handle media attacks on Chief of Staff John Kelly? We’ll answer that question tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. Please check us out!

Here’s the Tip of the Day: don’t buy cheap shoes. Your feet need protection. Get the quality shoes and sneaks, and take care of them. They’ll last for years.
So place your bets: who will prevail in this intense debate? https://t.co/igwSHpBAcs
It is clear that most Americans have had enough of the lax security at the southern border. Democrats foolishly oppose the wall for political reasons but the President will not sign immigration reform without it.
Basically the Democrats have one strategy: Hate Trump
Democrats in Congress badly need to get some kind of immigration deal. The party is adrift, not able to control its radical elements or provide solutions to vexing problems. 		https://t.co/e99rQ6SJxA
Here’s the Tip of the Day: it is natural to seek retribution against those who hurt you. But delay directly confronting the situation for as long as you can. Sometimes karma takes over. If it doesn’t think out your plan very carefully.
By now the administration should understand there will be no fairness or perspective provided by the press. Donald Trump is guilty -of everything.
Hard to believe but the partisan TV stuff is getting even more vicious. Tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C we’ll tell you why and what it means for the country. Hope you check us out.
With @realDonaldTrump's poll numbers rising because of the economy, he now becomes even more dangerous to the American left who are hell bent on destroying him.
As we predicted on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C, that anti-Trump forces in the media are focusing heavily on the President's personal situation.

The next big story is the battle for border wall funding. @GlennBeck and I advance the story mightily. Please check it out on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
Character assassination has never been easier in America. Accusations have become convictions, fodder for late night comedians and cable news yakkers. It's a deplorable situation and at this point, there is no way to stop it.
It's a vicious, corrupt system that has taken deep root in our political landscape. Well known newspapers and magazines are also doing it especially to the Trump White House.   	https://t.co/kk68tL1cEo
If you visit political websites on the net, always risky if you care about truth, you will notice article after article based on anonymous sources.  Vanity Fair and the Huffington Post lead the league in that.
Here's the Tip of the Day: if you can afford it, tip 20 percent in restaurants. Used to be 15 but let's be generous. However, if the service is bad or rude, just leave a buck. That will send a message.

If I were James Comey, I’d be worried. The former @FBI Director is tweeting dumb stuff like “is that it?”  But he should be hiring a good lawyer.
Tonight on the @NoSpinNews, I will advance the FBI-memo story into where I think it’s heading: the criminal zone.
Congrats to Nick Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles, one of the best Super Bowls ever. Tom Brady best of all time.
RT @BillOReilly: Since President @realDonaldTrump told @NBC to go stick it about the Super Bowl interview this year, this one I did last ye…
I did three Super Bowl Sunday interviews. This was the interview where Putin apparently threatened to kill me - https://t.co/1VhKvGcQoD https://t.co/hIk4i1qUpP
Since President @realDonaldTrump told @NBC to go stick it about the Super Bowl interview this year, this one I did last year is pretty edifying - https://t.co/1VhKvGcQoD https://t.co/eAZp5SIQSu
Just watched the Super Bowl interview with President @realDonaldTrump on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. The entire Corgi community is impressed! https://t.co/wXQrD0fJu8
@FBI Check out my conversation with @GlennBeck on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. https://t.co/DbaMyb9MbL
The fallout from the @FBI exposure over obtaining a surveillance warrant under false pretenses is twofold: first, it justifies President Trump firing James Comey.  And second, it exposes those media people who don’t feel this story is important as complete frauds.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: the war over Donald Trump continues with the FBI memo. What does it really mean?  Best analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight.
So finally the House Intelligence memo written by Republican members is out. This morning on the radio with @GlennBeck, I analyzed the importance of this and where it is likely to lead. https://t.co/DbaMyb9MbL
Tip of the Day: February is a tough month for Americans in the Midwest &amp; Northern parts of the country. Winter fatigue sets in. So each week this month, plan something fun that you can look forward to. Better yet, head south for a week! It'll be St. Pat's day before you know it.
Hysteria building over the release of a congressional memo that may hurt the @FBI and help @realDonaldTrump.  @GovMikeHuckabee and I will have tough analysis tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
RT @NoSpinNews: https://t.co/fKaStxtgQH is all over this story and we will tell it straight no matter where the facts fly. There is somethi…
It is very telling that the @FBI does not want we the people to see how the Bureau operated in the run up to the 2016 presidential election.  Clearly the FBI is trying to hide something. https://t.co/MIikOvIheO
Democrats in Congress do not want to know what the @FBI did, and that's kind of shocking isn't it? Usually the left rants about "transparency." Not this time.
It looks like the @FBI will be taking a beating over both the Hillary Clinton-email and the Trump-Russia investigations.  The American people have an absolute right to know what happened in both situations.
My slogan is "Corgis First!" There's a letter about me on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C tonight. Check it out! https://t.co/WD0YZllqFK
Here’s the Tip of the Day: life is not fair. When bad things happen to you, talk it over with the smartest person you know who cares about you. Then you take action if necessary.
Polls say President @realDonaldTrump did well last night in the State of the Union. @glennbeck and I will analyze speech reaction tonight on https://t.co/XFUvtpy05C. Hope you check that out!
RT @NoSpinNews: We'll get Beck's full take on the #SOTU on tonight's No Spin News, and recap some crazy reaction to the speech. https://t.c…
Speech is very long.  We’ll be live on https://t.co/fqUvO5WfNy after and I’ll keep it pithy.
The President should have mentioned Defense Secretary Mattis in the ISIS report.		Also, would have behooved him to say the ISIS problem was largely ignored by previous administration.
Wants to get tougher on drug dealers.  Good. Not much vision on rehabbing addicts.
Powerful immigration pitch from the President, putting open border folks on the defensive. @CNN getting ready to say Trump is “demonizing” the immigrant “community.” Bank on it.
Bernie Sanders may nod out. Three to one odds.
Who is paler, Paul Ryan or Mike Pence?
The camera just found Congresswoman Pelosi again.  		Looks like there’s something wrong with her dentures.
Mr. Trump is gaining confidence and that means he’s more likely to go off script.
Now President Trump getting a bit more “in your face” with the “In God We Trust” comment.  That’s aimed at the secular-progressives. Then he tweaked the NFL on the anthem.
Democrats don’t look happy about low black and Hispanic unemployment.  Why not?
Nancy Pelosi looks like she’s sitting on a nail.
Nice moment with Congressman Scalise. President Trump trying to strike a positive posture.
We are LIVE now on @Newsmax TV talking #SOTU. 		If you don’t have Newsmax - or don’t know where to find it - you can also watch live on my website – https://t.co/S0YsVGadaj
Resting up before O’Reilly’s State of the Union analysis. He always gets me riled up! Corgi pun. https://t.co/iUYc6BSErC
President Trump will say tonight that he wants to unite the country. Is that possible? Please check out my analysis open to all on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. Also I will analyze the President’s address live on @Newsmax TV &amp; https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 right before and after the speech! https://t.co/RDgZ2XTbQV

State of the Union madness is here.  We’ll be live on @Newsmax TV and https://t.co/fqUvO5WfNy at 8:45 eastern and right after the President’s speech as well.  Hope you check it out.
As we predicted on the @NoSpinNews, the sloppy reporting about Mr. Trump “deciding” to fire Robert Mueller is fading fast, and tonight the President has a chance to act presidential during the #SOTU. https://t.co/U9O1PMMhvn
RT @NoSpinNews: https://t.co/7Exs3Qb2PD has been way ahead on pinpointing the truth about the @FBI and very troubling allegations of federa…
On tonight’s @NoSpinNews I will have my own State of the Union address at 5 eastern that will be open to all. Then right before the President speaks, and again right after, I will appear live on @Newsmax TV with more analysis.
President @realDonaldTrump would be wise to avoid mentioning the @FBI or the Mueller investigation during tonight's #SOTU. Just keep the speech on policy and let any corruption unfold in the public arena. The people will get it.
Hope the State of the Union address is better than the Grammys. Yeech! I’m watching the analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. https://t.co/UJtLKLP7Xd
Here’s the Tip of the Day: when you go to a restaurant, ask the waiter or waitress a question about themselves before ordering. Could be as simple as “is there any thing especially good on the menu?” By personalizing interactions, you’ll get the best possible service.
If you do not know where to find @Newsmax TV, click here: https://t.co/BdRtLa9XSn https://t.co/YfSGBWiNui
I will analyze Trump's State of the Union address live on @Newsmax TV Tuesday night. Spread the word!!! https://t.co/9W9hXzEExi
CBS cannot control spontaneous comments at the Grammys but it can control skits that are rehearsed in advance. It is clear the network has now staked out a political position; one that will alienate millions of potential viewers. https://t.co/2bzRbq5zFa
What looked like a cheap political stunt on the Grammy telecast is actually much more than that. The head of @CBS, Les Moonves, had to know that exposition was scheduled so we now have one of the big three networks actively undermining a sitting president.
CBS made a major mistake allowing Hillary Clinton to bash President Trump during a skit on The Grammys. Satire is one thing, stark partisanship is another matter, a serious matter for a network that is supposed to broadcast fairly. No Spin analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
RT @BillOReilly: My coverage of the brewing @FBI scandal is available for all to see this weekend. Well worth your time &amp; we hope you check…
Here’s the Tip of the Day: if you look people in the eye when speaking with them, you make a favorable impression.		Unless of course you babble on without coming to the point.
Well worth your time. https://t.co/uMbDaiPAE8

But this time the scenario is likely true and it is not impossible that Steve Bannon, fired from the White House, supplied the narrative to the anti/Trump press.		It is an interesting story, but not one with lasting implications. https://t.co/7GsaREtNvD
It is not surprising that President Trump considered firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller last June and it is not an accident that The New York Times is reporting the story that is once again, based on anonymous sources.
Everybody needs a bodyguard! https://t.co/ZMFnsrVqLY
Never in the history of our republic has the press been so corrupt.	https://t.co/riRFzytHwF
RT @NoSpinNews: Thoughts on our new open??? https://t.co/inRQPCTItd
No accident that most national news agencies are downplaying the FBI/missing texts story. The situation could blow up into a major scandal yet the liberal media does not seem interested.  		That is called bias.
Tonight we’ll report on the continuing effort to find out if the @FBI attempted to sabotage the presidential election and damage @realDonaldTrump after he won. 		We have lots of new information so we hope you’ll join us as we provide honest coverage of “Election-gate.” https://t.co/EZEokYPX35
You have to look hard to find media coverage of the growing @FBI scandal that I am calling “Election-gate.” We’ll have the latest on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight! Please check us out.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: hot water melts stress. Feel edgy? Get in the shower or tub and linger.
Where’s my nomination for best supporting Corgi? https://t.co/Pv6ii3qshV
The FBI story is getting more intense.  Did some agents and overseers try to influence the presidential election and after Trump was elected, try to damage him?  Evidence is growing.  Facts and honest analysis of Election-gate tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
RT @NoSpinNews: Last night's show now open for all to watch-- https://t.co/v78a5CZkzt
When the @FBI is beset with corruption allegations and the President himself must deal with a special counsel, we all need to pay close attention. https://t.co/KrwdW25B7O
Evidence so far indicates the @FBI in deep trouble. On last night's @NoSpinNews I analyzed the situation using stark detail. That podcast open to everyone today because of the story’s seriousness, and because we want you to sign up for Premium Membership. https://t.co/4wIjJinEd9
It is interesting to watch the exposition of corruption in our country.  We live in a time of deceit, where self-interest is more important than justice or truth. https://t.co/F6MFgb5FDW
Here’s the Tip of the Day: don’t talk about money with anyone other than your immediate family if it is absolutely necessary. Nothing good comes from yakking about personal finances. Money stimulates jealousy.
Any corgis in Davos? If not, I’m not going! https://t.co/ueIt9n0i5h
RT @NoSpinNews: WORD OF THE DAY: Do not be MERETRICIOUS when writing to Bill@BillOReilly.com. https://t.co/dxAB0Nnbtc
The FBI looks to be in deep trouble.  Two agents investigating Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump apparently were mixing politics into the alleged fact-finding. Now some texts from those agents are missing! Full analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight. A must see.
OK, so what is the Democratic Party's plan for immigration?  They oppose the border wall. They oppose Kate's Law. They oppose ICE raids. They oppose partial amnesty. What's the plan? https://t.co/aURQIGj5Zk
Here’s the Tip of the Day: sugar will kill you. Ration it. Plan your snacks and desserts with discipline. Diabetes is rough.
RT @NoSpinNews: Tonight on the No Spin News, we will get into this and @BillOReilly will put forth a sane immigration plan. https://t.co/H8…
The Democrats say that illegal immigration is the “civil rights issue of our time.” Really? Tough but fair analysis backed with facts on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight!
Last year, Mexico had more than 25,000 murders. Drug cartels control much of the country and smuggle thousands of tons of narcotics into the USA; so much that there’s a heroin epidemic here. Does the Democratic Party have a solution to that?
No matter what party you support, you can’t be happy with Washington. https://t.co/1ZvxB19LUV
Bored with the government shutdown? My column on fake news will revive you. https://t.co/dQ1jrj4ql7
Here’s the Tip of the Day: put stops on all your stocks. Lock in profits.
Major column on fake news just posted on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 for all to read. Plus my radio appearance with @GlennBeck today. Hope you check those out and become a Premium Member.  Take your country back! https://t.co/dQ1jrj4ql7
So your present TV system will soon be obsolete. Like the 8-tracks in the basement.
Tip of the Day: technology will soon present “smart” TV sets to the public where your voice will command what appears on the screen instantly. This will change viewing habits and open up opportunities for companies that can figure out how to market entertainment.
The solution to a government shutdown is a nap. https://t.co/Utdwg4g8Cb
If President @realDonaldTrump cannot win over about 40 percent of women voters, the Republicans will lose the House in November. Can he do it? We’ll talk with @MonicaCrowley tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
Tip of the Day:  very few keep a written diary anymore but having a history of your life is a good thing.  Instead of words, take a meaningful picture with your device every day. At the end of each month, save the pics and dates. You’ll be happy you did that down the road.
Thanks for coming in! https://t.co/7y1GORscMy
What should Americans think about Sen. Jeff Flake comparing Trump to Stalin on press attitude?  Big debate on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight.

.@SenJohnMcCain is a smart guy and a patriot. But he also holds a grudge. In the case of President @realDonaldTrump, a major grudge that has affected the entire country. https://t.co/QxJUmLFWPs
Here’s the Tip of the Day: doing what you enjoy is a life-extender.  Clint Eastwood is 87. He has a new film coming out! Rest my case.
Corgis don’t say bad words although we think them. https://t.co/N8vsDvxIwj
The liberal bastion of California has the highest poverty rate in the Union. And the reason ties directly into Trump’s negative assessment of some third world countries. Provocative but accurate analysis tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0!  Hope you check it out.
Major report tonight on how President @realDonaldTrump is governing.  Is he looking out for you?  Check it out on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
Once elected, a president is supposed to represent all citizens.  But Trump and Obama have largely rejected that axiom. Instead, they play to their constituencies leaving millions of Americans unattended. https://t.co/OgnSltoxXk
Presidents Trump and Obama have an important thing in common and few Americans know what it is even though our lives have been affected.	https://t.co/0yG0y0qjBG
When will they name a football team “the Corgis?”  I’m waiting!!!! https://t.co/hfB3rLySCz
All quiet on the Trump front today.  Can it stay that way? Check out my column on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
But a calculated miscue, something you’ve thought about that turns bad; there you need to make some restitution in addition to the sorry. That is if want to command respect.
Tip of the Day: most mistakes are accidental. A bad reaction to a pop up situation or a careless word that may hurt another person. Apologize immediately for those and expect forgiveness.
According to the daily tracking poll put out by Rasmussen, President Trump’s job approval has risen to 46 percent.  That reinforces my point about his rhetoric. Please read my just posted column on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
Can anyone be fair and provide perspective on the Trump statement? We can! Check out my column on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C! https://t.co/HCXkXPfUus
So now the nation must endure another round of “the President is a racist.” 		The hate-Trumpers are rejoicing over the latest Presidential mistake because it further marginalizes a leader who has momentum on the economy and national security.		https://t.co/KJxtvFS1MF
Mass hysteria has broken out in America over President Trump’s "s---hole" remark. Is this the end for Mr. Trump in the court of public opinion?  I will tell you the unvarnished truth on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. Check it out now. https://t.co/7whMYQsgyk
President @realDonaldTrump should finally come to grips with the fact that he must think about the repercussions of what he says. In the past, his stream of conscious rhetoric has helped him achieve success.  		But now it is harming him and the nation.
The Trump-loathing media, already heavily invested in portraying him as a white supremacy advocate, is dancing in the streets over this. His political opposition, damaged by a surging economy, now has yet another attack vehicle - a diversion away from issues.
The continuing problem with the President’s tough guy rhetoric is that it allows interpretation. Countries, of course, are inhabited by people. In this case, people of color. So by criticizing a country, you can be accused of maligning its people even if that wasn’t your intent.
It would be inconceivable for a person in the President’s position to intentionally ridicule millions of people for no reason, would it not?
The truth is that Haiti, El Salvador, and certain countries in Africa are troubled places where the misery index is off the chart. That’s what the President was describing in his "s---hole" remark, I believe.
President Trump’s description of some third world countries as "s---holes" has reignited the left’s contention that he is a racist.  So let’s examine the situation without vitriol, which should come as a welcome relief. https://t.co/7whMYQsgyk
Tip of the Day: Trump apparently denigrated certain poor nations saying “(s-hole) countries.” Big mistake as he was in front of people from outside the WH. Whenever you describe someone/something in a sharply negative way &amp; others hear it- word will get out. So don’t do it. Ever.
RT @NoSpinNews: Tonight on the No Spin News, we’ll analyze the growing trend to personalize the “truth” and tell you how that is damaging A…
Does anyone remember Rin Tin Tin?   What was the kid’s name on that show? https://t.co/WAU9vDBjht
Should President @realDonaldTrump have ignored the book that brought down Steve Bannon? If he did, that would have given the book credibility. Now, the book is a partisan issue and the President usually wins those. More on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. Check it out.
How important is the truth to you? Do you get angry when someone misleads you? Do you yourself say things that aren’t true? The difference between good and not so good people is whether you value the truth and fight against the temptation to distort it. https://t.co/68I0ACxopR
Tip of the Day: there's literally nothing on TV these days. Get some paperback books. Spenser for Hire novels by @Robert_B_Parker are fun as are Dave Robicheaux books by @JamesLeeBurke. Nonfiction? The Killing series! If you want entertainment cold winter nights - there you go.
Welsh Corgis need amnesty. https://t.co/aAuHNm0hMa
The economy is doing well and Mr. Trump can take advantage of that to get other things done if he just tones it down a bit. Place your bets now! https://t.co/g52QhaU0bI
Big press conference today by President Trump. He’s got momentum after yesterday’s televised immigration discussion. Media will come after him. We’ll have the liveliest analysis on the planet on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight. A must see!
WORD OF THE DAY: Do not PALTER when writing to Bill@BillOReilly.com. https://t.co/C15he5ReLO
Tip of the Day: we all need a designated listener who we can speak w/ about difficult things, troubling situations. A person who loves us &amp; will give honest, thoughtful advice. Not easy to find - trust is eroding in America. But if you have a confidant, your life will be better.
Didn’t see any presidential dementia in the White House meeting on immigration today, did you? Mr. Trump looked to be in charge. Full analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 @NoSpinNews tonight.
@realDonaldTrump When a commentator on @NBC can go on television spouting vicious nonsense about a serious condition like dementia, critical mass has been reached.
The smear that President @realDonaldTrump is dealing with dementia is a complete outrage and should be condemned by all Americans. It is a sign of the times that there are no more boundaries in the media when it comes to personal attacks. https://t.co/GlnrDeN3OW
WORD OF THE DAY: Do not be a BLATHERSKITE when writing to Bill@BillOReilly.com. https://t.co/Ltmp5F4yUQ
Here’s the Tip of the Day: if you can listen to calm music you will go to sleep faster.  For most Americans, sleep comes anywhere from five to 30 minutes once your head hits the pillow.  But you have to actually listen to the melodies - not think of a terrorist attack.
Does @Oprah like Corgis? https://t.co/HmA6X6q69V
Has there ever been an American more perfectly positioned than @Oprah to achieve ultimate power?		The answer is no. 		https://t.co/AMS5SDUGls
Oprah Winfrey for President! She could win in 2020 because she has a secret weapon. We’ll analyze the incredible situation tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
If @Oprah wants to run for President in 2020, the Democratic Party will be thrilled to have her. She skillfully played the male misconduct card, rallying women who feel marginalized, then pivoted into praising the press as protectors of the realm. https://t.co/WIvVSY6CYE
The absolute best analysis of why President Trump says what he says is on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. Talk about a stable genius! https://t.co/WfjUDiHNzb

President Trump should only trust Corgis.  We don’t write books. https://t.co/8aoY5RQRG0
Here’s the Tip of the Day: if you remember a book you read a long time ago and liked / reread it.  Chances are you’ll like it better the second time because memory fades.
Want to know the inside story of the Trump book?  Why the President finds himself facing these kinds of things?  I’ve known him for 30 years. Check out my analysis - now open to all this weekend. https://t.co/q0yPUdLpEc
Sending the best to Alex Trebek, one of the really good guys in television. He’s recovering from a fall. Rarely has anyone performed so well for so long on TV!
Last night on the @NoSpinNews, I analyzed the way Donald Trump often speaks and presents himself. My opinion is based on hundreds of conversations with the man over a nearly 30 year period. Members of my website can watch here: https://t.co/q0yPUdLpEc
With the massive amount of attention being given to the new book on the Trump White House, perspective is nonexistent with one exception: https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
Tip of the Day: food &amp; gas take our cash. So budget for it. There are big discounts at places like @Costco on food. Figure out a reasonable monthly number for food and gas then stick to it. 		That will help you save 10% of what you make. Do that and you’ll be in excellent shape.

Trump vs. Bannon. Media loves this salacious story. But what does it really mean? @BernardGoldberg and I will analyze tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0's @NoSpinNews. Honest reporting in a world of deceit. Please check it out.
Mr. Trump is a stream of consciousness guy, a man who says whatever is on his mind. He has no inner editing voice, that I can tell you as an ear witness! https://t.co/OCfcnRL06v
The media is crazed over a new book that dishes some dirt about the Trump White House, but I say so what? As someone who has known the President for 30 years, I’m not surprised by anything he says in his private moments.
WORD OF THE DAY: Do not be PAWKY when writing to Bill@BillOReilly.com. https://t.co/DgmNERQWVn
If @MittRomney runs, he is going to win. He'd be good for the Republican Party. Big @Newsmax interview on Romney, Bannon, and @realDonaldTrump's big button: https://t.co/DWImR1opXq
Here’s the Tip of the Day: buck the unhealthy trend of last minute planning. Thinking ahead can save you grief and money. I am planning my summer travel now. Can always change things if the need arises.
More turbulence in Trump world. Steve Bannon saying bad things about the administration - the President striking back. Does it mean anything?  Check out the @NoSpinNews on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight.
It is very strange that President Trump is criticizing the Justice Department yet not ordering Attorney General Sessions to do certain things that might benefit the country. https://t.co/hr6d29GsgQ

This weekend, everyone can access the @NoSpinNews specials so you can see what we offer on a daily basis. Our resolution is to continue looking out for you! https://t.co/MMX73u9YTW
Here’s the Tip of the Day: give unwanted Christmas and Hanukkah gifts to your local homeless shelter or church. Also, clothes you don’t wear anymore. Poor folks will benefit from your kindness.
Analysis of news operations shows fact finding has been replaced by ideology. Sick of that? Try the @NoSpinNews on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. It’s free to all this week. Hope you check it out.
...therefore, loyalty and honesty are in decline all over the world.  So, trust few and be very careful what you put in writing.
Tip of the Day: with the rise of devices, personal interactions are falling. Texting is replacing conversation, that means a distance is being created between people. It is far easier to deal with someone when you don’t have to see a negative reaction...

Two college professors say President Trump’s campaign to say Merry Christmas is designed to promote “white supremacy.” Tis the season to be crazy. Analysis on tonight's @NoSpinNews on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.

RT @BernardGoldberg: Journalists put out false information about collusion with the Russians because that’s what they want to believe — tha…
There is pressure building against the FBI. Some Republicans in Congress are looking into allegations the Bureau botched the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russian collusion probe. In 2018, this will be a hot story. https://t.co/r212GdUvys
The FBI may be in serious trouble.  Catch my analysis tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
WORD OF THE DAY: Do not be a POLTROON when writing to Bill@BillOReilly.com. https://t.co/TlaoaKwWf2
Here’s the Tip of the Day: adopting an abandoned dog or cat will bring strong and good karma into your home. If you can’t do that, please donate to an animal shelter near you.
Whether or not the new tax law helps the country will not be known for a while. But it’s worth a try because the only way wages will rise is if business expands. That’s it. Cutting corporate taxes might lead to that.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: many clothing companies have stealthily cut back on material, so order your stuff one size larger than you are. I am 6’4”, 210 pounds and an XL used to do it. Not anymore. Now XXL.
Why is the Pope so angry with journalists? @BernardGoldberg and I will discuss it tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.

RT @NoSpinNews: Some will holler fake news because @CNN is so fervently anti-Trump but @BillOReilly thinks there’s something else in play.…
New @CNN poll has President Trump’s approval rating at 35%. If the economy continues to improve, his poll numbers will rise into the mid 40s. But that’s about all he can hope for - the constant media bashing takes a huge toll, especially on Americans who do not pay attention.
WORD OF THE DAY: Do not be a TROGLODYTE when writing to Bill@BillOReilly.com. https://t.co/wbPRvMtOln
Here’s the Tip of the Day: if someone you know insults you or does something inconsiderate, wait at least 12 hours before replying. Then put your feelings on the record in a thoughtful way. No insults. You’ll get far more satisfaction that way.
We are LIVE on Facebook assessing the performance of President @realDonaldTrump's administration to date. We hope you will tune in! https://t.co/qQrVeQXztq
I’m listening to O’Reilly on Facebook Live at 2:05p ET.  If you miss it - go to https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. https://t.co/1Fj8igOt79
There should be a criminal investigation into whether Americans are being offered money by lawyers to smear other Americans - tax evasion may be involved. We’ll analyze tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. Also, I will assess the Trump admin on Facebook Live 2:05 ET today.
What‘s the true story about the Trump admin? Is it governing well or hurting the folks? Facebook Live tomorrow at 2:05 ET - I will tell you the truth about President Trump and his crew. Then at night on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C, we’ll continue the discussion. See you tomorrow!

Sean Hannity doing a good job on the Lisa Bloom paying women for allegations story which is ultra important. Please watch @seanhannity tonight.
I told you guys from the very beginning that many allegations were false and politically driven. There is big money behind trying to destroy Mr. Trump, me and others.
The lawyer who attacked me with phony charges, Lisa Bloom, now exposed for arranging payments to women. Please read this devastating article on @thehill - https://t.co/FZaqdQiCXO
Here’s the Tip of the Day: when visiting a restaurant or store always be polite but know you are entitled to good service. If that does not happen, quietly tell the manager and leave; even if the food has been ordered.

Big trouble for the FBI as there are now four officials who may have brought biases into the Clinton email investigation and the Russia collusion deal. First class, fair analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight as well as the Alabama election.
WORD OF THE DAY: Do not be a BLATHERSKITE when writing to Bill@BillOReilly.com. https://t.co/TzGIytY0TE
Beyond shameful that the American people are being deceived by the national press. Putting aside the major reporting mistakes by the media recently, yesterday’s attacks on President Trump by three women - a prime example of how the media consciously misreports important stories.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: never, ever give anyone your phone number on the internet. It will be sold to marketers who will drive you nuts. Protect your privacy!
More subterfuge from the hate-Trump media. Check out the @NoSpinNews on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 for honest and clear analysis.
Another disturbing day in America. It looks like a Muslim terrorist tried to bomb the New York City subway system. He failed but injured a few people and created chaos. Tonight's @NoSpinNews - @JGilliam_SEAL will join us to discuss.
Due to the unfolding terror story in NYC today, I will postpone my Facebook LIVE event. Stand by for the new date and time.
Monday at 2:05pm ET, I will be live on Facebook analyzing the Trump admin with No Spin. Both good and bad. We hope you check that out but if you miss it, we will post on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C - where we have the best Christmas &amp; Hanukkah deals in the history of civilization!
The hits just keep on coming. A @WashingtonPost reporter has to apologize for a phony photo he put out of the Trump rally in Florida. This after @CNN completely falsified a story on the Russian deal. 		The national press is falling apart.
Tip of the Day: to combat depression or a hopeless feeling, use a simple technique: every time a negative thought reaches your mind- accept it. Then replace it with a positive thought. Takes discipline to do that but if you master the process you will be healthier in every way.
WORD OF THE DAY: Do not be a MOONCALF when writing to Bill@BillOReilly.com. https://t.co/aQaJVgeeKH
Here’s the Tip of the Day: carve out some alone time this Christmas and Hanukkah season. Think about someone you can directly help. Then do it.

New FBI chief Christopher Wray dodged many important questions about political bias within the FBI. Disappointing. The bureau’s reputation is taking a beating. Honest analysis tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
WORD OF THE DAY: Don't be IGNOMINIOUS when writing to bill@billoreilly.com. https://t.co/D6ptyWJN69
Tip of the Day: when a phone solicitor calls you, do not engage. Politely say:		“Sorry, but we do not do business over the phone. Please send me something in the mail. Bye.”		No edge in your voice, folks are just trying to make a living. But your time is too valuable for that.
Al Franken doomed. How should Americans process all the allegations in play? We’ll deal with it tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.

Things are rapidly developing in the battle between President Trump &amp; Special Counsel Mueller. The Justice Department, threatened with contempt of Congress, will give the House Intel Committee anti-Trump emails allegedly written by one of Mueller’s top investigators on the case.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: Johnny Mathis is one of the great American singers. His Christmas stuff is classic. You’ll like it.
The last few days have been good ones for President Trump especially because Special Counsel Mueller is now in a tight spot. Find out why tonight on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
Another anonymous source trashes President Trump in a left wing magazine and the media quotes the story even though it has no blankin’ idea if the source even exists. This is so low Antman looks down on it. Get a dose of honest reporting on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: no longer can Americans expect truth-telling. Be very skeptical about what you hear, read, and even when speaking with neighbors. False witness has overwhelmed honesty.
Why did CNN recycle an old story about a woman accusing President Trump? It’s part of a media plan. Honest analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tonight.
According to a new poll, Americans who lean Democrat outnumber those who are simpatico with Republicans by 7 points.  But why?  Find out tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
President Trump should expect a big uptick in media attacks after tax reform passes. It will be brutal. The President should read Killing England to see how George Washington handled things when attacks on him were launched.
Harvard Law Professor @AlanDersh has an interesting column on the Flynn plea posted on @TheHill. You might want to check this out as well as analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. https://t.co/RgxPN8KWQ6
Sad that the Kate Steinle verdict was knocked out of the news by the Flynn plea. The leftist media did not want to cover it and now they don’t have to. We have plenty of insightful analysis about what really happened to Kate on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. Hope you check it out.
Big trouble: the Russian Ambassador took me for a walk. https://t.co/Ulfwrwskjb
Here’s the Tip of the Day:  when you hear a question that is purely speculation, like “will Mueller indict President Trump?” - turn the TV set off. Don’t subject yourself to partisan fools. Go for facts - check out https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
Media hysteria over the Flynn guilty plea for lying.  Best take is Jonathan Turley writing for @thehill, where I also have a column on Kate Steinle. Please check those out and visit https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
Spoke with @glennbeck about the Steinle murder case this morning. What a disgrace that something like this could happen in America. https://t.co/MUtJRT4asj
Two and a half years ago, I began covering the Steinle murder case and quickly came to the conclusion that politics had killed Kate along with the bullet. https://t.co/cQK11jqoP9
The Kate Steinle verdict should lead to big changes. Check out my analysis on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0. https://t.co/V1pQ6lUwVp
It is now on Attorney General Sessions to charge Kate Steinle’s killer with serious immigration violations. This is a litmus test for Mr. Sessions.
Prayers for the Steinle family. Feds should immediately charge the thug with a variety of immigration crimes. What’s happening to America?
Kate Steinle’s killer found not guilty of murder. Not since OJ Simpson has this kind of verdict been dropped. At the very least manslaughter - he had a stolen gun! Awful.
Here’s the Tip of the Day: fresh breath will make life easier. The best mouth wash in the marketplace is @SmartMouth. I have no association with the company - just looking out for you.
Nancy Pelosi stabs John Conyers. 		Et tu, Nancy? 		Analysis on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C tonight.
It would behoove (Word of the Day) President Trump to stop tweeting about non-governmental issues for a while. Attacking specific media people, retweeting dubious material - now hurting the President because it diverts attention from his economic success &amp; gives his enemies ammo.
How should fair-minded Americans think about the constant allegations of bad behavior by powerful men?  A special report on The No Spin News tonight.  Please check it out on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C
RT @AlanaKStewart: As you said on your podcast, not one report on this in the mainstream media! https://t.co/dLAIXY8667
Here’s the Tip of the Day: don’t send Christmas cards if you believe Christmas is not important. And if you do send cards, write a short personal note inside. Those printed messages are meaningless without a personal touch. Take the time.
Looks like tax reform will pass the Senate. That will be a victory for President Trump. If that happens, expect a series of vicious attacks from the hate-Trump media. And they will be very personal.  More on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C tonight.
It is now established that fanatics have intimidated the press and politicians in this country. That is dangerous. The lack of courage on the part of journalists and elected officials is appalling.
Asking Americans not to do business with someone based on skin color is flat out racist. https://t.co/jSZj0l43RV
Black Lives Matter is urging people not to buy holiday gifts from white run businesses. Of course most companies employ African-Americans and such a boycott might hurt them but, hey, when has BLM ever thought in a logical way?
Here’s the Tip of the Day: don’t even speak to morons. If you assess a person that way, avoid all contact. 		You can thank me by visiting https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. Great things going on there.
President Trump on the verge of a big victory with the tax reform bill. Should he go silent publicly until the vote? As @SarahPalinUSA once said: you betcha.
What would the real Pocahontas think of President @realDonaldTrump using her name to mock Senator Elizabeth Warren? Would she think the use of her name is a slur? We’ll have thoughtful analysis on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C tonight and Pocahontas would like it!
Americans are the most generous people on earth!
Tip of the Day: Tuesday is “giving” day in America. Focus on a charity that you respect. Two that have earned my trust are https://t.co/eVfYHtbw4R which buys high-tech wheelchairs for wounded vets, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation that supports children with debilitating diseases.
There are good deals, and there are great deals. We have both in the https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 Christmas Store. Check us out! https://t.co/hdmolXKVFY

The picture of Malia Obama smoking should remind us all that privacy is a thing of the past.  Once you leave your house, you can and will be photographed constantly by security cameras and other people.  Young Malia was betrayed - what else is new.
Here’s the tip of the day:  tip 20 percent this holiday season and take good care of your garbage haulers and anyone else who provides you service.  Be generous - it always comes back.
Take your country back, visit https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C this weekend where there is a special edition of The No Spin News for all to see.

Here’s the Tip of the day on this Thanksgiving evening:  give an old friend a call or email.  Someone you haven’t contacted in a while.  Good memories enhance all our lives!
Even on Thanksgiving the hate-Trump media can’t take a break.  Headline on Politico: “How Donald Trump Ruined Thanksgiving.”  Pathetic.  Stand down for 24 hours.  Yeech.
Holly sends Thanksgiving wishes.  Looking forward to leftovers and the special podcast on https://t.co/rryWmzeOZa. https://t.co/ijcazxeOVt
Tip of the Day: If a person with you at Thanksgiving gets rowdy or combative, start to interview them. Ask about what’s going on in their life. That will immediately calm them down. This will work unless the person is a complete loon. More wisdom on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0
The Tip of the Day is back!  Before eating Thanksgiving dinner, drink a glass of water. That will slow down your appetite so you don’t gorge. The more time you take eating, the better your body will be.  For more great information, check out https://t.co/rryWmzeOZa

Trump has every right to call out the ingratitude of LaVar Ball. The man’s son was spared the Chinese criminal justice system because Trump intervened. Mr. Ball then insulted Trump. Anyone who defends Mr. Ball is misguided in the extreme. More on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0 tomorrow.
Media Matters and CNN teaming up to try and knock Sean Hannity off the air.  Despicable and unAmerican.  Freedom of speech again under fire.

If you are seeking honest information, you will have to hunt for it. Opinions are replacing hard facts in the national discourse. Today's Message of the Day – https://t.co/BhsNCMgE7t
Significant change occurring in the way Americans consume news. Nightly network news broadcasts yield very little influence anymore. Cable news, largely partisan. With hours of air time to fill, cable news operations are flailing.
Tomorrow I will be answering questions LIVE on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. 7pm eastern.		Premium Members ask the questions, but everyone can watch the show. 		Tune in here tomorrow: https://t.co/lOyaKLs1SS https://t.co/U25c8vl320

Sean Hannity again being attacked by Media Matters, the far left propaganda group that starts sponsor boycotts. Tonight on the @NoSpinNews we will analyze the growing extortion industry that threatens freedom of speech.
Thinking about my father, grandfather, and all the other American veterans today. Understand how much was given by so many. Wish the anti-American crew would get the big picture.
Is the entire country falling apart? Could be. Please check out the Message of the Day on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. https://t.co/sY8fjOMr5q
In America, we now have trial by media. There is no going back to innocent until proven guilty. All allegations will be treated as facts. And the country will pay a huge price for that.
It is simply impossible to know the truth about all the allegations flying around the country involving famous people. Every American should clamor for justice in all cases of alleged wrongdoing - that’s a given.
RT @NoSpinNews: Tonight on https://t.co/7Exs3PTrY5 we will put the song into historical perspective and analyze why the NAACP is doing what…
So now the NAACP says the Star Spangled Banner, our National Anthem, is racist! We’ll analyze this closely tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. Take your country back.
Big lie being promoted by the California chapter of the NAACP and that is the false assertion that the Star Spangled Banner, our National Anthem, is a racist song.		That is simply outrageous.
Is fake news out of control? We’ll have major analysis on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C's @NoSpinNews this evening. We hope you sign up for the newscast and other worthy things. You’ll get a FREE COPY of Killing England if you do!
On tonight’s @NoSpinNews, we’ll talk about a new strategy that Donald Trump might consider in order to save his party.
Tax reform - vital to the GOP.  The party must get it passed or Democrats will win next year’s midterm elections by a wide margin.
Americans admire achievement.  @GOP has little this year.
The Republican leadership, including President @realDonaldTrump, should understand that voters are now cynical - disgusted with both parties.  Only positive legislation will turn that around.
Wake up call for the Republican Party. Voters in Virginia and New Jersey elect Democratic Governors. GOP better pass tax cuts or midterm elections will be grim.
If Ed Gillespie (R) is elected Virginia Governor today, political landscape will change. Already weakened Dem Party will become even weaker.
RT @NoSpinNews: THE PRICE OF FREEDOM. Our freedom dictates that police cannot intervene unless a crime is committed. Troubled people have i…

In non-free societies, individuals can be taken into custody for almost any reason.		Not in America.
No matter how bizarre a life you lead, you cannot be sanctioned by criminal authority unless you violate a statute.
NEWS FLASH: terrorists and psychopaths will always be able to secure weapons no matter what legislation is passed.
My freedom comment is simply this: troubled people have individual rights. Authorities cannot restrain you until you break the law.
After the massacre in Vegas, I said horrendous crimes are the cost of freedom. Immediately, the dimwits on the far left started braying.
The violent crime rate in the USA has fallen to near historic lows, falling by more than 50% in the last two decades.
People the world over think we're a violent society where guns are sacrosanct &amp; not even church goers are safe.		The truth is far different.
The outrage in South Texas is revolting and affects all Americans because it puts this country in such a bad light.
Sean Hannity’s movie “Let There Be Light” doing very well. Secular-Progressives are furious. A big win for the country!
Spoke w @GlennBeck about Clinton/Fusion GPS. LISTEN: https://t.co/FKAbG8cVX8
Is Hillary Clinton in real trouble this time with shocking presidential campaign accusations? Very possibly.
Bergdahl hurt his fellow soldiers, some severely. He has suffered but not in proportion to them. He should have served time.

Condolence letters are sent to all military families that lose loved ones.  So am I wrong in thinking this is not a big deal?

@realDonaldTrump First: Senate would have to approve a new AG &amp; more than a few Republicans, who now support Sessions, would likely give @POTUS a hard time.

Mr. Trump needs friends in his administration. Sessions was one of them. Now?
Not sure why President Trump went after AG Sessions. He met with Russians as a senator, had to recuse himself in the investigation.
John McCain a patriot and straight shooter. He loves his country and sacrificed greatly for it. Thoughts and prayers for him and his family.

Trump, Jr. smart to release emails. Tabloid guy set him up w Russian lawyer who promised Hillary dirt. She didn't deliver. That's the story.
It is beyond tedious to absorb the news this summer.  I get three newspapers delivered in the morning, I rarely learn anything reading them.

Tough, fair and compassionate analysis tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C.
Everyone should pray for Steve Scalise and the other four victims of the brutal political shooting this morning.
We will sort out this awful situation on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C tonight - the No Spin News will be open to everyone this night only, 7 ET.
Initial reports on the shooting of 4 men including Congressman Scalise say the suspect, shot dead by police, was a Trump-hater.
Full and fair coverage tonight on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. https://t.co/dr7VzSvmCa
All victims are expected to survive but decent discourse might not as fanatics are politicizing the crime. Shooter was wounded by police.
Speculation running wild over motive of the 66 year old man who shot five in Virginia including Congressman Scalise.
(there would be evidence by this time if it had happened)
Senator Cotton says there is no evidence of any collusion between Trump campaign and Russians after six months of investigation.
Hearing going nowhere.  Sessions not giving Trump-haters anything.  That's what happens when there are NO FACTS to speak about.
Sessions drank water during that exposition.
Senator Lankford (R-OK) points out that former AG Eric Holder refused to discuss the Fast &amp; Furious discussions with President Obama.
Senator King trying to embarrass Sessions re: his refusal to discuss conversations with @POTUS. King gives up. No one has rattled Sessions.
The AG once again says his negative opinion of Comey began with the Clinton emails and had nothing to do with Russia.
@POTUS Sessions shrugs.
Senator Henrich (D) tells Sessions he is impeding the Congressional investigation into Russia by not describing his conversations w @POTUS.
Sessions says Comey violated protocol by not bringing his concerns on the Flynn matter to the deputy AG.
It's clear at this point that Sessions did not like how Comey handled Hillary Clinton and that's why he wanted Comey replaced.
Sessions says there is too much leaking at @TheJusticeDept - a slap at Comey.
Feistiness here. Wyden accuses Sessions of violating his recusal by writing the anti-Comey letter.  Sessions shrugs it off.
@POTUS Sessions denies stonewalling saying he's following standard privacy guidelines, scolds Wyden for using innuendo against him.
Democratic Senator Wyden accuses Sessions of stonewalling because he won't talk about @POTUS conversations. https://t.co/nb3Lwt8zIR
At this point in the hearing, no news has been made. Sessions says Comey did say he felt uncomfortable with @POTUS discussing General Flynn.
Sessions says Comey showed a lack of discipline.
Sen. Feinstein cites Sessions criticizing Comey in a letter and AG says there were problems dating back to the Clinton email investigation.
Sessions will not answer whether he spoke with @POTUS about Comey, effectively shutting down the Democratic senators.
Sessions says he will not comment on conversations with @POTUS citing Justice Department policy.
Democratic Senator Mark Warner asks about Special Prosecutor Mueller - Sessions says he has confidence in Mueller. Would not remove him.
Comey denied receiving notification of Sessions' recusal. AG says he sent him an email. More suspicion on Comey, as Sessions has the email.
Boring Q&amp;A between Chairman Burr and Sessions.  Nothing new.  Sessions says he had to recuse himself, etc.
Comey did not mention that in his testimony.
Sessions didn't like the job Comey was doing running the FBI, says he told Comey to limit WH contact over the Russian investigation.
The Attorney General says he has not received any info on the Russian investigation since his recusal in early March.
Franken consistently distorts the truth.
Sessions scorching Sen. Al Franken who has insinuated the AG misled the country during his confirmation hearing.  I believe Sessions...
Sessions also says he never discussed any campaign issue with any Russian ever.
AG Sessions says he had no third meeting with Russians at the Mayflower Hotel as James Comey asserted.  Someone is not telling the truth.
Then at 7p eastern - the No Spin News on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.

Dems fervently hoping for anything against the Prez.  Republicans the opposite.
Amazingly boring analysis of Trump/Comey on TV Sunday morning.  Same old.
President Trump would be wise to declare victory and not engage any Russian stuff for a while.
Achieving those things will damage the anti-Trump forces.
President Trump's base remains intact, but they are looking for a new health care law, tax cuts, and a southern border barrier of some kind.
Comey’s leak confession fascinating in a number of ways. Read my column for The Hill - https://t.co/KU9bInPmYA
Mr. Trump would be wise to forget Mr. Comey, and devote his time &amp; energy to getting a new health law passed.
Looks like the country is shrugging off the Comey testimony.  No effect on the stock market, little social fallout.
Are you serious, people? It was a huge and possibly illegal breach. Check out the truth on the No Spin News on https://t.co/fqUvO5EEW0.
Some are saying that Comey saying he secretly gave The NY Times a memo chronicling a private conversation with Trump was not a "leak."
Comey also says the President wanted to know the factual truth and told him to get it. Paging Sherlock Holmes!
That damages the President because no one knows exactly why Trump was disenchanted.  The innuendo of a coverup is there.
Comey says he was fired "because of the way he conducted the Russian investigation".
Clearly, Comey is no fan of Trump and the big bombshell is that Comey leaked bad stuff about Trump to The New York Times.
Comey was clear Trump himself was not investigated re: Russians and the Prez wanted to know if anyone of his team had done something wrong.
Hearing is pretty much done.  The President took hits on Flynn but nothing that was not already known.
Comey says Lynch was playing politics and it made him "queasy".
Comey says many stories about the Russian investigation are wrong. He says Obama AG Lynch ordered him to downplay the Clinton email probe.
Outrageous for an FBI director to do this when he hasn't even given the memos to the Senate committee. Leaking anyone?
Comey gave his memos of conversations with the Prez to his "friend" who gave them to the New York Times.
The gist: if Comey was so disturbed by Trump's take on Flynn &amp; didn't want to be alone w/ the Prez why did he continue private calls w/ him?
Sen. Burr hammering Comey for being disingenuous.
Major development!  If Trump knew about that, that was cause to fire Comey.
Comey admits he asked a friend to leak his conversation w/ Trump about Flynn to a reporter. A bombshell the sluggish Senators are ignoring.
Comey talked w/ Justice Dept officials re: Trump's sympathy for Flynn &amp; that it was inappropriate for Prez to speak with FBI on the subject.
@POTUS Comey says Trump was very upset about allegations against him and the FBI shot down those allegations.
Comey reiterates that he told @POTUS he was not under investigation three times. Says he wanted to reassure Prez the FBI was not after him.
Comey says he would not back off Flynn and that might be why he was removed.  That hurts Trump but it is speculative.
Senator Wyden, anti-Trump, says Comey's firing was "an abuse of presidential power".
Comey tells @marcorubio he wanted to know if his people did anything wrong with Russia, wanted it "all to come out." That helps Trump.
Comey obviously did not want to alienate the President and did not push back about Flynn.  Hurts Comey's investigative credibility.
At this point, I think Comey is telling the truth but he seems VERY confused about Trump's intent.
Comey says Trump was frustrated by emphasis on Russia, wanted FBI to clear his name publicly. Discussed with advisors, kept quiet about it.
Comey: Trump did not order him to stop investigating Flynn, "stunned" Trump wanted him to go easy on Flynn, did not engage prez on the issue
@nytimes That's what fake news is.
Comey says he was not allowed for security reasons to directly refute a false report in @nytimes about surveillance but the story was bull.
Comey says Trump asked him to stay as FBI chief but believes the Prez wanted something in return. He has not said what that something was.
Comey says all his aides agreed there was no investigation of President @realDonaldTrump himself and he told Trump that.
That indicates tension from the beginning in their relationship.
Comey says he was concerned that Trump might "lie" about their conversations, so he wrote memos after their meetings.
Comey says that disturbed him.  Fascinating.
Comey says former AG Loretta Lynch asked him not to refer to the Hillary Clinton email deal as "an investigation" but as a "matter".
Comey says he doesn't know Trump's intent when speaking about General Michael Flynn's situation but found the conversation disturbing.
Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) getting Comey on the record. Comey says Trump did not pressure him to drop Russian investigation. That's big.
Comey says Trump is lying when he said FBI is not being run efficiently.  Comey is angry with the President.
Comey opens saying he was confused by the reason he was fired by President Trump.  Comey says Trump told him he was doing a great job.
Warner is acting like a prosecutor and is convicting Mr. Trump before the questioning even begins.  Not fair.
It is "collusion" to influence the election that is being investigated.
Senator Mark Warner, a democrat who hates the President, talking about "contacts" with Russians by Trump campaign. That is not at issue.
RT @BernardGoldberg: Watching the Comey Show.  Why do I think just about everyone, esp Dems, already have their minds made up? #ComeyHearing
I will tweet throughout with, I hope, fair perspective.
Keep in mind that the Senate interrogators will ask their questions not to get info but to either convict the President or acquit him.
Big day on Capitol Hill. I will be live tweeting the Comey testimony so alert the media! Wait, I am the media... please alert your friends.
Hoping something will happen is not obstruction or any other kind of crime.  Bad judgment is in play here.  So far, nothing else.
A sitting President has absolute authority to ask about any investigation as long as the Prez does not interfere in fact gathering process.
As predicted, TV coverage of the pre-Comey testimony is hysterical.  Here's one simple fact:
Never thought I'd say this but I will be "live tweeting" during the hearing tomorrow...
