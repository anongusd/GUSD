“Homeowners will move on average of 5 times in their life. As disabilities worsen and families move, #veterans will likely need to use portions of their $81K grant on more than 3 occasions” Ryan says to members of the @HouseVetAffairs https://t.co/oSwbZnlqvH
Ryan is a double amputee who lost his right arm and left leg while serving in Iraq. WATCH his live testimony on the @DeptVetAffairs Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant Program. https://t.co/crUbFQmAW6
"Specially Adapted Housing grants should be a lifelong program for lifelong injuries.” Read more on Ryan's testimony and @WWP's review and recommendations for improvements regarding the @DeptVetAffairs Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant Program here: https://t.co/crUbFQmAW6 https://t.co/EZpOpa8hGY
"Two of the most significant areas we've identified to help improve the SAH Grant Program: 1. Eliminate the 3-time use cap. 2. Allow previous beneficiaries the opportunity to refresh their SAH grant history once every 10 years."	Ryan to members of the @HouseVetAffairs https://t.co/3LYcoRdrEC
"Today, I speak to you as someone who has used the Specially Adapted Housing grant, and I hope my story can help frame the issues before the Subcommittee." WATCH Ryan’s live testimony here: https://t.co/crUbFQmAW6
