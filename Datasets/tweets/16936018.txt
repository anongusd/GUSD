@DavidBoylan15 We've got an idea for those discouraging moments: https://t.co/uyWZMNL0pS
@IgnatiusJR Wouldn't that be amazing?
@MegazonianYT You're welcome!
@coneyislndchaos We like to speak sweet things.
@Isaacsutton @kohsutton Not sure if we would call ourselves gurus. We just strongly believe that "If you don't have anything nice to say..."
@MurrayFullerton You're welcome, "Dr."
Being grateful DOES NOT mean you act fake and pretend that life isn't full of discouraging moments.		Being grateful DOES mean you know there is more to life than discouragement and when little joys come‚Äîthey are worth celebrating.
@brooklynbarwick @Twitter Nope. Never.
@Twitter for sweets? We got you
@MsWonderland That's an epic stash!
@MrsEquistina It‚Äôs good to maintain boundaries between His and Hers!
@Target That's good because all those carts will need ~options~
@rsd4444 @steak_umm That's a great follow-up question: Do brands have memes or do memes have brands?
@iBUYPOWER Those are also the correct choice.
@steak_umm Gonna need a moment to process this one.
@TerrenceRooks It is one of several correct choices.
Oatmeal Creme Pies https://t.co/87yqog3gzU
@BleighBeverly We love this. A lot.
@YearOfTheViolet @Dustinb_12 First, you tap the heart icon.		Second, you tap the arrows icon.		Voila! You've pressed for both options!
@BleighBeverly Did you make it?!
@HorrorMovieBBQ SOUNDS LIKE SUCCESS
@The_TNTSRT Nope. Nothing.
@HorrorMovieBBQ Has it worked?
RT if you've got a secret Little Debbie snack cakes stash. 		Like if your stash is public.
@geauxcrimson You are a man of innovation.
When is the best time for an afternoon snack?
This is a great idea, but for now, may we recommend our Mini Blueberry Muffins? There are five pouches in each box. Each pouch has four Mini Muffins. This means you get to bite into four new muffins which wow that sounds like at least 3456 smiles. Give or take a few thousand. https://t.co/v6HI7OoFjU
Wow. Talk about a trip down memory lane. Also, we can't decide between @Pringles or @PopTartsUS for the best-looking retro packaging.	https://t.co/wrq4XWZ3JN

@DavidBoylan15 We see what you did there.
@Swerdlick Do you recommend the Zebra Cakes based on preference or is there something about them that would make Zebra Cakes an exceptional combination with burritos and nachos?
@SirFreebie75061 Is that what you ate yesterday?
@GrackleOak Why the cosmic brownies?
@Bigtomstud How Come?
@grayblu22 Why?

@ActaBunniFooFoo @iamBrandonTV @TeamStreamGifts Woah. Someone cares!
We often speak about how it's important to see the pros and cons of any situation. However, we forget that it takes twice as much effort to see the good as it does to see the bad which can make it hard to actually see both sides. Make the effort to see the good.

@PopTartsUS Thanks, friend
@PopTartsUS Ah. Nobody likes unappetizing. So is "bad rep" the phonologically similar but ultimately misspelled alternative to "bad rap"?
@PopTartsUS Apparently "wrap" is the popular choice for what we should've said.
@mrgames2 we love you too
Valentine's Day gets a bad rep, but there's never a wrong time to tell important people you love them.
Don't just survive with a cookie. Thrive with a cookie AND cake.

@oldsongsplease @duffgoldman We thought it was an apple too.
@super_star_96 Girl power!
@dalsubfan üòÇ We didn't say competition is bad! It's fun and good, but problematic when it becomes an obsession.
@flyawaySabrina Not sure if he made one, but we know he's got a tasting video.
Which leads us to a greater thought: Our culture is obsessed with competition and comparison; we can't simply appreciate things for what they are. Preferences are fine, but often, people act as if they have to hate one thing in order to remain loyal to the other. That's bad.
Dear Gail,		Are you referring to the movies? We enjoy Marvel's ambition and general success in building a complex cinematic universe with diverse heroes. But we also appreciate DC Universe's willingness to allow each hero's story to be told in unique ways. So both. https://t.co/KojpYEIk7v

5 Things To Leave Behind in 2018:		-Allowing others' anxiety to multiply your anxiety	-Concerning yourself only with output and never with input	-Sabotaging your way out of good situations	-Forgetting you matter just as much as those around you	-Ignoring your 3pm snack break
In 2018, America‚Äôs top 5 Little Debbie snack cakes were: 	1. Oatmeal Cr√®me Pies	2. Nutty Buddy Bars	3. Honey Buns	4. Swiss Rolls	5. Cosmic Brownies.¬† 		Texans led the way with all except for Swiss Rolls. Floridians love Little Debbie Swiss Rolls the most.
As of December, there were over 390 million Oatmeal Creme Pies sold in 2018 which would be enough for everyone in the United States to at least try one.

Some will say these are *just* like Zebra Cakes, but the true connoisseur knows the difference. The Fancy Cake is a moist white cake with swirls of frosting that give it its unique *fancy* flavor.
Twin wrapped. 10 in a box. It's a perfect little creme-filled white cake.
