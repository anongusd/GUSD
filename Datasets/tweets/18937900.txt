Markets will recover until earnings not making their estimates. Strongest economy means inflation. Trump will put the blame on the Federal reserve and fire and hire the people who follow Trump. More and more control. He will do everything to not look bad.
A country is a business. More money out and less coming in is a red flag. What do you have to do? Raise taxes and cut back on everything. As I said Trump will destroy this country. Fox News will fail and no more fake news.
Yes, all time low unemployment. Tax breaks for the rich. President Reagan the golf standard of the GOP has the same exact slogan “Make America Great Again” cut rates and raised it 5 plus times.
Trump owns this market now and he is going to do everything to set this straight. But it won’t happen and the house and senate will go blue.
Company earnings will not make their predictions. Correction had to happen because of the funky market tricks. Program trading and the inside traders control the markets.
Raising rates will mean when companies borrow money means less profit. People are scared because their retirement has dropped a lot and will realize that Trump is not the second coming.
Presidents should never get involved in financial markets. I sold almost everything when he was elected because I thought he will kill this country and was wrong and gave up 25%.
Trump has taken on this market by claiming it’s because of his policies. No, it’s not true. The bull market started when Obama saved the country from collapsing. Bull market started with him. Trump wants to kill the Fed. Maybe?
If you look back on my tweets I predicted this pull back in the market. Will be down again Thursday but may find buyers at the low.

The average person does not know or care to know how the country works. It’s a company like any other. Profits keep it going, yes? Spending reduces profits. Cash flow gets tight. You borrow money to keep it going. But if you don’t eliminate debt (jobs) you can go out of business.
Drain the Swamp, Trump said. What did he do? Look at his administration. Why are lobbyists and special interest groups allowed to operate? Buying politicians and policy? Ex-Washington insiders work for them. Hired for extraordinary amounts of money for influence.
There is an estimated 43 million plus Americans who live in poverty according to the official measure. Do you care? I do. #BernieSanders is not a communist or socialist just a person who wants to spread the wealth evenly. Health care for all. Why not?
Is it fair that wealthy individuals take Social Security payments every month? Will $1800-$2400 make a difference to them? instead, take that money and fund something for the poor? Don’t they see or care about the homeless?
You voted for Trump because you thought a successful businessman can turn the country around. Don’t you think the Trump inner circle is trading on inside economic info before it’s announced? #RichGetRicher.
The Presidential cell phone test-ringing? C’mon sheep, wake up. Another way to take control. Do you think anyone cares about what Trump did or does. It’s just noise in the background. Approval ratings means nothing if you have the electoral college. It can be and has been hacked.
IMF said global growth is falling. #POTUS &amp; United States is being laughed at around the world. Tariffs on China and others will never work. Isolation is a world killer. Slowly the #DonaldTrumpShow will control everything. Watch, it’s happening everyday.
Yes, jobs are great, but inflation means you pay more for everyday staples. Mark my words in you calendar, “Trickle down economics never worked” Trump will be president in 2020 because when you look at your 401k that is how you will vote. Until the house of cards collapses.
Government subsidies will be cut more and more to lower the national debt. Rich get richer ALWAYS. Does a CEO deserve $1-$5-$10-$15 plus million in compensation while you bring home $250-$1000 a week? Trump is dividing us. If you are not for him, you lose.
As they say Donal J Trump will be the last president of the United States of America. The sheep that follow will be hurt the most. It’s just smoke and mirrors.
I called this coming. Regan gave the rich a tax break then raised it 7 times. Does anyone remember 18-21% interest rates? Buy bank stocks in 6 months. National debt will be over $1 trillion shortly if not now.
More jobs means higher inflation. Means higher interest rates as we are having now. 10 year treasury notes are at a high. You can’t have it both ways. Trump will kill this country. The rich will always get richer. Stupid fools at the Trump rallies. Sheep
Does anyone care that the US is going to pay $450 Billion in interest on the Federal Debt? Or that #PresidentTrump wants to eliminate the Federal Reserve and will have full control shortly? Where is the infrastructure promised?
@AndrewSorkin what would you say in my opinion that Tesla really has a deal in place. Saudis are short and will buy the stock under 100. Worth looking into?
