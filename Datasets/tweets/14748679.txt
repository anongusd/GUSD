All of this pioneering work could not have been done without Evans &amp; Sutherland.		David Evans founded the computer science department in 1965 and was its chair until 1973.

Alan Ashton, BA ‚Äô66 PhD ‚Äô70, co-founded WordPerfect.

Telle Whitney, BS ‚Äô78, made her pioneering mark by co-founding the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference (@ghc), first held in 1994.

Bui Tuong-Phong, PhD ‚Äô75, invented the Phong shading method &amp; reflection model, one of the most widely used illumination methods in computer graphics.		Along w/Robert McDermott, Jim Clark &amp; Raphael Rom, he created the 1st graphic that looks like its physical model: the VW bug. https://t.co/iqjbBW7bf1
A well known pioneer of computing from the U is @adobe founder John Warnock, BS ‚Äô61 MS ‚Äô64 PhD ‚Äô69.
