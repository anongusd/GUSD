@Timelady07 @AmericanVoR My oldest came home a couple weeks back and presented me with immigration reform policy. I was blown away. Children listen. If we give them an openness to learn, they will change the world for the better.
@Timelady07 @AmericanVoR They witness mama work from a bipartisan standpoint to argue policy.
@Timelady07 @AmericanVoR They are taught both sides of an argument for or against policy change. They are also provided space to form their own opinion. I will help them locate appropriate reliable sources and will ask thought provoking questions. My opinion isn't needed for them to see fact.
@Timelady07 @AmericanVoR My oldest could likely define healthcare policy better than most adults in general.
@Timelady07 @AmericanVoR Instilling knowledge pertaining government function, is vital. My youngest could probably define what it means to identify with the GOP better than they could.
@Timelady07 @AmericanVoR 12 and 7. Both already speak to law makers about policy with mama. They're still in the development stage of personal identification politically. However, my household runs much like The Congress. Proposals equate floor debates with voting and amendments before passing as law.
