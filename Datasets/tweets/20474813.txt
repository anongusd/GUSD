@nfloyd1208 I think w Mark Kelly running, it'll draw a lot of attn to the state &amp; could oddly have an up-ballot effect. The prospect of two Dems from AZ certainly means the D voters are there. Trump only won it by just 3.5 pts. So MAYBE a tip to R, but wouldn't be surprised if D pulls it off
@ColCactus OK is still a VERY red state. It was the only state to go MORE Republican in 2008 than 2004. 		Iowa MIGHT be toss up-Dem activity may move it that way &amp; Trump's approval is net negative there. Still very popular w GOP base there though so his voters with him. One to watch.

@jptres92 That‚Äôs not the case. You can argue he‚Äôs for more restrictions but it‚Äôs done within the framework of the Texas precedent.

As other conservatives have been doing, Trump uses Venezuela for a #2020 hit:		‚ÄúHere, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.  America was founded on liberty and independence ‚Äì- not government coercion, domination, and control."
I'm going to say this just one time tonight... everyone holds out "infrastructure" as the bipartisan thing that both parties want done, but they cannot and have not been able to agree on.... HOW TO PAY FOR IT... for like a decade or more
"We have more women serving in congress than at any time before."		All because of DEMOCRATIC women. Republican women's numbers went DOWN after 2018
Did you hear @realDonaldTrump say, call it a wall, call it whatever you want? No. He made the case FOR a wall, which means we are no closer to a resolution to keeping the government open after 2/15
Groans rise up from the audience when Trump starts talking about caravans coming to the country, and his assessment of a "lawless" Southern border.
This speech, billed as a call for "unity," is turning into a Trump Festivus
This line even Republicans had to be laughing at: 		‚ÄúIf there is going to peace and legislation there can‚Äôt be war and investigation‚Äù

The #SOTU response took on the form we are more familiar with today, with either one or two lawmakers delivering a response, in 1987.		SOURCE: @SenateHistory https://t.co/J3V58KQ0Vi
In 1985, a young Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, MODERATED a pre-recorded program that featured voters in four sites around the country and remarks from party leaders. Two networks @NBCNews @CBSNews took it right after Reagan‚Äôs speech; @ABC aired it two days later
In the 1970s and 80s, Democrats and Republicans got creative in their #SOTU responses. They held televised programs with senators, Q-and-A sessions with voters around the country, news conferences, and even documentaries.
There has been a response to the #SOTU every year since 1982.
The first official #SOTU response was in 1966 to Democrat LBJ‚Äôs address. It was done jointly with Republican Senate Leader Everett Dirksen and House Republican Leader Gerald Ford.
Democrats announced that @staceyabrams and @AGBecerra will deliver #SOTU responses. The SOTU response can be a precarious one. There have been plenty that are... not so great. But how far back do they go and how creative have the parties gotten?

@jasonmdubya "The polls were wrong!" has really turned out to be a false narrative and far more nuanced: https://t.co/8xkztYlGSj
The bottom line is a confluence of polling has found that a shutdown over a wall is not the right thing, good idea, good strategy or worth it. People think the govt should open back up, BUT that doesn't mean they don't think Democrats shouldn't compromise at least SOME on wall $
But these seemingly contradictory findings also show two-thirds think Trump should agree to a budget without wall $, but a majority also thinks Democrats should agree to a budget WITH wall $. And people are split on whether he should give the #SOTU even in a shutdown. https://t.co/MBE7NY3E36
The new @CBSNews poll has lots of reasons for Democrats to feel like they have the upper hand -- 71% think a shutdown for a wall is not worth it, 47%-35% think Pelosi is doing a better job than Trump handling negotiations, 60% think shutdown causing serious problems https://t.co/yjOwUumWhs

Important thread https://t.co/cAllSYqBGx
The last #SOTU to be delayed was Reagan‚Äôs in 1986 because of the Challenger explosion. And that was at the request of the White House.
Does @SpeakerPelosi have the power to deny @realDonaldTrump the opportunity to deliver the #SOTU at the Capitol?	 	Yes, she does. Trump has to be invited to speak by Congress and doesn't have the right to command the floor on his own.
That said, no president has missed the opportunity to give a #SOTU in person (who wasn't in his first or last year in office) since the advent of the televised #SOTUaddress in 1947.
In the U.S.‚Äôs 243-year history, there have been 95 in-person #SOTU / "Annual Messages" (as they used to be known).
FDR popularized the use of the phrase "State of the Union," but it became officially known as the State of the Union Address in 1947, which also happened to be the first year it was televised.
So... there is no requirement for the #SOTU to be in person and no requirement for them to even be yearly.
Article II, Section 3:		‚ÄúHe shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.‚Äù #SOTU #SOTUaddress
A thread about State of the Union addresses history/the Constitution...		First, does the State of the Union #SOTU have to be delivered in person?	No. The only constitutional requirement is as follows:
Pelosi says if Trump wants to give the speech at the Capitol and the govt is still shut down, she'll "cross that bridge when we come to it."		But she hasn't heard from @realDonaldTrump and says with a smile he's been "verrry silent for more than 24 hours."

Remember, when Obama wanted to end a standoff in Congress, he deployed @JoeBiden to work with @senatemajldr because they've known each other a long time. Seemingly intractable issues become less so when you involve people who have relationships.
Why McConnell is needed likely to end this shutdown (short of Trump completely caving): Because the White House needs a congressional liaison. Trump has no connection, no longstanding relationships with people on the Hill.

1/ Some people in the Democratic base want @realDonaldTrump impeached! Today! And they believe so using foul language! And they want the Democratic leadership to act! 		OK, except the Democratic leadership has said, no, focus on investigations. And wait for the evidence.
This is very odd https://t.co/eVaiY9TbBW
@peter_w_rooney Yeah wasn‚Äôt trying to say there is a tide but that people might say in polling they‚Äôre in favor of stopping that. Live radio.

Pelosi, who told NBC that Trump is hard to negotiate with because he doesn't respect evidence, facts and science, says during speech after being elected speaker that in the House, when they disagree, they should vow to "respect each other and respect the truth."

@arieltwit6 Good question... I wouldn‚Äôt think you could hold that and president in practice but all constitution says is ‚ÄúThe House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other officers.‚Äù
Biden and Stacey Abrams get Speaker of the House votes...		It's a reminder that you don't actually have to be in the House to become speaker.

You might not agree with what @MittRomney has to say policy-wise, but it's sad that it's almost become a rarity to hear someone deliver an argument quietly, with force and subject, verb, object.
Romney, like McCain, downplaying Russia's strength as a country. Obviously, much clearer, cogent stance and position than @realDonaldTrump. Calls Putin a "very unfortunate and awful leader."
If it's Wednesday, we need a #dadjoke / punny headline. Free tabloid shutdown suggestions:		-Bye, Bye, Bei Bei. Subhead: Shutdown shuts down Panda Cam!		Or		-No More Bei Bei Watch...		hmm?
.@MittRomney intimates that the chair of the Republican Party/his niece might have given him some guff at family meetings about his views of Trump. He said her criticism of him was "more civil" than it might have been across the Thanksgiving dinner table
Romney on what kind of role he intends to play as senator/critic of @realDonaldTrump: "I don‚Äôt intend to be a daily commentator." Says he won't necessarily stop for cameras every day in the Senate, but "If It‚Äôs a matter of great significance, I will speak out."

Trump says he hired Michael Cohen because "a long time ago, he did me a favor." 		WHAT WAS THE FAVOR??
"It's very sad what's happening to Paul" Manafort, Trump says, never seen anyone treated so unfairly
Trump: ‚ÄúThis deal was a very public deal. I wasn‚Äôt trying to hide anything.‚Äù
Trump says Cohen is "making up a story." And "even if he was right," he says he would have been allowed to do it.
Trump: "We had an option to build a building in Moscow. We decided not to do it."		And then claims: "There would be nothing wrong if I did do it."
Trump on Michael Cohen: "He's lying about" the project. ...		‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying very simply to get a reduced sentence, all right?‚Äù		"That was a project we didn't do, I didn't do."		"It was an option that I decided not to do."
.@MarkWarner says if Trump tries to pardon people in this investigation to protect himself or his family, "then Congress would have to act."
Over last 24 hrs, @realDonaldTrump tweeted or RT'd:		-6 about Mueller	-5 Clinton	-4 GM layoffs	-2 CNN/Fake News	-2 abt immigrants	-1 about outgoing Broward official intimating she was behind voter fraud		Heavy on the grievance and worried about political impact of Mueller/GM

5/5 Americans expect their president to be a moral leader. Yes, they all play politics, but all presidents before this at least feigned a moral high road on divisive issues, they didn‚Äôt ‚Äútone up.‚Äù For Trump, it‚Äôs simply not about that. It‚Äôs about optics and his winning
4/ When asked about his concerns about white nationalism and his rhetoric, he tells a black reporter that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúracist question.‚Äù
3/ Instead of speaking out for voting accsss when people were in lines that were far too long for far too long, he said he saw efficiency in a state his side won.
2/ Instead of interacting with the press because it‚Äôs about democracy and free speech, he said it about ‚Äúearned media‚Äù that is ‚Äúworth billions.‚Äù
1/ Putting a marker on this. I‚Äôm not surprised by it from President Trump, but I am constantly shocked when the president goes this direction. 		He claimed, ‚ÄúI think I am a great moral leader.‚Äù		But at today‚Äôs news conference he proved the opposite:

Kavanaugh said there was "contention" or "tension" not sure which with freshman year roommate who said he drank to excess and was belligerent and aggressive.
COONS asks if Kavanaugh has ever gotten "aggressive" when he was drunk.		KAVANAUGH: ‚ÄúBasically no. I don‚Äôt know what you mean by that. What are you talking about? No, is the basic answer unless you‚Äôre asking about something I don‚Äôt know about."
Hatch: "This is a national disgrace the way you're being treated."		"He was an immature high schooler. So were we all."		Calls how he's been treated as worse than Bork and Thomas

Side point: Remember, Trump does not drink. I don't think he's going to like all this "I like beer" stuff.

Schumer claiming from Senate floor that Kavanaugh is "hiding" behind "legal" and "verbal chicanery"
Graham seeming to argue for wide executive privilege and torture: "I hope people understand that this war is not over." Adds that terrorists are treated like "common criminals" rather than the "warriors" that they have become.
Didn't know Graham was this Originalist.
Graham: Is there anything in the Constitution that says a woman has a right to an abortion.		Kavanaugh being VERY careful, even refusing to say that the word is not in the Constitution.		Can't make conservatives thrilled.
Is Booker's 2020 slogan going to be "Bring It!"?
Tillis weirdly saying it took him 17 years to get his degree and from five different institutions.
Booker said he IS releasing documents related to Kavanaugh and racial profiling. But... don't see it on his Senate web site yet...
Klobuchar-Grassley is some high-grade Minnesota-Iowa feuding.
How soon before @realDonaldTrump starts calling @realBobWoodward BadBookBob?
#Kavanaugh hints that he is open to increasing contribution limits. He notes that as a DC Circuit judge, he upheld contribution limits and that precedent is mixed on #SCOTUS 		He said: SCOTUS has upheld them generally and struck them down when they were too low.
On warrantless surveillance and whether he weighed in on anything, Kavanaugh said, "I can't rule anything out." Then says that for Bush everyday after Sept. 11 was Sept. 12.		And this is why having documents released would shed some light
Leahy showing how questioning is done. It's about specifics.
@TomFitton Not about being tough enough. It's about specifics. I think the exchange leaves lots of people -- left or right -- still wondering how he'd rule or even how he'd come to a decision.
TBH, Feinstein's questioning on abortion/Roe was pretty toothless. Not sure if she's going to come back to it or just leaving it for others, but if this were a journalistic interview, it failed to get real answers.
Even if Kavanaugh believes Casey is precedent on precedent from Roe, Casey loosened the ability for states to increase restrictions on abortion. THAT is the real key as to whether Kavanaugh will scalpel/gut abortion rights
Ummmm... Kavanaugh just said: "I grew up in a city plagued by gun violence..."		Come on, man! Not your neighborhood.
On guns, Kavanaugh says: "I don‚Äôt get to pick and choose which Supreme Court precedent I choose to follow. I follow em all."		That will come back during this hearing...
I don't know about this move. Paper doesn't randomly turn off and that back light is tough on the eyes, but YDY https://t.co/WaZ2Dio80D
Kavanaugh cites Ginsburg not talking about cases that will come before the court. He's calling it "nominee precedent." 		Remember, though, Ginsburg did talk about her personal views on Roe.

Grassley decides to respond to Leahy calling it "ridiculous" to say that there isn't enough information or aren't enough docs to make a decision on Kavanaugh's confirmation. Number vs. %

Leahy calls the process to pick Kavanaugh "Alice in Wonderland."

Capitol Hill hearings are horrible and amazing at the same time.
Grassley says more documents released for Kavanaugh than others, including Kagan.		Leahy rebuts pointing out that 99% of Kagan's records from the WH were made public 12 days before the hearing.		For Kavanaugh, he said, just 7%, only 4% public.
Blumenthal calls for a motion to delay. Now there are outbursts in the audience.
So Grassley said he was going to let people respond and now is saying Blumenthal is out of order for trying to respond. This is threatening to be a school-management mess. And I've been there. It's not fun.
Leahy: "Oh, come on" in response to Cornyn contending all Democrats would be held in contempt if this were a court of law... 		Now, Grassley threatening to go into the weekend if objections continue.		This is going to be a week.

Re-upping my tweet string from yesterday. Collins cannot be removed from the ballot unless he moves out of state or is appointed and accepts another public office. Suspending his campaign does nothing to remove him from the ballot https://t.co/MEvmtBXhSF
If he remains on the ballot, wins and then resigns, it would be in the first year of the term and the governor would therefore call for a special election. That election would take place between 70 and 80 days from the governor issuing a proclamation calling for a special
Here‚Äôs what bonkers ‚Äî his name would remain on the ballot EVEN IF HE‚ÄôS CONVICTED.
Now, for the loopholes for how he could be removed:	1. Move out of state. Sell his house. 	2. If nominated for ‚Äî and accepts ‚Äî another public office. Any public office. Not state party position. Yes dog catcher in Elmira (if that‚Äôs a real job) (According to section 6-146 para 5)
On pt. 3 Decline:	-the period has passed when he could say, no, I don‚Äôt want to run. That was 3 days after he filed to run back in April.
In order to 2. qualify, you need to be: 	-25 years old. Check. 	-A citizen. Check. 	-live in the state when they‚Äôre elected. Currently the case.
NYS law says there are only three ways to get off the ballot and comes down to 3 Ds:	1. Die	2. Disqualify	3. Decline		And none of 2 and 3 (most likely) apply to Collins
Latest on NY-27 and Collins. Long, short of it is he can‚Äôt be removed from the ballot (with two longshot loopholes which I‚Äôll get to)

O'Connor would need 60.3% of the remaining 8,483 provisional/absentee ballots to win
That makes about 55% that O'Connor needs of remaining provisionals/absentees to get it to within 0.5 percentage point automatic recount territory
Actually, excuse me, according to @wosunews @WOSU there are some 8,500 provisional AND absentees
Balderson up 1,754 votes in #OH12 or 0.9% pts		3,400 provisional ballots remain		If margin narrows to 0.5% pts, there‚Äôd be an automatic recount. 		O'Connor needs to make up 741 votes, &gt;60% of remaining provisionals to close the gap.		So not quite over
Balderson is +201 now		99% Franklin	66% Delaware
Balderson takes the lead. +1,000 in Delaware County. Now 66% in. Trend is in Balderson's favor...
In other news, with 17% in Kansas, Kris Kobach vaults into the lead.
155 votes separate the candidates.		Remaining vote:	52% Delaware Cty	93% Franklin
Delaware County 52% in, O'Connor holding onto a 1,300-vote lead
Man, Green Party candidate with more than 1,000 votes now... race may be decided by less than that
15 more percentage points just came in for Delaware and closed the gap SOME for Balderson.		O'Connor still up about 1,400
Coming down to the wire in OH-12. O'Connor back in the lead, but only because a big chunk of Franklin County came in. But it is now 88% in. Coming down to Delaware County, which is only 24% in. Has been favorable to Balderson, but let's see which precincts are left there
@jptres92 one more data point
@CTR953 no exit polls. generally not in specials and hardly ever for House races.
Why does OH-12 matter? There are 69 R-held districts that Trump won by LESS or Clinton won. THAT'S why millions have been spent to protect this GOP seat. If the Dem wins or comes close, that sets the limit for number of seats that could be vulnerable. Dems need to net 23
Life, for @realDonaldTrump, is just not fair. No one treats him or his friends, even the ones convicted of crimes, right. The media gets it wrong, and don‚Äôt get him started on trade, immigration, the IRS or Nordstrom. It‚Äôs all been a series of injustices https://t.co/3Xbh8lDiVn

@DannyPage Ok.....
@DannyPage There‚Äôs a climate of a lot of complaining going on - valid or not. There are a lot of cross currents that are making for a toxic, not just political culture, but American culture. It‚Äôs a volatile time in American history
That press briefing was perfect. The beginning: how Russia's trying to sow dissent and how the govt is doing something to stop it. 		And then... it ends with all that mess. Isn't this kind of exactly what the Russians want? To sow dissent and cripple democratic institutions?
Grievance Nation. That's where we're at. No matter who it is, they've think they've got it worse and has someone to blame for their situation.
@oliverdarcy @Acosta She also conflated things said by commentators and the news media that stand before her everyday. And she knows better. Her performance was intended as much, if not more, for her boss.
As the late Tim Russert would say, "What a country!"		This can be RTd and applied to probably every day
What @PressSec just did in complaining about press coverage reminded me of spokesmen and women from various campaigns and offices who call, yell to be loud and it isn't about me, it's about making sure their boss hears them
Coats says 2018 is "not the kind of robust effort" that Russia undertook in the 2016 election.
6/6 unless you have no shame. Unless you decide that you have to dig in on this thing. Usually it‚Äôs ONE really big thing. This, though? This is not normal
5/5 And it‚Äôs true of politicians, too. Most at least base what they‚Äôre talking about in facts that are generally accurate and then spun up. And when they or their team get it wrong, and it‚Äôs pointed out, they are usually shamable  enough to change how they talk about it.
4/ But when we get it wrong, we correct it and try to do better. If in our profession someone continually gets it wrong, they would relatively quickly be out of a job.
3/ And it‚Äôs been said before, but journalists try very hard to get it right. It‚Äôs actually the core of our jobs, to have the Truth ‚Äî a shared, independently verifiable Truth ‚Äî as our North Star. Sometimes, we get it wrong, usually because of speed (or laziness).
2/ We all make mistakes and sometimes even... lie. But at this rate? You would have to do some serious self-examination to get things on track.
1/ The president of the United States has made 4,229 false claims in 558 days. That‚Äôs almost 8 (!!!) per DAY. Can you imagine if you did that at work, with your spouse or friends? You‚Äôd probably be fired and unable to hold down a relationship. https://t.co/qIxrLVj6hX

Clapper on @CNN says his criticisms are born of genuine concern abt President Trump. Calls Trump's attempt to remove clearance as a "very petty, petty thing to do." Adds it would be a bad "precedent" to do this for political reasons, but that the president has the right to do so
Also, think of the types of people that this WH has tried to get or gave security clearance to.
Just to be clear: The president is seeking the removal of security clearances for two former CIA directors (of presidents of different parties), a former Director of National Intelligence, a former National Security Advisor, and two former FBI directors.
.@PressSec brushes off question on whether the president believes, as the U.S. intel community assessed, that Carter Page was a Russian agent.

7/7 Regardless of your views on abortion or any other controversial issue, you should WANT the next justice at the court -- a lifetime appointment -- to, well, answer questions frankly, the way Ginsburg did.
6/ Yes, Ginsburg said in her opening that it would be improper to hint how she'd rule in future cases, but she was VERY specific during questioning about her views. That's quite the OPPOSITE of justifying Kavanaugh or anyone else NOT answering questions about abortion, etc.
5/ p. 208: States that ban abortion "controls women and denies them full autonomy and full equality with men." https://t.co/5MxVzb0bL7

3/ p. 207 - "When Government controls that decision for	her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible	for her own choices." https://t.co/AEFP8hyOMH
2/ ...All you have to do is read Ginsburg's 1993 confirmation hearing testimony, and you see how specific she is in discussing the holdings in Roe and that she aligns with the majority. See pgs. 148-150, for example. Excerpt attached. https://t.co/j7xLGWt6e6

5/ But a caveat... 	TRUMP: ‚ÄúI will say this. It will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination.‚Äù
4/ As far as what they'd DO... Will Roe be overturned?	TRUMP: ‚ÄúIf we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that is really what will happen. That WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY in my opinion. Because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.‚Äù ...

10/10 So now we're talking about a jacket rather than myriad other things -- from as minor as the split between the president and first lady, a problem Republicans still can't legislate their way out of, or, you know, the children https://t.co/7CiBwIlSZj
9/ The president says she did it on purpose -- because of the MEDIA.
8/ And then she wears "the jacket." Twitter loses its mind. People are left scratching their heads. At the minimum, it's a poor choice, a political faux pas. Says you!
7/ The first lady raises eye brows by deciding she would fly to Texas and visit detained children at two centers in Texas Her husband does not go along. A sign of tension in the White House? A continued rift between the president and first lady?
6/ It's a stunning turn of events and a political defeat for Trump, who spins that he's winning even when he's not. He credits the first lady and his daughter for his change of... heart. Story over? Not quite...
5/ The day after the briefing with the homeland security secretary, Trump does an about-face, caves to pressure and signs an executive order that says they won't separate families (although the admin would seek to waive Flores and the 20-day detention rule)
4/ Congress scrambles, begins writing bills to try and fix it. Buuuut... it's Congress. Everyone, including the Trump administration wants something, and it isn't clear what, if anything, can pass. Feelings are hurt. Mark Meadows and Paul Ryan point fingers at each other.
3/ Trump digs in, blames Democrats and Congress, falsely says there's a "law" that prevents him from changing course. His homeland security secretary is rolled out and defiantly says the decline of democracy is when laws aren't enforced
2/ The president didn't want to back down, but the pressure builds:	-The first lady tweets about it	-Past first ladies tweet and write an op-ed, too	-Moderate vulnerable Republicans grow nervous	-NRCC comes out against the policy, as do other Republicans
1/ Here we go... follow the bouncing ball...	So the politics of separating children were bad...
This is really becoming a pattern with the chief justice and a sign of of his judicial philosophy. https://t.co/cs1uAlS4bP

Should probably start with Ryan and McConnell since they‚Äôre in the majority and then check in with the 68 senators who voted for comprehensive immigration in 2013. That bill included more judges though so  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. Who knew immigration was so complicated? https://t.co/BQjl3ApHcr

This... might be everything https://t.co/Qt9puvf3zO
7/7 Expect Trump admin court filing not to be the only one...
6/ This was part of the criticism with the Obama administration when it set up family detention centers. Trump official on call with reporters, per @HorsleyScott says it's on the judge whether families will be able to be detained together or not
5/ In other words, because Flores currently requires that kids be released after 20 days, the Trump admin wants the court to change it to be able to detain them essentially indefinitely because there aren‚Äôt enough immigration judges to get cases through quickly.
4/ And yet... the EO Trump just signed calls on the attorney general to file a request in federal court to "modify" Flores "to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings..." because of "present resource constraints." https://t.co/8Uv5VSIyMW
3/ Part of that treatment was the LENGTH of detention. The courts said, with the Flores agreement, that the government couldn't hold kids for longer than 20 days....
2/ Flores was brought as a class-action suit against the government and immigration officials because human-rights advocates didn't like how detained children were being treated. It took 12 years to settle (1985 to 1997).
1/ Reading through the executive order on family detention that @realDonaldTrump signed, there's another fight brewing, again related to the Flores Settlement but in reverse.

4/4 What we're now seeing with the separation of children, the attempt at "deterrence" and the false blaming of Democrats for it because of it's odious optics is the practical implementation of Trump's foundational ideology
3/ Remember when @StephenMillerAL argued with reporters over the poem on the Statue of Liberty last year? It was part of Trump going back to grievance politics. Immigration is at the heart of that. https://t.co/juOFmduP5o
2/ .@realDonaldTrump reiterated "merit-based" is what he wants so companies like Boeing and Lockheed can hire the kinds of people they need. This is not how U.S. immigration policy has worked for centuries, but Trump's -- and the people around him -- believe that's been a problem
1/ The fundamental underpinning ideology of @realDonaldTrump on immigration is that the people who are coming to the U.S. are not the kinds of people the U.S. should be admitting, that they're not good for the country. Listen to what Trump said today.

We heard a lot in some communities of color that there was such distrust of police that even black officers were referred to as more blue than black.
@MayorSRB @CornelWest @Bucks @NFL Community policing has been a big piece of the conversation since 2014 when I was covering this @NewsHour . Have you seen positive steps taken? Is there any data? #justicematters2018
@MayorSRB @CornelWest @Bucks @NFL And for those who aren't aware of the Sterling Brown case/video, here's @NPR 's story with the video: https://t.co/lE1cbN4jYV #justicematters2018
@MayorSRB @CornelWest @Bucks @NFL from whites were similar to what they are now. But how can that divide be bridged? What positive, concrete steps have you seen various communities take? #justicematters2018
@MayorSRB @CornelWest @Bucks @NFL That's often lost in discussions about ratings and the like. It's often been the case that black athletes have protested what they've seen as unfair societal treatment. I've written about this -- Tommie Smith, John Carlos, Curt Flood, Muhammad Ali. The perceptions then...

So why didn't @BarackObama pardon Jack Johnson? @samstein reported on this last month... https://t.co/kKHYvLOqAK
This is one more Obama-didn't-do it-so-I-will
Trump looks like he's promoting a fight
@Donny_V How many of those are Congressional or statewide candidates? 3. And all of them had the support of Washington/establishment Democrats. Abrams? Clinton endorsed. Moser and Trevino in TX were the most notable in the divide, and they lost
5/5 Flood opened a bar in Spain, but abandoned his children. His case, though, laid the groundwork for modern-day free agency. He was later re-embraced by his sport a quarter century later, given the Jackie Robinson Award for contributions by black athletes.
4/ Or Curt Flood, who in 1969, protested MLB's contractual clause calling players the teams' property. Flood called that being a "well-paid slave." There was tremendous backlash from whites. And facing death threats, he left the country https://t.co/YBdwzGAaGZ
3/ Don't forget about Muhammad Ali, who was banned fro boxing for three years because he refused to go to Vietnam, citing religious convictions. The #SCOTUS overturned his conviction four years after the fact https://t.co/YBdwzGAaGZ
2/ And the white Australian champion who supported them was banned from the sport, only posthumously honored for standing up for human rights. The two American runners were pall bearers at his funeral https://t.co/YBdwzGAaGZ
1/ Let's remember the history in this country with black athletes and political protest. This time isn't new. 50 years ago, American Olympic champions were stripped of their medals for their podium protest. https://t.co/YBdwzGAaGZ
Trump praises NFL and questions whether players who protest should even be in the country	https://t.co/geqPYcoyK8

@PTNetherton And they weren‚Äôt tip ins. They were both after halftime and I was SO PROUD. Until I realized what happened looking at my teammates and the parents on the sidelines. It was like a Will Ferrell moment

@DaviSusan You saying all relationships head this way anyway?
@esaagar Unless he means it
Former DNI James Clapper tells @1a that Russian interference has a ‚Äúprofound impact‚Äù and ‚Äúprobably turned the election.‚Äù
@WarrenRifkin He was spurred to run bc of the teacher cuts. Interestingly, he‚Äôs a Republican who is so Republican he chose NOT to join the @NEAToday bc of its endorsements of national Democrats
@WarrenRifkin The problem from that perspective can be when neither party nominates people like that anymore
@danstalilonis @realDonaldTrump You have some valid points for sure that I don‚Äôt disagree with. But his downplaying the importance of the vote in midterms is not what Republicans who are trying to keep the House want to hear
6/ 5. @realDonaldTrump remains the ultimate wild card. Going off script on a primary night to admit he doesn't really believe that votes in 2018 are as important as for him in 2016. If GOP loses one or both chambers, this tape will replayed over and over	https://t.co/JxqoJv9g5D
5/ 4. Don't overlook the political power of teachers. It could be a sleeper issue this year that just woke up, as a Kentucky high school math teacher just beat the House majority floor leader who co-authored a controversial bill that cut teacher benefits	https://t.co/JxqoJv9g5D
4/ 3. The Democratic "year of the woman" continues, as women continue to rack up win after win in a year when a record number of female candidates are running in the age of Trump. Same can't be said on the Republican side.	https://t.co/JxqoJv9g5D
3/ 2. In the battle of progressives versus the party establishment, the Democratic fight fizzled -- and that's probably good for the party looking to win back the House	https://t.co/JxqoJv9g5D
2/ 1. The Georgia governor's race highlights the two very different directions the parties are going, one chooses diversity (whether the state is ready or not), the other leaning hard into culture war https://t.co/JxqoJv9g5D

@davezatz @nprpolitics @Mickeleh Problem there is that pollsters have found that a small but significant number of people, once they know the winner, lie and say more often than not that they voted for the winner. And then you‚Äôre still not talking to known voters.
@davezatz @nprpolitics @Mickeleh Well, sure but that has major pitfalls ‚Äî 1. You have to wait MUCH longer than now (and they get it right 99.9% of the time. And 	2. More importantly, we wouldn‚Äôt get any of the demographic information that tell us all what actually happened to make the result what it was

So if that‚Äôs being done on lefty sights, shame. BUT a presentation at @AAPOR found conservatives more likely to consume and spread fake news
10/ The trolls sit back and laugh because they got me to write 10 tweets on this when I could be doing something else. Don't be the trolls. Be smarter than trolls.
9/ The idea here is to just throw as much nonsense at the wall and get people talking about it.		The worst part is many of the people promulgating this know what's going on and are fine with it because it benefits their side.
8/ If your answer is probably NO ONE, you should pay no attention to it.
7/ And so on. People really need to stop and think about their own Internet litaracy. Stop and ask yourself for a second why this guy would have ANY credibility in the nexus between Jay Z and Obama? What "sources" in that world are talking to him?
6/ People likely don't click on it, and that's all there is. Some may click, but see that it looks like a report, and that's good enough, too.
5/ 4. People likely never click and just see Drudge tweet that blares: "REPORT: OBAMA PLEADS WITH JAY-Z TO PREVENT OTHER HIP HOP ARTISTS MEETING WITH TRUMP..."
4/ 3. Drudge passes InfoWars story around.
3/ 2. Conservative conspiracy site InfoWars picks it up, slaps a photo on, makes it pretty.
2/ 1. Random guy -- Trump supporter, not a reporter -- tweets this with no sourcing, no reporting.

@bcburden Yep. They admitted this. They‚Äôre more like better pre-election likely voter polls. Much bigger sample than a regular poll and more attention to more regions. But not talking to actual voters on the day of the election leaving polling places
@NamirYedid I don't think it was that. More likely what Comey has implied - that he thought Clinton was going to win, and he didn't want to appear to be favoring her after the fact in the election and inevitably himself become a political football with House GOP
.@FoxNews pollsters on their "three stages of grief" after executives said they wanted to leave the National Election Pool:		1. OMG what are we going to do	2. Can‚Äôt we fight this	3. Can we come up with something better?

8/8 .@krisshaffer noted that the impact of fake news probably was greater on Facebook,  but easier to research Twitter. Also notes that the "artificial amplification of truth that‚Äôs partial can have as much negative impact as lies." #AAPOR2018
7/ Bottom line: Republicans were consuming WAY more fake news than Democrats. #AAPOR2018
6/  People on the left shared fake news less than regular news, while people on the right shared fake news just like regular news. And if you consumed one fake news source, you were more likely to view more of it. #AAPOR2018
5/ The older you get, the higher proportion of fake news you consume. Researcher wasn't sure if this was a psychological or technological issue.  #AAPOR2018
4/ There was an exposure imbalance between right and left. 16% of people on the right consumed a substantial amount of fake news in their timeline. Just 2.5% on the left. Not just extreme right, but moderates consumed it, too. #AAPOR2018
3/ Who are they? "Cyborg humans" using automation tools. Mixing personal tweets with auto tweeted content. #AAPOR2018
2/ Some other findings from the @Northeastern study presented by @grinbergnir: 		-5% of political content in voters‚Äô Twitter timelines was fake news.	-1% of people consumed 80% of fake news.	-0.1% (16 accounts) accounted for 80% of fake news shared on Twitter #AAPOR2018
1/ Excellent definition of fake news from @grinbergnir from @Northeastern "Misinformation with the trappings of 'legitimately' produced news but without the underlying organizational processes." CC: @MarkMemmottNPR #AAPOR2018
Good discussion at #AAPOR2018 about who consumed fake news and how big the factor was. Not a ton of data, but consensus is that it had relatively little impact on 2016, but was consumed most by a small number of older, conservative-leaning voters. And far more by Republicans

Free idea, White House correspondents, Mueller/NYT gave you lots of questions to repeatedly ask every day at press briefings from now until they're all answered
@karinchu @realDonaldTrump I'm sure it has something to do with drawing a crowd and $ for those scholarships, etc. But, yes, you make a good point - one that I think a lot on the @whca will think about
Always a good read https://t.co/7kBGoqPO63
"You do have some countries that are in very bad shape." https://t.co/HGCgbzqdJh
Trump's instincts are for drama and production. Talking about where the North Korea talks could take place, he says: The good news: Everybody wants us, it has the chance to be a big event.
As Trump meets with Nigeria's president, do you realize the s-hole countries scandal was THIS January? As a reminder, Dick Durbin said he heard the remarks: "He said these hate-filled things. And he said them repeatedly." https://t.co/7rd5tncM2s
There's only one reason why Netanyahu does a presentation with charts and full color in English and knows American cable cameras happen to be in the room and rolling live. It's to influence one country and one person.
Actually having real things to deal with in life does tend to focus the mind on what's really important. https://t.co/6bUo0OPYYk

2/2 Anyone remember Colbert? Or Larry Wilmore dropping the N word? And others. Biting, offensive, awkward to varying degrees. No, the balance is off bc @realDonaldTrump isn't attending &amp; he isn't able to GIVE as good as he gets, though that doesn't stop him
1/ The balance of the @whca dinner is off. But it's not because of a comedian. Comedians make jokes. And they make [clutches pearls] off-color jokes that offend people, especially people IN POWER, which is the president and the Washington MEDIA. It's literally their job...
13/ From @MichiganRadio: "Despite assurances, many Flint residents still don‚Äôt trust their tap water or the state officials claiming the water is safe to drink."
12/ From @MichiganRadio: "It will take at least two more years for crews to finish replacing all the aging pipes connecting Flint homes and businesses to city water mains."
11/ From @MichiganRadio: "To date, more than 6,200 lead and galvanized service lines have been replaced, with twice that number that still need to be removed."
10/ From @MichiganRadio "While the immediate crisis may have passed, the aging infrastructure that leached lead into people‚Äôs drinking water remains a problem."
9/ From @MichiganRadio: "Citing those test results, the Snyder administration decided to end free bottled water distribution in Flint this month, though it continues to hand out water filters to screen for lead."
8/ From @MichiganRadio: "Recent tests show levels of lead in the city‚Äôs tap water are now well within state and federal quality standards," but Flint still does have problems with it's water infrastructure, four years almost to the date of the water crisis

@royd77 It was during Merkel-Trump bilat while the U.S. president was talking about other stuff than Germany
Trump taking credit for Korea progress. "Never had a leader" like him. "We're not going to be played." In past, U.S. been "played like a fiddle."
We are one year and three months into Trump's presidency, and he again just mentioned the "Clinton campaign" in a meeting with the German chancellor nonetheless. News cycle nowadays = shampoo, rinse, repeat

8/ I have a newfound respect for what @kendricklamar does with WORDS. It is a special moment that he won the @PulitzerPrizes for Damn because damn.
7/ I want to give a hat tip to @free_c_mike for his prescient essay on this album in December. https://t.co/4TMuJPIS9t
6/ Go listen to it this way, full through, reading the lyrics as you listen. If you are white and only get derailed by crass or offensive lyrics, you‚Äôre really, really missing the point. Think about if YOU could do this to explain the peaks and valleys of your own life. You can‚Äôt
5/ And in an era of downloads and short-attention spans with the goal of standalone singles, when few do ‚ÄúAlbums‚Äù as a story ‚Äî Damn is special and groundbreaking.
4/ I can never fully understand the black experience. But I felt the emotion and power and pain coming through. I was shocked listening to Blood and teared up listening to Feel.)
3/ Even though I have ‚Äúheard‚Äù all of the songs and really liked them and thought Lamar is a genius for what he can do with his voice (the end of DNA anyone? Wow), I never really HEARD @kendricklamar
2/ Today I did something different. As an English major, writer and editor who makes a living caring about words and their power, I felt compelled to go and listen to @kendricklamar ‚Äòs Damn and READ the lyrics as it went...
1/ I‚Äôve never been someone who has been a lyrics person when I listen to music. Call it a disability or something but I have trouble discerning the words a lot of times. I listen more to the voice as instrument combined with the melody and beat... BUT

Here's an exact kind of case liberals would pt to to say, no, that argument is wrong bc here's a business that could have taken action, but didn't, and it took an act of Congress for them to shut down a part of their site that could have been serving as a sex trafficking platform
Why should the government be forcing businesses to create wheelchair ramps, for example, the argument goes, when few if any people in wheelchairs shop at that particular business, and if they did, someone would help them anyway.
Purist Libertarians of the world, like Ron and Rand Paul, go so far as to believe that things like the Americans with Disabilities Act should never have been enacted because it created an undue burden on businesses.
Liberals believe government should do what it's doing or more to affect positive change in the world. Conservatives believe that is naive or worse -- a belief that is well-intentioned but has unintended consequences, like for one, creating an undue burden for businesses
The role of government is probably the hinge point that everything in public life and politics revolves around.

Trump: "I looked very seriously at a veto" but "because of tremendous gains for the military, that overroad any of our thinking."
Trump seems utterly frustrated by American democracy and the checks and balances it provides. He demanded the end of the filibuster and a line-item veto, two things that would balloon his power -- and he has no power to give himself.

People talk about the decline of facts in this country. You can't have a conversation with people who believe what LaPierre is saying because they're not rooted in fact, they're rooted in fear

What really scares zinniaphobes... (Dad joke courtesy of @HorsleyScott) https://t.co/KYH9erb1yu
For the record, the news media has way too much to do to have a "socialist agenda." We don't all get together, on conference calls, etc and plot it.
I love a schmear, not a smear
For all the tough talk from LaPierre, I wonder is this a speech going on offense or is this defensive?
For all the LaPierre talks I've heard, this one takes the cake for buzzwords and whataboutism
LaPierre calls for "effective, trained armed security" at schools. "God help us if we don't harden our schools and protect our kids."
LaPierre is basically arguing for what? Lawlessness?
LaPierre now deflecting to laws that haven't stopped illegal immigration or opioid use. "They don't care if their laws work or not; they just want more laws to get more control over people." 		That is some curious logic.
LaPierre makes argument that it's not guns, but a failure of school security, mental health system and... the FBI.
LaPierre says at @CPAC There's been a "rush of calls for more government... elites don't care about America's school system and school children."

8/ That's America; that's MY American story. My family certainly wasn't the "best of the best" by Trump's measures. But when he went back to Italy, and people criticized the U.S., he was her biggest defender, because she gave him and his family limitless opportunity.
7/ And in one generation, with resiliency and a chip on their shoulders, it was possible for my father's son with a funny name to have an Ivy League degree, even if he's still paying the student loans, and work covering the intricacies of the U.S. political system...
6/ They were good people who love their families and were willing to do whatever to try for a better life. People who were seen as not assimilating because they sounded funny on the stoops and "took over" neighborhoods...
5/ ...were willing to bear oceans, rough seas and an unwelcoming country where they didn't speak the language and, yes, looked different, because it was that bad where they were. They were that desperate....
4/ The Italisns who came to the US faced lower immigration hurdles, and it certainly wasn't the fairer-skinned doctor from Milan who headed to the U.S. It was the olive-skinned, struggling farmer from the South, who loved their homeland, but...
3/  I'm first generation. The reason my family emigrated from Italy wasn't because they had it easy. It was precisely the opposite. It was for that better life, for the American Dream. Economic prospects were bleak. My grandparents didn't have higher than a third-grade education
2/  It's the sentiment that the U.S. should not take in people from certain countries but accept them from others, that it should accept only those who fit into a "merit" system, not those struggling, escaping poverty, war or famine looking to better themselves and their families
1/ Let's get past the fact that the president said a curse word. I say swear words, once in a while. There, I said it. It's about the sentiment. So what is that sentiment?...

@realDonaldTrump 2/2 It was also a reminder Trump is checked out when it comes to policy/negotiating details. A president can't say, you figure it out, you'll negotiate that, when things get tough. It presents a policy leadership vacuum. And THAT's a real problem when you're trying to GOVERN.
1/ In many ways, that was @realDonaldTrump at his best. Combated the notion that he can't command a room/needs to be hanlded/or is out to lunch as "Fire and Fury" paints... BUT...
@MarkSKrikorian @JebBush Definitely
Trump: "My position is what the people in this room come up with."		And how's that worked over the past decade? Look at the HOUSE. Senate has done it.

@legendaryhound1 Interesting question. Twitter doesn't give us those crosstabs!
Readers have chosen the Fallout from Sexual Harassment #metoo and the Robert Mueller Russia Investigation #MuellerTime as the top two political stories of the year.		What do YOU think was the top political story of the year?
@TomCalen @davesteadman @courtneyknorris That's part of the calculation that some others have been saying, too. It's interesting. It definitely shows, though, how politics intersects with culture and what the culture expects from politics.
@VMurphy1787 No. Especially on twitter.
2/2 that means only 2 ppl can win ‚Äî either @davesteadman if it‚Äôs Mueller Probe or @courtneyknorris if it‚Äôs Harassment. Congrats &amp; good luck!
1/Voting wraps up on story of the year brackets soon. Unless something changes, going to be Mueller Probe-Sexual Harassment Fallout in final
@kcslp94 Great bracket! So close, but @davesteadman would wind up with 176 if it goes your way. You'd wind up with 170. VERY good though.

Winner faces 5 Paris deal withdrawal or 12 WH Chief of Staff John Kelly's remarks about the Civil War.
Winner faces 7 TPP torn up or 10 Trump's Pocahontas remark before Navajo Code Talkers in the White House.
Charlottesville violence + Trump's reaction vs. A majority of Republicans supporting marijuana legalization for the first time (@GallupNews)
This is a match up of undermining democratic institutions (Trump's attacks on the FBI, courts, the press, etc) vs. @HillaryClinton 's book. Both consequential this year. (Winner faces 7 Trump bombs Syria or 10 Price resigns)
Thanks, @courtneyknorris for the catch. I'm missing three games. Stand by for polls. Proof that everyone needs and editor!

And that's it for ROUND ONE. Voting closes in 12 hours from the posting. Watch for a new bracket tomorrow. To find all the polls from today's Round One and vote, check out my Twitter feed. @DomenicoNPR
Winner takes on winner of 2 Tax overhaul passage, 15 Putin-Trump meet. (This is a substitution. Originally had written Obama-Trump meet, but that was in 2016)
To explain 14, that's House Intel Cmte Chairman Devin Nunes going to the WH and getting info backing up the president. 		(Winner takes on winner of 6 North Korea missile tests/Trump's Rocket Man remarks or 11 Russian social media influence wider than first thought)
N.K. is for North Korea (obvs) and to expand on "Russia social media," this is social nets revealing Russian interference on their platforms was deeper than initially revealed.		(Winner takes on winner of 3 Gorsuch to SCOTUS, 14 Nunes to WH for info backing Trump)
Winner takes on 4 Rolling back regulations or 13 Trump's reversal on NATO, that it was no longer "obsolete"
Whoops. Doing this one again. Set the wrong time for the poll. I'll add up results to both. (See previous tweet for descriptor)
8 The Shrinking of the National Monuments could have big repercussions for open land. 	9 Trump's feud w Lavar Ball after UCLA players were caught shoplifting in China		(Winner takes on 1 @Comey fired, 16 Devos grizzlies comment)
NEXT REGION: Winner of this one takes on winner of the Sexual Harassment Fallout region.		(First matchup winner takes on winner of 8 The Shrinking of the National Monuments and 9 Trump's feud with Lavar Ball after UCLA players were caught shoplifting in China)
2 Alternative Fact is not just the phrase coined by Kellyanne Conway, but the entire year of, well, "Alternative" Facts. The Trump Org pulling out of Trump SOHO followed controversy related to the Russia investigation.		(Winner takes on 7 transgender ban, 10 Tillerson "moron")
Couldn't fit this, but 10 Tillerson "moron" is Tillerson's non-denial denial that he called Trump, the president, a moron behind his back.		(Winner takes on winner of 2 "Alternative Facts" and 15 Trump Org gets out of Trump Soho)
