This....does not sound like a tweet written by Trump himself. https://t.co/TOUXLUcuxg
"You see, as a leader I should be stoic in my outrage and silent in my rebuke. But stoicism is a luxury and silence is a weapon for those who would quiet the voices of the people. And I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right."
"Pundits and hyperpartisans will hear my words as a rejection of the normal order. You see i‚Äôm supposed to say nice things and accept my fate. They will complain that I should not use this moment to recap what was done wrong or to demand a remedy."

Woman claimed they were put back. They were not. Now they claim they will not refund the points at all-- points I had accumulated for years as a loyal customer that were lost because of their malpractice. Ridiculous and unacceptable. This is how you treat loyal customers?
@Enterprise I had my license but they still wouldn't let me rent even though it was being redeemed with points. They assured me the points were being put back on my account and I trusted them. I went to rent a car last week to find the points had not been reapplied to my account -- 1500
Never using @Enterprise again. Have been a loyal customer for years. Last year when I was flying back for my 10 yr high school reunion, my wallet was stolen in the airport. They wouldn't let me rent a car -- even with a friend's credit card -- because I didnt' have a credit card
