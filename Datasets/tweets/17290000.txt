The Trump campaign reached out to Roger Stone, a close confidant of Trump's who is known for his bare-knuckles political operations. Stone claimed to have connections to WikiLeaks, and campaign officials needed to know when Wikileaks would drop its next batch of documents.  40/
The cascade of stolen material was almost immediately picked up by American news outlets, conservative pundits and Trump supporters, who were happy to blast out anything with "Clinton" and "emails" in the same sentence.  39/
LEAKS AND CIGARS		July 22 was supposed to be a big Friday for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The party's convention was just days away.		But at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, WikiLeaks stole the limelight, releasing more than 20,000 stolen DNC emails.  38/
We "think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary ... so conflict between bernie and hillary is interesting," WikiLeaks wrote.		Using Guccifer, the Russian intelligence officers transferred the files to WikiLeaks, hoping for a big online splash.		37/
Over the next several weeks, WikiLeaks requested any documents from Russia related to Clinton, saying they wanted to release them before the Democratic National Convention when they worried she would successfully recruit Sanders supporters.  36/
The documents "were being shared as part of the Russian government's support of the Trump campaign."		Trump Jr. replied "if it's what you say I love it"		The meeting was held at Trump Tower in Manhattan on June 9. Trump Jr. attended along with Manafort and Jared Kushner.  ¬†35/

The DNC hired CrowdStrike, to identify the extent of the breach and to try to clear their networks of malware. 		Russian outreach found a willing audience in Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.		33/

Konstantin Kilimnik has ties to Russian military intelligence. Manafort also had worked for a Russian billionaire named Oleg Deripaska who is close with Putin.		Manafort's business had dried up after President Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia.  27/
Paul Manafort, a longtime Washington insider, had made millions as a political consultant for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Over that time, Manafort developed a close relationship with a man named Konstantin Kilimnik.   26/
Cohen had even gone so far as to reach out to the Kremlin directly for help, speaking with an official about ways to secure land and financing for the project.		While Cohen pursued the deal, another person with Russia ties joined the Trump campaign. Paul Manafort. 25/

Those damaging documents would be released online and damage Clinton's candidacy.		In a few short weeks, the hackers had penetrated their targets and hit the motherlode: the private Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.  19/
Like Watergate, it was a break-in. But this time, the burglary tools were emails disguised to fool people into sharing their passwords and in turn provide hackers unfettered access to their emails. The goal was to collect as many damaging documents as possible.  18/
Hackers in Russia's military intelligence, known as the GRU, started sending dozens of malicious emails to people affiliated with Clinton's campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee.  17/
As disinformation scrolled across American computer screens, an entirely different Russian operation readied its own volley.		In March 2016, as Clinton and Trump emerged as the leaders of their respective parties, Russian military intelligence officers began setting a trap.  16/
Internet Research Agency began secretly buying online ads to promote its social media groups.		By February 2016, they were ready. They planned to post about "politics in the USA,"  "use any opportunity to criticize Hillary (except Sanders and Trump‚Äî we support them)."		15/
The Russian trolls set up accounts that appeared to be associated with Black Lives Matter, the Tennessee GOP, Muslim and Christian groups and the American South. By late 2015, as Clinton sparred with Bernie Sanders, American media still saw Trump as a longshot. 14/
They bought U.S. server space and computer infrastructure to conceal the true origin of the disinformation they pumped into America's social media blood stream. They began preparing networks of fake accounts they would use like sock puppets to masquerade as U.S. citizens.  13/
The Russian employees traveled through Nevada, California and Colorado‚Äî to collect on-the-ground intelligence about an America that had become deeply divided on gun control, race and politics.		As they gathered the research, the trolls began planning an elaborate deception. 12/
It was a long game. Starting in mid-2014, employees began studying American political groups to see which messages fell flat and which spread like wildfire across the internet. The organization surreptitiously dispatched employees to the U.S.  11/
It would use deception, disinformation and the expansive reach of social media to spread "distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general." Spending millions, bankrolled by Yevgeny Prighozin, a man close to the Putin that he is known as Putin's chef.  10/
Using a game plan honed on its own people, the troll farm prepared to pervert the social networks ‚Äî Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram ‚Äî that Americans had come to depend on for news, entertainment, friendships and, most relevantly, political discourse.  9/
There, a group of tech-savvy Russian nationals, working at an organization called the Internet Research Agency, prepared "information warfare against the United States of America." The battleground would be the internet, and the target was the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  8/
RUSSIA, LOOKING TO INTERFERE		The plot began before Bernie Bros and "Lock Her Up," before MAGA hats and "Lyin' Ted," before there was even a thought of Trump versus Clinton in 2016. It started in 2014, in a drab, concrete building in St. Petersburg, Russia.	7/
Mueller followed a GOP campaign that embraced the Kremlin's help and championed stolen material to hurt a political foe. And ultimately, he revealed layers of lies, deception, self-enrichment and hubris that followed.  6/
Mueller has spoken loudly, if indirectly, in court ‚Äî indictment by indictment, guilty plea by guilty plea. In doing so, he tracked an elaborate Russian operation that injected chaos into a U.S. presidential election and tried to help Trump win the White House.¬†5/
It was just one small part of a sophisticated election interference operation carried out by the Kremlin ‚Äî and meticulously chronicled by special counsel Robert Mueller. 4/
Actually, Russia was doing more than listening: It had been trying to help Republican Trump for months. That very day, hackers working with Russia's military intelligence tried to break into email accounts associated with Clinton's personal office.  3/
The Democrats had blamed Russia for the hacking and release of damaging material on¬†Hillary Clinton.  On July 27, 2016, Trump said "Russia, if you're listening," looking directly into a television camera, "I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing" 2/

A judge ruled that Justice Department lawyers broke the law in their handling of the deal. The man who oversaw all of this -- was then-U.S. Attorney for Miami, Alex Acosta. He is now the U.S. Secretary of Labor, appointed by Epstein‚Äôs friend and (alleged child rapist) Trump. End/
Incredibly, Epstein slept just 13 months in a private section of a  county jail and was allowed to leave for work every day. Even worse, Epstein‚Äôs victims were never informed of his sweetheart deal or allowed to weigh in.   11/
Epstein was allowed to plead to just one state felony charge of soliciting prostitution and granted immunity from federal charges. Coconspirators -- known and unknown, potentially including the rich and powerful of Palm Beach -- also got immunity.  #Trump #Dershowitz 10/
But the billionaire‚Äôs young victims were eventually abused not once but twice -- first by Jeffrey Epstein, and then by the U.S. Justice Department. Its prosecutors -- presented with a mound of evidence agreed to a stunning slap on the wrist.  9/
A lengthy FBI investigation led to molestation allegations against Epstein from 36 different girls, many of whom were lured from troubled homes in what the Miami Herald later described as ‚Äúa cult-like scheme.‚Äù  8/
Epstein, a former Bear Stearns partner and billionaire financier, was accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage teen girls at his Palm Beach mansion between 2001 and 2006. The investigation began in 2005 with a tip to Palm Beach police about a 14-year-old girl.   7/
That doesn‚Äôt matter -- what‚Äôs so galling is that they didn‚Äôt care, that the word wasn‚Äôt even in their vocabulary.		Will Kraft get away with this? If his case goes down anything like that of his Palm Beach neighbor Epstein, he just might.   6/
Massachusetts equity fund owner John Childs. Childs has also donated a whopping $4.3 million to Republican causes, presumably to elect ‚Äúfamily values‚Äù candidates. Did Childs, Kraft and these other paragons of civic virtue realize that they were subsidizing slavery?  5/
These modern-day sex slaves worked for a clientele that were the supposed pillars of the affluent zip codes in and around Palm Beach -- members of the clergy and respectable business people, including, according to police, at least one other billionaire.   4/
There are actually two cases involving billionaire Palm Beach neighbors that are blowing up right now -- Kraft and the convicted teen-sex-abuser Jeffrey Epstein. In different ways, both men exploited women who were very young and very poor and whom they considered disposable.  3/
That‚Äôs because for decades, men -- and that‚Äôs who we‚Äôre talking about here, men -- with thick wads of bills and friends on the golf fairways of power have gotten away with everything.  2/
The real scandal here is the gross imbalance of power involving women who were held in¬†a form of human bondage¬†to serve as objects of gratification for powerful men intoxicated by their belief they can get away with anything.	 https://t.co/wzMwR3R5O6
Trump is currently on the path to continued North Korean nuclear proliferation, Kim's growing acceptance on the world stage, sanctions busting, and further US concessions like suspending joint military exercises -- all of which degrade US national security.   End/
Denuclearization isn't rocket science -- the International Atomic Energy Agency has a track record of developing, implementing and monitoring the denuclearization of various countries -- so Kim and Trump should invite them in to take stock of North Korean assets. 12/
Trump should emphasize that improving relations and establishing a permanent peace can only come after denuclearization.		If Trump is going to press Kim on denuclearization, he needs to move past photo ops and love letters and establish a way to inventory North Korean assets. 11/
Kim will likely push to make denuclearization the last thing he addresses -- when it should instead be the basis for achieving US goals.		North Korea's nuclear threat will continue to grow if we allow Kim to distract us with progress (real or superficial) in other areas. 10/
Trump has criticized his predecessor's policy of "strategic patience," every day Kim pretends to be "negotiating" means another day that he can spend making his nuclear arsenal, bigger, better and more dispersed. Even Pompeo said North Korea hasn't frozen its nuclear program.  9/
Moon may also try to hand Trump rose-colored glasses so that this diplomatic foray doesn't end.		Trump should expect Kim to suggest a third meeting. Extending negotiations somewhere into the future buys Kim time, and time is on Kim's side.  8/
China is Kim's most important economic partner and stands to gain financially if sanctions are lifted and trade with North Korea can resume. President Xi Jinping will continue to advocate for talks to continue, and now Vietnam has a stake in the game as it hosts the summit.  7/
Russia wants to maintain the status quo that keeps Kim in power and avoids the chances of a US military strike, possibly an increased US military presence in the region and a more pro-US leader rising to power in North Korea. China also wants to avoid a military confrontation. 6/
Trump's peers are probably using any engagements they have with him to push him to declare peace on the peninsula, including perhaps an armistice agreement to end the Korean War, because it serves their interests even if it doesn't yet serve ours.  5/
Trump has relied on a shadow cabinet of foreign leaders in the past. In addition to reports he agreed to withdraw from Syria after speaking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- he's taken a lot of direction from Moon when it comes to assessing Kim's intentions.  4/
