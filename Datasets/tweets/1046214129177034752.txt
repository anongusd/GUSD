Results have basically been more of the same so far- Hyde Smith seems set to pull out a narrow win, but Espy still has a decent shot. Will update when the first county completes its count
Gotten a bit better for Hyde-Smith, she is probably the favorite. This isn't the victory she probably hoped for, though.
Espy is overperforming by high single digits, but will it be enough? Moving to Lean R
Still way too early, but looking like Espy won't be blown out of the water, most likely a single-digit race.
