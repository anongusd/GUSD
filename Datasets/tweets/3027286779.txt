Co-Chair @RepCicilline has reintroduced the DISCLOSE Act of 2018. This legislation calls for more transparency by requiring disclosure of dark money spending to combat the #CultureofCorruption coming out of Washington. #ABetterDeal
The amount of corruption coming out of the #TrumpAdministration has created nothing but chaos &amp; dysfunction! The American people have had enough. It is time to end the #CultureOfCorruption. It is time for #ABetterDeal. https://t.co/P0VvxkQ7HS
#Janus ignores 41 years of legal precedent in order to undermine the ability of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and all public service workers to negotiate for decent pay and fair workplaces.
Rebuilding the America’s unions is central to rebuilding the American middle class. It’s a shame to see the Supreme Court fall for conservative efforts to take advantage of workers in the #Janus case.
Whether it’s getting a job or an education, accessing the news or expressing yourself online. A free and open Internet is essential to the success of our country. We need to restore #NetNeutrality.
Small businesses rely on #NetNeutrality to connect with customers nationwide online. These businesses use the Internet as an equal playing field to compete with larger corporations.
In the 21st century, access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right.
Despite what Republicans are claiming, there’s no sign whether the Trump Admin really HAS stopped separating families. It’s one thing to say it. It’s another to do it. #FamiliesBelongTogether
