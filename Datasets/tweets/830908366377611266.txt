How long do you think a politician like this spends wrestling with his conscience before funneling $3,133.19 to a President whose endorsement he wants? https://t.co/iLA5gu2fqr
How many members of Congress, who have a constitutional duty to conduct meaningful oversight of the executive, giddily participate in events at the Trump International Hotel, a taxpayer owned landmark where Trump is his own landlord and the emoluments flow like the $35 martinis? https://t.co/yQ6DmHdo8j
I hope the American people will long remember that Kuwait, Turkey, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Philippines and other countries have used the Trump International Hotel to funnel cash to Donald Trump — as have corrupt American politicians and political groups.	https://t.co/0OkL3ON1Mv
All members of Congress who attend this event should be ashamed of their complicity in the only ethics violation our founders sought to prevent. Good for @RepTedLieu for standing up against this corruption. https://t.co/Os0GPHKSBR
@KatyTurNBC @kenvogel @CPAC @HillaryClinton @CNN So many lies by this man.
The leader of the executive branch just said that there are elected officials in the legislative branch who hate America. Shame on him. He daily disgraces the high office he holds. He is unfit for office.
Trump just pointed to Mercedes Schlapp, whose husband runs CPAC. Anyone who cares about government ethics would have declined the invitation from her husband’s organization, pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.502. But White Housing has been lucrative for the Schlapps. https://t.co/UnIdKls0cj https://t.co/iKQb1IciKK
He also used this event as yet another opportunity to attack Jeff Sessions for recusing. He says, I don’t know how you recuse. This is probably one of the few true statements he’ll make today. The man hates government ethics.
Donald Trump just told CPAC, “Matt Schlapp is loving this. He’s saying this is a lot more than we paid for.” Let’s hope the statement that CPAC paid the President for an official speech is a figure of speech. The anti-bribery statute, 18 USC 201, applies to the President.
@LeahLitman I’m still trying to figure out how @petridishes hacked into my diary.

This is Trump’s most explicit commingling of personal interests and public office to date.		This is the tone from the top that leads his appointees to violate ethics rules.		This is shameless, corrupt and repugnant presidential  profiteering.		This is an invitation to graft. https://t.co/3Gce7RGEYW

Lowell’s statement means Kushner not only failed to tell him of Trump’s intervention but failed to do so even after Lowell publicly vouched for the lack of presidential intervention.

@AshaRangappa_ @EricColumbus I think that’s an important difference.
@EricColumbus @AshaRangappa_ It’s a matter of degree. Look at the difference in the covers. But I suppose the idea is the same.
@AshaRangappa_ I’m trying to think of any possible legitimate explanation. Do you suppose it’s possible they hope to include the actual text of any report that is released, even though it’ll be available on line, and then add “value” by included a silly introduction by Dershowitz?

This is a critically important issue. There's no reason for a lack of quorum. The Senate refuses to vote on the two Republican and Democratic nominees who are ready to serve. The MSPB is the body that protects America against the spoils system. https://t.co/sUyOpcwMIy
@nogryskoWFED @Heritage @USMSPB @OversightDems @GOPoversight Heritage is right about that, though it's 100% wrong in its claim printed in @GovExec yesterday that employees who appeal their firings to the MSPB sit on the payroll until the appeal is resolved. Employees are fired first, taken off the rolls, and only then permitted to appeal.
@pierre To be fair, the law was clear for half a century, during which time DOJ issued at least 4 pieces of guidance saying POTUS can't hire family in the White House. Then DOJ drank the Trump Kool-Aid and reversed its view at noon on Jan 20, 2017. Now we need a new law -- or a new DOJ!

@RepDonBeyer One fine day, I should think I would like very much to hear Mr. Kushner and President Trump testify about the errors in their government forms, a line of questioning that seems now in play after today’s inquiry into Mr. Cohen’s “Truth in Testimony” form. Maybe several fine days.

@MarkSZaidEsq @RepMarkMeadows He has clarified that he believes one company is owned by a government. I think that’s a fair clarification.
Rep. Meadows has now clarified  he believes a foreign govt is the largest owner of one of the companies. He had not made that clear in his exchange with Cohen. Cohen says he’ll amend his form if the committee’s reading of the form’s language differs from his attorney’s reading.
Rep. Meadows accuses Cohen of lying on his Truth in Testimony form, claiming the form asks about foreign contracts, because Cohen had contracts with foreign companies. That is false. The form asks about contracts with foreign governments, not foreign companies. See for yourself: https://t.co/XNqOVENeDg

At a minimum, we might not have a nominee who previously criticized the investigation.
Here’s your periodic reminder that the President fired the Attorney General for declining to stop an investigation of him (after having fired the FBI Director for the same reason). The pundits yawned, the Congress looked the other way and a new corrupt precedent was set.

@renato_mariotti The Senators know when assets are sold off because the law requires the trustee to send a letter saying an original asset of the trust has been sold off. If you don’t get the letter, you know you still have the asset.
@renato_mariotti Of course, Senate blind trusts aren’t as blind as executive branch blind trusts because the conflict of interest law doesn’t apply to Senators, so the trustees don’t always sell off the assets. They just sit there in the trust, and the Senator knows what the trust holds.
@renato_mariotti Based on this story it appears his existing blind trust didn’t meet the requirements of the Ethics in Government Act, so he would have had to break open the old blind trust, create a new one, and turn his money over to a truly independent trustee.

4/	- Increasing accountability and transparency for Hatch Act violations on the part of Presidential appointees by providing that the President will be deemed to have adopted disciplinary action proposed by the investigative agency, unless he/she rejects it in a public writing.
3/	- Clarifying that the anti-nepotism statute applies to appointed positions within the Executive Office of the President and the White House and putting to rest the (invalid) claim that a loophole in the existing statute allows violators to hold office without pay.

Whitaker: "I did not receive any written advice from the career ethics officials."		Make a note of this claim. I sincerely hope that any ethics official in possession of an email containing recusal advice to Whitaker will immediately supply that email to DOJ's Inspector General.
Mr. Whitaker's evasive answers, stalling and occasional borderline belligerence today only deepen suspicions regarding his appointment to lead the special counsel investigation and his role in it. The American people deserve candor about the slow motion Saturday Night Massacre.
For an alleged ethics expert, Whitaker sure showed some ignorance by saying a recusal applies only to a specific matter or  case, rather than all matters or cases involving a party. But a review of the complaints he filed at FACT™ should acquit him of any suspicion of expertise.
With the possible exception of Martin Shkreli, it's hard to remember a more disrespectful congressional witness than Matthew Whitaker.
The heroes of the story, as @RepJerryNadler said this morning, are the DOJ CAREER ETHICS OFFICIALS who, knowing the history of POTUS and his congressional allies for going after people who stand up for the rule of law, told Whitaker to recuse. Please retweet this to honor them.
