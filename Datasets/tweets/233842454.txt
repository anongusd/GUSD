Congress should (and I will) work to repeal laws that ostensibly grant legislative powers to the president. But even if Congress does no such thing, such laws are void under our Constitution, and any emergency declaration by the president for a non-emergency is likewise void.
It would mean that a simple majority of each chamber could delegate legislative powers to the president, but only a two-thirds majority or greater could reject their application to a particular case or repeal the delegation altogether.
Some have replied that Congress still retains legislative powers should the president abuse an emergency declaration. They note that Congress can pass legislation to override the president’s actions. Though true, this arrangement turns the Constitution on its head.
Can Congress make a law permitting the president to conduct the entire appropriations process by his declaring an emergency? Of course not. That would impermissibly grant him legislative powers. The same principle applies when addressing a portion of the appropriations process.
Congress cannot turn the executive branch into the legislative branch. Such an effort fails for lack of conformity to our Constitution. The validity of an emergency declaration is limited by the definition of “emergency” itself and cannot be expanded by statutory openness.
Congress can make no law permitting the president to assume permanent legislative powers, even in a single area, simply by his declaring an emergency. The president may act quasi-legislatively only in an actual emergency—when Congress has no time to act—and then only temporarily.
Laws like the War Powers Resolution and the National Emergencies Act are not—and, under our Constitution, cannot be—grants of legislative powers to the president. They were adopted to transition authority back to Congress when unilateral executive action is no longer appropriate.
Over the years, Congress has passed laws to create an orderly process for receding the president’s inherent emergency power as an emergency subsides—the War Powers Resolution and the National Emergencies Act are two examples.
Going back to the Framers of the Constitution, Americans have recognized the president’s inherent power as chief executive to act swiftly in an emergency, especially a sudden attack on the United States. But such power exists only so long as Congress has no opportunity to act.
A thread on national emergencies and our Constitution:		Congress makes laws.	The president executes laws.	The Supreme Court decides cases.		This is our constitutional system.		Congress cannot delegate legislative powers to the president by statute.
A national emergency declaration for a non-emergency is void. A prerequisite for declaring an emergency is that the situation requires immediate action and Congress does not have an opportunity to act. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is attempting to circumvent our constitutional system.
@steve_vladeck You’re employing a straw man if you’re suggesting that Meadows considers himself a libertarian.
What a bad (frankly, embarrassing) day for constitutional and fiscal conservatism. The Senate confirms Bill Barr as attorney general, congressional leaders conspire to advance a $333 billion wasteful spending bill, and @POTUS plans to declare an emergency for a non-emergency. 🤦‍♂️
These spending “deals”—going back to December—are just slight variations of the same terrible proposal. The changes are so insignificant they might normally be handled by voice vote. While everyone argues over a wall, more than $300 billion in these proposals goes unquestioned.

Today, I attended the funeral of my friend Walter Jones and said goodbye. Walter was a good man. I do not expect to meet another of his caliber in this life.
I can’t support legislation that endorses an expansion of the 2001 AUMF and continued intelligence sharing with the Saudis with respect to Yemen operations. Many of my colleagues share these concerns and hope it will be changed in the Senate. I’m skeptical, but I hope so, too.
Worse, the House made another change: It adopted an amendment to “clarify” that the United States may continue sharing intelligence with the Saudis, including on potential targets—directly undermining the legislation’s goal of ending U.S. involvement in the horrific Yemen war.
.@RepMcGovern &amp; co. saw the problem and drafted an amdt (w/@RoKhanna’s support) to remove the exception, but senators lobbied against it behind the scenes. McGovern ultimately withdrew the amdt, so the joint res endorses the executive branch’s broad application of the 2001 AUMF.
.@RoKhanna introduced text the Senate passed in 2018. It creates an exception for “Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces.” But Congress did not, via the 2001 AUMF, authorize force against nebulous “associated forces,” just 9/11 perpetrators.
I’ve introduced legislation to end U.S. military action in Yemen: https://t.co/pxKJ1iiX4Y. I couldn’t support yesterday’s legislation because it implicitly expands the 2001 authorization regarding 9/11. @RoKhanna is doing great work here, but others keep sabotaging his efforts.

@krinklyfig @JakeSherman @RepThomasMassie Our free society is built upon a commitment to principles.
@RealFacelessMan @byrdinator @DemocraticLuntz The legislation makes an exception for “Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces.” The notion of undefined “associated forces” is not part of the 2001 AUMF and significantly expands it. The AUMF authorizes force against the 9/11 perpetrators.
@byrdinator @DemocraticLuntz Oh, I see you’re also asking about the underlying legislation. I couldn’t support it after McGovern withdrew his amendment. Without his amendment, the joint resolution implicitly endorses an expansion of the 2001 AUMF.

Finally, it’s unfortunate but not surprising that the president didn’t mention the massive national debt—overwhelmingly the result of reckless spending. He signed several of these disastrous bills into law. This spending is unsustainable and threatens the prosperity of Americans.
On foreign policy, the president was hit or miss (as usual), but he’s right that it’s time to bring our forces home from Syria and Afghanistan. One war was never authorized, and the other has gone on for far too long.
As for the president’s policies on trade and tariffs, I have a couple book recommendations for him: https://t.co/RvAOjXnPxk
I’m pleased the president highlighted the importance of criminal justice reform, including passage of the #FirstStepAct. We need to do much more to reform the system at both the federal and state levels of government.
The president rightly denounced the destructive politics of partisanship. Unfortunately, he’s been anything but nonpartisan (see tweets). Americans deserve principled representation and honest policy debates, not politicians who incite suspicion, fear, and hatred of “the others.”
There were two outstanding lines in @POTUS’s #SOTU address:		“America was founded on liberty and independence—not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.”		“Great nations do not fight endless wars.”

Members of Congress haven’t been allowed to really amend legislation in years. It’s a top-down system—take it or leave it. And if the proposal is to keep growing the federal government, then I choose leave it. The system won’t change until forced to do so. https://t.co/LnWhVej480
More and more, when @POTUS discusses the “wall,” he’s really just describing an enhancement to existing border fencing. I don’t support this giant spending bill with or without the wall and with or without the immigration provisions, but Democrats may be missing an opportunity.
@LKlaraE @KristatheYoung1 I do not support the death penalty.
@KristatheYoung1 There are many difficult questions with respect to this issue, and the answers often aren’t as clear as people think. For example, a newborn will die if neglected, and the state would certainly prosecute parents for allowing that to happen. Few would object to such a prosecution.
@KristatheYoung1 Thanks. It boils down to whether you believe an unborn child is a human being. I do. The government’s purpose is to protect the rights of all persons within its jurisdiction. The Constitution requires that such rights, including and especially life, be protected equally.

@dancingkender I support paying all these workers and have voted for back pay in the past. I’d vote for it again, but this latest bill adds a new component: It automatically pays furloughed workers after any *future* shutdown without also allowing them to come to work. https://t.co/hjF3leglLE

@308__Winchester The bill doesn’t change that.
Under yesterday’s bill, furloughed federal employees will not be allowed to come back to work during a shutdown but will be paid automatically after any future shutdown. This bill was not carefully considered. https://t.co/4wW5oc3ye4
@KellyParker5 They are not furloughed. They will be paid after the shutdown regardless of this bill.
@308__Winchester Your assertion is false. Federal workers who are working during this shutdown will be paid when it ends regardless of this bill.
@BP29er As an essential employee, you’ll be paid after the shutdown regardless of this bill. My concern is that the bill automatically pays furloughed workers after all future shutdowns without also allowing them to return to work. That’s a bad policy.
@BP29er Thanks for your service and sorry for your challenges right now. This bill does not affect whether you will be paid.
@manny_lopez Thanks! Good to see you!
@AureliousBot @dmings The speaker did not allow us to amend it.
@TopRopeTravis “Obama denied the request” is a quote from the story. He was right. Federal law did not allow it.
@notianrapoport I voted against it because that was the right vote. Unlike most of my colleagues, I made an informed decision. I’m used to misinformation spreading about votes on topics like this. The difference between good legislators and bad is that the good care about facts, not perceptions.
@TopRopeTravis Nice try. This story is not about a vote. And the criticism is that I disagreed with the Michigan delegation and *agreed* with Pres. Obama on federal law, which the story notes. Do you think Pres. Obama was wrong about Flint aid?
@dmings You’re confused because the bill doesn’t make sense as written.
You’ve misunderstood my opposition to this bill. People will really recognize the problem when it plays out someday. If pay is guaranteed in future shutdowns, then furloughed workers should come to work and be paid on time. Under this bill, they are kept home and paid later. https://t.co/naz42hz2jf
The tweet below—with thousands of retweets/likes—highlights how easily misinformation spreads. Federal workers who are working will be paid *regardless* of this bill.

To make this more concrete:		Assume that furloughed federal workers will be paid for the period of any shutdown. Do you think they should go to work and be paid on time, or get sent home and be paid later?		Today’s bill sends them home and pays them later.
@metal4timmy No, the substantive part of the bill relates to furloughed workers—people who are sent home.
@jbendery https://t.co/RGyGRjaZON
I’ve voted for back pay after previous shutdowns, b/c those bills were limited to the existing shutdown. If people will automatically be paid after any future shutdown, as this bill requires, then why send them home and why not pay them on time? This bill was not properly vetted. https://t.co/43UnLURyMs
This is not a bill to okay federal worker back pay for just *this* shutdown; it changes permanent law so that in any future shutdown, workers will be paid but told not to come to work.

This is more likely to be resolved well by following constitutional process:		1. House and Senate vote on amendments to fund the wall at various levels.		2A. If they agree on an amount, send spending bill to @POTUS.		2B. If they reject all amounts, send spending bill to POTUS.

@jaketapper @kasie @MickMulvaneyOMB I think we had different impressions of what Mulvaney was saying. My impression was that he was simply pointing out that Ds also voted for the spending, and his evidence was the 60-vote threshold.		Regardless, you said his statement “wasn’t true,” not that he lied. My apologies.
@yoyabbayo Maybe my colleagues should try locking in those tax increases before voting to raise spending.		I’m kidding, of course, but making the point that each person should vote on each bill according to the principles the person ran on.
@jaketapper @kasie @MickMulvaneyOMB I don’t object to what you said on air. Please read my thread when you have a moment. Mulvaney pointed out that the debt increase involved bipartisan spending. He’s right. @kasie said he lied and blamed the rise mainly on tax reform. You agreed in a reply that Mulvaney had lied.

An addendum to show it continues:		Here are the main FY19 spending votes so far:		H.R. 5896		House: 377-20	Ds: 175-2	https://t.co/EPErza2F3l		Senate: 92-5	https://t.co/2ePlD02T3h		H.R. 6157		House: 361-61	Ds: 185-5	https://t.co/a4DxImig6G		Senate: 93-7	https://t.co/qRla3wiBP8		😵
I don’t absolve the tax legislation from its debt impact, as I noted when I voted for it. I believe in lower taxes and lower spending—limited government—and that’s how I vote. That said, the annual spending bills (on which I vote no) have *far* more debt impact than the tax vote.
This may seem like an academic concern, but it has significant practical consequences. If Americans don’t have the real facts about this impending fiscal crisis, then they won’t be able to properly address it. They certainly won’t pressure Congress to take the right steps.
My question for @kasie and @jaketapper is: What did @MickMulvaneyOMB lie about? The national debt is a critically important issue, and I’m afraid that many Americans are buying into the false narrative that one party—whichever one they’re not in—is the one at fault for the debt.

So, let’s take a look at all the FY17 and FY18 spending legislation that became law to see if @MickMulvaneyOMB is right that the spending bills “must have Democrat support.”
Being generous to @kasie (and others), let’s assume the tax law has an FY18 budget impact of a couple hundred billion dollars. That’s a lot of money—but far short of $2 trillion.		The main budget impact comes from mandatory spending and bipartisan-approved discretionary spending.
Keep in mind that the tax legislation didn’t even go into effect until 2018, half way through @POTUS’s tenure so far. The tax legislation is scored at $1.5 trillion spread over TEN years, yet @kasie blames it for $2 trillion in debt since 2017. The numbers just don’t add up.
First, @jaketapper is absolutely right that Republicans are to blame for the debt increase over the past two years (and more). But the main reason is not the tax legislation as @kasie suggests; it’s that Republicans (and Democrats) have supported and allowed spending to balloon.
Here’s the transcript of @MickMulvaneyOMB’s comments on @CNNSotu (as shared by @sahilkapur). Yesterday, @kasie and @jaketapper (whom I respect) suggested that Mulvaney was lying. But Mulvaney’s statement (at least here) is accurate. I’ll share the evidence in this thread. https://t.co/rzctyHocQn

@Bexmich Correct.
Whataboutism isn’t when you say the other side is wrong, too; it’s when you say the other side is wrong, too, and therefore my side is excused from wrongdoing.		It’s fine to note that both sides are wrong as long as you acknowledge that it cannot excuse either side’s wrongdoing.
@AudreySterlingC Republicans also booed me when I voted for speaker, and I don’t think it was good for them to boo her or me.
@AngryMongo @ShawJen1 I’m against that massive spending bill with or without a wall. https://t.co/78S0U6Lqmf

@YvetteMerial Oh, by all means, please enlighten us with your “facts.” I’d like to hear how legislation that scored at $1.5 trillion over TEN years, and which didn’t even take effect until 2018, caused a $2 trillion debt increase over 2017 and 2018.
@TimothyODonnel2 The GOP can’t message this way because most of them are just as responsible for these insane levels of spending as the Democrats.
@artiegold @keithdevens Yeah, I was pointing out that she is wrong.
@Keeva I said nothing about Democrats supporting the tax cut. Democrats do support most of the spending.
@Keeva Read the part quoted in my last tweet. Your assertion is false. I blame Republicans all the time. There are dozens of my statements like that one.
@JoeMNorwood I’m trying to get this straight. You think she’s saying the *debt* will increase $2 trillion over the next ten years? Deficits are annual and relate to a particular year.
@Bexmich Yes.
@Keeva Your assertions continue to be false: https://t.co/3NCkNOfUBM
@JoeMNorwood No, she’s talking about a “$2 trillion deficit increase under Trump.” If she meant deficit projections, then for which year or years? Moreover, her tweet would be just as wrong and my point would be just as strong. Annual $2 trillion deficits &gt; annual $150 billion from tax bill.
@Keeva You are either lying or unaware of which bills are the spending bills. First, I vote no on almost every spending bill. Second, Democrats routinely vote with Republicans to pass spending bills.
@Keeva Your tweet is false. You should pay more attention to your government, including how Democrats are voting.
@Keeva I’m the one who’s been criticizing Republicans and Democrats on spending for many years.
@JoeMNorwood I was correcting her mistake. She meant debt increase. Deficits are annual. The reason I then wrote “debt” over one year is because the tax bill did not apply to 2017.
@JoeMNorwood The tax bill took effect in 2018.
@Keeva I voted no on those defense spending bills, but as @MickMulvaneyOMB correctly pointed out, most Democrats joined most Republicans in voting yes. And that spending alone is magnitudes larger than the tax bill.
@Sam06136058 No, definitely not pooh-poohing. I’m pointing out that you cannot attribute $2 trillion debt to the tax bill over one year.
@dickius I was kindly correcting her error. She used “deficit” when she clearly meant “debt.” Please tell me what’s inaccurate about my usage.
Do you believe tax reform caused a $2 trillion debt increase in one year? Tax reform is roughly $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The debt increase is almost entirely due to bipartisan discretionary spending increases and bipartisan apathy toward ever-increasing mandatory spending. https://t.co/hjCD1EWHvw

I should add that my mother is Syrian! I’m proud of my heritage on both sides, though I more often have mentioned my father’s background because he was a refugee.
@BenReisterer Too little legal immigration, too much illegal immigration, and a poor process for dealing with refugees and asylum seekers.
@BenReisterer I’m not advocating that we build a “wall”; I’m saying it’s being given more prominence than it deserves. I’m not going to play the game these two parties are playing.
@BenReisterer I mean that it’s not remarkable to have walls, fences, barriers, structures, etc., at borders. We already have them. These things will not resolve our immigration issues, but they are not dealbreakers in a giant spending bill. Excessive overall spending is the real problem.
I am not aware of any “military version” of eminent domain. I am aware of executive overreach, and this sounds like it.

@Enopoletus @landry_randolph If goods or services are exchanged directly for goods or services, then there is no trade deficit, by definition, even if the parties have arranged to perform at different times.		If there is a credit storing value, then the parties are not employing a full barter system.
@Enopoletus @landry_randolph No, that is not a barter system.
@landry_randolph Oh, okay. My bad.
When a person voluntarily exchanges money for a good or service, that person is not harmed; he gets something of value in return. A trade deficit happens every time you use money to buy something. A barter system has no trade deficits; they are a *feature* of a currency system. https://t.co/obO7vksorF

The fact is that there has been no withdrawal from Syria. The president *is* consulting with advisers and others on the manner. If @POTUS were to avoid calling for a war’s end until the military and political establishment concur, then there’d be no end to any modern war.
@samwilkinson Yes. You’re asking if I’m willing to acknowledge that I’ve been correct all along? Weird question.
President after president can get us into wars—without public support, without congressional approval, in violation of the Constitution—but when @POTUS says he wants to get us out of a war (one that Congress never authorized), *that’s* what outrages the political class.

@BarbaraSmoyer It is. The range for negotiations has been roughly one to six billion dollars.
The wall funding amount—whether a few billion or a few billion more—will have little practical effect on whether and how it’s built.		One day, we’ll all wake up to realize that we allowed—encouraged—our government to bankrupt America because we couldn’t see past our partisanship.
Nobody should have supported such a monstrosity. Yet it passed the Senate without even a recorded vote—by voice.		The bill came to the House, a bit more wall funding was added, and Rs and Ds went nuts. But it’s the same crappy bill. Again, about 98 percent of the bill isn’t wall.
This shutdown fight is partisan theater.		The CR, with or without the wall, is awful. About 98 percent of the bill’s $300+ billion cost is not wall. The bill is massive, wasteful, and includes program authorizations that shouldn’t be in this spending bill or in any spending bill.

@hops68 Yes, it’s a problem, especially for candidates like me who work outside the political establishment and receive little PAC support. But there’s not a good constitutional solution.
@hops68 No, they both support a dysfunctional process. Limits need to comply with the Constitution. More important would be to change laws, like straight-ticket voting and unequal ballot access, that prevent competition.
@hops68 Both major parties are dysfunctional. In Michigan, our laws make it practically impossible to be elected outside these two parties.
@hops68 Because they are blinded by power.
@hops68 I vote yes more than half the time. The Constitution limits federal power; many items should be handled by states. Leaders also tightly control what’s voted on; zero unscreened amendments were allowed this term. The solution is to open up the process and allow real deliberation.
There will be a vote tonight on an appropriations bill known as a continuing resolution, or CR, to spend hundreds of billions of dollars and fund unconstitutional programs. The government will continue to grow recklessly and burden future generations. I’ll be voting no.

@johndpizzaman @SeptemberDresan I was right to vote against it. As written, the bill violated the Constitution; a Supreme Court opinion directly on point agreed that the bill was unconstitutional.

“The Asset Forfeiture Program is a top priority of the Department of Justice and has my strong personal support.”	—W. Barr
“While the Patriot Act was a major step forward and remedied FISA’s most severe problems, I believe FISA remains too restrictive….It still requires that the govt establish ‘probable cause’ that an individual is either a ‘foreign power’ or an ‘agent of a foreign power.’”	—W. Barr
William Barr is another unfortunate pick for attorney general. His record is one of empowering government, specifically the executive branch, at the expense of liberty and the rights of the people. We need an AG who will uphold the #4thAmendment and #5thAmendment, not erode them.
Perhaps the greatest current threat to liberty in America is our increasingly tribal environment, which closes minds to the honest examination of issues and ideas.
Yes, there are exceptions to the rule, e.g., items a government needs to operate, but such exceptions do not distinguish international trade from other trade.
International trade is like other trade in that it takes place between people or businesses, not countries. Believing that X country is buying/selling Y product from/to the United States likely leads to more mistakes in economic analysis than any other misconception about trade.
I am a Liberty Man. Trade is not raid. Voluntary exchanges make Americans wealthier. @POTUS’s tariffs, which create barriers to exchange, are paid for by Americans. Taxing Americans to steer our decisions is social engineering that reduces our economic power and makes us poorer. https://t.co/j2rsiN4l8n
@cabbageguy @KjParcher Thanks, but remember he’s one person in charge of an entire branch of government. Congress doesn’t work that way. I’m one of 535. It’s fine to criticize an individual member of Congress, but one should acknowledge my power is far more limited. I can’t change everything by myself.
@KjParcher @cabbageguy Did that motto apply to Pres. Obama’s tenure? Were you upset when people criticized him? Does it apply to Pres. Trump? Are you upset when he criticizes others? That happens nearly every day. People like to say they follow certain mottos, but they rarely follow them consistently.
@cabbageguy I do work to influence them, every day. It’s a difficult task, and there are many incentives for them to continue to do wrong. They are literally bribed and paid to do the wrong thing. And those who do the right thing are often criticized more than those who do the wrong thing.
@cabbageguy @POTUS I voted no. He signed yes. He’s welcome to veto and negotiate.

May his memory be eternal. https://t.co/7TqK5rtAwv
@johndpizzaman @SeptemberDresan Different article/time period/issue and also misleading. That one *is* about a vote, but not specifically Flint. The legislation allowed around 100 areas—including some whole states—to qualify for special funding, regardless of current circumstances, and it excluded my district.
@SeptemberDresan This headline (and article) is often used to mislead people. 1. It’s not related to a vote, just a statement. 2. Pres. Obama is the person who denied the request for federal disaster aid because it wasn’t authorized by law, and I agreed with him that the law did not authorize it.

@JoelShoe I feel like he just doesn’t understand, but I imagine someone in his administration has tried to explain it to him.

When F.A. Hayek wrote this essay, he was describing European conservatism, not American conservatism rooted in classical liberalism. Increasingly, though, American conservatism resembles the European conservatism he warned about. https://t.co/rH4gA35MTu
Most Americans believe in liberty, but the collectivist ideologies of nationalism and socialism—two sides of the same coin—have been gaining traction. Both center on empowering the state to control people’s lives. These twin ideologies will dominate our future if we don’t engage.

I’m asking for your vote so I can continue to advance our principles in the next Congress—and continue to do it in a way that is respectful and persuasive to people of differing political backgrounds.
Together, we have spread the message of limited government, economic freedom, and individual liberty.
I re-introduced a well-crafted balanced budget amendment to get government spending under control, and I introduced several bills and amendments to secure our constitutionally protected rights.
I have supported cutting taxes for everyone and simplifying the tax code. I have opposed reckless increases in federal spending and extensions of unconstitutional or wasteful programs.
In the last two years, I have fought against warrantless spying on Americans and the use of civil asset forfeiture to confiscate property without due process.
You elected me to stand strong as a fiscal conservative against the growth of government. With your support and encouragement, I have done that.
You elected me to represent the entire district, not just special interests or the most vocal. You elected me to uphold the Constitution and our shared American principles, to be consistent, and to be an independent voice in Washington.
It's been an honor serving as your representative in Congress, and I'm asking for your vote again today.

#HR6729 undermines consumer privacy by shielding banks from liability for violating agreements with their customers to protect their personal information.
#HR6729 can even protect disclosures that were not made in good faith. Someone could share a false accusation and still be immune.
Even if the accused is innocent and never charged with a crime, their reputation may be destroyed, and banks may choose to close their accounts, effectively blocking them from the financial system.
#HR6729 also invites due process violations. The bill allows nonprofits to go to banks and accuse people of serious crimes, while being shielded from liability.
#HR6729 applies #PatriotAct language to new categories of information, giving the government more power to engage in warrantless data collection and sharing—including on Americans.
#HR6729 is described as involving voluntary data sharing, but it also includes language from a section of the #PatriotAct that the government has used to warrantlessly demand customer information from thousands of companies.

@Beth32017 @CathyAnnOfen @TammyT01 @glassceiling02 Yes, please read it again. It’s natural to be concerned that the president has committed an impeachable offense, to support a full investigation, and to hope for the sake of the country that the president (even one I didn’t vote for) is not guilty of any such offense.
I hope that we don’t get to this point, but I think it’s important, given recent news, that members of Congress share their thoughts on this matter with the people they represent.
Upon impeachment by the House, the Senate conducts a trial. Only here does the vote represent a finding of guilt. While there is reasonable disagreement about the proper burden of proof, I believe that a very high standard must be met to overturn the results of an election.
Impeachment is equivalent to a grand jury indictment. If the House votes to impeach someone, that is not the same as a finding of guilt; it is merely a finding of probable cause that the accused has committed an impeachable offense.
Impeachment proceedings are a quasi-legal, quasi-political process reserved for situations that present substantial evidence of egregious wrongdoing by the officeholder.
We don’t impeach simply because we dislike a person or disagree with his policies. If you’re unhappy about @POTUS, then don’t vote for him in 2020. The electoral process should determine who holds the executive power.
Based on the deliberations of the Framers of the Constitution and Federalist No. 69, I believe that a sitting president should not be criminally prosecuted. Before facing ordinary criminal liability, he first would have to be impeached, tried, convicted, and removed from office.
We should allow Robert Mueller to complete his investigation and issue his report before taking any action potentially affecting the president’s tenure.
Many of the allegations against @POTUS are serious and should be taken seriously, especially by members of Congress.

@DanielLMcAdams We should oppose both the targeted tax break and the crony project. To allow the government to provide special tax treatment for social engineering is to encourage and empower the government to raise everyone’s taxes so it has the room to provide that special treatment.
@DanielLMcAdams No, it does not assume that. Moreover, unless you’ve decided not to pay taxes, you must live with the consequences of government tax decisions. To support a targeted tax break is to commit the broken window fallacy. The opportunity cost is a broad-based tax cut that was forgone.
@treesplittr Our Constitution grants Congress only limited powers. Most are listed in Article I, but some are in amendments to the Constitution. This hotline is not authorized under any of these powers.		Article V provides an amendment process if the people want to give Congress a new power.
@jimhigdon I’ll let you know when I see the legislation! 🙂
@jimhigdon Article V provides for the amendment process. Many people today believe the Constitution is “living” and seek to “amend” the Constitution outside of this process. I clearly do not subscribe to that.		The Air Force was founded as part of the Army.
@jimhigdon The correct question under our Constitution is: What is the authority for the legislation? We live under a Constitution that grants Congress limited, enumerated powers.

We libertarians need to be smarter and more effective in our approach. Acting like partisans—pushing demagoguery and tribalism—is a self-defeating proposition. Stand strong on your principles; you’ll find most Americans standing with you.
Worse yet, thanks to the press conference, we’re likely to see more ineffectual sanctions bills and resolutions of condemnation against Russia, which will serve primarily to stunt further efforts at diplomacy and dialogue.
The widespread reaction on Capitol Hill, for example, has been to rally around the intelligence community. People are proposing resolutions of support for the FBI, despite its dubious track record and unconstitutional activities, particularly with respect to the #4thAmendment.
Nor are libertarian values advanced when the effect of the president’s press conference—set aside the intent—is to further isolate our country from Russia.
People then connect our principles to the president’s failings, which have nothing to do with libertarianism.
The general public are not more likely to see themselves as libertarian when, for the sake of “owning the necons,” prominent figures associated with libertarianism conflate libertarian-style governance and Trump-style governance.
When a libertarian’s political prime directive becomes “owning the neocons” (or “owning the libs”) rather than advancing libertarian ideals, then that person undermines libertarianism as a philosophy.
The virtue being signaled is opposition to all things “neocon.” If someone doesn’t like how the meeting transpired, it must be because that person is a Deep State anti-Trump neocon warmonger, etc.
To suggest that anyone critical of the president’s conduct opposes diplomacy is to employ a strawman argument. It’s virtue signaling, not libertarianism.
Even the president ultimately recognized that the press conference did not go well, as he tried to correct his remarks that exonerated Russia. Oddly, it took him more than a day to do so. One wonders why the White House didn’t act more quickly if it were simply a misstatement.
Perhaps it was just the president showing insecurity, once again, over the legitimacy of his election. Perhaps it was a sign of a more troubling entanglement with Putin. Whatever the case, the press conference was counterproductive to the goal of improving relations.
The impression it left on me, a strong supporter of the meeting, is that “something is not right here.” The president went out of his way to appear subordinate. He spoke more like the head of a vassal state.
I suspect that many of the people defending the press conference performance did not watch it in its entirety—or at all. If they had, they would know that it didn’t achieve the desired effect of bringing America and Russia closer; in fact, it did just the opposite.
Yet, that’s precisely the false conclusion some are making. I’ve heard it said that anyone who disapproves of what took place at the press conference is pro-war or anti-Trump. No, some of us are just concerned about the bizarre behavior of our president at a press conference.
We must not, however, fall for the logical fallacy that because diplomacy and dialogue are good, @POTUS’s performance at the press conference was good.
I believe that this aspect of libertarianism—the desire to seek friendship and peace whenever possible—is among its most appealing qualities.
For my part, I have urged presidents to meet with the leaders of Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and other countries to build better relationships. These interactions make it possible to change behavior, to turn foes into friends.
We say diplomacy and dialogue are good. Few Americans would disagree with that. Peace and prosperity can’t be secured without communication and engagement.
A thread for my fellow libertarians on the #HelsinkiSummit:
Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS—as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government. If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.
The House voted today on an inane resolution regarding ICE. The resolution makes several dubious claims and denounces calls to abolish ICE. I wouldn’t abolish ICE without an alternative, but there’s no reason to treat a federal agency as though it’s beyond reproach and reform.

Left and right are strategically blundering on the SCOTUS nominee.

In 2015, Kavanaugh declared “the Government’s metadata collection program is entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.”		He cited Smith v. Maryland, a case whose facts bear almost no resemblance to the metadata program.		Gorsuch recently ripped SvM in a #4thAmendment case.
Kavanaugh is not another Gorsuch—not even close. Disappointing pick, particularly with respect to his #4thAmendment record. Future decisions on the constitutionality of government surveillance of Americans will be huge. We can’t afford a rubber stamp for the executive branch.

Happy birthday, Frédéric Bastiat!
Bottom line: Targeted tax breaks are bad.
This illustration is not meant to suggest that humans can design a perfect tax code. But when the government intentionally gives a special tax break to one entity, not only is the government undermining the Rule of Law, but it also is knowingly harming the economy.
We can imagine variations of this illustration. For example, maybe Al, Bo, Cy, and Di already live in the same state, and then the government gives Di a special tax break for "economic development." The end result, however, is the same: The special break is economically harmful.
When advocates of Di's special tax break talk about the economic growth and jobs it will create, they commit the broken window fallacy: https://t.co/vWuTVtjDeV. They ignore the break's opportunity cost; the government has deprived Al, Bo, and Cy of a tax break. That's a net loss.
For a primer on why the free market is superior to central planning, read this: https://t.co/lcuHhXtS4O. In short, keeping more money in the hands of everyone produces better economic outcomes than giving a special advantage to one person.
We could rerun this illustration at a much lower level of government spending, and the relevant analysis again would be how best to tax at this level of spending: Is it best to give one person a very large tax break or to give everyone a modest tax break?
If your reply is "give others a tax break, too," then you've missed the point. You can't give others a tax break AND hold all else equal. The budget must be balanced; government spending would have to be cut. The relevant analysis is how best to tax at a GIVEN level of spending.
Advocates of Di's special tax break are saying that, ALL ELSE EQUAL, they would rather give Di a very large tax break (75%) than give everyone a modest tax break. In other words, they believe that government central planners can outperform the market by shifting money to Di.
What about the claim that Di's arrival will boost the economy and more than pay for her special tax break? Many of the proponents of this view seem unaware that they are advocating central planning, a main tenet of socialism. To see this, let's return to the illustration.
The fact that Di is receiving services paid for by others rather than dollar bills from others does not make the transfer any less a welfare subsidy.
Meanwhile, Di is living large. She is paying only $1 in annual taxes while receiving $3.25 to $4 in government services. The difference is a welfare subsidy to her, no less than if the government forced Al, Bo, and Cy to write her a check or hand her some cash.
Even if the government convinces Di to bear some of the additional tax burden, or finds another way to raise revenue, if any portion of the $3 comes from Al, Bo, and Cy, they will pay more in taxes than they receive in services, thanks to the government's special break for Di.
Di's annual taxes are fixed at $1, so the additional $3 will have to come from Al, Bo, and Cy. Consequently, Al, Bo, and Cy will have to pay $5 per person in taxes, to receive $4 per person in services, thanks to the government's special break for Di.
Suppose the government attempts to maintain government services at the level provided prior to Di's arrival, i.e., $4 per person in services. Since the state now has four people, the government will need to collect $16 in taxes. It currently collects $13.
In other words, Al, Bo, and Cy now get less for each tax dollar; their effective tax rate has gone up, thanks to the government's special break for Di.
Now the state has four people. The government collects $13 in taxes ($4 + $4 + $4 + $1) to be spent on services. But because government services are distributed equally, Al, Bo, and Cy now receive only $3.25 each in services ($13 / 4), even though each still pays $4 in taxes.
Suppose the government wants to attract a new person, Di, to the state. The government is excited about all the business Di will bring, so it promises Di that her annual taxes will be only $1 if she makes the move. Di is thrilled and accepts the offer.
Imagine a state with only three people: Al, Bo, and Cy. Each person pays $4 in annual taxes, so the government collects $12 total. The government spends all that money providing services. It distributes services equally among its residents and is required to balance its budget.
Since many people continue to unwittingly promote socialism with their misguided insistence that "every tax cut is good," I'm going to illustrate why a TARGETED (e.g., just for one entity) tax break is welfare, economically equivalent to a subsidy, and a cost to other taxpayers.

@FoodTrucksRepor I don’t have to Google it. A Senate report can’t amend the Constitution.
Here’s my floor speech from 2011 regarding @POTUS44’s unconstitutional war in Libya: https://t.co/DgDHqcEBKJ. Please view &amp; share. @POTUS risks making the same mistakes in Syria. The people must speak on war through the votes of their representatives. Our Constitution demands it.
It’s a sad commentary on our politics that people will approve or disapprove of acts of war not based on our Constitution, facts, and deliberation, but rather based on the letter—R or D—following the president’s name. https://t.co/wccIl2uLvO
@clarkriemer Jefferson did receive authorization from Congress to engage in hostilities with the Barbary pirates.
@cabbageguy I’ll take process first any day. Favoring results over process is the same as holding that the end justifies the means. Process versus results reflects the main difference between America (process-focused) and despotic regimes everywhere (results-focused).
@cabbageguy It’s the duty of the executive branch to make the case to Congress and present evidence. They did not even attempt to do that, so the only appropriate vote would be no.
The Constitution makes offensive military action without congressional approval unconstitutional. The War Powers Resolution is unnecessary but consistent in that regard. Don’t fall for the lie that the WPR grants authority for “limited” offensive action without approval. Thread: https://t.co/UOfe7JxiI3
But those factors should wash out in the aggregate. The fact that the tallies are so different indicates that something else is at work at the macro level: double standards, selective outrage, and hypocrisy.
There are good reasons why a particular person might not have signed one of the letters: The House membership is different. In addition, a person might not have known about one of them, or might have been sick or away that day, or perhaps had a nuanced but valid objection to one.

@KyleKashuv Thanks. That’s not the only power we have. The Constitution’s Framers gave Congress the power to commence war and the president the power to conduct war. Debates and writings show they intended for the president to take offensive military action only upon congressional approval.
@KyleKashuv Weird criticism, b/c I’m the guy saying the War Powers Resolution is unnecessary. Without the WPR, the prez still can’t take offensive action without congressional approval thanks to our Constitution. Point of thread was to critique those who claim it does something it does not.
Witness the hypocrisy that our two-party system breeds: Check out these similar letters warning the president about commencing offensive strikes against Syria without congressional approval.		2013 signers: 119 Rs, 21 Ds	2018 signers: 15 Rs, 73 Ds	Very few of us signed both. https://t.co/40VEVtGwnq

You can read the War Powers Resolution here: https://t.co/0LLDYKOnRk.
The War Powers Resolution does not confer any new authority on the president to take offensive military action without congressional approval (nor could it). It instead checks the president when he enters our Armed Forces into hostilities for constitutionally permissible reasons.
If there is an attack on our country, we expect the president to respond swiftly. The War Powers Resolution therefore gives him 60-90 days. The Framers of the Constitution agreed that the president should have the “power to repel sudden attacks” without congressional approval.
The War Powers Resolution does provide a 60-90 day timeline, but that’s to account for situations implicating §1541(c)(3), “a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.”
Why then do some people say the president always has 60-90 days before needing approval? It probably stems, in most cases, from a misreading of (or failure to read in part or entirety) the War Powers Resolution.
Read (1), (2), and (3) carefully. Is there any suggestion that the president can take *offensive* military action without congressional approval? No. The only situation in which he may dispense with congressional approval is to *defend* against a sudden attack on our country.
…in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.

@RepThomasMassie @SenatorBrophy I’ve voted for some, too—mostly veterans appropriations; never an omnibus.
Take a stand today. Be honest with yourself and with others. Don't let the lie consume you. We live in a great country with great people. We can choose to live together in liberty or instead live apart in captivity.
And where hypocrisy thrives, virtue recedes. Without virtue, liberty dies.
Partisan politics, misleading or emotional bill titles, and 4D chess theories are manifestations of the same lie—that the text of the Constitution, the text of legislation, and plain facts do not matter; what matters is what you want to believe. From this comes hypocrisy.
The only way to restore limited government, economic freedom, and individual liberty is to stop falling for the lie.
The omnibus is one of the worst—and most costly—pieces of legislation ever to become law. Period. That's why I voted no.
@KathySc65174870 No, I mean that Congress could pass a new appropriations bill to override the current one, or Congress could pass a supplemental appropriations bill. The president would have to sign such a measure into law; until then, he must follow what he just signed.
@KathySc65174870 This is sound advice.
@KathySc65174870 A new appropriations bill will be due September 30. Without further congressional action, the president must expend amounts from the Treasury in accordance with the law he just signed. It is one of the biggest spending increases in history.
@camillevaldez10 What you’re posting is completely false. An omnibus is signed by the president because it’s a law, which requires a presidential signature. A budget is not signed by the president because it’s not a law.
@camillevaldez10 No link can alter reality.
A law can exist for any duration. Appropriations (spending) laws are generally annual or shorter. Discretionary does not mean at the president’s discretion; it means Congress must appropriate periodically (annually) or the funding runs out. Mandatory spending keeps going. https://t.co/3jJhok6wa3
@camillevaldez10 You are literally making this up. Both of your claims are false.
Another bogus claim is that this letter (https://t.co/eqaeSSxx8C) means president can repurpose approps as he likes. It means no such thing. Omnibus lets him designate some global health activity spending as emergency, so it won’t count toward spending cap. This letter does that.
#GoBlue! #FinalFour!
I keep seeing the same absurd claim going around on social media—that the omnibus is not so bad because it’s not a budget. This is totally backward. The omnibus is law; a budget is not. A bad budget is irresponsible but toothless. The omnibus (spending bill) does the real damage.
@RenaeCartierM No, that is not true.

@vanvalkt That wasn’t similar. The main form of the tax cut bill was available for a few weeks, and it was significantly shorter than the omnibus. We were given enough time to read and understand it. That bill was also roughly one-tenth the dollar value of the omnibus.

Trade deficits are a feature, not a bug, of a system of voluntary exchange. Only in a (theoretical but not possible) system of total government control and central planning could trade deficits be eliminated—and that would be a world of universal slavery and extreme poverty.
This basic economic concept applies to international transactions just as it applies to neighborhood transactions.
Trade deficits do not mean that anyone is taking advantage of anyone else. The grocery store will have a trade deficit with a farmer or supplier, just as you have a trade deficit with the grocery store.
When any customer buys more from any business than the business buys from the customer, the customer has a trade deficit with the business.

These new standards will open up the legislative process by increasing access to congressional documents.
The Searchable Legislation Act requires every bill, resolution, and document produced by Congress to be created, transmitted, and published in searchable electronic formats, consistent with recommendations from a congressional data task force the bill codifies.
Requiring that bills reproduce amended sections of law and show how the bill would change them—similar to the “track changes” feature in Microsoft Word—will allow members, staff, and constituents to better understand federal legislation.
Without context, provisions to strike text, repeal sections, or insert new language provide little meaningful information about what the bill does.
The Readable Legislation Act requires every bill to show the changes the bill makes to the full text of existing sections of law the bill repeals or amends.

Many of the congressmen who claim corruption at the highest levels of the DoJ/FBI just voted to reauthorize a section of FISA (#FISA702) that is far more susceptible to abuse by those same officials than the section allegedly abused in the memo. See my thread: https://t.co/XpwxhLhL9K

RT @rareliberty: .@JustinAmash: If Republicans are so upset about FISA abuse in Nunes memo, why did they reject #FISA702 reform last month?…
The release of this memo isn’t enough. The public deserves to see the underlying evidence, if any, as well as the Democratic memo. But the bigger question is: Why did GOP leaders push to reauthorize #FISA702 last month if they believed these abuses were happening? See my thread: https://t.co/XpwxhLhL9K
Congress now has an obligation to re-examine #FISA702 and pass reform legislation like the #USARIGHTSAct to protect the rights of the people we represent.
If the speaker and others believe abuses are occurring in the execution of one section of FISA, then why would they insist on reauthorizing another section of FISA (702) that has far greater potential for abuse?
But #FISA702 is far more dangerous. It permits the FBI and other agencies to conduct unconstitutional, warrantless searches on millions of innocent Americans (whose communications were incidentally collected while targeting foreigners overseas).
The central allegation is that a warrant was obtained fraudulently or without sufficient cause. If true, it shows the dangers of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, something @libertycaucus and @freedomcaucus members have been saying for a long time.
Unlike #FISA702, which authorizes systematic violations of the #4thAmendment, the section of FISA discussed in the memo requires probable cause and a warrant.
Given the current rhetoric from @SpeakerRyan and others, it represents a breach of the public trust that, just a few weeks ago, he and many of the memo's biggest pushers were demanding the reauthorization of #FISA702, opposed by a bipartisan coalition of liberty defenders.
Throughout this process, members of the @libertycaucus and @freedomcaucus have called for the public release of evidence supporting the memo's allegations. We also have called for the release of the Democratic memo (which I have read).
I'm glad that the Republican memo has been released. It makes many conclusory assertions, some of which are serious.
Just three weeks ago, @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi @DevinNunes &amp; @AdamSchiffCA teamed up to push a reauthorization of #FISA702 over my and others’ objections. The speaker gave a dramatic floor speech about the importance of giving the FBI power to violate everyone’s civil liberties.

FY 2017 saw the highest annual budget deficit since FY 2013.		FY 2018 will be even worse.		The only “deals” these parties cut are ones that grow government at your expense. https://t.co/X5Ws1nzeRS
The success of this Congress in “building a safe, strong, and proud America” will depend not on how “well” Republicans and Democrats choose to overspend, but on whether they can resist the urge to do so.
In the coming weeks, it’s expected that both parties will vote to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more over the next two years, increasing spending by the largest amount since President Obama’s first term. These spending levels are unsustainable.
The U.S. government is now more than $20 trillion in debt. We closed fiscal year 2017 with a $666 billion deficit—the second highest annual deficit of the last five years and a figure unheard of before the Obama stimulus. https://t.co/02LExN3Jxe

I’ve submitted the @RonWyden-@RandPaul-@RepZoeLofgren #USARIGHTSAct as an amendment to replace #S139, the unconstitutional #FISA702 bill. We will defend our Constitution and our rights. https://t.co/5czmQheHrq

I will oppose #S139 and have introduced a substitute amendment consisting of the #USARIGHTSAct. Unlike #S139, it limits the mass collection and broad use of Americans’ data, and requires a warrant to search for it—as the #4thAmendment requires.
…and #S139 permits the use of warrantlessly collected data to prosecute Americans for crimes having nothing to do with foreign intelligence or national security.
#S139 allows the government to warrantlessly collect Americans’ communications and warrantlessly search all #FISA702 data for information on Americans,…
Some of my colleagues think the #4thAmendment is a relic that should be ignored. This week, they are pushing a bill, #S139, that violates the rights of every American, under the guise of protecting us from “dangers.”

…and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,…
It would be unconstitutional (thus illegal) and reckless for Congress to continue allowing the federal government to warrantlessly amass this kind of information on Americans.
They go on to say that searching those communications for an American “could potentially produce a composite picture of a significant slice of an American’s private life.”
According to members of @PCLOB_GOV (independent oversight board), the gov’t has used #FISA702 to collect &amp; store Americans’ communications that “may contain sensitive and confidential matters having nothing to do with the foreign intelligence purposes of the Section 702 program.”

@PAIDtriot @MattWelch That tweet is from 11/19/16. Wake up.
With the expiration of #FISA702, Congress has the opportunity to reverse the government’s illegal erosion of our #4thAmendment-secured right to be free from warrantless searches and seizures. There’s only one bill circulating in the House that does that: the #USARIGHTSAct.
Supporters of the #USARIGHTSAct include @ACLU @FreedomWorks @NAACP @C4Liberty @demandprogress @IndivisibleTeam @ALALibrary @CenDemTech @GovAcctProj @BrennanCenter &amp; @OTI.
Other House bills, like the #USALibertyAct, would reauthorize all the government’s #FISA702 spying while doing little to protect our rights, and the #FISAAmendmentsReauthorizationAct would actually expand the government’s authority to conduct warrantless surveillance!
#USARIGHTSAct:	✅ substantially and permanently limits the collection of Americans’ data	✅ requires a warrant to search for Americans’ communications in the government’s massive stores of #FISA702 data &amp;	✅ limits the use of warrantlessly collected data to prosecute Americans.
@MattWelch https://t.co/Manmojqa2c
Reauthorizing #FISA702 while protecting Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights is easy—pass the @RonWyden @RandPaul @RepZoeLofgren @JudgeTedPoe #USARIGHTSAct (#S1997/#HR4124).
Section 702 of FISA allows the government to conduct warrantless searches on Americans and maintain massive troves of our data—but it is about to expire. Congress now has 15 days to decide whether to protect the #4thAmendment or let the government continue to eviscerate it.

The #LibertyAct passed committee 27-8. It allows the government to search our private data without a warrant—in violation of the #4thAmendment. It’s another bill, like the #FreedomAct, that furthers violations of our rights under the guise of protecting our rights.

@FoxeoGames You're still misunderstanding. The directive allows *forfeiture* in states that ban it. Even in those states, there may be lawful *seizure*.
@FoxeoGames "Seized" and "forfeited" are not the same thing.
@FoxeoGames It seems you're misunderstanding. The AG's directive allows forfeiture in states that have banned forfeiture.

@OrinKerr Perhaps you don't agree that 4A provides broad protection to private property, but I think we both agree that the bill is poorly drafted.
@OrinKerr An open field viewable from outside the property is not protected against searches that do not require trespass.
@OrinKerr "Safety" presumably includes preventing criminal/terrorist activities near WMATA. Bill doesn't contemplate potential abuse of MSC authority.
@OrinKerr I agree with your general observations, but courts haven't sufficiently protected rights. 4A requires probable cause &amp; warrant for searches.
@OrinKerr This bill does authorize a #4thAmendment violation. Congress has a duty not to pass such broad language even if Constitution nullifies it.

Under #6thAmendment, Arpaio should have received jury trial, but SCOTUS disagrees. In executing its functions, SCOTUS has final say on 6A.
Arpaio was convicted of defying court order to stop violating #4thAmendment. It's a pardon of a govt official who ignored Bill of Rights.

@Gena_Rinckey Yes, of course. Please call my Grand Rapids office at (616) 451-8383 and ask for Ben. I'll also forward the article to my staff to read.
@bmolde @JordyMVB It was gerrymandered—to make it less compact and less Republican than before. Portions of Kent County were replaced with Calhoun County.
@BarsyEckman @JordyMVB I've enjoyed representing more Democrats than before b/c it gives me new opportunities to show there's an alternative to partisan nonsense.
@bmolde @JordyMVB Instead of including all of Kent, the district currently extends south to include Calhoun County. Kent is more Republican than Calhoun.
@jenelandino @JordyMVB Yes, among others. Those areas were removed from the district in 2012, making the district less Republican than before.
@bmolde @JordyMVB An example of a more natural redistricting would be to include all of Kent County in one district.
@jenelandino @JordyMVB I represent the entire city of Grand Rapids. Surrounding areas are substantially more Republican. Several were carved out of the district.
@JordyMVB Not from a statistical standpoint. Our district was gerrymandered to make it less Republican than it would be w/ more natural redistricting.

@ianmbarney Former @RepChrisGibson &amp; I previously introduced this bill to amend and clarify parts of the War Powers Resolution: https://t.co/GkdZ8NKJmA.
@ianmbarney I mostly support WPR. §2(c) is explicit; I think it cannot logically be interpreted any other way. Other provisions affirm this reading.
@ianmbarney I'm simply suggesting a possible argument from prez, not my position. I think there's only one sound interpretation: https://t.co/sMrVMIsiZ6
@Fingers66 @Gconservatarian Congress did not authorize the Korean War, so the president must still receive approval for offensive action.
@Gconservatarian Yes, according to the WPR.
@ianmbarney Prez could argue reasonably that, just as it doesn't permit him to take offensive action w/o approval, it cannot limit his defensive action.
@ianmbarney It's only interpretation that is self-consistent, consistent w/ Constitution, AND gives WPR meaning. WPR limits prez's defensive authority.
People falsely assert WPR unconditionally lets president act w/o approval for 60-90 days. No, only for *defensive* action per §2(c), item 3. https://t.co/yJDACpwOzF
@ianmbarney Consistent with the Constitution, §2(c) limits application of the 60-day provision to item 3, which relates to defensive action.
@tsheahan13 That would be a *defensive* military action in accordance with item 3.
@Smittyg473Smith Yes.

@MaximusBenjamus @buttersmckinney Nope. https://t.co/dg7hiphb2P
@randalladams @MattWalshBlog I am letting them do what they do best. Sec. Mattis asked us to OPPOSE the amendment, which I did. He wants time to work out a new policy.
@Mellecon @USInGodWeTrust @SouthernKeeks An intersex person can have transgender issues.
@Mellecon @USInGodWeTrust @SouthernKeeks It is clearly not true that "all" such surgery would be elective. Some people are born intersex, for example.
@AZTXwoman @freedomcaucus I'm a founder of the @freedomcaucus. You write "MAGA," yet it's the Trump administration that asked Congress to vote the way I voted here.
@Mellecon @USInGodWeTrust @SouthernKeeks Current policy does not cover elective transgender surgery. Sec. Mattis says he opposes amdt, and it makes sense to give him a few months.
@USInGodWeTrust @SouthernKeeks Thanks. Have you considered that I'm doing my job properly 100% of the time, while most of my colleagues do it properly only when it's easy?
@MattWalshBlog Those are medical determinations. What I'm saying is that current policy explicitly says any treatment must be "medically necessary."
@Love2RescueDogs @vjzink No. Voting for this amendment is politically expedient. Voting for Kate's Law is politically expedient. The right thing is voting against.
@Rosbrownie I think you're misunderstanding. The policy still does not cover transgender elective surgery.
@Rosbrownie Maybe you should seek the facts. Current policy does not permit elective surgery.
@LisaMaret I agree. That's one reason I voted against the NDAA, while most Republicans and Democrats voted for it.
@LisaMaret It's not.
@Martin_Niemolle @johnhawkinsrwn Sec. Mattis is much closer to the situation and should propose a policy he thinks works. If we still have concerns, then we can intervene.
@evan2048 @jcbelgium @LisaMaret I didn't vote FOR anything. I voted no on an amendment that the administration feels is unwarranted while they craft their own policy.
@AlanStump1 @Love2RescueDogs Your rhetoric doesn't change the fact that the Trump administration opposes the amendment and reasonably requested a few months to address.
@AlanStump1 @Love2RescueDogs Great rebuttal. 🙌🏻
@johnhawkinsrwn Sec. Mattis &amp; WH oppose the amdt. They're working on policy &amp; want an opportunity to craft it. Reasonable to give few months they requested.
@LisaMaret Thanks for the past support. As a principled person, I don't vote based on emotions, like most of my colleagues, but rather based on facts.
@vjzink @Love2RescueDogs It nearly didn't get a vote bc of pushback from administration. Why only 24? Bc Congress does what's politically expedient, not what's best.
@DaPerzer @Koppers2550 We passed a separate bill to treat Congress and staff like everyone else.
@vjzink @Love2RescueDogs Hardly. The administration's modest request is reasonable.
@DaPerzer @Koppers2550 Changing our insurance brings the bill under the jurisdiction of additional committees, which violates reconciliation parliamentary rules.
@DaPerzer @Koppers2550 We're the only federal employees who are prohibited from getting insurance from our employer. We purchase from the D.C. ACA exchange.
@James_Silberman Still a fake news headline. People voted no for many possible reasons. I'll wait for Sec. Mattis to assess feasibility &amp; present his policy.
@Koppers2550 The House bill did not include Congress and staff bc a reconciliation bill cannot cover our situation. That's why we passed a separate bill.
@Love2RescueDogs Sec. Mattis and the White House oppose the amendment. It's the Trump administration that asked us to vote no while they develop a policy.
@James_Silberman Fake news headline. Sec. Mattis and the White House oppose the amendment. They are working on a policy and want an opportunity to craft it.
@GQinNC @TomBalek @INTinaT Our new administration asked for time to develop a policy. I believe Sec. Mattis should have that chance.

@Conservative4MI @Sam_Koenig3 False. Not sure what you think you heard. If I said I don't like amending Const'n thru convention, that's not same as being "against" Art V.
@Conservative4MI @Sam_Koenig3 No, you didn't. No, I haven't. It has the potential to be abused, just like the Commerce Clause, but I'm not "against" either one.

@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven President faces political consequences if his actions are not justified. As I've noted, neither view will constrain a tyrant. Take care.
@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven Pres executes laws. Constitution is supreme law. He swears oath to uphold it. When it conflicts w/ other laws, he must follow Constitution.
@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven Situation you describe is possible under either view. Tyrants don't care about laws. But your view requires a good pres to violate Const'n.
@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven In both views, there would be court challenge. But my view is more consistent w/ constitutional structure, sep'n of powers, and basic logic.

@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven Under your view, if Congress passed Japanese internment law, then president would have to execute unless and until SCOTUS holds otherwise.
@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven It's how our system works. LB makes laws. EB executes laws. JB resolves cases under law. Each branch interprets Const'n w/r/t its functions.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven The fact that each branch has an independent duty to interpret the Constitution is discussed in the first week of constitutional law class.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven This again supports fact that each branch must independently interpret and uphold Constitution. We each take an oath to follow Constitution.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven This is SCOTUS discussing the fact that it, like other branches, needs to interpret Constitution to carry out a function (resolving a case).
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven Oh, you've returned to that ridiculous line of argument. We've covered it: https://t.co/WvhJm8kibI. You are flailing.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven You are now quoting random portions of the opinion that have nothing to do with your proposition.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven SCOTUS is saying that it, too, must interpret Constitution to carry out its functions. Read the opinion. It is not claiming exclusive power.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven It's also an "included process" of legislative power and executive power. I suggest you read Marbury v. Madison again or for the first time.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven Where does it say "interpretive"?
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven You can't point to such a clause for the judicial branch, because, as I've said, there are no such clauses.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven Yes, as I've said, and so does legislative power and executive power.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven Probably bc you've dug too deep a hole, you refuse to accept Constitution is the law &amp; each branch must interpret it to carry out functions.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven You must be kidding. You're the one treating it as a "living" doc. You think judicial power is a special delegation of interpretive power.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven I don't know what you think this shows. Each branch has functions. Each branch must interpret Constitution in carrying out its functions.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven There are no such clauses for any of the branches.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven Derives from each branch's need to carry out its functions under the Constitution. Constitution confers no special authority on any branch.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven Exactly, which again goes to why our system of government requires that each branch independently interpret and uphold the Constitution.
@ImBlest247 1. I'm not a senator.	2. I endorsed Justice Gorsuch: https://t.co/lcaTCahfQz.	3. I always follow the Constitution: https://t.co/sOBnhhYdyG.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Executive branch must determine constitutionality in course of carrying out its functions.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven SCOTUS is not final arbiter, either, except with respect to its functions. It interprets Constitution/laws in the course of resolving cases.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven https://t.co/sOBnhhYdyG
@SumaSteven I'm not a state legislator.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven You do not understand judicial review if you think it's the principle that the judiciary is the sole arbiter of constitutionality.
@Tuffelhund2003 @Steven_Swenson @daninmich @SumaSteven Marbury v. Madison says no such thing. In fact, the point is opposite—that each branch has an independent duty to uphold the Constitution.
@SumaSteven @Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Any law that violates the Constitution is void and not to be enforced. This is America 101.
@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven A law does not have to be enforced—and, in fact, should not be enforced—if the executive branch believes it is unconstitutional.
@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven It's a fundamental principle of our system that a law that violates Constitution IS void; not made void by SCOTUS. See Marbury v. Madison.
@Steven_Swenson @Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven No, that's absolutely false. And believing such a myth is perhaps the biggest threat today to our Constitution and the Rule of Law.
@Tuffelhund2003 @daninmich @SumaSteven No, that's not how laws work. That's like saying a 55 mph speed limit isn't 55 mph until someone challenges it in court and loses.

@MEPFuller In any case, my original point (see first reply) was that Democrats would have liked our approach better than GOP leadership's.
@MEPFuller We reached out to them during negotiations, but GOP leaders insisted on rushing and not moving away from their general framework.
@MEPFuller We discussed a variety of options, but we wanted to work with Tuesday Group (and even Ds) on this. That's why I said start over.
@gordonsjones1 Leadership associates (often anonymously) source those bogus reports. @MEPFuller
@MEPFuller If you change just EHB and not other insurance mandates, coverage collapses for sickest. Plus, we wanted a more robust backstop.
@MEPFuller That's why we objected to (and never requested) that change in isolation. That change made us dislike the bill even more.

@Taniel Not true. This has always been HFC's (and Mark's) position. We do not support EHB repeal without other changes.
@dnewhauser This has always been HFC's position. We do not support EHB repeal without other changes.
@mikedebonis I've perhaps been most adamant in HFC about starting over. Too many moving parts to amend. We can do much better for everyone.
@mikedebonis So there's no confusion, Mark shares this view against repealing only EHB.
@mikedebonis Mark shares this view.
@MelissaTweets I support full repeal. I'm pointing out that they can make the system worse by repealing only certain parts.
@MelissaTweets The bill maintains numerous mandates. We have to consider how they interact. That's why we should start over.
Yeah, almost every day in Congress. https://t.co/PvlaraCmLw

@JoannKline No, I mean reducing the overall cost of health care so more people can afford it.
Wasn't us. https://t.co/nqHkzQfNRp
GOP health care plan is a political plan that functionally keeps Obamacare while claiming repeal/replace. Not focused on driving down costs.
@karathebird I do. When Republicans ignore House rules, I vote against them. When Democrats ignore House rules, I vote against them.
@JoeSalowitz Legislative bodies don't work that way. Neither he nor I can raise any matter whenever we want.
@JoeSalowitz I did not vote against it. I voted to concur with the parliamentary ruling that it was not privileged. https://t.co/5HphNggUmj
Sure. He tried to offer it as a privileged motion, but House rules do not allow it to be offered in this manner. https://t.co/rvPBugaDYN

@Benioff Thank you.
I already had watched. The context was in the @politico article, too. How does this excuse any member of Congress from holding town halls? https://t.co/IH0MU1e9h1
Town halls are an opportunity to discuss the Constitution, Rule of Law, federalism, capitalism. Bring people to these ideas through respect.
1. Most of the people attending are concerned constituents. 2. If you can't handle these engagements, then this isn't the right job for you. https://t.co/1ekDfpHJ6H

Each branch must do so. Judicial branch interprets Constitution and laws in course of deciding particular cases between specific parties. https://t.co/2u4Hrdw2TZ

RT @DonnaCassataAP: Unlike colleagues, Michigan congressman embraces town halls (from @AP) https://t.co/gU6deoIJ5K
@rlh That would be a good counter if only the Framers hadn't included some way for Congress to override the president's veto.
@cabbageguy It's under your view that executive would act arbitrarily—unbound by Constitution except in rare cases where SCOTUS has opined.
@cabbageguy "Rule of Law" means that the application and execution of laws should not be arbitrary.
@cabbageguy No, I consistently uphold both. Courts don't opine on most laws. "Anything goes until SCOTUS opines" would threaten Rule of Law.
@cabbageguy Each branch is responsible for upholding Constitution. If an actual case between specific parties arises, then court resolves.
@cabbageguy Courts simply interpret Constitution and laws in course of deciding particular cases between specific parties.
@cabbageguy No, you are not correct. We swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution. This is precisely how the Framers designed it.
@cabbageguy Sorry for any misunderstanding. An unconstitutional law is unconstitutional the moment it is enacted. No court opinion required.
@cantmakeitup77 Thank you.
@cabbageguy Each branch has an independent duty to interpret and uphold the Constitution.

@lissaCT States may have different laws under our Constitution, but they may not violate or ignore constitutional requirements. @jennvzande
@pmedfordconley1 @TheJusticeDept can (and already does) enforce 14th Amdt issues. Any specialists at @usedgov can be relocated. @jennvzande
@pmedfordconley1 Nobody said those laws are bad. I've said the @usedgov harms kids by reducing total resources for students.
@pmedfordconley1 The 14th Amendment authorizes Congress to pass appropriate legislation; that's why the Civil Rights Act was rightly passed.
@pmedfordconley1 I sympathize with your difficulties. You should not make assumptions about the struggles other people face or do not face.
@pmedfordconley1 Eliminating a federal department does not take away constitutional protections. The Constitution doesn't work that way.
@pmedfordconley1 Correct. I swore an oath to uphold the entire Constitution.
@jennvzande Legislation can designate an appropriate federal agency to enforce. @pmedfordconley1
@jennvzande They can become state programs if desired. The federal government would continue to enforce constitutional safeguards.
@pmedfordconley1 Enforcement of the 14th Amendment doesn't require that department.
@pmedfordconley1 The 14th Amendment predates the @usedgov by more than 100 years. It will continue to secure the rights of children.
