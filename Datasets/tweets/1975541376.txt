@SrtaBe1 @Alyssa_Milano @GOP Socialism is a way of governance &amp; economics that puts the collective good over the rights of individuals in the name of equality.

@truthisfree4all @TalbertSwan @ThomasSowell Do you even see what you just did? Who is the "us" you're referring to? Black folks? Isn't the Bishop's intention to overcome "white supremacy" which is basically white folks having their own exclusive cult that thinks they're better than everyone else? Stop looking at color!
@KingFridayXIII1 @TalbertSwan @Ironicicle The question is why is the Bishop arguing with a "white man" with 5k Twitter followers? Probably because he finds the truth offensive and feels the need to fight it.
@KingFridayXIII1 @TalbertSwan @Ironicicle I'm arguing against his methods and racism. Can't fight hate with hate. Can't create a better world for someone by trying to destroy someone else. His methods are equally as awful as white supremacists. I give both bigoted sides equal treatment.
@TalbertSwan @Ironicicle See do you bother to know who you're talking about? I tell the Trump supporters the same thing I'm telling you. YOU CANNOT FIGHT HATE WITH HATE, RACISM WITH RACISM, BIGOTRY WITH BIGOTRY. Call out Trump all you want for his rhetoric and politics, but show him YOU ARE BETTER.
@TalbertSwan @Ironicicle Again, another tweet that shows all you care about is color. You aren't promoting peace, equality, understanding, beauty... you're just peddling your own racism and feeding the world with hate. Try a different approach and you'll succeed, especially for people of color.

@VirusEmpathy Rex Lawhorn was &amp; he was the Oklahoma Johnson/Weld state campaign manager, he says Weld never endorsed Hillary. Plus, I was also a Johnson activist in 2016 even as a Republican and donated time and money voluntarily. Weld is a moderate but he's a good man of integrity.

@VirusEmpathy It's just not true - that he endorsed Hillary. It was a stupid thing to say out loud - that he vouched Hillary's familiarity would be better than Trump's unpredictability. I was a Republican in 2016 who thought the same thing at times and voted Johnson/Weld. I'm now Libertarian.
@marklevinshow Mark, you're just as much of an idiot now days! I can't believe you are bogusly excusing this national emergency measure by the Executive Branch to "secure the border with a wall." It's not Constitutional. It's incredibly dangerous precedent. And you've become a fraud.
@VirusEmpathy It's just not true. I'm friends with the Oklahoma Johnson campaign manager and he's repeatedly called out the fake news about this. People DID misunderstand Weld &amp; it had some effect. It was a stupid thing to say out loud, that Hillary &gt; Trump in 2016, but it's forgivable.

@SteveKornacki @MattWelch It's about debating Trump. The debates consistently discriminate against Libertarians but in the GOP he will likely get enough of a percentage to bring some fiscal responsibility and good ideas, like abolishing the Department of Education, and push Trump that direction.

Bill Weld (#Weld2020) said he will abolish the Department of Education, end foreign interventionism, and cut federal spending. If he wins the #GOP primary I could support that kind of platform. If he doesn't win (most probable) maybe he can get #Trump to commit to those policies!

Yes, abortion takes a life but it's complicated because of the biological mother/preborn relationship. We should care for mom AND baby.
@MBuzlea @lpartainnews @KTULNews Women have autonomy over their own bodies. Prevent pregnancy if you want but you have no right to conceive and intentionally end the preborn's life.
@MBuzlea @lpartainnews @KTULNews Abortion is not the procedure for removing an embryo. It's for dismembering a living individual. It's not about religion and morality. It's about human rights and the preborn is a human.

@mrscoxscience @GovStitt Education is a parental responsibility with assistance from family &amp; community if chosen. Public education is not an inherent right at all.

@mrscoxscience @GovStitt It's a violation of the U.S. Constitution that strictly lays out the functions of government in our Republic and education is not one of them. The Oklahoma Constitution is full of blunders that undermine Oklahomans. But I would compromise, abolish federal involvement &amp; keep OK's.
@GovStitt Digitalizing and creating efficiency in bureaucracy and tracking tax dollars with more transparency sounds responsible, but it‚Äôs simply code for strengthening and empowering the bureaucracy, not the taxpayers. You are progressive red, not a conservative or libertarian.
@GovStitt You were not hired to babysit us. Your job is to protect us from aggression, whether from the state government, Law Enforcement, the federal government, or our individual neighbor. You should be protecting our life, liberty and property, not managing us.
@GovStitt ‚ÄúWho will build roads?‚Äù We will, we the people and the free market. Stop worrying about cutting services and start doing it so that in 25 years the Oklahoma government is smaller than it is today.
@GovStitt We should be focused on minimizing the state budget. Transparency would be spectacular, but also meaningless if you aren‚Äôt focused on cutting waste, shrinking state power and management, and removing state roadblocks to the market and the taxpayers.
@GovStitt #Healthcare should be private and deregulated. Allow free market competition and charity to bring down costs. It is government‚Äôs interventionism that has caused costs to skyrocket. The state should be focused on empowering the people, not empowering the state.
@GovStitt THANK YOU! We need to address the invasion of privacy and the unfounded aggression of Law Enforcement. We need to focus on restorative justice, not punitive. We need to stop incarcerations for non-violent crimes. We need to end the War on Drugs and equip rehabilitation efforts.

@GovStitt That‚Äôs a shame, because public education is unconstitutional and undermines our students. We need to privatize and localize education... period. ‚ÄúInvestment‚Äù equals higher taxes, bureaucratic vocabulary for more state control over teachers, students, and parental rights.

@GovStitt See, that‚Äôs a problem in ideology. We the Oklahoma taxpayers are not your customers. We are your employers. You should be working for us to protect our liberty and individual rights.

@KristatheYoung1 @BuddyMoore23 @MicahM32 @Liz_Wheeler I don‚Äôt know how people continually ignore the fact that person 2 only exists because of the decisions of person 1. Do you believe if you give birth because you don‚Äôt get an abortion that you have the right to destroy person 2? He or she is still extraordinarily dependent on you.
@KristatheYoung1 @BuddyMoore23 @Liz_Wheeler Um, making resources available for 500 women a year that got pregnant against their will would be easier to agree on than excusing the laziness or ignorance of the 5,000,000 a year that got pregnant "accidentally" and now demand the authority to terminate. Use protection.
@KristatheYoung1 @BuddyMoore23 @Liz_Wheeler Sincere question, what is the problem with not getting pregnant? Why is that not the focus? It seems to me that women's rights and medical advancement should be focused on #@!preventing#@! pregnancy for women who don't want a baby rather than who is more important, baby or woman.
@KristatheYoung1 @BuddyMoore23 @Liz_Wheeler Kidnapping is not the perfect example but my point was that if I don't want someone to tell me what to do in my own home (or your body) I need to make decisions that don't put others in a position where they need to protect someone from me.
@KristatheYoung1 @BuddyMoore23 @Liz_Wheeler Choices. Pro choice argument always talks about Women's Rights and keeping the government out of their wombs but in most cases it is the woman's choices that led to the life forming inside her. The liberty is in not getting pregnant. There is no liberty to terminate it.
"The individual is the only minority." #Libertarian #YourLifeMatters #Liberty #Constitution #OK2 #FreedomToLive https://t.co/mfjbaVEjDV
@KristatheYoung1 @BuddyMoore23 @Liz_Wheeler The state has no role in my home either, unless my decisions put someone there against their will (aka kidnapping) or I'm planning a school shooting etc. The state has no role in your body, unless you conceive a life and then decide you are going to terminate it.
@KristatheYoung1 @BuddyMoore23 @Liz_Wheeler Hm. You got pregnant. You basically put the fetus in you. So does he or her have a right to stay? Probably not, but they do have a right at the opportunity for life one way or another. Did you just solve the whole messy abortion debate? We need medical science to step up now.
@KristatheYoung1 @BuddyMoore23 @Liz_Wheeler Yes. Put him or her in an incubator and honor their right to the opportunity for life &amp; dignity like my wife does for premature babies that are born or saved daily in NICUs across the country.

@KristatheYoung1 @BenjaminThiccc @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life I think almost all of us would fully support no government intervention IF culturally and medically people were accountable for the preborn life. It‚Äôs like arguing for Adam Kokesh to be (non)President when we have a long ways to go before voluntaryism or anarchy can actually win.
@KristatheYoung1 @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life Society has no right to tell a mom how to raise her kids, what her diet must be while pregnant, or whether to give birth at a hospital. We do have a responsibility to ensure the child‚Äôs (preborn‚Äôs) immediate safety. A mom has autonomy in many ways, but not to endanger a life.
@KristatheYoung1 @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life When your decisions lead to pregnancy society has every right and responsibility to hold you accountable for that human life. You lose some autonomy.
@KristatheYoung1 @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life I didn‚Äôt say a woman loses complete autonomy or permanently, only in relation to pregnancy. If a mom gives her 2 year old cocaine and the government finds out, you have surrendered your autonomy because you endangered an innocent child.
@KristatheYoung1 @BenjaminThiccc @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life The government often holds us responsible for our choices. Steal a car and you will go to prison.

@KristatheYoung1 @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life I think the woman has forfeited her autonomy when she gets pregnant. I understand the strong argument against gov interventionism but in my opinion the mom already submitted herself to the pregnancy so gov is not committing aggression when it steps in to prevent termination.
@KristatheYoung1 @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life The child has rights in my belief and I think science is pretty strong behind it. Once the woman gets pregnant (her liberty led her there, hopefully), she has willfully &amp; temporarily surrendered her body to another life.
@KFIYL1 @KristatheYoung1 @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life Is it? I mean, my argument is that the woman made all the decisions of her own liberty that lead to conception (in most cases), whether intentionally getting pregnant or "accidentally," she had to have sex &amp; didn't take proper measures to prevent conception.

@KristatheYoung1 @AP4Liberty @justinamash @amashoffice @March_for_Life The problem with your argument friend is that the woman made her decisions. In today's medical world there are plenty of ways to make sure you don't conceive another individual with/in your body. Once the new life begins to form we should protect it.

@Viscous_cree @tictoc Obsession would require more than one retweet of said obsession. And TP USA? You truly are extremely lazy or a compulsive liar. Here's some advice. Think before you tweet and don't do drugs.
@Viscous_cree @sociallylowiq @tictoc 4. It doesn't take a genius man. They are indifferent to the Constitution and a couple of them even seem to hate it and wish to intentionally make it irrelevant. Again, listen to them for yourself. Of course I'm betting you've never studied the Constitution yourself.
@Viscous_cree @sociallylowiq @tictoc 3. Did you read the article? Idiot. The media is continually worshipping these Congresswomen for their diversity and ethnicity. We should celebrate diversity but we should have integrity about it. These women are not the first of their ethnicities to be elected Representatives.
@Viscous_cree @sociallylowiq @tictoc 2. They are not intelligent as has been seen on many interviews even on media coverage that is supportive. The proposals they have made or supported in Congress shows a severe lack of economic or foreign policy knowledge.
@Viscous_cree @sociallylowiq @tictoc 1. TicToc has been lifting these few ladies up as the future of politics since they won in November. It's an obsession, they're desperate for new progressive blood but these women don't meet the criteria to be good leadership.
@Viscous_cree @sociallylowiq @tictoc Your retweet is a sad example of why friends should be telling you to lay off social media, especially if they care about your future. If you want a debate you have to provide rational arguments, not shallow trolling. But I guess if your tweets boost your ego it's understandable.

The Law said do not covet your neighbor's wife, don't commit adultery. The Spirit says let's not even think lustfully. Because of Jesus it's about our hearts versus outward behavior modification. Matt. 5

@brpetertotleben @AndyStanley @faithwirenews @MattWalshBlog "Through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death." Romans 8:1 We aren't going to go around like a bunch of modern anarchists without the Law. If we know God we follow the law of the Spirit that the old Law pointed to.
@brpetertotleben @AndyStanley @faithwirenews @MattWalshBlog Nope that's a gross misinterpretation sir. Paul still believed we have a moral code, as Jesus said in Matthew 5. But he did not ever declare that the Law of Moses was the code for moral behavior. In Galatians he said it's about walking after the Spirit, not the Law, not "rules."
@brpetertotleben @AndyStanley @faithwirenews @MattWalshBlog ‚ÄúThe days are coming,‚Äù declares the Lord, ‚Äúwhen I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel: I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts." Jeremiah 31:31-34
@brpetertotleben @AndyStanley @faithwirenews @MattWalshBlog Jesus himself, though the Messiah, followed and taught the Law at times but He also wasn't slave to it. He often broke the law and traditions of Moses, in fact it's a big reason why they killed him! It seems many in religious circles still have the tendencies of the Pharisees.
@brpetertotleben @AndyStanley @faithwirenews @MattWalshBlog We now live by the Spirit, not the Law. As Paul said in Romans, the Law itself is not bad or wrong but we are free from it because we are new creations in Christ and it is our new nature in Him (through the Spirit) that bears good fruit, not through the Law.

@brpetertotleben @AndyStanley @faithwirenews @MattWalshBlog "for our sins. He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit."
@brpetertotleben @AndyStanley @faithwirenews @MattWalshBlog "The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature. So God did what the law could.

@brpetertotleben @AndyStanley @faithwirenews @MattWalshBlog "But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit." Romans 7:6

@tevincampbelll I apologize that it sounded like such an insult. However, partisan farce means taking an extreme position based on political ideology that demonstrates comedy rather than serious thoughts. I said use your brain because your original tweet uses political tribalism, not facts.
@tevincampbelll Partisan farce isn't an attack. It's your tweet. You are taking a radical side instead of trying to bring rational understanding to the conversation. The stupid wall is the number one reason Trump was elected. Whether you and I agree with him or not, millions do.

@realTJRoberts @LibertyHangout I understand your argument now though it's not what is originally represented in the quote. But calling for divisions based on political ideology is extraordinarily fascist itself. So I hope you don't call for the divisions &amp; that you're only saying "voluntary" is expected.

@realTJRoberts @LibertyHangout Of course it's wrong! Wow. If in the quote he means there's no room for communism and progressivism in a libertarian society, fine. But the quote, and Liberty Hangout's recent history, reveal a lack of respect for the Constitution, individual liberty, free speech.

@pas_cr @71RepublicMedia @LPNational As someone who reluctantly but still at times thought to myself ‚Äúif one of them must win it should be Hillary bc Trump is unpredictable &amp; too independent,‚Äù I understand Weld. I was wrong. It turns out Trump is the more sane of the two. Weld had similar thoughts. I forgive him.
@pas_cr @71RepublicMedia @LPNational Yes he is. Is he a purist or as Libertarian as I wish? No. But he is Libertarian, genuinely.

@71RepublicMedia @LPNational No way in the universe should we nominate John McAffee. Amash won‚Äôt run until closer to 2028. Weld is the most reasonable choice for 2020 unless we nominate from our pool of former 2018 candidates like Kash Jackson, Lucy Brenton, or Matt Waters.

Do you believe laws should be based on the Biblical perspective (or at least universally accepted standards) of morality or the non-aggression principle?
Which do you more closely relate in your spiritual beliefs?
Do you believe in the doctrine of The Rapture, in Christianity? The belief that Jesus is returning soon to take Believers out of this world and usher them to Heaven without death...
Do you believe a woman has an inherent right to terminate her pregnancy if there is a viable fetus? (Debate is welcome.)

@PastorJohnHagee This is some of the worst preaching I‚Äôve heard on Twitter. Your ‚Äúcourage‚Äù Pastor John is misguided. I wish you would put your courage toward the Good News, Jesus.

Stop making excuses friends! @YALiberty @FreedomWorks @RLibertyCaucus @LPMisesCaucus @AFPhq and others need to work together whenever possible: 1. To advance the principles of liberty. 2. To diminish the impact of political tribalism. #ForThePeople
The @GOP needs to be called out for fueling the tribalism, not just for their big-government hypocrisy. One can say they don‚Äôt care about party, only liberty, but when the GOP sabotages its own liberty candidates AND advances political supremacy against the LP, it matters.
But we need everyone on #TeamLiberty to help fight the political tribalism that is becoming the biggest obstacle to liberty, soon to surpass the statism of the establishment. To succeed in 2020 and advance the movement, regardless of party, we need to win hearts and minds.
I was a liberty #StandWithRand Republican until 2017 when I switched to the @LPNational. I still love Rand &amp; I cheer for liberty candidates regardless of party. Look over my Twitter feed from 2018! I don‚Äôt want YAL or anyone else to exclusively support the LP or the GOP.
