For those who are blessed who have seen, but even more so to those who have not. - not a biblical quote but paraphrased
Know that the ancient israelites did not worship God but many gods. Just as we should not worship the many narratives of mainstream media, but our own guidance from God Himself. Do you not believe in God? I implore you to. If you don't and come to that conclusion, God bless you.
@IlhanMN From experience of my forefathers, you DO NOT want to stir this sleeping giant of Patriots. From my own experience we are #Relentless and #Unforgiving in our cause, and will cease at nothing to resist your Sharia Law. We defeated your Barbaries and will defeat you again.

@Netwebangel @Woodroy609 @PCHEREFOXBORO @KashJackson2018 @realDonaldTrump But the power company is willing to shell out $8.3M rather than trying to maintain their own power lines (which then killed two people and destroyed 500+ homes).

@AnthonyParsons @KashJackson2018 @realDonaldTrump Ie. Wood superstructure, reinforced concrete (for newer bridges otherwise just concrete) masonry for durability against traffic and weather. Once you have a gap in the masonry the bridge is effectively a wood bridge with a ton of unnecessary weight, adding to it's demise
@AnthonyParsons @KashJackson2018 @realDonaldTrump That can be attributed to the new materials used in building construction (look up building code). As for bridges, our infrastructure is in such disrepair that once fire gets into the trellising of the bridges it's done 1/2

In the wake of the Thousand Oaks massacre the topic of mental health is being brought to the forefront. That said, how do we define mental illness? Do we arbitrarily dictate certain conditions based on how we feel that day? Do we go with DSM? This topic on the issue needs attn.
@TarasaJune_MAGA @pattipromqueen @DemocratsCare @DLoesch @sdun44 Can you provide a source?
@dusm1811 @DemocratsCare @DLoesch @sdun44 Well, if it has no LCI that alone renders the pistol as off-roster. Can't wait to move to a free state
@dusm1811 @DemocratsCare @DLoesch @sdun44 No LCI? It's CA mandated, otherwise the roster puts it as an AW. And as you state mag cap is 10, so anything higher renders that pistol as an AW as well.		Asinine, just like a pistol grip on a semi auto center fire featureless rifle makes it an AW. But one on a shotgun doesn't...
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Tough in a lame duck that has been galvanized by the election. I admire your effort to do something, and I respect your bipartisanship, but I have low expectations of any cooperation in this lame duck. Thank you for being a quality statesman and for your service to our country!
@Minormatter12 @WeAretheMedia2 @darkstarseeker2 @SenFeinstein Oh good a sexist remark. Take your partisan vitriol elsewhere, it's people like you driving the wedge of hate
@cvpayne Probably something like how the MSM is reporting now, blaming the intern.
@DemocratsCare @DLoesch @sdun44 Nah, PTSD and a hyperpartisan electorate with vitriolic rhetoric, are *probably* what pushed him. The sole responsibility of which lies with the shooter. CA gun laws (some of the strictest in the nation) didn't stop him from obtaining an illegal configuration for his pistol.
@DLoesch But wait there's more! The configuration the shooter had (no chamber indicator and an extended mag) would have classified it as an AW. And we all know AWs grow on trees in CA. #CriminalsDontFollowLaws.
@AndrewPollackFL Funny thing is, the gun was off-roster and it's configuration makes it an AW. So laws in obtaining the weapon would have done as much as the action Congress has taken, 0. It was country night with several conservative groups/schools there, so I'm sure a lot of them had to disarm
@SenFeinstein Easy access to an off-roster gun for a non LEO? Remember Senator, only the privileged elite in CA can easily obtain those off-roster. No, the legislation that CA has passed makes the task all but impossible. You're smarter than partisan rhetoric
@SenToomey So what do you do when the shooter is using an off-roster gun as a non LEO?

@SenatorIsakson Thoughts and prayers, absolutely. But in this hyperpartisan, hyperinformatic era you need to present some solution to address the issue even if you have to quietly rescind your solution, lest you be booted by your constituents.
@charliekirk11 Run for CA rep/Senate please. You have presented more on the issue than the do nothing Senators of my state
@Fuego___ @RobertC87550922 @KamalaHarris Constitutional. But you digress from gun violence.
@BsAuntie @KamalaHarris So? Were they standing shoulder to shoulder at the night club? I don't understand what you mean by source grapes so Ill bypass that comment. What did Harris do a week ago? A month ago? Last quarter? Tweet? That's cute.
@Stonevoodo @Jonathan_T24 @KamalaHarris JT, you're right on your analysis. So what has she presented besides "Leaders in Congress must act" in other words passing the buck to her Seniors? NOTHING. She tried to piggy back DFs AW ban but drove that coalition apart. Worse than doing nothing, self-defeating with her bile.
@Fuego___ @RobertC87550922 @KamalaHarris If I were elected to the Senate you bet I'd at least offer the wrong solution or better. "Leaders in Congress (the body she was elected to) must act." She is absolving herself of any responsibility to act by putting it on "the leaders".
@CovfefeAnalyst @KashJackson2018 Already doing more than my CA Sentors/Reps. Run in CA and ill vote for you. #SolutionsNotSilence
@KashJackson2018 SOP for mass shootings amirite? Thoughts and prayers, absolutely. But we're in an era of instant solutions or ridicule. So will you present a solution or be chastised?
@SenWarren Present a solution or gtfo of my Congress
@RepJerryNadler At least you offer some vague solutions to this issue, but why did you do it when you had the majority?
@RobertC87550922 @KamalaHarris We? Are you part of the all talk do nothing Congress too? No, this isn't his fault. This is a symptom of the complacent Congress that CHOOSES to do nothing but kick and scream at each other. Both Rs and Ds are nothing but authoritarian shills with faux outrage, and nothing to do.
@RickMcHale3 @dbongino On class, I won't dispute. He talks trash, absolutely. But you deflect sir
@BsAuntie @KamalaHarris The basics is that she has been relying on her Senior Senator to introduce Assault Weapons legislation, but even Fauxstein can't get that pushed through, despite having done so before. Learn about your Senators BSAuntie then reply with something substantial. Or stfu
@Jonathan_T24 @KamalaHarris Now that the Senate is R again, exactly nothing will happen esp. with a do nothing loud mouthed Junior Senator. She'll only drive division not build a *needed coalition

People on all sides talk about the evils of partisanship, yet they ascribe to it in their own arguments. If you want to denounce partisanship, I will back you. But that ends when you generalize your opponent and call them a ____. Attack the argument, not the politics/individual.

@MannSandiemann @TariffMYtaxCUT @cspanwj @sfchronicle I see ur point. I'm from the opposite aspect of government intervention, where government has less intrusion of the American life. I believe that more privatization/less nationalization will result in better US lives. More individual responsibility/less government dependability.
@1Anson1 @cspanwj @sfchronicle Thanks for those references, in turn I suggest you look up Henry George's system of Land Value Tax. If anything it may provide a more modern method of Land organization.
@1Anson1 @cspanwj @sfchronicle Have you heard of Land Value Tax? It's different from it's cousin Property Tax in that instead of the value of property being taxed, it's the value lost to exclusive (private) use that is taxed. Which ends up (in theory) valuating land in a conservationist way w/o govt interruptn
