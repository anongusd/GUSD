Cohen to Trump: checkmate!
@realDonaldTrump Trump, the tremendously fake negotiator. 		Kim played you last meeting.	This meeting you struck out.		What a fraud.
@realDonaldTrump Trump to Kim Jong Un:	Look Kim, I don't care what the hell you do behind the scenes in private. Go ahead, build the most tremendous bombs we've ever seen. I need a political win at home. Can you please pretend we came to an agreement and be more secretive with your nuke program?
@littlecaesars We wanted to try the pretzel crust pizza but we didn't want pepperoni. I asked if I could substitute pepperoni for extra cheese. She said no. I asked if I could get a different topping instead of pepperoni. She said no. She said I was unable to substitute. Ruined dinner plans.

@JarvisStream @TweetOfInsanity @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Proven lie? Who lied? When did the Mueller investigation end? I was unaware the investigation ended.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump He put's Russia first, America 2nd.
@realDonaldTrump Are you proud of your sexist comments? Talking about how you'd date your daughter and joke about incest. Calling certain women dogs, ugly, fat, horseface, miss piggy, talking about very young females, how you can just grope women, kiss anyone you want, cheating on wives, etc.
@TweetOfInsanity @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Even though Trump won in 2016 &amp; is in his 3rd year as President, Republicans just can't help themselves from mentioning Obama / Hillary whenever they can. Is it jealousy? Resentment? It's something. Dems don't bring up Reagan &amp; Bush constantly. This Obama fixation is ridiculous.
@JenniferDebnam @PattyMurray Dems originally offered 25B. Trump turned it down. Dems wanted DACA.	Now trump asks for 5.7 (which is just a starting point since the wall cost would be around 30B). Trump gets starting funding for the wall and what do the dems get?
@JenniferDebnam @PattyMurray How do you compromise with a president that says my way or the highway? Dems want to give billions for border security yet it's not good enough for Trump. This is Trump's shutdown. He said he'd own it &amp; not blame the Dems. Was willing to sign McConnells CR until Coulter got upset
@ewarren Dog lover. Another great quality!
@PattyMurray There was absolutely no need to shutdown the Gov. It was political, so Trump would look strong to his base which is why Coulter and Rush had a fit. And it takes attention off the Miuller investigation while trying to fool people into believing #democrats are weak on security
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump It will fool his supporters into believing it, which will further put a wedge in between the left &amp; right. In order for him to actually do it would require a legal battle he wouldn't win. At this point moving forward, it's all rhetoric. A distraction from Mueller's investigation
@krassenstein Aww. Poor #Trump baby. We won't get to see his blow up doll lips in action. wah wah	Damn, I was looking forward to hearing his lies, alternative facts, distortion, fear mongering, crises at the border rhetoric &amp; how TREMENDOUS a job he's doing Maybe he'll order hamberders instead
@oolaurie1 @joshuamccord @krassenstein @Deeetewww @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump All he's good at is being a bully, hiding behind twitter, talking tough as long as he doesn't have to confront anyone in person, bragging &amp; boasting (even about hamburgers), tearing down women, elderly, handicapped, FBI, CIA, DOJ, courts, laws, jurisprudence	Yet Putin is his bud
@joshuamccord @krassenstein @Deeetewww @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Weird? Seriously?	They have a voice, a big audience &amp; people like what they say.	Respond to tweets quickly &amp; get more exposure. Simple.	They're trying to build their audience.	You may not agree with them but it's hardly weird.	Social media can be a powerful tool if used correctly

@realDonaldTrump Low quality President bragging about feeding low quality food to a college football team. This President will brag and boast about anything just to inflate his ego. From talking about he'd date his daughter, to hamburgers.
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Trump embarrassed Mitch when Trump allowed Rush &amp; Coulter to overpower him &amp; forced Trump not sign off on the CR.	So Mitch won't try to pass anything shutdown related unless the Trump tells him in advance he'll sign it. If Mitch had balls, he'd publically shutdown Trump over this
@TSands_Conch @funder @realDonaldTrump We need to let Mueller finish. Then see what he's found ... that is, what's allowed to be made public. Transparency. The American public has the right to know.	If Trump hasn't done anything and it's a hoax, why doesn't he want to know what Mueller finds? America first. Right?
@amaturo273 @SenBlumenthal I'm sorry you feel that way Tony.	The investigation, when it started, wasn't about Trump. It was to see what, if any activity occurred by the Russians during the campaign. 	Trump's questionable behavior after that is what influenced the FBI to focus on him.
@mcraig49047 @Seaniii @realDonaldTrump President Chump would probably describe it as the most TREMENDOUS shutdown ever. Tremendous seems to be the biggest word he knows. He repeats it all the time. Such a tremendous fraud this hate monger is.
@Seaniii @realDonaldTrump Define best	He's the best at dividing the country, sympathizing with our adversaries, causing political chaoss, inspiring hate, playing to people's fears, degrading women, discrediting the FBI, CIA, Courts, DOJ, claiming news agencies as enemies, bullying the handicap..

@realDonaldTrump The waters are calm right now. However, in just a few days, the deep, blue waters will start getting very turbulent and quickly form into a beautiful, blue, majestic wave with tremendous force that will flood the white house.
@realDonaldTrump Do Trump supporters realize he gave up on the wall when he was going to sign the McConnell bill the Senate passed to not shut down the Gov? That's why Coulter &amp; Rush was pissed. Because he showed his supporters it was all talk. So Trump shuts down the Gov to "act" like he cares
@UderRa Border security? Yes. In the form of a wall that will cost around $25 billion in taxpayers money? No. Drugs &amp; weapons can be exchanged over the wall. Dept of Homeland Security reports 600,000 people in 2017 were here illegally due to overstayed visas. We need comprehensive reform
@realDonaldTrump Heads of countries view you as a joke. Many leaders are skeptical to even attempt to negotiate with you because they don't have confidence you'll even be around in the near future. And because of you're spoiled brat negotiating tactics.

@realDonaldTrump Trump promised the wall would be paid for by Mexico. NOT TAXPAYERS.	Democrats &amp; many Republicans want comprehensive immigration reform. NOT A WALL. A wall is easy for a candidate to promise when his team has no solution to improve immigration. Overstayed visas in 2017 = 600,000

@woodywilla @LouDobbs Sounds like something reps would do more so than dems especially with how reps have bad mouthed social security a lot in the last 10+ years.
@LouDobbs This isn't a battle about border security. It's a battle whether a border wall should be part of our border security.	Do Americans remember the total cost of a border wall is estimated at $20-25 Billion? I wonder if they've forgot that since all we hear about now is wanting $5B.
@EducatedMomWife @pollpolitics @pjkrollsr @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters were drunk off the Trump campaign rhetoric. They were extremely energized &amp; Trump knew which buttons to push.

@realDonaldTrump Jesus. NOBODY said border security isn't important. Just not in the form of a wall.
@realDonaldTrump He only needs a wall because he's trying to please Rush, Coulter, &amp; his base. Pundits want to see him fight &amp; "act" tough.

@Billm5578 @ElRonbo That's false	A wall won't fix illegal immigration	Comprehensive immigration reform would	Trump made people think a wall is the solution. It's not	He's also portrayed the Dems not caring about border security. That's also false. Majority of illegals here have overstayed visas
@orion1two @Drbootymd @ali Even Trump doesn't really give a shit. He just has to seem like he does	Trump was to sign the CR allowing $1.3B in border security &amp; no shutdown	Senate thought it was a done deal	Hard right started bashing Trump, &amp; at the last moment he backed out of the agreement	Now it's chaos
@Drbootymd @ali That's what Trump promised	Trump supporters didn't want to hear when Mexico said they weren't paying for anything &amp; they didn't want a wall	So Trump keeps changing who's going to pay for it, &amp; what it would look like	&amp; fooling people into thinking Dems don't want border security
@ali No.
@vvjhdrider208 @LouDobbs @FreemanWSJ @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse @POTUS Clear headed individuals
@LouDobbs @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He doesn't need to fight for border security. Everyone wants it. 	Dems don't want to blow billions on a pointless wall that won't solve anything.	Dems do want comprehensive immigration reform, strong border security, not a wall	Most illegals are here because they overstayed visas
@MadelineAncona @LouDobbs @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Not going to happen.	Said Mexico would pay for it. Mexico said no wall.	Dems said no wall funding.	Trump gave up &amp; was going to sign a CR for 1.3B in border security.	At the last moment, changes course after Coulter, Rush, etc bashed him for not looking tough in front of his base
@susanannemiller @LouDobbs @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Actually, he did give up. He was going to sign the bill which would allow 1.3 Billion funding for border security.	Then Coulter, Rush, etc, started bashing him.	Under pressure to make his base feel like there's hope and that he's a fighter, he changed. Now it's a mess.
@realDonaldTrump Bullying, making demands &amp; threats might be how you negotiated as a crooked, greedy businessman.	Those tactics won't work for you now.
@Heartbroken2958 Thankfully in California people like you are a tiny minority.
@MsTrouble26 @BonoVox1975 @realDonaldTrump Not listening to UN Weapons inspectors, IAEE, &amp; many other agencies / experts saying Saddam had disarmed, there were no WMDs, etc. Powell lies, and then Shock and Awe w/ 22,000 bombs. Years of occupation, thousands of casualties. 	FEAR FEAR FEAR, RUSH RUSH RUSH. Sound familiar?
@realDonaldTrump So how many other Presidents other than you and Obama had to deal with ISIS?
@katie_stickel @realDonaldTrump I find it amusingly sad the President has brainwashed people in Maryland, 2,000 miles away from the border that a wall is urgently needed. Yet, Americans living near the border find it completely pointless and not needed. Can we improve immigration? Yes. But a wall is idiotic.

@realDonaldTrump Trump is trying to get a win to add to his Presidential resume especially since people that voted for him are starting to realize he won't deliver on his #1 campaign promise of building a border wall.

@realDonaldTrump Trump materfully turned the Dems into scapegoats for everything that's bad.	If Republicans speak out, Trump attempts to destroy their reputation.	If the FBI, the courts, etc, don't do what Trump wants, they're automatically conspiring against him or working with the Dems	Wake up!
@_Proud_American @LouDobbs Mueller (Republican), was appointed by Rosenstein (Republican nominated by Trump) to serve as special counsel. Bush (W) originally nominated Mueller for FBI director.

@OscopeLabs @realDonaldTrump When he tweets, he's not talking to us. He's just reaching out to his base that believe his alternative facts. He can lie and distort all he wants publically. Thankfully, the courts only deal with the facts. And when Trump is in court, before a judge, Trump will be humiliated.
@Young0192 @realDonaldTrump It was never going to happen. Convincing a certain demographic there's an urgent need to keep out evil people by building a wall and that he's the only hope. Fear fear fear, we need a wall now, etc. Then you get FOX on board and his cult following absorb it all up.

@helpingeducate @AnnCoulter The Dems said they want it based on facts, not wild claims with nothing to back it up. The facts show a wall isn't needed. People living where the wall would be built don't even think it's needed. Yet Trump convinced people hundreds of miles away that a wall is urgently needed.
@AnnCoulter Because Trump thought he could turn it into a public spectacle and use quotes or clips of the meeting to make the Dems look bad. Negotiating in private shows there's more seriousness to come to an agreement without shutting the Government down.
