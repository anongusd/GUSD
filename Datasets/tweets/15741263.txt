The @weeklystandard is a funny magazine, too. There's our last-page parody (recent example here: https://t.co/Q0xR43j6X3) but also a general sideways glance at the people of politics and culture. Often described at the founding as a mix between Foreign Policy and Mad Magazine.
The @weeklystandard is a writer's magazine—not just a place for writers to flourish relatively freely, but a place where editors appreciate, foster, and partner with writers. A truly blessed and wonderful place to work.

An alarming piece about the real China threat: dominance in the high-tech space. Must-read. https://t.co/rHMRSAytDi
I thought this was an interesting comment for Nikki Haley to make. https://t.co/GHdjEdFh94 https://t.co/EBlFWjC2u5
For upcoming @weeklystandard cover story, I talk to Nikki Haley about her U.N. tenure, her plans for when she leaves at the end of the month, and the legacy of her predecessor, George H.W. Bush. https://t.co/GHdjEdFh94
People who know her and like her say Nikki Haley could be, should be, president one day. From next week's @weeklystandard, today! https://t.co/GHdjEdFh94 https://t.co/cpoCOItbsD

Nikki Haley is the rare Republican in the Trump era to be leaving office with an enhanced reputation and a star on the rise. So what's next for the 46-year-old soon-to-be-former U.N. ambassador? New in @weeklystandard. https://t.co/GHdjEdFh94
I wrote about Nikki Haley for the forthcoming issue of the @weeklystandard. The story is live now. https://t.co/FHuDR82LM2

It's a shame I can't seem to find it online, because the Parody from the @weeklystandard's March 1, 1999, issue—a two-page libretto for an opera of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair titled I Disonesti—is incredible.
A favorite feature for @weeklystandard readers is the Casual, a personal essay near the front of every issue. I have too many favorites, but this one from David Skinner (a master of the Casual form) in 2013 always sticks out. https://t.co/LPu7bJS8vr
The @weeklystandard thrives when its writers explore their own interests and its editors help them shape it. Here's an excellent, very recent example of that, in @HannahGraceLong's consideration of the Tolkien legacy. https://t.co/uH8fYvDx2B
You never know whose byline will show up in the @weeklystandard. Here's @ariannahuff's from 1995, encouraging @newtgingrich (!) to run for president. https://t.co/haG5ze14GQ
This 2009 piece from Robert Messenger on the cocktail renaissance is fun and educational, and also had the side effect of getting me hooked on the idea of one day writing for the @weeklystandard. https://t.co/nHiimlYeEh
We do investigative reporting at the @weeklystandard, including the coverage from @stephenfhayes and @thomasjoscelyn on how the Obama administration and parts of the intelligence community hid from the public until the very end. https://t.co/vGkO0Bu44t
You could argue that the @weeklystandard launched what is now a flourishing genre of tongue-somewhat-in-cheek (or is it?) reconsideration of important pieces of pop culture with @JVLast's original "The good guys are actually..." piece from 2002. https://t.co/4Gw4ngrUp4
Social commentary has been enriched by the @weeklystandard. In 1996, for instance, @nytdavidbrooks coined the term "status-income disequilibrium" in a hilarious essay in our pages. https://t.co/NtUwWu4YeV
The @weeklystandard covered, in its own way, the most consequential world event of the 21st century, in Matt Labash's 2001 report from a smoldering Ground Zero. https://t.co/nkVVDlTN3N
The @weeklystandard has also been a place for shoe-leather reporting. In 2010, during the frenzy of the campaign for the open Massachusetts Senate seat, an aide pushed @McCormackJohn to the ground when he tried to ask Democrat Martha Coakely a question. https://t.co/1AjyMXKza3
This 2015 report from Vienna by Chris Caldwell on Europe's migrant crisis was unlike anything else being written at the time. The @weeklystandard published it. https://t.co/esVlKB0Mr7
The @weeklystandard frequently publishes masterpieces of cultural commentary, such as this Andrew Ferguson piece from 2017 on E.B. White. https://t.co/VqGxTsyjxh
One of the many joys of working for @weeklystandard is that I get to publish pieces like this one, from June 2017, about the 50th anniversary of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. https://t.co/9N3bm6LPzI

Important to remember that on April 5, Trump was asked if he knew about the payment Cohen made to Stormy Daniels. "No. No," he said. https://t.co/1BJ3I5f4tN
In the filing, he is only identified as "Individual-1" but it's Trump.
In the new sentencing filing for Michael Cohen, the SDNY says Cohen admits he made payments to women to stay quiet before the 2016 election and that he "acted in coordination with and at the direction of" Donald Trump. https://t.co/V7a0go0Hzq

I am baffled that people read this piece and think it's favorable to Booker. Or maybe people who claim it is haven't actually read it. Or maybe they have and couldn't comprehend. https://t.co/vFuy0AGhev

It's clear @CoryBooker is putting in the work for a presidential campaign. @RubensteinAdam spends some time with the Democratic candidate of "environmental justice," "small acts of kindness, decency, and love," and, uh, "Spartacus." https://t.co/cAdke5lCny https://t.co/nhaUoev5Vs
A great new profile of @CoryBooker for the @weeklystandard by @RubensteinAdam. Read it! https://t.co/dlROVRyqP6

Could Nikki Haley soon be coming to a think tank near you? She tells me she will continue to "have a voice" on foreign policy after leaving her U.N. post December 31. https://t.co/gPkx84wI5c
Haley tells me she may write a book after leaving the U.N. job at the end of the month. "I would probably want to do another one just to kind of talk more about what I’ve seen, what I’ve lived, or what I’ve learned." https://t.co/gPkx84wI5c
@morninggloria Her kid's in school there!
Nikki Haley says she wants to write a book, maybe get involved in a think tank, and will stay in New York for the next two years. https://t.co/gPkx84wI5c
