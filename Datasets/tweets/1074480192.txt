The United States will pursue and try sanctions busters and, if the Canadian courts approve Meng‚Äôs extradition, she will experience something that her fellow Chinese citizens never get: a fair and open legal process.
China‚Äôs Communist Party has been exerting enormous pressure on our Canadian allies to release her, but the seriousness of the charges against her merit the scrutiny they are receiving.
I commend the Canadian government for initiating an extradition case for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. --&gt; https://t.co/aXCuhmjDfV
I will continue to work with President Trump and my colleagues to turn up the pressure on him and his regime until they agree to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.
We must also continue to be unflinching and unapologetic in identifying, condemning, and punishing Kim‚Äôs human rights atrocities, including the torture and murder of Otto Warmbier.
POTUS should accept nothing less and, if Kim agrees, the final terms should be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent.
@realDonaldTrump If Kim is interested in sanctions relief, he must fully disclose his nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, permit unrestricted access to relevant sites, and cooperate with verification organizations ensuring complete denuclearization.
.@realDonaldTrump did the right thing by walking away from the Hanoi summit. Kim Jong-un cannot be trusted. --&gt;¬†https://t.co/9hIWCFtcVJ

It is my hope that this bill will not only incentivize voluntary investment in our students, but will also energize a new era of opportunity in education and provide a brighter future for all Americans. --&gt; https://t.co/NIt212kOPH https://t.co/iqvDUH85Vg
My bill allows for scholarships to give elementary and secondary students a personalized education experience, as well as scholarships for career and technical education, apprenticeships, certifications, and other forms of workforce training for postsecondary students.
I introduced the Education Freedom Scholarships &amp; Opportunity Act which will drive increased investment in students by creating a tax credit for taxpayers that donate to scholarship organizations supporting K-12 education as well as secondary &amp; post-secondary workforce training. https://t.co/j9Nvd9V1Fo

I also look forward to working with him to insure against the retroactive reallocation of previously waived volumes of biofuels and to implement common sense RIN market reforms that will combat destructive market manipulation and speculation. --&gt; https://t.co/SvwppoYVsR
I look forward to working together to continue Small Refinery Exemptions, consistent with federal law and recent court decisions, and to reset the statutory conventional biofuel volume at a level that is aligned with market realities and does not exceed 15 billion gallons.
Over the course of the advice &amp; consent process, I appreciated his understanding of the plight of refinery workers facing crushing RINs prices under the Renewable Fuel Standard &amp; his ongoing dedication to finding a win-win solution that helps both corn farmers &amp; refinery workers.
This translates to billions of dollars in savings in regulatory costs for Americans across the country.
Pleased the Senate confirmed Andrew Wheeler to be the next EPA Administrator. He has displayed strong commitment to protecting the environment, while also providing businesses, local govs &amp; landowners greater certainty in EPA‚Äôs programs through the agency‚Äôs deregulatory actions.

I will continue fighting to secure our southern border.	 	Democrats‚Äô intransigence has left the president with no other choice but to take executive action. I‚Äôm a constitutionalist &amp; have long advocated that every president be bound by the Constitution and federal laws.
I have long called for building a wall as a necessary step in stopping the flow of illegal immigration into our country &amp; defending our border. Indeed, I introduced the #ELCHAPOAct &amp; the WALL Act‚Äì2 bills which would offset the cost of completing the wall and securing our border.
This bill does not deliver on the promises we made to the American people to keep our communities safe. Washington Democrats do not want to secure the border, but Texans and Americans do.
The American people gave Congress a clear mandate: #SecureTheBorder &amp; build the wall. These are critical priorities ‚Äì for Texas and the country.  	 	Unfortunately, this spending bill is a bad deal, and fails to reflect these priorities by not sufficiently securing the border.

If not‚Äìif Dems cont to embrace open borders @ the expense of the American people‚Äì today‚Äôs actions have made it all but inevitable that @POTUS will declare a national emergency &amp; deploy the funds &amp; manpower necessary to build a steel barrier @ high-traffic locations on the border.
We must keep our word to the American people.	 	Perhaps the Democrats will end their partisan obstruction, set aside their hatred of the president, and agree to a reasonable compromise to actually secure the border. I hope so.
We have a crisis at our border, one that Texas experiences first-hand. We need real border security, including physical barriers to stop drug traffickers and human traffickers. I will continue to lead the fight to secure the border and get the job done.
Given their behavior, there is considerable reason to be skeptical of their claim. We will see if they actually meant what they said. The media will obsess over the short-term political fight. But what matters is enacting real solutions to the real problems of this country.
.@SenSchumer and the Democrats cynically objected to that legislation and killed it on the Senate floor.	 	The Democrats have claimed that, once the shutdown ends, they are willing to negotiate in good faith to secure the border.
Yesterday, I fought hard to immediately pay every single essential federal employee ‚Äì every essential employee at the Coast Guard, the TSA, air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents, ICE agents, FBI agents, and those throughout law enforcement.
I am glad the Schumer shutdown is over. I am glad federal workers will finally be paid. For weeks, Democrats held their paychecks hostage.
I will continue to stand with the working men &amp; women of this country &amp; fight for common-sense solutions that respect the will of the American people. #SchumerShutdown --&gt; https://t.co/dpDaRWla8E
That is why I have also introduced the EL CHAPO Act &amp; the WALL Act ‚Äì 2 bills that would secure our border by funding the wall &amp; fully paying for it. #SecureTheBorder
I have repeatedly called for building a wall as a necessary step in defending our border and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into our country. #SecureTheBorder
Now, it's just politics; their extreme position is driven by hatred for the president. That is an untenable position, and the American people will continue to suffer so long as @SenSchumer and the Democrats persist in shutting down the government to spite the president.
But @SenSchumer &amp; the Dems would rather keep the government shut down in service of raw political gamesmanship. Their position is no compromise, no negotiation &amp; no wall, no matter what, despite the fact that the Democrats have previously voted overwhelmingly to build the wall.
The only reason that we didn't put a bill on the president's desk immediately to pay these essential federal workers now is that the Democrats cynically objected, instead holding the workers hostage to try to win a political war with the president. #SchumerShutdown
I am a co-sponsor of legislation that would pay them all now; if you are being forced to work, basic fairness dictates you should be paid.
Today @SenSchumer &amp; the Dems also objected to paying the @USCG &amp; to paying all essential federal workers--some 425,000 federal workers including TSA officers, air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents, ICE officers, FBI agents &amp; others essential to our national security.
Despite @SenSchumer and the Democrats speaking for years about their concern for the Dreamers, they nevertheless voted down the president's offer of protection for Dreamers.
I agreed to the president's compromise because it didn't extend amnesty to anybody not covered already under current law and, critically, it didn't create a pathway to citizenship for those here illegally.
In exchange, the president offered to provide a three-year extension of status limited to current DACA recipients and current enrollees in TPS.
@POTUS The president put forward a reasonable compromise to end this shutdown. This plan secures our border, funds the construction of a much-needed border wall, and reopens the federal government. #SecureTheBorder
Today I joined a bipartisan majority in voting for @POTUS‚Äô plan to secure our border &amp; reopen the gov. The president asked me to support his plan &amp; I did bc I agree w him that border security is unquestionably a national priority &amp; that we must build a wall to secure the border.

I look forward to working with my colleagues and President Trump to defend against these threats by developing and eventually deploying SBI. --&gt; https://t.co/3xFmejPcmt
The deployment of SBI is critical to engaging missiles when they are at their most vulnerable stage, ascending at slow velocity with high heat signatures, as well as when they are most resilient, traveling through space with decoys and evasive measures.
In the meantime, China and Russia have invested in the development of ballistic missile technology that our existing systems cannot stop, and Iran and North Korea continue to pursue nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Past missile defense reviews have failed to consider the technologies that are needed to protect Americans and the American homeland.

This week @RepJasonSmith and I reintroduced the Student Empowerment Act, which would expand 529 College Savings Plans to include K-12 elementary and secondary school expenses for public, private, and religious schools, including homeschool students. --&gt; https://t.co/wGjrc4IqY3 https://t.co/z7NfvGlv4t
I will continue to urge this administration to vigorously counter Russia, and maintain sanctions‚Äô pressure on corrupt cronies and nefarious companies.
Now these companies will reenter the market, driving down costs and increasing the competitiveness of U.S. firms, including firms that employ tens of thousands of Texans.
As Senate Democrats know well, this agreement weakens Deripaska--a very bad actor--which is why our European allies, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, and the UK, support the Treasury's decision.
They forced the companies to agree to a deal that permanently takes away Deripaska‚Äôs controls, denies personal profits, and implements meaningful checks to prevent backsliding or cheating in exchange for lifting sanctions.
The Treasury Department told those companies that those sanctions would not be lifted until Deripaska gave up his control.
Last year the Trump administration correctly targeted a sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, and sanctioned three Russian companies he controlled, including aluminum companies.
Much work remains to be done to clarify and apply these standards, including in Iran where sanctioned entities like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps control entire sectors of the economy, and I support implementing legislation as aggressively as possible.
One of the most important elements of this sanctions legislation is that it directly targets oligarchs and terrorists who control companies in important industries.
I joined my colleagues in 2017 in voting for the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act to turn the tide in pushing back against Russian hostility &amp; have urged the admin to broadly sanction Iranian, Russian &amp; North Korean bad actors pursuant to that legislation.
Russia‚Äôs hostile actions include bolstering Iran and Assad in Syria, illegally annexing Crimea, and launching waves of cyberattacks against us and our allies. The Obama administration refused to hold Putin accountable.
And, for eight years, President Obama--with the active support of Senate Democrats--demonstrated weakness and appeasement towards Russia, which only encouraged Russian aggression.
Senate Democrats have already shut down the government to prevent commonsense border security, and just this week they have filibustered legislation to strengthen Israel and weaken America's enemies.
Putin is a KGB thug, and Russia is not our friend. And sanctions are an important tool for pressing back on Russia, which is why I have consistently helped lead the fight to enact sanctions.	 	The Chuck Schumer resolution, however, was simply political gamesmanship.
I was happy to recommend Wes, Mark &amp; Sean to @POTUS. They each bring to the bench a proven record of professionalism and excellence. I commend the President for these nominations and urge my colleagues to quickly confirm them to the bench. https://t.co/WVQGFOhhes via @whitehouse

The Palestinian gov provides hundreds of millions of $$ each year rewarding terrorists &amp; their families, providing an incentive for ever more violence. It‚Äôs past time for Congress to impose direct costs on Palestinian officials who manage the programs that provide these rewards.
Palestinian terrorists have wounded or killed more than a dozen Israelis over the last few months, including 45-year old American-Israeli Ari Fuld.
Today I introduced the End Palestinian Terror Salaries Act of 2018, a bill which would impose sanctions against Palestinian officials who provide financial rewards for Palestinian terror attacks. --&gt; https://t.co/shf692SBTQ
I am proud to have worked with @SenBillNelson &amp; @SenMarkey on this bipartisan legislation, and urge my House colleagues to take swift action to pass our bill and send it to the President‚Äôs desk to be signed into law.
It takes the critical step of continuing the operations &amp; utilization of @Space_Station through 2030, ensures the US won‚Äôt cede low-Earth orbit to China, enacts reforms to modernize our nation‚Äôs launch &amp; re-entry regulations &amp; streamlines nongovernmental Earth observation regs.
For over half a century the United States has been the global leader in space. The Space Frontier Act not only ensures that the US will remain the global leader in space exploration, but also reduces regulatory barriers to allow a vibrant commercial economy to flourish in space.
@SenBillNelson @SenMarkey In July, we introduced this legislation to fortify America‚Äôs leadership in space exploration, continue operations for the @Space_Station through 2030, and reign in overreaching regulations to support further development of the commercial space sector.

For decades the United States has been a leader on the global stage and advanced exploration by pushing humans further than they‚Äôve ever gone before.
Congress must do better. I will continue to fight for a better path that respects the will of the American people. ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/0GDRJdTete
Further, this bill continues to fund sanctuary cities, which are defying the law and making Americans less safe. We should instead pass Kate‚Äôs Law, a bill I introduced that would put criminal illegal immigrants in jail so they cannot prey on innocent Americans.
Unfortunately, this continuing resolution fails to reflect these priorities by not sufficiently securing the border. This is a missed opportunity to deliver on the promises made to the American people.
To that end, I introduced the EL CHAPO Act and the WALL Act ‚Äì two bills that would offset the cost of completing the wall and securing our border.
The American people gave us a clear mandate: secure the border and build the wall. I have long called for building a wall as a necessary step in defending our border and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into our country.
It also requires that one of the 1st tasks of the new Assistant Secretary is bringing emerging technologies critical for advancing national interests into the @DeptofDefense. Establishing the Assistant Secretary is a prerequisite to creating a robust military approach to space.
My legislation will establish a new Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space, which would ensure the Pentagon adequately prioritizes the issue and that the Senate is able to provide oversight.
Successfully competing in space requires leaders who are empowered to advocate and allocate the resources they need to secure American leadership in this new domain.
This week I introduced a bill to establish a new position of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space w/n the @DeptofDefense. Since being elected to the Senate I have served as a leader on space issues &amp; an advocate for US military superiority in space. ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/3HZSrT5FUj

Too many young men, particularly young black men, face long mandatory prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses; this bipartisan legislation corrects that injustice. And it will focus our law enforcement resources where they are most needed: preventing violent crime.
It will create greater opportunities for offenders to be rehabilitated, and will reduce the costs of our federal prison system while protecting public safety.
The First Step Act both helps nonviolent, low-level offenders transition back into society while at the same time protecting public safety.
It lowers mandatory minimums for non-violent drug offenders and increases anti-recidivism programs to help offenders better reenter society, while excluding violent offenders from early release from federal prison.
From my first days in the Senate, I have been a strong advocate for criminal justice reform. The First Step Act is a major bill that moves our system in the direction of greater justice.

We introduced this legislation in July to require the review, declassification &amp; release of gov records related to unsolved criminal civil rights cases. Despite being nearly 50 years old, many of these documents are not publicly available and some remain classified unnecessarily.

Undoing that damage requires imposing maximum pressure against the Iranian regime. President Trump was absolutely right when he began that process by withdrawing from the nuclear deal.

The United States is sending a message that it will not turn a blind eye to terrorist war crimes the way the United Nations does, that those who use civilians as human shields are the ones responsible for endangering civilians, and that they will be held accountable.
Hamas engages in the same practices. The international community has failed to hold these groups accountable, and last week the United Nations refused to pass a non-binding resolution condemning Hamas.
For years Hezbollah has used civilian infrastructure in Lebanon to store and launch rockets at Israeli civilians, and in recent weeks we've learned they also use homes to hide the entrances of tunnels dug under Israel's northern border to attack Israeli homes.
I am proud to have worked alongside my colleagues in Congress to hold groups that use human shields accountable, including Iran-backed groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis.
Ultimately, it will prevent the federal government from telling private landowners, farmers, ranchers, and others in Texas and across America what they can and cannot do with their private property.
This proposal will replace the Obama administration's broad regulation which greatly expanded the scope of federal authority over land and waterways in the United States.

It makes common-sense reforms to prison conditions by promoting the compassionate release of elderly prisoners and prohibiting the shackling of pregnant women.
It lowers mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders, creates new programs to reduce recidivism, and gives inmates an incentive to better themselves with those programs through earned time credits.
With these changes, this bill gives non-violent offenders a better chance at rejoining society while keeping violent offenders behind bars.
With these necessary improvements, I believe the Senate should take up and pass this important legislation. I look forward to working hand-in-hand with the White House and the bill sponsors to make sure that happens.
I‚Äôm happy to report that, after working closely with the White House and the sponsors of this bill, they have decided to accept my amendment. This new version of the bill resolves my concerns, and is one that I wholeheartedly support and cosponsor.
At the same time, I do not believe we should be granting early release to violent offenders. That is why I drafted an amendment that would exclude violent offenders from being released early.

The fault for civilian casualties lies with those like Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies who use human shields, and those who are complicit in these practices must be held accountable. --&gt; https://t.co/FBLiha5LfT
I encourage Congress to pass and the president to sign my bipartisan bill to impose sanctions on Hezbollah and Hamas, along with their enablers, for using human shields.
Hezbollah has built these attack tunnels from inside homes, where they also use Lebanese civilians as human shields for their rockets and missiles, of which there are roughly 150,000 pointed at Israeli civilians.
Israel has the absolute right and obligation to dismantle the terror infrastructure that Hezbollah has built in preparation for infiltrating its northern border and attacking its citizens, including the attack tunnels targeted this week by Operation Northern Shield.
Thankfully, Congress recognized the importance of addressing this issue. I am grateful for @SenMarkey‚Äôs leadership, and commend @POTUS  for signing this bill into law today. --&gt; https://t.co/m5XbjhpMMS

Heidi and I wish the Jewish people a very Happy Hanukkah. https://t.co/vyrbfvx15O
It is fitting that this year Hanukkah comes against the backdrop of the one-year anniversary of the United States acknowledging Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital, and it will also be the first Hanukkah since we moved our embassy to its rightful place there.
This holiday celebrates the heroic revolt and triumph of the Maccabees, who liberated the historic land of Judea, rededicated the Second Temple in Jerusalem, and restored the right to worship freely.
The Jewish people will come together this evening to light candles beginning the eight days of observance of #Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, and remember the great miracle that happened in Israel.
Today, George and his beloved Barbara are together, enjoying a well-deserved rest from their labors.		Today, his spirit joins a thousand points of light with his Creator, by whose brilliance may all our works be illuminated and inspired.
In his words, ‚Äúthe old ideas are new again because they are not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.‚Äù
President Bush was the last of the Greatest Generation to sit in the Oval Office, but his resolve will not be lost to the past; it will triumph onward.
Over his storied career, President Bush was a war hero and a businessman, a legislator and an ambassador. His time as Vice President prepared him well for the heavy burdens of that highest office, steering our nation through the fall of the Berlin Wall and the First Gulf War.
Hearts are heavy as we bid farewell to President George H.W. Bush. He was a faithful servant to his country whose legacy of leadership &amp; love of homeland became a family tradition, earned him the admiration of  Americans &amp; secured him a special place in the memory of every Texan.

I'm encouraged by the progress we‚Äôve seen over the past year but the road to recovery continues. I will continue working hard each and every day to ensure that TX communities still suffering from Hurricane Harvey receive the help they need. Together we can &amp; we will rebuild.
I strongly urge my fellow Texans, if you are still in the process of rebuilding and recovering from the ravages of Harvey, to contact your tax advisor or for more information go to the IRS website at https://t.co/x9ul6oePww.
But retirement account withdrawals must be made by December 31, 2018. That deadline is coming up. Texans impacted by Hurricane Harvey who are still rebuilding have until the end of this year to access your savings without a penalty.
So, those hit by the disastrous hurricanes now have the ability to withdraw money from your 401k plans or any other retirement plans in order to rebuild from the storm without having to pay the ten percent penalty that typically applies.
The Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio legislation passed with bipartisan support &amp; was signed into law by @POTUS. An important part of this bill eliminated the tax penalty for hurricane survivors who wanted to withdraw from retirement accounts to pay for the costs of repairs from storm damages.
We also saw members of Congress unite to pass crucial legislation to respond to the hurricane, including a hurricane tax relief bill that I authored along with @JohnCornyn &amp; @marcorubio which provided significant tax relief for survivors of Hurricanes Harvey, Maria &amp; Irma.

The NICA Act and President Trump‚Äôs recent executive order demonstrate the commitment of the entire United States government to ensuring that pressure works. --&gt; https://t.co/k5bGxhu6Bz
The NICA Act ensures that international loans will no longer be doled out to keep the regime afloat, and signals to Ortega and his cronies that the U.S. will continue to increase pressure until they pursue meaningful democratic reform and human rights protections.
Hundreds of Nicaraguans have been imprisoned or killed. Meanwhile the regime exploited international loans to advance their policies.
I commend the Senate for passing the NICA Act. For years the Ortega regime has operated with almost total impunity as it systematically repressed Nicaraguans, targeted political opponents for torture &amp; murder, &amp; aligned w hostile governments like Venezuela, Cuba, Russia &amp; China.

The memorial tower of the new First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs will be a lasting home for the bell of the old church.
We honored the strength and leadership of survivors like Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who lost his own daughter that terrible day, but summoned the grace and courage to comfort his congregation.
But the light of providence shone through dark clouds. We celebrated the heroism of Stephen Willeford and Johnnie Langendorff, who chased down and stopped the murderer. We prayed with the survivors, and their countrymen came together to offer aid and solace.
One year ago today, a madman took 26 innocent lives in an act of pure evil at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The Lone Star State and every corner of our nation mourned the fallen and wept with the wounded.

I look forward to working with my congressional colleagues in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to pass legislation that ensures maximum pressure on Iran.
As I wrote to Secretary Mnuchin in August, in a letter co-signed by 15 Senators, the administration‚Äôs maximum pressure campaign will not succeed if the Islamic Republic remains connected to SWIFT.
The admin should ensure the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication disconnects designated Iranian banks from the global financial system, otherwise the Ayatollahs will use access to wait out the Trump admin in hopes that a future admin will be more appeasing.
Waivers that allow our allies and adversaries to enrich the regime by importing Iranian oil or to bolster Iran's nuclear program through civil-nuclear cooperation should be sharply limited, and ultimately eliminated.
Many more details will be announced in the coming days. It is important to ensure that the final policy imposes maximum pressure on Iran.
The deal gifted the Ayatollahs with over a hundred billion dollars, which they used to export terrorism and build ballistic missiles, while paving the way for them to develop nuclear weapons.

Much like the majority of Texans, I believe the number one thing that makes schools safer is having more armed police officers on campuses.
Texas has not been exempt from the horror of school shootings. All of us have been horrified by the violent attacks on our students. These students, along with parents, local school boards, teachers, and communities across the country want a solution.
Today @marcorubio and I introduced the School Security Enhancement Act, which allows local communities to utilize Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) grants for measures that reinforce school safety infrastructure and technology. --&gt; https://t.co/tDZ0HqZgKT

Proud to work with my colleagues in this bipartisan effort and I am hopeful that additional public interest will bring revelation, justice, and closure where it has long been lacking. --&gt; https://t.co/VvEcjtrfrO
Our bill attempts to address this by disclosing case records so that private detectives, historians, victims, and victims‚Äô families may access these files, pursue leads, and document these tragic events.
Unfortunately, many violent crimes committed against black families struggling for equality during this time were never solved.
The bill would require the review, declassification, and release of government records related to unsolved criminal civil rights cases. The civil rights movement triumphed by securing for millions of people their rightful share in the American Dream.

I have repeatedly introduced legislation requiring the office's closure, and recently @RosLehtinen and I sent a letter to the administration emphasizing that the office was operating illegally &amp; calling for it to be closed.
Until today, presidents from both parties let the PLO keep an office open in DC, which signaled to Palestinian leaders that violence and intransigence had no costs, and so hindered the cause of peace.
Today, Palestinian leaders still refuse to recognize Israel as a Jewish State, still incite and financially reward terrorism, and still lash out against our lawmakers and diplomats.
Thirty years ago, Congress correctly declared that the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and its affiliates were terror groups who had no place keeping an office in the United States. Decades of Palestinian behavior since then has confirmed the wisdom of that judgment.

This announcement is a step forward in the American energy renaissance to boost greater economic growth, create millions of good-paying jobs, lower energy costs &amp; increase energy security. I encourage FERC to expeditiously process &amp; finalize the applications for these projects.
Texas is at the center of the energy renaissance occurring in the United States. The shale revolution has transformed Texas into the leading natural gas producer and the United States into a net exporter of natural gas.
The Texas projects included in this announcement will bring tens of thousands of jobs to the Lone Star State for many years to come, and renewed investment in many communities, some of which are still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.

Quoted by @joshrogin on my NDAA amendment ending Pentagon $$ to Confucius Institutes: "Confucius Institutes are a key way the regime infiltrates American higher education to silence criticism &amp; sanitize education about China...Taxpayer $$ shouldn't be subsidizing propaganda." https://t.co/SADoba5FdF
The funds provided through this Emergency Impact Aid program will support the Texas schools who stepped up to the plate for our children in the aftermath of Harvey.
Hurricane Harvey disrupted the lives of thousands of students. In response, we saw our communities unite to help displaced students continue their academic studies, with many schools opening their doors to Harvey survivors from outside their district.
I am grateful for the leadership of Secretary DeVos and the Department of Education in providing federal support to our students and schools in their time of need. --&gt; https://t.co/AJ478Lv5E6
Today, the Department of Education announced that it will be allotting $174.2 million in federal funds to Texas to cover the costs of educating students who were displaced as a result of Hurricane Harvey.

By addressing US security interests &amp; providing the largest pay raise for service members our military is well funded &amp; able to project strength &amp; promote peace. #FY19NDAA fortifies Texas' position as a pillar of America‚Äôs defense, strategic capabilities &amp; deterrence.
Getting this bill signed into law today demonstrates the focus that unified Republican government has given to rebuilding our military and providing for our national security.

The American Humanist Association convinced the Fourth Circuit to adopt a perverse interpretation of the Establishment Clause, which in no way prohibits a war memorial on public land from featuring religious imagery.
Erected in the aftermath of World War I, the Peace Cross has stood as a testament to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.
The Fourth Circuit agreed, failing to recognize the history and context of the memorial and misinterpreting the Constitution. For 90 years, the families of Prince George‚Äôs County have honored America‚Äôs fallen heroes.
In the aftermath of World War I, residents in Prince George‚Äôs County erected a 40-foot Peace Cross to honor nearly 50 local men who lost their lives in the conflict. In 2014, the American Humanist Association brought a suit claiming the cross violated the Establishment Clause.

This viciousness directly undermines US interests by sowing instability throughout the region. I've previously called on the Admin to sanction leaders complicit in these abuses under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act including Francisco Lopez  &amp; Francisco Diaz.
The violence in Nicaragua and the abuses of the Ortega regime are only getting worse. The regime‚Äôs security forces and police are putting snipers on roofs, shooting protesters, and burning down houses to suppress the opposition.

We can fix this. If my Democratic colleagues will join me, not play politics but work to solve the problem, we can start to end family separation this week. And, we can honor the rule of law.
While cases are pending, families should stay together.Children belong w their families.Once their cases have been adjudicated‚Äìunder my bill, in no longer than 14 days‚Äìthose who meet the standard should be granted asylum &amp; those who don‚Äôt should be returned to their home country.
The answer isn't what congressional Dems are proposing: releasing illegal aliens &amp; returning to the failed policy of ‚Äòcatch &amp; release.‚Äô Rather, we must fix the backlog in immigration cases, remove legal barriers to swift processing &amp; resolve asylum cases on an expedited basis.
I've visited detention facilities tragically housing children. For too long, they've been victims of our broken immigration system, detained under the Obama Administration &amp; through the present, facing horrific physical or sexual assault from human traffickers.

The office was allowed to remain open as long as the Palestinians did not leverage international institutions like the ICC against Israel but instead pursued peace. It is well past time to close it.
The Palestinians have encouraged the International Criminal Court (ICC) to launch a baseless and illegitimate investigation against Israel, which is unacceptable and underlines why Congress long ago prohibited the PLO office in Washington DC.
They have also turned that hostility against the United States, condemning President Trump, Vice President Pence, Ambassador Haley, and other American officials who stood with Israel and against terrorism.

Francisco Diaz, a leader of Nicaragua‚Äôs National Police, should also be targeted for committing serious human rights abuses, including possible complicity in the killing of over 100 peaceful protesters, and sanctioned if found responsible.
The Administration imposed sanctions on Rivas by the end of that month. Congress is now again urging the Administration to take action against Lopez for systemic corruption, which fuels the Ortega regime and undermines the democratic will of the Nicaraguan people.
In December, I joined my colleagues to urge the Administration to invoke the Global Magnitsky Act &amp; designate Roberto Rivas, President of the Supreme Electoral Council &amp; Francisco Lopez, VP of ALBANISA, a tool of the Venezuelan regime that doles out oil to its puppets &amp; allies.

#DoddFrank has driven smaller institutions out of business and consolidated assets into the larger banks. This has left many small businesses out in the cold, as these smaller institutions are the ones they turn to for credit to sustain and grow their businesses.
I applaud @POTUS for signing into law significant reform of #DoddFrank that will help ease the regulatory burden on small to mid-size banks and credit unions.
Yesterday‚Äôs vote will bring positive change &amp; empower victims to report sexual harassment and bring their perpetrators to justice. As a united front, Congress has taken a stand that these actions are unacceptable &amp; must end.
.@SenGillibrand &amp; I introduced a significant piece of legislation to end the use of taxpayer $$ for secret Congressional harassment settlements &amp; to eliminate the intimidating process to file harassment claims. I applaud the Senate for voting in support of our key provisions.
In the recent months, we've seen scores of victims come forth with horrific stories of sexual abuse &amp; harassment. Sadly, we also discovered a pattern of secret taxpayer-funded settlements for members of Congress accused of harassment or assault. That is unacceptable.
We need to do this, and far more ‚Äî Congress should take advantage of every opportunity to reduce our national debt, including saving money that doesn‚Äôt need to be spent.
A great advantage of a rescissions package is that Democrats are unable to filibuster it, which means that if Republicans stand together we can start cutting back on unnecessary spending.
Proud to co-sponsor legislation that serves as a great first step to rein in wasteful government spending, and I applaud @POTUS for putting this process in motion. --&gt; https://t.co/iwzdrzKaSH

Democrats want to turn the Internet into a regulated public utility, which will inevitably limit the freedom and creativity that has been the heart of the Internet since it's beginning.

The steady Iranian escalation again underscores the catastrophic consequences of Obama‚Äôs nuclear deal, which gifted Iran‚Äôs ‚ÄòDeath to America‚Äô regime with resources to wage war and gave the international community the incentive to look the other way at Iranian aggression.

But in this moment we must also remember families like Fred and Cindy Warmbier, whose son Otto returned from North Korea on death‚Äôs doorstep, and died less than a week after coming home. Today‚Äôs development is encouraging but the United States and our allies must remain vigilant.
These Americans persevered through torture and malnourishment amid totalitarian darkness, and I join their families and all our fellow citizens in celebrating their freedom.

There was debate over this in 2015. I said inspections regime required trusting Iran &amp; would facilitate weapons development. Politifact "fact-checked" with Obama-Kerry talking points. Now we know the talking points were false. Iran Deal is too broken to fix &amp; we should withdraw.
Nuclear weapon plans captured by Israel from an Iran warehouse confirm inspectors can't verify nuclear deal. If IAEA didn't know about the warehouse, then inspectors can't enforce. If IAEA did know about it, it shows inspectors are lying about Iran violations to preserve deal.
RT @jamesavery: It is with heartfelt sorrow that we announce the passing of our founder, James Avery. He touched many lives through his art‚Ä¶
He will be sorely missed and forever remembered, and Heidi and I join his family, his employees, and the Kerrville community in celebrating his life of accomplishment.
It is because of Texans like him that the Lone Star State is known across America and around the world for its friendly determination, deep-seated faith, persevering grit, and pioneering spirit.
He returned home, settling in Kerrville, to raise his family and start a business whose brand has become as engrained in the fabric of our state‚Äôs heritage as Dr Pepper or Lucchese boots.
Avery served our nation in World War II as a U.S. Air Force pilot, commanding a B-26 bomber and surviving 44 missions over Nazi Germany.
James Avery is a TX legend whose contributions will live on through the jewelry he crafted for countless of proud Texans across our state &amp; beyond, and the investments he made in the Kerrville, San Antonio &amp; greater TX areas across decades of leadership in the business community.

Non-native species and wildlife within Texas are an important economic driver of our state‚Äôs economy and enrich lands all across the Lone Star State.

My prayers are with the Evans family in this trying time, and all those in the UK who seek a better way of life. Our British cousins deserve better. Alfie deserved better. #AlfieEvans #AlfiesArmy
Alfie‚Äôs tragic situation, reflecting that of Charlie Gard last year, is becoming an all-too predictable consequence of socialized medicine, and the arrogance, imperiousness, and low regard for human life displayed by the bureaucrats who administer it.
The NHS and UK courts refused to release Alfie to the custody of his parents, claiming that it was in Alfie‚Äôs best interests to die.
Despite underestimating Alfie by more than a factor of a thousand, the NHS saw fit to play God. The NHS refused to permit Italy to treat him at no cost. The NHS refused to release Alfie to die at home. The NHS even expelled the priest ministering to Alfie.
He lived for five days, despite his doctors‚Äô ardent refusals to provide oxygen, food, or water to him.
Before the NHS removed Alfie‚Äôs life support over his parents‚Äô wishes‚Äîand the wishes of other nations, the Pope, and people around the world‚Äîhis doctors estimated he would survive for three minutes.
I am saddened to learn of the death of Alfie Evans, whose illness and captivity in the UK drew the prayers and sympathy of millions across the civilized world.

Kim should not be allowed to use negotiations over the denuclearization of North Korea to weaken our alliances with South Korea and Japan, which could risk destabilizing not just the Korean Peninsula, but the entire Pacific Rim.

I encourage all my fellow Americans to join me today in praying for Alfie and his family.
I urge the UK gov to grant the Evans family‚Äôs request to treat their precious child in Italy. Americans strive to achieve the promise of ‚Äúlife, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness‚Äù for all our citizens, no matter how young or old.
National Health Service (NHS) doctors expected that he would pass away within minutes. Again, he fought back; at the time of this writing, he is continuing to breathe without assistance. But time is of the essence.
It is a grim reminder that systems of socialized medicine like the NHS vest the state with power over human lives, transforming citizens into subjects.		Alfie‚Äôs life support was turned off two days ago.
These events remind us of the tragic case of Charlie Gard last year.	It is a sad irony that while the people of the UK are busy celebrating a royal birth, its government is brushing off a commoner‚Äôs right to life.
But UK and European courts have denied their right to seek alternate treatments for their son and instead have forcibly kept him in a hospital. Now they have turned off the ventilator and are waiting for him to die.
Alfie‚Äôs parents, Kate James and Tom Evans, wish to seek experimental treatments for what is thought to be a mitochondrial condition. Italy has granted Alfie citizenship and offered to transport him to a Vatican hospital.
Doctors initially thought that Alfie would not survive long, but he fought back time and time again, until a chest infection forced him to rely on a ventilator.
Alfie Evans was born on May 9, 2016 in the United Kingdom. When he was only several months old, he was struck by a mysterious illness, and slipped into coma.

Necesitamos apoyarlos y rechazar el r√©gimen corrupto que obstaculiza sus aspiraciones, no importando qui√©n sea la nueva cara que est√° al frente del r√©gimen.
El pueblo cubano quiere vivir en paz y no bajo l√≠deres comunistas. Ellos est√°n trabajando arduamente para restablecer la democracia y el estado de derecho.
Por dise√±o, los cubanos no est√°n autorizados a tener elecciones libres y justas. Despu√©s de d√©cadas, el legado de los Castro es una dictadura institucionalizada que sobrevivir√° m√°s all√° del nombre de los Castro.
Esta decisi√≥n no es una transici√≥n democr√°tica de poder y ni siquiera es un cambio de guardia. Cuba es controlado por el Partido Comunista y Ra√∫l seguir√° siendo el l√≠der. La presidencia solo es un puesto ceremonial otorgado por las elites.
Esta semana concluye cerca de 60 a√±os del gobierno formal de los Castro en Cuba, pero solo en nombre. Ra√∫l Castro se retirar√° simb√≥licamente de la presidencia y la Asamblea Nacional de Cuba ha seleccionado un nuevo heredero, el primer vicepresidente Miguel D√≠az-Canel.

They are working hard to restore democracy and the rule of law. We need to support them and reject the corrupt regime that stymies their legitimate aspirations - no matter what new face fronts that regime.
The Castros saw to that; after many decades, their legacy is an institutionalized dictatorship that will survive beyond the Castro name. The freedom-loving people of Cuba want to live in liberty, not under their communist overlords.
Cuba is controlled by the Communist Party and Ra√∫l will remain its head. The presidency is a ceremonial post, underneath the Party's elites. By design, Cubans are not allowed to have free and fair elections.
This move is not a democratic transition of power and it‚Äôs not even a changing of the guard.
This week ends nearly 60 years of formal Castro rule in Cuba - but in name only. Ra√∫l Castro will symbolically step aside and Cuba‚Äôs National Assembly will go through the motions of elevating his heir, First Vice President Miguel D√≠az-Canel. https://t.co/P9f8lN5dzi
And I have no doubt that he will be an effective leader of NASA and will work to ensure the safety of the men and women who step forward to save our country, that he will work to lead NASA in a way to ensure that America continues to lead in space.

And at the end of her life, Barbara Bush had no cause for regret.	 	Indeed, she gave her family, the people of Texas, and all Americans a lifetime worth celebrating.
‚ÄòAt the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend or a parent.‚Äô
It was a symbol of her lifelong tapestry of love and service, stronger than executive orders, long hours, &amp; sleepless nights.	 	In her famous address for the 1990 Commencement at Wellesley College, she reminded graduates to treasure their human connections above worldly concerns:
From China to Texas to DC, Barbara Bush worked on a beautiful floral needlepoint rug, stitching together changing times &amp; geography w constant love &amp; support for her family. Her masterpiece eventually graced the floors of the Executive Mansion, making the White House a true home.
Standing beside him through Congress, the UN, the CIA, and 12 years at the White House, Mrs. Bush approached her public role with a class and grace seldom matched in our nation‚Äôs capital.	 	But it was her private role which she prized above all.
She was as much a public servant as her husband and children: traveling the world as advisor and ambassador, campaigning for adult literacy programs at home, and, of course, making George Senior eat his broccoli.
My prayers are with the Bush family at the passing of their beloved Barbara, an eternal First Lady in the heart of every Texan.

But tonight, our support and prayers are with the brave Americans in uniform, as well as our trusted allies in France and the U.K., who carried out these military strikes.
In the days ahead, I look forward to the President making the case to Congress and the American people that his proposed course of action in Syria is in the national security interests of this country.
We should withdraw from President Obama's disastrous Iran deal that is enriching the Iran government with billions of dollars, and those ill-gotten gains are in turn being funneled to Syria to prop up the Bashar regime.
It is now absolutely crucial that any further military action we take in Syria remains focused on protecting the vital national security interests of our country. In addition to any military action that we may choose to take, we must also take action against Assad‚Äôs financiers.
Critically, that includes preventing those chemical weapons from falling into the hands of the radical Islamic terrorist elements in Syria.
Tonight, the United States responded to the atrocities of Bashar al-Assad. As the President said, it is in our national interest to deter the use of chemical weapons. ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/LoSjjYRRel

Any decision on such an important policy should be made in Congress, not in the courts, and I will continue to fight against an internet sales tax in both.

As told in the Gospel of Luke:		‚ÄúOn the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
As we gather in celebration of Easter, we give thanks to God for His steadfast mercy in spite of these troubles. We remember the ultimate price paid by Jesus Christ for our sins &amp; celebrate his triumphant resurrection over sin &amp; death so that we might live in fellowship with God.

The United States should take all necessary and prudent steps to unmask these efforts for what they are: the propaganda of terrorist-supporting regimes and authoritarian states.
Our adversaries, from the Middle East to Eurasia, are waging influence campaigns against the American people under the guise of objective news, with the goal of shaping Americans‚Äô perceptions in accordance with their nefarious interests.
Qatar‚Äôs Al Jazeera, which the State Department has indicated is state-controlled, produces content that is anti-American, anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, while promoting positive coverage of terrorist organizations such as Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah and Hamas.
The Department of Justice‚Äôs recent designation of Russia‚Äôs RT America as a foreign agent, as well as the questionable practices of Al Jazeera and China Central Television, strongly suggest the presence of a subversive threat in the United States. --&gt; https://t.co/WcdKg6mWIT

This same influence, which is enabling Hun Sen to dismantle all remnants of free speech and fair elections within Cambodia, is targeting universities, businesses, and mass media within America.
‚ÄúWe must cont to apply incremental pressure to Cambodia in advance of July elections. We must recognize that in the backdrop of Hun Sen‚Äôs authoritarian impulses &amp; bombastic rhetoric is Xi Jinping &amp; the growing influence of the People‚Äôs Republic of China throughout Southeast Asia.
On Monday Hun Sen oversaw a farcical election in Cambodia, where his party won all 58 Senate seats. Today the Trump Administration took appropriate measures to curtail or suspend Treasury, USAID, and DOD assistance programs.
Any progress on space-based intercept is contingent upon recommendations from DOD in the forthcoming Missile Defense Review. I call upon DOD to prioritize development and deployment of this critical capability. ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/xE9zbqcHrc
Space-based interceptors could contribute to homeland defense, fulfill boost phase intercept, defend against ICBMs from North Korea &amp; Iran, defend aircraft carriers from anti-ship ballistic missiles, be developed within 10 years, and defend against anti-satellite weapons.
America must deploy a space-based intercept layer that can look down on the ascending threat from the moment of launch, feed info in real-time, and engage the ascending missile during boost phase. This will present more time and intercept opportunities to the United States.
I remain concerned that we have not developed or fielded the requisite capabilities to intercept ballistic missiles during their boost phase of flight, when they are most vulnerable. ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/4BCOgnzjEv

I have called for a US-set tempo of sanctions enforcement that targets North Korean entities and its enablers. We must expeditiously follow this up by announcing fines against any foreign bank, particularly Chinese banks, who facilitate Pyongyang's illicit business network.

In sharing his dream on the Lincoln Memorial steps, he urged America to honor its ‚Äòsacred obligation‚Äô and advocated for the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for every American.
His devotion to truth and justice changed the course of history nearly 55 years ago, when he spoke out against the grotesque injustice of racial discrimination.

I commend President Trump for making clear that, going forward, he will not sign yet another waiver of sanctions on Iran. The Obama Iran nuclear deal has proven a catastrophic failure, funneling billions of U.S. dollars to the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.
