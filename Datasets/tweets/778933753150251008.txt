Sorry, first are is an our.
The more paranoid a conspiracy theory makes you feel, the more anxiety you have, the more likely it is to keep you drawn into it.
Most conspiracy theories will also tap into spiritual or superstitious thinking so that 'having faith/belief" will fill in the blanks where the 'facts' don't line up quite right.
Also when are emotions are triggered, fear, anger,  etc. This effect is heightened and our ability to think logically is impaired. Which is why most conspiracy theories tap into elements that have shock value, like Satanism &amp; pedophilia, or aliens, what have you.
Our brain is naturally inclined to connect data points &amp; to create meaningful patterns out of things. Conspiracy theories tap into this natural inclination.
Seriously though, a good conspiracy theorist can take multitudes of meaningless unrelated data and use it to create pretty much any scenario. I don't post this stuff because it's 'true' but to educate on how these things work.

Nothing like seeing jays and humming birds and other little birds in between size literally 'hanging out' together. Lots of singing and fluffing up. Joyful.
We have hanging baskets with nothing but soft moss and other nesting materials that the birds like to use. They also hang out in them like temporary nest spots when sheltering from the heavy rain.
Living on the west/wet coast of Canada, literally in temperate rain forest territory, we get some heavy rainstorms. Today, like on many very rainy days. Birds are sheltering on our deck.
On our deck are many bird feeders for different types of birds, bird bath and bird houses in the beams overhead. It brings me endless joy to watch them.
When I became bedbound we sold our old house and bought one with a master bedroom with big windows and sliding doors to a big deck so I can see the nature around me.

Now these people know how to put together a good conspiracy theory based on juicy verifiable facts to paint a dark picture: https://t.co/QzuSyBhb49		Maybe #qanon #QArmy should fact check the above site if they want a ride down the rabbit hole.		Live in Love. Love is the light.

Critical thinking is key, if you break down the individual components of conspiracy theories &amp; question them critically, really look at them logically, it doesn't take long for one to realize that it's pretty much all smoke and mirrors.
Conspiracy theories are in part effective because our brains naturally want to seek out patterns. When someone 'connects the dots' for us, and creates a meaningful pattern out of unrelated events, we're inclined to want to believe that the pattern exists.
10) The conspiracy theorist refuses to consider alternative explanations,  rejecting all disconfirming evidence and blatantly seeking only  confirmatory evidence to support what he or she has a priori determined  to be the truth.
9) The theorist is indiscriminately suspicious of all government agencies  or private groups, which suggests an inability to nuance differences  between true and false conspiracies.
8) The theory tends to commingle facts and speculations without  distinguishing between the two and without assigning degrees of  probability or of factuality.
7) The conspiracy theory assigns portentous, sinister meanings to what are most likely innocuous, insignificant events.
6) The conspiracy theory ratchets up from small events that might be true to much larger, much less probable events.
5) The conspiracy encompasses a grand ambition for control over a nation,  economy or political system. If it suggests world domination, the theory  is even less likely to be true.
4) Similarly, the conspiracy involves large numbers of people who would all  need to keep silent about their secrets. The more people involved, the  less realistic it becomes.
3) The conspiracy is complex, and its successful completion demands a large number of elements.
2) The agents behind the pattern of the conspiracy would need nearly  superhuman power to pull it off. People are usually not nearly so  powerful as we think they are.
1) 'Proof' emerges from ‚Äúconnecting the dots‚Äù between events that are not connected. No evidence supports connection except allegation of the conspiracy or when the evidence fits equally well to other causal connections or randomness‚Äîthe conspiracy theory is likely to be  false.
From https://t.co/0yo1fNtqHn 		The more a conspiracy theory manifests the 10 following characteristics, the less probable that the theory is grounded in reality:
People who are interested in conspiracy theories should research how &amp; why conspiracy theories are created, and how they work to con people into buying into these false narratives. Once you understand the methodology, it becomes easier to spot concocted false theories in action.
The vast majority of conspiracy theories are concocted as elaborate pranks, they use fabricated info, with some factual info thrown in, to create a false narrative. Done often with the intention to create societal havoc, political or otherwise.		https://t.co/44EX1vOnVI

This is especially true if you're surrounded by right wing people, it's not only about fighting the good fight, it's about having a support group, a support network of others resisting.
The most effective thing you can do is to get involved with a local #Resistance group, whether it's through @IndivisibleTeam or @swingleft or contacting your local left candidate to volunteer, do it. It's not just the most effective way to #Resist. It's good for you.
Putin &amp; the far right, want to wear us down, overwhelm us, and allow them to simply take over. Much of what happens is designed with that in mind. This is psychological warfare.
It's a lot to take in, it's a lot to keep track of, but it's important to stay engaged. If you have to take a break for self care, do it, but come back to this. Or it will only get WORSE. The biggest mistake we can make is to feel powerless. That is what they want.
It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, to feel afraid, angry, or to not feel and just be numb. It's critical that we do all we can to keep ourselves &amp; others aware of unfolding events, as hard as it can be sometimes, when we're seeing terrible violations of human rights.
The longer the U.S. is being run by Putin's candidate, @realdonaldtRUMP, and the complicit GOP allowing him to continue on the harder it is going to be win our way free of this ever growing oppressive force.
The world is going through a crisis right now. Far right nationalists, backed and funded by Putin, are working to consolidate power for a new world order. It's not just an attack on America, it's an attack on freedom &amp; democracy. It's a dangerous time.

@MacTroll5 Not a liberal, or a conservative, but thanks for playing.
@CoachEddieBlair A) Not 'bashing' anyone.		B) I worked as a psychotherapist, I would not refuse to see a client because they were an avid Trump supporter. That seems ludicrous to me. I don't believe I have the right to use my beliefs as a means to infringe on the rights &amp; needs of others.
@Omegahpla I have absolutely no problem with Christians or Christianity, I don't disapprove of Christianity. I disapprove of bigotry. Not all Christians are bigots, and not all bigots are Christians.
@HideYourLove5 You're right, separate, even far apart, but legally we're one step closer to the potential to refuse CPR. That's what I'm saying, where is the line? Where are we moving the line? Are we moving it towards greater equality? or greater discrimination? Rights can be eroded slowly.
@RichSMallory Small town, they may know them via a third party, they could be responding to an incident in a gay bar, pride parade, etc, the person could be wearing a t-shirt that says gay &amp; proud. A same sex partner saying 'please save my husband!' there could be many ways.
@mansfield64 Equating bestiality &amp; homosexuality is a ridiculous assertion, and an ugly one.
@mycrankyboosez Would the same hold true though for a lifeguard?
Think this doesn't effect you because you're straight? This also opens the door for people to discriminate against other 'groups' of people based on their religious views. We either decide that all people are equal &amp; should be treated as such under the law, or we don't.
The Supreme Court ruling on the #GayWeddingCake in favour of Masterpiece Cakeshop sets a dangerous precedent. What if an emergency responder decides it's against their religion to perform CPR or other life saving measures of a gay patient? Where is the line?

What's needed is affordable easy access to mental health services for those struggling. Particularly with troubled youth, there needs to be a greater support system &amp; resources available. As well as addressing bullying, abuse &amp; other causes of trauma children are subjected to.
I'm concerned laws created to confiscate guns from those with mental illness (most are non-violent.) will lead those struggling with mental illness to stay silent &amp; not reach out for support from loved ones &amp; needed mental health services. This could create even greater problems.
Gun's don't kill people, people kill people, but guns make it SO easy, that toddlers with guns kill people in the US regularly. Toddler shootings aren't a thing in other countries. Gun access is the problem. What America needs is far fewer guns. https://t.co/i3b4uLU1cS
There is no causative effect of violent movies, TV, music, games, etc, on gun violence. We watch the same violent movies &amp; shows, listen to the same music, &amp; play the same violent games here in Canada, as they do elsewhere in the world. The gun violence problem is a GUN problem.

What you choose to do doesn't change who they are, only what kind of person you are. I suggest you focus on that, rather than genitalia.
Most importantly a person's gender identity is real to them. You can either accept it &amp; them, or contribute to their oppression &amp; pain.
Gender has never been binary, will never be binary. Get over it &amp; accept that diversity is here to stay, is natural, &amp; even a good thing.
Culturally &amp; historically more than 2 genders goes back as far as our records do. Many societies have always recognized 3 or more genders.
Before you argue that having chromosomes not XX or XY is rare, you may want to check the stats. It's more common than most think.
Though scientifically speaking if you're up to date those characteristics define sex not gender. But ANYWAY you define it. It's more than 2.
Is your definition testes or ovaries? There are people w both, penis or vagina? There are people w both, XX or XY? There's XO, XXY, XXY, etc
Dear right wing idiots who think science proves only 2 genders, do better research. No matter how you scientifically define gender it's &gt; 2.

They've never been a solution to overcoming corruption of wealthy elite in government. They just wanted to run the scam for themselves.

Just keep reading those two pieces of their conversation I started this thread with. This is who they really are &amp; how they really operate.
They use popular culture, humor, 'fun', to draw in people, particularly youth. Like appropriating Pepe the frog. It's just memes right?
Hate groups change their 'image' the labels they use, the symbols they use, all the time, to distance themselves from negative past imagery.
They recruit them by selling them on some idyllic fantasy, a feeling of belonging to something good, of being a part of some kind of family.
Hate groups, like pedophiles, groom people. They looks for people who  are angry, hurt, vulnerable, lonely, isolated, misfits, etc,
They stoke existing fears, biases &amp; misconceptions. Nobody starts out thinking they're going to deliberately mow people down in car.
Hate groups don't present to people they're recruiting as hate groups. They 'pill' you bit by bit, they lay down trust, friendship &amp; lies.
The lure of a 'peaceful white ethnostate' is a fallacy they knowingly fabricate to draw in 'normies' they clearly state who they are here: https://t.co/ubidQDoOcZ
Note the wording, 'movement of peace guise' - being peaceful is literally being used as a disguise for them, the reality is hate is violent. https://t.co/d55JRQPf9v

@MikicalKS That's exactly what I'm saying.
When wanting to promote diversity, representation, racial justice, equality, etc, we need to look at a person's values, thoughts &amp; actions.
Ideally that candidate would be female &amp; feminist. But if that's not the option, we need to take the contents over the packaging.
Feminism shouldn't be about electing a woman, any woman. It should be about electing the most feminist candidate available, even if male.
You can have a leader like Omarosa, whose 'category' may represent black women, but is she in content &amp; action representing them well?
What I got from this was we need leaders that don't just represent diversity by being a 'category'/'minority', but who also promote it.

Image I took down, for people wondering what the to-do was, was Trump &amp; Kim Jong Un naked in bed together as a couple, from the waist up.
Going to take it down, because I want to limit it being copied &amp; shared in a context where people might not discuss how it can go wrong.
...for the wrong reasons, and not for the intended reason, which means it could promote hate. So I'd like to apologize for anyone it hurt.
I've given it a lot of thought. In retrospect I wouldn't have created &amp; posted this image. It's apparent some people find it funny... 1/?
@cityflowersoda But if -most- people find it funny because they see two men together as weak or obscene, then it's really problematic.
@cityflowersoda I've been partnered with a big bi man for 26 years, we both think it's funny precisely because Trump is a toxic homophobic man.
@cityflowersoda You're definitely not alone in that assessment, I'm worried that's why most people find it funny, though it's not why I find it funny.
