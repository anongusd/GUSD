As a #VirginiaTech graduate, my heart goes out to all families who lost loved ones and nearly did, including @LoriHaasVA and @papagodd who have become such fierce advocates for gun violence prevention.  We have momentum for change and the will to make a difference. #Midterms2018 https://t.co/Y0EJ42zPFE
Easy access to unsecured firearms is at the root of far too many gun deaths in this country. The case below is no exception. If we want to save loved ones who are at risk, locking up guns and removing them from access is key to saving lives. #Enough #SuicidePrevention https://t.co/qazvqV5x96
