I point this out only to underscroe that this wasn't just the dishy daytime talk shows or the Howard Stern Show, this was the intelligentsia elite.
John told me he has remained in touch to this day with Talese, who he wants to tell his full story.
"...But I do not recall any woman of my generation ever lodging a litigious complaint of 'marital sexual abuse' against her husband while she was willingly residing with him."
This didn't make it into the piece, but in his essay on the trial, Talese basically says marital rape is an oxymoron. "A woman possessed the irrefutable right to be hailing from a 'headache'...now and then.."
Gay Talese, on assignment for The New Yorker, wrote an entire treatise defending John Bobbitt's penis. "In this time of expanding women's rights and demands, was a married man's penis entitled to no privilege whatsoever within the lawful staet of matrimony?" he wrote.
@MonicaLewinsky Thank you, Monica. Lorena told me she ached for you watching everything unfold in real time.

It occurred to me that there would be no documentary, no Bobbitt jokes or permanent place in popular culture, had John severed some vital piece of Lorena. https://t.co/BRkK5x08hw
None of which is to say what she did isn't a gruesome crime, but it looks different through the prism of #MeToo. Would we even know who Lorena Bobbitt was had John cut off some vital piece of her?
He was acquitted on marital sexual assault before she was found not guilty by reason of insanity for "malicious wounding." John went on to be arrested several more times in the coming years, including being convicted for violence against 2 different women.
Lorena was 24, an immigrant from Ecuador. She was terrified she would be deported if she left John. Plus, she had nowhere to go. She'd sleep in her car outside the nail salon where she worked after John would allegedly rape and beat her. (He has denied the charges.)
They didn't cover the abuse. Lorena Bobbitt repeatedly called 911. Marital rape was still legal in some states and considered an oxymoron by many in media, including Gay Talese on assignment for The New Yorker and Ladies' Home Journal.
Charlie Rose. Gerlado Rivera. Howard Stern. Al Franken. These are the men who told us what to think about the John and Lorena Bobbitt saga. Stories look different depending on who is telling them. 		https://t.co/ZmfGlNZ7lH

@kmarch67 Thanks. I think this book pigeonholed itself, but the beautiful thing about books is we can agree to disagree. Appreciate the feedback.
@kmarch67 I‚Äôd love your opinion, if you get a chance to browse that book. It‚Äôs lovely but was the only one of the bunch that felt somewhat exclusionary.
@kmarch67 100% agree...which is why in this review I recommended books about Sonia Soyomayor, Barbara Jordan, Elizabeth Warren and Eliza Hamilton.

@Coolounig @bklyn_momjeans @rubycramer This is a BuzzFeed story. I don‚Äôt have any control over the image.
@rtraister @elongreen Completely. I hear ya. That‚Äôs why I wanted to make it the lead. I think a lot of readers don‚Äôt entirely realize that someone can regularly go from picketing a PP clinic to walking into the *same* PP clinic for an annual exam.
@nloquendi @rtraister @elongreen Yes, of course. Horrendous and tragic, But a fourfold increase in violence, protests to 21,000+ in a single year isn‚Äôt nothing.
Burns Strider told @rubycramer that kissing staffers on head was  religious, part of his daily ‚Äúdevotionals,‚Äù other behavior women said was inappropriate was due to his ‚ÄúSouthern background.‚Äù https://t.co/yUj2qX8clO
@rtraister @elongreen And I agree both with your critique of the Tweet and the omission. I went with data I thought were stark but could‚Äôve (or should‚Äôve) included a specific act of violence.
@rtraister @elongreen I don‚Äôt think everyone realizes that and it was a point Cecile has worked hard to emphasize during her tenure. But I appreciate your careful read of the story and the feedback. Thanks.
