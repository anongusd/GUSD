While the hearing is in recess, write to your lawmaker now and tell them: no one should have to experience violence on the job. Co-sponsor the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act (HR 1309)! #PreventionIsPossible https://t.co/i93zPjjpfE
Concerns on HR 1309 include lack of due process and lack of research into changing OSHA rules, and the diminished role of employers in helping to write these rules. @RathManesh #PreventionIsPossible
Next up: @RathManesh, a lawyer on OSHA issues. "It should be beyond dispute that employers have an important role to play in the identifiable risks for healthcare and social service workers." #PreventionIsPossible https://t.co/AHAAy24XUJ
"Workplace violence against social workers is real, and it happens frequently." While some states, like Massachusetts, have put violence prevention plans in place at workplaces, many states have not yet made such rules. @nasw #PreventionIsPossible
"Believe it or not, social workers are among the 10 most dangerous professions that we have." 58% of social workers have experienced violence in the workplace - and 15% had been assaulted in the past year. #PreventionIsPossible @nasw
Next up: Dr. Angelo McClain, of the National Association of Social Workers. "These tragedies that happen to healthcare and social workers, they're far too common." @nasw #PreventionIsPossible https://t.co/OViMDYwxli
"I hope telling my story will help prevent assaults on other healthcare providers. With your help, it will." #PreventionIsPossible
"When nurses and healthcare workers are safer, so are our patients. We need the equipment, personnel, and training to do our job safely. Our patients and our healthcare system cannot afford to lose more good nurses." #PreventionIsPossible
"My colleagues spoke to management, and pressed for improvements. But they were not heard." Moon-Updike hopes that the passage of HR 1309 would help put oversight in place so others don't suffer as she has. #PreventionIsPossible
"I loved being a nurse. I do not know what to call myself now." Moon-Updike says that she lost her calling to help people because of the assault she suffered on the job. #PreventionIsPossible @WFNHP https://t.co/QnkSrsgTVv
"I was praying to stay conscious." Moon-Updike was taken to the trauma hospital across the street, holding her neck for fear of dying. Her trachea was intact - but after the attack, she was diagnosed with PTSD. #PreventionIsPossible
As they tried to calm the young man down, only 2 security guards arrived when they called for help. They secluded him and stepped away - but he kicked Moon-Updike in the neck, causing her to snap backwards and lose her breath. #PreventionIsPossible

"When things go wrong, our caregivers rise tot he occasion. They deserve a thoroughly vetted and researched solution that protects them in the line of duty." @RepByrne #PreventionIsPossible
.@RepByrne is concerned that HR 1309 would impede OSHA's rule making process. #PreventionIsPossible
We need a solution to protect employees, as we as providing flexibility to employers to do so. @RepByrne #PreventionIsPossible
"The nature of work in these industries require healthcare and social service workers to interact with individuals with great stress, trauma, and grief, which can cause situations to devolve into safety risks." @RepByrne #PreventionIsPossible
.@RepByrne is up next for opening statements. "Protecting the safety of healthcare and social service workers is not a partisan issue." #PreventionIsPossible
"Healthcare and social service workers do important, life-saving work. The least we can do is ensure they can come home safe at the end of the work day." @RepAdams #PreventionIsPossible
HR 1309 would compel OSHA to issue standards to employers working in healthcare &amp; social services on work practices, training, and incident reporting. It would also protect public employees in the 24 states not covered by OSHA standards. @RepAdams #PreventionIsPossible
Right now, OSHA has no required violence prevention plan, leaving them with few guidelines to enforce safety measures on the job. @RepAdams #PreventionIsPossible
"These violence incidences are not just part of the job. They are predictable and they are preventable." By passing HR 1309, OSHA would have the tools to help protect healthcare and social service workers. @RepAdams #PreventionIsPossible
In 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that healthcare and social service workers were 5 and 9 times more likely to be injured on the job, respectively, than other fields. @RepAdams #PreventionIsPossible
