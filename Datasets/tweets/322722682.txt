We need not recount the numerous times this president has frowned on immigrants from s-hole counties. It‚Äôs racism masked as security
@bobbygscott @realDonaldTrump @CleanAirMoms @democracynow @POTUS And the technology has advanced SO much in years that simply saying barrier insults the intelligence of our country.
@bobbygscott @realDonaldTrump @CleanAirMoms @democracynow @POTUS the funds currently allocated in the budget have not been spent. Furthermore, the president had an opportunity to fully fund the ‚Äúwall‚Äù through control of both houses of Congress for 2 years. To lay this at the feet of Dems &amp; on the backs of the American people is unconscionable

Tweeting has to end, stand by for radio!
Watch is also critical to increase. We have to own up to some of our responsibility to improve our own neighborhoods
McGee - will have to pay more	McMiller - need to connect the dots. Put resources behind the people and programs that are good. Neighborhood
Crime? How would you turn around? - cox - pay officers better and provide resources 	McGee - recruitment and retention are major issues
Cox- concern is for senior Citizens 	McGee - concern again for seniors	McMiller - we're in a period of transition and we have to let it work
7. Complaints on water meter install and high bills. How would you handle. Vazzana- should never have done	Cox - problem started long ago
McGee - we still have projects that are being completed from old bonds issued. We want to fix streets not potholes
Cox - we've fallen short with respect to our grant applications. Federal money is available
Vazzana - work with transportation
McMiller - the doors are open to whoever knocks and she will be villigent  in knocking on those doors
Cox- economic development. Has met with governor and we have a new director
McMiller- was part of emerge leaders and believes that if our problem is education we CAN be, if problem is training, we CAN me
6. Greenville mayor must be biggest cheerleader, McGee- has connections across the nation that can help
Vazanna- he lives among the people, not on Tampa drive
McMiller- we have to deal with the human condition of the people of greenville. All basic conditions are the same. We all want to b winners
Mcgee - cultural divide is real in Greenville. Need someone who is willing to call all parties together and call a truce
5. How do we cross cultural divide? Cox- get churches to participate in Goverment &amp; develop trust that we do what we say we're going to do
McMiller - gotta look like a winner. Continue the things that work while reassuring our communities that we are winners and start looking it
McGee - city has not made clean up a priority and paid attention to the small things. Don't need a bond issue to clean curbs
Cox- cleanup efforts &amp; participate in community clean up campaigns
4. How would you help aesthetics of city? Phil Vazanna refuses to answer. Says problem is crime
McGee- city Hall needs to know what are the needs of the school to make it a key selling point for the Communtiy. Hold board accountable
Cox- biggest problem in schools is reading. Need to continue to support the school and board in addressing this problem
3. How to improve schools? - McMiller sit down with schools and establish trust. Vazzana - ad hoc group to support the schools.
Cox - work with city council then work with department heads to understand them better. Then review budget
McMiller- police dept. is most important and they are in every neighborhood everyday. take the politics out of policing. PROFOUND
What's priority in 1st 90 days McGee - get up to speed on current issues
Question 1. What's is the 1 big idea for Greenville? Cox- sportsplex, McGee - partnership with county officials, McMiller - prayer luncheon
Candidates are making opening statements Cox, McGee, McMiller, &amp; Vazzana are all present. Mrs. McMiller is only female @MoreWomen2012

Excutive session. I'm sticking around "to see what the end gonna be" #greenvillepublicschool
No superintendent report no open discussion or questions from audience. I'm disappointed. #greenvillepublicschool
Dr. Jan Vaughn made excellent point. #greenvillepublicschool needs stability &amp; Dr. Taylor could do that. I can't believe there was no second
#greenvillepublicschool board holds on superintendent for executive session. Lots of crowd rumblings. Clearly we need new board members
Motion dies for lack of second. Dr. Loretta Shannon wants to amend. She opposes. She wants interim for a period of time.
