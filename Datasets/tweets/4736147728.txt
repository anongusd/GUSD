Rebuilding America‚Äôs Middle Class (RAMC) advances policies to build a stronger, better-educated middle class. Last week‚Äôs White House executive order and the related CEA report, and today's CTE Act reauthorization are welcome developments in our ongoing work in Washington, DC.
"Community colleges in partnership with local industries offer some of the most innovative reskilling programs in the United States," said the CEA. "These programs have the advantage of addressing a localized skills gap jointly determined by industry and education institutions."
RAMC was also pleased that earlier last week the White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) released a report outlining the importance of reskilling America‚Äôs workers for the jobs of the future.  The report calls for an emphasis on the "reskilling" of adults in their prime.
We believe that most jobs in the future will require more than a high school degree, yet we know that the number of students graduating from college is tapering off.  Community colleges are perfectly positioned to provide the opportunities needed to help Americans succeed.
We are also pleased to see @realdonaldtrump last week sign an Executive Order to prioritize and expand workforce development by establishing the National Council for the American Worker, which is charged with developing a national strategy for training and re-training workers.
Rebuilding America‚Äôs Middle Class (RAMC), a coalition of community colleges that aims to rebuild America‚Äôs middle class by promoting the vital role of community colleges in workforce development, is pleased that @realDonaldTrump has signed legislation reauthorizing the #CTE Act.

And RAMC's May concluded: "The new higher education act must prioritize career and technical education certificates and degrees and provide them the same value as baccalaureate and advanced degrees. Businesses are pleading for higher education to fill their talent pipelines."
RAMC's May added: "Today‚Äôs economy demands a flexible and trained workforce. We need the flexibility to leverage private partnerships to get students skilled through short-term training, work-learn programs, and apprenticeships. This requires flexible and funded Workforce Pell."
RAMC's Joe May today before the Senate HELP Committee: "The Higher Education Act was created at a time when there were great middle-class jobs that required no more than a high school diploma. Today, we live in a different world."

Nearly 8 MILLION students count on Pell Grants when pursuing #HigherEducation #PROSPERAct
New post: Washington Wrap Up ‚Äì December 12, 2017 https://t.co/WqfAbmLht1
RAMC will continue to work to improve several other provisions of the bill that are likely to have an adverse impact on many of our students, such as the elimination of undergraduate subsidized loans and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.
While RAMC appreciates the Committee‚Äôs efforts to improve the HEA‚Äôs data collection and transparency provisions and provide more information to students and the public, we believe there is more work to be done here, too.
RAMC also appreciates the Committee‚Äôs efforts to address issues related to returning Title IV funds but this provision requires further examination to determine the potential impacts on our schools and the students we serve.
RAMC appreciates the Committee‚Äôs move toward program-focused loan repayment rates, rather than cohort-focused default rates, but we believe this policy needs to be closely reviewed to determine its potential impacts on our students, programs and institutions.
However, RAMC also believes that certain provisions of the PROSPER Act require further analysis to determine their impacts on students and IHEs.
The PROSPER Act would provide institutions with the flexibility to better support competency-based education, which would create additional postsecondary education opportunities that allow students to learn at their own pace.
The PROSPER Act would create a new program and support partnerships between IHEs and businesses to expand access to apprenticeships and earn-and-learn programs.
The PROSPER Act would improve the Federal Work-Study program by updating it to better target high-need areas, focus on undergraduate students and foster greater Work-Study opportunities with businesses.
The PROSPER Act would allow students to use Pell Grants for shorter-term programs, which would provide students with more opportunities to pursue a high-quality, industry-led postsecondary education that is tailored to their career path.
RAMC is pleased that the PROSPER Act would expand access to higher education for many adult and working students and help them to cost-effectively fund their education.
However, we are also concerned with certain provisions and need to examine others to determine their real-world impacts on our students and colleges.
As a coalition of community colleges, we believe that the PROSPER Act contains a number of provisions that would improve our ability to provide a high-quality, low-cost education that prepares students to achieve their life and career goals.
With the PROSPER Act set for mark-up tomorrow in the House Education and Workforce Committee, our chairman Dr. Joe May, chancellor of @DCCCD, wrote a letter to Chairwoman Virginia Foxx to express RAMC‚Äôs views on the proposed legislation.
