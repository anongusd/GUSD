Dr. Ford, as any single American called to Congress, will appear as she is scheduled and not appear when she decides. It does not work that way, unless the Democrat puppetmasters are merely using her as yet another tool. They have no loyalty,  only a narrative. #MAGA
When Dr. Christine Ford sold out for the court of public opinion on the eve of the #SCOTUS vote decades later, it pains one to believe she would ever have expected to be heard by us with an open mind like we have so graciously offered. Dear Democrats...checkmate. #MAGA
On today's #SCOTUS timeline...The accusations of a Liberal 'pink hat for science' protester seem a bit outdated. Her legal team is in no position to dictate to #Congress; they must comply.		"Show up or shut it please," -Anonomous Democrat Source.		#MAGA https://t.co/Kaa44rWfrY

We agree! https://t.co/OOU4EibmG1
@StuMcal @FoxNews Your suggested changes are noted, but the #2A is a right of the people, by the people, and for the peole to protect them from the very government who serves this great nation should that entity ever 'fundamentally transform' into tyrrany. #MAGA
@StuMcal @FoxNews 8. (Your 7) Mental health checks. By whom, to what end, does it permantly exclude someone from gun ownership? What about temporary issues vs. Long term? Slippery slope with this area.	 Unreasonable 'search' as defined by the #4A comes to mind.
@StuMcal @FoxNews 7. (Your second 6) A buyback program is horrific and promotes a vicious black market trade (like Australia), but more importantly it is a form of government disarming citizens who enjoy the #2A to protect them from tyranny in the first place.
@StuMcal @FoxNews 6. 'Bump sticks'...we believe you may mean bump stocks are in current legislation, but are easily fabricated. Criminals don't care.
@StuMcal @FoxNews 5. Gun show, aka loophole,  can be standardized to reflect current processing time in many areas of under 1 hour. 'Days' is unacceptable. State police monitor the process and move quickly already against felons.
@StuMcal @FoxNews 4. Silencers are protection equipment for the operator of the firearm. Although misunderstood in nature and intent, many states already regulate them.
@StuMcal @FoxNews 10-20 years for gun control unacceptable to your above preamble.
@StuMcal @FoxNews 1. National reciprocity allows law abiding legally armed citizens to not be in a situation of micro-legislation. Standard sure.	2. Assault weapons are machine guns already regulated, automatics are not in the category; Magazines-No.	3. Background checks, w/o database is the norm.

@StuMcal @FoxNews Many schools already have armed personnel already. How can a few more levels of security across a building decrease learner protection? What are your suggestions for middle ground? A phrase is not just tagline. Why didn't Democrats take care of it a few years back w/a majority?
@StuMcal @FoxNews These questions still remain: Do criminals obey laws? Is an armed/trained citizen going to react to active shooters faster than 911 can arrive? No one can stop all monsters from trying harm our children, but we can try. We can both agree that their safety/security comes first.
@StuMcal @FoxNews First off isn't it sexist to assume this feed is managed by a 'guy', 2nd we are surprised you didn't mention race, 3rd, your opinion is duly noted as a anti-gun Liberal who thinks 'school militias' are an actual response vs well-trained SROs/staff who instantly react, not cower.
@StuMcal @Education4Libs @NRA There is an inherent 'tell' between socialist yearning liberals and the rest of America. The Constitution is not a living document, but the framework of our very nation's existance. Thank you for revealing your 'tell'.
@StuMcal @Education4Libs @NRA Criminals could care less about laws. They will only get more creative to achieve their intent. Reagan believed in peace through strength, and protecting our children with armed staff members at schools will provide such deterrence as part of a larger program.

@StuMcal @Education4Libs @NRA So what defines the #Democrats marketing tagline of 'reasonable Federal gun laws'?
