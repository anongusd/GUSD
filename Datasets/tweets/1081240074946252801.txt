With my voice on this committee, I will be in a unique position to fight and deliver, not just for Southern Arizona but for our entire state. #AZ02 #SouthernArizona https://t.co/nlbaatpBKd

Last week our office got a lot done. DC Highlights: We met with Jan 8th survivors @GabbyGiffords and discussed HR 8 on the house floor, we met with @momsforcleanair, interview w/ MSNBC &amp; found out we will be on the Appropriations Committee! This week is even busier! #AZ02 https://t.co/9QGB6bZeuN

Our #AZ02 constituent services staff will be available at the Resource Fair and Town Hall for Furloughed Federal Employees until 7:00 pm tonight. Swing by if you have any questions about resources in the community. https://t.co/TSdVZNIKkz

Today my colleagues and I called for the Senate GOP to put our working American families before party politics. AZ is one of the states worst affected by the #TrumpShutdown. We need to re-open the government immediately and pay our federal workforce. #AZ02 #EndTheShutdownNow https://t.co/fVilbu6cH6
Southern Arizona is unified behind our workers. Our #AZ02 constituent services director, alongside representatives from @RepRaulGrijalva and @RepOHalleran, presented on how our offices can provide assistance during the shutdown. https://t.co/6WxxhA9rXM
If you have questions about your benefits or need assistance during the shutdown, PALF’s resource fair is scheduled through 1:00 p.m., and a second fair begins at 5:00 p.m. tonight for those who still are required to work without pay. https://t.co/6mUetuNpqh
This is a union hall full of workers who are affected by the government shutdown. These are the Americans who are shouldering the burden of senseless political games on the part of this administration. https://t.co/qxq1Qwjl6i
Right back at you @RepRubenGallego! Your leadership and office staff work incredibly hard for #Arizona https://t.co/BQdYiRefhz
Politicians and pundits who talk about our border in abstraction miss the mark. Southern AZ residents know the border is one of our greatest economic assets and even live on both sides of where @realdonaldtrump wants to build his wall. Read my take in @rbravender’s story. https://t.co/8s6iCLV3XY
I applaud my colleagues who are putting politics aside and standing up for workers. We may not agree on everything, but we must come together for common-sense solutions that protect our workers and keep our country protected and functioning. https://t.co/jM4mcI5vJZ
Americans are showing up to work and won't be paid. That's unacceptable. Our country's workers shouldn't be held hostage for political posturing. I've cast my votes to open our government and I'm calling on my colleagues to do the same. https://t.co/CJjUjRNnO8
The Pima Area Labor Federation will be hosting a resource fair for furloughed workers TOMORROW. This is available to ANY federal employee who would like to learn about resources available to you during the shutdown. RSVP via https://t.co/YFJeT2mrXP https://t.co/Tb9WLTaiRo
For Tucson, gun violence is personal. We have a responsibility to act on our thoughts &amp; prayers. I'm a proud co-sponsor of H.R. 8, a bill that would require background checks for firearm sales and help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. #AZ02 https://t.co/cfYiptgGyH
My heart goes out to this family and I offer my sincere condolences in this difficult time. We hope that the investigators will work quickly to seek the truth and bring justice for this woman and her family. https://t.co/sXGIBrJpLL
The President has been unable to deliver his one campaign promise, so he is crying wolf in the name of security. Southern Arizonans know that shutting down the government over a wall makes our country less secure. We need to re-open the gov and pay our federal workforce! #AZ02 https://t.co/as9AqKFAdd
I am supporting H.R. 8 because thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need action to address the gun violence that has taken the lives of so many Americans. Thank you @RepThompson &amp; @GabbyGiffords for all your work on this issue. #AZ02 #SouthernArizona https://t.co/fsaa5iBxBL

.@GabbyGiffords has been my mentor since my early days of public service. Her bravery, dedication, and relentless fight for a safer Tucson—and a safer country is inspiring. I am honored to call @GabbyGiffords my friend, my mentor, and Tucson's greatest champion. https://t.co/auCmm1UdtK
Today our office met with the powerful, incredible survivors of Jan. 8th. Their stories of that day and actions that followed show us strength and resilience. I am grateful for their fight and the powerful impact they have on our community. #AZ02Strong https://t.co/xbRlCm8VZV
Today, we remember those we lost on January 8, 2011. https://t.co/GRdhZVWpAC
Eight years later, Tucson honors the lives of those we lost on January 8th. Southern AZ gathered to renew our commitment to civility and tolerance in our politics and our community. We remember the spirit of public service and reverance that brought us together that day. https://t.co/1icFY2OG11
It's been 8 year since the horrific tragedy in Tucson, a day that changed so many of us. Americans have waited for action to follow the thoughts &amp; prayers. Finally, our Congress will introduce a bill to honor the lives of so many Americans robbed by gun violence. #AZ02 https://t.co/Vz3kW8KzAM
