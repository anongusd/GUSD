@ritz245552 @levarburton Well, you can say that, but sources say otherwise...		https://t.co/3p9cywZlpk
BTW - it's foolish to assume all #MAGA supporters are bad people just as it is foolish to assume all #SocialistDemocrat supporters are bad people.  Maybe we can start there in our search for common ground.
I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Rice at the #Masters two years ago.  Her accomplishments transcend #race, #gender, #party, etc., and prove anything is possible in the #USA. https://t.co/PRIxiI7h0f
Well said.... https://t.co/wEOzr6frOb
@levarburton Agreed but keep in mind it's just as American for people to disagree with the players and exercise their rights to express that opinion too.  The #NFL seems to be losing fans over this, which means less revenue for the #NFL, which ultimately means less revenue for #NFLplayers.
What's happening is many right leaning centrists are as put off by some of the #SocialistDemocrat platform as many left leaning centrists are put off by some of the #MAGA platform.   Hard to compromise when there is no room for it.....
Seeing a bunch of activity about "Trump's base" and how he caters to it all the time.  As seen in the gubernatorial races in FL and GA and many of the congressional races across the country, there really is no middle ground.  Choice is either #MAGA or #SocialistDemcrat.

If the argument/position/theory is solid; there should be no need to support it with misleading or completely bogus stats.  It seems that the rampant use of bad info is having the effect of reinforcing the left and right bases.  In effect keeping the country divided. https://t.co/DC7ldhNSQP
Prediction for November: 		If the economy continues to roll, repubs hold majorities.  		If the economy tanks before then, repubs don't hold majorities.  		Roughly 50% of America will continue to hate Trump and roughly 50% of America will continue to love Trump.
