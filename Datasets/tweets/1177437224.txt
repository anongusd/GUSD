Hoy lo √∫nico que siento es gratitud por todos los que han hecho mi servicio al p√∫blico posible durante los √∫ltimos 8 a√±os - especialmente mi familia y mi equipo. Mi deseo: que los futuros oficiales electos ayuden a sanar las profundas heridas pol√≠ticas que existen en EEUU
Today all I have in my heart is gratitude for everyone who made my public service possible over the last 8 years - especially my family &amp; my team. I hope those who remain in the arena will work to heal our country's deep political wounds. I will do my best as a private citizen.

@GabyPacheco1 @Enrique_Acevedo Some people dehumanize themselves by way of their conduct.
@Enrique_Acevedo @GabyPacheco1 Perhaps with the exception of those who exhibit subhuman behavior such as murdering and raping children. If you have sympathy for such people, I find it remarkable.
.@JPerezMDPD it seems like your officers acted swiftly and decisively this morning in @Cityofdoral. Thank you for keeping us safe. https://t.co/mJQFdTR824
@GabyPacheco1 @Enrique_Acevedo Moreover, people - many who applauded when Hillary Clinton labeled millions of Americans as ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù - should not pretend to feel so offended when violent gang members who murder and rape children are referred to as ‚Äúanimals.‚Äù It‚Äôs hypocritical - at best.
@GabyPacheco1 @Enrique_Acevedo News outlets were dishonest or at least misleading by reporting that the President referred to immigrants as animals - so much so that several outlets retracted or corrected their initial reporting.

Congratulations to JP Morgan employees in South Florida &amp; throughout the country. American workers &amp; families continue to benefit from last year‚Äôs #TaxReform legislation. #TaxCutsandJobsAct  https://t.co/1RiT8zES14
@AceOutWide We are in a better place today than we were three days ago. Paciencia, fe y trabajo.
Los cierres de gobierno nunca son deseables. Sin embargo es innegable que hoy nos encontramos mas pr√≥ximos que nunca antes a un acuerdo sobre inmigraci√≥n que garantice el futuro de los #DREAMers en üá∫üá∏ y fortalezca la seguridad fronteriza. #DACA
A government shutdown is never something to celebrate. However, there is no denying that we‚Äôre closer than ever to an #immigration compromise that will secure the future for #Dreamers &amp; leave our SW border more secure. That would certainly be cause for celebration.
Congratulations! https://t.co/tnBwSFtz3D
A lot of goodwill on the Hill today &amp; renewed motivation to reach bipartisan agreements on a budget &amp; #immigration. Over the coming weeks I'll continue working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in both chambers &amp; the Admin to deliver for the American people. #DACA
The commitment from @SenateMajLdr to bring a #DACA/border security compromise to the Senate Floor is a significant positive development.  https://t.co/cK5EC7aP1g

@Pontifex not sure if @realDonaldTrump is Christian or not but he's certainly unfit to serve as President of our country.
@realDonaldTrump &amp; @BernieSanders certainly have a lot in common - they'd both be very harmful to our country https://t.co/YNDcE3zTTQ

@KarlaMats congratulations on your success! Look forward to working with you as I did with @fedingram to support our educators @UTD_AFT1974
Will @POTUS visit to #Cuba legitimate its anti-American dictators or bolster pro-democracy opposition? I'm not optimistic.

Nice to see fellow Miamian and @belenjesuit grad @TomLlamasABC with immediate post #GOPDebate analysis on @ABC
Best closing statement @JebBush has delivered all season. Proud of his performance tonight. #allinforjeb #GOPDebate #NHPrimary
Didn't know #Peyton was supporting @JebBush. Now I know I'm supporting the right candidate! Go @Broncos! #GOPDebate #SB50
Great question about #millenials. My generation values the fair &amp; equal treatment of all people &amp; the dignity of EVERY human life #GOPDebate
@JebBush is right on the money on #veterans' care. It's a national embarrassment. Perfect example of government losing its mission &amp; its way
No. We should not torture or "waterboard" people. We shouldn't rush to empty GTMO either #GOPDebate
RT @BretBaier: OK-- this is @JebBush 's best debate by far.  Answers succinct and on the attack.
Can anyone watching with their kids seriously admit to them that they support @realDonaldTrump? My girls would be so disappointed #GOPDebate
@JebBush (leader, statesman) vs @realDonaldTrump (clown, bully). Clear as day #GOPDebate
