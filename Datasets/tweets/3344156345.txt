If it's true that Kanye has bipolar disorder &amp; isn't taking medication, then laughing at his meetings with Trump and his comments aren't helpful to him or anyone w/ mental illness at all. It tells us that any non "cute" symptoms are to be hidden. It keeps the stigma alive. (3/3)
Mental illness isn't pretty and if not treated can cause serious problems. The symptoms of untreated illness aren't reflective of a media portrayals of an insane asylum, it can be illogical thinking, outbursts, irritability, and inclusiveness. (2/?)
