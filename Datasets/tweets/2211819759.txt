@LuvsGoddess10 did you notice the two emojis of the bull symbol on each side of the statement, "I've got eyes on you." look like a pair of eyes looking at you? Just curious to know if you saw that without me saying so.
@LuvsGoddess10 I'm online with my laptop. I use the app on my phone.
@LuvsGoddess10 got it to do what I wanted and thanks. Go check the profile of mine to see what I was trying to do.
@BitOfJules go check my page now and see what I did.
@BitOfJules I'm using my laptop and I figure it out now. It's a matter of getting the html to use the space where I  wanted it. I can hit return and or spaces but until I put in the excl;amation points I couldn't move the second sentence where I wanted it.
@BitOfJules like I said I can find them fine in the tweet box but nothing happens in the edit profile. Also I tried to separate two lines of type to arrange the sentences the way I want to present them but nothing changes when I hit update.
@BitOfJules in my tweet/comment box I can find them by doing a word search "Taurus" but on edit profile when I press the emoji botton nothing happens
@LuvsGoddess10 ‚ôâÔ∏è well that works to post in a comment/tweet but it doesn't open the list of emojis on my edit profile screen
@BitOfJules I have tried to copy using keyboard commands and also right click on copy then paste. neither works
