We must make sure the help and services are there when survivors step forward to get out of their situations. In some cases, they have nowhere to go and no one to talk to. @shandraVoH @MentariUsa #SAAMHumanTrafficking https://t.co/hY5fH8QBqJ
We must look not just with our eyes but with our hearts to recognize victims of trafficking..they are among us. @shandraVoH #SAAMHumanTrafficking
Trafficking victims are everywhere. Labor trafficking even more than sex trafficking...in so many of our common products. We are surrounded by slavery...it‚Äôs up to all of us to make changes, starting even with small steps such as buying Fair Trade coffee. @shandraVoH
Sexual harassment and assault are not just workplace issues. Human trafficking is not a workplace, but must be considered within the #MeToo movement. @shandraVoH #SAAMHumanTrafficking
Healing is a process for survivors. It‚Äôs like a tattoo that you can‚Äôt take off. The pain is still inside. You must learn to cope. Telling your story can help. @shandraVoH #SAAMHumanTrafficking
@shandraVoH looked for help from authorities but got none. Homeless, alone, w/ poor English skills, and without food, she had only hope. Help finally came in the form of a Navy officer on vacation from Ohio, who called FBI to connect with local authorities. #SAAMHumanTrafficking
After many attempts to escape and living in hope, @shandraVoH used her Girl Scout skills and opened a bathroom window with a spoon, then jumped into the darkness and told those she had left behind that she would be back for them. #SAAMHumanTrafficking https://t.co/RIqQ3UXyWP
#HumanTrafficking is a hidden crime...hiding in plain signt. @shandraVoH was escorted at gun point in public places like casinos and advertised in newspapers. #SAAMHumanTrafficking https://t.co/71JWyssjhu
@shandraVoH grew up with ideal visions of the United States as the land of dreams and opportunities. Her arrival in the US for what she thought was a job opportunity instead became a nightmare of human sex trafficking. #SAAMHumanTrafficking

@EstinaBaker Labor is complicated. When MeToo movement emerged, we saw ways we could do better, including revamping CWA training and addressing the needs of women in non-traditional roles such as with safe spaces for reporting. #TimeIsNowActionCoalition #MeToo https://t.co/n5e4e6omou

@FirstLadyNJ It is not surprising that this is taking place in Bergen County where there is courage and conviction to model what needs to be done to end sexual harassment and assault. #TimeIsNowActionCoalition #MeToo https://t.co/gOlpryOzdB
@FirstLadyNJ Silver lining on national level is all of the women who have come forward and spoken out about sexual harassment and assault. #MeToo https://t.co/URP8cE2tQ5
#TimeIsNowActionCoalition Beyond Corporate HR Employers and employees must be clear on appropriate and inappropriate workplace behavior. Companies must create genuinely safe environments. #MeToo
#TimeIsNowActionCoalition We must bring the poor treatment of workers across industries at middle and lower levels into the light to ensure rights to safe workplaces for all people. #MeToo
#TimeIsNowActionCoalition We need to raise young people through all stages of development with age-appropriate education about healthy sexuality. #MeToo

Staff of elected officials also make sacrifices, but it‚Äôs for something much bigger than us. It‚Äôs for the benefit and strength of the community. We have to make Martin Luther King‚Äôs dream a reality. Marilyn Davis @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
Take care of yourself &amp; ask for help when you need it. It‚Äôs an intentional choice to take care of yourself &amp; not compromise on what‚Äôs most important. We‚Äôre anchors for community &amp; family. We have to take care of ourselves. @MsTaraDowdell @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
You have to really want it and be willing to work very hard. You have to have a good support group. Use your resources from your network, and also know when to take a moment.  @DeniseRidleyJC @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
A team to support your goals and dreams not only for your community but for your family and yourself is essential. The job of an elected official is about endurance. Having support and taking time are key. @shavondasumter @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
When you‚Äôre an elected official, you‚Äôre expected to be everywhere. It‚Äôs one of the challenges...making choices and trade-offs. NJ Sen Sandra Cunningham @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
You have to have a sister circle that gives you the feedback and support you need. It‚Äôs the foundation of our power as women. NJ Sen Nia Gill @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
Some men may think that just because they‚Äôre men, they can run for office even without authentic participation in their communities. Women who are community organizers have all the experience they need. @EstinaBaker @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
Women can be uncomfortable with our own power and also find it difficult to pat ourselves on the back. Find our common ground as women and embrace our power together. NJ Sen Sandra Cunningham @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
The world has called on women to come forward. And what we don‚Äôt know now, we‚Äôll learn as we go. Do we just want to influence the men who have the power, or do we want to have our own power and use it? NJ Sen Nia Gill @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
We don‚Äôt have to be empowered. We have to use our power and resources for the benefit of the whole. Accept the power and move with it. Don‚Äôt seek permission. NJ Sen Nia Gill @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
Good, old-fashioned grassroots relationships and responsiveness to constituents. We have to overcome institutionalized misogyny and racism, getting past notions like it‚Äôs not time for a woman or a woman of color. @MsTaraDowdell @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
We have to work to build bridges through our common human concerns, but t takes time. If you‚Äôre going to run for office, you have to start early. Constantly and consistently speak to the hearts of voters as people. @MsTaraDowdell @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
Shirley Chisholm: We must reject the stereotypes that others have of us but also those we have of ourselves.  @MsTaraDowdell @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
We have to find those issues and concerns that are common denominators, that affect all of us. That is the basis of support across people regardless of race and ethnicity. NJ Sen Nia Gill @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
You have to sit down and talk with people about how their vote can really affect their lives, not about the theoretical importance of voting. NJ Sen Sandra Cunningham @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
You must vote. Take the time to educate others about why voting is essential to protect your rights and resources. You can‚Äôt be too busy to vote. @shavondasumter @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
A community focus first is essential to build your base, name, and reputation. In the spirit of Shirley Chisholm, don‚Äôt wait to be asked, but you have to be organized and prepared. Marilyn Davis @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
In Ward A in Jersey City, there had never been an African American councilperson. It was important for me to run to have representation we have never seen. People were ready for that change and that energy. @DeniseRidleyJC @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
Field director to run operations and organize volunteers as well as communications director who can book your media interviews and appearances...more compelling than advertising. Social media must be employed. @MsTaraDowdell @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
Infrastructure must be in place to get elected. A strategic, creative team that will go to the mat for you. Campaign manager is absolutely key. Finance director responsible for fundraising is essential. @MsTaraDowdell @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC
Misconception: It takes money I don‚Äôt have. You can gather your resources and get the support you need. @shavondasumter @YWBergen @NCBW100BP #ShadesOfPoliticsBC

Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall @valerie_huttle: Today‚Äôs young people with their activism and energy such as has been demonstrated in the aftermath of the latest school shooting in Parkland are the ones who will change our culture. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: We talk about sexual assault and harassment as a woman‚Äôs issue because of the numbers, but it is an issue for all genders and all people. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Sexual harassment and propositioning. It‚Äôs not just about touch, but words, too. When you work for someone and they are offering you something to get something, you are being propositioned, and that‚Äôs harassment. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Men are selected to be trained and groomed while women are asked to stay for dinner to entertain a big account as a method for winning business. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: There need to be conversations like this in men‚Äôs organizations and among men. Everyone with young men in their lives can have a tremendous influence by modeling the right behavior. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: People are coming forward because they have others who are doing the same, and we are also looking at sexual violence through a new lens as a culture. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Maybe the older generation has the excuse of the workplace culture of their time, but in today‚Äôs workplace, that is no longer an excuse for unacceptable behavior. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: When you‚Äôre a young woman in a corp enviro, things happen &amp; you‚Äôre not sure what to do about it. Sometimes reporting is risky, incl to bosses and HR departments whose priority is protecting the company. Policy isn‚Äôt enough. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Working for a prominent org where boss sexualized a non-sexual experience in the workplace. Public apology seeking pardon was only a 2nd act of harassment. #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Teen Prevention Education Program in Tenafly schools on appropriate expressions of sexuality. High school students work with middle and other HS students. Peer to peer is a powerful way to help change culture.  #TimesUp #MeToo
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: The work of Coach Barry Harris with athletes and students in Englewood is a model for walking the walk and talking the talk. Men have to be part of the conversation. @YWBergenCEO #TimesUp #MeToo

Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall @NewBridgeMedCtr: Slut the Play helps teens open up and share their own experiences, then become peer leaders. Teens are much more powerful messengers to other kids and teens. @NCJWEssexNJ #MeToo #TimesUp
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall @NewBridgeMedCtr: Empowering production of Slut the Play by @NCJWEssexNJ demonstrated the need and importance of engaging teens in this conversation. We must talk with our children. #MeToo¬† #TimesUp

Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: While there has been progress, there is still so much work to do. It is still vital to advocate for funding for programs that support survivors of sexual violence.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: We‚Äôre not going to stop sexual violence if we only start to address it on college campuses. This education must begin with our smallest children, and continue through primary and secondary school years as well as among us in our families.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: People have a notion that survivors of sexual assault will present their stories in emotional ways. When they don‚Äôt, doubt is cast on their truthfulness, including by juries.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Some corporate women of older generations have viewed their harassment as a necessary evil that was just part of the arena and culture in male-dominated workplaces. Now there is a new lens and women are re-visiting their experiences.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Girls and women especially struggle with putting their own needs first. We must raise our girls ‚Äústrong.‚Äù Let girls know it‚Äôs ok to speak up and say what you need to say.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: If what is happening is uncomfortable, young people and all of us must know that we have to put our needs first, not the feelings or perceptions of the other person. It it doesn‚Äôt feel good to you, it‚Äôs not good for you.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: In a conversation about Weinstein, an ‚Äúevolved‚Äù person put the onus on survivors to have handled it differently at the time. We can‚Äôt put our notions of what we would‚Äôve done on survivors who deserve our support, not our blame.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Sexual harassment and assault are abuses of power. No survivor should be made to feel shame about what they must say or do, or if, when, and how they should come forward.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: As a 15yo restaurant worker, had a manager who would put his hands on you when your hands were full, and a cook who appointed himself to protect with a frying pan in hand to quietly do his part. We must all be empowered to do our parts.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Story of professor misusing class requirements to manipulate and entrap a young college student. Didn‚Äôt report at the time but shared years later informally with university personnel. Complex for young person just getting a sense of self.
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Stories of restaurant industry harassment. Groping, grabbing, inappropriate words by customers, coworkers. Boss w/ expectation of ‚Äúsexing up‚Äù what is offered to customers to improve biz. Why aren‚Äôt owners providing workers w/ safe enviros?
Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall: Goals are establish clearinghouse of resources, identify and close gaps, support employers to create safe workplaces that provide equal opportunity for all, encourage us all to do our part to help end sexual harassment and assault.
Our 1st Time Is Now Action Coalition Town Hall is underway. Coalition members @YWBergenCEO, Board Pres Maura DeNicola, Carol Loscalzo of Unitarian Society of Ridgewood Reproductive/Racial Justice Committees to get input from community on workplace sexual harassment + assault. https://t.co/eVVtDkn2EH

@CorethiaOatesMS: Supportive men are an important part of the conversation about equality. @bcpwn
Hollis Thomas: If you are a hiring manager and don‚Äôt choose to bring someone into your organization, let them know why. @bcpwn
Men...and women...in business don‚Äôt always want to hear what the woman of color has to say. Lowering your voice and smiling to soften the message are techniques women of color have had to use. Bosses and colleagues need to respect those perspectives and voices equally. @bcpwn
YWBergenCEO: Our Empower U Girls Leadership Academy brings diverse sophomore girls from across Bergen County together to learn and grow. Our #WENisNow and #WENatWork programs are 2 of our vibrant women‚Äôs empowerment initiatives. @bcpwn

@CorethiaOatesMS: Find smart collaborations. Read Smart Collaborations and Carla Harris‚Äô Strategize to Win. @bcpwn
Hollis Thomas: Before you leave today, introduce yourself to 3 people and connect. @Tanisha_R_Day: Build a relationship based on how we can benefit one another. Don‚Äùt hold information that you could share to benefit others. @bcpwn
Hollis Thomas: Recognition is #1. Those who are recognized will always go that extra mile. Recruit! Bring people to events and opportunities so they are genuinely included. And reward! @bcpwn
@Tanisha_R_Day: Your mentor doesn‚Äôt have to look like you. It‚Äôs about the quality of the relationship and guidance. We all need mentors no matter what level we‚Äôve achieved in our careers. @bcpwn
@Tanisha_R_Day: A mentor guides you in who you want to become. @bcpwn
@Tanisha_R_Day: We should start mentoring young women in middle school and continue through HS and college to build that confidence well before they reach the business world. @bcpwn

@CorethiaOatesMS: Bergen County Black Business Network was born out of the fact that there was no black business directory. Goal is to bring all Bergen County businesses together, including to take advantage of funding. @bcpwn
Hollis Thomas: All women need equal pay and equal opportunity. Extend opportunity to women of color by opening up and stepping out of your office to network and connect. @bcpwn
Hollis Thomas: Know your worth. Show your worth. Companies must also prove to you why you should work for them. @CorethiaOatesMS: Interview the interviewer. @bcpwn
@Tanisha_R_Day: As women, we still have to put our game faces on when we are in a room full of men. When we stand up for ourselves, we command respect. @bcpwn
@Tanisha_R_Day: If you know something or someone you can share to help another woman, share it! @bcpwn
@Tanisha_R_Day: Networking is essential for companies and job-seekers. Companies must be out there at diversity events and have open minds. @bcpwn
Hollis Thomas: Women leaders, embrace your responsibility to make change. @bcpwn
Hollis Thomas: The numbers on equal pay don‚Äôt lie. The fact is, women of color still need to work twice as hard for recognition and advancement. @bcpwn
@CorethiaOatesMS: You must take care of yourself. When you are healthy, wealthy, and wise, you‚Äôre in a position to help others. @bcpwn https://t.co/8Y2rGdYPEI

Tips for navigating holiday stress. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow https://t.co/pukuAjigCX
Focus on what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs right. Connect with what makes you feel joy. Create your own meaning. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Cultivating meaning...this time of year, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in images of holiday perfection. Turn outward toward giving...donating, volunteering...things that make you feel satisfaction and gratitude. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
To calm your mind, focus on your breath with the phrase: ‚ÄúI am breathing in, I am breathing out.‚Äù Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Breathe! Anna Sandbank #WENisNow https://t.co/OmAcHsSRwu
Set small goals. In caring for yourself, commit to going to the gym once a week (not every day) or to bed 15 minutes (not an hour) earlier, then feel success and slowly build on it. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
First hour of the morning, last hour of the day, and time on the weekend should be unplugged from technology. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Ask for help even when the need seems like it should be obvious to others. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow https://t.co/gdCYOyqxfv
We need to find those moments throughout our day to overcome barriers to taking care of ourselves. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow https://t.co/htdHeUoyyU
Detox from your technology. Take breaks from devices and communication. Don‚Äôt bookend your day with email or social media (where compare and despair can breed). Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Boundaries and choices...saying ‚ÄúNo, thank you‚Äù is essential. We need to differentiate between our needs and the needs and demands of others. Just because someone is asking doesn‚Äôt mean we have to say yes. We have choices. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Affirmations and mantras can help you take that pause and affirm yourself when you are having a moment. We are striving for progress, not perfection. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow https://t.co/qiexJqDMES
Acceptance is about acknowledging what is without fighting or resisting to change it. Instead of focusing on the negative, recognize the frustration or difficulty, and then shift to looking at what‚Äôs working. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Chandler Self, in first place, was staggering toward the finish of the Dallas Marathon when Ariana Luterman, a high school runner, stopped competing to help Self up several times down the stretch. https://t.co/7QbnQ8YXo8
Self-acceptance and self-compassion our key. Feeling overwhelmed is a universal experience. Cut yourself some slack! It‚Äôs ok to be imperfect. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Just three breaths is enough to quiet the body and mind. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
When you notice a new thought or sensation, let it float away like a leaf in a stream. Focus back on your breath. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow https://t.co/KGZ2o6oRRr
Try meditation and breathing exercises to center and focus. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow https://t.co/evASuetET4
Rather than increasing your intake of caffeine, sugar, and alcohol ‚Äúfor the holidays,‚Äù try self-care instead. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Self-care is exercise, healthy diet (what‚Äôs on our plates and also what isn‚Äôt), sleep!, hydration, relaxation, staying in the present. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Self-care is not something we do on special occasions. It should be part of every day. Anna Sandbank #WENisNow
Shift in energy around the holidays can permeate our lives. Practicing being present and focused is essential. Our brains don‚Äôt effectively multitask! Anna Sandbank #WENisNow https://t.co/5fP9U2ClF3

Compliment! Be sure to express gratitude and thanks to the other person. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Concern for the other person is key. Their satisfaction is equally important to you as your own. Compromise: both sides must get something they need. And if you choose to resolve by giving the other person his/her way entirely, don‚Äôt bring it up again. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Avoid the terms ‚Äúright‚Äù and ‚Äúwrong‚Äù unless you‚Äôre acknowledging that you were actually mistaken. Stick to the topic. Listen more than you speak. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Make eye contact. Observe your own and the other person‚Äôs body language. Speak in ‚ÄúI‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe‚Äù terms. Avoid ‚Äúalways‚Äù ‚Äúnever‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äù unless they‚Äôre used in a compliment. Play back what the other person says and make sure you understand it. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Always find the kindest, most thoughtful way to express yourself. It‚Äôs ok to disagree but not ok to be disagreeable. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
We need to listen with the intent to understand, not with the intent to respond. We need to really listen, including when what is said is unflattering to us. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow https://t.co/j8ddTZW2OI
There is polite honesty and brutal honesty. Polite honesty doesn‚Äôt mean sugar-coating. It means considering the other person‚Äôs feelings and choosing your words thoughtfully. We must also learn to listen without getting defensive. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Commit to commitment! And communicate! Both brain and heart must be used to ensure understanding and compassion. When you can feel where the other person is at, you can have empathy for their position. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Humor used appropriately can be an asset in resolving conflict. Make sure the situation allows it. Understand the other person‚Äôs style of humor and align your approach with that. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Approach the conversation with a rational mind, nota emotional one. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow https://t.co/WQqGqZfcAS
Make sure the timing is right for the other person when you want to have a discussion. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow https://t.co/m7NZ3rBZSQ
Maintain mutual respect for all parties and all opinions. There is never an excuse for being rude and disrespectful. Every person‚Äôs needs and feelings have purpose and value. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
If you‚Äôre pointing fingers at someone else, you‚Äôre not looking at yourself. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Attack the problem, not the person. ‚ÄúHow can you be so blind?!‚Äù Don‚Äôt engage in character assasination. Set reasonable and agreeable boundaries‚Äîthe rules and regulations of the relationship. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Politics and religion are sensitive issues. As long as neither person is trying to convince the other that his or her beliefs are wrong, you can have the discussion. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Are you a boxer or a brief? Assess your communication style. If you‚Äôre a boxer who wants to drag things out, why is that? If you‚Äôre a brief, are you trying to resolve conflict without working it through? @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
7 key strategies can reduce the time and effort it takes to resolve conflicts. 10-year rule: if you won‚Äôt remember it in 10 years, it‚Äôs not worth arguing about. Pay attention to the attitude and approach you use. Be solution-oriented. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow
Conflict is not arguing and fighting. Conflict is about different ideas and is an opportunity to see things from a different perspective. @JanetPfeiffer1 #WENisNow https://t.co/6DLdHHhlXA
