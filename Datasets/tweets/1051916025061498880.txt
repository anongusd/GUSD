@comey: death by a heart attack takes 7-10 days in comparison to death by suffocation. If I sleep five hours for the 2nd day in a row, then the beast by the sea should begin to be shut down starting on Jan 3/19. Add 7-10 days for the switch karma to take effect.
@comey: Archangel Michael and his angels are supposed to pull together the team soon after I am contacted. But first, we need to get uncorrupted messages via deep hypnosis from Above which will guide all of our actions. So nothing is for certain until proper guidance from Above.
@comey: If beast fails to die, I should still be contacted but I am taking things day by day. I finally was able to get 5 hours of sleep but still am sick.		Jan 3/19 = July 31/16. We are following this template to guide our actions. Beast's time on earth should be short.
@Comey: The beast out of the sea might die ~ mid-Jan/19 because the beast wants Trump to die but Above will switch the karma around. The beast wants to collude with Pence since Trump didn't follow through with his side of the quid pro quo. If beast dies, I will be contacted.

Trump, the Coward-in-Chief, refuses to visit our brave troops overseas. Instead, the Coward-in-Chief prefers to spend time at his golf courses. What a hypocrite. He said he cherishes our military but the truth is that he's just using our troops to get elected.
Trump is a cop-out and a wimp and refuses to stand up to MBS over the gruesome murder of Khashoggi. American moral leadership died on November 8, 2016. I hope the Democrats in the House try to make up for the lack of leadership from the Republicans.

Every vote cast in Florida should be counted during the recount.
Matthew Whitaker has a serious conflict of interest regarding the Mueller probe. He should either quit or recuse himself and let Rod Rosenstein take over.  Whitaker has not been properly confirmed by the Senate.
@Comey: The Dragon (Rev 12) died Nov 25/16. It would not be surprising if the beast died around the same time frame in 2018 (ie: a few weeks after the election). Karma might be recycled for a pre-determined outcome.
@Comey: There is a chance that Putin might die in the next few weeks (Rev 13:5). Putin's reign began when Trump announced his candidacy, ~ 42 months ago. Trump is a puppet for Putin.		If the beast from the sea dies in the next few weeks, two angels are supposed to visit upon me.

Those Republicans who are clinging to Trump in order to win an election or re-election will probably regret it by November 7. I think there's a chance that the Democrats will pull off enough tight wins in the Senate and the House to win majorities in each chamber.
Twitter should follow CNN's example and freeze Trump's openly racist tweets. Trump's account should be halted. Trump has blood on his hands in the wake of the Pittsburgh massacre. Twitter needs to hold Trump accountable. Hate speech is not covered under the First Amendment.
A vote for Tim Scott is a vote for Trump. Don't be fooled, don't put your trust in Tim Scott. If you are from Peutro Rico and living in Florida, the only sane choice is @NelsonForSenate.
If you don't want another Pittsburgh massacre to happen, we need to begin shutting down the Republican party, starting in 2018 and continuing to 2020. The Republican party is now the party of Trump and we have to wipe it off the face of the earth.
Anyone who feels played by Trump or conned by Trump needs to get out and vote against Trump. We need to vote for the Democrats to restore some honesty back into politics. If you can't bring yourself to vote for the Democrats then you should just stay home.

As long as Trump and his sycophants remain in power, these horrible shootings will continue. We must reject a hatemongering president who incites violence. We need to hold politicians accountable for their part in terms of inciting violence. Another Pittsburgh is coming. https://t.co/g0vUQlKle9

We need all politicians to agree that climate change and pollution are real and existential threats to our planet and way of life. We can't afford to have climate deniers in charge of our government. We must all push back and vote on November 6. https://t.co/hvhImhWfZj
Everyone who is sick of Trump and Cruz has to go out and vote blue. We can't afford another two years of Trump destroying our country with impunity. https://t.co/XKSJqGs6hZ
I'm so happy that you turned blue. I hope others follow your excellent and intelligent and moral example. Good for you. https://t.co/Tht4xMQSO4
This is exactly how I feel. Worse yet, Trump is going to send 15K troops to the border to kill off as many immigrants as they can. The bloodshed has only begun. More is coming. https://t.co/Yr12Cllcs9
I am so happy that some Republicans are doing the right thing. Let's hope more Republicans vote blue this midterm. Good for him. https://t.co/cC2eeQ3c7p

It's much worse than a political stunt. IMO, I think Trump wants the troops to open fire &amp; massacre the entire caravan in order to send a "strong" message to all prospective refugees. He's THAT EVIL. But America will prevail. Let's begin taking back control from Trump by voting. https://t.co/7tA0vqU6Md

If you can't do the right thing &amp; vote for the Dems, you should stay home &amp; skip the midterms. We don't need another Pittsburgh massacre, which is a direct result of Trump's horrible racist xenophobic tropes and tweets. By not voting for Trump, you are doing our country a favor.
Trump has blood on his hands from the Pittsburgh shooting and from all of the crazies and dictators he inspires around the world. Our country lost its soul the day Trump was elected. Let's get back part of our soul if a #BlueWave allows the Democrats to take over both chambers. https://t.co/Rfd6EFKtDZ

Trump's invasion of American politics proves that half of our country is deplorable. They are simply being used for Trump's political and financial gain. How stupid can one get?
Everyone who supports Trump and the party of Trump are moral failures. I have dumped all of my friends/associates who support Trump. Anyone who supports Trump is supporting a version of the KKK.
It is obvious that the "good old days" from Trump's perspective is for our country rollback our civil rights and we go back to segratation &amp; slavery. That's why he appeals to the right-wing extremists like David Duke. He's making America hate again. We need to stand up and vote.
After two years of hell from Trump, we can't withstand another two years of the same or worse. We need politicians who understand the law and follow the law and not treat our country and our history with such animosity. We deserve better and we need to get out to vote for change.
Trump is making our society violent, chaotic, lawless. It is exactly the opposite of what he promised. We can't heal as a nation until our elected leaders stop all of the demagoguery. Let's be great once again; let's embrace our neighbours and stop all of the hate mongering.
There's no doubt that Trump colluded with the Russians in 2016. If he hadn't he would not have won the presidency. Let's go out and vote en masse in order to overcome further Russian interference in 2018. We need to take back control over our elections from the Russians.
In the wake of the tragedy in Pittsburgh, my Jewish friend's car was vandalized with swastikas &amp; slashed tires. Trump's hate-filled rhetoric is making our country unsafe for everyone. No doubt the 60% rise in anti-Semitism from last year is a direct result of Trump inciting hate.

The pipe bomber &amp; Pittsburgh's mass murderer should ask Trump for pardons because that's what Trump is good at. We don't have a law and order president. We have a hostile invasion of right-wing extremist who took over Capital Hill. It is time we push back now &amp; for years to come.
The so-called caravan is not a threat to our country. The real threat is the alt-right extreme right-wing and their leader, @realDonaldTrump. Most of the hate crimes committed in 2017/18 were from white right-wing extremists excited and incited by Trump's racist rhetoric.
It is so embarassing being an American right now because half of our population got suckered by a conman, Donald Trump. How many years will it take for the damage Trump has inflicted upon our country to be fixed? The Dems have to continue to appeal to the better half our country.
The good people of Pittsburgh came together after a mass tragedy and rejected Trump, the Devil. How come Trump's Evangelical base can't do the same thing and see Trump for who he really is? How many more people must die before Trump's Evangelical base begin to reject Trump?
I'm holding my breath, waiting for the next extreme right-wing Trump-inspired crazy to kill off more innocent people. This is not the kind of America we should live in. We need to follow Gospel and love our neighbours. Trump is turning our country into a killing field.
I am sick of Trump's hatemongering. Let's vote in Democrat majorities in both the Senate and House in order to hold back Trump's evil agenda.
I want law and order, not lawlessness and chaos.		Trump can't even run his own administration; how the hell can he run an entire country? He's proven himself to be the worst leader in the history of presidents. That's why the good people of Pittsburgh rejected Trump.

Words matter. Voting matters even more. Us millennials need to vote this midterm and begin to get rid of Trump's hatemongering. Our future is being robbed by a bunch of old fat white supremacists who don't give a shit about green jobs, the environment, or about our republic.
Trump &amp; his henchmen have invaded Capitol Hill. We need to take back control over our political system &amp; get rid of those who lack American values: respect for our constitution &amp; the First Amendment; welcoming the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
Instead of Trump offering to pay the legal bills for his base who beat up anti-Trump protestors, he should pay the medical bills for those who were injured in the latest mass shooting in Pittsburgh.		Trump has zero empathy and compassion for the victims. He incited the hate.
Trump's visit to Pittsburgh today is just another political photo op. He doesn't give a shit that 11 people died. If he did care, he'd turn a new leaf and stop inciting his rabid base at his rallies and with his tweets. Total hypocrite. What a scam.
Trump shouldn't visit Pittsburgh because he's got blood on his hands. The massacre is his fault.
All farmers and small businesses negatively impacted by Trump's trade wars need to vote for the Democrats this midterm so that we can peel back Trump's regressive trade policies.
No one is safe in our country as long as Trump, the Devil, and his band of sycophants are in power. We need to vote and take back our country from crazies because any one of us could be next.
Trump stirs up the crazies in our society. So far, black people, political enemies, the press, &amp; a religious minority have been the targets. But ANYONE could be at the wrong place at the wrong time and even white school children could die because of Trump's pandering to crazies.
All Evangelicals who support Trump must ask themselves at what cost? Trump is to blame for inciting violence and bloodshed in this country. He has blood on his hands but so do his fervent supporters. Do Evangelicals want to continue to support a person who incites mass murderers?
Pittsburg needs to reject Trump's visit. Trump is the one who incited the shooter and he's morally responsible but he refuses to take responsibility for his actions.		Trump is just using his visit tomorrow for craven political gain. Trump does not give a shit that 11 people died.
Trump wants to make the midterms about Kavanaugh and caravans. Don't let him off the hook; keep blaming Trump for the recent series of shootings and bombs. Keep the pressure on Trump to force him to admit his role in inciting the violence and massacres.

Trump promised our country would become lawful &amp; safe. Total hypocrisy and total fucking bullshit. Crimes against minorities have greatly increased during his presidency and the #MeToo movement has an uphill battle against a sexist and misogynistic POTUS. Our country is lawless.
Many of my Jewish friends are afraid because they are worried they might be targeted next time. There is no safe place if you are black, gay, Jewish, an immigrant, a person of color, because Trump's hoodlums will come after you no matter where you live.America has become lawless.
Trump tries to deflect the blame for this past week of violence &amp;  hate by blaming the media. What a fucking lowlife &amp; fucking coward. Since he can't take responsiblity for the blood on his hands, we need to vote vote vote for the Dems during the midterms to send a clear message.
If you are a life-long Republican but not a Trump supporter, you must do the right thing &amp; vote Democrat this time around. This is the only way to begin putting an end to the recent bloodshed; surely, more domestic terrorism will follow as long as Trump is POTUS.#TakeBackCongress
Many grass-roots Republicans reluctantly voted for Trump in 2016. After a chaotic &amp; divisive 2-year presidency, our country has reached a new moral low bar because Trump refuses to take any responsibility for his incitement of domestic terror. Trump has blood on his hands. 🔫💣
Trump's platform of law and order now includes pipe bombs and massacre. If you support Trump and his radical right-wing party, you are endorsing more hate crimes and mass murders to take place in our once beautiful country. We all need to stand up and #TakeBackAmericiaAgain.
Evangelicals who love their Jewish friends should do the right thing &amp; call out Trump for his hatemongering. Trump incites violence amongst his base &amp; amongst haters.Evangelicals need to stand up against Trump's divisive rhetoric &amp; vote for the Democrats to show their disapproval
Tree of Life Synagogue should reject Trump's wish to visit Pittsburg because Trump's divisive rhetoric is the CAUSE for the latest series of domestic terrorist events.
@IvankaTrump: You are 100% a FAKE JEW. If you were a real Jew, you'd dump your father over his racist rants and dog-whistle politics. Your father's embrace of the extreme alt-right pro-white anti-Semitic and despicable portion of the American population should make you reject him
If Trump was truly against anti-Semitism, he'd stop promoting racist dog whistles against immigrants &amp; people of color.Hate is hate, no matter which minority group the hate is targeted towards.Trump's empty words of unification are too late; he can't bring back the dead.Hypocrite
If I was Trump, I would tell Trump and his family to go back to their shithole countries like Slovenia and Germany. They don't belong in America because they can't adopt American values of inclusiveness and support the First Amendment.
If Trump has problems disavowing David Duke, Trump will also have problems disavowing anti-Semitism. Just because his Ivanka and Jared are Jewish does not give cover to Trump's open racism against ALL racial and religious minorities. Trump uses his children for political gains.
If Trump doesn't have something nice to say then he should just shut up and stop stirring up his base of crazies. More mass killings are sure to follow in the coming days/weeks/months. All of these mass killings are preventable if Trump stops pushing out so much hateful rhetoric.
Anyone of us could suddenly be murdered if we happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and come into the crosshairs of a crazy Trump supporter. We don't need more guns; we need Trump to step down as the POTUS and to shut up and to stop promulgating hate every day.
I wish that Trump supporters would wake up from their deep slumber and open their eyes to what is transpiring in America: innocent people are being shot and bombs being sent to them because Trump keeps dangerously inciting violence. Enough is enough. How many more must die?
Trump is a political terrorist. He needs to be stopped before even more people die because of his hateful rhetoric. We need to go out and vote en masse for a Democratic Congress. Let's take back our country from Trump. Trump is pure evil in the same way Hitler was.
Trump traffics in anti-Semitic tropes &amp; is responsible for the large increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes since he became POTUS. His GOP sycophants don't push back against Trump because they are afraid of his rabid base. What we need in this country is a Democratic Congress.
Trump routinely sent out anti-Semitic dog whistles during his campaign. He is morally responsible for the latest string of hate crimes. He has no credibility when he says he's against anti-Semitism. A large portion of his base is anti-Semitic. Trump is the biggest hypocrite ever.

I'll join you in voting for leaders who will care about our entire country and not just about their rabid and deranged base who cannot see right from wrong. https://t.co/oqThXbQ3AH
Trump is morally responsible for these hate-filled crimes. He hates black people, Democrats, and those who support immigrants/refugees.		https://t.co/DRBaqS3qfZ
The synagogue shoot is anti-immigration &amp; anti-refugee. Even though he was not an outright supporter of Trump, he agreed with many of Trump's racist policies. Trump encourages hateful bigots like the shooter today to become violent because Trump encourages violence at his rallies
“I thank God no one’s been hurt, and I thank the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us,” he said. “There’s something more powerful than bombs, and that’s your vote. People must vote!”		https://t.co/cAR0FdCf1P
Trump is so full of shit. If he truly wants to stop the recent violence in our country, he'd do the right thing and quit. Short of that, we might be able to begin impeachment against him if enough concerned citizens vote during the midterms. #BlueTsunami2018
Trump likes to scapegoat people of color as murderers and rapists. The real threat is coming from angry white men who are incited by Trump's dog-whistle politics and who go on to act upon their violent impulses. Every middle-aged Republican white guy could be the next shooter.
It's not possible for this country to unite as long as Trump is the POTUS. Trump is turning his 40 million supporters into domestic terrorists. At any moment, one of them can pop off and the next thing you know is that there's another mass domestic terrorist event in our country.
Posting armed security guards at places of worship is not the answer. We need alt-right racist bigots like Trump to shut the fuck up and to step down. Trump and his sycophants need to get booted out of power. #BlueWave2018 #BlueWave2020
Who cares if our economy is doing well when any one of us on the left could be the target of one of Trump's alt-right crazies? The only way to take back our country from Trump's crazies run amuck is to vote in 2018 and 2020. #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
I quietly dumped all of my friends who support Trump because I can't trust them. At any moment, 1 of them might take umbrage at my support of the Democratic party and come after me with a gun. I don't want to die like what happened today at the synagogue. Make America Safe Again.
Trump needs to shut the fuck up in order to make America safe again.		I hope Trump, the Devil, dies soon so that our country can return back to some semblance of normality.
If Pence, the hypocrite, truly wants to end the evil of anti-Semitism, he should stop supporting the racist &amp; bigotted Trump. Evil comes down from the top. I pray that God terminates Trump ASAP so that the hate in our country can stop being promulgated from the top. I hate Pence. https://t.co/Md0FBfRC6O

Our country would be A LOT safer if @realDonaldTrump stops trying to punch up and bodyslam reporters. Trump's hatred of the First Amendment spills over into the larger community and haters who will always hate now have the president on their side, a POTUS who promulgates hate.
We need common sense gun control in this country. What we DON'T need is Trump and his NRA henchmen supporting arming our entire country. We need to get rid of the Republican party from power. We need to bring back some sanity to our country and it starts at the top.
I don't know how to swear in Hebrew but in English, I wish Trump would go fuck himself. We don't need him. We need him to quit stirring up his crazies.		Everyone who cares about our country returning back to a civilized state must go out and vote during the midterms.#BlueWave2018
If Trump truly cared about the people who died in today's massacre, he'd tone down his rhetoric but he won't because we are so close to the midterms.		It is so damn obvious that Trump is going to rot in Hell. Trump didn't pull the trigger but he's still responsible.
Ivanka &amp; Jared are FAKE Jews because they both support @realDonaldTrump and his openly racist bigoted xenophobic agenda. @realDonaldTrump panders to the alt-right &amp; is the person who has incited all sorts of domestic acts of terrorist beyond the pipe bomber and today's massacre.
Our country will never be a safe place to live until Trump &amp; his sychophants are voted out of power (or impeached). We all must vote during the midterms and support our Democratic party, up and down the ballot, if we want to return back to a safe America. Make America safe again.
Trump &amp; his henchmen keep propagating conspiracy theories which in turn keeps inciting violence.		Our country will continue to descend into violence until Trump is impeached. I hope God answers my prayers and terminates Trump in order to stop the hate coming from the fount head.
Horrific acts of domestic terrorism will only continue as long as Trump is our POTUS &amp; as long as the GOPs refuse to provide ANY check and balance against the POTUS. Trump is making our country EXTREMELY dangersous--not just for prominent Democrats but for the ordinary person.
The Anti-Defamation League reports increased anti-Semitic attacks skyrocketed since 2016--when Trump began to run for president &amp; since he became President. Today's massacre is to be EXPECTED as a direct result of Trump's racist bigotry and hateful xenophobia. TRUMP IS TO BLAME.
If Ivanka truly cared about anti-semitism, she would tell her father to stop stoking up the racist crazies who comprise Trump's base. Ivanka has no morals or principles no matter what her religion is. She just cares about grabbing power so that she can use that for personal gain.
Trump has to tone down his rhetoric in order to stop inciting more domestic terrorists from acting on their hate-filled crimes. Trump needs to take responsibility for his hate-filled speeches. We need LEADERSHIP in this country right now; Trump shouldn't deflect the blame.
Today's shooter at the synagogue is anti-refugee. Even though the shooter is not directly a Trump supporter, he hates in the same way that Trump hates immigrants and refugees. Therefore, Trump's rhetoric has incited another domestic terrorist event beside the pipe bomber.
All hate crimes committed in this country are inspired by Trump's racist rhetoric regardless if the hater is a Trump supporter or not.
I wouldn't be surprised if this latest mass shooting at a synagogue was by 1 of Trump's crazies incited by his hate-filled speech. Trump is making a dangerous situation even more dangerous; making our country dangerous. We need to take away Trump's bully pulpit and impeach Trump.
Trump keeps pumping up his crazy and racist supporters. Not surprising that someone massacred a bunch of innocent people at the synagogue today. Expect more hate crimes as long as Trump is president and as long as he keeps spewing out hateful rhetoric.		https://t.co/pN5cohJ8ob
ISIS, if you're listening, please protect our country by blowing up Trump.
All those who voted for Trump in 2016 have to take some of the blame for the recent domestic terrorism involving pipe bombs. Trump should have never become president if his supporters didn't consciously overlook his obvious and serious ethical and personality flaws.
We have to do everything we can to take away political power from Trump, a terrorist. That's why we need to vote en masse in the midterms as the first step to removing political power from the biggest domestic terrorist in our country, aka President Trump. #TrumpTerrorist
Trump is a national security threat because he continues to incite his rabid supporters to physically harm their critics. I hope the next assassin points his gun to Trump's head in order to make our country safe again; or, I hope the Dems take back Congress &amp; begin impeachment.
Maybe I should not use my real name and real picture in case a crazy Trump fan decides to pump a few bullets into my head. But I have decided to use my real name and photo because I cannot cower to fear. I will continue to exercise my First Amendment rights &amp; will critique Trump.
Anyone who continues to support Trump is supporting pure evil. Another mass assassination attempt is just around the corner when another crazy Trump fan decides to pop off at Trump's critics. Morally, if you support Trump, you are essentially an accessory to murder. Trump is ISIS
We can't get rid of our crazy neighbours who support Trump but we can get out and vote during the midterms to get rid of the crazy Republicans from Congress.
A typical Trump supporter:		- 400 pounds	- lives with parents or got kicked out from his parent's house	- makes bombs as a hobby	- has no life; is a total loser	- is dangerous to the public	- attends Trump rallies and hates the MSM	- is too stupid to think for himself
In another time and place, Trump would be the leader of ISIS. The only reason why he doesn't lock up and kill off political opponents like what Putin does is because for now, America is a country of laws. We need to get rid of Trump and his henchmen before someone dies.
Trump is soft on terror because he leads the nation's largest terrorist network: the Republican party.		If you support Trump, you are supporting a domestic terrorist. Forget about the border and building walls; arrest the POTUS at the Oval Office.
Let me guess:  Trump will pardon the bomber who was caught today.
Typical Trump supporter:		-white	-male	-over 40	-domestic terrorist
Our country is not safe until we have the Democrats control both chambers of Congress. Then, we can impeach Trump, who is America's most powerful domestic terrorist. More assassination plots will undoubtedly transpire as long as Trump is the POTUS and the GOPs control Congress.
The only way for us progressives to remain safe from pipe bombs is to get out and vote in 2018 to remove as many of Trump's sychophants as possible from office. The Dems need to take back control and install sanity back into the political process. GOPs won't stand up to Trump.
@realDonaldTrump: You have shown no leadership because you keep inciting violence with your hate-filled rhetoric. You are the country's number one domestic terrorist. You should be ashamed of yourself because you keep pandering and inciting your rabid and extremist base.
@realDonaldTrump: You &amp; your supporters are totally despicable because you are hypocrites and you keep inspiring your supporters to commit acts of violence against the Democrats. You should be charged as an accessory to the bombings. In your heart you wish those targeted to die.
@realDonaldTrump:  stop copping out and blaming the media when you are the one who is responsible for the domestic terrorism. You can't win the midterms and 2020 if you don't act like a true leader and shoulder the blame.
Trump only provides security for Republicans. For the rest of us, he doesn't give a shit if we are attacked by his demented supporters. That's why our is not safe for 60% of the population who does not support Trump.
Our country has been divided into two: the dangerous crazies who support Evil Trump and the rest of us who cares about our country and about our democracy.		If someone gets hurt, it is 100% Trump's fault. He is the one who inspires domestic terrorists.
Trump is soft on terror. He has zero leadership skills and offers zero moral leadership. Leadership means offering comfort and reassurance; leadership is not blaming the victim for these acts of domestic terrorism.		Obviously, the bomber is a zealous Trump supporter.
Real News:  Trump has absolutely zero leadership skills during a crisis.		Fake News:  Trump is our duly elected president.
Domestic terrorism and hate crimes are way up because of Trump's hateful rhetoric. Our country is fast descending into a 3rd-rate autocratic state. We need people like Obama to help make America great once again.
Trump was supposed to be the get tough on crime POTUS. Instead, he doesn't care that Khashoggi is assassinated by MSB or that a domestic terrorist is sending out many pipebombs. Our country is becoming MORE violent, not less violent and Trump does everything he can to stoke hate.
As a Democrat, I don't feel safe and am worried some crazy Trump supporter might attack me. The only way I'll feel safe is to vote out as many Republicans in Congress in 2018 and vote against Trump in 2020. I might move to Canada; at least they have a real democracy there.
Today was a test of Trump's leadership. Needless to say, Trump failed miserably and he continues to divide us and to inspire the crazies. Trump is totally Fake News and Trump is the one who's morally responsible for these acts of domestic terrorism. Trump is the Fake President.
Are you sick and tired of all the shit coming from Trump's mouth? He could have done the right thing &amp; owned up to his part in inspiriting acts of domestic terrorism but of course, he wimped out &amp; blames the media and us angry Democrats. Yes, we are angry and we're going to vote.
No matter how much a citizen might hate a Democrat's policies, at least the Democrats are not running a terrorist plot attacking their political foes. There is a straight line running from whoever sent out the bombs to the POTUS. We all know that Trump is morally responsible.
I am mad as hell. How dare Trump blame the media for the terrorist attacks today. We all need to go vote vote vote and bring back the Democrats to power. We need to bring back sanity into our government. We need Senators and Congressmen who can stand up against Trump, the Devil.
If the Dow Jones breaks support at 23,200, the next support level will be around 20,500. This is a good time to take profits and wait for the approaching bear market to run its course.
"According to data analyzed by Reuters, the proportion of stocks, regions and sectors that are technically in a bear market has shot up since the start of January, prompting some analysts to conclude the bull run may already be over."		https://t.co/orbZOT4qrk
Trump is privately hoping that the bomber succeeds. Trump wishes that everyone on the bomber's list would die.
The bomber who sent out the packages listens to Trump. If Trump continues to dial up the divisive rhetoric during his rallies and tweets, Trump will just encourage the bomber to try to murder again. Trump needs to dial back and stop his hate-filled speeches. What a hypocrite.
Us on the left need to take back our country and vote against the Republicans and Trump. Get rid of the domestic terrorists.		As long as the Republicans are in power, we can expect more domestic terrorism and more pipe bombs being mailed out.
Trump and his sycophants cannot protect Americans; instead, they act like terrorists and encourage violence against us. If we care about our own security, we need to vote out of office all GOPs in 2018 and 2020.		Trump is the world's worst hypocrite. We need to fire the GOPs.
Trump should be charged with domestic terrorism. He's the one who inspired his bunch of crazies to send out bombs to Trump's enemies. Trump is a political terrorist &amp;inspires violence against his enemies. Same as him trying to inspried the Second Amendment people to kill Clinton.
Trump keeps sending out his band of crazies to commit acts of violence. Trump should be charged as an accessory to the crimes.		https://t.co/9GnBhSVPr5
Trump is morally responsible for this violence. He keeps pumping up his rabid base and prompting them to act violently. This is Trump's fault -- he keeps sending out his violent mob like what happened in Charlottesville. #Cult45 https://t.co/4KLnFu8Fg7

Jesus spoke in parables because he wanted his disciples to think for themselves. Trump, on the other hand, constantly lies &amp; deceives his supporters &amp; wants to shut down their cognitive abilities and demands 100% BLIND loyalty. This is a sign of a false prophet. Don't be fooled!

Trump is MBS's puppet and will do anything for the Saudis for money. The Saudis are inside Trump's pockets. This is why we must demand greater transparency and see for ourselves the transactions between our corrupt President and the Saudis.		It's all about the money. https://t.co/kdQPf2fIsX
Jesus tried to promote equal rights between men and women. But he did not succeed because the Church is one of the most sexist organizations in the world. It is not surprising that Evangelicals flock to see and hear that sexist and misogynistic Trump speak at rallies. VERY SAD!😭
I ask every Evangelical who voted for Trump: what's the point of Jesus dying for our sins if you are too stupid to separate fact from fiction and continue to support a false prophet like Trump? The Bible teaches us to think for ourselves and warns us to be wary of false prophets.
Jesus never preached against homosexuality. It is a misinterpretation of the New Testament to believe that God condemns homosexuality. God sent down Jesus to update the Old Testament with new, more encompassing values such as women's rights and gay rights.
If Jesus was alive today, he'd help the immigrants crossing at the border out of compassion. The LAST thing he'd do is to rip apart families fleeing violence. How can Evangelicals support Trump's immigration policies of ripping apart innocent families at the border?
Matthew 7:13-14: Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.		Trump's supporters entered the wide gate.
In his time, Jesus was a progressive "leftwing" advocate and he tried to advance human rights as much as he could. Trump is totally against human rights--how the hell can so-called Evangelicals support and vote for a conman like Trump? It is obvious that they've sold their souls.
Jesus challenged the money changers at the Temple because he saw how corrupt they were. If Jesus was alive today, he'd challenge the corrupt Trump administration &amp; would try to drain the swamp, not add to the swamp like Trump. Jesus would ask Trump to give up his entire fortune.
Jesus &amp; his parents were "immigrated" to Egypt when he was a small child to escape the persecution of King Herod.If Jesus was alive today, he'd be against Trump's racist immigration policies. He'd be in Mexico trying to help the caravan of immigrants find a safer life in the USA.
Jesus taught us to love thy neighbour. He didn't teach us to be racists. For this reason alone, Evangelicals cannot support Trump and be good Christians at the same time. All Evangelicals supporting Trump, the Devil, will fry in hell.
Trump would only care about climate change if his lousy fifth-rate money-losing golf courses are impacted.		He's old and won't live much longer and has no plan for future generations. 		Shame on Ivanka and Jared for letting Trump destroy the world for our future generations. https://t.co/9ncStsLhzP

If you are a true Republican Conservative &amp; don't like Trump, you should stay home this midterm and not bother to support a party which has been hijacked by Trump (who is the Devil, a false prophet). Trump is just using your vote to enrich his family's bottom line. He's corrupt.

Obama created a lot more jobs than Trump &amp; he didn't have to give into the lobbyist to do it. Dems are job creators because we believe in a GREEN ECONOMY and GLOBAL TRADE. Whereas Trump inherited a booming economy courtesy of Obama. THE ECONOMY WOULD BE EVEN BETTER WITHOUT TRUMP.
I am proud to be a member of the "democratic mob" who goes around organizing and protesting against people who are trying to ruin our democracy because they have an axe to grind. I say, let the mob rule in 2018. #BlueWaveComing2018
How do we explain to our children all of the horrible sexist, racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, homophobic, bullying criticisms which Trump tweets out every single day? Short of Trump dying of heart attack, we need to get out and vote this midterm and for 2020 for the Democrats.
Anyone who votes for the GOPs this midterm will be condemned by God on Judgment Day. It is so incredibly obvious that Trump is the Devil and appeals to the dark angels in us in order for him to con his way into power. Everyone needs to get out and vote and keep our democracy.
The so-called "angry mob of Democrats" need to make sure we get as many of our friends, family, associates out to vote. #BlueWaveComing2018. If you drive, offer to give some a lift to their local voting booth. We have to show up in large numbers for our democracy to work.
Even though I am feeling sick and am feeling tired all the time, I still find the energy to knock on people's doors and volunteer to phone people because I can't stand another two more years of retarded craziness from Trump; we need to empower Congress with Democratic majorities.
All Democrats need to make sure they get off their ass and go volunteer for their local Democratic nominees. This is a turnout election if we're going to have any hope of taking back control over both chambers of Congress so that we can bring some sanity back to our politics.
The Russians are highjacking our elections once again and Trump is doing zippo about it because he knows that he can't win at the midterms unless Putin screws around with our democracy. It is so damn sad that Trump is Putin's puppet. Let's get rid of Trump via impeachment.
I've never hated someone so much as I hate that F****** shitface called Trump who, with the help of the Russians, conned his way into the Oval Office. I really want to punch him in the head and see how he feels like. I bet he'll cry like a big baby. He's not a man; he's a mouse.
Trump is the real enemy of the people. I really wish that he'd just drop dead and do the world a big favor. Short of this, let's get out and vote vote vote.
I am so damn mad as hell and want real change, not the bogus bullshit offered by Trump and his cronies. I will vote for all of the Dems listed on my ballot this midterm. Go #BlueWaveComing2018 go!

Trump mercilessly rips apart small children from their parents at the border but Trump is a total patsy to Putin, Kim Jong Un, the Saudis etc. What kind of man terrorizes children but can't stand up to dictators? This proves that Trump is a total wimp who picks on children.
All Latinos need to get out and vote; let's get rid of Trump's racist supporters.
Many of Trump's supporters acknowledge that Trump is evil and yet, for purely financial reasons, they continue to rally for him. These people have sold their souls to the Devil, Trump, and when Judgment Day comes, God will judge against Trump's supporters.
It is so damn obvious that wimpy Trump is being manipulated by the Saudis.		Trump's original sin is not releasing his tax returns. He's the most corrupt president in the history of our republic.
Latinos need to turn out in droves and vote against Trump's Republicans for the midterms. #BlueTsunami2018 		Splitting up families at the border is not an immigration policy; it is designed to appeal to Trump's racist supporters.
