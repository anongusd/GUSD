ELL lessons: how have u adapted? #RJUSDbtsa
A:7 focus, fluency, deep U. are easier, don't require as many stakeholders. We have done cross-grade before, doable.  #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell gamation and journaling for sure #RJUSDchat
@gedgecomb I agree #RJUSDchat
A:6 fits well with the others logical progression. Tough! #RJUSDchat
A:5 application is essential to prove knowledge has moved to higher blooms #RJUSDchat
@gedgecomb @jeffpercell how do we channel motivation so they want to be independent thinkers? How do we honor their ideas?
@gedgecomb @jeffpercell yes, they just sit there or beg me to give them the answer #RJUSDchat
A:4 breathing room. Acknowledgment that internalization is a must #RJUSDchat
@gedgecomb yes. And come in behind, some light years due to out of district, absenteeism, migrant.... #RJUSDchat

RT @Edudemic: How to choose the best apps for your students: http://t.co/1GWCE9XdKD
A 7 and 8 very doable is all because we have built in PE prep. Hard is tech implementation bc many are in lrng stage w/  no time
@jeffpercell this provides reading with a purpose #RJUSDchat
A 5 essential and easier with cross-curr projects and in depth lrng. Takes time #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell @KathyRathburn yes, so let's go slow and be accurate with rubrics and cross-grade talks #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell @KathyRathburn yes, even at 3rd #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell as it should be unless your degree is not BA
CCSS gives more time for novels and written response as @KathyRathburn said   #RJUSDchat
We focus on expository, persuasive, narrative. Now Sts need to write explanations to justify their answers, more details  #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell correct. Factual, not inference. Need more focus on literary response #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell I'm finally done driving from Reno, etc. #RJUSDchat

@KathyRathburn PASSport has that. Still have materials. Had babysitting #RJUSDchat
@KathyRathburn it has been done before. Mostly 1 school. 7 days was too long, maybe shorten. Still have materials
@jeffpercell depends. Some Sts play during the day and don't get done, mostly and extension of learning
@jeffpercell limited Eng can support by listening to reading, asking favorite stories, quiet homework place PASSport ideas
PASSport is a parent 7 mtg class that gives ideas for home support  #RJUSDchat

Welcome to BTSA in RJUSD! Glad you are here! #RJUSDbtsa
@peggynemeth @jeffpercell its not slow thinking, its your thinking style. Its one of 5 &amp; really common. It would help others as well
A10 grading is part of personal philosophies, touchy subject, but directly impacts Sts #RJUSDchat
A9 Sts at collegiate level, chose college or vocational,  vote, work, goal oriented   #RJUSDchat
A8 continued conversation of needs and sharing of discoveries  #RJUSDchat
Q7 more room, less mandates to do group/same things, more indiv. trial and error w/grade level discussion after we each try #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell computers blend w/all, robotics w/math, math w/science, etc
Q6 since I fav. NETS, CCSS allows group projects w/ great tools #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell @peggynemeth  if classes are longer,worth 2 class. Eng 9/ Wd His 1 period. Project grades shared bw both, rotate Ts #RJUSDchat
@peggynemeth @MrsMelissaLocke @KathyRathburn depends on what? Which variables are diff? #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell @KathyRathburn our Ed. System needs to be 21C instead of industrial revolution. Need change tip down #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell @KathyRathburn why not fewer classes more in depth? #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell it is my worry and experience at HHS that too many memorize, spelling lists, etc. , forget them, have holes in learning
A3.3 group work w/ indiv. scores to show mastery, inquiry, no grade ceiling, low Sets get effort grade  #RJUSDchat
A3 teaching to CCSS Webb 6, internalization of studs/skills. Not test practice, isolated skill practice  #RJUSDchat
A2 Sts as critical thinkers working together in confidence w/the correct tool for each task #RJUSDchat
A1 new standards w/ application of learning instead of memorized response, willingness to hear from all stakeholders  #RJUSDchat
#RJUSDchat hello from a 3rd grade teacher
@RJUSD join along
Effective Group work, Google usage issues  #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell also in link crew, robotics, mock trial, stockmarketgame, cyberquest #RJUSDchat
A10: use of scaled rubric with points for teamwork, brainstorming, indiv. work then indiv. grade so no one punished 4 1 St lack  #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell also raises rigor so As at RHS are ready for college #RJUSDchat
@USHistoryRocks with lots of brain storming #RJUSDchat
A:7 RJUSD has allows autonomy so not much of a stretch  #RJUSDchat
A:6 Ss must collaborate, find best means of expressing knowledge of task in CCSS #RJUSDchat
@jeffpercell @KathyRathburn a menu of choices #RJUSDchat
@MrsMelissaLocke true. They need practice #RJUSDchat
St autonomy in showing growth/learning and choice in inquiry projects  #RJUSDchat
@KathyRathburn absolutely #RJUSDchat
A:3 Ss voice=relevance =willingness to learn #RJUSDchat
A:2 limited choices restricts As voice the most. #RJUSDchat

@jeffpercell @peggynemeth old site is http://t.co/chJ6CtPMFB and http://t.co/s0xUbkCKsW for using tech and games as learning tools
@simpletwitt thx for sharing such a great resource list!
RT @simpletwitt: ran across this resource for teachers.	http://t.co/WkGu4m2XhF
@alicekeeler @avantgame we need to reach these top ten in the classroom constantly. Thx both of you for promotion of this!
@julikimbley yes, I do smell better. Juli check your shared Google Drive
@alicekeeler @cnansen then show benefyof perseverance :-)
@julikimbley and a clean microwave? Beats nuking an egg!
@simpletwitt which ever shows your technology experience better, in my small opinion. Go for it!

@alicekeeler no. Its defeating, demeaning and a learning stopper.
@ijukes @cristin_kennedy excellence is repetition in deep learning/correction, thickens membrane around dendrities. Keep practicing! #RJUSD

Great ASA training tonight. Such a great group of innovative teachers #RJUSD
Nice Google Pres @RickJex #RJUSD Go Google Apps!
@jeffpercell sounds like a good first think tank for our peers
@AgathaSinnatra me too
@jeffpercell Right, but in more grade levels with more direction toward T driven ideas instead of curriculum/subject. Tech,delivery,motivate
@AlissaBlackburn That worked well for me too, inspiring. #RJUSD
@jeffpercell #RJUSD Cross grade level/subject projects would be great. Think Tanks!
@AlissaBlackburn I find their interest by giving project choice within standards: stu choice of stds and project presentation of mastery
@jeffpercell  what if teachers frontloaded info(direct instruction) online and on video to allow time for group discussion/practice in class
@davidtedu @CAedchat  LIfe long learners need to think past curriculum.  Investigation and experimentation are embedded in standards already
Consider doing math on paper! #RJUSD http://t.co/5sx8SNXmD5
@eyeoneducation @jeffpercell @Edudemic try techbites:  RHS has teachers sharing with teachers. Great PD #RJUSD
@jeffpercell @MrPowers4Math welcome to being treated as a professional and given autonomy.
