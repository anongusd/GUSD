@Ms___Anonymous @GrowlyBiteBite Though I haven't heard of companies using GPS trackers, I'm against that as well, unless there is a REALLY good reason why they would need something like that, and even then, the employee should be able to disable the app when they're not on the job.

@AtheistRepublic First of all, 'yes', as far as I'm concerned, it is the same thing. But even so, I can just grant the point that it isn't exactly the same thing because it doesn't matter; one thing does not have to be exactly equivalent to another before we can call it a problem. (6/last)

@GreySkepticMac that I'm not necessarily in favor of banning the AR15, but I find this to be an incredibly bad argument. (7/last)
@GreySkepticMac The AR15, on the other hand, is used in nearly every mass shooting we have. Now, I'm positive I have probably triggered a ton of gun nuts at this point who will accuse me of being 'anti-gun', and of wanting to take everyone's guns away, and so forth, so allow me to reiterate (6)
@GreySkepticMac ...sitting on a bus seat doesn't have the potential to harm anyone. Give me even one example where someone managed to kill multiple other people just by sitting on a bus seat, I'll give you until the end of time to provide that evidence. (5)
@GreySkepticMac claymore mines and set them up around my house for 'protection'.		This leads me to the first point, that this is a completely disingenuous comparison... In the case of Rosa Parks, we're talking about an issue of equality; the same set of rules for everyone, and... (4)
@GreySkepticMac That's a huge safety risk to the community. I think it would be perfectly reasonable to ask "why do you need claymore mines for home defense?" If we apply this universally, though, I can simply assert I shouldn't have to demonstrate a valid 'need' to have the right to own (3)
@GreySkepticMac An example of the latter; I want claymore mines for 'home defense', even though I live in a semi-crowded area, and cats, dogs, and potentially even kids may cross through my back yard or driveway at some point and trigger one of the mines. (2)
@GreySkepticMac While I'm not necessarily in favor of banning the AR15 per se, I think this is a terrible argument that a) is a disingenuous apples and oranges comparison and b) completely falls apart the second you apply a tiny amount of scrutiny to it. (1)

I guess I'm just finding it harder and harder to give the benefit of the doubt
@ladyunicornejg @Can_Atheist @MissusSnarky In most cases, I don't think anyone is trying to give the person a bigger audience. That probably does happen, but I think it's more likely that people have ill intent most of the time. Then again, maybe I've become too cynical.

@ladyunicornejg @Can_Atheist @MissusSnarky I think in some cases it's because they want to make sure to catch the attention of their followers so that the followers, in turn, get involved.

@AnsgarTOdinson Meh... tea is a small price to pay for comedic genius!... lol, just kidding! XD
@AnsgarTOdinson I see your point, but I think you've overlooked something;	*Ahem...	YOU HATE AMERICA YOU LIBTARD, MANGINA, FREE SPEECH HATING SNOWFLAKE SJW! YOU MAGA HAT WEARING, NAZI, BOTTOM-FEEDER OF THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES! 	Ball is in your court, now let's try to keep this civil.
@Legally_Blawnde Yeah, I worked Christmas Eve too, and that sucks, but I think having family members show up and just hang out would make things worse.
@MuneerMior @ClarkIan15 @HeavyTankZA @AnsgarTOdinson In the same treaty the Emperor signed that outlawed Talos worship, there were also land concessions from Hammerfell, which caused Hammerfell to cut ties with the Empire and become independent. High Rock is the last one. (4/last)
@MuneerMior @ClarkIan15 @HeavyTankZA @AnsgarTOdinson Also, High Rock, Skyrim, and Hammerfell were the biggest allies the Empire had during the first great war, and as such, the Aldmeri Dominion is trying to drive a wedge between them all; in Skyrim, Talos worship has been outlawed, leading to the Civil War. (3)
@MuneerMior @ClarkIan15 @HeavyTankZA @AnsgarTOdinson High Rock is essentially Westeros in the TES universe; dozens of rival kingdoms that have a long history of fighting each other, and it literally took what was basically a supernatural event/magic/a miracle to get them all to stop fighting in the first place. (2)
@MuneerMior @ClarkIan15 @HeavyTankZA @AnsgarTOdinson High Rock. Maybe High Rock and Hammerfell. 		For one thing, Game of Thrones is incredibly popular right now, obviously, and lots of writers, producers, etc. are using that as inspiration to tell stories involving back-door politics, power grabs, etc. (1)
@ClarkIan15 @HeavyTankZA @MuneerMior @AnsgarTOdinson Hell yeah! Although, I think Ulfric wants to be High King bad enough that there is some chance he'd keep the rebellion going anyway.		It'll be interesting to see what Bethesda does with TES 6
@HeavyTankZA @AnsgarTOdinson And, let's face it, the Dark Elves, for example, are never going to ally with the Nords or vice versa.
@AntiheroCast @AnsgarTOdinson @Scribe_Light @InaneDragon eventually, take over Tamriel.		What the game should do is allow you to show that dossier to Ulfric and try to end the war peacefully. (2/last)
@AntiheroCast @AnsgarTOdinson @Scribe_Light @InaneDragon There is a dossier on Ulfric in the Thalmor embassy that says the rebellion is good for them because it weakens the Empire, and they refer to Ulfric as an 'uncooperative asset'.		In my view, if the Stormcloaks win the Civil War, it ultimately means the Aldmeri Dominion will (1)

@matryoshka_core @rebeccawatson Reread the tweet, you've apparently missed most of it. I explicitly said, "Do what you want", that's the exact opposite of 'policing'. I just pointed out that if you do/say things that you know are going to piss people off you shouldn't be surprised and complain... (1)

@InaneDragon I don't think the pay is very good, but the cost of living seems pretty low too, and there's all the booze I can drink. And, I suppose if things get a little too tight, I could always do the 'trapper' job I'm supposed to be doing. That should pay pretty well! (2/last)
@InaneDragon Job?	*head scratch	Well, I think I'm technically a trapper living and working in one of the American colonies during the fur trade, but as far as I can tell I think I'm actually going to be spending a hell of a lot more time in a given day killing British soldiers. (1)

@tomflusk If that weaksauce comment is what passes for 'defending' someone or something these days, that's a strange combination of hilarious and sad. But I thought of it (and intended it) as an 'own you actions' statement.
@rebeccawatson I don't like the guy either. Still, though, trashing him publically while his family and friends are mourning is a shitty thing to do. Do what you want, but if you do a thing that most people will view as shitty, don't complain when you get called on it.

See, it works like this; extremist morons kill each other off, the 'civil war/revolution' thing ends around the beginning of summer, we celebrate with a big feast and make that a new tradition, which means we have another Thanksgiving at the beginning of summer! (5)
When all of you morons start killing each other, can you aim to wrap things up with the 'revolution' (or whatever) around the beginning of summer or so? I don't care which year, it's really more 'a time of year' thing... (4)
Or, in some cases, they've found 'creative' ways to incorporate holiday themes, traditions, etc. into their rhetoric. It seems that civil war is inevitable at this point. I've come to accept that, but I do have one request; (3)
But there is also a fair amount of people who don't seem to have noticed it's a holiday and they have just resumed the standard "fuck the 'other side', they're trying to destroy America, my side is better - blah, blah, blah" schtick. (2)

If I had to get a body part amputated for one reason or another (I wouldn't ask to keep it in the first place, it's going to stink like hell) but if I did for reasons I cannot fathom, and they told me it was a biohazard, I probably would accept that, lol.
@PhadingDark OK. I thought that might be the case, but in this particular case, I thought maybe it'd constitute some type of hazard or something. This story is kinda setting off my BS alarm a little bit, so I thought I'd ask about it. Thanks for the response! :)
@PhadingDark I have a question for you: suppose a guy is getting his foot amputated, but tells the doctor he wants to keep the severed foot... Do they let him, or is there some kind of policy against that sort of thing?
If you have to 'remind' people that you're a 'big deal', chances are you're not that big of a deal.

@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist Yup, makes sense.
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, I am completely against that ruling.
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist Ruling? I didn't realize this was in reference to an actual case, I thought it was just a hypothetical question. If there was a real-life case where it was ruled to be illegal or 'wrong' to call Mohammed a pedo, then, 'yes', I am against that ruling.
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist OK... If I understood that correctly, I think we're in agreement?
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist didn't take a moral stand against it, and even engaged in the practice himself."		That makes sense in terms of psychology, but in terms of the religious claim (that he was 'divinely inspired/guided' by an unchanging being) makes no sense. (3/last)
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist In terms of character assessments and making moral judgments there is something worth pointing out here;		"Wow, pedophilia was understood to be wrong at the time, Mohammed didn't care and did it anyway.	vs.	"Pedophilia was a common practice at the time, and Mohammed... (2)
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist I'm not trying to restrict criticism, in fact, I encourage it. Viewing Mohammed's (or any religious figure's) actions through the lens of human psychology makes their stories make more sense. Viewing them through the lens of religious claims, they are contradictory. (1)
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist ...while still understanding that it is unlikely that Mohammed was going to be 'ahead of his time'. That's why I initially said it is 'somewhat relevant to consider'. Does that clear things up? (4/last)
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist ...a product of his time in that specific case.  It's still behavior that we recognize as wrong, but we also know that people are prone to 'going with the flow', so to speak. The act is still pedophilia, it's still wrong, it's fine to condemn the actions today... (3)
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist &lt;...If someone calls Mohammed a pedophile, they're very obviously saying something negative about his character. That's perfectly fine to do, but if the thing being criticized was a standard practice at the time, that does matter, because he is essentially... (2)

@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist Nope, because I didn't argue that pedophilia was OK.
@nogod_pinesnake @EliteSkeptiC @Can_Atheist While I do generally agree with what's said here, and definitely think it should continue to be legal to call Mohammed a pedo, historical context is somewhat relevant here too. I don't happen to know what the common practice was for that time period, but it matters.

@CaptainContrar1 @AnsgarTOdinson One of the 'slashers' (a man who probably weighed close to 170 lbs or so) managed to get behind the guy and made a 50-yard mad dash towards him... I was like 'dude, you mean to tell me you can't hear a 170 lb dude in a full-on sprint behind you?' (3)
@CaptainContrar1 @AnsgarTOdinson That one the other night, though... I just couldn't suspend disbelief... I mean, at one point, one of the 'victims' fighting for his life went into the woods and essentially decided he was going to play sniper (with a shotgun, I might add) and just pick the 'slashers' off. (2)
@CaptainContrar1 @AnsgarTOdinson Yeah, I do get what you mean... for me, I like the slasher flicks where the slasher is brilliant and ten steps ahead of everyone else. It is a bit overdone, but not everyone who does it, does it 'right'. (1)

@CaptainContrar1 @AnsgarTOdinson Meh, it depends on how it's done, I'd say. I was watching one the other night where there was a trio of slashers working together, and apparently, they must have had supernatural powers or something... There was no explanation for why... they just 'did'. (1)

@AnsgarTOdinson Assassin's Creed was my favorite video game series for a while; I bought the special pre-order edition of every game up until 'Black Flag', that was the last one. I haven't even played any of the games past that. IMO, the series took a nosedive after 3 and never recovered. (1)

@SkepticNikki If the former is true, that 'God' is simply commanding people to do things that are already moral, that is not necessarily a 'might makes right' system, but that also means that there are objective reasons why 'A, B, and C' are 'good' things to do. Which also means that... (6)
@SkepticNikki If the latter is true, then morality is purely a matter of 'might makes right'. Hypothetically, 'God' could have commanded that child molestation is moral, and it would be so. Any counter-argument about 'the nature of God' is a BS cop out and totally irrelevant. (5)

@SkepticNikki The problem is that morality is an incredibly complicated subject, but you have a fair chunk of religious people who's entire argument basically boils down to: 'God said do A, B, and C, do not do X, Y, and Z, and he's the ultimate authority of the universe and never wrong.' (1)

@dpakman David, I would like to hear your take on the potential of Kavanaugh being impeached. I'm sure you are aware that some Senate Dems are talking about that, personally, I don't think they'll follow through, but even if they do I don't think it's likely to be successful. (1)

@finer_a Fine, you can think I'm just a blatantly dishonest jackass who's just lying about what I meant, that's your prerogative, and there's no real way for me to prove what I meant. And I'll think you're either incredibly disingenuous and blatantly strawmaning and cherry-picking... (1)
RT @PSA_Sitch: Who is/was an intentionally more divisive president. (In that they are/were cultivating division to help themselves.)
@finer_a ...which is all this argument has become and it's now beyond pointless. (5/last)
@finer_a it's just an assertion about what my intentions were, and that's ridiculous. You either accept that or you don't, but I'm not willing to take your argument seriously (no matter how much you may like me) when you keep insisting you know what I meant better than I do,... (4)
@finer_a ...and that's not how I intended it to be taken. If I tweeted that sentence out on its own, and you called me on it, then I said "no, here's the article about the situation I'm talking about" you'd have a basis for claiming I'm revising what I said. As it stands, though... (3)
@finer_a And, 'yes', you can indeed cherry-pick a sentence here or there out of a larger statement someone has made and still be taking that person out of context. For the last time, you are obsessed with treating that one sentence as though it is a stand-alone statement... (2)
@finer_a I didn't 'decide' anything half-way through. I will accept you know what goes on in other people's heads when you can objectively demonstrate your psychic powers to me, and I will accept you know what goes on in my head when I hear you say something accurate about it. (1)
@finer_a ...my statement after the fact falls flat on its ass because I linked the article and quoted the title in its entirety in advance of your accusations. I'm not going to adopt the strawman position you built up to make it easier to attack what I said, end of story. (3/last)
@finer_a is that the sentence wasn't said on its own. If that were the only thing I had tweeted, you'd have a point. Since I linked the article and quoted the title in its entirety, it's clear that I was not making a generalized statement. Your BS accusation that I've 'revised'... (2)
@finer_a So, this has got to be the most blatant attempt to strawman someone I have ever seen. You're either incredibly dishonest, or you have the worst case of head-in-ass syndrome I have ever seen. The problem with your entire argument (as I have already pointed out at least once) (1)

@finer_a All of those things being the case, 'no', the statement was not a generalized one, and anyone who interprets it that way is being overly obtuse, and frankly, I'm done arguing about it. If you don't think to overlook someone being a rapist/attempted rapist when considering... (2)
@finer_a The "if you support a rapist..." line was said in the context of the article I linked and the title of it, which I quoted. Furthermore, we all know exactly who Kavanaugh is and what position he is being considered for and what 'supporting him' means in that context. (1)

@finer_a "You shouldn't support a rapist in ANY endeavor..." is a completely disingenuous way to frame the situation, we aren't talking about just ANY endeavor, we're talking about an appointment to the highest court in the country. Secondly, I don't give a shit how long ago... (1)

@MissUndoomed @Pinterest I hate Pinterest! If I had a choice to rid the world of cancer or Pinterest, I'd like to think I'd do the thing that I should obviously do in that situation, but in all likelihood the world would have one less website in it. I'm a terrible person, I know.

@Ranting_Monkey So, maybe you could say 'you're rightn't'? (2)
@Ranting_Monkey lol, I heard about this a while ago, started as a joke but some people think it should be a thing... Anyway, since 'no' has a negative connotation to it, someone (jokingly) proposed using the word 'yesn't' instead; the contraction of 'yes' and 'not' (1)

@dailydot pprofessors say to the contrary. (3/last)
@dailydot type of racism they are talking about, and what specifically it is they are trying to study. Furthermore, the idea that you can't be racist to white people or sexist to men is not the scholarly consensus among sociologists. I don't give half a fuck what your 'gender studies' (2)
@dailydot Let me guess... it's that BS argument feminists/SJWs give about 'the' sociological definition of racism, right? Just one problem; that is some cherry-picked bullshit-- full stop. There is no one definitive sociological definition of racism, they use many depending on what (1)

@AnsgarTOdinson @InanePrincess @InaneDragon *proper overhauls	...damn auto correct!
@AnsgarTOdinson @InanePrincess @InaneDragon Those are the main ones at the moment. Also 'Immersive Armors', some weapon mods, etc. I tend to be really picky about weapon and armor mods, though. (3/last)

@mundanematt Lol, when people make non-arguments like this, I hear ''I'm a whiny bitch who refuses to think with even the slightest degree of nuance because someone duped me into thinking it's virtuous not to and that I'll be 'on the right side of history for it' and I will toss insults (1)

I was going to have a productive Saturday, but instead, I decided to fulfill assassination contracts for the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim... and I even fucked that up by getting sidetracked, lol!
@kealacarr everyone, or even a majority of their fans in most cases... Still, though, I don't see the point, personally. (2/last)
@kealacarr I think that's the case with the overwhelming majority of people... I don't follow any celebrities 1) for lack of interest, but 2) as far as I can tell their social media accounts are just to promote their stuff. In fairness, it would be impossible for them to interact with (1)

@AnsgarTOdinson Well, yeah, historically there have definitely been times where they have been more militaristic but I was mostly talking about those Obama era regs that were undone a while ago.
@AnsgarTOdinson Hmm. Maybe if we didn't have a group of people running around in black hoodies beating the fuck out of people in the streets and setting buildings on fire, destroying cars and shit the police wouldn't be militarizing right now... or at least more people would be against it.
@Mezzerz @SUnearthed Pot and kettle, man... Pot. and. kettle.
@Mezzerz @SUnearthed Oh, ffs... I will accept your assertions about what goes on in my head when you are able to demonstrate your psychic powers to me.
@Mezzerz @SUnearthed too much of my time. I'm not interested in watching some random clip posted with no explanation of why it matters or is in anyway relevant to what was 'I' said, or what Stacy had said. (2)
@Mezzerz @SUnearthed I don't care what Bill O'Reilly has to say about anything, quite frankly, the man is a propagandist. Everything he says needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I was just pointing out you said something kinda ridiculous. But doing that seems like it's going to take WAY (1)
@RantingF You can keep her! ;)
@Mezzerz @SUnearthed The point I was making flew about a mile over your head. You asked 'Paganism is OK, but not Christianity"... she told you to use Christianity (by asking Jesus) to stop Pagans... She didn't Say Paganism is OK, nor is she stopping you from practicing Christianity.
@Mezzerz @SUnearthed Dude, she said ask Jesus to stop them...

@Sugar_Tits_Bear Because some people live to be outraged and are so ready and willing to get whipped up into a frenzy over absolutely anything.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @RINMichaelis @chrisiousity I totally understand that. Though, in my case, I've barely spoken with Chrisiousity so I haven't formed an opinion yet.
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @RINMichaelis @chrisiousity Yeah, I totally see your point. I don't have an opinion personally. My comment wasn't necessarily meant as a defense of anyone or an excuse for behavior... I guess I was just saying there are a lot of hypersensitive people on Twitter.
@landoffacts Unfollowing ;P
@MEMESofVIOLENCE @RINMichaelis @chrisiousity Meh... I get blocked all the time by people who I've never interacted with, and in many cases people I don't even know which is vaguely hilarious if you ask me because the overwhelming majority of my posts are fairly benign and vanilla.
@CGGeeks @kealacarr That makes my day, thanks! :)
@kealacarr @CGGeeks I haven't made a lot of progress, but I want to have it done by the end of the week. Eventually, I want to do a 3D version as well.
@kealacarr @CGGeeks It's the only way to get better! I realized the other day, though, that my drawing skills are slipping because I've been spending so much time on 3D work. I'm gonna set aside some time to draw every day. Here's a Catwoman character concept I'm working on. https://t.co/SHytbQ6zo7

"Can we talk"	#3WordsICannotStand 	Nothing good is ever going to follow those words. People only want to talk when there is a problem with something.
@sofain Exactly!
@sofain I just had someone use the Argumentum ad Butthurt fallacy on me a couple hours ago, but I haven't heard the Argumentum ad Fanboy fallacy in a while... at least not directed at me, anyway.
@sofain That is a good one, but I also like the Argumentum ad Fanboy. When you defend a person or idea, you're immediately dismissed as a 'fanboy', regardless of the case you make. People typically use this to avoid having to deal with counter-arguments, so these fallacies are similar.

@the1janitor That depends almost entirely on one's preferences and maybe, to some extent, 'when' one plays the game... If it's been hyped by everyone you know, and you still haven't played it, it might not live up to your expectations when you finally do.

Watching 'Slasher: The Executioner' on Netflix and 'The Executioner' is taking people the fuck out. Someone should try running at him ass first with their pants down while screaming 'Murica!' I hear that's a good tactic. ;)
@642Shadowfox In the case of Pew, however, I'm so tired of these 'scandals', and him just kinda pretending he didn't know what he was doing. Once, I'd believe, twice, meh, OK maybe, three times, that's pushing it. He knows what he's doing, can't own it, but still wants the attention. (2/last)
@642Shadowfox I didn't even see the meme and I don't care about it. This, in my view, is more or less in the same category of things as Kathy G. posting those pics holding up the head of Donald Trump. It was just shock value for the sake of shock value and that's boring. (1)
Well, it seems PewDiePie wants attention again. Fuck that dude. He's just getting annoying at this point.
@AnsgarTOdinson @InanePrincess @kealacarr @InaneDragon @Sugar_Tits_Bear @YourselfSuit Yeah, I used to get into trouble all the time in school for drawing instead of doing class work... that and fighting. What can I say, I was a conflicted kid, lol!
