@Seilback 12:01am
So today i just say Thank you Charleston. You acknowledged my ppl were human. You acknowledged our dignity. Kudos!
The answer is no apology can make up for centuries of depriving a ppl access to economic opportunity, first class education or quality healthcare. 		But today, I can‚Äôt even see our President acknowledging slavery in a meaningful way or its ripple effects.
I have to pause when I say ‚ÄúThis is not America.‚Äù Because it is. It‚Äôs our history. 		I already know tomorrow my bro @cthagod is going to hit me asking ‚Äúwhat does it really mean?‚Äù
I have to put Charleston, SC vote to apologize for slavery  into perspective. As the administration executes a policy to separate children from their parents I remember all the Native Americans, Negroes, and Japanese that were subjected to the same treatment.
