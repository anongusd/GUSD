"Friends, let's begin by thanking...including the Fords, everybody who helped get this fantastic crowd out tonight" @pmharper at Ford rally.
By rallying with Ford brothers Ford @pmharper danced with the devil.  Or is it the other way around? Maybe all 3 are devils. #DesperateCons
By rallying with Rob and Doug Ford to boost his failing campaign @pmharper saved 1-3 seats locally but lost supporters nationally. #elxn42
RT @thefutureyousee: @KatieSimpsonCTV "including the Fords"
@THCrinstam The brothers were so bad that SUN TV felt them incapable of doing a second show. Really.
.@mstanik0 It is local sleazy politics much like you would see in New Jersey or Louisiana. Yes Canada too. We are not immune to demagogues.
.@mstanik0 Fords control many votes in west Toronto. Harper is taking a calculated risk that gain there more than damage to overall campaign
Support @VoteJoanMouland the Liberal candidate in Haldimand Norfolk a very qualified and experienced candidate. #elxn42
.@mhayday It is good they did make the correction for Guelph. It is important that strategic voting recommendations be accurate.
@mhayday @marksholdice @iancapstick @leadnowca I just checked the vote together link and it shows the Liberal way ahead of everyone else.
@marksholdice If the Hell's Angels endorsed Harper he would have a rally with them too.
@rmfaris I listened to the full speech and did not hear it. I will check replays and correct my Tweets if I was wrong.
.@gr8tlaker @pmharper The Ford Nation base think they can some day be part of the 1% and so they vote against their self interest.
Still no mention or acknowledgement of hosts Rob and Doug Ford as @pmharper delivers standard simplistic stump speech in Ford Nation rally.
@TMtheG @louisa_faux Lawyers often use drama and humour to prove points and I tend to do that even in my political action.
More Let's Make a Deal stunts as @pmharper uses cash register gimmick again at Ford Brothers Rally. Nice sound effects, though. #elxn42
Don't be fooled says @pmharper promising lower taxes. Federal taxes are at lowest level in half century and will be lowered again. #elxn42
Will @pmharper mention Dofo or Rofo? So far he has not in any way acknowledged the presence of the Ford brothers. #elxn42
@TMtheG @louisa_faux I am doing everything I can for that. thanks.
It appears @pmharper didn't want @DougFord2014 to introduce him. Doug passed mike to someone else who did the intro and Doug left the stage.
