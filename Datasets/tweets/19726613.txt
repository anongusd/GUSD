Following the frightening incident today at Presque Isle Airport, I contacted @NTSB &amp; asked them to investigate the cause. NTSB sent two investigators to Presque Isle today. As Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to monitor their progress.
I cosponsored this resolution because I believe the answer to that question is no. I strongly support protecting the system of checks &amp; balances enshrined in our Constitution. 3/3

2/4 Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan Farmer—an alumnus of @BowdoinCollege and a Green Beret who earned numerous medals, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart—was killed by ISIS, alongside another American service member and two civilians.
1/4 This week, two separate terrorist attacks took from us two individuals with ties to Maine.
The signing of this bill I authored with @SenatorCardin is a good first step in providing relief for federal workers. While guaranteeing back pay will help give some peace of mind, a compromise must be reached to bring this shutdown to an end. https://t.co/RefRPmJksr
I’ll vote to disapprove Treasury’s easing of sanctions on Russian businesses involving oligarch &amp; Putin ally Oleg Deripaska.  He still would maintain significant control given his ties to Putin.  Easing the sanctions sends the wrong message to Russia &amp; to Deripaska.
I talked to a waitress in Bangor this morning whose husband works for TSA. They literally had to get a loan to pay their mortgage for this month. That's just wrong. I continue to believe that a compromise is possible because this is a problem that we have to solve.
The Senate unanimously passed a bill @SenatorCardin &amp; I authored that ensures federal workers affected by the partial government shutdown will receive retroactive pay. While this will help provide some peace of mind, we must bring this impasse to an end.
Having visited more than 200 schools in ME, I know a great school is like a winning team where everyone does their best. Dr. Levesque Elementary in Frenchville should be proud to be named a Blue Ribbon School– 1 of 3 in ME this year &amp; among only 349 nationwide to win this honor. https://t.co/bThRasybRK
The need to end the partial government shutdown is urgent. Lives are being affected by this impasse. Congress should reopen much of the government immediately while negotiations continue.
It is not a sign of weakness to try to figure out a middle ground. It is a sign of strength. Both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen &amp; to compromise. https://t.co/iHv7zkVXJE
Shutdowns represent a failure to govern &amp; harm those who interact with the closed agencies as well as federal employees &amp; their families. As we work to end this shutdown, @SenatorCardin &amp; I introduced a bill to ensure these civil servants are paid.

Good news for the Coast Guard! White House staff called to tell me CG members will receive their paychecks as did other federal employees. I continue to work to end the shutdown, but this will provide immediate relief to CG members &amp; their families. https://t.co/lcH63g1U3U
Military members are paid under a different schedule than civilian employees. The most recent pay period for the military started on Dec. 16 and runs through Dec. 31.
Though the partial shutdown largely doesn’t impact the Defense Department and members of the military in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, the same isn’t true for the U.S. Coast Guard, a Department of Homeland Security subcomponent that lacks full-year 2019 appropriations.
Most federal employees will receive their scheduled paychecks today, but that is not the case for 42,000 Coast Guard members, who will not be paid for pre-shutdown work because they are under a different pay system.  This is not fair. I called the WH to urge an immediate fix.
Great news for BIW! The Navy has awarded an additional destroyer to the shipyard, proving once again that “Bath built is best built.”  This additional ship will help keep the workload stable in the years ahead for the hardworking men &amp; women of BIW https://t.co/KWSks50pet

Our legislation will promote information sharing among courts and local, state, &amp; federal organizations, encourage the use of background checks, &amp; expand availability of federal grants to improve the guardianship system.
Guardianship is a legal relationship created to protect seniors and adults with diminished or lost capacity. In so many cases, guardians help these protected individuals maintain their financial assets and independence; however, our report shows that abuse is far too prevalent.
A report released today by @SenateAging finds that the guardianship system often lacks basic protections &amp; leaves vulnerable Americans at risk of exploitation. We must close the gaps in the system, which is why @SenBobCasey &amp; I authored the Guardianship Accountability Act.
