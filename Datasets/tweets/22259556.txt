@hamiltonbryce1 I think he's coming back
@hamiltonbryce1 he's such a great quarterback but he just has not had the success you would expect in the post season... Hard to explain

RT @Espngreeny: Peyton Manning is best regular season QB I've ever seen. But the playoffs are a different story. Again. #Broncos
Peyton is now 0-4 in cold weather playoff games!!!!!!
YES!!!!!  Ravens rock the sports world!!!!
Lets end this now!!!!!
Why is the offense so conservative???? Can't keep giving Manning the ball!!
Manning- pick 6
That's a catch... Ball can touch the ground as long as it is being controlled
TD time!!!!
http://t.co/U2DedgYi
Does the ref understand the OT rules????
YES!!!!
Are you kidding me???
C'mon refs... Get in the game!!!!
Awesome...  Champ Bailey is getting burnt all day!!
Peyton in cold weather playoff games... Gotta love it!!!!
Picks for the weekend	Ravens over Broncos	Niners over Packers	Falcons over Seahawks	Pats over Texans
