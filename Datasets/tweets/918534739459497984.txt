@Jared47288706 @ScottWalker Here's the full link to further your education:	https://t.co/RH33Pd0cL9
@Jared47288706 @ScottWalker lucky you went to school when you did it seems.
@Jared47288706 @ScottWalker "sponsored by Republican state Sen. Mary Lazich, repeals the Healthy Youth Act passed by Wis. legislators in 2010, when Democrats controlled state government. This means the "health benefits, side effects, and proper use of contraceptives" will no longer be taught in schools."
@Jared47288706 @ScottWalker "legislation signed by Walker would promote abstinence as the only reliable way to prevent pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases, teaches the positive socioeconomic benefits of marriage,  adds discussion of bullying to the sex education curriculum school districts may use."
@Jared47288706 @ScottWalker Not if you leave it up to the GOP who wants to remove both, just as they are doing worldwide. Walker does NOT support easy access to birth control OR sex education in schools, much like most of his peers.
@BreakingNLive so?? still does not explain away these kids being there to mock, jeer and taunt. Those kids should never have been there and their chaperones should be held more accountable.
@ScottWalker Why don't you support easier access to birth control, and sex education in schools, if you truly want abortion numbers to drop?
@OANN @YouTube talk about fake news- gimme a break with this spin. those kids are pompous little twerps who were there to jeer, mock and taunt.
