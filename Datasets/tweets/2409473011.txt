@realDonaldTrump U, &amp; republicans continue to play political games. U, have committed treason against our nation, several times.  Illegal. U, have committed conspiracy to defraud U.S. Illegal. U, have conspired &amp; colluded to win election, "By any &amp; all means." Illegal. Hillary won the election.
@realDonaldTrump It's your wall, U pay for it! U said Mexico would pay for it.  Your wall is not structurally engineered! It is not being built now, it's in federal courts due to your stupidity on eminent domain case, where land wasn't purchased from owners, no permits taken either! ILLEGAL!
@realDonaldTrump More lies Donald? U already told these lies, the wall is not desperately needed. What is needed? Is more help in those countries w/dictatorships, so they are not killed, disparaged, building infrastructure to help them work for decent well paid jobs to support their families.

@realDonaldTrump It's not desperately needed at that price, not being engineered for these areas of flood plains, and Mt.s. U have factored any of this into cost. It will be disaster, w/cost overruns, and for ecosystem. Homeland security said u cost all of America it's security w/govt shutdown.
@realDonaldTrump Who died &amp; made u God? NO One! U have been trouble since a child, U conspire constantly on all levels, U are not to be trusted in any shape or form anywhere. U have lied &amp; cheated your whole life, U must write resignation letter, notify congress, turn yourself into Mueller/FBI.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats are not for high taxes, but everyone to pay their fair share, incl. U &amp; family. They are not for Open Borders &amp; crime either! U do enough crime w/in cabinet members, businesses, tax evasion in business, violations of U.S. Constitution, Emoluments Acts, treason w/Russia.
@realDonaldTrump Less then 10% of those corporations gave any $ to the lower paid staff/employees in bonuses. U got out of millions in Estate taxes on your businesses, as others, and big tax cut on your businesses, especially those overseas, but u are now slapped w/tax evasion for screwing them.
@realDonaldTrump U, &amp; Republicans gave away tax welfare for top 10%, and Corporations, which was not needed and they said they did not mind paying! Not high taxes, u &amp; Republicans didn't have a way to pay for these tax cuts, it didn't trickle down! It went to buy back stock, pay top 10% bonuses!
