@senor_pez Important historical footnote on  death squads operating during Reagan Era. 		Though they existed previously in #Guatemala, #ElSalvador death squads were set up after #ARENA went to #Guatemala to learn how to operate them. #ReaganAdm official visits gave green light for killings.
@senor_pez So #ElliottAbrams defends human rights atrocities bc "we were on the right side of the Cold War, as if, in case of Guatemala, we were supporting democracy. 		#Guatemala &amp; #ElSalvador, were mafiosa capitalist govts w military-led death squads operating freely to crush all dissent.
@senor_pez Not only did US government overthrow democratically elected governments in Guatemala, Iran in 1954, in both cases there was no "national security threat" which is why USA did not declare war on these govts but used #CIA to subvert govts. 		Dictatorships were then installed by USA
@senor_pez Instructive.		 #ElliottAbrams goes right away to his ultimate defense of backing Genocidal Regimes in places like Guatemala:  "this guy thinks we were on the wrong side of the Cold War..."		1954 US coup in Guatemala overthrew a democratically elected government. Ditto #Iran.
