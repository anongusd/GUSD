@billscher “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” F. Scott Fitzgerald - Let’s hope for DACA reform and to avoiding a shutdown!
@billscher I think a shutdown puts focus on that fact explicitly! I am against a shutdown for many reasons you listed in your article. However, DACA cannot wait, and the President reneged on a publicly made deal.
@billscher Basically, the President of the United States gave his word and then backed out. Not only will this shut down the gov but create further division and impact families etc. Dems need to do better as well. No argument there!
@billscher DACA is on a rolling calendar, people are already being impacted. Trump publicly agreed last week to fund the gov. &amp; address DACA as phase 1, wall phase 2. I understand the premise of your argument but feel that it could be expanded upon to include the obvious- this is on Repubs.
@billscher Personally, I feel Sen. Dick Durban’s statement today to the Secretary of Homeland Security sums it up.
@billscher That’s a fact! However a bipartisan deal was negotiated publicly in good faith. I fear we are normalizing the irrational- with all due respect.
I hope the bias in this article stems from naïveté and not outright bias. Republicans control all 3 branches of government. The powers that be are to blame if the government shuts down, not the current minority. https://t.co/hkSnNsBRAY
