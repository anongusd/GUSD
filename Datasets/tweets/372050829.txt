Fellow Resisters do not give up your struggle against Trump Tyranny! We all know he is a PUPPET and NOT a LEADER! Because Genuine Leadership is not about deception, manipulation, status or station in life... It's about personal dedication, diligence and leading by example !
@wilson_anne I believe this is the exact issue raised by Lao Tzu over 2,500 years ago. When he said: Lao: "What is a good man but a bad man's teacher. What is a bad man but a good man's job." Genuine Leadership is not about status or station in life. It's personal dedication and diligence!
@wilson_anne I agree. That is what real leaders do. They find the courage and compassion in themselves to lead by example, despite all hurdles on their path... By thinking to make a difference, You can and I think have already taken the necessary steps...
