@msnicole1124 @Patriot988 @realDonaldTrump Pretty sure there’s a reason why Trump is not letting the FISA warrants out for all to see. It’s time to play offense.  Where’s that new DOJ leader. Where’s the obama investigations?
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump Disagree. The democrat party is a disgrace!
@thehill Now that the collusion issue is dead they have to go to obstruction! Anything to feed the hive raw pollen!
@M68Tony @DonaldJTrumpJr This is a travesty in our history. It’s time for the real truth to get the daylight it needs. Why is none of the unmasking violations being prosecuted? Why are the FISA abuses not getting addressed.
@RealSaavedra With more than 300k illegal alien voters that’s  hard to believe. With known ballot fraud in black communities where Republican candidates are omitted  from the ballot that’s hard to believe. With Clinton, the known liar, anything’s believable!
@BreitbartNews Tired of it. There’s plenty of evidence Clinton collaborated with Russia. It’s time to change our focus!
@thehill WhT a sick lying scumbag. It’s exactly the opposite. Bernie Sander’s the fascist socialist wants to do that. Because that’s what fascists like Hitler and Mussolini did, both socialists. It’s natural for socialists to organize their societies in the manner sanders suggests!
@superyayadize @Caliicoder3 Illegal aliens need to go. It’s time folks. It’s time for the illegal alien to be collected from the country and returned. Regardless of how much they are allegedly contributing. No more patty cake!
@DineshDSouza @KevinMKruse He’s called a libtard, suffering from a severe case of mental libtardation!
@katrina_wiser @Caliicoder3 The world knows she’s full of shit. Chief full-of-bull is a compulsive sick liar. She’s a racist Phuck that perpetrated FRAUD on her college and teaching applications, and denied a deserving Native American if a shot at a great 450K one class per semester job!
@Jamierodr14 @gatewaypundit The problem is simple . Arrest the pig teacher. Charge her with a civil rights violation hate crime. Put her in prison for 10 years. Students parents get to sue the educational institution the city and state.
@superyayadize I think her policies are consistent with what you’d expect from the low IQ millennial base that elected her.
@BreitbartNews Don’t know who he is, or what he does. Hard to imagine an English guy, with his country as screwed up as it is, lecturing us on racism !
@JeanneInTexas @AOC Dumbasses, pigs, slobs and hypocrites don’t araise one iota of interest to me. Kind of like searching for a book on liberal war hero’s.
@DailyCaller Tell Nadler to phuckoff. Who elected or appointed him to any position of power or authority! But please Attempt to impeach him.
@RealJamesWoods Dems are just setting the stage for every New Democrat president that serves under a Republican Congress. Do you think sanders and his wife would survive a real investigation? How about Trump declassify some of the events Obutthole his by labeling g them classified?
@KevinMKruse @DineshDSouza @DaveinDiego Joke? You mean prove he’s not a hypocritical leftist  jerk like the scumbag that locked Dinesh up for exercising his first amendment rights!
@RealJamesWoods We haven’t been to a movie in two years, nor have we purchased any DVDs, and streaming services. Considering what we spent vs what we are now saving, I’m almost thankful, that actors, movie studios, directors are all such leftist scumbags!
@CR I have little doubt that one Donald Trump, a no shit pro life president, will not let any of those Dems forget their decision!
@HLAurora63 You’re right he’s an idiot. She’s a one and done congress woman. Dems don’t like her they just can’t share it.
@thehill There’s anxiety, if your wealthy, or if you live in a high taxed blue state.
@jemelehill Your wrong, it appears you have no clue about socialism! Socialism is great for the elites and exists at the expense of capitalism, and guarantees nobody, ever succeeds or achieves independence from government handouts. But if your an expert, you know this!
@13_cupcakes @RashidaTlaib Here’s a newsflash! This country, at least republicans, will not tolerate the anti Semitic hatred that Oman and you bring into the congress. Take it to the bank,  the GOP, will not tolerate your version of dick twisted hatred!
@thehill Corey is right. Democrats suppressed and mistreated black Americans until strong republicans stepped in and changed it. If it wasn’t for republicans where would we be?
@Dougs1978 @BreitbartNews Says the person who supports a political party that spies on competitors, stuffs the ballot boxes, weaponizes the IRS, and wants to now tell us what we can eat. The party that supports killing  newborn children .
@Dougs1978 @BreitbartNews Sanders makes no bones that he’s going to turn the US into Venezuela. He sounds very similar to Maduro snd Fidel Castro! Just pointing out this guy wants to be put in charge and control of our daily life!
@ltlgcoach @LATAMforTRUMP @ABC One thing is certain. This is the new way all presidents will get treated , Hope mr Nadler takes note!
@BreitbartNews Gee coming from a politician with the lowest approval rating in all of congress?
@clusterfutz @imagineworldone Here’s a newsflash! 95-97% of teachers are  libtards. The worst infestation of any of America’s institutions! Dead last amongst top 40 industrialized nations in the world, yet first in per capita spending!!
@gcippon @CraigAr64 @ouchinagirl @BernieSanders But greed does have a place in a socialists mind!
@LeahR77 @inittowinit007 I’d like to think this is true! It gives hope , that some in this country are waking up and discovering just how immoral infanticide really is, just difficult to break those people from the hive!
@Ohio_Buckeye_US @Airbornex82nd Look at the shit those people elect for office. That’s not an accident things like that don’t get reported. Most dem politicians do not allow the hive to report such stories!
@gaye_gallops Yep ! The sad part is she has so many dead people voting for her each election, it doesn’t matter! Even if she’s found guilty, she’ll get re-elected!
@SuperEliteTexan @Airbornex82nd Tell that to a libtard? Not going to happen, libs don’t have the capacity to think outside of what the hive permits.
@jnottah @Airbornex82nd @BreitbartNews You guys in Maryland have a buttload of illegal aliens voting democrat. That’s why bills like that get put in place.
@gaye_gallops Those are democrats you’re talking about. Be careful!
@ouchinagirl @HLAurora63 @BernieSanders Name one way socialism provides a pathway to the American dream? Everytime I see a picture of that disgusting old Nazi authoritarian I get sick to my stomach!
@justdeplorible @Airbornex82nd @BreitbartNews New Mexico is not a blue state. But that’s what happens when you don’t gather up the illegals and send them home!
@justdeplorible @Airbornex82nd @AOC @SpeakerPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @ericswalwell They do have a striking resemblance to those you mention, but which ones which? Which one is wearing thT disgusting dead thing on its head.
@Barracuda_Bella @KAG4All At least we can say that she practices what she preaches?
@jeepsuzih2 @RobChristie11 Love this montage! I go watch it on occasion just for shits and giggles!
@BreitbartNews You can see the contrast between sanders and trump! How dare trump run a business with more than 10.000 employees, or Bernie who has never done a damn day of honest labor,  and never created a thing,
@marklevinshow Which list is longer? The list of countries where socialism has succeeded. Or the number of ways socialism lifts people out of poverty?
@BreitbartNews Sharpton is the biggest scam in the country. I can’t remember Trump or any other republican obsess with any race. In fact the only ones obsessing are the democrats and the left!
@mschlapp We all know what CNN is. Truth is that there will be several generations that will question the integrity of the MSM.
@charliekirk11 @AOC Wasted words! The left doesn’t have the capacity or wherewithal to acknowledge or dispute any aspect of socialism. It’s been ingrained in their brains that they are not to think independently!
@ChuckCallesto @adriennaUSA Maybe that money is sitting in big birds campaign election fund!
@Ron55_ @Paintking All three, AOC, and the two anti Semites are great gifts!
@XDan55 @NeensCa Title question who leans right and who is center left. Haley is a conservative and a leader!
@Dougs1978 @BreitbartNews The only impeachable offense is from Mrs potato head. She must have been having another bad hair day!
@DrDHennen @RL9631 @realDonaldTrump We clearly need some changes to voting laws. All ballots should be double counted. One democrat, one republican doing the counting or observing the counts.  Mail in votes must be serialized and certified. If we don’t deal with it we’re done!
@thehill I think 15 years for the crime might be a tad much. I don’t like the so called message it sends. Yes she belongs on prison, 15 years? Seriously?
@Paintking As entertains as it is, think about it. Not all see it that way. 3 plus million follow this moron. 3 million . That’s a lot of idiots!
@Jenn198523 @Dougs1978 The Dems will ignore it. The rinos will ignore it. The left wants cheap labor, and auto- votes! The rinos are supporting the Koch brothers who want cheap lBor and wage control. Rinos who voted against trump on this issue need to go. No excuses!
@Booterslp I did google it! It’s just liberal fodder. We all know that Wikipedia has a generous helping of bias in some of their write ups. But it helps democrats explain, explain their great compassionate history!
@secretstranger9 @JanetTxBlessed But seriously, is trump going to put that lipstick on Hillary.....I was wondering since Hilary mentioned that lipstick and a pig?
@AshleyW838 @JohnnyB371 That looks about right, doesn’t it!
@mutts4me_sherri @JanetTxBlessed @digg Bet every non libtard can tell how the went! Even without reading any of it !!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Do you actually expect one of those democrats to respond intelligently?
@sandy45_2020 @flyby2474 @GOP This is partially the fault of republican politicians! They allowed the Dems to guilt them. Illegal aliens are here illegally! They’re not imigrants! They’re legally aliens to the US. They don’t belong in this country. They’re draining resources, with no return!
@CharlieDaniels @MarilynB777 The libs destroyed our educational system. Our students rank dead last among top 40 developed countries. 4 years in a row! And we spend the most per student. Basically they are graduating imbeciles. Any doubts? See latest IQ falloff amongst millennials!
@rosedixontx @AOC She should check the Dems list. My bet is the swamp weasel governor will put AOC on a must replace list as an offering to AMAzon in hopes of getting them back.  Cuomo has been reaching out to amazon!
@RealSaavedra I’d bet no one will find it. Might check the Grand Caymen Islands!
This can’t be.  Every last libtard will tell you the day after Trump declared his presidency run, he became a racist. And he will remain a racist until he leaves office! https://t.co/7jL9HJzDdr
@LaylaAlisha11 @gaye_gallops Dems are the party of hate. Biden’s a dem. That’s his choice. Biden is a centrist moron! He’d be like a dumber version of jimmy Carter!
@KamalaHarris Your party is setting the stage for how you will be treated if you ever were elected. Every graphic detail of every sexual act you engaged in with on top of or under Wilkie will come out. The Dems set the stage for four years of non stop investigations!
@Booterslp I don’t know a thing about the southern strategy. I only know southern democrats were and still are disgraceful! I thought you were a millennial because of the way you came across with the racist accusations. Most millennials when they are challenged pull out the race card.
@sxdoc @RoxxxyGurL Ralph snd company should bail out of politics and stock exclusively to killing babies.
@RealSaavedra Like most kids growing up, at about age 8, I New there was no tooth fairy, and no Santa!  Bernie still thinks both still exist. The worlds not ready to take on climate change, especially since there’s no consensus that it is a problem.  You have to crawl before you walk Bernie!
@BreitbartNews I don’t care who he is. That person needs to be deported. Why have laws if you can just break them snd stuff it on everyone’s face!
@thehill Common sense governing for sure! It’s beyond stupid scary to think that the same morons that want free flow of illegals aliens, would even venture to think doing without a vacines, is a good idea!
@NancyJKoch @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump AOC  is excellent at getting press. But that’s the end of the line. If she had a functioning brain she’d be dangerous. But thats not the case. And let’s be thankful she is that stupid!
@gatewaypundit She’s a libtard socialist, what do you expect?
He’s got such an exemplary record. A grownup version of AOC. The US is responsible for &gt;&lt;	20% of the worlds so called pollution, yet libtards believe we can impose significantly more taxes on our citizens, while China an India, collectively represent double. https://t.co/tFPAMCmSUC
A little piece of history, for those millennials and others that have fallen victim to our censored educational system.  @Booterslp https://t.co/nWT0Q4IQoq
@Dougs1978 @BreitbartNews Now the libtards would get in these people’s face if they were republicans. This is. Problem. When we see people promoting murder, we should get in their faces about it!
@Dougs1978 @BreitbartNews Just how ignorant are the so called newer congress chicks! Not to be disrespectful, but they haven’t yet earned the title of congressman/congresswoman!
@Acosta They got questions because they are journalists that report the news. You on the other hand think you are a journalist with a mission to create the news. The right people got the questions!
@Navy_Lady_45 @realDonaldTrump @gatewaypundit Someone should tell this fascist phuck, the only one getting overthrow is her and her two anti Semite friends!
@Diehard45C @NydiaVelazquez @SpeakerPelosi @SecretService @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump @gatewaypundit So they ask us why we need the second amendment. Someone should tell her it to keep ourselves protected from people like her and AOC. Fascist libtards have all been exposed for what they are! Thank you President Trump!
@NRO @RameshPonnuru I love when people without a clue lecture on a subject they don’t understand, like taxes. I’ll keep it simple. If you get a tax refund, you screwed up. If you get a large refund every year, you are not smart. If you get no refund,or pay a little, then you’ve done well!
@Booterslp @Bakari_Sellers Yes you did. I don’t give anytime to an article published by a hard leftist publication. I do understand what  racism looks like, and I don’t like it. I don’t need Vox or their hard left opinions on what’s racist. Most leftists I know are racists.
@ladydwinter @KatTheHammer1 @Change She is a disgusting racist. Shes an anti Semite. But she was elected. We need to take what she gives, and use it to present a civilized case that she shouldn’t be re elected. The time to organize and find a person that can beat her in an election is now!
@rcktnpnts @pinkk9lover @ROCKONOHIO @JoeBiden @BestBrownsFan @AppSame @Chicago1Ray @LVNancy @DaRealGrizzle @SuperEliteTexan @bbusa617 @MazurikL @magastorybook Couldn’t tell if that was hilly or kamala? But I’m color blind!
@legacy_joey @ihvurbk22 Love my boxer. You guys do awesome work for a wonderful, maybe a little crazy breed of dog!  Keep up the good work
@katsund4 @pinkk9lover @KamalaHarris @BestBrownsFan @ROCKONOHIO @AppSame @DaRealGrizzle @PhilMcCrackin44 @ArizonaKayte @SuperEliteTexan @bbusa617 @KatTheHammer1 @KAG4All I call it racing to the bottom!
@yogagenie Kind of like the voting on the wall. Sorry Chuck! Suck it up buttercup !
@bud_cann Pretty effective especially from Somalia, if you know what I mean. They’ve loaded up the fifth district of Minnesota to such a degree that we now have a representative from Hamas in our congress!
@SoutheastNative @thehill Let’s not forget how he screwed healthcare up. Not to forget about if you like your doctor you can keep him! What about imprisoning that Iranian movie maker! What about spying on that fox reporter! Or spying on trump!
@SoutheastNative @thehill I didn’t call him a crook! I called him a crock! As in crock of shit! Trumps not perfect, but weaponizing the IRS, the DOJ, the FBI? Sending Susan Rice our to lie about Benghazi? Trading four terrorists for a coward? Giving 150 billion to a terrorist regime. That’s just a start!
@justdeplorible @JohnnyB371 That’s an awesome post!
@gatewaypundit @SenAlexander Rhino? No! Lamar’s just another butt buddy for the Koch brothers! They don’t want the wall. They contributed to several democrats the past election, just to block funding for a wall.
@SoutheastNative @thehill False allegations? Get a grip. The mans a worthless crock of crap that lost any semblance of respect the day he encouraged people to resist another president!
@willchamberlain @steph93065 There’s going to be some painful losses in GOP Senate. Basically every one that votes against trump should be primaried because the won’t get re elected. Right Mr Tillis, and ms collins
@CraigAr64 Trump let Kim know, he’s not desperate for a deal. Pretty simple. Pelosi is well aware that we were so close to a full scale war, yet she’d rather make it about who won and who lost!
@marklevinshow Trump probably wanted to engage intelligent journalists not a sniveling fool!
@WayneDupreeShow It’s almost disgusting, but somehow libtardish is more appropriate. Obutthole was a horrible divisive pr@@k, than fanned the flames or racism, and laid the groundwork for dividing this country into two distinctive sects. Barbaric liberals, and hard working American patriots!
@DailyCaller Many of those countries are Muslim countries. But libs have a hands-off policy about calling out Muslim crimes against humanity! I personally believe that libs identify well with most Muslims, especially those that are always angry!
@gatewaypundit Civil war? She thinks she’s still in Somalia? How cute! Someone should tell her that we elect our presidents, we don’t overthrow them!
@SoutheastNative @thehill Richard Nixon didn’t turn in his license when he became president. Where does it say you have to turn your license in? Bottom line there are many people with licenses that don’t turn them in when they deviate. But who really cares?
@SenateGOP We generate 13% of the worlds emission! China and India are 33% what good  is 18% when the rest of the world is polluting away! Get real
@SoutheastNative @thehill Whatever. Bottom line he’s has no license and can’t practice law. Call it what you want. I don’t know anyone that goes to school college and law school passes the bar exam and then gives it up. Just tosses it. Think objectively!
@BreitbartNews Adam shit talking about anyone’s credibility is a joke. He has zero credibility amongst his peers, not to mention the witness tampering.
@SoutheastNative @thehill You must mean I am mistaken, and the liberal in you decided that anyone that makes a mistake is a liar. You liberals are just to good !
@RobChristie11 There’s a few missing. My guess is they all finish at the exact same moment giving new meaning to a dead heat.
@MusingsByGritXO @Jenn198523 The only racist on question is Talib. Pretty standard groupthink on her part.
@RodStryker @CajunChick25 Agree, agree, agree! Being pro choice or pro life is an independent decision. Being leftist is 100% groupthink, so it’s more about submissiveness to the hive, than feminism and the implied independent thought.
@tweeterposter @Airbornex82nd @POTUS The millennials and snowflakes treat Snopes as a God of fact checking.Not true. Jones is scary at times, ok at times. But if I’m unfamiliar with a jones topic I will research more thoroughly.
@ACTBrigitte @peterboykin I can think of a few great captions for ‘this picture, but I know I’d get banned from twitter!
@Airbornex82nd @POTUS Snopes is a fake fact checking leftist answer to Alex Jones. Extremists can never be sanctioned or believed for their word or their work!
If Bill Barr is right for the job, they will investigate Yates and his gaggle of liars, bring down the hammer, like they did for Manafort. And see if Barrack ordered the unmasking, spying, and the turning the DOJ into Obutthole’s own third Reich! Then we’ll see who gets what! https://t.co/ttSRGJtS3P
@RyanAFournier It’s all part of TDS. That’s the disease that afflicts the brain and the rectum. It’s when brain fuses with the rectum. It becomes obvious when the person begins talking through their ass.
@Don_Vito_08 Theres no predicate to assimilate to become US citizen. just an oath for allegiance and to respect of law. Marrying your brother for immigration purposes is fraud and disrespect for our countries laws! Grounds for  citizenship revocation!
@SoutheastNative @thehill I didn’t say anything in any of my comments about whether they engaged in or were disciplined for doing something unethical. I only stated a fact. To clarify, they can no longer practice law.
@PatriotJenn @MBOKSR_MAGA The difficulty of living in a Libpocrocy bubble! It tests and exposes the real hypocrites.
@We_R_TheMedia @alexiaameriica @RashidaTlaib If anything Talib is guilty of racism for accusing someone of color for not having the capability to determine if their smart enough to know their being used because of their skin color. That’s hardcore racism!
@OANN @JBaker31826004 It’s just Cuomos way of saying, if you think you have second amendment rights, go find a different state to live in.
@RobChristie11 @FoxNews Not at all. Just having the ability to say “no”. In theory I believe Kim tested Trump, for desperation of a “Win” for political reasons. Trump didn’t bite!
@Bakari_Sellers What never surprises me is that some people, use racism as a tool for their debates. Check your race card at the door. It’s old, tired, warn out, and discounts real acts of racism.
@BreitbartNews Why? Someone should break the news to her. We are not, repeat we are not interested in her body, or her mind.
@SoutheastNative @thehill I don’t care why your BS says. They surrendered their BAR licenses, to avoid them being suspended.and then debarred. That’s a fact!
@Booterslp @Bakari_Sellers Calling me a snowflake would get me riled up! Calling trump a racist? No that’s an opinion, since you have no facts. You do know what they say about opinions, right?
@SoutheastNative @thehill Good point! Well he can surrender his law licenses to avoid debarment just like the Obutthole’s . Not much difference!
@thehill Just think if he gets debarred he can be just like Barrack and Michelle!
@Booterslp @Bakari_Sellers You presented shit, you didn’t present facts! I grew up with a strong democrat racist for a father.  I listened to him and his democrat buddies, count the nmber of Black and Hispanic families living in one of the grreat white ghettos in NY. I know what racism looks like.
@NevadaJack2 @Jewel4Trump I want what he’s smoking and drinking.
@PerspicaciousXY @ATX_PATRIOT She always looks pretty sad.  Just saying  𗂟
While Trump tries to change the world. This says a lot about democrats. 2 years ago we were planning a war, maybe having to send our children to fight in a war with most likely nuclear events and tragic outcomes. Nice job Chuck! https://t.co/1yWbbz8wQX
How many times must a liar tell lies, before he’s call irrelevant ? Nice try Dems! Next lie please?https://t.co/MdRsQNGilt
I guess this is who we are becoming? This is such a sad statement by a huge banking institution. This can’t be our future.  https://t.co/Bjpy01AQ7t
@BillMcCombs3 @Caliicoder3 No coincidence. If you recall, it was rescheduled just for the purpose of perfectly aligning with  Trumps negotiations in NK.  A hall of shame moment.
@Deplorable_Man @John_R_Berna Live in a small rural community in Va. for the last six years I have voted at the same polling district. My neighbor works as a poll worker. Each time I voted, I say hello, we chat, and then he asks for my ID, before I get my ballot. That’s the way it’s supposed to work!
@PastorDScott Of course he’s still lying. He’s been coached by Clinton’s lawyer, Elijah Cummings and Adam shit.
@ShellyCov Is anyone surprised? When was the last time CNN engaged in objective responsible journalism?
@thehill He’s right we are shifting more firmly toward trump than ever before. Steyer is complete total scum. The worst type of human there is. Go phuk off mr Steyer.
@Booterslp @Bakari_Sellers Is it any worse than Hillary Clinton’s? I never heard Trump call troubled black youths,  predators. That’s racist. Trumps not a champion of black folks, but he’s not a racist either. He’s done a bit with the insane criminal code. That does help.
@Bakari_Sellers Your right about Black face. Don’t know anyone, that is still stuck in that 1960’s and before southern democrat behavior. Not going to defend trump, but let’s not create fiction, stick to facts. Don’t see anything from trump that adversely impacts black people!
@allahpundit @guypbenson Jim Jordan did a good job!
@Airbornex82nd She comes from the fifth district of Minn. She was elected . Unlike the democrats, we don’t get rid of elected officials. We vote them out of office. She provides a wealth of talking points, and anti Semitic behavior. Republicans need to make Dems own her!
@phillyeaglesfa1 At the very least, in accordance with the attempts to block trumps wall funding, this is the least McConnel can do for the Dems! It used to be referred to as quid pro quo!
@USChamber Of course free markets are going to bring  better healthcare and drugs. But foreign prices are much lower? Why are we paying sometimes double what Europeans pay for the exact same drugs?  Tell Biden and Booker we know their both owned by drug manufacturers.  Tell them to stop!
@flipperlover64 @RealTT2020 How do you know when a liberal is lying? When they move their lips! How do you stop them from lying? You shoot them, until their lips stop moving!
@JBaker31826004 Nobody gets it! Take a look at US educational rankings amongst top 40 first world countries. Dead last! Now look at latest IQ concerning millennials! Surprise down 15% more from gen x! currently graduating imbeciles now, and they are saying is “ it only goes down from hear!
@phillyeaglesfa1 @BreitbartNews What are they going to produce? Little Obutthole’s? Oh no! Please no! We don’t want to see that!
@karli_bonne @HLAurora63 It’s one giant clusterfuxx against trump! If he had anything credible to say, he’d have told Mueller about it, not saved it for a bunch if halfwits, freaks, and sideshow shitburds!
@ItsAbout1A2A @Caliicoder3 Look to Venezuela, see what happens when socialists take your guns. Democrats are no different and most can’t condemn Venezuela. Their socialists. Can’t give an inch. No where in constitution dies it address background checks!
@KatrinaPierson Well New Yorkers deserve it. They elected a barbaric murdering thug! Can’t expect it to stop.
@JohnnyB371 Human rights? Socialism? That’s really an oxymoron! Throughout history and the world, a socialists view of human rights is generally twisted and defined by the leader. Sanders is a pathetic little man!
@GlutenFreeGanja @mattgaetz What a great idea. Let’s make a list of all the morons that call themselves democrats and then we can post the same Bar information relative to each of them, if you can actually find one that isn’t disbarred!
@mattgaetz Leave it to. Liberal to ask really stupid questions .
@MarkWarner No you don’t Mark! You hate our great country. Do you understand the incremental development of ballistic weapons? If you did then you would understand how big a deal it is that NK stopped testing!
@senatemajldr No Shit! Call them what they are! Barbaric! Their the party of barbarian practices, hate, and Nazi fascism!
@johnwoolf @LazyMeatball @BreitbartNews You found a picture of the most ignorant human on the planet! Congrats!
@chowdallas @LazyMeatball Barrack Obutthole successfully divided this country! Still remember his lectures on who we are! Go know he was spying on trump.
@SenWarren @SenateGOP You’re a proven liar! You just voted to allow newborn infants to die. You’re more barbarian than you are Indian!!
@SKYRIDER4538 @MazurikL @realDonaldTrump Well said!
@GOPChairwoman @Fortuna78543722 These are the same people who support infanticide? Nazis? Ike those at Berkeley that shun free speech? Nazis? Like those that harass Trump supporters? Get her a mirror if she wants to see a nazii
@BreitbartNews Where do these people get these ignorant notions? How stupid is enough? It’s almost like these moronic fools try to out do each other.
@DoingRight1 @PaulieD55 No prison time for the queen pig, firing squad!
@CajunChick25 Who is Venmo? Clearly they are libtarded
@RealSaavedra Good. So maybe he ought to find a place that is better to live, and move!
@thehill This is the prize. Keep your eyes on the prize. Weaponized the IRS, overthrew the elected democracy of Egypt ! Killed kadafy after we promised him safety in trade for giving up arms. Spies on opposition candidates. Lied to the world on Benghazi. He needs credit!
@JeanneInTexas @BernieSanders He’s got some great 200k sports cars .  He sure looks awkward in his Audi R7. . Far cry from an enviro friendly Prius.
@susan_giannini @CajunChick25 Evil bastards? No! Vicious barbaric animals.  We should call it like it is. Allowing an infant fully breathing to just die. We treat murderers with more respect.
@dbongino As long as they don’t have to pay for anything those morons are ok with it.  When th 50-60 % fed tax, the 15% vat tax plus state and city taxes are paid its great. Problem for those dumb shmucks is everybody gets taxed. Right down to the lowest minimum wage.
@DailyCaller She doesn’t have any ancestors. Her parakeet, has more Native American blood then she does, and at 1/2020th that ain’t saying much.
@BreitbartNews Which terror plot might that be? The one where we try and screw Trump while he’s negotiTing with North Korea? That’s a real terror plot!
@WayneDupreeShow Funny trump is not s democrat. There are no Republican plantation owners! Never was, never will be.
@DailyCaller Yep! It isn’t unless it’s to the advantage of the democrats. So do us a big favor, go move to Venezuela. Much better, and someone of your level of integrity will fit right in over there!
@Caliicoder3 Their just not American. Socialists are socialists. Life sucks and it can’t get better, unless you live those breadlines!
@BreitbartNews Who is this moron going to pay these reparations to? Nice for him to be so generous with other people’s money.  Socialist moron!
@Dougs1978 @BreitbartNews No problem for socialists. Ya just print the money and away you go!
@DailyCaller Our standard of living is fine, however, seeing Sanders fondness for Maduro and Castro sounds the alarm, that with yo-yo Mr Sanders, our standard of living would be no better then Venezuela or Cuba!
@HouseGOP It is time we start considering the left a mentally deranged and flawed j
@Caliicoder3 @AugustinaG_C @realDonaldTrump No surprises here, just Libpocrocy as usual!
@LATAMforTRUMP @TrumperSeaney @Lrihendry There is little doubt that our great  country is at extreme risk, given the mentality and madness we have seen from the left. It’s time folks to consider options. Watch the people that hate this country destroy it, or perhaps it’s time to confront it!
@maziehirono . Not sure how you can sleep at night. No human should ever make a decision to let someone die that has no voice.  I hope someday you are judged based on your contempt for human life
@seanhannity She’s the morons, moron!  Yet there are people ignorant enough to continually give her airtime, FaceTime, print time and network coverage.
@thehill Another dirty politician! All the Republicans who receive donations from the Koch brothers are against strong immigration! This pig, is dirty!
@charliekirk11 @WarriorsFake Democrats are filthy animals. Their not human!
@GabriellaR613 @OutOfRegister You can’t keep the country safe if liberals exist.
@AylaForTrump Three genders. That’s it! Male, Female, and liberal!
@BreitbartNews This guy, one of the libtards finest. What most of us call a morons moron! The democrats proudly display this shmuck, anyone else would bury him!
@JohnCornyn These are the same people that are up on arms about separating illegal Alien children at the border. Yet they can murder them on demand.
@RealSaavedra Of course the US would become a Socialist country. Of course the socialist pig refuses to say it. He supports Maduro, and Castro and thinks it’s great to wait on line for bread.
To bad her parents didn’t ask this same question https://t.co/GCQJ3lRtdI
@RealSaavedra Try and tell this to a Moronnial! You get chaos in their response. They melt down, and immediately call you a denier! Ask for indisputable evidence, that is not predicated on assumptions, they get puzzled, don’t understand, become irate, and quickly become catatonic!
@SenTedCruz @SenSasse It’s no surprise. Some, like Tim Kaine, blame his no vote on tricky language in the very straight forward bill. The democrats have no morals.
There is one thing consistent with all that testify. Goal  is to keep a fresh stock of illegal aliens available for emp,  incl, farming, other agricu, construction, restaurant services, Domestic Services.  includ landscaping.  The Koch brother pumped millions to democrats! https://t.co/gBAwCauY9k
@WayneDupreeShow This is only the beginning. Be assured that by the tome the next election comes around, at least 50 maybe more woman will come forward. With trumps surge in  black support, many claims will be from people of color. That democrats!
@peterboykin Ugh! Because the Koch brothers are against the wall! They want cheap illegal alien labor!
@StandSuperyaya Good point!
@StandSuperyaya A little old news!
@IngrahamAngle Sorry to hear about Reid’s cancer, was hoping to declare good riddens to one old Libtart, thief!
@johncardillo You must have missed the sign that stated, caution Babbling idiot is about to babble!
@BreitbartNews Spikes still thinking Obutthole, king of hate, is still president! To bad Spike, in 2016, America, said enough hate, no more Democrats for a while!
@realDonaldTrump Change strategy. We all know that some republicans have Koch brothers as major donor! Koch brothers have been quite vocal on demands for more illegal aliens! It’s about who’s clean, and who’s dirty!
@realDonaldTrump Spike lee is so full of hatred he’s been blinded by it. We got sick and tired of hate, we had 8 years of hate under Obutthole! If we wanted hAte we’d have voted democrat!
@thecjpearson @Unite4Truth It’s always going to be the same response the liberals give about everything. “Do as I say, not as I do” the great liberal lie”. Liberals are so full of  BS! All part of the  great Libtart hypocrisy
@WayneDupreeShow Suggest we consider refusing to sign off on any state budget until New Jersey follows immigration law! Won’t hold up in SCOTUS.
@Jenn198523 It’s called a babbling idiot. Thankful there is nobody in GOP that is this stupid, and doesn’t know it. There are lots of millennials this ignorant, yet highly self confident! There is a term for this condition, just not coming to me, right now!
@bud_cann I think everyone has it wrong about Bezos! I believe he canceled the deal to send a message, to the politicians on the left, re: socialism. This pullout put a spot light on socialism failing. Bezos had several options he could have used, to get AOC under control! My opinion!

@DailyCaller We call it libtarded.  Or demoralizing. Complete total libtardation!
@gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 It’s turned into a show for the libtards. Woohoo. Missing it again.
@DailyCaller Goodbye kamala, the country needs a president that’s a leader.  Clearly that’s not you!
@rosedixontx @AOC Surprise? She’s a democrat. All democrats lie. She dumber than a rock has the IQ of a sloth, and millennials think she’s the best thing since sliced bread!
@IngrahamAngle No Jews are to frigging stupid to abandon the people that hate them. How many remember what Barrack Obutthole did to Israel at the UN!
@BreitbartNews This fat slob jack ass makes you-laugh. Obutthole was the first and only president that put our democracy at risk! Forget he weaponized the DOJ, the FBI, and the IRS! That’s what puts a democracy at risk.

@nytimes Ugh! Your fake news! No I don’t think so!
@Dougs1978 @BreitbartNews The problem with Bernie is that he cznt condemn the zcts of Maduro! He’s a sick phuck!
@BreitbartNews Yep he does! Right after he does his time in the big house!
@13_cupcakes @SpeakerPelosi Piglosi is an unintelligent skank. But she has her politics down! Anytime she’s not caught sucking on her dentures, she’s dangerous!
@Jali_Cat @ReneeCarrollAZ @RepAdamSchiff Let’s also get going on Hillary Clinton’s emails and the unmasking of Americans under the Obutthole administration! Hey adam were really sorry about the micropenis syndrome your dealing with. You should know that .6% of men on the US have this same problem!
@SuperEliteTexan @KamalaHarris It’s scumbag socialists like yourself that make us want to stay armed. Take a look at Venezuela. That’s what happens when the left takes guns away. Your nothing more than a female Maduro!
Reparations? I think any ex slave that’s still alive should receive reparations! For everyone else, this is an act of pandering racists! https://t.co/XCjc0hLy6p
@MsAvaArmstrong The big question is how much will it cost Kamala for Sharptons support
@TrumperSeaney @SenSanders The man that refused to condemn Maduro.  Bernie is a socialist . Socialists were responsible for the death of more than 100 million people on the last 100 years. Bernie loves Castro, stares so many times. More than 1 million died under his regime.
@sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein This is a sad commentary! Hitler called it the youth movement, what are we going to call it?
@politico There are roughly three million people homeless. Walking SF, you have to watch that you don’t step in human feces. When the market drops California will default on pensions! Then the fun begins!
@BryonnyM @EdIsBackKAG2020 I blame it on the guy with the hat! He allowed it to happen. Time to stiffen up. Make the person pay for his libtarded decision to deny free speech. Make or female shouldn’t matter.
@veryhip4u @cheri4trump Kind of the same way liberalism and roaches spread. Very little difference!
@Thomas1774Paine @ihvurbk22 This means she’s receiving large donor contributions from Koch brothers or one of the democrat scumbags that wants cheap uninterrupted flow of illegal alien labor!
These kids may not have any intelligence, but they sure know how to be liberal activists! Absolutely disgusting! https://t.co/SBbRVRq5Rk
@usminority The old I have a drug problem, typical liberal excuse! After his long prison sentence!
Dear Maxine, the beauty of being a potato head, is that you don’t have to think! Besides, whoever heard of a potato head that thinks? https://t.co/BCACVcRWw8
@AOC Are you talking Capitalist standards, or socialist standards. 52K is not a living wage in NYC or DC!  it’s a survival wage.
@dmills3710 @POTUS Kamala Harris is going to be a formidable candidate. She’s digging up some good stuff.
@JamesWStork How can that be snowflake? Real American President, vs real anti American President. Your comparing a real man to a schill.
@NancyJKoch Lemons a shit weasel. He’s nothing more than a racebaiting libtard!
@robertdunlap947 @sherrynron It’s called small penis syndrome. Adam Shit has all the classic symptoms. In Adams case, it’s usually referred to as micropenis this disease is suffered by .6% of American men!
This is all about losing the black vote. After decades African Americans are waking up and walking away. So what’s left? PANDERING!!! https://t.co/yAsCRUFOJH
@KAG4All @rosedixontx If she’s a US citizen, that’s ok. Put her on trial for treason. Let her sit in max security prison for 35 years! Then after she’s done paying for her crime, she can enjoy being a citizen.
@RealBasedMAGA @winstonCovfefe Wouldn’t surprise me at all, Harris is a sleezeball!
@yogagenie @SuperEliteTexan She almost certainly is getting rolled by Sharpton . Wonder how much it will cost Harris for Reverend Al’s support?$$$$$
@kryptokoi You bet! Ad long as there’s blue states, there has to be guns!
@Airbornex82nd @AOC @POTUS It’s interesting to watch the progressives devolve and divide. Ya think Bezo’s decision to yank amazon out of New York was because of AOC? Think again! Amazon sent a message to the socialist wannabes. Just like Howard Shultz did a few weeks ago.
It’s the socialist way! Not only do they want to control the amount of money you can possess, but they want to tell you how to spend it and what you should eat! https://t.co/bH1O9uy8EJ
Just be a real racist. If your a racist democrat politician, it’s ok to beat your girl friends rape your dates or just flat out disrespect American citizens! https://t.co/aKqEmA39mD
There’s not much difference between this democrat socialist and any of the others. Their all giant dumpster fires, filled with hate, vengeance, deceit, and dishonesty. This is sad for our democracy! https://t.co/4ljFvUk76Z
Everyday we have to be thankful that dumpster fire like Sanders is not our president.  Praising Castro, killer of more than 1 million  Cubans. Ok old news? He refuses to disavow allegiance to Maduro! How the DEmocrats can run a complete demon? Beyond anyone’s imagination. https://t.co/W7148aIb5r
@KamalaHarris You’re so inspirational. You have shown what one woman, with knee pads and a smile can do , to advance. From hotel bedroom to the Oval Office. Who says capitalism isn’t great!
Maybe what we’re seeing, is a progressive new way to launch protests for higher pay. We probably want to take stock in rope makers, Aspirin manufactures, and red ball cap makers. These could become the Apple, or Amazon like growth companies throughout the next decade! https://t.co/K6rOaxgWQw
@Jali_Cat @TrumperSeaney @maddow @MaddowBlog @WhiteHouse @POTUS We’ve got his campaign slogan. Similar to MAGA. If holder runs suggest MASA, and yes the S rhymes with Truck!
@WatchnDaWorld As much as it hurts to say, and it does, she was elected by the people. It would be no different than what the Libtarts want to do with our president. Let her make those insane statements. They are gifts. Let’s just make sure we’re on top of it when re election comes around!
So you have to wonder how many of these state leaders receive monetary contributions from donors that exploit illegal aliens! Just saying! https://t.co/rGDl1Qfonv
Pretty sure Hoda can find a better country like Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, or maybe, North Korea. Then there is the democratic socialist European countries like, France, Belgium, england or Germany? Certainly those are much better choices! https://t.co/4qSUPUw7vT
How about reparations to those American Indians that didn’t get the 450k per year teaching job that Warren took because she claimed she was a Native American? https://t.co/WpdTdWVg8V
@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller Interesting double standard. Venezuela has been Bernie’s model government for years. How can he possibly condemn it! Since when do socialists actually care about their constituents?
@ShellyCov @gaye_gallops Bernie’s no different than any other socialist. Same in every European socialist country. The masses work for or are given token monthly stipends. Whether they work and get killed with high taxes or get handouts. It works out to the same or similar monthly income!
@Airbornex82nd @POTUS No doubt. This is what people elected.  It makes you wonder how ignorant can those people be that voted for her! The same with the button brain from New York, and the train wreck from Michigan. What the heck’s happened to our educational system
There’s a lot to attack. He is the original author of the bill to make gunfree zones . His daughters scandals with drug manufacturers, not to mention the stout dysfunctional relationship between many of joes family. https://t.co/7zxpITxipH
@rpwillis1 @superyayadize @KnoxBloodworth @IngrahamAngle @JobCreatorsUSA @AOC Those are democrats. That’s who they were and that’s still who the are today. They’ve reformed. They now exploit illegal aliens in the same  manner that they exploited black Americans.
@GOP Sanders is just another slimeball socialist, that embraces the suffering of Venezuelans. He has to since it was his model socialist party.  Wake up Libtards!!!!
@WayneDupreeShow TDS is a serious libtard disease. I have not 1 tiny gram of compassion for him. I know state will go light on this libtard shit show, but I have hopes that the feds give him penalty maximums . Do Jussie could be looking at free room and board for several years. 😝🤣🙁😅😸😸😸

@slacker_ga01 @Trump454545 “All the way around”. You say? I think she charges extra for special positions!
@yogagenie @Trump454545 Bernie, Likable lying Bernie, knows better. He’s antiquated, outdated, white, and is a male. Four strikes, against him in a three strike game, even Dems don’t want him!
Sounds more like Geraldo still can’t separate ethnicity from reality! https://t.co/dAY1cFXLv6
@WIRED Your probably closer to seeing Clinton, fbi, DOJ investigation’s opened than to swing fakenews. Would also think those unmasking of names and spying on trump campaign accusations could resurface! Oh did anyone tell you Barr doesn’t like Clinton’s?
Some of the democrats don’t like that Trumps trying to engage and help. Dems are calling his act to help Gays, bigoted. Just like they did when he tried to help DACA kids. https://t.co/6zZpmLr4f2
Exactly! https://t.co/JPG7A03PWW
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Pretty daring statement by someone that doesn’t have the guts to meet with angel parents, @speakerPelosi, nonetheless tell them that there isn’t an emergency.  Four thousand deaths in two years sound like an emergency to most normal people.
@WayneDupreeShow You can’t make this stuff up. She’s dumber than a rock, but is a hero to the brain dead Libtarts!
@ArthurSchwartz Ever see a liberal with balls?
Note by coincidence what political party would condemn people for their race, and associate them with a condemnation! Wasn’t FDR a Democrat? Imagine that! https://t.co/BPMuM42v7Y
@WayneDupreeShow Well she used the liberal buzzword, ignorance. She hung out and watched beheadings. She talked negatively about people living in this great country. No! She lost her big chance. Over! Done! Sorry! Better luck next time!

@peggyperez @Sekusa1 @DailyCaller Anyone who thinks the Dems are going to advance any civil rights cause for anyone, doesn’t understand their History. It’s not going to happen.
@Jewel4Trump Only on the desert east of Palm Springs to AZ border is safe for High spd  But it’s rush hour 24x7 in LA, 30 mph is an accomp. Maybe that’s how they offer no spd limits,  traffic density as usual controls speeds! Never hit 70 mph in South Bay except Sunday 5-8 am!
@Jewel4Trump Love the notion of no speed limits, that’s better then the I-20 West Texas 80mph speed limit. Low pop.  Density makes for 95 plus speeds. Lived in Cali, no way ,could they allow no speed limits on the 5 freeway.  That’s a joke! Pure suicide! Gonna take time to stop laughing!
her analogy that more business would increase property values is ascinine. Should we force out all business, this way no one will want to live in her community. That will drop those rents and property values! Her tirade just cements the notion that she is a moron! https://t.co/y671rrMaMk
@BreitbartNews Just stamp “Pathetic” on her forehead! Anyone who draws the conclusion she has made, from current facts, is afflicted with TDS.   As of today there is no available evidence of TDS reversal. That makes her deranged, doesn’t it?

@OutOfRegister It’s called cutting your losses.
@nytimes Still fake news! There is nothing independent about the New York Times! Tied to the hip and other organs! You people don’t deserve to be considered journalists!
@Bakari_Sellers I hope he’s there st the end. Imagine this 5 foot socialist standing next to 6 foot 5 trump? The visual  would say it all!
@KLSouth @TakebackUSA2 I can only recall one thing Trump has done that has been met with approval by the libtards - first step act. That’s it! That’s not good enough is it?
@Distinct_Words @Jewel4Trump @gatewaypundit Imagine what could be leaked? Masturbation videos?- Barrack and Vladimir?  Michelle getting confused as to whether to use men’s or woman’s restrooms in Moscow? The possibilities are endless, bring it on!

@JohnnyB371 @joegooding Roger is one of those outspoken supporters of everything that’s wrong with the world. Let’s not forget his anti Israel boycott. Loved Roger as a musician, but he has a keen sense for stupidity, so he should keep his politics “walled off”!

@thehill This is all they have? This is their first string team? Seriously! There’s just not a lot of there, there. Same old mix of fascist socialists, or libtarded, progressives. Lots of rotary file material!
@nytimes Yikes! You guys are clearly confused with a real newspaper. You folks are occasionally independent, but 90% tow the line with DNC. Not sure what you call that, but It’s not journalism.
@DailyCaller Yep, if we had to believe polls, Hilderbeast Clinton would be president. As long as there are dishonest politicians, we are going to have extreme opposition to securing border, and polls that suggest no support for such a move. Just do it! Secure it!
@DoingRight1 @TheTestyTarheel Yes, this woman can literally and figuratively scare the shit out of you. Great bathroom viewing material, and when your done you just wipe, wash and the smell of griffin is gone!

@hitman604 @Trump454545 You would think by now the left is accustomed to falsely accusing Trump supporters of carrying the same hate gene that is embedded into their teeny tiny brain membranes. Pretty sure any remorse is fake!
@ASimplePatriot @Trump454545 So basically the DNC has made the case for no background checks. End of story, case closed!
@BigJimLedbetter @Pedal2DMetals She’s still peddling that story. 1/2020th of truth.
@DailyCaller I believe we should take a year off of football viewing and let them fester alone in their ignorant libtard decision making!
@Breaking911 @sweetromance Her story should serve as a lesson, but let’s step back and quietly allow her to deal with the liberal government bureaucracy! I’m sure it will take her years to straighten her mess out.    Enjoy!

@WayneDupreeShow Nobody wants the baggage that he brings. His skills were in significant and steady decline. Don’t see him as a third string Qb!
@lilbulli1031 @joegooding @TomPerez @MeetThePress @POTUS The truth is there isn’t anything about socialism that pulls people from poverty to prosperity. Socialism levels the field and makes everyone dependents to a system that inspires mediocrity. Is that where we want to go?
@ShellyCov @gaye_gallops Lacking  the ability to forgive , makes us no better than Your average house liberal!  It appears she broke no laws! So if she’s clean then she should have to figure out how to deal with the system and get back into the country, without help from anyone, back of the line!

@cmg_48 @MsAvaArmstrong @MBOKSR_MAGA Agree that is a problem, but it’s a  problem created by district administrators. They’re more interested in getting credit for the student being in their district, then whether their teachers are equipped or have the ability to communicate with enrollees.

@LazyMeatball The sad truth, the people that voted for her, are probably sitting on their sofas at home patting each other on the back and singing praise. Those are her supporters, her base, they think she’s a go getter!
@standfortruth10 @LazyMeatball She understood what she was saying. Enjoy the giant budget , feast! Sarcasm!!! Shame on republicans!
This is actually a larger crisis than our southern border crisis. Stray liberals can be easily identified by their propensity to become frazzled at the sight of a MAGA hat. https://t.co/VSpYIOCyJS
@ChrisMurphyCT Sorry, there’s a little thing called the constitution designed to safe guard us from lunatics on the left!
He certainly belongs on the outside looking in, question is does he get to leave on his own accord or is he marched out in matching bracelets! Somehow I think the man needs a little drama! https://t.co/Od6w96hzrG
@RyanAFournier Your forgetting a few. The Hoe, Spartacus, the snow queen and the weather vane.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump If this crisis is manufactured why do you keep running away from those Angel Moms that keep stopping by your office?
@HLAurora63 @Dougs1978 @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @chuckschumer @Ilhan Talk about radical racists. More black babies aborted in nyc last year, then born. Looks like planned parenthood is finally delivering on their goals and ideals! Is this a good stat? But it’s a true stat!
@BreitbartNews AOC is the best thing to happen to republicans
@LawWorksAction Right after Barr appoints a special counsel to look into potential treason from top fbi and DOJ officials, and all things related to spying on trump, all mueller findings should be released!
RT @LawWorksAction: William Barr MUST commit to the public release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report and findings — and if Barr fa…
@CR The dictionary defines actions committed to obstruct the results of a free election as an act of treason.
Do you really think this guy, this racist liberal is going to resign. That would be the appropriate thing, but guys that don’t see a problem with murdering newborns are not going to have or display anything resembling a moral! https://t.co/9hiY8TwTOr
@SuperEliteTexan @BobMenendezNJ @RepSusanDavis Do you really expect one of these blood sucking liars to actually acknowledge that their new voting base is in the country illegally? Or that the guys mowing their lawns for 20% of what a citizen might charge are problematic? Not going to happen!
@Navy_Lady_45 @Patriot988 @SpeakerPelosi Your wasting your anguish. Pelosi probably receives 10-15 million an election cycle to keep the hoppers filled with fresh  illegals who  will do general labor tasks at 50 cents on the dollar.
@JussieSmollett @AOC I hope your better at activism than you are at filing false  police reports?
@Pedal2DMetals @Jamierodr10 I like to call every breath Schmuck Chumer takes as Cynical. So do we start to say the Dems are getting beaten up with the AOC uglystick?
@Patriot988 @Jenn198523 Somebody should ask her what she’s going to suggest be done with all of the tax benefit they don’t give to amazon. Complement  her genius. Finally somebody gets to tell her that with no Amazon, generating revenenue, there is no dollars to save! I can’t make this shit up!
@LaylaAlisha11 @Airbornex82nd @POTUS This is called treason.
@CLewandowski_ @LindseyGrahamSC Nobody really gets it! What McCabe discussed on 60 minutes. The attempt to overthrow the acts of a sovereign nation , meets the very definition of Treason! Why are they( Comey, MCCabe, and that entire shot show) running around free!
@ewarren Who the heck is Bruce? The old guy or the dog?
@Jali_Cat @Jenn198523 @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer This really is quite simple! Many Dems and many republicans have no desire to build the wall. It’s about cheap labor and payback to donors who float big bucks to pascal, just to keep those flood gates st the border open !
@ElishaKrauss @benshapiro @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker Your waiting for Spartucus and the Hoe?  Not going to happen. Spartacus is our chasing male bathroom attendants, and the Hoe is getting high and trying to locate those old Tupac and Snoop records she used to listen to!
@benshapiro I never had s doubt that this SOB lied. Let’s wait and see how long it takes CPD to get his fired ass and throw it where it belongs!
@BreitbartNews Want even aware that RBG was still alive. Good for her
@BreitbartNews Dignity? Yep that’s what we call Trump. Mr Dignity, and make no mistake, he’s coming Back for six years!
@BreitbartNews Nobody believes him! That should make him pissed off at the world
@HillaryClinton @IndivisibleTeam We should tell congress we want our woman to have same pay standards you practiced. Right?
@thejasonhopkins @DailyCaller Never mind her anti Semitic behavior. She appears to be involved in immigration fraud. She seems to be. Arrived to her brother. How can it be that in 2001-2002 they lived st the same address and had the same dad? There’s a rat here somewhere!
@DailyCaller Time to get a better understanding of Omar’s life! Seems she is married to a man that has the same father as she does. According to records in 2002 they had same father and lived at same address. How is this possible. Is it immigration fraud?
@LoriinUtah @Jenn198523 So is it true Omar shares the same father as her husband? Is her husband her brother? Oh did she commit immigration fraud?
@ShellyCov @Jenn198523 Somebody needs to peel back the onion on this congresswomen. Is she married to her brother? Seems like this story has legs. He’d husband has the same father she has. Immigration fraud?
@AOCpress She really is stupid isn’t she?
@KatherineWolfr2 @Jenn198523 These are libtards. They’re not very smart, and they have nothing going for themselves!
@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller @VAKruta This is a democrat. What is she doing in the Congress?
@marklevinshow What’s a few little lies amongst friends?
@danielledsouzag @dartmouth Their Moronnial liberals. Do I need to say anymore?
@MAGAVoter Cory eats meat? What the heck does he think a male penis is?
@BreitbartNews Throw his lying libtard ass on jail where he belongs!
@MAGAVoter Yes love it! Tell the pig and the child molester to frigging bad!
@DailyCaller Nobody told him whether male penis is considered meat, or dairy?
@BreitbartNews Yeah, that’s because he keeps attacking his male mates in the men’s rooms.
@Dbacks @EutawBackstop Yep we did it. We got our very own catcher that will hit sound .215 a year. Yep  that’s exactly what we need!
@Dbacks Is the season over? How many games did we win? Did we win at least 70?
@charliekirk11 It’s not nice exposing Mrs potato head like that. She’s currently shaking down every bank on Wall Street, and if she’s successful will hang up her wig and roll into the sunset.
@RealJamesWoods This guy tried to get notoriety at the expense of trump supporters. Put this POS in prison. Sure he will get all the tail he can handle!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Going to let a few facts get in the way?
@ByronYork It’s the frigging Washington post! They have as much credibility as CNN or Politico has. Basically none!
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Politico said the crowd size at both trump and Bozo’s events were extremely large, dismhh
@marklevinshow There is no doubt about the green new deal being a green new joke.but there are seriously stupid millennials that think AOC is a bright star.
@WayneDupreeShow Unacceptable! Republicans did not learn a thing from the midterms did they. This is a joke. I don’t know which republicans were on the negotiating committee from the republicans side of the house, but they clearly don’t belong in the GOP.
@KamalaHarris What’s truly scary, is there are people ignorant enough to actually believe that garbage. Be honest for s change! Oh that’s right if you were honest you’d have to call yourself a liar!
@BreitbartNews Michelle who?
@BreitbartNews Free knee pads isn’t adequate, so now you want reparations? And you can champion that cause because your parents came from where? And your nationality is what? Stick to those knee pads!
@MAGAVoter It’s called Veto!
@TulsiGabbard Tulsi has made some interesting friends in the libtard party. She’s already accused of collusion with Russians!
@realDonaldTrump Hey if you happen to run into the fake Mexican, tell him hello for us!
@BreitbartNews Another jAckass that thinks because he’s Hispanic all Hispanics will vote for him. Another racist. Isn’t that how racists think??’
@RealSaavedra The democrats just can’t help who they are or what they turned into. The part of shit!
@CR Condemning is not adequate. 100% Censure. She’s more vicious than Mrs potato head!
@realDonaldTrump Murders? Murders still vote. Of course they don’t want to arrest murders. Perhaps during the next budget you refuse to provide or approve and budget that has any money going towrds sanctuary cities. See how democrats handle an unpopular issue with voters!
Steven King looks just like Pocahontas Warren with slightly shorter hair! https://t.co/29B08jvkQE
@BreitbartNews Another “crack” CNN contributor, another scripted statement. Has to be really tough working for a disenfranchised media head, where do they come up with this stuff?
@FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @nicoledarrah 7.1 million more jobs that people looking for jobs, he does need them to grow GDP, but when cycle ends or we get a libtard president what do we do with them when the jobs go away?
@BreitbartNews So which one of the declared candidates do we think took the Cheap shot at the lib from Min? My money is on Gillabrand  aka the weather vane!
@Dbacks @PapaJohnsPHX Are we done with the season yet?
@WayneDupreeShow She’s a full fledged joke. A fake Indian! A fake Indian that hates ambitious people that work hard and become rich. What a disgusting example of a human!
@JackPosobiec I’ve watched and listed to her with an open mind. She’s everybit the liar that comes with being a liberal. She’s not just stupid, she’s scary stupid! A moronic plan supported by morons!
@BreitbartNews Amazing how short sighted liberals really are! One issue? No not one issue, one package of ideals,  unambiguous and hypocrisy free.
There’s a much simpler way but will take time. The Babaric twisted Governor of New York has set the stage so perfectly, take that state law to the SCOTUS. You can’t change abortion law, but you might get a defined parameter in terms of how many weeks is acceptable! https://t.co/lA65K06fvs
@Dbacks Wow, that’ll solve the 150 run deficit or the 20 quality start loss the team faces. Is the season over yet?
@BreitbartNews If they weren’t joking they would not have behaved like a joke. Whitaker had a great temperament, and should be the pathfinder on how to deal with group think.
@RealSaavedra What a crock. Society leveled where government officials and the elite the “haves” and the general population is leveled into one great pool of “have nots”.  With only the slightest difference on living between the ambitious and the unfortunate.
@MZHemingway Seriously? What a joke and a complete fraud. He needs to be gone. Him and the rapist, both need to go!
@dbongino Come on , they were talking  about the grand kids. Adam shit is not   Man with an ounce of integrity, is he!
@BreitbartNews What that idiot is really trying to say is “deport his ass now”.
@Jenn198523 @MARINE_99ZULU @AOC You make a great point! It’s  just another chapter in the “Big Lie” .
@marklevinshow @MARINE_99ZULU We sure do have an allegiance problem!  If someone would just check the pulse of RBG we could solve this problem!
@eviefordham @DailyCaller It’s called mace, simple, non lethal, effective!
Learned a long time ago that as soon as you begin to deal with the characterizations of people by race, then there’s a high probability that you are a racist. Biden is most likely a racist! Wallace was a disgusting human with no redeeming value! https://t.co/xf0sRgT3ap
The walking talking Shitshows has not disappointed. He just thinks everyone is as dumb as he is. Their not. Blanket threats, Whitaker should tell Nadler to Phuk off! https://t.co/fIY4z3ovdq
@Dbacks @ArchieBradley7 @JakeLamb18 @RobbieRay No thanks, I’m going to spend the weekend watching paint dry!
@RepJerryNadler @HARRISFAULKNER We’ve always heard that Nadler was one of the most vile shitshows in Congress. Now we get to see it first hand.
@CollegeFix So you think this problem is limited to one university? This is a National problem. No opinions that differ from the hive are acceptable!
@WayneDupreeShow I’m going to say the same thing I said during Kavenaugh hearings. Why wait till now! This happened 20 years ago
@ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Come on now, only 200 witnesses. There’s 300+ million people living in this country. 200 is just scratching the surface! Let us know when you hit the halfway mark!
@Dbacks Wow! That’s sure to be exciting! How many wins is that move worth?
@Dbacks Most excited for fan appreciation. This season is sure to be a nightmare, so we’ll be on sleep mode this season .
@senatemajldr Libs are setting new rules. Just like they did with scotus! We approve cabinet level appointments with a majority. Dems created a nightmare for themselves!
@RealSaavedra At least she has made it clear with her endorsement that she isn’t a serious candidate and won’t be taken seriously. For a while I was concerned!
@PeteHegseth @amyklobuchar Wow! Another complete and total bitch. It’s a whole lot more fun watching democrats claw at each other. Totally awesome.
@realDonaldTrump This should be the new norm. Dems have made it clear that all presidents should be fully investigated. They won’t like it when the tables turn!
@DonaldJTrumpJr It’s called Libpocrosy. We have a racist barbarian as a Governor, a rapist as a Lt. Governor and a moronic racist as a Secretary of State.  Heck they’re  all libtarded!
@kayleighmcenany @instagram Just liberals being liberals!
@BreitbartNews Any religion that is tied to abortion sanctity is barbaric . So let’s be more careful with our words Governor Hannibal! It your belief and you morals!
@DailyCaller Ugh! Looks like the 1920 democrat KKK uniform without a hood
@ADHD_Capital So where are all the leftist woman protestors? Why is this woman any less credible then blasey Ford? Where’s the sense of urgency? Kind of like Ellison beating his girl friend and getting a pass?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @KatrinaPierson @TheAtlantic Does anyone actually expect a liberal publication to deal with decency issues?  Jemelle hill should be picked up for threatening the life of a US president! At least 69 days observation to determine if it’s TDS!
@HARRISFAULKNER She is skirting honesty. What a joke!
@DailyCaller You don’t have to be breathing to make an appearance. Was she alive or dead?
@RealSaavedra So she slings mud at the assertions and refuses to answer the question. Does the press have the calls to nail her, or just walk away tails between their legs?
@DailyCaller Chief Spreading Bull is not embarrassed but she’s sorry. This is the same maniac that shames wealthy folks for working hard making money and spending it. She’s an embarrassment to country! Keep her crap local, please!!!!!!
@GovMikeHuckabee Her vibrator batteries died during Trumps speech!  It happens.
@DailyCaller I believe Stacy Abrams was right on point. The DNC needed an angry victim to come in and slam the door on Trumps call for mutual existence for the sake of the country! How dare he!
@RyanAFournier Pretty sure she will blame her dishonesty on climate change!
@RyanAFournier Some people see her as a star, I see her more as an entire planet revolving around herself.
@DailyCaller Yep! I heard she’s going to discuss the social aspects of using your body to advance your cause in the workplace,
@eviefordham @DailyCaller She’s going to tell us how to please your boss and use specific skills to advance your career. A worthwhile watch!
@brithume She’s proved she has no conscience. We’ve always knew that someone that horribly ugly, should not have any power!, because, that is problematic
@IngrahamAngle No problem for New Yorkers! They love paying taxes. Right?
@CurtisHouck @RalphNortham We love watching liberals eat their own. Every democrat has the old sexual abuse card in their profile and can flash it and use it as required.
@JudicialWatch Tha scratches an itch and doesn’t deal with the problem. 1-2 million illegal votes made by illegals and collected after the polls closed by “vote harvesters” , legalized in California.
@NRO @jackrcrowe And anyone is surprised? By the time the week ends, we will find out that Trump paid Russians to place those pictures in that yearbook, knowing someday the jerk would be elected governor!
@AOC @SharylAttkisson This woman can shovel shit faster than Bill Clinton can drop his pants.
@WayneDupreeShow Well if nothing else we now know which side of the fence Wallace is on.
@WayneDupreeShow Whohoo! In her world of one watt AOC just had her first 2 watt moment
@MARINE_99ZULU No doubt his attackers are about as real as those Russians colluding with the trump campaign!
@WayneDupreeShow I must remember to plant some democrat resistors in the garden this spring. I heard they bloom up until the first frost of the season!
@RamsNFL I wish we didn’t call the same exact set of plays six series sets in a row. Also wished Gurley had more touches. Oh you guys forgot all about him?
@MAGAVoter Liberals!
@HananyaNaftali Israel doesn’t has the same breed of liberals as we have. Our breed is lost.
@RamsNFL Our offense was non responsive. Our D was good enough to win. We repeated the exact set of plays in six consecutive series. We played, with far more concern about beating ourselves then beating the other team.
@Dbacks @JakeLamb18 @ArchieBradley7 It is baseball season. The contenders  are fine tuning their rosters.  The pretenders are doing their accounting and determining how many more pennies they have to spend to look like they give a damn!
@thedailybeast That’s pretty darn childish or is that your stage 4 libtardation shining through. Liberals are ignorant, you people validate that thought!
@WayneDupreeShow Exactly correct. The last thing I want to see or hear is anything political during our super bowl game. Save that crap for msm and cable news!
@JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Would be a double bonus and justice would be drvrd to see this guys and tarnished with the scandal of a lifetime!
@SheriffClarke @KamalaHarris Yeah leaders should be held to a higher plane. Racism is racism, as is sleeping your way to the top.
Chief full of bull is having a party. https://t.co/Ed3s5TbjYQ
@SenGillibrand You’re proud of putting politics ahead of what’s best for the country? I wouldn’t be taking pride in accomplishing nothing positive. You’re just another worthless politician, zero accomplishments! Get lost
@SheriffClarke I can remember every silly sn stupid costume I wore in the 1980’s. Why can’t he? Point is he contradicted himself, if he doesn’t know if it was him, why’d he say he can prove he’s better than he was. Exactly what was he?
@KamalaHarris So what about politicians who use sex to advance their causes or their careers, do they have a place in politics?
@KatrinaPierson @RalphNortham @GovernorVA There’s a reason why so many planned parenthood abortion shops are located in or near black communities!
@Kenz_aFan Your team at least ya willing to try and field a contender. They just make mistakes, like loiZa, werth,and Strausberg. You guys picked up Corby. He’s dominating if you can keep him healthy. Better than loiaza!
@MLBStats @Dbacks @Nationals He also had a horrible ERA prior to the trade in September. He’s old, his best years are behind him but he was cheap!
@MZHemingway Libs are quick to gush over her offerings until they learn that nothing is really free!
@seanhannity Making sexual assault in men’s restrooms great again.
Can anyone name one accomplishment for Mr potato head? Just one please? https://t.co/w7A0GysVGT
@TomiLahren Would like to suggest and volunteer the first all female, crash test dummy teAm featuring the Hoe, Harris, Piglosi, the rock, AOC , and the fake Indian to join a team that will scale the Empire State Building, blindfolded, in a telephone booth!
@WayneDupreeShow Liar, liar, pants on fire!
@WayneDupreeShow Right after she get a full scale investigation she cSn have her award, or a prison cell!
Yep we are surely in need of some global warming. https://t.co/2W7BG4DYrI
@DailyCaller When you have no logical response, no measurable ability to rationalize on your own, you break out the old democrat rulebook and you crow!
@DailySignal Except if your a barbarian...... from China.....from North Korea... or your just a liberal.
@penelope7usa @AnnCoulter No problem! The guy will still vote democrat, what’s your point?
@Dbacks He’s as good as the tools he has in the shed! You can’t make apple pie out of a sack of lemons.
@TomiLahren Remove the word “like”. Just delete that one word and reread your tweet. There you go, more pointed and easy to understand!
@GovernorVA Seriously? Do you really think the public is that stupid. When it walks, talks, and looks like a duck, it’s probably a duck!
@MikeBrestDC @DailyCaller Who in their right mind is prepared to support S Collins in 2020?
@ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Senator who? Oh you mean Da Nang Dick? I think his name speaks for itself!
@JudicialWatch In case you guys missed it this is only the tip of the voter fraud activity in CA. Look new law that allows third party collectors to harvest votes from people that couldn’t make it to vote. The difference in all 9 seats  lost in LA, after being declated blue.
Why would democrats back democracy in another country, when they don’t want it here in the US? https://t.co/VltmRrNZWF
@NRO @jackrcrowe Everyone has a short memory about the Hoe’s behAvior, or that of the Libtart universe? Remember guilty until proven innocent behavior during Kavenaugh? Is anyone surprised?
@thehill @AnnCoulter Funny but many of today’s “crack” millennials actually think that small reduction from a paycheck will cover the costs. So how do you convince complete imbeciles it’s unaffordable unless current taxes are tripled?
@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris What the heck do you think Metoo means?
@DailyCaller I guess Da Nang Dick is getting frustrated with the facts that he’s a liar about his service time in the  military. Truth hurts!
@SarahPalinUSA Just take a look at chancy! Between the two of them which one looks credible? Go ahead take your time. Stacy abrams is going to try and convince you socialism is good and Trump is bad. Know anyone that can do that?
@JackPosobiec Is anyone surprised besides the morons at CNN and MSNBC?
@OliverMcGee @RyanAFournier @POTUS @USTreasury @DeptofDefense @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse No I won’t retweet. I want POTUS to give Nancy Piglosi a dose of her own medicine. How? Starting today and everyday until wall is fully funded send ICE to sweep piglosi’s district for all illegal aliens. Keep them coming back everyday until wall is fully funded!
@MARINE_99ZULU @Trump_World @SpeakerPelosi How do you say full of shit on piglosish
Seriously? Anyone is surprised? How is that possible? Of course she hates Jews! She’s said that dozens of times during Her campaign speeches! Why are  people surprised! https://t.co/nsC7dGRE0s
@BreitbartNews We need 2000 miles of a 30 foot high border wall, with 30 foot foundation, to block tunneling. We need all illegals that have been here for more than three years to be deported, than we can talk amnesty
Sad part is there’s lots of ignorant people in the electorate that actually think they are getting something for nothing. Just like Willie Brown did a few years back. https://t.co/cuu6r8aHvo
@parscale @Trump_World @SpeakerPelosi The problem is those voters were ignorant enough to trust a democrats word, that they weren’t Piglosi drones. Hope they learned all democrats do groupthink, and are hive driven.
@mollyfprince @DailyCaller We love Da Nang Dick. He is a perfect example of what’s wrong with libtard America!
@BreitbartNews Wondering if Al teamed up with brother Willie for a few threesomes along the way?
It’s all about optics. How Do we honor and elect, a fake war hero, a fake Indian, a senator that sleeps her way to the top, or a Kenyan President? Easy, ya make em all democrats, where “not exactly” is OK! https://t.co/znciNjO7Fw
@CR So is CR supporting the CBO? The same organization that supported Obutthole’s 2400 dollar a year savings because of Obutthole care? Don’t buy it.
@RealSaavedra @AOC Do we really care? She’s a Moronnial. She’s no different than any other IQ deprived Moronnial. Put someone out there that can think logically and present intelligent Arguments to either political side!
@THEHermanCain It’s amazing how the left is feeding their trash to the dogs.
@BreitbartNews Rubio is basically saying he’s not to be considered presidential material, disgusting snievling politician.
@GPIngersoll @DailyCaller Snopes? Snopes is no different than infowars. Ones driven by right wing whackos, the other is driven by left wing lunatics.
@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris Clearly, she got the wrong memo on what #MeToo stands for.
@DailyCaller It’s a free market. If that’s what the panthers want. So be it.
@EricTrump @NBCNews If you’re a bubble brained liberal there is no other news besides Trump. Liberals are simple creatures with single cell minds.
@realDonaldTrump We believe you will? But trying to negotiate with a pile of cow dung, like Piglosi is not a winner! Unless you lower the bar to her level.  That should start with 1 for one deportations of anyone crossing the border illegally with aliens living in piglosi’s voting district.
She’s actually quite shrewd. Love her rebuttal to anyone questioning the accuracy of her statements. “ How can anyone worry about how to pay for her pipedreams” ? https://t.co/wzfqEo7wLb
@mollyhc @BrentScher Hey! Who’s the mayor she slept with to advance her career?
@PureMichGirl @DineshDSouza Sounds like your perfect libtard presidential candidate?

@dcexaminer @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump You have to go back to  jfk to find a libtard president that gave salary away to charity!
@realDonaldTrump Yep and many are on this country voting for democrats. It’s s big ugly lie. Compliments of the American taxpayer!
@BillKristol Thought you were dead? Oh that’s just your publication that died!
@JShahryar Ann, Sears her feelings on her sleeve. Asshole? No that would be any Jew that votes for the party that hate them. Get a mirror and take a good long look!
@ChrisMurphyCT Kind of like the governmental structure of Connecticut, a big shit sandwich!
@RepAdamSchiff I believe lying disgusting pigs like yourself are the primary reason this country was shut to begin with!
@KamalaHarris Compassion? Not this pig! This pig is a frigging authoritarian bubble head!
@DailyCaller It’s amazing how much of a fraud these so called leftist elites are. If it’s so dang immoral, he should feel free to send his weath to Great socialist Mecca’s like Venezuela and Cuba!
@BreitbartNews It’s amazing what goes through the minds of libtards. They all think that Barrack Obutthole is still in office.
@RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Perhaps when congress renamed her little Adolph instead of Madam speaker, she’ll take notice. Then again isn’t liberalism all about authoritarian group think?
Every Scandinavian country has em, every socialist country has them. Their designed to eliminate middle and upper middle classes, and create two classes. The haves and the have nots! 90+% of socialists live without disposable income. https://t.co/UBfMoiYnD5
@realDonaldTrump It’s called “silent guardian “, US has them, their non lethal, and 100% effective.  It’s an invisible barrier. Why aren’t they deployed at the border.
@BreitbartNews What have we learned about liberals? Every time they make a statement and claim they don’t,............... no reason to believe it’s different this time!
@BreitbartNews Take away Chumers supply of fresh young 12 year olds, and suddenly he becomes clear headed.
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller My parents? Ok let’s get something straight, I’m not s snowflake, or a Moronnial. You actually mAke me laugh! Thanks I needed that!
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller No they didn’t! I treat everyone the same!
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller Well I guess I’m just a disrespectful little shit. But that’s ok, I’m ok with me, as a little shit! But I’d never call myself, “ not for everyone” that Implies uniqueness or something special! That’s not you!
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller Ouch! Maybe I’ll search for some safe space. You picked the wrong person to try to slime!
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller I don’t know what a littleshit is, and I’ve certainly not disrespected anyone. Here’s a suggestion for you. When you launch a set of insults, expect incoming.
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller Are you trying to tell me that your a child?
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller So what’s your problem? Daddy didn’t give you enough attention? What?
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller I’m not trying to be clever, and I have no desires to impress anyone. I am addressing the obvious.
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller So young and so clever,  awesome, your unimpressive wit and a 1.25 will get you a coke.
@hellocyberdream @DailyCaller Did you think of that all by your self? Wow, true genius! You must be one of those Moronnials?

@marklevinshow There’s a lot of red meat out there to be gotten, or should I be politically correct and say there’s tons of Tofu out there? Glad they’re fighting back!
@globaldan Why not write about the failure of the US Educational system. Highest per capita spend rate, lowest ranking amongst top 40 First world countries.
@ShannonBream It sounds great? Free stuff! Then you read the fine print!
Dems made delaying SCOTUS picks firing Presidents last year fashionable and the complained when roles reversed. Same with nuke option. Now cabinet delays, and refusal of state of unions can be delayed or cancelled. https://t.co/bC97E1NpVm
@DailyCaller Anyone really think he cares about being excommunicated? A little naive isn’t it? Cuomo is a phony, a fake and a fraud. He’s catholic only when he’s searching for votes.
There is no doubt that democrats are going to pay dearly for Piglosi and for Chuck. Imagine a democrat president trying to get an administration when republicans hold the Senate? Or trying to speak to congress when Republican held? Payback is tough! https://t.co/McRsCmy3ow

@flyerman16 @SteveForbesCEO Take it to the bank, your country has taxed it into oblivion. It’s around $20 -$22 bucks here. Sounds like you’re keeping healthcare free. Somebody has to pay.
I think Newts saying that you have  to take a dump, so that you attract democrats! Just like you do to attract fly’s! https://t.co/rj812oL5jL
@SteveForbesCEO Bernie has abandoned the Venez. model for the Denmark model. Avg tax rate in Den. is 55%, no income level is exempt, vehicles are taxed at 85%% of value, state tax is 8-15% and there is municipal tax at 23-28%. Medical is free.
She’s not much different than any other liberal. They’re all fascists, all liberals are fascists, about time they get the recognition they deserve! https://t.co/uxOAUXiPlp
@marklevinshow One thing we’ve learned with Trump is that he’s generally two steps ahead of his opposition. Trump just didn’t give in without a fight. So where’s he going with last move?
@IanSams @KamalaHarris @maddow Perhaps Nancy and the Dems can stop taking long vacations to Hawaii or weekend junkets to PR long enough to actually get  real work done  you can’t lead, if you keep your head buried in the sand!
@realDonaldTrump Two books could be more exciting. Finding  Hillary’s lost emails. And proper adjudication of the corrupt Obama administration.
@realDonaldTrump It’s just more of the same from liberals. Who’s the authoritarian? Who’s the fascist? It’s clear? The question? Is the most ignorant politician in DC going to outflank the president?
@KamalaHarris We totally loved the way you handled Kavenaugh hearings! You sure solved that problem!
