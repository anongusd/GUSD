@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump You mean a third of America.
@WhiteHouse Fake news
@matthewamiller The.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump No one is listening to you Steve...how does it feel?
@IngrahamAngle Then that knucklehead in the WH along with all of his sycophants should be punished as well L.
@IngrahamAngle What they deserved...
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @POTUS So why didn't you Republicants do something about building the wall when you controlled the WH, Senate, and Congress? Guess it wasn't such an emergency then huh...your all liars hiding behind that racist in the WH. Did you ask that BIG MOUTH why Mexico is not paying for the wall?
@samstein That means he really is 6'1" and  weighs 275.
@senatemajldr Why would we believe anything you say...senile fool.
@crutcherlisa45 @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump You can have him in Texas...as long as we can get rid of him in the rest of the country.
@realDonaldTrump Your delusional...
@JoyceWhiteVance ...get rid of the cat.
@senatemajldr Yeah McConnell bringing back coal is a great idea and let's bring back outhouses and wells in the backyard. I'd gladly give up my SUV to get to work on a Palomino any day.
@Nevertapout1997 @markpannebecker @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump @POTUS POTUS is a traitor. He colluded with the Russians to win the election. Its just a matter of time before he is brought to justice. It's the duty of a real American to not only put him down but to make sure he is not above the law and justice is served.
@SteveScalise Steve, I have to believe that even Trump's 35% are tired of the BS your espousing. Surely you must know that the other 65% of the people see you as a liar and Trump sycophant.
@SteveScalise Lets do the same thing for Republicans Steve. How about Q: who is for assault weapons that kill kids in school? Or Q: do you believe it's not  excessive force for an officer to shoot an unarmed man in the back 7 times. Or Q: do you believe life after birth is just as sacred?
@SteveScalise Where the hell were you when Nunez did everything in his power to prevent the congressional investigations over Russia's involvement in the 2016 Presidential election?
@SVScott @SteveScalise @ScottPresler @freedomcaucus And do the same for those Republicans who promote racism. And those who want to stop coverage for preexisting conditions. And those who agreed to lift sanctions against the Russians. And those who support the wall. And those who are Trump sycophants.
@senatemajldr You senile, pathetic, Trump sycophant. Is that what Ryan gave us during the Obama years? Compromise? Why didn't you complain during his do nothing  tenure? You should crawl back to the swamp where you belong.
@IngrahamAngle I tend to agree L. There's his "committed" 35% of Americans then there's the other 65% of the country that liked it because that fool continued to show what a narcissistic moron he is and we hope he continues his Joe Pesci  impersonation right up to election day....then he's done
@BillOReilly It's you...you look like a frog.
@IngrahamAngle No...it's because they are fake numbers just like he said about  Obama.
@seanhannity @LawrenceBJones3 Actually Sean they were invited by Trump...their employer.
@thehill Like a broken record.
@thehill And only since Donald Trump did a president intentionally promote the views of the minority rather then the majority of people in this country.  Today...now...the MAJORITY of the people don't want the wall. Can't you understand that? Forget about the past.
@WhiteHouse If the job numbers were fake for Obama as you said many times...why are they true now? FAKE NEWS!
@politico Yeah...to the Fourth Reich.
@SteveScalise But it's ok for the taxpayers to foot the bill for settling sexual harassment claims against you politicians! It's obvious your only trying to be critical of a Dem controlled Congress. If your going to take a stand on this issue have the guts to go all out.
@realDonaldTrump Intel did not get it wrong...I tend to think your just stupid.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Another sycophant in Trump's toy box.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump How dumb are you Lou. The agenda of that idiot in the WH is appealing to 30% of the people. Do the math with voters. I mean your dummer then he is to suggest he continue to appeal to his base. But we all know your not dumb...your just a racist trying to keep that strategy alive.
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you give it up.. https://t.co/8qwa8wN2I1
@IngrahamAngle @SecPompeo Hey L your cleaning up John Kerry's mess...who the hell is going to clean up Trump's mess???
@RepMarkWalker @POTUS No. It is Pelosi's house because the 2018 election put her in charge. Do you feel the same way about McConnell in the Senate? He won't do what the people elected him to do when he refuses to bring a bill to the floor because he knows that bum in the WH won't sign it? U hipocrite
@StevenBeschloss Their all part of the plan Steve. They are coconspirators who are taking the pages right out of Hitler's play book. This goes well beyond Trump. They dont care about the rule of law, morals, or values. They are dangerous to our democracy and will do anything to bring it down.
@IngrahamAngle So what is the end game L? Millions of jobs lost on both sides? A crippling world economy. I want you and the Rush to explain to Trump why the trade wars are going on so he can explain it to the American people. Obviously he's just a bobble head translating your strategy.
@senatemajldr Your pathetic you Trump sycophant and your actions in promoting mutual respect and shared brotherhood are more reflective of Hitler's brown shirts rather then Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Yes the nation did unite today to honor him but your crazy to think you were a part of it.
@NJSenatePres Great job in finally getting this done. Now let's move on to addressing  property taxes.  What is your plan with that ?
@realDonaldTrump You'll get your wall soon enough Mr. President...three of them and a metal gate that locks with a concrete floor and ceiling. You will be ripped out of the arms of your family and sent far away against your will to be incarcerated. Then the political games will stop for good.
@KellyO @HallieJackson Barr's pledge to not interfere is a ploy! Reminds me of the old Popeye cartoon when Bluto convinces Popeye to throw away his spinach. A peace offering. When he does Bluto proceeds to punch the hell out of him and you hear the can yelling "you'll be sorry!" Let's not be sorry!
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump And your all liars. Do you think I believe the bull crap this guy is giving that he will not interfere with Mueller's investigation? Trump is recommending him for the job! The investigation could lead (hopefully) to Trump's demise and you want me to believe he will be impartial.
@realDonaldTrump The great negotiator..what a crock. Anyone can tell the other side "my way or no way"...what's so great about that. Your like a human ponzi scheme just full of lies, deceit, and BS.
Republicans: if you  don't want to covet preexisting conditions then here is my rec: Coverage for pre-existing conditions should revert back to the original provider that covered the illness in the first place. It's a continuation of a condition that was not totally cured.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump L...Im glad you specified  @realdonaldtrump supporters because that's all he has...35% base and going down, down, down. He's a loser who does not have a clue of what America is all about. Oh by the way...nor do you!
@senatemajldr Hey dummy are you aware that the knucklehead in the WH is about to pull the troops out?
@IngrahamAngle What's your point L...they lied so it's ok for you and the lunatics in the WH to lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and....
@senatemajldr You senile sycophant. You built a career out of being spiteful. Did you forget Garland, ACA, your hatred for Obama. The list is endless. Your not only spiteful...your down right evil. How do you live with yourself Satan?
@GaryJHack @WhiteHouse Well...at least 35%.
@funder @esk5212 It's comical to think this sewer mouthed piece of garbage in the WH can comment at all about civility. Rashida said we have to wait for Mueller's investigation but interestingly that's not part of this story. I'm not a fan of cursing but she has a right to express her opinion
@OldSchoolGymRat @mpdurkin2002 @jenn_leigh74 @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj @AOC I will Steve. Thanks.
@OldSchoolGymRat @mpdurkin2002 @jenn_leigh74 @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj @AOC Wow...your all over the place now. It was pleasure talking to you. Happy New Year.
@OldSchoolGymRat @mpdurkin2002 @jenn_leigh74 @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj @AOC Your missing the point Steve. The Dems had the numbers.They even had bipartisan support on many passed bills but Christie vetoed these bills and none of his vetoes were overturned. Dems didn't have the numbers to override so yes they had the majority but he Governor had the pen.
@mpdurkin2002 @OldSchoolGymRat @jenn_leigh74 @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj @AOC I agree one party rule is a disaster as seen in D.C. now but in NJ Dem and Repub governors ran the State equally for the 28 years and controlling the assembly really  means nothing. 8 of those 18 yrs Christie vetoed everything with zero overrides. So what am I being biased about?
@OldSchoolGymRat @jenn_leigh74 @mpdurkin2002 @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj Ok Steve I'll play along.Look at Christie's disastrous 8 years when the Dems controlled both Houses. Bills passed that Christie vetoed. A perfect veto record he would boast about bec the gutless Repubs who voted for the bill would not dare override his vetos. Define control 4 me.
@JoeNBC So what are you going to do about it Joe besides quote the NY Times and tell us of the obvious? You helped him get elected with all that free air time you provided along with the yuks you and Mika enjoyed sharing with him. Do you have a plan in place to deligitimize him now?
@ConservBlog @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj Point taken so lets just say in part we agree to disagree...respectfully. Will talk to you again on other issues down the road.  Happy New Year!
@realDonaldTrump Your delusional Donnie.
@ConservBlog @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj But Murphy ran on these platforms and was elected by the majority. And who are you agreeing with on the min $15 wage because even Sweeney supports it. Worst of all it will take 5 yrs to reach $15. Repectfully I think your bottom line is keep the rich richer and the poor poorer.
@OldSchoolGymRat @jenn_leigh74 @mpdurkin2002 @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj Steve lets go back to the 90s and c who govd NJ and how long: Florio90-94, Whitman94-01, McGreevey02-04, Codey04-06, Corzine06-10, Christie10-18. We can agree all sub par performers but the Repubs govd NJ more years then Dems. Wouldn't you agree NJ sucks because of both parties
@mpdurkin2002 @NJSenatePres @path2progressnj Mike...I also have concerns with Murphy as enabler of a sexual predator but the jury is still out on his role in a cover up. Innocent until proven...right. NJ is last in the US due to 8 years of Christie's neglect and Sweeney not standing up to him. So what are you talking about?
@NJSenatePres @path2progressnj Just remember Steve you are not the Governor of this State. You need to find ways to promote Murphy's agenda because the people of NJ elected him Governor. So stop banging heads with him every chance you get and start working with him to make NJ great.
Democrats...Adam Schiff has all the qualifications to run for Pres and beat that traitor in the WH. He served in Congress since 2001,  Rep of Ca. since 2013, and a ranking member of the House Intel Com. He is everything Trump is not. Think about it and let's convince him to run!
@realDonaldTrump Bull sh*t Donnie. You guaranteed during the primaries that "MEXICO WILL PAY FOR THE WALL." Another broken promise to your base and  another lie that USMCA will save billions. If that's the case I suggest you first save those billions to pay for the wall then you can build it.
@RochNH2014 @cnnbrk Of course they did but lets pretend for a moment they did not. In response to your question I'll think about it if you will.
@cnnbrk Calling Laura Ingraham...calling Laura Ingraham...you enjoyed reporting on the recent murder of a 12 year old girl by an illegal immigrant. Let's see you report this story on the death of a 7 y.o. black child...suspect reportedly is a white male with a beard in a red truck.
@realDonaldTrump Your delusional...
@thomas_roo @whreno @realDonaldTrump Sorry...I misnderstood. I  often get that because these Tumpites who don't like to hear the truth about Donnie and that fact that his days are numbered once Mueller comes out with his report immediately curse at me and then block me. Hide from the truth like their gutless leader
@thomas_roo @whreno @realDonaldTrump What are you taking about?
@realDonaldTrump Let's wait to see what Mueller has to say about that pal.
@realDonaldTrump Donnie...so let me get this straight you didn't want Stormy to tell all about your one nighter with her (and others) actually going to court to stop her from talking but you think the FBI obstruted justice by not revealing the details of Page/Peter tryst...you are deplorable
@realDonaldTrump words of wisdom for you Mr. President...		"When we serve the poor and the sick we serve Jesus. We must not fail to help our neighbors, because in them we serve Jesus."	— St. Rose of Lima
@Cgrosen324 @BillKristol Chris, sorry for the late response. ..just saw your reply. That's right I  am a fuck as you said but that's because you know I'm right. I won't call you a fuck because the readers know that's what you are from your response. Let's just say your deplorable!
@IngrahamAngle L...Nancy does not TAKE OVER the house until next week and as far as I know Shumer cant do anything as long as that Trump sycophant Mitch  controls the Senate. I think your audience knows these things and must wonder what you expect from Nancy and Chuck? Classic deception!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Yes Donnie great things are happening as Mueller will be completing his investigation on how you colluded with the Russians to win the election and you will be on your way out. Great things indeed!
@LtGovOliver Yes Lt. Oliver it will do all those things if you increase the minimum wage NOW to $15.00. What will $15 be worth 5 years from now? Also, rather then focusing on a $15 inimum wage five years from now what will your first increase be in 2019? Hopefully something maeningful!
@realDonaldTrump The best way to stop drugs/gangs is to vote you out and elect a Pres with a PLAN. You and that dam wall. Do the math. 10' wall...11' ladder. 10' deep...11' deep tunnel. Drones/tech will catch those who will easily breach your $5b dam wall. Its just politics w/o a plan.
@Bismarck_SD @LtGovOliver @GovMurphy @realDonaldTrump Where were u for 8 years when the Republicants refused to work with Obama on anything? When McConnell swore his nunber one goal was to stop Obama from getting reelected ...refusing to cooperate with him. Republicants don't like it when the Dems use their playbook ....hypocrites.
@jwmccartney @LtGovOliver @GovMurphy @realDonaldTrump Well than why did Donnie call it a "shut down" a/k/a no work...no pay and take credit for it? Do either of you know what a shut down is?
@LPWings @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Does it matter L? It still boills down to a difference of opinion...one opinion based on 40 years of military experience and one based on.. hmm based on 40 years of real estate experience and oh yeah lets give him credit for bankruptcy law.
@RandPaul It's about time...
@g_e_anderson @morningmika @MSNBC Mika is not exactly up there or should I say down there with Coulter but I am disappointed in her nonetheless. She does not bring anything substantive to the table except the obvious. This is why she has to talk like that 4 attention. It's pathetic if that's all she has and Joe.
@hyang1 @IngrahamAngle @IBDeditorials It's $200 Henry. I don't want you to be wrong in everything you said.
@IngrahamAngle @IBDeditorials Just like Trump and his family/staff should be prosecuted for illegal meetings with Russia. Right L?
@RaidersHLP @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Harry...your confused. The  Republicants control the govt. Trump's party is not giving him what he wants. What r u talking about when you say "why not shut down the govt because those running it won't give him what he wants?" R u blaming the Dems? They dont control  of anything
@TuckerCarlson What are you talking about you Trump sycophant? You were semi normal when you wore a bow tie on TV.  Now, the premise of your show is to promote anger, lies, and hatred like the other talking bobble heads on FOX. And remember it's only 1/3rd of the country that hates not 2 parts.
@IvankaTrump @POTUS Two years in office and all your dad cared about was making the rich richer, locking Hillary up, and lying to the American people EVERYDAY. Now when he is about to be indicted u want us to believe he cares about combating modern slavery. Are you the only one not paying attention?
@BillOReilly Sorry O'Reilly, chance of that happening are as good as you getting on TV again.
@PhilipRucker Nobody tells Trump when to sing.
@IngrahamAngle What a legacy you will leave when your gone L. A deplorable person who did nothing but proudly  publicize the negative in anyone DESPITE the good they did with their lives. Find a chink in the armor...lapse in judgment and use it to destroy. One versus many...your just pathetic!
@BillKristol At this point, it's not worth giving him 5b for the wall even to save Mueller. The facts are documented and with a Dem Congress justice will prevail. Also, why bail him out of yet another broken campaign promise. There will be a wall and Mexico will pay for it. What a joke he is.
Gov Murphy and Sweeney stop using the Star Ledger to talk to each other. Murp, we didn't elect Sween to run the NJ. YOU WERE ELECTED. Man up and meet him in a back room to make a decision on minimum wages. No one gives a sht about whose showboating. Personally I think you both sk
@seanhannity That's interesting...I would think that polls find most Americans (women included) don't want to see you on TV any more.
@senatemajldr Stupid bstrd...that's because no one else wants the job. And your not serving the country your serving your King in the WH...sycophant!
@EricHolder Yes, Nancy should be the next speaker of the house especially since the swamp needs draining  of Trump sycophants. The Republicants want her out because she can go toe to toe with the best of them and win. Succession plan yes but not just now. We need her....Democracy needs her!
@TheBeatWithAri Hey Scott stop being a baby.	MAN up and SHUT up and just let them count the ballots and let the chips fall where they fall.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah Donald ballots are missing or forged. You go man....your on to something. Here's a great idea how about creating a Commission to investigate voter fraud. Oh wait, you tried that already and how did that work out...you imbecile! Come 2020 you'll be all washed up Pink Pad.
@senatemajldr This is exactly what you did for the past 8 years you Trump sycophant. You practiced partisan politics by working with King Trump only and not the Dems. So it's up to you as to whether the Dems will cooperate now. Will you continue to kiss the king's ass Mc?
Question of the day: What is more worthless then an apology from New Jersey Transit for their poor service. Should we assume everything associated with Trump is a given.
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump I guess that ridiculous executive order is on the shelf next to the wall and that fantastic, tremendous, super, great, nothing like it health plan the Republicants promised us 10 years ago.  Oh wait it's only 9 years as they forgot about it after McCain killed it.
@IngrahamAngle Come on L stop running the Clinton thing up the flag pole. Its old. She was investigated and cleared. No there there.  Besides impeachment will not be necessary as Trump is smart enough not to run again in order to protect himself and family before the shit hits the fan.
@IngrahamAngle @FreeBeacon Give it up L. Except for Trump's base do you think anyone believes anything you say. So desperate to be a Trump stooge. Like Hitler's brownshirts you lie, attack the press, eliminate your opposition,   and even try to change the Constitution. All right out of Hitler's playbook.
@IngrahamAngle @SenatorCollins She voted to confirm idiot so she did give into the mob!
@Eric48765562 @matthewjsinger @Sen_JoeManchin And what do you have to say Eric about that lunatic Pinnochio in the WH when he lies every dam day. Of course that's ok and it doesn't bother you.
@SenateGOP But it was ok when you bstrds played games by denying Garland an interview. Lied about O'bama's birth cert. Promised a great health plan so you could do away with Obamacare. Need I go on? The Republicants are deplorable to think the dems should stop playing games they invented.
@IngrahamAngle Tough sht.
@senorrinhatch LIAR...LIAR...LIAR. If you really meant that you would have agreed  to a full investigation by the FBI just like you did with Anita Hill. Now that will make Dr. Ford comfortable but you won't do that you senile bstrd because your part of the Republicant charade.
@DrewBaye @ChrisCuomo @Cernovich 00
@IngrahamAngle @ChuckGrassley Spoken like a true Nazi Ingraham. The Republicants got the muscle so let's shove this down the throats of the opposition like it or not. That's why this country as result of the cancer Trump brought into our democracy will never recover. Remember...what goes around comes around.
@GovMurphy @NJEA What's the catch Gov? Do you really expect me to believe your saving NJ taxpayers 500m through a cost cutting deal involving medical benefits for State and Local  workers done THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING no less and the savings will kick in this century. Your a funny guy Gov.
@IngrahamAngle Not yet anyway...
@HouseGOP Sure you can because it's not true...FAKE NEWS!
@GovMurphy You act like this idea is just around the corner when it's still a pipe dream...a twinkle in your delusional eyes. Stop talking and do something real to reduce the high cost of living in NJ. now! Or before you know it 3 plus years will go by and your political career is over!!!
@GovMurphy There's not a dam thing you can do about that law you call "unconstitutional" 4 some reason and you know it. Stop grandstanding and get to work on reducing the high cost of living in N.J. You can start by teaming with Sweeney on his economic reforms. Please Gov...get to work!!!
@GovMurphy Exactly because you had nothing to do with those results. Now if you would just start working with Sweeney on his economic reforms those K - 12 students might someday be able to afford to live in this State.
RT @SteveSchmidtSES: Trump is vile, dishonest and corrupt. He is stoking a cold civil war in our land. He is assailing our institutions, tr…
@GovMurphy @fred_guttenberg The only hand you need to shake right now Gov is Sweeney's after you get on board with his reforms to stabilize Jersey's economy.
@GovMurphy It's not that simple Governor. You need to strike a balance between workers rights and taxpayers rights to achieve a win/win for all. As such, you need to get on board with Sweeney's reforms before we ALL lose.
@BobHugin What do you know about putting people first? I'd rather have a corrupt politician than someone who profits from the misery of others.
@RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @CNN @NBCNews Hands behind your back Donnie as the cuffs are coming out.
@RandPaul In HS some 50 years ago my history teacher always said Russia and China are determined to overthrow the US govt. C believed in evolution to achieve this goal. R believed in revolution. Your delusional if you think it is worth the effort to pander to R to gain their cooperation.
@GovMurphy @NewJerseyDEP Your losing focus Governor.  It's property taxes, cutting expenses, mass transit,  infrastructure,  education, minimum wages,  etc. etc. Let's not worry about the bears right now.  Please.
@GovMurphy Governor, you need to get on board with Sweeney's efforts to reduce property taxes. I know the recommendations are tough pills for you to swallow but you need to help middle class property owners as well as those needing an increase in minimum wages. R u up for the challenge?
@MeetThePress @RudyGiuliani LIAR!
@RandPaul I would think in a State where personal income is under 40k and your sucking every other State's Federal tax dollars to survive you should be paying more attention to Kentucky than Russia you Trump sycophant.
@IngrahamAngle and conservatives love them all!
@realDonaldTrump Fake news from a fake President.
@BillOReilly I suppose you and your sycophants felt nothing but "love" for Obama and his administration way back when right Billy.  No racism or hartred there or did you forget you senile old fool. You of all people talking about hatred. Why don't you crawl back under the rock you came from.
@marjorieh1350 @StevenBeschloss Ok but so what! She's not a traitor. A racist or a President trying to divide the country and become a dictator.  She was a CONTESTANT and not the piece of garbage that starred on that show. It's silly of you to conclude they are the same.
@HouseGOP @nytimes All fake numbers just like Trump said about Obama when he had the Country's economy rolling full steam ahead after the disaster Bush left behind.
@realDonaldTrump Then shut the hell up when these AMERICANS take a knee on the foorball field and support their fight for justice. You can't because you're a racist and your words about caring for all Americans is just plain and simple BS!!!
@Brandt_Phenom @nytimes @FoxNews Jacob, we both understand how important it is to get along now all we have to do is convince the rest of the country to do the same.
@IvankaTrump What the hell good is it when your father cut the funds that could help train the people to fill those jobs.  Will you talk to him next about making money available for education or are you just going to provide sound bites and meaningless words as usual and just walk away?
@NBCNews It's about time you had the guts to say something other then what that clown in the WH tells you to say. Do you have the guts to say more in support of Democracy?
@StevenBeschloss Yeah in an orange jump suit doing laundry for the next 20 years
@Brandt_Phenom @nytimes Jacob, are you describing the Times or Fox news?
@mitchellreports @chucktodd @MeetThePress That's the way you beat this clown Andrea. Didn't the press learn not to provide this evil person with so much free coverage like you did in  the primaries and presidential election. You can't ignore him but you can't promote him either. Figure it out.
@feingold32 @SallyQYates I'm not going to say the system is perfect but the FBI, DOJ like the Military are the cornerstones of our  Democracy. What is your alternative? A gov't run by lackies ruled by a Dictator bec thats where we are going. I won't try to convince you otherwise but in time he will.
@feingold32 @SallyQYates The only one delusional here are the  Republicant supporters who think this clown in the WH and his sycophants actually care about anyone but themselves.	.
@TracyMcTrump @LockHimUp2018 @SallyQYates Tracy, I can only hope he and his sycophants are under it
@SpeakerRyan Your a joke Ryan. The only place you qualify in talking about restoring a civil society is in a zoo to the animals because that's the level of your civil discourse...no offense animals.
@VeraMBergen @PhilipRucker Finally, truth.
@thehill Bankrupt?
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Let's talk about Trump and his family monetizing the presidency.
@realDonaldTrump Oh please.
@IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse You silly stupid person. Just get off the stage and stay out of sight because you have less cedibility then your old man.
@humiliation_llc @arturaskerelis @realDonaldTrump Yeah...just as tolerant as the Republicans were when O'bama was in office.  Or did you conveniently forget?
Exactly... https://t.co/h2hcraspAm
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Look you idiot IF we are in a position of strength its because the FBI, DOJ, Mueller and many more did their jobs in protecting our democracy.

@StevenBeschloss @LindseyGrahamSC Graham is either delusional or part of the act because Trump isnt going to Russia to confront Putin about interfering with the 2016 elections he is going to Russia to make certain Putin interferes with the 2018 elections. Everything else about this trip is secondary.
@senorrinhatch That's great Hatch. Where were you for the past 9 years when your party threw civility into the gutter and in so doing you put a  lunatic in the WH. The damage is done and no matter what you say now your still going to hell.
@realDonaldTrump You should be in a straighjacket receiving psychiatric care. I mean even you can't believe that.
@HouseGOP @POTUS Fake news
@NBCNightlyNews @NBCPolitics Your about 4 weeks to late after that knucklehead in the WH decided on Zero Tolerance policy. Where do you of all people, an immigrant yourself, remain silent while families are torn apart and only after a massive public outcry decide to speak out as if you care. You make me sick
@FoxNews @FLOTUS Where were you FLOTUS when your idiot husband gave the  "zero tolerance" order several weeks back. That's when you should have had the courage to speak out. You have no credibility by crawling out from under your rock now and pretending you care. Have you no shame at all.
@FoxNews @SpeakerRyan @BarackObama How stupid are you Ryan? Republicans are now in the same position you say Obama was in when he didn't fix immigration but what are they doing.. absolutely nothing! Don't forget idiot that you were the Speaker THEN and NOW having the power and responsibility to fix it as well. Duh
@SpeakerRyan Money, money, money... your pathetic to think that's all that really matters.

You Repubs have that all figured out. Make your money, ruin the country and let the Dems take over and fix what you screwed up.
@SenateMajLdr @StateDept So you refused to consider a vote on Garland for Supreme Court. You pledged once Obama was elected that you would do everything in your power to make sure he would not get reelected. You are the primary reason why bipartisanship no longer exist. You are a traitor to this country.
@SenateMajLdr @NASA And I hope the dems respond like you did to Obama on his Supreme Court nominee Garland. Where the hell do you get the nerve to hope all Senators join you in nominating Bridestein. You are a traitor to this country.
@realDonaldTrump Fake news.
@FoxNews @POTUS Then why not reveal your income tax returns you liar.
@FoxNews @SenCoryGardner Then why don't you explain that to the Russian sympathizer in WH who refuses to issue additional sanctions against them. Amb. Haley knows that but then of course she did not sell her soul to the "evil empire" to get elected President.
@thehill Fake news.
@Mediaite Looks like Tucker's next.
@craigaroo @costello_ilene @WayneLogan12 @TheProhmKing @FSUMogle @mikefarb1 Craig...why would the Russians help the Dems? Have you been following the news at all in the past year?
@TheIJR So according to you Trump should be thanking Comey rather then calling him a slime ball!
@HouseGOP Fake fake news!
@costello_ilene @WayneLogan12 @craigaroo @TheProhmKing @FSUMogle @mikefarb1 We must get the vote out especially with women, minorities, and teens voting for the first time in order to overwhelm any Russian interference and ebable us to take back our government. We all need to do whatever it takes to reverse the poison coming from the WH.
@costello_ilene @WayneLogan12 @craigaroo @TheProhmKing @FSUMogle Not we Ilene..its the poison sitting in the WH that is deliderately trying to change the country by plan. We must do everything we can to stop him and his "brown shirts" at the pols this November.
@FoxNews @MariaBartiromo @Comey @POTUS @HillaryClinton How is it that every time someone finds their career is headed for the toilet they join Fox? And how do you know Maria, he doesn't have memos about Hillary? My question is why do we care? She's not president. Deception...that's all you can do to protect that slime bucket.
@SpeakerRyan I'm happier to be able to say good bye to you...a dam looser!
@jaketapper and history Mr. Trump will prove you to be a disgrace, a criminal, a joke, and yes...a slime ball.
@joncoopertweets @AceHardware They have the right to spend their money on advertising wherever they want just as I have a right to NEVER do business at an Ace hardware store again.
@RJMorse13 @JoeNBC @POTUS RJM...so what are you saying these Republicans are not actually Republicans but Democrats in the swamp trying to overthrow a Republican President? Your making no sense.  But truthfully, I'd rather see them take down the President then let that lunatic take down the Country.

@realDonaldTrump If DACA's dead so is your wall  until you get MEXICO to pay for it like you promised. Do you think we forgot the campaign promise you made. But once Fox stared you down and told you Mexico will noy pay for the wall you ran for cover just like the gutless  punk you are.
@thedebbiec @EricJenningsBFD @realDonaldTrump That's fine Debbie... I believe your entitled to your opinion unlike Trump who wants to mock, bully, and seek revenge against those that don't agree with him. And I don't want to change your mind bwcause I think he will eventually do it for me.
@realDonaldTrump So sad that you the BIG negotiator. ..the BIG wheeler dealer who told us how Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Whose paying you would shout to the crowd... Mexico... who..Mexico. Guess you forgot about that campaign promise. Mr. BIG shot. Your nothing but a BS artist.
@WenskeJames @IngrahamAngle ...to bad her sponsors don't feel that way.
@IngrahamAngle Who cares. Maybe someone should research his background when he is older to tarnish him like you tried w/Hogg. But real Christians don't spit venom at those who are defenseless.  And please stop making  a mockery of our faith by wearing the cross around your neck. You hipocrite.
@IngrahamAngle You actually thought it was a  good idea to research Hogg in an effort to tarnish him. Is it because you breed hatred and can't find the good in this brave teenager who was shot at while running for his life at school. Hope your vacationing where O'Reilly went when he was canned.
@TIME Zuckerberg should resign. His apology is about as sincere as one from NJ Transit. It means nothing and besides why should we believe he was unaware of what Cambridge Analytica was doing with data from Facebook. Its quite possible he initiated the idea.

@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris Fake news!
@SenJohnMcCain So why don't you and the rest of your Republican colleagues DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!
@realDonaldTrump free enterprise - an economic system in which private business operates in competition and largely free of state control. This is why the Steele industry is in bad shape. They need to look within and figure out how to be more competitive. Tariffs are not the answer.
@FoxNews Fake news.
@SpeakerRyan Ryan you sicken me talking about Billy Graham's legacy and  the Bible when you stand armed and ready to screw the crippled, the poor, the hungry and those in need. What is your legacy? Money and Power...do you think that will get you into the Pearly Gates?
@realDonaldTrump The better question is why are they even doing this Il Duce?
Trump has not told NSA Director to disrupt Russian election hacking. We have a TRAITOR in the WH (no more sanctions) and we need to impeach him. Republicans won't do it because they want interference so they can win in 18 and 20. Is this what we have come to be? WIN AT ANY COST!
The NRA has awaken a sleeping giant...future voters! Who would have thought that such a sad sad tragedy would lead to a movement of young articulate and committed leaders that will pull this country from the fangs of the NRA and the Republican  sycophants.

@FoxNews @RajShah45 Raj...that's the problem when your not willing to negotiate. Democracy is built on bipartisanship and compromise not mob rule. You need to look at the bigger picture here. The Dems are finally saying to the "mob" that controls the House and Senate NO MORE!
RT @davidchristophr: @CillizzaCNN @KilloughCNN @ryanobles AKA the Republican playbook during the entire Obama administration
I would like to think the shutdown is more then DACA v the Wall. It's a message to the "mob" that controls the House and Senate to stop being a puppet to the WH and do your job as independent law makers. For McConnell to say he's waiting to see what Clowny wants is a disgrace.
@SpeakerRyan Fake news Eddie Munster!

@PhilMurphyNJ And we won't have short memories if you don't take a position on the 2% salary cap due to expire. First control what you can control Phil than use your influence on the Republicans who voted "no" but did not speak out against the tax reform bill.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @BretBaier @SpecialReport @FoxNews McConnell you just proved my point that your senile. Did you forget during O'Bama's administration your number one goal was to see him fail and not get reelected. 70% of the country did not and will not forget in 2018.
@FoxNews @SpeakerRyan Ryan...why dont you put your money where your mouth is. If we dont see signs that the tax reform bill "will put us on the right path" (as you say) in 6 months then you will resign from Congress.
@NatResources @SpeakerRyan Fake news...
@SpeakerRyan Ryan do you even know what your saying...your delusional. Our moment. More United. More free. More confident. We have not been this divided as a country since the 60's thanks to you and that clown in the WH. 70% of the country does not trust you so snap out of it!!!
@SpeakerRyan Ryan...your delusional. The American people that trust you to do yhe work for them  represents 30% of the country. You are undermining our democracy by letting the minority dictate to the majority.
@RuthBurnham13 @janegilbert @tribelaw You still need to voice your objection Ruth. Dont let the lousy 30% of Trump's base silence your piece of the 70% of the country. That's what they are hoping for...no resistance!
@SenateMajLdr Mitch, your a delusional, senile old man to think 70% of the country believes you care about CHIP or anything other then what will help you and the 1%ers.
@janegilbert @tribelaw We got here because 80% of Trump's 35% supporters countrywide have put the fear of God in those gutless Republican bstrds. Everyone opposing this tax reform bill MUST call their Representatives in the House and Senate and tell them to oppose it.
@realDonaldTrump Who gives a dam about the world watching tax reform in this country Clowny. You should be caring about the people in this country that are watching and the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY that don't want this plan to pass.

Why don't you tell us how your going to pay to run the govt and support these programs? Ryan's plan is to cut Medicare/Caid and SS. Are you joining him?
@SpeakerRyan I have two words for you Mr. Ryan and your tax relief plan for the American people...fake news!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Don't you get it Clowny.  67% of the country finds you repulsive. 3 million more voters in the election found you repulsive. In the near future Muller and Company will find you colluded with the Russians to win the election. These are facts. ..nothing fake.
@MittRomney Do you feel the same way about that giant stain in the WH Mitt. If so, why don't you talk about him. On second thought, forget about just talking why don't you do something to get him out?
@realDonaldTrump And you owe Obama a great deal of thanks for leaving you a strong economy to build on unlike the mess Bush left him. Did you thank him Clowny?
@realDonaldTrump And look at you now...
@jonathanchait And how is that going to make America Great Again? So much for country over party. Goldwater, Scott, and Rhodes are turning in their graves.
@realDonaldTrump So ACA is failing and you think Ins Co's will support Trumpcare by lowering premiums. DT supporters do you believe that because he doesn't.
@realDonaldTrump DT forget the wall with Mexico and look at the wall you're  building between you and 60% of the country. Your supposed to be Pres of all.
@politico How about proposing a 15% tax rate for the middle class Mr. President. Is it because somone has pay for the tax cuts you give to the rich?
@realDonaldTrump Why now Mr. President. You often used non union workers at your construction projects. I ask DT supporters can't you see the hypocrisy.
@daviddanielfre1 @RaiseTheWall POTUS gave countless versions of how Mexico will pay for the wall.  Bottom line is it will never happen. Just another broken promise.
@RaiseTheWall Why would we do this when the President guaranteed us Mexico would pay for the wall or is that another promise he will not keep?
@POTUS Mr. President if you want to rebuild the country dont start with concrete and metal start with integrity and truth.
