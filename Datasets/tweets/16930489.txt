Anyway, I'm glad we could all share a good laugh today.
So, that's why I asked you to "retweet" that first tweet. Because I wish to spread joy.
To heighten the comedic effect, I added several emojis. Those are always funny.
So, what I did is switch out "seas" for "nausea," thus creating a pun or something. That's why my original tweet was so funny.
And the cruise ship is called "Oasis of the Seas"
