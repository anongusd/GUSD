@GannonShaya @OfficeOfMike If they were on a recess and he called them back, the Speaker and Senate Maj. Leader still control the agenda. The only person who can allow the President (or anyone else for that matter) to speak on the house floor is the Speaker 2/2
@GannonShaya @OfficeOfMike That‚Äôs called a special session. If Congress is on a recess, the president can make them return. That doesn‚Äôt apply to this situation at all, because Congress is already in session.... 1/2
@GannonShaya @OfficeOfMike I don‚Äôt see anywhere that the ‚Äústate of the union address MUST be given on 29 January...‚Äù Speaker Pelosi has told the president that he will be invited to speak when the shutdown is over. The house has passed 8 (9?) bills to open the government, the senate needs to do the same.
@bevnason1 @OfficeOfMike You shouldn‚Äôt be pissed because he‚Äôll be able to give his speech after he stops holding 800K Americans hostage and reopens the government. Tonight the separation of powers was reaffirmed. That is a huge win for America and our most valuable institutions.

@DirkJohnson15 @jonesyvonne1 @OfficeOfMike @realDonaldTrump She is more representative of the American people than President Trump. She was elected by a majority of representatives, who were represented by a majority of their constituents. Trump has never won a majority of his constituents votes...
@jonesyvonne1 @OfficeOfMike @realDonaldTrump No. He could declare a national emergency and get his wall built, but the government can‚Äôt open until the House and Senate pass the same bill and Trump signs it. And he can‚Äôt give the SOTU until the Speaker invites him and passes legislation to formally welcome him to the floor.
@honoraryamerica @OfficeOfMike He doesn‚Äôt make her ‚ÄúSEEM very powerful...‚Äù she IS very powerful. Without her approval, the president would be committing a felony by speaking on the house floor. Without her approval the cameras in the chamber can‚Äôt turn on. She holds all the marbles when it comes to the SOTU.
@jonesyvonne1 @OfficeOfMike @realDonaldTrump The legislative branch is coequal with the executive Branch, meaning Trump has absolutely no control over what Congress does. To suggest otherwise is antithetical to the basis of our constitutional democracy. So, no- Trump does not have the ‚Äúauthority to stop this Pelosi circus‚Äù.

@hansonDigby @somuchweirdness @LibbiestLib @purrfection2015 @WhitCourtCraft This argument is stupid.

@ProgMovement @RWPUSA We've got to get rid of Pence too. Thats why Painter's so adamant in his calls for impeachment hearings. Pence certainly knows about crimes Trump has committed, now its just figuring out what he knew and when. Theyre all treasonous slimeballs who need to be out of the White House
@hellodonavon @RWPUSA @deanbphillips He also has one of the best civil rights advocates/scholar in the state endorsing him, Minnesota Senator Myron Orfield. Richard has worked on cases against housing segregation in the Twin Cities for years. Why all the lies/misinformation, Donavon?
@hellodonavon @RWPUSA @deanbphillips Why don't you source your claim? Have you been to any of his town halls to ask about it? He also has come out strongly for criminal justice reform and wants to legalize marijuana and expunge the records of those convicted of small time offenses. Where's Tina on that issue?
@hellodonavon @RWPUSA @deanbphillips Whenever he talks about impeaching Trump at his events he also talks about the need for impeaching Pence. Pence absolutely knows about one of Trump's crimes, and has probably helped cover it up. Thats why Painter says we need immediate hearings to find out who knew what and when.
@ShallahGaykwon @RWPUSA I'm sure after he wins the Primary Richard, the DFL Candidate, will debate Housley. It would've been nice to have a debate before the primary too, so we could easily see their differences, but Tina was too scared of being asked to sell her stock. Tina is an #EvasiveLeader

@hellodonavon @RWPUSA @deanbphillips You are being dense, Donavon. What that article makes clear is that Painter had no input in Bush‚Äôs policy. 		Ethics is non-partisan. He‚Äôd have worked for Trump, Clinton, Obama, or any President because that‚Äôs how you make a difference in ethics reform. With a seat at the table.
@hellodonavon @RWPUSA @deanbphillips He was not responsible for Cheney‚Äôs finances, there was a different ethics lawyer for the VP‚Äôs office.

@2018DemWave @RWPUSA He has no conflicts of interest, because he‚Äôs not in Congress yet. If he wins the primary, he promised to stop all private sector work. But until he is making the laws that effect an industry he has money invested in, he‚Äôs not conflicted.

@GangOfPuppets @RWPUSA When he said she‚Äôd be a ln alright placeholder, her financial disclosures weren‚Äôt publicly available, so he‚Äôd have no way of knowing how conflicted she truly was. Read his post on Facebook from the other day, it‚Äôs clear Senator Smith is part of the problem he is talking about.
@GangOfPuppets @RWPUSA As a PLACEHOLDER. He didn‚Äôt endorse the coronation of her as the ONLY DFL candidate allowed to run. He always pushed for debates and active campaigning. Also he opposed corruption, so he‚Äôd probably be pretty upset with Smith.
@GangOfPuppets @RWPUSA He doesn‚Äôt want to endorse candidates until after the primary, because every election should be decided by the people. But he‚Äôs brought a large contingent of independents and environmentalists into the party that otherwise would be turned off by the establishment hacks in the DFL
@GangOfPuppets @RWPUSA Franken supported Smith as a placeholder until Minnesotans could decide who the best Senator would be. She wasn‚Äôt supposed to be coronated as the ‚Äúall-mighty Senator‚Äù who cannot be challenged. She doesn‚Äôt get incumbency advantage after being appointed...
@ColorMeBlue2018 @lakeoftheisles @TS4Dems @RWPUSA I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a ‚Äúconvenient purity test‚Äù to ask that our Senators aren‚Äôt too conflicted to do their job.

@Beth4Dems @RWPUSA @garywfuller You can follow the money for yourself, Beth. Sen. Smith is beholden to the corporate interests and is too conflicted to regulate the Healthcare industry. If she wants to be my Senator, she needs to divest. If she doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll never be able to trust her.

@alanajpetersen @TinaSmithMN If she cares about Farmers why did "Right-Wing" Tina forget that the party is the Democratic Farmer Labor party, not just the Democratic party?

@sydney_marianne Trump called himself a Democrat for decades, but he certainly isn't one today. Parties evolve, and today's GOP is not the same as it was even 5 years ago. Painter always supported policies that are important to Democrats and will stand up to the party bosses who don't want change
@hansonDigby @RWPUSA @amyklobuchar No qualified ethicist would say that Smith isn't without immediate conflicts. She needs to divest or recuse herself from legislation regarding healthcare.
@hansonDigby @RWPUSA @amyklobuchar But they'll be broadly diversified and not centralized in one industry, like medical devices, so they can't craft legislation that will immediately increase their value. Even better would be conflict-free mutual funds (which Klobuchar has lots of money in).
@Stay_Resolute @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN @RepChrisCollins There's a difference between making money from a job as a counsel and making money from personally working to deregulate an industry that you hold millions of dollars of stock in. There's a word that describes the increasing value of Tina's portfolio, its corruption.
@Stay_Resolute @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN @RepChrisCollins He was paid for being an attorney/expert witness and isn't constantly making money from one industry like Smith. If elected, he'll stop all work with his clients. Tina has millions of dollars in conflicted stocks that become more valuable when we pay more for healthcare.
@SandySfdcnj @RWPUSA @amyklobuchar It should be required by law, otherwise neither party will actually make the change. If it's not mandated by law, legislators will just continue on with the status-quo that has destroyed our government for years.

@GriffinCOA @RWPUSA @amyklobuchar They wouldn't be giving up their financial gains, but moving them into broadly diversified mutual funds so that they don't have financial conflicts of interest holding them back from crafting good legislation for the people rather than their wallets.
@hansonDigby @RWPUSA @amyklobuchar Do you know what mutual fund is? He wouldn't know that he owns the stock, so he doesn't have a conflict of interest. Everyone in government should only have money in mutual funds, insurance, bank accounts, and other conflict-free assets. We need #EthicalLeadership
@hansonDigby @QueenMab87 @T_FisherKing @Anon_OMouse @Cycle4 @skynetesq Her vote on H.R.195 was disappointing, but she's only voted 20 times since being appointed, so I'd rather look at the issues she supports enough to introduce in her first couple months in office. Clearly she really wants to let int'l mining companies destroy our waterways....
@QueenMab87 @Anon_OMouse @Cycle4 @skynetesq To protect We the People from having leaders who are too conflicted to regulate industries. Without ethics lawyers, our leaders might own millions of dollars in Medical Device Stock while trying to repeal the ACA medical device tax in order to enrich themselves. Thats corruption.
@QueenMab87 @T_FisherKing @Anon_OMouse @Cycle4 @skynetesq Here's more than a vote- She attached a rider to the Federal Defense Spending bill, completely unrelated to the actual bill, which allowed the Polymet land-swap deal, so that int'l mining magnates could come into MN and destroy our waterways with sulfide mining.
@QueenMab87 @Anon_OMouse @Cycle4 @skynetesq Yeah. Notsomuch.... Maybe you should read about the role of an ethics counsel. They're almost always at loggerheads with the administration and the President. His job was to tell new executive branch employees they needed to divest their stocks before starting their jobs.
@T_FisherKing @QueenMab87 @Anon_OMouse @Cycle4 @skynetesq They aren't stupid attack lines, they're issues that matter deeply to Minnesotans around the state. Do you think that healthcare cost don't matter? How about pollution? Not many people care about that... Or ethics in general? Minnesotans want someone who will fight for the issues
@TinaSmithMN @RobEcklund I bet you got a warm welcome from all the sulfide mine lovers up there! Oh wait... Those sulfide mines will destroy the blossoming eco-tourism industry and the beautiful scenery of Grand Marais. #RightWingTina
@QueenMab87 @Anon_OMouse @Cycle4 @skynetesq Maybe if Tina hired Richard, she wouldn't have millions of dollars in medical device stock as she tries to repeal the ACA Medical Device Tax... When we pay more for healthcare, she makes more money. She is too conflicted to regulate the industries that need new regulations.
@QueenMab87 @Anon_OMouse @Cycle4 @skynetesq You're right, he was an ethics lawyer. A completely non-partisan role at the highest level of government. He has even said he would be Trump's ethics lawyer if asked, because he cares about keeping those with financial conflicts of interest out of governing. #CountryOverParty
@somuchweirdness He endorsed her as his interim replacement, but never in the election. If he really thought she was the best candidate he would've said so publicly by now. The radio-silence from him during this election is deafening.

She's too corrupt to take on the Trump admin, too conflicted to work on healthcare costs, too in-bed with mining companies to fight pollution, and too establishment to fight for ethical or election reform. She wont even debate her opponents

@QueenMab87 @Anon_OMouse @Cycle4 @skynetesq He literally testified in front of the Minnesota legislature in 2011, demanding a statute legalizing same sex marriage in MN.

@kenmartin73 @weare3i Grow a backbone and resign for covering up sexual harassment within the DFL and for spreading false information about a DFL Candidate for the US Senate.
@BurnsieMN @MplsMe @RWPUSA Why don't you look into what he did as a contributor, Trevor. He was on a podcast arguing that Trump needs to put all his assets into a blind trust! STOP MISLEADING YOUR FOLLOWERS, TREVOR. Do some research, he has nothing to hide.
@BurnsieMN @MplsMe @RWPUSA The DFL is just attacking him with misleading/false information because they know the momentum is on Painter's side. Ken Martin is scared that we'll elect someone who will work for the people of MN rather than the establishment hacks who run the DFL
@BurnsieMN @MplsMe @RWPUSA The entire point of an audit committee in a foundation or corporation is to be INDEPENDENT of management. Similar standards are set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 which Richard was intimately involved.
@BurnsieMN @MplsMe @RWPUSA As he explained a number of times, the audit committee is BY LAW independent of management and works with outside auditors to review financial statements, accounting practices, detect or prevent fraud and other illegality, and review management practices.
@somuchweirdness Also, let's come together to laugh at the fact that "End Citizens United" is itself a PAC.
@somuchweirdness He's beholden to no one but the people of Minnesota. Smith is beholden to her billionaire donors, corporations and the Medical Device companies that she owns millions of dollars of stock in. She can't represent us while being in the back pockets of the one percent.
RT @nycsouthpaw: Here‚Äôs one to put in your back pocket. https://t.co/u5W6Agug3O
@MarketEMC @keyc The DFL knows they're spreading false/misleading information so they won't make the statement public. @kenmartin73 has posted lies about Richard's campaign a number of times and has never apologized for it. It's just political posturing because they know Richard has the momentum.
@sasha4th You really don't like to fact-check... The Koch-Bros don't have anything to do with the DDSF. 		His campaign is based on ending corruption and bringing ethical leadership to DC. 		And his job in the WH was to ensure no one in the exec branch had financial conflicts of interest
@sasha4th He took no money from the Koch Brothers? I'd rather have a Senator who worked to prevent fraud as an independent auditor for an organization that I think is backwards than a Senator who is too conflicted to do her job because she owns millions of dollars in Medical Device Stock..
@MplsMe @BurnsieMN @RWPUSA Thats not an endorsement...? He wrote an article for them once, so he is considered a "contributor." Check your facts Kriss!
@sasha4th Well, if you did what I suggested and looked up the audit comittee he served on, you'd see that while it's technically a "board" role, he legally must be completely independent of any management. He literally had no influence on any sort of positions, he just prevented fraud...
@sasha4th While you're at it, Google what an independent auditor does for organizations like this. He was BY LAW independent of management. He went through their finances to ensure they weren't committing fraud. Look up the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of '02 which outlines the role.

@HotlineJosh Maybe if the author, Don Davis, spent more time listening to Painter and less time pandering to the DFL establishment, he would know that Painters platform is much broader than Tina's and his stances on most issues are much more defined.
@HotlineJosh Also in this article: "Painter is known for his scowl and direct comments. Smith usually wears a smile and is soft spoken."		He literally can't smile because his face is partially paralyzed. So not only are they misrepresenting his views, they're also making fun of his disability
@HotlineJosh When Americans pay more for healthcare, the value of Tina's portfolio increases. We can't have lawmakers who have such blatant conflicts of interest trying to regulate industries that are so important to bettering American's lives.
@HotlineJosh Also, why doesn't this article mention Tina's support of PolyMet, which has caused a civil war within the DFL? Why don't they talk about the reason Richard opposes Tina's push to repeal the ACA Medical Device Tax, which is that she has millions of dollars in Medical Device stock
@HotlineJosh Just because he goes on cable news to talk about Trump does NOT mean thats all he cares about, it's just what they hire him to talk about. He has a robust knowledge on all issues and hasn't hidden from taking  a stance, popular or not. Tina just says "I'm still researching that"
@HotlineJosh He's not running entirely on an anti-Trump message, although it is part of his platform. At every town hall event he does (4 or 5 a week) he talks about ALL the issues that matter to Minnesotans. The environment, healthcare, election reform, ending corruption, etc.

@BurnsieMN @RWPMinnesota The GOP is able to hold control of the Senate because evasive leaders like Right Wing Tina refuse to talk about issues and Establishment hacks like Ken Martin try to force qualified candidates out of the race. We need leaders who are Democrats on the issues, not in label only.
@GinaGenochio @RichinMN @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Would you rather he run as a liberal independent candidate and split the vote in the general, leaving Housley as the clear winner? He is a Democrat on all the issues that matter to us Minnesotans.

@stitchingart @2017whyjeebus @jan72294 @TinaSmithMN @brycetache Farm Fest isn‚Äôt a debate, Janet! It is a  forum about energy and agricultural policy. There is not supposed to be any interaction between the candidates. They just go down the line and answer the questions. We want an ACTUAL debate where the issues that matter most are discussed.
@brycetache @TinaSmithMN It‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúre-election‚Äù because she was never elected in the first place. She was appointed and now she feels entitled to the job, even though she‚Äôs never proved to voters why she deserves it. She wants a coronation, Minnesotans want an election. #EvasiveLeadership
@2017whyjeebus @stitchingart @jan72294 @TinaSmithMN @brycetache There is no debate. Tina prefers evasive leadership over ethical leadership... Janet is lying.

@JustinPerpich @TinaSmithMN Yup. But those same tariffs are hurting the soy bean farmers in southern Minnesota. Trump's plan is unsustainable for long term growth in the state.
@postcards4usaMN @JoeyTodak1 @TinaSmithMN @RWPUSA I‚Äôm sorry, but farmfest is not a debate. It‚Äôs a forum about farm policy. There is no interaction between the candidates. It‚Äôs a Q&amp;A but not a debate.
@hansonDigby @marieballardmar @MistyWooEngle @RWPUSA He's the only DFL Senate candidate who actually cares about the environment enough to speak up on the PolyMet land-swap. Is environmentalism part of the Republican platform now?
@Michael46737091 @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN He‚Äôs a clown for standing up to the int‚Äôl mining companies that want to destroy our waterways and put an end the growing eco-tourism industry in NE Minnesota? I, for one, am glad have Richard fighting to save Lake Superior, the BWCA, and all the waterways in MN from pollution!
@jamrockstar @NickHannula @RWPMinnesota @jamrockstar I‚Äôm still waiting for you to delete these tweets which have been proven to be false. It‚Äôs disappointing to see a fellow DFLer tweet out literal fake news.
@g_r_r_l You don‚Äôt think that if Bernie ran as an independent in 2016, he would‚Äôve received at least 25 percent of the vote? I think you‚Äôre mistaken. BernieBros turned out to vote for Jill-F‚Äôing-Stein. Plenty would say ‚Äúscrew the establishment who doesn‚Äôt event want to hear my views.‚Äù
It sucks that MN‚Äôs appointed Senator @TinaSmithMN supports these horrible tariffs. We need to elect someone who will stand up to the Trump administration and make him stop implementing these harmful tariffs. #VoteOutInaction #PeopleForPainter https://t.co/VsQuYeAh79
@g_r_r_l So you‚Äôd rather have Bernie run as an independent, steal 25-50% of the Dem candidate‚Äôs vote, and have another four years of Trump than let someone with a different label be involved in the party politics? Establishment insiders don‚Äôt make sense to me....
@_RyanWinkler @jamrockstar @Scotus @RWPUSA His role in the nominations of Alito and Roberts were limited to ensuring they had no financial conflicts of interest (sort of like Tina‚Äôs millions of dollars in medical device stock that make her too conflicted to regulate the healthcare industry...) He had no role beyond that.
@g_r_r_l Because Democrats are doing a great job with the current number of people we have in the party? We used to be the big tent party, but today we close the gates and send people away. We won‚Äôt win elections if we don‚Äôt let anyone new in.
@MplsRoseCJ @Jeepnpeep @SenTinaSmith She changed her stance about two weeks ago, before then all she‚Äôd say is that she supports a path towards universal coverage. With millions of dollars in medical device stock, I‚Äôm skeptical she‚Äôd ever actually push for a true single-payer plan. If divested, maybe I‚Äôd believe her.
@2018DemWave @RWPUSA @CNN If you think the Republicans are the only problem, you‚Äôre sorely mistaken. They‚Äôre more obviously corrupt, but we certainly have plenty of corrupt Democrats who are beholden to corporations. That‚Äôs why we need Richard to introduce his Ethics Package in Congress! #PeopleForPainter https://t.co/7VMMdsWuRS
@ColorMeBlue2018 @RWPUSA @KarinHousley Honestly, these are pointless to post anymore. Richard has explained time and time again that his role in the SCOTUS appointments were limited to ensuring they had no financial conflicts of interest. He has also said he will NEVER vote to approve for a Trump appointee for SCOTUS.
@TheJarlequin @RWPMinnesota Check out the Richard Painter Facebook page! All of his events and radio appearances are listed on the ‚Äúevents‚Äù page!
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN MULTIPLE FOLKS?! OMG! 		When I was there I saw lines out the door by his booth waiting to talk to him. When I got the chance to chat with him, he talked to me for 10 minutes and answered all the questions I had about his policies and past affiliations.

@BurnsieMN @jamrockstar Ahh... The old video town-hall with pre-vetter questions trick! Erik Paulsen made that one famous in Minnesota... So Tina's in great company there.
@jamrockstar @NickHannula @RWPMinnesota Hey, Jammy! Did you hear your favorite Senator's claim-to-fame land swap deal was defeated in Congress today? Where's she gonna get all that PolyMet money now??
@jamrockstar @NickHannula @RWPMinnesota Subpar work? He did it right? What part was subpar? The fact that you thought that he got something wrong (when in reality, he didn't) he's subpar? Maybe Tina is paying too much for her FEC compliance people if Richard's can get it right for only $5,000! More money-More problems
@jamrockstar @BurnsieMN Oh, really?  When did she have her last town hall?
@jamrockstar @NickHannula @RWPMinnesota So now the campaign is paying their employees too much? Stay consistent, Jammy!!
@NickHannula @jamrockstar @RWPMinnesota That's for the "pre-primary" filing, which needs to be in 12 days before the primary or the general. These are the quarterly report's guidelines. Stop spreading misinformation, google is your friend when finding FEC regulations. https://t.co/Ivtcp4k7XJ
@jamrockstar @NickHannula @RWPMinnesota Nick is incorrect. That's for the "pre-primary" filing, which needs to be in 12 days before the primary or the general. So. You should definitely apologize for lying to your followers, Jammy. Especially now that you've been proven wrong for a second time. https://t.co/YwrRiQfcNK
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN The reception WAS really good at the convention. He managed to get 20 percent of the vote after, as you point out often, identifying as a Republican a month earlier... That's impressive. He must've done something right, and I'm sure being there to answer every question helped...
@2018DemWave @RWPUSA STOP POSTING THIS! Richard made it clear that if he loses in the primary, he will not run in the general. Tina has't made the same promise 		If you want to know where he agrees and disagrees with the platform, watch his videos and check for yourself. He answers questions everyday
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN He was at the DFL convention in Rochester all three days answering questions from anyone who came up to him. Tina stopped by, delivered her speech, and then left. She didn't talk to voters because she expects a coronation. Richard is asking for our votes, Tina's expecting them.
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN It's too bad she isn't talking to Minnesota voters during her first election on the top of the ticket...
@jamrockstar @NickHannula @RWPMinnesota Here is the evidence once more that it was in the mail on Sunday, July 15th at 5:02 PM. THAT IS ON TIME. Stop lying, Jammy.		https://t.co/vrY24dY8eD

@NickHannula @jamrockstar @RWPMinnesota 7% of the budget, but 100% fewer PACs and Dark Money donors. Minnesotans notice these things. #EthicalLeadership #PeopleForPainter
@jamrockstar @NickHannula @RWPMinnesota That‚Äôs what a real grassroots campaign looks like... Staff members who will take less than they deserve to make a difference for all Americans. That sounds like a fantastic way to run a campaign... They could quit whenever they want if they thought they were being exploited.
@jamrockstar @RWPMinnesota You should delete this and apologize to your followers for spreading lies. He complied with the rules, it was mailed in on time. Don't let your your bias get in the way of facts, Jammy.
@jamrockstar @RWPMinnesota He raised 171K overall after raising almost nothing in Q1. Saying he raised "about 180K" is acceptable, although it is an over-estimate. 		Check the tracking number. It was in FedEx's possession on 7/15. 		Jammy is playing fast and loose with facts again.		https://t.co/vrY24dY8eD
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN He doesn't need 4 million dollars to constantly run ads about eating donuts to gain grassroots support from voters. He is out there everyday talking to the voters in person and answering all of their questions. That's what will win elections, not dirty PAC money and dark money.
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN You're right. Senate races aren't won on Twitter. They're won at the voting booths and by talking to voters about issues that matter to them. Richard has been doing that everyday for months. He has the ability to bring people into the party who normally wouldn't vote for the DFL. https://t.co/uNOS1kK3BP
@jamrockstar Obviously there need to be rules, but there also has to be a time when the candidates can actually interact. Otherwise it‚Äôs just two Q&amp;A‚Äôs happening at the same time, and we won‚Äôt see why one is a better candidate than the other. The Farm Fest forum is not a debate.
@jamrockstar Farm Fest isn‚Äôt a debate. It‚Äôs a forum about farm policy. There is no time for rebuttals, cross examination, or any sort of interaction between the candidates. That‚Äôs not a debate. 		Lori will be there, so if it is a debate, your original tweet is pointless. But it‚Äôs not.

@jamrockstar @RWPUSA @kenmartin73 Check Chris's tweet with the email from Ken Martin. As of May 2018, there hadn't been an investigation of the harassment that Chris reported in December 2016. That's not okay. Also I can't find Ken's statement, did he delete it?
@angryUTdude @ChrisHoroshak @kenmartin73 But in his email (shown above) @kenmartin73 said Chris had to file a formal complaint on the DFL website. It doesn't exist. We shouldn't make it hard for victims to report something like this. When they speak up we should listen and take action. That didn't happen here.
@ChrisHoroshak @kenmartin73 I'm sorry you've had to go through this, Chris. We shouldn't make victims jump through hoops to have the perpetrators be held accountable. I'm a proud Democrat, but I am extremely disappointed in the DFL for putting you through this. The leadership is clearly in the wrong here.
@angryUTdude @ChrisHoroshak Try to find the formal complaint document on https://t.co/OblVa4AaKg. I've combed through every page and can't find one. If @kenmartin73 wanted Chris's harassers to be held accountable, he would've sent him the form immediately after being informed of the harassment in 2016.
@ChrisHoroshak I can't find the formal complaint document on https://t.co/OblVa4AaKg. I've looked through the entire website, but I don't think it exists. If @kenmartin73 wanted you to file the complaint, he would've given you the form directly. He should resign immediately. #KickOutKen
@jesseflamme @RWPUSA @ChrisHoroshak @Jim_Jordan
@WhitCourtCraft @BurnsieMN @TinaSmithMN It's ridiculous to support a candidate who has done nothing to prove that she's the best for the job. She ignores her primary challengers, even when they raise valid concerns about her ability to lead. She doesn't hold town halls and won't debate. Why should I vote for her?
@jamrockstar Chris Horoshak is a victim too and Ken Martin did nothing about it. No investigation. No firings. You can't stand up against Nolan's inaction and completely ignore the fact that Martin had all the information about harassment against Chris and did nothing about it.
@WhitCourtCraft @BurnsieMN @TinaSmithMN And one of the reasons he left the GOP was that they were completely backwards on healthcare. He has believed in Single-Payer for years, while Tina was still saying "we need to look at all the options." He knew it was the right choice, even though it was unpopular at the time.
@WhitCourtCraft @BurnsieMN @TinaSmithMN Sorry, I missed one of them. "Why do you think she wont push for single-payer?" 	I think that because the value of her medical device stocks will fall, and she will have less money to spend. If she divested her portfolio, I'd maybe believe her.
@jamrockstar @RWPUSA @kenmartin73 Are you really going to attack Richard for calling on the DFL to hold those responsible for sexual harassment accountable for their actions?
@RFitzjarrald @RWPUSA @michael_j_bravo @ChrisHoroshak People need to be held accountable for their actions. Ken Martin should resign immediately for allowing a perpetrator of sexual harassment to continue holding a place of power within a DFL campaign. We can't let enablers continue running our country. Full stop.
@jamrockstar @RWPUSA @kenmartin73 If Ken Martin had such a great investigation, why did one of the perpetrators start working for a US Senator in January 2018? (Rumor has it the person in question finally left after Painter wrote a letter to Ken Martin in May 2018, more than a YEAR after Chris reported it)
@mandammad @jamrockstar @epmurphymn Seriously, that‚Äôs almost as funny as Tina‚Äôs campaign trying to say they are ‚Äúgrassroots!‚Äù You can‚Äôt be grassroots if you take PAC money! @swansonnolanMN @TinaSmithMN

@WhitCourtCraft @BurnsieMN @TinaSmithMN @SenTinaSmith I‚Äôd love to ask her, but she doesn‚Äôt hold town halls so I can‚Äôt before the primary		I think Painter is ethical because he has proven he is time and time again. He refuses to take PAC money, has no conflicted stock holdings, and holds the corrupt accountable no matter their party.
@BurnsieMN @WhitCourtCraft @TinaSmithMN Even at the convention she was saying ‚ÄúI support a path to universal healthcare,‚Äù but would tip-toe around questions about what plan she supports, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gathering information‚Äù which really means polling to see which is best for pandering to voters https://t.co/Dd5bcwRDti
@WhitCourtCraft @BurnsieMN @TinaSmithMN When did she change her mind? Just a few weeks ago she wouldn‚Äôt say if she supported a single-payer system.

@1DLowther @Karoli A Republican that supports single-payer healthcare, wants to save the environment, hates corporations, thinks Kavanaugh isn‚Äôt qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, wants to get money out of politics, is pro-choice, pro-LGBTQ+ rights, and pro criminal-justice reform? That‚Äôs new..
@tomjasser820 @TinaSmithMN Smith urged the Senate to repeal the ACA medical device tax, which helped millions get affordable insurance, while owning millions of dollars in medical device companies stock! That is corruption and we can't tolerate it from anyone trying to represent us, regardless of party.
@tomjasser820 @TinaSmithMN She won't come down hard on them about pricing, because when American's cost of healthcare increases, the value of Tina's stock portfolio increases too. She needs to divest if she is going to be involved in regulating the medical industry.
@deanbphillips @hansonDigby Excited to vote for you!! Erik Paulsen has been around for far too long and hasn‚Äôt done anything but help the rich get richer. We need someone like you to fight to help the rest of us!
@Rachelghanson12 @hansonDigby @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews @TinaSmithMN Is Donald Trump a Democrat then? He switched parties, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a Democrat anymore...
@WhitCourtCraft @RWPMinnesota It‚Äôs just a forum about agricultural policy with no interaction between candidates. They will not be able to actually debate, just answer the question.
@TinaSmithMN It‚Äôs a shame you are too conflicted to actually help Minnesotans get affordable healthcare. You should recuse yourself from all legislation regarding healthcare due to your millions of dollars in medical device stock. Would you rather fill your pockets or help Minnesotans?
@Taz8571 @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews No, but our friends are not our enemies. And Richard Painter has proven himself to be a champion for the environment, single-payer healthcare, ethical reform, and election reform, which makes him our friend.
@Taz8571 @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews So... What your saying is he‚Äôs not a Republican... He‚Äôs a Democrat with a solidly liberal platform! He changed parties because the GOP no longer represented any of his core beliefs, and the DFL does. He cares more about issues than labels, which is what our country needs. #Ethics

@WhitCourtCraft @RWPMinnesota @TinaSmithMN @SenTinaSmith Isn‚Äôt part of her job to represent her constituents? How will we know who the best candidate for that is if we don‚Äôt see them together, debating their differences. Debates are especially important now because Tina has never been elected and we dont know where she stands on issues
@WhitCourtCraft @RWPMinnesota That‚Äôs a forum to discuss issues related to FARMING, nothing else. Candidates from all the different races will be there and there is no time for rebuttals or cross examination. That‚Äôs NOT a debate. Minnesotans deserve to hear their candidates discuss ALL the issues that matter
@DainoMichael @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews If talking about the issues is a ‚Äúwaste of time‚Äù for Tina, maybe she should find a new line of work. Minnesotans deserve to hear from their candidates on a wide range of topics before they make their choice in August.
@SUMinnesota @deanbphillips How many town halls has @TinaSmithMN held since taking office? I think about as many as Paulsen has in the last year. ZERO!
@SUMinnesota @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews That‚Äôs not true? Do the candidates have time for rebuttals and cross examinations? Are they going to discuss all the issues that matter to Minnesotans? The answer to both questions are NO. They get to answer a few questions about farming, with no discussion. That‚Äôs not a Debate.
@hansonDigby @Rachelghanson12 @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews @TinaSmithMN I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs a Democrat, otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt support single-payer, saving the environment, getting money out of politics, breaking up monopolies, LGBTQ+ marriage, women‚Äôs reproductive rights, a progressive tax system, ethics and election reforms, and impeachment...
@Taz8571 @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews I did. It says DFL Candidate for US Senate from Minnesota. And most of his platform looks even more progressive than Sen. Smith‚Äôs! You could google it if you don‚Äôt believe me!!
@SUMinnesota @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews If Tina wants to pass Farmfest off of as a debate, maybe she shouldn‚Äôt be running for office at all because she doesn‚Äôt want to have anyone question her decisions. Do we want an election or a coronation?
@SUMinnesota @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews That‚Äôs not a debate. It‚Äôs a candidate forum with candidates from all the other races (Governor, AG, Auditor, etc..)and it‚Äôs specifically focused on farm policy.

@ChrisNagel_SP @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews How can we get behind her if we don‚Äôt know where she stands on some important issues?

@Taz8571 @RWPUSA @MesabiDailyNews So he‚Äôs a Republican that supports single-payer healthcare, wants to save the environment, hates corporations, thinks Kavanaugh isn‚Äôt qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, wants to get money out of politics, is pro-choice, pro-LGBTQ+ rights, and pro criminal-justice reform?

@ColorMeBlue2018 @RWPMinnesota This is absolutely false. He has stated unequivocally that if he loses the Primary he won‚Äôt run in the general. He knows how important it is to keep this seat blue.

Huh, sounds corrupt to me
@RWPUSA @james69485021 This bill is exactly what we need in Washington right now, and you are the perfect person to introduce it. Keep fighting for ethics Mr. Painter! Someday the whole country will realize what a corrupt society we live in! https://t.co/EhTZaRnxb0
@james69485021 @RWPUSA He posted this bill a couple weeks ago, which is the strongest ethics reform ever introduced to the Senate.

@nurseniceyes @RWPUSA Do you mean like Tina‚Äôs ties to the international billionaires and Russian oligarchs who own the Glencore mine that Tina supports so vehemently? The one that will pollute Minnesota‚Äôs waterways? Huh, I guess you replied to the wrong person...
@ArtActCoalition @RWPUSA He‚Äôs calling out corruption. It‚Äôs just as bad when our side is corrupt as when their side is. We will never get to a single-payer healthcare system if we don‚Äôt end the horrible cycle of corruption in Washington. #EthicalLeadership #PeopleForPainter
@poetofscience @RWPUSA @blindmansregret Gender doesn‚Äôt matter here. When a politician is corrupt, they must be voted out. And Sen. Smith is corrupt. I‚Äôll happily vote for Klobuchar and Erin Murphy, but Smith is owned by corporations and cares more about her wallet than Minnesotan‚Äôs healthcare costs.
RT @__Arthur_Dent__: @RWPUSA This is more than a "conflict of interest" it's self-serving - corruption.
@Patrick2Ford @RWPUSA Didn‚Äôt Sen. Smith own millions of dollars in medical device stock while tryibg the repeal the ACA medical device tax? How corrupt is that?!?!
@BurnsieMN @DanHalverson1 @TinaSmithMN And they'd be even lower if our Lt. Governor/Appointed Senator didn't have so much money invested in the medical device industry. She has a lot to lose if healthcare prices drop... #Ethics
@TinaSmithMN It'd be nice if you also addressed the high price of medical devices too...Oh....Wait... You won't do that because you have millions of dollars invested in those companies! How can you fix the problem of healthcare costs if you won't address one of the biggest factors? #Ethics??

@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics It may not be illegal (yet), but it is highly unethical. How can we expect her to regulate the medical device industry so it works for us instead of for her portfolio? She should divest if she wants people to be able to trust that she isn't too conflicted to represent us.
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics She doesn't care about getting rid of the criminals in power, she just cares about her own election. Maybe if she spent less time playing politics and more time focusing on representing us, she'd know that Minnesotans want to hold Trump accountable!
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics You‚Äôre right. I only know how she thinks in front of her donors who can afford a table at one of her pay to enter dinners. She won‚Äôt debate or hold town halls, so we may never know what she actually thinks about the issues! 		Don't just take my word for it	https://t.co/ihCD2WGM4v
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics Senator Smith believes that we should wait until 2020 to get rid of Trump because he is "popular" in parts of the state. She thinks Minnesotans are fine with him as President... 		That seems like a pretty bad judge of character for someone who wants to be a Senator.
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics I can't find any donations to the GOP in the last 14 years. And 14 years ago, they weren't the same party they are today. What can be said is Painter made the right decision leaving to become a Democrat!		How many MILLIONS of dollars does Tina have tied up in conflicted stock?
@browntailedhawk @RWPUSA Why do you think Smith would do better in a general than Painter?
@RileysDi @RWPUSA Also, to ease your mind... painter has said that if he loses the Primary he will not run as an independent. Smith, on the other hand, has offered no such reassurances.
@RileysDi @RWPUSA We might not have a few more years. Trump is rapidly destroying the pillars of our democracy and if no one will stand up to him, who knows what will happen. Smith has said she would rather win her re-election in 2020 than impeach the Treasonous Liar-in-Chief #WeNeedEthicalLeaders
@GoldeeGreen Lol, look at Smith‚Äôs most recent FEC report. Soros gave the maximum amount allowed to her.
@OHOHTVC15 @TinaSmithMN That‚Äôs what she wants you to think. She is too conflicted to help Americans get better healthcare, because she has 45 percent of her net worth tied up in Medical Device stocks. She also introduced a bill that will destroy Minnesota‚Äôs waterways and pollute our beautiful state.
@browntailedhawk @RWPUSA Minnesotans have never liked being told what to do. We want a say in who will represent us. Tina smith won‚Äôt debate Richard or even hold Town Halls, because she wants a coronation, not an election. Richard has been all around the state answering any question asked of him.
@BooConley @RWPUSA @RealNoraC Check out his website, where you can find his platform, or watch videos of his town halls on Facebook or Youtube!
@BooConley @RWPUSA @RealNoraC He wants to move to Bernie‚Äôs ‚ÄúMedicare For All‚Äù single-payer healthcare system. He believes climate change is man made, that we need to protect social security, that privatizing the VA is bad for Vets and shouldn‚Äôt happen, and he is in favor of common sense gun control measures.
@sukihd @RWPUSA It doesn‚Äôt matter how many Democratic Senators there are if none of them will stand up and demand impeachment proceedings begin. Sen. Smith has said she doesn‚Äôt want to impeach because it‚Äôs ‚Äúbad politics.‚Äù She says she‚Äôd rather wait until 2020, but we can‚Äôt wait that long.....
@LaurieKrebsbac1 @RWPUSA If he ran as a Republican, he would be laughed off the stage when he started talking about a single-payer healthcare system or ending citizens united. He is far more liberal than a lot of Democrats in Congress today.
@PsycheSojourn @RWPUSA @J867Smith @TinaSmithMN Also, who cares how long they‚Äôve been Democrats. Look at the issues they‚Äôre running on, and decide who will be a better representative for ALL Minnesotans. If we keep kicking people out of the tent just for their past affiliation, we will never win back Congress or the presidency
@PsycheSojourn @RWPUSA @J867Smith @TinaSmithMN Franken hasn‚Äôt endorsed her in this race. He said she would be a fine replacement when he was forced to resign. On the issues he was strongest on, he is in agreement with Painter more than Smith.
@OperaStrange @RWPUSA @ManMadeMoon ‚ÄúShe deserves to be re-elected on her service, not celebrity‚Äù.... She is being elected for the first time, not ‚Äúre-elected.‚Äù She refuses to debate Painter. If she won‚Äôt prove to Minnesotans that she is the stronger candidate, why should we vote for her?
@OperaStrange @RWPUSA @ManMadeMoon Democrats also care about getting to Single-Payer healthcare, Tina is too beholden to the medical industry with her millions of dollars in medical device stocks to fight for healthcare that works for us. Dems also care about stopping the Trump tariffs, Tina supports them.
@OperaStrange @RWPUSA @ManMadeMoon ‚ÄúShe has a documented record of fighting for Democratic issues‚Äù- Democrats care about protecting our environment, Tina is allowing international mining companies destroy our waterways. Dems also care about getting money out of politics, Tina takes millions from PACs.
@ForecasterEnten Do you know of any public polling around the DFL Primary for the senate special election in Minnesota? On the ground in Minnesota it feels like Richard Painter may somehow beat Tina Smith. It will be a fun one to watch!!
@HHanson56746554 @annettamarie Why not have him speak out on both Cable TV and the Senate floor? That way he can bring his constant message of ethical leadership into fruition! Sen. Smith doesn't use her voice in the Senate for anything besides destroying our environment and standing up for corporations!
@HHanson56746554 @Welcome2MN @Bernie7gal @EnGardeGo @RWPUSA Actions speak louder than words and Richards actions have proven his devotion to helping make America a better place for future generations. Labels shouldn't matter. When you focus on the issues, it's clear that Painter is to the left of Tina on issues that matter to Minnesotans.
@AM950Radio How does he plan to fix the dangerously conservative balance on the Supreme Court?
@jamrockstar @TinaSmithMN The facts are obvious. Trump is breaking the emoluments clause every day, he obstructed Justice, and...oh yeah...HE JUST COMMITTED TREASON! THREE IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES BEFORE MUELLER‚ÄôS INVESTIGATION IS EVEN FINISHED! Too bad Tina is busy playing politics... https://t.co/0mx9D3fC2N
@JustinPerpich Have you looked into what he did for these organizations? His job was BY LAW independent of management. He audited finances, reviewed accounting practices, and detected fraud. Look up the Sarbanes-Oxley act on ‚Äò02 which Painter helped craft, it lays out the rules around this job.
@erichc21 @JustinPerpich Her problem is that nearly 40 percent of her net worth ($11 mil.) is tied up medical device stocks. She‚Äôs the corporate candidate because she‚Äôll vote with those corporations over the people she‚Äôs supposed to represent. How can she regulate the health industry while so conflicted?
@JAHaluska @TinaSmithMN Sen. Smith would rather play politics than focus on saving our country from the corrupt and treasonous Trump administration. She‚Äôs too worried about being re-elected to hold him accountable for his actions. #WeNeedEthicalLeadership #VotePainter https://t.co/0mx9D3fC2N
@KylieYearwood @TinaSmithMN @SenateMajLdr @SenTinaSmith Now it would be nice to see her push hard for impeachment hearings to begin, instead of playing politics with treason.

@Julesarose @TinaSmithMN @SenateMajLdr She‚Äôs too busy playing politics to actually push for impeachment.

@javimorillo @Stay_Resolute @TinaSmithMN @StopBigMoney From what I‚Äôve heard, the DFL has had many reports about this violation in the past month, but conveniently couldn‚Äôt convene a meeting until Aug. 18th, 4 days after the primary, so nothing can be done. But that‚Äôs insider politics for you, always rigging things in their favor...
@javimorillo @Stay_Resolute @TinaSmithMN @StopBigMoney I agree too. But the reason the endorsement matters is that the DFL endorsed candidate gets fundraising support, phone bank lists, etc. from the DFL. If Tina can‚Äôt play by the rules, she should have no more support than Richard has.
@RichinMN @TinaSmithMN @StopBigMoney Yes. It‚Äôs one of the main reasons I‚Äôm voting for @RWPUSA. He has refused all PAC money and Dark Money donations.
@JacobAWohl @Cernovich I think that kids being locked up in internment camps is probably something reporters should focus on. And same with the president siding with Putin over the IC. But maybe I‚Äôm wrong? (I‚Äôm not)
@javimorillo @Stay_Resolute @TinaSmithMN @StopBigMoney I don‚Äôt know who your talking about, because Painter did seek the DFL endorsement. He received 25% of the vote just one month after entering the race... But who really cares what the self-righteous establishment delegates have to say, we‚Äôll hear from all Minnesotans on Aug. 14th.
@Stay_Resolute @TinaSmithMN @StopBigMoney Let‚Äôs be fair, she shouldn‚Äôt have the DFL endorsement, because she broke their bylaws by endorsing Keith Ellison over the DFL endorsed Matt Pelikan. Rules stipulate all funding and the DFL endorsement should be revoked.
@jamrockstar @MartySipes2 @TinaSmithMN If Smith really had a strong voice, she‚Äôd use hold town halls and debate Richard, but she keeps refusing to do so. I wonder why? Do you think she‚Äôs worried he‚Äôll talk about her massive conflicts of interest? Or maybe she‚Äôs worried he‚Äôll talk about mining. I‚Äôm not sure what it is?
@BurnsieMN @marieballardmar @RWPUSA Seriously though. How is it a net gain for Superior Forest? I have to bet you‚Äôve never been up there to see the beautiful nature that the mining could destroy, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be making such a false statement.
@BurnsieMN @ScamperDPenguin @RWPUSA To be frank, I‚Äôm more worried about someone continually making money from stocks in an industry that needs serious reform in order to work for Americans and keep us alive, than someone who worked as an independent financial auditor once for an organization I disagree with.
@BurnsieMN @ScamperDPenguin @RWPUSA Sen. Smith may not be insider trading, but she is certainly benefiting from owning MILLIONS of dollars in medical device stocks while she tries to ‚Äúregulate‚Äù the industry. Whether it‚Äôs legal or not, it is unethical and corrupt to be making money off the laws you pass.
@BurnsieMN @marieballardmar @RWPUSA I‚Äôm still waiting for your reason why the PolyMet mine is a net gain for the Superior Forest. I‚Äôm not vilifying anyone, and if asking our Members of Congress why they support something disliked by many constituents is vilifying them, maybe they should find another line of work.
@HHanson56746554 @BurnsieMN @RWPUSA In fact, H, watch the video of his anti-corruption rally from this evening on his Facebook and Twitter. He answered that exact question! Looks like you have to find another reason to hate him!
@HHanson56746554 @BurnsieMN @RWPUSA Why don‚Äôt you go to one of his events and ask him! He‚Äôs taken questions at every one I‚Äôve been too, and that question has come up multiple times in town halls posted online. Stop lying, H, do sone research.
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA The date doesn‚Äôt matter because she hasn‚Äôt changed her opinion since. If she had, it would be publicly available. Unless she was doing it in a closed door donor dinner with the PolyMet execs.... We need to impeach NOW!
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA It matters because you are implying that she cares about the DFL, but she is breaking the DFL bylaws by endorsing Ellison and, based on the rules, should have her endorsement revoked. If she really cared about the DFL she‚Äôd endorse Pelikan.
@BurnsieMN @marieballardmar @RWPUSA Facts matter... Tell that to Smith who won‚Äôt debate the facts of the disasterous land swap with Painter. If it‚Äôs such a net gain, why won‚Äôt she talk about it?
@BurnsieMN @marieballardmar @RWPUSA How was it a net gain for Superior Forest?? What about the boundary waters? Was it a net gain for our waterways too? How do you feel about the DFL SD7‚Äôs complete denunciation of the mining? Where do you live? Clearly not in NE Minnesota, where ALL democrats oppose the amendment!!

@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA How does Tina feel about DFL endorsed AG candidate Matt Pelikan? Just wondering...
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA She didn‚Äôt say it recently? This audio is from a few weeks ago. If she has changed her opinion, maybe she should come out publicly and say it! She could also debate Richard and publicly talk about her opinion of politics over country! #VoteOutInaction
@SenTinaSmith @HELPCmteDems I have one solution, but your medical device stocks may lose some value..... So I bet you won't even discuss the idea. You need to divest or recuse yourself from any legislation related to healthcare!
@BurnsieMN @OverTables @SenTinaSmith Richard Nixon was EXTREMELY popular when he was impeached. He had just won a landslide victory and had most of America on his side. Just because he is popular DOESN'T mean he should get away with treason, or that we shouldn't talk about impeachment.
@BurnsieMN @OverTables @SenTinaSmith She can start pushing for impeachment proceedings by using her public position and far-reaching voice to influence her Republican colleagues. She can go on any news channel at a moments notice to talk about Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors, but she'd rather play politics...
@TinaSmithMN @RWPMinnesota is giving his shirts away for free and he can't have nearly as much money on hand as your campaign. Besides, you don't need money from us, you have the PACs and Dark Money donors on your side. Seriously, $25 for a shirt is a bigger rip off than Trump University!

@jamrockstar @zaagiy @miasberman @RWPMinnesota Is there some public calendar with her future events? I‚Äôve looked for one, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find it. I‚Äôd love to have the chance to ask her some questions, because she refuses to debate and I don‚Äôt think she will ever publicly answer them.

@jamrockstar @zaagiy @miasberman @RWPMinnesota Now that I think about it... has she held ANY public events in the last 5 months? There certainly haven‚Äôt been any town-halls. I went to one of Richard‚Äôs ‚ÄúPints with Painter‚Äù a couple weeks ago and he answered every question I had. He talked to us for three hours.
@jamrockstar @zaagiy @miasberman @RWPMinnesota Based on my count (which might be low because it‚Äôs based on their public calendar), in the last week Painter attended more than ten events and held multiple town-halls. When was the last time Tina attended a public event where constituents could ask unfiltered questions of her?
@HHanson56746554 @c_r_evans Who is the amendment named after? Who snuck it onto an unrelated bill as a rider? Who has taken thousands of dollars from PolyMet executives? Klobuchar and the others are complicit, but they didn‚Äôt introduce the amendment and haven‚Äôt touted it as their biggest accomplishment
@jamrockstar @zaagiy @miasberman No, just the people who run the company. Because that‚Äôs sooo much better....
@Bobbeh1 @jessvanb @RWPUSA Watch his town halls on Youtube, he often goes after Klobuchar for it as well. But right now there's a way that we can replace Smith with someone who ACTUALLY cares about the issue, which isn't an option in Klobuchar's race.
@c_r_evans What's extremely on-brand is Sen. Smith claiming to support clean water while everyone knows she was the biggest proponent of the PolyMet land swap in the Minnesota congressional delegation. There's nothing sexist about getting angry when you are blatantly lied to.
@Ilovemypuppy @SenTinaSmith Caring about our planet and voting for Smith are in direct conflict. She doesn't care about the environment at all, in fact she is selling out to international mining companies who want to destroy our lakes and rivers. I don't trust Tina to represent anyone but the billionaires
@DaviSense @robdoar @jessvanb What's classless is going up in front of a crowd of progressives and saying "I'm just like you" while taking millions of dollars in PAC money, being pro-sulfide mining, not supporting single-payer, and refusing to debate her primary opponent.
@robdoar @jessvanb Did you guess that because they are people that care about pollution? It's nice to know that everyone accepts that Smith supporters are against clean water.
@Bobbeh1 @jessvanb @RWPUSA How despicable is it that Tina Smith claims to be pro-clean water, while leading the way for PolyMet to come into our state and destroy our waterways with sulfide mining. How despicable that Tina Smith won't debate Richard Painter because she "doesn't have time."
Progressives know when we are being lied to and Tina Smith saying she supports clean water is one of the most blatant lies out there. She's no progressive. She won't even support Bernies Medicare for All plan, which almost all Minnesotans support. https://t.co/mL3zfrxFPT
@miasberman She was blatantly lying to the crowd. I wasn't there but I watched a live stream, and if I were there I would've been the loudest person in the room when she claimed that she is working for clean water. Thats a laughable comment, when she is an architect of the PolyMet land swap.
@SenTinaSmith @WHO @nikkihaley @SenBooker @timkaine @SenatorShaheen @ChrisVanHollen @SenatorCardin @SenMarkey @SenBobCasey @SenWarren @SenatorHassan Just like you side with the special interests on healthcare and the environment.

@SenTinaSmith @MNSoyGrowers Yet you wont stand up against the tariffs that are harming the soybean farmers. In fact, you support them!!

@bomber9996 @SenTinaSmith She‚Äôll never support a bill that actually fixes the problem of rising costs of healthcare because it would lead to lower prices of medical devices, which she has millions of dollars of stock in.

He was never a ‚Äúconservative Republican,‚Äù he was a very liberal Republican. Watch one of his town halls on YouTube, he explains it well
@BethR_27516 @DaphneDoGood1 @Kat41150B @StarTribune @RWPMinnesota This is misleading. He worked as an independent auditor for the Diana Davis Spencer foundation. He was legally REQUIRED to be independent of the organization. This was one of his jobs before running, reviewing finances and searching for fraud. Look up the Sarbanes-Oxley act
@ResistResource @StarTribune @RWPUSA This is a blatant lie. He has NEVER taken money from the Heritage Foundation.
@joan_generic @SenTinaSmith @RWPUSA He‚Äôs also the only candidate to publicly support single-payer healthcare and impeachment of Trump. He won‚Äôt take dark money or donations from PACS, his campaign is entirely grassroots. As an ethics lawyer, he knows what needs to change in DC to help fix our gov‚Äôt. #VotePainter
@joan_generic @SenTinaSmith I support @RWPUSA He is the only candidate who is actually pro-environment. Sen. Smith is responsible for allowing an international mining company to come into Minnesota and pollute our lakes and rivers. Look up the Smith Amendment and the PolyMet land swap.
@Calvanij @StarTribune @RWPUSA Which positions? Seriously, he hasn‚Äôt changed his views in a long time, from what I‚Äôve found. Maybe you know more than me???

@LisaTalmadge @trtx84 @itsme22 @MsKnittyLee @JaneHWBB @SKOL_Fan_Family @TinaSmithMN @keithellison @SenTinaSmith @RWPUSA But what makes Tina Smith progressive? She takes millions of dollars from PACs, she wont stand up to Trump, she wont sign onto Bernie‚Äôs Medicare For All bill, she is in favor of letting int‚Äôl mining companies destroy our waterways, and she won‚Äôt debate Painter. Sound progressive?
@clborn1234 @skjupnorth2 @RWPMinnesota @TinaSmithMN I‚Äôve never voted for a Republican, and won‚Äôt for the foreseeable future. She should debate him because if Painter is as conservative as you and Tina say, she should be able to easily walk over him on issues that matter to Democrats. He‚Äôs in the primary whether you like it or not.
@jamrockstar @itsme22 @LisaTalmadge If its so easy to be anti-Trump, why is Tina still sitting on the fence on the issue? She‚Äôs too busy playing politics and is scared she will lose the general if she says anything about him. We can‚Äôt let politics get in the way of holding a criminal administration accountable
@LisaTalmadge @trtx84 @itsme22 @jamrockstar @MsKnittyLee @JaneHWBB @SKOL_Fan_Family @TinaSmithMN @keithellison @SenTinaSmith @RWPUSA @GOP @realDonaldTrump He made it clear for the past week that ANY nomination by Trump should be rejected.

@NotnoworlaterSD @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN This tribalist attitude makes me think that people like you want to lose elections. Richard represents progressive Minnesotans better than Sen. Smith ever could. If we don‚Äôt let new people defect from the Russian run GOP, we will never win back the senate or the presidency.

@StarTribune I'm so glad we have a candidate like @RWPUSA, who isn't afraid to stand up to the corruption in Washington and fight for Minnesotans. Richard Painter is one of the few Minnesotans who can truly fill the Wellstone/Franken seat and be a passionate voice for progressive values.
@brycelarson @TinaSmithMN Too bad Sen. Smith refuses to say anything bad about Trump because she thinks its bad politics. If she cared as much about Minnesotans as she does about getting elected, she would oppose any nomination made by the Liar-in-Chief and would be calling for impeachment proceedings
@TinaSmithMN You use "grassroots campaign" as liberally as Trump uses "fake news." You can't call it a that when you're still taking millions of dollars from PAC's and millionaire mining executives. Especially when your opponent is ACTUALLY running a grassroots campaign with no PAC money
@TinaSmithMN @StarTribune Why won't you debate Richard Painter? Are you worried Minnesotans will see you as the corrupt candidate you are? Or that he'll talk about your conflicts of interest? Or your support for international mining companies destroying our environment? Minnesotans deserve a public debate
@MercuryMN Gender doesn't matter if you're focused on the issues. I would proudly vote for Smith the way I proudly voted for Clinton and Klobuchar if she was the better candidate on the issues. Smith has proven that she is too beholden to corporate interests to actually care about us.
@MercuryMN Your bio say's #notMyStadium, which I assume is about US Bank stadium. You should look up Sen. Smith's role in the construction of the stadium and then look up Painter's position on it. He has been strong in opposition of it since it was first suggested.
@MercuryMN You say he's "Obsessed with the deficit" instead of the state of healthcare. Sen. Smith won't support single-payer because she has millions of dollars in Medical device stock that will lose value. She's too conflicted to represent us.
@MercuryMN I disagree with this thread. Although Painter was a Republican, he has continually stood for the same things, but the GOP has moved so far to the right that there isn't a place for him anymore. He is to the left of Smith on many things and would represent DFLers better
@jamrockstar @nytimes @TinaSmithMN He has an interesting story and a national presence. Sen. Smith has been an average establishment Democrat who represents no change from normal politics. Painter is calling for radical change in how Washington operates, while she represents business as usual. #VotePainter

@CharMac50 @RWPUSA @saltycomment @NCRonline Richard is on record as early as 2009 opposing waterboarding or any other torture. He couldn't write on the issue as long as he was in the White House, so his silence shouldn't be misinterpreted. Check out any of his writing if you really think you're right about his past.
@CharMac50 @RWPUSA @saltycomment @NCRonline His view on planned parenthood and all women's health issues is that it isn't his place to say what a woman does with her body. It should be the woman's choice what she does. He won't vote yes on any Trump SCOTUS nominee, unlike Tina who is "hoping" for a consensus nomination.
@CharMac50 @RWPUSA @saltycomment @NCRonline His view on single-payer is that it would be good for EVERYBODY besides the insurance companies, big-pharma, and medical device companies. The same companies Tina owns stock in... Why don't you look at his portfolio, he owns mutual funds, which is what all politicians should own.
@CharMac50 @RWPUSA @saltycomment @NCRonline But which issues are those? Its certainly not the environment, healthcare, or "resisting," which your bio implies matter to you. Do you know that Smith has millions of dollars in medical device company stock, which means that she gets richer as your healthcare prices rise?
@CharMac50 @RWPUSA @saltycomment @NCRonline Where do you get that? He has written pretty extensively about his anger over the Iraq war and enhanced interrogation (which he just calls torture). In fact, he opposes any intervention in the Middle East. You're either blatantly lying or you're being severely misled.
@CharMac50 @RWPUSA @saltycomment @NCRonline Which issue is Smith more progressive than Painter on? Look at their platforms. Richard is better on the environment, healthcare, ethics reform, election reform, banking reform, and holding the Trump admin accountable.
@CharMac50 @RWPUSA @saltycomment @NCRonline I'm a progressive Dem supporting Richard because he's trying to get money out of politics, while Tina benefits from the status-quo. He supports Single-Payer, while Tina benefits from rising prices, He is pro-environment while Tina lets int'l mining companies destroy our waterways

@HHanson56746554 @JuliusAnonymous I don't think I'd classify Klobuchar as a progressive. She's Liberal, for sure, but overall she's pretty much a rank and file establishment Democrat. How do you know she'd vote for a single-payer bill? She has never said anything about it...
@HHanson56746554 @LiesKillTheSoul @suttmus @RWPUSA I mean... She did sneakily attach a rider to the defense spending bill which needed to be passed. That's obviously a common thing to do, but it's one of the swampiest things that happens in DC. Our government would function a lot better if bills were more focused.
@HHanson56746554 @LiesKillTheSoul @suttmus @RWPUSA The difference between Smith and the others you listed is that Smith has millions of dollars in medical device company stock. Our representatives shouldn‚Äôt be making money off the legislation they pass. If she divested, we‚Äôd know that she actually thinks it‚Äôs good for Minnesotans
@HHanson56746554 @LiesKillTheSoul @suttmus @RWPUSA You‚Äôre right, and they are all wrong for supporting it too. Who owns PolyMet? It sure as hell isn‚Äôt Minnesotans.. When they‚Äôre done mining in 5-10 years they will take their money back to Europe and leave us with fewer jobs and polluted waterways. It‚Äôs not a sustainable plan.
@JuliusAnonymous Richard isn't an "Entry-level" applicant. He has been a leading voice for ethics reform in DC for decades. He's uniquely qualified to handle what is going on in Washington these days, and he's ready to make a difference.
@JuliusAnonymous I think you're being mislead, because Tina Smith isn't even close to being a progressive. She won't solidly support Single-payer healthcare, she takes millions of dollars from PACs and special interest groups, and she supports harmful mining in MN by international billionaires.
@HHanson56746554 @LiesKillTheSoul @suttmus @RWPUSA You're sticking with the Democrat who is bought and sold by PACs, international mining companies, and medical device companies?

@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics This argument seems insincere because your favorite Senator, @TinaSmithMN, is the definition of a political opportunist. She won't call for impeachment proceedings until after her reelection in 2020, because its "bad politics..."
@ImKaylaG @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics But because there's so much outside money used in elections, we'll never be able to get anything like that done.

@somuchweirdness Lana, Where is your proof that he said this? I'm sure its just another quote that you're taking completely out of context to make it easier for Tina to avoid debating him and to move the convo from her horrible conflicts of interest.
@HHanson56746554 @FEL1X4U @RWPUSA Smith is an establishment hack who is taking millions of dollars in dark money and PAC donations.

@HHanson56746554 @historywriter He contributed to Rubio because he realized that both candidates in the Democratic primary were strong candidates.

@jackjonesbabe @apothecarymary @SenTinaSmith Painter made sure Alito and Roberts had no financial conflicts of interest, and that was all he did during the nomination process. He had absolutely no say in any policies of the Bush administration and is against any intervention in the Middle East.
@BurnsieMN @zouxou @RWPUSA @SenTinaSmith Universal Health Care and Single Payer are completely different. She won't support single-payer because she has too much money invested in the healthcare industry to want to see the prices fall for Americans. Her position is pretty much "we'll think about doing something..."
@jamrockstar @connor_mulhern Whether the investments are hers or her husbands, she still benefits from an increase in the value. It's not okay for her to be regulating an industry that she has so much money invested in. 		You have to see the problem with that, Jammy...
@jamrockstar He was investigating corruption and fraud within the company. Thats what he does, and its why he's uniquely situated to root out corruption within the gov't. While you complain about that, you're completely ignoring the fact that 34% of Smiths net worth is in conflicted stocks...
@clborn1234 @JuliaZ3X @RWPUSA How can she support a plan like single-payer with so much conflicted stock in the industry? She won't support anything that devalues her stock portfolio...
@clborn1234 @JuliaZ3X @RWPUSA Since getting appointed to her seat she has done little to help Minnesotans except pass a rider that allows PolyMet to destroy Minnesota's waterways and environment.. She won't push for impeachment proceedings, still takes PAC money, and won't stand for Single-payer.
@jamrockstar @JoeBiden @TinaSmithMN She doesn't need donations from us. She's already got dozens of PACs to win her the seat. We need leaders who will refuse to take dark money and donations from PACs. Our representatives are beholden to corporate interests, and cannot truly represent their constituents.
@LibbiestLib @RWPUSA I was wrong, that was only one company, sorry. But it still was a net-positive for Americans. And the repeal leaves us questioning if Smith did it for the jobs or for her own wallet. She should've divested before making any decision related to it. 		https://t.co/a5UukUcNka
@WhitCourtCraft @RWPUSA Did you listen to what he was actually saying though? With a single-payer healthcare system we wouldn‚Äôt need a medical device tax because we could negotiate down prices. Smith wouldn‚Äôt support that either because she has too much money invested in those companies.
@LibbiestLib @RWPUSA The real question is, how much did the repeal of the tax increase the value of Sen. Smith's stock portfolio?
@LibbiestLib @RWPUSA We have to think about what's more important, 10-15 jobs or lower costs of healthcare for all Minnesotans? 		The tax generated more than $5 bil in revenue before it was repealed, which provided income-based subsidies that helped millions get healthcare coverage.
@HHanson56746554 @SenTinaSmith That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs bad for Minnesota. The reason I‚Äôm focusing on Smith‚Äôs support of the bill is that there‚Äôs a candidate running against her who isn‚Äôt afraid to say the mines are bad and Smith attached a rider to a bill that needed to pass, which is swampy.
@LibbiestLib @RWPUSA So helping a big corporation make more money is more important than keeping Minnesotans healthcare costs down? That‚Äôs a bad argument to make, especially because while healthcare costs rise, Smith makes more money. If she would‚Äôve divested, this conversation would be unnecessary.
@Southeast70D @RWPUSA Look at Mark Warner‚Äôs FEC filings. He‚Äôs worth about 240 mil dollars (he was a businessman for decades), but now has his money in broadly diversified stocks, mutual funds, life insurance and other conflict free assets. He is a good example of what all MoC should be obligated to do
@RealBiddle @tedlieu @FBI Lol this is so classic. Have you heard of Donald Trump and his Corrupt Cronies?
@jamrockstar @RWPUSA I feel bad for the people who don‚Äôt see that Sen. Smith is too corrupt to really represent Minnesotans. Painter has the receipts for that (in the form of FEC filings). Why don‚Äôt you look at Smith‚Äôs filings to see if Painter is right. I bet he is...
@jamrockstar @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota You don‚Äôt think that the cost of healthcare isn‚Äôt important to Minnesotans? Maybe you‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs out of touch with Minnesotans.  We want leaders who will represent us, not their stock portfolios.
@jamrockstar @RWPUSA What is deceitful about this? Smith has millions of dollars in Medical Device company stocks and wants to repeal the ACA tax on them, which would make her more money while increasing costs for Americans. If she just divested from conflicted industries, this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.
@krisross82 @RWPUSA Don‚Äôt forget that Minnesotans chose Bernie in the Primary... We actually care about ethics and keeping money out of politics here in Minnesota. We need more Richards and Bernies in DC to save our country from the corruption that‚Äôs taken over our democracy.
@RWPUSA How can anyone think that it‚Äôs okay for our representatives who are supposed to be supposed to be regulating the industry to be so conflicted? Congress needs to pass ethics reform laws NOW to stop the never ending cycle of corruption from further infesting our democracy.
@somuchweirdness It‚Äôs very different than wanting to repeal a key part of the ACA because you have stock in the companies and will make more money if the tax is repealed.
@somuchweirdness If you listen to it with no context they‚Äôre conflicting ideas, but what he is saying is that once we have single-payer we won‚Äôt have a need for the medical device tax that the ACA needed to survive. We‚Äôll be able to negotiate down prices of the devices in a single-payer system.
@TwoThousand_17 @RWPUSA Believe it or not, the GOP was once an ethical party which stood for environmentalist policies. Since then he‚Äôs tried to move the GOP in the right direction, but now those views most closely align with progressive Dems. He talks about it at townhalls that can be found on YouTube
@GaryNorcal @RWPUSA Unfortunately no. That‚Äôs why his ethics reform package is so important! People just assume that our representatives will have some grain of ethical responsibility, but often they‚Äôre too focused on making money to care about ethics.
@TwoThousand_17 @RWPUSA He was never conservative on social issues. In fact he has been outspoken on issues like LGBT marriage and single-payer healthcare. He posted an article a couple hours ago which describes why he changed parties.
@maraleia @RWPUSA Check out his website, it lays out his views in an easy to understand way. He has always supported a woman‚Äôs right to choose and was a strong leader in the movement for LGBT marriage. https://t.co/l4bwnFytec
@RWPUSA It‚Äôs ridiculous that conflicts like this have been allowed for so long! We need ethical leaders in Washington if we ever expect to pass legislation that will help Americans and not just big businesses and billionaires.
@b_b_baconator @RWPUSA He supports single-payer healthcare, environmental regulations, banking reform, LGBT and women‚Äôs health rights, and will vote only for the nomination of Justices who will overturn Citizens United and pledge to protect Rowe v.

@zouxou @SenTinaSmith We need @RWPUSA in the Senate to stand up to Trump's nominees, not give wishy-washy statements like Sen. Smith. 		https://t.co/mLyZbDBBhW
@srsu72 @SenTinaSmith "I am urging the president to put forth a nominee that reflects that bipartisanship, a person who can get strong support on both sides of the aisle,"- Sen. Smith. 		In other words, nothing. Maybe Trump likes Tina enough because she supports harmful mining to listen to her though.
@TAGTeam_Tweets @SenTinaSmith Sen. Smith makes money when American's healthcare costs are high! If we want more affordable healthcare, Tina needs to divest her millions of dollars in medical device stock or be voted out!
@SenTinaSmith How about the Medical Device companies? Oh wait, you'll never say anything bad about them because you own millions of dollars in stock in the industry! You're too conflicted to be regulating the healthcare industry. #VoteOutCorruption
@JomFatima1 @RWPUSA @politico A scam thats already resulted in 19 indictments and 5 guilty pleas? You can't believe everything the liar-in-chief tells you. Mueller is going quicker than other special counsels and is resulting in far more indictments. It's a witch hunt in a country filled with witches..
@skjupnorth2 @RWPUSA @politico @TinaSmithMN It doesn't benefit Minnesotans. But it sure benefits Sen. Smith herself, who gets donations from the PolyMet Executives... She cares more about getting elected than protecting Minnesota's lakes and rivers. #VotePainter
RT @RepAdamSchiff: McConnell held a Supreme Court seat open for a year, insisting no Justice be confirmed in an election year without voter‚Ä¶
@SchMieke @RWPUSA His only role in the nomination was making sure they had no financial conflicts of interest, which they didn't. He had no say in the nomination after that. https://t.co/NiDyv8ISQX
@srsu72 @RWPUSA @theuptake Watch the video that's in the article he just posted. He says Trump shouldn't be allowed to make any more nominations to the Supreme court. He will not approve any of Trumps nominees.
@SenTinaSmith Too bad you didn't think about climate change when you introduced the disastrous Smith Amendment, which is going to pollute Minnesota's waterways and further contribute to climate change. Way to be consistent...
@RWPUSA @theuptake We need your voice in future confirmation hearings, so we have a strong Senator who isn‚Äôt afraid to say ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù While the Trump administration is still acting in a corrupt and criminal manner, we can‚Äôt let him appoint another SCOTUS Justice. #VotePainter
@OyVeyShutItOff @jerseygirlinatx @RWPUSA But it's an election year! We need to let the people have a say in who our next SCOTUS Justice will be! Right? That's what McConnell and Trump argued anyways... Once the midterms are over, it'll pretty much be within the two year limit you set, so we should just wait until 2020!
@RickL1966 @RWPUSA I can't wait to watch Trump get impeached and removed from office.
@NickHannula @RWPUSA It's just hard to ignore how blatantly unethical Sen. Smith is. She may even be one of the least ethical members of congress today....
@NickHannula @RWPUSA I have many reasons to think Richard is ethical, he's not taking donations from PACs or dark-money donors either for one. He has released what would be the strongest ethics package ever introduced in Congress, which seems pretty ethical to me.
@NickHannula @RWPUSA So like Smith is doing by not fighting back against the Trump Administration? She's supporting them by helping them pass destructive mining legislation and she's not actively fighting their existence because she's too worried about getting re-elected in 2020.
@NickHannula @RWPUSA How would we ever make the administration more ethical? As an ethics lawyer, he needs to be in the room to change unethical practices, he can't just yell about it from outside. Richard is the kind of guy who doesn't want to talk about the issues, he wants to SOLVE the issues.
@NickHannula @RWPUSA He made sure they had no financial conflicts of interest, and that was all. Would you rather have two conservative judges who were also beholden to corporate interests? Because without Painter thats likely what we would've gotten. Ethics knows no party.
@Pwneill @RWPUSA Politicizing the court hurts everyone on both sides of the aisle. Judges should be independent of the partisanship that has taken over DC these days. Maybe if the GOP heeded Painter's advice we'd have Justice Merrick Garland on the bench instead of Gorsuch...
@univofmn @TinaSmithMN @AFSCME If she doesn't, she needs to reconsider her role in Senate. She needs to divest from medical device companies and refuse money from PACs and Dark-Money donors. Too bad she'll never do that. We need ethical leadership in DC. #VotePainter
@Katie5963 @RWPUSA @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @LindseyGrahamSC What makes you think that? If he were a Republican he wouldn't be supportive of environmental regulations, medicare-for-all, election reform, and ethical reform, would he? He will vote for bills that help Minnesotans, not billionaire donors.
@RWPUSA We need a Senator that will stand up to Trump the way Franken did, and Wellstone would have. If Smith is too busy playing politics with this issue, we need to VOTE HER OUT! Richard Painter is the only candidate who will stand up for our Democratic values and push for impeachment.
@RWPUSA We know they CANNOT remain in office. They are guilty of many crimes and are responsible for the most corrupt administration in United States history. If your Members of Congress wont Demand impeachment hearings, they need to go too. #Impeach #VotePainter
@RWPUSA We need Democratic Senators like you in DC to lead the effort to push Trump out of office before he can destroy our high court. #Impeach #VotePainter #VoteOutInaction
@TakeActionWAHM @Damita911 @RWPUSA The sad thing is that it's not only right-wingers who care more about corporations and the rich. There are many Democratic Senators who have too much money invested in industries they're trying to regulate to actually help the people. They care too much about their own wallets...
@RWPUSA We need your voice in the Senate confirmation hearings for future nominees and we need ethical leaders like you. Thanks for all you do! #VotePainter #VoteOutInaction
@PaulbatesMN @RWPUSA Zero! He made sure two of them had no financial conflicts of interest, though.
@Pwneill @RWPUSA It‚Äôs more so an argument against politicizing the courts. As he says ‚ÄúSenators should vote their conscience on judicial nominees, but they should vote.‚Äù
@Pwneill @RWPUSA AGAIN, READ THE ARTICLE! He is saying that the GOP shouldn't filibuster Obama's SCOTUS nominations. The Bush nominees were "extremely successful" because they all ended up on the bench! Stop misleading your followers, Phelan.
RT @1PatRogers: @RWPUSA Rather than the traditional "Roberts Court" designation this @SCOTUS will be remembered as: The subverted #MitchMcC‚Ä¶
@RWPUSA @Pwneill You will be an important voice within the Senate during future confirmation hearings. You understand that we need to stop those with Conflicts of Interest from gaining power.
@Pwneill @RWPUSA READ IT! This is an article where Richard say he was a CROOK! Don‚Äôt just post misleading screenshots
@RWPUSA People always try to misrepresent your role, this article seems to clear it up. Thanks for posting! #VotePainter https://t.co/rNNV86kNcX
@Pwneill @RWPUSA This is also blatantly false. He worked as an INDEPENDENT auditor for a different organization. He was legally required to be independent from the organization. Read the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002, which Painter helped craft to learn more about his independent role.
@Pwneill How would he put them on the Supreme Court? He wasn‚Äôt the President or confirming them in the Senate. His only role was to make sure they had no financial conflicts of interest (which they don‚Äôt). Any other ethics lawyer would‚Äôve found the same thing, don‚Äôt misrepresent his role.
@davidgaliel @RWPUSA Well, he has an ethics reform bill that should get bipartisan support, which would make the Trump admin/Members of Congress divest from their conflicted stock options. The only actions Smith has taken is allowing international mining companies pollute our waterways.
@KyloInMN @RWPUSA She is qualified, but she wasn‚Äôt elected, so she shouldn‚Äôt get an incumbency advantage. She isn‚Äôt progressive on issues, she just votes down the Democratic line.
@WhitCourtCraft @RWPUSA He has publicly called for debates and she hasn‚Äôt accepted. There‚Äôs a petition on his website to get her to debate. She‚Äôs too scared to accept.
@Pwneill @RWPUSA His ONLY role in in the nomination of Alito was ensuring he had no financial conflicts of interest. It‚Äôs not like if Painter wasn‚Äôt there Bush would‚Äôve appointed a liberal justice. Read the NYT article you‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs in support of Garland not Alito and Roberts.
@KyloInMN @RWPUSA Sen. Smith was never elected to Senate. When she ran as lieutenant governor, people voted for Dayton, not her. She shouldn‚Äôt get incumbency advantage. We need public debates between the candidates to know where they stand. Do you want a coronation or an election??
@davidgaliel @RWPUSA How can she hold the executive branch accountable on issues like financial conflicts of interest (which the Trump admin are almost all guilty of) when she has millions of dollars in conflicted medical device stocks while tryinh to repeal the ACA medical device tax? #VotePainter
@RWPUSA Tina Smith is playing politics while Trump is destroying our Democracy. She wont even debate Richard to explain why she won‚Äôt push for impeachment proceedings to begin! We need leaders who will stand up for Minnesotans and help all Americans! #VotePainter #VoteOutInaction
@RWPUSA We need you out in Washington protecting our country from Trump too. Once Ellison becomes MNAG we will need more voices like his that will speak truth to power, and you will be one of the strongest voices there!
@AErinalex @RWPUSA @CaptainsLog2O18 But which issues did he which his positions on? He‚Äôs been standing for the same things for decades... and those things are now seen as ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù.
@Studio_Michaud @AErinalex @RWPUSA @CaptainsLog2O18 If that‚Äôs what Republicans support.... Am... I... a Republican? Should I buy a MAGA hat now??? MY LIFE IS A LIE!
@AErinalex @RWPUSA @CaptainsLog2O18 So you‚Äôre okay with politicians that are beholden to corporate interests, wont stand up for single-payer, and have millions of dollars in stocks in industries they are supposed to regulate? Are you sure you‚Äôre not a Republican?
@johnrlick @RWPUSA He‚Äôs been standing for the exact same things for decades. He wants money out of politics, strong environmental regulations, single-payer healthcare, and ethical leadership for Americans. Right now neither party will stand up for those things, but you can bet your ass Richard will
@RWPUSA Smith‚Äôs too scared of talking about her Smith Amendment (which will destroy our waterways), her conflicts of interest (millions of dollars in medical device stocks), and her Billionaire dark money donors to debate. We need leaders who will make decisions Minnesota can be proud of
RT @epmurphymn: When I look at her, I know that Minnesotans will defeat hate with love.		#StandWithMuslims https://t.co/Suz5jBdBsI
@SenTinaSmith How can you hold them accountable when you are an accomplice in their disasterous environmental plans? Minnesotans don‚Äôt want international billionaire mining executives to make more money by polluting our waterways.
@SenTinaSmith It seems ironic that you, the chief architect of the Smith Amendment/ PolyMet land-swap deal are talking about making the EPA do anything. You‚Äôre hardly better than Scott Pruitt when it comes to environmental issues. Maybe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôve taken checks from PolyMet Executives?
@jrupprecht_mn @SenTinaSmith You‚Äôre forgetting that Sen Smith doesn‚Äôt care about poisoning our water. It‚Äôs why she was so eager to introduce and pass the Smith Amendment which gave foreign mining companies the ability to come in and pollute our waterways and destroy Minnesota‚Äôs beautiful environment.
@gem326 He‚Äôs more of a Wellstone/Franken Democrat than Smith is. He‚Äôs outspoken on progressive issues like single-payer, the environment, and protection against predatory banking practices. His only ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù position is his dislike of deficits (which should be a bipartisan issue)
@ResisteMN His job was exclusively to make sure Roberts and Alito didn‚Äôt have any financial conflicts of interest. He didn‚Äôt have any say in the appointment past that.
@crstinso What ‚Äúoutsized role‚Äù did he have? He made sure Alito and Roberts had no financial conflicts of interest. Besides that he had literally no say in whether they got the appointment. He also worked hard to get Garland appointed and is one of the foremost opponents of political judges
@GibbonsMaureen @RWPUSA @Rosie He had Shingles and Ramsay Hunt syndrome which left half his face paralyzed. So. No, not really. I think he‚Äôs in physical therapy to regain movement though. At the DFL convention he said it‚Äôs okay because as long as Trump is in the White House ‚Äúthere is nothing to smile about!‚Äù
@WilliamPeffer @RWPUSA @Rosie *you‚Äôre
@ReaderAdrift @RWPUSA @Rosie Whether it‚Äôs a man or a woman, it‚Äôs corrupt to have millions of dollars of stock in medical device companies while in charge of regulating those companies. She wants to repeal the ACA medical device tax to help her increase the value of her portfolio. We need ethical leaders!
@RWhatfreshhell @RWPUSA @Rosie He‚Äôs never been part of the religious right. He was a very moderate Republican with far left views on some issues. He has never alligned perfectly with either party, but his views align better with the today‚Äôs progressive left.
@LisaTalmadge @PCJADC @MsKnittyLee @RWPMinnesota @marcorubio Lisa, you live in Vermont. If you are so invested in stopping anti-establishment progressives from getting elected, why don‚Äôt you go after Bernie? He‚Äôs in your state. Let us worry about our own election.
@ColorMeBlue2018 @RWPMinnesota @usapromise This is the same kind of fake information that the Russians were spreading about Hillary Clinton in 2016. Almost every one of those is false or misleading.
@johnrlick @RWPUSA The tribalist attitude so many Democrats have shown towards Richard is ridiculous. He‚Äôs further left than Tina on many issues and will actually fight for their implementation. Where does Tina stand on issues like healthcare? We‚Äôll never know because she won‚Äôt speak out about it
@brycetache @RWPUSA Trump‚Äôs tactic of asking for ethics from their leaders? I think you‚Äôre making stuff up...
@t2meg @RWPUSA The Democrats are already divided, one side is okay with their representatives being in the pockets of billionaire businessmen, while owning conflicted stock in medical device companies. The other side is saying that we‚Äôve had enough with special interests and corrupt politicians
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA If she debates, she‚Äôll finally have an opportunity to address her horrible Smith Amendment and maybe she‚Äôll even pledge to get rid of her millions of dollars of conflicted stocks! You can‚Äôt be a ‚Äústrong advocate for women‚Äôs rights‚Äù when you‚Äôre in the pocket of big business..
@BurnsieMN @RWPUSA What actual issues is he Republican on? He‚Äôs more liberal on the environment, healthcare, ethics, bank reform, and electoral reform than Sen. Smith. If she is such a great representative, why doesn‚Äôt she just debate him to probe she‚Äôs the better candidate for Minnesotans?
@NoMoreRhymesNow @RWPUSA If Smith actually cared about the endorsement process she would‚Äôve endorsed Matt Pelican instead of Kieth Ellison. Why should Painter abide by the endorsement of Smith won‚Äôt?
@Rui_Coasta @RWPUSA How can Smith ‚Äúhold the president accountable‚Äù when his financial conflicts of interest get in the way of helping Americans when she also has millions of dollars in conflicted stocks? She needs to divest from medical device companies before she can begin to hold him accountable.
@RWPUSA Senator Smith needs to realize that her constituents aren‚Äôt okay with the corruption of the Trump Administration. We need someone in the senate who will stand up to his criminal behavior and say enough! Richard Painter is the only candidate who will do that! #VoteForPainter
@LibbiestLib @E1i5a @MsKnittyLee @erichc21 @mare_carl Wow, you really give him a lot more credit than he deserves! He didn‚Äôt appoint Alito and Roberts. He just made sure they had no financial conflicts of interest, which they don‚Äôt. After that he had no role in the nomination process.
@LibbiestLib @mare_carl @erichc21 @E1i5a Just because they all supported it, doesn‚Äôt mean its a good deal. Smith gets more blame than them because she a.) introduced the amendment as a rider so she could guarantee it would pass, b.) took money from the PolyMet execs, c.) won‚Äôt publicly explain her decision to support it
@RWPUSA @KarinHousley Not to mention that Sen. Smith and Trump are alike in that they‚Äôre both too conflicted to do their job! She has millions of dollars in stock in those medical device companies that she wants to repeal the tax on! If Housley wants to go after someone anti-Trump,Smith is not the one
@Slicksaban1 @RWPUSA Something like 30 percent. Yes.
@RWPUSA It just goes to prove that Senator Smith can‚Äôt represent Minnesota‚Äôs Democrats because she is too beholden to Republican billionaires who want to destroy our waterways for profit. We need leaders who will refuse to take money from special interests and PACs. #PainterForSenate
@LibbiestLib @erichc21 @mare_carl See, but that‚Äôs part of the problem! She‚Äôs never at the forefront of issues, she just hops on with what the establishment Democrats want. We need someone who‚Äôll step out of line to help Minnesotans like Wellstone and Franken did. She can‚Äôt just sit back and let others do the work
@erichc21 @LisaTalmadge @MsKnittyLee Has Sen. Smith supported any of those bills? She has so much money tied up in the medical industry, that I feel like she will be reluctant to support anything other than the status quo. Painter supports Bernie‚Äôs Single-Payer bill and has made it a top issue in his campaign.
@erichc21 @LisaTalmadge @MsKnittyLee You‚Äôre a healthcare voter, I see. Do you support single-payer?
@erichc21 @LisaTalmadge @MsKnittyLee They don‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs one of the biggest issues. @RWPUSA released this ethics reform package he plans on introducing if he gets elected which addresses that problem. https://t.co/FLr5wzKEug
@LisaTalmadge @erichc21 @MsKnittyLee You‚Äôre from Vermont, Lisa. You have two old, straight, white men in the Senate representing you. Do you choose not to vote for them because of that? Or do you vote for them because they will represent your values? Either way, focus on your state and I‚Äôll focus on mine. Thanks
@erichc21 @LisaTalmadge @MsKnittyLee Im not a Republican, just a Progressive who thinks that Sen. Smith can‚Äôt represent us while taking money from PACs. Getting money out of politics is my top issue, because I think it‚Äôs the only way to begin to end the cycle of corruption in DC.
@LisaTalmadge @erichc21 @MsKnittyLee I proudly voted for Klobuchar in 12 and Hillary in 16. I‚Äôll be voting for Klobuchar again in Nov, because she‚Äôs a fantastic representative for Minnesotans. But gender doesn‚Äôt matter when you have so many conflicts of interest you can‚Äôt separate personal gain from constituent gain
@erichc21 @mare_carl The internment camps are inhumane and un-American. We need to impeach Trump and get rid of his entire administration, which Smith won‚Äôt agree to. She wants to wait until 2020 to see what happens. How many kids will be locked up in the next 2.5 years? Painter wants to impeach NOW.
@erichc21 @MsKnittyLee @RWPUSA I‚Äôm not a one issue voter. The PolyMet deal may be the most egregious sign of her inability to represent Minnesotans, but it is far from her only fault. Right now, we‚Äôre at a crossroads in this country. We need to take the path that will lead to better governance for the people.
@erichc21 @MsKnittyLee @RWPUSA She will do anything the Democratic establishment in DC wants her to, but won‚Äôt do what her constituents want. We need leaders who will fight for ethics in DC, and she has shown that she is not going to do that.
@erichc21 @MsKnittyLee @RWPUSA She wont publicly support single-payer (it‚Äôd probably hurt the value of her stock portfolio). She helped broker the Vikings stadium deal, which cost Minnesotans millions of dollars.
@erichc21 @MsKnittyLee She won‚Äôt stand up to Trump the way her opponent @RWPUSA does/will do in the Senate, and how could she? One of Trump‚Äôs biggest issues is his conflicts of interest, and Sen. Smith has almost as many! It would look hypocritical to go after him for it.
@erichc21 @MsKnittyLee She‚Äôs accepting millions of dollars in PAC money, and has received donations from the PolyMet execs that she is letting kill our environment (quid-pro-quo??)
@erichc21 @MsKnittyLee The land-swap was just one of the many things Tina has done that proves to me she can‚Äôt be an effective Senator for Minnesotans.
@erichc21 @MsKnittyLee She has millions of dollars in medical device stocks, and she‚Äôs advocating for the repeal of the ACA‚Äôs medical device stock tax, which will help her make more money, while making us pay more for treatments.
RT @RWPUSA: A political party in bed with the Russians is talking about turning Minnesota Red! 	No thanks. https://t.co/4tjuyR38k9
@TinaSmithMN If you were actually trying to stop him, you‚Äôd be in Duluth protesting with us. Instead you‚Äôll be in DC, probably introducing another bill to kill our environment. You do not represent Minnesotans. You barely even represent Democrats. We need leaders who will fight for us!

@clborn1234 @troysride @katierogers @kate_hawkins776 Richard is more liberal than most of ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù in Congress (especially the MN delegation).

@bjgarife10 @TuckerCarlson FYI, his face is partially paralyzed, which is why he can be hard to understand. Just listen closely to what he says and you‚Äôll see that if he were in the Senate, our country would be better off.
@RWPUSA @RWPUSA Is the perfect leader to stand up to the corruption in DC! Ethics is more important now than ever! #VoteForPainter
@HHanson56746554 @RWPUSA This is such a cynical argument. Even if the Dems stay in the minority, wouldn't you rather have a Sen who'll TRY to pass bills that help Minnesotans than one who'll sit back and let others tell her which way to vote? No single Sen can change laws, but they can start the process.
@LisaTalmadge @PCJADC @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Maybe she does care about the environment, but she obviously cares more about winning her election, so she had to introduce legislation that will help the PolyMet executives who donated to her campaign.
@LisaTalmadge @PCJADC @RWPMinnesota It‚Äôs novel that a Smith supporter would say @RWPUSA is anti-environment on the night that the Smith Amendment, which every environmental group in MN opposes, passed. Painter is trying to stop int‚Äôl mining companies from polluting our waterways while Tina is trying to help them...
@LisaTalmadge @PCJADC @RWPMinnesota Read the book he Co-authored about labor unions, called ‚ÄúEmployment Rights.‚Äù It shows that Painter knows and supports the value unions play in our society.
@LisaTalmadge @PCJADC @RWPMinnesota He was apart of an independent audit committee that reviewed financial statements, management practices and detected fraud in the DDF. He had no other role in the org., which he was legally obligated to stay independent from. This was his job. Do you always agree with your boss?
@LisaTalmadge @PCJADC @RWPMinnesota You can‚Äôt expect a Senator with millions of dollars of stock in medical device companies to support a bill that will hurt those companies. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs pushing for the repeal of the ACA medical device tax. She cares about her bank account more than her constituents.
@LisaTalmadge @PCJADC @RWPMinnesota While Smith tows the party line, Painter is arguing for changes that establishment Dems dislike, but will help Minnesotans. He has publicly supported Bernie‚Äôs single-payer bill. Smith says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre looking into it,‚Äù meaning she‚Äôll ask her portfolio manager if she‚Äôll lose money.
@LisaTalmadge @PCJADC @RWPMinnesota Your tribalism and refusal to accept people with different views than you tells me that you don‚Äôt actually want Democrats to win elections. We need to be a party where people who support our core values feel welcomed. If we have one litmus test for all Democrats, we‚Äôll never win.
@anthonyhesse @RWPUSA He had shingles and Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, which caused half of his face to become paralyzed.
@ImGraceBowers @RWPUSA If Tina cared about the DFL endorsement, she would‚Äôve endorsed Matt Pelican instead of Kieth Ellison. She doesn‚Äôt care about the Democratic Party, only her own candidacy and her big donors.
@RWPUSA @RWPUSA is the ONLY senate candidate who will stand up to the international mining companies who want to pollute our waterways! We need representatives who will fight for us, not the billionaire mine owners. The Smith Amendment is bad for Minnesotans, and our beautiful state!
@Jason_HFX @RWPUSA Painter‚Äôs campaign‚Äôs based on helping Minnesotans by creating a single-payer healthcare system, stopping international billionaires from polluting our waterways, standing up to corruption, getting money out of politics, and yes, making sure Trump doesn‚Äôt do anymore damage.
@Lane4Finn @DonnaHudSmall @RWPUSA It only takes a couple senators to get an investigation going. And after thirty years of investigating and exposing white-collar criminals, he‚Äôd be a strong advocate against corruption and crime in our government. Give him a shot, he‚Äôs got a better chance than what we have now...
@DonnaHudSmall @RWPUSA Painter is stronger on environmental issues than Sen. Smith. He is in favor of single-payer healthcare. He is anti-money in politics. He‚Äôll be tougher on the corruption of Trump administration, and he‚Äôll make sure foreign oligarchs have NO say in our domestic policies.
@RWPUSA Richard will stand up to the Trump administrations horrible and destructive policies. We need leaders like him in Washington who aren‚Äôt afraid of the political machine.
@VictoriaCollaz2 @RWPUSA Trump‚Äôs just coming to stroke his ego. When Painter gets elected, it‚Äôll be obvious to him that Minnesotans will NOT stand for his criminal behavior and corruption
@anthonyhesse @RWPUSA Tell your 29 followers that once he‚Äôs elected, Richard is going to bring down the corrupt Trump administration!
@RWPUSA The only candidate in this Senate race that will work to help Minnesotans is @RWPUSA! Don‚Äôt let Smith lie to you and say she can tans up to Trump, when she‚Äôs just as conflicted as him and his cronies! We need ethics in DC!

@FireFanMVP @RealSaavedra He had shingles and Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, which left half his face paralyzed. That's why he's sometimes hard to understand, but it doesn't change the fact that his message is resonating with Democrats around Minnesota. We need ethical leaders like Richard in Washington!
@PattiJ75669486 @RWPMinnesota He supports more than just universal healthcare. He supports Bernie's single-payer bill. Sen Smith, on the other hand, has millions of dollars in medical device companies stock, which would lose value if we moved to single-payer. She's too conflicted to actually help Minnesotans!
@the_first_TH @RWPMinnesota It's only ever the anti-Bernie, establishment Democrats who try to say Painter isn't a Democrat. He is not only a Democrat, he is far more progressive than Sen. Smith has ever been. We need ethical, progressive leaders like him in DC.
@jamrockstar @DenieB78 @TinaSmithMN The "actual" Democrat who is pro-mining by int'l billionaires, against single-payer, is beholden to PACs and big donors, and refuses to divest her millions of dollars of stock in medical device companies which she is in charge of regulating? Sounds more like a Republican to me...
@bdhumble @RWPMinnesota A Democrat with your respect. ‚úä
@BurnsieMN @slim_skinner @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA The dumpster represents Sen. Smith's stock portfolio when Richard wins the election. Single-payer may hurt Tina's wallet, but it'll help all Americans get affordable healthcare. We need people in Congress who don't have conflicts of interest!
@BurnsieMN @sees_simon @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Progressives and ethical Democrats in Minnesota support Richard! He's the only Senate candidate who will truly work for us in DC.
@BurnsieMN @AmyW36 @sees_simon @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA I'd love to have two strong female Democratic senators, but if one of them is going to be beholden to medical corporations and international mining companies instead of Minnesotans, then I dont think gender matters. We need someone who will fight for Minnesotans, not billionaires
@AmyW36 @BurnsieMN @sees_simon @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA This is why we need to have debates! Minnesotans deserve to hear the differences between Sen. Smith and Prof. Painter on the issues that matter most to us.
@BurnsieMN @AmyW36 @sees_simon @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Painter argued in favor of approving Merrick Garland's nomination. The courts should be non-partisan. 		https://t.co/UvuliQaoI8
@BurnsieMN @RationalMindss @skynetesq @RWPMinnesota Look at the PACs that have donated to Sen. Smith. Lots of healthcare companies... It's almost like they want her to win so they can make more money! They must realize that she'll work to increase the value of her stock in medical device companies. 		https://t.co/uocBpue07K
@BurnsieMN @skynetesq @RWPMinnesota If Smith is a "real" Democrat, why won't she support single-payer? Why is she supporting international billionaire's mines over our waterways? And why does she have millions of dollars worth of medical device stock? Conflicts of interest are bad no matter which side they are on..
@jackjonesbabe @RWPMinnesota This article was also written in support of approving Merrick Garland.. You can read it here and see the context behind this screenshot. 		https://t.co/UvuliQaoI8
@LisaTalmadge @jackjonesbabe @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA @RWPUSA Supports Bernie Sander's single-payer bill. He's not tricking anyone, he wants to bring Minnesotans healthcare costs down. Tina, on the other hand, is trying to increase the value of her millions of dollars of stock in medical device companies and help her donors.
@LisaTalmadge @jackjonesbabe @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Sen. Smith is absolutely NOT a progressive. She wont even agree to single-payer. Probably because she owns millions of dollars of stock in medical device companies that would lose value if we adopted a single-payer policy. That‚Äôs not very progressive.....

@jackjonesbabe @RWPMinnesota I don‚Äôt know why that paragraph proves me wrong? He says ‚ÄúI helped... with the nomination...‚Äù which he did. His role was ensuring they had no financial conflicts of interest. Which they don‚Äôt. Sen. Smith on the other hand... Watch one of his town halls, he explains his role.
@jackjonesbabe @RWPMinnesota His only role was to ensure the judges had no financial conflicts of interest. Maybe if Sen. Smith had Painter helping her with financial conflicts of interest, she wouldn't have millions of dollars in medical device stock as she tries to repeal the ACA medical device taxes!
@MmeMehitabel @MsKnittyLee @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump So you don't want to talk about the issues? Now you're really sounding like Tina Smith!
@MmeMehitabel @RWPUSA This is the kind of tribalistic attitude that makes me wonder if the Democratic Party likes losing elections. We should be excited that there are two extremely viable candidates running for the nomination. It gets voters excited and will help us defeat Housley in the general!
@MmeMehitabel @MsKnittyLee @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump And don't forget that Bernie won the primary in MN. His ideas resonate with Minnesotans who want to know that our representatives will go to Washington to fight for causes that help us, not their donors and stock portfolios.
@MmeMehitabel @MsKnittyLee @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump Many of the establishment Dems are fine (see Klobuchar), but a lot of them are as corrupt as the Republicans. If you hold millions of dollars in stock in an industry you're supposed to be regulating, that's a problem! If we want a gov't that works for us, they have to divest.
@MsKnittyLee @MmeMehitabel @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump You should check out one of the videos of his town halls where he discusses his long-held belief in a single-payer healthcare. He makes the logical point that it's good for everyone but the big donors from the medical industry, which is why most establishment Dems wont support it
@MsKnittyLee @MmeMehitabel @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump As the chief ethics counsel, it was his job to ensure the SCOTUS nominees were without financial conflicts of interest, which they were. After that vetting was complete, he played no role in the nomination process. You'd know that if you watched any videos of his town halls...
@MsKnittyLee @MmeMehitabel @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump The entire point of an audit committee in a foundation or corporation is to be INDEPENDENT of management. Similar standards are set in the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 which Richard was involved in crafting. There is no conflict there and he has nothing to do with their ideals.
@MsKnittyLee @MmeMehitabel @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump The audit committee for DDSF, which Richard serves on, is BY LAW independent of management and works with outside auditors to review financial statements, accounting practices, detect or prevent fraud and other illegality, and review management practices.
@MsKnittyLee @MmeMehitabel @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump He was in the private sector when he was payed, so he isn‚Äôt conflicted. If he keeps working for them after he‚Äôs elected, that would be an issue. Look at Sen. Smith, who is STILL making millions from the stock she holds in medical device companies she‚Äôs supposed to be regulating!
@MommaTL @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump So someone is a misogynist simply because they critize Betsy Devos or Sen. Smith for their millions of dollars of conflicted stock? If they‚Äôre corrupt, they‚Äôre corrupt, no matter the gender. We need ethics in the Senate!
@mare_carl @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs because Sen. Smith is just as corrupt as a lot of the Trump appointees. She has millions of dollars in medical device stocks while urging the repeal of the ACA medical device tax... We need ethical leadership!
@MsKnittyLee @jlblueskies @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump Very few endorsed DFL candidates have actually won a primary in Minnesota. Look at the Gubernatorial races, the DFL endorses candidate hasn‚Äôt won in over 45 years. Painter is stronger on issues that matter to Minnesotans, and he‚Äôs not conflicted like Sen. Smith!
@MsKnittyLee @MmeMehitabel @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump Betsy Devos has a lot of conflicts of interest, but Tina Smith can‚Äôt possibly go after her for it because she‚Äôs just as conflicted with her millions of dollars of medical device stocks while she‚Äôs urging repeal of ACA medical device taxes. Ethics?
@MmeMehitabel @RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump Painter doesn‚Äôt have conflicts of interest because he isn‚Äôt in the Senate yet, Sen. Smith is. But she refuses to divest from the medical device companies she has millions of dollars of stock in, while she‚Äôs urging the repeal of the ACA medical device  tax.
@RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump We need ethical leaders like you in Washington!
RT @PreetBharara: So Trump can unilaterally pardon anyone, absolutely pardon himself, impose his will on DOJ, ban all Muslims, levy any tar‚Ä¶
@HHanson56746554 @thecoasterlead @petebushey01 @daniel_gorm65 @KarinHousley @SenTinaSmith @RWPUSA Both of them support harmful mining, neither of them publicly stand up against the crimes of the Trump administration, neither support single-payer, neither of them  will push for election reform, etc..... Trump and the Republicans would much rather have Smith than Painter.
@covfefe_party @RWPUSA Since his inauguration, Trumps approval is down 18 points in Minnesota. Minnesotans see his corruption and incompetence and are not happy! Not to mention the fact his isolationist tariffs will hurt Minnesota farmers trying to export their crops....
@JoycejohnsonR @RWPUSA Smith is busy promoting Trump's agenda too! The only candidate in Minnesota who will stand up to Trump's high crimes and corruption is Richard Painter. We need him in DC!
@HelloSunshineDi @KarinHousley @RWPUSA He's the only candidate in the race that Trump won't be happy to see win! Neither Housley or Smith will stand for single-payer healthcare, the environment or pushing Trump out of office. Painter is better for Minnesota than anyone else in this race.
@univofmn @RWPUSA Neither Smith nor Housley will stand up to the corruption and crimes of the Trump administration either... We need Painter in the Senate!
@thecoasterlead @petebushey01 @daniel_gorm65 @KarinHousley @SenTinaSmith Tina Smith and Housley are too similar on the issues that matter to Minnesotans. The only candidate who will stand up to big corporations, international mining companies, and the Trump administration is @RWPUSA, which is why I am voting for him on August 14 and you should too!
@DaphneDoGood1 @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Check out his policy stances over the last 20 years, he's more of a Democrat than most of the Democratic establishment politicians in DC today. He will fight for single-payer, science, and ethics unlike many other Dems who have too many donors that will lose when Americans win...
@RWPUSA When politicians take an oath of office they take it to the public, not their portfolio managers!
@BradleysCoins @RWPUSA Painter has talked extensively about his policy ideas (single-payer healthcare, election reform, ethics reform, environmental regulation, etc...) just check out his website or watch some of his town halls on youtube. He has said far more about his platform than his opponent...
@SenTinaSmith @SenFeinstein It's nice to finally see you address this issue. It's horrible what is happening to these immigrant children. Next I'd like to see you finally explain why you introduced the Smith Amendment. Is it because the PolyMet executives that donated to your campaign asked you to? #Corrupt https://t.co/RpjXrkAPVd
@SheriJo @TinaSmithMN @amyklobuchar If only one of them would stand up to PolyMet instead of taking donations from their executives. The Smith Amendment is horrible for the people of Minnesota! At least we have a choice in August to vote for @RWPUSA, who will fight for people, not the corporations harming our state
@ethomasw @ColorMeBlue2018 @RWPUSA @YouTube Seven words: Bush had no financial conflicts of interest. (What Painter did at the WH)
@TinaSmithMN Why won't you talk to your constituents about your horrible Smith Amendment? We need to hear your explanation. (Assuming its not just that your billionaire donors from PolyMet asked you to do it)
@kik_nyc @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN Her explanation (even though she'd never say it publicly) is that she receives huge donations from the CEO and other executives of PolyMet, so she'll do their bidding instead of what is best for Minnesotans. We need ethical leaders who'll listen to people, not corporate interests https://t.co/4TdAupaX7x
@MarkWKelly @RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN Yeah, because he wouldn't need a phone call to know that this is a horrible amendment that is bad for Minnesotans and our beautiful state.
@tonyalfidi @RWPUSA The point of the land swap is to allow for sulfide mining to be done on what is now federal land without complying with environmental regulations for federal land. This mine would pollute our waterways and harm the future of eco-tourism in Northern MN.
@HHanson56746554 @skynetesq @trtx84 @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage You're right, I can link you to where it would be if he did receive compensation from the heritage foundation. Look it up on this website for Senate financial disclosures. While you're at it, check out Tina Smith's disclosure and see how conflicted she is. https://t.co/lT5fEzM8Mq
@angry_ande @sciencemilkcow @TinaSmithMN This is wrong. If sulfide ore/tailings are exposed to water and air during mining, a chemical reaction creates sulfuric acid ‚Äì basically battery acid. There has never been a sulfide mine that has not polluted nearby water resources. Many MN waterways will be polluted by this mine
@Jesus4Refugees @RWPUSA https://t.co/LHSK0NEUr5 See Painter calling out Paulsen for corruption here.
@skynetesq @trtx84 @HHanson56746554 @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage But his stances haven‚Äôt changed in the last two decades. He‚Äôs been an advocate for single-payer, getting money out of politics, the environment, and so many more progressive issues. If we have a litmus test for anyone wanting to join the party, we‚Äôll never take back the Senate.
@trtx84 @HHanson56746554 @skynetesq @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage Andy, Yes. What substantive issues do you disagree with Painter on? What makes Sen. Smith a better candidate in your mind? I don't get you steadfast opposition to a progressive who actually wants to work for Minnesotan values..
@trtx84 @HHanson56746554 @skynetesq @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage I assume you supported Obama, yes? Did you support every one of his policies? Just because you support someone doesn't mean you agree with every one of their stances. Painter has always been vocal in his support of both Obergefell v Hodges and Roe v Wade.
@trtx84 @HHanson56746554 @skynetesq @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage His job was exclusively to ensure Roberts and Alito didn't have any financial conflicts of interest. And he clearly did a good job with that because they don't have any! Once he ensured they weren't conflicted, he had NO role in the nomination process.
@skynetesq @HHanson56746554 @trtx84 @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage The entire point of an audit committee in a foundation or corporation is to be INDEPENDENT of management, meaning he had NOTHING to do with the mission of the organization. 2/2
@skynetesq @HHanson56746554 @trtx84 @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage This isn't evidence of Painter taking money from the Heritage Foundation! He worked as an independent auditor for a DIFFERENT organization to review financial statements, accounting practices, detect or prevent fraud and other illegality, and review management practices. 1/2
@FeathersHonking @TinaSmithMN @HHSGov It's not even about profits for businesses! To Sen. Smith, it's about her own personal wealth. More than 45 percent of her net worth is tied up in medical device stock, which means as healthcare prices rise, Tina makes more money! This is unacceptable. Minnesotans deserve better.
@HHanson56746554 @skynetesq @trtx84 @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage Lauren made the claim, so she should provide the evidence (which doesn't exist). Otherwise it's a baseless claim reminiscent of a Trump accusation.
@angry_ande @sciencemilkcow @TinaSmithMN There will be if Tina gets what she wants, or maybe I should say if Tina gets what her billionaire donors want... Her disastrous land-swap is going to pollute the boundary waters and make it unusable for future generations of Minnesotans.
@skynetesq @trtx84 @RWPUSA @RWPMinnesota @Heritage Are you just going to say this without any sort of proof to corroborate it? Show me the FEC filings. He hasn't taken a dollar from Heritage Foundation. On the other hand Tina is taking money from mining execs who are using their influence to hurt Minnesotans.
"I think the 'folks' thing really killed Obama in the end"
@Jesus4Refugees @RWPUSA That is precisely why we need @RWPUSA in the Senate! He has already released a bill that he plans on introducing, which would require the President and Members of Congress to divest before taking office. If this law had been in place 2 years ago, Trump would be forced to comply.
@RWPUSA @CNNPolitics We need @RWPUSA to bring ethical leadership back to Congress! The corruption that is so prevalent in DC must stop NOW! The Trumps may be the worst, but they're far from the only corrupt people in Washington...
@Kevindogluver @RWPUSA @POTUS I don't know if you're being disingenuous or just obtuse, but Painter had shingles and Ramsay Hunt syndrome which caused half his face to become paralyzed. It is really offensive that you'd even try to use that against him.
@Kevindogluver @RWPUSA @POTUS Where‚Äôs the lie in the fact that Sen Smith owns millions of dollars in medical device stocks, an industry she is suppose to help regulate? Look at her FEC filings. She is one of the most conflicted Senators in DC.
@thebabs780 @PatThomas45 @EricaJong @RWPUSA Until we can get it overturned, we need to elect people like @RWPUSA who will refuse money from big donors and PACS. If we show it‚Äôs possible to be elected without relying on corporations and billionaires, more politicians will start to refuse their money.
@Jesus4Refugees @RWPUSA Sen. Smith NEEDS to divest from the medical device companies she owns millions of dollars in. Conflicts of interest are bad no matter which side of the aisle they are on. If we want Trump to divest from his companies, we must demand Dem lawmakers are held to the same standard.
@BollPorsche @RWPUSA Only a fool would vote for a senator with as many conflicts of interest as Tina Smith. Almost half of her wealth is tied up in Medical device stock, and she recently voted to repeal a tax on those companies. Where is the ethical leadership we need?
@mare_carl @wscottkainscott @RWPUSA @YouTube It's awful that establishment Democrats don't see this clear sign of corruption. Tina Smith needs to explain her decision to support this horrible land-swap deal. It's bad for Minnesotans everywhere. We need a debate to show Minnesotans where Tina really stands on the issues. https://t.co/514OGdiCAv
@ColorMeBlue2018 @RWPUSA @YouTube @RWPUSA is far more in line with Minnesota Democrats than Sen. Smith is... He is supportive of single-payer (she's not). he is pro-environment (she's not). He believes in getting money out of politics (she doesn't). And he will fight to get Trump out of office (she won't).
@Vote4Sanity2018 @RWPUSA @YouTube I guess we have different views of what corruption is. Is it corrupt when a Senator takes money from executives and then does what they want her to do even though it's bad for her constituents? Because that seems pretty corrupt to me... https://t.co/kFIoIvLqQX
@HeyFactsMatter @RWPUSA @YouTube "Facts Matter" is misleading viewers. Do facts really matter to them? @RWPUSA, as Chief Ethics Czar, went through Alito and Roberts' financial disclosures to ensure they didn't have any financial conflicts of interest. Once he did that he had ZERO influence on the appointments
@sejlb @RWPUSA Richard is WAY past smelling the smoke! He has been trying to put out the fire since election day. If he were elected to the Senate, maybe he'd be able to show other Members of Congress, who are just watching it burn down, how to use a fire extinguisher!
@RWPUSA This is NOT okay. While Trump abuses his power, establishment politicians are sitting idly by doing nothing. We need leaders like @RWPUSA in Washington to make sure Trump doesn't get away with his crimes!
@cnylvr @RWPUSA That is why we need to send candidates like @RWPUSA to congress to ensure the corrupt Trump administration doesn't get away with their crimes!
@RWPUSA Lets hope he's related to Leonard Cohen because he'll be singing "Hallelujah" all the way to prison!
@RWPUSA @MailOnline Thank you, @RWPUSA, for standing up for Minnesotans while our representatives in DC are letting international billionaires pollute our waterways. I can't wait to vote for you on August 14th and again in November!
@RWPUSA Former GOP gov. Arne Carlson opposes this mine, but Sen. Smith, a "Democrat," approves of it. Go figure‚Ä¶.
@RWPUSA One thing the article doesn‚Äôt note is that in addition to owning more than one third of PolyMet's stock, Glencore also owns a lot of PolyMet‚Äôs debt and has preferential rights to the copper and nickel that comes out of the ground, as pointed out in Painters previous tweets.
@Ygilamnstr @RWPUSA How many Republicans do you know that would stand up to the Russian Oligarchs who will own this mine?
@RWPUSA @RWPUSA Is the ONLY candidate for Senate who will stand up to protect Minnesotan's waterways from dangerous sulfide mining. He stands with the majority of Minnesotans and ALL environmental groups. We need strong leaders like Painter who aren't afraid to say NO to billionaires!
@rhettcbuckley @BillBradbury6 @RWPUSA @politico This is exactly why we need someone like @RWPUSA in DC. He will work to get money out of politics and make the government work for YOU rather than for deep-pocketed donors.
@BillBradbury6 @RWPUSA @politico If you look at his history you'd see that while at Harvard, Painter was a vocal opponent of Reagan and even helped lead ‚ÄúHarvard Students for Walter Mondale‚Äù in 84. On his first national TV appearance he called out Reagan‚Äôs reckless deficit spending and cuts to social programs.
@BillBradbury6 @RWPUSA @politico While Painter was serving as it's vice-chairman, CREW filed a lawsuit against Trump for violation of the emoluments clause! For the last forty years, Presidents on both sides of the aisle have respected this standard. Painter is demanding that Trump does too. We need ETHICS!
@BillBradbury6 @RWPUSA @politico This is why we need @RWPUSA in the Senate, so both sides will be held to the same standard! ANY financial conflicts of interest by public officials are bad for the American people!
@BillBradbury6 @RWPUSA @politico But Senators in both parties hold millions of dollars in medical device stock, creating conflicts of interest that keep them from passing new healthcare laws that will help the American people. Corruption is wrong no matter which side you're on!
@BillBradbury6 @RWPUSA @politico Why don't you answer @RWPUSA's tweet? Which candidate had to sell a farm? Why don't they apply the same standards to stockholders?
@HHanson56746554 @LJBreedlove @DianaMcBlue @LisaTalmadge @RWPUSA @jillkoreyo @LouisNap54 @the_scrivener He was the ethics czar for the White House, meaning he was only in charge of ensuring neither Alito or Roberts had financial conflicts of interest. After that was done, he had ZERO power to influence Bush‚Äôs decision to appoint them or not.
@BillBradbury6 @RWPUSA @politico Ninety percent of Painters tweets attack corrupt Republicans, yet Democratic party hacks whine over the other 10 percent calling out corrupt Dems around the country. Corruption is bad no matter which side is responsible for it! We need ethical leadership in Washington!
@RWPUSA @politico Painter is going to be as honest in the Democratic party as he was in the GOP. Thats what we need in Washington, someone who is not afraid to stand up to the corruption that is so rampant in our government.
@LJBreedlove @DianaMcBlue @LisaTalmadge @RWPUSA @jillkoreyo @LouisNap54 @the_scrivener But what part of his platform is too conservative for you? The things he is running on are long held beliefs, that haven‚Äôt changed over the decades. There‚Äôs a paper trail on almost all of his stances dating back years.
@extapdancer @TheSteveTheCat @HoarseWisperer @RWPUSA @KarinHousley This is widely recognized as a crucial step for the sulfide mining to proceed, which is why all of the environmental groups are strongly opposed to it. To say that the land swap is not enabling sulfide mining is a downright lie.
@extapdancer @TheSteveTheCat @HoarseWisperer @RWPUSA @KarinHousley @HoarseWisperer‚Äôs tweet is misleading. The entire point of the land swap is to allow for sulfide mining to be done on what is now federal land without complying with environmental regulations for federal land.
@kim_kwalsh16 @HoarseWisperer @RWPUSA @KarinHousley @HoarseWisperer is being untruthful. The point of the land swap is to allow for sulfide mining to be done on federal land without complying with environmental regulations for federal land. It is clearly meant to help the internationally owned mining companies and not Minnesotans.
@HoarseWisperer @craigaroo @RWPUSA But establishment, anti-Bernie Democrats like @HoarseWisperer probably don‚Äôt like that. 3/3
@HoarseWisperer @craigaroo @RWPUSA He has proven through the organizations he‚Äôs apart of, lawsuits he‚Äôs been involved in, and books/articles he‚Äôs written that he is not going to sit idly by as the country is going in the wrong direction. 2/3
@HoarseWisperer @craigaroo @RWPUSA has already released a bill he plans on introducing if elected, which would be the strongest ethics reform package in American history. 1/3
@craigaroo @HoarseWisperer I know you‚Äôre not from Minnesota, but this seat was occupied by Paul Wellstone, who was an beloved progressive champion, before Franken. It‚Äôs a seat that needs to be filled by someone who can live up to the legacy of Wellstone. @RWPUSA is the only Dem in the race that can do that
@HoarseWisperer @craigaroo What part of his platform is too conservative for you? You should watch one of his town halls, he explains why all of your tweets about him are incorrect. He is more progressive than most Democrats in Congress. https://t.co/lZgQbz7Ju5
@HoarseWisperer @craigaroo If you stand for nothing, what does it matter? He could take the path of Sen. Smith and ignore all of the important issues, or he could do what he is doing and stand up for sweeping change that will help Americans around the country. Why vote for someone who won‚Äôt try?
@HoarseWisperer @jsdkl Universal healthcare and single-payer are NOT the same thing. Single-payer would be better for the people of the US, but establishment politicians are too scared to upset their big donors and PACs to support it. @RWPUSA cares about helping Americans, so he is vocally in support.
@HoarseWisperer @christabognet If you vote for @RWPUSA, you‚Äôre voting for someone who has held the same beliefs for decades and doesn‚Äôt swing to fit into a broken two party system. He has always been pro single-payer, pro-environment and anti-money in politics, which is more than you can say for most Dems.
@GabeTheCentrist @LisaTalmadge @RWPMinnesota @GOP @NRA @marcorubio @RWPUSA @HillaryClinton I only used Clinton as an example because @LisaTalmadge‚Äôs bio specifically says that Hillary was always with the LGBT community. When we look at public statements, Painter has been pro same-sex marriage longer.
@LisaTalmadge @RWPMinnesota @GOP @NRA @marcorubio @RWPUSA @HillaryClinton While she was waiting for it to be politically expedient for her to be come out as pro same-sex marriage, @RWPUSA was already testifying in front of MN legislature in support.
@LisaTalmadge @RWPMinnesota @GOP @NRA @marcorubio @RWPUSA @HillaryClinton If she was so on board with pro-LGBT+ rights, why did it take her until 2013 to publicly support same-sex marriage? Even in the 2008 election she was publicly against it!
@LisaTalmadge @RWPMinnesota @GOP @NRA @marcorubio @RWPUSA @HillaryClinton In 2014 he filed an amicus brief with the US Supreme Court urging them to declare same sex marriage legal in all fifty states. But still he‚Äôs part of the ‚Äúwar on gays‚Äù? That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me..
@LisaTalmadge @RWPMinnesota @GOP @NRA @marcorubio @RWPUSA Publicly supported same-sex marriage before @HillaryClinton did! In 2011 he helped organize GOP opposition to anti-LGBT legislation in MN and he testified against MN‚Äôs horrible ‚ÄúDefense of Marriage Act‚Äù in front of the MN legislature in 2013.
@HoarseWisperer This is clearly a critical step for the sulfide mining to proceed, which is why ALL MN environmental groups strongly oppose the deal. It is a lie to say that the land swap won‚Äôt enable sulfide mining.
@HoarseWisperer This shows that you are ignorant of the facts. The reason international mining companies want the land swap is so that sulfide mining can be done on federal land without complying with the federal environmental regulations for federal land.
@NoYouMoveUSA @HoarseWisperer Even if those ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù only stand by what their corporate donors want? What‚Äôs the point of parties if neither one represents their constituents? @RWPUSA is the only DFL Senate candidate who will fight for single-payer, will stand up to corruption, and protect the environment.
@aubreysund @HoarseWisperer If you live in MN you should understand that @HoarseWisperer is wrong. The entire point of the land swap is to allow for sulfide mining to be done on what is now federal land without complying with environmental regulations for federal land.
I‚Äôm not sure why @HoarseWisperer is so pro-mining! It‚Äôs seems like they don‚Äôt mind if Minnesota‚Äôs waterways are polluted for future generations! @RWPUSA is the ONLY senate candidate who will protect Minnesota from international mining companies who don‚Äôt care about Minnesotans! https://t.co/BFHZaN6o1V
@ReaderAdrift @HoarseWisperer The reason to replace Smith with @RWPUSA is that he will actually represent Minnesotans, while Tina represents the medical device companies that she holds 15 million dollars of stock in.
@HoarseWisperer @HariSeldon2100 Sen. Smith is hardly the Dem candidate, but to an establishment, anti-Bernie ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù like @HoarseWisperer, it might seem that way.
@HoarseWisperer @RWPUSA @KarinHousley @HoarseWisperer Is a rabid anti-Bernie institutional democrat clearly in the pocket of the mining industry. Corporate tools like this make democrats lose!
@TedCornwell @RWPUSA @KarinHousley On the environment it‚Äôs sometimes  hard to distinguish Smith from Housley, but Housley is probably worse. Our drinking water will become even nastier if Housley is elected.
@RWPUSA @KarinHousley @RWPUSA is the ONLY candidate who will fight for clean water for Minnesotans! The Smith amendment is garbage.
@TedCornwell @RWPUSA @KarinHousley Housley is probably buddies with Trump AND Scott Pruitt!
@pretzelgreg @RWPUSA @KarinHousley This isn‚Äôt about democrats, it‚Äôs about clean water. None of us will vote for Senator Smith if she continues to support sulfide mining.
@Bestestgrammie @RWPUSA @KarinHousley The wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing is the ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù who thinks her party label is a license to destroy our waterways with sulfide mining. She also voted to repeal ACA medical device tax while holding 15 million dollars in medical device stock. Ethics??
@HoarseWisperer @norwegian76 @RWPUSA @KarinHousley This is widely recognized as a crucial step for the sulfide mining to proceed, which is why all of the environmental groups are strongly opposed to it. To say that the land swap is not enablabling sulfide mining is a downright lie.
@HoarseWisperer @norwegian76 @RWPUSA @KarinHousley The entire point of the land swap is to allow for sulfide mining to be done on what is now federal land without complying with environmental regulations for federal land.
@VodkaBeerPootin @RWPUSA @KarinHousley Painter is a Democrat candidate, Housley is his GOP opponent, Smith is his opponent in the DFL primary. GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!
@LisaTalmadge @DianaMcBlue @LJBreedlove @RWPUSA @jillkoreyo @LouisNap54 @the_scrivener If you look at what he's doing for the foundation, you'll see he worked for an independent auditing committee that must BY LAW be independent of management, meaning he was working as an ethical supervisor to make sure they were compliant with federal and state statutes.
@HHanson56746554 @RWPUSA @USATODAY Once they were nominated, Richard helped ensure neither nominee had financial conflicts of interest. After making sure they were clear of conflicts, he had no role in the confirmation. Saying he "helped" put them on the court is disingenuous and a misrepresentation of his role.
@skynetesq @LisaTalmadge @MsKnittyLee @trtx84 @RWPUSA Richard has always said that the government should have no interference in a woman's right to chose. He is absolutely 100 % pro women's rights and pro abortion rights. I don't know where you got the idea he wasn't.
@HHanson56746554 @EnhancedFiber @RWPUSA You‚Äôre assuming the Democrats can‚Äôt take back the Senate. And even if they don‚Äôt, the dems will still have another pro-environment vote, instead of having a second iteration of the horrible Smith Amendment.
@SherrylCee @AhmedWa34283843 @RWPUSA If that makes him a Republican, count me in!
@SherrylCee @AhmedWa34283843 @RWPUSA What part of his platform makes him a moderate republican? He is pro single-payer, anti-mining, pro-environment, pro election reform, and is one of the loudest voices standing up against the authoritarian tendencies of the Trump administration.
@PattiJ75669486 @RWPUSA Neither the GOP or Sen. Smith will stand up to the mining industry. The only person truly fighting for Minnesotans is @RWPUSA, which is why we need to vote him into office!
@EnhancedFiber @RWPUSA He has used his voice and platform to stand up to the mining industry, but until he gets elected to the Senate, his words are the best way he can fight for us Minnesotans. While Tina is in agreement with Trump on mining in Minnesota, Richard realizes it's bad for us. #VotePainter
@FionaPaws @RWPUSA Richard's policies align with the DFL far more than the GOP. He has stood strongly for single-payer healthcare, has been one of the loudest voices against money in politics, and is pro-environment/anti-mining. He is far more progressive than Tina and will represent MN well.
@clborn1234 @ImGraceBowers @RWPMinnesota I‚Äôve been on twitter since February, and I consider myself pretty progressive (which is why I‚Äôm supporting @RWPUSA)
@ImGraceBowers @RWPMinnesota Why should I vote for someone a bunch of establishment DFL insiders want instead of someone who actually stands for something? Tina has shown little to no interest in helping her constituents. She only cares about the big donors who contribute to her campaign.
@tsbrewers @ericmferguson @nada_lemming @jrupprecht_mn What did Ellison do to be called disgusting?
@jamrockstar @RWPMinnesota Why is it a characature if he believes what he says and it happens to be aligned with what people want to hear? He wouldn‚Äôt be running if Tina would stand up against corruption, would say no to the big mines that are polluting our water, and actually worked towards single-payer
@politicsluo @ActorAaronBooth That‚Äôs not really true. His only GOPesque stance is being in favor of a balanced budget. The progressives love him because he is truly a champion for their values. Tina toes the party line trying not to ruffle any feathers. But, if they have a debate like @RWPUSA wants we‚Äôll see!
@trtx84 @Jlo_Too @jamrockstar @SenTinaSmith @RWPUSA @RWPUSA had to push Tina to the left on issues like single payer (which she finally got behind tonight). She also jumped on his ‚Äúanti dark money‚Äù band wagon, which is funny because she is still accepting millions of dollars in donations from PACs and corporate donors.
@trtx84 @Jlo_Too @jamrockstar @SenTinaSmith 74 percent of delegates isn‚Äôt an accomplishment for Tina. She should‚Äôve easily won with 80-90 percent of the vote, but @RWPUSA took her to task. He has consistently stood for progressive values (ie. Anti-money in politics, pro-environment, pro single-payer)
@SD57DFL I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd believe that. Nothing he has said or done shows that he is still a Republican. His stances haven‚Äôt changed over the past 30 years, but the GOP has moved away from his ideology. He has always been anti-money in politics, pro environment, and pro single-payer
@MsKnittyLee @LCVoters You forgot to mention that Smith got that endorsement in April, before @RWPUSA announced his candidacy. Since announcing, he has gained support from environmental groups around the state, because he is willing to stand up to the big mining corporations that Tina is beholden to.
@cartman333 @ComfortablySmug @kylegriffin1 Do the math. Trump has been in office 492 days. He has played golf 115 of those days. That‚Äôs 23 percent of the days he‚Äôs been in office that he has played golf. 23&gt;3
@Mikanojo @davidhogg111 To be fair, most of the people in his district support the NRA. Would you rather have a Repub who is supported by the NRA take his seat in the House? We‚Äôll never win back the House if we keep pushing out electable candidates because of single issues. It‚Äôs a sad fact if politics
@delana1970 @davidhogg111 @scrimshankpotus He has no primary challengers because no other Dem could win his district. After Peterson retires, it‚Äôll be safely in GOP control for years.
@TimMcClellan @davidhogg111 Lol, Trump spelled his own wife‚Äôs name wrong. It‚Äôs funny that you let all of Trump‚Äôs grammatical mistakes slide but you attack an 18 y/o for missing 1 word in a tweet. Go look at Trump‚Äôs twitter archive. I bet he‚Äôs made more mistakes in the last year than in all of David‚Äôs tweets
@RobertHoward69 @momtotranskids @davidhogg111 The gun-loving Dem will vote to save/expand the ACA, increase taxes on the extremely wealthy, protect the environment, promote public education, etc... If gun-violence was the only issue in America, I‚Äôd say vote his ass out, but we need him to help pass everything else we support
@purrfection2015 @davidhogg111 From my knowledge of his tenure, he would support common sense gun-reform, like stricter background checks but wouldn‚Äôt support a complete ban of any type of gun. It would be political suicide for him. The GOP would win his seat and hold it for decades if he was vocally anti-gun
@IndNYorker @davidhogg111 You‚Äôd rather have an even more pro-gun, pro-corporation, pro-choice, pro-trump Republican in the House? Collin Peterson is the only Dem candidate running, and if he retired the district wouldn‚Äôt leave GOP control for decades. Good luck winning the House back that way...
@Happy81928573 @georgefayner @davidhogg111 You‚Äôre obviously not from MN. Someone running in MN‚Äôs 8th without the support of ‚Äúgun rights‚Äù advocates could never win. Dave Hughes, who is running against Peterson, would be far worse for the state and the county. If we use the same litmus test for every Dem, we‚Äôll never win
@CarolBlymire @yashar @maggieNYT If you read the article, you‚Äôll see that they discuss how likely the individual is to run, and how they would do if they ran. We have no idea who is electable or not. 3 years out from the 2016 election, Trump wasn‚Äôt electable in anyone‚Äôs mind but his own.
@drw1018 @yashar Yeah, a freshman senator who just got into politics could never get elected. *checks notes* oh, wait....
@jamrockstar @trtx84 @TruthInLight68 @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN I want to say, no matter how hard I fight for Painter during the primary, I will 100 percent vote for Sen. Smith in the general if she wins the nomination. I don‚Äôt think she is some boogey-man, she represents MN well. The issues I care about most, Painter is stronger on.
@jamrockstar @ScamperDPenguin @TruthInLight68 @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN If Sen. Smith agreed to debate Prof. Painter, it would be easy to decrease the money needed to send mailers, print lit, etc... We could see them actually talking about the issues, instead of reading talking points. Maybe I‚Äôd even change my mind and support Sen. Smith!
@jamrockstar @ScamperDPenguin @TruthInLight68 @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN I don‚Äôt think ANYONE is saying that ALL money needs to be removed from politics. But if we were all playing by the rules of small donations without corporate influence (ie. PACs), and went with Bernie style of small grass-roots donations, a lot of the problems would be fixed
@jamrockstar @trtx84 @TruthInLight68 @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN When did he say that? (Serious question, I must‚Äôve missed it)
@jamrockstar @TruthInLight68 @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN And now she is pushing to get rid of regulations in The ACA that have helped lower prices of medical devices. Which will help the value of her stock grow. That‚Äôs simple, right? Why doesn‚Äôt she sell her stock? 2/2
@jamrockstar @TruthInLight68 @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN So Sen. Smith holds stock in Medtronic (along with other companies) 1/2 https://t.co/8EF2caLz4f
@jamrockstar @TruthInLight68 @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN He wasn‚Äôt tweeting about the American Revolution, he was tweeting about the rampant corruption that is ruining the democracy we fought to create. This is quite possibly the biggest problem facing America today. Oh AND he supports net neutrality, veterans, and small business too!
@jamrockstar @TruthInLight68 @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN Want to address the issues instead of pointing to my gender to say I‚Äôm wrong? Sexism is powerful, but it doesnt meant that every man is wrong. You said Sen. Smith wasn‚Äôt beholden to corps but she is. I wanted to correct the record. What policy of Smith‚Äôs is better than Painter‚Äôs?
@TruthInLight68 @jamrockstar @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN from PACS, or corporations. He is trying to get rid of the corruption among politicians in Washington and strongly stands for progressive values. 2/2
@TruthInLight68 @jamrockstar @nwg83 @TinaSmithMN They‚Äôre competing for the same seat, and the person you‚Äôre replying to is incorrect. Sen. Smith is beholden go corporate interests. She holds stock in Medtronic, and has voted to help them rather than lower the costs of healthcare for Americans. Painter isn‚Äôt taking money... 1/2
@ScamperDPenguin @Elisabethmngirl @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA You‚Äôre absolutely right. It‚Äôs easier just to block me and end the conversation there. https://t.co/FQ4oHbVNZa
@Elisabethmngirl @ScamperDPenguin @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Were you seriously a mayor? Laughing at someone trying to have a conversation instead of actually talking about the issues? Give me one reason (besides his prior affiliation to the GOP) that Smith is better for the seat than Painter.
@Elisabethmngirl @ScamperDPenguin @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA I want to leave this conversation but I really wish you‚Äôd actually address the points I raised instead of just calling me a bot. That‚Äôs the attitude that makes people run from the Democratic Party. If we want to fix the hostile political environment we need to talk to one another
@ScamperDPenguin @Elisabethmngirl @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA She still won‚Äôt address any of the policy question... I think she knows we‚Äôre right, but will never admit it. You should volunteer for the painter campaign. We need people who are willing to push back against the nay-sayers.
@Elisabethmngirl @ScamperDPenguin @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Lol, still not a Bot, but okay. (If I were a bot, my programmers deserve a raise, because I‚Äôm answering all your tweets directly and with more depth than any of your comments)
@Elisabethmngirl @ScamperDPenguin @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA AND TRUMP WAS A THIRTY YEAR DEMOCRAT! We‚Äôre in a different place than we were five, ten, or fifteen years ago. Painter has ALWAYS stood up for progressive values, even as a moderate republican.
@Elisabethmngirl @ScamperDPenguin @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA (I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll let us down though)
@Elisabethmngirl @ScamperDPenguin @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA I live in MN AND want him to sit in a Dem seat. I will vote for him in the primary. I think if anyone can fill Franken‚Äôs spot as a logical, strong voice for the people of Minnesota, it‚Äôs him. And if he lets me down, the seat will be up for grabs in 2020 and we can vote him out
@Elisabethmngirl @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA What are his republican policies? I see someone who is pro environment (he‚Äôs against mining, which is super unpopular here in MN), supports single payer healthcare, stands against money in politics, is strong on ethics, and points out the rampant corruption in the trump admin
@ScamperDPenguin @Elisabethmngirl @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA Exactly, when you try to point to the issues, they just go back to the old ‚Äúhe worked in the Bush administration‚Äù line. As Painter has pointed out MANY times ETHICS AREN‚ÄôT POLITICAL. As the ethics counsel he was probably butting heads with the administration more than most others
@Elisabethmngirl @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA No? I‚Äôm a Vikings fan through think and thin (even when we lose 38-7) But anyways, why is Painter a bad candidate compared to Smith, who is beholden to her donors and hides from a challenge?
@Elisabethmngirl @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA I‚Äôm not a bot, and even if I was, the points that I raised are completely valid. Why don‚Äôt you address them? Also send me a captcha code to prove I‚Äôm a real person.
@Elisabethmngirl @SteelersVII @RWPMinnesota @RWPUSA If Tina Smith is so effective why doesn‚Äôt she agree to debate Professor Painter? If she is so progressive, why does she hold stock in the medical device companies that have made healthcare costs sky-rocket? Franken didn‚Äôt endorse anyone yet, and I doubt he would choose Smith.

@MsMaxwell6 @FullFrontalSamB @AGSchneiderman If it had happened today, dems would‚Äôve turned our backs on Bill in a heartbeat. The culture around sexual assault and power dynamics has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Look at Al Franken, he just grabbed a butt and he was forced out. The GOP doesn‚Äôt care unless it‚Äôs a Dem.
@SusanLFleming2 @mviser Serious question, why are we arresting Obama?
@ForecasterEnten Do you have any insight into polling in Minnesota‚Äôs 8th congressional district? It seems like a really close race, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find polling data. It voted for Trump in ‚Äò16, but the dem held the seat. Any information would be appreciated
@stcrone @RWPUSA If you read the article you‚Äôll see that even one of the CEOs of a med tech company said thats not happening. Because the market is so competitive they dont pass any of it to the buyers. It comes out of their huge profit margins. Smith is pro corporation because they donate to her
@KennethHeer @RWPUSA @Nancabell @Tex_Aldridge @MSNBC @TinaSmithMN To be fair, Sen. Smith could get onto MSNBC whenever she wants. News orgs never turn down requests from Senators. But she hides from the press and isn‚Äôt vocal about any of the major issues. At least with Painter we‚Äôd have a senator who will vocally stand up for Minnesotans.
@herenowhere3 @BlueWaveNov @queerBengali @barbprindle What makes you think he‚Äôs for small government? He supports Obamacare more than Sen. Smith, who wants to get rid of a key piece of the law which taxes medical device companies to keep the prices low. https://t.co/G1ZtGESd5c
@herenowhere3 @BlueWaveNov @queerBengali @barbprindle Which of painters ‚Äúrepublican‚Äù policies do you support? Allowing big mining companies to pollute Minnesotas water with few regulations? Oh wait, that‚Äôs Senator Smith doing that.
@herenowhere3 @BlueWaveNov @queerBengali @barbprindle First, you‚Äôre wrong and everyone who is involved with elections will call it Franken‚Äôs seat. Women and men alike. Secondly, Painter hasn‚Äôt ignored any of the accusations, he just said that they should‚Äôve gone through the ethics investigation. He‚Äôs a lawyer, he values the process
@herenowhere3 @BlueWaveNov @queerBengali @barbprindle The reason I‚Äôd vote for Painter over Smith (both are great) is that Painter, like Franken, is great at pointing out hypocrisy and poor logic of Republicans and Democrats alike. Although Franken resigned in disgrace, theres no disputing he was the best interrogator in the senate.
@herenowhere3 @BlueWaveNov @queerBengali @barbprindle Painter calls it Franken‚Äôs seat because that‚Äôs the correct way to refer to it. It is a special election for Franken‚Äôs seat. The same way it was a special election for Jeff Sessions seat in Alabama even though Luther strange was filling it. 1/2
@MEBier1 @richfield65 @JackPosobiec @Gays4ChickFilA Well, their sorely mistake there. Healthcare is more expensive here than almost other countries.
@midiguitar11 @JackPosobiec Yeah, and the 200 extra votes from the refugees will make huge headway for the DNC. Great point, AV8R.
@JackPosobiec Maybe because Mexico isn‚Äôt safe for them either? We manage to keep the cartel‚Äôs of Honduras out of the US, while it is very easy for them to get into Mexico, where the refugees would be their first target. Next question.
@thebradfordfile @JackPosobiec Clearly this is a bug in Facebook. You can google it and see that it‚Äôs not supposed to show up. Also according to twitters hate speech policy, trump has violated it multiple times, but they won‚Äôt block him because he is public figure. So I guess it won‚Äôt happen under trump either
@MyaSchuwerk @gezd @jeanjoel @lamour The administrations policies clearly effect people of color more negatively than whites people, but the jokes Wolf told had nothing to do with those policies. The constant lies effect ALL Americans equally, so race doesn‚Äôt have much to do with this discussion. I bet Wendy agrees.
@KCobb8876 @cultofpolitics @FoxNews @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The ACLU isn‚Äôt affiliated with either party. They represent any group that they feel have had their civil liberties infringed upon. But Liberals back more civil liberties than conservatives. Why did Trump listen to them this time and not when they objected to the travel ban?
@LauraR77 Adam Lanza, who attacked Sandy Hook elementary school was an NRA member.
@dbongino @johncardillo @Twitter @TwitterSupport That would be the best weekend of my life. I wouldn‚Äôt have to see wild conspiracy theories and crazy MAGA tweets. How about you try it this weekend and if it works out well, you just stick with it forever?
@PatriotMarie @zuwena81 @TrumpetsCall @KevinPaulson18 @yashar @Cernovich @Oprah That wasn‚Äôt some secret treasonous deal, it was literally the US repaying the Iranians the money that they had spent on military equipment before we implemented sanctions. If the US didn‚Äôt pay them back we would likely be in a much worse spot in regard to Iran.
@Chicken_Loverl @NBCNews Stay in school so you can get a job that will pay you enough to buy a nice car when you‚Äôre older! Washington has pretty good public transit, make use of that or find a job that is walking/biking distance! If you drop out you‚Äôll regret it for the rest of your life.
@mcnm6886 @Dori_Kenneally @Stareagle @PressSec @POTUS I mean, he didn‚Äôt implement the sanctions against Russia, so I guess it depends on what your idea of ‚Äústanding up to the rest of the world‚Äù is. To me it kind of seems like he‚Äôs sitting down and letting Putin get away with his normal bullying.
@miranda_rooney @NurseNicoletta @realDonaldTrump Probably obstruction of justice. Maybe treason, if the shoe fits. But we‚Äôll have to wait and see! https://t.co/TxalKAd9AO
@hilariously_ @pauligirll @willripleyCNN Kim Jung Un has been threatening the US since he took power, and before him his father threatened to destroy us. Trump certainly hasn‚Äôt made anything better by retaliating with the same bluster as the Kims, it‚Äôs dangerous. But so is a nuclear North Korea.
@hilariously_ @pauligirll @willripleyCNN And if they were looking for world peace they would stop their nuclear program, they‚Äôd stop threatening to destroy the United States, and they‚Äôd allow the UN investigators into their country.Meeting with your president is a step in the right direction, but it‚Äôs not the first time
@hilariously_ @pauligirll @willripleyCNN They won‚Äôt attack the South or America. I agree with that. But they‚Äôre starving their people. They send millions of their citizens to work camps, torturing and depriving them of basic human rights. We can‚Äôt overlook these atrocities for the sake of appeasing a bully.
RT @PreetBharara: #ReleaseTheMemo
@pauligirll @hilariously_ @willripleyCNN He only stood for the US athletes. Its not like he specifically decided to sit for Korea. And meeting with defectors is a good way to remind people that while the Kims are trying to save face right now, they‚Äôre brutal totalitarian dictators and they will continue to kill millions
