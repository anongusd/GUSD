.@TomBuisGE says the goal is to make the #RFS THE issue for candidates at the #IowaCaucus over the next year.
Buis: @SenDonnelly introduced legislation that would expand the market for biofuels by increasing RVP wavier for #ethanol blends above 10%.
.@TomBuisGE - If we open up the #RFS - we’ll go backwards. #ethanol
.@TomBuisGE No one would have ever bet #Ethanol would become 10% of the Nation’s fuel supply this quick. #Ethanol forum
.@TomBuisGE is talking @IN_Corn #Ethanol Forum:  “We can do more - but we have to step up to the plate”.
