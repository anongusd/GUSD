@thinwhiteduke0 I ran and won last election promising to protect our 2A rights, and voted the way I promised our constituents.
@CMaxwellOstdiek I‚Äôve long supported tax incentives that have led to increases in wind, solar and geothermal use... this has bipartisan support unlike the New Green Deal that is extremism.
@elmax21 I‚Äôve long supported and made reality tax incentives that led to growth in wind, solar and geothermal use. Omaha is on track for 40% energy from wind for example. This has bipartisan support, unlike the $90T+ Green New Deal.
@jenndreibel I‚Äôve been one of the leads that continued tax incentives and growth in wind, solar and geothermal use. Thanks.

Our military readiness levels when I came to Congress in 2017 were the worst since 1977. That is unacceptable, but I am encouraged by the last two defense bills. We are digging ourselves out of this hole, but it will not happen overnight.
As a nation, we just passed over $22 trillion in debt. We don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. We cannot ignore this any longer.
Prescription drug pricing is an issue with bipartisan support to fix. We must fix this now and lower costs.
One of the most critical issues we must address is health care. We need to lower costs, protect those with pre-existing conditions, and target taxpayer money to go where it can be most effective.
We need to secure our border. Border security is national security.
I voted on two bills last summer that would have funded a targeted wall, and address a plan forward for DACA. There has to be some give and take from both sides to advance on this issue for our country.
The statements from the VA Governor about abortion were terrible. We are 1 of 7 countries in the world that allow abortions past 20 weeks. I am a cosponsor of the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to change this.
We need more Holocaust education to combat anti-semitism, and I am committed to furthering Holocaust education in our country.
Anti-Semitism is increasing. We have to be honest about it, that it comes from the right and left. This is unacceptable and repugnant and there is no tolerance for it.
Of all the issues we work with in Congress, veterans issues have the most bipartisan support.
A shutdown is a sign of a non-functioning government. We have to do better.

Divided government requires compromise &amp; our country requires it. But yet, Democratic Party leadership has their heels dug in. It's time for the leaders of both parties to come together, shut the door &amp; hammer out a win-win deal that breaks this gridlock. https://t.co/WMV3BU2S0S
@vince_powers ...and to negotiate in good faith. Compromise takes both sides, and Pelosi said ‚Äúnot a single dollar‚Äù before and after shutdown, and promised the same if govt is reopened. This gridlock is about her zero compromise.

@ZevRohloff @justinkemerling We support additional vehicle screen devices. Our CBP requests a physical barrier in key portions of our border. And... much less than what Schumer requested just a few years ago.
@justinkemerling You mean the one that Schumer supported but three times larger than Trump‚Äôs request?
@RollanSchott The filibuster was always the hindrance and not having an agreement that would secure 60 votes. But, I would agree that we should have had this debate sooner and found agreement.

@leene50 Our Border Patrol says they need key sections of border with steel barrier... I‚Äôll support their request.
I‚Äôll double down on negotiating in good faith and a willingness to compromise, and Schumer and Pelosi have refused to do so thus far. I‚Äôll also double down on border security and rule of law. https://t.co/IjwE9xmBuy
@yodaears2000 @AnneScheer @Sheeps62 Not case, I believe we negotiate in good faith, both sides meet in the middle, and we‚Äôd open up government within a day. Schumer and Pelosi have refused to budge one dollar while govt was open or closed, while Trump offered to lower his request by half.
@schmackelstan @AnneScheer @Sheeps62 He offered to meet in middle and take half of his request... so your statement is not accurate.
@p_check After talking to our Border Patrol and CBP, I think we need key sections of border to have steel barrier integrated with their personnel and key sensors. I support the Border Patrol‚Äôs requirement. Border security is national security.
"Walls actually work. I promise you that if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work," - Brandon Judd, Border Patrol Council President. I support the request of 234 miles of physical barriers needed in targeted places. https://t.co/GS6rPOikjE
@niceguym @Sheeps62 It‚Äôs about border security and enforcing rule of law.
@AnneScheer @Sheeps62 When the govt was open Schumer and Pelosi refused to negotiate and said ‚Äúnot a single dollar.‚Äù Whether opened it closed they‚Äôve refused to meet in middle.
@personalk When the govt was open Schumer and Pelosi refused to negotiate and said, ‚Äúnot a single dollar.‚Äù Whether govt has been opened or closed, they‚Äôve refused to compromise.
@PaulJones95 He offered to cut his request in half... was responded with ‚Äúnot a single dollar.‚Äù
@Sheeps62 I‚Äôll forward your gracious note to Pelosi and Schumer‚Äîthanks! We‚Äôve been ready to negotiate and meet in middle. Pelosi and Schumer have said ‚Äúnot a single dollar‚Äù before and after shutdown, though they‚Äôve supported a longer wall in the past.
@NoClu2You That‚Äôs according to Schumer... I heard Trump on TV agree to comprehensive deal that had wall and DACA, and Pelosi said no. That was a mistake by her.
@MikeVmos If both sides are willing to compromise weld have govt open in heartbeat. But... only President has offered to compromise.
@Enactivist After he was told if he agreed to reopen govt that Pelosi and Schumer we‚Äôre still ‚Äúnot a single dollar.‚Äù
@bpbeatty Encouraging both sides to meet in middle... one side has done so, one hasn‚Äôt.
@bpbeatty That‚Äôs why we need Pelosi and Schumer at table now looking for a compromise. They could settle this in 15 mins.
@PastorKaos Partisanship &amp; immigration are top 2  issues now. Schumer &amp; Pelosi need to negotiate &amp; meet somewhere in middle. I campaigned on targeted barrier along out border where Border Patrol says it‚Äôs needed. Despite a +9 point national blue wave we won because folks know where I stand.
@tonyajade It‚Äôs not the case. Our Senators opposed... it was not a recorded vote.
@Blackford_Law Many folks in district want a targeted steel barrier along key portions of border. Overwhelming response in favor I heard with hundreds of phone calls. Border Patrol says a barrier is effective in key locations and I think they‚Äôre right.
@RoxieAn72001048 I agree with you. This one shouldn‚Äôt be hard.
Pelosi &amp; Schumer refused compromise when govt was open &amp; now when closed. ‚ÄúNot a single dollar‚Äù position triggered shutdown though both supported longer walls in past. To open govt we must negotiate. POTUS offered to split difference, but Pelosi and Schumer stuck on zero.
I agree. Schumer supported just a few years ago a wall three times longer than what POTUS is requesting... he and Pelosi should come to table and meet somewhere in the middle. Govt would open real fast! https://t.co/yaxfmnC7GY
@bpbeatty I did three times. Thanks.

Our Border Patrol wants a wall in critical areas of our border &amp; I support their requirement. Schumer‚Äôs stand is zero compromise and results in gridlock.

The Afghans have some great special forces, but the Taliban won‚Äôt be going anywhere until we can at least stop them from using Pakistan as a sanctuary
To remedy this I‚Äôve been supporting the Stop School Violence Act and legislation that (w/ due process) stop those with at risk behavior from purchasing firearms https://t.co/N4Vb2UYBM4
Concerning gun violence in school, I‚Äôve been deployed and had 30 rockets come into our camp at once. What these kids have had to deal with is worse.
What I hear the most from #NE02 is that we want a balanced immigration approach, where we don‚Äôt deport folks like DACA but also increase our border security to halt illegal immigration
We are blessed that our #NE02 VA clinic is among the highest rated in the nation. But others in the nation aren‚Äôt so great, and so leaders need to be held accountable and enabled to hold their staff accountable
Our older vets usually prefer the ‚Äúbrick and mortar‚Äù VA institutions, while younger vets more often like to choose their provider. I believe vets should have the choice to do either
I believe that we should respect and protect the rights of law abiding citizens to bear arms, and hold those who don‚Äôt accountable, especially those who place guns into the hands of criminals. https://t.co/fNmp9Xkjzb
I believe mental health needs to be treated just like any other health issue. We need to get away from the stigma surrounding it
We often talk about having record low unemployment, but in the Midwest we‚Äôve had a 50% drop in crop prices and an increase in individual insurance prices. We need to work on solutions for this
We also need to get rid of ‚Äúevergreening‚Äù that drives up prescription drug costs
Other countries negotiate prescription drug costs with us that leave the research and development cost to be paid for by Americans. This is a trade issue we need to fix
We are a divided country and have been because of the two party system for a long time, which is good because it impedes one party from passing too many laws. However, we need to discuss our differences civilly
5% of people to ever live on Earth have known freedom like we know. We need to teach our young folks this, how blessed they are to live in America and the sacrifices made to make and keep it this way
Tariffs are the last resort, but China has not been allowing fair free trade. We need a level playing field for our farmers and workers
Nobody can beat the American farmer or rancher at production. We need to make sure they can compete on a level playing field.
We‚Äôre facing a shortage of skilled workers!
We also need to help high school students understand that 4 year degrees aren‚Äôt the end all be all. We need to value trade and technical school education https://t.co/l6zBxp4ldp
We need to allow college students to renegotiate interest rates, but also encourage students to choose affordable education over name brand schools if they‚Äôll lead to the same path
We lost over 60,000 people to the opioid crisis last year. So we put $4billion into prevention and rehabilitation, as well as law enforcement against fentanyl.
I believe we need to let Mueller finish his investigation. I don‚Äôt think we will see collusion between the President and Russia, but we need to see what Russia has been doing to interfere in our elections.
We have 12 million unemployed that are able to work. We‚Äôve got to get them the skills they need to get them to work, getting rid of the cliff effect.

@MarrWilliams I‚Äôve always supported prexeisting conditions coverage. I‚Äôve tried to fix our broken healthcare.
@MarrWilliams Everyone is suppose to get a background investigation, and foreign nationals should have done before they entered program. The Army failed here leaving a big vulnerability in program. Now, Army is catching up and doing investigations on all those they missed.
@MarrWilliams You‚Äôll have to ask DoD that because they investigated this program and said the Army‚Äôs failures resulted in a security risk. We‚Äôre fixing what the investigation said is broke.
This weekend‚Äôs news from #NorthKorea reinforces the need to keep full diplomatic and economic pressures on North Korea until Kim Jong-un delivers actual results on denuclearization. North Korea has a long history of talk and no action.  Keep full pressure on.
@MarrWilliams I think the far majority understand that having foreign agents in our Army is bad... I‚Äôm glad to take this on at anytime... election year has absolutely zero bearing on doing what is right.
@MarrWilliams That‚Äôs why we are fixing it... the program goes back over five years and due to noncompliance by the Army we know have a terrible security risk.

@FerozMohmand @redcloud_scribe @NebraskaMegan @ListenBrian @FBIWFO @FBIOmaha Thank you. The problem here was that some of the background checks were not done until after entering the program which resulted in the problems seen here. The Army should have done the background checks prior to folks starting the program.
@JoshIstas @curlsNE @OWHnews The timing is always right to enforce the rules designed to keep foreign agents and individuals with a criminal past from joining our Army. Defending America is one of our foremost duties in Congress and I won‚Äôt shy away from it.
@FerozMohmand @redcloud_scribe @NebraskaMegan @ListenBrian From all over, but I had to pass a background check to serve. We must enforce precautions to keep out foreign agents and those with a criminal past from joining our Army.
@curlsNE @JoshIstas @OWHnews Not according to the Army testimony to the House and DoD investigation. Many were not vetted prior, and procedures were not followed. The Army is now vetting after the fact and hence why some are being removed. Some could not pass the background investigation.

Year after year, Nebraska is ranked number one in the nation for beef and cattle exports and production making our state a great asset to our international partners. In fact, the state‚Äôs beef and pork products were the largest exports to South Korea in 2016.
After implementation of the KORUS Agreement, Nebraska‚Äôs agricultural exports to South Korea increased by 52 percent.
Our nation‚Äôs partnership with South Korea through the #KORUS Agreement has allowed Nebraska‚Äôs agriculture economy to thrive. The enhancements made to the trade agreement better our relationship with South Korea and encourage the expansion of America‚Äôs trade economy.

We should also keep in mind that this Administration also made the decision to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, something the Obama Administration refused to do.
These targeted actions bring the total Russia and Ukraine related sanctions to date imposed by this Admin. to 100- including 9 Russians targeted for malign activities related to the North Korea sanctions program and 7 related to the Global Magnitsky program and Magnitsky Act.
I believe the assertion that this Administration is soft on Russia is a false narrative. In 2017 alone, the Administration imposed 58 targeted sanctions related to Russia and Ukraine.  Just last month, Treasury sanctioned 42 additional individuals and entities.
More, more, and more benefiting from tax reform... and more, more and more to come. https://t.co/7SVM7kBWjG

"As a member of Ag Committee, we need to work on expanded trade which is vital to Nebraska's ag economy- every 2 rows of soy beans exported, every 3 rows of corn exported." #BaconTeleTownHall
"We need to get a defense approps bill done. We've cut defense in total by 18% since 2010. We've passed 36 CRs- our military is struggling right now. We have a total of 80 service members killed in training accidents. We need to pass an appropriations bill out of the Senate."
"The House passed the AHCA last year, but we have to get back to health care and focus on the individual market. We need more competition. This will be a top priority for  me to help folks paying 20,000 and 30,000 per year" #BaconTeleTownHall

@jbintner22 And I agree on this, time to elect state and local officials who fight to lower taxes... Ashford in Lincoln for 16 years was part of the problem.
@jbintner22 Between 70 - 90% of NE's taxpayers will get a tax break... the $10,000 property tax and up to $500,000 on mortgage interest deductions, doubling standard deduction, 60% increase in child tax credit, &amp; lower rates for all but millionaire earners will benefit vast majority of NE.
@BobIsntFunny To your second question, over 90% of tax payers will see a reduction in taxes... in place of very specific deductions that raise everyone else's rates, we double the standard deduction, put huge increase in child tax credit, &amp; lower everyone's rates but the most wealthy.
@BobIsntFunny She said the charitable tax deduction is gone and that is absolutely not the case.  However, the bill does take away the specific deduction when something is returned in value for the charity.  This interview occurred days before we voted on bill.
