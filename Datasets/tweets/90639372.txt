Like me, Alana believes that fed workers &amp; contractors shouldn't be held hostage over an ineffective wall! That's why she &amp; her fellow colleagues pounded the streets to gather folks affected by the #TrumpShutdown to speak up &amp; speak out for gov't officials to hear their stories.
Because of President Trump's inability to govern, his careless actions, and the pain he caused my constituents, I'm honored to bring fellow Philadelphian Alana Lewis, an @AFGENational organizer who fought on behalf of thousands of Americans during the 35 DAY #TrumpShutdown.
Later tonight, Pres. Trump will attempt to unify the United States of America during the #SOTU after creating the longest #GovernmentShutdown and causing immense harm to 800K hard-working federal workers &amp; contractors -- many who didn't have enough food to feed their children!

If state Attorneys General can hold the tobacco industry accountable in the 90s, then they should be able to hold gun manufacturers accountable in the 21st century ‚Äì lives depend on it! #EnoughIsEnough #EndGunViolence
Lastly, I'll introduce a bill that would effectively repeal a 05' law, the ‚ÄúProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act,‚Äù that's crippled many federal &amp; state lawsuits against gun manufacturers. It‚Äôs time we hold these companies accountable for illegal sales and/or defective guns.
The third bill I will reintroduce would require the #smallbiz administration to establish a grant program to address rising costs of tax compliance for small businesses, as these grants would go to small business development centers &amp; women‚Äôs #business centers.
Another bill I'll reintroduce is the Healthy Communities Act, which would require the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force to base its recommendations on health disparity populations, b/c driving just 20min w/in my district can mean a 23-yr difference in lifespan for PHL residents!
That‚Äôs why I'll reintroduce my 1st bill, HR 922, the Rehabilitation of Historic Schools Act, which allows public school buildings to qualify for a tax credit to address our crumbling schools. In #Philly, the avg age of a school building is 70 yrs old ‚Äì that‚Äôs simply unacceptable!

Proud to support my PA colleague @RepCartwright for co-chair of the Dem Policy &amp; Communications Committee. He‚Äôs a serious legislator who just won re-election by 9 points in a swing district.
Philadelphians are often described ‚Äúgritty,‚Äù and that might well be true, but folks in my city are also struggling to get by.		In 1 of the richest countries in the world, we should be ashamed of ourselves. Our nation surely has enough money to lift people out of poverty.
The new Democratic House, one that properly represents our country‚Äôs diversity, will continue to be #ForThePeople b/c we understand that every American should have a livable wage, access to affordable healthcare, &amp; a gov't that fights for them and THEIR interests.

This week I stopped by Ricochet a wonderful company in Philadelphia that specializes in making uniforms for our first-responders. Ricochet is a great example of a company who would not have been able to hire more workers if Congress didn‚Äôt act to pass the budget a few weeks back.
To build a stronger Philadelphia we have to focus on jobs, jobs, jobs! As your voice in Congress, I am focused on bringing more quality jobs into our neighborhoods.

Abbotsford Falls Family Practice makes it their mission to provide vital, holistic healthcare services to the uninsured and under-insured in order to give them the excellent primary care they need, deserve, and would otherwise not be able to receive.

SNAP plays an integral role in communities of color as it provides much-needed access to food to those who don‚Äôt have the monetary means to put food on the kitchen table. A cut to SNAP makes it that much harder for our neighborhoods to move forward!
Fiscal conservatives balked at President Obama‚Äôs stimulus package because of its cost, yet the same fiscal conservatives are unbelievably quiet as their President is growing the national deficit at an alarming rate. &gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/evLgOkZQQP
The so called ‚Äúentitlement programs‚Äù Rs despise &amp; want to drastically cut are the same programs millions of American rely on for stability &amp; survival. Programs such as Medicare and SNAP are too important to lose. That‚Äôs why as your MoC I‚Äôll work hard to protect these programs!
Nearly 1M children rely on the comprehensive educational services HEAD START provides. YET, Pres. Trump &amp; his Admin want to cut this beneficial program in the FY 2019 budget. It‚Äôs appalling and further highlights the lack of knowledge for what our children need to be successful!

Republicans MUST work alongside Dems to help our #DREAMers once and for all! Our DREAMers are our students, military service members, teachers, scientists, and our neighbors ‚Äîfor all the work they do to help our neighborhoods we should support them not force them out.
I call on @SpeakerRyan to bring immigration legislation that includes our #DREAMers to the House Floor for a vote‚Äîthe deadline for DACA is looming and lives are hanging in the balance!
For this yr's #SOTU I invited Jennifer Storm who is PA's Victim Advocate b/c I firmly believe that sexual assault, incl. domestic abuse, is not an issue we can afford to take lightly. Trump's words today about Rob Porter highlight why #MeToo movement is needed now more than ever.
I voted ‚ÄúYes‚Äù on the current budget deal but want you to know my support for our DREAMers is unwavering. I want there to be a path to citizenship for our DREAMers but shutting down the government isn‚Äôt the right solution.
Nationwide, 9M children rely on #CHIP. Voting NO on budget deal would've put vulnerable kids at risk. Voting no would've put 300+ PA CHCs in danger of losing funds. I couldn‚Äôt in good conscience vote AGAINST a bill that provides much needed access to healthcare for PA02 residents

Please know just as you elected me to this body to serve I'll always do the best job I can to represent your views &amp; beliefs in a way that is fair &amp; doesn't embarrass residents who are proud to call the 2nd District home. That is what this morning‚Äôs "Yes" vote was all about.
As your voice in Congress I am thinking about the needs of residents in the Second District each and every time I cast a vote on the House Floor. I voted in favor of the budget because I felt the benefits outweighed the negatives.
Our elections have consequences. The R's control all 3 branches of gov &amp; b/c of this they control the 3 P‚Äôs‚Äîthe process, politics &amp; policy. It is wrong for Speaker Ryan to hold the nation hostage &amp; deny hard-working Pennsylvanians &amp; Americans nationwide a vote on our #Dreamers.
I voted "Yes‚Äù on the budget deal brought before the House this morning because although the deal was by no means perfect I firmly believe this budget does more help than harm to our neighborhoods nationwide.

Republicans were ecstatic to pass their SCAM of a tax bill, but continue to be wary about passing programs that fill in the gaps of our #healthcare system. What‚Äôs the hold up? Bring a vote to the floor about CHCs‚Äî27 MILLION Americans rely on this access to care!
While health centers are left puzzled &amp; concerned whether a GOP-led Congress is going to reauthorize their funding, this year‚Äôs flu season is on track to be the worst in a decade!		Did Rs forget‚Äîyet again‚Äîthat American‚Äôs are dramatically impacted by their lack of governance?
In Pennsylvania, Community Health Centers see nearly 800,000 patients a year. But, without reauthorization almost HALF would have reduced access to care.	 	There needs to be less talk and more action, #CHCs are a true lifeline for quality care!
