The plan is for the headquarters to be in Washington DC, where Jane Sanders‚Äô operation is said to be based.
The internal goal is to have the most diverse campaign staff ever assembled on a presidential campaign, with the campaign eyeing a man of color as campaign manager and an Afro-Latina as political director, once the hires can be officially announced.
In working on launching Bernie 2020 for the last six months, the plan as relayed is said to be a similar grassroots energy as the candidate said today but also ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù infrastructure, with a goal of raising ‚Äú$150 million to $200 million‚Äù by the end of the year.
I‚Äôve learned from sources who have interviewed for positions on Sanders‚Äô 2020, that they‚Äôve been promised a ‚Äúreal sexual harassment policy‚Äù &amp; an ‚Äúoutside third party HR department‚Äù as he had during his 2018 campaign. They‚Äôve promised improvements to former Bernie staff this time.

Castro says as mayor he made Pre-K for SA happen. As president he‚Äôll make Pre-K for the USA happen.
There it is: Castro says 100 years after his grandmother came, two generations later, his brother is a member of Congress and he can say these words: I am a candidate for president of the United States
Castro says his is a community built by immigrants but also Native Americans, to cheers from the crowd
Castro says there was a time when he and his brother Joaquin wanted to go into journalism so he knows the press is a friend of the truth.
Julian Castro opens with a story about his mother who introduced him ‚Äî how she ran on Community Barrio Betterment ‚Äî with a slogan of giving government back to the people
Rep. Joaquin Castro says there will be a lot of candidates running, a lot of them are their friends and he wishes them well. But he knows with the crowd‚Äôs support they have ‚Äúthe best candidate with the best ideas and the best heart.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre y‚Äôall ready to elect a new president in 2020? Are you ready to elect my brother president in 2020?‚Äù - @JoaquinCastrotx not wasting any time
Just remembered that Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a fellow Texas native, told me ‚ÄúI absolutely would support him‚Äù of Castro 2020 back in June (!)
The backdrop of his announcement reinforces the idea, w/ Joaquin Castro telling me no frontrunners come from their San Antonio hometown, the kind of place where the working class residents are often underestimated and overincarcerated.
They see the southwest as fertile ground in 2020 and believe Castro, while behind in early polls, can galvanize a country tired of Trumpian leadership.
Long before O‚ÄôRourke shocked the country with his close race against Cruz, Castro‚Äôs inner circle believed that if he made it a couple point contest, that would prove that traditional swing states like Ohio would be replaced by new swing states like Arizona and Texas.
But at least when it comes to how he talks about the race ‚Äî and after Beto‚Äôs rise ‚Äî Castro‚Äôs embracing what it means to be the most serious Latino presidential candidate ever. What that means in the age of Trump, with a shutdown over the border, amid anti-immigrant rhetoric.
When I interviewed Castro last summer ahead of his first trip to Iowa, he told me how his a presidential run would focus on the Southwest, have more than an anti-Trump message and he and his brother downplayed being a Mexican-American and Latino candidate https://t.co/W1d8GfLMvt

So maybe the chaos he was talking about was what would happen if Hispanic voters across the country registered, mobilized and voted. Either way, I‚Äôll miss being able to give him a call, but will remember the stories he told me and how he wanted pols to be held accountable.
But that night in Vegas I tried to get him to admit he supported Bernie and he wouldn‚Äôt give it. He said he likes ‚Äúchaos,‚Äù but that wasn‚Äôt completely true. This was a man who wanted Latinos across the country to be empowered politically and he worked for decades to make it happen
The Culinary workers had delivered for Harry Reid, he explained.
I‚Äôm literally laughing looking at our texts because he told me to order him a rusty nail at the bar, texted out of the blue w/ ‚ÄúCall me, Hillary chisme,‚Äù &amp; was impressed when my private guess of how much Clinton would win the Nevada primary by was right. ‚ÄúU called it. U the man!‚Äù
In our chats he seamlessly went from in depth analysis of the Latino vote and it‚Äôs history to crazy quotable lines guaranteed to stir up trouble in the way that makes you wonder how you could be so fortunate to learn so much, have fun, and get paid for doing it.
He told me the Latino vote goes up when there is a clear villain perceived as anti-Latino (Trump) but also that Clinton was worried about Bernie and figured ‚Äúwe have Trump so the Mexicans will register themselves.‚Äù
Needless to say I liked him immediately. He loved to stir up some drama in the political world and folks like that can get people rolling their eyes. We talked Pete Wilson, Arpaio, and Trump for stories as well as Hillary and Bernie.
Gonzalez was a source &amp; a good man. He was one of those sources who finds u ‚Äî because they like your work or are perhaps bemused by it ‚Äî not the other way around. We first met at a bar in Vegas &amp; he texted ‚ÄúComing up. I'm a fat old bald Mexican w/ glasses. Grab me when I pass u‚Äù

@darrensands @AsteadWesley People have been talking about this, so reporting it is smart. It isn‚Äôt saying she‚Äôs in some grand trouble ‚Äî it‚Äôs saying it was a worrying sign to some Dems and Native American leaders that will likely need to be addressed in the future.
More to the point: She can be unveiling an economic plan, let‚Äôs say, and Trump can be at a rally and say he‚Äôs more Native American than she ever would be. It seemed to some party observers that it was a mistake because it ignores how we‚Äôve seen Trump would react.
This is a good piece by @AsteadWesley. An issue he mentions that I heard from Dems is how Trump would respond to this. It was seen as miscalculation because it didn‚Äôt put the issue to bed but just gave Trump more fodder to rob a couple news cycles in 2020. https://t.co/P18yltNOcy

Now obviously all Latinos are not going to register and all Latinos are not going to vote Dem, but the concern from Latino groups is that Dems continue to cast their eyes toward Trump voters who are longtime Dems rather than growing the base. The question is if not now, when?
@WeAreUnidosUS had two great voter briefs prepared that showed that of 25 competitive house districts where Latinos comprise 6% or more of the population eligible to vote (6 in CA, 2 each in AZ/FL, 1 in CO/NM) Latinos could overcome the winning GOP margin in 24 of them.
But Latino leaders uniformly said they expected more money to be available in 2018 because of Trump and I couldn‚Äôt believe the deja vu of group‚Äôs telling me the same thing now that they did in the summer of 2016: There isn‚Äôt enough investment in Latino voters.
There is a tension here. It existed in 2016, exists now &amp; will exist in 2020. Major white-led progressive groups are trusted by donors &amp; say they‚Äôre more metrics driven. Latino groups on the ground believe they do this work every cycle &amp; should be funded at higher levels.
But Priorities does digital and research efforts, not TV or on the ground organizing. In the case of Steyer‚Äôs NextGen Rising program, it‚Äôs spending in states like Arizona, California and Nevada but the program is aimed broadly at the youth vote, not Hispanic voters.
Priorities tells me their plan is for 20	percent of its spending in Florida, Nevada, and Arizona to go toward Latino voters.
I have reporting which didn‚Äôt make it into the story. @PrioritiesUSA, which commissioned the @LatinoDecisions polling in partnership with BOLD PAC that shows Latinos are angry at Trump, is working to survey Latinos across the country.
Rick Scott may have Trump to worry about, but he puts his money where his mouth is on reaching out to Latinos using things like Spanish-language TV during the World Cup and internet radio like Pandora, where you can target Latinos effectively in English or Spanish. https://t.co/SfgvKcNSNn

A different issue is whether Puerto Rican voters from Florida to Pennsylvania who are not recent arrivals will be moved to oppose Trump because of admin handling of crisis.
To assume there would be large scale successful efforts to register Puerto Ricans in 2018 is ridiculous and focuses on a partisan goal when people‚Äôs lives are involved.
As I wrote and everyone I talked to said from both parties: People Who arrived were worried about jobs, school for kids, and a roof over their heads. Any political aspect was always for 2020.

Ultimately isn‚Äôt this what we expect headed into 2018 and 2020? A Democratic Party and candidates saying what they stand for on immigration, guns, jobs, health care, instead of just being anti-Trump? That‚Äôs how @Ocasio2018 says she won.
And if you talk to elected Dems many are worried about the politics of #AbolishICE during midterms but some see the conversation playing out in a way that leads to reforming ICE even if the current conversation centers on scrapping ICE and replacing it with something better.
This has been an opportunity for the left to show not just where it stands on babies in detention but also where it stands on ICE which many feel was a rogue agency even during Obama years.
There are activists who work on immigration issues all the time ‚Äî not just when the cameras descend on the border. So during the family separation crisis it‚Äôs incumbent on Dems/progressives to show where they stand.
I don‚Äôt know what will happen with the Democrats and #AbolishICE but I know a couple reasons this new front is not bad strategy: In Obama era pressure from the left led to action on DACA, etc. With Trump showing who he is at border, the opposition is not going to tepid. https://t.co/LYaEjsoXgy

Anyway, that‚Äôs what I got! Good story from the Daily Beast. Here‚Äôs mine from earlier: https://t.co/hEs1tlUWpk
Another reason these talking points emerged was because other Democrats are used to looking to the CHC as a kind of North Star on thorny immigration issues and as the issue has picked up steam with @Ocasio2018 win, more Dems are being asked if they support #AbolishICE.
I got members like Gallego and Velazquez to talk abolish ICE in my story but when I reached out to CHC themselves they said it was hard to get members on the record to talk about #AbolishICE.
I‚Äôm told these talking points have emerged because Michelle Lujan Grisham is worried about her race for New Mexico Governor.
OK so here is the concern I had in my story around CHC embracing #AbolishICE from a source close: 		‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of fucking racism out there. If a bunch of Hispanics start supporting abolishing ICE, white people are going to read it as they don‚Äôt want to enforce shit at all.‚Äù

Here is a shocker that no one who does serious work in Latino communities will be shocked by: Constituents in her predominantly Latino district were most engaged by housing and health care issues. Abolish ICE was interestingly a bigger deal among the white progressives.
‚ÄùUnderstanding what people were looking for and speaking their language is one way of marking that.‚Äù
As @Ocasio2018 says, she didn‚Äôt want to be tokenized as a Latina candidate, which the advisor echoed: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about using her identity as a Latina to get votes, but about prioritizing that relationship with the Latino community.‚Äú
But some people would hang up when they heard English. When they began with Spanish the voter contact rate went way up.
Just got off the phone with an @Ocasio2018 campaign adviser who talked to me about her campaign speaking the language of her constituents, literally: Bilingual volunteers would call and begin in English and switch to Spanish which is a normal approach.
Only if people take this issue deadly seriously and a few have designs on higher office... https://t.co/zKM5cpc1cE
Now with Kennedy retirement and RBG age it will likely be a rallying cry for 2020 Dems: Doing anything to stop Trump from getting a third Justice on the court.

@Ocasio2018 is coming and she means business: 		‚ÄúI have dialed it back a notch since we first started, I never disparaged any individual people. But when Democrats are acting bogus on the DREAM Act, we‚Äôll call it out.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen I say ‚ÄòI'm going to abolish ICE, enough with this,‚Äô it's an intrinsic way of fighting against his agenda. I come from activism, a frontline is just that, a frontline,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúWhen I stick to my issues it's clear I'm fighting Trump without having to mention his Twitter. This guy is gross, offensive in every way &amp; he's going to be a bad person seven days a week. If we focus on his messaging, the only thing it's going to do is erode our mental health.‚Äù
She said voters are sick of candidates running on an "anti-Trump, not this" message. ‚ÄúThere should be a positive affirming message.‚Äú
A funny thing @Ocasio2018 told me on balancing hitting Dems vs. Trump: 		‚ÄúWhen I first started the campaign the initial focus was on Trump in the White House. When I first started I was much more harsh on the Democratic Party because I‚Äôm a Bernie Bro (laughs.) Don‚Äôt print that!‚Äù

On Democratic Party Latino outreach she hits hard: ‚ÄúOn issues that impact our lives, Democrats have not shown up. Democrats championed the Civil Rights Act but floundered on the DREAM Act.‚Äù
When I interviewed @Ocasio2018 for my newsletter she said U.S. deserves progressive candidates: ‚ÄúRed districts must swing blue and blue districts must swing bluer. This district is half-Bronx, half-Queens, and 70% people of color &amp; it's never had someone of color represent them.‚Äù

rather than just saying Trump is winning because he just decided to get very loud the last couple of days when the news cycle wasn‚Äôt in his favor.
If Trump is seeking to change the conversation and you let him that‚Äôs on you. But props to places like MSNBC, Texas Tribune, Vox and many others who are doing the hard work of covering this moment from border and a deep policy perspective
A @MALDEF staffer @MaritzaCPerez  raised $2,300 in a bday fundraiser for the # of kids separated in a couple days. The level of intense activism I‚Äôve seen on this issue from advocates &amp; Latino operatives is huge yet some people want to simplify it to ‚ÄúTrump is winning?‚Äù Really?
I checked last week out of curiosity and 150 of my Facebook friends had donated to the viral RAICES fundraiser for legal aid for separated families at the border, many of whom were not involved in politics.
Which is why I think it‚Äôs CRAZY if your response to this crisis is the simple ‚ÄúTrump is winning.‚Äù How? If you‚Äôre making easy comments like that you‚Äôre not looking at the full picture or don‚Äôt have a diverse group of people near you to see that this time is different.
As someone who has covered immigration for years, with a focus on what activists were saying to those in power and not just on the legislative and DC side, I‚Äôve been blown away by the visceral anger and grassroots activism from donations and volunteering that Trump has unleashed.
Yes, there‚Äôs always been racism in immigration debate because those affected don‚Äôt have a voice to defend themselves &amp; immigration is an issue not always deeply covered and understood.

@DanielYRubin If you have covered/worked in immigration for years you know how hard stakeholders work to have immigrants seen as human. Of course the fight is not over.

@Dannycasual22 The 180 is my hands are tied to doing something. I don‚Äôt think the issue is over as evidenced by the initial level of  outrage and pushback
Trump won because he beat everyone his way. GOP opponents. Fox News brought to heel. Hillary Clinton. He thinks immigration chest thumping without thinking through the consequences of brutal policy are a win for him in November. Time will tell if 2018 teaches a different lesson.
That‚Äôs why the national uproar was so noteworthy here. Lawmakers were saying they hadn‚Äôt gotten this many messages since health care fight. All over my Facebook &amp; Instagram people who normally don‚Äôt opine on politics were donating, venting, and educating themselves on the issue.
The rise of Dreamers in the immigration discourse was that. They go to universities, they‚Äôve been here all their lives. Crossing the border is illegal but advocates have always tried to contextualize why immigrants come here and demand humane treatment.
They may not look like you or speak your language but they have a child. They are a mother. They‚Äôre fleeing gang violence that killed one of their children so they fled with the other child despite a president that calls them an infestation, etc.
The biggest takeaway for me of the child separation fight and Trump‚Äôs 180 at the end is that this is what happens when Americans see the humanity of immigrants. That‚Äôs the constant battle activists are fighting.

I understand why Charlotte and Dave Willner want the attention on the work of @RAICESTEXAS, but it‚Äôs incredible that one mother and one photo helped raise $2 million from almost 50,000 donors for children separated from their parents at the border.
‚ÄúWhen we all come together in community efforts like this, we can find an antidote to the feelings of helplessness. This is just the start though, and donating is the easy part, so our hope is that people continue to be hungry for information and get involved.‚Äù
‚ÄúRegardless of political party, so many of us are distraught over children being separated from their parents at the border. We can‚Äôt all be on the frontlines to help these families, but by supporting RAICES, we‚Äôre able to do something that just takes less than a minute.‚Äù
‚ÄùOUR WILDEST DREAM is to find a celebrity or wealthy donor to match the $2 million raised for RAICES to the Texas Civil Rights Project and to the Florence Project (AZ).‚Äù
Facebook only permits them to set one beneficiary of a fundraiser ‚Äúbut there are other amazing organizations out there that also need support!‚Äù
They‚Äôre currently raising $2,000 a minute (wow) with a goal of $2 million ‚Äúto help arm @RAICESTEXAS to reunite families at the border and provide crucial services.‚Äù
As word spread, private donors stepped forward, &amp; people began sharing w/ friends &amp; making donations in honor of Father‚Äôs Day:		- The average donation is about $40	- Last night, they passed $1M in donations with matches, and this morning they passed $1M in regular donations.
The story of this fundraiser is of a mother who saw a photo that broke her heart. It‚Äôs a story about the power of one photo, this photo by @jbmoorephoto.

@NickRiccardi I was just talking about drowning out his record on key issues like immigration. I also heard plenty of people tell me he wasn‚Äôt good at elevating those things himself and Gardner ran a smart race. But your point is a good one.
1 more thing: There is lots of anger &amp; resentment at Scott from Latinos, as Caputo noted, whenever he is tied to Trump on Puerto Rico for example. But if he‚Äôs OUT there talking to people and drowning out Nelson‚Äôs record than Nelson could lose just like Udall did to Gardner in CO.
So, uh, that‚Äôs bad. Caputo‚Äôs piece does a great job of detailing why.
Scott‚Äôs team is skilled at traditional &amp; nontraditional Latino engagement something I‚Äôve covered before. But at different focus group than the one cited in the piece, a source told me a Latina voter responded like this when shown a pic of Nelson and asked who he was: ‚ÄúVoldemort.‚Äù
I also heard Nelson‚Äôs lack of Latino outreach isn‚Äôt new. A former Schumer aide complained that they couldn‚Äôt get him to send out Spanish-language releases.
Source tells me the only spending for Nelson is a $36k digital buy from Priorities for World Cup.
The World Cup advertisement is a perfect example. Reaching Latinos isn‚Äôt easy, but as Caputo noted, Scott has a $350k Telemundo buy. I also heard he has $100k digital for World Cup. A slam dunk to reach Hispanics in FL. But Latino operatives couldn‚Äôt get Nelson camp to spend.
Great piece from @MarcACaputo, nailing the utter confusion from Dems &amp; Latino activists over why Bill Nelson isn‚Äôt doing more to reach Latino voters. Dems could possibly not take the Senate because of lackluster Latino outreach in FLORIDA.		https://t.co/yTPV2nlJeQ via @politico

Bourdain‚Äôs shows ‚Äúwere about the dignity of humans.

@EricDKoch I totally agree with both. I actually like Warriors. I also couldn‚Äôt fit that I think he stays east because it‚Äôs easier to beat Celtics who are great team than battle Warriors in western conference finals.
1) Pundits can say what they want but Lebron picking new team every few years is The Bachelor for sports		2) I say Philly. What he wants is to beat Warriors, fix 3-6 finals record, not play 82 games (insane) or 45 mins a game &amp; relax till playoffs in yr 16 https://t.co/BujhVnZJuK
A great tribute to a man who has affected so many is to be nicer to people. https://t.co/OpV4QVYhX9
‚ÄúRaise a glass. Cook a pig. Hug a friend. We cannot have Anthony Bourdain‚Äôs life, but thanks to him I know damn well that all of us can still have fantastic lives of our own, and that‚Äôs no small thing.‚Äù		https://t.co/3LyRImJq1H

One thing that didn‚Äôt make piece but is strategy: Castro camp looking to see how close Beto O‚ÄôRourke comes to beating Cruz, feeling that will strengthen his Texas argument.
ICYM here‚Äôs the news in my Castro to Iowa piece:		- Castro eyeing AZ and TX in a run	- Harris and Booker laying groundwork in Iowa	- @RepCleaver literally endorsed him for 2020	- Castro supports $15 min wage, 2 years free college	- Castro rules out VP		https://t.co/W1d8Gg3nU3

One thing I found interesting was @RepCleaver acknowledging that Dems have probably taken black, Latino and young voters for granted but that candidates like Castro, Harris, Booker could cut thru that. He also endorsed Castro 2020 pretty early! https://t.co/Or08uIOqiY

And later: ‚ÄúReal politics is about movements. The formula never changed. Whether it‚Äôs Kamala Harris, Juli√°n Castro, or Jeff Merkley, if they‚Äôre not building a movement, they have absolutely no chance to defeat Donald Trump.‚Äù
.@NomikiKonst on whether Castro‚Äôs support of Hillary will hurt him w/ Bernie supporters says it will hurt some but not others: ‚ÄúCynthia Nixon was a Hillary supporter, but she‚Äôs a bold progressive unapologetically challenging the status quo‚Äù against Cuomo. https://t.co/Or08uIOqiY

Julian (and Joaquin) Castro downplay what it would mean to be the Mexican-American candidate in the race but his inner circle argues the Southwest (AZ and TX) is the new path to victory for Democrats in 2020 and he‚Äôs the guy to do it. https://t.co/Or08uIOqiY

One more thing on Bourdain: He used his privilege, his status, as a famous white man to go physically and rhetorically where others wouldn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt, dutifully shining a light on places and people that wouldn‚Äôt have gotten that attention otherwise. A real triumph. https://t.co/YWNsjp1RfP

I always found Bourdain‚Äôs take on the US-Mexico relationship to be worded in classic Bourdain and spot on: ‚ÄúOur brother from another mother. A country, with whom, like it or not, we are inexorably, deeply involved, in a close but often uncomfortable embrace." https://t.co/gqxU7nXDBO
