@leeleeb50 He continues to attack and disrespect whomever he wants without consequence or remorse.  Disgusting.
@MichaelAvenatti Interesting how these hysterical Trump supporters behave like children, just like Trump.  With all their name calling, and horrible grammar it appears that they love taking shots at what they think is the so called elite.   I am thankful I am not that ignorant/stupid.
@johncardillo The fact that your a proud to be a drunken, obnoxious lout is shockingly immature for someone your age.   Trying to score points and look cool to your ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù is not behavior for a responsible adult.  Yes, I am judging you.
@ssstarr14 @stucam7771 Trump cares about one person, himself and he will burn anyone who crosses him.  This is why the senate doesn‚Äôt have the will to do their job and do what‚Äôs best for the country as a whole.  It‚Äôs appalling and I never thought I would see things get so bad.
@ssstarr14 @stucam7771 Exactly!  What sad is these Trumpeters have more to lose with him in power.  If they could think critically and had a better understanding of the world and our place in it, they would think differently, one hopes.

@jenwcoleman @davitydave @senatemajldr Her story is more credible than his.  Many of his friends have come forward to say what a belligerent,aggressive drunk he was.  These are people who knew him.  This seemed to be a pattern.  I was in a relationship with someone like this.  Total sweetheart when sober, but...
@senatemajldr Most qualified in this nation‚Äôs history?  Sounds like more Trump hyperbole.   I don‚Äôt think even Kavanaugh believes that and if he does then he REALLY shouldn‚Äôt be on the court.
Ok, so it seems clear to me at least, that Republican senators intend to vote for Kavanaugh no matter what this investigation turns up.  They all know what kind of creep Kavanaugh is and they don‚Äôt care.  I think this is another ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the Dems.   Thoughts?

@prplcheetah @paganmist @AG_Martin1689 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @BrettKavanaugh That doesn‚Äôt mean the allegations are false.  Again, it is quite common for victims to not come forward.

@capnmj @drvoros @AveryAmerican @Utleyjacobite @Accountabilabud @rhpsscott @paulkrugman The truth is the truth.  I could care less about the politics.

@capnmj @drvoros @AveryAmerican @Utleyjacobite @Accountabilabud @rhpsscott @paulkrugman Only 2-8% of these allegations are falsely reported.  This woman is very credible and why would she risk EVERYTHING to make such a thing up.  It‚Äôs more troubling to me that people have suggested she‚Äôs a paid actor.  We need to believe these women.
There seems to many legal ‚Äúexperts‚Äù on Twitter who won‚Äôt use real names or pictures fighting hard  and lecturing people on why Kavanaugh is the victim.  They sound very convincing at times, but obviously have an agenda to discredit the women coming forward.  Russian meddling!!

@AveryAmerican @Accountabilabud @capnmj @Utleyjacobite @rhpsscott @paulkrugman Maybe you should post a real picture of yourself and a real name.  It would help with your credibility and maybe we wouldn‚Äôt confuse you with a Russian Troll.   Just a suggestion.
@AveryAmerican @Accountabilabud @capnmj @Utleyjacobite @rhpsscott @paulkrugman You asked what crime was committed or alleged.  Sexual assault is a crime, doesn‚Äôt matter who is investigating.  And most certainly the FBI can investigate anything they are instructed to investigate as directed by the executive branch.
@AveryAmerican @Accountabilabud @capnmj @Utleyjacobite @rhpsscott @paulkrugman Maybe you should look again, there is corroborating evidence and even if there weren‚Äôt the investigation could be set forth just from the allegations of Blausey Ford.  Several federal prosecutors interviewed on MSNBC have already said so.
@AveryAmerican @Accountabilabud @capnmj @Utleyjacobite @rhpsscott @paulkrugman It seems you already have your mind made up, so why the charade.  It would be more honest to admit you are bias.  This is not a court of law, once again.   And the FBI can most certainly be directed into an investigation.   Check the powers under the Executive Branch.
@AveryAmerican @Accountabilabud @capnmj @Utleyjacobite @rhpsscott @paulkrugman No need for profanity please.

This abomination in the WH is F-ING CRAZY!  If anyone still doubts this after this last press conference, well, you‚Äôre CRAZY too!
@psychdr100 It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.  He is 72 and obese and never does cardio.  The energy levels needed to do this job have to be high.  He probably does need help.
@Acosta It sure is.  It‚Äôs been dangerous since this abomination was elected POTUS.  It‚Äôs all his doing.  He is a menace and what‚Äôs dangerous is his the shocking level of stupidity he has displayed.  He is a complete fool constantly lying and telling everyone how wonderful he is.  ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
@CharlesMBlow They are trying to legitimize his depravity.
@kylegriffin1 Raise your hand if you laugh when someone has displayed extreme honesty.
@kylegriffin1 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@EdKrassen Lawyer to the pornstars that Trump paid off violating campaign finance laws?  Do they really think we are this foolish?  Maybe not but they know their base is.
@EdKrassen Am I missing something but Avenatti is a lawyer representing his client.  From where I am it appears he is simply doing his job.
@AveryAmerican @Utleyjacobite @capnmj @Accountabilabud @rhpsscott @paulkrugman Whoops looks like we have one now.  Judge‚Äôs girlfriend that was in the same room.  See how all this is going down?  Looks like this ‚Äúgood man‚Äù maybe a predator after all.
@EdKrassen @NBCNews SERIOUSLY???
@girlsreallyrule And the GOP has been following him along this dangerous, divisive, chaotic road.
@AveryAmerican @capnmj @Utleyjacobite @Accountabilabud @rhpsscott @paulkrugman Yep, just like every person accused of anything.  I am glad we agree.  Now let's hold off on this nomination and get the FBI to investigate.
I‚Äôm thoroughly convinced that any support for this abomination in the WH is being conjured up by the Russian Troll Army.  Don‚Äôt believe the hype or the numbers. We are being hoodwinked by Putin.  You see how this country is being divided and the proof of their involvement?
@EdwardAshton30 @realDonaldTrump The Deep State really gets around.  Interesting how they are the scapegoat for every problem with this administration.  Never mind the GOP controls Congress and the Executive branch.  But somehow they can inflict there damage.
@realDonaldTrump Third rate? According to who?  You and your very, very large brain?  You‚Äôre so stupid you don‚Äôt even know how ridiculous and absurd you are.  Such a sick and lost soul.
@realDonaldTrump Why as the POTUS are you insulting citizens who defend the rights of the victims?  You have lost your f-ing mind!
@WaltFrench @AveryAmerican @rhpsscott @paulkrugman @Utleyjacobite Their ‚Äúpolice force‚Äù is the Justice D. , FBI and any and all law enforcement in the country.
@AveryAmerican @WaltFrench @rhpsscott @paulkrugman @Utleyjacobite Again, you are presuming he is innocent and the women are lying.  On what basis or evidence do you draw you conclusions?  Make an argument please.
@AveryAmerican @Utleyjacobite @Accountabilabud @rhpsscott @paulkrugman You have presented no facts.  How do you know Kavanaugh is being smeared and these allegations are false?  Why are you so certain the women are lying?
@AveryAmerican @Accountabilabud @rhpsscott @paulkrugman @Utleyjacobite Exactly.  Let‚Äôs have the FBI investigate the claims.
@AveryAmerican @rhpsscott @paulkrugman @Utleyjacobite What data?  Provided by whom?  More claims with NO evidence.  At least the ‚ÄúDems‚Äù bring forth credible witness and evidence.
@AveryAmerican @rhpsscott @paulkrugman @Utleyjacobite So what?  Dems?  This is no longer political.  This is about allegations that this guy is a sexual predator.  Three women say so and one passed a polygraph.
@rickneaton @paulkrugman @PatrickMcGee_ What‚Äôs your point?
To all my resisters, the Russia-Trump Bot Horde is in full swing.  We need to take away their thunder and block any and all hysterical tweeting supporting this abomination in the WH.  We must take our country back.  Trump supporters don't care about the rule of law.  BLOCK THEM!
President Trump, while discussing US-China relations, said an expert on China recently said the country has "total respect" for his "very, very large brain."		THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING!
@krassenstein WTF?!!!!!!
@joshtpm Oh I see, so there are women who are angry he is being treated unfairly?  What is his point?  I don't care who is angry, there are women coming forward risking EVERYTHING to tell the truth about this creep.  Do your f-ing job!
@prplcheetah @paganmist @AG_Martin1689 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @BrettKavanaugh Why would they, they weren't sexually assaulted by him.  And how would they know anyway?  Suppose I sexually assaulted someone with no witnesses other than the victim, I am sure all of my friends would vouch for me too.  Is that then evidence of my innocence?
@AG_Martin1689 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @BrettKavanaugh Again, why doesn't it matter if she "waited" if in fact she did.  There are three women alleging sexual misconduct, this needs to be investigated.  What difference does it make when it was brought forward?
@CptnDuckman @martincynthia @SenFeinstein @snugasbug @JudiciaryDems Actresses?  Oh yeah, they are risking EVERYTHING to smear Kavanaugh.  For what exactly?  Fame?  Money?  So, you are saying this is another conspiracy, like Deep State?  Ridiculous.
@AG_Martin1689 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @BrettKavanaugh What's the advantage in waiting?
@AG_Martin1689 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @BrettKavanaugh These women‚Äôs allegations weren‚Äôt investigated.  They are coming forward now.  And, again, yes there needs to be a 7th investigation.
@AG_Martin1689 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @BrettKavanaugh Yes I do.  How are they supposed to ‚Äúprove it‚Äù without an investigation?
@AG_Martin1689 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @BrettKavanaugh Yep, absolutely.  FBI investigation, NOW!
@Rob_Bee2177799 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems Dude, use spellcheck and grammar tool.
@jamsmcgowan @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems Yeah, blame the Democrats for Kavanaugh's deviant sexual behavior.  It's the liberals fault that he is a sexual predator.  Trump is a LOSING!
@FARONORTH @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @FoxNews So what?  #RULEOFLAW
@AG_Martin1689 @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @BrettKavanaugh Absolutely!  This is about the RULE OF LAW!  I don't care what the political affiliation.
@martincynthia @SenFeinstein @snugasbug @JudiciaryDems Why does that make any difference at all?  Not to mention the victims wanted to remain anonymous.
@krassenstein @DiamondandSilk SUE THEM!!!!
@nancook ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be a rapist and alcoholic at the age of 17 and then years later, become a highly accomplished person.‚Äù   		Really?  Why not?  Are you a psychologist, psychiatrist or have special training in deviant behavior?  Apparently you can, e.g. Kavanaugh.
@krassenstein @MichaelAvenatti Third rate?  lol.  Hey Trump, you obviously can't take the abuse you are getting so just resign, PLEASE.  You are a ridiculous, stupid buffoon.
@briantylercohen What a joke.  Fox News, defender of all things Trump no matter what the cost.
This guy is out of control! https://t.co/B3KMVcByCX
@peterbakernyt Of course the traitor, criminal, fraud would champion another immoral person who will be his get outta of jail card.
@Kokomothegreat Why is it still be used?
Who keeps a calendar from 36 years ago?
@realDonaldTrump Why do you want this guy so badly?   Oh yeah, he‚Äôs your get outta jail free card.
@tedlieu Because apparently, Mark Judge is a total disgusting pig who would not be helpful to the GOP cause that‚Äôs why.
@Kokomothegreat If he is innocent, take the polygraph.   I know I would want to if I were innocent.  It doesn‚Äôt prove beyond a reasonable doubt but it does go a long way in preserving your credibility.
@Kokomothegreat Exactly!  What HS student even had a calendar?  And if they did they didn‚Äôt write down parties they went to or we‚Äôre going to.   This guy is caught and he is using a calendar to clear his name?  Lol
@EdKrassen Yep Kavanaugh has a twofold problem, the sexual assault and the lying about it.   So people say it happened in HS it shouldn‚Äôt matter, well it does when you continually lie about all of it.  This guy is Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúget outta jail free‚Äù card.   They want him in no matter what.
@EdKrassen Why even watch this garbage.  This channel is propaganda for the far right no matter how far right the Republicans go.
@essenviews This is really unbelievable the behavior of these Republicans.  They literally are going all in with the Trump immoral, ugly, hateful attacks platform.
@wvjoe911 I love the morbidly obese dude sitting in the chair smiling.  Very strange people out there who would promote this silliness.
@Kokomothegreat Sad that he is playing the race card.  It‚Äôs an outright insult to his victims.  He presented himself as a role model all those years, now he wants to be remembered as a rapist AND a liar.  Pathetic.
@samstein Wouldn‚Äôt it be refreshing if these predators admitted their guilt just once?  Always blaming someone else, or denying.  Very disappointing.
@CyrusMMcQueen I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll get a cushy cell away from the general population.
@DaddyDaddymac He so sick and pathetic it isn‚Äôt even worth their energy.  Just look at the guy, his brain is totally fried.
@treasonstickers @suzyq228 Yeah the whole word doesn‚Äôt like him and are in league with the Democrats to destroy him.  Isn‚Äôt that the Trumpkins theory?  Of course no evidence or facts to back their claim.  Trump followers are sheep and are willing to follow a tyrant.
If you want to bury your head in the sand as if this is all some conspiracy go ahead.  Nobody needs to prove anything to you.  üòÇ
Not just the roommate but the pattern of  sexual behavior.  There should be an FBI investigation.  But I guess just saying everyone is lying is the go to defense of the right. Lol.
What was the last time a POTUS was laughed at during a UN speech?  How bad is it going to get before we pull the plug on this buffoon?
@grynbaum Oh ok so that proves it then!  He couldn‚Äôt have sexually assaulted anyone because he was a virgin.  He should be disqualified just for this completely ridiculous and irrelevant comment.   This guy is such a fraud and yet his support from the right is unwavering.
@realDonaldTrump How did it feel when the world laughed at you?  You see you are now a global joke.  The most ridiculous and stupid leader to ever be elected.
@kylegriffin1 Why don‚Äôt you ask your wife.
@kylegriffin1 What a completely inane question.  The Republicans now cater to the deplorable Trump base as if that is the winning strategy.  Lack of morality seems to be cool to the GOP.
@AynRandPaulRyan The rest of the world see what a buffoon he is, why shouldn‚Äôt they laugh.
@dwm0924 @jimkim43319 @the_rev_zofo @SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley @FBI What facts?  Please stay on topic.
@SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley The simple truth is that you and your cohorts don‚Äôt want the truth to come out.  You and your party are in charge and you still seem to make a mess of things.
@SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley Yes, why not have an FBI investigation.  Why do you get to decide what a credible allegation is or isn‚Äôt?   Now we have THREE allegations, you can‚Äôt ignore this.   You and your base seem to depend on cockamamie conspiracy theories as your defense.
@SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley Always blaming the Democrats.  Everything is political to you guys when you are caught in your continued subterfuge.  Shameful that you act this way.  You‚Äôre Party and it‚Äôs thinking is not what America is about.  Shameful.
Kavanaugh‚Äôs roommate at Yale says he was a heavy drinker and was particularly belligerent when drunk.  He knew Ramirez as ‚Äúunusually honest‚Äù.  Kavanaugh needs to do the right thing and withdraw his name.
@army_momx2 @JTNealinDC @SenateMajLdr Well it looks like his roommate at Yale has corroborated about his excessive drinking and behavior.   And has said that Ramirez was unusually honest.
@AynRandPaulRyan Wtf is he even talking about?
@MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh Fox seems to get some of the most bizarre ‚Äúexperts‚Äù to discuss topics.  It‚Äôs entertainment and it shows.  Nobody in the legitimate news media takes them seriously as a news source.  Literally state tv.
@MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh Yeah Dershowitz really sold out didn‚Äôt he.  Just like so many Senators and Members of Congress.  I hope it was worth it     selling out to a fraud that you know fully well is damaging Democracy.
@ChrisCuomo Maybe if he were getting laid he wouldn‚Äôt have to resort to deviant behavior.   So, no the fact he was a virgin doesn‚Äôt make in bit of difference.
@BetoORourke Just shows you how his decisions affect the people of this country.  They are angry with the assault on truth and rights.  He is a fraud and people are calling him on it.   Politics is a rough sport, especially with so much on the line.
@bixler_becky @JTNealinDC @SenateMajLdr Because it is very common for victims to NOT come forward.  This question keeps coming up as the main argument.  Is this the only thing to make you think it didn‚Äôt happen?
@Kokomothegreat Awesome!!!

@Cghelo31 @SenateMajLdr I haven‚Äôt stated any outcome.  I want an investigation into the numerous allegations coming forth.  Nothing more.  It is important do know if the person getting a lifetime appointment to the SCOTUS is a sexual predator or not.
@ANTITRUMPMVMT @LesRhoads I love her!
@Censored1209 @JTNealinDC @SenateMajLdr None of these women came forward until now.  When should they have called the FBI?  So you think these women are lying and if they aren‚Äôt the accusations shouldn‚Äôt be investigated?  Please, explain.
@Cghelo31 @SenateMajLdr What did ‚Äúwe‚Äù do?  And how am I a disgrace?  So you think these women are lying as a part of some partisan conspiracy?  Please, explain.
@MichaelAvenatti Yep another inflammatory tirade by a Trumpkin.  Miserable, unhappy people.  Pathetic.
@Censored1209 @JTNealinDC @SenateMajLdr So it shouldn‚Äôt be investigated?  Now 4 women coming forward.  Hmmm
@DanRather I wish I could fast forward about 100 years and take a look at what this country looks like.  Now that would be a trip worth taking.
@titus730 @SenateMajLdr And growing
@JTNealinDC @SenateMajLdr So every guy who sexually assaults a woman should get the benefit of the doubt?  Ok that sounds fair.
@JTNealinDC @SenateMajLdr Why?  How do you know they are only accusations?  So what if they were 35 years ago.
@noveryfakenews @tlcannady @SenateMajLdr That right, it very common for them to not come forward after abuse.  I‚Äôm glad you are so cavalier in your support for a sexual predator.   But what do I know I‚Äôm only a snowflake and you‚Äôre a big strong conservative.
@SenateMajLdr So again, you are saying these women are coming forward and risking EVERYTHING because they simply don‚Äôt like Kavanaugh?   Nope, not buying it.   Kavanaugh is a sexual deviant not fit to be a judge on People‚Äôs Court let alone SCOTUS.  McConnell is a disgrace to the Senate.
@OliverLNorth Retired traitor and perverted gun lover, Oliver North accuses the women who were sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh of making it all up because of Kavanaugh support of the second amendment.   Ollie you‚Äôre a traitor remember?
@SocialPowerOne1 The traitor Oliver North ladies and gentlemen.
@SocialPowerOne1 Are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah these women just decided to make all this up and risk EVERYTHING because of Kavanaugh position on the 2nd Amendment.  These gun people really have a sick, perverted love affair with guns.   Very strange.
@perlmutations Just once I would love for one of these guys to admit their guilt.
@AnnCoulter This b@#&amp; always mad about something.  It must suck being so uptight lol.    She really needs a hug.
@AnnCoulter You‚Äôre such an ugly, disgusting woman.   ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
@AnnCoulter Real mature.
@BetoORourke Absolutely!!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You people brought it on yourself with nominating a serial sexual deviant.   Take responsibility for your own actions and quit whining on Twitter.  You‚Äôre a Senator for God‚Äôs sake, start acting like one!
@DaddyDaddymac Move to New Zealand.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump What happened to nobody being above the law including POTUS?  If he isn‚Äôt above the law why can‚Äôt he be indicted?  This makes no sense at all.
@perlmutations I thought the ‚Äúadults‚Äù had everything under control?   üëåüèΩ
@McFaul @nytimes @realDonaldTrump We all know what‚Äôs going on.  He is attempting to intimidate, smear and lie about his perceived enemies in order to affect the investigation.  Trump is obviously guilty and his only recourse is to use the office to wash away the investigation.  Clear obstruction of justice.
@McFaul @nytimes @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs only fake when it doesn‚Äôt serve his purpose.
Ok Resisters, if Trump gets rid of Rosenstein and then fires Mueller what are we going to do?  March on Washington?  I would be willing to take vacation time for that.
@ellievan65 @JuliaFleming Yeah let‚Äôs lower the bar just for Kavanaugh because this guy is someone we can‚Äôt live without.   ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
Democrats/Liberals stand for human and civil rights, the rule of law, protection of the planet for future generations AND the fight against tyranny.  Freedom for all!  If this isn‚Äôt what America is about please enlighten me.
@mschlapp Yes it is a disgrace when you try to push through a serial sexual deviant and then expect everyone to roll over.
@mschlapp Quit whining for heavens sake.
@McFaul Thank you!
Rosenstein to resign.  What is Trump going to threaten and fire everyone who is investigating his criminal behavior?  Looks like it. üò©
Kavanaugh has another accuser.  Imagine that!  This time the woman was assaulted by him when they were both freshman at Yale.  It‚Äôs almost ALWAYS a pattern with these deviants.
@Sojourners @JAlmerini That doesn‚Äôt excuse them from their unflinching support of POTUS.   How does a supposed Christian, support this abomination?  I man who lacks any morals or decency is a man that your so called God wants in office?   You see how you lose credibility so quickly by pawning God?
@Unpersuaded112 @ComfortCat @ChuckGrassley Somewhat agree.  But being young doesn‚Äôt mean you will be any less hateful, hypocritical or irresponsible.  But yes we need younger people in Congress.  We need some new thinking for sure.
@peterbakernyt Oh, he didn‚Äôt have it on his calendar?  Well that settles it then.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ

@mitchellvii @MichaelAvenatti Yes, there is and he is the current POTUS.
@JasonMillerinDC Who cares.
@kfhall0852 Absolutely.  I see Trumpkins as hateful, miserable, unhappy people who like to blame others and point fingers and deny any wrongdoing on their ‚Äúside‚Äù.
@RealMuckmaker Religion is the oldest and most ridiculous rackets ever conjured up by humans.  It is superstition, supernatural wishful thinking.  It has no place in an evolved society of critically thinking people.  IT‚ÄôS TOTAL NONSENSE!

@rudagert @Chauffeurde3 Thank you.
@SantaBarbaraCo4 @KayaJones Most people don‚Äôt want a sexual predator on the SCOTUS.  Continually making this about politics completely misses the point.  If ANYONE breaks the law they should be held accountable.
@SantaBarbaraCo4 @KayaJones Yet the right likes to promulgate conspiracies about Hillary with no proof or rationality.  And people have brought up Beto‚Äôs history quite often.   Maybe, it because the majority of people see that a lifetime SCOTUS pick is more critical to their lives right now.
@SantaBarbaraCo4 @KayaJones One is a lifetime appointment, one is not.  The people who vote will decide whether Beto deserves to be in the Senate.  The people don‚Äôt have such a vote for the SCOTUS.
@LiberalLecter Because liberals encourage peace, cooperation and compassion we are weak and called snowflakes or whatever.  In their minds, supporting guns, corporations, disregard for the environment and selective racism is macho and strong.   Oh and they are threatened by intellectuals.
@LiberalLecter I have stopped trying to figure out ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the Trump Cult follows him blindly, but then I remember how people in cults behave and none of it is rational, reasonable or decent.  They hate liberals more than they love Trump, that‚Äôs why they hang on.
@kfhall0852 This is how low Trump has lowered the bar for the standard for the SCOTUS.  In fact his mere presence has lowered the bar for Washington D.C.   Look at all the shady, inexperienced, hateful people he has hired or surrounded himself with?  He has created a swamp.
@stucam7771 I don‚Äôt think they love Trump so much as they totally despise liberals.  Why?  Who knows.  People will always find excuses to hate other people no matter how irrational.
@AnnCoulter Ann Coulter, forever looking for publicity and getting her pterodactyl face on TV.  What a clown.  üòÇüòÇ
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump He doesn‚Äôt care about anyone or anything that doesn‚Äôt promote him or his brand.  His whole life has been dedicated to make himself more money, regardless of who he hurts.  He‚Äôs a mob boss, nothing more.

@DrDenaGrayson @GOP @realDonaldTrump You see a pattern here?  All the biggest creeps end up working in the Republican Party and it seems as though that‚Äôs just the kind of person their ‚Äúbase‚Äù love.
@EdKrassen EXACTLY!!!
@perlmutations Conflicts of interest?  Mueller cares about ONE thing.  THE RULE OF LAW.   These guys are spinning 24/7 in the hopes to discredit.  The problem is that all the people pleaded guilty and the mountains of evidence.   Yeah, but there‚Äôs nothing there.  Beyond unbelievable!

Actually, it‚Äôs different, like he said when you‚Äôre famous they let you do it.   This is what the POTUS thinks about women‚Äôs rights.  Yet here he is, telling people what to do.
@GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump What can you say about this guy that hasn‚Äôt already been said.  Trump continues to cast stones from a glass house that has been repeatedly shattered.  There is no shame or decency in him.  He is deplorable and all the brain washed haters that hysterically eat it up.

@BeautyBind @realident This Judge guy sounds like he should be working in the WH or Fox.   He sounds just like the other sick, hateful zombies e.g. Hannity, Dobbs, Carlson.  I wouldn‚Äôt doubt if this guy doesn‚Äôt get his own show.

@100_Disable_vet Good point.  The ‚Äúright‚Äù , and I use that term to describe anyone who is willing to follow tyranny over democracy and fiction over truth, seems to think calling people names will suppress our convictions to democracy and the rule of law.

@_SJPeace_ So stupid.  üòÇüòÇ
@DaddyDaddymac No because I don‚Äôt associate with people in those circles.
@CyrusMMcQueen Damn!  I want that!
@SpongeHarris @DrDenaGrayson @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Last I check text messages voicing disapproval of elected officials is a national security violation.  Nothing in that directive shows that any of this information should have been released.  He is hoping to create more conspiracy and hysteria among his base.
@SpongeHarris @DrDenaGrayson @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt see how declassifying text messages is transparency that the American people want or even care about.  You are saying none of this involves the ongoing Russia investigation?  Why now?  It is clearly a smear job, no matter how you spin it.  Interesting angle though.
@tedlieu @Janis45462304 @AriFleischer It shouldn‚Äôt deny you all chances, but most certainly deny you to the SCOTUS.  Ari Fleisher, where did they dig up this hack?  Press Secretary Fleisher, lol.  I remember him during the Bush years, he was as irrelevant back then too.

@Cup_of_Joe2 @essenviews @Nevada_Dem @tedcruz @BetoORourke Lol.  Poor guy looks like he fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch going down.
@essenviews People in Texas would actually believe this?  Lol.  This has got to be a joke.
@Mastermind7864 With this guy it‚Äôs ALL believable.   This is who he is.  He looks like some kind of lounge lizard you see skulking around the casinos, with little hands and stinky breath.   Oops that‚Äôs exactly who he is.
@wvjoe911 And they like him because of his teeth and good looks.  lol.   This is the kind of shit Ted‚Äôs base cares about.   üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@tribelaw That‚Äôs because Trump doesn‚Äôt recognize the rule of law.  He feels the law doesn‚Äôt apply to him, so there you go.
@benyc Yeah especially if it was a crime.
@TheRickWilson Yeah, I can live without the details.
@SpongeHarris @DrDenaGrayson @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump How does this justify Trump declassifying information and making public text messages?  What exactly is the purpose of him doing this?  Motive?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump This behavior is unconscionable.  The rule of law most certainly applies to him.  INDICT HIS ASS!!!
@_SJPeace_ I think a lot of cop are interested in protecting people, they are more interested in being macho want to be tough guys and use their authority to beat and kill people.  Sorry but not all are like this but it takes only a few to give them all a bad name.  They are BULLIES.
@_SJPeace_ The cops come at this guy like he just robbed a bank or something.  They are poorly trained on how to deal with people in the community.  This is fucking ridiculous.  At least people are recording it to put a spotlight on this overly aggressive police work.
Disgusting, still can‚Äôt believe it. https://t.co/1Q2Lt8ELba
@JohnWDean Absolutely!  The subterfuge is so obvious.  It must be that the GOP doesn‚Äôt consider sexual harassment or assault a serious crime.
Why does it seem that everyone in Trump‚Äôs orbit has sexually harassed or assaulted a woman?
@atrupar Then why do it?  Crickets.
@ddale8 He‚Äôs angry because he doesn‚Äôt agree with his lie?  Hmmm
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump It tells me your facts are incorrect.
@SenateMajLdr Haha what do you call Garland‚Äôs nomination?  What a joke.
@realDonaldTrump We‚Äôll see.
@maydaymindy9 He is REALLY creepy.
@AynRandPaulRyan @StormyDaniels Wow!  I don‚Äôt like Trump at all but I don‚Äôt know if we need to hear this.  Pretty childish.  On both sides.
@DanRather They are rushing because they know their time is limited.  Come November the tables may full well turn and the Republicans and all their corruption will be exposed.
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump @SenFeinstein Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself, so this is yet ANOTHER lie.  What is that now 5,101 since he‚Äôs been elected?
@CharlesMBlow Black man harassing a white women is no different than a black man harassing a black woman?  Really?  Ok so back to the real world.  If Anita Hill were white Clarence Thomas would NOT be on the SCOTUS.  FACT!
@CharlesMBlow He would have not been nominated.  Very good point.   Thank you.
@SocialPowerOne1 This guy is completely nuts AND dangerous.   Does he ever do his job.  It seems he is Trump‚Äôs little piss boy, running around with a bucket to clean up.  These are your representatives in Congress people!  Playing games like children in the schoolyard.  DISGRACEFUL!
@eugenegu Who paid for it?  What?  Who fucking cares who paid for it.  Is this some sort of alternate reality where all the stupid people have taken over?  Wait, no this shit is really happening!

@DaddyDaddymac Cannabis is not only good for migraines but seizures, extra pyramidal movement of Parkinson‚Äôs.  Research also shows that it may even slow down or prevent Alzheimer‚Äôs by disrupting Lewy body formation.  Do you need any more reasons to use cannabis?  üòÅüòÅüòÅ
@DaddyDaddymac Because the generations from the 50s, 60s, 70s weren‚Äôt brainwashed into thinking cannabis was dangerous i.e. ‚Äúreefer madness‚Äù.  Alcohol was considered socially acceptable and cannabis was not.  There are many people who are still ignorant but with more knowledge comes less fear.
@Goss30Goss The same way we have this idiot in the WH.
@EdKrassen Of course they do was referring to the Republicans wanting to rush this thing through.
@EdKrassen Of course they do.
@RA_Robbins @peterbakernyt @ChuckGrassley Thank you.  Who cares when it‚Äôs introduced.  That doesn‚Äôt make it any less significant.
@Glennsford @peterbakernyt Exactly.  Dumping 10‚Äôs of thousands of documents the night before confirmation hearings?  Grassley really thinks we are as stupid as the Trump Horde.
@peterbakernyt The timing means nothing.  The fact is there are allegations and they need to be addressed.  More diversion and deflecting.
@tedlieu This guy is so tainted with controversy.   His confirmation should be voted down or he should remove his name.
@tedlieu Absolutely!  Kavanaugh is not fit to serve on the SCOTUS.  Repeated lying during the hearings, sexual assault AND his idiot assistant throwing White Power signs on television.  Really?
@mbprice5 @silo1981 Bullshit!
@mbprice5 @JohnBrennan Yes they do.
@JohnBrennan This is a criminal investigation that is bearing fruit.  We have seen guilty pleas from people who were directly involved and orchestrated his campaign.  Right now, it appears that Trump‚Äôs only defense is denial via ridiculous, redundant, defiant tweeting.
@perlmutations Probably one of the most embarrassing displays I have seen by a sitting POTUS.   This guy is devoid of any compassion, empathy.
@realDonaldTrump By the way, the Justice Department now owns a condo in Trump Tower.   They are all over you like a cheap suit fella!   üñïüèΩüñïüèΩüñïüèΩ

@eclark23 @econmikekeith @mgmirkin @Liser63 @MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson I don‚Äôt see your point sorry.  Fox is licensed as entertainment not not news for liability reasons.  Entertainment NOT news, but keep trying to convince people by all means.
@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Nobody cares about that...at all.  When Obama said it it was a minor slip.  If you said it it just confirms your stupidity.

@Dangchick1 @safetysuzie @realDonaldTrump I believe karma is simply the law and people catching up to you.  His behavior is an abomination and in humanity‚Äôs earliest beginnings this kind of behavior would be rooted out and eliminated.  It was cast out because it did serve the tribe as a whole and was dangerous.
@ChelseaClinton So sad how many angry, hateful people out there.  They can‚Äôt figure out how to fix themselves so they try to break others who are succeeding in life.   Maybe someday these people will learn that isn‚Äôt the way and become productive members of society.
@roadmastersgirl Yes, this absolutely makes sense.  These are formative years and this is the time where they are like little sponges.  It‚Äôs the perfect time to teach them about life.
@JRobbo Of course because is Mueller is SMART and Trump is STUPID.  It really is that simple.
@RepDonBeyer @contrarymary197 The scum of humanity is upon us.
@PuestoLoco @KamalaHarris @SenatorLeahy First Thomas now this guy.  SCOTUS justices should be held to the highest moral standard and we have seen evidence this guy is dishonest and deceitful.  Put him on the court tarnishes the reputation of the court but this country.   What message does that send to the our children?
@StevenBeschloss And what is his point?  Is this supposed to make him look smart?  Or is some random insult on Obama he felt that in a time of national crisis he had to share.  WHAT THE FUCK!!!
@StevenBeschloss So ironic how this scumbag, this absolute abomination of a human being attacks people with the highest character and reputation constantly.  He really is so pathetic and insecure.  This guy ALWAYS feels he is being slighted or attacked.
@StevenBeschloss Talk about obsessed.  He know more about Obama then his job!
Has anyone else been ‚Äútagged‚Äù for unusual activity and blocked?  Then asked to pass a challenge to prove your not a bot?  Is this Twitter monitoring or has someone complained to get you flagged?

@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Oh and @MichaelAvenatti did you notice that on the screen he described YOU as the creepy porn lawyer.  There cute little entertainment show is so obvious and appeal to the brain washed, shallow gene pool horde know as the Trump Cult.  THEY ARE LOSING!
@AynRandPaulRyan @MichaelAvenatti The only thing the Fox News horde understands is personal smear jobs and attacks.  And then Carlson tries to be the voice of reason lol.  It really is an entertaining act of subterfuge.
@AynRandPaulRyan @MichaelAvenatti It‚Äôs rich how Carlson tries to paint himself as the voice of reason.  This guy likes to spew hate and lies and wonders why someone like Avenatti is fired up.  Carlson is a putz!

@RealMuckmaker Just like Trump they talk tough but they are actually cowards.  They like to point fingers at people and blame others for their own failures.  It‚Äôs a form of self loathing.  The sad thing is they actually think Trump cares about them.
@RealMuckmaker Just another ‚Äútough guy‚Äù looking for attention.  Most of the Trump Cult are these types.  They call liberals names because they are cowards who bully to look tough.  It‚Äôs sad because most have perpetually lost in life and  here is their chance to win something.

@seahorse2021 @HillaryClinton @atensnut Exactly decades old and you are talking about it.  Stop reliving the past.  Trump is the president now.  But yes of course point fingers at other people instead of getting off your ass and doing something about it
@dashhoofer_dev @HillaryClinton @BarackObama Trump‚Äôs the president now so he should do something.  Quit bringing up the past as an excuse for the present.  Own it!

@perlmutations Yes, I don‚Äôt doubt it.  As Bob Woodward said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to wake up‚Äù.   How much more nonsense from this buffoon can we take.  Anyone who is convinced he is ‚Äú doing a good job‚Äù is not serious and not to be trusted.  Seriously!
@AoDespair Yeah this shit has to STOP!  This guy is a total menace and actually believes in what he says because he is such a narcissist his mind won‚Äôt let him acknowledge failure.   Very sick indeed.
@LaurenJauregui Absolutely.  I am willing to have a civilized discussion with anyone.  However the Trump Cult is apparently unable to have this type of discussion.  I don‚Äôt need some shallow gene pool buffoon yelling obscenities at me either.  üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ

@MsEsmee @HillaryClinton Many of us who are true Americans and not sell ours to this corrupt regime care about her opinions.  Just because you ignorant kooks want to make up garbage to tarnish her reputation doesn‚Äôt make her less of an American.  Shame on you!  Trump is a traitor, fraud and liar.
@HillaryClinton A lot of things about this guy set off alarms.  The biggest being his lack of candor and dishonesty.
@realDonaldTrump This beyond disgraceful.  How ANYONE could characterize the PR debacle as anything other than a TOTAL FAILURE is beyond all logic and reality.  3000 DEAD=FAILURE!

George Bush fundraising for GOP.  C‚Äômon George I thought you outgrew this nonsense.  ü§®ü§®
@GBPackerNana @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump @GOP Seriously, A+?  This is getting really, really creepy.
@rolandscahill Nice of you to throw in a jab at the Mayor of San Juan since she called you out on your failure.   Really and truly jaw dropping that you could even remotely call what happen in PR a success.  You are such a very sick person.  You need to resign right now.
@tedlieu And Lou Dobbs has ZERO credibility since he signed up to be your personal shill on Fox.
@tedlieu Well certainly we should listen to Lou Dobbs, he isn‚Äôt biased at all.  And by the way, the Investigation isn‚Äôt finished yet!  And how do you and Lou know anything what they‚Äôve found?  Is Mueller briefing you two everyday.   YOU ARE INSANE, RESIGN TODAY!
@SocialPowerOne1 This the best Fox can produce?  Some twenty something blonde hate monger.  That is all this person does is spew hate and always blaming someone for something.  She needs to be ignored.  She has one purpose to spread division and perpetuate racism.
@realDonaldTrump So you can lie about all the friends you lost on 9/11?  You lost ZERO friends in 9/11, only in the Presidential Debates you said you lost ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù.   Your total lack of shame is unbelievably shocking.
@EricBoehlert Very good point.

@SocialPowerOne1 What‚Äôs more delusional is thinking Woodward would write a book saying how great he is, seriously!    This guy ACTUALLY thinks he is doing a good job!!!
@SocialPowerOne1 Seriously, is ANYBODY buying this?  I hope that there aren‚Äôt those who are so delusional and clearly brain washed into thinking for one minute this can be validated at all.  I would to hear a MAGA take on this one.  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@AynRandPaulRyan @HuffPost Fucking RIDICULOUS!!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Yes, he actually said this! https://t.co/XBmYwHCJFT
@RanttMedia @tweetMalena We ask ourselves, how can this be?  That there are Americans out there supporting this absolute disaster of a POTUS.  Then I realize the saying, there‚Äôs a sucker born every minute and I have my answer.   These are your Trump U. graduates.
@Margarita2733 @KevasRobert @NBCNews Only this idiot!
@Orvieto2016 This is how MAGA‚Äôs debate.  They run out of anything intelligent to say and they resort to profanity.  This what happens when you don‚Äôt have the ability to critically think or use even basic logic.  They are the dregs of society.
@KenRow1 @maggieNYT And there are millions who don‚Äôt like the direction the country is going.  So not sure what your point is or if you even have one.
@KenRow1 @maggieNYT If you like hate, personal attacks and negativity from this guy everyday.  I don‚Äôt see prior administrations being investigated only this one.  Oh and please explain to me why America isn‚Äôt great already and when was it last great?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I honestly can‚Äôt fathom how this guy calls PR a success.  This guy‚Äôs is totally devoid of any sense of reality.  Seriously, Puerto Rico was a success!!!üò©üò©
@1789MFN @KevinMKruse @realDonaldTrump Wow you got me.  Nobody said anything about buildings.  The Russians have been buying his properties for years in order to launder money.  Deutchebank, which does business with Russia was the ONLY bank to loan him money after all his bankruptcies.  So yeah, he owes Russia.
@KenRow1 @maggieNYT Yeah Woodward who is widely respected for his intense scrutiny of facts and truth in his writing is just going to decide to just make things up.  Yeah, that ain‚Äôt happening.
@Jasshugh2 @BeastModeGran @JasonHalle Wrong on both your posts and who is talking about socialism?  Government benefits i.e. Social Security and Medicare are social programs but that doesn‚Äôt make us a pure socialist society.  Rich people are already in power in case you haven‚Äôt noticed.  What, exactly is your point?
@AdamSchiffCA But he‚Äôs a real God-fearing man right?   ü§Æ
@SocialPowerOne1 Don‚Äôt give this guy ANY publicity please.  ü§Æ
@1789MFN @KevinMKruse @realDonaldTrump Yes he is.
@truromanticlife @realDonaldTrump Great post!  üëçüèΩ
Awesome!!! https://t.co/1cMu4EStPp
@1789MFN @KevinMKruse @realDonaldTrump And your stats on the Obama economy are flat out wrong of course.  But Trump and his cult don‚Äôt care about facts that‚Äôs why he and you have ZERO credibility.  Be gone now troll.
@1789MFN @KevinMKruse @realDonaldTrump Russian, huh?  Trump went bankrupt after the Taj Mahal debacle and was $4 billion in debt and then Putin came to bail him out by having all his mafia thugs by up his properties at inflated prices.  Money laundering.  Trump OWES Putin EVERYTHING!  He is a criminal and traitor.
@McFaul It makes me sick thinking about how this guy has got over in America.  He is so blatant with his disregard for the rule of law and his total lack of compassion and empathy.  Why can‚Äôt people see what a fraud he is?  It‚Äôs maddening really.
@McFaul Just another in a long list of reasons why he is mentally unfit to lead the country.  How long must we endure this abomination?
@SocialPowerOne1 And people wonder why Kaepernick kneels.
@MaggieJordanACN @realDonaldTrump This tells you that this man is truly sick.  Even in our most horrible tragedies he makes it about himself.  Very sick indeed.
In case you forgot. https://t.co/MJjXtxQOmL
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump He also said he lost 100s if friends yet he can‚Äôt name one.  He also remarked that Trump Tower would be the tallest building in NY after.  And ending his comment about 9/11 with an exclamation point?  Again, the ‚Äúleft‚Äù has a problem with this fraud.  It‚Äôs a shame he conned you.
@maggieNYT Again, why would someone in Bob Woodward‚Äôs position make up a story like this?  This is beyond implausible.  If I trust anyone to tell the truth about what‚Äôs going on in this circus, it‚Äôs Bob Woodward.
@maggieNYT I‚Äôm sorry but you can‚Äôt make me believe that Bob F-Ing Woodward would make up anything.  Seriously?  What would he have to gain other than ruining his reputation?  Rob Porter?  Who the hell is he and why should anyone believe anything he says?  What‚Äôs his reputation?
Trump apparently was bragging after 9/11 that Trump Tower was now the tallest building in NY.  Does this surprise you?  I know typical narcissistic disorder, total inability to concern yourself with anything that doesn‚Äôt involve yourself.  Wake up people!
@Scotty_2017 @99tf @RudyGiuliani So how does any of that exonerate Trump?  I have said before you literally have to believe EVERYONE is lying and willing to ruin their reputation to get Trump.  And Trump is totally honest and forthcoming?
@Scotty_2017 @RudyGiuliani So why didn‚Äôt the Republican controlled Congress do anything?  Deep State?   Oh yeah.  Always many allegations with no proof or evidence.  Divert and deflect.
@RudyGiuliani Ok great so let‚Äôs wait for Mueller‚Äôs report and in the meantime you can shut your mouth for awhile.  As Trump‚Äôs lawyer why are you litigating your case on Twitter?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yes, we get that you attack as a strategy for defense.  You use one person and then concoct some baseless conspiracy to cover your arse.  Yes we see what a fraud, liar and con you are.
@CuomoPrimeTime Roger Stone is a con-man on the level of Trump.  They are from the same cloth.  Stone is known for his antics and for spinning.  And yes he is under investigation for his part in Russian collusion.  You listen to him and he can almost convince you if you don‚Äôt pay attention.
@maggieNYT Yeah, I really don‚Äôt need to hear about Giuliani on 9/11.  He didn‚Äôt do anything any other mayor would have done.
@RudyGiuliani @maggieNYT Yeah I remember when people actually thought you were America‚Äôs mayor.  For what?  Now look at you.
@bsrlee72 @LindaLyonQueen @realDonaldTrump if you can‚Äôt see that then nothing will make a difference to you and I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt see it for what it is.
@bsrlee72 @LindaLyonQueen @realDonaldTrump and he has no intellectual curiosity and he thinks of NOBODY but himself.  So no, what Obama did as POTUS does not bother me.  Obama did an amazing job considering all the hate and racist venom thrown his way and his families.  Trump is a disgusting, depraved human being...
@bsrlee72 @LindaLyonQueen @realDonaldTrump Obama is no longer the POTUS.  Obama never did anything that would cause alarm like this man does.  He has no regard for truth or the rule of law.  And he has worked with Russia and Putin to affect the Presidential Election.  He is has no depth, no ability to think critically...
@keithboykin And that is exactly what happened!!!  This is happening in America today!  And the POTUS could care less.  üò´üò´
@CyrusMMcQueen Absolutely.   Basic care an compassion is sorely missing today.  So much anger and hate everywhere and this pathetic excuse for a POTUS is front and center to stoke the flames.  This guy is a total menace to our country.  He needs to be removed by any means necessary.
@artsycarol @JasonHalle Sounds like a tax to me?
@BeastModeGran @JasonHalle The Trump supporter would get run over if it wasn‚Äôt for us liberals looking out for them in spite of their ignorant naivety.  They don‚Äôt mobilize and have no resources or wealth.  Honestly where would these Trumpkins be without us?
@BeastModeGran @JasonHalle Honestly if it weren‚Äôt for intelligent liberals all these Trumpkins would have nothing. The GOP would take away any and all benefits they might have and their wages would be non existent.  Would they still be cheering without food or shelter?  Because that‚Äôs what would happen.
@JasonHalle @catlover1943 Thank you

Watch Active Measures and tell me that it is some conspiracy.  You really think EVERYONE is lying and he is telling the truth? That is not even remotely logical.
@LindaLyonQueen @realDonaldTrump You can honestly tell me you think Trump is honest and Woodward is lying?  So EVERYONE is lying but Trump?
@realDonaldTrump Yeah Woodward has a reputation for lying and you have a reputation for being honest.  Who the fuck believes ANY of this?  ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
@realDonaldTrump You were lost the popular vote and you CHEATED TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY.   Watch Active Measures.  You sold out your country because you owe Putin for bailing you out of $4 billion debt and having Deutschebank lend you money when NO U.S. bank would.  That about right?

@ChrisCuomo Because he is UNABLE to tell the truth.  We already know this about him.  Yet people keep enabling this pathological behavior.  This country needs to wash its hands of this abomination and get back to work with serious people.

That would be a small punishment for the pain you have inflicted on millions.  There is nothing more for you to say.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes You stole the election with the help of your Russian mafia buddies who report directly to Putin.  Nobody should wonder why you dismiss U.S. Intelligence reports and side with a murderous, brutal dictator.  You were broke, nobody would lend you money then Russia bailed you out.
@SocialPowerOne1 Trump is compromised and is willing to do anything to increase his wealth and power.  This is a constitutional crisis. I don‚Äôt mean to scare only to make us all aware of what we are dealing with at this fragile moment in our history.  America is about Freedom, not tyranny.
@SocialPowerOne1 between us, to divide us and create increased levels of hate.  There are certain news outlets doing there bidding as well. The mid-terms are coming and we are under attack just like 2016.  This president has had a business relationship with Russia and Putin for years...

@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs a FACT that Russia (Putin) bailed you out when not ONE bank in the U.S. would loan you money.  You were broke and went into business with Putin.  DeutscheBank lent you millions which you failed to pay back.  Then Putin helped you win the presidency and smear Hillary...

@jwheels74 @frothybrownpool Absolutely, you should be concerned as am I.   This administration was elected on false pretenses and racial, political divide.  Watch Active Measures please!
@jwheels74 @roadmastersgirl Yes disturbing.  Tribalism has been with us since the very beginning, it will always be here I‚Äôm afraid however, that doesn‚Äôt mean we can limit the spread and overwhelm this kind of thinking with a more positive message.
@eugenegu Her finger gestures are very telling.  If it is a white power gesture then it just shows you people who work for potential Supreme Court justices are so bold not to hide their bigotry and hate.
@eugenegu This woman acts like a child, she should be removed from the hearings for disruptive behavior.

@JohnWDean I have a feeling that Mueller is drowning in evidence on the guilt of Trump.  Mueller himself can‚Äôt believe how crooked this guy is.
@JohnWDean I‚Äôll say.  I‚Äôm seriously wondering HOW he will be removed from office not IF.   His head just may explode before we have a chance to impeach.  That would save the taxpayers money.

@Jukehorse50 @roadmastersgirl The best and brightest are members of Club Trump eh?
@DaddyDaddymac Did you see the crowd in back of him in Billings?  They looked not only bored but confused as well.  This guy is becoming a bigger liability by the day.  This person(s) who wrote the op-ed need to step up and invoke the 25th Amendment if they care at all about this country.
@CyrusMMcQueen Of course not.  üò¢
@TheRickWilson @wendytheflea This was a great piece Rick and captured my sentiments 100%.  If this President is unwell, there job isn‚Äôt to enable and make decisions on their own.  They weren‚Äôt elected.  25th Amendment needs to be evoked...NOW!!
@AmoneyResists @roadmastersgirl She is literally acting like a child!  Making faces, gestures, playing on her phone.  Are you fucking kidding me?  And this hot mess of a person works for Kavanaugh?  We need serious people working for us, not these ASSHOLES!
@AmoneyResists @roadmastersgirl Really?  And this woman apparently works for Kavanaugh?  He should be denied confirmation simply for her antics.
@MrDane1982 @roadmastersgirl Damn right!!  I would love to see what Corey and Kamala could do together in the WH.   Now that would be something to see.  üòÑüòÑ
@AynRandPaulRyan This is almost sad really.  But notice his rallies are being held at more and more obscure places?  Billings, Montana?  Next stop, Moosejaw, Alaska.   ü§îü§î
@AynRandPaulRyan Yeah this guy is coming off the rails and no amount of spinning will hide that fact.  He has enablers now, not staff.  This is serious shit.  Whoever wrote the op-ed now is taking it upon themselves to make decisions instead of the elected president?  More illegal behavior.
@CurlingRules24 @wendytheflea What is with this ridiculous woman?  Why don‚Äôt they sit her somewhere else after the first day.   It‚Äôs quite obvious she has some sort of personal agenda that she feels is appropriate to spread during these hearings.  Seriously, she should be removed!

@tedlieu @nytimes @POTUS Yes, maybe however it did throw shock waves into the WH and was clearly evidence of what we have expected for some time, that this guy is mentally incompetent and unstable.

@BookDesigner321 @TexDem_Dkos @CharlesMBlow Yes you are right about these people continuing to hate and blame groups of people for their misery.  But they are fighting a losing battle.

@lmroppasweeney @ChrisCuomo @NYT @CuomoPrimeTime I think you are right to a point.  He definitely needs to be removed but we need to understand what is the best way.  I don‚Äôt know what the burden of proof is for removal via the 25th but they may not have to invoke this.  If the Mueller investigation bears more fruit, and I‚Äôm..

@ChrisCuomo @NYT @CuomoPrimeTime Keep them guessing is a good thing.  He will turn the WH upside down trying to root out the culprit, meanwhile burning many staffers.

@headpatrolman16 @chucktodd @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I still don‚Äôt see any evidence of wrongdoing by Hillary or any other of the conspiracies the right constantly spews out.  There are many allegations but no FACTS or EVIDENCE.  And using the Deep State conspiracy to explain everything is lazy.  BTW if a Deep State exists...
@headpatrolman16 @chucktodd @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So Fox only gives us the undistorted facts?  You can really tell me Fox isn‚Äôt biased?   Really?  You have to look beyond your perception and search for the truth and that requires EVIDENCE.  This idea that the media is biased only goes so far.
@headpatrolman16 @chucktodd @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It only seems that way to a person who is blindly following this despot.  You can only dismiss the facts so long.  Forget CNN and MSNBC, every credible news outlet has been following this circus of lies and deception.   Denying the truth is all Trump and his cult have left.

@Engelbertsy @zizabella @DanRather Huh?  What difference does it make where the TRUTH comes from?
@DanRather And yet he still relents.  Now calling Bob Woodward a liar?  His days are numbered.  His only defense is continually lying when the facts say otherwise. This is so ridiculous it‚Äôs teetering on insanity!
@SocialPowerOne1 You know this guy‚Äôs act is getting more and more ridiculous.  I for one welcome it, because he become less credible and hopefully soon he will stop getting headlines and becomes irrelevant like O‚ÄôReilly.
Trump is quoted saying feckless things like, about the war in Afghanistan, ‚ÄúYou should be killing guys. You don‚Äôt need a strategy to kill people.‚Äù		The truth is more frightening it turns out.
@EdKrassen The ‚Äúbest and brightest‚Äù run scared the other way from this Administration.  Then again, would you trust this guy to tell you WHO the best and brightest are?
@EdKrassen For the good of the country, this guy needs to be removed NOW!  Bob Woodward‚Äôs book has apparently confirmed everything we know and didn‚Äôt want to know.  This guy is literally a petulant 12 year old in a grown man‚Äôs body.  HE IS FUCKING NUTS!!!

@TomFromJersey @wendytheflea Seems to me she is looking for attention.  Making gestures and faces during a SCOTUS confirmation hearing?  Do these people take anything seriously?  Is everything a joke?  I have never seen such childish behavior from people who are supposedly respected.
‚ÄúThis book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad‚Äù, statement from WH on Bob Woodward book.		Uh, nobody has to make him look bad he does a great job on his own.

@PassTheSalty @wendytheflea He even looks like a total creep.
@EdKrassen His base are totally irrational and devoid of any semblance of discerning truth from fiction.  They would follow this lunatic right off a cliff.  TRUMP‚Äôs BASE IS A CULT.
@EdKrassen Yep unrestrained power is what he seeks and has basically shown contempt for the rule of law.  We have a criminal as a POTUS who believes he should be given a blank check to run this country like a corporation. Now you know how he got this far.
@eugenegu Wtf?
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre truly a disgrace to this country.  You originated from the lowest levels of frogshit at the bottom of a New Jersey scum swamp!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you can tell the whole story why there is resistance.  And why you want him on the court.  But, alas we can never get the truth from you.  You literally lie about everything.  It is really getting exhausting.

@BetoORourke Of course he did.  He hates everyone including himself!
@VayaCorp @Tylerhales9 @AksWise @BillOReilly Really the best thing to do is not respond to racist bigots.  They just hate and point fingers at other people.   Because they‚Äôre intellectually lazy and not worth your time.

@JohnBrennan Absolutely Mr. Brennan!  This clown thinks he is real cute with his incessant tweets and insults of dead American heroes.   He is an abomination and about as UNAMERICAN as a person could be.
@DaddyDaddymac Yes!  No good has come from their meddling.  They have proved to be a hostile actor.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah it the DEMOCRATS fault you broke the law and sold out America.   It‚Äôs the DEMOCRATS fault that you disrespected an American hero the day he died.  Of course, it‚Äôs EVERYONE else‚Äôs fault you‚Äôre a depraved piece of GARBAGE!!!

@DaddyDaddymac At first I avoided conversation about politics.  As time has gone by I really can‚Äôt consciously be a friend to someone who supports this egregious behavior.   The biggest point of contention is racism.  How does one reconcile supporting Trump and  his inflammatory racial taunts?
@Upnparr @TammiLMorgan @roadmastersgirl @ritawilliams527 @OneNewLeader @MichaelAvenatti Well then you have the other cohorts who have plead guilty or received immunity.

@TomiLahren And what is your agenda exactly?  Yeah you‚Äôre right!  Our platform doesn‚Äôt involve conspiring with foreign countries to affect an election, it also doesn‚Äôt include dishonoring American heroes, it also doesn‚Äôt include separating kids from their families.  Does that clear it up?
@TammiLMorgan @roadmastersgirl @Upnparr @ritawilliams527 @OneNewLeader @MichaelAvenatti How does one explain away all his cohorts who are cooperating with the Special Counsel?

@Judydn5 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump She doesn‚Äôt care, right?
@realDonaldTrump They‚Äôre coming after you because you broke the law repeatedly.  Does that clear it up for you?  Oh and Hillary WAS investigated.  Why do you try to explain your innocence by using Hillary?  Leave her alone!  Quit dragging people into your depraved abyss!  The law is NOT partisan!
@realDonaldTrump Ok, then why did he meet with them?  What was so important that you had to meet with Russians in Trump Tower?  Adoptions?  Whoops you changed your story on that one.  So why did you change your story?  You see how you keep digging that hole deeper?

@glenn87027633 We still haven‚Äôt learned from the days of Prohibition that making drugs/ alcohol illegal doesn‚Äôt work.  It makes the country MORE dangerous.  And it‚Äôs a fallacy to suggest that we will all turn into drug addicts and throw our lives away.
@JohnMonch @SandraTobias7va @mehworth @alforoughi @thumppooh Very good point.  No points for second place.
@SandraTobias7va @lildevil_Dani I guess the GOP is all in on their campaign of hate and division.  Their new platform is intolerance and tribal loyalty.  They are truly lost and their behavior is UNAMERICAN!
@anniebrenn @wendytheflea Regardless of political party, the rule of law applies to EVERYONE.   If Hillary was guilty of anything I would feel the same way.  Trying to make this political is a way to divert and deflect and avoid the truth.  That‚Äôs all I want...THE TRUTH!
@anniebrenn @wendytheflea I‚Äôm sure this doc will be reviled by the right wing apologists but I am willing to watch a doc of their version and make up my decision based on EVIDENCE and FACTS, not emotion or prejudices.  I was willing to give Trump the benefit of doubt at one point as well.
@anniebrenn @wendytheflea I read some of the comments on IMDb and of course the responses divided on political lines.  Why can‚Äôt people look at things objectively and make their decisions on fact.  I am willing to see the other side‚Äôs story and compare.
@glenn87027633 The idea that everyone would become ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on drugs is absolutely false.  In fact, drug abuse and deaths would go down.  Research the facts people!
@glenn87027633 It may not be popular, however legalizing ALL drugs would save lives and all but eliminate drug related crime.  People need to be educated on the pitfalls of drug abuse and decide for themselves.
@glenn87027633 Making drugs illegal doesn‚Äôt stop people from getting them.  What it does is put those people in danger unnecessarily and also opens the doors for criminal enterprises.  Just think what would happen to all the cartels if drugs were legal?
@glenn87027633 Fuck yes!  Cannabis is a SAFE drug.  Meaning you can‚Äôt overdose and it has medicinal and therapeutic benefits that we are now just uncovering.  Future generations will look on our IGNORANCE and shake their heads.

@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump The anger and outrage is justified.  This country will not tolerate a hateful,spiteful, divisive leader from ANY party.  This is not about politics it‚Äôs about a POTUS who thinks he is above the law and who lies and spreads ridiculous conspiracies to save his own arse.
@realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt care what their feelings are toward you.  You are a fraud, con, criminal with no compassion or soul.  You are unfit to be leading this country and you should resign immediately.
@BeerHolder95 @AshaRangappa_ @ElmShakespeare Obsessed?

@realDonaldTrump Sooo if the news is fake who do we listen to? You?  Soooo everyone who reports on you is lying?  EVERYONE?  Can you please tell us what news to trust.  EVERYONE is so dishonest except for YOU.  Hmmmmm
@realDonaldTrump @BretBaier My advice, which I intend to follow...SOCIAL MEDIA IS BEING USED BY RUSSIA TO SOW DISCORD AND DIVIDE US, GET OFF SOCIAL MEDIA UNTIL JAN 2019.  Goodnight and Good luck!!!!  Yes, I am serious!   Starting NOW!
@realDonaldTrump @carlbernstein You are hoping it‚Äôs fake, however you know of all the crimes you have committed and Mueller is breathing down your traitorous neck.  Play all the Twitter games you want, you will go down as the most infamous, disgraced and dishonorable American to ever be elected to office.  FU!
@ProudResister Of course this shit never ends.  He does nothing but congratulate himself for things that never happened.  But nobody checks him on it and he gets away with it.  Might as well just give him everything he wants, he seems to be getting it anyway.
@DemWrite @ProudResister I really don‚Äôt understand what these right wingers want.  Do they really want to live in a fascist state with that petulant child giving the orders?  I refuse to acquiesce!
@DemWrite @ProudResister Congress is completely useless at this point and the Supreme Court is going to get a conservative majority.  We are in trouble if this maniac in the WH isn‚Äôt removed soon.
@DemWrite @ProudResister This fucking moron who NEVER tells the truth is literally doing whatever he wants and nobody is stopping him!  Nobody!  All we do is complain and express our outrage, yet nothing happens!  Is this how‚Äôs it going to go down?
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump We need Mueller to speed up this investigation so that we can expose Trump for the fraud that he is....RIGHT NOW!

@realDonaldTrump Please tell me this is not what you hope diverts attention from the investigation into treason.  Nobody cares about emails, they care about your criminal activity.  You have too much SHIT in your past and the STINK can‚Äôt be covered up.  The walls are closing in fella.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, ok, right, whatever.   Let‚Äôs talk about something more interesting and relevant like YOUR criminal activity such as tax fraud, defrauding the government AND treason.  Yeah that‚Äôs more interesting than dragging up closed investigations about emails.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson You conspired with a foreign government to win an election.  And now you‚Äôre trying to cover your ass by deflecting and diverting like your old mentor Roy Cohn taught you.  At least you‚Äôre predictable.  You are a CRIMINAL, gangster and you NOT an American, you are an abomination!

@PuntOnThird @ShylaMurcia @Healthypauper @Painterwrites @SethMacFarlane Yes, as I said at that time he should be indicted for treason.
@realDonaldTrump No need to look into the other side because there is no malfeasance.  Now back to your criminal activity.  Let‚Äôs try to focus on that and answer the questions...yes?
@Healthypauper @ShylaMurcia @PuntOnThird @Painterwrites @SethMacFarlane These revelations aren‚Äôt the ones that will bring Trump down.  His well known involvement and complicity with Putin will.  We will soon find out that Trump actively and willfully conspired with Russia to affect the outcome of the 2016 election.
@Healthypauper @stun1ock @EnjoySomeLogic @Painterwrites @SethMacFarlane I don‚Äôt believe anyone has said that Trump is culpable because of Manafort being found guilty.   I think the Cohen plea is more revealing.  However, this is just the opening salvo for Mueller.  In time we will see the full extent of Trump‚Äôs involvement with Russia.
@ShylaMurcia @Healthypauper @PuntOnThird @Painterwrites @SethMacFarlane Until we see he conspired with Russia in affecting the outcome of the 2016 election.  At that time Trump will, in my opinion, be indicted.
@nerdalert4 @chaneykyoto @Healthypauper @Painterwrites @SethMacFarlane Why must you engage in name calling.  Act like an adult and you will have more credibility when trying to get your point across.  Good luck.
@bridget_joy_ @PaulMayATL Yeah he said flipping is unfair.  What, telling the truth to avoid a longer sentence is unfair?  I love how Trump always tries to blame the innocent victim.
@PuntOnThird @ShylaMurcia @Healthypauper @Painterwrites @SethMacFarlane They didn‚Äôt have any of this on Clinton so I‚Äôm not sure what your point is.  Besides that there is more to come down specifically Russian tampering.  Mueller has many more cards to play so I am not too concerned at this point.
@HellaLovingLife @Healthypauper @Painterwrites @SethMacFarlane Nothing but he is a unindicted co-conspirator in a felony.  That should be enough.
@PreetBharara Oh and Preet, thank you for your service as a honest and compassionate American.  You should be admired for what you have done and stood up against.  Kudos to you sir.
@PreetBharara Giuliani has lost all credibility  and this is his new legacy as blathering, confused, silly side show.  9/11 was a long time ago and he got too much credit for that anyway.
@WileELiberal @PreetBharara I love that perjury trap.  ‚ÄúI was trapped into telling a lie!‚Äù  Hard to believe people are stupid enough to believe that that could even happen.
@PreetBharara Absolutely ridiculous the level of stupidity this circus has risen.  Trump says testifying against someone you conspired with to commit crimes should be illegal? Are f-ing kidding me?
@perlmutations The dominoes keep falling and the evidence mounts.
Trump says the stock market would crash if he were impeached: ‚ÄòEverybody would be very poor‚Äô
@Healthypauper @Painterwrites @SethMacFarlane The rule of law applies to everyone regardless of party affiliation.   Now do YOU agree that Trump should be removed?
@Healthypauper @SethMacFarlane No Clinton should not have been in jail but removed from office.  Trump should suffer the same fate.
@SethMacFarlane The GOP is riddled with hypocrisy.  They have lost their way and have acquiesced to the more extreme faction of that party.
@abbydphillip @wendytheflea And the crowd at his inauguration were the largest in history.  And who says that about them self anyway?
@HoarseWisperer @wendytheflea Spoken from a guy who can‚Äôt get a loan from any banks in this country.
@PreetBharara Flipping?  It‚Äôs coming clean and telling the truth.  Sure he wants to limit his sentence but according to Trump he should take the fall for something that Trump directed.  Trump committed a felony   The only question is does he get away with it.
@washingtonpost It is frightening that his supporters AND members of Congress will not lift a finger to stop his criminal activity and boorish, depraved, bigoted commentary.  He is a menace to democracy and this country as a whole.
@Revelat60516378 @realDotardTrumq @SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump And yet no bank in the United States will loan this ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äù a dime.  How do you reconcile that?
@Revelat60516378 @realDotardTrumq @SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump This investigation is just getting started.  Mueller is probably the most respected and thorough criminal prosecuter of his generation.  We will see in the coming months that Trump and Putin orchestrated the whole election tampering.
@Revelat60516378 @realDotardTrumq @SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Yet we still don‚Äôt have his tax returns.  So he had a successful reality TV show is proof that he isn‚Äôt involved in criminal activity?  Again this has no bearing on the criminal investigation just more deflection which is not a strong defense.
@Revelat60516378 @realDotardTrumq @SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump That is going to be his defense?  That he received some medal?  That has no bearing in the criminal investigation.
@Revelat60516378 @realDotardTrumq @SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Yeah it happens all the time and Trump has already been caught lying about it several times.  And there is audio of his discussions.  No way to spin it, he is in legal jeopardy with Russian collusion yet to come.
@Revelat60516378 @realDotardTrumq @SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Why is it funny.  The content was already investigated and no criminal charges were warranted.  Trump knows much more about the hacks and Russian interference than he is leading on.  A pattern of criminal behavior from this fraud.
@ddale8 What‚Äôs disgusting is Frump was relieved of the news that the guy was undocumented so that he had something to give his base.   Didn‚Äôt give a damn about the girl who lost her life.  Nothing is sacred to this guy.
@ProudResister @wendytheflea @realDonaldTrump Fact, and it doesn‚Äôt bother Frump that they are potentially going to prison and he doesn‚Äôt care.  Some loyalty.
@MaryWalterRadio @AP The FBI and Justice Department concluded their investigation and no charges are to be brought.  But in other news...
@realDonaldTrump Why isn‚Äôt he a good lawyer? Because he doesn‚Äôt lie to cover up your felonious activity?  You should protected him fella.  But alas you‚Äôre too stupid to figure that out.  Loser!
@realDonaldTrump Only 8.  Great way to spin it.  I‚Äôm sure Manafort can take solace in this when he spends the rest of his life in prison.  You‚Äôre next!
Robert Mueller is the f-ing boss!  True American protecting our democracy and rooting out corruption.  My new hero!
@dsmith1917 @ThrilliamCXP @realDonaldTrump Haha.  Just keep watching.  More to come!
@JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump Haha you are LOSING!  I love it!
@realDonaldTrump Exactly!  Everyone but you has lied.  Too bad we have your wire transfer of $130k to Cohen... whoops.  If you had any honor at all you would resign and admit your guilt.
@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @LannyDavis @LockHerUp4Life Russian bot continues propaganda campaign.
@PreetBharara Unbelievable!
@perlmutations Down goes Trump! Down goes Trump!
@SunnyDee2526 @Revelat60516378 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Why are you so aggressive with your comment?  You lose credibility when speaking in those tones.
@RandyRsi @ericaj58 @SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúThey‚Äù did everything to keep him out of the WH?  Who is they and what did they do exactly.  And please no cockamamie conspiracy theories.  What should they have done different?  What proof do you have they interfered?  There is none.
@Acosta I LOVE IT!
@AmericanWow2017 @realDonaldTrump Quit deflecting Trump is POTUS and he has a lot of questions to be answered.  Clinton and Obama have nothing to do with Frump‚Äôs traitorous ways.  Take responsibility and quit pointing fingers.  That‚Äôs what guilty people do fella.
@AmericanWow2017 @realDonaldTrump Nope Obama was a POTUS.  Trump is a criminal and traitor.   Nice try though.
@realDonaldTrump Right everyone is lying except you right?  Most of the news is verifiable and factual.  Plus they are reporting on things that actually happened and/or you have said.  I see you are sweating, the walls are closing in fella!
@SarahLies4Trump @realDonaldTrump The presidential effect on the economy is overrated as a rule.  The Federal Reserve has more power influencing the economy than the POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump Manafort and Cohen going to prison.  Worried yet?
@realDonaldTrump You are so ridiculous lol
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @PARISDENNARD @seanhannity The only traitor is Frump.  Sorry Russian bot.
@GeorgeTakei Everyday this guy becomes more of a buffoon.  He is a national disgrace.
@realDonaldTrump This buffoon bad mouthing respected former officials is ridiculous.  His entire life of POTUS has been one big lie, con, fraud.  He hasn‚Äôt done ANYTHING that merits respect from serious professionals like Clapper, Brennan, Mueller.
@SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Quit making up conspiracies about Clinton and Obama.  You have to believe the entire government is conspiring against Trump, ridiculous and the last resort of the guilty.  Yep everyone is lying except for POTUS.  Hahaha
@SunnyDee2526 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Lol.  More ignorant nonsense from the base.
@realDonaldTrump The walls are closing in on you.  Keep tweeting, it won‚Äôt save you from your traitorous misdeeds.
@realDonaldTrump I swear you have the mind of a 10 year old.
@realDonaldTrump When are you coming to SF for a rally?  That would be epic!  Oh, wait, people here actually think for themselves and read books.  Never mind.
@realDonaldTrump Trump running to find his hysterical, conspiracy theory kooks for support.  Zzzzzz.
@ddale8 This guy has truly lost whatever mind he had.  He just babbles, stream of consciousness,  it is scary how unfit and unstable he seems to be.
@cnnbrk I can‚Äôt believe there is any reasonable doubt with the mountains of evidence against him but we‚Äôll see.
@perlmutations Rudy! Rudy!   This guy needs to go away.   You almost feel sorry for this blathering idiot.  His mind is clearly gone.
@jk_rowling It‚Äôs almost hard to insulted by the mental midget.  He is such a buffoon and such a relic it‚Äôs hard to take him seriously.  But then he is the POTUS and that fact is very sobering.
@GavinNewsom He‚Äôs such a buffoon!
