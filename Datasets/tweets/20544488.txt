Consumers (voters) want free ad-supported CTV options in addition to their paid subscriptions. This is fueling the growth in OTT.
Myth: there is no ad fraud in OTT. Truth: as much as 20% of OTT impressions are invalid. OTT buyers, just like digital buyers, need to make sure they have access to the data that can detect and prevent ad fraud.

The smart folks at @digiday looked at what a $5.2 million Super Bowl ad can buy in digital media - https://t.co/LyEQdflJFb
That means about 7 out of every 10 homes in America will be tuned in to the #SuperBowl
btw that stat of 111M #SuperBowl viewers is from @Nielsen	 https://t.co/VHnnJL7tDQ
For most advertisers the $5M price tag makes it too expensive. Too much waste. Sometime's it's just a decision your heart makes, not your head.
The other question I hear... Is a #SuperBowl ad worth it? Almost always the answer is no. But for a few key brands, it IS a great way to reach 111M people.
Fun fact. That‚Äôs 5x more than @eagles QB Nick Fole‚Äôs base salary this year.  https://t.co/NtyJ7P4Nyy
