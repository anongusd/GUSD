If Syria responds to the military action proposed by President Obama, is that an act of war against the United States?
@beatcanvas Which is exactly my fear. This "limited" authorization will become anything but narrow.
@ScheveM Some seem to think odds of authorization being granted is fading. Those in swing seats are going to vote with the polling.
If Syria responds to US airstrikes by attacking our ships, does the President then have authority to do whatever he wants? (2/2)
Honest question: If very limited authorization is given for airstrikes, would escalation allow Obama to bypass War Powers Act later (1/2)?
No answers given on what comes next after we start dropping bombs. Kerry/Dempsey don't know # of rebel forces, or what % is AQ/extremist.

There was plenty to cheer for from the Hawkeye defense, but the offense is just miserable with no real hope in sight.
It's frustrating watch the Hawkeye program slide.  Iowa and Iowa State are two programs moving in opposite directions.
We saw a classic example of winning ugly today from Iowa State.  They could easily have won that game by 21 points.

@KentSorenson thanks for being there tonight.
Mary Mascher thinks that Prevailing Wage will help grow Iowa's population.  Huh?
House is at ease.  D's trying to get the 51st vote back on board.
A little bit of drama with Rep. McKinley Bailey saying he cannot support the bill without support for community colleges.
@ABI_NMolt Thanks!
Representative Rick Olson admitted to me that this bill is unfair for the large counties.
Jodi Tymeson is doing a great job of making the point that this bill is price fixing.
Rep. Kaufmann delivering empassioned arguments against the bill.  This is bad for rural taxpayers.
Time certain for a vote on HF333 set for 5:20.  We'll vote at or before that time, regardless of where we're at on debate.
Quorum call right now.  Apparently, Rep. Bailey indicated to the media that he's a firm "yes" for HF 333
Appearing on Jan Mickelson's show (1040am WHO) with Rep. Helland at 10:00.
It's 6:30, and we're still waiting for the amendment.  Too bad we can't adjourn and take this up on Monday.
Still waiting...
The 51st vote that is in play belongs to Larry Marek (D-Riverside).  He campaigned on a pledge to vote 'no' on the labor bills.
Debate is on hold pending a new amendment that is being drafted.
Debate will being at 1:00
Today we will be debating HF333 (Prevailing Wage).  Apparently, the bill has been amended to get one of the Democrat "no" votes to flip.
Tony Clemenson from the City of Clive was here.  He gave good data on how this will raise costs for the taxpayers.
Tim Hurley, mayor of Waterloo and Chairman of the Iowa League of Cities stands in opposition of the bill.
Andy Warren, State Director for NFIB explained how this bill will cost Iowa jobs.
Heather Perry from Allegro Custom Homes made a good defense of the value of non-union labor.  http://www.allegrocustomhomes.com/index.php
Rick Olson and Lance Horbach have left the rostrum, and turned the chair over the Nate Willems.
There seems to be a common notion that non-union labor results in "substandard" services.  I'll bet many would disagree..
A carpenter from Cedar Rapids wants to apply the standard "do no harm."  I agree.
We're hearing plenty of arguments on how this bill is good for the wages of those lucky to hold the union jobs, but not how it helps Iowa.
I was expecting a lot more people to be here tonight.  We're scheduled for 50 speakers, but the room is subdued.
Open legislative forum tonight on prevailing wage.  730 in the House chamber.
