I agree w/ Canadian PM Stephen Harper that Keystone is in both our nations’ interest and that “the logic here is overwhelming.” #TimeToBuild
Keystone supported by both biz &amp; labor, including my own union the Operating Engineers. It's time for Americans to earn these paychecks.
Obama Administration admits that Keystone will create thousands of construction jobs. We're talking about real men and women's livelihoods.
The President's own State Department says Keystone would have a minimal impact on the environment. It's #TimeToBuild the pipeline #4jobs.
Pipelines are single safest way to transport liquids–safer than by rail or truck. It's #TimeToBuild Keystone #4jobs &amp; national security.
Keystone XL will create thousands of jobs. By their nature, construction jobs are temporary. It's insulting for Admin to marginalize them.

Trucking is the lifeblood of our economy. Hours of Service rule will cost $376 million annually, decrease productivity &amp; likely cost jobs.
In @SmallBizGOP we're hearing directly from truckers &amp; #SmallBiz about how their lives and income are being impacted by new #HOS rules.
Tune in here for live @SmallBizGOP #HOS hearing http://t.co/yXEO6sQ4gx. http://t.co/6NpzBUI6GC
It's clear to me is that new #HOS rule is a philosophy, an ideology, not a viable solution to a problem. @smallbizgop @transport
This #HOS rule may cause economic harm &amp; make our roads less - safe pushing truckers on the road during busy commutes &amp; school rush hour.
Small businesses, workers, consumers have raised serious concerns that the #HOS rule went into effect without being backed by solid data
