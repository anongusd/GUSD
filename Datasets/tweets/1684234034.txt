Susan Collins tells @burgessev she will vote yes on the continuing resolution, in addition to voting for Trump-backed bill. "The shutdown is so extraordinarily unfair," she said. "I'll vote yes and yes" https://t.co/XiYQNW76dE
Trump-backed bill to provide$5.7B for a border wall and give temporary protection to some undocumented immigrants is also slated to fail. 	"Our leadership is strongly encouraging us to set off a negotiation by having both go down so that it forces a negotiation,‚Äù a GOP sen said.
