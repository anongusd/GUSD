I care more than you know. As I mentioned on @dailybriefing proper vetting must also be in place as part of a compromise bill to ensure children are not left in the wrong hands. The Presidents Executive Order addresses this whjch I tweeted earlier. Try reading it. https://t.co/1tp1B73393
Yes, I do realize this. I also realize many of these mothers are victims of rape and physical abuse and are seeking to protect their offspring from suffering the same injustice. https://t.co/1oOgnTgkpa
False. The law states the application of civil penalties does not preclude application of criminal ones, it also does not compel federal prosecutors to pursue both. Until the zero policy change, civil proceedings were the usual approach in case of families w/minor children. https://t.co/dQSA9OUtpI

That‚Äôs why we need to secure our borders while handling those who have entered illegally, humanely. Especially the unknowing and innocent children. Asylum seekers know no bounds when trying to escape dangerous conditions. Also, improve vetting process for those seeking asylum. https://t.co/XvDjFm5yqP
Agreed. https://t.co/Hz8n8fgEti
Good question. Many are escaping abhorrent living conditions, physical abuse and 3rd world country type surroundings. Rather than seek asylum legally for fear of being turned away at a port of entry many desperate families will stop at nothing to seek a safe place. https://t.co/ZzrEEZ1ZLH
Yes, because many of them didn‚Äôt meet the medical criteria to enter the United States. That was over 100 years ago.

The Las Vegas shooter modified a dozen rifles to shoot like automatic weapons. A modified rifle with the bump fire mechanism includes a high-capacity magazine that can hold between 60 and 100 rounds. This is very relevant. https://t.co/XgNzU992Hi
This is me flipping to full auto. The average civilian can‚Äôt get this weapon used only by law enforcement and military but converting a semi to auto is too easy. Hence the bump stock used by Vegas shooter. If you‚Äôre going to shoot even a semi you should get the proper training. https://t.co/GbdGJbxkWG

Look at Paris, Charlie Hebdo. The officer was executed on the street with an AK. His 9mm didn't cut it. If they hadn't have been able to obtain an assault weapon, would they have been so brazen? Does the public want police to be outgunned when police respond to PROTECT us?
A police officer in NYC carries 16 rounds semi-automatic in their firearm, without reloading. Look at L.A. Officers were presented with assault weapons and had to run for cover. Would you want to face 30 rounds fully automatic with your pea shooter?
...we need to clarify ownership requirements. The aim is not to limit magazine capacity, more to limit the wrong finger on the trigger. The point, clearly missed by those who would miss 30 rounds, is 30 rounds in the wrong hands is 20 too many. 20 lives count. https://t.co/KXWwfb8rf1
