@jpcoolican @Nate_Cohn But the people who control money used to define your opponent might choose to pull out bc of polls, and they sure did, and many people have lost bc of that.
It was not dead on, it was a thought experiment and it was malpractice. It changed the trajectory of this race in a way that is irresponsible for a news organization to do. @Nate_Cohn and the team over at NYT fired a torpedo at us during a pivotal week in this race. #MN08 https://t.co/2NgGCQwqzc

@PeteStauber Were you emailing the @NRCC about production notes for this, @PeteStauber? Why not just be honest and tell us? Is it because it's much worse than that?

We should all be outraged that billionaires who don't even live in MN, let alone #MN08, can step in to flood the airwaves with millions in false attacks, smear our candidates for office, weaken faith in our democracy &amp; corrupt the result. @PeteStauber is already corrupt.
I'm not surprised by how much money from out-of-state billionaires is being spent on attacks in #MN08 (almost completely against @joeradinovich). We always knew this would be an $$$ fight. 		What disturbs me is how proud Republicans are of this- of big money buying this seat.

On @realDonaldTrump, Pete Stauber says "There's no perfect human being." That, is an understatement. #BrainerdDebate #MN08 @PeteStauber
Since the 1st debate, not much has changed. @PeteStauber has no ideas on how to expand access to healthcare for more Americans. He's pretty much a dead end street when it comes to healthcare policy. A real bummer. #BrainerdDebate #MN08
The #BrainerdDebate begins and @PeteStauber displays his ignorance as to how Obama's trade actions against Chinese steel dumping put every miner who was laid off back to work before President Trump had even taken office. #MN08
The introductions start and @PeteStauber starts lying right out of the gate, claiming that he's the only one getting attacked with negative ads. FYI, Pete's Washington buddies spent over a million dollars JUST LAST WEEK attacking Joe @joeradinovich. Not a good look, Pete. #mn08

Meanwhile, I don't need a fact-checker to tell you that @PeteStauber's lack of a plan will put the lives of thousands of 8th District residents at risk. When you can't access healthcare, you are far more likely to die. #facts #MN08 https://t.co/zgyUJnWzOt
It's pretty hard to have a "patient-driven" healthcare system when you want to deny health insurance coverage for almost 300,000 people in #mn08 with pre-existing conditions. How does a patient that would get denied coverage under you and the President's plan "drive" their care? https://t.co/lLGGNGFANe
President Trump, who @PeteStauber has chained himself to, used Chinese steel to build his developments at the same time he was using foriegn labor and not paying contractors for work done. So who's the bad actor here? Because it sure sounds like the man we have in the Whitehouse.
By the time we'd been through 8 years of Obama's economy employment had grown, unemployment numbers decreased by approx 50%, and his trade actions on illegal steel dumping were opening mines back up to make American steel. However, it's worth noting...

@PeteStauber In fact, when Obama's chief of staff was sent to the Range to see how he could help, mining and steel executives called it "the day that changed everything". His tariffs on imports of steel products and crack down on illegal dumping turned everything around and got folks working.

@ImSchultz @BarackObama You can take issue with presidents injecting politics into regulatory process, &amp; @joeradinovich would agree with you, but you can't argue with the CEO's of mining companies when they say that the day Obama's Chief of Staff came to the Range was "the day that changed everything."
@ImSchultz @BarackObama The biggest economic recession since the Great Depression didn't start under Barack Obama, Isaac. This country was bleeding 750,000 jobs a month when he was sworn in. But he was there to steer the ship to get us though and start the longest period of economic expansion in history
Republicans have proven they don't understand trade policy, but it's important to remember that the historic tariffs imposed by @BarackObama's administration saved thousands of mining jobs on the Iron Range. Cliffs CEO Lourenco Conclaves credits his action directly. #MN08 https://t.co/9xGjp7eQpc

@JGeorge49 @RwGinsberg I was pretty green in 2013, but I was around and to say that our DFL members did nothing to fund transportation with the new revenue they created is just not true. We shouldn't have to fire teachers and close nursing homes as the price for maintaining current roads.
Please come back https://t.co/upTgL09vum
@RwGinsberg @JGeorge49 We wouldn't have a dime to put toward transpo right now had our DFL majority in 2013 not had the courage to lead and fix our general fund deficit. And yes, we could only put out a few big fires that session, but the work never ends. Someone should tell GOP to find some courage.

12/12 Long story short - @USRepRickNolan has a huge heart for people. All people. People in challenging circumstances, people fighting oppression, people who haven’t been dealt a fair hand. He’s not in it for the power, he’s in it to help people, &amp; man, could we use more of that
11/12 We drove toward where he knew a place in town, and the passenger said to me “I bet you must think I’m pretty impressed that I got a ride from a Congressman, but guess who picked me up when I was in Menominee? @Aaronrodgers12. That guy wouldn’t shut up about himself.”
10/12 Our passenger couldn’t disagree with that, and he was pretty quiet for the rest of the drive. Instead of staffing @USRepRickNolan at his event in Grand Rapids, Rick gave this man some starting money and asked me to drive him wherever he wanted to go (I’m thinking “Great!”)
9/12 “You’re not my constituent,” Rick said, “but every day I’m fighting for people like you- people who landed on hard times through no fault of their own, people who need a hand up, who need training for a new job, who are just looking for a little dignity. That’s a Democrat."
8/12 Rick took the opportunity - “Democrats care about helping people when they’re down. We care about a strong safety net to help lift everyone into the middle class. We fight the greed that would let children die &amp; seniors starve &amp; poor people go without health insurance...”
7/12 “Well, I’m the Congressman for this part of the country,” Rick said, “But I spent 32 years in business myself.” Our passenger got real quiet, then “You a Republican or a Democrat?” and Rick asked him to take a guess. “I guess I’d say you’re a Republican”. - Wrong answer
6/12 Rick Nolan, always on the hunt for jobs for his people, asked what line of work this guy was in – “flooring, but I had to stop because my body is shot”. It wasn’t until after we had talked about several types of hardwood flooring that the hitchhiker asked “How bout you?”…

4/12 Now mind you, he had other things he was supposed to be doing while we were driving (phone calls, press calls, letter signing, etc), but we pulled over, cleared off the back seat of his Impala &amp; invited a total stranger to ride along with us to Grand Rapids. Rick spent the…
3/12 We drove up on a guy with his thumb up on the side of Hwy 2 at the edge of town. As I increased to highway speed, Rick told me to pull over. I said “What?!” and I thought “Are you insane?!” but @USRepRickNolan simply said “Looks like a hardworking guy who could use a ride"..
2/12 I was driving @USRepRickNolan from Duluth to Grand Rapids one August day in 2016 as we were doing a media blitz regarding the endorsement of his campaign by the Nat'l Committee to Preserve Social Security &amp; Medicare (@NCPSSM). After filling the tank in Floodwood, MN...
