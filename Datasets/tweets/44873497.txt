I'll be rooting for &amp; working hard alongside everyone who believes in an excellent education for all students. You can find me at @JohnBKing
If we nurture students' minds &amp; hearts &amp; ensure they are safe &amp; welcomed in school--no matter who they are--our country's future is strong
My challenge to everyone working on behalf of students: lead by example, through education &amp; hope. Be steadfast in our commitment to equity.
My life is proof of the transformative power of a great education--NYC public school teachers saved my life and gave me hope.
We've worked to protect students’ civil rights &amp; advocate for our most vulnerable. There's a lot to be proud of, but there's much left to do
More students have access to #edtech in schools to personalize &amp; transform learning, giving them tools to succeed in the 21st century.
We've worked to expand college affordability, access &amp; completion. A million more Af-Am &amp; Latino students are enrolled in college since 2008
The US has made great progress in education. More students are graduating from high school today than ever before.
I'm grateful to all of you: teachers, parents, school leaders, mentors, advocates. You are a critical part of this work.
As we close this chapter of history and we prepare to embark on our next journey, I'd like to take the chance to say thank you.
We have much to learn frm colleges serving socioeconomically diverse stdnts &amp; providing real pathways to opportunity https://t.co/sjb9bpgZoc
