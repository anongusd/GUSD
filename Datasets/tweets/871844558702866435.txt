@jaketapper @WSJ We are left only with our humor as we see people who are so embedded into their political philosophy finally come about on the issue of debt (when they said nothing before). The fear is, of course, that their position remains purely political.

@FilmCriticOne @RepLoudermilk Anyone who defends the current tax system in this country is a fool. By that logic, my friend, ...
Their power over you is not as complete as they would like. They want complete subservience and control. You are simply their workers for the wealth they extract for themselves.
This is the idea behind @RepAdamSchiff and the rest of @TheDemocrats . To sell us a bill of goods - protection from all the hardships of life at the cost of every ounce of our freedom. So when any of them say "rule of law" understand what they really mean.
"Human Rights" would be grants given to people by government of one form or another. Rights that could just as easily be taken away. SO by definition, they are not "rights" at all but sweet nectar of the pitcher plant that consumes its customers.
Not surprisingly, these are all put under the penumbra of "Human Rights." A feel good sounding term with the most evil intent. First, no one can actually define what a human right is. Unlike the Bill of Rights, so-called Human Rights are not inalienable. ...
Which begs the question, why are they doing this to us? The end goal can only be satisfactorily explained as their attempt to have supreme control over all of us. Control our income, our healthcare, our food, our water, and our housing. Not surprisingly these are ...
... it is continually having to be bailed out from collapse. The "Affordable" Care Act quickly proved to be unaffordable for everyone who had to pay (yet it was mandatory). All of these "laws" are, by the defining document (Constitution), unconstitutional.
As we found out with the ACA (obamacare) they added yet another tax. All of this taxation was sold to us as a benefit. We know, or should know, that it was all lies. Social Security is not a savings plan but a tax to the general fund and which is so poorly managed ...
They created social security, which would in later years be expanded, which was a disguised 7.5% additional income tax to individuals (us) and they sold it to us as a "retirement plan." They also added a payroll tax on employers that added another 7.5% tax on them.
The meddling was completely beyond the original powers given to the federal government by the Constitution. The misery they caused was their excuse to go further. Social programs by the federal government (completely unconstitutional) were implemented.
Despite what we have been taught, the great depression (just like Obama's great recession) was exasperated by the meddling federal government held by the Democrats. They extended the time of misery for their own assumption of power (history notes that the republicans did nothing)
With the 17th Amendment (destruction of federalism) and the 16th (Income taxation) the federal government assumed total power over the people. No one stood in their way. All the left needed was an excuse to use it. Enter the Great Depression and WWII.
They (and republicans too) revel in this power. A power to the point where federalism disappears. Even the states cower to this power - which was never supposed to happen either. But the 17th amendment turned Senators into 6-year representatives and diminished state authority.
Today, people like @RepAdamSchiff use the Supreme court for de facto constitutional amendments via the power to "interpret" the Constitution - A power never given to that court. Hence, @TheDemocrats consternation over who is appointed to that court.
The Constitution restricted the powers of the federal government to very specific areas. Trade, interstate commerce (today also twisted out of control), and defense. The Supreme court was restricted to dealing with issues between the states.
The best example of this is the ascendency of Obama, Reid, and Pelosi between 2009 and 2017. During that period our entire country was held hostage to their destructive whims. This was never supposed to happen.
We do because they have destroyed the concept of The Rule of Law. They have twisted the powers given to the Federal govt to a point when a few people can bring devastating consequences to every american life. ...
This and the rest of @TheDemocrats have no concept of "the Rule of Law." Otherwise, we wouldn't know their names. Contemplate why we are in such dire circumstances today. Why do we fear the democrats having control of the federal government. We shouldn't but ... https://t.co/Hgkma3C4OX

They will kill for their power. They will kill you for their power. History points this out very clearly. Be ready. Prepare. We may all be called upon to protect our republic and our freedoms from the left.
The left even subverts the basic freedom we share. The right to vote. They block any legislation to protect this. They register the dead, non-citizens, and pass laws to make this subversion easier. They care not about the people. They only care about they power.
Liberty and free enterprise are the two core tenets of our society. The politicians on the left have taken govt power and used it to corrupt our youth making them believe in the almighty power of govt rather than the power of themselves.
Oppression by the government was something the founders knew a lot about. That is why we have the second amendment. Not to hunt or defend ourselves from common criminals. Not to turn our country into an oppressive #socialist state. To throw off any attempt by govt to oppress us.
The United States has an amazing history. No worse than any other countries history and much better than all others. Because this is the first country to put the individual ahead of the govt. #socialism changes all that around. Soon we will be no better off.

It is not a stretch to assume that this will not end without a violent counter reaction which will induce the government to "intervene." Whoever is in power at that time wins. The rest of us, our children, and their children will lose.
Look at @SenSanders @BernieSanders he already attacks free business trying to force his political agenda on them. @RepMaxineWaters calls for outright fighting against people who disagree. #Antifa, the misnomer group of children, physically assault people.
The left will have no qualms imprisoning millions of Americans, using them in labor camps, and working them to death, if they are people who are against the left's political control.
The NSA has been turned into an agency that tracks every American every minute of the day. The FBI has been turned into a political national police force. All that's missing is an article 58 style law (soviet union) that criminalizes any form of dissent.
What? Yes, but I'm not talking "murder" in the sense that we understand. They have already been comfortable sending govt agencies after the innocent. Some have been killed, others imprisoned. "Murder" for the political class comes under the false legitimacy of political power.
People like @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenWarren et al. are no less dangerous than people like Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot were. They have already shown their willingness to lie for the power they want. It is not a leap that they will murder for it.
The left's continual quest to divide American's through hate and prejudice, through victimhood, through false promises of free stuff for all, is simply a means for the political left to secure power.
The "resistance" is using every means to get more votes, open borders, no #VoterID, Motor Voter legislation, immediate restoration of rights for felons, etc.
But the right's use of it will not be out of some childish idea that "we deserve what we want" childish attitude that seems to be the left's purpose. The right will not scream and cry that they lost. They will know that the reason they lost was due to illegitimacy.
With this turn of tactics, i.e., resistance, by the left, it is not a hard concept to believe the right won't use it either. Somehow the "hurt" generation may be our downfall. https://t.co/MGPAh6PGlv

Now is the inflection point. Do we change history or do we allow the left to put us into several generations of darkness, horror, and fear?
It is very hard for the right to do this because it goes against principle. Our idea of freedom and to allow people to live their lives as they choose. However, history has shown that these types of movements always come to dominate the good when the good can no longer resist.
To be clear, this movement is not going away and we on the right should be very afraid. We should be so afraid we realize that the only path to follow is the one we consider to be the last resort. But we cannot wait any longer. We have to strike when we still have resolve.
...only life skill has been manipulating people. The people that follow him are either full-on sociopaths or what I call soft sociopaths. They can rationalize the destruction of other people's lives for their own perceived goals. it does not matter to them.
...to shoot up schools is buried. This is indicative of their lying personalities. This is what makes the ability to kill millions of "non-believers" rational. These people are led by sociopaths. @BernieSanders is a classic example. Here is a person who...
They divide us by race, gender, and mental abilities (by calling people names). You are a racist, a misogynist, a criminal - and when true, so be it, but they never call themselves out. A school shooting is a reason for "gun control." Muslims training kids ...
They wanted Obamacare but really they wanted single-payer (as they are pressing now). It's called taking soft steps. They inch closer and closer to their goals so that we don't see it coming. One disastrous program is fixed by another disastrous program.
The left will and has lied about all this. They call themselves Democrats, then Liberals (a bastardization of the word), now Progressives (a term used by communists). They want gun bans, common sense gun control, but really, they want you guns.
The left want a single payer healthcare system (so get your elective health issues taken care of now). The left wants your guns - they want you powerless to stop their oppressive ideas. The left wants communism - so make your plans now about your financial future...
The problem is good people typically do not want to hurt others, we believe in the rule that everyone is equal under the law, we believe in our system - and it is hard to convince us that things have changed. But bad times are coming.
The left cares not about people, only about power. It takes the ridiculous and makes it mainstream. It destroys God and morals because they have no morals. Give them an inch and they take a mile. These people are dangerous and good people must stop them.
They will destroy people to "make them go away." This is evident in the Mueller Russia collusion probe - which has reopened a 2014 case to destroy a person, has strong armed several others to admit to crimes (even though none of this points to collusion).
They will lie, cheat, and steal to get their way. This is what makes the left so dangerous and allows the murder of millions of people. The left will defend their goals even in overwhelming facts that show it as a disaster, e.g., ACA a/k/a obamacare.
The biggest hurdle the right, the true right, must overcome is the understanding that we are honest and will remain so. We will consider facts and debate them and allow ourselves to be swayed. However, the left has no compunction to be honest.

@TheDemocrats Or, in the case of the democratic party, give it away...
Today we must fight, first with words and actions and finally with violence. It is our right to determine our own future when those that govern us begin to oppress us. It is our right to seek a better form of government that believes and is established on liberty.
The chance to reverse this now is very slim but not completely extinguished. However, the peaceful method of voting has been corrupted to the point that it is embarrassing. No election is pure anymore. Today we must fight.
The parties are pure evil running the most violent creation man has ever invented, government. An invention capable of killing, by work, starvation, or bludgeoning, the people by the tens of millions. They have blinded us and now they plan on ruling over us permanently.
They have convinced our children to believe in a false history, to believe in racism, bigotry, and violence. They have stolen our heritage and replaced it with one of pure greed and evil. They have lied to our children and turned them against us.
They have convinced our children into hating their parents, their grandparents, and their grandparent's parents. They have blinded them into a godless world of bureaucratic worship and the false god of "free stuff".
They know that they fit the bill. They are our oppressors and they fear a popular uprising. So they have convinced an entire generation of their benevolence and the selfishness of their fellow man. They have mislead our children into hating the prior generations.
They have figured out how to steal all our wealth and become rich and powerful from it. This was never the plan. Now they know that the only thing left to overcome is the 2nd Amendment. That Amendment that allows us to violently remove our oppressors.
Nothing passed over the last 118 years has been a benefit to us as much as it has to them. Social Security is a tax, ACA is a tax, Medicare is a tax, income is a tax. They have figured out how to take all our wealth.
Today the masks are off. The left are clearly communists. They flaunt it. The issue of gun control is really confiscation. They are trying to consolidate their power and make in unassailable. They want to rule over us. Make us work and steal our wealth.
This is for both sides of the "aisle." Neither party has the U. States as their priority. This is obvious by the uncontrolled spending of our future wealth, the clearly unconstitutional laws that are passed, the ever growing gathering of power.
The classic Stalin phrase of "useful idiots" is appropriate. People who actually believe politicians which unrelenting history shows have never told the truth. Blind faith in false prophets of [enter your cause here] that promise the world and always deliver nothing.
Our representatives don't represent us. They represent their party affiliation. They don't care about the collateral damage caused by their crimes. The deaths. To them, it is all propaganda to be used to further "their" cause.
...against the citizens of the U. States. This includes the threat of false charges and imprisonment, the harrassment, and the murder of citizens who do not comply. You must realize that nothing is below their dignity in order to keep power.
More to the point, the 2016 election has exposed this deep deep corruption that now is pervasive within our government. Agencies welding extreme power have been exposed as rogue agencies willing to be manipulated by politics and willing to commit heinous crimes ...
The Rule of Law, touted by both parties, is but a catch phrase for them. Neither believe in it or follow it. This is evident by the fact that the ACA specifically excluded them and federal workers, and despite rhetoric, remains the law.
Today we witness in the U. States the manifestation of pure unrelenting evil that is government spun out-of-control. We have people in our government - we will call them the politicians (regardless of affiliation) - that care more about self gain than country.

...to the fire for some politicians anyway. Hey, they aint there just to collect a measly $125G/yr. So Ken Starr adjusted his field of fire and started blasting away. That's the power prosecutors have. They can charge anyone with anything and their only burden is...
It took several years and millions of tax-payer dollars (but no one in DC cares much about tax-payers anymore) and it hit the target a few rows over. That was fine enough. So long as it hit a target, it was justified. The land deal was probably a little too close...
The police state wins again. The power of the prosecution unleashed. Had not a special counsel been appointed we would have never known about Monica Lewinski's liason with President Clinton. An investigation, supposedly, looking into the misdealings of a land deal.

@AhlstrandJacob @EArubuike @npnthr @nytimes Sure, if you take things out of context you may be befuddled. You should study this time in history because a lot of people died on the slavery issue which included secession.
@AhlstrandJacob @EArubuike @npnthr @nytimes Because you think so does not make it so. Read some history. True that the Republican platform included the ending of slavery. However, it was when A Lincoln was elected that South seceded and started war of secession. Also see Emancipation Proclamation 1863 (Wikipedia)
@AhlstrandJacob @EArubuike @npnthr @nytimes You‚Äôre missing the point. The North attacked the South only after they seceded - not because slavery was outlawed and they refused to obey.
@AtHomeInBk @AhlstrandJacob @npnthr @nytimes That‚Äôs the first time I heard that.
@AhlstrandJacob @EArubuike @npnthr @nytimes The issue was about secession. Not until Abraham Lincoln (R) issued his emancipation proclamation in 1863 did it become about ending slavery.

Yes, free stuff sounds great. Until they run out of rich people to fleece. Then the free stuff gets rationed until it goes away and all you are left with is an oppressive well armed government that has no qualms about murdering its own people, because - hey, socialism üëç.
A free market, capitalist society where you are free to be poor or rich. Free to drink a latte and lounge with your friends. Free to express your feelings. All that nonsense goes away under socialism. No one complains. Everybody works for the cause.
The first act of a tyrant is to get rid of all opposition. If that new leader is doing things you don‚Äôt like, it‚Äôs not him that will be removed. Don‚Äôt worry. People are killed under socialism. People disappear. It a kinder gentler way of doing things. So much better than ...
Oh, and if you are a good wannabe socialist now that believes in the utopia of an all powerful benevolent govt, don‚Äôt worry - someone will come along and take that power down the dark and horrific street of oppression. But that‚Äôs ok. Your disarmed. The govt will protect you.
When the govt needs workers, volunteer workers, for whatever reason, be happy to jump to the cause. You won‚Äôt have a choice so you might as well smile when you are in the muddy ditch cleaning up a sewer break. But hey, your college is paid for.
Everyone can‚Äôt be college educated in a socialist society. Maybe the govt let‚Äôs you go to college, maybe not. Regardless, everyone is a worker ina socialist society. So while you are in college, make sure you keep your grades up, a good socialist doesn‚Äôt party at the govt expense
What the @SenSanders of the world don‚Äôt tell you about socialism and all the free stuff paid for by the ‚Äúrich.‚Äù Nothing is free. And even if you think the rich will pay for everything for you - you still have to pay. Remember, socialism is a ‚Äúworkers‚Äù party.

We would not be drugging our kids to ‚Äúsettle them down.‚Äù We would not be reducing subjects they learn. We would not be abandoning physical education and music to teach remedial English. We use to teach Latin in grade school BEFORE public schools. Now the left ...
If we taught our children about gun safety, we would not have so much gun violence. But the left wants to take away this right of ours because an armed populace is a foe to oppressive government. If we stopped taking the easy route when it comes to our children ...
The left has bankrupted the United States. Social security has been robbed by the left. And instead of teaching our youth about investing, they teach them to hate Wall Street. If we did teach investing, within 3 generations no one would need to receive social security benefits.
This is easily disproved by history found in hundreds of books, journals, and other studies. However, although we live in the Information Age, the indoctrinated young are ironically ignorant. It is easier to vote for free stuff than to work for it.
However, slavery abounds in the left‚Äôs socialist system which they want to oppress everyone with. They use the term ‚Äúfree‚Äù for everything to entice the indoctrinated fools into believing that the left offers a posh alternative lifestyle devoid of effort.
Free market capitalism must be made out to be evil. Freedom has to be made out to be evil. Only the government can provide your lifestyle without having to be a slave to rich masters. Of course, this is all false. Nothing in a free market system comes close to slavery...
First they have to foment jealousy which leads to hate. Hate the rich. They have to provide assistance - government assistance - and say it is good. Then they have to deride the economic system that has been the catalyst for scientific progress over the last 200 years.
We are divided today because the left has endeavored to make us poor and dependent on government. Their government. To do this they have to first use the education system to indoctrinate us. They have done this to the last 2 generations.

Ghost Guns = Freedom Guns and the left and establishment right know this. They don‚Äôt want them because that means they can never be completely safe - and that‚Äôs the point. I guarantee these oppressors will want everyone to register their 3-D printers next.

@SenBlumenthal Too late. These ‚Äúghost‚Äù guns will be called ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù guns if you ever decide to oppress us more.
@SenSanders If the government got out of healthcare it would save this country all the money.
@SenWarren Hopefully these plans stay available so when the left takes our guns and oppresses is we will have the means to fight back.
@SenWarren Communists: ‚ÄúAny gun control is good gun control.‚Äù In order to succeed in our violent revolution we must have as little resistance as possible. Since only a fraction of people are idiots and believe in this crap, we need to have the power to oppress them.
@SenWarren Liz, just in case you missed it. Jobs are up, economy is booming. We have to fix all the disasters under the obama administration too. Soon, wages will be rising. I know you don‚Äôt want to but give it a chance.

The deep state is working on framing Trump with any thing they can make up. They need to regain control so that the rest of their corruption is not exposed. Once he is gone they will be protected and continue their mass surveillance.
The 2018 election. They hope to fix any oversites with election fraud this year and expect the democrats to regain the Congress. The republican establishment is complicit in this effort. This is why subpoenas can go unanswered for over a year without rebuke.
The deep state is a direct consequence of the globalist agenda. Trump was not suppose to win. Despite massive voter fraud the unexpected happened. Trump won. Now they are scrambling. Refusing to disclose evidence of their corruption. Biding their time until after...
An all out ban is the only solution. Once the masses are disarmed (there will still be criminals with weapons) then govt will have complete power. Democracy will be based on disinformation and fraud. Govt leaders will continue to appear legitimate.
A vast working class has to be established. Gun control (prohibitions against gun ownership by the individual) has to be implemented with ever more restrictions and higher penalties. In order to achieve this gun ‚Äúincidences‚Äù have to increase until the masses believe...
All problematic regimes. Open borders are also part of the plan. It is necessary to reduce national identity while at the same time lowering standards of living. Increasing dependency on govt not only increases govt power, it simultaneously decreases individual liberty.
This allowed the US to begin military operations in Afghanistan. Then Iraq. Then, despite liberal opposition to the wars under Bush, wars were expanded under Obama. Libya, Yemen, Congo, and Syria. Clandestine operations in Ukraine. The globalists has to isolate ...
The 9/11 attacks were coordinated with parts of the US govt. Despite all air traffic being grounded, Saudi conspirators were allowed to fly out. Within 60 days a documentary was out explaining why the towers collapsed the way they did. All in an effort to reduce suspicion.
The war on terror is actually a terror war on us. It has allowed the impetus to destroy all civil rights and has allowed the govt to use surveillance at unprecedented levels. It is the first step in convincing us to give up everything for an all powerful ‚Äúprotector.‚Äù

Turn the fear around. Make them afraid. Make them fear the shadows. Be like ghosts. Smile. Be ready. The time is coming if Trump fails, if we fail. The left will crush is with their oppression. We have to be ready. We have to fight back.
Find out where government storage facilities are located. Don‚Äôt think that the military or the police will be on our side. History clearly shows that never happens. We will need to fight a guerrilla war. Handguns are the future weapon of choice. Blend in. Be stealthy.
But powerful forces are against us. Today we are learning that our own govt is against us. The FBI, DOJ, IRS have all been used to oppress us. They are weaponizing and storing ammo. They are preparing for putting down all resistance by any means.
You need to do more than prep. You need to organize. Buy guns but also develop teams. Know what to do when it begins. Try to prevent it by getting involved. Know who your friends are. Know who your enemies are. Desperate times are heading our way unless we drain the swamp ...
With what senior Bush agreed to, Clinton began, W continued, and Obama implemented. If you felt poorer under obama it was for a reason - that was the plan. Trump screwed things up. He gives individuals hope. That is not what the globalists want.
It is a global robbery and the political left and establishment right in the country are coconspirators. They are selling us out (and getting wealthy for doing it). They do not give a rats ass about America or you. Hillary was suppose to be president to carry on ...
Climate change is a lie to institute a global tax. It will be substantially high for the US because we are deemed the biggest polluters. We are not. We are the leading clean energy country in the world. The tax really isn‚Äôt about climate. It is about making the US poor.
The 21st century agenda of the UN and 178 countries is to beat down the prosperity of the US, to move us all into sustainable, mixed use, urban centers. There we can work for our wages. Travel will be curtailed and wealth will be redistributed to poorer nations.

@JacksonLeeTX18 I don‚Äôt. Your made-up statistics have been shattered.
The carnage will be horrific and will take several decades for the population to reduce and the stagnant technology of control to deteriorate to the point when the remaining people will have the strength to fight back.
There has to be a culling of idiots to the tune of 5 billion people. Under the political system the communists envision, this reduction will be naturally occurring. People will die from epidemics, slave labor, political killings.
For the mass of idiots that exist, this lifestyle will suit them because they cannot think for themselves. However, as the global population drops below 2 billion, the statistics will change. Unfortunately, to get to the point where people fight for freedom again...
In the end, people‚Äôs lives will be dependent on political hacks who cannot even boil an egg. They will make decisions that effect everyone but themselves. There decisions will be whatever sounds good and damned be the people who fail to fulfill them.
This has already been outlined by the United Nations, a global communist entity. Once everyone is urbanized the state will oversee every aspect of global concern. This will lead to disasters on a scale unheard of before. Only the super rich will have freedom of travel.
The plan is to eliminate all resistance. Once in urban areas people will become dependent on officials and state agencies. Crime is higher and authoritarian control can be accepted because self defense will be outlawed. Everyone will have to bow down to the state.
Democrat mayors are incorporating communist doctrine within their cities employees. The Democrats understand their power lies in urban centers. This is why taxes are being raised on suburban and rural properties. The idea is to drive people into the cities.

They surreptitiously fund communist organizations through layers of bureaucracy. They seek only one thing - total control of a $4T annual budget. It is their lottery ticket to absolute power and they will do anything to maintain it.
They have no concern over killing American citizens. They have no concern destroying Americans by use of criminal investigations and litigation. They have no qualms over destroying companies through excessive and unwarranted fines.
This is classic #Communism . @TheDemocrats are communists. They have weaponized the government agencies against the people. The #FBI #DOJ #IRS have all been armed to the teeth and they point their guns at us. Even the #BLM is militarized.
They passed the #ACA and despite its name caused health insurance rates to skyrocket. Despite continuing price hikes they don‚Äôt want to end it. Their entire goal is to destroy prosperity. To control your life. To end all chances of individual success.
@TheDemocrats forced us into Social Security. Promised us a retirement fund. Then robbed it and emptied it turning it into a ponzu scheme. Then they blame everyone else but themselves for its failure. Now they want to maintain their grip on healthcare.

@MARCOPEDROSOJR @tonycamatto @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders I trust companies. And the great thing - if I ever I trust them I can walk away. Try that with government. Especially a socialist government.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @tonycamatto @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Boy, you sure did buy that hook, line, and sinker. You think corporations are bad?

@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Yeah, I want to destroy this place. Good one. I didn‚Äôt think you were bright.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders I paid my way through school by enlisting. I became a lawyer. I prosecuted juveniles. There I realized the horror of the welfare system. How it destroys families and condemns children to a life of poverty. I don‚Äôt really give a fuck about you or what you think.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @tonycamatto @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders So does freedom. Do we have perfect freedom here? No, but it is better than any other country, well - for a while at least. Until lies become the norm and idiots rule over us. See Maxine Waters.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tonycamatto @tomsmusicplace @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Socialism and communism are political ideologies. Capitalism is an economic system. Look at ‚Äúyour leaders?‚Äù They are whacked. You want to give them centralized power over the most powerful country on Earth. Sorry. I‚Äôm laughing now.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Oops. I hit on a sore point for you. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm positive I have a lot more real whole experience than you. For one, I see reality a bit better than you. Anyway, I don‚Äôt want to distress you any longer. Enjoy, Flower.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Lol, the conversation has to end when you start beating the worn out drum of Scandinavian socialism. Hey, here is an idea, move to Sweden and live the dream.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders I have never walked in their shoes. I avoided having to with all my effort. I know you don‚Äôt do any of what I suggested because I know people like you too.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders All the people I know like that were successful. I think you and I knew exactly who we are talking about. They didn‚Äôt finish school to work. They quit to sell drugs or got pregnant at 14. You can try and sugar coat reality as much as you want but you cannot hide it.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Yes, I‚Äôm the terrible person. Of course I follow my beliefs. You on the other just talk. Go volunteer. Spend your time trying to help these people. Go walk on their shoes. Deliver food door to door. Practice what you preach and stop requiring others to do as you believe.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Part of your warped view is the belief that their is a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù out there that helps people. Welfare, on its fifth generation of perpetual poverty. HUD, building and maintaining ghettos for 50 odd years. Stop encouraging dependency and start pushing freedom.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Income won‚Äôt change people. Pay them more and they we go deeper into debt and complain for more. Why don‚Äôt we educate our children  in solid societal principles, job skills, how to invest, self reliance? Hard times hit everyone, most don‚Äôt ask for handouts.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Shouldn‚Äôt people be responsible for themselves? Why should everyone else be responsible? There are tons of grants, scholarships, opportunities for people in need. Now we have to support them when they won‚Äôt support themselves. Sounds cold but it works.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Again, someone else (probably with a recent economics degree) who can‚Äôt figure economics. Labor is a commodity (also know as freedom). Otherwise it is a punishment (forced labor). If you are in a job a monkey can do, don‚Äôt expect the salary of a mechanic (skills- see what I did)
@peranghx @mybibelottweets @SenSanders Yes they do. A program created not so much for hungry people as much for farmers. How about this, find a job that pays you more and stop crying.
@mybibelottweets @peranghx @SenSanders You may not mind but unfortunately you include everyone when you talk about taxes. How about stepping up and taking your own money and giving it to a charity? You know, not being a selfish arse and putting your money where your mouth is.
@peranghx @mybibelottweets @SenSanders Labor is a commodity whose price is fixed based on supply and demand. If we truly invested in education rather than welfare people would be able to enhance the value of their labor. Stop me if this is over your head.
@SenSanders You do realize Bernie pays an intern over $100K a year to tweet for him. Now that‚Äôs a job worth having!
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Nope. Not my point at all. But I was correct in your lack of knowledge about logic.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Please, we all struggle. For what? To better ourselves so that our children won‚Äôt have to. Now, you blame the successful people for others failures.
@peranghx @mybibelottweets @SenSanders And somehow that becomes everyone else‚Äôs problem?
@Wirral_In_It @SenSanders Could be worse. Could be a socialist hellhole where you are forced to slaughter the stray cow yourself because you are so hungry and the only person with toilet paper imports it from capitalist counties.
@EfcSP @SenSanders Oh yes, we just need more punitive laws. That will make the world a better place.
@zwiebelbaguette @SenSanders Only because of society? Has nothing to do with skill, talent, the fact that they entertain or produce products that help millions of people? I think your angst should be against Bernie on this one. A person among many who make millions from nothing.
@zwiebelbaguette @SenSanders Yeah, but none of you will do it will you. Instead you spend millions making signs protesting about how poor people are. Quite ironic.
@elainesurma @SenSanders 99.8% think people like you should be made illegal and prosecuted and jailed in labor camps... no, not really but since this is Twitter and you are making stuff up I figured I‚Äôd throw this out there.
@Wirral_In_It @ellenjames301 @SenSanders Bankruptcy. One of the best constitutionally created courts we have. Not every country has it. It must be nice to have the option to start over and have a second chance. Thank you, Constitution.

@Rex_Temperis @SenSanders Hey Roy, have you ever thought that maybe it‚Äôs your bad decisions that put you where you are? I mean seriously, at what point do you ask YOURSELF if you want to keep living like that?
@rsciasci @SenSanders Then you should be glad you don‚Äôt live here, eh?
@flywithkamala @SenSanders Kamala, the trend I‚Äôm seeing is you and your ilk continually pushing for government dependency. Look around at what that has done to people. But you don‚Äôt care because for you, you‚Äôll be in charge and above the misery.
@lorriebeauchamp @flywithkamala @SenSanders Yeah, horrible. If you are treated bad or underpaid by these evil free society corporations your only option is to quit and seek a better job. Horrible. Socialism is so much better because if you hate your job or are starving, ... oh well. üëç
@SenSanders Then they should manage their money better or seek another job. Simple.
@Mutant62730511 @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Oh, Bernie invests. Believe me.
@breaddrink1 @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Where do you come up with this tripe. Do you really believe the government should have the power to force one set of people to pay others more for labor that is not that expensive? If people want higher pay they need a skill that pays more money.
@tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Then they need to endeavor to better themselves for a better paying job. This is not a secret. This is how it works and everyone knows this. However, when you create a welfare system that encourages lassitude, expect people to sit on the laurels.
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Please explain how giving people who think flipping burgers is a career a dollar an hour raise will translate into any of that. I really want to know the logic of your statement. (Please do not reply if you do not understand ‚Äúlogic.‚Äù)
@MARCOPEDROSOJR @TheSeamusORegan @tomsmusicplace @tonycamatto @JedimasterIG88 @SenSanders Actually, that‚Äôs their job. To better themselves just like the rest of us who were responsible and busted our ass to live a comfortable life. That‚Äôs how it works. You should not reward irresponsible behavior with handouts. All that does is create more poor people.
You would think a heavily liberal city such as Boston would have people protesting the waste of millions of dollars to plant Palm Trees in the gardens, only to have them dig up and trashed. Instead use the money to,say, feed the poor? #LiberalLogic #MAGA #Truth #LiberalLies https://t.co/0xXUI0uSk2

@madliberalmom @Allisongk9700 @Shibum33 @RepSwalwell I call it freedom, and responsibility. Get government completely out of health insurance and the costs will come down. For what they spent on the website alone they could have subsidized those with pre-existing conditions.
@Shibum33 @Allisongk9700 @badbluto @RepSwalwell Sorry to disappoint. ACA forced people to either pay higher rates or be fined (taxed) so that those that qualified (made too little money to afford the higher rates) were subsidized by those that paid. Simply put it redistributed the wealth of others.

@Allisongk9700 @badbluto @Shibum33 @RepSwalwell The fact is, as a teacher you act like a socialist with your union. You have healthcare so you have no clue how bad the ACA was/is.

@cdvescio @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @BobCorker @JeffFlake @SenateGOP I hope this passes and hurts as bad as Obamacare did.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Hold on First Woman of Color at Harvard Law School. Maybe I want us to drill there. Never thought of that did you?
@SenWarren Yeah, it‚Äôs a peach. Above the attic circle. Taking my family there in February. üôÑ

@anoninmaine @Phoenix20042017 @DrSquishy @Boo62Deaton @SenSchumer No, it took a year to wait for the lack of 60 votes so they created there own rules to pass it. Not saying the republicans weren‚Äôt involved too.

@timkaine So glad this lying moron isn‚Äôt the Vice President.
Classic example üëá of a bigot, @RepMaxineWaters https://t.co/ZhYFr6rdSl
@SenGillibrand Sounds like what you and the Dems did for the previous 8 years to the tune of $10T - so please STFU
@RepMaxineWaters @CFPB Bullshit. It is an unconstitutional bureau that steals from banks to fund pro communist elements within the United States. FO Bat
@MartinHeinrich Martin, just a heads up - before you repeat what you are told to parrot, understand what you‚Äôre gonna say. The name Pocahontas is not a racial slur. Claiming to be Indian to take advantage of benefits for them - now that‚Äôs a slur.

@SenatorDurbin No. They should continue to rob them of their profits so you can waste it on paying for sexual harassment settlements.
@SenWarren ‚ÄúThis is what republican leadership looks like.‚Äù That‚Äôs the extent of your imagination? I would think the first Harvard law ‚Äúwoman of color‚Äù could do better than that.
This is pathetic. The Dems spent $10T of our children‚Äôs money in 8 years and they have the gall to act as if they care about the people. https://t.co/HBKBS8TSYQ
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy, you are by far the saddest prop in Washington.
This is pathetic. Their evil hits the light and they fein repulsion and schedule a class to, what they think, will satisfy the people. We are over it. Removal and pay back the tax payers! https://t.co/4lwG6unur5
@SpeakerRyan Pathetic. Like Hollywood, these people will self regulate themselves, take a class, sign a pledge, and declare all is well. They need to be ran down the streets in fear of their lives.
@SenJohnMcCain John, you are an insult to all who have served.
@JackieEspinal4U @Alba_Dawn @SenBlumenthal I have to agree with you. Although you take sides with this issue - both parties are evil.
@Alba_Dawn @SenBlumenthal I‚Äôve been saying that for the last 8 years - when you were fine with over spending
@SenBlumenthal Apparently, you object to sticking everyday Americans ‚Äúwith the tab‚Äù only when it suites you. $20T in debt, asshole.

@HouseGOP They take $4T and try to pay us off by returning &lt;0.001% back. Must be nice to be in control of so much money. I bet you‚Äôre not willing to give that up even knowing it would help the people.

@SpeakerRyan @IraqiEmbassyUSA @AljubouriorgIQ By partners you mean ‚Äúpuppets.‚Äù
@DDatchery @TrumpDotDotDot @SpeakerRyan As far as pre-existing conditions. We could have covered all of them with what we paid for a website and all the insurance subsidies. But then again, that would not force anyone to do anything.
@DDatchery @TrumpDotDotDot @SpeakerRyan Well, government support is waning. They know it‚Äôs not sustainable. They should have to fight each in the fair market and provide a product that works.
@FilmCriticOne @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @VP Are you talking about the fine print (which it all is) of the United States Tax Code? Have you read it? Do you pay taxes? Do you file the 1040EZ every year? Have you read anything on the #FairTax or the 16th Amendment? Do you believe everyone should pay their ‚Äúfair share?‚Äù
@SenJohnMcCain @senorrinhatch @GOPSenFinance John, we already know how you will vote so stop your applauding a guy that has made a career, like you, out of telling the rest of us how to live. You‚Äôre about as anti American as it gets.
@FilmCriticOne @SpeakerRyan @WaysandMeansGOP Yeah, you‚Äôre right. I prefer 60,000 pages of unreadable laws presided over by 30,000 IRS agents who have the power to charge you with a criminal act and put you in a cage without having the burden of proof.
@DDatchery @TrumpDotDotDot @SpeakerRyan Fool. Health insurance is the biggest winner under the ACA. They are guaranteed a profit.
@SpeakerRyan @WaysandMeansGOP Nice. Now how about giving us the #FairTax so you can‚Äôt debate over our lives anymore, you won‚Äôt have to know where we live, you won‚Äôt need an IRS, people would not have to send you a postcard, and we can leave people like you in the dust.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @VP Meaningful tax reform: #FairTax - Healthcare: Repeal, no replace, free market. Do it.
@JoeNBC The first black Secretary of State (female), the first black senator, the first black congressman, ... do we really need to go on?
@JoeNBC And yet the first woman and black man to the Supreme Court were put there by Republicans. ü§î
@SpeakerRyan and the @DNC know how poor they have made us. This is why they can take $4T from us and give us back &lt;0.001% and make it sound like a great tax overhaul. Nothing changes. The IRS (gestapo) remains as do undeclared wars.
Buy ammo and lots of it. The government is out of control and we need to be prepared. They are getting ready to take your guns.
@MartinHeinrich Martin, you have obviously gotten the memo for today.
