@bbc5live @BBCSounds We are so naive! She could have been a killer &amp; has now been thoroughly trained by ISIS - with this ‘lost children’ backstory, that they would know would appeal to British sensitivities - to be a sleeper in Europe until the caliphate reforms &amp; issues a call to action!

@ChukaUmunna just read your article in The Independent on 11/2. This needs drama to get attention! Forget the ‘people’s vote’, or ‘meaningful vote’ - force an MPs vote! Now we are seeing the impact of Brexit you have to act. ‘The people’ were nearly 50/50. Let PARLIAMENT decide
@ChukaUmunna 🤯 I think MPs should stop putting the responsibility for the Brexit decision on to ‘the people’ &amp; should own it themselves! Why don’t you propose MPs vote instead? As about 2/3 of MPs would vote to REMAIN? It’s time for courage! MPs should step up now! PLEASE! 🤯
@Mesolol69 @55555smd @singharj What - because she made a mistake nearly saying something that would clearly mark her out as a racist? Because she was trying to cover up the phrase she went to say before she stopped herself? Because she knew she was about to say something racist?

@bridonal1969 @singharj @OwenJones84 Yes but misspeaking because you nearly used an unacceptable term means you would have used it in different company ... but you know it’s racist so you didn’t mean to use it on the TV ... there just isn’t an acceptable explanation is there?
@Justanidea121 @singharj I wish everyone was forced to wear their heritage description on their heads! So many sick, racists would discover that most of us Europeans are a right old mishmash of races!! Far less pure than most Africans or Asians in fact!!😃

@Daniel_Sugarman And what a horrendous phrase to use? ‘A funny tinge’? I’ve never even heard anyone use it before. It’s absolutely horrible, it has a  ‘1960s Alf Garnett’ feel to it. Does that mean she’s used to hearing it or using it??? I think she needs to explain it!

@bbc5live @StephenNolan We only have her story that she was just a wife &amp; mother &amp; lost two children. It could just be to cover her real activity. We must be cynical about believing her because we know how ISIS operates. All Brits should be brought back here but straight into being thoroughly checked!
@bbc5live @StephenNolan We shouldn’t have sympathy for this selfish woman who is possibly an ISIS terrorist &amp; may have killed. We have to bring back the Brits but all straight into custody. The poor baby is innocent &amp; should be brought up by his family in the UK who are completely separate from her!
@bbc5live @StephenNolan We have to avoid being naive about returnees from Syria! We have to consider her a terrorist. ISIS train their people to come to Europe as sleepers until they call them. I do feel we should bring Brits back -  but straight into custody!

@bbc5live @ChiOnwurah @Emmabarnett I was really appalled listening to this lady. I missed her introduction, although she was clearly a Labour rep from Emma’s questions.

@bbc5live @Emmabarnett I’m not a Labour voter but I always love listening to the common-sense approach of @lisanandy because she tells things exactly as they are &amp; clearly puts the rights &amp; needs of people first. She’s the perfect example of how a MP should represent their voters.

@bbc5live @Emmabarnett Yes, definitely ... not least because I couldn’t define myself as Conservative but would vote for anyone to prevent JC from coming in &amp; making things even worse! Plus Brexit is overwhelming our consciousness right now! 😳
@bbc5live @lborouniversity Yes they should charge something, regardless of whether parents can afford it. Personally I think it should be cost plus a bit so that the offspring get used to paying &amp; understand what things actually cost! Parents should start to share their budget, it’s for their child’s good!
@bbc5live PS dogs usually prefer canine company (as well as human) &amp; if they lose their pal I’d think carefully about bringing a younger dog into the home fairly promptly.
@bbc5live Undoubtedly dogs feel very deeply &amp; definitely suffer greatly if they lose their closest friend - pooch or person! There’s quite a bit of research on it now &amp; it’s quite convincing. I’m completely convinced based on 50+ years of experience of dogs.

@bbc5live @mattforde THERE’S ONLY ONE REASON ANYONE WANTS A 2ND REFERENDUM: THEY WANT TO REMAIN! But none of them will be honest &amp; admit it. Instead, they talk about how Leavers were misled. It’s also why MPs rejected The Deal: because the majority want to remain. Admit it! #qt
@AngelusofDeath @TheAuthorGuy @CREWcrew And that’s not the worst thing to happen! He still isn’t going to be stopped from being manipulated by Putin &amp; MbS for the rest of THIS term! Let alone another term. All the damage is being done now!
@bbc5live He was absolutely superb today. I think most of us were absolutely stunned that he dug up the mental strength to overcome his injury &amp; level of pain to play that well. He was so close to being able to win that 5th set, given the quality of his play in the 4th! He’s incredible!
@BBCPolitics @bbc5live Then we would have to force negotiations to conclude within the Transition Period! So we would never INVOKE the BACKSTOP! We would all know that from the start so we could all put pressure on the negotiating team from then!
@BBCPolitics @bbc5live I don’t believe ANYBODY could have got more! The balance of power is with the EU! So we have 2 choices now - we can EITHER drop out on 29th March, with many unknowns, OR we can accept the deal, start negotiations &amp; take our time to leave safely over 2 years. Simples! #Brexit
@bbc5live I voted Leave because the EU is underhandedly taking us in the wrong direction. But! We can probably keep many of our current rights, like freedom of movement, during forthcoming negotiations! This is only the very start! #Brexit
@bbc5live And NOBODY has said what is wrong with the deal except the backstop! Because they don’t want us to leave! The deal is only a GATEWAY to CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS! Then 2yrs of negotiations. It’s only the tip of the iceberg!
@bbc5live Talk of a general election is another huge red herring. Remember Jeremy Corbyn wants us to Leave! He doesn’t want another referendum in case it changes to Remain! He’s just hoping to capitalise on the confusion!!!
@bbc5live @JPonpolitics The Sunday am show with JP is one of the few serious political programmes on radio which interviews politicians &amp; relevant commentators. I’m so shocked that @BBCPolitics would choose critical pre-Brexit weeks to try &amp; make it ‘trendy’. Leave it as it is!

@Comey Absolutely! And then make sure their resignation letter is published to which he has no legitimate reply. Why on earth is nobody asking ‘WHY?’ in response to withdrawal of troops from Syria?! He won’t have an answer as he’s been INSTRUCTED to do it by Putin!
@ananavarro Look at Netflix, fascinating but scary series on Trump &amp; how he started in business. Read COLLUSION by Luke Harding, FIRE &amp; FURY &amp; THE FIFTH RISK ... it’s all clearly spelled out! Putin &amp; MbS are using him to isolate USA from rest of world &amp; diminish power for decades! 😳
@ananavarro He got into bed with the Russians in the 80s! When he first got into massive debt &amp; nobody would finance him. Enter Deutsche Bank, no questions asked! Financed casinos, all failed, Trump owes millions! Look at residents of Trump Tower!

@C__Griffiths @bbc5live @Rachael_Swindon @claireperrymp @Emmabarnett Erm ... yes, it probably is ... not based on anything other than her rather more irritating demeanour ... 😳
@mintyspud @bbc5live @nellop71 @claireperrymp @Emmabarnett I wonder what it would be like if you took 600 members of the public, like they do for jury duty? I’d be willing to bet they couldn’t be any worse than any set of politicians!
@nbinsider63 @bbc5live @BBCPolitics @claireperrymp @Emmabarnett Good question. Why do they? I thought you got paid for your excess production?!
@Malwhat_ex @bbc5live @BBCPolitics @claireperrymp @Emmabarnett Yikes! I had no idea she was ever involved in Railways! What did she do? Hold on ... that was the point wasn’t it? Is that better or worse than Grayling though?
@MarkSomers @bbc5live @claireperrymp @Emmabarnett I suspect she doesn’t know that number too, don’t you?
@ThatGuyAkshay @arriba_69 @bbc5live @BBCNews @claireperrymp @Emmabarnett Yep, fair point. I suspect, in part, because she puts it so ‘elegantly’ &amp; moves smoothly along to something irrelevant whereas Diane Abbott would have already been loud &amp; blustering &amp; irritating, so when she couldn’t produce the answer it would be very obvious?
@bbc5live @claireperrymp @Emmabarnett Shouldn’t that be absolutely top priority right now &amp; therefore on the tip of her tongue? Shouldn’t she be reviewing plans for both orderly &amp; disorderly exits on a weekly basis for each energy area, along with the budget status? Wtf is she doing if not???
@MorleyLawrance Are you really surprised? @theresa_may voted to remain but had sat quietly on the fence throughout. Thus she hadn’t upset anyone when DC upped &amp; left &amp; she was able to mount a brief but fierce campaign to get the top job to which she had privately long aspired! Very smart lady!
@MorleyLawrance @mrjamesob Yes I completely plucked it out of thin air because I think it’s probably about right, don’t you? The majority of our MPs want to remain - ok, some are claiming to be committed to leaving if their constituents voted leave. There aren’t a lot really committed to leaving are there?
@gavinesler @UKLabour Or merely irrelevant at the moment ...

@thedailybeast Remember he set up &amp; ran the Transition Team ... until @realDonaldTrump had a hissy fit about it spending ‘his’ money &amp; disbanded the entire operation JUST BEFORE he won the Presidency ... perhaps assuming it was wasted as he wasn’t going to win? Would you work for him TWICE?
@kevinjparker @ChrisMasonBBC @Peston @BBCSimonMcCoy That made me laugh for a moment but then I took in the accompanying picture ... 😳
@business Well firstly you have to get these ‘gridlocked’ MPs to agree on the questions that will be asked ... the substance &amp; then the specific wording. I wouldn’t like to bet on how many months it would take just to achieve that. And then what about the implications of each response ...?
@LitCritBrit @RichardBentall Aren’t they the people told from very early on &amp; still being told today that their life in the UK is secure &amp; they should not be concerned? At no point has that security been threatened!
@Public_Citizen Only ‘liking’ to acknowledge the shocking truth of what you’re saying!
@TheLeadCNN @kaitlancollins I truly wonder why she continues to spread his lies? She’s so exposed by lying to the whole world when she speaks from that podium! She must know so much now about the reality of the Trump day-to-day activities &amp; yet she is somehow motivated to continue to defend him?!
@mposner @TheLeadCNN @kaitlancollins You cannot possibly be a literate English-speaking adult &amp; believe that now??? Where have you been for the last year?

@Meliris8 @TheLeadCNN @kaitlancollins I don’t believe we know the half of it yet ... only Time will tell ... &amp; a few other publications of course! I wonder what the Time cover will look like shortly before the next Presidential election in November 2020? @TIME @time
@BlodGlipn @TheLeadCNN @kaitlancollins Well given that Flynn has met with the Special Counsel’s investigative team close to 20 times now it wouldn’t be a huge surprise if there was more information he could provide, would it?
@jsherman39 @TheLeadCNN @kaitlancollins No - because Michael Flynn has admitted it! He has plead guilty to everything he was accused of!
@TheLeadCNN @kaitlancollins Please don’t forget @jaketapper that Michael Flynn was the very first person @realDonaldTrump attempted to cover up for when he said to @Comey “he is a good guy ... I hope you can let this go”. I believe I have also read that Trump &amp; Flynn have been close friends for some time?
@bbc5live @Tyson_Fury @bigdaddybunce @BBCSounds I have enormous respect for what he’s managed to overcome to return to the sport he loves ... but he behaved extremely badly in the past &amp; that can’t just be ignored today.

@bbc5live @HansOlafHenkel PS you wouldn’t give Hans-Olaf the chance to explain his point! Who knows if it would change anyone’s mind if they saw the EU finally being more flexible &amp; taking UK citizens’ concerns seriously instead of it all being one-sided EU rules! Is it possible?
@bbc5live the point that @HansOlafHenkel was making was AMAZING! We MUST listen if the EU are willing to consider change! It might make a difference? Yes, I voted Leave (only just!) due mainly to the EU’s Federal vision, &amp; UK’s lack of plan &amp; prep, &amp; costs of high net immigration

@bbc5live your mum of 4 seemed sensible in her approach so if it doesn’t demonstrate balance then have her children avoid it. Then over time they might be more likely to question stereotypes? As annoying as pc rules are, we’ve probably all been annoyed by stereotypes in ads!
@bbc5live my initial reaction to the advertising guidelines is that it’s typical pc grumping - but I’ve now remembered how quickly children soak up adverts &amp; sing the words or quote the whole script back to you! I’ve had to debate with a 4-yr-old why ads aren’t always 100% fact!
@bbc5live @Emmabarnett Surely sorting out the problems with Universal Credit must be a high priority? Whatever she says in public they MUST know how bad things are? People are clearly suffering so I hope she’s doing whatever is needed to fix the problems?!

@10DowningStreet @theresa_may @eucopresident Congratulations on putting your personal feelings aside - again - &amp; attempting to do the right thing for the country. You appear to be the only British politician willing to do so! Please stick it out - we need you!
@theresa_may A perfectly sensible compromise that actually provides something for everyone &amp; moves things forward at a reasonable pace. This is only the beginning. Everyone agrees we want to avoid the backstop so ultimately we will. Let’s move forward with it, we don’t want no deal!
@RoryStewartUK Absolutely agree ... it simply doesn’t make any sense! Prison sentences should be reserved for those who are a danger to the public or those whose crime deserves a serious punishment. It ruins already chaotic lives giving a prison sentence where it serves no purpose
@RRemainer @RoryStewartUK @theresa_may Absolutely agree! I sincerely hope the idiots that have triggered this vote won’t make it any worse later today - they need to get behind @theresa_may &amp; support her &amp; the deal now or the country really will be in chaos. I hope she sacks disloyal ministers pronto too! Ridiculous!
@RoryStewartUK This is totally ludicrous &amp; the last thing the country wants! A leadership election now is the very last thing we need! Please explain to your colleagues we’re heartily sick of their self-indulgent behaviour &amp; the PM is the only person with the country’s best interests in mind!
@RoryStewartUK delighted to hear you giving support for the PM on @bbc5live This entire mess is caused by Remainers refusing to accept that @theresa_may got the best possible deal from the EU &amp; they MUST support HER &amp; IT! She MUST win the leadership contest now &amp; get on with it

@CNNPolitics @Comey probably feels he HAS TO keep flagging Trump’s CRIMES, because we have become immune to his behaviour &amp; if nobody flags it then it may simply be ‘lost in the mists of time’ like so much else. It’s uncomfortable watching him go for Trump so hard being ex-FBI though ...!
@CNNPolitics please will you get people to pronounce ‘Khashoggi’ correctly?! It is SO disrespectful not to have checked it &amp; ensured that EVERYONE gets it right! Having listened very carefully to Turkish commentators I believe it is pronounced ‘ha-shock-shee’. Please check!
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper It’s been a total mystery to date as to why Trump is so completely insistent that Climate Change doesn’t exist. Are we now uncovering that - along with everything else - the answer lies in Russia? And that he’s been ‘instructed’ to stand next to the other major denier: PUTIN?!
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper And what about Mike Pence? Nobody has even mentioned him ... but he was glued to Trump’s side throughout the 2016 campaign as soon as he was announced! So who or what did he know then? And what is he covering up now?
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper What about the Russian interference in the 2016 election itself? As soon as there was any hint of it any other President would have ordered the FBI in &amp; then monitored it. Not only did Trump NOT do that, he actively OBSTRUCTED it, insisting the FBI was WRONG! And STILL DOES! Why?

@ananavarro Every time I see this, or any of the related events this week, I can’t help wondering what on earth would happen if it was 45? For starters who would know what to say in his eulogy?
@DagDia37 @ananavarro I’m afraid I just experience terrible envy when people describe such an incredible relationship with their parents. I’d give anything to have had that 😢
@azcynthia @ananavarro They must have been true soulmates ... how beautiful that they couldn’t live without each other! Utterly heartbreaking for you &amp; my heart goes out to you. But what an incredible bond! 💔
@LTauss @ananavarro Only if you had truly loving parents who didn’t let you down ...
@ruthellaowens @ananavarro Honestly? I envy you having such a deep love for each other 😢
@ananavarro It’s utterly heartbreaking seeing such grief. I have to be honest ... I’m incredibly envious of anyone who has parents they love/d so much. I cried every time I saw GW, or old friends like Gen Colin Powell, with tears falling faster as the time progressed.
@PhilipRucker It’s very telling to go through these comments ... I didn’t see a single one defending him! Surely all those millions of supporters are proud of his behaviour at the ultimate formal event?

@MajorZaroff @PhilipRucker Actually he did briefly then dropped his hand! He has no clue how to behave anywhere. That’s why he embarasses the US whenever you let him out!
@jackofallthumbs @TheMama2G @PhilipRucker Precisely. RIP President GHW Bush ... you were the most well qualified President to take office in the last century ... maybe ever! We’re ‘bashing’ the least qualified ... without question. Shame more US citizens can’t see that. He’s not a ‘smart disrupted’, just creating havoc!
@TheMama2G @PhilipRucker Are you really defending the man? Look at him! The rest of the world is completely horrified at what you’ve done in electing him! He’s systematically destroying each critical, hard-won international agreement already resulting in dictator-led countries rebuilding nuclear weapons!
@PressUnleashed @PhilipRucker I’m not sure he even recognised President Carter - he just glanced at him, dismissed him as ‘nobody interesting’ &amp; sat down ...
RT @PressUnleashed: @PhilipRucker And the body language. Seriously. https://t.co/7vaxlka76y
@PressUnleashed @PhilipRucker He behaves like a spoiled child in so many situations that call for maturity, gravitas &amp; statesmanship. That body language looks exactly like a bored 10-year-old at a funeral service ... He’s nothing but an embarrassment to the Office of the President of the United States ...
@PhilipRucker I imagine if you can’t read very well it’s quite difficult to learn the words to a hymn ...
@realDonaldTrump PS: ‘with the very important help of (your) campaign rallies’? Seriously? Have you checked whether all those rallies achieved victory in the seat? No ... didn’t think so!! 🤣🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump When you first installed yourself in the White House (reluctantly, you wanted to stay in NY!) people made excuses for your incredible lack of knowledge about how the US Government actually works. But 2 years in, how is it possible that you STILL DON’T UNDERSTAND it?! From 🇬🇧 !

@bbc5live @PennyBelle_9 @bbcideas I am SO grateful to have spotted this tweet! I’ve followed @PennyBelle_9 now. I’m sure I’ve had ADD for most of my life. I’m so bad now I feel like I’m going completely mad. I already suffer from very bad depression &amp; anxiety. I identify with everything Penny says. What now?
@ChrisMasonBBC @bbc5live Yes I’m a switcher. Most days.
@bbc5live No! This is ridiculous! They can eat &amp; wear what they want to but these are the ONLY people trying to inflict their choices - &amp; the cost of them - on the vast majority! Take your own food if you’re that fussy. And do NOT discuss mine, it’s none of your business how I live my life
@Roughtorcom @bbc5live We all have the right to believe whatever we want to. I have the right not to hear about their beliefs! In fact I want to be protected from them!
@bod_thfc1971 @bbc5live Well I guess someone has to &amp; it’s good to hear you speak about humane slaughter. I’m a complete food hypocrite - I don’t want to even think about the animal when I feel like eating meat! Yes I’m ashamed of it but I do still eat meat. But that’s my right - for now anyway! 😳
@TakeThatStraw @bbc5live I don’t eat green vegetables. Seriously. I loathe them. But I rarely mention it, I certainly don’t have a hissy fit about it!
@TakeThatStraw @bbc5live Can I join your movement please?
@mrYork1983 @bbc5live PPS I think I’d be inclined to raise a petition against a vegan only day. They can eat what they like but they have no right to inflict it on others!
@mrYork1983 @bbc5live PS perhaps we should start a meat-only movement &amp; insist on a meat-only day a week! If I was served vegan I literally wouldn’t be able to eat it
@mrYork1983 @bbc5live This shocks me - the way many vegans are so intrusive &amp; self centred! What gives them the right to even mention it, let alone go on about animal abuse etc. We’re all lucky enough to be able to eat what we choose. I don’t comment on yours, please don’t inflict your views on me!
@BrucesterBEM @bbc5live TBH I’m usually v open minded about most things but this subject makes me want to scream! I have no problem with anyone being vegan but why should it cost society to support their choices? I loathe all vegetables but I don’t inflict that on others &amp; don’t expect special meals!

@eoine_oc @DaveJH2 @IsabelOakeshott @neetneet4710 Yeah but we knew that was absolute nonsense a long time ago now!

@richie4561 @stoked84 @jjsmeiman @ShamanicNights @jane738 @ajcdeane @bbcnickrobinson @CNN @Acosta has learned the only way to actually get a question out is to out-shout @POTUS so that he has to address it.

@richie4561 @stoked84 @jjsmeiman @ShamanicNights @jane738 @ajcdeane @bbcnickrobinson @CNN @POTUS didn’t do a 2-hour Q&amp;A for the good of the people!

@jjflash2018 @bbcnickrobinson @CNN @realDonaldTrump I should also mention that as @POTUS has ignored the convention of regular press conferences &amp; held only a handful, that journalists have far fewer chances to ask questions. It has also always been conventional to ask one question &amp; one follow-up question. If @POTUS dislikes ...
@jjflash2018 @bbcnickrobinson @CNN @realDonaldTrump @Acosta You clearly haven’t listened to @TheLeadCNN yourself, just jumped on a political story - just like @POTUS wants you to! @TheLeadCNN goes out of it’s way to have balanced discussions that include commentators from both sides - always! Just watch &amp; do a check yourself?
@chrisplangdon @bbcnickrobinson @CNN @Acosta That isn’t accurate. Jim @Acosta has simply asked questions @POTUS doesn’t want to answer, nothing more. @POTUS swore to uphold the US Constitution &amp; now wants to vilify any journalist who doesn’t stroke his massive ego. Check transcripts for verification, it’s all there.

@jane738 @ajcdeane @bbcnickrobinson @CNN We have to apply completely different standards to this ‘administration’. To be treated like a ‘president’ or any kind of ‘leader’ surely a person should act like one first?  Plus - as you say - the US Constitution should be upheld - &amp; he swore an oath to do just that.
@ajcdeane @jane738 @bbcnickrobinson @CNN No, she’s right, because in Trumpland you have to apply different standards. He will only a) understand, &amp; b) take any notice of, extreme action. This would remove his entire ‘audience’ at once &amp; he would loathe it. Alternatively do you want Trump dictating who covers him??
@jane738 @ajcdeane @bbcnickrobinson @CNN I agree completely. Simply because it’s the only thing Trump understands. Firstly, any action has to be extreme, all or nothing, as he doesn’t understand anything that isn’t ‘black or white’. Secondly, the media is his ego’s ‘lifeblood’ &amp; his only source of information.

@brianstelter @cwarzel Yes it is. Very sadly.

@bbc5live @PhilWilliams I’ve been glued to CNN &amp; I DO understand the Cohen case: the 2 payments to ladies were made around a month before the election in 2016 &amp; were made to influence the outcome therefore have to be registered as campaign finance &amp; weren’t! This is a federal ...

I maintain my point - HAM keeps close enough to VET so VET will come out behind RAI from the pit stop &amp; then HAM holds out on his soft tyres &amp; stays in P1 #AskCrofty @CroftyF1 @MBrundleF1 @antdavidson #hungariangp
Could we see Lewis try &amp; keep those SOFT tyres going right to the end of the race when Vettel definitelyhas to stop? #hungariangp #AskCrofty @CroftyF1 @MBrundleF1 @antdavidson
VET vs HAM - surely all VET has to do is keep just close enough to Lewis &amp; hold out until lap 35-40 so he only has to do 1 stop? #AskCrofty #hungariangp @MBrundleF1  @CroftyF1  @antdavidson

@hey_ciara And let’s be honest, as much as we love our family &amp; friends it’s not unheard of for these dream holidays to contain enormous rows! Sometimes we want so much for the trip to be perfect it causes us to bottle up issues!
@TwitterMoments @hey_ciara I’ve never felt either intimidated or at risk in 25 years of travelling on business all over the world. Maybe it’s partly dependent on your level of confidence anyway?!
@Sasssays @HannahAlOthman @hackneywick I’ve always dreamed of doing this 😊
@Sasssays @HannahAlOthman @hackneywick @RecoveringCynic I’ve travelled alone for years on business &amp; always enjoyed it ... now my husband of 25 years has found himself a new playmate &amp; I’ve had to give up work thanks to poor health, so I’m going to have to get used to my own company on holiday too 😊

@nadiq38 @bbc5live @johnmcdonnellMP @annaefoster Oh there’s worse ... so Labour come in &amp; make pledges to increase spending, eventually everyone realises the money’s all gone, we have to bring in the Conservatives who slash budgets, none of the dreams come to fruition, 12 years of austerity, etc, etc ...

@bbc5live @cj_dinenage @annaefoster No! Stop excluding elderly health issues, like dementia, from the NHS! It must be free at the point of need, not wrenched from the owner &amp; their family! For all NHS costs the only thing to be taxed must be income! And only from a fair level of income, perhaps £30k upwards
@bbc5live @annaefoster @JPonpolitics I tried again &amp; I still couldn’t make it through the whole thing!

@bbc5live @PhilWilliams Thankyou Gulshinder, I know that if I can stop eating sugar for 2-3 weeks then I stop craving it completely! But one treat &amp; all the craving comes straight back &amp; I find moderation absolutely impossible! Unfortunately for me chocolate is all or nothing 🤣
@bbc5live @PhilWilliams I eat a LOT of chocolate &amp; biscuits &amp; I’m very aware that I need a dietary overhaul. I want to start by cutting out sugar on day 1 &amp; work on the rest more carefully.  I’d prefer this cold turkey approach on sugar but is there any harm in doing that?

#AzerbaijanGP #askcrofty Why was the Safety Car not deployed when @ValtteriBottas tyre shredded all over the track? Then he would have kept his place at that moment, 3rd or 4th! Did they ignore the danger as it was the last lap?
@bbc5live @NickyAACampbell No. Absolutely not. But I fully appreciate that the government had to invite him. He loves pomp &amp; circumstance &amp; it’s the right way to keep him on side.
@B00KINGBANDS @bbc5live Exactly. It’s ludicrous. And you, and businesses like yours, are not posing any great threat to our data! I think you should protest en masse &amp; at least force a change in the size of company to which it applies.
@bbc5live They’ve gone crazy! The new rules are like something out of Monty Python! It’s going to cost small businesses a fortune. The real problem is how large companies extract &amp; exploit our data &amp; this is changing daily so the policy can’t possibly keep up. It’s out of date already.

@bbc5live #rememberingnell It was very hard to hear the way Nell’s death has devastated her family. It sounded like some of the things they shared on air might not have been said to each other before. I hope they can stick close to each other &amp; be very honest about their emotions
@Jav3121 @TherealNihal And thinking about those idiots that verbally abuse you, they only like to feel some sort of momentary power ... if questioned I bet the majority would not only wish you no physical harm but would know many non-white people they consider to be ‘good blokes’ or female equivalent!
@Jav3121 @TherealNihal I often feel very lucky to be white in today’s world. Then I look at the cultural values of Everyone Else &amp; wish I wasn’t. Mainly for the incredible, unquestioned, deep family loyalty that is so much in evidence &amp; for which I would gladly pay if I could!
@TherealNihal Isn’t it strange how different the rate of integration / segregation is the further north we go in the UK? Having moved 300 miles north I’m shocked by the difference to London &amp; the South. I don’t understand why it’s happened this way, northerners are the loveliest people around!
@TherealNihal I don’t want Enoch’s speech to be ‘glamorised’, but it drives crucial discussions about his predictions. Brexit has sadly reintroduced some appalling racist behaviour.  The UK is so varied in its integration it’s confusing! FYI I’m a white Leaver who loves everyone
@TherealNihal I am deeply disgusted by the Gov’s treatment of the immigrants of the 60s/70s. They were invited here to help but are now being treated like criminals, by a Govt that has told recently arrived EU citizens (rightly) they can all stay. Apologise &amp; rescind this now!
@TherealNihal I moved from Hants to Cumbria a yr ago &amp; disc’d NW England is in a racial time warp! I’ve always worked in IT, mostly in London &amp; lived in the South, so racial integration is my ‘normal’. Here there isn’t a sgl dark face &amp; ppl worry a non-white family may move in!
@bbc5live @MartinSLewis Where would you put a small savings fund of about £4-5,000? It’s the only savings I have, or am ever likely to have, I’m not sure if I would need quick access or not.

@bbc5live @DLanceBlack Don’t assume that heterosexual couples automatically make good parents! They’re just the largest sexual group (today).

@bbc5live I’ve had depression since I was 15. I will be on ADs for the rest of my life &amp; that’s fine. People get desperate to get off them because they see them as a sign of weakness &amp; are scared of addiction. But if you need them why resist? Nobody resists cure meds for other conditions!
@bbc5live Pls emphasise an important distinction: you keep saying ‘when you feel depressed’ - but serious depression is a ‘state’ not just a ‘feeling’! It’s an involuntary condition you are in. When it’s bad it’s like living in dark fog, it fills your brain, you can’t function.

@BBCSport @domparsons @bbc5live I don’t believe I’ve ever heard this before: a group of women on radio supporting a male athlete because the women have years of success but the men have never managed to win a medal! That felt incredible! What a buzz! And of course Congratulations Dom!!! 🥉
@julie3_anderson @TomDaley1994 And 2 parents who really want this baby! This much commitment is truly wonderful &amp; I’m sure this baby will always feel loved ❤️
@shush1979 @TomDaley1994 So right!! 👍🏻
@_harajukubarbz @TomDaley1994 Often quite the opposite! And perfectly respectable heterosexual people don’t automatically make good parents!
@Rhiannydd10 @TomDaley1994 Absolutely! Perfectly described 😊
@John_Nina23 @smilyte1 @caseydaley91 @TomDaley1994 How on earth do you think you can make that judgement? Children just need 2 loving parents!
@hard_feeIings @Lucysparklessss @TomDaley1994 There is no money involved in the UK ... it’s the law!
@hard_feeIings @TomDaley1994 Nonsense. It’s a mutually beneficial arrangement! Many surrogates are just wanting to help other couples have a child of their own!
@emikirman @tsklierenko @naaaathanks @chopchop16xx And absolute nonsense! I would give anything to have any 2 parents who made me feel totally loved! Parenting is about so much more than their gender!
@TomDaley1994 Listening to your wonderful news on @bbc5live “Tom Daley &amp; his husband have announced that they are having a baby”, it occurred to me that I think it’s the first time I’ve ever heard those words on national radio &amp; I felt so happy that things are finally changing! Much love ❤️

@MartinSLewis Because men don’t understand what it feels like to be treated like the proverbial piece of meat. Simples!
@MartinSLewis Even if there were it would be just as bad. In a culture of objectifying women in a sexual way for men’s pleasure, why are we shocked at the rate of sexual harassment/attacks? If men believe women are just for their pleasure they will continue to expect to control them! NOT OK!
@hannahox18 @MartinSLewis Yes but sadly it’s only a job because men still like to ogle young, attractive women - it’s sending completely the wrong message to our youngsters that it’s ok. If it’s ok in sport, young men will assume it’s ok to treat all the women in their life the same way. That’s NOT OK!
