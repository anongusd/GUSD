@HPRConline Every child is different, paying attention to individual needs is important.  Maintain family routines to provide consistency.
@HPRConline Despite many ways of participating alongside civilian families there is still a strong need to maintain a military connection among those who have lost their loved one serving in our Armed Forces.  Secondary loss of their military community has significant impacts.
