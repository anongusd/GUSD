Shutdowns happen when people want their various priorities (CHIP, DACA, defense spending, an omnibus) more than they want to vote for *anything* that just keeps the lights on. No, one one actually WANTS the shutdown itself.
@jonfavs @TopherSpiro See my last tweet ‚Äî not wanting a shutdown for shutdown‚Äôs sake! Just showing how serious people are taking their various priorities versus keeping the govt funded.
@jonfavs Maybe ‚Äúwant‚Äù isn‚Äôt the best word. But you‚Äôre willing to go there if DACA isn‚Äôt addressed...unless I misread your tweets?
@TopherSpiro @jonfavs Right but the threat is that he doesn‚Äôt, Dems wouldn‚Äôt vote for the CR - meaning it can‚Äôt pass
One of the biggest reasons people give for a government shutdown being unlikely is no one wants one. Well, now someone does and is actively lobbying Dems to vote against the CR. https://t.co/dsY8S7TC2O

@xpostfactoid @nicholas_bagley @dylanlscott Right but t doesn't lower the baseline post 2026 if you score it as permanent, right?
@xpostfactoid @hyperplanes @nicholas_bagley @dylanlscott But also this decision hasn't been made. Getting rid of such huge spenders later on does lower the baseline.
@xpostfactoid @nicholas_bagley @dylanlscott Right. Cutting off subsidies and expansion should more than pay for block grants (with the taxes GC keeps)
@xpostfactoid @nicholas_bagley @dylanlscott I feel like doing the 2015 repeal bill would have been much easier leverage.
@xpostfactoid @nicholas_bagley @dylanlscott Yep. Reauthorizing the block grants at their current level wouldn't cost anything.
@dylanlscott @xpostfactoid @nicholas_bagley Yeah but cutting the taxes would cost even more!
@nicholas_bagley @dylanlscott @xpostfactoid I feel like the politics are going to be insane either way. But $2 tril is like, next level insane
@dylanlscott @xpostfactoid @nicholas_bagley But why not cut that spending altogether as a saver? Where else would you find the pay fors?
