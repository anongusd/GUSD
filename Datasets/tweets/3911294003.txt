RT @matt_kwong: Now the only filibuster is for legislation. I asked Senate expert @Rachel_Bovard if she thinks legislative filibuster is do…
@llrealz False. Precedents are different than rules. Standing rules require 67 votes to be changed.
NEW from @Heritage: the biggest issue on the table for Trump's meeting w/ Chinese leader Xi Jinping? #NorthKorea. https://t.co/gSNqQQgSHJ
For the last time, the #NuclearOption doesn't change Senate rules. That requires 67 votes. It sets up a new precedent for the filibuster. https://t.co/0seaWES2dl
The Senate has now invoked cloture on the #Gorsuch nomination. The final vote to confirm him will take place Friday evening.
The Senate is now voting on cloture to move forward the #Gorsuch nomination, which will be done at majority threshold instead of 60 votes.
The Senate has officially employed the #NuclearOption by overturning the ruling of the chair, 48-52.
Procedurally, Rs will vote no, to overturn the ruling of the chair and ax the filibuster. Dems will vote yes, to sustain it. #NuclearOption
The Senate is now voting to remove the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. #NuclearOption
Absent more delay motions from @SenSchumer, the Senate is expected to invoke the #NuclearOption. Watch live. https://t.co/EYF6svidpu
If you're keeping track, this is the second motion @SenSchumer has made to delay the #NuclearOption. First was to postpone, now to adjourn.
.@SenSchumer has now made a motion to adjourn the Senate, in an effort to delay the deployment of the #NuclearOption.
@JakeGrayPoliSci No, nuclear option does not deal with which calendar the question originates from. Just classifications - judicial or not.
.@SenSchumer has made a motion to postpone the #Gorsuch nomination until the end of April. The Senate is voting on that now.
Correction: #NuclearOption doesn't change Senate rules. That requires 67 votes. It manipulates Senate precedent in violation of the rules. https://t.co/SFvHIfyLby
The Senate did not achieve the votes necessary to break the filibuster on #Gorsuch. The #NuclearOption will likely be invoked shortly.

@JakeGrayPoliSci Treaties are still subject to the filibuster, as is legislation. TBD if Senate decides to go nuclear on the filibuster for bills/treaties.
Read more about the filibuster here. https://t.co/OFTbXBqnVR
Even though Senators will no longer be allowed to filibuster judicial noms, they will still be allowed to filibuster legislation. For now.
So, Senate rules still allow for a filibuster, but the Senate would operate under a precedent that violates its own rules. Weird, we know.
The #NuclearOption does NOT change Senate rules. That requires 67 votes. Rather, it changes precedent, which only requires 51 votes.
The #NuclearOption means eliminating the filibuster for SCOTUS noms. The filibuster was already eliminated for other judicial noms in 2013.
The Senate is expected to deploy the #NuclearOption in just about an hour. What is it? What does it mean? Let’s talk.
