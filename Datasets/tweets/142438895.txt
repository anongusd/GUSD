@oledi45 @SebGorka @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No, Graham is just having a senatorial temper tantrum because he doesn’t have a high enough security clearance to be part of the discussion.
@nabhanii1 @SebGorka @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You’re totally correct about that. Senator Graham also doesn’t have a high enough security clearance to be privy to the entire scope of what’s happening in the Mideast.
@SebGorka @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It appears @LindseyGrahamSC doesn’t understand how detrimental his lack of foresight would be to Israel as well as to the people of Iran &amp; Yemen. He’s not grasping the total picture of the Mideast peace process.
@LisaMei62 Maybe it went the same way as the $500 billion unaccounted for at HUD.

@alexbly1222 @DaneeRiggs @EleanorNorton Pelosi was more uncomfortable with “impeachment” prior to the midterms because she didn’t know who would get the House majority. If she becomes Speaker, she will become more publicly assertive about prosecuting the President.
@lt_temple @HistoryChanging @EleanorNorton @coleyworld That’s paranoia talking. Pres. Trump knows who he’s dealing w/with Nancy Pelosi.

@madeleine @SenatorMenendez @USATODAY Speaking of repugnant, you know that the Socialist policies that your liberal cohorts embrace are merely going to lead back to what you fled from if America is allowed to devolve. Why are you encouraging it?
@madeleine That’s why we have to guarantee that the Mullahs of Iran don’t try to make good on their vow to annihilate Israel.
@madeleine @HillaryClinton @TeaLeoni @MadamSecretary @CBS Did your State Dep’t have an IG? Why didn’t HRC have an IG appointed during her tenure as Sec of State? When Kerry came on board, he had one.
@madeleine @one Does that mean you’re willing to speak out vociferously against female genital mutilation?
@madeleine The Muslim Brotherhood, with whom Khashoggi was affiliated, wasn’t exactly a paragon of democratic values.
@madeleine Then we’re agreed that Louis Farrakhan has no business being buddy buddy with members of Congress.

@mymia59 @TuckerCarlson I don’t know what that blue check is about. I checked to see if I could dm you with some info. Anyway, he did, maybe still does, work for the Center for American Progress, founded by John Podesta and funded by George Soros.
@mymia59 @TuckerCarlson He’s originally from Frederick, MD, but most of his activity is DC-based. He was arrested at President Trump’s Inauguration Rallies. He was involved with the Charlottesville protests.
@mymia59 @TuckerCarlson This guy has a long history as a Communist agitator in the Washington DC Metro area. He’s proud of his exploits. You can find him here @ dpetrohilos
