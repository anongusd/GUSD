Safer? ISIS on the rise. North Korea testing nukes. Syria in chaos. Taliban on march. This president is living in a different world. #SOTU
They're not just "killers and fanatics." They're radical Islamic terrorists. Still can't call them by name. #SOTU
It appears Obama is still under the impression ISIS is the JV team. Next President must understand the enemy and the threat. #SOTU
Middle-class income has declined $2,000 under Obama's failed policies. That's not progress. That's not giving everyone a fair shot. #SOTU
