“Baseball brings all Americans together. No matter what race, gender, political party affiliation, or social economic status; whether you live in the south, north, the Midwest or out west – Baseball is the great unifier and equalizer.”
“Now as the Librarian of Congress I am honored to oversee one of the LARGEST baseball collections in the world – I’m like a kid at a candy store – wait - more like a kid at a concession stand at a ball park.”
“The best games were when the Cardinals played the Giants. This meant legendary center fielder Willie Mays was on the field. As an African-American girl, watching Mays play was unforgettable. It was truly like watching history.”
“My greatest memory is going to Cardinals games with him. This is one of the fondest memories I truly cherish: Holding his hand walking into the ball park, buying a hotdog, sitting in the stands and singing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame. It was truly.. magical.”
