If the men were white it would not be a hate crime.  What bs. https://t.co/jlyNCKrOCI
Trump's greatest weakness is that he is a white male, thus open to attack from all sides, especially whites.  Obama was exempt from criticism.  If you criticized him you were a racist! https://t.co/wVKQSitaif

Nope.  If you criticized Obama you were a racist! https://t.co/bZyxVjIniB
This problem happens again and again and again in Ca.  You know Obama reduced the number of fire fighting airplanes in Ca.  Perhaps the mighty Democrats that control Ca. think not many votes would be gained by addressing the Forrest fire issue. https://t.co/JFjHvoO6gg
Could the Fed mandate early voting for all states? https://t.co/fpYz3AGb0C
What could the reason be not to have early voting?  Good subject for an editorial. https://t.co/prfDAlFL6s
Observation--the states that do not allow early voting are either Southern states or traditionally Democratic strongholds.  What is their excuse for this lame policy? https://t.co/rWjVmGbwnR
And make sure your pundits are "counting" the votes! https://t.co/4ixLZ4K1fU
When the Democrats' strategy is "win at any cost", why are we surprised when voter fraud occurs ? https://t.co/qOp09HJ8C2

Early voting removes all excuses for voting problems. https://t.co/O5KN6I6I3i
So Gillum wants to impose a state tax on Florida and he wants people to vote for him?  How dumb do you have to be to vote for additional taxes?  Like Einstein said, "I am not sure about the infinity of the universe, but there seems to be no end to human stupidity ". https://t.co/oQVj4agdlR
