@Amberleigh1029 I want to reply  but too damn tired and midnight train to netflix + good scotch just arrived. 	Have a good evening, thanks for the chat üòÅ
@Amberleigh1029 Grandma's been budgeting for SS tho. What do I tell gram gram?
@Amberleigh1029 Well, essentially here is what is happening. I'll give you $10 a day more but your gas cost and cost of milk for cheerios has gone up by $11. Peter Navarro is in charge of US Econ policy and trade war.	There is NO respected economist that agrees w Navarro. Seriously, not one.
@Amberleigh1029 Sounds great, but that's not what happens. They give the money to me, the shareholder with buybacks and pay the CEO an 35 instead of 30 million a year. The stock market is down since tax breaks btw.	Trickle down DOES NOT work. Macro Econ 201 class. Never worked, ever.
@Amberleigh1029 Amber, they're not being enforced, and they need improvement. The NRA wants those laws you listed removed, which doesn't seem reasonable to me.
@Amberleigh1029 Ah no rush, doing car stuff in garage. VROOOOM! But now super tired		 A civil convo about diff opinions is always welcome. I'm not going anywhere :) Will reply as fast as I can
@Amberleigh1029 Well, we have laws that don't allow children to work farm fields. You are oversimplifying macroeconomics. Our economy needs those willing to start at very bottom and work up. My mom cleaned houses in the 80s, now her and pops worth 8 figures. That money they spend pays wages
@Amberleigh1029 I honestly don't know who is saying we need socialism but I agree with you. A couple far left Dems say we should have universal healthcare and suddenly all dems are socialists? Most dems just don't want the GOP to remove pre existing condition laws.
@Amberleigh1029 Your going back to this black or white talking point. Who's promoting socialism? Funding some social programs is not "socialism".		Those "illegals" I want to let in want the opportunity to work hard AND GET AHEAD because they're working hard. Like all Americans.
@Amberleigh1029 Someone with a college education is more likely to be a Dem. That's a fact. You think NYC, Frisco, LA and other Dem strongholds are occupied by poor people? Of course not, that's just a non sense talking point. 	A quick google search and you can fact check that
@Amberleigh1029 My adopted son needs about $800 a month in meds. I pay about 25k in taxes but if it weren't for medicare he wouldn't have been able to to get those meds prior. It is not for single mothers, it's for Americans who need help.
@Amberleigh1029 Amber, c'mon. You know Red states are the biggest recipients of welfare? GOP convinces the poor they are on their side.		https://t.co/UasIyutJjm
@Amberleigh1029 Good at heart, never doubted it and awesome of you to do. McConnell is going to cut entitlements this go around to offset the billions they gave to the top 1%. He just said that in an interview. That means grandmas social security and medicare. Health is #1 bankruptcy cause
@Amberleigh1029 Trickle down meaning, give the top $ and they'll pay the lower half more. It doesn't work, that's historical fact. There has never been an example of where it has worked. Tax cuts were for the rich and the poor wage increases are not keeping up w inflation. That's the reality rn
@Amberleigh1029 There is going to be a wide spectrum of views on what should and should not be allowed. What about bump stocks? My city lost 50+ due to them, so I'm bias but the point is there is a middle ground. Being on extremes accomplishes zero.
@Amberleigh1029 How about someone convicted of gun violence walking out of a gun show with new weapons? How about domestic violence conviction? Common sense according to you and I. Anti-depressant due to child loss would not be common sense to not allow you your rights. My condolences btw üôè
@RealErinCruz @TheErinCruzShow Reducing foreign aid inflames the problem Erin. Not wanting to be condescending, but do you know how asylum and citizenship actually work? They can not apply for citizenship from a different country.
@Amberleigh1029 Our economy would be crushed without low wage workers. Who do you think the people washing your car, mowing your lawn, working our farms are?
@Amberleigh1029 I'm also a gun owner, again, not black and white. Idiots shouldn't have guns, so some common sense oversight wouldn't make me feel less able to defend myself. 10% owns 90%. I don't want "more taxes" but trickle down econ has NEVER worked
@Amberleigh1029 It doesn't have to be black or white, socialism or capitalism. I'm a capitalist, but know firsthand that life can be unfair. So I don't mind helping the less fortunate. Speaking to him directly, he would have been able to get some housing assistance and seen a doc to start
@lizBeth_Hineni @TeamErinCruz @RealErinCruz @TheRealJohnHCox @TheErinCruzShow @BaileyForAG @KonRoditis @MarkMeuser Hi Beth, I'm genuinely interested in dialog. What is it that the GOP is bringing to the table that you support?
@FoxNews @BryanDeanWright Or the GOP could actually work out a bi partisan immigration reform solution and stop using the poor and hungry as political pawns. Just a thought.
@Amberleigh1029 The F'd up part is guy was living in his van? He would have benefited the most (as would anyone making less than 75k annually) from the Dems.	Just being pumped full of non sense daily to make him think they are the "enemies"
@frtygrl @AHMalcolm @NorthAmerican8 Judy, MSM is focused on an ongoing voter suppression campaign by the GOP. Wouldn't that be more relevant than a selfie, since it is aimed at African American communities?
@sassymichgirl Look at the unbelievable poverty. We are sending troops to stop migrants that are walking thousands of miles to avoid starvation and hunger.		I wonder what Jesus would do? Send troops?
@RealErinCruz @EIP_CA Election integrity? Didn't the GOP spend the 4th of July in Russia, you know, our adversary, that is currently waging cyber attacks on our democratic foundation? Then did nothing for two years but praise them?
@joelpollak @BreitbartNews I wonder if they know about the on going effort to actively make voting more difficult in primarily AA communities by the GOP and / or just don't care
@FoxNews @VP That doesn't equate to no immigration laws but your viewers may not be able to put that together, so I see why you are promoting that line. It's redundant, we don't need more gov. workers. Border patrol, DHS, FBI, local P.D., for crying out loud
@replouiegohmert Why? Is border patrol so inept that they can't stop a "caravan" of starving immigrants who just walked thousands of miles? Seems like an obvious publicity stunt
RT @CalFreedomMom: If you watched the #KavanaughHearing, do you think the Democrats overplayed their hands and will pay in the #2018Midterm‚Ä¶

@VeryJonesVery @NolteNC The rules are you sit in a triangle
@VeryJonesVery @NolteNC Devils triangle is a drinking game		Anyone who doesn't think he's a lying drunk is blinded by partisan non sense
@JaredBeck So the FBI should investigate right?

@misd75 @gnrhippie @KatMcKinley @benshapiro Kavanaugh not wanting FBI to investigate	Your rationalizing with: Dr. Ford not coming Monday but Thursday instead. 		Good grief. I wonder if it was your daughter, sister, niece etc. if you'd stick up for him like that
@misd75 @gnrhippie @KatMcKinley @benshapiro That means he must be innocent or are you having a conversation with someone else now?
@twonnet @NoahCRothman White House is the client in this scenario, so they would need to order it. Not "the dems"
@misd75 @gnrhippie @KatMcKinley @benshapiro What about demanding the guy who was ALSO cited as being there being brought in to testify under oath?	This seems so easy to clear up	Common sense stuff
@misd75 @gnrhippie @KatMcKinley @benshapiro If they did it under oath I'd demand the FBI investigate it.		Weird he's not DEMANDING that to clear his name?
@PatrioticVa Oof, imagine if it was about your daughter		Seemingly the worst of society still defending

@mike_Zollo Ever stepped back and wondered why so many in America are not Trump fans?
@joelpollak Funny, they were right. Who knew Trump transition team was actively working with an adversary? Oh, right, Hilary may have mentioned that.

@NeotipPro @caitoz Point taken A.D.	There are no doubts about that from me. Unfortunately the education gap due to socio economic hurdles have many on the wrong side of that disparity supporting the very policies that keep them there.		This is an exploitation of the best system available.Capitalism
@caitoz You posted "that doesn't mean opp of evrythng RU gov says is true"		I responded to your post, not sure where I lost ya.		You can block me if you can't handle someone's opinion of your opinion. üëç
@esaagar Hmmm	Flynn	Manafort	Gates	Cohen	Pop	Vanderswan	Weisllburg	Pecker	Trump Org	Might have a diff opinion on that		Many more to come! MAGA!!!
@caitoz So you're taking the off cuff comment which was obviously a generalization and using it to push what narrative exactly?	You assume I own a TV. Guessing that's your "go-to" to prove someone is indoctrinated. Yawn
@NeotipPro @caitoz By "oligarchy" you mean experienced politicians.		Russia, should protect their interests. The interest of the people. Pension reform comes to mind. Corruption is estimated to make up how much of Russia's miniscule gdp again?
@caitoz Russian state media lies. 	Starting with that as a predetermined fact is incorrect?
@marklevinshow Sending "thoughts and prayers"
@marklevinshow Can you have a legal defense after you've plead guilty?		Rhetorical question		You're a fcking moron
@The_Trump_Train Just remove the "tax paying" part if you put Trump on it. Unless his cronies getting locked up for tax evasion and him refusing to release his are coincidence	LOLOL
@caitoz Before a "like what" response, it would be a much shorter list to name what principles we have in common. So by all means, list away
@caitoz You realize Russia is against everything America stands for? You should read up a bit Cat.
@DailyCaller Whaaat? A NY "billionaire" who mocks the poor? Say it aint so!
@RealAlexJones Heard your quest for dismissal ended poorly :(		Womp womp you ghoulish sht stain of a human
@The_Trump_Train Or, the $100 million on golf and mar a lago trips and not cut the gov. employee pay raise (done today you simpleton)
@SlackerInChief @LouDobbs Such a crazy idea to these idiots walking us straight in to authoritarian rule		WAKE UP YOU GD DMN IDIOTS		Lou has been dead for 10 years, he's being animated by stray cats!!!
@LouDobbs Yes, let's be like N. Korea!!
@The_Trump_Train Put money in these crooks pocket while they cut pay raises TODAY and...yes and, working to cut capital gains tax which benefit no one in Trump's base (uneducated whites)		Just astounding
@michellemalkin You've got the talking points memorized. If only you could think for yourself and research any of these b.s. narratives :(
@AnnCoulter @AndrewGillum Hi Ann!	Any comment on 	Flynn	Manafort	Weisllburg	Pecker	Gates	Vanderswan	Popadopolous	Trump org. investigations	Or just handcuffed to your ideology until you have to repent?
@mike_Zollo Everything, everything is a fcking lie coming from this treasonous mobb admin		https://t.co/QJ4DFMS61G
@GovMikeHuckabee Something about a 50k payment from Qatar LOLOL		Every last one of you is going to have to answer to the law soon friend
@GovMikeHuckabee Aren't you now under investigation?
@RealErinCruz @Johnny_Congress @AdamSchiffCA @latimes @FOXLA @CNNPolitics @OANN @foxandfriends @POTUS So therefore anyone who supports him is either misinformed or just a simpleton
@RealErinCruz @Johnny_Congress @AdamSchiffCA @latimes @FOXLA @CNNPolitics @OANN @foxandfriends @POTUS Yea, most of America thinks Trump is as corrupt as all the information publicly available says he is :(
@mikandynothem @codeofvets @DiamondandSilk @DonaldJTrumpJr @DineshDSouza @DonnaWR8 @Corrynmb @KatTheHammer1 @inittowinit007 @LeahR77 @ColoradoGirl2A You could really support in n out by not supporting the capital gains cut proposed today for the wealthiest while 40% of Americans are broke as sht. Maybe ask for their employees to have a livable min. wage? JFC you guys are idiots
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump The fck is this idiotic sht?		He just cut the pay raise to American employees while trying to push a capital gains for the wealthiest and dmbfcks like you post this type of sht
@mike_Zollo You know being undocumented is a misdemeanor?		So when you fake outrage yet ignore felony allegations committed by Kushner and Ross sitting positions of power you seem like a racist dimwit?
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Sad, the majority of Trump voters (white without degree) would benefit the most from those they disparage. He's no socialist, it's a talking point. You can actually research what he is for and not rely on what they spoon feed you.
@NolteNC The irony of your name and the unnamed source in your article is just too fcking much		Just a pure simpleton
@HarryForCT Here we just crush seniors with debt and sht healthcare services

@ThatcherGlenn @KatTheHammer1 @gatewaypundit LOL		Trump is furious they hacked the sec. of state right? He's going to do stuff now		What's that? He's a compulsive liar and his dipsht followers always believe him? NOOOOO WWAAAYYY		https://t.co/oB1kj0IxMF
@KatTheHammer1 @gatewaypundit If only the GOP and Republican party were in charge of this government then something could be done about it!!!		So what if FBI tweeted that he was lying 5 min later! Deep state secret society and sht!
@KatTheHammer1 @realDonaldTrump @carrieksada @bbusa617 @grizzlemeister @RealMAGASteve @PhilMcCrackin44 @realClintonM614 @1776HotLips He's winning!!!	Flynn, Gates, Manafort, Vanderswan, Weisllburg, Cohen, Pecker, Popadopolous, or anyone affiliated with Trump org not so much tho :(
@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump Errrmyyygawd!!!		I knew it!		Sorros and Obama conspiring to get Uranus 1 thru memogate at a pizza joint!!!		Gullible simpletons
@replouiegohmert Don't mind us selling out your country cuz your boss is getting rich AF!		Like a bunch of trees idealizing the axe. The handle is wood just like us!
@NolteNC They independently confirmed People magazines unnamed source for article? LOL		Fck you guys are the most gullible shtheads on the planet
@HB3third @stanncatt @replouiegohmert Going after Ohr,Strzok and any other members of FBI that deal SPECIFICALLY with Russian organized crime	Cohen-Guilty	Weisellberg-Cooperating	Manafort-Guilty-more pending	Popadop-Guilty	Vanderswan, Pecker, Gates, Trump org etc etc etc		Dumb fcks
@DailyCaller JFC he looks like such a dipsht
@AccuracyInMedia But it was about adoptions
@OliverMcGee @ABC @therealroseanne What do I click if I think she should be getting treatment for a mental condition?

@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @AmiHorowitz Do you know where YOUR Trump donations are?		https://t.co/u2Kf9SnwgX
@DeplorableME23 @realDonaldTrump I'm sure it's a coincidence that he was one of the top Russian organized crime prosecutors. Sure glad the Congress decided not to let the American people watch!
@BreitbartNews I thought Trump said it was the best in the history of the universe? He even cited "many people said"
@RealAlexJones Alex Jones says interview is "off the rails"		HAHAHAAAAA
@chuckwoolery Fairness huh? 	Regulating google for "fairness", 	Regards, 	China		I think OJ Simpson has an argument as well, not many flattering results when I search his name. Maybe Trump needs to start thinking about what America stands for rather than himself
@The_Trump_Train Weird, my first suggestion is heroes on google. Maybe it is based on your area chief
@charliekirk11 Palestinians people are a terror proxy?		What a racist fcking moron you are
@mike_Zollo Wise up MAGA dude	Flynn-Guilty	Cohen-cooperating	Manafort-Guilty w more charges pending	Vanderswan-Guilty	Popadopolous-Guilty	Weisserman-Immunity deal	Pecker-Immunity deal	Gates-Guilty	More than 1 additional sealed 		It wasn't about adoptions, they were conspiring
@KatTheHammer1 You stand by Flynn, a felon, but are super against entering America illegally, a misdemeanor. 	Loosen the maga hat, may be on too tight
@mike_Zollo Oh, that's good to know. Since blindly following people without questioning people in power always works out great, right?		The fck is wrong with you bro? This isn't N.K.
@BreitbartNews Fox is the most watched tho correct? So they are the "main stream media"		Everyone is out to get ya or you're all fcking morons. Im leaning towards column B
@CassandraRules @kelliwardaz You mean the one who said McCain timed his treatment and ultimate death to hurt her campaign? The one who takes conspiracy theory peddlers on her tour bus?		Is this how we #MAGA?		GOP is so fucking lost. Go back to blowing Russians Cass
@joelpollak @BreitbartNews Trump is a sinking ship friend. Keep pounding that drum but districts swinging 25+ points are louder than you. GOP needs to clean house or risk obliteration
@TomFitton I own several firearms and think this is idiotic. This has little to do with the second amendment. Plastic guns able to bypass generic security checks that can be made at home are good idea? Assuming you are just a shill for the NRA, National Rubles to American dollars
@mike_Zollo He's taxing us, Americans, with his tariffs since he does not know how trade works. Seems like you do not either
@joelpollak So phony it led to charges including conspiring against the US 	The economy tho, right? Jump for a dollar to sell out your country
@AcidCinnamon @stranahan He links Sputnik? The Russian state deza promoter?		Wtf is wrong with the people that believe a word this fukwit traitor tweets?
@stranahan Why do you have an American flag in your profile while linking Russian state media sites?
@FoxNews At this point, standing by Trump is just confirming for the 3/4th of America that do not, you are either 1. Corrupt AF 2. Never completed a critical thinking course 3. A fcking idiot		First story out of the vault!	Illegitimate love child with Trump Tower housekeeper		HAHAHAAAAA

@mike_Zollo LOL		"He needs us"		He would spit on you if it meant he could get away with all the crimes he's caught up in
@trumpsterst Hey genius, GOP runs the entire government. No charges filed, no investigations just a bunch of gullible idiots chanting "lock her up" guided by Russian troll farmers laughing their asses off at you
@WhatWithACloth1 @desalvo_franco @chuckwoolery Imagine an idiot who believes that garbage, while the GOP runs the entire government and has had no one prosecuted for their idiotic claims		Be prepared for the ruble to crumble comrade ü§£
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Grandpa's that use tanning beds for Trump! #MAGA!
@BreitbartNews I knew it! Jim is the bad guy, not the 72 year old tanning bed user that helped a foreign adversary attack our sovereignty. It all makes perfect sense now!

@RealJack Chilling! So chilling no one from the GOP or Trump give two fcks about it but RealJack is on the case!
@RealMattCouch LOL		So Team trump and the entire GOP couldn't muster anything up with their lock her up chants to actually lock anyone up but these halfwits will expose the troof!		Weird how the 72 year old that uses a tanning bed and his posse seem to be getting locked up, huh? Weeeeird
@RealMattCouch Hit them in the mouth with a solid left hook eh?		Take this garbage back to Russia comrade
@SirSeamusPeter Now, pick up a book and do some fact checking, then get back to us.		Better yet, read some the replies he gets from real historians not skewed by Dinesh the felon fckwit
@GeorgWebb Hey George, you know GOP controls our government right now? You'd think if they could "lock her up" or anyone in these dumbfck conspiracy theories, it may have happened by now?		Are you waiting for dems to take control and investigate or just a gullible idiot?
@USATrump45 You just can't get over Hilary, can you? https://t.co/XlXravLADj
@FoxNews @AlanDersh Hey Dershy, when you knowingly agree to get dirt on a political opponent from an adversary it actually is a pretty serious offense...so unlikely that will ever happen
@0311ghost @KrisParonto @abcnews Nation of laws!!!		So that means Kushner who lied on SF 86 multiple times (felony btw, unlike crossing border) should be locked up too, right??
@LauraLoomer @SharylAttkisson Obamaaaaa!!!!		Let it go Laura	You realize GOP controls entire gov. and nothing is being done about your bullsht narrative for a reason? Because it's bullsht
@prayingmedic Says the dumbfck that didn't read the full page and a half of the FISA dedicated to the dossier spelling out exactly that.		Are mofo's this gddmn stupid? Seriously, how hard is it to read 1.5 pages?

@joelpollak @PARISDENNARD Trump making sure anyone who could be called to assist the US using their previous experience are gone and we have only Omarosa type unqualified idiots at guard. #MAGA

@DailyCaller Weird	12 former heads of intel from both sides of the isle just came out supporting him. Was that an interview with RT or some other Kremlin state media? Flynn would have said the same thing
@metxdj @LouDobbs @SaraCarterDC @JudicialWatch What a scheme they hatched!	Allowing Trump to become president by keeping silent that he was under investigation and then umm trying to remove him from power		Russian troll or just a fcking idiot	The ruble is going to crumble and you'll be begging for a visa soon
@LouDobbs @JudicialWatch Good grief Lou		Not looking well my friend. Being a traitor has been rough on you
@dbongino Just defend anyone who conspired against the US if it supports reality tv star who worked with adversary to gain power	The Dan Bongino legacy!

@DailyCaller Are all your articles just an endless loop of complaining?
@MAGAGal1052 Wow, look at the responses in this thread. Such intellect.		Not one person in this thread knows what a Rhodes scholar is. Just hate mongering knuckle dragger posts from perpetual victims		If you're not making over 100k per annum nd support Trump you are getting played
@MAGAGal1052 Have you ever thought that maybe he's just a fcking moron that makes himself look bad?
@seantehan22 These great conservative figures don't support exploding deficits, tariffs, weakening alliances and legitimizing anti democratic regimes...right?

@nationdivided @marklevinshow Plays to your ignorance of history		Did he mention McConnell's refusal to announce the info w dems in a bipartisan manner since Trump would just yell rigged rigged with his bullshit "fraud committee" he had on stand by? I'll guess no
@joelpollak @Comey Wow you're a dipshit		Comey - Lifelong republican, but like many switched to Democrat under Trump
@JPFabricate @alexanderbruz Against exploding deficit, against tariffs, for free trade, for strong alliances, against anti democratic nations and against authoritarian regimes. 	Red states are currently being supported by liberal net positive states btw 	https://t.co/UasIyutJjm
@JPFabricate @alexanderbruz Yes, Tucker	The step son of the Swanson frozen dinner heiress bitching about poor people "hooked on food stamps" has integrity.		He's human scum and unfortunately if you don't see that, well...		You can do the math
@RodStryker @charliekirk11 @MikeTokes @DineshDSouza @CB618444 @jimlibertarian @Thomas1774Paine @RealCandaceO @SKYRIDER4538 @RubyRockstar333 @codeofvets So we are clear, what Trump did and stood for in the 70s and 80s is how we should now judge him, is that correct?
@JPFabricate @alexanderbruz The MSM is Fox news by definition. They essentially work as state TV omitting a few who have some integrity remaining	The other press outlets, that have been around longer than you or I have make clear what is an "opinion" piece and what is not. Bias can be spotted.
@FoxNews @RepDeSantis @IngrahamAngle His conduct has been a joke		Trump spending his day tweeting attacks at his former top WH aides is perfectly normal		It was his conduct that has been a joke. Do they know how fcking stupid they sound?
@michaelbeatty3 @DanCovfefe1 I don't get it Miguel	How is it the ones that will fair the worst under Trump's policies seem to be his most loyal supporters. As an example, this is the GOP healthcare reform being pushed thru	Don't have to believe me but Trump benefits my pocketbook (top % tax) and hate him https://t.co/Y4H97Hg9fY
@michaelbeatty3 @DanCovfefe1 Thanks		Yea, I typed hashtag MAGA in my anti-trump posts and magically I had 10 maga bot followers. I have to report them every few days or so and then I'm back to &lt;30
@JPFabricate @alexanderbruz No, anything that is a lie, skews or portrays conjecture as facts to support a false narrative is propaganda. 		A simple example: "fake dirty dossier". If even a single item had been validated as being false, ok, but that's not the case. The opposite is true.
@DanCovfefe1 @michaelbeatty3 Man, you guys sure post about 2016 and Hilary a lot	Seems weird		Also weird that Trump's national sec advisor, campaign chair, deputy chair, multiple foreign policy advisors and attorney, are all either under investigation, plead guilty or indicted		Trump life baby!
@nationdivided Yes, you are super important and need to be censored		Or they were bots
@JPFabricate @alexanderbruz There is a difference between propaganda and simply calling anything that is critical of you "fake news"
@SebGorka @JohnBrennan @seanhannity @danielhoffmanDC @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @foxnewsvideo Oh, and Flynn too right?
@chuckwoolery Weird she was hired and offered a hush money deal of 180k of tax payer money		So what's that 3 of Trump's people that have accused him of knowing about emails prior to release aka TREASON	Cohen	Omarosa	Bannon		You'd have to be a fcking moron to not see what's coming.
@LeahR77 Context	Also, he said what about Antifa? Or is that a fcking blatant lie?	Hate mongering grade C-
@IWasHrren The guy who lied about receiving payments from an adversary, discussing sanctions relief with an adversary, hatching a kidnapping plot of a cleric for millions, wants you to vote everyone
@JPFabricate @alexanderbruz I don't use facebook. Never have. My answer was to your question about why "the left loses their mind"	I'm a Republican that believes in the FIRST amendment so I guess I'm part of the left now. Trump labels anything he doesn't like fake and just adds a 5th grade adjective.
@mike_Zollo Flynn too right?
@alexanderbruz Because Trump's definition of fake news is anything that doesn't serve his ego
@realDonaldTrump "Former U.S. Attorney"		Bahahahaaaaaaaaa
@glenn_ken @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @WhiteHouse @seanhannity @FoxNews @JackPosobiec @OANN He left out any kind of way to quantify it in time so you couldn't call it out as being a blatant LIE		So either he is purposefully being manipulative or is just a fcking idiot. Of course those are not mutually exclusive.
@JackPosobiec Are you gay for him?		Not judging just seems so
@The_Trump_Train Weird, none of the things you listed were mentioned by Trump as being the reason it was revoked		Certainly not bullshit propaganda you're posting		There was a reason tho, and it was a doozy!
@mikandynothem @DonaldJTrumpJr @DineshDSouza @Jamierodr10 @DiamondandSilk @KatTheHammer1 @DonnaWR8 @grizzlemeister @chuckwoolery @Corrynmb @ZibaLady1 Yea! BOOT the guy who lied on his SF86 multiple times!!! WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS AND THAT'S A FELONY!!!		What's that?		Oh, Kushner?		Ah
@FoxNews @continetti Brennan has acted in a way that is unusual		There is no irony noticed in that statement?
@JackPosobiec The point man in the operation to kill Osama being disparaged for Donald Trump. The guy that brought you Trump Steaks Trump University and managed to fail at running a casino. A CASINO, where they give money and you give back nothing
@OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @WhiteHouse @seanhannity @FoxNews @JackPosobiec @OANN Graphics for idiots by an idiot		Something missing from that graphic, do you know what it is?
@DailyCaller @FoxNews @CNN So by definition they are the MSM
@freedom4all117 @joelpollak Oh, really? How about lying on an SF86 multiple times? Say it with me F E L O N Y
@westland_will "commie" huh? Because of his college vote. Just so I'm clear we are judging people by things they did in the 70's and 80's	Hmm, I wonder if there is anything 45 did or stood for in those years....
@joelpollak Ok with Flynn keeping his? How about Kushner after requesting a secret line to Kremlin from Russian amb.?
@leftuntilright @dbongino In an effort to simplify the idiocy I see coming from mindless backing of anyone in power, I use thed the meme'		Enjoy your afternoon
@leftuntilright @dbongino You cite the sanctions but fail to see Trump has fought against his administration to implement them the entire way. Most recent example being his refusal to back the automatic sanctions (that are now months late) after the UK poisoning if Crimea requirements included
@leftuntilright @dbongino Kushner asked Russian amb. for a secret phone line to the Kremlin - security clearance given back		Brennan - critical of Trump, gets clearance randomly revoked		Others in his list of review have one thing in common. Witnesses against him in probe
@dbongino https://t.co/lQlC34a0Xj
@BossSergal @LasVegasLocally @TonyIllia I really want to mock you for having something called a fluff monster but I kind of want one now
@LasVegasLocally @TonyIllia Does someone have a steel beam costume that can record a statement complimenting Trump?
@ramzpaul You're trying to normalize it before it is even confirmed he said it?
@joelpollak @OMAROSA According to Trump or did Burnett (sp?) actually say that?		Penn Jillete just made a statement about it
@rocnhog1 @AnnCoulter A large % are vets
@AnnCoulter More than 1 in 3 are vets
@joelpollak @OMAROSA She accused Trump of knowing about emails prior to release	Ummm...that's straight up coordinating with an adversary and treason if true	That's kind of a big deal coming from a top level staffer, so WH better hope THAT is a lie
@RandPaul What kind of dipshit claims to represent the US and travels to a country currently levying cyber attacks on the US on the 4th of July?		A gd dmn traitor 		The next generation of your fam will change their names in shame
@mrmartinbath @JudgeJeanine Hubby is a crook and convicted felon so likely a long time before she had her circus "opinion" show

@NewmanSA @mfg5ues @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller You keep moving the goalposts. You call things fake with zero factual evidence. "Educator", good grief. I hope you kept flying when you took the Vegas pic and not a former educator in the CCSD.
@FloridaAviator @AnnCoulter We don't, but we know who they were between. Oh, and this		When Grinda was asked whether he was concerned about Torshin's interactions with Trump Jr. and other American political figures, Grinda replied, "Mr. Trump's son should be concerned."
@FloridaAviator @AnnCoulter I do too. That's why it's imperative we allow the investigation to be seen to completion. Will allow the American people to have all the facts.
@FloridaAviator @AnnCoulter The info contained in wiretaps weren't revealed, just the fact they existed and have been sent to US authorities.
@NewmanSA @mfg5ues @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller You need me to google search for you?		No need to pity, just a discussion.	Registered Republican btw, but that really is irrelevant in discussion
@NewmanSA @mfg5ues @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Thanks for definition	Hopefully now we can both say we understand something that has yet to be verified does not make it false.
@NewmanSA @mfg5ues @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Wasn't verified. He was being honest		Guess what, more and more has been verified and *shockingly* nothing proven fake
@FloridaAviator @AnnCoulter If Mueller is fired	The investigation doesn't stop and evidence doesn't disappear. The bread crumbs are out there but it doesn't matter to Trump cult	ie.	https://t.co/yBzA7CCPqK
@NewmanSA @mfg5ues @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Please give me ONE thing that was proven fake		I'll wait
@FloridaAviator @AnnCoulter Critical thinking would include understanding that a special investigator wouldn't release anything mid investigation to pander to conspiracy theorists
@NewmanSA @mfg5ues @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller What fact was revealed?		Hopefully you know what a fact is and this isn't going to be a 101 lesson
@FloridaAviator @AnnCoulter It's an opinion piece, the headline tells me all I need to know "Looks like" means no evidence just conjecture even tho your statement is as if you have factual evidence of your claim		Try some critical thinking
@FloridaAviator @AnnCoulter https://t.co/pMVS1uEnma
@FloridaAviator @AnnCoulter Yea, I opened a bank and you robbed it. Set you up
@NewmanSA @mfg5ues @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Yea, sounds legit and not at all propaganda https://t.co/9olfjMxAUY
@AnnCoulter If he hadn't met with Russians to get stolen information on a political opponent he could have avoided the independent counsel :(		If not keeping up, the first few times he spoke about it were lies and has now openly admitted it
@brithume A shared message regarding a constitutional foundation vs. scripted political propaganda is the same? 		Yikes
@mfg5ues @NewmanSA @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Still not getting thru. 		A phone call to anyone in the media to inform them the Trump campaign is under investigation for conspiring with Russia to get stolen emails is not "outing himself"	Sources are routinely kept anonymous
@VP @Enquirer Manafort was offering positions in the gov. to secure loans for himself		Mr. Vice President,	Remind me again how you came about joining the Trump campaign?
@NolteNC Ok comrade
@mfg5ues @NewmanSA @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller And that was investigated with a 400 page IG report showing zero evidence an effort was made to	You just don't get that he could have released the info to media to crumble his election but kept it under wraps
@FrederickLore13 @PrisonPlanet You think Trump s helping you with your health insurance? Hope nobody in your circle tries to get coverage if they have any preexisting conditions		My health coverage costs me ~35% more in 2018 then the previous year.
@thegoldenpanda7 @PrisonPlanet Sad that in your world "most" Americans don't care that Manafort was offering top US Gov. positions to secure loans to pay off his debts.
@thesprocket @alozras411 @bbusa617 @GartrellLinda @grizzlemeister @PhilMcCrackin44 @KatTheHammer1 @bonniemurphy @carrieksada1 @mikandynothem @LeahR77 @pinkk9lover There is no doubt he was mistaken to have done it on his work phone		There is also no doubt that he could have leaked that Trump election team was under investigation and he did not		Funny how they don't mention the Democrats he also disparaged in his texts isn't it?
@NewmanSA @mfg5ues @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller That's why he withheld releasing information to the public that would have sank his election, is that right?		Take a step back from the propaganda and do some critical thinking
@leftbreen @BobbyRodriguez8 @FoxNews @FLOTUS Hey dumb fuck	Your profile desc.	Put in work, looks like Putin Work	Either intentional or you might be the dumbest motherfucker I've seen on twitter today
@leftbreen @BobbyRodriguez8 @FoxNews @FLOTUS You're telling me you don't even know who that is in my pic?	jfc	We are so fucking screwed
@leftbreen @BobbyRodriguez8 @FoxNews @FLOTUS Me or the guy who took pics with guys rocking nazi tattoos yesterday?
@FrederickLore13 @PrisonPlanet Waste taxpayer money	So laughable	How about a parade? Or a bail out for farmers needed due to lack of negotiating skills on an "easy to win" tariff war	What planet do you live on?
@FrederickLore13 @PrisonPlanet See, that's what's called "moving the goal posts"	Again, pick up a book. Maybe you wouldn't be supporting a dipshit that couldn't make a casino profitable.	You know, they pay you and you give no services in return
@theblaze 5 billion 	Dems already offered more but Trump doesn't want it. He would have nothing left to scare his base with :(
@JudicialWatch Infowars thinks judicial watch is fake news
@kolr10kozl Someone let Kanye know, help is out there
@FrederickLore13 @PrisonPlanet What an idiotic talking point. Pick up a book https://t.co/U73j3Ea57x
@phil200269 You are allowed to have a political opinions in the FBI dipshit		Corrupt colleagues? LOL, what an ingrate you are		FISA warrant wasn't granted because of dossier or renewed because of dossier or renewed again or again due to dossier		Update your 2017 talking points
@mollyfprince In sworn statements, six immigrant teens described instances where they were strapped to chairs and had bags placed over their heads. The review confirmed that the detainment center uses restraints and even mesh head coverings at times	Fucking scum of the earth
@FoxNews @POTUS He loves them!		As long as they don't ever get captured that is		but still!
@LauraLoomer Hard hitting investigative journalism BAHAHA	or	Lonely cat lady hate mongering
@FoxBusiness @POTUS See Mr. President	This is what the fortunate men who weren't ailed with crippling...bone spurs...are able to achieve
@BillHemmer What about the recordings? Already forgot about those?		Trump didn't know she was fired? Yea right. What a cowardly convo that was	Cringe worthy
@AndrewKerrNC @DailyCaller To be fair, the username was "Ben Ghazi"
@nationdivided @TheDemocrats Fun fact	Walk away hashtag was traced back to Russia propagandists
@RealAlexJones Yea, Trump campaign manager is being found guilty in his first of 2 trials
@ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller In America, you can have opinions 		Example: You're a dumb fuck
@alozras411 @bbusa617 @GartrellLinda @grizzlemeister @PhilMcCrackin44 @KatTheHammer1 @bonniemurphy @carrieksada1 @mikandynothem @LeahR77 @pinkk9lover As a reminder		https://t.co/O0cLxS0Elt		But he said he didn't like Trump so "boom"		Fucking sheep
@alozras411 @bbusa617 @GartrellLinda @grizzlemeister @PhilMcCrackin44 @KatTheHammer1 @bonniemurphy @carrieksada1 @mikandynothem @LeahR77 @pinkk9lover So much for free speech	Hope they don't allow your boss to go thru your text messages to see if you ever said anything negative about him/her. I'm sure firing you regardless of whether it affected your work would sure be a "boom"
@RedskinGlen @BluCollar_Guy @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk @codeofvets @ColoradoGirl2A @DonaldJTrumpJr @DineshDSouza @Corrynmb @LeahR77 @DonnaWR8 @KatTheHammer1 Respecting the law? So Kushner should be arrested for lying on his disclosure forms which is a felony, correct?		Lowering unemployment? Study macro trends and get back to me on that		Making countries pay fair share? Any deals finalized? Your taxes are bailing out farmers
@RandPaul @DonHuffines Why? You were too much of puss to do it?
@RealCandaceO Agree		He's the new face of the opioid crisis
@john330ci @dbongino Good one but -5 points 		330ci huh? e90/e92 body style and you get 1 point back
@vincelauro @PrisonPlanet No, the opposite		No immunity, that's the way it was before Trump (regardless of what he regurgitates daily, and the way it should stay
@brithume Complain about misdemeanor immigration law broken 		Ignore Felony committed by WH staffer (SF 86 lies) 		You mean like that?
@vincelauro @PrisonPlanet Im in favor of that		Left or Right, I dont GIVE A F@CK	America first
@michaelbeatty3 @realDonaldTrump Do the crises of America bore you?
@dbongino You mean like Trump does daily on his phone? How about 100+ in WH without proper security clearances? 	This is the point you want to emphasize?
@michaelbeatty3 @realDonaldTrump Wish he would own Flynt MI, Puerto Rico and escalating trade wars
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump You seriously want to play this card with Trump as president?
@vincelauro @PrisonPlanet Lying to an FBI agent is a crime. "Not under oath" doesn't mean diddly 		I don't want to go down this Obama rabbit hole. Fact is he's a private citizen and Trump is the president. Why don't we start with being critical of those currently holding all the power?
@esaagar @POTUS Yea, fuck our elections and the foundation of democracy in the US we need 4 more years of "crooked Hillary" investigations!	No sense in wasting time investigating "Russsher"
@AmadoreJones @PrisonPlanet They are aware and so is most of planet earth outside of this Russian propaganda circle jerk.		There are more than 1 sealed indictments of "unnamed conspirators"	That is another FACT I'm sharing with you and easily verifiable in existing court records
@vincelauro @PrisonPlanet Hilary was investigated multiple times for MANY years. Even sat down and answered Q's without the "perjury trap" excuse. C'mon man		Obama will NEVER be investigated. There's a difference between evidence and conjecture. You need to differentiate between the two
@alkrip_k @PrisonPlanet I'm a Republican who believes in small government, free markets, strength in our allies, and the constitution. Not exploding deficits, tariffs / farmer bailout band aides, and flipping off the parts of the constitution I don't like (emoluments??) Maybe that's a "libturd" nowadays
@FrederickLore13 @PrisonPlanet You understand they don't release evidence mid investigation to appease propagandist? 	In plain sight: Obama met w Saudis in Obama tower, lied about it, got caught, lied again, everything would be fine by you right? Or I'd be brainwashed to defend that?
@AnonSentByQ Cool story		Here in reality immigrants are being rounded up, separated from their children for committing a misdemeanor while your hero has guys like Kushner who committed felonies (SF86 lies) in WH w no clearance		Brainwashed
@vincelauro @PrisonPlanet Crimes continued well into his time as THE CHAIRMAN of Trump campaign		Imagine if Obama met w Saudis to get dirt, had his chairman, deputy director, NSA, multiple policy advisors get arrested and I stood here and defending it		Propaganda is powerful, see things for what they are
@AmadoreJones @PrisonPlanet Agreeing to meet with a foreign adversary to win an election	That's without speculating on the breadcrumbs being left for us by the special counsel. There is a lot, but will bite my lip until we have all facts		It was never about adoptions, they lied, then got caught n lied again
@joelpollak Tariffs, huge government spending and farmer bailouts ring a bell?
@rgeasley @jd_gameon The offer was in writing and has been verified by multiple sources		No idea about the tape, wasn't my question
@kilmeade @foxandfriends He was part of the transition team		I'd say he has a bias		Likely a bit more bias then he runs around yelling everyone else had against the orange ghoul that turned the WH in to a trailor
@GovMikeHuckabee Is it idiocy, blind political cheerleading, familial ties to admin or something more nefarious that has you spouting these vapid talking points when the outcome of this administration is so damn clear?
@Sergeant_Suhor @MightyBusterBro @AppSame @JVER1 @SiddonsDan @ROCKONOHIO @KNP2BP @VFL2013 @deborahjuanita4 @houselm Interesting		Have zero reason to believe someone would get a Nazi tattoo for the above reasons but interesting nonetheless
@NGivasDC @dbongino @NancyPelosi @DailyCaller HAHAHAAHAA		I'm sure all the Nancy hate has nothing to do with Cathy McMorris
@GOP No idiot would ever hire her!		Oh wait...
@DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo Dude I heard your wife did x..y..z		The level of stupidity among your supporters is depressing for America
@PrisonPlanet You retweet Russian government news agencies...
@DavidMDrucker They have anyone recording the pres seems to be a bigger story		It's like the kindergarten admin and no one is in charge		We are letting anything slide now, just pathetic
@RachelStoltz @CNN *gasp*		So the fuck what?
@JasonHamiltonUS @PrisonPlanet If it's anti trump it's left?		Moronic		You know he paid 10 million to settle a money laundering fine at the failed trump taj mahal, RIGHT before he was elected?		Do you know how stupid you have to be to have a casino fail? Get money, give nothing
@LeahR77 Good god do you people actually believe this trite garbage?
@JasonHamiltonUS @PrisonPlanet Planet earth
@MightyBusterBro @AppSame @JVER1 @SiddonsDan @ROCKONOHIO @KNP2BP @VFL2013 @deborahjuanita4 @houselm It's as if he took a pic with a bikers rocking nazi tattoos and said there are wonderful people on "both sides"
@jd_gameon Does it bother you Trump gave her a top position in the white house and offered her 150k per year of your tax money to keep quiet about...? after she left?
@ArizonaKayte Your retirement account is taking a bath with that coffee while you bask in the awesomeness of Trump		World markets are getting destroyed cuz the orange goblin has no idea how to actually negotiate for as much as he talks about how great he is at it
@PrisonPlanet You're the only one still talking about yesterday's protest		Most are waiting for what the Manafort trial reveals about the Orange traitor
@gaye_gallops Latch on to that 	Since half of Trump's admin has either plead guilty or is currently under investigation	'm sure your corruption outrage was just as high with Chris Collins	Here's a dem that was accused of something!
@DRUDGE_REPORT Longshot until team treason entered the WH		Cook ratings are almost unbelievable. GOP latched on to the one moron (who use to be a dem) that could destroy generations of principles
@BillCarson2162 @BarbaraRedgate @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @RepGoodlatte @ChuckGrassley @Jim_Jordan @TheLastRefuge2 Duped how?		There was over a page of disclosure in released FISA that said that dossier was from oppo research. It also showed Nunes was lying about it being the basis of investigation. So it was the judges that were duped and not you?
@BarbaraRedgate @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @RepGoodlatte @ChuckGrassley @Jim_Jordan @TheLastRefuge2 What in the dossier has been proven fake 		Name one claim		Just one		I'll wait
@tessyto @kilmeade @RudyGiuliani @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump 100 criminal charges already filed including CONSPIRING AGAINST THE US		You realize he repeats that over and over ONLY to protect himself 		It's mind numbing people still believe that line with all the corruption it has already exposed
@FoxFriendsFirst @DarrellIssa He's so hated in his district he's not even attempting to run again		Instead he's moving to another district		Can't make this sht up yet your channel just panders to the worst in our country
@ainsleyearhardt @dbongino @foxandfriends Oh, that's weird, cuz it seems like the government took control of free market trading, started giving handouts to farmers to offset that idiotic move and has effectively doubled the deficit.
@DineshDSouza Felon says what?
@BobbyRodriguez8 @johnJAguirre Sniff sniff		Maybe one day I can be somebody! Have a bunch of Russian bots follow me cuz I say dumb shit like MAGA and ignore the world around me		One of these days I'm gunna be somebody!
@kilmeade @RudyGiuliani @foxandfriends "Investigating us"		That's right he was on the transition team 	üòÇ		Oh Jewels, you fucking traitorous pos. The law is coming for ya
@kilmeade @RudyGiuliani @foxandfriends Doesn't strike anyone as odd that someone can record the pres without any oversight? This WH is a threat to every American. But #MAGA, so it's ok
@kilmeade @RudyGiuliani @foxandfriends Bob Mueller may have been awarded medals fighting for this country but I'll go on a media blitz to discredit him and MAGA morons will believe me!
@johnJAguirre @BobbyRodriguez8 Must have been difficult for him to rationalize reality vs. indoctrination		Much easier to block me.		If you stay in the sun long enough your eyes will adjust and no longer sting. Running back in the cave gets you comfy now I guess.
@JohnJamotta @glennbeck @gavinmcinnes Helps distract from Trump taking pics with bikers rocking nazi tattoos
@johnJAguirre @BobbyRodriguez8 beep boop beep		Real conservative bot 	Huge increase in deficit - does not compute	Attacking allies, won't condone Russia - does not compute	Anti open market - does not compute	Porn star family values - does not compute	Pundits side with Putin over war hero - does not compute

@BobbyRodriguez8 @38O9127469 @RegisteredTroll @FoxNews @FLOTUS I don't know what the fuck you're talking about and I'm a Republican		You know, the kind that doesn't like deficits and idiots
@RealJamesWoods Doesn't understand macro trends		But will post dumb fuck memes to appease simpletons		#MAGA
@RegisteredTroll @38O9127469 @BobbyRodriguez8 @FoxNews @FLOTUS I do. I imagine a president who sticks up for us when an adversary has and still continues to attack the core of democracy		Then I wake up to this shit show

@38O9127469 @RegisteredTroll @BobbyRodriguez8 @FoxNews @FLOTUS Oh yea	Well *insert random Russian propaganda talking point* to you too
@joelpollak So proud to have a president that speaks to the lowest common denominator	jfc	Love those Nazi tattoos on his inner arm too I bet

@IngrahamAngle Ingraham calls legal immigrants unwelcome since she didn't get to vote about them coming to the US
@BobbyRodriguez8 @FoxNews @FLOTUS Dude, look in the mirror. You're not welcome there
@FoxNews @FLOTUS Read the fine print		Might need a lawyer after you leave, since it seems a large % of those that have been there recently need one		WTF is happening, the GOP is imploding rght before my eyes and dumbfucks are still trying to scoop buckets out of titanic
@DRUDGE_REPORT Trump is taking himself down	Dragging the GOP with him		Conservative movement will need a fucking decade to rebuild after this shit show		IDIOTS, can't see what is right in front of you and now the left will consume us

@Cernovich What's the relevance of his religion again?
@FoxNews @POTUS @IngrahamAngle Yes, I'm sure they'd impeach him on some slip up and THATS why he won't sit down with Mueller.		Fuck, what a pussy Trump is or he is guilty as fuck
@RealErinCruz @LASDBrink @Brink4Assembly You got this Erin!	Just make sure to use the same hashtags the Russian bots and trolls are and they'll help you to the finish line	MAGA! and walkaway and ICEHumper and whatever other propaganda garbage you can think of!
@PardesSeleh How many Israelis have died in bombings this year? 		How many Palestinians have Israeli soldiers killed?
@DailyCaller LOL		You see that Dems? I'm sure giving healthcare to the poor and covering the already sick would be the same.		You've failed at being humans
@CamEdwards Lol,		This is PROPAGANDA YOU DUMB MAGA DIPSHITS		Fake ass blood in that pic. Has no one ever had a bloody fucking nose or cut their finger? Who believes this garbage?
@IDFSpokesperson Hmm, I wonder if persecuting Palestinians and labeling them, BY LAW, as second tier people w few rights has something to do with it? 	70 rockets huh, let me guess, zero injured. Next headline 50 Palestinians killed
@DRUDGE_REPORT Look and watch that man carefully GOP		That's the guy your betting on	Transition team member Rudy G.	How many Transition team traitors have already gone down for 5 points?
@RealErinCruz @anthonygambino7 @YouTube I'm sure you'll help Cali go from positive net fed funds to negative.	Who will pay for the Red flyover welfare states tho :(

@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Attempt to get info to effect a US election from an adversary is conspiracy, not collusion. Traitor to Donny Jr. in Trump Tower with the candlestick	Lindsey lindsey, you'll forever be known as a spineless fuck wit who stood idle. Shame
@gatewaypundit You realize he was part of the transition team? You realize he said on national television he knew about the stolen emails team treason attempted to get from Russia? If you do, then is your support ignorance or self serving?
@gatewaypundit When you say BOOM and reference something circus attorney Giuliani said, your boom privileges get revoked
@SebGorka Swing and miss		Dude, you look like Steven Seagal's fatter cousin. This isn't a good angle to pick on someone for you
@KimDotcom Yea, how's the GLD trade working out for ya LOL	Bitcoin is a falling knife		I think you should take your shades off and make sure your charts aren't upside down

@DailyCaller There's literally multiple lawsuits for kids being abused sexually in these ICE camps and this is the shit you guys dig out to publish	Fucking scum of the earth
@SebGorka Too bad no proof of bullshit article to push to gullible idiots :(
@StacyLStiles @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Yea, I'm sure they are shaking		Definitely not the co conspirators of the ones who have already been indicted, but poor innocent DJT. I mean who hasn't had to pay a 10 million dollar fine to settle a money laundering fine thru defunct casino RIGHT BEFORE RUNNING FOR OFFICE
@DailyCaller China is in the first stage of an economic crisis	We should probably do something about the burglar that is already in our house before we worry about what the neighbor might do

@FNC_Ladies_Rule @vicenews @mcmoynihan @KennedyNation They also won't have health care and / or will be denied coverage if they have cancer as well as continue living paycheck to paycheck. It's called indoctrination by state TV
@tennyjack99 @AMErikaNGIRLBOT I think they just pointed out the ads in the local craigslist pages advertising. Don't think it was an argument
@AMErikaNGIRLBOT They're investigating actions at a local fair 		Meanwhile another Trump transition team member gets arrested today		üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@D_Eric_L @dbongino You didn't realize that Speaker of the house McConnell had sway over the Republican side of the isle? 	Obama knew if he came out with the info ALONE without Republican support Trump would flail around screaming rigged rigged!	He wouldn't even say he'd accept results if he lost
@dmartosko The fact you don't see the problem says a lot about your character
@michaelkeyes Can you give an example of something that was reported by CNN that was incorrect? Obviously something that wasn't a mistake and later corrected.
@chuckwoolery America dodges bullet by keeping Putin ball licker Chuck Woolery off of television for decades
@D_Eric_L @dbongino Huh? McConnell blocked the effort to go public as he wanted to have a bipartisan approach due to Trump waiving the election is rigged flag from beginning of his corrupt campaign. They also told Team Treason what the Russians were attempting
@WiredSources What's with the fake ass blood in photo? It's obviously photo shopped
@AndrewBVCU @dbongino Wonder if you'd have the same stance if Obama met with UAE in Kenyan towers to get dirt on McCain during his election	Spidey senses makes me thinks not
@AndrewBVCU @dbongino Trumpian slip	I meant "not" letting	üòÇ	Gullible fools
@AndrewBVCU @dbongino LOL, ok, so let's have a parade!		A-Team means they are America's finest and if there was a crime they'll expose it and punish the offender, if there wasn't then they'll provide proof that Trump has been correct in letting it play out without acting like a guilty tangerine.

@stanleybb50 @QuakerNana IKR? Even tho it's documented fact, you'd be a simpleton to believe it!
@stanleybb50 @dbongino Oh, you got me! Quick wit!
@stanleybb50 @dbongino If by elite you mean, not a gullible dipshit, then yes
@AndrewBVCU @dbongino Simple folk indeed. You should follow a few large cases to gain some insight. Can't convict on a crime unless you prove a crime was committed. It's called laying the groundwork 	Do you know who these prosecutors are? They're like the A-team vs. Trump Goof troop
@DRUDGE_REPORT LOL	Or the paper documentation of his crimes may also
@SenDeanHeller I literally thought you ran around trying to put Trump's balls in your mouth all day, so kudos for proving me semi wrong
@dbongino 100 + charges filed = illegitimate 	Your followers are simple folk, aren't they?
@dbongino I know? What an embarrassment bringing people conspiring against the US to justice. Complete bitch hunt
@RStopman @dbongino @Tonya_Smith1021 No, we're passed that. We are at "waiting for proof collusion is a crime"
@CivilityOnly @Robsurfin @YouTube Kewl, let me know how much it grosses. I'm sure it will be up there with Dude bro massacre party 3 and Police Academy 4

@Amberleigh1029 @mattgaetz Oh, sorry, thought it had everything to do your post.	Seriously, pedos? Do you know who Epstein is? You do know there are police reports, former Trump associates, Playmates etc. that all allege Trump abusing teen girls at NYC parties?
@FoxNews No worries, we have patriots like @RandPaul, delivering notes. 	We are so fucked if you morons remaining in GOP don't demand answers
@AmericanSoWoke That's like the stupidest attempt at fear mongering I've seen yet. So, umm, a T-100 will take me to an umm, game show, for ummm, thinking.	If it's @chuckwoolery hosting, well, then I'm a little scared. Pretty sure he's dead and being animated by stray cats at this point
@BustNot You hear that Dems? That's the only way you'll take votes from the candidate that thinks he's a martian (or something too stupid for me to look up again, but yea, for real)
@FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Awesome, more mindless ramblings from one Trump transition team member to a Cohen client!	I wonder who gets indicted first
@DonaldJTrumpJr You should do another little search	Jose Grinda
@Robsurfin @YouTube Dude, nobody watched it to actually put the effort to hate it		If it grosses more than a Steven Seagal movies post weight watchers failure let us know
@RealAlexJones JFC Rog, take off that stupid hat you treasonous little weasel	Bend over cuz America's got a surprise for you
@KipKipkruse880 @NRATV @dbongino ZING!
@NRATV @dbongino HAHAA!	Man Bondingo is an economist too? Wages have gone nowhere	Half the GOP supporters are living paycheck to paycheck while a billionaire from NYC who gave 5 trillion to 400 people are fleecing them
@finneganLAT Wait, what about all the Winning, own the libs and MAGA hashtags rejoicing yesterday's awesome GOP performance :( ?
@jonsered2071 @thecjpearson @Cernovich Or Trump University!
@thecjpearson @Cernovich Yea, if you're an idiot they likely don't want you representing their school. 		Trumpy has done a number on Wharton's rep.
@Cernovich By controversial you mean "conspiracists"? Might be an obvious sign of low intellect and / or easily manipulated?  	Dunno
@LegendaryEnergy Man, I would have never known about the slaves being held on Mars if it weren't for real news from AJ :(
@Amberleigh1029 Ummm...	Arthur Jones 	John Fitzgerald	Paul Nehlen	Steve Stivers	Seth Grossman	@mattgaetz brings Alfred Balitzer to SOTU		Seriously, it's an issue
@w_terrence You have to check the craigslist postings prior to his arrival brah. Your own fault
@ritzkraus @lipstickpundit1 @michaelbeatty3 @AnthemRespect So Trump had to know about Page, Pop, Manafort, Gates, Flynn?	Yet someone who worked for her, who had access to zero confidential information is treasonous? Any concern about 100+ in current WH that didn't hold security clearance?
@michaelbeatty3 You present this as if she knew he was a spy. Did the GOP members going to Russia on July 4th bother you?
@The_Trump_Train I know, I hope all +10 Trump districts end the way last night's did...
@OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods So you're saying the election fraud committee was wrong and are being prevented from voting due to black panthers blocking you?
@Amberleigh1029 Why are so many Nazi sympathizers running under the GOP flag this year?
@glennbeck @benshapiro They hired an American co. to get the info.	Previously working for Republican
@ericbolling Excellent?	Yikes
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @FoxNews Trump could have the entire FISA declassified. You conveniently forget to mention the other 300 pages of evidence you are unable to see. 	Full page on the dossier being political opp, so Nunes was lying about the "footnote" or are you misrepresenting that point as well?	TRAITOR
@JustinRaimondo Russia gate hoax w over 190 criminal charges filed		Mueller's probe stalled? Ummm	Pauly Walnuts trial starts this week	You really should read real news sources
@DailyCaller Someone pushed a guy	What a headline
@TampaHolly @QuakerNana Point is he knew and has been throwing wrenches at the investigation since day 1. 	No, check the timeline, remember what Obama did right before inauguration?
@awaken_to_maga Yea, I'll be waiting patiently....		In the meantime 	NSA, Campaign head, Campaign dept. director, multiple foreign advisors of Team treason have been arrested. Any minute now tho, one of the conspiracy theory names will go down...any minute...a few more min
@FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Yea, that "America was foolish" for allowing Russia to launch cyber attacks wasn't a good look. 1 on 1 making deals without rest of admin knowing not so much either. Witch hunt over and over when he had proof of attack, well you get the idea
@awaken_to_maga Yawn	Weird only members of Trump admin seem to be getting arrested....#MAGA I guess?	Keep holding your breath for Obama, Clinton, Pelosi, Uranus 1, unmasking, memogate or whatever you're gaslighting with this week.	Oops, I meant "not" gaslighting
@DRUDGE_REPORT Shocker, Putin is reading off the same card as Trumple Treason skin
@TruthMaga Glad your God is working cuz HOG soon won't be in the U.S. leaving more than a few without work
@awaken_to_maga Spoiler alert	It's Russia	This account is gaslighting	Walkaway hashtag was confirmed as being started by Russian trolls
@charliekirk11 Let's talk about FOREIGN AGENTS not foreign nationals or nah?		Ok with sending American diplomats to adversaries as fodder? Pathetic excuse for an American
@DailyCaller Will I say stuff like Russher and WITCH HUNT followed by a word salad ramblings of a mentally deficient ghoul?
@chuckwoolery By calling America foolish?		Even RT thinks you're a fcking idiot		https://t.co/ashCSamdaS
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump HAHAHA!	Man some delusional fuck wits being mind fcked by this Russian propaganda handle
@realDonaldTrump Release the pedo tape!	YOU ARE FCKED
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump I AGREE, IT IS MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING. TRAITOR IN @WhiteHouse
@caitoz Ok. Keep spinning and spinning. If you can't see what's happening you'll have to wait and look back. Nice talk.

@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA ACCOUNT MAGA IDIOTS
@FoxNews @newtgingrich Yes Newt, by calling America foolish on the national stage he really showed them!	Being given intel weeks before the election and doing his best to muddy the investigation screams patriotism!	#MAGA	FCK YOU YOU TRAITOR POS
@FoxNews @SenMikeLee @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight Russian influence peddlers	FCK ALL OF YOU
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Why are conservatives ok with sending American diplomats to Russia to be interrogated?
@planoldtired @RandPaul @TuckerCarlson Comrade Paul believes America was foolish and was at fault for their cyber attack. He presented his a.nus for their taking on July 04th as a gesture of submission
@caitoz k		https://t.co/u0UJjU1Dqy
@foxandfriends Even RU thinks we missed one		https://t.co/UwUtBS23IL
@rzvsrm @_ImperatorRex_ @ellenmfanning @SebGorka You assume I did. Just passing thru warning people that like Medusa and stone Gorka dialogue will make you less intelligent. Universally accepted phenomenon.
@caitoz You understand how a plea deal works. Label it as a process crime if it makes you feel better but he was looking at a lifetime in prison.
@Johnnyu321 @theblaze It was a disaster for any real American 	Blaming us for Russia's attack? Trump is a pu$$y
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Laura is for sending American diplomats to Russia to be prosecuted
@theblaze Gallup hasn't been below 45 in months. It is now. Citing a single poll is...mmm...not really giving the full story
@theblaze Derrr, ya think?	"It's our fault Russia attacked us" 	Who would think saying that over and over again would be bad?
@_ImperatorRex_ @ellenmfanning @SebGorka Would have to be a nobody to give a fuck what Gorka says
@foxandfriends @TezlynFigaro @danielalarik @politicalelle @Gruntstyle @jessicaanntyson @authorsmcewen @GovMikeHuckabee @Varneyco @wwp @RepKevinYoder @realbobmassi Hooray! Making Russia great again üòç		Hopefully Massi has some Vegas experience with 45 to know what the fck is going on
@caitoz Some corruption? The NSA has pled guilty. "Some corruption"	There's a reason Pence was in Ecuador last week. His attempt failed. Remember who brought Pence to the team? Pauly Walnuts. He's in prison now	Stay tuned, things will unfold very fast now after dumbfck in Helsinki
@caitoz A few things have come of it already		https://t.co/T9qEw0Bo6j
@caitoz Would be great if the investigation wasn't being obstructed with bullshit like "memogate" "unmasking" "documentgate" and any other thing they can throw at Mueller to stop the gd dmn thing. 	I'll happily eat crow if nothing comes of the investigation...oh wait...
@caitoz Again, I thought he was an idiot and I was proven right. You know the old saying, fool me twice and you won't fool me again.
@caitoz Trump on the other hand...well he's been a joke in the business world for decades. Figured he'd at least surround himself with good people, but they've all been indicted.
@caitoz I never hated Bush, I just thought he was an idiot. The whole great recession thing made me a bit bitter. The more you had the more you lost.
@caitoz Noted.	Senior can not be allowed to interfere with citizens getting the full breakdown of the facts then a statement like that can carry water. For now, it's just a guess on your part.
@caitoz I'm a Republican Caitlin. You know, conservative values, fiscal responsibility, free markets kind of guy. This isn't politics, this is a fight for democratic foundations.	https://t.co/Tjy8wtTASB
@caitoz Except he did	https://t.co/shbcY9Weh5
@caitoz No, I was 100% the other direction actually. 		Blown away after W was re elected. Remember that headline " Can 50 million Americans be this stupid"? Or something along those lines.
@caitoz X of course being the P tape. As in Pedo tape. Epstein ring a bell?
@caitoz Nah, Kremlin was knocking at the door the entire time. They just kept answering it. GRU has a file on Trump and they knew if they could get in the door they could use it against him. Bait and switch. We're your friend, let us in, now that we're here you'll remove sanctions or X
@caitoz Fair enough. skepticism is healthy. At this point in the story I just don't think it's warranted.
@caitoz It's not an argument. Facts are facts. You realize they have had more interactions with Kremlin representatives than the Tower meeting, right?		https://t.co/ksqXzMRZ0t
@caitoz If I don't laugh I'll have to cry about how such a large portion of our population could be so gullible to believe a second rate criminal and ghoul of a man.
@caitoz The minute they turned to an adversary during a presidential election it was game over. Their intent on specific materials matters little
@caitoz Then move to Russia?  üëã		Assuming not there already of course
@caitoz He's colluding in plain sight. Trump tower meeting was COLLUSION. It doesn't have to be successful to be a crime. Read the NY times article. FROM TODAY ffs
@caitoz Keep drinking the kool aide and passing it out to your gullible followers. The international intel that keeps your ass safe you do not get to read about. Sit and bash till your heart's content.
@caitoz Here's a headline to go with the US Dept of Treasury filing üòÇ	https://t.co/HXlx54cBN0
@caitoz Haha! Iraq? Had to go back a bit to get a whatabout on that one eh?		I'll up your what about with what Team Treason was doing just before his election bid		https://t.co/dvUfT5A6HE
@irysslandnu Why do you think that is? Maybe because of bullshit narratives being pushed by Fox (identical to RT, coincidence I'm sure) and MAGA morons.		https://t.co/c0LE7Lfomj
@caitoz Hahaha		Nope. INTERNATIONAL IC	So CIA, FBI, NSA and international IC bad guys, Trump the good guy.	BAHAHA	Bless your heart comrade. That's a tough sell
@F_Shadow_Bans @theblaze https://t.co/DBxkMcuQmo
@F_Shadow_Bans @theblaze 2017 wants its talking points back. A bit more than that was done / still ongoing by Trump's bff		https://t.co/4OwVImo5Qr
@caitoz LOL	Umm, Russian spy in court sweetheart. Her handler was Torshin. Remember the wiretaps IC in Spain sent over or nah?	NYTIMES fcking today. Trumpster knew it was Russia and has spent his entire term trying to cloud the investigation. What's the word for that?
@irysslandnu Convoluted way to make a bullshit point. "Speaking a few words" is what this is based on? Riiight. JFC	Any actual Americans left supporting Trump or just Russian troll farm employees?
@caitoz LOL	What are we at like 70+ charges filed? Including Trump's NSA, campaign chair, deputy chair, multiple foreign advisors. Oh and the whole "it's America's fault" statements made over and over standing next to Putin was awesome. 	"Pure narrative"
@BBCBreaking Maybe Trump can go on air and say it's America's fault
@zesty_texas Pfff, chump change. That's like 2 desks and a new office door in US politics.
@DailyCaller Yea, peeps don't take kindly to sympathizing with enemies of the US round them there parts
@foxandfriends https://t.co/PWX5A0FvFg
@theblaze Yea TRUMP, why did you back away from the "It's America's fault" line you kept spewing out! We need you to tell us how it's our fault RU levied a cyber attack on us in front of Putin!		Seriously tho...fck ALL OF Y'ALL
@AdrianWapcapIet @washingtonpost We'd have to look wayyyy back to...[checks notes]...the Bush admin to have known!!!

@Amberleigh1029 Don't take their word or mine, just research the phrase yourself "Qanon Israeli Psyops" there has been at least 5-6 decent articles written about it.
@OnlyPartially @Jazz11001 @FoxNews Can't hold someone's lack of education against them. Sht is expensive. 		We must welcome their ignorant butts back to reality with open arms!

@EstefaniaRobin2 @realDonaldTrump @abcnews Have you guys not figured out Qanon is an Israeli psy-ops group yet?
@DailyCaller When he said Putin's attack was America's fault		Mega burnnnn!
@Jazz11001 @FoxNews 1. Nothing in dossier has been proven to be fake. Not. one. thing.	2. To your question, NSA, CIA, FBI as well as international IC.	Womp womp
@FoxNews Womp womp		There it is folks. He had direct info and has been working to hide, misdirect and cloud the integrity of that information. There's a word for it...not conspiring...hmm what could it be?
@FoxNews @JesseBWatters Nah, just supporting our IC as well as international intel community in winning a cyber war started by one of our adversaries. Don't worry Jess, your kids will have a chance to change their last name to hide their embarrassment.
@FoxNews @POTUS Aww that's so nice of them!	FCK THEM AND FCK YOU. We do not and have never needed their assistance with shit. They are our enemies and are against everything the US stands for.
@RealAlexJones Yes, yes AJ. Unfortunately when the pedo tape Putin is holding over his head comes out,  (you know, with his bud Epstein), might make things complicated
@DailyCaller Except his daily actions :(
@PoliticalShort How many Republicans voted against funding election protection today Shorty?
@RunningDeep67 @ShaunaGee @Cernovich Nah, simply not blaming America for a foreign adversary levying information warfare on the US would have been suffice.

@riterick @_ImperatorRex_ Why not go to fivethirtyeight and get the aggregate of ALL polls? Traitor fck was in Russia on 7/4. Oh, the BIPARTISAN Senate report came out about Russia this week, did you notice that? How about the new novichok poisonings? Blinded by the propaganda you consume.
@lorileach14 @mike_Zollo Lori,	Take a few minutes and look up what the clothing line Zara is infamous for. Any reason that MT allowed the press, the one time she wore their $30 garbage bag coat, to film her arrival / departure? $50k coat Monday, $30 coat Tuesday, right.
@riterick @_ImperatorRex_ Trump is winning over no one. He has his base that see him as unable to do anything wrong but has lost any self respecting traditional conservatives. Party will die under Trump. For every high profile dem that's gone to the GOP (zero?) I can name 10 that have left the GOP

@FoxFriendsFirst @DougLuzader Isn't there a large BMW plant in SC? Are they that simple they would cheer taxing of a manufacturing plant that employs thousands?
@LetzBrealistic Letz,	Step back and actually look at the numbers, you'll see the aphorism applied differently. You've been indoctrinated to believe you are hearing the sound of zebras at our Southern border.
@SlackerX @_ImperatorRex_ @ThomasWictor @HollywudHeather She's not wrong		Stephen Hawking said basically the same thing
@shafer_janelle @FoxNews C'mon Janelle	You know that has been debunked 500 times. There's a reason Fox stopped pushing that conspiracy.	If they did something wrong then all Trump would need to do is file a report with the FBI. He hasn't and he won't.
@shafer_janelle @FoxNews The picture in my profile is a photo taken shortly after Comey was fired, when Trump admittedly gave the Russians, a foreign adversary that has launched a cyber war, sensitive gov. info. Did you know that?
@shafer_janelle @FoxNews It was investigated tho, multiple times, and there were zero indictments.	If the current ongoing investigation leads to Kushner being indicted and subsequently found innocent then I'll respect that and know I was wrong.	We've spent millions investigating those claims.
@shafer_janelle @FoxNews Beautiful Blue nose btw!	I have a fawn blue nose	110lbs of pure laziness
@shafer_janelle @FoxNews It's not an accusation or an attack. Lying on an SF86 is a felony. 		Yes, seriously
@CiejkaJen @DailyCaller Jen,	The media has always had a contentious relationship with sitting presidents. That is how we citizens are reassured those in power are not abusing their power.
@shafer_janelle @FoxNews I can respect that.		No need to be belligerent and resort to personal attacks.
@gbhsgbhs @FoxNews No, the straight up felons name is.
@MacUidhir @KokeReport @POTUS @HillaryClinton Telling it like it is and attacking are not synonymous. 		Having a prez that unites the country rather than works on dividing us daily and having the majority of Americans support that philosophy is wishful thinking I suppose.
@swayneco @FoxNews I can agree with that, just stats
@FoxNews No, what Kushner did was a felony.
@smoss319 Yes, I can't remember a time when we were not as united as we are now. Trump routinely sends positive and uniting messages DAILY!
@VetApologist @ROHLL5 Who's a traitor?
@ROHLL5 Who will exactly? The subcommittee staff member? Or are you insinuating McCain will?
@les_izmoore @KamalaHarris https://t.co/robEnWhQWt
@BlueSea1964 This post is b.s. to incite division. Propaganda pushers don't even need to try that hard or what?
@FoxNews Unfortunately the MAGA movement consists mainly on uneducated white population. That's not a diss, it is what it is. Irony is the a lot of the policies hurt them the most. Such is politics.
@RealJamesWoods How's your IRA in 2018? With these new "conservative" party taxes? err I mean tariffs,
@mike76139 So you're outraged about Kushner's SF86 lies? Multiple felonies you know? How about Wilbur Ross lying on fed disclosure forms? His insider trading exposed by Forbes last week? Or we only follow laws that play to our fears by propaganda?
@LoriinUtah How about fixing immigration? Maybe punishing those who hire them? You know the whole pull the weed by the root idea? A wall in archaic. This the 21st century, that's the best idea? A freaking wall?
@plantlady293 God forbid you hear an opposite opinion and make your own judgements on each issue
@TrumpSupport13 @KamalaHarris Propaganda		What was the Sessions policy about? What did the admin go on record several times saying would be a deterrent?
@mike76139 BTW, I don't live in CA. Just pointing out a fact  		https://t.co/8pmby0uhXb
@mike76139 No need to argue a point that is easily researchable Mke.
@FoxNews @POTUS Why did Trump put a silence on the S. Korean+US training back when the full pressure campaign was in effect? During the "little rocket man" tweets.		Seems counterintuitive to "full pressure". Surely nothing to do with Putin suggesting it, correct?
@mike76139 Fool is not capitalized.	So that means you do understand the difference?
@mike76139 Curious	You don't believe he's done anything wrong or simply indifferent because he's part of this admin?
@RodStryker @cubsb4bears @CoreyLMJones @POTUS While blaming the "enemy" of all that you do.		https://t.co/XDHuhrdOV2
@RodStryker @cubsb4bears @CoreyLMJones @POTUS So then what was the Sessions policy that was signed in Spring?
@NoahPollak How many Palestinians were shot? How many Israeli soldiers were even injured?		But here's a story about one guy from some no name bullsht "news" source!
@Phishie_Philly @GovMikeHuckabee By lying and gaslighting?
@mike76139 Not outraged at Pruitt?
@DDonsmith007 The problem being ol' Nunes was a part of the transition team and is feeding those investigated the information. At what point is it obstructing exactly?
@SiddonsDan @AP4Liberty @KyleKashuv Is this about the emoluments clause that Trump wipes his ass with?
@LizLiz_Di @SiddonsDan @POTUS @conservmillen Because it's b.s. propaganda Liz
@SiddonsDan @POTUS @conservmillen This poll is propaganda to incite hate		100's of poll takers all graded on fivethirtyeight. This is nothing but b.s.
@FoxNews @AGPamBondi Such strength!		Don't let the libs grab you by the p*ssy! They're such bullies
@DDonsmith007 Unless they weren't smart enough to be born in the US	Then we just don't give a f*ck
@mike76139 You do hopefully understand the difference, correct?
@mike76139 California is a net positive state that pays for fly over Red welfare states
@John_KissMyBot @AMErikaNGIRLBOT Yes, such 21st century thinking. A wall
@Jeanniecraig15 @PolishPatryot @JLPtalk Fake accounts, fake stories Jeannie. There is a reason the current echo chamber you are in share the same talking points as Russia. 		Conservative movement is dead and will need rebuilding after this disaster, this is the party of Trump
@DanCovfefe1 @grizzlemeister @AnnaApp91838450 @KatTheHammer1 @ClintonMSix141 @MareLovesUSA00_ @GemMar333 @stacy_redvirgo @RealMAGASteve @Trumperland @rektredpill LOL		Seriously....seriously? https://t.co/R19o4JqabT
@KokeReport @POTUS @HillaryClinton Does he ever give a speech where he doesn't attack anyone?
@RuthieRedSox @RubyRockstar333 @ArizonaKayte @USAHotLips @Fuctupmind @StacyLStiles @jojoh888 @PhilMcCrackin44 Good one! 	Forget the foreign adversaries who have launched a cyber war against the US, let's talk gossip mag columns and make cute memes!
@FoxNews @PressSec Yes, the outrage!		Trump sends harassing tweets all day. Twitter bully
@DailyCaller Trying to think of one that didn't purposefully divide Americans. Will get back to you on that.
@Trumperland @FascistTwatter @rektredpill @MrKimbles @DanCovfefe1 @grizzlemeister @AnnaApp91838450 @KatTheHammer1 @ClintonMSix141 @MareLovesUSA00_ @GemMar333 @stacy_redvirgo @RealMAGASteve Can't believe someone didn't grab her by the p**ssy, where is the civility?		Americans should not be allowed to protest
@zedism @nikolaiasmodai @SusanWi31620743 @DaliaChai @charliekirk11 @veritaz @FoxNews @BreitbartNews @ShepNewsTeam Bret's not bad, Shep is owed respect but once the "opinion" shows hit and they start using sophomoric adjectives to describe everything, i.e. "terrible, dirty, fake" etc. it officially becomes tin foil hat time.
@AnOpenSecret @iamfonda @sonyclassics @POTUS @AmazonStudios @CarltonCuse It was going to be a blockbuster prior to ignorant statement....right?
@LisaMei62 He is the president, isn't he? He's asking us if it is being investigated?	I'm sure it's not nonsense to rile up his base, it can't be that.
@StacyLStiles You understand the difference, right?
@LegendaryEnergy Who called you that and what triggered it?
@AngelaClar1 @anntensity @AnnCoulter Can you give an example of anyone calling for open borders?
@MsMaxwell6 @lynn_weiser @starcrosswolf @AppSame @sxdoc @GartrellLinda @RealMAGASteve @Trump454545 @DonnaWR8 @KNP2BP @LVNancy @pinkk9lover @FriendlyJMC Random articles to help prove blanket statements for the ignorant.		Customs gov site has facts in case anyone was wondering
@esaagar @POTUS Yes, uses his uncanny ability to make Americans hate each other
@The_Trump_Train @IngrahamAngle The Russians are also trying to discredit Mueller Laura. Does sharing the same talking points and fanning internal divisiveness among Americans intrigue you? Or just waiting until too late and will repent then?
@LouDobbs @RepAndyBiggsAZ Lou,	I know you're ancient but we're in a cyber war and we are losing. That may be a bit more important than this wonderful 21st century idea about a wall
@sillyme64663664 @tictoc Glad Trump reopened NASA!!!....üòÇ
@esaagar @POTUS Nothing more normal than a vanity obsessed 70 year old	Man is a ghoul https://t.co/XEvpwSLmf2
@OnPlanetDiscord @JoAnninna @dashman76 @realDonaldTrump Yes, I see him keeping his friends close and enemies closer everyday! Does that mean the Dems are his friends and the GOP is the enemy?
@JoAnninna @dashman76 @realDonaldTrump Only a genius can have a casino go bankrupt 3 times and pay millions in money laundering fines just before he was elected.
@SkidMarks10 @DailyCaller What does Obama have to do with this new policy? You're assuming I'm a democrat and trying to justify inhumane policy. Suddenly need "camps" built because of Obama?	With advanced notice they are not allowing oversight in to these shelters? They didn't keep track of whose kids?

@OliverMcGee @RealVinceJames Good job Oliver		Now if only your dimwitted ass knew the outrage was about separating families that commit misdemeanors. Not felonies like Kushner did lying on his SF-86		Keep the fight on brotha, Central park five was a while ago anyway

@KimDeaBueno @Lrihendry Nobody cared, riiiight		It's not the fact that these tent camps are being opened and NOT ALLOWING LAWMAKERS IN to do oversight		Not troubling at all?
@Truly_Southern1 @KimDeaBueno @Lrihendry Audio was recorded without permission. That's how we found out how bad things really are. Now the government facilities are having to be crowdsourced by people catching them moving kids in the middle of the night. I.E. last night at 12am in NYC	Meanwhile Trumpers don't GAF anyway
@Lrihendry Oh you mean they're not?		So why are we building large tent cities? Fake news right?

@lorileach14 @mike_Zollo Totally! I mean it is a misdemeanor, and lying on your SF-86 like ol Kushy did is a FELONY, but "it's the illegality". Got it. 	Definitely not thinly veiled racism and irrational fear pushed on to you by nationalist propaganda. It's def the illegality.
