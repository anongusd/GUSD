Thank you @kamalaharris for questioning #WilliamBarr on harsh sentencing laws. She's right. Communities of color have always wanted public health response to drug epidemic, not lock-em-up response.
This is #WilliamBarr last year on immigration: 		"Jeff Sessions did outstanding job in attacking the rampant illegality that riddled our immigration system &amp; breaking the record for prosecution of illegal entry cases."  		We don't need this &amp; we don't want this.
During Bush administration, we used DOJ nomination hearings as oversight. It was our only chance. 		Where is oversight here? It‚Äôs not only about nominee‚Äôs record. It‚Äôs what he will do in job. #WilliamBarr must commit to reversing every Sessions‚Äô policy undermining civil rights.
Bar for AG confirmation should not be lowered to level of Jeff Sessions or Matthew Whitaker. Instead, it should be raised to level of Robert Kennedy &amp; Nicholas Katzenbach, who first enforced our modern civil rights laws.		We deserve an Attorney General committed to civil rights.
Thanks @corybooker for focusing on #WilliamBarr's obsession w/increasing our prison population. Yes, most people are incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses. But he's still angling to charge more people &amp; supports Sessions' charging policies.
.@corybooker questions #WilliamBarr on racial disparities in criminal justice system. Barr says, "Overall, the system treats blacks and whites fairly. " 		We strongly disagree. And we need an AG who understands racism in justice system.

Today, GOP holding  #StealthHearing while Congress in recess. 9th Circuit nominee Eric Miller has record of hostility to Native Americans. Meanwhile, there's only one Native American federal judge in entire country. We believe judges should reflect every community.
Senate engaged in huge dereliction of duty by considering nominees to nation's largest circuit court while Senators are home for recess. If you live in AK, AZ, CA, HI, ID, MT, NV, OR or WA, need to stay tuned. Don't let Trump infect your circuit court. #SaveTheNinth

Today's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing is unprecedented bc Senate officially in recess. Also extremely rare bc African-American nominee considered. Rodney Smith, up for FL seat, is only 3rd Black nominee of over 160 Trump nominees.
North Carolinians should ask this of @SenThomTillis, who's chairing Senate hearing today. Thousands of lawyers in NC who would be honored to occupy NC seat on 4th Circuit. Why did Trump pick white DC lawyer to replace only Black woman on 4th Circuit?
7 Black women on circuit courts when Trump took office; now only 4. Yet Trump hasn't nominated one Black woman to judgeship anywhere. Today, he's replacing NC's Allyson Duncan on 4th Circuit w/white woman who's never practiced law in NC. Outrageous.
NC hard hit by Trump judicial nominations: 1) White supremacist Thomas Farr nominated to Eastern District, where many African Americans reside. 2) White nominee Allison Rushing picked for 4th Circuit seat held by Black female. #Injustice

A8: In the words of @IssaRae ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre rooting for everybody black.‚Äù There are multiple shows and movies that have gotten it right and we will continue to celebrate positive representation of our community in the arts and media. #PSBHM https://t.co/HqtDqfjOFw
A7: Unfortunately, the media has played too big a role in exacerbating colorism in Black communities. While some brands are making efforts to be more inclusive, the media industry as a whole should not see diversity as a fad, but as an ethical necessity. #PSBHM https://t.co/us6EL2ktJN

A6: We are the ones best equipped to share our stories and we must continue to do so at every turn. Not only in print and the big screen, but in our schools, our local city council meetings, and friend groups. No one is more qualified to share our experiences than we are.  #PSBHM

A5: Black people are crucial in bringing our stories to life behind the lens and on the big screen.

RT @POPSUGAR: Q4. Do you believe there is a colorism problem in depictions of the black community? #PSBHM
A4:This is a step in the right direction, we must continue sharing our creativity with the world. As @Ava recently shared, ‚ÄúChange comes when there‚Äôs not just one black person at the helm, but a diversity of folks all throughout the industry, including on the set.‚Äù  #PSBHM

A3: We should see color-blind casting in Hollywood but we should also have color blind story-telling in mainstream media outside of what is considered the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù. It‚Äôs great to see Black actors on the big screen, but we need Black people in the boardroom,  etc..  #PSBHM
