@MichaelAvenatti I don't  understand how this is going to work. You find place large enough to safely handle this many people, then somehow they all get to the staging area, they work to reunite parents with children and then what? Where do they go?
@cryborg @MichaelAvenatti When the electoral college voted for Trump he became the legal POTUS. The government can't  go backwards. It must move forward and impeach him then remove him from office or vote him and his party out of power.
