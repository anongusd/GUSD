With great power comes great responsibility. Do we want to be a nation of stunted, twisted juveniles with the economic and cultural power to plunge the world into darkness? Or are we going to grow up and lead the world as only we can. IDK man. I just don't know...
Tyrants and corrupt leaders ape Trumps corrosive propaganda. While using the most brutal tactics against their own people. America for all the flaws of her past IS better than this, shout out @RepCummings for the reminder. And we are at a crossroads.
And democracy pays the price. People are being murdered. White nationalism as a terrorist threat is surging. #JamalKhashoggi brutally murdered and dismembered. Men inspired by Trumps twisted criminal ideology plot mass murders against Trumps enemies.
Both here and across the globe. He's a magnet for scum. His presidency was the second coming of Jesus for every douche relegated to the periphery of power in America. They've flocked from every sewer &amp; toilet to "#MAGA". Looting the treasury, positioning themselves for windfalls.
Trump is a sad, pathetic commentary on America. On the people that voted for such greedy, venal bigot. A man who never hid, is incapable of hiding, who he really is.	Now his ability to amplify his twisted methods and ideology is emboldening men like him.
The tragically dangerous thing is, he's so wrong. He's wrong in the way that leads to people being killed as these savvy monsters, toy with an American president who is a simpleton. A president whose innermost thoughts and motivations are as easy to read as a flashcard.
He thinks he's just like them, so he lavishes them with praise. He "takes them at their word" that they "dindunuffin". And if he can keep the "po-po" [his OWN intelligence community] out his business, he can make that big deal, he hungers for, a reality.
He believes the old rules and mores of criminal culture will allow him to succeed, where others before him could not. He thinks his criminal nature gives him a negotiating advantage, because he "gets them".
He transferred this twisted, juvenile need for the power and exhilaration that comes from proximity and respect of dangerous men to the most heinous human beings of the modern world. Putin. Duterte. Kim. The Saudis. And on and on.
Most of those men are dead or in jail or leading very different lives. The rest of us grew up. Got educated. Got jobs. Made families. Got clear about right and wrong. Trump didn't. He made this criminal culture a way of life.
Knowing or being associated with these men could be a kind of force field of protection. It could prevent theft, bullying or even be a way of making money. NY was a tough place. Whether you were from the streets or born into privilege many of us were shaped by this culture.
Gaining the respect of these dangerous and even evil men, even if you didn't do the things they did, could make you feel powerful. It was exciting, to be around them or to be able to name drop them.
Some, like Trump emulated this model professionally. Creating gangs &amp; businesses that integrated and emulated mafia mores. Many of us were excited to be in the presence of our be in proximity to dangerous men, who might be friends or family or acquaintances.
Trump like a lot of us who grew up in NYC, is both fascinated by and drawn to the mafia mystique. It was part of street culture. In the music, choices of entertainment and worst of all aped in social interactions. https://t.co/k8qwTzWR8r

@sheep_social @marclamonthill @ninaturner @docrocktex26 Which we saw after historic Congressional losses in '10. Which we also see in the importance that @gop places on depressing votes, restricting ballot access and outright fraud. In the face of this, if Bernie runs on the same strategy, it's tantamount to political malfeasance.
@sheep_social @marclamonthill @ninaturner @docrocktex26 Regardless with dual control of Congress this 'centrist' was able to pass healthcare, initiate DoJ reforms directly affecting CoC &amp; jump start the path to renewable parity. Without Democrat commitment to increasing the electorate, a Democrat president is hamstrung.
@sheep_social @marclamonthill @ninaturner @docrocktex26 Almost. A progressive left Congress can move issues to the forefront and even force a recalcitrant or hesitant president to confront issues that are the will of the majority of the country. For me Obama highlighted this reality. Many frame him as a corporate centrist.
@sheep_social @marclamonthill @ninaturner @docrocktex26 I understand. I agree somewhat. I too am keeping an open mind and voting on issues. But my lesson learned is that the presidency almost second to control of Congress, state and local legislatures and positions of influence.
@sheep_social @marclamonthill @ninaturner Honestly, I don't expect him to do it. To quote @docrocktex26 "his terminal blindspot for voters of color is baked into the cake". He believes the winning strategy is an appeal to the WWC almost to the exclusion of all else.

@Twitwit08270216 Understood. How do we achieve parity with groups whose concerns seem to be more "prominent" in the democrat party platform?
One thing I've learned in the last 10 years is how limited the office of the presidency is to affect social and economic change WITHOUT a supporting cast in Congress, in governorships, dedicated activists and on.
John Conyers was the lone voice years, introducing and re introducing a study commission bill. It went nowhere. Maybe it's time for the #ADOS movement, (that aren't bots, or malefactors) to play the inside game. Run candidates. In the House, the Senate, state legislatures.
Maybe they thinking if Trump gets reelected he'll sure black folks get they money we're due so they should divide the democrat base? Me, I say take a hint from the progressive shift. Identify and support grass roots candidates who believe in it.
I wonder how my brothers and sisters trumpeting the #ADOS affiliation think they will achieve their aims? Attempting to sink any and every Democrat who don't straight up make cash reparations a platform policy?

@wingod @rocketrepreneur 'Perfectly viable'üòÇüòÇüòÇ ok.
@wingod @rocketrepreneur This isn't true. While there are some older plants online, they are only so, because of safety and designs upgrades, that have been costly. You make a lot of sweeping generalities about a dangerous technology.
@wingod @rocketrepreneur And nuclear is definitely worth about look. At scale &amp; as part of a mix, not the go to replacement. But we SHOULD be relentlessly focused beyond it as well. Nuclear is the quantum equivalent of mining coal. It's dirty. There are cleaner, higher energy output tech's in our future.
@wingod @rocketrepreneur And mistakes have cost the US BILLIONS. Many old design plants were accidents waiting to happen. There's also no storage solution that can make everyone happy. But I do care about the environment--a great deal--and I have looked at the issue and newer reactor designs.
@wingod @rocketrepreneur Lol, we did and many of those plants couldn't re license because being evolving safety standards would cost billions or they were located next to population centers or the turn of public opinion after 3-mile, Chernobyl and Fukushima. Fission is a highly volatile tech.
@wingod @rocketrepreneur And once again, nuclear should be a stop gap and only that--on the way to fusion. In fact I would have added a moonshot investment in fusion development to the #GreenNewDeal
@wingod @rocketrepreneur The two are not the same. One doesn't rush into handling a potential WMD, with a deadly radioactive waste output because it reduces reliance on fossil fuels. There were many technological paths the US could have taken. However now is an appropriate time to take another look.
@wingod @rocketrepreneur Any human death from energy cultivation is unacceptable, but there have been similar deaths from radiation before we fully understood how to harness it safely. We even used radioactive paints in pottery for some time. Current wind mill designs already reduce much of this risk.
@wingod @rocketrepreneur But nuclear tech has evolved. Plants can be smaller, more efficient and far, far less dangerous current designs. Definitely time for another look, but I would hedge by saying it should be a stop gap as we look to the development of fusion.
@wingod @rocketrepreneur There have been few deaths in the US, but not zero. Frankly we've dodged a bullet, given the cumbersome design of older generation plants. 2/3rds of nuclear accidents have US origin. Moratorium was prudent given the scale of risk.

@CraigMinns @estarianne @neverjaunty @monaeltahawy More specious bullshit. Black men are not in a similar bucket with white men, despite issues of misogyny being prevalent in the black community. This comparison is specious on its face.
@CraigMinns @estarianne @neverjaunty @monaeltahawy Well, an open sore is healed when you address the underlying infection, which is the bigotry, misogyny and xenophobia and the fact that they have been over or implicit policy for generations. Not talking about it, not directing policy to address it meaningfully is a moral crime.
@CraigMinns @estarianne @neverjaunty @monaeltahawy Unfortunately the truth is far from your idealistic pining. We live in a country with deeply institutionalized in inequalities for Black people and women generally. Only a concerted effort of political and moral will can change it.
@CraigMinns @estarianne @neverjaunty @monaeltahawy Funny cause you sound exactly like a FOOL. Equality for you is being an equal opportunity abuser of anyone is what it sounds like.
@CraigMinns @neverjaunty @estarianne @monaeltahawy FALSE equivalence. Demanding sovereignty and self agency and equality when you've been denied it historically IS NOT JIM CROW and IS a dumb ass comparison.
@neverjaunty @CraigMinns @estarianne @monaeltahawy White Americans like the ones commenting here see it as a threat. How is equality a threat? How is recognizing our humanity, a threat? How does having to respect the rights of EVERY American threaten anything but a status quo borne of racist apartheid in America?

@neverjaunty @CraigMinns @estarianne @monaeltahawy 'Ethos' of the fifties was America as an apartheid state. There was never a halcyon yesteryear in this country.

@Teenygozer @akanikkie1 @DanRather NY has been a corrupt place for real estate development for longer than most of have been alive. Trump and his father before embraced the criminal life. Seems like he passed it on to HIS children.
@Teenygozer @akanikkie1 @DanRather I'm from Brooklyn. Born and raised. I actually have family and personal friends who worked for and worked as contractors for the scum Trump. Union workers are protected to some degree, but I have friends who lost their business because of Trump.
@glaser_holly @akanikkie1 @DanRather He has NO moral center, no guiding principle except power, attention and more importantly to him, wealth. His narcissism led him to his greatest self realization: He could use LIES to obfuscate, confuse and convince the weak minded to believe in him. In business &amp; now in politics
@glaser_holly @akanikkie1 @DanRather That--&amp; then some. He's a criminal. He came up in a corrupt NY learning crime as a trade. He believes, it's the way things are done. That, the presidency, was the ultimate prize for savvy criminals (which he is not) &amp; that he could use it's power to cover his crimes.
@akanikkie1 @DanRather And the work is granular. Grinding. We've got to start in our neighborhoods, districts, municipalities, states--AND we've got to stay engaged nationally, while raising families, working two and three jobs, paying bills. It's not going to be a cake walk but we can do it.
@akanikkie1 @DanRather I think it's the biggest challenge facing us. Can we envision the future we want and stay engaged, for the generations that it will take to see it through? I think the answer is YES. But there are IMMENSE forces working against this potential reality.
@akanikkie1 @DanRather Lol, she's amazing. Stays informed and we talk all the time about politics and the future of the country. I'm progressive left, she's more of a centrist/moderate, SEVERE anti-Trump and hilarious. But, she is ENGAGED. In a way she's never been. It's the same everywhere.
@akanikkie1 @DanRather My only fear, borne out by history, is that we will again, fall asleep. Justice. Equality. Universal prosperity, will require us to be "woke", vigilant and aware for generations. Are we able to stay awake?
@akanikkie1 @DanRather AND what you say is true in another way: his harangue against immigrants, his sly AND overt bigotry has energized and engaged so many Americans that we WILL see some profound changes in leadership and policy priorities in America.

@SammyJNinja84 @MrDane1982 I don't think it's a silly question and I actually LIKE talking to people about sexuality. Hetero, homo or otherwise. It's how I learn and adapt. Homo-sex, in it's myriad variations, has been integral to the human experience. From. Our. Beginnings. And before.
@akanikkie1 @DanRather None of it is new. NYC KNEW who he was. From his bigot debut, keeping Black people out of his father's housing, to his no Black policy in his casinos and advocacy to have five block boys murdered by government sanctioned lynching. "America", thought he was the second coming.

@saywhatur Please, share your thoughts.
But, I have NO memory of anything similar or equivalent to these revelations of white boys immersed in acts of bigotry porn, directed at white people generally. Why is there such a fetishistic desire for them to engage in this shit?
Like many, many others, I've had too many encounters with it. Being called nigger. Being brutalized by police. Feeling as if we lived under occupation and almost apartheid like conditions. We carried a LOT of anger about these experiences. A lot.
I grew up surrounded by other Black people and various strands of diaspora culture in Brooklyn, until I got to high school. From a young age we were all aware of racism, bigotry and cultural and institutionalized expressions of this ugliness.
Why is it so intrinsic to the formative and young adult experiences of so Goddamn many white boys to ritualize, celebrate, parody and caricaturize the suffering, dehumanization and murder of millions of Black people? 	Why?

I grew up before there were ubiquitous media options. Beta was a thing. Paid cable was nascent, no internet, so we immersed ourselves in the vivid worlds created in comic books. Then went on to sci fi books: *Dune*. The expansive perspective I gained shaped my future career.

So many of the plots we drawn from the forefront of physics or drawn from mythology, I went back and forth from comics to my world book encyclopedias and science mags, Omni, Pop Sci, etc to verify stuff and was amazed.

@xsf19705 @NevilleD35 @gudrun_donovan @timjacobwise @NoahCRothman @benshapiro Our agency, was deemed an existential threat to the reigning social and economic order.
@xsf19705 @NevilleD35 @gudrun_donovan @timjacobwise @NoahCRothman @benshapiro In fact, the threat of black people achieving parity during that emerged during reconstruction, resulted in enormous backlash.
@chuckwoolery So what, Trump should have kept nearly one million Americans &amp; billions of dollars in damage to the economy in place, cause Nancy was mean?
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 And my education, professional and personal has not just confirmed this but made facts, data available to me, to anyone to understand this.
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 And realizing it was like this throughout the country, the world actually, I learned that there's more at work than just a lack of agency
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 So, anecdotally, observing the folks from my own personal experiences grinding so hard and still struggling, in my youth...
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 I've always been surrounded by Black and Brown people who were 24/7 trying to get something: a house, an education, swole pockets.
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 And honestly I rarely encounter black folks who are not on a grind. It's built into our DNA.
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 I come from a family of Jamaican/Cuban immigrants so I understand how culture can shape your assessment of possibilities.
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 At every level in this country in order to make the changes necessary to evening the playing field.
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 I definitely agree on one thing. Black communities, Brown communities other marginalized folks must engage the political processes...
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 Of forces that shape all human behavior: cultural, economic and political. It's the water we swim in, like fishes without noticing.
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 We disagree, but I do not and never have dismissed the importance of personal agency. What I don't do is dismiss the continuing legacy
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 And lack of sheer force of will alone  at the root of inequality on the party of black people. It's myopic and it's specious from the get.
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 You, like most "conservatives", get glassy eyed and gloss over actual facts about economic inequality as if just determination...
@NevilleD35 @xsf19705 My dude, no one dismissed any agency. In fact I pointed out the fallacy of the stereotypes that enforce that perspective.

@NevilleD35 The cost of politics dominated by oligarchs and gigantic corporations is what we now experience. How many of Howard's employees have been able to pay rent, buy homes, pay medical bills or pursue their own American dreams?
@NevilleD35 I'm not inherently opposed to Howard's success. He has been a millionaire since the late eighties or early nineties. He has benefited enormously, like all wealthy individuals have, since then from tax schemes that have amplified grotesque income inequalities.

@judsonmilligan @nahtanathan @foglelaw @TheAtlantic @Popehat 'Yao' understands clearly, the idea of superseding indictments.

@nahtanathan @foglelaw @TheAtlantic @Popehat Lol.
@nahtanathan @foglelaw @TheAtlantic @Popehat I know folks are excited about watching figures like Trump and Stone receive their just comeuppance and Mueller is doing a bang up job so far, but folks are going to be disappointed if they think everyone who deserves justice is going to get it.
@nahtanathan @foglelaw @TheAtlantic @Popehat He can't just refer state charges anywhere. The crime has to be committed in the jurisdiction, which is why Trump won't escape by pardon. He'll face charges in NY, because of the many crimes he's committed there. Is there any reporting on wrongdoing by Stone in NY?
@nahtanathan @foglelaw @TheAtlantic @Popehat 'whatever they find'. Well it's possible that there may be charges that Mueller has held back, but those superseding charges would be federal. He's have to refer any crimes chargeable by NY State for prosecution by state AG. He hasn't done so, yet.

@MWC_RS @CatrionaMDW @baseballcrank We'll see. This ain't the Reagan era. And the govt is arguably in violation of the constitutional rights against forced indenture and slavery.

@buhhhhlieevmeee Any way. If you can stomach it watch it. Important to understand how predators think, strategize and operate. Very few of them free style. Their like serial killers a sense. They have methodologies. Like Silderberg, apparently. Crazy shit.
@buhhhhlieevmeee Black folks see that shit and some are like "well why aren't they jailing Allen, what about Polanski, why they gotta focus on Kelly, Them First" and a heap of cop out sick denial shit. I'm not here for it.
@buhhhhlieevmeee Very much similar to the Polanski/Woody Allen dynamic that white folk got going on. The staggering genius of Allen makes so many unwilling to look at the fact that he's a sick fucking pedophile who should be shot into the fucking sun.
@buhhhhlieevmeee Well let's just say, we got some growing to do.
@buhhhhlieevmeee Thank God. Sometimes change is good. Even still there some dudes stuck in the idea that this Kelly exposure is a form of racism. I argue very, very differently and the unwillingness of some brothers separate this issue from racial equality issues and acknowledge it...
@buhhhhlieevmeee And always found myself arguing with brothers AND some sisters about why Kelly should catch biscuits and be banned for what he did. The pushback was just... Crazy. Victim blaming.
@buhhhhlieevmeee You probably should. I can't cause that shit disturbs me. I feel very protective of people and kids who go through that shit. But I'd flushed Kelly years ago when the shit was first cycling in the news and the video was circulating.
@buhhhhlieevmeee Un-motherfucking-real. Unreal.
@buhhhhlieevmeee Exactly! Over in black Twitter I've been having some sickening arguments around the whole Kelly thing, which makes me want to vomit. There's an entrenched culture of shame and secrecy and power inequity that these parasites key in on to play their trade.
@buhhhhlieevmeee They need to always know, no matter what, they can come to you with anything, at any age
@buhhhhlieevmeee All of a child's trust is vested in these kinds of authority figures. Parents, teachers, older relatives it family friends. And that's the direction it comes from 99% of the time. So important to create an environment of trust and communication with your kids
@buhhhhlieevmeee SICK!!!! fucking people man. Yeah. Won't say how on Twitter, but these stories make me feel a type of way man. It's why as a man, I support the energy of the me too movement vigorously. It's so important to flush these animals out into the open and make them jailbirds or pariahs.

@CatrionaMDW @baseballcrank Donald Trump has told over 7000 lies since he's been in office. Averaging about 15 a day. About his sex with pornstars, he's campaign dealings, about any and everything. The only failure of the stimulus was not holding big banks responsible and putting bankers in jail.

@CatrionaMDW @baseballcrank And nearly every economist reporting I've researched disagrees with you. The economy has experienced 90 months of job growth and solid but not booming expansion. It was on solid footing, nowhere near a recession. Unlike the historic mess when he stepped into office.

@Radguy1 @fanoonman @Sinclair_Tweets @wikileaks Now THIS is the kind of argument I expect from a rational, Putin supporter.
@fanoonman @Sinclair_Tweets @wikileaks Every article I've posted here, detail hundreds of killings during the Putin era. The nefarious restructuring and integration of the mafia under his augur, Putin's insecurity born bloodlust are a chilling synergy. Deadly to those that oppose or defy him.
@fanoonman @Sinclair_Tweets @wikileaks And please, block me. Your nonsensical rationalizations for Putin border on insane. I'd almost respect the argument Putin makes when accused: he turns the accusations around and points to the blood on American hands. Which is a logical but deceptive argument.
@fanoonman @Sinclair_Tweets @wikileaks Or perhaps you think Skripals murderers, really are "vitamin" salesmen, touring Salisbury, who also happen to be Russian intelligence--in their spare time

@southbaytrading @MschultzMark @AltYelloNatPark @AOC But it does nothing for runaway costs, the disgusting price gouging, OPEC-style price fixing, fraud, monopolization and onerous administrative complexity and costs.
@southbaytrading @MschultzMark @AltYelloNatPark @AOC More taxes are inevitable. But they shouldn't be onerous for the middle class. And they don't have to be with a progressive Tax scheme, which is suggested by the PERI study.  Along with iron fist cost controls, waste and fraud elimination.
@southbaytrading @TornadoTubeWX @AltYelloNatPark @AOC It MUST be brought to heel or Paris will be the augur of similar (and worse) uprisings throughout the West.
@southbaytrading @TornadoTubeWX @AltYelloNatPark @AOC Not at all. I don't see Europe as a bastion of pragmatism or efficiency. The truth is, extreme wealth inequality is a GLOBAL issue. Corporations have evolved from symbiosis to parasitism and predation, the world over, abetted by extreme shareholder greed and corrupt politicians.
@southbaytrading @TornadoTubeWX @AltYelloNatPark @AOC I'll post an analysis you can stomach, but I'm sure you could find one if you were interested. It's a cute sound bite for the right, "They're rioting over taxes". It's not what's happening exactly though.

@MschultzMark @southbaytrading @AltYelloNatPark @AOC Essentially 5 Trillion in savings, conservatively (worst case spending costs), employer contributions slashed by 8%, aggressive drug pricing and administrative cost controls (400 billion/year), progressive tax scheming.

@southbaytrading @_thunderspank @AltYelloNatPark @AOC I haven't even looked at waste spending in the military. That's a whole thing unto itself but I'm guessing we'd find 10s of billions. HC de-monopolization and cost controls are a must. The initial pain is a necessary evil for the greater good of a sustainable regulated HC system.
@HoarseWisperer @sallybhunt @notcapnamerica I'm curious to know why this dude has me blocked. I don't even interact with him??
@southbaytrading @_thunderspank @AltYelloNatPark @AOC Depending on effective cost controlling M4A costs could conceivably be projected around 1.5-2T. We will have to look at a truly progressive tax scheme, already massively popular. The mil budget is a favorite, but there's plenty of places to look. We require the political will.
@southbaytrading @_thunderspank @AltYelloNatPark @AOC Look. Low hanging fruit. DRUG PRICES. They are BOSS level, gouging. Admin costs. Those two alone address 400 billion.  Tamping down fraud, waste and predatory overcharging, net another *400 billion* which speaks to the enormity of predatation.

@allhailchief @tariqnasheed You either an ignorant fool or deliberately spreading DISINFORMATION. Which makes me question, why? Why would someone deliberately try to deflect attention from a horror in our community, that is not receiving enough if our attention? https://t.co/mrcmJTWbX2
@Blacquline @tariqnasheed The insidious cancer is SILENCE on this issue. It's not imaginary. The facts are it's happening to nearly HALF of the women in our community. https://t.co/MZEw9DpJFG
@allhailchief @tariqnasheed You sound like an imbecile really. "They just forget our boys". The Tweet you just responded to mentions boys AND predatory women. But even if I didn't say it, the idea that it's "fake altruism" because I didn't mention boys is something only someone who REALLY don't care wd say. https://t.co/LBaJZlh81j
@allhailchief @tariqnasheed When it comes to black boys, silence is more pervasive an twists the personalities of the survivors without the opportunity to get help for it. GREAT article with good links, by a brother concerned about the silence. https://t.co/MEGiv4s4YE
@allhailchief @tariqnasheed ONE in SIX boys. Black boys report about it even less than girls do. The shame. The people like you who say it ain't happening, sweep it under the rug, make it hard. That and most abusers aren't weirdos from the street. There family members or trusted friends. https://t.co/BstS1Q364v
@allhailchief @tariqnasheed The Makin point of this article by a black woman who assisted survivors is that it ain't the RKelly's that are the main problem. It's the relatives, parents, uncles, PASTORS, cousins. 60% of women. By 18. That's staggering. https://t.co/dpUJ54Coju

@melabroohaha @cbouzy Yeah. He has to be forced to confront this either way. We're clear he's a coward. He NEEDS Donald Trump impeached. I think he knows it. But regardless, the house may or may not wait for the Mueller report but I think impeachment charges are inevitable.

@Thor96607567 @DerekJShaffer @mtracey My personal hatred stems from Donald Trumps actions in control of the executive where his corruption, bigotry and lack of intelligence have lead to the unnecessary suffering of so many and reduced the standing of the United States in the world to a head shaking tragedy.

@DerekJShaffer @mtracey Cool story. Unfortunately there's a mountain circumstantial evidence and we have no idea what the special counsel report to Congress will contain, but recent reporting suggests it doesn't look good for the president or his family members and close aides.
@mtracey I hear you, but there were draw downs by the Obama regime that were widely criticized. Accommodations to Russia that were widely criticized, but not seen through the lens of criminality (capitulation to Putin by coercion) that the current regime labors under.
@DerekJShaffer @mtracey The evidence so far, is so far beyond "dislike of his policies". Given the admissions of his his lawyer and activities of his campaign associates. There's distinct evidence of criminality. And we still don't know what Mueller has, given recent reporting, likely to be considerable
@mtracey Trump/gop politicization of doj/IC aside, the mountain of public evidence of wrong doing, though much of it circumstantial, makes your implicit premise implausible.
