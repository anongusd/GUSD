@rocketrichardus @JesseKellyDC @Soma_Belt I am left of Center, but I‚Äôm far from a socialist. I think we all have more in common than we think, but it‚Äôs hard to find common ground when divisive and derogatory blanket statements are made.
@rocketrichardus @JesseKellyDC @Soma_Belt Exactly. I'm stating that you can't speak for "The Left" any more than you can for "The Right". You are prejudicially generalizing. And your 'definitions' highlights it.
@Soma_Belt @MonikaMusing @JesseKellyDC I didn't address the prejudice men face because the original post didn't mention them. I'm outraged about a lot of things, but I try to focus my responses. https://t.co/SKGq9OOGz1
@rocketrichardus @JesseKellyDC @Soma_Belt Define "The Left". I'm a pro-life Christian who voted with the GOP for 30 years. This generalization is literally the definition of prejudice (to pre-judge), which is the base of racism &amp; misogyny.
