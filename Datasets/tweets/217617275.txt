@RJNewsflash Now THAT is awesome news... for me any way!
@dcexaminer Obama is a racist POS and the entire world knows it.
@MSNBC And we can bet there is a whole lot more about this that you are not telling than you are.
@CBSNews Who the hell cares?  Did you care enough about the Benghazi murders to go on and on and on about that?  No, that was obama and hillary so you just kept quiet. Give us a break. MSM is killing our country.
@HillaryClinton And do tell us whose administration started all this mess and left it to be cleaned up (as usual)?
@RJNewsflash She got it wrong (as usual).  Trump is undoing the damage obama did to our great country. That's my opinion and I know...we all have one.
@HillaryClinton @OnwardTogether No...........
@BennyUmoren @switNcool Start nuking their asses and put a stop to their madness!
@ABCPolitics Can you please tell us all why ABC didn't cover the Benghazi deaths even half as much as you cover Khashoggi's?  Not you, not NBC, not CNN???  Why is that?
@dcexaminer Oh wow!  Isn't she a fine one to talk about anyone spreading propaganda!  Her sins have been found out by this nation and she's trying so hard to stay in the limelight. How pathetic she truly is...
