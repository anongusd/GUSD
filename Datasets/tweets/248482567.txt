@eschor Booker has good ideas (e.g. baby bonds) and is a truly inspiring politician, but his commitment to an outdated procedural loophole that Republicans have been happy to discard at will is truly bizarre. We need both bold ideas and realism about how they‚Äôll have to get done.
@eschor ‚ÄúSure I‚Äôd like to solve the nation‚Äôs problems, but we must keep doing things in Washington the way we‚Äôve always done them.‚Äù

Just a note - proud of my former boss on the Hill @RepLloydDoggett for standing with immigrants on this vote. https://t.co/uN0ZNISK5Q
Head of @UNITEDWEDREAM - leading national immigrant rights group representing Dreamers. üëá https://t.co/3cMst7X0aL
@mcbyrne i mean, 3 dems voted for him.
We believe this is the morally right thing to do. It's also the politically strategic thing to do. The only way we'll defeat Trumpism is by building a movement that unifies against their hate and bigotry. There are more of us than them - if we stand together, we will win. /end
Indivisible opposes this deal. Indivisible stands with our immigrant allies in calling for a clean CR instead. And Indivisible implores Dem negotiators to ensure that those closest to the pain Trump is causing are part of the deal-making process in the future.
So some Dems struck a deal on immigration policy. Our friends in the immigrant rights community say it's a bad deal. It's not a hard decision for Indivisible to choose who to follow - it's our responsibility as a movement with a ton of privilege to stand with those under threat.
So what do we do with this information? Being a good ally is often not about leading, but about choosing who to follow. This means using your privilege and expending your power - and often pushing your other friends to be better.
In this negotiation, Democrats want some stuff, Republicans want other stuff. In the absence of a deal, the default position is a Continuing Resolution (CR) - which funds government at current levels with no changes. My friends say a CR would be better.
And what I hear from all of these friends who know more about this issue than I do is the same thing: they don't like the deal. It includes more money for detention, for ICE agents, and for fencing. For my friends in the know, the bad things outweigh the good in the bill.
And I ask @AngelRafPadilla, who is Indivisible's National Policy Director and also an immigrant rights expert who worked on Capitol Hill for leading member of Congress on these issues, and then in advocacy for immigrant rights before helping write the Indivisible Guide.
So I ask my friends who know this world better than I do. Friends like @UNITEDWEDREAM - a leading national org representing Dreamers; @NILC - a leading national immigrant legal rights org; and @DetentionWatch a leading national org fighting the inhumane detention of immigrants.
So when a deal on immigration issues comes up, our first question is always going to be - "where are our friends in the immigrant rights community on this, and how can we use our power and privilege to help them achieve their goals?" There's an immigration deal on the table now.
That's why Indivisibles swarmed the airports after the Muslim ban, rallied with racial justice groups to take down the monuments, &amp; sided with Dreamers when Trump rescinded DACA. We see our privilege &amp; power, and we figure out how to side with impacted folks to fight for justice.
üëãHello fellow non-immigrants. Indivisible is disproportionately made up of us non-immigrant folk. It's not all of our movement, but it is a big chunk. And a driving idea behind the very name "Indivisible" is that we treat an attack on one of us like an attack on all. [THREAD üëá]

@JustTheObvious1 That's my point - you can have 85% of people on your side and still lose with the filibuster. I'd love to have a majority decide.

@WokeDon @bspiker @jeffayc @OsitaNwanevu Tell that to obamacare, which was only enacted after Scott Brown won in 2010 by using reconciliation with a 50 vote threshold. No rational or modern democratic system requires a supermajority for legislation - it's absurd and unnecessary.

@matthewstoller Angie Craig, who is the one pictured in that article, is in both caucuses. There's quite a bit of overlap. I do think the key question is whether progressive flex their muscle to force votes/hearing and change/kill bills. And they're getting there.
@matthewstoller Just curious - does New Dems do that?
@matthewstoller "There's energy on left, but organization among moderates." There's new organization among progressives too - organization I haven't seen before.
@matthewstoller I think this is a dated criticism of House progressives. Check out the new Congressional Progressive Caucus Center, which just got a new ED and real funding, and is placing fellows in offices throughout the House. The CPC is organizing now in ways it has not before.

@BenDAvanzo @BruceLesley There's a lot feeding my sense of urgency, that included. I also worry for the democratic experiment.

@BenDAvanzo @BruceLesley GOP can definitely get to 60. That's why you'd really want your first post-filibuster bill to be pro-democtacy reforms that increase representation and responsiveness. That'll help solidify the House and presidency (and help with the senate).
@BenDAvanzo @BruceLesley Alternative is accepting no real progressive reforms of substantial size outside of reconciliation for a decade or more.
@BruceLesley @BenDAvanzo You'ee not getting good comprehensive immigration reform with the filibuster intact. GOP has moved too extreme. Any Dem reform that makes it through with 60 votes will be worse than one that gets 50 votes.
@BenDAvanzo @BruceLesley Problem is constitutional changes isn't feasible. Best bet is to try to expand voting rights, the House, and the senate with a new state or two. There is a reasonable Dem pathway to 55 votes, there's really not to 60+ in the near term.
@BruceLesley People are being harmed now- we‚Äôre in the wreckage now. Inequality is skyrocketing, the planet is dying, and democracy is crumbling. A procedural loophole stands between us and real solutions that match the size of our problems.
@BruceLesley Expand the House and the Senate - both can be done with majority votes if you eliminate the filibuster (Wyoming Rule + redistricting reform + new states). Part of making government more responsive is making it more representative.

@brianbeutler So many funny coincidences!
@BruceLesley As progressives who believe govt can be a force for good, we can't afford to be scared of a responsive democracy. We've got to embrace the idea that when the people have power, outcomes are better. The alternative is accepting plutocratic control. &amp; that's not worked well for us.
@BruceLesley 2) If, after those reforms, the GOP gets a trifecta in the future, they *should* be able to set the agenda. That's how democracy works. Otherwise people see no connection between their votes and policy outcomes - and they reasonably lose faith in the whole rigged system.
@BruceLesley This is not to dismiss the damage GOP will do if they get power. 2 responses to that:	1) The first post-filibuster move must be big democracy reform to make govt responsive. DC statehood (&amp; PR if they want it), voting rights, campaign finance, expanding the House/courts, etc.
@BruceLesley America is a country with the some of the lowest investment in fighting child poverty and also has one of the least responsive political systems. These two things are connected. If we want the people's needs addressed, we have to make the government responsive to the people.
@BruceLesley I want to see the Big Ideas I've read about in First Focus' publications to become law. That won't happen while the filibuster exists. Until it's axed, we'll always be fighting for crumbs.
@BruceLesley Respect your position, and we mostly agree on policy goals bc we both come from the antipoverty world. But I'm not satisfied with defense. It's not working. The status quo is bad for poor kids, the country, the planet. And the filibuster entrenches the status quo.
@jdbau @AJentleson smart dude
@AJentleson Hey while we're nerding out, Hamilton/Madison didn't even want equal representation in the senate but ultimately gave in to small states.		And it was America's greatest historical villain, Aaron Burr, who (accidentally) created the filibuster loophole.

@radicalcraft @CaseyOTrimble @IndivisibleTeam Yeah sara's read it right. Also, there are several senators running for president. We want all of them to go the record for axing the filibuster - that way when most of them go back to the senate, we've got them committed. Schumer will respond to what his caucus wants.
@KNLScurry06 @Frel_ A little bit, but I don't think that's the driving force. Civil rights legislation got filibustered for 75 years until 1965 -all prior to those changes. Since 1975, polarization hardened ideological lines making parties more coherent, leading to more tactics like filibuster.
@AnnaSperber1 True dat, but Cornyn or Cruz or whoever takes his place will do the same thing if they have the filibuster. The problem is endemic to the GOP - not just a problem with one of em.
@JoshuaMound I almost forgot about Scott Winship - he blocked me when I asked him about race and conservative policies on means-tested programs back in like 2015. Hope he's well.
@marcushjohnson @bayofarizona they'd have to start working out plans now so they're ready to pass in 2021. (Side note: post 2020 census redistricting applies to 2022 election. If Dems win big in 2020, 2022 would likely go better than normal midterms).
@marcushjohnson @bayofarizona Admit DC, admit PR (if they want it), expand the electorate all over (AVR, national holiday, vote by mail, etc), fix gerrymandering, mandate donor disclosure, expand the House &amp; the courts. Do all this with majority votes in congress. Makes reactionary backlash tougher.
@marcushjohnson @bayofarizona I hear that and it's fair - the people the GOP will screw aren't (mostly) white dudes like me. That is why I think the 1st post-filibuster move has to be big democracy reforms that make it harder for the GOP to win on a reactionary bigotry-based agenda in the future.
@marcushjohnson @bayofarizona They did eliminate it (partially) to jam through 2 supreme court nominees.
@marcushjohnson Agreed - if we don't pass climate legislation soon we're all screwed. Senate procedural loopholes and fear of what the other side might do shouldn't stop us. The negative consequences are too dire.
Booker is brilliant, politically astute, and an inspirational leader who speaks powerfully to progressive values. And almost nothing he promises will become law as long as McConnell has the filibuster. Booker can commit to a senate procedural loophole or justice, but not both. https://t.co/FH1XhTnEfi
@marcushjohnson but more seriously - 2 responses:	1) When Dems ax the filibuster they should then enact major democracy reforms to expand the vote &amp; entrench the people's power	2) If GOP takes majorities in Congress afterwards, they deserve to set the agenda. That's how democracy should work.
@marcushjohnson They don't like the tax rates from back then.
@econwonk @JHWeissmann Yes, and in 1965, many Republicans supported the voting rights act. We're in a a different world now, Zach. GOP won't even support DACA today.
@Rat_thetrump Yep you could set any number. One proposal I've seen has the number change over time - e.g. first cloture vote is 60, then if that fails and you bring it up again it's 55, then if that fails it lowers to 50.
@art_steburg @chrislhayes yeah the senate is bad and should be reformed (and I'd support that), but for practical reasons just talking here about what can be done with a majority vote.
@Rat_thetrump It's not in the constitution. It's a procedural loophole that was accidentally created and then abused. Nothing is special about 60 votes - it's arbitrary. It could be changed to 50 by simple majority vote.
@cuscutis very much in favor of democracy being used by the other side - if they've got popular support for their reforms, they should get to do them. That's how democracy should work.
Sometimes you gotta just reflect on how many incredible people are new members in the 116th congress. There's so much more moral courage in that institution now that folks like @Ilhan are there. https://t.co/pkFefhxtNR

@wyethwire great doc
@JoshuaHol @joe_rose_ Yes you could admit new states with a simple majority vote if you first axed the filibuster.
@JoshuaHol If you want to protect against those future GOP assaults, the first thing Dems should do after axing the filibuster is a massive democracy package - expand the vote, retool institutions, admit states, etc etc.
@JoshuaHol Disagree here - theory of democracy is the people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard. But seriously - we win when democracy is responsive to the people. The senate is antidemocratic enough without overlaying additional antimajoritarian features.
@JoshuaHol I could accept the Senate minority slowing down legislation but not killing it. Proposals in the past have included lowering the vote threshold on each successive cloture vote. E.g. first cloture is 60, then 55, then finally 50.
@brianbeutler Yep. Just check out this list of opposition to HR 1. The entirety of the conservative ecosystem is against democracy reform. Minority Leader McConnell will *never* allow a vote if we allow him that power. https://t.co/uEu8xNkWCl

@noahjnelson Sure Earth has its charms, but this senate procedural loophole is just divine.
@Frel_ It's a real mistake to assign any sort of deep philosophical meaning or value to 60/40. The Senate is antidemocratic enough as it is. Layering on top of that an arbitrary 60 vote threshold amps up the undemocratic leanings of our system. I'd like govt to respond to the people.
@Frel_ Founders didn't create 60/40. It's a loophole that wasn't put to use regularly until the 1900s by racists to kill civil rights bills. The threshold was then lowered to 60 for 67 in 1975. Since then, use has skyrocketed. This is an absurd antidemocratic screw up in the system.

@Leahgreenb 1:45am - got the receipts https://t.co/i8JQyI1R0O
(Philosophical side note: "But won't the GOP do bad stuff when THEY have the Senate?" Yep. But we win when government responds to the people, not when there's mutually assured destruction. When Dems ax the filibuster, they should enact HR 1 &amp; then some - entrench people's power).
(Wonky side note: "But what about reconciliation??" Yeah, we could do some stuff like taxes through reconciliation. But you're not getting democracy reform, immigration, m4a, a full-fledged GND, gun regs, and other big reforms through reconciliation. It doesn't work that way).
So by all means, ask for democracy reforms, M4A, GND, and other big things you'd like your presidential favorites to embrace. But also ask them if they support axing the filibuster. If not, I've got a bridge to sell you and can send you my venmo info. /end
McConnell weakened the filibuster to get his way - 2 Supreme Court justices. But so far, 0 Dem presidential contenders are on the record for axing the filibuster. Many are talking about big progressive plans. All are empty promises while the filibuster lives.
2020: Dems take that optimistic 4 or 5 seats. They have the Presidency, the House, and the Senate. The Senate axes the filibuster with a simple majority vote. Congress then passes popular progressive legislation and the president signs it into law. Wouldn't that be nice?
And of course while we wait for 2027 or 2047 or 2067, our planet is dying, inequality is skyrocketing, and democracy is crumbling. If this is depressing you, I've got good news: there is a better way. AX THE DAMN FILIBUSTER. Here's the alternate scenario if we do:
If 2027 seems like a long time to wait for crucial reforms, you might want to sit down. In 1890, a bill to provide oversight of southern elections to prevent black voter suppression was filibustered. The reform was blocked for 75 years until the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965.
The above scenario assumes 0 Dem losses (unlikely). It assumes 4 consecutive Dem electoral sweeps (basically inconceivable). It assumes Dem wins in TX, OH, FL, NC, GA, IA, MO + more (!). And it assumes those Dems will then vote unanimously for big progressive reforms (good luck!)
2026: Wahoo! Dems win yet another midterm election! Seems bonkers, but hey this is a dream, remember? Maybe they pick up KS or a remaining seat in GA, IA, or NC that they missed in 2020. That'll give them 60 or 61 seats in 2027. So we win now? Not so fast...
2024: The new Dem President won re-election! Hurray! Unfortunately, 2024 is a rough senate map. FL, MO, and TX (all Dem losses in 2018) are the best bets. Let's say it's a sweep, and yet again, Dems lose 0 of their own. That's 59 senate votes in 2025. GOP blocks everything...
2022: The new Dem President defies odds and gains Senate seats in the midterms! The "easiest" (ha!) pickups are OH, WI, PA, IA, NC, GA, &amp; FL (Rubio!). Let's say Dems get 4 of em and lose 0 of their own. That's 56 Senate votes in 2023. GOP blocks everything...
2020: Rosiest possible scenario is a 5 seat net gain for Senate Dems. This would require holding AL (!), and picking up 5 of these: ME, CO, AZ, IA, NC, and GA. Not super likely, but we're just dreaming here. That puts Dems up to 52 Senate votes in 2021. GOP blocks everything...
Ok let's talk about why the filibuster must die. McConnell's diatribe against HR 1 shows the GOP will block everything if they can. Democracy, GND, M4A, gun regs - the next Dem president's agenda will be killed with 41 votes.		So how do Dems get to 60 votes? Let's dream a little:

If you want to read up on it, here's a short article on the GOP killing Carter's democracy reforms in 1977: https://t.co/jYWFwuQqJP
@ashlee__willis They don't believe they're the part of the people. They actively fear democracy. They are aristocrats and white supremacists, by which I mean they fear non-rich, non-white people holding power. Trump is a crystallization but this is not new - they've embraced it for decades.
There is nothing they fear more than democracy. The only hope for a rich white supremacist force while inequality grows and the electorate diversifies is a system that ignores the people. That's what they've promoted for decades, and it's what they'll promote when Trump is gone.
In 1977, after Watergate and Nixon, Jimmy Carter was inaugurated and proposed expansive reforms to campaign finance and to make it easier to vote. The GOP called it a "power grab" and killed it in the Senate. McConnell is rehearsing old lines here. https://t.co/eLST6MduRJ

Dems aren't trying to get changes in the budget. They're not asking for any concessions. They're literally just asking to reopen government. That's it. If you cover this as "well both sides just need to find compromise," you're failing your job as a journalist.

1) Dem or GOP - it doesn't matter. We need positive reinforcement for Dem Senators and pressure on GOP Senators. Simple message: tell them you want govt reopened &amp; no wall. 		1-844-236-2373 connects you to both your senators. A junior staffer is standing by to take your call!
RED ALERT! I talked with a few sources on Capitol Hill and am hearing Trump folks are paying to barrage offices with pro-wall calls ahead of Thursday's vote. These calls are BS but can make it seem like there's public support for the wall. Here are three ways we can combat this:
This morning @tamarakeithNPR covered shutdown politics well. There are two proposals getting a Senate vote Thursday:	1) Dem proposal to reopen govt	2) GOP proposal requiring wall funding before reopening govt		It's not too complicated - this is a hostage situation.
@realDonaldTrump Yelling doesn't solve anything.
RT @IndivisibleTeam: Pod End the Shutdown.		But, seriously, listen to @jonfavs and light up those phone lines tomorrow! Republicans *and* D‚Ä¶
@AJentleson Never forget though, he defeated Kavanaugh through that brilliant deal with Flake.
@neeratanden @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand I get the "How Democracies Die" argument. But I think the answer to that is a larger electorate and a more responsive legislature. If we have the opportunity in 2021 (a big if), I think Dems should take it.
@neeratanden @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand They already eliminated the filibuster to appoint judges to strike down democracy laws like the VRA and uphold voter suppression. It's happening. If Dems have the opportunity, they should expand democracy as much as they possible to prevent tyranny of the minority like that.
@_waleedshahid @neeratanden @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Hey that's in my original twitter rant above! If there's one thing that turned me against the filibuster, it's the first 100 pages or so of Master of the Senate.
@neeratanden @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand If President Gillibrand  has a mandate with a majority in the Senate, I want her to do all the good she can as quickly as she can. But if she (and Senate Dems) allow McConnell to stymie her agenda, that doesn't help us in the short term or the long term.
@neeratanden @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Yeah that's real, but I generally find the argument of "we can't have responsive government because think what the other side will do" to be unpersuasive. Our side loses when people lose faith that government can be a force for good.
@brianefallon @AJentleson @JillDLawrence Thanks for flagging. Just went on a mini-rant about this. Great this question is getting asked. Gillibrand's answer is bad, but it isn''t uniquely bad - gonna require pushing for any senator to get on the right side here. And it is so so so necessary.  https://t.co/CJEqP7asBF
RT @AJentleson: The Founders invented the Senate as a majority-rule body. The supermajority threshold is a 20th-century mutation. McConnell‚Ä¶
@PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand So this is a bad answer. It's not the answer of someone who has considered how they'll get big things done in 2021. But Gillibrand gets credit for being open to change, &amp; I don't think her colleagues running have given better answers yet. I welcome them reviewing this further.
@PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand This goes for just about all major progressive priorities that can't be jammed into a reconciliation package. It's unacceptable to just wave your hands and say "well I think we can bring people together." Have you met the Senate GOP? Have you seen McConnell? Ain't gonna happen.
@PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand HR 1 - the big pro democracy House bill - won't become law without axing the filibuster. The GOP will do everything they can to avoid constraining their donors or expanding the vote. It doesn't matter if President Gillibrand demands it - Minority Leader McConnell will kill it.
@PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Ooh thanks for asking this question @jonfavs. Senate conservatives used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation for decades. The idea that advocates just need "to work a lot harder," is just wrong. Stop letting a tiny extremist minority block progress.

@TopherSpiro @brianefallon @OsitaNwanevu yessss! There's nothing magic about 435 members of the House. It's a 90-year-old law passed by congress. Also, it's deeply at odds with the Founders' vision. The first representatives represented 57,000 people on average; modern Reps represent 700,000+.
@tmksyracuse @TopherSpiro @OsitaNwanevu @brianefallon interesting - i assume roberts court will strike down lots of progressive legislation, but what are the constitutional grounds for striking down a state admission to the union passed by congress?

@TopherSpiro @OsitaNwanevu @brianefallon Eliminate filibuster, make DC a state, get 2 more senators, and then pass your GND.
@raymondtberle @OsitaNwanevu yeah it's necessary but not sufficient.
@Superninfreak @OsitaNwanevu yeah i think that's fair.
@OsitaNwanevu Please keep on this. There are several senators running for president and promising big things. They should be asked how they expect to get those things done if they don't support filibuster reform.
@ryanlcooper Aside from raw intelligence, the failure of many members to speak like normal human beings rather than speechifying automatons  (even behind closed doors) was also really surprising to me as a staffer. The difference with the incoming class is striking - the freshmen are real.

@GovHowardDean This is good succinct framing.
@EmilyPremo1 it's just bonkers. Jane Mayer's 2010 New Yorker covers a lot of it: https://t.co/OxnUXBLaPP. If you want a deeper dive, you can get Mayer's book Dark Money, or Nancy MacLean's more recent book Democracy in Chains.
Just some Friday afternoon thoughts as we build towards the post-Trump era together. Can't just take him down - gotta fix a system that allowed him to rise. /end
With that backdrop, Mitch McConnell's op-ed yesterday attacking HR 1, a sweeping pro-democracy bill, makes total sense. The number one thing these dudes are scared of is democracy.
I'm not breaking news here - this is all well covered by @JaneMayerNYer in the New Yorker nearly a decade ago, and @NancyMacLean5 more recently in a book last year. Both cover aspects of this multi-decade underground operation to subvert democracy. The operation is still going.
After 1980, the Koch Brothers saw that people wouldn't support this if it was discussed out in the open and put to a vote. So they instead took their operation underground, funding think tanks, news orgs, advocacy shops, and influencers - in addition to buying politicians.
-Eliminate Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid	-Abolish the FBI, CIA, FEC, FDA, EPA, SEC, and USPS	-Eliminate campaign finance laws	-Eliminate child labor laws and minimum wage	-Eliminate individual and corporate income taxes
Ever think about the fact that in 1980 David Koch ran for Vice President on the Libertarian ticket, self-funded that campaign, was dismayed at getting 1% of the vote, and then took his ideological operation underground? Here are some gems from the Libertarian platform that year:
If Dems refused to reopen the government until marginal tax rates increased to 70%, the press would be apoplectic. But when Trump &amp; McConnell do it for a hugely unpopular wall, it's all "wow both sides really need to figure this out." https://t.co/FN1Wsnz0HT

@n3jim @SenatorSinema @Sen_JoeManchin @SenDougJones @SenatorMenendez also good advice
If you have a Dem Senator who is not Sinema, Manchin, Jones, or Menendez - call them tomorrow and tell them THANK YOU. Positive feedback is so rare. People normally call angry. Call, letter to the editor, a card - tell them you appreciate their vote &amp; want them to stand strong. https://t.co/nMmFn1n4R9
There will be more motions to proceed in the future - as long as we hold on to 41 votes, we can keep up the fight.
HOLY CRAP WE WON. We needed 41 votes and we got 'em. Senate Dems fight back - refusing to proceed with business as usual until McConnell brings up a budget. Big props to @VanHollenForMD for kicking it off, and @SenSchumer for bringing the caucus together. KEEP IT UP DEMS! https://t.co/LzEUH0ILks

I missed this in the New Year shuffle, but @DLeonhardt is spot on in this piece. The political fight in front of us is democracy vs something else. https://t.co/YQzy589aoH
YES! Add Senator Casey to the list - they're listening to the calls! The vote is tonight, and we just need 41 Senators to pressure McConnell to vote on a budget. Pitch in - call your Senators and tell them to "vote against the motion to proceed on S.1" - (202) 224-3121. https://t.co/zEpvMfBlmb
@GOPLeader You had the House for 8 years. Did this crisis just begin after November 6th?

Hot take - too many people are blaming just Trump for the shutdown, and not enough people are blaming McConnell. Yes, Trump is a baby throwing a fit, but McConnell is indulging him. McConnell could end it today if he wanted to. Senate Dems are smart to pressure him directly.

And to be clear - Senate GOP should do the same thing. Any GOP senator who claims they want a budget but refuses to use their leverage is just a Flake facsimile.
A great response to this clown show would be all Senate Dems voting against the motion to proceed on S.1 Tuesday night and pressuring McConnell to bring up a bipartisan budget for a vote. https://t.co/moGKJj08gT

@RavMABAY here's current list: https://t.co/Lkw2WIpwd0
Final Note - this doesn't have to be ONLY Democrats. GOP senators, especially those up for reelection next year (Tillis, Gardner, Collins, etc), may be susceptible to this pressure. If they want to end the shutdown, here's a chance for them to do something more than talk. /end
And here's an updated @IndivisibleTeam resource on this with call script if you need it: https://t.co/KnmudtHXS1
Here's a current list of Dems onboard as of a couple hours ago (but this is a fast-moving situation - there may be more onboard already): https://t.co/69lSd4lFV4
Current status: The Dem Senate Leader Schumer and many other Senate Dems are onboard. Every single Dem should link arms on this. Bottom line, if just 41 Senate Dems do it, they will grind senate business to a near-halt and pressure McConnell to vote on a budget.
Note: The staffer will probably say something like "I'm not sure where my boss stands, but I'll be sure to pass on your concerns." DON'T HANG UP. Ask for a written response &amp; say you'll be watching Tuesday. Never let the staffer off the hook - make them do the follow up work.
Here's how to help pressure McConnell to end the shutdown:	1) Call your senator: 202-224-3121 	2) Tell the staffer "I want your boss to vote Tuesday against the motion to proceed on S.1 &amp; everything else until McConnell agrees to a budget vote."	3) Repeat for your other senator
HUGE DEVELOPMENT! The Democratic Senate Minority Leader is adopting the strategy. He needs 41 of 47 Senate Dem votes in order to pressure McConnell. If your Dem Senator isn't yet on the record - call and ask them to stand with Schumer. Switchboard number: (202) 224-3121 https://t.co/8X9o2Dc5sd

@Jankowski60 @IndivisibleTeam Vote should be coming Tuesday. It's a good sign some Dem senators are already coming out against it. We need 41 to oppose the motion to the proceed. Recommend calling your senators Monday. Switchboard:  (202) 224-3121.
And here's an @IndivisibleTeam explainer on how Senate Dems, even in the minority, can use 41 votes to slow down all Senate business to put pressure on McConnell. Playtime is over - this is the Blue Wave Congress. https://t.co/7P9b0VaIoS
YES. Time to take it up a notch. McConnell refuses to even allow a vote on the bipartisan House budget. Dems can grind Senate business to a near halt until he agrees to a vote. Next opportunity is Tuesday - ask your Senator to "vote against the motion to proceed on S.1" https://t.co/YPGNTqR1ZZ

@DennisG_Shea @TuesdaysToomey @senatemajldr Key thing is to get in touch with your own senators. McConnell won't care what you think unless you live in Kentucky (or have millions of dollars). The official U.S. Capitol switchboard can connect you to your senators' offices: (202) 224-3121.

@M_i_c_h_a_e_l So, yes, McConnell is choosing to keep the shutdown in place, but every GOP senator refusing to stop him is complicit.
@M_i_c_h_a_e_l As Majority Leader, he controls what gets a vote. So he can just choose to not bring it up for a vote. Now, if enough senators opposed this, they could force his hand - for instance, prevent him from confirming any new judges until he brings the budget up for a vote.
@DavidCMurphy accurate
Just to be clear: Trump cannot do this unilaterally. As Senate Majority Leader, McConnell has to empower Trump to do this by refusing to bring the House budget up for a vote. And currently that's what McConnell is doing. https://t.co/0DQFAUOK6C

Indivisible groups are rallying at congressional district offices today for 2 things:	1st: To support HR 1, the For the People Act. A big bold pro-democracy &amp; anti-corruption reform package.	2nd: To encourage the House to stand strong against Trump's temper tantrum. https://t.co/R9IZqlF46j

@CarrieMPruett well sure, but that would require 67 votes! When McConnell brought the budget before, he only got [checks notes]...oh, 100 votes.
Fun fact for the history nerds out there: the U.S. Constitution actually established congress as separate from the executive branch. This was once known as a key part of our government's system of checks and balances, before McConnell of course. https://t.co/splcdqYs9p
@MattBruenig yeah was thinking the same thing. At least in this Congress, there was some coordinated opposition to a lot of the bad stuff. 2003-2005 had bipartisan iraq war and part 2 of the bush tax cuts, and ended with big GOP wins in 2004.
Last day of the 115th Congress! Review:	-Desperately tried &amp; failed to kill Obamacare	-Passed the Trump Tax Scam, then the economy tanked	-Repeatedly put GOP over country	-Wiped out in Blue Wave elections	-Ended in shutdown		Any nominations for a worse Congress in recent history?
@waldojaquith yeah seems like a good one-two punch. Reenfranchisement too - so it doesn't depend on the gov.
@james_roe @girlinseattle Oregon had a Dem trifecta! Now New York has one - and they should use it.
@FeedJoelPie @james_roe agree that AVR is necessary for not sufficient. Would be good for NY to pass a big ol pro-democracy reform package.
@james_roe Oh I totally get why the system exists - we should just demand that they change it. Good to see on the ground action/organizing in NY to do that.
Ooh this is good. New York is one of a half dozen new Democratic trifecta states, and they have an incredibly backwards voting system. The new unified Dem legislature absolutely should pass Automatic Voter Registration (as should all the other Dem trifecta states). https://t.co/qWbRCtOP4W

Trump &amp; Repubs are shutting down the government because they want billions more in deficit financed government spending. This is not spin - this is literally their position.

@StuartSpooner Bottom line for me is that McConnell is pushing extremist judges through at a breakneck speed. That's real. That's cynical and effective politicization of the court. Can't act like it's not happening. Can't throw our hands up and say "pox on both houses" bc the source is clear.
@StuartSpooner Unlike FDR, there was no announced "Republican Plan To Pack The Courts." It was a quiet but persistent long-term campaign. And it's been really successful. Even if Dems retake power in 2021, an antagonistic court decades in the making will be a serious threat to their ambitions.
@StuartSpooner Way I see it - not only is this opinion ridiculous, it's part of a pattern. The GOP (correctly) sees the court as a tool for achieving their policy/political goals. Dems have long seen courts as apolitical. With the surge of court packing under Trump, that's gonna have to change.
@jmhorp sorry, you lose me at "both sides." I criticize Dems when necessary, but Republicans are actively undermining democracy to entrench their power.
@jmhorp yeah Republicans have treated the courts as a political institution, and Dems have not. Hope they learn. Dems shouldn't confirm those kind of judges in the future when they have power.
@jmhorp Democrats can't pack the courts - they don't have the Senate. Republicans can and have been packing though! Gonna take pretty significant reform to undo their damage.
@StuartSpooner the conservatives who pack the court with extremist ideologues attack the legitimacy and integrity of the court. Taking a blind eye to that is not respecting the court - it's dooming it.

@HarwoodBrett ha, hopefully a very respectful mosh pit üôÇ. But yeah, ideally when lower tier candidates have no chance, they'll bow out. And we do need to pick up 3 or 4 senators, so hopefully not every inspiring leader from every state runs for prez - we need some to become senators and govs.

@pambananakazi82 changing that rule would require a constitutional amendment. As long as we're in fairy tale land though, would probably be better just to eliminate the senate entirely and set up a parliamentary system with proportional representation and ranked choice voting nationwide.
@pambananakazi82 Seriously if ever in American politics you scratch your head and wonder "why is this democratic institution so bizarrely structured?" usually the answer is it was set up that way to reinforce white supremacy. Works for voting rights, gerrymandering, senate, DC statehood, etc etc

@DerekRMazzeo Yeah both and. Good for senate primaries too, and you also need to build up overwhelming public pressure. Most Senators running for president will still be senators in 2021, and we want them on the record supporting this shift.
@myliberalagenda also admitting more states would help (only possible after eliminating the filibuster though)
@myliberalagenda yep
For a very engaging history of how the filibuster (and the senate broadly) has been used to support racist conservative policies and to stymie progressive legislation, read the first 100 or so pages of Caro's Master of the Senate https://t.co/FRpf7WOrdM
And for y'all who are like "but if the GOP retakes power, they'll do bad stuff!" 	1) Hey that's representative democracy. Progressives win when democracy reflects the will of the people - because our ideas are better.	2) GOP doesn't care about your rules. See WI, GA, NC, MI, etc
@GMSarli oh def - eliminating the filibuster is just the most basic need, but there are a TON of reforms to democratic institutions needed to make them reflect the will of the people.
When Dems have control of the House, Senate, and Presidency in 2021, enacting legislation of real substance will require eliminating the filibuster. Every Dem running for president (and sitting senators especially) should speak to this, or they're not serious about change. https://t.co/MP8aAvBf5e

@jonfavs I am just totally baffled. Old agreements are OBVIOUSLY irrelevant now. The default position of Dems should be a CR until January when they have the House majority. If GOP wants more, they'll have to convince Dems to deal. Or that's what any competent Dem negotiator would do.
Pretty basic concept in negotiation is the BATNA - Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. The Dems' BATNA on the budget negotiation is a short-term deal at existing funding levels til January when they have a House majority. Seems pretty damn good to me.
Here's a novel idea: NOTHING. YOU GET NOTHING FOR YOUR WALL. Elections have consequences. Let Trump veto a CR if he wants a shutdown. New congress with Dem House can debate the budget.

@musepolsci @IndivisibleTeam Hey I'm not saying I'm surprised these particular Dems are doing it - I'm just criticizing them for it. And I think it's notable that it's the conservative Dems causing problems now, not the progressives.
@BSpaniel91 i see what you did there
@Indivisible_WA9 I think this is somewhat unique - they're really threatening to vote with Republicans to take down the Dem Speaker if they don't get their way. It's a very big move. Even if they don't follow through, they're causing chaos now which hurts planning efforts for 2019.
@musepolsci @IndivisibleTeam I'm totally cool with a fight in the caucus- that's not what they're threatening. They're threatening to vote with Republicans against her on the House floor. It's like losing the primary and then running as an independent to take down the winner. Not cool with that.
now this is what i call a tweet https://t.co/DdqY3XvoqZ

@tomwatson This class is incredible.
@NoH8_USA They're threatening to vote against her on the floor even after she wins the Dem Caucus vote. To be clear, I have no problem with them trying to get a different Dem to win the caucus vote, but that's not what they're doing. They're running no alternative and just causing chaos.
@NoH8_USA According to the rules, Dems are then required to vote for that winner on the House floor. This is the 2nd vote, and all Members vote here. To become speaker, you need 218 votes. What Lipinski and others are now threatening is not just to vote against Pelosi in Caucus...
@NoH8_USA No offense taken (and hey, feel free to criticize me any time). This is how it wodks: there are two votes for speaker. The first vote is within the Democratic Caucus - only Dems vote. Whoever gets a majority of Dems wins that vote...
@Indivisible_OR @sundog723 @repblumenauer @RepSchrader @IndivisibleOR5C üëä (also let us know if there are pics/videos - can help promote)
@NoH8_USA I'm *very* pro criticism - I've personally directed a lot of it at Dem party leaders. But he's not threatening criticism. He's threatening to vote with Republicans. This is like a Dem who loses the primary and then runs on a third party ticket to sink the primary winner. Bad.
Hey remember when Lipinski faced a tough primary challenge, and Pelosi stuck with him? Now he's threatening to take down her down. Good luck in 2020 bro. https://t.co/wuPQdQrjGm

All just say - Tuesday was a milestone, not a finish line. Maybe your candidate won in this wave; maybe she didn't. But regardless, we're part of a generational struggle. We're building for the long-term, and we'll keep building. That's how we've won &amp; that's how we'll win.
That was last June. On Tuesday, Georgia 6th elected Democrat @lucymcbath. An incredible leader, an inspiring candidate, a Mother of the Movement. And she won. In that same GA-06 district, she won.
When we got them on the phone, they were JUBILANT. They thought Ossoff wasn't running a great campaign so they weren't surprised. But they were so happy - "We're purple now!" They were excited to hold GOP Handel accountable, and for an upcoming state senate special election.
He didn't win. We were devastated in the moment, even though we knew it was a reach seat. But we didn't want the local Indivisible groups to be depressed. So @Leahgreenb &amp; I called up a handful of the group leaders that night, and we tried to put on a brave face to cheer them up.
Little tidbit on this. Back in June 2017, @IndivisibleTeam was huddled in a bar waiting with bated breath for the GA-06 election results. We desperately wanted Ossoff to win. We thought it would show that a wave was coming - that it was really possible to take back the House... https://t.co/WS5X9VaxM0

This is a wave. This is an historic wave. It's a wave that was built methodically by people who stood up their communities for 2 years to build it drop by drop. And I'm fucking proud of that, and I am more hopeful and excited for 2019 than I was for 2017.
Yes, there were heartbreaking losses last night - there are every election cycle. But had we told people 1 or 2 years ago that we'd achieve this, they would have been skeptical. I know, because we told people 1 and 2 years ago that we could achieve this, and they were skeptical.
Trump lost 2016 by 2 points. He lost last night by 7 points. MI, WI, and PA - 3 of his states in 2016 - elected Dem Senators and Govs last night. Kris Kobach and Scott Walker lost. We created half a dozen new state trifectas and broke their trifectas and supermajorities.
But at ~30 seat gain is enough. Two years ago, people were shocked when we said we'd thought we could take the House. The Republicans built a giant freaking wall based on voter suppression, purging, and gerrymandering, but we overcame it.
Some more context on the wave we built. The popular vote margin in the House overall will be ~7% - the same as the Republican revolution in 1994 and the Tea Party rebellion in 2010. The only reason we wind up with a 60+ seat gain is because of massive gerrymandering post 2010.

But tonight we get to celebrate what we‚Äôve built together. 2 years we could have given in to cynicism and depression. But instead, in response to something incredible dark, hateful, and corrupt we've created an equal and opposite reaction that was bright, hopeful, and righteous.
This isn‚Äôt the end of the fight. Trump is going to react by doing something knee jerk and racist and offensive and damaging to us and the world. Count on it.
OK, so we did the damn thing. We did it together. As a result of this work, this is the beginning of the end of the Trump era. Incredible, inspiring new leaders aren't just going to "resist" Trump - they're going to lead us into the future.
The policy research orgs like @Demos_Org, @amprog, and @CenterOnBudget.The same people they helped get engaged to take down TrumpCare and make the tax scam a political liability were registering voters and GOTVing.
Powerful historic groups like @popdemoc, @WorkingFamilies, @moveon, @ppact, @naral that partnered hand-in-glove with the new emergent energy to build a massive wave that no gerrymandered conservative seawall could stop.
New groups like @swingleft, @dataforprogress, @runforsomething, @flippable, @sisterdistrict that have been recruiting volunteers, training candidates, and raising money to get a new generation of progressives elected.
Groups like @collectivePAC @latinovictory @MiFamiliaVota @unitedwedream @dreamdefenders who are recruiting, training, and building the emerging American electorate, at a time when our communities are under threat.
This was a huge historic victory for the broader grassroots resistance - this was much more than just @IndivisibleTeam.
Over the last few months, @leahgreenb and I traveled to meet with Indivisible groups in WA, OR, CA, AZ, CO, TX, LA, OH, TN, FL, GA, VA, MD, NJ, PA, NY, CT, and MA. I am so so so so proud of Indivisibles who have built this blue wave, drop by drop, doorknock by doorknock.
We saw that in response to something incredibly dark, and damaging, and corrupt, was this incredible equal and opposite reaction that was light, and protective, and righteous. That‚Äôs the force that won tonight.
When Trump was taking office and we were seeing the growing energy to resist, we said the House was in play. What about gerrymandering?? What about how bad midterms are for Dems?? But the energy on the ground was real - we saw it with our own eyes.

Hey friends - take a deep breath. Polls in California don't close for an hour+. Other districts are taking their sweet time counting ballots. The Republicans built a huge seawall, and we built a wave. Still remains to be seen if it's big enough, but I'd rather be us than them.
@indivisibleden CONGRATS AND THANK YOU!!
@jessesingal nah - if Ds take it by 1, that's a wave - it takes a wave to overcome a seawall of voter purging, gerrymandering, and suppression.

@edwardstevens06 Just need majorities in the House and Senate and the political will to do it. Not easy, but fighting fascism isn't supposed to be easy.
@mz right, not so simple - but the point being that there's nothing in the constitution that would require anything more than a majority vote in the House and Senate followed by the president's signature. It's just a matter of political will - and public pressure.

@vanessasteck Which is just to say - we strongly encourage people to do canvassing, phonebanking, and texting (jn that order) because these are proven to be the most impactful tactics.
@vanessasteck Kind of. There is new limited evidence of postcard has some impact during get out the vote. But 2 flags on postcards:	1) It's 1-way. You don't actually get to engage a human being in conversation.	2) You don't get data. So who knows if you're even reaching the right person.
@carynruby @vanessasteck Texting is proven to have a statistically significant impact for 'get out the vote' (telling people their polling location works). But good rule of thumb: the more effort, the more impactful. Usually: canvassing &gt; phonebanking &gt; texting &gt;&gt;&gt; tweeting/facebook posts/petitions/etc
oops I forgot #4:		Canvass and phonebank.		Seriously, literally nothing is proven to be more effective than neighbors talking to neighbors. This is the only way we'll win, and we've only got 5 weekends left to do it.

Most of the top job is about symbolic, moral leadership and agenda setting. It's not rocket science, but you do need to be rooted in something more than yourself.
@ruthyanoff i hear that - I just think moral clarity and strong progressive values are super important. My beef with Trump is less that he's a celebrity, and more that he's an amoral and racist intellectually incurious man child kleptocrat. That he was on the Apprentice is the least of it.
@darwinwoodka Great point - they're not "non-voting" by accident. It's a strategy to systematically depress the vote, particularly in communities of color.
This is the antidote to Trump's sleazy white supremacist-backed kleptocracy. No bullying, no lying, no scare tactics - just a simple, positive, bold progressive vision for the future. Vote Cynthia. https://t.co/riEhhFhHRq

@samswey (I say this as someone who would jump on absolutely any tactical maneuver if it would work - Dems should throw everything they have at this...I just don't see a way right now other than 51 votes on SCOTUS)
@samswey The math doesn't work. If all Dems are out, there's nobody to request a quorum call - only GOP are left in the chamber. 		(And that's even assuming you could get Manchin/Heitkamp/Donnelly etc to go along with it)

@TerriJJenk @IndivisibleTeam I'd recommend against it- they don't care about you because they don't represent you, so it'll just clog their email boxes and make it harder for them to answer real constituents.
Every Senator has a staffer who covers judiciary issues, and every judiciary staffer has an email address. @IndivisibleTeam has helpfully collected all of those here, in case you have any thoughts to share for your senators: https://t.co/CrWj1FuOCJ https://t.co/2GAPKdfZJ8

@TExhausting Former staffer - I'm somewhat mixed on this. If you're not getting through to DC, totally great to call the local offices. But the legislative staff work in DC, not in the local offices.
@Reneguard7 @abirish Good! Keep it up. Don't let them off the hook. Let them know you're watching them and expect a reply.
@TakeActionEUG @lisamurkowski Unfortunately, Murk doesn't care what we think because we're not constituents in Alaska. But Alaskan Indivisibles are working hard at this!
PSA: Senators don't care about your tweets. If you want to change their minds, here are some things you can do:	1) Call them	2) Show up at their local offices	3) Get a local paper letter to the editor	4) Get earned local media pressuring them	5) Work to defeat them for reelection
@zizzyphus @IndivisibleTeam so far literally zero Senate Republicans have announced opposition. We will need 1 or 2 to win. Murkowski and Collins are most likely according to conventional wisdom here in DC.
This is 100% the right reaction. Register voters. Text voters. Call voters. Canvass voters. This congress will not save us. We need a new congress. https://t.co/RcmVj3eB8B

"Settled law" is a politician's dodge. Kavanaugh is being appointed in order to gut Roe.

@Dansonshoes I don't think she's being had. I think she's a smart politician trying to create political cover to do something she knows is very unpopular in her state. Same thing on the vote for the Tax Scam.
@niinoshdelsarto exactly what I was thinking of. She's not misinformed - she's smart and knows what she's doing. It's just not what Mainers want her to do.
This is, to use a technical term, BS. Collins is searching for political cover to vote for Kavanaugh because she knows Mainers don't want him. But don't fall for it - a vote for Kavanaugh is a vote to gut Roe v Wade. https://t.co/6uK3AJMpwX

@sidney_b oh cool! I'm flagging this for our political team to take a look.
@sidney_b oh interesting - you've got a list of local indivisible group endorsements?
@sidney_b Ah, maybe I'm misreading? You're not counting races like the MA congressional primaries?
@sidney_b Friendly FYI - factual inaccuracy on that 46 figure for Indivisible. Those aren't all open-race endorsements.		Also, while not factually inaccurate, seems misleading to include TBD races in the denominator and count them as losses.
@NateSilver538 Separately - there's a basic factual error on "open primary" endorsement numbers. The 46 figure for Indivisible includes several endorsements in non-open races. Recommend your team review the data a bit more closely.
@NateSilver538 FYI Nate - the win % is a little misleading because not all the primaries are over. E.g. your team is counting the NY Gov in the denominator, but it hasn't happened yet.

@BabiesFree Oh sorry thought I answered - I don't think anybody should be endorsing in primaries and the advocating that you take your ball and go home if you lose. Applies to lefties and establishment Dems alike.
@FauquierResist5 @tomperriello 100%
@BabiesFree I'm pro primary and pro unity in the general - and I think it ought to apply to everybody regardless of ideology. Indivisible literally declines to endorse in primaries unless the candidate agrees to endorse the winner.
The most egregious example of this are the scores of establishment elected Dems in Maryland declining to endorse their progressive Dem nominee for governor. AOC in contrast has embraced winners of primaries even if she endorsed their opponents. See: https://t.co/uZKWVdPQFc https://t.co/Fbv6tTH8mv

@MattBruenig @SenatorBaldwin @SenSchumer hey you're engaging in real advocacy almost! I'll count it as a partial victory.
If our plan for victory is righteous acts of political courage like @SenatorBaldwin's, we're going to lose. We need safe Dems to unify NOW to make it easier for less-safe Dems to take the plunge. @SenSchumer needs to lead the Dem caucus ASAP to make it happen. /end
But now all these safe Dems are leaving her out to dry. Her opponent can run ads saying "Sen. Baldwin is more liberal than that fellow from Hawaii!" @brianschatz tweets a big game, but why isn't he helping his fellow Dem senators? Same goes for all blue state Dems. UNIFY ALREADY.
And that's what makes @SenatorBaldwin's act of political bravery so important. She wasn't SUPPOSED to come out against Kavanaugh before safe Dems did. But she did. This is a real, significant act of political leadership.
Take @SenatorDurbin. He's generally a good senator! Very safe seat. Won his last election by more than 10 points. He's not up for reelect until 2020. He's also the top Dem on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution. If Durbin &amp; his ilk won't unify with Dems, we're screwed.
I'm seeing a ton of press about how Minority Leader @SenSchumer doesn't have sway over the 3 Dems who voted for Gorsuch. That misses the point - what is he doing to #whipthevote to unify the safe blue state Dems? We won't get to domino #2 above if he doesn't tip over domino #1.
Remember, the strategy to defeat Kavanaugh is simple: https://t.co/546hoqC89b
This is a huge deal because we're NEVER going to get Collins or Murkowski against Kavanaugh if we can't even get safe blue state Dems onboard. Hell, we're not going to get Heitkamp, Donnelly, or Manchin onboard if we can't lock up these safe Dems ASAP.
I'm not seeing NEARLY enough press on how much of a hero @SenatorBaldwin is. It's incredible. This Senator is up for reelection in a Trump-won state THIS YEAR. And she's demonstrating more leadership to #SaveSCOTUS than all these blue state Dems. Quick thread on what this means: https://t.co/UVp6mqYBNh

@IRaiseUFacts Whoa
@KLucasMcKay Very pro ranked choice.
@KLucasMcKay That‚Äôs what primaries are for though! If we allow Dems who don‚Äôt like the result to reject it, it undermines the whole process.
Clarification: she didn't like the winner of the Dem party, so she switched from Dem to "unaffiliated" and got in the race to split the vote in November. If you're an elected Dem and not rallying around the Dem primary winner in your area, you're doing it wrong.
@chrilamb @NancyFloreen Totally right - it‚Äôd be more accurate to say she didn‚Äôt like the Dem primary winner, so she switched her party affiliation from Dem to split the vote in November.
@TheTurbantor @NancyFloreen Totally right - it‚Äôd be more accurate to say she didn‚Äôt like the Dem primary winner, so she switched her party affiliation from Dem to split the vote in November.
@CathyNDavidson @NancyFloreen Yep. Primaries are a great opportunity to debate the direction of the party. But if you take your ball and go home when you lose, you‚Äôre essentially playing for the other team.
TERRIBLE. @NancyFloreen lost a competitive Dem primary. She now switched to ‚Äúunaffiliated‚Äù to run in the general. This is how we split the vote and lose. Principle is: run in a primary but always endorse the winner. Her Dem political career should be over. https://t.co/9VrOi26Dkz

@HdrunnelsPA @IndivisibleTeam @NARAL @WeDemandJustice @PPact @nwlc @MoveOn @CAPAction This is a really damaging rumor that I've seen floating out there.

Gotta focus on what works.
@IndivisibleUkia Yeah :( it‚Äôs a bummer. Wish we could just bombard her office, but gotta just do what works
@IndivisibleUkia Argh, I've seen this elsewhere too - this is a really damaging rumor. She noted that most of the calls coming to her were from the lower 48 - that's because she dismisses those calls. Elected officials - Murk and Collins included - care about their constituents.
@MillCityCrochet @eprophotog @SenatorCollins Sorry she won't. She only cares about constituents. Got friends or family still in Maine? You could mobilize them!

@bubblerenter This really isn't true. I get the urge to do something, but when non-Alaskans call her, it:	1) Drowns out the voices of real constituents	2) Allows her to dismiss calls as just an out-of-state leftwing campaign		Worse than a distraction, this is counterproductive.

@Fineimherenow Literally this morning Indivisibles in Phoenix were outside Flake's office making noise. This is GREAT. You should join them (or if you're not in Phoenix, join the groups in your area): https://t.co/3GOJZVz7rJ
@Fineimherenow With McCain you have little leverage, but he is not expected to vote. Flake isn't running for reelection, but he is VERY concerned about his reputation as a Republican willing to stand up to Trump (nevermind that this reputation has little basis in reality). So these rules apply.
@brianweeden Yeah this isn't SCOTUS-specific. (Except the part about House of Reps.)
Watch Ilyse üëá https://t.co/qKeSMyXB0J
@BostonBedelia Unfortunately a fairytale. I'd be shouting from the rooftops if that would work. But McConnell will crush it - he has the votes to. The only way to win is to get to 50 votes.
@MadJoyTrimble Yes! We're actually opening phone banks to do out-of-state calls. Text SCOTUS to 97-779 to get signed up for that and other related work.
@PeteB2 @AJentleson We do for internal planning...lemme see if we can make it public.
@IndNOVAwest Thanks! (Side note how was I not following y'all until just now?)
But if the choice is between real-world action and money, PLEASE take action. It was a quixotic people power campaign that killed TrumpCare. People power will #SaveSCOTUS. Red state, blue state, purple state - doesn't matter. We need you in this fight with us now. /end
Want to do more? Well, you can donate. In addition to @IndivisibleTeam, a TON of groups are fighting hard on this - @NARAL, @WeDemandJustice, @PPact, @nwlc, @moveon, @CAPAction and many others. Pick a favorite or a few, and fund them to run this campaign throughout the country.
If you want to get plugged into (or set up) local events in your state THIS week, check out: https://t.co/JWmgJKS8ej. 		If you want to get plugged into more local advocacy opportunities, you can text "SCOTUS" to 977-79 (that's for @IndivisibleTeam)
3) Get local media attention. Senators can ignore you, but they can't ignore press that makes them look weak. Out-of-touch, hypocritical senators who hide from their constituents have a harder time getting reelected. Local press coverage makes that threat real.
2) The more effort, the more impact. Calls are good; in-person actions are the best. The medium matters. When you demonstrate that you're willing to give up a couple hours to show up in person, it sends a strong message. If you just sign a form letter, it sends a weak message.
So what works? Here's are three rules of thumb:	1) Focus on YOUR two Senators. Your senators (whether GOP or Dem) really only care about constituents (and rich/famous people). They wake up thinking about reelection - remind them that you only vote for leaders who #saveSCOTUS.
6) Being sad and defeatist. BUCK THE HELL UP. This situation sucks, and the path to victory is narrow, but it's there. We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves. We can win if we do the work, but ONLY if we do the work.		Exceptions: There are no exceptions.
5) Fairy tale procedural tactics. Dems don't have the majority, so they can't copy McConnell's delay tactics on Garland. We MUST get 50 votes.		Exceptions: Minority Leader Schumer SHOULD threaten, cajole, twist arms - do EVERYTHING to unite Dems. NOW is the time for hardball.
4) Tweets, FB, etc. Social media just isn't that effective at pressuring Senators. They usually dismiss antagonistic social media as noise.		Exceptions: If it goes viral &amp; gets them embarrassing press, or if you're using social media to recruit for real-world, in-state actions.
3) Petitions. Members of Congress frankly just don't care about petitions. Feel free to sign them if it makes you feel better, just know they have no impact.		Exceptions: Petitions can be useful at the local level and if delivered in person in a way that garners media attention.
2) Pressure on House members. Members of the House of Reps are very important for many things, but they have no vote on Supreme Court justices.		Exception: Could be worthwhile to get every Dem House member in red states to publicly oppose, creating contrast with GOP senators.
1) Pressure on Senators who don't represent you. If you don't live in Maine, Sen. Collins doesn't care what you think. That's not even a knock on Collins - that's just how representative democracy works.		Exceptions: You are a millionaire, famous person, or big campaign donor.
Former congressional staffer here. I'm seeing a few different tactics/strategies being thrown out to #SaveSCOTUS, and a fair amount of misinformation. Here's a short thread on a few tactics that won't work.

This is why the events this week are important. Swift, united Dem opposition across the country is critical for putting pressure on the swingable GOP. Regardless of your state, we need your voice this week to #SaveSCOTUS.
Couple things to keep in mind ahead of SCOTUS announcement today:	1) McCain is unlikely to vote	2) So if all Dems oppose, Trump needs every single GOP vote	3) GOP like Collins don‚Äôt want to be the deciding vote	4) But...three Dems voted for Gorsuch (Heitkamp, Donnelly, Manchin) https://t.co/4OyYQyiAsK

@_waleedshahid @NickMeharry @markjengler @zeynep @Leahgreenb Yeah I kept meaning to get around to it, and Uprising was a good nudge.
@NickMeharry @markjengler @zeynep Literally just stared it today! @Leahgreenb recommended it next. Also read Rules for Radicals for the first time after Uprising. The tactics chapter is excellent/timeless but everything else is meh.
As someone who accidentally got thrown into a social movement, I learned a ton. I found myself writing ‚ÄúYes! Same!‚Äù in the margins throughout. Not just theory - lots of practical insights. It felt like it was describing *exactly* what Indivisible is aiming for. Highly recommend!
The authors seamlessly weave together organizing theory (mainly Alinsky &amp; Piven/Cloward) and a ton of very compelling histories of domestic and international social movements - MLK, Otpor in Serbia, Earth First!, Gandhi, Egyptian revolution, Act Up, Dreamers, &amp; more.

@jacobtaber That‚Äôs right - but Puerto Rico and DC would both like to be states with representation in Congress. Both have more residents than Wyoming, and both have zero voting senators/reps. (Splitting up California would take more state legislative work)

@sallyann216 Yes it is absurd. But the Constitution does require 2 senators per state. For California to get more, it‚Äôd either need to split itself up into a couple or more states, or we‚Äôd need a constitutional amendment. Some interesting reading: https://t.co/fupzEDa6in

@JuergenKlinge @Leahgreenb You know I typically agree that words from electeds are cheap - but I actually really do think folks who stake out bold moral policy positions deserve praise. It makes it easier for other electeds to follow. Then when they take the majority, we gotta hold them to it.

This is great - @RepBarbaraLee is a champion and strong friend to the resistance. https://t.co/7cE9vGF3rX
See @maddow totally nails this. @SenateDems MUST become the #NotDoormatsCaucus. That's the only path to victory. Hold the Dem caucus together and pick up one or two more. That's how we win. https://t.co/bfAayEtAjJ
@trix6 I hear that too, but the way to my heart is winning. I don't want nice speeches or flashy media events - I want to win. That means keeping the caucus together and picking up a couple votes.
@TheAldridges You and I agree - we've got to stop this. But how? Break which rules? Seriously that's what this comes down to. If Senate Dems lie down in the street or flee to Canada or chain themselves to McConnell's car, he'll still go right ahead and call the vote. We have to win the vote.
@Jkins1 Don't get me wrong - I TOTALLY support public pressure here. We won't succeed without it. There needs to be a serious political cost for packing the court. If we just shrug our shoulders and say "well that's just what they do all the time" we will lose.
@lcsboyz @BadJohnBrown That's my memory too. I would have 100% fully supported a recess appointment.
@yourltldogtoo Hey I hear you - I absolutely think Dems should use every tool they've got and push them to and beyond the limits. But none of that changes the fact that they're in the minority and McConnell has the power to force a vote. That's reality - and to win we've got to recognize it.
@bridgesparisa yep - there's a narrow pathway to victory here. Not guaranteed, but it's there. We all should absolutely fight this with everything we've got.
And of course worth noting that the reason WHY McConnell can force a vote on this is that he changed the rules last year for Gorsuch to lower the votes required down to 51. He couldn't win the game, so he used his power to change the game.
I've not been shy about calling out Dem leadership, but this is bluster. McConnell can &amp; will bring this up for a floor vote. Dem Leadership's responsibility is to unite the caucus &amp; pick up a couple more. Winning is possible, but don't get distracted by fairy tale tactics. https://t.co/BSN48EXMZT
RT @IndivisibleTeam: Republicans couldn't repeal the ACA or end @PPFA funding through the legislative process, so now they‚Äôre going to try‚Ä¶
@HarryTokus @SenSchumer Agree constituents in those states are going to have to push too. They've got tools, and the Minority Leader has tools to keep his caucus in line. We all need to play our roles perfectly...and we'll need a lucky break. Tough, not guaranteed, but not impossible.
To be clear, he's got the full backing of NY Indivisibles here. Within a couple hours of the Kennedy news, more than a dozen NY groups joined a statement asking Schumer to fight hard. If he succeeds, I bet there'll be Indivisible parades in his honor. https://t.co/xnKup5R2of
As a reminder, in addition to every single GOP Senator, 3 Dem Senators voted for Gorsuch:	-Donnelly (IN)	-Manchin (WV)	-Heitkamp (ND)		@SenSchumer is going to have to whip those votes, and then pick up a couple more. Big test for the leader. Can he lead his caucus? Hope he does.
This is the best succinct description of the SCOTUS strategy I've seen. It's a narrow and uncertain path to victory, but it's there. https://t.co/l1f3xnBTcb
Things moving fast - but we'll be doing a Facebook live tomorrow with experts to go over what you can do on SCOTUS. Send us your questions - we'll try to answer all we can. https://t.co/EPXwWv2cKh
And another thing: Republican Justice Kennedy knew EXACTLY what he was doing resigning now, 4 months before an election, instead of next year. Can we learn the lesson already? When the GOP gets power, they use every tool to entrench their power. We can fight back or we can lose.

@AndrewRostan @tomwatson @Leahgreenb Thanks! And to be clear, it's the Illinois Indivisible groups that are absolutely crushing it. I spoke at a big election kickoff convening orchestrated by @IndivisibleChi a few weeks ago and was stunned by the awesome operation those folks had put together.
@tomwatson @AndrewRostan I know lots of people have crappy experiences on twitter, but I've found it's possible to have good back and forth convos with folks if you stay positive, assume good intentions, and ignore trolls.
@tomwatson absolutely - we see that all over. Sometimes groups want to endorse, sometimes not. If they do endorse, for national to get involved we require that they commit to getting behind the winner - whoever it turns out to be. No taking your ball and going home.
@tomwatson This is a good counter - midterm voters look different than presidential year voters. I'm feeling good though this year (really good!), and I think primary debate can be healthy. Gets folks involved, and let's them debate direction of the party. And then we get behind the winner!
@tomwatson Hey Trump won - I think we can both agree nothing will ever be in the bag again. On this one, Indivisible hasn't endorsed and won't endorse until local groups decide. I'm cool with locals deciding without national's input, and then getting behind their choice.
@tomwatson It's a big state! Def has conservative pockets (I'm from TX which has some progressive pockets, so I get it). But here are the past 5 presidential outcomes in NY:	'16: D+21	'12: D+28	'08: D+27	'04: D+17	'00: D+25		If Ds can't win in NY in the year of the Blue Wave...god help us.

@ScottElliotG oh yeah, i see that. (Side note that you prob won't agree with: would like to see total cost, not just % of income. % of income, imo, downplays the inequity here)
@ScottElliotG regardless, would also be cool to see JGTRRA and EGTRRA combined for comparison.
@ScottElliotG er, looking at your chart, 2017 was big cut for the top 1% too...what am I missing? That 3.4% is larger than any band in 2017 other than 95-99, and it's larger than any band in 2001 other than top 1%.

As a reminder, this expensive Wall Street deregulation bill requires 60 votes to pass. It will NOT become law unless at least 9 Senate Dems give McConnell the votes he needs. Don‚Äôt want your Senators to vote for it? Then let them know asap. https://t.co/SulFyaYq1A
