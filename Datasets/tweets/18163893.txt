4. Why more marital happiness reported in GOP? Perhaps related to a family focus on the part of more conservative husbands—especially religious ones—and to higher levels of joint marital commitment on the part of Republican spouses. https://t.co/VWI2cqGoTn
3. The “marriage divide” is about more than class—things like education and income. It’s also about culture and community. We need to think about the 3 Cs: cash, culture, and community.
2. Republicans/Conservatives are much more likely to be married, to be in drama-free relationships, and to attach greater importance to marriage and parenthood, compared to other Americans. #marriage #family #tcot

The California election system “just defies logic to me." @SpeakerRyan @thehill 		Read our update: https://t.co/WHpKnxd0hB #California #Election2018 https://t.co/EcCBVZCVJI
In some California counties this year, absentee ballots were mailed to every adult -- whether they requested it or not! And, California accepts ballots up to a week after Election Day and gives voters with rejected ballots a second chance. https://t.co/WHpKnxd0hB
California Dems also got creative with young people, launching a pre-registration program for 16 &amp; 17 year-olds. (A way for the Left to lock in voters "while they're young &amp; more likely to identify as liberal Democrats.")	89,000 minors participated... only 10% registered as GOP.
Then there's the "motor voter fraud." Everyone who interacts with the DMV in California is automatically registered to vote. There have been at least 77,000 cases of double registrations. #California #election
California has new laws that let illegal immigrants vote (San Francisco spent $310,000 taxpayer dollars registering 49 of them), prisoners, and -- thanks to a 2015 court ruling -- felons! #California
In California, the cheat is on:	- Allowed vote harvesting, which lets anyone "walk into an elections office and hand over truckloads of vote-by-mail envelopes with ballots inside, no questions asked, no verified records kept." #midterms2018 https://t.co/WHpKnxd0hB
