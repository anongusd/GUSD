Do in-depth study on the truths of Venezuela &amp; u'll come 2find its all abt crony capitalsm &amp; oligarchs salivatin ovr the prospcts of raping it of its natural resourcs 4 billions n profits &amp; Trump is playn along with oligarchs wishes like Bush Jr &amp; Obama did
@kdmc0932 @VictorGarden1 @LadyRedWave @USAloveGOD @POTUS Un4tunatly the commitments, risks &amp; sacrifices of US armed service personnel r abused 1 too many times by the ruling class restn peacefully @ night known they will nevr b prosecutd 4 their human rights violations nor war crimes they ordrd just ask formr Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler
@LadyRedWave @GmanFan45 @POTUS What @POTUS is pushing 4 is the equivalnt of puttn a vry expnsiv bandage on a wound that needs 2b stapled shut or lik takn n expnsiv form of Tylenol 2 mask the symptoms of a vry serious nfection. Trump lik far 2 many Americns r 2 uninformd 2 undrstand this https://t.co/5nebBZkQ9C

@aleoniea @FLOTUS While 18.5 million Americans live in extreme poverty
@GOP @FLOTUS The peopl of Venezuela don't want us there. If us leadership whethr it b Trump admin or his predecessrs truly cared abt the well-being of the Venezuelan peopl us leadership wld retract all  its economc sanctions. Koch bros &amp; Exxon r salivating ovr the prospects of Venezuelan oil
@SebGorka @TheDemocrats Too bad he's not part of the democratic estblment. Maybe if we ddn't hav 2 party rigged political system perhaps we the people wld hav sum representation that outweighd interests of Wall Street, military industrial complex, fossil fuel companies etc. BTW Trump isn't much youngr
@WatchYourRepsMN @SenatorGoggin Its apparently vital that we send as much of America's wealth 2the wealthiest individuals &amp; corporations so they can use that wealth on stock buybacks, advancing  automation 2 decrease the need 4 paid human employees, financing their preferred politicians, &amp; hoarding it overseas
@SenatorGoggin oh yeah, I almost 4got about the fact the private 4-profit health insurers that determind my acute rehab from spinal cord injury/paralysis rather than my medical rehab team. it's also same 4-profit system that caused my dad to sell our house after he broke his hip back in the 80s
@NickHanauer meanwhile single payer healthcare (Medicare for all) is taken for granted by citizens of every other modernized country in the world.
@RepJasonLewis his judicial record suggests he sides with corporations over the people much like judge Neil Gorsuch. it's not what our forefathers envisioned when they advocated 4 a governing body by the people for the people
@freeboulder @RealJamesWoods lol, ur sadly the typical misinformd gullible American &amp; evry independent journalist that actually goes 2 Venezuela completely debunk ur narrative. Corporations run US domestic &amp;foregn policies &amp;use our politicians &amp; military 2 try 2 get what they want 4 cheap like Venezuelan oil
@RepJasonLewis According 2 analysis by capitalist billionaire @NickHanauer if it werent 4 corrupt neoclassical policies of the past 35-40 yrs the median American making $50k would actually be making $92k-$95k &amp; its precisely why the middle class on down has been &amp; continues 2b in decline
@mrslisamstewar1 @DisabledResist @AmeriicaTV @DaniGraychik @realDonaldTrump seeking Asylum in the US is legal according to US law as written
@GOP considering US has ben a nation for 242 yrs &amp; ICE has ben around for 13 yrs it appears GOP is supporting larger federal govt than necessary as we were surviving just fine as a nation b4 creation of ICE &amp; most likely do just fine if it were removed from our discretionary spendn
@AFCHighburySoul @FrancesRauer @HouseGOP he did a $54 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia a nation that advocates 4 the spread of fundamental Mohammedism; arms, finances, &amp; trains extremists terrorist networks; &amp; carrying out a genocide in Yemen. Obama is every bit of a war criminal as Bush Jr. &amp; should be in prison
@cefilby if voter fraud was statistically a pressing concern it might be a better investment. Btw, FBI investigation was never solely about conspiracy Trump collusion w/Russia its just what the piss pour corporate news media propaganda chose to spin it's narrative
@FrancesRauer @AFCHighburySoul @HouseGOP yeah by bailn out the bankrs who drove us n2 the ditch insted of arrestn them &amp; not bailn out homeownrs who wer foreclosd out of ther homz; givn us privat corp hlth nsurer frendly right wing hlthcare law. 2day 63% of US citzens cant afford $500 emergency  18.5 mil n xtreme povrty
@Batyalee @VictoriaH1962 @MarkMallardi @Tay_J_Jones @DarlaKramer13 @ProudResister @womensmarch thats why obama baild out the banks nsted of the homeownrs b n foreclosd out of ther homz, &amp;then 1 of his 1st acts back n publc life is 2 take a $400k check frm a bank aftr he made sure the banks wernt regulatd proprly. Gav us corp hlth insurer friendly right wing healthcare law
@Batyalee @VictoriaH1962 @MarkMallardi @Tay_J_Jones @DarlaKramer13 @ProudResister @womensmarch Really? using corporate donors is the essence of being corrupt
@RealJamesWoods US wld b faci the same predicmnt if it facn globl economc warfare 4ovr a decad &amp; oligarchs hoardn life essentls n lockd up warehouses. US govt is enactn a coup agnst VZ on bhalf of corp oil ntrests just like it did 2 Iran n 1953 &amp; look how that turnd out u idiotc Hollywood elitst
@koolindependent @HouseGOP 95% of income gains went to those at the top. All in all left-leaning citizens should b frustrated with Obama who governed more like a moderate Republican &amp; also made bush-era tax cuts permanent not to mention we're just another in a long line of corrupt establishment politicians
@AFCHighburySoul @HouseGOP 95% of income gains during Obama's time went to those at the top. He became just another one of those corrupt establishment politicians that leftist citizen should really be frustrated with
@SenateGOP He is a corporate friendly judge with a judicial record of favoring corporations over the people just like Neil Gorsuch. So much for draining the swamp out of DC. Trump is simply ensuring that America's future continues to be run by corporations
@jfmarlin you're assuming everyone has the ability to drive
@sean_spoonts btw, 1 duzn't hav 2 go 2 a Registrars office 2 officially registr 2 vote per fedral standards. U also appear 2 lack a tru understandn or perhaps flawd or ignorant perpective of the daily livelihoods of the disabld, the poor, &amp; elderly; sometimes a person is a combination of all 3

@cefilby What you just described is the federal government's voter registration requirements. "voter id" laws require a separate voter id card which require extra resources to create and print.
@creature4hire @GOP he was simply the continuation of the same corrupt neoclassical that have taken the middle class on down and thrown them overboard for the past 35-40 years
@RtkB_Strafer @GOP Infowars is a great alternative ;-)
@cathymcmorris 21st century economics? ok you must have forgotten that your recent tax reform stems  from the failed 20th century trickle up economics disguised as trickle down economics
@kylegriffin1 @Kris_Sacrebleu it was also our intelligence agencies who lied &amp;convincd us that Saddam Hussein had WMs &amp; that Syrian Pres Assad usd chemical weapons on his own peopl both of which wer fals. US intelligence overthrew Iran's electd gov't n 1953 &amp; the country has been a mess evr since
@GameOnPatriots That is just another act of voter suppression and it would be an unnecessary cost to taxpayer while it can also  be argued that its a form of making gov't bigger. it would make it more difficult for the disabled, poor and seniors to participate in the voting pprocess

@jessesgirl95 @imaminasotan @kdaudt @mnhousegop it would b mor accurate 2 say that the downfall of the American healthcare system bgan n 1973 when Nixon signd legislation that allowed the Corporate Health insurance providrs 2 bcome 4-profit 4 the 1st time n US. B4 then legislation prevented them from bcoming predatory 4-profit

@realgraveytrain @colbster @maxthecat1995 @Tweetsfor45 @DSanchez1669 that is a result of how much crap is put n our food that we eat. if u cant see that the socioeconomic times 4 America's middle class on down has steadily ben n decline 4 35-40 yrs (9% worker wage growth despite 73% worker productivity increase) well I can't fix ignorance

@BlackArmyHolly @realgraveytrain @maxthecat1995 @Tweetsfor45 @DSanchez1669 what is happening in Venezuela is the US with its economic sanctions has been attempting a coup to get the leftist gov't overthrown &amp; replaced by a far-right authoritative thatll do mor favorable contracts w/western oil corps just like we did to Iran back in 1953

@realDonaldTrump we've been a country for 242 years and have had ICE for 14 years, which is an example of expanding bigger government that we as taxpayers don't need. it's literally a fascist agency created by the Bush administration that preyed on the fears of its own paranoid culture

@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump okay i stand partialy corrected US sent $400 mil n actual paper Euros which is a lot of money but a far cry from ur $150 bil claim. The Shah was supported by us and put n2 powr aftr US-UK completd coup of pm mouzedeh. The Shah was oppressiv &amp; ovrthrown by the ppl led Aytollah
@cathymcmorris more &amp; more young adults w/disabilities r becoming institutionalized &amp;/or dying which is about 2 get worse with cuts 2 Medicare, MA, &amp; social security disability. Yet champion urself as an advocate 4 disability prosperity while enabling policies that hurt &amp;/or kill the disabled
@cathymcmorris that's a result of neoclassical policies of the last 35-40 yrs. where workers wage growth has stagnated to 9% increase while in that time worker productivity increased 73%, but then somehow CEO pay n 1980 was 30x worker wage ballooned 2 500x worker wage
@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump while conveniently left Saudi Arabia off of his list of countries on his travel ban likely related to not wanting to Trump Corp. businesses in Saudi Arabia
@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump while u r focusd on US govt &amp; corp news medias overxtensiz propaganda of Iran bn an existential threat u may b ovrlookn  that a majorty of 9/11 terrorists came frm Saudi Arabia &amp;Trump did a $110 bil. arms deal w Saudis &amp; joind them n a war danc whil theyr comitn genocid n Yemen
@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump Again, we didn't give Iran any money for hostages. We gave them back their frozen assets the US was hoarding of which we as taxpayers were payn the interest &amp; in exchange the Iranian leadership agreed 2 allow greater nuclear inspections which were working and being complied with
@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump those r the reason a numbr of Iranian citizens hate us &amp; Trumps pulln out of the nuclear deal &amp; slapping sanctions furthr their angr along w/the fact that US long standn foreign policy 2wards the middl east has ben antithetical 2 the morals &amp; values US leadrs proclaim 2 represent
@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump the US &amp; UK allies F'up Iran when they wer n the midst of bcoming a seculr democracy &amp; Iranian Prez Mousedeh was lookn 2 spred democracy but the US &amp; oil corp secretly dont want democracies n the middl east cuz mor of the oil $$ will go 2 the middle eastern ppl than oil corp

@TS1USA @Soared4Truth @crufreeman both sides are paid to deflect our attention while they secretly send our tax money to Wall Street and Exxon Mobil
@kdaudt you fought for funding cuts 2 human services that would have increased the likelihood that your constituents w/disabilities would end up in institutions or dying while costing taxpayers more $$. That's something Hitler literally did during the era of Nazi Germany!! so low :-(!
@Soared4Truth @dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump Trump wasnt forcd 2 cave no 1 put a gun 2 his head. his uninspiring need 2 b likd preventd him frm havin the strength 2 giv the middl fingr 2 the corrupt congrss &amp; then march to the podium &amp; say "'America ur congrss is bought &amp; Im not goin 2work w/ themuntil they drop their donrs
@Soared4Truth @dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump Hillary surely wouldve @ minimum increasd our tensions w/Russia &amp; N. Korea as well as any other adversary out there. While Trump hasnt expandd on Obama' 7 war however he has ratcheted up activities from 34 bombs/day to 121 bombs/day &amp; did $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia
@Soared4Truth @dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump The concept is learning from history to avoid the bad and build on the good. Anyways, speaking of the present. America has been and continues to trend towards the same fate as the Roman Empire. Mounting debt, global imperialism, &amp; military overreach
@Queen1Icy @mflynnJR crap, darn typos. i meant to say we will continue to lose for as long as we continue to elect corrupted candidates regardless of political party. need to pay attention to candidates list of donors
@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump do u realiz that the $150 ur referring 2 was really frozen assets of which we as taxpayrs wer payn interest on up until the day they were gin back? The Iran nuclear deal while not perfect was workn &amp; maybe the 1 good thing Obama did in his 8 yrs? BTW not resisting nor a democrats
@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump do u recogniz that the originating sourc of Iranian hatrd is frm when US &amp; UK partnered 2 overthrow democractically electd president Mohamed Mouzedeh n 1953 cuz he was lookn 2 renegotiate oil deals with BP so he could giv mor of the natural resourc money 2 the Iranian people?....
@dollahollayo @glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump yes Obama is indeed out and the monetary corruption has remained fully entrenched in our government from the president on down, but one might not notice unless one uses objective critical listening, reading &amp; thinking skills with the courage to question what one knows to be true
@Queen1Icy @mflynnJR we the people will continue to lose for long as we continue to vote for candidates regardless of political affiliation.
@mflynnJR You tool! we just had a special ops staff sergeant killed in Somalia while our commander in chief was shaking hands with a dictator!
@AmericanDiaries @plantlady293 Monetary corruption has hijacked US gov't year after year from president on down &amp; it's a contagious bipartisan disease that has no signs of slowing down. Time 4 armed services 2 purge DC of all the corrupt enemies lurking within our federal gov't including the plutocrat-in-chief
A fair number of my fellow Americans are frequently bickering back-and-forth about which side of the political aisle has fallen further off the side of the cliff; meanwhile, Wall-Streeters, Raytheon, &amp; ExxonMobil are laughing &amp; running away with our tax money!
@_braxtons @pixelthecat369 @tonyresists @realDonaldTrump ur the 1 displaying suspect reading comprehension. Nowhere n the original comment was the constitution ever mentioned. Its possible 4fathers our had a slip in forsight &amp; couldn't imagine the federal government as whole becoming so tainted with monetary corruption.
@realDonaldTrump if we as taxpayers didn't have to send our money 2 pay 4 your golf outings 3 out of 4 weekends maybe then we would be to afford a few more high profile investigations directed @ the of Obama, the Clintons, Bush Jr, etc.. Gov't waste fraud &amp; abuse continues 2 roll right along! :-(
@glp6200 @pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump corruption in government is what needs to change
@pamelaclearwood @realDonaldTrump are you referring to the defense contractors and private prison contractors who are profiting "bigly" off of our government's immigration policies" People need to start understanding that corporations, not humans, craft our government policies both foreign and domestic
@CarrieRuud are you not ashamd of supporting legislation that if passd wouldve led 2 an increased rate of young adults w/disabilities becoming institutionalizd [more costly] and/or dying?  that's literally something Hitler did. If ur husband or son became paralyzed would u think differently?

In the mist of the controvrsy of migrant kids b n separatd frm parnts Im wondring: What abt the fact that mor &amp; mor young adult Amercans w/disabilities r b n forcd frm ther homz &amp; becomn institutionalizd @ a rate not seen since Hitlr bgan enactin it durin the era of Nazi Germany?
@peggyflanagan What about the fact that more and more young adult Americans with disabilities are being forced their homes and becoming institutionalized at a rate not seen since Hitler began enacting it during the era of Nazi Germany?
@paulgazelka why? so you and the state GOP can continue to push the same kind of legislation that would increase the number Minnesotans w/disabilities &amp; seniors who become institutionalized? That's something Hitler also loved to do!!!
@virginiafoxx screw the lobbyists 4 big pharma, alcohol industry, &amp; tobacco industry and bring an end 2 the prohibition of marijuana. Holland has legalizd marijuana 4 anyone 16 &amp; up, and yet U.S. has 2x the amount of marijuana use as Holland per capita. Why? Holland made marijuana use boring
@cathymcmorris Yeah its sure boomin 4 the top 10% who own 83% of the stock market &amp; they'r likely 2 own mor of it as the Tax cuts giv them so much mor money. meanwhil workr wage growth since 1980 has increasd a stagnatd 9% even tho workr productivity has increasd its 73% n that same timeframe
@realDonaldTrump your allowing your minions to bankrupt this country by averaging 121 bombs dropped per day which comes to roughly 44,000/yr. or 1 bomb every 12 minutes! Obama averaged 34 bombs dropped/day. What exactly are u all in DC trying to prove? #warmachine #wargames
@PressSec @CBSNews @POTUS why are you so concerned about one little report that is likely based on an unsubstantiated rumor?
@WhiteHouseCEA @federalreserve 83% of stocks are owned by those at the top 10% of the socioeconomic ladder &amp; is simply an indicator of how the wealthy are doing. Meanwhile working class has seen stagnated 9% wage increase since 1980
@KarinHousley @GoPolyMet Oh really? Is that why you were in support of the GOP state budget bill that if passed would have drastically increased the likelihood of Northern minnesotans with disabilities becoming institutionalized and or dying?
@WatchYourRepsMN @theforemanmn That's because the Democratic establishment and the Republican establishment are secretly in bed together with no regard to taking the middle class on down and continuing to throw it overboard
@skiptownson @OccPottsville @ReedRothch1ld @RiversideWeekly @PressSec @POTUS No thats not what I'm implyin as Im well aware Obama took us from 2 Wars to 7 Wars. Howevr what Im implyin is the Trump Admin has taken Obama's activities &amp; increasd it. Obama reportdly averagd 34 bombs droppd a day while Trump averags 121 bombs droppd per day Both r unsustainabl
@FreddyJoeSuess @MelVogelsang @poconomtn @stacy_redvirgo @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews He didn't say anything that was untrue. If anything he's reminding the president that he is negotiating with a dictator.
@skyrocketkday @GeorgetteRain @b765a5e013ce401 @PressSec @POTUS what are the Vegas odds on which one of the 2 bends over first?
@skiptownson @ReedRothch1ld @OccPottsville @RiversideWeekly @PressSec @POTUS dropping an average of 121 bombs a day and having 80 countries slam the U.S. for its habit of bombing hospitals and schools (war crimes) and continuing to be the cause of a global refugee crisis is not a description of sanity
@RiversideWeekly @PressSec @POTUS That's doubtful considering 80 countries have slammed the U.S. for it's habit of bombing hospitals and schools.
@PressSec @POTUS it's likely lil rocket man uses many photos taken during the summit in the form of propaganda to manipulate his people into thinking that he and North Korea are legitimately at the same level in terms of global prowess
@MelVogelsang @poconomtn @stacy_redvirgo @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle is a neocon corporate propaganda tool who sold her soul to the propaganda machines. Chris Wallace is one of just a few who actually bring "fair and balance" to corporate news media.
@HaasEugene2 @poconomtn @_IamAnita_D peace breaking out? U.S. is currently bombing the crap out of at least 8 different 3rd world poverty stricken nations. Average bombs dropped per day: Bush Jr. 27; Obama 34; and Trump 121. U.S. leadership is greatest threat to global peace
@christiaanc5 @ProudResister meanwhil roughly 80 countries hav slammd US centrl command habit of bombn hospitls &amp;schools (war crimes). Our leadrs r not intrestd n peace. Theyre 4in policy intrests is 2 ovrthrow leadrship of 3rd wrld nations &amp; nstall puppets who'll giv fossil fuel companies vry favorabl deals

@duane2762 welif 'd let the international courts prosecute American leaders that authorized war crimes she'd be one of many locked away for years
@kdaudt @mnhousegop your proposed budget bill would have increased the rate in which young adults with disabilities become institutionalized and/or die.   It's a practice that hasn't been seen since Hitler controlled Nazi Germany
@jessesgirl95 @imaminasotan @kdaudt @mnhousegop lol, Obama gave you a right-wing healthcare law. The same thing Romney would have given you
@RepKevinBrady More than 900,000 jobs have been outsourced since Trump became president. Doesn't seem like much has changed in that regard

@JakeRage5 @duane2762 @VladDarklord @ProudResister we have been arming, financing, and training terrorist networks for years. if our leaders truly wanted to make serious headway in depleting terrorist networks they would stop doing arms deals w/Saudi Arabia (Obama $54 bil. &amp; Trump $110 bil.)

@RosangelaTho @GrizzleMeister he was willing 2 sign off on a healthcar law that wld hav taken away mor of our retiremnt $$ &amp; retiremnt healthcar covrage. its painful 2 c how weak his leadrship skills r n that he melts 2 any1 particularly the last person n the room willing 2 stroke POTUS' ego
@RosangelaTho @GrizzleMeister lastly the thing that disappoints me most is he has become compromised/corrupted by accepting big money special interest $$s such as $4.7 mil. from private health insurers &amp; bigpharma, $1 mil from predatory payday lender $21 mil from NRA &amp; list goes on.

@GrizzleMeister Americans in general are lacking in objective critical reading &amp; thinking skills. It's by design &amp; how the GOP establishment &amp; Democratic establishment uses its respective propaganda messages to manipulate its bases into believing whatever "truths" they want.
@sheri69661 @GrizzleMeister but how do you haven't in the past?
@GrizzleMeister @POTUS @realDonaldTrump could probably use some of his money though.
@mike_Zollo @CoreyLMJones Dont forget Exxon Mobil, Wall Street, The Koch Bros., Corp news media outlets, Military Industrial Complex profiteers/War Machine, Comcast, Private Health Insurers, &amp; Big Pharma among others are also all taking advantage of this country!!! 2day U.S.A. = Oligarchy!
@DarrenCarnett @CoreyLMJones @luzabrg Every1 of the corporate news media outlets are propaganda machines who are hiding the truth, which is WWIII has been quietly brewing 4 @ least a few years now &amp; its all about a proposed Qatari-Turkish natural gas pipeline. 1 will not find real news on TV.
@CoreyLMJones Don't watch any of the so-called corporate news media as their sole purpose is to make money off you by projecting half-truths &amp; misinformation. The likes of Sean Hannity &amp; Rachel Maddow are nothing more than corporate propaganda tools.
@KatTheHammer1 @ericbolling What's sad &amp; unfortunate is that since being elected president he has flippd 180 &amp; turnd n2 the typicl corruptd neocon/neolib politician by accepting big money specl ntrest donations... $4.7 mil. frm privat hlth insuranc &amp; bigpharma; $1 mil. frm predatory payday lendr etc

@GrizzleMeister @IvanTrumpovic1 @hrenee80 @ROCKONOHIO @GartrellLinda @Jali_Cat @gr8tjude @Truthseeker126 @pinkk9lover @ReneeCarrollAZ @starcrosswolf Then we also have Obama ($54 bil.) &amp; Pres. Trump ($110 bil.) makn arms deals w/Saudi Arabia, a nation that advocates 4 the spread of xtremist Mohamedism; arms, finances &amp; trains various factions of xtremist networks; &amp; currently carryn out a genocide in Yemen w/U.S. Air support

@FiveRights every single country's government establishment class lies to its adversaries, allies, and citizens. it's pretty much a moot point.
@torreymspears @FiveRights it would be more accurate to say that we gave them back their money that we have been withholding and paying interest on for years. It's like getting rid of interest accruing credit card debt and being given imprisoned Americans as part of our reward benefits

@HouseGOP quoting the man who was the beginning of the American worker being thrown overboard? Talk about out of touch with reality!
@cathymcmorris You could start with donating that bonus the Koch Bros. gave you to a cause that directly benefits individuals with disabilities
@lawlor_mason @JoshuaDHunter @cspenc10 insurance companies were prohibited from being for-profit up until 1973
@BallinJester @AllisonFox4News yeah, I guess being paralyzed from the shoulders down for the past 19 yrs. isn't enough for me to learn about hard life.... smh @ #ignoranttool
@repgregwalden if we had the same share of income growth today as seen in the early 70s, the median American making $50,000/yr. would be seeing an additional $42k--$45k in income. Neocons &amp; Neolibs offer "the people" nothing but the leftover crumbs
@JohnCornyn @DailyCaller Try answering this question. How many innocent Middle Eastrn Muslim citizens does u.s. Central Command need 2 bomb &amp; kill b4 they stop wanting to take the fight back at us? Afghanistan &amp; Iraq wars have been going on so long they're about 2 qualify 4 lifetime achievement awards
@RepAdamSchiff you're no better than Trump cuz you voted for continuing the unconstitutional government spying on American people without a warrant
@JessMonticello @PressSec the individual mandate originated from the conservative Heritage Foundation as well
@cathymcmorris @RepSeanDuffy Did the Koch bros. pay you to tweet that?
@CNBCnow This may be good if it proves 2b true, although ur a source thats beholden 2 the interests of Wall Street. The same street that caused the gr8 depression &amp; gr8 recession.
@cathymcmorris @GreggHarper in time the GOP will be calling for cuts 2 social security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid by citing deficit concerns. it's like u think US citizens are a special kind of stupid
@cathymcmorris @GreggHarper I have paralysis from the shoulders down and nothing in that letter will improve my ability to put my grad degree to full practice
supposedly small businesses who decide take on the risk of hiring a person with a disability will lose tax credit for decreased productivity of said employee https://t.co/DkwEzj5cHA
@michaelcburgess As a Dr. I'd hope ur aware that evaluating affects of the tax bill is a tall task considering it's impossible 2 know how much health insurance costs will increase upon the individual mandate repeal
@cathymcmorris Every level? Those at the top don't need anymore help. Just stop lying to people and admit you sold your soul to the Koch Bros.
@cathymcmorris making cuts to medicare, Medicaid, and social security disability benefits will make it even more difficult. Stop lying to people and stop catering to the Koch Bros. agenda!
@cathymcmorris you could only find 137 out of the 1000s of economists out there? You also failed to mention that it'll bloat our debt
@cathymcmorris $1,182 will go to increased health insurance premiums, &amp;also out of pocket medical costs &amp; student loan payments no longer tax deductible. Still not winning!
@KariDziedzic do you have any fundraising tips and or resources?

@JJJungleJim @RepGeneGreen @NancyPelosi I'm aware he lied about that &amp; by no means is he my god nor do I consider myself a liberal
@JJJungleJim @RepGeneGreen @NancyPelosi that's because our gov't doesn’t descriminate homosexual male partners who adopt newborn
@Liberty8691 @nikiinthehouse well isn't the freedom  2 hav sum better than not havn 1 choice? 4 many yrs I wsn't allowed 2 hav such coverage
@JJJungleJim @RepGeneGreen @NancyPelosi do you realize that the premiums and deductibles are set by the insurance industry not the govt?
@discoandhaze @nikiinthehouse @HouseDemocrats dn't forget the immoral greedy practices of health insuranc indstry choosing to raise premiums
@Canderson012 @nikiinthehouse @NancyPelosi  went up because Insurance company raised ur premiums, not the govy
@Liberty8691 @nikiinthehouse you have a choice whether to buy it or not, unlike social security where ur forced pay into by being employed

@rkellum1 I can accept your position. Im just not going to support a candidate who refers to our armd service membrs as just a pair of boots
@rkellum1 where in the world did you get that from? Nowhere did I advocate for the government to develop our drugs.
@rkellum1 since you presume I'm a Socialist I suppose you might feel that I'm deeply confused as I'm a Kasich supporter
@rkellum1 might want to remind the pharmaceutical industry that free market is supposed to drive down costs.
@RepGeneGreen we're forced to pay into social security without any out options, and where are those complaints?
@rkellum1 @RepDavidEPrice @RepGeneGreen deductibles are up cuz private health insurance Corp greed as well as pharmaceutical greed
@JJJungleJim @RepGeneGreen @NancyPelosi I'm interested to know how it's the government's fault that you don't have health insurance?

@estate_fifth @juliezeilinger @Reuters u can call it wordy nonsense, while I call it formulating a sophisticated thought
@RealGreekViking @juliezeilinger @Reuters it wasn't a point of view for sake of argument. It was a question.
@estate_fifth @juliezeilinger @Reuters resorting to a one-word expletive response doesn't reflect well on one's intellectual capacity
@PennyDreadful81 @juliezeilinger Dspte popular belief, mjrty of low incm sngl moms do hv jobs on top of bein a mom 1 1/2 fll-time job itslf
@RealGreekViking @juliezeilinger @Reuters but what if a woman s intent 4 an abortion is to save her own life? Where does prolife side then?
@RealGreekViking @juliezeilinger @Reuters how do you know every aborted "baby" regrets it? Sum babies grow up regretting they were evr born
@RealGreekViking @SuperSp00ky @juliezeilinger if we're 2 cnsdr evry fetus a bby thn evry wmn who hs a miscarrg shld b considered a murderer
@RealGreekViking @SuperSp00ky @juliezeilinger it's not about Semantics, It's about science.

@Spaghetti_Spill @juliezeilinger @Reuters Perhaps 1 should blame God 4 giving humans the intellectual capacity 2 create safe abortions
@Spaghetti_Spill @juliezeilinger @Reuters it all depends on when one considers the beginning of human life.
@PennyDreadful81 @juliezeilinger if those low-incme womn hadn't had abortions, wld u b cryn abt havn 2 pay 4 their care in the frm of wlfar?
