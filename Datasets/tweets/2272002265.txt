@DamagedBttm i mean, i'm not an expert. I just repeat what my derm says because she basically saved my skin. sometimes, with uneven skin, it's hard to even it all out though without extractions. the retinol will help loosen everything so it all comes out w/ ease. 		  https://t.co/68CIZXuLn4
@DamagedBttm be wary of the oil. see if you can retin a or the generic brand (works just as well). and def start a vitamin c serum in the morning. it's expensive, but a small bottle lasts for like 6 months. (don't get it on amazon; they often water down the formula)  https://t.co/Jp3XeFlTZ7
@DamagedBttm Start with a retinoid cream asap. Retin A is fantastic. You need a prescription for this. After you've been doing that for a month, visit your Derm again, and they can do extractions if necessary. Also, start a vitamin c serum daily. skinceuticals makes a great one.

@ShaunDEllis1981 There have been more than 3 accusers at this point...
@kilomikealpha76 @ChrisRBarron Dr. Ford did not make that accusation. But yes, the stakes are very high. It‚Äôs an important job with a *lifetime* appointment. So the stakes are always high. And the decisions he would be faced with on the Court are high stakes. It‚Äôs clear he cannot handle high stakes.

#BlaseyFord #KavanaughConfirmation #KavanaghHearing #Kavanaugh #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
He is qualified w/ respect to his education/job experience. But doesn't his performance today, at the VERY least (even if you don't believe Dr. Ford), cast doubt on his character? On his ability to perform under pressure? On his ability to respect others as they do their jobs?
He is here to convince a committee of elected officials that he is credible and that he is capable of being a Supreme Court Justice. After watching his temper flare multiple times, how could anyone argue that he is capable? I am not arguing that he is unqualified. /4
Also, the Republicans kept saying how we need to treat each of those testifying today equally. While I agree they should be treated equally, shouldn't Kavanaugh be held to a MUCH higher standard? Dr. Ford is not seeking a job. He is. She is here to tell her story. /3
She wanted it to be confidential. But it wasn't. Yet she rose to the occasion and told her story. Kavanaugh came in yelling and crying. He was rude to the people whose JOBS are to assess his credibility. /2
Another thing (clearly I've been rewatching segments of the #KavanaghHearing), Kavanaugh kept citing how Blasey Ford wanted it to be confidential and how the Dems didn't honor that. Yet here she was today, never yelling, never crying, never being rude to her questioners. /1
Many don't. In fact, even before she testified, they said they didn't. https://t.co/2OETZU6D5d
Also, what's the point of putting all the letters into the record? Will senators even read the ones that aren't consistent with their intended votes?
I get he apologized. But again, how you act under pressure, demonstrates your character. #KavanaughHearings
The @SenAmyKlobuchar interaction is so telling of how Kavanaugh thinks about women. The condescending tone he uses to question her is repugnant. But more importantly, it's not how one conducts one's self in a job interview.

If Ford had cried, I'm sure there'd be people on the Right calling her overly-emotional. But here's Kavanaugh crying because he may not get the job he doesn't deserve.
Kavanaugh: "What goes around comes around"		Also Kavanaugh: "it is our job to make [the witness‚Äôs] pattern of revolting behavior clear‚Äîpiece by painful piece."		So at least he's right about something.
He seemed angriest about "fights on boats in Rhode Island."

"Do you mind if I say something to you directly?" She had to ask the man who is supposed to be judging her credibility if she could ask to speak to him directly. THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS!
We should pray for a day when we don't have to keep citing statistics about what sexual assault survivors undergo post assault. We should pray for a day when we believe survivors and fight alongside them to dismantle the patriarchal structures that support the assailants.
Politicians love the sound of their own voices. Each has 5 minutes and most have spent more time speaking than listening.
"The uproarious laughter" "The multiple attempts to escape" "The final ability to do so"
It's been said. But it bears repeating over and over until it comes to fruition: SUBPOENA MARK JUDGE!
What's the science behind polygraph tests? Genuinely curious. Are they considered very reliable in a court of law? I know this isn't a court of law. But worth asking.
Despite having to relive this trauma in front of the nation, Dr. Ford is still pulling out the scientific receipts to explain to everyone how memory and trauma work. It's incredibly powerful and a testament to her character and brilliance.
Grassley getting super defensive is not a good look.
The prosecutors' decision to participate in this manner demonstrates her lack of sound judgment.
Dr. Ford's testimony is more powerful than any political grandstanding by both parties. Let her speak!

@PaulaHyland @mattwilstein @jimmyfallon @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm scapegoating him for the choice he made. He had the chance, and he blew it. History is littered with missed opportunities to stand up to bullies. This was a massively missed opportunity, and Fallon deserves the blame for that.

@PaulaHyland @mattwilstein @jimmyfallon @realDonaldTrump Never did I say Jimmy Fallon was the sole cause for Trump winning. Nor did he really have a major effect, if any. The point I am making is that Fallon humanized Trump on his nightly talk show. He didn't have to do that. He chose to do that. And it was the wrong, cowardly choice.
@PaulaHyland @mattwilstein @jimmyfallon @realDonaldTrump There are many factors that led to his winning the Electoral College. To deny Fallon had any part in humanizing Trump is quite careless. Of course Fallon did, and he did it willingly because Trump's policies do not really threaten a straight, white dude.
@mattwilstein @jimmyfallon @realDonaldTrump A little late, don't you think? The damage is long done.
And when she comes for you, Mr. @realDonaldTrump, she'll be more hilarious, more clever, and more poignant than you could ever be. https://t.co/OEvMjaH6cU
Think what you will of the photo (Personally, I think that photo was entirely appropriate). Think what you will of the ensuing scandal. But don't you EVER think you can come for @kathygriffin and get away with it. Because, as every celebrity knows, she'll come back for you.
...@realDonaldTrump and the entire Trump klan (@IvankaTrump, @FLOTUS, @DonaldJTrumpJr, &amp; @EricTrump) had to throw at her. Here was a woman standing with nothing but a mic, a red solo cup of water, and her notes. Here was a woman delivering incredible comedy to legions of fans.
...here I, a 57-year-old chick comic, am today making it hilarious. I immediately jumped up. So did the entire crowd at Radio City. We were all screaming for her, cheering her on. She had to stop and just take it in. Here was a woman who had been through everything...
Basically, he told her that on that day, she was the most famous comedian in the world. Somehow, her task was to make this day and whatever happened after funny. She then made some clever jokes and ended the bit with a statement that was basically like...
Thread: There was a moment during @kathygriffin's Radio City show tonight that really stuck with me. The whole show was fabulous: her wit is as quick and sharp as ever. But, during one bit, she shared what @JimCarrey told her on the day she took the now infamous pic.

Basically, I just paid 95 bucks for a combined full sugaring AND therapy session
But honestly, as the pubes were ripped away, so were anxieties
Sorry not waxing. Sugaring. Much more natural

@RheaButcher No. because there was nothing shocking about it. It wasn't a statement. It was barely a performance tbh

I'd like to offer @realDonaldTrump to the basilisk #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets
As smart as the professors were, they seem to be incompetent when it comes to the Chamber of Secrets #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets
Is it a basilisk? Or is it @taylorswift13?  #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets #KimExposedTaylorParty
These spiders are the reason I support teaching apparition to second-years #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets
I love you Fang, but you're literally useless #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets

Bitch! Hagrid's a professor. Stop talking about him like a fellow student #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets
I'd never marry a Hufflepuff. Or a Gryffindor. #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets
That cable knit sweater Harry's wearing is utter üóë #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets
Hagrid was such a bear. I'd do him. üêª #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets
I'd bottom for young Voldemort #HarryPotterweekend #ChamberOfSecrets
Tom Riddle isn't into talking, only showing. He definitely sent one or two unsolicited dick pics via owl in his day. #HarryPotterweekend

@louisvirtel @calvinstowell I'm pretty sure I saw a lil bit of lube left over. Bad casting. But good day for thirst.
You know all those cute flash mob proposals? Those couples probably ended up divorced. https://t.co/DNZ1IL1yHD

Who else thinks @realDonaldTrump will be PISSED at Harvey Fierstein's impression of him on #HairsprayLive ?
I hate Mike Pence, but this guy who plays Link needs the camps. Or just cast someone who doesn't smell like lube #HairsprayLive
Give @HarveyFierstein the #Emmy for putting up with this trash! #HairsprayLive
Gay men are jacking off to this multi-racial porno flick. Seaweed in Link. You know it's true. #HairsprayLive
Hot take 4: @SeanHayes is in on the group fuck during commercial breaks. #HairsprayLive #WelcomeToThe69s
Another hot take: @HarveyFierstein penetrating both @DarrenCriss and @garrettclayton1 during commercial breaks. PICTURE IT! #HairsprayLive
Hot take: @DarrenCriss is fucking @garrettclayton1 behind the scenes #HairsprayLive
It's not that he's gay. He's a fuckin' bottom. #HairsprayLive

Friend just said to me: I left my earring at this random guy's place. So now I have go sex with him again to get it back. (the sex sucked)
@TomiLahren sure. BS. Sure. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
The Donald Trump just dropped any pretense of knowing what he's doing. Just a Trump scam to raise fear! https://t.co/ipqFw1WS6K
@CBCNews @liamstack He can defend it all he wants. He still failed. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@spookiibitch21 engaging in respectful discussion does not mean refusing to attack flawed logic and point out stupidity. There's nothing
@SeamusM01 @Medium also @TomiLahren never yelled during the interview
@SeamusM01 @Medium that's not what the article is saying at all.
@SeamusM01 see the following for a legit argument https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW üòò
@SeamusM01 honey, this isn't a policy debate.

@djeterg19 @tumblr no such destruction occurred https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@SeamusM01 @1059KISS @wordpressdotcom @Medium did he though? What was it? That we should respect such illogical thought patterns?
@whvsper @Kingwole he could've specifically pointed out the many flaws in her logic. Instead he lightly poked fun. We should expect more
@JenniferGBiehn @TomiLahren @Trevornoah oh honey please. He didn't disrespect her beliefs at all. That's the problem https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@kc_jr cause let's be honest, nobody's crushing on his mind https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Rehan__Babar a real sad excuse of a @TheDailyShow host https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@spookiibitch21 Why? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@Mr_Blodgett2 @Trevornoah he was erased from mine https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@raven_nicoleee it's not worth it https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Z1079 @wordpressdotcom yes he did. A ton. And that's why he's failing https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CENARULES4EVER @Trevornoah @TomiLahren @TheDailyShow @YouTube someone call casting! Noah failed again https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@HarmonicaHound @williamcson agreed https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@efairhurst @BostonGlobe and the resulting interview is rather sad https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@OneNewsPage_US no such grilling occurred https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Salon if that was "all in," he's got a lot of work to do https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@AarSee @TomiLahren @Trevornoah she didn't. But that doesn't excuse Noah's weak interview https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@LiaMadeline @Trevornoah you can do better https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@KaylaRiley24 @ajplus @TomiLahren @Trevornoah @Medium https://t.co/CiKcohS0Ur
@naarmis except he didn't shut her down. I agree with out he used her own words. But he had the chance to show up wth facts/objective logic
@AnnaJoan94 @Trevornoah @TheAffinityMag I'll take that bet https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@MsLeaLlovet @Trevornoah you can do better https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@naarmis he barely called her out https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@gretagarbled @TheAtlantic and sadly, it's a weak, unfunny voice https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Globetoppers but why not take her to task? Liberals need to take their voices back. Plus he's a comedian and his best joke was a stoplight
@BuzzFeedNews he didn't face off. He basically did little more than listen and lightly poke holes in her thinking https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@mglagola14 @Trevornoah @BuzzFeedNews does he really deserve that much respect? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@SamWould_ @YouTube the nail was right in front of him, and he missed https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@KaylaRiley24 @ajplus @TomiLahren @Trevornoah really? Your fav? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@ThylacineReport he could've really challenged her instead of making lackluster jokes
@laur_kls @zacheese1 how much? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@MJStarLover I wish he had roasted her. He barely lit a match https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CKarinC @Trevornoah @TomiLahren @blackvoices yes to not supporting Tomi. But no high-gives to Noah https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@ThylacineReport did he even do that though? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@suzanne_barillo he feels barely woke at best https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@asteingruebl @djsziff playing it fast and loose with the word "humorous" https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@JoadReflex @CloydRivers did he though? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@vintageleel_7 @TheDailyShow @TomiLahren @ComedyCentral agreed https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@TomiLahren @TheDailyShow if you really weren't a snowflake, you wouldn't even write about not being a snowflake https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@jackie_tayl0r @TomiLahren @TheDailyShow "baller" feels like a stretch https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@MeganSpeck https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@_DLini @Medium https://t.co/2U5KTG8xD0
@SC_Author yet he didn't steer through the BS last night. He didn't confront her "facts" with actual facts. Yes he was calm. But that's all
@_DLini @Medium https://t.co/ha1vjbEBBz
@azmoderate https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@UglyDrae smooth? Nah. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@mollyyfischl @TheDailyShow @TomiLahren and the worst https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@BabediNshax poised? Sure. Effective? Nope. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@DillonCullinan yet she's still orbiting https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@_DLini cooked? Really? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@jfjabbo @blackvoices https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@MigiEdelman not so much https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@TheReporter00 @dailyreadlist and unfortunately, it's a feeble voice https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@ItWasJustDanter what number is that exactly? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@SC_Author did he? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@emilyhommel @ComedyCentral he must be climbing a miniature staircase   https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@shamirajamess @OMGkee https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@skyeobie except he didn't
@joeyesposito @YouTube the defining moment was one of failure, not success https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@GRAHAMWIERS on that point, we agree https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@F_VargasMMA @UPROXX https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

A bit? Oh honey, the article, and I, are pure trash https://t.co/EY1ANsZeA3
@ctheadcase fellow Connor, I am way more than a bit trash üóë
@CaseyGoldstein no he's not. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't speak up. She asked what the KKK did. Sometimes, you gotta teach
@MobSquadDF https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@LucasGugenheim but was she destroyed? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CaseyGoldstein I agree he created a conversation. Except, I'd say he made very few points when he had a chance to.
@CaseyGoldstein did he speak up though? He barely poked holes. Use intellect for speaking true facts. Where's the DA when we need it?!
@yrwrong https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@JoeRGannascoli @NYDailyNews no grilling occurred https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@trendinaliaUS https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CaseyGoldstein I agree. Let her speak of course. But speak up Trevor. Be the Quibbler.

@brofromanothaho Jessica Williams. Whoopi Goldberg. Plus there are tons of unknowns.
@brofromanothaho let's get a liberal voice whose fiery and passionate and funny. Is that too much to ask of @TheDailyShow?
@jaynayv https://t.co/0oJ6Ccgkh5
@sharooonwiller Funny? No. That's not really in Trevor's wheelhouse. but like trevor says, we can at least respect our disagreement
@sharooonwiller I agree with everything except he "served her well" https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
