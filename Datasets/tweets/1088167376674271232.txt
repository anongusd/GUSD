@TeamstersJC16 @Teamsters All too common a practice. The large box retailers exploit their workers, offer incredibly low wages and non-existent benefits while raking in record profits. That's why as a candidate for Congress, I have made repealing Right to Work laws a priority!
Collective bargaining rights through unions is the BEST defense against an aggressive corporate culture that would exploit labor for financial greed, by offering its workers low wages and meager benefits, all for record profits. Right to work laws DO NOT favor the worker @AFLCIO

@ananavarro @ananavarro, would really like to know where he plans to build the "Steel Slat" things he back-tracked on. Most of the southern border already has some kind of barrier, except Texas, due to the International Boundary Commission clause that restricts building in a floodplain.
@realDonaldTrump Iran is more emboldened then ever, the disastrous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq took away any counter balance to Iran. They have the backing of Russia and Turkey, and expand their influence into Syria and Lebenon... how are we in a better place?

@mahoneypaul1 @emmy2logan @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump What @realDonaldTrump is advocating is a removal of US Troops from #Syria to accommodate Russia, Turkey and Iran.

@KamalaHarris @travelstwo But it shouldn't be modeled after medicare, it should be more like medicare advantage for all. You should have access to private insurance that requires min-mandated services at a 0.00 premium out of pocket, but lets you choose your preferred carrier of choice.

@kathygriffin @chanceiscoming1 Unfortunately @kathygriffin, when we elect leaders who stand on a platform of hate, hate will manifest in the streets. The fact that this is occurring today is because we have never truly learned the lessons of our past, and are doomed to repeat the same atrocities over and over.

@JoyAnnReid @JoyAnnReid , what is truly frightening is that Racism and Homophobia are so far out in the open now, this can happen to a celebrity, in a major US city. Hatred has become a new norm since our elected leaders tend to believe it's ok to rile up racists for political gain.
@jennifer_fiore You want to see "Assimilated" Hispanic culture, just look at my home city of San Antonio! You don't have to speak English, or adopt Euro-American culture to be "Assimilated" into society. A sharing of culture, history and traditions is what makes our society unique and meaningful

@JoyAnnReid @JoyAnnReid, he's not conservative enough for the Republican base that supports Trump. He also knows that the Democratic Party has shifted, and knows he can't stand up against someone like @KamalaHarris or @JoeBiden. He's not an independent and people will see right through him.
@JoyAnnReid Well,  you know @JoyAnnReid, the Billionares have absolutely no concept of working an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. The mentality of the top, to acquire as much wealth as possible at the expense of the labor force, is mind boggling.

@steelworkers @POTUS, instead of spending 5.7B on a wall no one wants, why don't we build a High-Speed modern rail network using only American manufactured steel, and incorporates Appalachia into the rail grid ... that would do more for our nation than a useless wall.

@steelworkers Unions are needed today more than ever! Corporations with annual profits that rival small countries can not be left to decide the pay and benefits of their workers, they will always choose the lowest legal limits. Collective Bargaining is the only way to try to level the field.

@TomiLahren A child's physical gender does not necessarily equate to their gender identity. Forcing a child into a gender role, deemed by society because of their biological gender, teaches them that it's wrong to be their authentic self. That my dear is child abuse, plain and simple.

@Cat15132 @CarlynGreene @senatemajldr The entire Senate and House are the ones to blame. They could create a bipartisan compromise that would overturn any Veto by Trump, and get the government working again. Trump created the #shutdown, but they own it.

@CarlynGreene @senatemajldr Carlyn, thank you for what you do to keep us secure. You, the TSA agents at DCA, and all of the 800K Federal Workers deserve better than the political posturing going on in Washington. #EndTheShutdownNow
@BrendaOf6 @ncLobo @GotArtAttitude @mwrightbaylor @Jesus_was_a_Lib @POTUS already has funding for his border this FY, the 5.7B increase would not build a wall on the whole border, so the shutdown is just petty politics.
@ncLobo @GotArtAttitude @mwrightbaylor @Jesus_was_a_Lib @BrendaOf6 Bush Sr started it, Clinton expanded, Bush Jr doubled, Obama reinforced, Trump's has already been allocated 1.6B in the FY 2019 DHS budget to build 65 miles. The 5.7B does not create a full wall across the border. 5% increase to DHS taking it over 60B in discretionary spending.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends 800K Federal Workers and Contractors wouldn't agree with you at the moment.
@MitchLandrieu He created it, but he no longer owns it. This #shutdown is squarely on the shoulders of the dysfunction of the @HouseDemocrats and @SenateGOP. Their unwillingness to even discuss the issue shows how fragmented our Government has become.
@bfg1963 @RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Because both the Democrats and the Republicans care more about their party than the people. We have devolved to the other side being the enemy opposed to working with one another to find comprehensive solutions to real challenges that take both sides into account.
@bfg1963 @RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The House and the Senate have the authority to pass legislation, Congress holds the funding. Even under threat of Veto by @POTUS, a truly bi-partisan effort to find common ground could override his Veto. But hey, let's just keep it closed down because we don't think it's fair.
@bfg1963 @RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump FY 2019 already has an allocation of $1.6 billion for 65 miles of new border wall construction, I only said a compromise should be reached to offer funds towards existing border wall upgrades in exchange for a more permanent solution on DACA. I did not say give @POTUS the 5.7B
There once was a time that government led by inspiring the best in the American public, to unify as one, and put the welfare of this nation first. We reached for the impossible, today, we can't even reach across a table.
@BernieSanders He may have created it, but the @HouseDemocrats and the @SenateGOP own it! Dems need to concede some funding for border fencing upgrades, and the Reps need to offer more permanent solutions for DACA kids. #EndTheShutdown
@KamalaHarris A person in this country is allowed to be their most authentic self, their Gender or Gender Identity has Zero affect on their ability to do their job. Denying these true patriots, who lay their lives on the line daily for the defense of this nation, is petty and bigoted.
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats Let's be very clear ... @realDonaldTrump may have caused this needless shutdown, but the House and Senate own it. The inflexibility of both sides is what keeps it shut down. Learn to compromise! #EndTheShutdown
@RepAnnieKuster @HouseDemocrats If you are truly committed to reopening the government, there would be a proposal that includes some funding to upgrade existing border fencing alongside funding for new technologies like drones to protect the border. #EndTheShutdown
@GOPLeader @HouseGOP The State of the Union is ... Broken. Why don't we focus more on finding true compromise that benefits both sides rather than play political games. Right now, I don't think 800k Federal Employees much care if Trump is allowed to make a speech, they are concerned with paying rent!
@JudgeJeanine This can be said of both sides. Federal workers continue to be harmed by the lack of comprise and honest debate. The Democrats and Republicans only care about catering to their base and do not have the interests of the American people at heart.
