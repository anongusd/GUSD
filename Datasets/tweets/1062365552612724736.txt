@AOC @IlhanMN Maybe it’s not about racism but it’s about trust. Maybe it’s about we will never trust ANY Muslim in our government because of their beliefs. Maybe it’s about we have every god given right to disown any Muslim and demand they be removed from our government/country because of

@RobertMaguire_ @realDonaldTrump Butter my buttons call me a Bisquit if Democrats can get through the day without bashing our President and actually do something good for Americans.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump What a laughing ball face lie, where was Nancy this weekend?  How many days a wee do you actually work?  Democrats can’t open their mouth without lies rolling out, Democrats can’t tweet nothing but lies. Do you really think US citizens are that stupid or are you that stupid?
@realDonaldTrump Mr President you are too Good to the Democratics considering they are destroying our country, trying to impeach you, trying to get your tax returns, showing no respect for you or your family or your party or your voters. Democrats are putting illegals children above unborn child

@GOPChairwoman All the Democrats care about doing is hating on our President and wasting hard working taxpayers money and try to blame ever little bitty tinny thing they can rake from the rocks they have for brains to blame our President for. Bless their hearts!!
@realDonaldTrump I’m sure you’re aware there’s a Caravan of 30,000 illegals coming to our border in El Paso in January around the 6th and the Democrats are supporting this Invasion just like they did the Caravan that came to our border in Tijuana Mexico. We even had 2 congresswomen go to Tijuana
@SenatorCardin @WhiteHouse Oh how many do you think got across our boarders undetected. Give us a number on that too. We’re waiting since all you seem to want to do is waste taxpayers money. https://t.co/42h2h1NAdI

@OrvilleLloyd @KamalaHarris Probably because she more worried about illegals!  I sorry but they have no rights here.
@blueblue321 @VP @HouseGOP @POTUS I keep up everyday. Try watching some live videos of the caravan from free lance reporters. You might actually learn how violent some of them are, you also might learn how much they lie and are willing to go to get across our borders. Dangerous for them and us.
@RepJoeKennedy How many actual citizens have died at the hand of illegals. Bet you don’t even know?
@RepByrne @VP @SecNielsen Yes it is!!  A innocent life is always worth saving. Illegals are taking our our country, destroying our kids with these terrific drugs and murdering our families. We don’t have no ideal how many have entered our own county.
@SenatorDurbin @SenateDems You’re wasting tax dollars from hard working Americans and refusing to protect their family at the same time. I hope this is last time Democrats take over anything. Build a wall!!
@ErinTHX1138 @SenTedCruz @MichaelBerrySho That’s nothing compared to Nancy trying to sneak it bills they never even voted on. She’s a snake in the grass destroying our country.
@blueblue321 @VP @HouseGOP @POTUS That’s not what she said. She said they were coming by land, water and sea. If we could stop this one of them it might be that plans that terror attack.
@shawkii56 @SenTedCruz @MichaelBerrySho I stated working around age 15. There is people left who work for what they have and want.
@SenTedCruz @MichaelBerrySho Would that be wonderful!!  ❤️
@GOPLeader @VP @MickMulvaneyOMB @SecNielsen I love when people stand up what’s right instead of chasing after evil. Thank you!!  We want a wall.
@maziehirono You are such a fool. I hope all the lives lost by illegals in this country falls on your hands because there plenty of it going around, drugs, murders, od’s.
@VP @HouseGOP @POTUS All you trolls fuss when real patriots come on the Democratic tweets and post but here you all are. Talking about giving someone a head ace. Get a job!!
@blueblue321 @VP @HouseGOP @POTUS It’s not false information. Surely you know better than that.
@VP @HouseGOP @POTUS Stand Strong!!  Build the wall!!  Secure our families. The illegals are breaking Americans. I tried to share a video they made were they said they were taking over. I believe they pretty much have. It’s ridiculously!!
@TheDemocrats No it’s time to build the boarder!!
@ChrisCoons Why don’t you do something to protect the American people.? Like build the wall.
@1bfitz @SenTedCruz I said yesterday they should put the names of ever person that dies at the hands of illegals or drugs that comes our border as a reminder to all Americans lives lost, put it in the wall they build.
@SenTedCruz Sounds like a good plan. It’s about time they gave back to our country!!
@RepLoisFrankel @POTUS Do you not understand he did not creat it. For ever citizen who life is took at the hands of illegals blood will be on your hands!!  Build the wall and secure our border!!!
@SenatorMenendez It’s ver fair only one way to look at it. Either you’re legal or you’re illegals. No in between!!
@ABC Just blowing smoke up some idiot butt!!😂😂😂
@ABC It also says in this report ( supposedly) NOT he was
@GOPChairwoman * county not country
@GOPChairwoman And the Democrats say we don’t need a wall. A wall is useless. Shame on them because ever life lost because of them refusing a wall is blood on their hand. In my country in Alabama we are being flooded with illegals, drug cartels, drug addictions, overdosed and murder.

@AlisonHirsh I disagree with you. In my hometown are Haiti and illegals everywhere. If your going to support them you need to bring them to your home and quit using America tax dollars to keep these people up. If they’ve been here 9 years home many have applied for citizens ship?

Their lost loved ones and I also ask that you put their names into their into this wall somewhere along the southern boarder as a reminder to all Americans how important these victims are to their families and the Americans people.!!  I will pray for you to do this!!🙏🏻  I invite
We the people of the US must stand and be their voice!!  I cry out to our government to put aside your harmful ego’s and open your heart to these families and their pain, a pain they will never be able to let go of but maybe with your help they can find some kind of closure for
Who refuse to fund the wall. No amount of money can ever bring these victims back or comfort their friends and family!  No one life should be lost and if one life is saved it will surely be worth it. Please stand to protect our families. These victims no longer have a voice!!
Would someone please explain to the Democrats that our nation is being attached by these illegals aliens coming into our country. Do they not understand this is a true emergency and we have to have gunning for a wall. These victims blood fall on the hand of those in Government

@FerrellpoppaT @m2254 @RepCohen Yes because Jesus teaches us to obey the laws of our land. He doesn’t say to obey the laws of all nations but the laws of our land. Other nations’ religions goes against our living bible.
@DennisBonner19 @RepCohen I know. So many try to use Jesus and hide behind their church to cover their sins but God is watching.
@DJBurn77 @RepCohen If she used God’s name with what she said then yes she brought forth a sin that is not forgiven because God says there is one sin that he will not give and that is blaspheming against God! In other more simple words we are not suppose to take his name in vain.
@DJBurn77 @RepCohen It is not a sin to cuss but it is a sin to bring false statements toward someone. In our White House and in our living bible we have traditions that people just expect you to go by. If you break a tradition you bring shame upon yourself and your elders.
@RepCohen Great distribution!!!!
@RepCohen He also wrote in the book of life signs for us to go by to know when the time draws near of Jesus’s return. Of course our purpose has always been to have world peace but does he not also teach us that when this happens then he will pour his wrath upon the people and then will
@RepCohen Of their sins on your hands. Sins of people dying ever day because of the drugs they bring in and because of the people they murder.
@RepCohen Be judged. Yes Jesus did partake with sinners but he also wrote in the book of life commandments for us to live by. He partook with sinners to preach to gospel to them but he did not delight in their sins. If you let these evil murders into our country you have the blood of
@RepCohen Your home and give them shelter?  Why do you build walls around your home and refuse your neighbor. God also say to not partake in evil. Well when you’re allowing drugs and gang members into our cities are you not parting in evil. God also tells you that if you judge so shall you
@RepCohen Follow him?  Does God not also say that money is the root of all evil. When he tell you to love your neighbor how can you as a Christian let homeless citizens live in the streets of our own nation because as a christen you have refused to feed and cloth them and bring them into
@RepCohen In the Old Testament god ordered for walls to be built. In heaven does God not state there will be a gate in heaven that all must pass through and doesn’t he always say that great is the number but few will enter. Does God not also say that to cast away all earthly things and

I’m tired of them and young and old people in my community dying by these drugs and these terrorist. Democrats have a lot of blood on there hands by this
@barrynyagtman @ABCWorldNews @PersistShe Haha!!  That won’t ever ever happened. The President is their highest Commanders and Chief!!  At the blink of an eye they will obey his order!!  So proud to have so many great men and women in our military!!  Everyday we should thank a member of our military!!  I do!  Do you?
@LuValentino @ABCWorldNews Everyone American citizens that dies from this heroine, meth or and of the drugs they bring across or any of these terrorists that cross will be on your hands. My family is worth more than any amount of money for this wall!!
@dmhll9 @ABCWorldNews I hope your family members never die at the hands of these terrorist and I pray no more blood of America citizens are left on your hands. My family members are worth more than any amount of money for this wall.

@SenatorDurbin @FaceTheNation Hell no he shouldn’t and he won’t are you Democrats deaf to your evil ways. Ever time someone dies at the hands of illegals their blood is on yall’s hands. My family’s security is worth more than any amount of money to build a wall. I’m tired of relatives and young and old dying.
@CNN @FareedZakaria Hell I think a security crisis has already hit our nation with all these national Cavaren invading our nation!!!  I absolutely see what’s he’s doing about it too!!  He’s standing up for patriots and actually trying to protect our family’s from these haters of America!!

@CNN He stated in his last press conference that he will build the wall. I believe his giving the Democrats time to make a deal, he even said he would give them daca for the wall. I’m for one am against daca and never ever want to allow it but in smart dealing it’s a give and take.
@fred_guttenberg @realDonaldTrump That would never work because too many patriots would rise up againt it. Patriots have fought for years to preserve this amendment!!  There would be war within our nation. As long as there is good vs evil people will always die at the hands of veil. Look at 911.

@LeaderHoyer @senatemajldr @POTUS Did it have money for a wall because my families life is worth more than all of you in the capital. Oh let me see, that not your money is it, it’s the taxpayers money!!  You need to put in a Bill for term limits too. Build the Wall!!
@RepSusanWild @POTUS Well I know what it’s like. When the money market fell millions of Americans lost jobs, Homes, 401ks(paying bills), Health Insurance and etc...  How many vets have you helped or homeless kids in our country because of drugs, how many homeless have you help here in the US?
@RepBarbaraLee You need to put your money where your mouth is and build the Wall and end this shutdown. Oh I forgot, it’s our money, the taxpayers’ money!!!
@seanhannity Another thing, every time something happens ever socialist comes out of the cracks to blame Trump for it!!  Good lord this woman has tennis shoes on in the capital!  I don’t think no one but herself made her talk like that. It’s unacceptable!!
@seanhannity I though a mentor or elder was suppose to take the freshmen under their wings. Most of them are noting but activists disgracing our capital and our country. Somebody needs to boot them back to the state they came from.
@TomC_MSN @Plaqster @seanhannity Is she our standing President?  Hell No she ain’t!!  She’s nothing an embarrassment to any lady in America. Standing on the floor in the capital with damn tennis shoes on!!!
@SenSanders My God!!  You are such a disgrace to our county.!!  Have you ever done anything for our homeless veterans?  Have you done anything for the homeless people in our on nation. No!!!!
@GOP @VP Stand your ground sir!!  We Patriots appropriate you!!
@SenatorDurbin Well maybe you need to go to the boarder and see that they is a real need for a wall!!
@IngrahamAngle That sure would help the taxpayers out and at the same time it would lower our deficit!!  All Democrats at least most of them are nothing but self serving activists!!  We could surely have a little more order and respect in our capital!!
@seanhannity No wonder!!  Just look what her own daughter said about her chopping people’s head off!!  Sickens me!!  Our country is better this this and we deserve more respect!!  Their state might have voted them in but now they work for all American taxpayers!!!
@VP @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen @POTUS Build the Wall!!
@ABCWorldNews He really should do it because Democrats are doing nothing but jerking him around with the wall funding!!  I’m behind him 💯 %‼️🇺🇸

@HouseGOP I know I didn’t grow up to show such hate to anyone, I still don’t. You can teach morals and instal them into your children. I was always taught the the standing President was to be treated with honor and respect. Especially while he’s standing and you respect your elders!!!

Let me tell you, YOU CAN NOT put a price tag on the value of a life. Everyday we live in a
@davidcicilline @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @GOP @seanhannity @SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorWicker @SpeakerPelosi @GOPChairwoman seems to me that the patriots don’t matter. I remember when the money market fell and MILLIONS of taxpayers lost jobs,401ks, homes, medical insurance, and the list
@SenatorMenendez @senatemajldr Cars, health insurance, and the list goes on and on. Now our families are being threatened and even killed and overdosing, raped( because of you) and you want to leave us helpless again.  I DON’T THINK SO
@SenatorMenendez @senatemajldr Our families security is worth more money this the price tag of a wall. Build the wall!!  Americans wants it and the pain we felt when the money market fell doesn’t even compare to your statement. We lots homes, 401ks( trying to stay above bills because they do come every week)
@ChrisCoons Our families security is worth more money than not having a wall.  Build the wall!!

@hmeridian2 @RepJimBanks @HouseGOP You you try to try to kill yourself in can be put under watch by doctors and even commented to institutions. If you are incarcerated and you try to kill yourselves you are put under surveillance. We should always try to preserve life.
@RepJimBanks @HouseGOP female drs who take this oath. Women have chosen to abandon a innocent child that god recognizes even in the womb. A child should not be ripped apart and dismantle and human parts used for profits. We as God’s children should be writing laws to preserve and protect!
@RepJimBanks @HouseGOP home or she can abandon it, same as with still born babies, if she chooses to abandon then the oath the drs take to preserve life must call the funeral home to come pick up the child, they can not dismantle,throw in trash, or flush down the toilet this baby. Their is tons of
@RepJimBanks @HouseGOP Does God not say I knew you even when you were in the womb. I’m a woman and I support pro life. If a woman has a miscarriage at the hospital, the medical doctors take a oath to protect and preserve life, when these babies are delivered the womam can take the miscarriages baby
@RepJimBanks @HouseGOP Amen!!
@GOPChairwoman It’s not acceptable to the Americans to use such horrific language toward our President!!  The American way and tradition has always been to honor and respect our President!!  I was right in saying a dark shadow had been placed over our Capital!!

@SpeakerPelosi @RepColinAllred Rights and fighting to protect our families!!!  I see a great patriotic march coming to the capital and at the boarder!!  Build the wall!!  You work for us!!!
@SpeakerPelosi @RepColinAllred The Americans citizens won’t back down. We stand 💯% with our President and you like any Democrats can be replaced. You might think you are a ball of fire but you haven’t seen the patriots fight for their rights and they will not back down when it comes to fighting to protect our
@us_vincent @ChrisVanHollen @senatemajldr @SenSchumer You are nothing but a POS. You can easily be replaced. We America’s voted for our President and we want a wall and we will get it!! We will fight to the end. Patriots don’t back down when it comes to protecting our families!!!!!
@ChrisVanHollen Where was the pity party when the money market fell and millions of Americans lot their homes, their jobs, their healthcare, their 401k, their car and so much more. Now all we are asking for is you to protect our families and hell no all you do is slap the patriots in the face.
@SenJeffMerkley @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Well you Democrats can’t just walk all over our President and his citizens since y’all started this division the patriotic citizens will help our standing President finish it. You think you’re done something powerful today but we will do the check and balance because we pay you
@Xcathdra @RepLoisFrankel @HouseDemocrats Nancy would be the biggest one
@RepCarbajal @HouseDemocrats Bunch of BS!!
@AC360 @RepSwalwell Bunch a BS just like last 10ys. Just a way to try to distract what’s really going on. It’s time for people to march at our boarder and capital for the rights of the American citizens.

@realDonaldTrump Yes Democrats have blood on their hands!!  Blood of US citizens. Blood of our soldiers who fought and died fro this country so that people like me can have a free voice!!!
@realDonaldTrump Don’t let me leave out the parents of America children that are ripped from their arms because if drugs. Children placed in the hands of grandparents, great grandparents, family members or foster care. Our courts in Alabama are overloaded with cases. Build the damn wall!!!
@realDonaldTrump We’ve had children, US American children, in my hometown in Albertville Al raped by illegals. In Alabama we have illegal drug cartels selling drugs on our streets and citizen after citizen die of drug overdose and people taking their own life has skyrocketed!!
@realDonaldTrump Hillary and the rest of Democrats have blood on your hands. In my state of Alabama we have 65,000 undocumented illegals, drug cartels and list goes on and on. We’ve had a illegal grandmother and her granddaughter’s head copped off by drug cartel in Owen Cross roads in Alabama.

@Ocasio2018 The Bible says when a man and woman marry they become one. God gave us all a heart and mind and a free will to decide for ourself. He made each one of us an individual unique to the other and he tells us that love is the greatest. I choose to obey the law of our land.

@spartanAJD06 @realDonaldTrump Some get 15000 back in tax returns just by using fake SS#’s. Food stamps, WIC, medical insurance, help with utility, cash money and they all drive new cars with no insurance. You’ll never ever convince me to feel sorry for them.
@spartanAJD06 @realDonaldTrump To hell you say!  You should google it and educate yourself. I live with about 6000 illegals in my hometown and I see their BS everyday. Post your address and we can send some to live with you but I personally am tired of them robbing our welfare system, trashing my town etc.
@cspan @ChadPergram @NancyPelosi Shut down the government until the wall is funded but pay the military that is the solution to this BS!!
@realDonaldTrump If they don’t approve the wall Mr President you should shut down the government and still pay the military. Navy and the rest of her supports should stand behind their beliefs and post their address so we can send them to their house to support but not our welfare system.
@Michchick310 @realDonaldTrump He’ll we already have a bed and breakfast for illegals, it’s called our welfare system. Maybe you should post your address so we can send them to your home for you to support.
@spartanAJD06 @realDonaldTrump I for on are tired of the illegals invading my town living of our welfare system and showing no respect for our laws. If you’re ok with it then post your address and we can send them to your home for you to support.

@candidam91 @realDonaldTrump So you want the illegals to continue to get free stuff at the tax dollars expense. How many can live with you. What is your address. Google aid for immigrants
@misterjm78 @realDonaldTrump BS!!  The government has aide set up for immigration. If you don’t believe it google it. Every state is liable. They can get food stamps, medical, WIC, housing, even cash money. Educate yourself and welcome some in your home.

@kvndugan @realDonaldTrump This picture is fake news. The media make me sick. If you want to watch true news. Watch it from Mexico. It’s a shame when the US media reports useless garbage.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President I stand behind you 💯%. You just can’t please idiots.
@realDonaldTrump Please don’t let anymore in. There’s already about 5000 or more here in Albertville Al that are illegal and they have no respect for us. Most are drug dealers. Stop the illegals and you stop most of the drugs. People are dying from these drugs.
