It's time to ignore the Gate Keepers of the Democrat party.  Their Dog Whistling antics are just the needed motivation to "Run and Run like Hell" away from them. Vote Right, Vote Republican!
Notice how Obama kept talking about racism, being racist, acting racist &amp; looking racist. The black struggles &amp; divide. This is merely a Democrat tactic to keep you stuck in the pain of your ancestors. Don't be fooled by the tools used to keep your mind and behind stuck in a rut.
Obama said that we can't put walls up all around America, that it don't keep out threats like terrorist or disease. Wonder if he keeps his doors unlocked. As a man, does he protect his houses? Trump is the leader of American house &amp; he has every right to make sure it's protected.
Remember when Obama lied and said Manufacturing jobs of the past would never come back?  He said, "There's NO answer to it. What magic wand do you have?" Lol.... We have Trump.  A real @POTUS that made it happen for all Americans. Unemployment at an all time low. Thanks to Trump.
Remember when Obama ran on hope and change; Americans walked around with no hope, and he made out with a lot of change.  Sad that his arrogance so blinds him that he doesn't realize it's the Democrats who are running around pushing to Resist so that America will no longer Exist!

If @Facebook didn't know who we were, why did they verify our page with a blue check mark in 2015? We talked about "TRUMP" and promoted several posts with the name TRUMP included. Now FB has a case of amnesia like they don't know who we are. Undercover Censorship at its finest.
Today makes 1yr since @facebook began censoring our FB page. It's gone from bad to worse. Before we can boost or promote a post to our 1.7 million followers, with the name Trump included, we must now go through an authorization process to prove that we are not Russia Bots. WTH..

Maxine, babies can't be removed from their mothers arm because their irresponsible mother sent them to this country unaccompanied.  That's called child neglect.  Follow the laws and you won't have to suffer the consequences for breaking the law.  It's time to BUILD THE WALL......
How dare you fight for Illegal Aliens welfare but not fight for the welfare of the children that's suffering daily in your own district. Charity starts at home.  Advocate for better living conditions in the poverty stricken district you represent and refuse to live in. Hypocrite!
Maxine Waters is concerned about children living in detention centers but she's not concerned about the American children living in tents with no running water in her own district. Shame on you Maxine for allowing the American children in your district to live worst than animals.
