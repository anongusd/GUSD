@RandalRauser @DaleTuggy Air travel sucks, but it’s still (mostly) better than driving. And driving was all almost anybody could afford back when air travel sorta resembled the top picture. 		If you want to travel cross-country in a few hours for $200, leg room is a small sacrifice.

@dangainor I've enjoyed some fantasy, but I preferred stories that kept both feet in plausible reality. Once you ditch the "science" part, it can get silly fast. Science Fiction was more about how humans and societies dealt with things, not magic and dragons and whatnot.
@dangainor @petersuderman The mix of sci-fi with fantasy was always a vulnerability for the genre. I feel like there should be a distinction between the two, though I know that would be hard to clearly define and enforce.

@RandalRauser I have recommended you ("this Canadian theologian I read...") to probably 6-7 people over the past month. And I still have one of your recent posts pulled up to send to a pastor I know as part of an ongoing discussion we are having.
@RandalRauser Separate from the other discussion, allow me to thank you for your work on twitter and your blog. I read you very regularly, and deeply appreciate your perspective.
@RandalRauser Absolutely! But I am an agent who can have purposes. Does a hammer have a purpose? No. Only agents do. An agent can have a purpose for a hammer, but the hammer itself cannot have a purpose independent of an agent.
@RandalRauser ...where you are coming from and I don’t begrudge your conclusion. I appreciate the work of @SecularOutpost on some of these issues of evidential arguments being more probable on theism or atheism, and can agree that, at least, consciousness seems more probable on theism.
@RandalRauser Fair enough. I think teleology is imposing our values/purposes on non-agent factors - and it also struggles to explain “bad design,” or the compelling evidence that biological developments resemble makeshift adaptations rather than being purposely designed. But I do understand...
@RandalRauser I am not trying to be difficult, but I don’t know what that means. I think it is objectively true that hearts pump blood, and this is useful (and how!) to the bearer of a heart. I think it is true that agents (me and the polar bear) find that useful and regard it as our purpose.
@RandalRauser I am not. I thought I’ve been conversing with you long enough on Twitter and on your blog that you would know this by now!  :)
@RandalRauser One might plausible argue that DNA, in some limited sense, imparts a “purpose”, but that may be anthropomorphizing DNA as more than just information delivery mechanisms. It is when DNA is combined with selective mechanisms that it produces things of more or less useful value.
@RandalRauser Of course, there still *may* be such an agent - the Panama Canal was purpose built, but not all water passages are purpose built - but it does not seem necessary, given what we know about genetics and natural selection.
@RandalRauser The “purpose” of a polar bear’s white coat is simply a function of genetics and the evolutionary pressures of natural selection. An agent with intentions is superfluous to that process.
@RandalRauser Forgive me, I am returning to this late. I think the word “purpose” is understandable, but somewhat misleading, as we tend to think of “purpose” as a prior intention. That intention is not necessary for useful biological functions.
@RandalRauser Since DNA and natural selection explain the functions you are referring to, what “purpose” (by an agent) is needed? The use of the term seems like a linguistic convenience, rather than an indication that the function was intended by a rational agent making a decision.
@RandalRauser You’re switching between “function” and “purpose.” Which do you mean here?
@RandalRauser I find it to be a sufficient to explain how life developed, yes. We know DNA exists and results in variety. We know natural selection takes place, making useful functions more likely to be preserved. What additional agent intent is needed?
@RandalRauser Do we?  I agree that the language can be interpreted that way, but I don't think it must be interpreted that way. "Function" does not need to imply prior intention by an agent.
@RandalRauser Seems like it means something like “Functions to...”

@RandalRauser Without knowing the kind of argument you are referring to, I can't really comment. There definitely is a strain of ongoing fundamentalism/literalism among some atheists, though I think that is partly because that is the main form of Christianity that they want to argue against.
@RandalRauser Is it possible they are making an argument against a version of Christianity, you point out that there are other versions, and they then point out that the tendency of Christianity to be vague/slippery at every variable is a weakness, not a defense?

@RandalRauser @Renevelation I agree with that. Christianity is diverse, despite the best efforts of many who insist that their beliefs are the One True Version. That diversity has been a tremendous strength of Christianity, I think.

@ChrisMann209 @benshapiro Unless you think psychiatric medication is prescribed at about the same rate today as it was in the 1950s, I doubt you are right.
@MBNHedger @EL_RiNGER @CHSommers I suppose that is possible, but the annual data we have from later years changes very little. So it seems unlikely that annual data was extremely volatile in the 50’s/60’s.
@beachboyhhi @TarakNL Suicide certainly has many factors, but it is difficult to see how those things would be significant, considering the suicide rate has changed so little since the 50s.
@J_V_R_C That is not borne out by global data. 		https://t.co/cD3FI8xO2o
@beachboyhhi I don’t know what effect it has, but the chart shows suicide rates in 1950 were about the same as today. So it’s hard to pin much change on family size.
@XiolaBlues Perhaps less annualized data? Doesn’t really matter, though. The data is averaged, anyway.
@ChelleShaver Similar. Slight uptick in 2016, but that is the latest year for which we have data.
@BtheFinn Here: https://t.co/Hb4r3CPNz7		Also similar data here: https://t.co/cD3FI8xO2o

@beachboyhhi The rate is per 100,000 people. Population size is accounted for.

@tgiovanetti But it is about the same as it was in the 1950s.

@politicalmath I guess you can’t trust those liberal secularists at...Lifeway.		But really “wish they knew more” is not the same as “don’t know.” Although, I suspect many/most of them do only have a vague, second hand knowledge of what the Bible says about it.

The only thing more DC than the #WHCD is the annual harrumphing about the #WHCD.
@mike_stark Why shouldn’t they be able to decline to sell their own property? Surely the potential buyer can just offer more money.

@RandalRauser What would imperfect design look like? Your argument seems to assume we could not identify perfect or imperfect design at all. And if that is the case, why think we can even identify design?

@ColinBurgess_ed @CounterApologis @TamaraBrouwer1 So would you say that Christians are not persecuted in the Middle East? And that Christians in the Middle East should just “placate the idiots” by lying to them and “go on living"? And does it also confuse you when Christians elsewhere express sympathy and support for them?
@ColinBurgess_ed @CounterApologis @TamaraBrouwer1 I’m sure the “atheists (who) face death in 13 countries” will be relieved to hear it has nothing to do with their religious beliefs! 		https://t.co/2hnxmwLFR7
@ColinBurgess_ed @CounterApologis @TamaraBrouwer1 So the Christians who are beaten or killed in the Middle East are not killed because they are Christians, but because they do not adopt the state religion? And what do you imagine the difference is?
@ColinBurgess_ed @TamaraBrouwer1 @CounterApologis This is a bit far afield, but....I don't think anybody believes government is "the source" of freedom. It is the mechanism we use to secure the social contract in a given society. Rights and freedoms do not exist in the absence of a way to secure or enforce them.
@ColinBurgess_ed @TamaraBrouwer1 @CounterApologis I think lying can be a reasonable response to that kind of persecution. Do you think Christians in the middle east should be satisfied to pretend they are Muslims to escape persecution?
@ColinBurgess_ed @TamaraBrouwer1 @CounterApologis Why would you think atheists do not care about their own integrity? Why would you think atheists would be satisfied to live their lives undercover to avoid persecution? Some might, but that seems pretty terrible, right?

@SecularOutpost In that sense, the “atheist movement” is probably a bit like the “moral majority” or “religious right.” It is a small subset that attempts to coopt the identity for its own purposes that are at least somewhat tangential to the identity.

@RandalRauser @MBRoberts4004 And finally, the idea that NDE research is "not dominated by people who previously promoted New Age teachings or by theistic enthusiasts looking for data to bolster their claims” is wildly inaccurate, as his own essay demonstrates. He cites plenty of them!
@RandalRauser @MBRoberts4004 And the idea that blind people “seeing” and deaf people “hearing” "doesn’t seem to fit well with a naturalistic paradigm” is weird, as well. If NDEs are neurological phenomenon, I see no reason why that would not fit within a “naturalistic paradigm."
@RandalRauser @MBRoberts4004 That is not the case. NDE’s differ a great deal by cultural and religious backgrounds.
@RandalRauser @MBRoberts4004 I have spoken to Gary Habermas about this before, and he has acknowledged that non-veridical NDEs have no significant evidentiary value. Also, I was surprised to see Miller argue that "The content of the NDE doesn’t seem to be significantly influenced...religious expectations…"
@RandalRauser @MBRoberts4004 Please forgive the late response. In this context, I think veridical means something like “based on verifiable external evidence.” That is, something that can empirically validate testimony, particularly that cannot be explained by natural means.
@RandalRauser @MBRoberts4004 The closest that came to veridical OBE’s was an imaginary conversation with Hume, and a footnote to a book by an “education counselor” who moonlights writing about NDE stories.
@RandalRauser @MBRoberts4004 Are there any well-substantiated veridical OBEs? I have looked for them, after being urged to do so by various friends, but I have been unable to find anything more substantial than hearsay.

@RandalRauser True! It seems to me that the diversity (and sometimes vagueness) of the Bible has ultimately been a major strength for Christianity, in that it enables Christianity to adapt and evolve to fill more socio-religious niches.
@RandalRauser Fair. I agree. Re: defining Christian, it seems quite odd that Christians can’t seem to agree on what makes somebody a Christian. Paul says it’s just believing/professing that Jesus is Lord, but Christians seem to have a lot of other definitions.
@RandalRauser I don’t see much ambiguity. Is a Christian Nazi necessarily more Christlike than a Jewish child he executed? It is difficult to see how that could be argued.
@sjggraham What does it mean for a moral system to “work”?
@RandalRauser I’m a little concerned about the 1/3 who think the worst Christian in the world is more Christlike than any atheist. I would love to see that view defended, if only for the spectacle.

@LAFinanceGay Exactly.
@LAFinanceGay But the Title II regs do a lot more than just prevent Terrible Things from happening. The whole debate is just wretched with hyperbole and scare tactics. Everybody needs to take a deep breath and notice that the sky isn’t falling.
@LAFinanceGay Sure. My point is that ISPs and content providers can already get a “fast lane.”  They are legal and beneficial. The Title II do prohibit some other forms of discrimination, but my point is that the big guy advantage already exists.
@LAFinanceGay What?!? No it didn’t. Content providers have always been able to buy better, closet access to the network. It’s called CDNs and direct connections. This has been standard practice for decades and the 2015 ruling did not prevent it.

@LDoren By the way, I also think that it is impossible to defend Trump (overall) in good faith. If you think he is decent or honest, you are either indecent or dishonest. This is not a close judgment call.
@LDoren Invading Mexico is also an easy way to do it, but that doesn’t make it more sane. That is Trump’s schtick. Make stupid/crazy promises as disingenuous leverage. Read the transcript with Mexican President.
@LDoren Or that wall that Mexico was going to pay for, which Trump basically admitted was a bullshit promise.
@LDoren Still waiting for those tax returns to be released. Or Trump to testify to Congress about the Russian investigation. Or just look up any good list of Trump lies.
@LDoren This argument requires you to ignore a multitude of things he doesn’t follow through on. This is called confirmation bias.

@LDoren @davidfrum The media has made 10 mistakes? That seems like an incredibly low number.
@LDoren @davidfrum And what does that have to do with a quote wherein Frum explicitly acknowledges that the media made a mistake?
@LDoren @davidfrum Has he said “all attempts to take Trump down are legitimate”? Or are you inferring that because Frum’s views on Trump legitimize all attempts to take Frum down?
@LDoren @davidfrum Presumably, he means something like, “How the media acknowledges and corrects mistakes is the reason they should be trusted.” What does his views of Trump or writing a book have to do with it?

@MikeRathbone86 @DimorphistGuy @RandalRauser I was referring to non-discrimination laws regarding “public accommodations,” but your point about them still applying to Gov work is fair.
@MikeRathbone86 @DimorphistGuy @RandalRauser I think many people don’t want to make the case for total elimination of non-discrimination laws because they recognize that saying “diners can refuse to serve black people” is pretty unjust. But the “Gov should not force” argument requires it.
@MikeRathbone86 @DimorphistGuy @RandalRauser Your approach is consistent, within this question. I wish more people realized that the “Gov should not force...” view requires abolishment of non-discrimination laws entirely, not just a religious exemption.
@DimorphistGuy @MikeRathbone86 @RandalRauser Religious beliefs are Constitutionally protected at some level (1st Amendment), while emotional (conscience) beliefs are not given the same level of deference.

@RandalRauser @DimorphistGuy @MikeRathbone86 For what it’s worth, I think those advocating religious freedom exemptions need to do a MUCH better job of carefully defining the scope and limits of religious freedom. Currently, it seems to be “unlimited immunity for things my tribe cares about.”
@RandalRauser @DimorphistGuy @MikeRathbone86 Historically, non-discrimination laws have been balanced with other factors. The public interest of preventing racial discrimination can outweigh the interests of a religious exemption claim. The way it is balanced is usually addressed in the text of the law or legal precedent.
@RandalRauser @DimorphistGuy @MikeRathbone86 Sure they can.  They just have to make a plausible case that they sincerely held that as a religious belief and that the claim isn’t an ex post facto pretense. But....
@RandalRauser @DimorphistGuy @MikeRathbone86 A claimed belief does not have to be orthodox or reasonable, just sincere.
@RandalRauser @DimorphistGuy @MikeRathbone86 Courts can’t really judge the legitimacy of a religious belief, only whether the person sincerely believes it. So, a person couldn’t claim a religious objection as a pretense, when they clearly don’t believe or practice the belief.
@RandalRauser @DimorphistGuy @MikeRathbone86 Legally, it just has to be a “sincerely held” religious belief. The level of scrutiny and balancing of other public interests varies by jurisdiction.
@DimorphistGuy @MikeRathbone86 @RandalRauser Requiring disclosure addresses the fraud problem, as well. After all, it is arguably fraudulent to advertise sale to the general public, but refuse to make good on the offer.

@AndrewLSeidel @LizMair My view is that Trump is a deeply insecure man, who does everything out of a desperate need for respect and approval, but nothing ever fills it. And so, he tries more, bigger, louder, but none of his hysterics ever make him more respectable, or fill that desperate hole.

@moorehn If Boies didn’t tell them that he represented Rose, he violates legal ethics. If he did, there is no legal obligation to reiterate it in every sentence.
@moorehn Lawyers are always presumed to be speaking on behalf of their clients. I have rarely seen a lawyer preface every denial with “my client claims” language.
@moorehn Sure, but it is a betrayal by the client, not by his representative. Surely Boies didn’t profess personal knowledge of the incident.
@moorehn Again, I’m not defending him. Just making the distinction about who is lying when a lawyer asserts a client’s false denial.
@moorehn That is a completely different incident. I’m not defending Boies, just saying that a lawyer asserting his clients denial is not dishonest if the client turns out to have been lying.
@moorehn I’m not defending Boies here. I just don’t think it’s wise to blame lawyers for lying when their clients turn out to be guilty.

@LeonHWolf To be clear, I’m not objecting. I think your instinct is probably right. I just think it’s a difficult philosophical discussion that can be understandably perceived as insensitive to the victims.

@sjggraham Fair enough. I think “unworthy” would be a better term than “worthless.” That said, I do think that there is a significant strain of Christianity that pushes the notion of “unworthy” pretty far into the “worthless” territory. But that is a cultural/theological debate.
@sjggraham No doubt, but Job did not counter-argue that he was worthy. There is a general theme through the Bible of humans being unworthy, alienated from God. Not unvalued, but unworthy. "Total Depravity" may be wrong, but it didn’t come out of nowhere.
@shanemuk @sjggraham Granted, “worm” is a figure of speech, but Job 25:6: “...how much less a mortal, who is a maggot, and a human being, who is a worm!”

@AdamSerwer Skewed view of reality (especially political reality) and constantly manipulated by promises of salvation.
@AdamSerwer I’m referencing a pretty wide range of issues where this same pattern applies.
@AdamSerwer Republican resentment seems to be a remarkably pliable thing.
@AdamSerwer Republicans were angry at Rubio for supporting the “amnesty” bill, but well over 60% of Republicans supported it.
@AdamSerwer That anger has been a little too flexible to be real. Republicans demand spending cuts, but oppose specific spending cuts.
@AdamSerwer Who? Because I think conservatives have a bubble problem.
@AdamSerwer Their own virtual reality and the difference between that and the real world.
Republican voters aren't really upset at wealthy, lying elites. They nominated him.

@JohnWonderlich There is no objective definition of “public interest”. Person A and B can define it differently and both can be right.
@JohnWonderlich Although, some would argue that shifting money to favor different paths is a feature, not a bug.
@JohnWonderlich Absolutely. There is no clear line. Which, btw, illustrates the ultimate futility with campaign finance reform.
@JohnWonderlich And Foundation money tends not to be counted as political funding, when it often is very much so.
@JohnWonderlich Corporate funding? Bias.  Foundation funding? Oh, well, that’s just fine.
