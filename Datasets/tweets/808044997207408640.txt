I think by making the games close we give the Warriors a sense of accomplishment. They haven‚Äôt accomplished anything. It‚Äôs bad for the NBA and the CAVS were still close.
This 2018 NBA CAVS V Warriors series is about Alexander V Goliath.
I love that were the underdogs. I think it‚Äôll make a fire in us. Go CAVS.
I‚Äôm in a mean machine focus right now. Pumped. #recruiting
The immaculate recruiter. https://t.co/SvhwptmWkq
It‚Äôs been non stop work. Maybe I‚Äôm just really bad at what I do, lol. ü§™
When LeBron scores under 30 points and the CAVS win, we‚Äôre a championship team.
I think I‚Äôm learning that the goal of Twitter is just to say clever things.
Yo. Did anyone just see that LeBron pass? Yo. I think I goated low key. Going to bathroom right now. üêê
I think the greatest entrepreneurs feel a sense of urgency that scares them. They‚Äôre the most aware of time. It‚Äôs kind of sad. It‚Äôs like imagine how much life Steve Jobs really lived in under 60 years.
I don‚Äôt get how you hate on the Cleveland Cavaliers. The entire city of Cleveland is literally against the 21st century. #lol. I mean this literally, but I love my city.
Easy to feel burn out. Easy to burn.
It‚Äôs not a crime to fail. It‚Äôs not a crime to dream.

The Universe has a unique destiny that it needs you to fulfill. Get rid of those bad distractions. You‚Äôre running out of time. Hurry.

I have an amazing VP of Engineering opening. Ping me at alden@fyndtalent.com for more info :)
It is likely that the very acts of genius that will appear before us in this day of age will have passed us by because we have stood to close to them. Genius has no living presence.
We often fear that if we try we will fail, but the only fear we should have is the fear of not acting.
Happy Friday. Crush it all today. Hit them goals. Ignore the noise. The pressure isn‚Äôt pressure.
