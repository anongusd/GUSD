The new MCI treatment guidelines recommend exercising at least twice a week. https://t.co/cqkNDzXOip
Evidence links exercise with better memory in people with MCI. Exercising can offer mental and social stimulation while improving blood flow to the brain, possibly even prompting the release of molecules that repair brain cells and create connections between them. https://t.co/rV4bw2bFR6
MCI can often be reversed if a general health condition (such as sleep deprivation) is causing the decline. In those cases, addressing the underlying cause can dramatically improve cognition. https://t.co/xezpolFNo0
