@DavidBowieGlam I need your help tremendously. Can you read all of my tweets that i tweeted to wells fargo and help me to get some type of relieve by spreading our story. My boyfriend is not capable of making decisions and we are being discriminated severely against this company

*1st tweet* I went into the bank yesterday after receiving an email that mr. Hendrix's and my joint  account was being closed due to it possibly being compromised. This was not the case because we verified all transactions. Then i was asked by the bank manager to
