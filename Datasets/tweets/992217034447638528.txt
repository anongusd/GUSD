@dD94865242 a good idea but the example of how the malignant narcissist created as many as 2400 orphans is how this government is run.  imagine full-flown tariff wars with no idea of how to end them, or a third rate Russia dismantling the EU or a fiscal crisis of the federal government .
President Narcissist created the problems of babies, toddlers and children separated, supported the policy until he signed an Executive Order partially reversing the policy and has created hundreds if not thousands of de facto orphans which he wont recognized as a problem.  WTF ?
