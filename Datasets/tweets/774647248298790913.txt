@DiamondandSilk We all respect the flag but it was not the president's business to stick his nose where it did not belong he's the one that started this
Where was the real issues in Alabama last night about the hurricane victims about the earthquake in Mexico tax reform
President Trump you need to start focusing on the real issues Senator Luther strange you should have focusing on him a little bit more
That campaign that persistent Trump did last night in Alabama should not have been about Hillary Clinton or the NFL

President Trump you can call the healthcare a train wreck all you want to but  you been rolling back policies to help the healthcare
President Trump while you going out there saying the healthcare is a train wreck why don't you tell the people you've been rolling back
How all of  these politicians is treating these taxpayers is  horrible these guys is paying your salary tell them the truth
If I was your voter's your Medicaid will get cut and Planned Parenthood will get defund it Washington DC hasn't really told y'all true
To all of these voters out there thinking that they gonna get a repeal and replace on Healthcare y'all is going to get cuts
these politicians and Washington DC will sell their voters in need anything there ain't no repeal-and-replace that ain't nothing but a lie
I do support the Affordable Healthcare Act but I will support a compromise and bipartisan healthcare Act
Please support Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty Murray health care bill I think that is the best deal can pass 👍🇺🇸
To the Republican party I don't usually go out on a limb to help your party but if u  go through with this phase out Medicaid it will cost u
To the Republican Party you phase-out Medicaid you will have the biggest Bloodbath this will cost your party like it never cost it before
If you ain't got nothing to hide on Healthcare why don't you tell the American people what's going to happen to their health care be a man
Why don't you tell the American people you going to take away their Medicaid and Medicare why don't you tell them what a block Grant is
To Washington DC to Senator Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy if y'all ain't got nothing to hide with this health care bill put it out there
Oh by the way there ain't no free market if there was everybody would have health care it is time for Washington DC to stop selling this lie
And if Republicans wants to fix Healthcare is time for them to bring the Democrats to the table and get this done right
It's time for the Democratic party Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to tell the Republican party this is your last chance you can't keep on
To the Republican party you done been down this road since 2011 on the Affordable Healthcare Act , taxpayers don't have this kind of money
Here's what I know is this Republicans and Democrats needs to get together and some this Healthcare problem
@purplehassan @1annafantastic All of his songs and videos just touched my heart so bad , Prince will always be a part of my life I knew  there was one artist was the best

Yes, really funny to me that fox new  is shouting about Russia
To the Republican Party once again you done mislead your voters this is not a repeal and they replace health care bill
To the Republican Party once again you done mislead your voter again
To the media it's not called that white worked in class start calling it The American work in class
To the Democratic party if start putting up better candidates start putting the blame where it's supposed to be your candidate was bad
For all of these Democrats is complaining about rep Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi did not lose this if you  don't start putting up better
2 blue dogs you want to stay in the Democratic Party you have to choose you want to reach out to the Republican party then join their team
And blue dogs you want to stay in the Democratic Party you have to choose which party you are in you want to reach out to Republicans
Blue dogs if you want to stay in the Democratic Party you need to start talking about Democrat ideas
It is not that blue dogs needs a message they need to start talking about their ideas and stop listening to your critics and the media
Blue dogs did not reach out to the other Democratic voters and blue dogs can't understand why do they keep on losing the Republicans is not
You you have 4special  elections and there was four blue dogs and what did blue dogs chose to do to reach out to Republicans
How stupid was the media. Democrats wants to win stop putting up blue dogs blue dogs is not reaching out to the other Democratic voters
Senator Mitch McConnell why don't you tell me American people when Democrats did the ACA y'all ideals was  in the ACA so stop lying
Senator Mitch McConnell premiums was going to go up regardless you need to start going out there and tell him the American people the truth
Senator Mitch McConnell I'm getting a little bit tired of you complaining about the ACA premiums is going up premiums
@realDonaldTrump That's because he is supporting his girlfriend while she goes to college you was really desperate for a win so will almost bring up anything
2 Senator Mitch McConnell nice try you try to dismantle the ACA and then you want to go out there and lie to the American people nice try
Mt Senator Mitch McConnell you want to go on the floor and say the ACA ain't working because you ain't doing nothing to try to fix the ACA
It is time for the Republican Party to stop blaming President Obama he's no longer president anymore Republicans you is now in charge

For the Republican Party if you want Democrats to follow the law maybe you should do that same thing and stop cherry picked
To the media you want to get on President Obama about his red line but you never want ask Republican why didn't they take up that vote
And for Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi I like your both a lot but why is you praising this for you going to take that same vote for war
And for the people in the White House you don't want to tell us your plan we is taxpayers guess what we have every right to know your plan
The same Republicans us a bunch of hypocrites when President Obama brought you the bill to strike you did not want to take that vote
I am sick and tired of Republicans is always complain when there's a democrat in the white house but in the end they never want do there job

No tax cut for the republican into the no	Till the American people a raise
Republican don't want to tell you that they going to use the health care money to pay for there tax cut
Why didn't nobody is ask republican why didn't you sit down with democrats and repair the affordable health care law bill
Republicans is trying to fool u guys they wanna get rid of the Affordable Health Care Act so they can use the money to pay for their tax cut
To the Democratic party do not bail the Republican Party out because they break it they own it they break this Health Care own it
I get Affordable Health Care it's not in perfect shape but I don't get why Republicans did not sit down with Democrats to fix this law
The only reason why Republicans what this Health Care law to be gone because President Barack Obama's name is on that law
I want to apologize for taking the lord's name in vain I want to apologize to my heavenly father upstairs I am very sorry
@livwarfield @therealshelbyj @Judith_Hill thank you I hope everybody have a wonderful bless time stay safe Prince we love you always

Congratulations to R&amp;B n pop artist Janet Jackson and her husband on their baby God has sent you a beautiful gift
So what possibilities could go wrong on the health care law don't forget 2008 we had a finance crisis
This was the same Republicans in the 90s did Finance Reform Bill and then in 2008 we had a financial crisis so
what was the reason why Republicans did not want to fix dot Healthcare because President Barack Obama's name was on that Bill
@ProFanzForum thank you how is you doing today I hope you have a wonderful bless Wednesday afternoon have a safe one ✌ and much 💘 always
To Megyn Kelly from Fox News congratulations on your new job
Republican know this will back 🔥 Paul Ryan didn't tell us he was going to get rid of Medicare and Medicaid so what was he hiding
Today we remember espn broadcast Stuart Scott rest my angle
Republicans say the health care law failed because they did not want to help Democrats fix it so therefore he is responsible to
You get Medicare or Medicaid Eyes Wide Open because Republicans ain't not let you know one thing you was warned
If there was a free market we all would be having Health Care Republicans don't want people to know the truth so they'd rather lie
Let me tell Republicans something I was not born yesterday there is no free market that is a lie
Happy 🎂 to Denise Katrina Matthews best know as vanity rest my sweet angle
@SteveBennett7 I do thank  all the countries who pay tribute two prints on New Year's Eve Prince we miss u we love u very much my brother
If u going to repeal the health-care Republicans then u need to go out there and tell the American people that they going to lose it
If Republicans going to repeal the Health Care Act name me 10 things why the health-care does then I want you to go out and sale it
Because a lot of democratic voters out there dont think the Democratic party don't have their backs
If Blue Dog Democrats wants to be in the Democratic Party you can not  keep on crossing over vote with the Republican Party
If the Democrats ever want to get back into office again they need to start to listen to the Democratic voters and not be a sell-out
Happy 🎂 to actor denzel Washington
To the Democrat Washington DC don't pay your salary your voters pay your salary that's who you need to start listening to
Democrats if you want to win do me a favor stop listening to the people and the Press and stop listening to the Republicans
For the people in the medias you ain't helping Democrats at all here they need a dose of their own medicine because they did not listing
To the people in the media wants to blame Barack Obama for the Democrat that lost they need to start blaming themselves

Democrats if you going to replace the healthcare why did you vote for the bill just because Republicans is now in charge you going to cave
Senator Claire mccaskill just said on Facebook that she's willing to replace the Affordable Healthcare so does that mean that Medicare too
If Democrats don't start standing up what did voters want and stopped caving to the Republican Party you will never win again
@Prince4Xmas count me in
you want to laugh at the Democratic party go right ahead because  if this don't go right they will be back to my Republicans out there
To the Republicans I would not be going on TV and laughing at the Democrats because now you'll have to governed because if this don't goes
You can say Merry Christmas happy holidays happy Hanukkah season greetings just as long as you as celebrating baby Jesus birthday

Republicans also deserve some of this blame they also could fix the Affordable Health Care stop playing the blame game and just fix it
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Republicans did everything that they did everything that they could do to block the Affordable Health
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton I got one question to ask you I want you to ask Republicans what have they did to fix the Affordable h c
People going to have to start holding the Republicans Feet 2 the same fire as they hold the Democrats feet fire stop the blame game
Democrats trying to put bills on the table but Republicans kept on blocking these bill 2 people it's going to have to start holding
What has the Republicans did for the African American community and the Latino community 2 every bill that Democrats tried to put on table
The question everybody needs to be asking ourselves is this what has Republicans did for the African American community
The media just can't take Republican talking points and say Democrats have not did nothing for the African American community and the Latino
Just like Democrats went in there and fix Social Security and fix Medicare and Republicans could a easy fix the Affordable Healthcare 2
Republicans can't really complain about Affordable Health Care because they did everything that they could to block it
I got a message for all the voters out there you got a republican Congress ask yourself this do you want the same gridlock if not then vote
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton I got one message for you don't let Donald J Trump scare off the Democratic vote they need to vote now
@kylegriffin1 @nytimes that is not that surprise this is what he does all the time
So Congress tell the Republican Congress to do their job if the Democratic Congress can fix things so can the Republican Congress
Democrats got in there and fix Social Security fix Medicare and then they work with bush to do Medicare Part D so tell
If Congress were the fix Affordable Health Care you wouldn't have this problem tell congress to do there job

It doesn't matter how long you been in office hear about somebody being there for 30 years just as long as they can do the job
