One final tweet @JamesTScorpio1. 2 questions: Do you not believe that Holy Spirit had hand in election of Pope Francis — and in his more welcoming, less judgmental approach? 2. Was not Jesus a reformer criticized by Pharisees who liked to say who was real Jew and who wasn’t? https://t.co/erCynI00UF
P.S., @JamesTScorpio1, I have reported enough on religion to say that many Catholics — probably including Pope Francis — do not share your nostalgia for the pre-VII Church. Do u want a smaller “purer” Church, as Pope Benedict talked about? https://t.co/EJgku8VgU0
So, @JamesTScorpio1 are you saying hell is filled with Catholics from past centuries who sided with Galileo instead of Church, or who objected to Church’s longtime anti-Semitism? I am Catholic, a practicing one, but I write as a journalist not a spokesman for the Catholic Church. https://t.co/JhVBeLgSlx

@PetriOP Thank you, Father. I always appreciate &amp; need prayers. Then, don't we all? Lived and reported in DC 2003-07. Went to Holy Trinity in G'town.
@DomenicVadala @PetriOP The women would agree with you on that, Domenic. They consider church hierarchy patriarchal and sexist and want to change church. News!
@PetriOP Send me the book! Enjoyed talking to you, Father. Where are you based? I grew up in Cincinnati area -- my dad was a permanent deacon.
@DomenicVadala @PetriOP I quote the diocese spokesman saying that very thing in the story, Domenic.
@PetriOP Are you saying the Catholic Church has never changed? See Vatican II's writings on the relationship with Jewish community. Look up Galileo.
@PetriOP It's women who want to be priests. Protestant denominations fought this battle re: women clergy. Things changed. Not saying RCC will.
@PetriOP I think it's clear they are not in accordance with the Catholic Church rules and teachings as they are now understood.
@PetriOP You definitely speak for a lot of people, Father. But there are other points of view, even inside the church.
@fhill55 Lie? Didn't I say they they were automatically excommunicated?
@PetriOP I'm lifelong Catholic, active member of Jesuit church. Reporting the news also includes covering critics of church on issues up for debate.
