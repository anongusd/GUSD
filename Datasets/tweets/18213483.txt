Bottom line: Mexico is not safe for people on the move looking for protection, and this new deal could be deadly. The US government must treat people with compassion, not contempt, and allow them to pursue safety inside the US.
In May, an LGBTI shelter on the Mx side of the border was attacked, robbed, &amp; set on fire. Attackers shouted homophobic slurs, threatening to kill everyone if they didn‚Äôt leave. ‚ÄúIt seems like everybody wants to kill us,‚Äù the coordinator of the group in the shelter said.
We have documented many cases of violence against people waiting in Mexico before the US will hear their case. LGBTI folks and families are at particularly high risk. Read more in our latest report. https://t.co/pmfQlln6fI
In August 2018, the US @StateDept itself issued a statement advising against all travel to the Mexican side of the border in Tamaulipas State, due to kidnappings, murder, and other violence targeting civilians. 		Why is it suddenly safe enough for asylum seekers to wait there?
The US and Mexico have negotiated a ‚Äúremain in Mexico‚Äù deal, which means people looking for safety in the US will be stuck in #Mexico until they find out if they can enter the US. Make no mistake: this could be deadly. Read our response here. https://t.co/O3bF6t4k5G

#SaudiArabia has an appalling human rights track record. Their investigation into the killing of #JamalKhashoggi lacks credibility. A @UN investigation is needed so that those who are responsible are held accountable and face justice.
We welcome reports that #Turkey is calling for an international investigation into #JamalKhashoggi‚Äôs murder. #Turkey must request that the UN sets an investigation now.
Saudi prosecutor demands death penalty for 5 suspects in #JamalKhashoggi murder after sham inquiry. We need a credible investigation to establish facts &amp; ensure those responsible are brought to justice in fair trials with no death penalty.
Today‚Äôs outcome of the #Saudi investigation on the killing of #JamalKhashoggi is simply not trustworthy. An independent UN investigation is the only option to uncover the truth and achieve justice.

10/10 "Dear @Erna_Solberg, we call on you to take action. We'd also like to invite you to our school, to explain why "immigration policy considerations" dictate it necessary to send Taibeh and her little brother to Afghanistan just before their exams." #TellNorway #AbbasiStays
9/10 "Many people believe that Norwegian values are being threatened by mass immigration. For us, Norwegian values are about important things like freedom, democracy, inclusion, humanity and respect for human dignity and human rights."
8/10 "We cannot understand that you and your government can stand for such inhumane and unfair treatment of human beings."
7/10 "We have done social studies at school and we understand that immigration policy is difficult. But for us, human considerations must always count the most ‚Äì quick-fix arguments about woolly political concepts will never justify destroying young people's lives."
6/10 "Since we know you are an avid advocate of women's rights and education, we think it would be strange if you were seen to defend a decision that we perceive to be particularly hostile to women."
5/10 "Taibeh is being sent to Afghanistan, the country her parents fled before she was born. A country she has never been to and has no network in. A country affected by war and terror, where girls in particular are practically without rights."
4/10 "It's hard to imagine the incredible effort invested in adapting to a completely different culture, learning a new language and completing her education in the way that Taibeh has done. Now it seems that this will all go to waste."
3/10 "By all accounts she seemed set to finish with an excellent diploma. Taibeh's goal is to enter university to study medicine, which for her is an absolutely realistic goal."
2/10 "Our fellow student Taibeh has now lived in Norway for 6 years. In three months she was supposed to graduate from Thora Storm High School."
1/10 "Dear Erna. As you probably know, Taibeh Abbasi and her family received the message from the Norwegian Immigration Authority that the family must travel to Afghanistan by 11 March."
#Norway is threatening to imminently deport Taibeh Abbasi and her family to Afghanistan‚Äîa place she has never even lived in, and a place that we know is not safe. But these high school students aren't giving up on their friend. This is their open letter to PM @Erna_Solberg: https://t.co/BghktZ0ck0
