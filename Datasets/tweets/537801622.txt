@MarkHarlan_AD @Utah_Football @TheMUSS Mark, I’d like to see some of that Crimson Club money spent on fines calling out the @Pac12Football officiating.  Utes have been full-share members of the PAC for awhile, Time we start getting treated like it.
@975Hans No worse than the Utes offense.
@DohnGrigsby @sheeshkabob @realDonaldTrump A plea deal is a conviction.  They plead guilty and are then sentenced to prison time.  So yes, there have been convictions.
@espn700bill Despite the horrible officiating, particularly the non-calls on UW, the Utes had chances.  Recs need to catch &amp; hold the ball, and we all learned a throw from the 1 is a bad idea in the SB. Well @CoachTaylorUU didn’t.
@Pac12Football two targeting calls on the Utes and not one against Britain Covey.  You guys suck!
@CoachTaylorUU Fourth and a half yard on the one-and-a-half and you pass? Nice job Pete Carroll. Put Huntley under center and push the damn line!
@Pac12Football What is the going rate for an officiating crew? Does it change based on the game? Asking for future reference. #UWvsUTAH
@utahathletics Just walk off the field.  This officiating is garbage.  What’s the worst the Pac12 can do?  Levy a fine?
@ScottyG1280 What’s the worst the Pac12 can do if the Utes just walk off the field and call it a game?  Be the best protest of Pac12 officiating in history.

@MelissaASheriff @mazzmerizer @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump I've been nothing but respectful.  Hope your conflict resolution business is more successful than your abilities shown on this thread.  I'll take my law degree and experience over your interpretation.
@MelissaASheriff @mazzmerizer @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump 3/ You May want to check Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 88 (1985) and United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377 (1922). I also attached a Yale Law Review article for reference. I see your NY appellate case and raise you 2 SCOTUS precedents.		https://t.co/7Ce5ea2qUW
@MelissaASheriff @mazzmerizer @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump 2/ When defendant was convicted on the second degree contempt, the NY state appellate court noted that double jeopardy attached.  He committed one protective order violation and couldn’t be convicted of contempt twice under the state statute.
@MelissaASheriff @mazzmerizer @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump 1/ Except People v. Campbell, 269 A.D.2d 460 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000), has nothing to do with state v. fed offenses and double jeopardy. Defendant was charged under state law for a first and second degree criminal contempt for one protective order violation.
@MelissaASheriff @Ingenius31 @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump This would lead me to believe that it’s not worth the taxpayers’ funds to prosecute.
@MelissaASheriff @Ingenius31 @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump I would suspect that the NY AG is now looking into NY Stat. 14-114 on campaign contributions. NY Stat. 14-126(6) days it’s a Class E felony, which is usually no jail and 1-4 years probation.
@MelissaASheriff @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump I’m a licensed practicing attorney.  I’ve taken an oath to uphold it (twice in fact, state and fed court). And I’m damn sick and tired of all people on both sides saying that if you don’t agree with their views they don’t know the Constitution.
@MelissaASheriff @Ingenius31 @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump When I said what state law, I meant I did not know the specific New York statute section. I got that it was NY form the NY AG comment.  I’m licensed in Utah, not New York so I don’t know what section of NY code.
@TenneyNaumer @NormOrnstein The German government can reject his credentials and refuse to accept him as ambassador.
@mfuhrman1 @NormOrnstein @ToniSmithRosari And the problem with that is that when @BarackObama did that, people thought the country was weak.  It wasn’t, just that people thought so.
@MelissaASheriff @Ingenius31 @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump Also, as someone else pointed out, if the state law was passed after his alleged crimes, state AG can not prosecute, plus there are statute of limitation issues. There are plenty of defenses, but double jeopardy isn’t one of them.
@MelissaASheriff @Ingenius31 @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump I see it.  I don’t know what state law they would prosecute under.  My point was merely that people can be charged under both state and federal law without double jeopardy attaching. State and Fed are two separate sovereigns under the Constitution.
@LuluBelleNan @MelissaASheriff @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump Correct, statute of limitations will be an issue.
@mazzmerizer @MelissaASheriff @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @realDonaldTrump I’m inferring no such thing.  My point was simply that many people who claim to love the constitution simply don’t understand the entire document.
@GOPLeader it’s nu-clee-ar not nuke-you-lar.
@DanaBashCNN when politicians don’t answer questions, journalists should simply point out they aren’t answering the question and end the interview.  When the TV time goes away, they may start answering questions.
@GOPLeader so we’re not concerned about lies if the economy and DPRK is going well? Seems ridiculous. Answer @DanaBashCNN questions!
@MelissaASheriff @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara Federal and state crimes are different.  SCOTUS has already ruled that double jeopardy does not attach for state and federal crimes and @DineshDSouza can be prosecuted for state crimes. @realDonaldTrump can’t pardon for state conviction. It’s all in the Constitution you love.
@NNevdar @goolammv @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara Federal and state crimes are different and double jeopardy doesn’t attach.
@DineshDSouza @PreetBharara You pleaded guilty of a federal crime in federal court. As a GOP conservative that cares about the Constitution, you should know a state can still convict on state crimes.

@dapplegraypony @MikeC1163 @Rebelsoldier29 @GeraldoRivera @TiaCarra @realDonaldTrump The issue to me isn’t that he had an affair with a porn star. He cheated on his first wife with second, and his second with his third, so this is no surprise. It’s the hypocrisy of the GOP calling out the hypocrisy of the Dems that’s hilarious.
@Rebelsoldier29 @GeraldoRivera @TiaCarra @realDonaldTrump And the GOP called it out and became the “Family Values Party.”  But with Pres. Trump, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, and others, you don’t get that moniker anymore.
@AriFleischer It’s only a big deal as part of the larger picture. If President Trump lied about this, what else has he lied about? We should all wait until the special counsel has finished his investigation. Also, President Trump could use your advice before he keeps tweeting.
@AriFleischer I don’t agree with your politics, but agree with you here.  I don’t think the payment is “illegal” to the level of impeachable offense, and if he did repay the funds with personal funds, then the impropriety has been rectified. Pres. was never under oath here.
@DaOfficialPRIME @World_Wide_Wob He’s listed at 6’3” with a 6’10” wingspan.

@rafb77 @BillyBRigger @dean_noah @RepDonBeyer Sorry, wrong again.  According to the most recent data available, the top 1% pay 35.06% of all federal income taxes.		https://t.co/qzl9UCBxFe		https://t.co/IJEQoYS6Im
@realDonaldTrump So you still can’t get to 50% in a self-selecting, easily-manipulated, online poll?  You’re right, if you can’t pull this off there’s no way you colluded with Russia.
@realDonaldTrump You tweeted that Global Climate Change was a hoax made up by China.  Now I’m confused, is it made up by China or the Liberals?  Never mind, I’ll stick with the scientists that are experts on this. You can talk to us about filing bankruptcy for your businesses.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends #FakeNews
@BillyBRigger @dean_noah @RepDonBeyer And no one pays that amount.  They spend way less on tax attorneys and accountants to avoid that rate.
@BillyBRigger @dean_noah @RepDonBeyer It has been 39.6%, so maybe math isn’t your strong suit?

@joshtpm Based on Janet’s refusal to say “no” on whether she believes any of the women, I am lead to one conclusion.  At least some women are believable and Roy Moore is a pedophile.  Thanks Janet!

@rukes about sums up @realDonaldTrump and the #TrumpsterFire
@USAforTrump2016 I tweeted about @realDonaldTrump, but it was how #TrumpsterFire got blasted.
@realDonaldTrump failed at steaks, vodka, mortgages, bike races, casinos, airlines, and water. How do you fail at bottled H2O in the US?

@espn fix the @ESPNFantasy app!!!
@espn @ESPNFantasy is the problem that you guys suck at your one job?  If so, we all identified that problem as well.
@espn @ESPNFantasy not the first time this has happened.  Get your shit together and don't mess with the app the opening week.
@SportsCenter and the programmers for the @ESPNFantasy app have been fired?
@SportsCenter your staff should be all hands on deck fixing @ESPNFantasy app, not posting anything else on social media.
@realDonaldTrump while you're at it, release your tax returns! #TrumpsterFire #DisasterDonald

@rudygiulianiGOP if there were no terrorist attacks in the US until Pres. Obama came around, can you explain what happened on 9/11/01?
@realDonaldTrump if the media covered you honestly, you wouldn't be the Republican nominee.  #TrumpsterFire #DishonestDon
@realDonaldTrump @CNN I don't think you do.
@realDonaldTrump when they talk about the 60 Americans killed in embassy attacks under George W. Bush.
@realDonaldTrump show us your tax returns!!!
@realDonaldTrump yet you endorsed many of them?
@SportsCenter not really. One, couldn't get it to home. Two, if he had the distance, it would land at third instead.
@br_uk @BleacherReport he'd be 40th in gold medals, not "medal count."
@realDonaldTrump wanted a Purple Heart, deferred draft 4x. Doesn't mention National Purple Heart Day once on social media feed!
@realDonaldTrump what happens when you can't kick the NY Times out of a press conference?
@realDonaldTrump you dodge questions now!! Show tax returns!!
@realDonaldTrump so now your brain "short-circuit"?

@realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods says the reality TV host.
@realDonaldTrump it's like a train wreck. We know it's horrible, but can't stop watching. Not necessarily a good thing.
@realDonaldTrump respond with some sort of sacrifice you made. For now, it seems like you only sacrificed US jobs to Mexico and China.
@realDonaldTrump says the man who makes his suits there.
@realDonaldTrump Disastrous Donald: More people stop to watch a car wreck than stop to admire free-flowing traffic.
@realDonaldTrump Disastrous Donald is doing Lying Ted impersonation.
@realDonaldTrump Disastrous Donald, the violent crime rates are down.
@NeilTurner_ @realDonaldTrump as opposed to Disastrous Donald Trump, who won't release tax returns or give to charity until called out.
@realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter correct, we're moving on from the 1870s.
@realDonaldTrump when has Bernie not looked angry?
@realDonaldTrump going from 2 to 4 is technically more and more, but not significant.
@BorisEP @HillaryClinton I didn't realize the First Lady had some sort of constitutional power to sign off on trade agreements.
@BorisEP because patriotism is not measured by the size or number of American flags in view of the tv monitors.
@BorisEP @CNN @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump funny that all the fact checkers had Hillary as more truthful than Dishonest Donald Trump.
@BorisEP @CNNPolitics No kidding we don't know the money @realDonaldTrump has given to charity, we haven't seen tax returns! Show us returns

@espn700bill time for a QB or coordinator change. I get it hurts a QB psyche, but no harm when it's already damaged beyond repair.
@UteReef33 Called you out after USC, but back to say nice job by the DBs against ASU despite loss.
@1280Spence how about calling out Coaches Whit and Christensen for their horrible offensive play calling?
@1280Spence can't blame Andy for poor coaching.
@espn700bill Could you please ask Kyle about the excessive cushion given to USC WRs by our DBs?  Why no press coverage or jam at the line?

@tribjazz.  I like Hayward, but not @ max. Let CLE eat a max deal w/ Wiggins coming in &amp; pursue Ariza or Parsons.
@tribjazz
@DJJazzyJody not to mention $25,000,000.
@Lockedonsports Honestly, not that invested in RJeff an Biedrins, not even for a year.
@Lockedonsports sorry PG is Burke.
@Lockedonsports also Biedrins as 3rd big in rotation is not going to cut it. Look for additional trades.
@Lockedonsports No. Something else going down. Only PG on roster is Burks, Foye still liked, and glut at SF w/ Williams/Jefferson/Hayward.
@DJJazzyJody have to believe need for PG and like to resign Foye means something else in the works.  As of now, Burke only PG on the roster.
Have to believe the Jazz plan to move RJ or Biedrins or both elsewhere.  Puts roster at 12 (w/o Neto) and Burke is the only PG.
@Lockedonsports Millsap.  Jefferson appears to be odd man out.  Start Favors and Millsap, Kanter off bench for now.  DFav can play 4 or 5.
@1280Spence and no $12 million/year contract that hamstrung the roster.
The more I hear of his press conference(s), the more impressed I am with @Trey_Burke3.  Welcome to Utah!!!
@shantelle8 @NickRimando loving his saves.  Made three great ones in the last 30 minutes.  And the ref sucked hard core.
