@Paigowtommy @DanCrenshawTX I don't WANT any such thing. I KNOW a pet wall doesn't solve the problem.
@6oprahs6gulag6 @mikenshell2 @batts_jlynn @BernieSandner @DavidMcAlpine @Garrett_FoxNews @BobMenendezNJ If only we could elect our representatives thru voting...oh, wait.  Sadly, far too many people don't vote thinking their vote won't matter...and so here we are...
@Used_2_be_Ron @mikenshell2 @batts_jlynn @BernieSandner @DavidMcAlpine @Garrett_FoxNews @BobMenendezNJ And this is from September., much higher now.
@mikenshell2 @batts_jlynn @BernieSandner @DavidMcAlpine @Garrett_FoxNews @BobMenendezNJ Glad you're able to laugh at yourself. I admire that in a person.
@Paigowtommy @DanCrenshawTX I certainly agree with your last sentence.
@Paigowtommy @DanCrenshawTX Duh. They were caught crossing the border. No wall needed. Please do some independent  research.
@Paigowtommy @DanCrenshawTX They were apprehended AT THE BORDER. Not while committing a crime. Read more than Twitter, watch more than FOX.
@DanCrenshawTX Apprehended... doesn't that mean they were caught? So...why need a wall?
@mikenshell2 @batts_jlynn @BernieSandner @DavidMcAlpine @Garrett_FoxNews @BobMenendezNJ I know, I know. As long as its Trump it's ok. You know, I don't care if you voted for him and support him but blind allegiance is foolish. Use your critical thinking skills. You must see his faults and problems else you are nothing but a hapless sycophant.
@mikenshell2 @batts_jlynn @BernieSandner @DavidMcAlpine @Garrett_FoxNews @BobMenendezNJ Trump doesn't spend an inordinate  amount of time golfing at his own clubs at taxpayer expense? What planet do you live on?

@BernieSandner @DavidMcAlpine @Garrett_FoxNews @BobMenendezNJ How many days has Trump spent golfing at his own clubs at taxpayer expense? Maybe he could forgo this expense and donate to his pet wall.
@RealJamesWoods What a great corollary. NOT.

@mchinama1 @gehrig38 Lordy. Yup. Change your argument, you certainly have the right to do so. . But still, to my original point, Kim Kardashian made the decision, not "Trump's" DOJ.
@mchinama1 @gehrig38 Is that all you got? Aside from being untrue it's pretty funny that you bring CNN into your argument- that liberal bastion of Trump-hate.
@gehrig38 @mchinama1 Wrong again, Curty. First of all, she wasn't pardoned - she was granted clemency. Second, her three applications for clemency under the Obama administration never reached Obama's desk because DOJ denied. Trump didn't go thru the usual channels, bypassed DOJ.
@mchinama1 @gehrig38 It was actually the DOJ that denied commutation of Ms Johnson's sentence three times.... but Trump preferred to listen to Kim Kardashian's advice instead.

@RicciGeri @TonyBoscoe @Breaking911 But apparently it is a place where brainwashed evangelicals might elect a pedophile....
@BubbaGu95043858 @Breaking911 If you haven't realized this is BS by now....smh. Russia really got to some people, you're one of them I see.
@RicciGeri @TonyBoscoe @Breaking911 If only we had social media back in Clinton's early days, and in Moore's early days. Helps to get the word out. We live in a different day and age. This crap can't be shoved under a rug any longer.
@RicciGeri @TonyBoscoe @Breaking911 Shameful that people will vote for a pedophile. Shameful that many people knew and let it continue.
@RicciGeri @TonyBoscoe @Breaking911 I believe we are beyond statute of limitations, lol. Unless you're hearing of a more recent assault? Wouldn't surprise me in the least. Apparently Moore's penchant for teenaged girls was an open secret.
@WGrrrl @TonyBoscoe @Breaking911 Oooh scary words grrrl.
@BubbaGu95043858 @Breaking911 Five women assaulted. They have nothing to gain by speaking up. But yet you won't believe them. They were teenagers. They didn't take pictures.
@chrislhayes *Former political rival! He can't quit her!
@WGrrrl @TonyBoscoe @Breaking911 Ok I see. If there are no visible marks, rape and assault is ok. Got it.
