@DonaldJTrumpJr Back to your cell, Junior. Daddy doesn’t like you.
@SebGorka @TheJuanWilliams You’re so icky.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Back to your cell, Jr.
@realDonaldTrump If Michael Cohen is a liar and a fraudster, why did you have him working for you for 10 years? Either you are too stupid to realize these things about him or you are also a liar and a fraudster. Obliviously it’s both. Resign!!
@realDonaldTrump Go back to your cell!!
@realDonaldTrump Hey @realdonaldtrump! Jr. Trending ahead of you on Twitter. He’s kind of stealing your spotlight.
@MonicaLewinsky @GeorgeTakei OMG!!! 😂😂🤣😂
@MichaelAvenatti Donald? Is that you? This tweet sounds like you!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Go back to your cell Jr.
@jaredlholt Who?
@mariskreizman @DrJenGunter It’s the first think I look for every morning.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Sellout
@RudyGiuliani Cohen made dangerously shocking accusations about Trump, his children and the Trump organization today. Yet this “lie” is what you choose to focus on? Are we to assume that the rest of his testimony is accurate?
@LindseyGrahamSC What have they done with the real Lindsey Graham? This isn’t you, Sir.
@GOP @LindaSuhler @KellyannePolls Is THAT what you took away from all this?
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 You’re a small, small man. You must feel so weak and powerless when your white privilege can’t  save you anymore.
@RepMarkMeadows Remember today when you cried because a woman of color said using a black woman as a prop was racist? And then remember when you used your black Congressman friend and your nieces and nephews as props to prove you’re not a racist? 🤣🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️
@DonaldJTrumpJr Thank you for pointing out that the Democrats have a token racist.
@Jim_Jordan @DonaldJTrumpJr This is absolutely correct. It’s is also consistent with the type of criminals that Donald J. Trump hires to work for him. Not a good look for Mr. Trump.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Of all the things Mr. Cohen has claimed during his testimony, this is the ONLY statement you claim is a lie? Yet you don’t dispute the crimes committed by you or your father? That speaks volumes.
@LindseyGrahamSC ...at the direction of Individual 1. I fixed it for you.
@March_for_Life @SBAList @LilaGraceRose This is a lie that puts women’s lives in danger. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
@LindseyGrahamSC Where is the real Lindsey Graham?
@CNNnewsroom @KYComer Yes, at the direction of Individual 1.
@thomaskaine5 Absolutely!
@Liz_Wheeler @SenWarren @SenateGOP This doesn’t fucking happen.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Lindsey, are you still in there? This isn’t the real you. What happened?
@LindseyGrahamSC What happened to you??
@JacobAWohl @ILCM_MN I would have done the same thing. You are both assholes.

@KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin Oh Buffy. You make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Are you trying to resurrect your career or something since America forgot about you?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Wtf happened to you? I always respected you and admired you. You are not this person.
@realDonaldTrump We got the same fortune cookie!!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You are a sell out. An embarrassment to the Republican Party and to what the conservative movement stood for before it was hijacked.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Uh oh. You are starting to sound like the old man. Did he write this?🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️
@_SJPeace_ We are who we are. We believe what we believe. Love one another. Be kind. Accept each other. That is all. ❤️
@SenatorCollins Please, Susan. Listen to all the people commenting here and on every other tweet you post. Restore our faith in you. Stand up for what is right as you always promised you would.

@TheRealCDK1 I got the joke and I LOLed.

@BillKristol Thank you, Bill, for standing strong and continuing to be a voice of reason in the Republican Party. You give me hope that one day we can get our party back from the hijackers.
@cvpayne President Obama was never disrespectful to anyone the way Donald Trump was to Jim Acosta. The president serves the people, not the other way around. This never would have happened under Obama because Obama would have answered the questions being asked.
@RogueNASA @Acosta Yes!!! This!!!
@aditinadkarni @HuffPost Yes but Bridget Jones wasn’t actually plus size.
@SenatorCollins Still pretending to care about other human beings? You already showed the world who you are. Just stop. You no longer have any credibility.
@SenatorCollins @AmDiabetesAssn @JDRF Nothing you say has meaning anymore. You abandoned your principals and your supporters when you voted for an anti-choice, anti-woman, raging angry man to a lifetime seat on our highest court. You broke the hearts of women like me who have supported you for decades.
@GeorgeTakei Thank you for saying this!! You are so right and it gives us all hope!!
@Liz_Wheeler @KatrinaPierson Sadly the Republican Party has been hijacked and is no longer recognizable as the great part it once was.

@PhilipRucker @senorrinhatch Isn’t it ironic? Don’t ya think?
@vinnyflood @JonahNRO Why is everyone on Twitter being so nasty? When did nationwide bullying by adults become acceptable? Maybe this is why we have such a problem with mental illness in this country.
