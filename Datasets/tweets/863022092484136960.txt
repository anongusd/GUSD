@EBrooksUncut @EricHovde Excellent question. And why the delay? And why lie to the AP while actively hiring staff? How does this put the best face forward for something like this or gain the trust of folks? Don't get it. But I know who HAS been working all these years and campaigning all these months.
@EBrooksUncut @EricHovde Totally respect that assessment. The opportunism thing is big - if you only show up when you think you can buy a seat, how can people trust you? What's he done to help the cause aside from that lately? And in the end is a 3 way primary helpful in pushing Tammy out?
@EBrooksUncut @EricHovde That's exactly the concern I have as well. Honestly, not sure he has even been in Wisconsin. And certainly not successfully implementing conservative reforms the way Leah has. She's been on the front lines. Of course better than Nicholson- but have same opportunism concern.
