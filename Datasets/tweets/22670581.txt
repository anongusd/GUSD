@justtroolian @DStewart541 @politiCOHEN_ @aliasvaughn I believe these are for trial. Normally you’d call the prosecutor and or defense attorneys office ( whichever has subpoenaed you) the day of and they would tell you date and time you are needed. Generally the first 2-3 days of trial are to pick a jury. .....

@aliasvaughn No you’re not reading it right. I’m on your side, but seriously we deal with so much disinformation. Let’s stick to the facts. He asked for 35 sets, an original and a copy. For 35 different people or entities. So yes, technically 70 pages but not 70 different people
@cornell_wallace Do they even live in the same house? Ya know, you see the "house divided" placards and car tags, usually for college football teams. But this house takes it to another level. Maybe Kellyanne is a snitch and has been wearing the wire?!?!
@politiCOHEN_ @aliasvaughn This is an incredible amount of subpoena's but we have enough untruths. I'd rather stick to the facts;-)
