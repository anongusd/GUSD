@1murman1 you're getting off topic anyway. Tell me why a mentally unstable person who is talking abt retribution shld have a gun.
@1murman1 of a gun, other than sport, that don't include killing or injuring.
@1murman1 other than sport, the only use for a gun is to kill or injure. 100s of other uses? You say argue facts not fantasy. Name 10 uses
@1murman1 someone who is mentally unstable. Ok I apologize for cluttering your TL. We can agree to disagree. Thanks for the discussion.
@1murman1 giffords shooting, columbine, Newtown, dc sniper, etc, etc all involved mentally ill people. Felons can't own a gun, why should
@1murman1 this is typical. If you don't agree with someone attempt to attack them personally. I'll be taking a logic course next semester
@1murman1 are you claiming that a significant number of guns are sold for Olympic competition? Really?
@1murman1 so what are guns made for? Other than to kill or harm someone or something?

@Brickhouse143 @Peggynoonannyc. Its not the mask that's the problem. Its "who wants to see BO run down by a bull"
@morgenr that doesn't really compare to suggesting violence against POTUS "who wants to see Obama run down by a bull". Line crossed.
Does anyone remember republican reaction to the dixie chicks criticising of GWB?@DRUDGE_REPORT
I wonder how this congressman felt when the dixie chicks criticized Bush?@briefingroom
Yes because suggesting violence against POTUS (run down by a bull) is acceptable to GOP bcuz they can't win WH@RichardGrenell @whpresscorps
@aprilsidea maybe you missed GWBs reaction to the dixie chicks and they weren't even suggesting violence against POTUS like this clown

@ClayFullick republicans: get government out of our lives... oh unless its a woman's vagina
@DarrellIssa the GOP has the same problem. It can't look regular(not rich) Americans in the eye and say they're looking out for them.
@SpeakerBoehner you people created this recession  and now you want to take food from those effected by it. Pass a jobs bill #legislate
@McConnellPress gop can not take food from 2 million poor Americans and simultaneously  say they care about poor people. #Partyoftherich
@DarrellIssa war on coal has to be better than your partys war on poor Americans #partyofrichpeople
@SpeakerBoehner poor Americans need to eat but that didn't stop you from trying to deprive 2 million of them from eating. #Partyofrichpeople
@GOPLeader more like the GOP will continue its war on poor families in America. Your farm bill would leave 2 million hungry #partyoftherich
@DarrellIssa about 90% of Americans have a negative view of congress of which you are a member #doyourjob #legislate

@DarrellIssa As a member of the majority aren't you ashamed of your partys inability to do anything productive? Jobs bill? #legislate
@Reince Reckless spending? It will be generations that will be paying TRILLIONS  for Bushs lies about WMD in Iraq. #Bushwasworse
@GOP BUSH &amp; CHENEY murdered 4000+ American  soldiers  by lieing to us about WMD in Iraq. The GOP is the party of white america.
@hardball  @hardballchris  who voted to send weapons to syria? We elected Pres. Obama to make these decisions. We gave POTUS the power.
@GOPLeader what does this majority ever accomplish? You can pass bills to take food from kids mouth but can't pass a jobs bill #legislat
