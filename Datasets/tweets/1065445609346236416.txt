@yogioabs @IISuperwomanII facts are important not feelings! Multi-varied analysis shows that gender pay gap doesn't exists ! These feminists don't understand economics! People make rational choices! there is a book called 'why men earn more' by @drwarrenfarrell Any competent economist will agree!
@RationalMale Companies collapse under female leadership! End Corporate feminism! Period! @RationalMale
@yogioabs "I don't need a man except for children"- Priyanka Chopra (Feminist)	"I don't need a woman except for sex"- Me 	Fair enough? Read https://t.co/TNkrjHiAU2
@AnuMathur19 Oh God! Gimme a break! 🤨
@katiet121 Like the immortal Dave Chappelle once said "Chivalry is dead and Women KILLED it" No matter what a man does! This society, government and women are gonna keep shaming men are like the butts of jokes and the media constantly portrays them as buffoons and bumbling idiots. Thanks!
RT @Rich_Cooper: Toxic feminism wants more women CEOs via gender quotas, but no push for more women in these roles. https://t.co/UcONqQ7oEa
@AnuMathur19 Women should start teaching their daughters more about 'RESPONSIBILITIES' than 'RIGHTS'. Period!
RT @yogioabs: If you want to make the men’s movement cool in 2019 like and retweet this
@RebekahWorsham Breck!  Lemme ask you a question. Is it true?
@katiet121 @TuckerCarlson No matter what you say! Cathy Areu is a man in disguise! Take a look at her! I'm really enjoying the bromance betwen Tucker and Cathy! Ask babies for consent before changing diapers? I'm sure her mom passed out while changing her diapers!
@katiet121 Why am I not noticing the gun strapped around your waist but something else? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔Anyway appreciate that nice "SOMETHING"
@katiet121 I was watching George W's eulogy too! But I woke up with a dream today, Where I sung for my own funeral..!!!!! #confused #nightmare That is so heart wrenching too ☹️☹️☹️☹️😔😔😔😔😔😳😳

@Rich_Cooper Rich! You're damn right! Honestly they're not capable of studying STEM courses! They're not competent enough! Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics are highest paying jobs! These post secondary education is total crap!
@katiet121 @katiet121  It's good not to share ones credit score until it's a date!
@katiet121 @katiet121 then let's get married! But first we'll rob a bank and then we'll go to Mexico! then we'll have babies ! but we're gonna name their last name as Bacons! You know? Family of 'BACONS' I love it 🙌
@katiet121 @katiet121 Yes ? No? Asshole? Dick? Douche? Say something!
@katiet121 @katiet121 I'll come to your house with my bacons. What do you say? I'm sure you would like anything that involves 'BACONS' I've got a lot of it! How about that?
@katiet121 @katiet121 Bring home the bacon means to make a living, to earn money, to achieve financial support for those at home. Some believe that the idiom bring home the bacon came from a tradition in Great Dunmow, Essex, England since 1100's ! Offensive to vegans? Fuck off!
@KatiePavlich @KatiePavlich What's holding women back? Women's feelings hold them back! They don't process their logic and reason. They process their emotions! You can't speak logic to a woman! They all wanna be like a man!
@katiet121 @katiet121 Oh God ! Somebody please tell him to strip down his pants and prove it to me that he is not a woman! Then I'll buy your freaking products !!!! When I hear these words hate, division and offense then I'm sure that the person is not a dude! 😝😝😝😝😝😝
@katiet121 @katiet121 Canada need to realize that they have a 'female' prime minister for the first time in history who happens to be Justin Trudeau! the guy doesn't have a dick!  he's gotta pussy! Canadians need to realize that!
@JessicaValenti @RoamingMil Woman have always been beauty objects to men and Men have always been success objects to women! If you think it's your body and it's your choice then you can go and eat your own pussy. You're not entitled to a man's money! Period!

@RationalMale @Rich_Cooper @yogioabs @Rich_Cooper @yogioabs @RationalMale The real test for a man is how he lives with himself, alone. Precious few men ever truly allow themselves to be alone and learn real independence and self-reliance. Wow! Rollo you keep nailing it !!!! 😎
@Rich_Cooper @RationalMale @yogioabs @Rich_Cooper True ! A woman advised me not to take your advice seriously! but I told her it is a wise thing to learn from other people's mistakes you can never live long enough to make them all yourself! Then she started yelling at me like you're gonna die alone! why?
@Rich_Cooper @RationalMale  @yogioabs  Check this out! 5 Scientific reasons why women love fat guys as a product of evolution ! LOL 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣Monogamous body? https://t.co/fCv7jrlJah
@Rich_Cooper @yogioabs @AMYoungster @YouTube @Rich_Cooper @yogioabs Thanks! That's true! Just finished reading @RationalMale the rational male! Now they recently published a crap study which shows women are attracted to fat and chubby guys not muscles! I'm getting tired of this bullshit! Fat guys as a product of evolution?
@yogioabs @BrattyIlenia @yogioabs SAVAGE LEVEL 100% Let's report the attention seeking whores!!!!! 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
@yogioabs @AMYoungster @Rich_Cooper @YouTube @yogioabs You're right but the misrepresentation started in between Avocados &amp; Bananas? LOL 😂🤣 No disrespect but she picked up a very bad narrative to explain the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. And she is from Boston! I t.h.o.t so!
@yogioabs @AMYoungster @Rich_Cooper Yogi &amp; Rich Please do a review on this video I just can't stop laughing man! She seems so sad! "What stops you from attracting a good man"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/sXO4tNxuYn via @YouTube
@jerryliufilms @yogioabs @Rich_Cooper "It's really funny when I hear feminists saying that they don't need men but they have 50 percent of their father's DNA and don't understand the patterns of inheritance but only have patterns of ignorance" 🤨

@yogioabs  "A Bachelor of Arts is a man who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor" 	-Helen Rowland (bachelor girl) LOL 😂😂 😂😂
@yogioabs @SandmanMGTOW @masteryquotes @yogioabs Don't rush to form an opinion just watch the documentary and let me know! I never disagree with what you say but before that just take your time! Cause I was thinking the same as you did!
@yogioabs @SandmanMGTOW @yogioabs Check out the documentary about Nkola Tesla and his inventions and then you'll understand why he said that! Including Sir.Isaac Newton! There is a difference in their level of accomplishments!
@SandmanMGTOW @jerryliufilms @yogioabs "A bachelor is a man who never makes the same mistake once."		– Ed Wynn
@SandmanMGTOW  @yogioabs "I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men"	- Nikola Tesla (the man himself who created the 20th century)
@SandmanMGTOW  @yogioabs  "Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried, or childless men."		– Francis Bacon
@SandmanMGTOW MGTOW is not a 'safe choice'. It is a 'Lifestyle choice'. There are no levels in MGTOW ! There is 'ONE LEVEL' that is reaching your own level of growth and self-worth. It is not just about going your own way; It is also about growing your own way! It's about YOU!
