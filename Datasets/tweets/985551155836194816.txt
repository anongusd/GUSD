@senatemajldr Well how about mothers
@carlreiner President Day is for our past presidents
@tribelaw Or could take over steel mills,or vaccinate you children or take guns away
Presidents at War.  Great documentary about the men who would be president and there in world War 2.  Wow.
@amvetsupport @realDonaldTrump Now FDR or Kennedy they were greats
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends What are you talking about.  You are investigated, be glad it is not Herbert Hoover after you. You would really freak then
@senatemajldr And far right
@senatemajldr That applies to the republican side to you idiot
@LilleyDennese I know.  I got coworkers that are quitting, so it is sad
@LilleyDennese Lord that man is an idiot.  Yup we are ready.  Cause he will stomp his feet and shut us down.
@BlueWaveCS Wrong on so many levels
@LilleyDennese Oh dear.  I am sorry to hear that.  Block the bastard and report him
@leeleeb50 For me it does.  My husband has some Native American and does not claim it 3 generations back.
@senatemajldr Well what is you plan.  That is right you do not have one.
@LilleyDennese But Trump lovers say we hate him how sad
@senatemajldr Well you might come talk with a real America
RT @ShelbyKStewart: Even if you don't care about the #NationalButterflyCenter which you should, seizing land is illegal, a power grab of ep…
@senatemajldr @SenSasse How about protecting mothers rights to be health
@senatemajldr Paying people, and not having government shutdowns would help
@BarbraStreisand @2010CGW This is very sad.
@senatemajldr Well let’s see, day off so people can vote is a good thing
@senatemajldr End the shutdown and balance the budget.
@JMyers1971 Vintage
@realDonaldTrump Take the tweet button from him
@senatemajldr Turned out to be 3 weeks.
@senatemajldr Well as usual it was all talk
@senatemajldr Shut up.  You are not putting any bills forward.  We the people suffer
@essenviews What the fuck
@realDonaldTrump We will not eat, and we will lose our home etc
@B52Malmet @ccharlamb8 Not a good idea to not pay people who do not pay you.
@Brasilmagic But no veterans, sad and shameful
@essenviews But not the veterans
@Trumper1620 Nope the buck stops here, mr president.  That what truman said
@RepMarkMeadows Well maybe you should offer to open the government and fund it for one year
This is madness to try to make a point on the back of the American federal worker.  Write call and tweet to government officials and let them know how you feel
@essenviews Your wife and children first.  Oh and you too,anchor baby
@essenviews What.
@ChrisAn89178874 Love working the weekend no management staff.
@Kris_Sacrebleu @Defeat_Trump2 Good try on mom’s part.  She was very luck that some Vietnam veterans were not there.
@stonecold2050 @leeleeb50 Share.  Then hold him by his ear
@leeleeb50 Well I doubt that Christian folks would leave their bible or rosary so I doubt a prayer rug would be left by the hundreds
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Sigh, stop the posturing.  You complained non stop about president b. Obama.  Now get to work and pass the budget.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should stay home and honor living veterans by passing the budget, with out all the hupla.
@krassenstein Still say he should have turned said I am from Utah fool
@lisamurkowski Recess my ass.  I am not getting paid, so stay at work
@bonnie314 @essenviews Lol
@essenviews Based on what skill
@essenviews Lol, that is a dumb comment on his part.  I was taught from early childhood to mistrust the Russian bear
@krassenstein @LilleyDennese Very sad isn’t it.  Feels like when we elected Kennedy
If you follow me, do not message me and tell me you want to talk and I am beautiful I will block you.  This is not my date site
@RepAOC @leeleeb50 I may be against the wall, but I want to eat
@amvetsupport Maybe we should make military a requirement
@ladygaga Beautiful as ever
@s_schuckman @SheriBentsen @realDonaldTrump No emergency’s here in Arkansas
@siano2020 Yes, but not for some idiots
@TomthunkitsMind Along with war veterans
@amvetsupport Plus he did not serve in the military
@ItsJeffHudson Nope, but my family is unique and interesting
So a cop is killed in the line of duty and the president tweeted that he needs a wall.  Shut up already and state our hearts go out to this man’s family and work family
RT @ChelseaClinton: Please leave Barron Trump out of “jokes” &amp; analyses. He’s a kid and private citizen and deserves to be left alone. Than…
@ChelseaClinton @katgal2 I like this, leave the child out of it
@amvetsupport Where are all those supports, now that he hands his coat to a military person.  Or the religious now that he can not recite the creed
@EdKrassen Why we need to walk up to living people and get their help and notify Walmart that we want this
@jordanwfisher_ @senatemajldr Wish I could say nope do not want to be investigated and it would all be wiped away.
@leeleeb50 Lol I thought for moment you meant the instrument
@essenviews Well of course every one supports a good hanging, sigh
Dear Lord please no https://t.co/lTA0nP2XXD
Yes https://t.co/Jqzrn5qYIX
Why would you go to an island where the natives do not want you.  Knowing if they were exposed to you most would die just so you can tell them about Jesus.  Hello Jesus, I told this tribe about you and then they died.  But they know your name.
@essenviews Used to be you were expected to live the life.  Not just mouth it.
@LilleyDennese Well what do we expect from those idiots.  We need the draft for everyone under 40, along with peace corps as a choice.  Hehe teaches us about the world, no isolation in the service
@MKGenest Lol, also known as idiots
Ugh, trying to explain to an idiot, about the 3 branches of government.  Now I am drinking beer and muttering.  Dumb jackass
Well not a good idea.  To arrest the senator on the rotunda.  She needs to have a bit of bonding with the commissioner and union president with several sweet comments about funding and then a sad sight, love to help you but https://t.co/8eIYbcDVOw
@LilleyDennese So true.  Push for the next 4 years and get his but out of office and in jail
Wish I could say that https://t.co/7z3Ke88JFg
Just grin and go well us marine Corp is where I am from.  Where are you from lady https://t.co/VHJWr2mhzv
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone.  Be safe, be with family and friends
@maydaymindy9 Had an outdoor toilet, give me trump.  He will be missing when I finish
Nurses, doctors, farmers, parents https://t.co/Pn6qqpx4H3
My first tweet:  time for the public to be active and get rid of dead wood.  Go to our church’s and tell get out of Trumps pants
You can not even serve due to bunions and the criticism for those who do is crazy https://t.co/x99SmGn9rm
@LilleyDennese Knowing that old fool yes
@_SJPeace_ @LilleyDennese Just run into him with a shopping cart
@LilleyDennese Lol, no just give me one weekend not hearing the mouth
RT @brycetache: WHEN did it become ok for politicians to joke about lynching and voter suppression?
What a mess https://t.co/j6NBb0FlTf
