@whazittoya @Karoli @MEPFuller I can see the appeal of term limits as a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to the miscreants, but it is myopic, if you look at it from the other POV. We *could* address that &amp; more, more effectively, w/true reform of campaign finance, better recruitment &amp; civic education, less apathy.
@jumbo747pilot Thanks for the explanation. I‚Äôve seen military planes do these (Dad was in USAF), but not civilian aircraft. It looks like a ballet move, when they touch and go up again. This perspective is very informative.
@jumbo747pilot @indoguju Many years ago, I flew the day after a plane (in Dallas, I think) reportedly crashed bc of cross wind gusts. It was still very windy &amp; I was very edgy, but my flight was fine, much better than some I‚Äôve had.

@Scarletpxi1 @darkenedsea @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction Btw: VAERS staff follows up on reports (which are voluntary by individuals), but as they clearly state, they do not change the report (even if it turns out the cause was not related to the vaccine.  That‚Äôs important. (Not on your website.)

@darkenedsea @Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction While avoiding any proper research of applicable scientific information, like what VAERS actually is, what reports *actually* entail, &amp; what they mean to convey.
@darkenedsea @Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction It‚Äôs much easier to quote a website run by an organization who lies about its intentions, &amp; makes money off of calling itself a charity so they don‚Äôt have to pay taxes, but  takes donations from people they endanger.

@Scarletpxi1 @darkenedsea @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction How would you know? Have you looked that up on VAERS yourself?

@Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction If you want to tour a ‚Äúgovernment run‚Äù website, then at least be honest &amp; look at one. You are clearly advocating something else entirely.
@Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction The website you touted *claims to present neutral info, but makes money off of pushing a biased, anti-vaxxer stance. If they aren‚Äôt honest about that, why would you trust them to give you medical advice about your child?
@Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction The website you quoted is not what you claimed, the org. makes money from spewing anti-vaccine crap. They say they they want to give ‚Äúindependent‚Äù information, but promote only anti-vaxxing. That tells you who they are, &amp; why you shouldn‚Äôt trust them to give unbiased info.

@SurfCityWriter @fordm That reminded me of the other part of this ‚Äî where the hell were the many other ppl that saw/laid hands on this yrbk before publication? Thought you‚Äôd like this thread. I think it gives some better nuance. https://t.co/zZOnaUbPFc
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I daresay I have seen so many things that I found disturbing, but I couldn‚Äôt swear I  remember all of them, or the faces of the ppl involved. Some, sure. All? Maybe. Someone I knew well/trusted? Probably (in part because I‚Äôd be done w/them after blackface).
@SurfCityWriter @fordm His post sounded like these things would‚Äôve happened at the same time. (Blackface, yearbook publication, &amp; graduation.) We don‚Äôt know when the yearbook came out, but I was saying that afterward, he‚Äôd be more focused on medicine &amp; moving forward, not what pics he took, if he did.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I worry that if a picture can derail a career decades later, who will we ever be able to trust? Bc pictures can be manipulated by anyone now. Will it mean that you have to decide as a child that you‚Äôre going to be a politician &amp; remain blemish-free? How is that possible?
@SurfCityWriter @fordm We‚Äôve had a lot of discussions over the last few yrs about our attitudes &amp; actions &amp; how we‚Äôve changed/evolved. Beyond this, &amp; in light of the cameraphones everywhere era, I am interested in how we are going to handle pictures coming back to haunt years later.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm And from the GOP responses, I think it‚Äôs obvious they see it as a ‚Äúwin.‚Äù  I think it‚Äôs awful &amp; I  don‚Äôt see how he survives it.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm Fact is, we don‚Äôt know what happened, or why, or wth made anyone think this was a good idea. I always wonder, when this stuff happens, what the motivation is behind such a revelation. I think that‚Äôs prudent, overall.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm When I saw this, my thought (after wth??) was whether someone on the yearbook staff had inserted a tasteless ‚Äújoke‚Äù as a dig at him. I worked at a med school in the early 80s, &amp; I could imagine that kind of bad idea being thought of as ‚Äúfunny‚Äù by some of those guys.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I was often concerned about how some people‚Äôs actions seemed to be deliberately designed to make matters worse, not better, &amp; their motives for doing so.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I knew, and a lot of other people knew, that we‚Äôd never be caught dead wearing such a get-up. But I lived with &amp; around marginalized people my whole life. I was very sensitive to race issues.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm Worse, that it would make *them* seem racist. (A kind of compartmentalization often occurs around this.)
@SurfCityWriter @fordm So, while they (whoever is in the costume)  might have thought it was a stupid, even insulting ‚Äújoke,‚Äù they (depending on their local experiences), might not have appreciated the real, hurtful way it would be felt to be racist, or
@SurfCityWriter @fordm And even in the case where white people might have found it offensive, they wouldn‚Äôt have necessarily said anything to the offenders. The routine racism I saw informs my beliefs about that.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I don‚Äôt know whether it was unsurprising in the area where Northam was, or whether this was an aberration. I just don‚Äôt think it was universally considered surprising/repugnant/offensive to white people.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm Btw: when I said ‚Äúheard about,‚Äù I mean ‚Äúheard about someone facing consequences for it.‚Äù Bc I guarantee it happened a lot more than the times it made the news.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I think it‚Äôs possible that those stories you mentioned (besides the political ones, bc that‚Äôs about politics) were ‚Äúin the news‚Äù because they were rarely heard about. There were still a lot of places where there would have been more a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù reaction.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm For context, In 1984, probably most of the men I served with still thought it was okay to sexually harass women they worked with. Some said women ‚Äúdeserved it‚Äù for daring to join. Others disagreed, though remained quiet about it.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I don‚Äôt think that should be surprising, given what we‚Äôve seen even over the last decade, of people **still** doing it, &amp; still acting like it doesn‚Äôt matter.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm In 1984, those stories being in the news might have been memorable, but there were still a lot of places where someone dressing up like that might have been laughed at ‚Äî even nervously ‚Äî but many others around them wouldn‚Äôt have called them out.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I remember the incident you referred to in Quincy, MA, because I was stationed not far from there at the time; so I hadn‚Äôt realized it was a national story.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm In 1984, I was in the Army. Reagan was President. I remember hearing a Senator on tv say that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want our women coming home in body bags.‚Äù (They we‚Äôre discussing why women shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to serve in combat roles, even if they wanted to.)
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I am old enough to remember a lot of things, including ‚Äúwhites only‚Äù water fountains, school bussing, &amp; lots of ‚Äúroutine‚Äù racist comments &amp; actions ‚Äî where people that should have known better &amp; been better ‚Äî didn‚Äôt object.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I‚Äôve never even though about wearing blackface ‚Äî the idea horrifies me. I heard old family members talk about the ‚Äúgood‚Äù intentions of the old Klan. Even as a young child, it sounded like crap to me.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I‚Äôm originally from Memphis, Tennessee. My parents were sharecroppers. I grew up as an Air Force brat, moving in and out of the deep south, between one more diverse community to much more acrimoniously racist communities.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I‚Äôm unclear what you think we disagree about?

@greta And I appreciate you trying to focus the unfocused on the underlying issue of the arrest &amp; trying to clarify what should be obvious, even as you are hounded by people for other reasons, or their own purposes. Take care, Greta.
@greta But I respect that you have tried to clairfiy what you mean, &amp; that CNN could have gotten the scoop thru good  investigative work. Maybe ppl who are still  free press supporters are chaffed at any read that tips = illegal, even if that is supposition.
@greta Bc I respect your usual clarity, I was surprised by your initial post. I think you should have expected the RW to pounce on it,  even use it while ignoring your subsequent clarifying posts. These days, it‚Äôs  easy to read it as critical of CNN for doing an appropriate, good job.

@MarkSLong2 @uzererr @greta @CNN You‚Äôd rather? This is why you‚Äôre not a journalist. Because a journalist does their homework. They knew the grand jury was meeting Thursday, and they staked out his house. Stone himself said he expected to be arrested. Greta used to be better than this.

@RickDoyle @Castantine @JohnnyGWeir They, &amp; the public, are left with unanswered, &amp; unanswerable questions. I sympathize with them.

@RickDoyle @Castantine @JohnnyGWeir He was apparently represented by an attorney, &amp; I would‚Äôve expected them to raise the issue of venue, if he felt SafeSport was acting outside their purview, or if he had not been given an opportunity 2 defend himself before the investigation was complete. Wouldn‚Äôt you? 4/
@RickDoyle @Castantine @JohnnyGWeir In this case, it appears he chose (but was not obligated) to talk about the claims, but unless I missed it, it didn‚Äôt look like he was saying they were not the appropriately-designated entity 2 conduct an investigation. 3/

@RickDoyle @JohnnyGWeir Any org. charged with investigating is going to be looking into the actions of someone that is liked by aomeone. When to realease information (early or later), and how much to release, is difficult to balance. No org. would satisfy everyone. Only hindsight is perfect.

@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC I know some ‚Äúevangelicals‚Äù that feel the same way.  But they knew who he was. No one mistook him for a Christian. Some won‚Äôt speak up. A few do. When it‚Äôs all over, I think a lot will claim their hands were clean.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC That‚Äôs been especially hurtful to some vets, like me, to see fellow vets embrace him. Utterly devoid of honor, integrity, our ‚Äúcode.‚Äù Never leave a buddy behind. Never betray one. Or a POW. Or a GS family. It‚Äôs the worst you can be. The worst.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC Like fake patriots, embracing a man that spits on vets, spits on female vets, POWs, Gold Star families. Even if you could ‚Äúget‚Äù being against the Vietnam war, as a lot of ppl were, DJT is the other end of the spectrum. He didn‚Äôt oppose *it*, just *him*  going to fight it.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC I just can‚Äôt abide the ludicrous hypocrisy. I remember reading about white people, like pastors, who marched, registered ppl to vote, often putting their own lives//reps/fortunes on the line. Where were they when racists attacks on Obama were *everywhere*?
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC They outed themselves, then had a fit when people noticed the distinctly racist flavor of theirs shrieks. The overlapping ‚Äúevangelicals‚Äù were kicking Boy Scouts out of their churches for accepting gay kids. But not a word on racism &amp; $$ spent on wars ad nauseum.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC Then, they show up with pics of Obama as a witch doctor, with a bone through his nose. Or him as a Nazi. Or a monkey. It‚Äôs permanently imprinted on my brain. So, so telling though.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC I guess I‚Äôm reluctant to buy into the idea they were duped. Certainly not when the tea party showed up. If they didn‚Äôt see it before, that was a clue. Remember how they said they were all about the ‚Äúfiscal accountability,‚Äù not really into social issues?
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC Sorry, I see you were referring to my statement. I don‚Äôt think they were duped. They were still happy to hang on when the clown car left the road. They chose that. Resisted the signs &amp; alarms. Too few of them bailed after seeing the light.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC I don‚Äôt give much credit to the guys that now say they were duped. They knew, or should have known. The same guys blame their wives for their own bad behavior. The women blame other women that don‚Äôt share their views. They preach responsibility, except when it matters.

Drives me nuts.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC But even I‚Äôve been somewhat surprised. And no one seems to want Fox News on the TV in the waiting room. Ha!  I should say that I‚Äôm almost always surrounded by vets older than I am, &amp; almost all male. So, not a scientific survey, by any means.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC Btw: a surprising number of convos at the VA have been about this very thing. I‚Äôve had some surprises, tho I‚Äôve always known that not all vets were Republicans, as some believe. We are not a solid bloc.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC What used to be called ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù looks different from the other side of the looking glass.  		Deep down, I think they still recognize what they see. But can‚Äôt save face *now* &amp; admit that. 		That‚Äôs my most generous read, at least. But still awful. üòû
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC There‚Äôs probably been several different reasons, lots of ‚Äúwtf‚Äù moments, for some of these folks. But at some point they realized they were so far in, there  was no way out. They **needed** the next step &amp; the money to get there. They can be ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù by redefining it.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC It‚Äôs like they were being served bigger portions of more powerful drugs, and they felt invincible. And then Trump showed up. They all did a double take, then laughed. The Tea Party became ‚ÄúFreedom Caucus.‚Äù But the hook was set. By then, they‚Äôd sold their soul for the drug.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC With the FRC, the NRA, the Bishops &amp; Baptist Convention &amp; all of the propagandists of Fox &amp; talk radio pushing the message like it came from God himself, it was easy to slide by, with little to no actual accomplishments. It was too easy. So they got cocky.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC It was so easy for them, in part, to believe that bc they‚Äôd gotten by for so long w/o having to show *any* real work for quite some time. Just mention ‚Äúmorality,‚Äù ‚Äúthe unborn,‚Äù or ‚Äúprotect ourselves,‚Äù &amp; ppl ‚Äúforgot‚Äù they didn‚Äôt actually DO things.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC At the height of their conceit, they really did think they‚Äôd be the sole survivors. They believed they could outsmart others, suck up the money (NRA), &amp; continue to get by, doing nothing to rein in  the evil.

@freeandclear1 @7bestoftimes @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Are you talking about this race for the Dem. caucus leader? Do any members of the caucus fit that description? Offhand, I can‚Äôt think of any members who are disabled, except for Sen. Tammy Duckworth. I‚Äôm sure there are others, but this is the House we‚Äôre talking about.
@7bestoftimes @freeandclear1 @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Being empathetic and compassionate is great, but does not necessarily fulfill the needs of a leadership role. When did we start playing the ‚Äústay in your (old) lane‚Äù as the ‚Äúidentity politics‚Äù we‚Äôre okay with?
@7bestoftimes @freeandclear1 @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier So bc you ‚Äúno longer need to lead,‚Äù you think a blanket hand-off should be enforced. You completely disregard any possibility that younger, less-experienced ppl are right for all leadership roles? Curious at what age would u cut them off? What is ‚Äúold‚Äù to you?
@freeandclear1 @7bestoftimes @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Knowing what we know, I think it is ridiculously silly to ignore that ageism and sexism are still alive well, as is just discounting that it might have been an influence. Blasting ‚Äúold people‚Äù for wanting to use their earned &amp; valuable experience makes no sense.
@freeandclear1 @7bestoftimes @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Not sure about that, but she seems to be saying that because he‚Äôs younger, the right candidate won. So now we‚Äôre advocating for older women to be sidelined, simply because they have stuck around, gaining experience and expertise, despite all the obstacles. Seems nuts &amp; spiteful.
@7bestoftimes @scottwongDC @RepSpeier You saw him on TV, and he was ‚Äúmost impressive,‚Äù you say. But you don‚Äôt know what went on behind closed doors in the vote, which is what she‚Äôs addressing. FYI, we‚Äôre taking about the Dem. caucus, not the youth league. Experience matters. A lot.
