If your street credit is more important than your financial credit then we are NOT the same
Im so sick of everyones fucking bitching about equality online when in fact most arent doing shit for the betterment of man kind how many of you motherfuckers are helping the homeless or immigrants or are you too busy figuring out what selfie your going to post
You guys are taking this Larry Baer situation way overboard he did nothing wrong in my eyes he forcefully took a phone away did not shove or hit her she threw herself in dramatic fashion her screaming was over the top too
I look back on being a youngster and we we’re really kicking it with OGs and people twice our age some days you might have to fight a full grown man other days you might be putting in work with one but you learned to respect your older heads
Everyone wants to be gangster but no one wants to put in work
Broke ass boy always asking for a hand out if your really trapping let me see you bust some bands out
If you ain’t got no blue strips we share no connection
I don’t trust because as long as I keep that in mind I can’t be disappointed the moment you let your guard down you allow someone to take advantage of your kindness I don’t need none in any type of way so keep that in mind when you think for  a moment that I care if your here
Catch a case don’t snitch that’s mandatory
It’s a struggle in the barrio
Nothing’s free if you pay attention
Nobody owes you shit in this world even the people who you were loyal too it should be a given but not everybody moves with principles and morals with that being said move on and do you don’t lose yourself improve yourself
I don’t got to be in the hood everyday the hood only excite the motherfuckers who ain’t grow up in it
My body full of them gang related tattoos
Sex don’t make you thick a man that makes sure your eating good and stress free does
Cardi B makes music for women who think collecting child support is making money moves
I lost my ride or die bitch you don’t know about love
People grow every day nothing wrong with that nobody stays the same forever unless they are ignorant and intolerant to change in their life the shit you go through molds you into someone with a different mindset and that's both okay and important for our survival
Hanging out with people that have no ambition or people that are not productive gives me anxiety like a motherfucker
I don’t give a fuck what you say that girl did not deserve a scholarship
That girl played 3 games in two seasons and had 3 tackles she’s 5’6 135lbs going head to head with grown men call it what you want it’s a good publicity stunt for the college
Getting pregnant by two motherfuckers in a row who don’t want your ass should lower your credit score
@leslliez @fatshitalex Lies
Hate it if you want to love if you must
So Chino Grande done bumped his head on his bible and wants to make music with Norteños that’s some funny ass shit
@NewEraCap @WWE Wtf man restock I missed out
