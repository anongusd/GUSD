Here's a Loyalty Map from 2002 to 2010 for Florida Governor. In 2002, @JebBush crushed Bill McBride. Yet, in 2010, @SenRickScott beat Alex Sink narrowly. It's so weird to see the change in Northwest Florida from the Early 2000s to now.		#ElectionTwitter #Florida #Election #Dems https://t.co/FBrgKHrZJ5
So, sorry for not posting the results earlier. On the 24th of February, 2019, Cuba chose to have a new Constitution. It passed with a very large margin.		Yes on New: 90.61%	No on New: 9.39%		A step towards Democracy, this is great.		#ElectionTwitter #Cuba #Election #Referendum
@MattMelendrez2 There is so much more that goes into tennis that hitting a ball
@MattMelendrez2 It is, but ok
Here is a 2004-2016 Washington Governor Loyalty Map. In 2004, Christine Gregoire won extremely narrowly over @DinoRossiWA . In 2016, @JayInslee won easily over his Republican Challenger Bill Bryant.		#ElectionTwitter #Washington #GovernorElection #Democrats #Republican #JayInslee https://t.co/3feOXOsfDR
This is actually really interesting. @BernieSanders doing this well in a Southern state is just...weird.		#Election2020 #Democrats #ElectionTwitter #TwitterGovernment #BernieSanders #JoeBiden #SouthCarolina #Primary https://t.co/ARX2wzF418
@daveweigel I kind of like it...
We've got an update in our 2020 Democratic Primary. @JayInslee announced his candidacy today. We've added him to the lower tier.

@CBCNews Should be expect the Greens to perform well anywhere else?
@CBCNews When do you expect to project Outremont?
@CBCNews Which Party has invested the most resources into Burnaby South? I haven’t seen enough info to know.
York going strong for the Conservatives. Outremont going big for Liberals, so far.
Live Results for All 3 Ridings:		Burnaby South: https://t.co/AiEEDtKs3f		Outremont: https://t.co/LQEy753AOk		York-Simcoe: https://t.co/2iEcMUfDe2
Tonight's Burnaby-South, Outremont, and York-Simcoe, are going to be crucial to the Liberals and NDP. If the NDP wins in Burnaby-South, it's great news for them. If they lose, it's a sign that the NDP will most likely lose in October.		#ElectionTwitter #Canada #BurnabySouth #NDP https://t.co/3lNSyuyVos

The referendum in Cuba today will be really interesting in my opinion. They're voting on a whole new Constitution, moving towards Democracy and Freedom. 		#Cuba #TwitterElection #ElectionTwitter #Referendum #Democracy #CubaReferendum #Election #Freedom https://t.co/E4RFhLnh92
@IAStartingLine Used to like in Ames. interesting fact, the Sister City of Ames is Koshu City, Japan
We have an update in the Upper Tier of our 2020 Tracker! @BernieSanders announced his run for President yesterday, further expanding the field of candidates.

Here is a 2013-2017 Virginia Governor Loyalty Map. In 2013, @KenCuccinelli lost to @TerryMcAuliffe , yet the county map did change when @EdWGillespie lost to @GovernorVA (Ralph Northam)		#ElectionTwitter #Virginia #VAGov #Election https://t.co/tzi6tOY953

If anyone has, or knows how to use QGIS, I'm trying to download it for a Windows 10. I have limited storage, so should I go with the 64 bit or the 32 bit?
Here is a Kentucky Loyalty Map from 2011 - 2015. There were no GOP Counties that flipped to the Democrats. It's going to be interesting to see what the Governor Election this year looks like, and the county flips. 		#Election2019 #ElectionTwitter #Governor #Kentucky https://t.co/HauLY5AqP3
@JakobIsSmug @SenhorRaposa It’s just a poll, I legitimately want to know what people think
Who will last longer? #Elections2019 #ElectionTwitter #Northam #UK
@RealSaavedra This guy needs to resign, there is no other option.
I smell a Presidential Run... https://t.co/MT7yWa65HY
@RMartinWriting @CoryBooker @VoteOjeda2020 He dropped out last week
@RalphNortham may think he can hold on, but this just put him over the line of resignation. If @LGJustinFairfax calls for the resignation, then Northam is completely done. https://t.co/e9HlALGnLZ
We have another update to the #2020 Election Slide. Senator @CoryBooker announced his run yesterday for President. Definitely a controversial person, but with the right campaigning, he can do very well. https://t.co/84IZjSHuHu
Pretty sure we all know you’re going to run @ewarren https://t.co/3xkn5XFrwd
Will @hickforco (John Hickenlopper) run for Colorado Senate or run for President in your opinion?
Guys, we did it! We've hit over 100 followers! Thank you all so much, and let's keep going!
With @VoteOjeda2020 dropping out, we've updated our 2020 Tracker. In my opinion, I think the next person to announce is @BernieSanders	#Election2020 #DemocraticPrimary #Vote https://t.co/QVYUe3XPeq
Although @ewarren hasn’t officially announced, we all know it’s going to happen. So, we’ve updated our primary slide! The variety of candidates is honestly the best part. https://t.co/tOclXHHZbx
We have a new addition to the #2020 #DemocraticPrimary Mayor @PeteButtigieg announced his run, and also announced how to properly prounounce his name. This race is going to get a lot more crowded, and we'll be here along the way.		Credit to @stemann_aaron for the slide https://t.co/yoY43Eif9X
Although @AlisonForKY denied that she wasn't running for Secretary of State, Governor, or any other Statewide Office this year, there is still a chance she may run for Senate. If @senatemajldr runs again, and his approval continues to go down, she may run for his seat once again.

Today we lost a man who never stop fighting. President Bush set a precedent on how to be a loving, caring, parent and husband, and to be a good President. I'm so glad that you have your Barbara again, and knowing her, she would probably say: "Took you long enough!" https://t.co/f9ORyWGwEW

These are the Texas Senate Elections from 2018 &amp; 2012. As we can see, the Democrats did very well in some counties such as Hays and Williamson County, which they didn't do in 2012. But, looking at Jefferson County, Ted Cruz did better than he did in 2012. #TexasSenateElection https://t.co/qsU9LHUcLg

@JasonCutter11 Liberal Twitter doesn’t mean Texas is going blue. Even if Beto does well with the Bernie Wing, he can’t get Conservative Democrats and Moderate Republicans, and won’t get a big amount of independents. I live in Texas, trust me.
RT @realJakobTawney: #TXSenateDebate Who do you believe won the Debate tonight?
Ted Cruz won the Texas Senate Debate for a Couple Simple Reasons:		Beto couldn't defend himself well when talking about his accident in 98'	He kept talking about Texas Counties	He kept talking about Pecans	His attacks were weak
