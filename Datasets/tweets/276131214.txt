@realDonaldTrump So the proven liar Cohen is lying?
@JKayG5614 @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Yes it is
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump If they are applying for asylum there's a US embassy in Mexico city.
@realDonaldTrump Use the army. Declare an emergency
@Thomas1774Paine Shes got one foot in the grave. 	Amy Coney Barrett should   be preparing for Senate hearings.
@realDonaldTrump Get our people out
@Thomas1774Paine Unbelievable
@Thomas1774Paine The state of the union address will happen.
@Thomas1774Paine Its an illness
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Congratulations
@realDonaldTrump Lots of trolls on this page.
@MichaelCohen212 @WSJ @realDonaldTrump @POTUS . Mlm
@MichaelCohen212 @WSJ @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Lying sumbitch
@IngrahamAngle @LifeZette 100 hours of community service should teach her a lesson.
@TwitterMoments @iamcardib Who the hell are you?
@BensmanTodd @TomFitton These people aren't coming to America to be Americans, they are coming to be Venezuelans, hondurans and Mexicans in the United States. No assimilation at all.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Bring our troops home.
@jeisrael @RandPaul Respect is earned
@RandPaul I agree, the Democrats should get nothing until they agree to stop politicizing the security of the United States.
@realDonaldTrump So what is new?
@TMZ @AnnCoulter Can i buy stock in this young man?
@RealJamesWoods @AnnCoulter I had a gun held under my chin by a man that was obviously drunk and at that moment i would have done anything he asked. Thankfully the police showed up and literally saved my life.
@RealJamesWoods @Gillette Furthering the demasculinization of men.
@BurgerKing Lol  that's funny. 	Wendy's will be my choice from now on.
@SenatorCollins What's wrong is that there is a two income family without a savings account.
@realDonaldTrump The wall while  is a barrier doesn't address the root of the problem. Stop the incentives that draw illegals into the U.S. 	Repeal the anchor baby provision.	Zero social services for non citizens 	Mandatory death penalty for drug smuggling/peddling.
@DrewBrown404 @MorteAiTiranni @RealJamesWoods Really?
@RealJamesWoods Those young men are loving it!
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Couldn't agree more Senator.
@SenFeinstein @CA_EDD Santa Feinstein
@Thomas1774Paine The pot calling the kettle black....	Oops..
@SenFeinstein Phttttttttt
@RealJamesWoods Metro male
@RealJamesWoods Bwhahaha
@RealJamesWoods Lol....damn
@realDonaldTrump Repeal the anchor baby provision and remove all aid to anyone in the US illegally. Make drug smuggling/peddling a mandatory death penalty.	Dont need a wall.
@GovMattBevin Legalize casino gambling and recreational marijuana andthe state will flourish. Make peddling drugs a mandatory death penalty.
@RealJamesWoods Is that a black mammy on top of the cupboard?
@realDonaldTrump Stop the incentives and the flow of illegal aliens will stop. 	Make selling illegal drugs mandatory death penalty and the illegal drugs will stop.
@SarahPalinUSA All part of the soros/google/Facebook/mainstream media censorship.
@SenFeinstein Maybe enforcing our immigration laws would help.
@Thomas1774Paine She is
@realDonaldTrump The Clintons are a lost cause.	 Forget the wall. Reopen the government. 	Stick it up the unsupportive Senate's ass and prepare for your retirement in two years  the country is already to far gone to save it.
@realDonaldTrump Incredible	Hold the course
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It will be put into the hands of a federal court judge that will sit on it for a year before ruling against it.
@SenFeinstein Round them up and deport them.
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump What evidence?
@realDonaldTrump You want to solve the problem without a wall?	Repeal the anchor baby provision, no aid for illegal aliens.  	That should do it.
@SenFeinstein Just simplify the situation and execute them all.
@realDonaldTrump Forget the wall, you'll be forgiven.  Repeal the anchor baby provision, government aid only for citizens, public education just for citizens and make it an automatic death penalty for smuggling/peddling drugs.
@SenatorCardin These are not nonessential personnel.
@RealJamesWoods Nasty
@seanhannity The dims will never give you anything.
@RealJamesWoods Automatic death penalty.
@realDonaldTrump Don't trust anyone at CNN, MSNBC, or any of the news services. Not even Fox.
@mimiann20 @realDonaldTrump So what's your point?
@realDonaldTrump I would be happy if you just removed the incentives that draw illegals into the U.S..
@RealJamesWoods What a sick man
@RealJamesWoods This has to stop.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Where can I find your new podcast?
@senatemajldr Bullshit,  it's a place of tribal warfare where the US shouldn't be involved.
@marcorubio And then you want to remove our ability to defend ourselves
@SenFeinstein Remove the incentives 	There, fixed it
@realDonaldTrump Remove the incentives
@davidcicilline @SenJeffMerkley Democrat weasel
@DarleneKells1 @DeadmannHealer @realDonaldTrump The United States is not the police of the world.

@SenFeinstein You're an idiot
@RandPaul Gravy train
@RealJamesWoods You're a patriot Mr Woods
@SenGaryPeters Then fund the wall instead of funding international welfare.

@bucksdad42 @CraigRSawyer @r_powell12 The US is founded on Christian principles true enough but we are not a theocracy.  You can swear on a Dunkin doughnut as long as your swear.

@realDonaldTrump Just remove the incentives! Anchor baby provision and other perks like public education for the children.
@RealJamesWoods Trash
@jimfraser56 @realDonaldTrump What don't you understand about illegal?
@realDonaldTrump We don't need a wall. 	Change the anchor baby provision and no benefits of any kind for illegal aliens of any kind. Problem solved.
@GovMattBevin Great job governor and president Trump
@GMC Perfect for metro Males that don't intend on working the truck.
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you remove the incentives that draw illegals into the U.S.?
@WatchOtrade Hi! It's been a while for me.

@therealroseanne Hi Roseanne!  Right you are.
@WatchOtrade Lol, you doing ok?
@Thomas1774Paine If Roseanne Barr said that idiot was an animal Roseanne would be labeled a racist.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump I don't agree with your statement that Lincoln was elected to preserve the union and end slavery.	I'm glad to see you out of prison though and agree with most everything else you stand for.
@Thomas1774Paine Opportunist
@realDonaldTrump What's your plan for SSI?

@Thomas1774Paine What an idiot
@RASSI85 @therealroseanne So if that's the case, are you shaming her using mental illness as a tool?
@therealroseanne Hi Roseanne 	Your show should be pitched to Fox.
@mflynnJR @realDonaldTrump Travesty
@Thomas1774Paine Body armor. The left wants her to go away.
@2021_free @realDonaldTrump Roseanne lived through some rough times.
@realDonaldTrump It's an honor to be invited to the Whitehouse. The players don't want the honor so be it but the players that want to come should be invited.
@realDonaldTrump Yep
@GoodlandJim @realDonaldTrump I guess you're brilliant
@cblockus @realDonaldTrump No, it's the only way he can get his message out the mainstream media is in the bag for the Democrats and the leftist agenda and the globalist agenda
@realDonaldTrump Because they're determined to bring down the United States
@WatchOtrade Well deserved.
@darkpanther39 @therealroseanne She's had her moments but  I have far more respect for Roseanne  than Hanoi Jane

@darkpanther39 @therealroseanne Pffffftttttt
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Good!
@therealroseanne I'd sue
@realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne While I don't agree with what you said thinking it's a bit tasteless I'll defend her right to say it. Maybe Roseanne had a conduct clause in her contract.	An apology should have been sufficient.
@realDonaldTrump Man, look at all the trolls!
@therealroseanne Did you have a conduct clause in your contract with ABC?
@andrewrich78 @RealAlexJones That could be too
@RealAlexJones Body armor. 	The deep state wants her gone
@TC_resistance @therealroseanne Dipshit

@Mar4351219 @Thomas1774Paine There were more African American children aborted than born in NYC in 2017
@AnnCoulter Bwahaha
@realDonaldTrump Why such a strong reaction to a former Russian spy being poisoned? You want to start a conflict over such a miniscule reason?
@realDonaldTrump Why are you reacting to the poisoning of a former Russian spy by picking a fight?
@realDonaldTrump That's not the militaries job.

@realDonaldTrump Don't sign this bill. I'm not crazy about the idea of building a wall but this is bullshitt. Don't give in to the rinos. Too much defense spending, fund SSI!
@WatchOtrade It's all a load of crap
@Thomas1774Paine Yeah well, I'd would have screwed Biden's girlfriend.
@GovMattBevin Looks like a Beshear to me.
@realDonaldTrump Whip his ass, boss.
@SarahPalinUSA This boy is a trained monkey.
@realDonaldTrump Did you pick a wall? Maybe you could have a poll to see what the rest of us thinks about the wall designs.
@WatchOtrade That's my biggest thing. Damn job interferes with my trading. I've been burned more than once because my attention wasn't on the charts.
@Thomas1774Paine I agree. I thought it was a horrible idea at the time and I still say that.

@WatchOtrade That's great Omar. Thanks
@WatchOtrade You don't post a daily build list anymore? I've been paper trading thinkorswim for a while now. I should probably open an trading account so I have access to the tools you use.
@WatchOtrade Kind of though so.
