@rsuenaga I just checked the projector and it is in fact 15 pins.
@marcorbito It's an older MacBook, so probably the one @JohnGarcia mentioned, DVI to VGA, would work.
@rsuenaga lol. not sure which really, Gil just said the computer looking connector. :-) Probably VGA.

@marcorbito Awesome. I might DM you to confirm I'm getting the right one then.

@champuru @windwardskies True, making dresses for my daughter would be so simple. Sewing machine is getting higher priority I think.
@Melissa808 That's a long way to go for a tweet-up! :-)
@logieo Yep, mom crocheted and I learned a little myself.
@windwardskies My mom made all our clothes when I was little and then quilts with the scraps. It was fun to find our old outfits on quilt.
@champuru I'm definitely going to check it out!
@champuru @logieo Best thing is for her to see you sewing! My mom sewed all the time and that's what got me interested in it.
@champuru If you see a really good deal, let me know, I'll do the same for you.
@windwardskies Every time I see the shop on Ward I want to go in. Probably shouldn't since that's out of my budget for sure!
@windwardskies @champuru Going to watch for a deal then...I guess I have until May. :-)
@windwardskies Now there's a thought and a good place to check for a deal.
@windwardskies Awesome! My husband is bad at hints, but "I want a sewing machine for my birthday" was a pretty big hint, I thought!
@champuru I had the best dressed Barbie on the block! :-)
@champuru I've seen less expensive, basic models at Sears. My first sewing machine was a Barbie brand and it came with a mannequin doll!
@champuru I'm thinking between $250 to $400 for a decent one. My bday isn't until November!!
@logieo @champuru @marcorbito @typezero3 If I can get a sewing machine by April, count me in!
@champuru When I had access to a sewing machine I sewed quite a bit. A good sewing machine is on my wish list right now. :-)
@marcorbito @champuru You should find someone to do a class for both of you! I actually learned how to make my own clothing patterns.
@champuru I was lucky to have a lady in our neighborhood teach me and two other friends when we were in Junior High.
@champuru I have another story concerning me and the Pali Momi ER, but it's too gory for Twitter!! I'll tell you some other time. ;-)
@champuru Definitely! When I took son at that age to Pali Momi they didn't have equipment small enough to check him out properly.

@bengutierrez Yes, Dave reacted the way the average person would when faced with basically a rude child. So many other great moments.

@FLOW828 Thanks for the #followfriday love!
@tenbears Heh heh. I saw that tweet. And we were discovered by the fart bot!
@tenbears If that's the case, my husband is a communication guru. :-)
@loic Same here. I get more responses on FB.
RT @ParkRat: @Leilokelani You could try yawning really loudly. Or just fart. - The new etiquette? :-D
@thebrownboi OMG. Me too. I was first place on my team for the last tournament. Are we FB friends?

@jasonsalas Aha! I had a feeling it was yours. :-) Oddly, my use of profanity has been reduced since having kids.
@steamykitchen LOL! A bonding experience if there ever was one. :-)
@ChristopherY @valdezign Thanks for the info! Need to get a birthday gift for my son's friend this week. That would be perfect.
@jasonsalas LOL. The G**m one is good! I'm surprised bacon and chocolate didn't work. :-)
Thanks @AlohaArleen! I hope all 75K of your followers don't follow me at once. ;-) #followfriday #alohafriday
Thank you @NaniWaialeale for the #followfriday love. You put me in great company in that tweet! #alohafriday
He calls me a Twitter celeb...and you know...he makes me feel like one! Follow @OahuAJ for instant celeb status! #followfriday #alohafriday
@burajiru Aww! The feeling is mutual. Thanks for the #followfriday love!
What You Missed Last Night: Fallon deletes all of his social networks http://tinyurl.com/lug467 (via @tvsquad) - Funny!
@jasonsalas I throw caution to the wind! chocolate, bacon, Guam, wedding, pork, dogs, cats. Take that bots!
Thanks for the #followfriday love! @djsmook @dkmashino @universoulcrew @alohabruce @matt_369...All great tweeps to follow also! #alohafriday
Lowe's must have just done some customer service refreshers. Been greeted twice so far. NEVER been greeted before.

@robynmcintyre That's a great idea to do just X #followfriday recs at a time. I get overwhelmed trying to do too many.
@jenncosta I'll see you there then! My husband does music for the fashion show too. I'll be at our booth.
@dkmashino The merging would be a perfect time to do it too!
@dkmashino Yes, but you'll need twice as many points to do anything. ;-)
@5toSucceed Those look cool. I've had a different kind of red banana that was more like a plantain.
@jenncosta Oh cool! Are you with a vendor or shopping as a bride?
@AlohaBruce That's what we do on Fridays! It's our errand day usually, today we have the expo. :-)
I'm at Zippy's Restaurants: Waipio - http://bkite.com/07XFu
Going to be at the Convention Center this evening for the Wedding Expo. N-D Mixx has a booth.
@hawaii Darn it! I knew I forgot more than the dental appt. this morning. Have fun!
@jasonsalas You can say that again! Never been so scared in my whole life.
@SheilaS Hope you're enjoying your visit! #hawaiihta

@AngelaKeen When my son had it I was aware of it because one twin niece had it already. Funny, other twin did not get it.
@moearora LOL. Cracking up over nostril hair guy! May have to postpone breakfast. :-)
@AngelaKeen For us the fever was the worst part. My son kept throwing up the baby Tylenol and fever was SO high!
@Biggie Now that's a superpower! I wonder if it will work with my toaster oven?
@Paisano Besides, ice cream can only do good. :-)
@Paisano Definitely Krispy Kreme! Especially now that people are making hamburgers with them!
@TeamRachel Fifth disease? Is that Roseola?
@megspeaks My kids have come to him for years! He IS very nice.
I'm at Dr. Christopher C. Lee, DDS - http://bkite.com/07Vxj
@sanlei LOVED getting rick-rolled by PackRat today. Of course it had to be part of the meme set. :-D
Are you using @MrTweet yet? Besides recommending you to relevant folks, he also helps you discover them as well! http://mrtweet.com?v=12

@jacobm You go Jacob! Just remember those of us that have followed since you only had 100! :-)
@lavasusan I had the pulehu style ribeye. It was great!
I'm at Good To Grill - http://bkite.com/07SyL
@dcb97 Yes, but "so you think you can dance" makes up for it. (just not on Tuesdays).
I'm at Hyatt Regency Waikiki Resort & Spa - http://bkite.com/07StW
Heading to Waikiki to meet with a prospective client. Their wedding is on the 6th!!
@lavagal Here's a tissue. ((hug)) I know how you feel. Son had his first school performance last week.
@FredaMooncotch I learned to sail in college through a program with the Coast Guard and Red Cross. Great fun!
@Paisano Haha, You're right. I'm completely over the trauma now.
@Paisano Before I moved to Hawaii, had same hairdresser for over 20 years. Had anxiety going to new person!

@kanahina That's good to know. Hubby isn't a fan either. So that means I can still drag him to see it.
I'm at Kabuki Restaurant - http://bkite.com/07MxC
Whoa. Lost by 5 points to @scrivener. It was no one's game until the last move. Nothing like good competition.
@rsuenaga For me the texture makes them "taste" better. :-)
@rsuenaga The texture of the steel cut oats is different. If you're blending yours into smoothies I don't think you'll notice a difference.
I love the steel-cut oats at Jamba, but homemade would be better. Here's the basic method from @culinate http://twurl.nl/xk3p26
@OahuAJ Hey AJ! You're so sweet and definitely more of a celeb than little ol' me. #alohafriday
@OliverRanch Yep, busted! When hubby has a gig it's just easier than cooking a meal they won't eat. :-)

@nathankam Is it TweetLocal? I'm bad at remembering names of apps.
Having our favorite weekend special @Zippys. Chinatown Steamed Opakapaka.
@steamykitchen Yay! So excited for you! Can't wait to order one for myself. :-)

@jodabone Thank you! She's an incredible kid. :-)
@rsuenaga @melody LOL, that's a good thing, right? :-)
My daughter turned four today! She's a bossy little thing and works hard at her job of being the boss of us all.
listening to I'll kill her by SoKo - http://www.thesixtyone.com/SoKo/song/39139/
@NaniWaialeale Thank you Nanette!
@DJSMOOK My baby girl turned 4 today. I feel old! :-)
@DJSMOOK Hey Smooks!
Another recipe featuring versatile and tasty flank steak. This one is from @culinate. http://twurl.nl/vu86zj
Grilling season is coming! @rasamalaysia does chicken kebabs up right. Don't forget to soak your wooden skewers. http://twurl.nl/aoyxdh
@scrivener Nice! Um, was that in our game?
@douglasbass I'm sure you were very proud too! I love when my kids surprise me with their cleverness.
I'm at 91-1163 Kamaaha Loop, HI 96707 - http://bkite.com/07HVx
Playing Scrabble & Lexulous on my phone. I &lt;3 my iPhone!
@Stazzy LOL. Apparently my job tonight is to make people crave stuff.
@Stazzy They do! We used to get the kim chi oysters and other poke here. We mostly go to Don Quixote now.
I'm at Foodland - http://bkite.com/07G4I
@thestuffguy Happy birthday! My daughter's b-day is tomorrow.
@AlohaBruce I'm thinking Feta & Tomato Salad. Are you drooling yet? ;-)
Heading to Aina Haina to pick up some speakers. Then to Greek Marina for dinner.
@jenncosta Nice to meet you. Having @rsuenaga call you the perfect stalker is a huge compliment! At least in Twitter land. :-)
@rsuenaga I'll have to follow her and see what her secrets are...not that I would ever stalk anyone. ;-)
@chotda Maybe I'm just swayed by the heath bars I have mixed in. :-)
@melody Maybe I can just get a bunch of people to stalk @rsuenaga outside of the Kaneohe post office instead.
Holding up my game with @scrivener while I try to figure out how to place this bingo! (in case he's wondering what's taking so long)
@DJSMOOK Yo Smookie! Off from work tonight?
@champuru Hubby says we should have waited for 3.0, but he also wonders why we waited so long to get them...so useful.
@tweetpea I love mine so far. Getting used to the keyboard hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be.
@chotda The ice cream is better than Baskin-Robbins though. IMO
@NaniWaialeale Sounds like the kind of humidity in Guam.
@NaniWaialeale Stamps have MUCH better adhesive than these envelopes. Box won't fit in the frig though. :-)
@rsuenaga Who can blame you...you have a sweet deal. :-)
@NaniWaialeale That's exactly what it is! We thought we were saving money buying in bulk. :-S
@champuru Even the guy at Apple Store when we got iPhones still had a Razr...he's holding out for iPhone 3.0. :-)
@chotda I wish you'd tell us what you REALLY thought of those cupcakes. ;-)
The huge box of self-adhesive envelopes we bought at CostCo have stopped self-adhering...now using duct tape to make sure they stay closed.
@rsuenaga Cool, it will be in the mail tomorrow. :-)
@melody Death threats?? LOL, I would never do that. :-)
@saimin Glee was also available as a free download at iTunes last week. Don't know about now though.
@rsuenaga DM me your address and I'll mail it out tomorrow. :-)
@rsuenaga Did you get enough CostCo Pepsi coupons? I just found ours and we don't drink Pepsi products.
Flank steak is great stuff. It's easy to make tasty dishes like this with it: http://twurl.nl/pfv6g8 Another one from @simplyrecipes
You have to see this unbelievable Chocolate Ganache Torte from @simplyrecipes http://twurl.nl/m5yma0
@hawaii You probably have google alerts set up for this kind of stuff, but...a Lost scoop from EW: http://is.gd/BrvW
Free song! @anuheajams is a Discovery Download. Great track, great artist. RT iTunes link: http://bit.ly/anuhea #anuheaonitunes via @hawaii
@burajiru I started seeing 100% Kona a few months ago at CostCo. Don Quixote has a whole section of just Kona also.
Anyone going to the World Class Wedding Expo? Gil does the music for the fashion show, say Hi!
@bengutierrez Congratulations!! I told my husband on Friday you were going to be the announcement. Glad I was right!
@burajiru You can buy 100% Kona almost anywhere, including CostCo. :-)
@rickyli99 Is there such a thing as too much pork?
@funhiguy I was going to retweet that, but caught myself. :-D
@damontucker Free sample time is also crowd time...we're allergic to crowds. :-)
@rsuenaga They close at 8:30. I had a game plan so all I needed was 30 minutes.
I'm at Costco - http://bkite.com/07C6D
I'm at Zippy's Restaurants: Waipio - http://bkite.com/07C21
On our way to @Zippys to use our 20% off coupon.
Listening to the latest episode of "the Transmission." Best Lost podcast ever. Get it at iTunes!

@hawaii Two hours for the finale is acceptable. Give us the works!!
Heading to the Hale Koa with emergency CD for Gil's friend. His ext HD fell and broke today.
@kanahina Traffic is flowing past pretty good now...just the crash site itself is literally a mess!
Just passed the Ewa cutoff that was closed because of the accident. It's still closed and still a huge mess.
I'm at 91-1163 Kamaaha Loop, HI 96707 - http://bkite.com/07A3u
Heading to Wahiawa for a wedding reception at Dot's. Getting there early for the pupus.
@colinsato If only we could choose how our superpowers manifest themselves. *sigh*
@FLOW828 LOL. Here's a better recap that presents a similar theory in a more coherent way. http://twurl.nl/qx0ke2
@colinsato Well of course...white would not have worked, it was after Labor Day.
@mabuhaybananas I don't know...he seems to be full of hot air, if I were you, I'd proceed cautiously.
@colinsato Ooh, interesting music trivia...just the kind of obscure fact that I will remember forever. LOL
@colinsato Um...yeah, sure Colin. ;-)
@DJSMOOK I'm good...been having fun with blip.fm.
@burajiru LOL! I know!! When I think about it now it makes my skin crawl.
@colinsato The lead singer I saw was on an album that didn't do very well, but he did a good job singing their older hits.
@DJSMOOK Hiya Smooks!
Here's one that actually plays. ♫ http://blip.fm/~6fduf
Oops almost forgot this concert. It was so packed I was drenched in other people's sweat! ♫ http://blip.fm/~6fdry
@colinsato What guy didn't like that band? I remember some disappointed friends when they realized those girls were NOT on tour with him. :)
Ending our 80s flashback...these guys played the field house, but without this lead singer. ♫ http://blip.fm/~6fdfz
Saw this guy in concert too...he had zero personality. It's a good thing his touring band was young and hot! ♫ http://blip.fm/~6fd51
@bhl1 You're right, that was a weird dream...I don't know if you want to delve too deeply into the interpretation of that one. :-)
Another group that played UOG field house. Right when this song was #1 on the charts. ♫ http://blip.fm/~6fcvv
@jeffkang Found it! Great quote...worthy of tweet 9000. Let's see if I'll be able to catch MY 9000th tweet. :-)
S.O.S. Band reminds me of college. They were one of the first mainland groups to play the UOG field house. ♫ http://blip.fm/~6fces
@5toSucceed It's definitely an adventure. :-)
