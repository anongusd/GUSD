We will march on with poise, confidence and the knowledge that we too are blazing trails and leaving this country a better and more equal place for all."		#SemperFi MSgt Meghann Viggiani, every service honoree, and all the House attendees of this powerful @wimsatweets event!
Merely saying thank you to our forbearers doesn‚Äôt quantify the amount of gratitude we all have for every person who came before us, so instead of trying to put it in words, we will put it into our actions.
And if on occasion when you encounter one of the people who try and cast judgement, let your actions speak for you. Success and greatness are much harder to disprove than simple words.
I challenge everyone to push forward knowing we are each individually valued, and we are being called upon because of our knowledge, skillsets and wisdom we all bring to the table; not because of our gender, race, religion, orientation or any other factor.
I‚Äôve had the luxury to unquestionably follow my passion and my patriotism for the last 20 years thanks to the women who persisted before me. We have come so far that now our momentum can only grow. Together we are unstoppable.
I become endlessly thankful I am able say with honesty and pride that I am not a female Marine nor a Woman Marine, I am a U.S. Marine.
When I think about all the American women and the trials and tribulations they had to face just to show their support and patriotism, just to help this country become the great nation it now is...
The struggles and battles that American women overcame throughout the past 242 years were hard fought, hard won and not without both gain and loss, but the battles we all must face in life are put in place to help us learn and grow, to adapt and overcome.
This fact can‚Äôt be overstated, but I would add that this is also necessary not just for individual women, but for the future successes of all women.
In her book ‚ÄòLean In,‚Äô Sheryl Sandburg said ‚ÄúBeing confident and believing in your own self-worth is necessary to achieve your potential.‚Äù
Because of the paths blazed by these and hundreds of thousands	of other women, the list of great military women is now too long	to list everyone by name and that in itself is an amazing feat.
These historic women make up only a tiny portion of the overall history of great American Military women. From the formation of the U.S. in the Revolutionary war and onward, women have always been involved, invested, and intertwined in the battles and their outcomes for the U.S.
Ultimately, she refused to return it and continued to wear it until her death in 1919. It wasn‚Äôt until 1977 that then President Carter rightfully and publicly restored the medal to her.
Dr. Mary Walker, a Civil War Surgeon and the only woman to earn the Medal of Honor for her actions during the war, battled to prevent her medal from being revoked in 1917.
Elizabeth Newcom fought in the Mexican-American War as Bill Newcom &amp; became the 1st female Soldier to cross the Santa Fe Trail. She served for 10 months before being discovered &amp; had to sue the government for the land promised to those who fought. She was later awarded 160 acres.
"Deborah Sampson disguised herself as Robert Shurtleff in order to fight in the Revolutionary war against Great Britain, and while it is known that hundreds of women fought and contributed to the war, she was one of only two women to receive a military pension for their service.
MSgt Viggiani's spoke on behalf of herself and her fellow honorees. In recognition of 2018's particular significance for all Marines as the 100th year of women in the @USMC, everyone should have the opportunity to hear what she wrote. Her remarks shared in full here:
In addition to @RepTenney, twelve other Members of Congress attended to honor Women in the Military: @NancyPelosi @RepComstock @JacksonLeeTX18 @RepLawrence @SusanWBrooks @RepMimiWalters @cathymcmorris @RepValDemings @RepLoisFrankel @JuliaBrownley26 @RepSusanDavis @RepDianeBlack
During a program including servicewomen from the @USNavy @USArmy @usairforce @USCG, MSgt spoke about her pride in being a U.S. Marine, about facing battles in life put there to make us learn &amp; grow, adapt &amp; overcome, and showing gratitude to our forbearers through our actions.
