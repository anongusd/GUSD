@JudicialWatch We all knew about this nonetheless it's terrifying to know that our own dollars are used to enslave us.
@DLoesch How are you surprised!?!
@senatemajldr @TheDeliaAspect The left has fresh faces.... Maybe the right needs some as well.
@KayaJones @Dwarfclone It's not just the Clinton's...
@ThomasSowell @Dwarfclone .... History confuses the left.... Intelligence is... How do I put it... The lefts antithesis
@DonaldJTrumpJr He was already in a show... Donald Trumps "The Apprentice" last I checked he was fired before he even got to the boardroom...
@thecjpearson Yes... The answer is yes.... Considering they want to ruin what it means to be traditionally American.... Especially since... You know... Half of America voted for Clinton...
@TreyYingst .... I mean... Aren't they always at each other's throats?...
@DRIVETRIBE .... Just don't get the quattroporte... Rumor has it... Sneezing will blow it up...
@TheOfficerTatum I owe you the respect you earn as an individual.
@charliekirk11 @Dwarfclone ... Orrrr... Or... Nobody is holding them accountable to the insanity they are spewing... This is what happens when you don't throw corrupt politicians in jail... Cough cough Clinton...
@realDailyWire @AsheSchow Surprise suprise...
@DrPhil @realDailyWire Watch an adult spank a toddler... Stay tuned to find out which is which.
@MattWalshBlog haven't you heard. Lies are truth and vise versa
@DFBHarvard @pjamesjp1 FINALLY... someone speaking logically.
@trish_regan @DineshDSouza only for logical individuals... Bernie Sanders on the other hand....
@realDailyWire #fearmongering
@JesseKellyDC I find more intelligent debate occur in 5th grade classrooms.
@DLoesch Moving forward... articles of clothing depicting Nike offend me... Effectively making the wearers racists, bigots, and homophones.... and misogynists.... Islamophobia.... technophobes, annnnnd nevertrumpers, annddd.... #lovetrumpshatebutonlywhenitspplIagreewt
@AaronBlake @dmartosko I bet he colludes with the Simpsons writers as well... You know... Since they predicted Trump...
@DailyCaller People still watch the NFL?
@brithume @IngrahamAngle Really isn't surprising anymore.
@JudicialWatch i love when people tell me what to think.
@marklevinshow soooooo... this changes..... nothing?
@Popdust well clearly it's by scamming the rest of us...
@EsotericCD Nothings more important than a liar getting his 5 minutes... you know that.... CNN knows best lol
@w_terrence but. but. but.... how can't you not believe him? #believethevictims
@SenTedCruz @benshapiro @FreeBeacon Wonder why this isn't in the News... Oh wait.... We are supposed to be busy believing	 a liar.
@DineshDSouza @washingtonpost I think it's time they start messing with people their own size... Oh wait... That would require bravery...
@SwipeWright @benshapiro are you really surprised about the hypocrisy?
@NolteNC @steph93065 On the other hand... It is a crime to be a conservative.... Apparently
@LaCheburashka @GabeHoff @Cernovich how Cliche....
@MattWalshBlog @AOC Have you ever seen Shutter Island?
@Raccoonsister @LarryOConnor @michaeljknowles Right... Because laissez Faire policies are ineffective... You must have an economics degree as well. I'll show you mine if you show me yours... (fun fact... I actually have one)
@paulsperry_ @steph93065 Classic politics and manipulation. If you're surprised by this anymore you've been living under a rock.
@anntensity @AnnCoulter Isn't this what you wanted?
@AnnCoulter We need your support rather than beratement.
@m_yosry2012 @DrSueDVM My cat is nowhere near this nice... Can someone say figurative sledgehammer?
Can we give congress more time to read the 1169 page bill before it's signed... You know... So we can know what we are getting into... Like any sane person... That's how it is today... Nobody reads the "terms and  conditions" anymore.
@LarryOConnor @michaeljknowles But she has a degree in EcOnOmIcS
@GabeHoff @Cernovich I love how everybody THINKS they know... The pen hasn't even hit the paper yet... You should know... NEVER assume to know what he will do...
@jasonconwall @steph93065 Hello New Detroit... Oh whoops... New York... ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
Watching Band of Brothers... It reminds me of the sacrifices that were made to make life so carefree today. We MUST preserve their legacy.
@SasjaBeslik Or... We can curb Indian and Chinese emissions... Orrrr make nuclear Great again... But hey...
@DRIVETRIBE ... I mean... LOOK AT IT!!!
@PrisonPlanet @Dwarfclone Those who control the media write our history books.. Or in this case.... Rewrite
@DonaldJTrumpJr They refuse to fund a wall... Because walls don't work... But will knock a wall down............  ... ... Because they don't work? So... Useless spending... Like you've been fighting to prevent?!?
@Drive_pedia That would require work though... That's millennial kryotonite....
@LibertyEGreen @realDailyWire @emzanotti @benshapiro @MattWalshBlog @andrewklavan @michaeljknowles @JeremyDBoreing @ElishaKrauss @ayasgirl His wife... I think she's a doctor...
@marklutchman @DrSueDVM Preach brother!!!
@rising_serpent @DrSueDVM So much for her economics degree... Would that mean she has a degree in Google searches???
@AOC Listen... I can't stand you.... Though... Even a blind squirrel is right twice a day... Amazon should be contributing like the rest of us... Although... So should every American.
@RubinReport I mean... At least they're being honest
@AnnCoulter Wow... Where did this hatred come from? You sound alot like the people you claim to be against.
Our politics have now become victims of our modern day logistics. Let's not forget, we ate meat because of necessity. Less than 50 years ago protein alternatives were expensive and oftentimes UNATTAINABLE, ESPECIALLY in communist nations...
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump I want to play!!!
@RubinReport widespread attacks on ALL religions.
@cryptorecruitr ... Look at Venezuela ... perfect example
@TitaniaMcGrath one word for your existence... Irrelevant
@thepennyhoarder .... Here is an idea... Proper personal financial management... You know... One of the few courses that SHOULD be taught in k-12
@TomiLahren @mugsysway True hero
@TitaniaMcGrath Has this individual completely lost their minds!?!
@starcrosswolf Dishonorable
@Dawnsfire A new age of space exploration would be exhilarating
@michaeljknowles What's that!?!
@cryptorecruitr so much bearish sentiment going on. Nothing like permabears saturating the market.
@Dawnsfire Boom... And so begins indirect censorship
@FAIRImmigration I think you should focus on your bad stock prices...
@coinbase What is the use case of these coins?
@6BillionPeople This looks like diabeetus
@KenCalvert That's what happens when you're a moderate. To many people forfeit their values based on party lines.
@Cernovich Due process folks... Regardless of side...
@cryptorecruitr I've been holding since before the top... Never give up on litecoin!!!
@RepMattGaetz Anybody else notice kyrsten sinema kept applauding the president when her fellow democrats didn't?
@RepDanCrenshaw @michaeljknowles Anybody else notice kyrsten sinema kept applauding the president when her fellow democrats didn't?
@realDailyWire "Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country." sent chills down every socialist spine!!!
@SaysSimonson Other than the fact that democrats are obstructionists... You know... Kind of when a 2 year old won't stop saying no.
Am I the only one that noticed he said "makeded"? #makededcovfefe
@DineshDSouza Kamala Harris's face was epic
@michellemalkin Except suck in her dentures... Apparently
@benshapiro still against the state of the union?
@RubinReport @ReaganWorld Simmer down kemosabe
@spergwyatt @steph93065 He used dems tactics against them. He has them backed into a corner
@KurtSchlichter @ChrisCoon4 She doesn't care... Thank God he called out socialism for what it is
@SebGorka @ChrisCoon4 @SpeakerPelosi Dentures
@WhiteHouse @VP Anybody else notice he said makeded? #makededcovfefe lol but fantastic speach
@BuckSexton @ChrisCoon4 He's dropping bombs like the bombing of Berlin!!!
@ClintEastwoodLA @steph93065 #makededcovfefe
@CalebJHull Immensely unifying.
@henryrodgersdc @SenSanders @Potbelly I mean... Even he doesn't want to eat dogs... Only the rest of us in his opinion
@charliekirk11 @ChrisCoon4 @BernieSanders USA! USA! USA! USA!
@LevineJonathan @Cernovich @AOC This is what confusion looks like lol
@PolitiBunny Class is key. Regardless of political side. It's better than acting like a bunch of children. Imob
@LindaSuhler @steph93065 One of the greatest state of the unions in quite some time
@AnnCoulter And you're not?
@TomForUtah Because our generation isn't exactly know for logic and efficiency.
@SaysSimonson Sometimes decency and kindness wins. If you want a better world... Start by being nice yet truthful. Doesn't mean truth bombs can't happen.
@KassyDillon @KyleKashuv Picking is just... Not right...
@NevilleD35 Hmmmm but free market economies are confusing... Lol
@benshapiro Nope... I don't believe it... Doctors are a myth.
@BridgetPhetasy Only God is God...
@cryptorecruitr Only thing we can do is wait and see... No point in making predictions.
@realDailyWire You either know or don't know...
@JesseKellyDC Hard times make strong people... Easy times make weak people...
@MattWalshBlog If it looks like velvet cake... How bad can it be? Don't trust anything unless it's bacon... Or steak... Or anything NOT vegan.
@KyleKashuv @washingtonpost I died a little.... On the inside... Say goodbye to football.... Sniffle
@senatorshoshana What's that?
@RepLeeZeldin .... Look back to the dialogue prior to WWII... Many of the same arguments are being made....
@TaraLaRosa ... Why is he still around?!?
@MrJamesMay But the Germans had a small cannon on the me 109...
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi ... Isn't all corruption bad???
@RantyAmyCurtis Ooogaboogaboooga
@DLoesch At least you won't get measles...
@benshapiro What happened with your visit to Grand Canyon University!?! They claim to be conservative and Christian!!! Can you give us some insight?
@cryptorecruitr Wouldn't it be amazing if we formed a higher low?   If played right of course otherwise down down. I keep telling people to calm down... We've seen worse.

@cryptorecruitr @johnkim77 I'm just saying if litecoin is supposed to mirror bitcoin why is it that we don't reap the benefits of the highs but ltc sure as heck doesnt miss an opportunity to dump.
@cryptorecruitr @johnkim77 Not gonna lie man. Definitely starting to get discouraged about the price of ltc compared to btc	 Was supposed to be our moment...

@cryptorecruitr Think like an entrepreneur!!!
Let's focus on lifting those around us into a new era if enlightenment instead of into the deeper depths of ignorance.
@michaeljknowles How about simple sexual responsibility... You know put that thingy on your thingy before you out it in their thingy.
@realDailyWire @benshapiro Bet they would be if we redistributed their money.
@NRA More guns in the hands of the educated... Less guns in the hands of criminals... Enforce current laws!!! Bring hunters ed back into the classrooms and lets bring motality back to our nation!!!!

What are YOUR plans this 4th?
Ltc poised for another breakout short term. @cryptorecruitr
@cryptorecruitr U think we are gonna drop more?
@cryptorecruitr Everybody keeps panicking over these drops. Im over here hoarding all this ltc. #justsaying
@litecoin_bull @Litecoin_Turtle @BitcoinOpinions Im down over 7k in ltc at the moment.... But guess what... Im not sweating it... Scalp trade away!!!
@cryptorecruitr I want to trade this market so bad right now but it's far too risky.
Boom what did I say? Ltc is on the move upwards. 6 dollar jump!
https://t.co/FJJp71VS0s
Huge potential tonight but farrrr too risky to play. Moves are unpredictable. Sellers are getting exhausted expect spikes soon. Indicaters show a move in thr very near future.
Get it!!! Crypto markets are dropping and I still make some solid trades!!! Can anyone say weekend profits!!!
Had a rough day in stock trading. Lets gooooo crypto!!!
@davidgokhshtein Litecoin
Ltc macd is about to cross positive on the daily... Anticipate heafty pump.
@cryptorecruitr macd about to cross on the daily paired with the tether news should be catalyst enough to spike.
Macd on ltc about to cross downside. Expect drop
First morning trade: crypto rsi oversold looking to drop 3 dollars on ltc. Good scalp trade
@cryptorecruitr What do you think? Invest another 3k into ltc for short term?
Warren buffet once said "buy when people are fearful and sell when people are greedy" that is the long term key to the markets.
Knowledge is the key to success.  It's a huge pet peeve of mine that we now have one of the most powerful tools in human history in the palm of our hands and yet we spend the majority of the time in FB, insta, and Snapchat instead of using it as a the tool it was intended to be.
#killingit https://t.co/QYiuur5nqP
@cryptorecruitr @jreyes362000 Im up 3 LTC so far in 2 hours. Ill probably pull back in a bit and enter some stop losses.
@jreyes362000 @cryptorecruitr Dude I really hope we get a bull market soon... In the mean time doing some scalping and trading this volatility .
@cryptorecruitr bear flag... Watch this thing drop more....
@cryptorecruitr Or we smash through it like a fat kid walking across a frozen lake.
Crypto bull market incoming or no?
Starting up the midnight workouts again...
Almost 16 percent up in the day? Ill take it!!!

@nobody_home2 @CryptoKirby I hate to say it but FOMO is right. Experienced investors know and understand but the only way to make it moon is fomo. The whole reason I got into the market a year ago was because of fomo... Made that mistake and adjusted my methods.
@KyleKashuv Nothing like class... Cough cough
When things don't go according to plan... Stop... Recalculate...  Refocuse.... And reinstate.
