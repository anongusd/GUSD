Allison Liuzzi with the @WilderFdtn more on metrics: MN has some of the largest racial gaps in employment and educational achievement in the country, yet levels of interest among students in STEM is high across the board. These problems could be opportunities. #TechTalent
Allison Liuzzi with the @WilderFdtn‚Äôs Compass Project defines the problem by talking about demographics and the workforce shortage. Aging: By 2030, at least 1 in 5 residents in 80 of 87 counties will be over 65. There are over 100,000 baby boomers employed in STEM. #TechTalent
Deb Broberg with @RealTime_Talent kicks off the next session as we attempt to define the challenges with  finding #TechTalent in Minnesota. Among the challenges are workforce growth, migration trends, and racial disparities.
Great insights from @Target CIO Mike McNamara. Setting hiring goals and making intentional changes to culture led to significant cost reductions and increases in productivity. Attitude to learning and development and diversity can have enormous impact. #TechTalent https://t.co/ZzK6poAOs4
