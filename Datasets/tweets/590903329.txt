Moral of the story. Even if you live in very one-sided part of the country, voting matters. Especially in primaries. Self-sorting of citizens by party also matters in Senate and polarization there is not because of partisan gerrymandering.
Of that 18% of course, most don‚Äôt vote. And because of overwhelming polarization - most of the decisions about Senators happen in even lower turnout primaries (usually less than 30%). That‚Äôs 30% of 18% of Americans essentially deciding 48% of the Senators in the US Senate.
When Brent Kavanaugh is confirmed it‚Äôll be in large part because of the gerrymander by the Founder‚Äôs Design. Today 48% of the Senate is elected by 18% of the population. Most of those seats are Republican with much more conservative voters than the nation overall. https://t.co/HZlJfx2rwC

Often not a lack of polling - lack of understanding about polling that leaves pundits and media surprised. The 2016 election was no different btw. Polls were right at the end - they had HRC up but within the margin of error. And she did win the pop vote.
Disagree with the polling narrative here though. Fact is we've seen a lot of 2018 House level polls. And the Florida Dem Gov Primary was heavily polled - but primary polls always have huge margins of error, especially in races w &gt;3 candidates. @VanityFair @PeterHamby

@allisoncapley Problem with Trump is that he has rhetoric that is more racist than pragmatic. Nations having open borders doesn't seem to be on table...

@allisoncapley And I don't care what the U.K. or Canada do - that doesn't mean it's a good thing for America or reflects our values.
