@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump The third trimester abortion of a viable fetus is a smoke screen. These abortions are only done to save the life of the mother, during the events of a molar pregnancy, or in the events the fetus has no organs or when the body has failed to expell the remains of a stillbirth.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Hospitals provide abortion. Are you going to cut medicaid and Medicare going to them to? Also, most abortion inducing drugs are available for purchase online.

@donnakaye2014 @SenateGOP Wow. You know cars emit carbon emissions. Way to go, short bus.
@TIME This certainly spins the abortion debate on it's head.
@donnakaye2014 @SenateGOP Actually it is damn close. But the emissions aren't going into the atmosphere. They are going into the oceans. They are turning the waters acidic. These oceans by the way, provide EIGHTY percent of the oxygen everyone breathes. So yes. Emissions are everyone's problem.
@donnakaye2014 @SenateGOP This is like saying the kids in the day care in a 1200 foot house don't get exposed to second hand smoke because grandma only smokes in the closet.

Abortion is not done electively as a means to fix birth control failure after 12 weeks in any US state.
@RepBarbaraLee You forgot he ruined EMTALA. That will need repeal too without the ACA.
@SenJohnThune These births are non viable, not elective. That means, lack of skull, lack of organs, missing hearts...you are asking parents already tortured with grief to carry non viable pregnancies to term, so they can see their dying children suffer. I guess that is the GOP way.

@LindseyGrahamSC and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.
@LindseyGrahamSC and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved
@LindseyGrahamSC That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown
@LindseyGrahamSC in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare
@LindseyGrahamSC as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.		We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America

@LindseyGrahamSC magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence
@LindseyGrahamSC We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and
@LindseyGrahamSC Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
@LindseyGrahamSC A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
@LindseyGrahamSC In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury
@LindseyGrahamSC whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions
@LindseyGrahamSC He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,
@LindseyGrahamSC He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands
@LindseyGrahamSC He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation
@LindseyGrahamSC He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people
@LindseyGrahamSC He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us
@LindseyGrahamSC For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever
@LindseyGrahamSC For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments
@LindseyGrahamSC For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies
@LindseyGrahamSC For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
@LindseyGrahamSC For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:		For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:
@LindseyGrahamSC For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world
@LindseyGrahamSC For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
@LindseyGrahamSC giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:		For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us
@LindseyGrahamSC He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws
@LindseyGrahamSC He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.		He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.
@LindseyGrahamSC He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance
@LindseyGrahamSC He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries
@LindseyGrahamSC He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.
@LindseyGrahamSC He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands
@LindseyGrahamSC the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within
@LindseyGrahamSC He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise
@LindseyGrahamSC He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people
@LindseyGrahamSC He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

@LindseyGrahamSC The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States

@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump If you want a wall YOU should pay for it.
@chipcoffey His tactic is an evil one. Desensitize voters to the fact that people, veterans, SS recipients aren't getting paid and they won't care because "they are democrats".

@knowruin @richardbranson @MIT @Stanford @GeorgiaTech @Cambridge_Uni @CoolingPrize China is also lopsided in their gender equality. There are something like 16 men to one woman I beleive because of this policy. They are now also screwed because people are so used to only children that a lot of them are not replenishing the gene pool. Needless to say it works.
@richardbranson @MIT @Stanford @GeorgiaTech @Cambridge_Uni @CoolingPrize The average person releases 11000 tons of carbon the fastest way to stop the planet from warming is to stop people from breeding. Make birth control cheap and accessible.
@business @bopinion This is all the more reason to eat red meat.
@ChrisFixed is it better to replace the control arms with ball joints pre-installed or Just ball joints?

@realDonaldTrump Thanks to all the parents of baby boomers who bred like rabbits for two decades after WWII now that your kids are retiring there are jobs everywhere.
@AuthorKimberley @BrandiLynn4Ever As much as I hate to say it, Trump repealing the 14 gives me hope because that means that everybody born after 1868 is an illegal immigrant and we have to go back to our countries of descent and my case that would be England, they have free healthcare there.
@realDonaldTrump Unless you impregnated every woman of childbearing age between 1945 to 1965 you cannot take credit for how the economy is doing. You really should thank #babyboomers

@jnelson555 @CNNPolitics If those penises are B.O.B then sure.
@CNNPolitics Whiter, Richer, and with more penises.
@realDonaldTrump Next Comes the repeal of EMTALA.
@JoeNBC This bill benefits anyone above 100k. How much does congress make? First Class get lifeboats first.
#taxscambill Remember Titanic? First class to lifeboats first. https://t.co/mHIA0KO2lQ
@CenterOnBudget And themselves. Dont forget. Congress folk make 100k plus a year. Lets be real, they aren't looking out for us. They are looking out for themselves.
@realDonaldTrump The only wall that needs built is around the damn white house.
@realDonaldTrump They are passing the bill because none of them make under 75k a year.
@forbeshealth Do you think patients or doctors for that matter have any clue how medical billing works? No, no they don't.
@businessinsider Of course they do. Congress make above 75k a year. If they made 50k they would never have gone for it. This bill was to help their own taxes. Not us.
@SteveSchmidtSES @ReformedBroker Thank you for finding a reason to celebrate the solctice. Do you think anyone in congress gives a damn? they all make above the 75k bracket this tax bill screws anyone else below 75k. First class gets life boats first.
@PressHerald I hope @SenatorCollins does the right thing and votes no on this disaster.
@BetteMidler @chelseahandler And Nero fiddled while Rome burned...Someone needs to say something. We are at the mercy of a madman.

@ezraklein Yes. It was. Way to lose your millenial vote, Dems. Now we have this big orange buffoon trying to encourage nuclear war in 280 characters or less
@business The president wants to repeal EMTALA, he doesn't care about the people who have to buy these scripts. This pick will likely make it legal to increase prices a thousand fold.
@JoeNBC Did you really expect anything more from someone that has been recorded saying he wants to grab women by the p*ssy?
@realDonaldTrump You do realize you are the president, right? You aren't going on a fame tour.
@chelseahandler Because the Millenials got screwed when they voted for Bernie but got Hillary for a DNC nominee.
@realDonaldTrump That still means 64 percent of USA doesn't like you. That is more than half, Donald. You do, remember math, don't you?
@realDonaldTrump How about not repealing EMTALA so people dont end up dead in the street?
@chelseahandler Thanks to 45, we live in a society where the victims get blamed for rape.
@businessinsider 45 stands for the same thing Roy Moore does. Don't know why they are kidding themselves.
@ezraklein The party is more concerned with how it appears when they were "W-W-Wrong." Case and point: They are willing to look past the point that a republican nominee statutorily raped a 14 year old girl and another nominee who was recorded wanting to grab women by the pussy.
#jewelers can you change an original ring setting from prong to bezel or do you need to get a new setting to do that?
@ProgressOutlook Wait until the republicans repeal EMTALA.

@realDonaldTrump Uh, you've been president for a year. You are just now realizing you won?
@WIRED Just gives 45 even more words to exercise his stupidity.
@realDonaldTrump You slashed funding to mental health clinics is about to repeal EMTALA and is looking to repeal ACA which mandated MH coverage. Seems legit.
@CNNPolitics So he slashed funding to mental health clinics is about to repeal EMTALA and is looking to repeal ACA which mandated MH coverage. Irony.
@CNNPolitics Well then I guess its a great thing they keep defunding access to mental health clinics and are trying to strip mental health insurance!
@CNNPolitics We don't need pictures to see what a moron he is.
@ReformedBroker Because he gets all his info from conspiracy podcasts?
@realDonaldTrump Imaginary friends are not a force field.
@business My engagement ring was a moonstone. My husband and I ruined the wedding industry too. We got married in our back yard. Spent 500 bucks.
@CNNPolitics THIS is exactly why millions of people don't vote. This proves the voters that their votes don't matter BECAUSE the system is rigged.
@realDonaldTrump Would very much appreciate a president not glued to the phone. Don't you have important things to do? #AlerttheDaycareStaff
