Concentrate on the popular vote in the presidential race, not the Electoral College. It’s a waste of time. http://t.co/3IyFKl14
Watch the economy.  The question will be: do voters think Obama will do better or do they trust Romney enough to give him a chance?
This election is about the economy. HC reform was factored into election stock prices as soon as President Obama declared for re-election.
While ACA may have cost Ds their House majority in '10, voters determined opinion on ACA a while ago. Ruling isn't likely to change minds.
It is a major loss when a Pres pushes law that is declared unconst. Having the law affirmed = win. In that respect, this is a win for Obama
