@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Chris, Don is trying so hard to reach you and you are unable to hear him right now.	I hope you reflect on what Don said and watch the segment. She was toying with you and degrading you and you allowed it.  Reflect in private and in conversation with those who love you.
@kylegriffin1 @lfkraus Children are not objects to be used politically.	Dear God, what do you think of us now?
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo So so so disappointed in this tonight.	I had to walk away.	The segment was too long, needless and believe you lost control of it.	Please rethink this ....
