@realDonaldTrump Celebritys are just plain stupid they do evrything wrong and easy to see the stupidity in them they are the one's who should be blamed for the change in America.
@realDonaldTrump People out here wanting to be famous so much because they see all that fake money and not even half paid cars in videos or using someone else's cars you supposed to give positive things this is why america moves like mexico they love money to much and celebrities and rappers
@realDonaldTrump They are here to entertain people and make people happy not go on Presidential https://t.co/dbuMFknLzt can see the stupidity on them when they have expensive cars and like to show off instead of buying alot of cars and making more buissness. Be the good role model you are trash
@realDonaldTrump Ok here is the problem with celebrities they argue back and only want profit out of evrything they dont even care about harming others .they not supposed to argue back to government in first place they supposed to listen and give out love nothing negative listen to government.
@realDonaldTrump You dont want advices from stupid celebrities man who afford expensive stuff just to show off .
@realDonaldTrump Celebritys were included in this .
@realDonaldTrump Social media is bad in both ways for both people it makes people who are hated loved and win with more elections and it infects kids and adults brains. Social media is trash like Instagram is total trash that won the elections most of it and several other websites
@realDonaldTrump I will vote for you man so we can both fix this country.and some some part of the worlds who have connections with us.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah but then theirs those who didn't go waste their time their those are the protesters
@realDonaldTrump Drugs are made 30 percent in Mexico and the other brought from underneath mexico. If mexico works hard on seas and shipment and whatever of transportating goods. Cartels will run low on cash in Mexico for a bit .but theirs also washing of money in mexico so it wont stopthemquic
@realDonaldTrump You need words from a man who will not waste money on expensive things you need a man who will buy alot of cars instead of a lambo you need a man who will rule over countries man trust me i am that man.
@realDonaldTrump Why should white people let blacks work in government if other black countrys dont let a white man go work for them. Ps listen and ignore celebrities trump they like a story you read amd read over again untill you stop reading and get smart .
@realDonaldTrump And social media will try to work against my sayings but thats how they will win peoples brains by posts on social media social media is a weapon it can make people change minds and turn against a race.
@realDonaldTrump One has to rule and its white males because if black men rule they will enslave white males and that cant happen
@realDonaldTrump Trust me if black people really had a dream they would off stopped all that gang stuff you cant negotiate your country its white peoples country or else if you try to stop racism you cant because it wont be correct black people can win or white people can win the spotlight.
@realDonaldTrump You harming your country by giving so many black males work in social mediayour turning your country black soon you white folks be ruled by blacks for giving them spotlight evryone says nigga nowwhat will happen to those left over white people they going get treated bad byblacks
@realDonaldTrump Males should be incharge its makes a male stronger in their brain and they dont go weaker and lazier.
@realDonaldTrump We need to fight for this country white males should be incharge this country or what did you all fight for so some black man as Obama take spotlight for years everyone says nigga now or woman who want more power than males and gangs and corrupted police man.
@realDonaldTrump White Males have to be on control because wtf they faught for then because woman then will have power like it happened with Obama blacks got the spotlight and then everything will go to hell. Like you all faught for this country and then someone else comes and takes over.
@realDonaldTrump More guys are in prison for being accused of rape i am sorry but if woman didn't negotiate every woman wanta to be more than males now and we are like predators we protect our people and fuck to reproduce . woman cant have more power than us we cant be equal
@realDonaldTrump Instagram keeps breaking down on me but not on other people i am not going even https://t.co/D4gIPqmWqV says it cant refresh but i know its them.idc
@realDonaldTrump Donald woman need to chill with showing their body on social media or guys will strart doing that to.
@BetteMidler Lets be fair lets put men vrs woman who will win of course men. We cant change that we will always be at top. Then a different kimd of men who get tired of you all will rule over you all we dont want that
@BetteMidler Hillary was about to be President i think thats alot of opportunity for woman.
@BetteMidler This should be marked as a terrorist threat trying to change America by way of social media readimg peoples minds
@BetteMidler And one has to stay in the house and its the weakest one woman like you can be a bad influence to our society am i right @realDonaldTrump we need to stop these type of celebrities before it gets out of hand with all these protests .like i said monkey see monkey do .
@BetteMidler Working all the time .the less time spended with a husband the less we will love you how will reproduce no more happy love fairytales just fuck and leave and have the kid disabled for getting hurt on the job
@BetteMidler Rule of not hitting woman was made for a reason. Not all woman are brave like you are woman can get sick real quick .how will America run with pregnant woman getting hurt in their jobs getting disabled kids into this wprld how will our armys be weak how will we both be working
@BetteMidler How will a womam produce more soilders for our country if they have to work in construction how will America work with all woman pregnant in their jobs woman can change moods when they are pregnant you girls get sick quicker more resources needed more meds that rule of not
@realDonaldTrump More jons for border patrols and more jobs means a more healthy moving country we need to secure this country because its weak people with money can escape it real quick.with $2000 you can make alot of money in mexico.
@realDonaldTrump All we need to do is put the wall more vigilance in the border more jobs for police more jobs for internet police something like that and jobs for people who will work a healthy social media.amd guess how the wall will help it will stop the profit for cartels in mexicolessprofit
@realDonaldTrump I think real dads should take care of their male kids at a certain age or a young age and well they need more their dad than their mother and well their stepdad cant speak about it with them and well they need a mommy to they have their step mommy and they will be in young age
@realDonaldTrump Trump i think male kids should go with their dad in a separation of family because i say if the dad looks for another woman it will be easier no violence and nothing. And well the kid needs more his dad than his mom to know how live the right way kids suffer .
@realDonaldTrump Its social medias fault for creating caos and it should really be taken off and be redone right.
@realDonaldTrump Its celebrities fault for supporting gangs ,violence,rape,vandalism,robbery,and they all put it in kids and adults head in musicand people copy what celebrities our doing it . all started like that and it went thru video games and stuff check where grand theft 5 takes place
@realDonaldTrump If you put evrything together social media can work to harm the country by voting for someone who will make celebrities and other people do things they want to its not peoples falut its how the government and celebrities our running the country most of it its celebrities fault.
@realDonaldTrump People keep supporting trump dont listen to social media and news and people who lie they all want to make profit out of a none working correctly country you can see nothing is right now to much protests and most of them have celebrities included their fault.
@realDonaldTrump Whatever you do dont take away the vigilance in the border and the walls the Mexican government is weak where i live one of the most wanted in matamoros was released back again into the streets. Amd he is wanted in America.
@kanyewest I profit either ways i make so much money loosing and winning .untill someone kills me i wont be profiting but someone else will take my job just like me .
@kanyewest Look if you really wanted to change America in ways you could actually help  be less gangs less nudity less prostitution less robberys. no celebrity should be allowed to speak for the country or else its like washing peoples minds. @realDonaldTrump keep his mouth ahut
@kanyewest Stop trying to make people sleep i never agreed to no government in first place .
@SnoopDogg @fatbellybella Dont listen to kanye he clearly stupid we all under slavery right now government has easier chance in survival.but you all celebrities you all dont see it to https://t.co/YSWxpn7sDa mexico theirs no cops amd theirs running stores and things.
@realDonaldTrump Pants cost $1000. You need to lower that soon evrything will be expensive .
@realDonaldTrump Yeah you just bringing in more money but not taking away people who do fraud and shit whats the point you just making them richer.and you need to cut people's bullshit about pamta costing about $1000 dollars thats bullshit all that will bring America down.
@realDonaldTrump Either way you listen to me or you dont.soon this vountry will stop working well. about social media and famous people being bad influences for kids and people and internet was made wrong and take it off. Same thing happend in mexico good luck
@realDonaldTrump Mexico is a free country why you think criminals live in it they get tired of beimg pushed around in the u.s. while govermen in the u.s is rich in money and we live equal in Mexico
@realDonaldTrump Trust me no police in Mexico and its cool of you learn to survive their and if you friends of evryone and you respect evryone you live normal
@realDonaldTrump People when i went to mexico i saw no police were at all the country amd buissnes where still running and then only soilders would go once in a while i felt so free when i came im into the u.s i still felt free.untill i stayed a little bit in the u.s not to much freedom

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And it's true what i say because you dont see Americans singing mexican rap all the time .all i hear in them is related to black people they got the spotlight and still they dont want to change the world .
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews America is moving to fast social media was not created right.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Its like if your spoiling them .they over here on social media showing no respect gang violations being bad examples .and while trump can just put more watch on the border and end of Mexican problem .deal with those who are making money out of unfinished things America is moving
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Look all races say nigga black people got the spotlight evryone talks like them already that was the big dream they all dreamed about.and they over here breaking rules and stuff look it doesn't matter if they are not always picked it runs on luck simple as that if you pick them

@realDonaldTrump And no one can come from Mexico without permission from cartels and government you have to pay both of them thats how thwy make profit to evrything is for profit they work on money.i would of been millionaire long time ago but i cant learn in words i can only see and hear.
@realDonaldTrump And it works like this American money is worth more in Mexican money thats how cartels feed from. we need to secure the border.and we need to stop these deals from touching each other .
@realDonaldTrump All we need to do is secure the border and put more watch on the border and more vigilance .and a wall and stop from cartels getting their deals in the u.s and then cartels will have no more funds and we will win we will all win a i am a secret spy i work for my self.
@realDonaldTrump Now social media supports gangs and bad influences and the bad thing in the internet is infected with songs and bad things we need to get rid of technology and remake it agin the proper way.your technology was created wrong like social media it infects people like a virus.
@realDonaldTrump Blacks where the one's who started buying drugs from Mexicans why fight another country whwn we can still secure the border and try help out each other and combat the gangs and cartels inside each other's country's
@realDonaldTrump Society is now controlled by social media and is a virus to our society whoever who invented it should be in a jail for making something that would change the world so bad.evryone now says nigga thats how bad blacks have spotlight over the world.they all got the power of social
@realDonaldTrump We need to stop the infection of bad influences on social media people use social media to much try to control it by making it better .people use it for bad things and show off now. People will listen if we put posts a specific way to reas people's minds.but not to much reading

@realDonaldTrump Their is just something wrong with their head if thats changing their brain to go get a girl or a boy .what makes you think they dont do other wrong things .lgbt
@realDonaldTrump Groups like lgbt are a risk to society we cant let these riots and groups continue .evrything can get out of hand. you never know they might be trying built this group to go free government or to riots to destroy people.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah i know we must secure and prevent from people crossing the border
@thecjpearson We have to run a country not destroy it .
@thecjpearson Look its not illegals fault instead of fighting and blaming illegals for their deaths you need to to straighten up and help the president with goood ideas not bad negative stuff like that .
@realDonaldTrump Theirs a check point but thats about it theirs not that many border patrols
@realDonaldTrump . We do need to protect the borders.And trump people cross swimming in la boca del rio the end of southern border thats one of the main crossing point and its not even being watched by government the river is not being watched in all that side of the border around the beach area
@realDonaldTrump Its time to change all the gang stuff and cartel stuff no more of that i want that all gone i want to live good without gangs and cartel related stuff.
@realDonaldTrump And if Mexico says theirs no corruption its a lie.They just let out a main cartel del golfo member in matamoros couple months ago.dont let the mexicans get mixed up with Americans.
@realDonaldTrump I got you some information.cartels are working like this on the southern border of texas cartels are now asking for money for mexicans to crossover to the united states. So people who crossover mexicans into the united states are cartel memebers.or related
@realDonaldTrump These certified people are a bad example for people. Secure more technology it is a fragile thing if you dont use technology fully formed and correct alot of stuff can hapen.
@realDonaldTrump Trump theirs to many celebrities and certified people who are bullying people for not having money and trying to speak for evrybody and many other things they are doing giving fake information giving bad examples to people writing aongs that are disturbing and doing bad stuff.
@Quincy Hey what tattoo should i get next.

@realDonaldTrump @g7 Dont let people create groups because you never know maybe they trying to create a rebelism group to destroy America.
@realDonaldTrump @g7 Get people into the group.people you can only trust.
@realDonaldTrump @g7 The only things is to create a group were we can correct the rules by violating rules of not violating rules. Things get out of hand only that can save us.
@realDonaldTrump @g7 Things got out hand with social media and rules that were let out by the government you cant put them back right or people and celebrities will work together for the government to not get things off .give celebrities and certified people less power.
@realDonaldTrump It was never the drugs it was your corrupted golddinging government workers  but it was also some fault of mexicans but its was most fault of certified and celebrities and rappers for promoting what is not legal.
@realDonaldTrump Believe it or not most of the certified people and celebrities and rappers were the ones to screw this country up. And you over here doing business with celebrities to get people out of jail.
@kanyewest Goes bad.
@kanyewest Kanye look. This is important. Everyone back then when their was no social media people were more wise and respectful now its hell some famous people should no be famous they are not wise we need the wise ones to spread the love and show the other ones what to do beforeevrything
@realDonaldTrump @fema America is moving to fast that they dont see their mistakes on social media .all they want is money while they really dont care about the rest.

@realDonaldTrump @CortesSteve Trump i am tired of feminism trying to take over men its like we cant do anything no more.and they put here posting half naked pictures on Instagram and if we do something like that its rape. We cant do anything please dont let feminism get in mens way we got freedom to.
@realDonaldTrump @CortesSteve Consequences,peace and love to those who desobey /peace,love and affection to those who obey.
@realDonaldTrump @CortesSteve Evrything government related and technology and weapons should be more watched than ever so the government can work the right way.
@realDonaldTrump @CortesSteve Let people run up some tests first to test their mentality how good their brain is. And cameras will be put at the testing sight.
@realDonaldTrump Hope she gets better.
@realDonaldTrump @CortesSteve Fith option build up an extra software on people and do a background checks if they are capable of owning a weapon check if they are mature and firm to own a gun. Well thats it civilians dont need more than 2 guns or 1 we have the military to protect and police.
@realDonaldTrump @CortesSteve Third option when someone wants to buy a weapon ask what they going need it for and if they say the correct answer on what you think they need it for is good go ahead but has to be aproved by government to. Fourth option limitation on weapons you can only own 1 ,2 and  3
@realDonaldTrump @CortesSteve First option guns should be taken away .But of course that be much to much work. Second option build up a company and check on people who have guns they need a checkout if they still have that weapon probably each month or even twice a month which ever suits you.Third option
