@chandreasliger @davidaxelrod @POTUS Wow you seem really upset. All i asked was what did President Trump lie about. Everything you keep sending is just a left-leaning mud sling. and Fyi, there has been zero evidence of Russian collusion... Shepard Smith is entitled to his own opinion.
@chandreasliger @davidaxelrod @POTUS not sure what religion has to do with it. Your sources are left-leaning. much of it is opinion-based without backup. what millions of American voters see is a president who is continually keeping promises.

@Momthra @quartnaz @QShell_e @Melinda_McGraw @TWA2Jenny @SenJohnKennedy Enforce the law. Heed the warnings received from various sources. Investigate. Help that sick young man so he isn‚Äôt a danger to himself or others. Could have done many things in my opinion.
@quartnaz @QShell_e @Melinda_McGraw @Momthra @TWA2Jenny @SenJohnKennedy Obama and Eric Holder gave federal grant money to broward sheriff Dept to make fewer arrests of delinquent youth. They visited the shooter 39 times and knew about this. They did nothing. They caused the deaths of the 17 students.
