"Not one question so far has been asked about Mr. Trump," says Cohen, who is clearly willing to discuss what he knows about Trump's taxes and financial dealings.
can we get back to the parts about a) Trump dealings in Russia, b) exactly how many times and for how much Cohen participated in catch-and-kill stories and other payouts to women, c) the thing where Trump uses "others" to inflict physical threats against his enemies ...?
Cohen mentions in his evidence that Stewart Rahr was the guy he got to make the phony"purchase" of Trump's' portrait at a charity auction, a $60K deal. Rahr is a total (some might say sleazy) character ... Read about him in this great 2013 @forbes feature. https://t.co/e79xte9Dhf https://t.co/jUIkG5rUe6

FWIW, @FLOTUS office will not return request for comment on Cohen's statement about this testimony and his actions involving Melania Trump. Cohen reportedly attempted to apologize to Melania at a Mar-a-Lago event in 2018 for his actions involving paying off Stormy Daniels.
Cohen on @FLOTUS: "He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly – and she did not deserve that."

i find it inherently sexist that this piece implies a woman shouldn't change her hair when she feels like it. "It is very unusual for a First Lady, or a woman politician for example, to make this drastic a change to her hair — it risks suggesting instability or excess vanity."

Also, to be clear, I’m not saying any of their answers should be one thing or the other — that’s not my place. All I’m saying is if we’re going to put pressure on female senators, that seems grossly unfair and ignorant of the current climate of recalibration.
I feel like holding two female senators to higher stakes/scrutiny about their votes because they are female is perpetuating the blatant divide between male and female. Why aren’t we scrutinizing all of the senators? Like, where has @BenSasse been the last two weeks?
Asked if he rejected a one on one meeting at #UNGA with @JustinTrudeau, @realDonaldTrump responds: “Yeah.”
“I’ve always said women are smarter than men,” @realDonaldTrump
This is the unfiltered, fighting mad version of Donald Trump, the one that the people who voted for him like best.

@gjgordo It’s not a film festival. And don’t call me darling, it’s sexist and condescending. My point was deeper, about Remnick upholding his word, not hiding behind those who dropped out, &amp; perhaps being strong enough to make his stance months before when he invited Bannon.

And then: 'The point of an interview, a rigorous interview, particularly in a case like this, is to put pressure on the views of the person being questioned.'
cont'd:  'He knew that our politics could not be more at odds––he reads The New Yorker––but he said he would do it when he had a chance. It was only later that the idea arose of doing that interview in front of an audience.
Part of David Remnick's letter to staff: The effort to interview Bannon at length began many months ago. I originally reached out to him to do a lengthy interview with “The New Yorker Radio Hour.”
I think maybe it's bad form to disinvite someone you say you worked for months to interview at length. If you found the subject viable for a long interview in your publication, on your radio program, at your festival -- changing that because celebrities have dropped out seems odd https://t.co/hNV2POhJIt

Pageants or the young women who compete in them. I know her future is incredibly bright and I just wanted to take a minute to honor her and the work she has done this year, in spite of the sad and unfortunate obstacles. She has handled them with grace and poise. 👏🏻
And that sucks. I hope she rises above the drama, and I hope she is given a chance to air her feelings about Ms. Hopper and @GretchenCarlson. I can’t say enough good things about Cara, and how she changed my mind about every stereotype I ever might have had about
that it would have mattered. Anyway, I feel it is imperative that I say how wonderful and smart and special Cara is in light of the treatment she has received in the past several months as @MissAmerica with new leadership. She has been a victim in a rebranding
system in order to earn the thousands of dollars in scholarship month the organization provide. She was smart, funny, real, thoughtful, had a passion for non-profit work and women’s empowerment and she was not overly concerned with her looks or her physique, not
Both good and bad. She had interned on Capitol Hill and she was accepted to @NotreDame for law school, though she deferred after she won so that she could serve her time as @MissAmerica. She is also the first miss America from North Dakota, and had climbed through the pageant
I like to think I had a lot to do with selecting Cara Mund as the current @MissAmerica. She is smart, a rare (for the organization) Ivy League graduate (from @BrownUniversity), she was articulate on a range of topics, had a very clear grasp of politics and the state of the world
Please let me vent about this: Last year I was a preliminary judge at the @MissAmerica competition in Atlantic City and it was a fascinating and very positive experience for me, going into it having had zero experience or association with pageants ... https://t.co/GdUOWXsMcF

To be clear, @FLOTUS was in attendance at the event, sitting in the front row as @realDonaldTrump gave remarks.
"Did she leave him?" @realDonaldTrump jokes about the rumors surrounding @FLOTUS's lengthy absence from public view. A sort of awkward bit of humor in a room full of military families who have lost loved ones.

@justincap_ @JGreenDC He asked what was the worse Memorial Day take — I’m calling out th ppl who are guilty of this rudeness.
@ArgoJournal @FLOTUS @jeffzeleny I appreciate and understand the instinct, especially with this White House, to leap to conclusions and suspicions, but I would never want to speculate about a woman's health or how she and her doctors handle an ailment, or a recovery.
@ArgoJournal @FLOTUS @jeffzeleny Additionally, clearly, what is indicated is in fact the severity of her embolization, which often reflects the size and scope of the ailment (again, something we don't know), is likely indicative of *not* something minor.
@ArgoJournal @FLOTUS @jeffzeleny Jeff said "generally an outpatient procedure," which could be true if one would be able to assess her specific case. The reports from multiple outlets were going off of speculation, again, not the info provided.
@ArgoJournal @FLOTUS I'll wait.
@ArgoJournal @FLOTUS I would like to know where you got “a minor outpatient procedure that didn’t require hospitalization”? From speculating medical professionals who knew nothing of her specific case? I report. I don’t make up. I go by the facts. Also, I BROKE the story of her hospital release.
@ArgoJournal @FLOTUS How do you know what the procedure was “supposed to be”? She had an embolization and her office at the time said she would “likely remain [in hospital] for the duration of the week,” which certainly doesn’t sound minor to me.

I think the narrative of "why wasn't @realDonaldTrump by @FLOTUS side?!"means people haven't been paying enough attn to the independence Melania exerts in her role/in the marriage. Just like he didn't "send her in his place" to B Bush's funeral. This is a @FLOTUS who calls shots.
@loisromano @maggieNYT I'm sure he was aware how serious. But here's the thing: people keep assuming that POTUS gets to make the decisions where @FLOTUS is concerned. I wld have thought by now we would understand that is not the case. This is an independent @FLOTUS, v private. He knows the boundaries.
Having covered @FLOTUS and her world for more than a year, it is not surprising to me that her office has pulled off something as major as this news without a leak — it’s interesting to think of this juxtaposed with the situation in the West Wing.

Tillerson noticeably did not thank @realDonaldTrump, who he said called him at noon today. Trump's tweet announcing Tillerson was out happened just before 9:00AM.
"I'll now return to private life, as a private citizen, as a proud American..." Rex Tillerson, before leaving the podium.
"Russia must assess carefully ... continuing on their current trajectory will likely lead to greater isolation on their part," Tillerson addresses Russia directly.
"Nothing is possible without allies and partners, though," says Tillerson.
Mentions Mattis, Dunford, military, State Department staff ... but no hasn't said anything acknowledging Trump by name nor "the president."
"We remain steadfast here in Washington, and in posts around the world," Tillerson reminds his inter-agency colleagues.
@EliStokols sounds out of breath.
Midnight, March 31st, that's when Tillerson says he'll end his tenure as Secretary of State.
