@JonMurray Unless they uphold the Third Circuit. In which case the workers will lose.
And needless to say, it sort of undercuts NJ Transit's aggressive recruiting effort on the rail side. Who would want to work at a place where workplace injury protections aren't guaranteed? And there are other railroads who pay more.
This is an incredibly vexing issue. If the legislature doesn't act, and the governor doesn't support its action, this could well wind up at the U.S. Supreme Court.
Murphy campaigned as a friend of organized labor, but it isn't clear where his administration stands on NJ Transit's legal approach. His attorney general's office has been defending the agency in federal court.
Here's the latest story for @northjersey: https://t.co/u6Hw5UTPAd https://t.co/LkPDJGeviQ
A former @NJTRANSIT compliance chief warned state lawmakers a year ago that the agency was asserting immunity from lawsuits in federal court, but they declined to address the issue in an overhaul bill @GovMurphy signed in December. Now, injured railroad workers are in limbo.

It's probably good to note that PTC would not have made any difference in the West Virginia release, because it was a failure of the tank car. Eight injuries were reported, and no one died. But make no mistake: A 178,400-pound chlorine release could have been deadly.
Though we usually think of passenger trains when it comes to positive train control, one of the catalysts for the PTC mandate was a derailed chlorine car that leaked in a 2005 derailment in South Carolina. Nine people died from chlorine exposure. https://t.co/G8OAgjTFYr https://t.co/E6O9bRzInt

@ArchiJake @faizsays They've been laying track all this time on the least expensive part of the project. Now it's hard to see how the costly mountain crossings at both ends will ever get built.
@ArchiJake @faizsays Further, it would essentially dead end at Bakersfield. There hasn't been regular passenger service through the Tehachapi Mountains toward Los Angeles since 1971. There's only one way in and out by train, via Sacramento.
@ArchiJake @faizsays The Central Valley has a population of about 6.5 million in a linear cluster of smaller cities such as Fresno, Bakersfield, Merced and Stockton. It's hard to envision how much utility HSR will have within the region when Amtrak already serves it from one end to the other.

If the answer is yes, let me say: Good luck. You might need it.
I have to ask: Does anyone really think the absence of a free, independent and robust press will make their lives and or their families’ any better?
What products or policies will deep-pocketed, well-connected  interests push without anyone to ask whether they’re in the public interest? What abuses of power by powerful institutions will never come to light?
What forces with an ideological agenda to push will fill the void? What public officials with loose ethics will take something that doesn’t belong to them, and worse still, get away with it?
It’s simply exhausting hearing about journalists who were laid off or soon might be. What important subjects won’t be covered because if it? What decisions will voters make that would have been different had they had the right information?

@danvock Some of it is wrapped in a religious fervor, even in the public schools.
@danvock In a good bit of the country, and not just in the South, there seems to be an aversion to teaching a more nuanced version of U.S. history. If it’s not a flag-waving, positive portrait of America, it simply doesn’t fly.
@danvock You mean accurate?
@danvock It’s not consistent across the board.
@NJtoNYC I see nothing new.
These students shouldn’t have to wait until they’re in college to learn about the displacement and slaughter of Native Americans, of slavery, segregation and lynching, of the Chinese Exclusion Act, or the detention of Japanese Americans. Teach them early, when it really counts. https://t.co/A5QxRhsMYz
Who are we kidding? If we don’t teach our young people the unvarnished history of how Native Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans and Japanese Americans, among others, were treated in this country, why should we be surprised when they embarrass us? Shame on us.

America’s symphony orchestras and newspapers have this in common: They’re cultural treasures, and we’d be worse off without them. But they also have this in common: a shrinking, aging audience.

Part of the trick of white supremacy is that it allows folks to care about social justice struggles in other parts of the world before confronting what actually happened within these shores. https://t.co/IDioDz7f3J
@brian4NY They're not treated that way, and not just in the South, either. I've seen Confederate flags on front porches within 200 miles of the Canadian border.
Ugh: 'Today, public and private institutions in the South memorialize the Confederacy and celebrate the architects of white supremacy while remaining conspicuously silent about the terror, violence, and loss of life inflicted on black Americans during the same historical period.'
'The community voice remains silent as to Marianna’s other legacies. No prominent memorial or marker tells of Claude Neal’s brutal lynching, and that silence is deafening.'
A dear friend's Florida hometown: 'In 2014, Marianna celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Marianna by honoring the memories of Confederate soldiers and officers who fought and died to preserve slavery and the white supremacist ideologies on which slavery was built.'
I'm frankly disgusted, not that these things happened before my time, but that we are so reluctant to talk about them in my lifetime. There's no damn good reason.
'There has been no significant effort to confront white Southerners with the damage done by lynching or to facilitate recovery, and we live with the lingering legacies of that inaction.'
More from @eji_org: 'Generations of white people were raised in communities where myths of racial superiority dominated and went largely unchallenged. Many of those people hold powerful positions today.'
This, frankly, ought to be required reading for every high-school and college student in the country. If they don't learn this, they have an incomplete understanding of American history. https://t.co/AmCsdDBIOG
Top Kentucky counties for lynchings, 1877-1950, include Todd, the birthplace of Jefferson Davis. They also include Fayette, home of Lexington, today the commonwealth's second-most populous city.	Fulton	Logan	Todd	Graves	Shelby	McCracken	Boone	Fayette	Henderson	Henry	Mason	Warren
To put this another way, Kentucky was one of the five worst states to be a black person after the Civil War. This, in spite of the commonwealth remaining in the Union. Somehow, I never remember learning about this in high school or college.

If God needed someone to manage the payroll, heaven’s human resources department could recruit no better candidate.		Word gets around, you know.
She enjoyed watching football, eating chocolates and cracking jokes, right until the last few weeks of her life.		If you believe in the life after, no doubt she’s doing those very things right now.
Ann experienced her own difficulties with her health and mobility. But nothing robbed her of her powerful memories, her strong opinions and cutting humor.
She took on an enormous task at a time when most couples their age were busy enjoying retirement and grandchildren. She stayed by his side until the end.
Ann spent years caring for her husband, Roger. First, as he fought cancer in midlife, then in later years as he gradually slipped away to Alzheimer’s.
By the time Ann held her young great-granddaghter, she could no longer offer material things. She’d become frail. But a loving embrace she could still give.
Ann plied her grandchildren and nephews and niece with Christmas gifts and birthday cards stuffed with money and showered them with love and affection.
When Roger first brought home Y Lan, his future wife and mother of his children, Jettie liked her immediately. Ann didn’t always value Jettie’s opinion. But this one meant something.
Ann depended on Jettie to watch young Roger when he came home from school. Roger learned a great deal from his grandmother, inspiring his four-decade career teaching history.
There was that time the neighbor’s cows broke through the fence and started feasting on Jettie’s flowers. Phone in one hand, rifle in the other, Ann took care of business.
Jettie Dees Tate depended on her daughter-in-law. For doctor’s visits. For trips to Texas to see her relatives. For that color TV set she watched with the volume turned up so loud, you could hear it from the mailbox.
Now, the part where she lived with her mother-in-law. Two strong-willed Southern women under one roof? What could go wrong? Well, plenty.		Though they sometimes clashed, they worked as a team in other ways.
When her eyes got wide, as if to say, ‘don’t come for me,’ you best didn’t. 		No matter your social standing, she’d put you in your place before you even knew what hit you.
She wasn’t as gentle, though, when it came to protecting her loved ones, be they her parents, her brothers and sister, her husband, her mother-in-law, her son or her grandchildren. Those who crossed her did so at their own risk.
Sure, it might be your clothes, your hair, your weight or your career choices. But it was never meant to hurt your feelings.
She was a mother, a grandmother, a great-grandmother, a sister and an aunt.		Annie Lou Reeves Tate had a biting wit. If you found yourself on the receiving end of it, you weren’t alone. A gentle insult became an expression of love.
A caregiver to her mother-in-law for 26 years. A caregiver to her husband for 57 years		The planner and host of family gatherings, with lots of cars in the driveway, where everyone was well-fed, in good times and bad.
She earned the trust of one company so much managing the payroll that another one hired her by reputation after the first went out of business.
Like many women in postwar America, she went to work. She worked hard for the income to pay for college tuition, cars, vacations and Christmas presents.
Ann caught one of the two most eligible bachelors in town. (Roger’s brother, Thomas, was the other.)
Like many women in postwar America, she fell for and married a handsome war hero. Together, Ann and Roger Tate looked like young Hollywood movie stars.
She was the daughter of an electrician and a homemaker and one of five siblings, four of whom lived past childhood and three of whom still live.
She was a guardian. An unflinching protector of who and what she loved.		She was part of a sturdy generation who came up in depression and war.
If I may take the opportunity to pay tribute to my paternal grandmother, Annie Lou Reeves Tate, February 8, 1931 - December 17, 2018

Fortunately for them, anti-Chinese racism in the West enabled the South to impose Jim Crow on supposedly free citizens for almost a century. The Chinese Exclusion Act kept Chinese out of America, and Jim Crow kept blacks out of white spaces. ‘Lost Cause’ my eye.
The logic behind it is so incredibly flimsy. If it wasn’t about slavery, then why did these same states fight like the dickens to impose pseudo-slavery for the next 100 years?
