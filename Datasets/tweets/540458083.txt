T9: Flint was entirely preventable. All lead exposure is preventable. Invest in primary prevention. Our kids are worth it.	 #abcdrbchat
T8: strengthening of lead and copper rule, need public disclosure of lead-based plumbing	 #abcdrbchat
T7: water sampling by states can minimize lead. loopholes in the lead and copper rule do not protect children. #abcdrbchat
T7: "Plumbing" comes from the latin for "lead." It was always the plumbing. #abcdrbchat
T7: Flint switched to a more corrosive water source with NO corrosion control. Lead leached from plumbing. #abcdrbchat
T6: Tx is educational, nutritional, and health support. #abcdrbchat
T5 lead poisoning is often never diagnosed. Missed peak lead levels. half life of lead is only 28 days. #abcdrbchat
T4: if you see symptoms, it's too late. Need to focus on primary prevention. #abcdrbchat
T4: lead poisoning is largely asymptomatic. #abcdrbchat
T1 lead is a soluble metal. Lead in water is only form of lead exposure that is in a vehicle  made to be ingested - water. #abcdrbchat
