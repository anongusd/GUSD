The previous four administrations did absolutely nothing to fix the North Korean problem over the past three decades.

@qello2525 @SharylAttkisson If you don't think there is Ruling Class firmly embedded in DC, and in the Intelligence Community more specifically, both of whom are unequivocal about their intellectual and moral superiority over us heathens, there's not much I can do for you. See: Sharyl's battle with the DOJ.
I think @JonahNRO is a pretty erudite guy.  But unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) for him, his only memorable legacy will be his dog videos. Sorry, Jonah, but teaming up with @stephenfhayes was the last straw. https://t.co/RK6XS04GTB
@SharylAttkisson The Deep State has many tentacles, and they're unbounded by geography. Dislodging them may get ugly, but it must be done.
