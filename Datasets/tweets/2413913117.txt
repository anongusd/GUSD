@tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein Climate Change can be enacted on a smaller scale in communities and homes instead of sweeping resolutions that require enormous amounts of funding.   Regulations should be reinstated on factories that pump pollutants into the air.

@tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein Maybe what the parents should do is read and compare both resolutions and then explain to their kids how a bill is passed in Congress.  Children should be taught to respect their elders and listen to someone with experience not gang up on her.
