#cowboys Rob Ryan is a fraud http://t.co/gOcAoY89 i agree, but the blame for #dallas collapse goes to the owner, who put this team together
Good news for the #cowboys: they can only lose 3 more games, then it's back to their regular offseason optimism. #firejerryjones
More great clock management by Garrett. Rob Ryan is the #1 overrated coach of the year. #firejerryjones
And here it comes. Another monumental debacle by the #cowboys. IF they make it to the playoffs, it'll be one-and-out. #firejerryjones
#cowboys can't stop anyone when it counts. we'll see what they do here. Plenty of time to blow this game!
