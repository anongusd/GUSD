California Gov. Gavin Newsom pledges unemployment benefits to furloughed federal workers in the state — and hammers Trump again https://t.co/pzLNkB6g35
This is the kind of budget that all Californians should be proud to support -- especially our hardworking families and immigrant communities.
"Gavin Newsom's bold budget is proof of his refreshing, innovative outlook on California -- a California that protects the rights of its residents and offers them the resources to thrive and can achieve both social justice and economic prosperity.
CDP Acting Chair Alex Rooker today lauded Gov. Newsom's proposed budget, saying, "As a Party that stands for civil justice, minority rights, healthcare, and equal opportunity, CDP is thrilled to see Gov. Newsom draw up a budget that truly speaks to the needs of all Californians.

12. I care deeply about all of our staff and volunteers and my heart aches to know that any may have suffered harassment or abuse. https://t.co/zu453vUp6I
11. I want to reemphasize that as acting Chair my foremost concern is the safety and well-being of CDP employees and the larger Democratic community. https://t.co/r1Jg4yohma
10. For example, as acting Chair, I am continuing to oversee the preparations for the Assembly District Election Meetings and working with the Governor-elect, Senate President pro Tem, and the Speaker of the Assembly on the transition. https://t.co/y75Usqnu6y
9. I have no intention of seeking to be elected as Chair and will be focused on keeping the Party working on its normal day-to-day activities until a new Chair is selected. https://t.co/lSGuvMEb3W
8. In the coming days, we will release a detailed statement with a clear plan for an election for Chair, likely during the May CDP Convention, as outlined by our By-Laws. https://t.co/yACXxQMjMP
7. With respect to the transition and succession of the Chair of the CDP in the wake of Mr. Bauman’s resignation, I will be acting Chair until a new Chair is selected by party delegates as per CDP by-laws. https://t.co/q2WNRQeLeL
6. In addition, we are setting up a centralized hotline and e-mail account for any individual to report any claims of harassment, assault, or other misconduct he or she has experienced or witnessed.  Only Ms. Vierra and her colleagues will have access to these accounts. https://t.co/OzkGew8mn9
5. Upon completion, Vierra will provide final report to outside employment counsel, Ms. Schrick. A summary of findings will be released publicly, &amp; a report, containing appropriate anonymization &amp; redactions of identifying information, will be provided to CDP’s Executive Board. https://t.co/6YmjyVQJTQ
4. Ms. Vierra is an experienced investigator; she has conducted over 250 workplace investigations and she was retained to investigate any and all complaints against Mr. Bauman.  This investigation is currently underway and will continue despite Mr. Bauman’s resignation. https://t.co/rXTpK9ZxrJ
3. Based on Ms. Schrick’s guidance and recommendation, Ms. Vrattos retained Debra Hinshaw Vierra of Churchwell White LLP as an independent investigator. https://t.co/mtEPg1x2VD
2. With respect to allegations of workplace misconduct against Mr. Bauman, the CDP’s Director of Human Resources, Amy Vrattos, contacted the CDP’s longstanding employment counsel, Shaye Schrick of Delfino, Madden, O'Malley, Coyle and Kowler LLP. https://t.co/9iLrdEKsP8
Statement on Bauman Resignation:		1. As acting Chair of @CA_Dem, it's my responsibility to see that we continue to investigate the allegations that led to the resignation of Bauman as chair.

@LWVC @CommonCauseCA @DarakaKenric @CALPIRG @HenrySternCA @hertzieLA @BenAllenCA 9. One important takeaway... Though he voted yes today, @HertzieLA seemed on the fence — and said the bill may need changes — because of calls from constituents. He said he got "about a billion" of 'em on #AB84.		You never know how a vote's going to go, but ALWAYS make that call.

3. Or want to work with a specific constituency? We continue to grow our Community Engagement Program; with organizers who'll partner with the African American, AAPI, Latinx, millennial, and rural communities.		https://t.co/akZEbPZAE9
2. We've had staff on the ground for over a year, all over the state. And we're adding more...		...like a Regional Organizer in the Bay Area:		https://t.co/J47BcEIKs5		Interested? No somebody who would be? Apply or share this post! Let's go out and win together!!
1. So much energy! We get loads of emails, DMs, walk-ins, calls, texts, and every other way of reaching out to ask about coming aboard for our final push to the Nov. 6th election.		Want to join the @CA_Dem team? Check out https://t.co/U9bVAS43PD for current openings!
