Multiple admin sources were telling Hill reporters early this morning that the Speaker Pelosi delegation was flying commercially https://t.co/hf9c6N0NqP
Whether here or abroad, the Speaker always thanks our troops, diplomats and intelligence community for their heroism &amp; service.  The Speaker commends her colleagues on the delegation, who personally &amp; officially have dedicated their lives to protect &amp; defend the American people.
In light of the grave threats caused by the President’s action, the delegation has decided to postpone the trip so as not to further endanger our troops and security personnel, or the other travelers on the flights.
This morning, we learned that the Administration had leaked the commercial travel plans as well.
In the middle of the night, State Dept's Diplomatic Security Service provided an updated threat assessment detailing that the President announcing this sensitive travel had significantly increased danger to the delegation &amp; to troops, security, &amp; other officials supporting trip.
After President Trump revoked the use of military aircraft to travel to Afghanistan, the delegation was prepared to fly commercially to proceed with this vital trip to meet with our commanders and troops on the front lines.
The United States Congress is a co-equal branch of government in our system of checks and balances. The Congress has a constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight in the war zone where our men and women in uniform are risking their lives every day.

Republicans are also beginning their mark-ups without any estimates from the nonpartisan CBO on health care costs &amp;  coverage (1/2)
Original House bill was posted online for 30 days before first Committee began their mark up &amp; more than 100 days before the tri-committees
House spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 bipartisan witnesses, considered 239 amdts &amp; accepted 121 amdts when ACA passed
