@kimba__what @cmclymer Well not so fast.  The average age of the Resistance was 52, and mostly college educated women - and it attracted a lot of independent women that we needed to win.   Be careful of this ageism that is sprouting up.
@cmclymer I know but we need them.  We want them on our side.  Many people my age have switched parties or voted for candidates from both parties. Tribalism is new and I think damaging.
@cmclymer A lot of these supposed blue states are not so blue always. MA where I grew up consistently elects a GOP governor (remember Mitt, part 1). The NY state senate was controlled by GOP for most of the 20th century &amp; til 2018.  The purity tests will kill us. We want them on our side.
@cmclymer Love you first.  We would have won about 10 fewer seats in 2018 if we didn‚Äôt have college women switch to vote Dem.  I‚Äôm older than you (53) and before the recent tribalism, it was not unusual for people to vote for both parties.  A lot of states incl NY were purple until 2018.

I dunno - first the all white GOP men for the Kavanaugh hearings needing to bring in a woman to do the questioning, and then the House doing the same to cover for race - maybe another solution is to stop being a sexist, racist party and run women and PoC.
I think the biggest shocker of today is that Rep Cummings counts Rep Meadows among his closest friends in the House.

In so many ways this feels like a Reichstag moment: Trump shutting down our government with no end in sight over a manufactured crisis at our border. He has no empathy for people who are suffering. He sees it as a way to grab power and control. The GOP is allowing it.

Putin didn‚Äôt pick Trump because he thought Trump was a great man - just the opposite. Russia profiled Trump and realized he would sell out our country for his own self-interests. He was a pliable contact who could easily be bought and blackmailed.
People need to remember:  Putin‚Äôs goal is not to help Republicans and Trump.  Their goal is to undermine our democracy and lower our world standing - to hurt the American people.  They are succeeding because the GOP is going along and cooperating for short-term gain.
Rather remarkable that the Republicans - the ones who didn‚Äôt already run for the exits in 2018 - remain silent as Trump continues to undermine our government and hurt the American people - even as it is likely they have much more info than is public about Trump‚Äôs Russia ties.

This is also the 3rd shutdown started in 2018. Trump keeps pushing boundaries further and further to see what he can get away with.  And of course he has no empathy for people impacted.  It inures to his benefit when things don‚Äôt function - helps him to consolidate power.
What‚Äôs clear is Trump can‚Äôt govern. There is no plan - it‚Äôs one man‚Äôs unilateral decisions. It‚Äôs also clear that there is no one left who will say no, and the inexperience and incompetence of the people who remain should concern us all.  It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre waiting for the explosion.

@MrRodgers16 And waiting for his next proclamation via Twitter - it‚Äôs like being in an abusive relationship for our country.  We are always helplessly waiting on edge for what is coming our way next.
And finally, not only has Trump wounded the notion of truth at home which has dangerous consequences, he has also betrayed our allies and alliances in the most brutal and humiliating of ways. The world stage has shifted. Who will trust us? This will take decades to repair.	6/
Our country is angry and anxious and exhausted. Russia is delighted. Our elected official whine as they depart, but many were traitors and others who remain refuse to uphold their oath and put country first by standing up to broken norms and adversaries who seek to destroy us.	5/
Our federal agencies have been neglected for 2 years - they are unstaffed or staffed with insiders whose role is to deconstruct them from within. There will be hiring and leadership needs, but as well a deeper understanding of the damage done from the inside and norms undone. 	4/
The first years will be putting on the tourniquet for our own government and codifying norms so this doesn‚Äôt happen again - but meanwhile the world is moving ahead without us, and our place as a moral authority or global economic leader has dwindled, and we have been replaced.	3/
It‚Äôs like having a car that needs an oil change every 3k miles.  We haven‚Äôt changed the oil in 20k miles so far, and many parts are broken or in disrepair - many we haven‚Äôt taken into account yet.  	Then there‚Äôs our world standing, the devastation to our economy and more.	2/
People are assuming when Trump leaves office, voila, we‚Äôll be back at Jan 19, 2019 and move on from there. Wrong! As someone who has been keeping track of loss norms for 111 weeks, the damage he has done will take years, if not decades to repair. Our country has changed. 	1/

"The show, which regularly boasted upward of 40 corporate advertisements per night prior to his Dec. 13 monologue, recently hit a low of 21 ads on his Wednesday night show." https://t.co/qtHodWWELP
Look who he is surrounded by tonight at a time of crisis w/the shutdown.  The generals are all gone. The few smart, competent folks are gone. He is w/his son-in-law, his yes man Pence &amp; Mulvaney who basically is doing every open job. Who will say, no sir you can‚Äôt do that to him?
@Will_accountant Maybe. What is he say claims voter fraud like he did falsely in midterm. And demands court action and has stacked courts.  And refuses to concede.  		Personally I believe he will be impeached or resign prior, but if not, we can‚Äôt safely expect him to follow democratic norms.
@rjblaskiewicz All I am saying is nothing is normal with an authoritarian in charge, so we need to stop expecting norms. He has openly said he doesn‚Äôt believe in term limits.  All the times we have said this will end him - firing Yates, Comey etc.  He has no respect for our institutions.
@sueplick He complained about Florida being fair when it was close and subject to a recount in midterms. You have to imagine the previously unimaginable.
@rjblaskiewicz Authoritarians come up with things previously unthinkable. He does it every week.
@ErnestoGuerra Impeachment, resignation, something unprecedented.  His campaign, regime, biz, family, inauguration, foundation - every bit of him is under investigation.
@sueplick People said it was alarmist that Russia interfered and Trump was an authoritarian in 2016.  Guess what.
People telling you the best way to get rid of Trump is in an election aren‚Äôt paying attention:  he will never concede. Anyone believe he is capable of a peaceful transition of power? Nope he would lie to the same base you‚Äôre so concerned with mollifying.  It will end another way.

National security advisor John Bolton stressed on the call that victory over IS had to be enduring, but Trump was not dissuaded, and quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan. Also had no interest in giving Kurdish forces advance warning.

Trump picked Whitaker for a reason:he wouldn‚Äôt recuse no matter what. McConnell refuses to bring a resolution to protect Mueller to the floor.  Mueller know these facts better than anyone &amp; undoubtedly has planned accordingly. But don‚Äôt be surprised by the previously unthinkable.

Saying Jews profit off other people‚Äôs misery is the oldest anti-Semitic attack in the books. This is dangerous in the same way as the hatred being stoked by neo Nazis.

@Wonder_Woman53 She'll be left with a shitstorm.
Trump will be gone before the end of 2019, and we'll be left holding one big bag of mismanagement, incompetence and corruption that apparently a bunch of tweets can't fix. He has created such a mess of things - will be years if not decades to fix!
Nancy already passed one idiot, and the voters thoroughly refuted you for trying to destroy it in 2018.  A year from now you'll be out of office and the rest of the country will be left to clean up your and the GOP's mess! https://t.co/qQo4SWtY2Z
Healthcare was the #1 issue for voters in midterms last month - now ACA is at risk because of Republican extremism! https://t.co/7kqG4OkeA3
Everyone else you offered it to said no. There's that.  Jared doesn't count. https://t.co/BK15cyRWLq

Every time I hit refresh Trump, his family and regime are on more trouble:	NJ‚Äôs top law enforcement agency is looking into claims of widespread harassment and immigration fraud at Trump‚Äôs NJ golf club after several former and current housekeepers..	https://t.co/v2ElgDC4gW
@moceanworker I miss his appearances with the red hat.
@DwayneFuhlhage LOL
What have they done with Carter Page?
@cmclymer Mediocre is generous.  Plus more likely his next stop is back in prison than Congress.
Mueller's team rebuked Flynn's assertion that he was tricked into lying, but still says he should serve no prison time. Feel like there is a missing bit of key information that we need for this all to make sense. https://t.co/o2xywCbJz2
And just like that, Ivanka is more wrapped up in this.  https://t.co/ewEganqVSo
A reminder of how little we actually know about what Mueller has going behind the scenes.  After all, who had Alex Van Der Zwaan and George Papadoploulos on their going to jail bingo cards? https://t.co/Q8mRhLFFqA
Geez, I can't even get the tweets out about who Trump is considering for COS before they reject him. https://t.co/RXEc6DXIys
@SenatorDurbin @4lisaguerrero Resign and face hearings!
* 14,700 separated children, some in tent cities resembling internment camps	* tear gassing women and children	* 7 year-old dead from starvation and dehydration	The Trump regime is committing human rights violations.  Do not look away - the world and history is watching!
Trump is truly drawing from the bottom of the barrel - or not even in the barrel anymore.  https://t.co/8V6b19iYTb
So glad to see the head of @GOP cares about anti-Semitism. Ronna - when will we hear Trump and party leaders denounce the growing tide of neo Nazis Trump supporters, incl one taking selfies on the WH grounds? Or Trump invoking "Soros" and "good people on both sides." Tick tock... https://t.co/czq39n0ORh
Thing I will not miss in 2019:   Jeff Flake is about to speak on the senate floor...
Interesting development as Ukraine tries to win favor with Trump:	"A court in Ukraine has ruled that officials in the country violated the law by revealing, during the 2016 election, details of suspected illegal payments to Paul Manafort." https://t.co/Z7PVJHyiWH
Wow, The Weekly Standard is closing.  The media landscape is shifting so quickly - will be interesting to see what lies ahead for news and reporting.  https://t.co/SVBUEJc1Qn

THERE ARE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY BEING  CARRIED OUT AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.  14,700 and rising migrant children are in the Trump regime's care, many living in tent cities which resemble internment camps.  Yes, zero-tolerance is over, but the atrocities are only escalating!

@FinishLineScrip Yeah thinking same. May try to structure it as some sort of deal where we gets pardoned on the way out.
Lol this. https://t.co/6jRSPgolPs
I‚Äôve never been one to subscribe to the notion Trump would resign. He‚Äôs too addicted to seizing power and enriching himself. But Pelosi has him totally off-kilter-he has never had a check on his power-he‚Äôs at a loss to deal. And investigations. He is truly going to hate 2019.
@maxlexi Not sure how quickly but they are moving.  He doesn‚Äôt know what to do with a counter to his power. He has not yet had any.
@sethpetersonla @debleg58 Thank you.
@AriaaJaeger I knew it would get like this when we were on our way out.

@rbbellingham Lol.  Exactly!
Our foreign policy is based on where the Trump family has business or wants to.   Let‚Äôs hope when Democrats come back in January there will be House hearings. https://t.co/PbRim3mnpD
We‚Äôre  having a civil, interesting conversation over at Facebook which you are all welcome to join on pulling up decade old tweets, most recently with Kevin Hart.

Of all the Republicans acting out of character in the era of Trump, Rand Paul is at the top of the list. Traveling to Russia, pushing to relax sanctions on Russians  and so on. I highly suspect someone has the goods on this guy!	 https://t.co/3asO46koDr

@PNWWestCoast I have been screaming about Cambridge Analytica and Deutsche Bank all along.
The commonality in the possible SDNY felony for silencing women and collusion with Russia is this:  both impacted the outcome of the 2016 election. Don‚Äôt forget the NRA and Cambridge Analytica‚Äôs role in bringing Russian money and micro-targeting. We did not have a fair election.

Item #169 in this week‚Äôs list:	*Trump finalized a rollback of school lunch regulations championed by Michelle Obama.	Call it for what it is: a spiteful act by a miserable, racist tyrant whose purpose is undoing the Obama‚Äôs legacy, even if kids suffer. https://t.co/uhUHhIuCFx

Week 108 started so quietly with Bush's funeral, I was sure it would a short one - but no. This week has 169 not normal items, including bombshells and the clearest indication yet that Trump committed felonies. See what you missed in the chaos! https://t.co/a5EkB5JgyC

One of the most important stories this week that got lost in the chaos is @BuzzFeed reporting that a Honduran activist had his Facebook account hacked and it was used to stoke the migrant caravan - off season for migration but time for the run-up to midterms.  Who is behind that?

Trump has been totally cleared other than (so far) the two felonies and colluding with Russia.
Cohen's statement "obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative biz opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government. If the project was completed, the Company could have received hundreds of millions of $$ from Russian sources." https://t.co/RPYR3Z8onx
But we‚Äôre not done for today folks.... https://t.co/xcozt8ESLS
Lock Manafort up and throw away the key. Cohen can rot too - these people were willing to sell out country. https://t.co/IqZiJnEPJx
One thing is clear, if you are still supporting Trump, you are supporting a man who was willing to sell out our country for his own financial benefit.  I‚Äôll leave it at that!
