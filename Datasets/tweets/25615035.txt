@RizzShow Two, nearly 1,000 firearms (many legally purchased) were stolen last year in City alone. You think someone stealing a gun is up to any good?
@RizzShow One, easy access does not solely mean legally-purchased.

@RizzShow Nor did I say so or imply. Problem is ridiculously easy access.
@ronigirl273 @RizzShow Absolutely. This is a national problem: https://t.co/kUyNTvpmoJ via @NBCNightlyNews
@ronigirl273 @RizzShow I think our regional fragmentation is the bigger factor there. Hard to shoulder on pop of 315k residents yet home to regional assets.
@RizzShow It was moleg that created those new laws that make it harder and more dangerous for police to do "more law enforcement."
@RizzShow Ask police what it's now like pulling someone over or approaching someone w/an AK strapped to their chest, which #moleg allows.
