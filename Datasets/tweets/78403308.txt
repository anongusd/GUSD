Last week’s funding bill provided $1.5 billion for State Opioid Response Grants to allow states to create action plans that meet the needs of their states. In @GOPHELP and @GOPSenFinance, we are continuing to work on comprehensive legislation to address the #opioidcrisis, too.
It's #OverdoseAwarenessDay. Last week, the Senate approved an increase in funding for the fourth year in a row for opioid treatment, prevention and recovery programs. This epidemic has harmed too many families already, including my own. We’re working to stop it.
We’ve also confirmed 15 judges – including Georgia Judge Stan Baker – and taken the necessary steps to vote on eight more judges and confirmed dozens of other nominations for our government.
The ‘John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act’ was signed into law to help further modernize America’s military.
While August is typically spent in our home states, this month, we’ve spent much of our time in Washington. We’ve passed six necessary bills to fund the government and direct our spending in important areas such as defense, health care, education and labor.

Thanks to the U.S. House for its passage of bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical Education program for our pediatric workforce yesterday. We passed our Senate version in @GOPHELP in April, and I hope for a full Senate vote soon!
Very pleased that the #PerkinsCTE reauthorization passed the Senate yesterday. This legislation will help prepare America’s students more effectively for skilled jobs and give states more flexibility to better align skills training with local needs.
