My family‚Äôs story is a reflection of Dr. King‚Äôs determination and shows the progress he helped achieve. #MLK50
He lived through Dr. King‚Äôs remarkable rise and personally saw the incredible influence he had on spreading equality. In one generation, our family went from cotton to Congress. #MLK50
My grandfather was born in 1921 in South Carolina, a very different time for race relations in our country. He left school in the 3rd grade to pick cotton, was forced to use a different water fountain, and had to use a certain side of the street. #MLK50
It would be impossible to put into words the depth of the impact he had and continues to have on so many people, so I will leave you with a story. #MLK50
Fifty years after his death, his words continue to inspire us to push forward and defy all obstacles. ‚ÄòIf you can‚Äôt fly, run. If you can‚Äôt run, walk. If you can‚Äôt walk, crawl, but by all means, keep moving.' #MLK50
Dr. King helped to show us that the insurmountable power of love has the ability to conquer all evil. #MLK50
Today let us celebrate the amazing legacy of a giant among men, a trailblazer who devoted his life to spreading the true meaning of unity, peace, and the relentless pursuit of brighter days. #MLK50

It is absolutely critical for us to ensure our troops have the support they need, extend the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years, and keep the government up and running. Now, let‚Äôs get back to working for the American people.
Senate Democrats have finally made the right decision to end their political game and reopen the government ‚Äî finding a permanent solution for Dreamers is an important but unrelated issue.
Today, the Senate voted to reopen the government. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the left chose to play a political game that caused the #SchumerShutdown, jeopardizing health care for millions of vulnerable children and funding for our brave men and women in uniform.
Shout out to everyone celebrating #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek! I‚Äôd hoped to be at the Charleston Aquarium this morning to celebrate with some of South Carolina‚Äôs #schoolchoice leaders, but am in DC working to end the #SchumerShutdown, extend CHIP, and support our Armed Forces!

A permanent fix for DACA recipients&amp;increased border security are important issues, but this manufactured timeline created by Senate Democrats hurts millions of low-income children, our brave men and women in uniform, and the American people as a whole. #SchumerShutdown
I do not like short-term budgeting - never have. But we have a unique opportunity in front of us to extend #CHIP for longer than it has ever been extended since its creation, to make sure our Armed Forces have the support they need, and to keep the govt open. #SchumerShutdown

There are obvious ways, such as the end of Jim Crow laws and the Civil Rights Act, but also ways we perhaps do not think about‚Ä¶ways your legacy has endured, even through tragedy. #ThankYouMLK50

In working on our #TaxReform bill for more than a year, I focused on helping families ‚Äì doubling the child tax credit, keeping the 10% rate, and my Investing in Opportunity Act. Helping write this legislation has been an amazing opportunity to help hardworking American families!
Today, we are one step closer to starting the New Year off with a tax code that the American people both need and deserve. American families will get a better deal under #TaxReform. #SmallBiz owners will have an easier time expanding and creating jobs. This is much needed reform!

Our nation‚Äôs strength lies in our diversity. We are powerful &amp; accepting, &amp; should stand ready to defend liberty &amp; justice for all.
There is absolutely NO gray area when it comes to condemning groups who breed on racism, hate and division.
Our American family deserves conspicuous,determined leadership that stands in the gap for principles of freedom and the pursuit of liberty
Evil lurks in dark places. It is our responsibility to stop violence in its tracks and prosecute it to the fullest extent of the law
From my house to the White House, let's be clear.
Let us not repeat history with ambiguity when it matters the most.
Too many good people chose silence and not activism against the forces of darkness and evil.
The 1960s was a painful time when people of good conscience refused to stand up and be counted.
My party&amp;our nation must stand united against hate, racism&amp; groups/individuals who want to reject the truth that we are all from one blood.

20. I‚Äôm also not going to stop looking for a solution ‚Äì giving up isn‚Äôt what we were sent here to do.
19. I‚Äôm not going to give up on repealing the Unaffordable Care Act. American families deserve better.
18. I truly believe we all want what‚Äôs best for our nation and her people. To me, that‚Äôs finding a better solution than the ACA provides.
17. But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm not doing ‚Äì I‚Äôm not going to impugn the intentions of people who disagree
16. You can‚Äôt just put your head in the sand and ignore those facts and hope that it lives forever
15. Its price tag grew and grew from the billions into the trillions, and finally scoring agencies just gave up
14. The ACA is not sustainable, and hasn‚Äôt been from the beginning. Its foundation was built on certain groups that never signed up
13. I remain committed to repealing the ACA and replacing it with a system that works for all families
12. So that‚Äôs where we stand today. A bad program that has grown deep roots, and a bitterly divided political culture.
11. We‚Äôve got to realize that our pattern should not be disagree and destroy, but rather disagree and solve
10. And two ‚Äì along the way we stopped fighting the policy, and started fighting the people behind it
9. No matter how badly the program serves (or doesn‚Äôt serve) the people ‚Äì replacing an entitlement is hard
8. The ACA went into effect, and ‚Äì ‚ÄúA government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we‚Äôll ever see on this earth‚Äù (Reagan)
7. Two things happened along the way to where we stand today
6. These are facts ‚Äì you can‚Äôt argue with them. And that‚Äôs not how our health care system should work
5. Not everyone got to keep their doctors, and they weren‚Äôt able to keep their plans
4. Millions are paying for insurance they don‚Äôt want. In SC, more than 100,000 stuck without an option
3. In South Carolina, we‚Äôre down to one insurer offering plans on the exchanges.We‚Äôre seeing triple digit premium hikes,sky high deductibles
2. The debt continues to grow, and the ACA is not getting any better. The former isn‚Äôt helped by the latter.

It is a life long passion for me, and I am committed to working for ALL of our kids.
I want true reform that strengthens public education and gives parents a choice for their childrens‚Äô future.
So while some want to continue to put band-aids on a system that isn‚Äôt working for a lot of kids, I do not.
Because without education, incarceration rates go up, unemployment goes up, lifetime earnings go down.
We will work with Secretary DeVos to strengthen all of our schools, and to make sure quality education is available to all.
Let‚Äôs be clear-there are 1000s of low performing schools across this nation. You can hold the floor forever‚Ä¶but it won‚Äôt change that fact
The fact remains no Secretary of Education has the power to ‚Äúdestroy public schools‚Äù - and no one would.
We need strong public schools, as well as strong options for parents to choose the best option for their kids.
I am thankful for all the calls, for the passion we‚Äôve seen about education policy for the past two weeks.

@WatchYourRepsSC @watchyourSen Insurers leaving - https://t.co/we8R4QsV3G, premiums spiking - https://t.co/BXphNIc3gE
Looking forward, we're going to find a better way to make sure quality, affordable health care is available.
Coverage to 26, coverage for pre-existing conditions...these are things basically everyone agrees on.
And that was when folks thought Hillary would win and keep Obamacare!
We've seen almost every insurer in South Carolina leave the exchange, premiums spike and deductibles rise.
As one of the only members to already pass legislation signed into law limiting the harmful effects of Obamacare,I know what's at stake here
We are working to build a system that ensures affordable care is available - without the massive price tag and intrusion of Obamacare.
First - this week was the first vote in the longer process of repeal. Second, current health insurance plans/coverage have not been changed.
We are serious about helping the American people. We will replace Obamacare with a better system.
A few things to clear up on Obamacare repeal. I know many Americans on both sides of the issue are anxious.

7. I believe every American wants one thing - the opportunity to succeed. To make sure their family has a bright future.
6. There is amazing work being done in communities across our nation every day, but their efforts aren‚Äôt always recognized by policymakers.
5. We‚Äôre engaging communities, learning about solutions from the ground up instead of trying force them from the top down.
4. We‚Äôve brought together the #SenateOpportunityCoalition to help change that.
3. We have created a poverty floor, but not the opportunities needed for every family in every community to find success.
2. The solutions of the past 50 years, while well intentioned, simply have not gotten that job done.
1. We need 21st century solutions to battle poverty and ensure opportunity for all.

16. God Bless, and I hope you all have a great day. Remember - if you want to walk on water, you have got to get out of the boat.
15. Your passion, dedication and love are the heartbeat of this nation - and underscore what could happen when we stand united.
14. For my mom, my granddad, and everyone else who sacrificed so much so the next generation could live a better life - I say thank you.
13. I am working every day to bring quality education, good jobs &amp; the American Dream back to those who may not have experienced them yet
12. That vision must continue to guide us into the future. To truly help us all, we must offer a hand to those in need.
11. Our great nation was built on the dreams and ideals of a group of people who recognized that all men are created equal
10. We can come together, and invest in our communities, encourage private dollars to help rebuild and restore.
9. Let‚Äôs recognize the manufacturing boom in states like SC, and reemphasize technical training, apprenticeships, and good, well paying jobs
8. Every child must have access to a quality education. Unemployment, incarceration, dropout rates - all linked to educational achievement
7. To turn back on the light at the end of the tunnel, and strengthen our nation from the ground up.
6. And so, its up to us to bring it back to those millions of families across America who are desperately seeking a chance at success
5. When you can‚Äôt see beyond your own block, when you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs possible, the American Dream starts to fade.
4. I grew up in a place like that, and have seen both the short- and long-term effects this can bring.
3. While we are the greatest nation on earth, we still have too many people living in poverty and in communities where hope has evaporated
2. We must stand together, move forward together, and find solutions together.
1. I stand for opportunity. For the belief that every single person in this country has greatness inside them waiting to be unleashed.

The bottom line is we can &amp; must do better. Building a bigger Washington doesn‚Äôt help America. Ensuring opportunity builds a better America.
I will work anytime, any place, anywhere, with anyone to tackle the issues facing our poor and low-income communities.
These are hardworking families, many of which simply need the opportunity in order to succeed.
When you bring education and jobs, you bring hope and concrete evidence of success. Through investment, we sustain that success.
As we build on these three pillars - education, jobs and community investment, we can make a huge difference for the poor.
My #CHOICEAct ensures that parents have the opportunity to ensure their kids get the best education, regardless of their zip code.
My LEAP Act w/@CoryBooker incentivizes apprenticeships, so folks can earn while they learn. Also encourages manufacturing skills.
My Investing in Opportunity Act encourages private investment in low-income communities w/no new govt program. https://t.co/t4vUZyPWYH #IIOA
My #OpportunityAgenda seeks to do just that. Empower people, not bureaucrats. Encourage success, not stagnation.
Its not through more government, but through shaping a system that encourages success.
What I‚Äôm looking for is how do we empower people. How do we put hope back into our childrens' minds. How do we kickstart the American Dream.
Too often people get tangled in the safety net, instead of bouncing back towards success. That‚Äôs a fault of the system in place.
I know that while our current system might have created a poverty floor, it has not widely created opportunities for success.
Having to use the oven to heat your house; watching your grandmother walk 8 miles a day because we couldn't afford the bus - that‚Äôs tough.
Growing up in a poor, single parent household, I know firsthand the struggles folks in low-income communities go through every day.
Too often over the past 50 years, our answers to fighting poverty have relied on empowering government instead of people.

Those 46 million living in poverty need long-term solutions, not short-term band-aids. #OpportunityAgenda
We have 46 million Americans living in poverty - it's clear the policies of the past 50 years, while well-intentioned, aren't working.
I will continue the fight for those living in poverty by emphasizing education, work skills and a positive environment. #OpportunityAgenda
Our goal must be to make sure young people and families know there is a future beyond what they can see. #OpportunityAgenda
Growing up poor in a single parent household, I've seen what happens when hope is taken away. #OpportunityAgenda
Apprenticeships help folks earn while they learn, and give people the skills to succeed. #LEAPAct #OpportunityAgenda
#SchoolChoice makes sure your zip code doesn't determine your educational future. #OpportunityAgenda
