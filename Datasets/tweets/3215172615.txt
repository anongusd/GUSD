Glory days for sure! Kentucky killers for sure! https://t.co/DuG5w5OM4z

@jerrymeyer247 You think the Vols can make the final 4?
@coachtatebhs @BeardenHoops @TMackPlace @CoachJMort Well played! See you Friday night coach for a rematch!
@GoodmanHoops Tennessee says hello!
@GabeDeArmond Beatdown coming!
@joerexrode Final four team?
@coachtatebhs Truly someone who made a huge impact on my high school life, in basketball and off the court! DFL
@coachtatebhs @Tylerrnordin another solid Webb transfer! Seen that before @coachtatebhs
@coachtatebhs I am really excited for them
@chrisdavislive Stud
This is why he is the GOAT ! Great player and mentor! https://t.co/W5Ir9w71hC
@eric_mcgaha well said BIG E!
I love this! This is so true! https://t.co/a29vNxpbpG
@joerexrode Agree Joe, Vols dominate the state period! Not really close either, especially comparing fanbases!
@joerexrode Great article,  agree but like always they will go back to being the same Vandy and Tennessee will be back to being Tennessee! Vandy has alot of seniors and replacing Shumar will be tough! Well said Rex!
@KellyannePolls Great story
This is what high school sports should be about! Having fun and school pride! Great story! https://t.co/lMMic5NUzn
Do not sleep on this team! Go Rebels! https://t.co/9sCHRvucBU
Very true Rob! https://t.co/5GgZVPyIZe
@GabeDeArmond Agree,  they will find out how good he is next year when they only win 4 games! Well said Gabe!
@jmack_callaway All Dawg here Johnny Mac!
Great job Rebels! https://t.co/fXPcTheH6I
@NateSilver538 Trump pretty much owns the states below the Mason /Dixon line! You were pretty spot on about the House! You gotta love the job Blackburn did in Tenn!
@kirklandfarms Agreed! GO VOLS
@mayes_carla @potsband @UTKnoxville @alyssamayes00 Jody said she is gonna join her next year in the alumni band!
@NateSilver538 @Nate_Cohn Feelings are going to be hurt again! Remember 2016 please! No fluke, the guy is Teflon Don!
@Brad_Shepard I agree. He holds the ball way to long! Butch left us with shit!
@NateSilver538 You might want to look at Missouri Senate race, your girl is in trouble .
@NateSilver538 I thought you learned your lesson in 2016, Trump moves the dial like nobody before, Reagan of the 20th century! Gonna be a wild night,  hold on tight!
@MatthewPV @NateSilver538 Oh he has done plenty things I question,  I just like the way our country is moving! Gotta build the wall, keep the economy booming and this conservative Tennessee boy will be happy!
@MatthewPV @NateSilver538 Alabama had a flawed candidate,  2 years from now. Jones in Alabama gets crushed! As Trump says, never get tired of winning! Enjoy the ride for the next 6 years, gonna be fun!
@NateSilver538 You keep underestimating the power Trump has , everywhere he shows up, races turn! I thought you learned a lesson in 2016! Agreed with your assessment of th he Tennessee Senate race, Blackburn big!
@Volquest_Rob So true !
@ByMikeWilson So true!
@slmandel Butch Jones is horrible coach, ask any Tennessee fan! Good luck coach at Dartmouth!
@slmandel Yea , Butch way over head at Tenn! We deserve better than that clown!
@Nate_Cohn Waste of time in Tennessee,  red state all the way, might want to try Missouri,  gotta feeling another big pickup for Trump!
@coachtatebhs Go Dawgs!
@Nate_Cohn Sounds about right, Tenn like most southern states are solid red, move on to New York or California where a dem can win!
@HumanistCoach Player!
@Nate_Cohn Blackburn wins Tenn by 6 points or more! The Republican candidate has flexed her muscle and the state is way Red! Nate is correct, could be 10!
@MsEnergyHealer @NateSilver538 That was before Trump	, South bleeds red! The state is dominated by Republicans now! National and state level!
@MsEnergyHealer @NateSilver538 Red state, not gonna happen! Republicans dominate this state and it always will!
@NateSilver538 Looks like Blackburn will win Tenn comfortably! Red all the way!
Love the way @BeardenHoops  is stepping up and playing the big boys! https://t.co/fbDV7fhmjW
@NateSilver538 waste of time in Tenn, red state all day long!
@MikeGriffith32 Traitor!
@NateSilver538 Will be confirmed,  just a big show! Trump never loses
@NateSilver538 One more time. Will be confirmed next week! Trump not worried!
@SethWEmerson So lucky
@NateSilver538 Book this Nate , he will get confirmed! Trump never loses! You know the odds!
@FoxNews Dont worry Dems he will get confirmed! Book that boys and girls! Trump always wins!
@GottliebShow @ClayTravis Basketball season soon,  Vols best team in country! Dougy!
@hoopboy2099 @NotJerryTipton No that guy who kicked KY ass for 4 years,  that guy!
@NotJerryTipton Heard of Peyton Manning?
@ClayTravis Agreed,  Butch sucked
@NateSilver538 Waste of time , he wins big! Red State all day long!
