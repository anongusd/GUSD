#MALDEF50: @TFayBustillos: You need a @MALDEF that understands the way discrimination plays out on the Latino community, and it's not an exclusionary perspective.
#MALDEF50 Saenz: The future is about creating new law, creating new claims, deter discriminators from discriminating
Saenz: This is most anti-Latino administration we've ever faced. #MALDEF50
#MALDEF50 Panel continues. Watch on https://t.co/1hIpW6Fk0E. Next topic: future of the organization.
VM: @MALDEF attracts incredible legal talent who formulate innovative strategies. #MALDEF50
#MALDEF50 Saenz: Through line from Plyler to Prop 187 to SB 1070 and other immigrants' right cases.
#MALDEF50 V. Martinez: Plyler v Doe was precedent in strike down of CA Prop 187, which sought to deny public benefits to undocumented immigrants
#MALDEF50 Panel discussion turns to Plyler v Doe, 1982 SCOTUS decision establishing constitutional right to free K-12 public education for all kids, regardless of immigration status. (Watch on https://t.co/1hIpW6Fk0E)

#MALDEF50 Saenz: @MALDEF was founded 14 years after Brown v Bd. of Education but we still have segregation cases that are still alive in 2018
#MALDEF50 Saenz: We have to relitigate Edgewood every decade, in TX and other parts of the country like New Mexico, where @MALDEF won case this year with ruling that students have a right to equity in education

Vilma Martinez: One of the things @MALDEF did early in tenure was figure out how to proceed because for a while we responded to many issues. Ultimately we decided to work in education, employment, the vote, and immigration issues. #MALDEF50
Many landmark cases since @MALDEF founding: LULAC v Perry fought manipulation of district lines to disenfranchise Latinos. #MALDEF50
.@TFayBustillos: What @MALDEF bought was real addressing of structural discrimination against Latinos
Al Kauffman, former @MALDEF SW regional counsel: "I think (racism) was more blatant (in Texas)."
Thomas Saenz: "@MALDEF has long been a pan-Latino organization, serving entire Latino community, but we remain name for historical reasons"

@MALDEF VP of Litigation Nina Perales just wrapped up #SB4 arguments in US District Court, reserving more time for later. More to come.
Perales: #SB4 Loss of tourism revenue in San Antonio &amp; Bexar County is irreparable harm flowing from the law &amp; thus a constitutional issue
Perales: #SB4 prohibits telling officers they can't enforce immigration law. Individual officers could decide unilaterally to enforce.
Perales: #SB4 causes irreparable harm by stripping local govts of ability to adopt policies protecting public safety.
Perales: if an community college trustee adopts or enforces a policy denying ICE requests, that would violate #sb4.
Judge Garcia: how would community college district employees come under #SB4?
Perales: #SB4 unconstitutionally overbroad and violates 1st amendment protections
Perales: #SB4 violates 4th amendent in 2 important ways: holding people on ICE detainers w/o probable cause, &amp; questioning of immig status
@MALDEF's Perales: Immigration &amp; Naturalization Act does not say local officials can enforce immigration law. #sb4 preempts federal law.
