Let me be clear, my support for Atiku in no way implies blind loyalty. I am ready to call him out when needed and praise when deserved. We all have a responsibility to demand a better Nigeria. Buhari has shown that he only cares about his clan and not the nation.
Having evaluated all candidates contesting in this election, I have reached a conclusion to support Atiku. He may not be perfect, however, I am convinced that he is a better candidate compared to Buhari. If he wins, I will lead in holding him accountable. We must reject tyranny.

There is an urgent need to invest in high-quality health systems and make such systems accountable to the people through legislation, education of women about their rights, regulation, transparency and greater public participation.
The current situation of many avoidable maternal deaths without accountability in Nigeria is untenable. Nigeria women deserve a quality maternal health care, which is safe, people-centred, timely, fair, integrated and efficient.
I made a call for a high-quality maternal health that is people-centred and accountable to the people just like in many developed countries and in sub-Saharan African countries like South Africa and Tanzania
I wrote about the inhumane and untenable maternal health services responsible for the death of not less than 80 women per day in Nigeria. Please read using this link: PUEAA https://t.co/2rFZS5t6DH https://t.co/zEbjwDpGp3

Buhari campaigned on fighting corruption but he institutionalised corruption by employing the children of his cronies into government agencies and parastatals without due process.

The question then is, who are these cabals and how do we fight them in order to take back our country?
PMP’s government is meant to be different -being the government of change- but the cabals have struck again. Even the president’s wife cannot stop complaining about the grip of cabals on her husband.
You may also wanna recollect how cabal sidetracked GEJ during Yar’adua’s illness. Many people believe that GEJ’s government would have served Nigerians interests if not for the monstrous cabals.
Unmasking the cabals    	Every follower of Nigerian’s politics is familiar with the word cabal. Cabals appear to have done more damage to the country that her past leaders. We can all remember how cabal stole our petrol subsidy money.

@AbimbolaRA @opeyemiagbaje @Tutsy22 😀😀😀😀😀😀I leave that to his classmates
@h_o_korobah It's sad. We often shield the perpetrators. We need to do more as a society to protect women and children.
@h_o_korobah As a researcher, I understand that the prevalence of sexual violence is high and  our society tends to shame and blame the victims. Sad!
@h_o_korobah It's so sad. Even though this happened in South Africa, I read about a lady that took her life due to something similar in Nigeria.
@h_o_korobah Sad but true
@h_o_korobah Perhaps new generation of pastors will do well to correct this anomaly.
@h_o_korobah A Church is also a place where people internalised gender roles, which are inbalance against women.
@h_o_korobah The onus lies entirely on the new generation of parents to change the narratives. The worth of a girl child lies not in her virginity.
@h_o_korobah Well said. That sense of entitlement that a guy must care for a lady must be removed. If a woman has her own money, guys will respect her.
@h_o_korobah Both sexes must be thought to be hardworking and trained to make a living.
@h_o_korobah Both sexes must be thought how to cook and clean.
@h_o_korobah It can be done. Parenting is very important. We need to stop treating boy and girl child differently, especially role allocations.
@h_o_korobah Young women need to know that they are not property of or subordinate to men.
@h_o_korobah Internalised values, which inhibits equity of sexes, is the main barrier to achieving true equality of sexes in Nigeria.
@h_o_korobah Our society often vilify women, which is sad. But I think emphasis on marrying virgins has waned. Women are proud non-virgins today.
@opeyemiagbaje @Tutsy22 He must be very intelligent to have finished at 16 years. Many people finish high school much later.
@h_o_korobah To you point, using a moral compass, it's wrong. But the reality is that cohabitation is becoming an acceptable alternative to marriage.
@h_o_korobah I think we shouldn't judge what two adults deemed best fit for their relationship.
@h_o_korobah You question is related to morals. What is moral is not alway practical. In other words, living together might be the best alternative.
@h_o_korobah Why not? Perhaps that's not the only indication that one would have a good marriage.
@h_o_korobah Perhaps that line of thinking is no longer 100% accurate. My opinion though.
@h_o_korobah Like men don't marry a divorcée
