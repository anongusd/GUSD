@WinThePennant @emrazz Better terms than what? Taking out a loan doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. No interest is great but it doesn‚Äôt help in the immediate. Most people in this country can‚Äôt afford to miss a paycheck. Rent, car payments and college loans have to be paid and missing out on $5k is a huge deal.
@emrazz @WinThePennant Most contractors, including the people making the least amount of money will never get back pay.
@emrazz @WinThePennant It also takes time to get a loan which doesn‚Äôt help if you don‚Äôt have enough gas in your car to make it to the grocery store or the job you‚Äôre still being forced to do.
@WinThePennant @emrazz Not everyone is going to get back pay. There are still lawsuits going all the way back to 2013.

@GlennF @krinklyfig Absolutely. Restaurant employees are more likely to get sick because of long hours and constant contact with the gereral population. It‚Äôs also much harder to take sick days. I couldn‚Äôt count the number of times I was forced to work while sick.
@GlennF @krinklyfig I think I read that a while ago! I worked somewhere that pools tips and I noticed that people didn‚Äôt work nearly as hard and could care less about the customer. This is obviously anecdotal though.
@krinklyfig @GlennF I‚Äôve been in the business for 20 years, which I really love and agree with you on benefits. Mostly places do offer insurance and vacation time if you work 40 hours like anywhere else but far too many people forgo insurance. I know I did for a long time until I got married.
@GlennF @krinklyfig I‚Äôd be interested in checking out this research. Included gratuity works well, especially for larger parties but eliminating tips entirely (which the Trump admin is proposing) will end up negatively impacting everyone except for the business owner.
@ageekymom @OhGoSquid @kelseymsutton That‚Äôs why I like bartending at restaurants. It‚Äôs better money and you have more leeway for stuff like that.
@stumpymcgoo @remmingtons @kelseymsutton @pattymo This. It‚Äôs the front line of the restaurant business. People don‚Äôt understand that. If there‚Äôs a problem, there‚Äôs a manager that can help.
@erythromancy @HockeyStatMiner @kelseymsutton Also, there‚Äôs so many people who are able to make it through college serving or bartending. The hours are flexible, the pay can be really good and it‚Äôs always something to fall back on.
@kelseymsutton You have to love the input from some of these people who have never been in the industry before. The vast majority of servers/bartenders are for the tip model. They would be taking a drastic pay cut if they went hourly.
@GlennF @krinklyfig Have you ever been in the service industry? It actually benefits the customer quite a lot. There‚Äôs much more incentive to give good service and it keeps food and alcohol prices low. Most FOH staff is against taking away tipping bc the majority of them would take a drastic pay cut

@KimmiAnne77 @Ange_Amene @TelegramSam100 @Stormy_Tuesday_ @decaro_nick @SenSanders Taxes on processed foods are very discriminatory too.

@Crocawards @foxandfriends What the hell are you talking about? I‚Äôm not a lawyer but it‚Äôs not hard to figure this stuff out. It‚Äôs an in-kind payment from Trump/Cohen to bury a story that would affect the election. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Not sure what democrats have to do with that.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed Jeff Sessions prosecuted a woman for laughing at him.
@michaelschweitz Gotta love those flag shirts and the crotch grab on the other guy.
@Crocawards @foxandfriends None of what you just said was true. The payment is considered an in-kind contribution which wasn‚Äôt reported so therefore it breaks campaign finance law. Would you like to point out the federal law that you speak of?
@BuddyWayne4 @foxandfriends @POTUS What did you have to say about Bill Clinton or John Edwards?
@Crocawards @foxandfriends Nope. New York has one party consent laws. The Trump camp leaked this and gave up privilege. They thought that it would somehow vindicate them but it does the exact opposite. This is an illegal campaign contribution.

@JustMeMbMa @Una_Paloma1 @mschlapp There‚Äôs definitely some infighting but I think different factions are what we need. There should be both moderate and leftist voices in Congress. Compromising over similar values is what makes good government. Plus most moderates are more progressive than you realize.
@mavwc @realHeatherD @JRM1282 @foxandfriends @EricShawnTV @FiveThirtyEight It does not read that way.
@JustMeMbMa @Una_Paloma1 @mschlapp I agree. Hopefully voters pay attention enough to the messages and decide what‚Äôs really working and not working for them.

@YugeCrowd @Erik_Da_Red @VOCRadioRobDoc @jdawsey1 Trump doesn‚Äôt care about supporting troops. Instead of paying for the stupid parade he could use the money to get homeless vets off the streets or to pay for medical care.
@VOCRadioRobDoc @YugeCrowd @jdawsey1 Hilary Clinton also stole money from you to support her drug habits and pay for hookers.
