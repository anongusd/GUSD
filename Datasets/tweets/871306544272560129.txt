@YLdMKoTCKaSBTjO Возможно, империализм основан на крови и выстрелах, как впрочем любой возрождающийся строй. Но одно точно, капитализм живет кровью и выстрелами, что доказано современностью. Сталин был суров. С этим никто не спорит, время такое было. Но кто заставляет убивать миллионы сегодня?
Interesting. Do the French know that the place in the UN staff has not been given to them by De Gol ... it's Comrade Dzhugashvili. While the United States and England were categorically against it. Who is Dzhugashvili? Stalin! https://t.co/ebcibLTnSF

@Nona_Urbiz This is also not true. The US takes the products of other countries in exchange for "green paper".
@Nona_Urbiz Today, all countries in the world want to have nuclear weapons. This is the only security guarantee. Guarantee that they do not comprehend the fate of Gaddafi and Saddam.
@Nona_Urbiz False. The real figure is 314,812 people. This figure from the documents of the NKVD. Not invented by the liberals.

The launch of the missile by North Korea is entirely the fault of the United States. Through Russia, the United States was told that they would not conduct exercises on the border until the spring and did not keep their word. This was said by Lavrov in his speech. https://t.co/QtxW18vkZE
The brutal regime in North Korea destroyed 27 thousand people over the past 10 years, 17 thousand people were assad's regime, 16 thousand people were killed by Gaddafi. Kind "Carrying light and freedom" The United States is more than a million. https://t.co/GfrkuObp9A

From the very beginning USSR broke off trusting relations with West. As a result, they have become more powerful than US and whole West in general. I believe that modern Russia needs to cease all relations with US. If we are not respected there, why should we respect them? https://t.co/RDts3hhL0C

@NAT26393840 @DassshaRussia Лирика. Напишите ее данные. Здесь же я опубликую скрины официальных документов.
@NAT26393840 @DassshaRussia Так же, если у нее несправедливо было изъято имущество, за свои деньги найму здесь юриста и решу этот вопрос. Отчитаюсь прилюдно здесь же.
@NAT26393840 @DassshaRussia Это не трудно проверить. Напишите ее фамилию и имя. Где жила. Я проверю и 1-3 дня дам ответ из миграционной полиции и ее соседей.
@joniturnerlaw She was afraid of prayer. Where it is said about God and good. But she would be glad to get drunk, get drugged and "breaking bad"
@NAT26393840 @DassshaRussia А тупыми я обозвал тех кто изголяется над национальными особенностями, многие русские слова тоже смешны, но кто слышал что бы мы потешались?
@NAT26393840 @DassshaRussia Вероятно, Вы из породы Венидиктовых. Слышал звон... Приезжай в Астану, посмотри на дружбу наших народов. Спроси у Ваших чеченцев,дагестанцев
@NAT26393840 @DassshaRussia Ложь, наглая ложь. У нас и сегодня много русских. Есть министры, депутаты, олигархи русские. У меня во дворе треть соседей русские. Акстись!

@angel12_demon @DassshaRussia Памятники оскверняют везде. Казахи их найдут и жестко накажут (не сомневайтесь). Но сие действо не повод шовинистических издевок.

@DassshaRussia Самая ужасная черта русских в том что, ставят себя выше остальных. И обижаются когда им говоришь это в лицо. Уйдут Казахи, с кем останитесь?
@Pan_Postman Without dreams, man is only an animal. (Abai Kunanbayev)
@Pan_Postman Or you are a follower of globalists. No people, no races, no religions, no gender differences ... there is only a CONSUMER
@Pan_Postman You do not believe in the friendship of peoples? You are still so young ... or stupid. Sorry for being so direct.
@JestemFajna9 Do you believe everything you read? Jews are also creation of Allah. And if he did not love them, then only Arabs would live in the world.
@JestemFajna9 Is it written "kill the Jews"?

@Pan_Postman @DobreImiePolski I hope you will see something someday and understand. There was a lot in history. But you are blood relatives, you Slavs.
@Pan_Postman @DobreImiePolski Yes Yes. Betrayed the Russians. Betrayed the consanguineous, the Slavs. They saved your cities from complete destruction. Live with it.
@JessieJaneDuff She threw US diplomats to die in Africa. The president can not be a person throwing his command and citizens.
@Pan_Postman @DobreImiePolski Poles calm down. I just wrote what I'm reading. But fact that Poles betrayed the memory of 600tys. Russian, who died for Poland - the TRUTH.
@andybes50484929 @PutinRF_Eng Do not write about Muslims. These are not Muslims, they are children of Satan, servant of Iblis. A Muslim kills only when he saves family.
@JestemFajna9 Allah created Hebrews. Or do you think that there is someone else?Do you think that you know thoughts Allah?Live in peace and righteousness.
@JestemFajna9 Do not call yourself a Muslim, please. You have no right. Like those Shaytans who blow up and kill with the name of God, they serve Satan.

@TAPapizan OK. I think that you will not understand anything. Because you do not want to understand. I will not answer anymore. God keep you.
@TAPapizan It's not Hollywood and transformers.There they really die by families. Tragedies every hour.While you are writing someone killed your drones
@TAPapizan What kind of people are you Americans? Does not the life of people outside the US borders mean anything to you? Why do you want to kill?
@TAPapizan Do you really think that NoCo or anyone else can seriously threaten the US? Think please.
@TAPapizan What for? Why would he need Guam? It was just bragging. But for US it is an opportunity to launch a military budget. Who is more profitable?
@TAPapizan The only ones who have used nuclear weapons so far are only the United States. And they do not believe you either.
@TAPapizan US does not need to fight with anyone.It is necessary to transfer economy to country from China.Trump wants this, but they do not give him.
@TAPapizan Russia and China guarantee that it will stop making nuclear missiles if the US stops provoking it with exercises on the border.
@TAPapizan McCain does not care. He's leaving. And ready to slam the door loudly. What would the whole world have left with him.
@TAPapizan This is not beneficial primarily to hawks in the US. The reduction of the military budget does not suit them.
@TAPapizan Why should not the US be friends with NoCo? The problem will disappear when Koreans see the real world. Look how people live in the US
@TAPapizan A friend of your McCain - Ukraine, is involved in supply of engines in NoCo. It's just business. Like in your congress, it's just business
@TAPapizan OK. Let it be so. But what are the blame for millions of Koreans? They can not overthrow it. Or are they collateral damage?
@TAPapizan This is not true. On economy, China has overtaken you. On nuclear weapons, Russia has overtaken you. You were a superpower.
@TAPapizan Do you seriously think that he is a suicide? It's just that your politicians need new orders in the army.
@TAPapizan @MAGA I hope someday the US will be a model of peace and progress of the whole planet.
@TAPapizan If someone else does exercise at the border in Canada or Mexico. The US should not worry?
@TAPapizan In total, it is necessary to stop the exercises near borders. US would do same if NoKo conducted the exercises on the Mexican border.
@TAPapizan Today, all small countries are trying to make a nuclear bomb. After all, this is a guarantee against the seizure of their territory by US.
@TAPapizan Where are you? After all, democracy is the power of people. Support Trump. And in world there will come an era of peace and prosperity. MAGA
@TAPapizan NoKo will stop the nuclear program when the US stops military exercises. The US does not want this.
@TAPapizan @realDonaldTrump I agree. But he is one. And he can not contradict the Congress, which wants war. Because many in the congress have business in the army.
@TAPapizan Why does no one in the US think about peace? Because there was no war in your territory? Why would you kill millions away from you? Oil.
@TAPapizan NoKo realized that without the nuclear weapons, the fate of Gaddafi and Saddam awaits him.
@TAPapizan To whom to trust?
@TAPapizan They call your politicians insane. They say that you can not control them. But they are also right.
@TAPapizan What for? Why do you conduct military exercises there?
@TAPapizan Russia and China said that if US ceases to conduct exercises on the border of NoKo, they will stop NoKo nuclear program. US does not agree.
Russia and China said that if US ceases to conduct exercises on the border of NoKo, they will stop NoKo nuclear program. US does not agree.
@TAPapizan What is the reason for threats of NoCo? You do not know? They simply ask not to conduct military exercises of US Army at their borders.
Russia and China, clearly, will never allow them to attack nuclear weapons near their borders. The US needs to think about this many times. https://t.co/7z2mctzxUj
It seems to me that the US intentionally allowed NoKo to get engines. The US wants to implement a plan of attack using nuclear weapons. https://t.co/ZLRpsX557u
Personally,I'm sure.US leadership has long known on whose engines NoKo Rocket flew. Simply,a leak occurred,they are forced to look surprised https://t.co/YwmADKjxuA

@Georgesacco1 Congressmen do not allow trade to ordinary Americans,but their corporations buy engines and titanium in Russia.It is possible when necessary
@Georgesacco1 In Russia, 140 million people and a third of world's reserves.With them you can trade in many indicators.US technology plus Russian reserves
@Georgesacco1 They can not advertise. Congressional sanctions will not be allowed.
@Georgesacco1 Today, any American can come to Russia.To see with my own eyes that Russians want only peace.Visas are given to everyone in US.

@Georgesacco1 In Russia, almost everyone thinks that the US is not their enemy. That the enemy is only your McCain and Soros and Hillary.
@Georgesacco1 I myself go to Russia often. Russians want to be friends with the US and have always wanted it. But your congressmen need to sell weapons.
@Georgesacco1 To do this, do not bomb Syria, but just sit down at the negotiating table and trade with them.
@gedimuhando @MAGA
@gedimuhando Amen BROTHER
@Georgesacco1 I agree. Russia and the United States should be friends. But Syria's oil belongs to the people of Syria.
@gedimuhando In the US Congress there are people for whom the "cold war" never ended.
@Georgesacco1 This Russia won the Second World War, and the United States has helped it well.
@gedimuhando Is it similar to the South Korean doormat?
@gedimuhando Number of nuclear warheads in 2009 was: about 9600 from USA (ready for installation and already placed on carriers) and 12683 from Russia.

@1surthriver The Russians only want to be friends. Some Americans come to Russia and after what they see want to take citizenship. Is not it weird?
@1surthriver News write "The Senate banned Trump from making appointments during the holidays." This is at least funny. Authority of the president fell.
@1surthriver The question of its dawn is only a matter of time. And here the US should be there, not as an enemy, but as a partner.
@1surthriver Sanctions affect Russia. But not so much as they think in the US. Russia has a third of the world's wealth and only 140 million people.

@Dihaggis @theluckymofo @Maga Hillary, Bailen ... support Trump. He himself will deal with the swamp.
@Dihaggis You are not looking in right direction.As soon as you believe that Russians did not interfere in elections, everything will fall into place.
@theluckymofo Read the history of the world. This is not enough.
@Dihaggis @theluckymofo @Maga Only "Made in the USA" will save the US.
@theluckymofo @Dihaggis @Maga America will save only the Americans! @MAGA !!!
@FlyersF1 America will save only the Americans! @MAGA !!!
@theluckymofo @Dihaggis @Maga Trump understood that. But there are those businesses that will suffer. Support Trump and @MAGA.
@theluckymofo @Dihaggis @Maga Already 36 countries trade among themselves without a dollar. If you do not transfer production to the US - this is the beginning of the end
@Dihaggis @Maga This is for complacency. Throughout history, sanctions have not helped anyone and never. Friendship, partnership with Russia and China.
@Dihaggis You have Trump. You just need to convince people to help the president at a difficult time for him. @MAGA !!!
@FlyersF1 But in this they accuse everyone in the whole world. Corruption is very dangerous.
@Dihaggis @Maga Hillary is a sick woman. She would already have started a war with Russia. If Trump won. Perhaps we would not have written this already.
@Dihaggis McCain takes revenge for his resentment and humiliation in Vietnam. He will destroy the whole world. There is now nothing to lose.
@Dihaggis Obama killed, indirectly, more than all people in the world in the last 50 years.
@Dihaggis @okifish64 It's a lie. Iran and NoKo are different countries. Not friends with each other.
@Dihaggis This is not true. I respect and admire the United States. But you can not say that you are the first and do not prove it.
@FlyersF1 That's where US citizens need to be together and choose true patriots. Not those who turned politics into a personal business.
@Dihaggis @okifish64 Why is Iran and NoKo your enemy? Did Obama say that? You were there? These are countries that also want to live with dignity.
@Dihaggis Obama lost to Putin everywhere. Obama, obama, obama ... but in fact, he does not stand out in anything except that trumpeted Trump.
@Dihaggis @okifish64 You see a lot of CNN. North Korea is far from Iran and does not even have a consulate there. And than they threaten the USA?
@FlyersF1 Only one way out. Do not vote for those who have been in Congress at least once. Update the blood policy.
@FlyersF1 You can not take it into your own hands. Congress will declare you rebels and destroy. The United States is already very deep in this.
@okifish64 @Dihaggis To have nuclear weapons and to be unpredictable ... is it not dangerous? So what do you want from Iran and North Korea?
@Dihaggis Problem is that Trump's powers not even half of Putin.Putin would have long ago dispersed everyone while trying to encroach on his influence
@Dihaggis And they consider the US unpredictable and very dangerous. And in their own way they are right too.
@Dihaggis Now, Russia will receive profits. The calculation is that business will affect Putin completely stupid.

@TAPapizan This is the choice of many of those who are lobbyists of Obama and Hillary. There is no sense from the elections.
@TAPapizan If Trump is not removed before the election, your oligarchs.
@TAPapizan Only Americans can fix anything in the US. No one else in the world. Why do you believe the media, come and Russia and be surprised.
@TAPapizan Putin wants to be friends with Trump. Putin wants to be friends with the United States. Your Congress does not want to.
@TAPapizan Nobody is afraid of sanctions in Russia. They simply regret that they can not be friends and trade with the United States.
@TAPapizan Trump is the best thing the US has today. @MAGA sir
@TAPapizan Today, most freedom of speech in Russia.I can send a link where on central Russian media, Ukrainian and Polish nationalists say they want.
@TAPapizan Putin if he said that he will do it. If Congress wants a "bloody bath", he will give it to them. But he only wants peace with the US.
@TAPapizan He has a share there.All who are against Russia today lobbing money for army.But there will be no war.MOAB will not.Or the world or the end.
@TAPapizan The Congress consists of the proteges of Obama and Hillary.
@TAPapizan Tweeting was about the fact that the US was spending money on the army that could be spent on its citizens.
@TAPapizan Sometimes I visit Russia and I see it.
@TAPapizan The Russians do not want to fight. From the president to the janitor everything is for peace
@TAPapizan You are told that Russian missiles will be intercepted.This is not true.No one will catch missiles of both sides.War is end of everything.

A year ago, US general, openly and officially, advised IGIL and Al Qaeda "Kill Russian soldiers and then they will be removed from Syria." https://t.co/FaAnAKmWEz
All are so biased that they "turn a blind eye" to the fact that US in Syria is not legal and supports illegal groups. Israel is also silent https://t.co/NSDJlseB2b
The American media closed their territory with a dense cocoon. 3 months on Aleppo did not fly any aircraft. All the bombings were on CNN. https://t.co/lV68i5QcJ0

@1surthriver Gorbachev was spitting on the words of the others. He deeply believed that once the word gave the US it would be so. He said so himself.

@Justice_Xapn @ruslan_raf Согласен. Забудьте.
@Justice_Xapn @ruslan_raf Мне (простите за откровенность) все равно кто у Вас там. Если Вас тронуло личное мнение - забудьте. Решайте сами свои проблемы друзья.
@ruslan_raf @Justice_Xapn Руслан, не заморачивайтесь В Опу политику и все что с нею. Я просто блогер и не хотел бы принимать чью то сторону. Пусть славяне сами спорят
@ruslan_raf @Justice_Xapn Это лишь термин из документа. Мне все равно. Для меня это лишь информация к твиттер аккаунту.
@Justice_Xapn Я не хочу обидеть Вас. Но Украина лишь барьер между Россией и Западом. Что мешает Вам дружить со всеми и иметь выгоду ото всех?
@ruslan_raf @Justice_Xapn Посмотрите на Казахстан. У нас самое большое развитие экономики в СНГ. При этом мы дружим со всеми. И с Украиной и Россией. Быть гибче нужно
@ruslan_raf @Justice_Xapn Я бы хотел что бы там сидел кто то поумнее. Вопрос кто?
@Justice_Xapn А есть разница из чего? Если все в Украине думают как Вы завтра пойду покупать тапочки. :) Потому что Россияне точно не испугаются конца.
@Justice_Xapn Да уж. Как бы не получилось так что Россия вычеркнет все места в мире. Психанет Путин и отдаст приказ... а там трава не расти.
@Justice_Xapn Вы не поняли? Начало "по рукам" будет концом человечества. Не будет ни Украины, ни нас, ни Китая и Мозамбика.
Trump too much inferior.They took away his voice and will.Who will now talk to him if he does not solve the problems? Time to start pressing https://t.co/ZvZ1ML6ekq
@Justice_Xapn Это не так. Я понимаю Вас. И согласен с Вами. Но со стороны политики Россия не допустит НАТО на Украину. Если нужно будет пойдет на все.
@jared8080 @MAGA!!!
@Justice_Xapn Я только буду рад за Украину. Но и у нас в стране показывали Байдена в кресле главы. Вы можете представить такое у нас или России. Я нет.
@jared8080 Do not bother respected sir. I just write the statements of politicians and celebrities in Russia. I'm absolutely neutral.
@Justice_Xapn Устрой переворот Россия в Мексике или Канаде, США открыто ввела бы туда армию. Маккейн это открыто говорил. Вы бы как поступили?
@Justice_Xapn Имеют. Когда в Киеве один этаж занимают сотрудники ЦРУ, у России выбора нет. ДНР и ЛНР это буфер на границе. Маленький... но хоть какой то.
@Justice_Xapn Прошли бы годы, Киев поставил бы аккуратно своих туда главами и выстроил бы свою политику. Но Порошенко только по крови еврей, не додумался.
@Justice_Xapn ДНР и ЛНР до последнего твердили что не хотят выходить из состава Украины. А нужно то было просто ввести федерализацию.
@Justice_Xapn Документально, Германия все еще оккупированная территория США. И 40 тыс. солдат на базе Рамштайн подтверждение этого.

@Justice_Xapn Замены на кого? Ставленников из России? Маловероятно. Путин много гибче. Подождите и он Вас удивит еще. Захарченко останется, пока некого.
@Justice_Xapn Думаю проект в процессе. Просто не афишируют лишний раз. Жаль только Украину как страну и ее жителей. Они заслуживают куда более лучшего.
@Justice_Xapn А как бы Вы поступили на их месте? Решите этот вопрос для себя и уверен, Вы поймете что Путин еще проявил огромное терпение.
@Justice_Xapn ... нас глупыми и не рассудительными ходами. ИМХО. Надеюсь на понимание и расположение.
@Justice_Xapn ... к этим вопросам со стороны "добра" удержали бы целостность и поддержку большинства. Не поздно и сейчас. Но думаю они и дальше будут ...
@Justice_Xapn ... и иже с ним товарищи, будучи знаменитой нацией, поступили довольно глупо. Не прочувствовали настроения на волне эйфории. Подойди они ...
@Justice_Xapn ... предположений много. Я не сторонник влазить в разборки славян. Думаю Вы и сами разберетесь. Но одно думаю для себя верно - Порошенко...

@DunganGwen What about the compliment ex KGB agent, why do you think that the KGB is not people? Are there people in the CIA? And the FBI people?
@DunganGwen To begin with, the Crimea (98% of the electorate) chose its own way. Until 1991, he was Russian and now just returned.

@Sparlingo2 @FarrellLawCA Again, this is not true. The Soviet Union only signed a non-aggression pact with Hitler. But Krupp, in 1938, received a loan from the US.
@Sparlingo2 @FarrellLawCA In Dresden, in addition to paintings and statues, nothing has happened. The fascists transferred production to the north of Germany.
@Sparlingo2 @FarrellLawCA I understand that you are sorry to read this, but there is a fact of history.
@Sparlingo2 @FarrellLawCA Admit it, America and England all the time "rubbed" somewhere near the war. But the fascists were defeated by Russians 90%.
@Sparlingo2 @FarrellLawCA US victories in the air are noteworthy only by the fact that they erased Dresden from the face of the earth. Which was empty from the troops
@Sparlingo2 @FarrellLawCA Then you need to say "Defeated the fascists in Africa" ... but they say about the common victory.

@Mirjana8Mirjana In any case, thank you for your comments. It's important for me.
@Mirjana8Mirjana I sent you a copy in English ... in Russian I printed you in a hurry. Excuse me, I'll try not to repeat this.
@Mirjana8Mirjana I publish news from around the world and I do not have the opportunity to carefully check their reliability.
@Mirjana8Mirjana As for Israel, I just reprint their media ... there is a source link.
@Mirjana8Mirjana Excuse me, I was recently written about Russia and I thought that you are in the same vein.
@Mirjana8Mirjana Excuse me, I was recently written about Russia and I thought that you are in the same vein.
@Mirjana8Mirjana If you prove that I wrote a lie, I will delete the Twitter account. With respect and hope for understanding ....
@Mirjana8Mirjana I'm not engaged in propaganda. I do not spread rumors. All that I publish real sayings. If you are not interested, do not read.
@Mirjana8Mirjana Do you know much from the speeches of Russian politicians? How many people on the planet know what they say and think in Russia?
