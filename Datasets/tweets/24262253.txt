@michaelgtravis I know! I didn't want him to stop "rambling" either!!!! when it's interesting, it's not rambling!!!!   thank you so so so much for listening, Michael!
@ndrapiza that absolutely makes TOTAL sense......total
@ndrapiza That — to me — sums up a great leader anywhere .....not just of a sports team.
@michaelgtravis Thanks for listening Michael!!!!!! He’s great, isn’t he?!??
@ndrapiza I’m old school.  I’ve seen offensive-minded HCs here try to do both and I’ve seen it with the OC in the box.  I like the latter because it feels more....organized for lack of better word. HC ultimate veto power too

My first podcast of 2019 and had a wonderful conversation with Jay Bilas @jaybilas about Michigan basketball (also some Michigan State hoops), NCAA rules reform, his passion for the Maori Davenport situation in Alabama and ... his acting career https://t.co/eJFlO7g8Nn

@frank_eldred would that really be so bad?
@unclejed34 i never said the HC isn't involved, but in all my years covering Michigan, there has been an OC in the box calling the plays. of course the game plan is created with input from the HC and offensive staff, but on game day -- one voice. one.
@BW2623 @bobwojnowski hahahaha....it was early 2017....he asked about Brandon Peters.
@frank_eldred come on Frank --- you do the honors!
@TheGregWagner i am LAUGHING OUT LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@unclejed34 he was saying "collaborative" and never fully explained it other than everyone would have a say....he wouldn't say who was calling plays. I asked 4 weeks into season and said Pep was calling "majority". in my world, one guy is the OC.
@bobwojnowski If I recall correctly, you received the first official Harbaugh eye roll
@Danny_Halling eyeroll! LOL
@SqdScoops @OldTakesExposed LOL LOL LOL. Thanks --- i was guilty of multi-tasking and failing while doing so! lol
@unclejed34 it was just --- amusing.....the eye roll.....it's not a big deal --- we disagreed...i think it's important to have an OC and he clearly believed being "collaborative" was fine.
@unclejed34 because he said it was going to be a collaborative process -- not have an OC
@SqdScoops @OldTakesExposed I don’t care.  And a few other notables were missed 🙄

@bongiornomd Understood!!
@bongiornomd Not my call
Ben Bredeson: "We’ve got a lot of work to put in this offseason and I think the guys are fired up. Everybody is feeling pretty shitty right now, but once we get back to workouts and get back together, I think this is going to fuel everybody for next year."
Shea Patterson: "We could be sitting here and talk negative, 'Michigan doesn’t win the big games' all we want. What else is there to say? We’re going to come back and work our asses off in the spring and we’re going to go from there. "
Shea Patterson was asked what the coaches said in the locker room after the game: “I honestly don’t remember -- I was so pissed off.”

@brandondarin im packing it and taking it back to Michigan with me.
@BlueSteel313 Yeah,  bowl representative last night said more Florida fans because of the proximity.

Florida OC John Hevesy worked with Don Brown at Brown for two years:  "Ask his wife about this story -- Plymouth State and he passed out on the field. Ask about it. He was the head coach of Plymouth State. (He passed out) from the adrenaline. Just the way he is." #notsurprised
Asked Florida WR Van Jefferson about Shea Patterson’s role being “the face” of immediate eligibility when they transferred from Ole Miss. Jefferson credited lawyer Tom Mars who represented the transfers and said he should thank Shea... and smiled
@corymjackson81 No. He has another year   Redshirt 2015

Shea Patterson “the best is yet to come”
“Christian Turner impressed me the day I stepped on campus” — Shea Patterson

Gentry says he’s considering leaving for the NFL Draft.   Got his grade. Wasn’t disappointed with it.  Wants to focus on the Peach
“In the right situation if it occurred....but not on anyone else’s terms but my own” — Don Brown asked if he wants to be a head coach again  “I talked to them (Temple).  I’d be lying if I didn’t (say that)”
Don Brown would like to see 12 team playoff
Don Brown on OSU “Day 1 mistakes made that were head scratchers to me.....I don’t live in the world of negativity.  I have to move a defensive group that despite it all in my opinion had a hell of a year. Gotta move forward”

@mccoym03 @bobwojnowski Sometimes you realize some friendships run their course. It happens.
@mccoym03 @bobwojnowski This “couple” remains intact. I could never “leave” Wojo — he actually respects me and doesn’t lie   He’s like having a ......pet! Lol
@mirth67 @JessSpeight52 (It really looks like an art installation piece)
@mirth67 @JessSpeight52 Why didn’t we think of this —- mom only allows white lights too!!!! Lol.  I looooooove this!!
@rwschumacher @theplayerthefan The “guns” are impressive, are they not?? Really surprised he didn’t break out the kilt so we could all admire the calves!
@internetraj 👏👏👏
@FredSDTW @bobwojnowski Believe it or not — it isn’t. Lol
@downi94 I like that too.  A lot
@MichiganManMMQ Really love your tree!!
@rmhsr That is outstanding!!!
@bobwojnowski For once in my life I agree with you.  I didn’t realize, however, common decency and respect would fall under “lower your expectations” but OK
@mirth67 That is really beautiful!!
@Oscareli @theplayerthefan I’ve been meaning to read this — @ChuckCulpepper1 is THE BEST
@Ebreezy0603 YES!!!!! you're good!
@xproofx i was thinking of it in terms of people who aren't worthy of your trust, but I get this, too! lol. Merry Christmas!
Read this quote tonight: "If I am to meet with a disappointment, the sooner I know it, the more of life I shall have to wear it off."   I liked that. Words to live by.
