So proud tonight #ImWithHer
@KatrinaNation good god you are insufferable
@KatrinaNation @thenation yeah whatever but if your boy doesn't support the nomination it's all a waste
@KatrinaNation all the more reason to support the party &amp; stop this Sander's charade - it's such a disappointment that The Nation misguides
@cheyannecouv Awesome!
@politico @BernieSanders Sanders won't do his part to unite the party - he could care less - should have shut him down long ago
@SOS_5050  I don't want or expect any, other than your fraud of a candidate to stop whining as he has his whole career and go	away #DNC2016

@realDonaldTrump @jimmykimmel @ABC you are shit

@mcspocky In such an important time in our history, that we have to deal with clowns like Trump and Sanders is beyond understanding

@WeNeedHillary @mcspocky It seems to take a while but ultimately people will realize that Bernie is simply a clown disguised as a reformer
@GunnersAFC he should stay - why not be a part of building the best club in Europe? It's going to happen - maybe not with AW but it will
@mcspocky he's too selfish - not a democrat - I don't understand why people think leaning farther left beats Trump - we need centrists
@NewRepublic Bernie only cares about Bernie - doesn't give a damn	about Democrats which he has made very clear for years - don't be fooled
@TDFNYC 	Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Roddy McDowell, Robert Goulet, 	and John Collum - How could one not fall in love with live theatre?
@TDFNYC 	Don't let it be forgot	That once there was a spot,	For one brief, shining moment	That was known as Camelot.
@TDFNYC my Mom - went to Camelot - hooked forever!
@SenSanders you're morally bankrupt - a fraud and a huckster - did you pay off the DNC for the privilege to run? you should be behind bars
@WestportDV Suddenbreakingnews for the upset!
makes a lot of sense #Imwithher https://t.co/zQVP6JEvZF
@thedailybeast he is funny but sad also
@DemocratMachine aren't you funny? Where's your home?
I'm sorry Hillary that my home state CT failed to give you the overwhelming victory you deserve - shame on us #VoteHillary #ImWithHer
@TPM BS should have never been allowed to run for leadership of the party - this travesty should never be repeated

@KatrinaNation just stop your Sanders charade and get serious about real political change - it happens steadily but slowly to be effective

Tiger! - tell Billy Payne to pound sand! - forget the Masters - show those fuqers the revenue loss without you - it's your private life!
Capello must be beside himself with Sir Alex
Granderson awesome! Go Yankees!!!
Just saw 'The Art of the Steal' - Barnes chose the wrong caretakers and Philly society remains thugs & thieves as he feared - a sad story.
I guess offshore drilling is not the President's April Fools prank

‚òõUSA hockey awesome‚òö
Saw #asingleman last night - worth it for Colin Firth's performance
@TheFrisky most people are stupid also
So disenchanted with Clichy & Denilson - I would try more of Traore & Ramsey,	if nothing else to shake up the first two or ship them out
‚ùÑshaun‚òÆwhite simply awesome‚ùÑ
@ArtKnowledge but the Sabarsky has closed???
Come on Bendtner! find the net today
That's it Rooney!
@ZagatBuzz Gramercy Tavern!
One of the few days I'm pulling for ManU - show Milan how it's done
At the Met seeing Carmen - love NY
#America's Cup - Oracle - One Rich Asshole Called Larry Ellison - taking all sportsmanship from sailing's most revered trophy - a sad time
#sb44 SAINTS RULE!!!!!
@JozyAltidore17 Congratulations on your goal - hope it's the first of many
John Terry no longer England captain - is it true?
Attended the David Levine memorial yesterday - a mensch in the truest sense and a great artist - a lasting joy to have known him...
@godstoneranch Well done - awesome effort by all!!!
@godstoneranch Come on Paul - find another second - get the Mazdas!!!
#SOTU Robert Scheer's column from Jan 26 sums it up well http://www.truthdig.com/report//item/the_sorry_state_of_the_union_20100126/
@ZagatBuzz my favorite romantic restaurant in NY is Erminia, 250 E 83
RT @ZagatBuzz: PLS RT! Valentine‚Äôs Day is coming up & we want to know: What‚Äôs the best spot for romantic dining in your city?
Please read Tom Friedman in the NY Times today
@DanicaPatrick google Hoeffler - he's one of the most respected type designers working today - maybe commission him for a unique look :)

Here's hoping Martha Coakley prevails - show Ms Palin and her heartless disciples what's right
@susannahbreslin good writing is never blathering
Great game today Eduardo
@Tate IMHO when a museum legitimizes Warhol's claim or shows 'artists' like Koons, et al. that plagerize other's creativity, it's a sad day
@wsjcouch except they didn't exist 10 yes ago :)
Mauro Zarate would be a great signing - hope it's true
@whitneymuseum why so cold? Do you represent the museums view?
Here's hoping Eduardo hits the target today - Go Gunners!
RT @jagan520: NYRB will get its just desserts for treating David Levine so shabbily in his last days
@nprscottsimon use one of those constant read thermometers with the dial attached outside the oven - no guesswork reaching the perfect temp
Kudos to Gail Collins in the NY Times today on Liebermann
Definition of smarmy: think Joe Lieberman - got it kids?
@MoRocca nope
Lieberman's antics reinforce the need for term limits in the legislative branch - sadly, he's one of many buffoons planted there...
Dreamt last nite that Sen Lieberman died a slow, painful death w/o healthcare - wouldn't that be just for CT's self-serving asshole?
Gunners get a break for a change - we needed it - let's get healthy
It's not just that Sen. Lieberman betrays his CT constituency, I'm tired of his oratory and loathe the little fuqer...
Tell us Senator Lieberman, how does Hadassah live with a dopey cunt?
Standard Liege doesn't deserve to compete at this level
Stop Lieberman! Any senator who filibusters the public option should lose their chairmanship http://bit.ly/31uhkO @credomobile Please RT
GODZILLA!!!
Spent the afternoon at the Emirates - nothing beats it - back to the USA tomorrow
Wenger's critics are eunuchs at a gang-bang. (G. Burns)
Arsenal iPhone app is well thought out - congrats
Whoa Gazidis??? Really excited about your appointment - but now just another wanker... Wenger performs - You?
Gunners chief needs a muzzle
each to his own? -  taliban lives - women die - we can't leave
Congratulations President Obama for the Nobel
E. A. D. Silva - fox in a box

Adebayor = Asshole
A yellow card when seen diving - a two match ban when not - makes a lot of sense
Just finished watching Arsenal vs ManU - is it too much that FSC hire unbiased commentators?
3 of Everton's best players are injured but 6-1 -- very impressive Gunners!
JOBA!!!!
There is no upside for Schumacher - F1 is not for oldsters
Inter plays like they're down a man
With or w/o Adebayor, we still need to find more goals - we can't afford another season like the last
M Owen & E Adebayor are so over rated - right now perspective is lost
The shame about USA advancing against Spain is their worthless coach keeps his job!
Wenger's a proven winner - the board needs to help him maintain the current roster to develop our next "Invincibles"
Congrats to Shakhtar Donetsk
Shame on the University of Notre Dame
Song very impressive
The energy of your fans world wide will be with you at the Emirates- Do It Gunners!
Whenever Arsenal plays with heart, no matter the result, it's a good day
Arsenal 2 Middlesbrough 0 The joy of Cesc
Dreaming that some day Arsenal will be healthy!
