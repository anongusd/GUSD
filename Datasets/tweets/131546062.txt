RT @SenRubioPress: Today my colleagues unanimously passed a resolution @SenRickScott and I introduced to honor the victims &amp; survivors of #‚Ä¶
Nothing we say can bring back the lives that were lost. Nothing we do can replace the angels of MSD High School that were taken from us too soon. But we must honor their memory every day. #MSDStrong
Today we remember Peter Wang, 15. Peter dreamed of being a soldier and was posthumously accepted to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Peter risked his life to save his classmates and was awarded with the Medal of Heroism award.
Today we remember Carmen Schentrup, 16. Carmen was a dedicated student who was driven to become a medical researcher and find a cure for ALS. Both her parents Philip &amp; April and her siblings Robert &amp; Evelyn are all focused on activism nationwide.
Today we remember Alex Schachter, 14. Alex was a great young man and a talented trombone player in the MSD marching band. His father Max has been part of the MSD School Safety Commission and has been a powerful voice to prevent future tragedies.
Today we remember Helena Ramsay, 17. Helena was an incredibly smart young girl who participated in many school activities. She cared deeply about her community and other communities in FL. She went to Orl for a concert after the Pulse night club shooting to support the community.
Today we remember Meadow Pollack, 18. Meadow was an extremely smart young lady. Her father, @AndrewPollackFL and brother @PollackHunter have been partners in fighting to keep our schools safe. But more importantly, they both have become a great friend to me.
Today we remember Alaina Petty, 14. Alaina had a servant‚Äôs heart. After Hurricane Irma, I met her family when they volunteered to help storm victims. Her father, @rpetty has been very involved in passing legislation for school safety and joined me in TLH to ensure it got done.
Today we remember Joaquin Oliver, 17. Known as ‚ÄúGuac‚Äù to friends and family, he loved sports and graffiti and was a beloved son to his parents.
Today we remember Gina Montalto, 14. Gina was a freshman and member of the winter guard team. Gina‚Äôs father Tony Montalto is the president of Stand with Parkland, an organization founded by all 17 victims‚Äô parents.
Today we remember Cara Loughran, 14. Cara was an incredible young lady who loved Irish dancing and was a part of the Drake School of Irish Dance in Coral Springs.
Today we remember Luke Hoyer, 15. Luke loved basketball and chicken nuggets. His mom Gena was by my side when I signed the MSD High School Public Safety Act. Gena and her husband Tom are fighting for safe schools across the nation.
Today we remember Chris Hixon, 49. A loving father, veteran, athletic director and wrestling coach who had a huge impact on the lives of his students. His legacy lives on with the Chris Hixon Athletic Scholarship, which helps further the education of student-athletes.
Today we remember Jaime Guttenberg, 14. A bright young girl and dancer. Jaime had a heart for those with disabilities. She was involved in many organizations such as Best Buddies and the Friendship initiative.
Today we remember Coach Aaron Feis, 37, the assistant coach for the MSD Varsity football team. He died a hero, shielding a student from a bullet. We created the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program in his honor.
Today we remember Nicholas Dworet, 17. Nicholas was a senior and the captain of the school‚Äôs swim team. He enjoyed swimming competitively, and was planning to attend the University of Indianapolis. Eventually he wanted to swim in the 2020 Olympics in Sweden.
Today we remember Martin Duque, 14. Martin was born in Mexico and moved to the U.S. with his family to live the American dream. He was a cadet in JROTC where he received many awards including the Medal of Heroism.
Today we remember Scott Beigel, 35. Scott, a geography teacher at MSD, risked his life to help students hide from the shooting. He is forever remembered as a hero.
Today we remember Alyssa Alhadeff, 14. A beloved daughter and dedicated soccer player at her school. Her mother Lori Alhadeff, now a Broward County School Board member, continues the fight to ensure our schools are safe.
On the 1-year anniversary of the tragedy in Parkland, we remember the 17 souls that were taken from us in a brutal act of violence. They were bright lights with bright futures ‚Äì the kind of young men and women that made me proud to represent the state of Florida. #MSDStrong

I have seen firsthand the devastation that Hurricane Michael left in it‚Äôs wake. I‚Äôve activated the FL disaster fund to help assist these communities as they recover. The easiest way to help is to donate- text the word DISASTER to 20222 to make a one-time donation of $10.
There are hundreds of emergency management officials in the Panhandle working around the clock to do everything they can to coordinate resources, volunteers, and supplies coming into their communities. We cannot thank them enough for their hard work and dedication.
In four days, I have met with countless families &amp; communities that have been impacted by this storm. I have seen the devastation that Michael has brought to so many. We will not stop until our state has fully recovered.

Tenemos que nos queda una cantidad finita de tiempo en estas posiciones. Vamos a luchar juntos hasta nuestro √∫ltimo minuto en el cargo, para asegurar el futuro de la Florida para todas y cada una de sus familias.
Estoy orgulloso del trabajo que hemos logrado juntos para asegurar el futuro de la Florida creando un ambiente donde los floridanos de todas las edades tienen las herramientas que necesitan para tener √©xito en nuestro estado. Pero nuestro trabajo no ha concluido.
El pueblo de Venezuela merece libertad y democracia. Estoy luchando por legislaci√≥n que impida a las agencias estatales invertir en cualquier compa√±√≠a que haga negocios con el r√©gimen de Maduro.
No creo que nadie haya podido predecir la tormenta monumental en que se convirti√≥ el Hurac√°n Irma. Pero los floridanos decidimos unirnos y enfrentarlo todos juntos. La respuesta y la solidaridad que demostr√≥ nuestro estado me hicieron sentir muy orgulloso de ser Gobernador.
Yo quiero que en el 2018 los votantes de la Florida aprueben una enmienda constitucional haga m√°s dif√≠cil a los pol√≠ticos aumentar los impuestos. Por lo menos dos tercios de la legislatura tendr√°n que votar a favor de un incremento de impuestos para que se convierta en ley.
Hemos creado un ambiente donde el sector privado agreg√≥ casi 1.5 millones de empleos, el PIB creci√≥ 26%, el valor de las viviendas se dispar√≥, la deuda estatal se redujo en $9 mil millones, y la tasa de desempleo baj√≥ de m√°s de 10%, al nivel m√°s bajo en 10 a√±os, de apenas 3.6%.
En el 2010, cuando fui candidato a Gobernador, promet√≠ cambiar el statu-quo y crear un ambiente donde las empresas pudieran tener √©xito y crear empleos para las familias de la Florida, y los resultados hablan por s√≠ mismos.
We have a finite amount of time left in these positions. Let‚Äôs all fight together until our last minute in office to secure Florida‚Äôs future for each and every family.
I am proud of the work we have accomplished together to secure Florida‚Äôs future by creating an environment where Floridians of all ages have the tools they need to succeed. But, our work is not done.
The people of Venezuela deserve freedom and democracy. I am fighting for legislation that blocks state agencies from investing in any company doing business with the Maduro regime.
Since 2013, I have awarded nearly 13,000 Florida veterans with the Governor‚Äôs Veterans Service Award.
Since 2011, 20,000 children in foster care have been adopted.
Overcoming addiction requires incredible strength and bravery and we must make sure that resources are available to help people get the treatment they need. This year, I have proposed to invest $53 million to fight opioid abuse in Florida.
I encourage the Legislature to pass a bill that protects state employees who witness their colleagues being harassed or victimized. I want to ensure the identities of these brave individuals are protected so they feel encouraged to participate in investigations.
No one in Florida who has been a victim of crime should feel ashamed. Victims of crime or harassment deserve to have their voices heard. Last year, we took a step forward to protect those in state government who were victimized. But it is clear that more must be done.
I am also proud to support a measure that is going through the Constitution Revision Commission to give free tuition to the families of fallen first responders, state law enforcement officers and military members who have lost their lives in the line of duty.
Our law enforcement have done an incredible job protecting Florida families and I hope the Legislature will support my proposed pay raise of $30 million for all state sworn officers this year.
I saw firsthand the devastation on the island and I have tried to help the people of Puerto Rico any way I could... and my goal is that Florida be the most welcoming place for people displaced by Hurricane Maria.
I don't think anyone could have predicted the mammoth storm Hurricane Irma would become. But, Floridians came together and faced Hurricane Irma head on. The response and solidarity that was shown by our state was one of the proudest moments that I have had as Governor.
Also, my tax cut package this year will truly benefit every single Floridian- it includes reducing driver's license fees and hurricane preparedness sales tax holidays.
I want 2018 to be the year that Florida voters pass a constitutional amendment that makes it harder for politicians to raise taxes. My proposal would require 2/3rds of the legislature to vote on a tax increase for it to become law.
We‚Äôve created an environment where our private sector has added nearly 1.5 million jobs, our GDP has grown 26%, home values have skyrocketed, we‚Äôve decreased state debt by $9 billion, and our unemployment rate has dropped to a 10-year low of 3.6%.
In 2010, when I ran for Governor, I promised to change the status quo and create an environment where businesses can succeed and create jobs for Florida families, and the results speak for themselves.
I stand here today, at the beginning of my last year as Governor, thankful for the opportunity that we have all had to help our beloved State of Florida.
Honored to deliver my final State of the State today. Tune into the @floridachannel at 11AM!
