We will continue to use every tool in our arsenal to transform this headwind of intolerance into a tailwind of inclusion and opportunity
We are using long-standing tools to address an emerging challenge that threatens freedom of people who want to realize the American Dream

These issues are non-partisan. Our efforts are a reflection of our values as a society. http://go.usa.gov/2Nw

While nearly a decade has passed since 9/11, we continue to see a steady stream of violence and discrimination
In each city where I have met with leaders of these communities, I have been struck by the sense of fear – fear of violence, bigotry & hate
These meetings allow us to learn about civil rights violations where they occur, & to build bridges to the community, to built trust
AAG Perez: We have vastly expanded outreach. I have met with local Muslim, Arab, Sikh and South Asian leaders around the country.
In the 3 & 1/2 months following 9/11, more than 300 federal criminal investigations were initiated in response to hate incidents.
