@Joeosborn1911 @JessPalise @realDonaldTrump @staceyabrams @BrianKempGA So because you were in one polling place and saw 5 black peoples have no issues, that rules out voter suppression in all of Georgia? Ok üëçüèª

@JessPalise @Joeosborn1911 @realDonaldTrump @staceyabrams @BrianKempGA A federal judge on Tuesday found that Gwinnett County violated the Civil Rights Act in its handling of absentee ballots during last week's midterm elections, a ruling that will likely delay the overall vote tally in the state's tight gubernatorial race.
