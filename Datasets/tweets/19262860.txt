Buster Olney lost my respect with Pujols story. Based on heresay, not facts. thought he was reporter. guess he justs wants 2 create headline
@S_Ardent it all depends on how you setup your advertising campaigns. traffic can be very targeted so conversion % should be higher
@S_Ardent your questions are broad and answers will vary depending on your niche. Yes-convert to sales. Yes-cn use for traffic as well
@danymoussa thanks for the info
@S_Ardent what would you like to know about facebook ads? i use them
@mikebuechele creating alot of different styles of ads and then narrowing them down to the best converting ones really has helped me
@ChristopherM thanks Chris for the effort!  :)
@mikebuechele 1 thing i was spending too much on my ads, used their gauge to cut my bid costs down. also use their ideas to create more ads
Reuters: Facebook sees ad potential bigger than Google search http://is.gd/8Sp6C
@ChristopherM ok thanks
@ChristopherM interesting...what's the wootheme ad say?
good start RT @PeterDJohnson: Facebook advertising targeted/effective-here's article 2 help u understand how it works http://ow.ly/19mJ4
@Karina_Anne i've had success with facebook ads, you got questions?
@officialanthony facebook is great for branding your business as well.
@howdous facebook or adwords, depends on what you're trying to accomplish.  what do you plan on advertising for?
@paulwoods how are you judging your market size using facebook ads? curious!
what droid app do you use for your twitter account?  anything other than twidroid?
@brokemf sorry but that's what i used to learn fb ads and it's working for me
@Lafaith not sure it's more powerful overall but i would say you get a much better bang for your buck if you know how to use it properly
@ronnietucker i'm having lots of success promoting my business and alot of products. you got questions...maybe i can help
@kinocac i bought a course about it and learned alot.  just 1 idea from the course i got saved me almost 40% on my bid prices. well worth it
@AJ_Mazza i use it with success c my reply to @vanetworking learned my techniques for fb ads from this course i bought http://is.gd/8Sc4R
@vanetworking i use facebook ads, works great. can target my ads precisely. getting ads approved is the biggest bump in the road. questions?
@nastyadrebot i use facebook advertising alot.  you got questions?
@mikebuechele hey Mike, here's a course that i bought and used to start my facebook ads.  had alot of cool tactics.  http://is.gd/8Sc4R
@RuthHendrickson i use facebook ads and they are alot cheaper and alot more targeted
@brokemf  i use fb ads too and they are way cheaper than google for me. learned from this course i bought about fb ads.  http://is.gd/8Sc4R
@brokemf wow, your google campaign was cheaper than facebook?  that's wild, why do you think that happened?
@lauren_clapp probably not enough advertisers with ads targeted to your specific style so you're getting the default facebook ads
@danymoussa i use fb ads too. finding better conversions when my ads link to my fanpages in fb rather than an external site...how bout you?
@nmoawad i use fb ads as well. like how targeted u can get. i learned cool tactics for fb from this course i bought.  http://is.gd/8Sc4R
@nmoawad are your fb ads linking to your websites or another page in fb?  I'm finding better conversions when sending them to a fb fanpage.

@HarlanLaw that's good to know, things are always different from state to state
@DanCordoba yeah, I thought so too, Dan
@dlynch741 ...i'll just throw it out there, "well I guess I can't give you my cash", not caring what happens & I get an about face from them
@dlynch741 ...I like to use it when the seller is being tough and causing problems, usually I don't want those type of deals anyway so...
@dlynch741 well that depends on the prospect...if you feel that they are wanting to strike the deal, it works if you're quibbling over stuff

@John_Corey I like your style, John...so true, there's a hectic nature to short sales
@John_Corey thanks friend, r u actively working short sales?
@Joytou maybe so, but it is vital in completing the short sale as the rep has to wait for answers from the entity that owns the loan as well
with short sales you need to stay on top of each account by following thru to make sure the lender's rep does what he says he's going to do.

@Melissa_Kim It's generally a case by case situation, not tryin to scare u just make u aware. You're just going to have to ask. Good luck.
@Melissa_Kim I don't know your situation, but typically a short sale will only be considered by a lender if you are behind on payments

was going for a run, wow, still too cold outside, going to the gym
going to meet with a builder to discuss some properties he wants to sell...this could get interesting.
@miad20 lender's will consider a SS if the property is in default. SS are used alot for property in distress from economics or bad condition
an SS is a transaction when you negotiate with a lender to accept a payoff on a mortgage that is less than the balance owed to that lender.
it's so cold outside that my contacts are foggin up again when i come inside, but it was worth it I got 2 new short sales to work on

If you operate your business following the law and guidelines set forth, your risk is  lowered greatly, greed leads most to cross the line

@katyagent sounds like he might have known the ins and outs of foreclosure, alot of homeowners don't
@TucsonAZ I think she meant the actual foreclosure deadlines, I dunno I walked in halfway over, but the segment was called "squat or not"
@known actually we use the phones more, we are always talkin short sales with loss mitigation reps in are real estate investiing
someone tell the loss mitigation people that and the short sale specialists
Gerri Willis on CNN had a segment called "to squat or not"  talking about "forestalling foreclosure" she says "the deadlines don't matter"..
wondering how does my laptop get so dirty but my phones don't
just about got a lender where I need him for this short sale, but will have to show him even "better" numbers I think

@TerenceChang enough cash to buy a house or a downpayment?  that can affect how you approach buying a home.
@daadams I once bought a 10 person pack from Mac, ate it for a week, was working hard on my real estate investing course, did'nt want 2 stop
@TerenceChang do you have any previous knowledge in the industry, what are you interested in focusing on in real estate investing?
@TerenceChang it's great time to buy, you need to get to know where to buy in your area, know the neighborhood's values first to see deals
going to meet with some people in foreclosure, glad it's a great house in a nice neighborhood because the snow would hide any outside issues
@lilywarrior you're right, it's a soup day, but they put enough calories/fat in the food to kill a small horse. Mac has great sandwiches too
@RealtorPaul is Rio only in your area?
