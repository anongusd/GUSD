@OGDavidGNowak U can, but are more likely to indulge in other ways such, as buying food and other items on the route. You can create a million scenarios and it will still equate to participating, thus the hypocrisy. U don't get to steal and credibily criticize someone who steals.
@OGDavidGNowak I beg to differ. Mardi Gras is literally centered around thrashing plastic. Actively participating and then criticizing is hypocritical at best. You don't get to negatively criticize something as an opposer when to enjoyed the benefits of it. That's out of Order. 🤷🏽‍♂️

@Talkmaster @MaraGay In a republic the power lies in the people. If a citizen cannot oppose the government it has no power over it. The government has complete control. Like it or not, we are a democracy posing as a republic. 🤷🏽‍♂️
@Talkmaster @MaraGay Actually, the United States was founded as a republic but operates as a Democracy. To oppose the US is domestic terrorism under law. Therefore since we cannot overthrow it, the Gov has all the power not the people, hence we are now a democracy and no longer a republic. 🤷🏽‍♂️
@MaraGay @jbouie Right, because the uneducated, indoctrinated, institutionalized, media mind-controlled and manipulated masses need to decide who leads the country. 😏🙄 No thanks. The few have always governed the masses for a reason. 🤷🏽‍♂️

@treadway_pd_67 @bakermind @RealCandaceO SMH, u seem 2 have comprehension deficiencies: 50% of all research has not been fact-checked or verified. In other words only 1/2 of what we consider facts are such. Also, I support reading the actual documents and oppose relying on 3rd-party accounts when the docs are available.
The only thing I dislike is @HelenaMorenoLA's habit of introducing legislation which protects individual groups instead of the community as a whole. But nonetheless, I'm glad she's one of NOLA's leaders. We couldn't have asked for better.
Of all the newly elected councilmembers I must say that I'm excited that @HelenaMorenoLA is a part of the team. Her strong-minded temperament, intelligence, and experience make a great and much-needed addition to New Orleans legislation.

@joellejay @DennisPoole7 @dday_dba @eugenegu @DLoesch @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 1/ Meaning Digi. Comm. can be used as evidence. Again, the DOJ nor any other EO or dept. determines what the law is. Truly we both make valid opposing arguments but the issue has yet to be challenged. My
@RealCandaceO I support neither party, and desire for the general public to understand we operate under “New-Federalism,” which both major parties support. All else is propaganda aimed to maintain control of the populous- as divisive issues do. We should focus on issues which unite like Ed.
@lukipela @RealCandaceO 🤦🏽‍♂️ You keep diverting and negating the fact that the general public’s view of political parties is skewed and founded on propaganda, and is distinct from the actual parties’ general positions.
@Methadras @zakiedwards @angela_rye Amen.
@joellejay @DennisPoole7 @dday_dba @eugenegu @DLoesch @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The law allows public officials to separate personal from government business. Nice try though. Spicer is only partially correct, and we also have to consider his personal bias. :)
@joellejay @DennisPoole7 @dday_dba @eugenegu @DLoesch @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump @POTUS When dealing with law and government, one must pay close attention to word usage. :)
@joellejay @DennisPoole7 @dday_dba @eugenegu @DLoesch @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The WH does not make laws, nor interprets them. Secondly, being a judge doesn't equate to knowing more than anyone, and if not in a court of law, he's merely providing a personal opinion. Issues in court are argued by lawyers with two different positions of the law. IJS.
@joellejay @DennisPoole7 @dday_dba @eugenegu @DLoesch @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The link states that Trump's tweets are "official statements." That applies to everyone on twitter. Lol. If the President doesn't make a statement directly from the seat of his office, then it's not officially from his office. In law and government, it would be in writing.
@xrangerd @bakermind @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO My sentiments exactly.
@Merklesquieu @RealCandaceO The parties didn't switch lines. JFK was alone in proposing the Civil Rights Act. LBJ and the DNC opposed it. They only passed it to honor JFK. This persuaded voters to align with the Democrats who only promoted KKK members within the party. It was not the position of the party.
@SouthernGhosts @bakermind @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO I disagree. The War was fought solely on the basis of maintaining slavery. I formerly held your position until I actually began to read the records of that time. True there were slaves in the North, but the issue of slavery was used to defeat the South- the basis of the war.
@bakermind @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Which is why when I ran for office, I did so with no party affiliation. I despise both, but more so the DNC because they have stronger control of the populous and continue to keep us enslaved to government instead of providing the liberty the federalist founding fathers intended
@bakermind @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO #TRUTH When will the general public realize that neither party operates in the interest of the general public? They nominate and support candidates that support their own interests. This is why when I ran for office, I did so with no party affiliation.
@TyreBiter85 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS. :)
@TyreBiter85 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Negative. You're just not reading. Nowhere is this particular thread have I said such. Also, when someone accuses a person of making a false statement, it's up to them to prove them wrong. The OPer did not reply. I'm speaking in terms of the commenter. Nice try though. :)
@bakermind @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO If you read my multiple replies, I've stated that the positions of the parties have change and both support new-federalism. The OP is saying the ideals or positions of the parties themselves have "switched." This is false.
@Merklesquieu @RealCandaceO Maybe you should have read for understanding rather than to rebuttal. The position of the parties is distinct from the "switching" of voters. ;) That's the change, but it has nothing to do with the PARTIES. I implied that if we consider a switch it was by voters, not parties. ;)
@bakermind @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO The Civil War was founded solely on slavery. This has been verified by multiple scholars on the subject. The issue of State's rights is a fallacy. The Confederacy was not considered a part of the United States. The position of State's rights was the argument to maintain slavery.
@senseimikado @RealCandaceO 🤦🏽‍♂️ *Sighs* New-Federalism is the current state of American Democracy and both sides support it. Therefore, neither party holds their original positions, and that doesn’t equate to a switch in political ideals and positions by the parties. How’s that?
@wrxmanpaul @gnixon88 @guardian @ILGAEurope I digress. The sentiments of the people don’t always align with the legislation and positions of their representatives. IJS. Passing new laws doesn’t completely change the overall position. IJS.
@lukipela @RealCandaceO Lol. The voting support of the general public, which is founded on propaganda, does not equate to a “switch” in the parties themselves. That’s my initial argument. 🤷🏽‍♂️
@zakiedwards @susaneresendiz @angela_rye You need to read the replies. Moreover, blacks were in better economic positions during those times than they are now. The benevolent societies which carried the community are now obsolete.
@wrxmanpaul @gnixon88 @guardian @ILGAEurope That’s doesn’t mean they are liberal. IJS. Statistically the country is conservative.
@hardtruth4real @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO I have read it three times. Have digital and audio copies and read Hillary Clinton’s thesis which praises Alinksy has her mentor.
@evenkeelkelly @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO No, there are several. Nice try though. Did you actually read?
@melvinramone @RealCandaceO You’re diverting. If you disagree then PROVE me wrong. If not search for the links in the thread. I’m not gonna hold your hand. 😂
@melvinramone @RealCandaceO There are at least three, but I have more on my computer. Try looking at the GPO, LOC, websites and search for the records. They are there. I may consider writing and publishing a research paper on the subject. The records are available.
@F86gsh @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO I'll check it out.
@lukipela @RealCandaceO I digress. Ur personal attacks w/o disproof of my contentions make you unqualified. You simply have not learned enough about conventional politics or the positions of the parties and stating your opinion of my statements without supporting info of your own. Nice try though.
@lukipela @RealCandaceO Ugh. The records of Congress in regards to both parties do not support a switch. It does support a change in both, which is due to new-federalism. Both sides support it making the perceptions of the general public of both sides FALSE.
@HalenIV Scientific facts are subjective and it takes having more faith in science and "scholarly research" than to believe in God, believe it or not.
@HalenIV Agreed, but new information shows 50% of studies have not been replicated and the vast majority hasn't been considered for verification. I.e. Even scientific facts are only 50% factual. All news is propaganda though.
@lukipela @RealCandaceO In regards to the OP and topic, I have done the research and have thoroughly examined the argument. There is nothing to support it. Your opinion is not a FACT. We have already concluded that neither party currently holds their original positions. There was no switch.
@RobertJackson55 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Agreed. I don't believe I was combative either, and you misinterpreted my text probably because there's no emotional connotation to convey my sentiments. It was not my intent to be offending. All I was saying was that there's no evidence to support the statement in the OP.
@susaneresendiz @zakiedwards @angela_rye #FACTS Blacks have remained in poverty prior to and even more so since the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Which is why I have no idea why they continue to vote DEM as if it's been working for them- that's insanity.
@wrxmanpaul @gnixon88 @guardian More than likely because in reference to teachers, that's something that they can control and regulate, and I doubt the U.S. government would support such a cause. In knowing that the UK is predominately conservative, how is it that you perceive them to be "inclusive" of LGBTs?
In this age, it's difficult to be an intellectual, because it's so easy to succumb to propaganda and misinformation. The 10%,1%, and Gov. have done an excellent job of diminishing the education of American citizens in order to maintain control over the populous.
@brightlibra @Mark4D777 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO No, it's not. The parties didn't switch, the voting of the general public did. Look at the record.
@reesetheone1 @Grayrealm @RealCandaceO Not consistently. The Act secured 93% of the AA vote- the highest ever in history. Moreover, the Act was passed to honor JFK, not to help blacks. It's on the Congressional record. LBJ opposed the Act and was an open racist. https://t.co/OXdoxubB05
@Jeff29680 @realrightpmg @RealCandaceO I'm just going to sit this here: You do better checking LBJ's voting record yourself than parroting information. https://t.co/OXdoxubB05

@realrightpmg @Jeff29680 @RealCandaceO I'm going to just sit this right here and ask you to check LBJ's actual voting record. You're making yourself look crazy by defending a known racist. IJS. https://t.co/OXdoxubB05
@Cici_94Percent @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Can you provide me with which history book supports your statement? It appears to be unfounded, opinionated and doesn't support the positions or of either party since inception.
@melvinramone @RealCandaceO Sensitive? Just stating the obvious. Moreover, I posted no link from PragerU. Lol. I digress. Clearly, you're not willing to offer any viable information on the subject.
@realrightpmg @RealCandaceO LBJ also said: "I'll have those n****** voting Democrat for 200 years." I.e. The part ideals have not changed in that regard. Don't be a follower, verify, verify, verify.
@realrightpmg @RealCandaceO Here are more facts for you: LBJ opposed the passing of the Act but the party did it to honor JFK. It's written in his address to Congress. More Democrats voted against the Act that Republicans. Verify dude, and stop parroting misinformation.
@RobertJackson55 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Negative. It's always better to ask before ASSuming. She said I was wrong with no effort to disprove me, but you want me to carry the burden of proof? GTHOH! Moreover, I have provided a few links. Pay attention if you intend to criticize. :)
@melvinramone @RealCandaceO I actually provided links to support my contentions. Where are yours? Why do liberals make personal attacks instead of attacking the information? PSA: I support neither party. I support and seek the truth.
@Lavainem @RobertJackson55 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Be careful! https://t.co/nBv9DUX0zM
@zakiedwards @angela_rye LBJ was actually opposed to passing the Act.
@zakiedwards @angela_rye The Civil Rights Act was not brought by the left. It was proposed by JFK alone. More Democrats voted against it than Republicans. They passed it merely to honor JFK. Democrats are not pushing for reform. That's propaganda. They in FACT support new-federalism just as the RNC.
@HubsThelonious @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO My sentiments exactly.
@jgjolmesli @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO I actually posted a link to the voting record in another reply. :)
@melvinramone @RealCandaceO You can't be a real lawyer with such an unfounded statement. Lol. Your statement implies the voting of the general public switched, not the ideals or positions of the political parties, which is implied in the OP. LOL. Nice try though.
@RobertJackson55 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO When did the usage of the word "futile" become offensive or unprofessional? Lol. We need to do more to enhance the education of Americans. We're dying of ignorance and easy manipulation. IJS.
@jamesspider4 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO  https://t.co/umrF6vJzPq
@RobertJackson55 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO *Yawns* Another weak argument by you- making personal attacks rather than addressing the information in the OP or comments. This is twitter dude, not a place of business. I.e. This is NOT a professional setting. SHM. I digress, I've lost enough brain cells addressing you.
@Grayrealm @RealCandaceO A lot of people in this thread are mixing the sentiments of voters with that of the political parties. That is unjust and inaccurate.
@Grayrealm @RealCandaceO The South became more Republican on account of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That's the correlation. It had NOTHING to do with party ideals, positions or platforms. All of that revolved around the passing of ONE bill into law. Have you read the comments in this thread?
@lukipela @RealCandaceO Tsk. An accusation with no evidence to support your claim. Bias much? I challenge you to prove me wrong since I'm a "Liar." Lol.
@RobertJackson55 @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Negative. I only stand on what I can prove, and I told no one to take my word. This topic is lengthy when it comes to research. I don't expect anyone to take my word. I expect them to research and investigate my claims, as I have theirs. I researched this topic years ago though.
@RobertJackson55 @RealCandaceO Also, new-federalism is our current form of government, which is why the RNC appears not to support dual-federalism. It has little to nothing to do with party ideals and platforms.
@RobertJackson55 @RealCandaceO Early Republicans were federalist, which defies the logic in your statement. The Civil War was NOT fought over State's rights. The Confederacy was not considered a part of the United States. Lincoln's push for the Emancipation of slaves is also contradictory to your statement.
@zakiedwards @angela_rye Please inform me of what has the left done for AAs in the past 50 years? I'll wait. :)
@LowLevelGeorge @SirLochlin @JacobyChrisrt @RealCandaceO Although I disagree, that the parties have adopted to their constituents. That's false.
@LowLevelGeorge @SirLochlin @JacobyChrisrt @RealCandaceO Exactly. The RNC is no longer conservative due to new-federalism, and the DNC is definitely NOT what they perceive to be to the general public. New-federalism is the position of both sides. All else is an illusion.
@Texanarchist @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO @DineshDSouza Which is why I rely on the records themselves and draw my own conclusion from that alone, and not from some author with an agenda or special interest. The numbers and records don't lie- people do.
@MyDoyers @RealCandaceO I was referring to the public's voter support, as in White Southern Voters, not the congressional vote. Nice try though. Lol.
@Jordenius @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Exactly.
@thejenn999 @RealCandaceO LBJ is quoted as saying: "I'll have those n****** voting democrat for 200 years. I researched the validity of this statement and it is verifiably true. The primary source was a black guy who worked for LBJ in the WH. LBJ often referred to him a n****, as he recalled.
@Texanarchist @trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO @DineshDSouza Personally, I don't condone the reliance on others, such as media or special interest groups. Youtube is NOT a reliable source. Try reading the actual documents pertaining to the subject. Eg. Congressional records.
@trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Bear with me while I find the bookmarks to the voting records of the people in the past presidential elections and the congressional hearings.
@LowLevelGeorge @SirLochlin @JacobyChrisrt @RealCandaceO I don't think anyone has said the platforms are the same. But to state that the parties "switched" positions is completely false. Neither party's platform is the same.
@gnixon88 @wrxmanpaul @guardian While I agree, it's subject to interpretation. Persuasion may be perceived as force. I'm just stating from the position as the courts have opined on related issues.
@trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO https://t.co/t3Box6LTMe
@trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO *Sighs* FACT ONE: More Democrats voted against the Civil Rights Act than Republicans: https://t.co/EV3XgfCmk1 This supports my statement that the parties never "switched."
@thejenn999 @RealCandaceO Furthermore, more Democrats voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than Republicans, which further supports that the claim the parties "switched" is a fallacy. https://t.co/EV3XgfCmk1
@thejenn999 @RealCandaceO Insofar as the 93% turnaround? 1964.
@trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO Plus, the burden of proof is on YOU to disprove my statements, which would be futile anyway. IJS.
@trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO That's not what I'm saying at all. I was referring to Candace's statement. Unlike others, I only stand on what I can actually prove. All you have to do is read the records. It's all there and available on many gov sites. IJS. Do your own homework.
@RevGeraldPalmer @RealCandaceO The major political parties never "switched."
@RealCandaceO It's written in the minutes of the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
@RealCandaceO Moreover, the Democratic Party was against passing the Civil Rights Act. LBJ didn't propose it, JFK did. They passed it merely to honor JFK and gain support for the party, not to benefit those affected by the Act.
@MyDoyers @RealCandaceO That would take me forever to do that, but you can go to https://t.co/kYTTb9PtAW, the GPO, the Library of Congress and many other sites which host past legislation, Congresses, speeches, voting statistics, and historical data. I also tracked voting patterns from 1900-2018.
@SirLochlin @JacobyChrisrt @RealCandaceO #FACTS #FactsOverFeelings
@DomOwensJr @RealCandaceO The parties haven't changed much. Only voting support has.
@J_man63 @RealCandaceO I often ask: Since the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, 1967, &amp; 1968, what has the @DNC done to benefit the A.A. community in the past 50 years, except keep us on welfare and dependant on government assistance? Don't worry, I'll wait. :)
@trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO I'm referring to Candace's claims
@trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO You can start here: https://t.co/kYTTb9PtAW
@trailcatnicole @RealCandaceO The FACT is there is no evidence to support such an empty claim. The way people vote doesn't necessarily equate to a political party's ideals and operation. Science supports voters decide mostly on race a political propaganda, not facts. IJS.
@president_Puff_ @RealCandaceO Lol. Your response shows a lack of knowledge on the actual subject, which reasons why you chose an attack which is futile. Tsk. Foolish mortal. Speak on what you actually know, not what thou speculates. :)
@RealCandaceO What actually changed or "switched" was voting support. Particularly when the Civil Rights Act was ratified. It resulted in the support of 93% of voting A.-Americans, highest support ever. This, in turn, made southern democrats "switch" to Republican support. That's it.
@RealCandaceO I actually studied this argument and examined every Congress, followed the voting flow, read proceedings and bills, read and listened to speeches and studied all American conflicts, particularly the Civil War, just to verify said fallacy. IJS.
@RealCandaceO The Republican party and Democratic party NEVER "switched." That's a fallacy often purported by Democratic supporters. I'm actually a professional historian. The ideals have never changed. The way the parties are run has.
@gnixon88 @wrxmanpaul @guardian There is a difference: We aren't talking about addictions. We're talking about "outing" and it's various interpretations. We have therapists, friends, and family for that kind of work. IJS. All I'm saying is that in the U.S., it would be an issue and I don't see it working here.
@DennisPoole7 @dday_dba @eugenegu @DLoesch @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Is NOT representing the government on Twitter. It's his personal account in his personal capacity. There's actually a separate account for his official office. It's @POTUS. Therefore your position is without merit and the court's ruling was unjust. It won't last.
@eugenegu It's nothing more than judicial activism, IMHO.
@eugenegu The @Scotus may overturn this ruling. It violates a person's right to contract and also violates a person's constitutional right to be left alone. The federal court was out of order for ruling in your favor, IMO, although I love the fact that you stood up for what you believe in

@ButtersPDX @pdxlawgrrrl Two reasons: 1. I grew up in the projects around drug abusers. 2. Rarely did they deal. Heroin addicts don't deal heroin because they use it all. Therefore, if he deals it's more probable he doesn't use. DUH.
@ButtersPDX @pdxlawgrrrl 🤦🏽‍♂️ Let's be clear. The charge holds a UP TO ten years. Please stop exaggerating. Many states INCLUDING WA, offer a Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative. He's a dealer not a user. IJS He could be both but he was charged for distribution not possesion. BIG DIFFERENCE. 👌🏾

@jtfairbank @pdxlawgrrrl That’s false. Heroin is sold by the gram sweetheart, although idk if he’s charged with possession or PWITD. Who’s choice is it to pop pills? Big Pharma? Nope. We’re not talking about a joint dear we’re talking about DOPE!

@jtfairbank @pdxlawgrrrl While ur logic makes sense, that’s not enough 4 me to condone heroin dealing. Especially considering we don’t know his life and the heroin epidemic in the U.S. The homeless and war vet rant seems like a cop out to gain sympathy.

@WestleyBayas This has actually been a trend throughout the United States- gaining the political confidence of women and black voters through propaganda. I.e. Trump and the sex scandals. Sex scandals are typical political propaganda. IJS.
@WestleyBayas Not exactly. I actually looked at the voting map. It wasn't the black vote that turned over, it was the white liberal vote. IJS. The media is using propaganda to gain black folk's confidence. It's a fraud. Numbers don't lie. How is that simple? Blacks only made up 1/3 of voting
https://t.co/xaINBE3Y5G
@WestleyBayas That's what scandals do. 🤷🏽‍♂️
@elizabethforma @GDouglasJones Nah, y'all had the right scandal. IJS 🤷🏽‍♂️
@WestleyBayas Don't fall for the propaganda the media is perpetuating. Selma probably had a large turnout but not enough to decide the election. Black votes counted because whites were split take away the sex scandal and Jones loses. The black vote didn't decide the election the white vote did

@0NoneOfTheAbove Now the question is: Are we doing this to really make a difference, or to water our own gardens? Intent is the discovery to cause and effect
@0NoneOfTheAbove 5/ Charbonnet has NOTHING as of now against her but affiliations, to which we both would be hypocrites to judge a person on those merits.
@0NoneOfTheAbove 4/ Knowing that Cantrell was another vote to the 7-0 Council that you openly opposed and acknowledged as corrupted. But nonetheless,
@0NoneOfTheAbove 3/ Cantrell is just an example: U conceded that you had an emotional bias against Charbonnet on account of her affiliation w/ your old boss
@0NoneOfTheAbove 2/ Certain topics you "follow as they merge," While others, I've witnessed you overlook facts because they oppose your views.
@0NoneOfTheAbove 1/ Negative. You are selective of what you oppose and what you support. I'm not questioning your integrity. I'm pointing out the bias.
@pdxlawgrrrl and how many have you represented?
Cantrell has violated federal, State, and local law but it's "ok" because she has "skin in the game."	😂😂😂 @skooks
People are saying the charges against Cantrell are minor, yet condemned @Desicharbonnet as corrupted with her exemplary reputation. 	🤔🤔🤔

@CLSpuukiiy @voxdotcom What ur saying is a lie. Here let me help you out. Here's an example of how sexual harrassment can be legal: https://t.co/NoM3UTy4Er
@CLSpuukiiy @voxdotcom Actually my study is Constitutional law but go figure.
@CLSpuukiiy @voxdotcom ✋🏾 There's no reference in the Const. that addresses contracts. Contracts rule this land. IJS A treaty and founding docs are contracts
@CLSpuukiiy @voxdotcom That's ur opinion and regardless if it's wrong, a contract stands and they can prevent protest of the N.A. especially when/ money exchanged
@CLSpuukiiy @voxdotcom Under your logic, property taxes, car registration and drivers licenses would also be illegal. They contridict the Constitution also.
@CLSpuukiiy @voxdotcom It creates a sexual slave contract but this form of slavery is legal because it's voluntary. No one can force you to be a slave.
@CLSpuukiiy @voxdotcom Again, u don't understand the law. The Constitution is a contract itself. Sexual domination would be illegal under your logic but it's not.
@CLSpuukiiy @voxdotcom You merely don't understand the law. If a contract prohibits protests the Constitution can't abridge a contract, when a person agrees to it.

@voxdotcom 2/ Contracts are the laws of the land. The Constitution cannot override a contract whereas it's the will of the parties who entered it.

@CJMordock What people don’t know is a portion of bail money is allocated to the judges’ salary fund. More bail money equals more money for judges.
@CJMordock Other states and countries have actually reduced crime by releasing people (ROR) instead of imprisonment. Our bailing system is corrupted.

@0NoneOfTheAbove @OGDavidGNowak Then why didn’t Dave get that endorsement? Clearly JW’s presentation was inferior to his. If they chose their endorsements unbiasedly?
@0NoneOfTheAbove @OGDavidGNowak His ideas are great and deserved that endorsement IMO. 		Honestly I support then.
@0NoneOfTheAbove @OGDavidGNowak @OGDavidGNowak definitely deserved IWO’s endorsement if they are considering candidates equally. His presentation was the best. Conspiracy?
@0NoneOfTheAbove @OGDavidGNowak Instead of promoting unfounded unsupported platforms.
@0NoneOfTheAbove @OGDavidGNowak Exactly. One can not properly discern a proper solution without the current metrics. Which is why I’m doing more research.

@phillippaonline @jdudemill @JayKlos @matthewjdowd @TravyMF @RTMannJr Actually I didn’t. Perhaps it’s better to ask questions than to assume. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Snapshot my usage of the word “uncivil.”
@jdudemill @JayKlos @phillippaonline @matthewjdowd @TravyMF @RTMannJr For the record, I don’t support the POTUS. I don’t support bias either. That’s the difference. 🤷🏽‍♂️
@jdudemill @phillippaonline @JayKlos @ErinTalia1964 @matthewjdowd @TravyMF @RTMannJr All of the above requires supporting evidence and proof of intent. IJS. How will they prove intent???
@jdudemill @JayKlos @ErinTalia1964 @phillippaonline @matthewjdowd @TravyMF @RTMannJr At this point you’re still guessing. They said the same thing about the older allegations. Stand on what you can actually prove. IJS

@JayKlos @jdudemill @phillippaonline @matthewjdowd @TravyMF @RTMannJr That’s my point- people are taking sides before there’s even enough evidence to convict someone under law. People don’t understand civility
