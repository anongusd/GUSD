@AlanDersh Here's a full thread from me, @AlanDersh, responding to this obvious deflection: https://t.co/PcngOTIMpx
RT @SethAbramson: But @AlanDersh, you know as I do—as it's been widely reported—that there will be no release of a "Final Mueller Report" a…
I'm happy that consumers will be able to cancel their pre-orders when they realize they've been scammed, @AlanDersh, but I'm concerned about those who *won't* cancel and will get a thin volume of material—months later than promised—whose content is nothing like it was advertised.
Moreover, @AlanDersh, if I were friends with some of Mueller's subjects, and had advised some of them, and stood to benefit personally from Trump escaping any further legal attention, I wouldn't *dream*—given attorneys' ethical obligations—of participating in a project like this.
And you'll notice I *haven't* dinged you for the obvious stuff, @AlanDersh—like selling for $13 material that—if it existed—would be available for free online, or the fact that you've shown nothing like the expertise on the Russia probe that'd allow you to write a Mueller intro.
What I know you'll do now, @AlanDersh, is either (a) raise a new topic of disagreement to deflect, (b) misquote what I've said, (c) answer a question I didn't ask, or (d) misstate the facts as we all know them to be. I know the bag of tricks you're working from—I practiced, too.
Moreover, @AlanDersh, because 1998 preceded online commerce (or even the internet) being ubiquitous in our culture, we didn't have—at the time—the danger that unscrupulous authors and publishers would falsely market material online that they'd never be able to get their hands on.
You know as I do, @AlanDersh, that the release of even *an excerpt* from Mueller's report will have to be preceded by months of legal wrangling between Trump and Congress over what's privileged—and between Congress and the DOJ over what's counterintel data and should be redacted.
When a man who's repeatedly said that Mueller should hurry up already is marketing a book that falsely claims it is the "Mueller Report" and falsely claims the report will be public by March 26, @AlanDersh, it's a deliberate attempt to influence public perception and expectation.
Properly marketed, @AlanDersh, your book would be called "A Brief Summary of the Mueller Report" with the coauthor listed as Attorney General William Barr—and the date of release on Amazon would be listed as "sometime in 2019" with an asterisk and the word "maybe" attached to it.
And I'm saying, @AlanDersh, that your book uses the DOJ Seal in a way that misrepresents the book and may be illegal, and that the DOJ is falsely listed as a co-author. I'm saying you're selling—at best—a brief (short story-length) summary of the document you say you're selling.
@AlanDersh I have no issue, @AlanDersh—as you know from my tweets—with anyone writing an intro to a public report. I'm saying that you're selling, for money, a product that doesn't and won't exist in the form it's being advertised—and has a fake release date attached to it to entice buyers.
But @AlanDersh, you know as I do—as it's been widely reported—that there will be no release of a "Final Mueller Report" as your book falsely advertises, let alone by March 26 as it falsely advertises. AG Barr will offer a brief summary to Congress—possibly with redacted excerpts. https://t.co/e7AHwhwZgN

I consider Rep. Omar a remarkable person. Saying that I think this can be a learning moment for her and for all of us is not intended as a denigration of her. I'm absolutely thrilled that she's in Congress and I wish her only the very best.
@JediRachel I wouldn't know, as I don't feel any outrage toward her at all. I think she's a remarkable person.
@chai_53 I agree with you. That's why I'm saying that I hope this will be a learning experience for Rep. Omar. That said, I know this is anti-Semitic in large part because I know what they said about Kennedy—and that was 16 years before my birth. Knowing one's history is always critical.
Remember when anti-Catholic bigots across America said, in 1960, that you couldn't elect a Catholic (Kennedy) because his "allegiances" as president would be divided (Pope and America)? Then you understand this situation perfectly fine, and why the same trope now is anti-Semitic.
@GurneyHalleck85 Remember when anti-Catholic bigots across America said, in 1959 and 1960, that you couldn't elect a Catholic (Kennedy) because his "allegiances" as president would be divided (Pope and America)? Then you understand this situation perfectly fine.
@NCWineLady Yeah, nope.
As a straight white guy—albeit someone who, like many Jews, grew up erroneously being told by his peers that he was nonwhite—I've had to learn so much I didn't understand about those with different backgrounds/experiences. I think it's OK to say Rep. Omar has things to learn too.
I'm willing to accept Rep. Omar doesn't appreciate the difference between saying some Jews advocate for strong US support of Israel (not anti-Semitic) and saying some Jews push for "allegiance to a foreign country" (anti-Semitic, and has been a long time). https://t.co/AzogPGBuzy

@PreetBharara Preet, your tweet wasn't factually accurate. That's the problem *I* have with it, at least. https://t.co/VeOCvg7zs0
I've never seen an attorney publicly throw his client under the bus the way Abbe Lowell did Jared Kushner tonight. As an attorney it makes me cringe to see it.
PS/ Here's the worst part: Cohen's public statement was actually that "it'd have to be a role I'd be comfortable with," and that it *could* be a *political* rather than *governmental* role—i.e. personal attorney to the President, the very role he received. https://t.co/UkRBTZigIs
5/ Cohen's claim that being personal lawyer to the President of the United States is "exactly the job I wanted" is so plausible on so many levels, I have no idea why we're looking backward to a time when Cohen has *admitted* he was publicly spouting BS in public and private. /end
4/ As Trump's personal lawyer, Cohen would 1) make more money, 2) never be FOIAed, 3) not be under the public microscope, 4) not be forced to abandon the pseudo-legal strategies he'd been using for years. In the WH, he'd have been exposed as a *bad lawyer*. So yeah—I believe him.
3/ The point of Cohen's testimony was that he was in thrall to Trump until his life fell apart. That meant saying dumb things—under Trump's influence. Why not chalk this up to that—while acknowledging that, to Cohen, "personal lawyer" *would've* been better than a government job?
2/ I and many others—indeed a majority of those polled in the most recent public polling—found Cohen credible in part because a *lawyer* saying (in paraphrase) "I wanted to be the president's personal attorney rather than work in the White House Counsel's Office" makes *sense*.
1/ Words matter—especially to lawyers. @dcexaminer *could've* said "Cohen denied aspiring to work for [the] Trump [administration] during testimony before Congress," but that might not have gotten notice from @PreetBharara—as it would've been too nuanced to make sufficient waves.
On 4 occasions Cohen said, under oath, that "the job he wanted" (and got) was being personal attorney for the President of the United States. @PreetBharara, you've here retweeted a tweet that falsely says "Cohen denied aspiring to work for Trump during testimony before Congress." https://t.co/ORn1tNylgD

NOTE4/ Imagine it's late-ish 2019, and Barr's ready to release his *summary* of Mueller's work to the public—many months after possibly tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans have paid to buy Mueller's "final report." The book's false advertising becomes political propaganda.
NOTE3/ So all one has to do is look at the cover of the "book"—which says that the book contains Mueller's "final report"—to know that not only the *date* of the book's "release" but even its representation of its *contents* is a scam. Amazon has to take action here immediately.
NOTE2/ *All* public reporting says Mueller's report won't be released to the public: that Barr will summarize it and that *at best*—somewhere *down the line*—the public *may* see excerpts of it. So it's not possible for *anyone* to legally—in good faith—market a "Mueller Report."
NOTE/ This fraudulent book is even worse than I've already said above—as Attorney General Barr has made it very clear that what would be released to Congress (and thus to the public) *if anything* at some *distant future date* is *not* the Mueller Report but Barr's summary of it.

7/ To @washingtonpost I'd say, this is why America increasingly despises the media. To @AlanDersh I'd say, this is why America already hates lawyers.		The very existence of this scam "product" misinforms the public about the timing and accessibility of the report. It's sickening.
6/ @washingtonpost also has an edition of the "Mueller Report" due for "release" on March 26, which is also, and for the same reasons, a scam. I'm amazed that any journalist would be involved in something like this. We have no idea when the report will come or if it'll be public.
5/ Were I @DOJ—and if a publisher and @AlanDersh were representing to the public that I would be releasing to the public *by March 26* a document that I in fact have not at all decided whether I will release—I would be contacting Amazon to have this false advertising eliminated.
4/ This is an improper use of the Department of Justice seal, the name of the Department of Justice as an "author" of the text—again, a fanciful text that doesn't exist—and should be treated as domestic disinformation perpetrated by one of Trump's legal advisers. It's a scandal.
3/ By putting a date certain (March 26) on the book—a fake date that's preposterous in no small part because the content of the Report will be litigated for months before it reaches the public (if it ever does)—Trumpworld is also trying to build public impatience for the Report.
2/ This is Team Trump's first assault on the Mueller Report, which is to have an ally—someone who advised Trump, and has socialized with him and friends of his (e.g. Epstein)—smear the report with an "introduction" to it presumably written *now*, before the report even comes out.
1/ Understand that to the extent this book seeks to get Amazon users' cash for a product that may never exist—and *certainly* won't be available within *months* of when it advertises—this project to discredit Mueller being spearheaded by someone who has advised Trump, @AlanDersh.
Is this a joke? A fraud? It falsely lists the Mueller Report as being available to the public on March 26, and falsely represents that we know now—which we don't—whether any of the report will be public. I'm surprised Amazon is allowing this obvious scam. https://t.co/07R5AgqYLY https://t.co/c0tEBs3aaB

@JoshuaMatz8 See my thread (on my feed) responding in more depth, but I'm saying there's no "magical, fantastical thinking on the Left about impeachment"—the overwhelming view is that even if it *should* happen, it won't because of the Senate's composition. I never see optimism on this front.
@BrandonMusicKy @JoshuaMatz8 Sorry, but the Constitution enumerates what demands impeachment. Saying impeachment is a political *process* is *not* the same as saying the only *standard* that exists for impeachment is "political." I'm sorry if the writing of anyone involved in this thread made you think that.
(PS5) As an attorney, I feel it damages the rule of law if impeachment is warranted but not pursued—but that's not saying (as in the Clinton case) statecraft can't reasonably militate for a different outcome. But I'd still say—even in the Clinton case—that rule of law is damaged.
(PS4) I read and RT @tribelaw and @JRubinBlogger, so my critique here is merely a critique of this argument, @JoshuaMatz8, not some broader attack. I think the 40% you describe deserve credit for tracking the evidence and *still* wanting more investigation to precede impeachment.
(PS3) I agree it is facile to conflate "Democrats" and the "Left," and I should not have used those shorthands. But if "40%" of likely American voters say public evidence supports impeachment, that pretty much means most Democrats (which includes most progressives) do support it.
(PS2) My view: if warranted by law, a president should, as a starting matter, be impeached—as only that standard being used as a foundation ensures proper conduct by presidents. That doesn't mean statecraft can't present a counterargument if a president has merely lied about sex.
(PS) I didn't "assert that pragmatism and statecraft have no role to play." Were the allegation that a president lied about sex—cf. Clinton—the role pragmatism and statecraft *do* play might argue against impeachment. Here, we have *dire* national security and rule-of-law issues.
(3 of 3) Procedurally impeachment is a political process—of course. By anyone who believes in the rule of law and sees Emoluments, Oath of Office, Abuse of Power, Bribery, Obstruction and other high crime/misdemeanor offenses and opposes impeachment *is* damaging our rule of law.
(2 of 3) If 40% of the country were natively—not in response to pollsters—demanding impeachment we'd see nationwide rallies for impeachment and Congresspeople flooded with calls for impeachment. We don't. As for impeachment being political, you're both right and wrong about that.
(1 of 3) But @JoshuaMatz8, in fact 40% of the country is *not* "demanding" impeachment. Pollsters reach out to voters and ask them if they think the facts made public thus far warrant impeachment, which (as a matter of law) they do. So 40% answering "yes" when asked is admirable. https://t.co/xlZQsNdX76

(9) Mueller therefore has *just* initiated a prosecution he credibly believes will lead to collusion.	(10) Media statements that Cohen "threw cold water" on collusion are therefore 180 degrees from the truth.	(Conclusion) Media statements that probe is almost over are also wrong.
(6) If Cohen by *chance* overheard one Trump-Stone call about WikiLeaks, Mueller must believe many such calls actually happened.	(7) Mueller's charging of Stone gives him a chance to squeeze Stone to talk.	(8) If Stone admits to being Trump-WikiLeaks intermediary, it's collusion.
MEDIA, please make these connections:		(1) Cohen met Mueller's team—7 times—for many hours.	(2) Based on cooperation deal, Mueller believes Cohen now.	(3) Cohen says Stone was Trump-WikiLeaks intermediary.	(4) Mueller is charging Stone with crimes.	(5) Russia probe far from over.
10/ I don't know if Cohen was in Prague. My book focuses on what he did in *Italy* two months earlier. But I do know that public debate over what's going on is shaped by people like @KenDilanianNBC, who are falsely smearing a former MI6 Russia desk chief—and doing so willy-nilly.
9/ What's worse is that Ken says the "president and his allies" will seize on "Cohen's answer," but he knows full well they won't—they'll seize on *his reporting and analysis* instead. So it's *Ken* whose bad analysis the president and his allies will now use as political fodder.
8/ How is that possible? What if Cohen's phone *was* in Prague? I'm not saying one way or another that it was, I'm saying the paragraph below, given what I've just explained, is *bad reporting* that *falsely attacks Steele's credibility* and *perhaps* falsely attacks the dossier: https://t.co/q8Knp9Mg5s
7/ Moreover, in that scenario—which arguably is the *most plausible scenario*, given that Russians discussing Cohen-in-Prague would've worked from the same phone records U.S. intel did—not only is Steele's sourcing strong but Cohen's testimony *doesn't refute its claims, either*.
6/ Indeed, let's say Steele *correctly* compiled his intel—i.e., the Russians really *did* say Cohen was in Prague, and did so based on phone records that *did* suggest that, but *not* based on any eyewitness claims. That would suggest Steele's sourcing was *good* but *mistaken*.
5/ Part of the purpose of this feed is to show how media analysts who don't know the stories they're reporting on well—or write inexactly—change public perception dangerously. To be clear, *nothing* Cohen wrote discredits Steele *at all* and his dossier was *always* "raw intel."
4/ So to correct @KenDilanianNBC, what Cohen "threw cold water on" was statements by Russians about their belief Cohen was in Prague—which may have been a) them lying in the first instance, b) them simply being mistaken, c) them working from phone records many intel agencies saw.
3/ Those *Russians* may have been lying, or working from—as now reported elsewhere—the "Cohen in Prague" evidence being phone records rather than eyewitness evidence. So Steele didn't allege anything himself, and *even his raw intel* might be right. The *Russians* might be wrong.
2/ As with all bad reporting, it doesn't stop there: @KenDilanianNBC then pole-vaults himself into more bad reporting—writing that "Cohen poured water on the Russia collusion narrative." Fact check: Steele, McClatchy, and others reported *Russians* as saying Cohen was in Prague.
1/ I keep trying to explain to people how bad reporting leads to bad news. Look at Dilanian's statement; even though Steele made no allegations whatsoever *himself* and told *everyone* his dossier was "raw intel" that was likely partly wrong, Ken is *discrediting Steele falsely*.
So, @KenDilanianNBC with a false statement: "Cohen testified he'd never been to Prague or met with Russians in Europe—refuting a key allegation by a former British intel officer whose dossier sketched out a Trump-Russian conspiracy." Steele had "raw intel" and made 0 allegations.
@Navillus_3 that's right—we live in a world now in which you spend months researching a book that has 2,000 citations and when you're done some idiot on the internet who didn't read the book says "anything you say is just confirmation bias of the conclusions in a book I didn't read"		grow up
4/ There's no "impeachment fixation" on the Left. There's an *investigation fixation* that arises from *facts*. And finally, there's a constitutional view of impeachment that's admirable: if it's warranted, you do it—if not, not. That's honorable—"let's just focus on 2020" isn't.
3/ What @JoshuaMatz8 / @JRubinBlogger are doing is playing into a right-wing fantasy: Dems are an unrealistic pack of fools whose belief in rule of law is variable. The truth? Dems are almost preternaturally united in saying investigate first, impeach second—if the data warrants.
2/ In fact, as one of the highest-traffic Trump-Russia feeds out there, I can tell @JoshuaMatz8 and others that I far more often hear Democrats say "we need to impeach him but can't because of the Senate, so let's focus on 2020" than I hear any drumbeat for immediate impeachment.
1/ The Democratic line on impeachment (both in DC and out of DC) is that we need a full, fair, and free investigation of what Trump has done—,and then, if warranted, impeachment proceedings. The idea that we'd find impeachable offenses and *not* impeach abrogates the rule of law.
I'm confused. After we learned that the Bush Administration lied about WMDs, progressives loudly demanded impeachment. With Trump, Democrats mention it *far* less—though the evidence for it is *far* greater. I mention it in maybe one of every 400 tweets. Where is this "fixation"? https://t.co/oK5vxcdQqQ

6/ And the result of there being no legal grounding whatsoever for the current collusion debate—because of decisions made by Trump and media—is that someone like Cohen can testify truthfully that he saw no evidence of collusion while using the term in an *entirely incorrect way*.
5/ And Obstruction is *also* part of it. So what I see are news analysts discussing collusion without actually having discussed or even decided what crime or crimes the collusive acts would constitute. This leaves the whole collusion debate without any legal grounding whatsoever.
4/ Trump collusion isn't a Conspiracy to Commit Computer Crimes case whose "act in furtherance" precedes the hacking—it's a Bribery/Aiding and Abetting Defrauding of the US (During/After the Fact) case in which Trump's promises on sanctions induce behavior as he enriches himself.
3/ When I wrote on Twitter that Cohen provided a huge stock of information on collusion, it therefore seemed absurd to anyone who'd adopted Trump's and the media's definition of the term—and made total sense to anyone who's actually been analyzing collusion for the last 2+ years.
2/ Post-hearing, media reported that Cohen had observed no collusion, never noting that the definition it was using was Trump's—and not the definition any of Trump's critics have *ever* used. That's why there's disagreement on how the Cohen hearing affects the collusion argument.
1/ Before Congress, Cohen quite naturally did what you'd expect, which is define collusion the way it commonly is in the media—that is, consistent with Trump's definition of it, which conveniently holds that collusion *only* occurred if Trump had foreknowledge of Russian hacking.
The Trump-Russia collusion Trump's critics decry has always been Trump's participation in a tower-for-sanctions quid pro quo. Cohen yesterday confirmed the tower part 100%, and Congress wasn't allowed to ask about his minor participation in the sanctions—Ukraine peace deal—piece.

Does anyone have a supercut of all the times Donald Trump said, we now know *falsely*, that he was under audit during the 2016 presidential campaign?
@ChrisCuomo 3/ I *really* dislike watching TV analysts who know less than me, and that feeling is particularly strong when they're fulltime journalists and I'm not *and* we watched the same TV footage of Congressional testimony. There's no excuse for it whatsoever. Very frustrating.
2/ Isikoff falsely told the viewers of @ChrisCuomo that "Mueller told Cummings" Cohen could talk about "anything he wanted" on Russia, and that that was proof Mueller was done on Russia. Wow. No. Cummings said *Cohen's opening* opened the door to some *limited* queries on Russia.
1/ Michael Isikoff says we have "no evidence" the campaign contribution Trump received involving Stormy Daniels was "about the election." Does Michael know that days before today happened? Did he *not* hear the *audiotape* of the Trump-Cohen conversation from *many months ago*?
There are *so* many great analysts on television now, so I'm sad that Michael Isikoff is getting the play he is. I don't know if his research is stale or what, but I have not heard a single statement from him about Trump's legal liability that I couldn't refute *instantaneously*.

NOTE/ A full discussion of the lies Cohen told about Italy—which strongly suggest he was engaged in clandestine activity for Trump in the days immediately preceding the 2016 RNC—can be found in PROOF OF COLLUSION. And PROOF OF COLLUSION can be found here: https://t.co/ZJsnHcVwGi
PS5/ That is, there are many people Cohen could've met in Italy who could've assisted Mr. Trump with Trump Tower Moscow and explain Cohen's fake alibi *and* his other lies told about the vacation *and* him "going on vacation" during the 10 days pre-RNC that Trump needed him most.
PS4/ The pre-RNC Cohen-Sater chat on traveling abroad to meet Russians focused on meeting Kremlin agents who could help Trump get Trump Tower Moscow. Cohen declined to go to Moscow and went to Italy instead. It's entirely possible any Russian he met there was not a Kremlin agent.
PS3/ Here's what I said on Cohen and Prague six months ago: "I'm not convinced Cohen was in Prague." I then said we could "bank on" Cohen meeting with at least one Kremlin agent in Italy. I have no worries giving that a *slight* amendment (see next tweet). https://t.co/2F5RqbRIXz
Cohen—Trump's lawyer—asked Trump for *any evidence* his tax returns were under audit. Trump never provided him any proof. But he *did* tell Cohen he didn't want "experts" looking at his returns as he might *then* "end up in an audit." Cohen says, "I presume he's not under audit."
NOTE: *Anyone with a book deal* will know, too, that—*universally*—the value of a book is seen as going *down* the more the information one has is in the public sphere. Cohen is *destroying* the value of his "book" by testifying in public. Anyone in the literary world knows this. https://t.co/r3ee2daZ1K

PS2/ What readers of this feed will know is that I *have* been very interested in the Steele dossier—which I've estimated at somewhere around 70% accurate (because much of it is "raw intel," as Steele himself said from the outset). If Cohen-in-Prague is part of the 30%, so be it.
PS/ (Proof of Collusion takes no view on Cohen and Prague. The book focuses instead on Cohen's pre-RNC trip to Italy (in 2016) and the *fact* that he lied about where he was (and with whom) during that trip, which is suspicious. That's all. I've never been obsessed with Prague.)
10/ Anyone asked about Cohen's testimony has to decide if they think Cohen is telling the truth now or not. I'd be suspicious of any person whose analysis of Cohen's testimony depends on thinking he told the truth in some answers and lied in other answers—watch out for that. /end
9/ I'll make an exception to that statement: Cohen *has* previously been to Prague—and told Corn that—but in answering the question today focused on whether he went there *during the campaign*. Unlike Trump supporters I'm consistently saying I think Cohen's telling the truth now.
8/ I'd also note the obvious irony of those who've spent months saying that not a word Cohen says can be believed now saying that we can *definitely* believe him on Prague. Note the difference in what *I'm* saying—I'm *consistently* saying that Cohen is *now* telling the truth.
7/ My concern about Cohen's testimony on Prague is zero—and that's because Trump-Russia collusion in no way hinges on it, the claim Cohen was there comes from raw intel, and nothing that's come out makes impossible that Cohen's cell phone—in other hands—was in Prague in mid-2016.
6/ I'd also say, as a former criminal defense lawyer—and current attorney and member of the NHBA and Federal Bar for the District of New Hampshire—that when you are *losing* a case you focus on *one* fact in dispute. And notice that that's exactly what Trump supporters are doing.
5/ So journalists, lawyers and news analysts must be perspicacious enough to always discuss the Steele dossier as raw intel; to acknowledge that a Steele source could *honestly* say what they were told or believed and be *wrong*; and that Cohen and McClatchy *aren't* in conflict.
4/ The question is whether Cohen (or McClatchy) disagree with the Steele Dossier, which is a thornier issue. It's possible that the same Russian who—potentially—*legitimately* thought Cohen was in Prague said as much to Steele's source. Remember that the Dossier was *raw intel*.
3/ We're dealing with the most dire, complex federal criminal investigation of our lifetimes. Any journalist, attorney or news analyst who can't be discerning enough about facts, statements, and the law to see that Cohen and McClatchy aren't necessarily in conflict has a problem.
2/ But neither @brianstelter nor anyone else could responsibly say that either McClatchy is correct or Cohen is; it's entirely possible that Cohen has never been to Prague—except in '01, as he told WSJ—and that McClatchy is correct about *both* the phone and surveillance records.
1/ McClatchy also cited *surveillance* info in which a Russian "remarked that Cohen was in Prague." As to *that*, it's *entirely possible a Russian said this* (as McClatchy DC reported) and was either (1) wrong, or (2) being misleading because s/he knew they were being overheard.
EITHER		(1) McClatchy DC is correct (as it has often been in its Trump-Russia reporting) and Cohen is lying;		OR		(2) people are misreading the McClatchy DC report, which only intimates that Cohen's *phone* was in Prague on the given date (thus linking up with the Steele Dossier) https://t.co/sPbvJN2aeK
Americans now inhabit different reality streams—with different pasts, presents, futures, and information sources. *Don't* be surprised that some saw Cohen's *damning* testimony as aiding Trump—in the eyes of some, there's no evidence any witness could offer that would harm Trump.
I tweeted a week ago that the odds were "50/50" that Stone would be "in jail in four weeks."		Having violated his gag order in just 6 days, Stone is now on track for that. https://t.co/2XvPlE6DJ4
2/ A man out to destroy Trump at all costs would've at least allowed for the *possibility* that a man like Trump who's confessed to multiple sexual assaults *could* assault a woman. But Cohen defended Trump on this score and *passionately* so. That's an indication of reliability.
1/ This said, I *agree* with @rgoodlaw that there are indicia of reliability in *many* things Cohen said. (And I'm not including any of the statements he was able to corroborate with documentary evidence.) For instance, he was adamant that Trump would never *ever* strike Melania.
If you think there was no evidence of collusion in this hearing, you didn't watch it or don't understand the law, evidence, or anything about the Trump-Russia probe. Collusion investigators would've benefitted *greatly* from this hearing—if they didn't already have the evidence.

Journalists must be very clear on this point: however Cohen defines "collusion," there is *no question* that Cohen is presenting *evidence* of Trump's pre-election collusion with Russia to Congress. As always, the only question is if the standard of proof Congress selects is met.

Over and over and over again, what we will see today is that the Republicans' terror at giving Michael Cohen a chance to speak to the American people will cause them to do everything they can to try to shut him down and stop this public hearing from happening. It's *disgraceful*.
50/ "...I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today. Thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer the Committee's questions." /end
49/ "I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me...{cont.}
48/ "I hope this committee and all members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will make it clear: As a nation, we should not tolerate attempts to intimidate witnesses before Congress and attacks on family are out of bounds and not acceptable."
47/ "Only someone burying his head in the sand would not recognize [Trump's tweets] for what they are: encouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family. I never imagined that he would engage in vicious, false attacks on my family—and unleash his TV lawyer to do the same."
46/ "[Mr. Trump has tried] to intimidate me from appearing before this panel. Mr. Trump called me a 'rat' for choosing to tell the truth—much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government."
45/ "To our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed it most. For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man."
44/ "...nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without his knowledge and approval. So, I concluded that Don was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad's desk that day."
43/ "Mr. Trump frequently told me...Don had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don would never set up any meeting of any significance alone—and certainly not without checking with his father...{cont.}
42/ "...Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: 'The meeting is all set.' I remember Mr. Trump saying, 'Okay, good. Let me know.'...[later] I concluded Don was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting."
41/ "I remember being in the room with Mr. Trump—probably in early June 2016—when something peculiar happened. Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father's desk—which in itself was unusual. People didn't just walk behind his desk to talk to him. I recalled...{cont.}
40/ "Mr. Trump finished the conversation [about his deferments from the Vietnam draft] with the following comment. 'You think I'm stupid? I wasn't going to Vietnam.'"
39/ "He tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. He claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer specific questions."
38/ "When telling me in 2008 that he was cutting employees' salaries in half—including mine—Mr. Trump showed me what he claimed was a $10 million IRS tax refund, and said that he couldn't believe how stupid the government was for giving 'someone like him' that much money back."
37/ "The sad fact is that I never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better. In fact, he did the opposite."
36/ "The irony wasn't lost on me at the time [that Mr. Trump asked me to threaten his alma maters] that he in 2011 had strongly criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades. He'd declared, 'Let him show his records' after calling President Obama 'a terrible student.'"
35/ "When I say [Mr. Trump is a] 'conman,' I'm talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores."
34/ "In February 2017...I'm visiting President Trump in the Oval Office...[and he says to me], 'Don't worry, Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were Fed-Exed from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system.'"
33/ "The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. You can find the details of that scheme, directed by Mr. Trump, in the pleadings in the U.S. District Court for SDNY."
32/ "This $35,000 check [I am providing to Congress] was one of eleven check installments that was paid throughout the year—while Mr. Trump was President."
31/ "I'm providing a copy of a 35K check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017...pursuant to the cover-up...to 'reimburse' me—the word used by Mr. Trump's TV lawyer—for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf."
30/ "Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too."
29/ "I'm giving the Committee a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms. Clifford's lawyer during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms. Clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony."
28/ "Mr. Trump is a conman. He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly—and she did not deserve that."
27/ "Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I advised Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it."
26/ "...which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself. Please see Exhibit 3B to my testimony."
25/ "He directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned. The objective was to ensure that his portrait would go for the highest price of any portrait. It was purchased by the fake bidder for 60K. He directed the Trump Foundation...{cont.}
24/ "Mr. Trump is a cheat.... It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes."
23/ "While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, Mr. Trump commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid."
22/ "Mr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries 'shitholes.'	In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a 'shithole.'"
21/ "...Stone told Mr. Trump he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Assange told Stone that—within a couple days—there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Clinton's campaign. Mr. Trump responded...to the effect of, 'wouldn't that be great.'"
20/ "Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails. In July 2016—days before the Democratic convention—I was in Mr. Trump's office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone...{cont.}
19/ "Lying for Mr. Trump was normalized, and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either. A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked DNC emails ahead of time. The answer is yes."
18/ "I knew early on in my work for Mr. Trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests. I am ashamed to say that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector, I considered it trivial. As the President, I consider it significant and dangerous."
17/ "He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign—for him—was always a marketing opportunity."
16/ "He ran for office to make his brand great—not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation—only to market himself and build his wealth and power. He would often say, this campaign...[will] be the 'greatest infomercial in political history.'"
15/ "Over time, I saw Mr. Trump's true character revealed. He is an enigma....He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal."
14/ "Being around Mr. Trump was intoxicating. When you were in his presence, you felt like you were involved in something greater....I wound up touting the Trump narrative for over a decade. That was my job. Always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life."
13/ "I have come here to apologize to my family, to the government, and to the American people. Accordingly, let me now tell you about Mr. Trump."
12/ "It is...painful to admit that many times I ignored my conscience and acted loyal to a man when I should not have. Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong."
11/ "For the record: 'Individual #1' is President Donald J. Trump."
10/ "So I lied about [the Moscow project], too—because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie."
9/ "Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied...because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project."
8/ "You need to know that Mr. Trump's personal lawyers reviewed and edited my [false] statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it."
7/ "In his way, Mr. Trump was telling me to lie. There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me, 'How's it going in Russia?'—referring to the Moscow Tower project."
6/ "In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, Mr. Trump would look me in the eye and tell	me there's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing."
5/ "I'm here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump. I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false—our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign."
4/ "Donald Trump was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails."
3/ "I am ashamed of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him. I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts...I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat."
2/ "I regret the day I said yes to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way. I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the SDNY. I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty."
1/ "I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful."

If I were Senator John Cornyn, or a member of the far right of the Republican Party, I'd see the internet's reaction to one of my leaders quoting Mussolini and immediately react as they do in the well-known "Mitchell and Webb" sketch: "Are we the baddies?" https://t.co/p5GsjiaT0p
Indeed the president himself has quoted Mussolini approvingly, so when Democrats saw Sen. Cornyn doing the same thing, they of course—knowing that *nothing* the right-wing Mussolini said applies to Democrats—assumed that Cornyn was merely emulating the right-wing's "god emperor."
It's been so amazing watching right-wing Twitter try to drag criticism of John Cornyn's quoting of Mussolini as an implausible reading of GOP values when right-wing Twitter has made a *godhead* of a man who openly idolizes dictators around the world, from Putin to Kim to Duterte.

10/ You want the truth about how America daily handles Obstruction, Witness Tampering, and Conspiracy cases, @CNN and @MSNBC? Bring @ScottHech on-air and you will hear about the justice system the *other* 99% of us live under, not some fantasyland for rich white-collar criminals.
9/ For this reason, when media institutions choose to exclude those who represent the poor in court from their panels, they're making a conscious decision to let their on-air analyses be both politically influenced and *systematically* favorable to the rich, famous, and powerful.
8/ One reason I suspect you don't often see public defenders on television or radio is that as a class we are tempermentally prone to prick up our ears the very second our colleagues on the other side begin treating the wealthy and powerful better than they ever have our clients.
7/ May every poor black/brown defendant in America get the sort of wildly charitable legal analysis applied to their cases that former prosecutors on TV/radio are now giving to one of the richest and most powerful men in the world. Maybe we should revisit some closed cases, too.
6/ Yet some incredibly talented former federal prosecutors are trying to give us the impression that Cohen's testimony comes with no indicia of reliability contextually or based on Cohen's legal liability unless and until he gives us a series of smoking guns. It's *preposterous*.
5/ Were I prosecuting cases, it'd be a dream come true to have a witness like Cohen who's spent so many *scores of hours* speaking to federal prosecutors that jurors and the public can be absolutely sure that he's *terrified* of changing his story even *one iota* before Congress.
4/ In my many years of experience trying criminal cases, the average witness in a criminal case was someone who themselves had some kind of criminal record and at least one basis to question their credibility. What sort of system do folks think we have? All this is standard fare.
3/ Moreover, we have years of public behavior by the individual Cohen will be testifying about that themselves act as partial corroboration for the sort of character Cohen will be giving Trump in his Congressional testimony. I've no idea where all this trepidation is coming from.
2/ Corroboration is *always* critical in criminal cases, not just when a witness has credibility issues (as so many witnesses in your typical criminal case do). But Cohen has *far* more pressing legal reasons to be straight with Congress than almost any witness you could imagine.
1/ I don't rightly know why both journalistic and legal professionals seem to have a great deal invested in *de*-normalizing things we do in situations involving poor defendants *every day in America* the moment a rich, powerful man is the defendant, but that's what's happening.
Every day in U.S. courts, state and federal prosecutors put convicts on the stand to help them prove cases because our justice system is set up to ensure they'll be honest an overwhelming percentage of the time. Only when Trump is involved do we talk as we are now—it's maddening. https://t.co/WLnNARxOGX

(NOTE) The main takeaway here is this: the reason Trump decries "fake news" is because research into his 2016 campaign (and his presidency thereafter) is revealing that in fact Trump is the *High Cleric of Fake News*, working fervently with radicals to destroy "truth" in America.
@riskfreereturns Look at the date on the Wohl tweet—it's 2017. I'm not claiming he was right about the "50th anniversary" bit, I'm only interested in the date of his tweet.
(SOURCE2) Wohl doesn't work for Israeli intel, of course—that's crazy. What I'm *wondering*, instead, is whether the same Israeli consultants who colluded with the Trump campaign pre-election also tried to offer advice to the Trump campaign-connected Wohl. https://t.co/9m5BNYTRzn

(2 of 2) Wohl was likely lying to Cass (Mueller's "accuser") when he told her he was connected to Israeli intel, but dammit if it isn't odd that Israeli intel-linked firms have been helping Trump with domestic disinfo since 2016 and now there's this link. https://t.co/kIr81qP7Yl

@MajikaZulJin "Access journalism," "both-sidesism," and poorly prepared pundits are all symptoms of a focus on the three things I mentioned, I think.

Trump supporters on social media should spend all day today convincing us that they'd have *no problem at all* with *any* Democratic president, past or future, conspiring with a witness before Congress to have that witness lie. It's important to go on record as *not* a hypocrite.
The job of journalists right now is to do journalism by explaining how the many facets of our criminal justice system will be implicitly deployed tomorrow to ensure Cohen tells the truth, as the system now has him cornered. What *no one* should focus on is White House propaganda.
@joeboo22 I think Cohen's opening remarks could be quite significant.
NOTE: Should Cohen tell ANY lies before Congress in his testimony this week, he'll almost certainly face new federal felony charges—as he's spent SO many hours talking to the feds, they'll know the moment he changes his story. So yes, in fact, there's EVERY reason to believe him.
PASS IT ON: former Trump attorney Michael Cohen's public testimony on Wednesday (2/27) before the House Oversight Committee begins at *10AM EST*.
1/ This article structure wouldn't even make sense if the White House line was something any journalist could credit. In fact, Trump wants America to think he's known Cohen for 18 years and was shocked (*shocked*, I say!) to learn a few months ago that Cohen was capable of lying.
What an oddly structured article! It begins by telling you how the White House is preparing for and reacting to things it hasn't yet told you about. Then it tells you about them. Almost like it was more important for readers to hear the White House line. https://t.co/xOXaInrnrU

7/ FWIW, the Republicans I know think of themselves as pro-freedom—so when I critique the GOP as anti-freedom I mean literally the party platform, not the bulk of the party's voters. I continue to see the *party* as a marketing strategy attached to an annual political convention.
6/ The focus of this feed continues to be the Russia scandal (and I've said that I take no sides in the Democratic primary). But when a top GOP senator is using fascist rhetoric as a political football, I think that ties in quite closely to what Trump has done to our discourse.
5/ I think the two-party system is healthy; it's *good* for us to argue about marginal tax rates, preferred practices for good governance, and the complexities of foreign policy. But undergirding these debates should be some honesty about what enslaves humans and what frees them.
4/ I don't know how or when it happened, but I think another very successful GOP marketing pitch has been to tell Americans—even struggling Americans—that getting an affordable education, affordable healthcare, and a decent job is *an imposition on your freedom*. That just crazy.
3/ When FDR—and other great leaders of that ilk—imagined universal healthcare, universal education, and a livable wage for all Americans, it wasn't about *limiting* freedom but *expanding* it: if you're healthy, educated, and have a home, you can *live your best and freest life*.
2/ As a matter of marketing, what the GOP has been successful at doing—I admit—is selling a moralistic, authoritarian, regressive government as "pro-freedom." Republicans' nihilistic tax policy—which allows a handful of people to be multibillionaires—is what passes for "freedom."
1/ It's not partisan or hotheaded to observe that—across the board—Republicans favor limiting individual liberty. Whether it's the war on drugs, euthanasia, school prayer, the right to choose, basic law enforcement strategies, or anything else, the GOP opposes individual freedom.
Cornyn now says this summarizes the Democratic platform. In fact, it's the GOP that wants draconian law enforcement, state control of women's emergency healthcare, criminalization of drugs less harmful than alcohol, state-sponsored prayer and public accommodations discrimination. https://t.co/0WDZKsNRq2

2/ Imagine I mapped out for you the following investigative strategy		Interview Hours with Kushner: 6.5	Interview Hours with Bannon: 24 to 96		then told you the public evidence has Kushner engaged in *far* more malfeasance than Bannon. Wouldn't you think Kushner is a key suspect?
1/ What makes this NYT revelation startling is Bannon and Kushner were at *almost all the same suspicious meetings*—and where they weren't both at a suspicious meeting it was usually because *Kushner* was there alone (or with Flynn). So this makes Kushner seem like a key suspect.

@EssayWells Do not tempt me
Were I willing to lower myself to the level of discourse employed by right-wing social media users and *also* insist publicly on my belief in "expertise"—an idea right-wingers once not only believed in but venerated—I'd be writing "fuck you I'm a lawyer" on Twitter 100 times/day.
We rightly say that certain categories of people—for instance, women—have a much harder time than others getting treated with respect on social media, including when speaking on an area of expertise. What we should add is that the Right no longer believes in "expertise" at *all*.
To be an attorney and former criminal investigator who analyzes criminal cases on social media is to receive scores of insane messages daily from right-wingers with no legal education, knowledge, or experience condescendingly telling you how to interpret a criminal investigation.
2/ Imagine that Barr agrees, for instance, to send all the investigative info on Trump to Congress for possible impeachment proceedings—but *blacks out all other names* in the same way the Manafort filing blacked out all non-Manafort/non-Gates/non-Kilimnik names. See the problem?
1/ The way we're discussing how to prove a crime/impeachment is farcical. The idea Barr could put Trump above the law by refusing to release any info on him because he can't be indicted as POTUS is insane. The same is true for not releasing supporting info involving other people.
This is wrong in so many ways. I'll give you the simplest example: say that the case for impeachment against Donald Trump involves the description of bad acts (but not criminal acts) by *people other than Trump*, which it *most certainly does*. How could DOJ withhold *that* info? https://t.co/1MWM1mC54m

While normally we wouldn't think DOJ could/should consider context, we've heard from Neal Katyal and others that DOJ regulations are intended to promote confidence in the public administration of justice. With that in mind, DOJ *must* consider how context affects its stated goal.
My point: folks wrongly think the only charge DOJ can bring against Don Jr., Prince, and others is Conspiracy, so if Mueller has 70% proof of that crime, not 90%, we can't hear *anything* about these people. That's false. Second, DOJ needs to consider the context *Trump* created.
1) Don Jr. and Prince (&amp;c) can be charged with lying to Congress—enabling DOJ to lay out the facts undergirding their lies;	2) We're in a political sphere: Trump can't accuse HRC of treason daily without evidence as his DOJ daintily avoids telling us the evidence it has on Trump. https://t.co/ZpMaKWAwNT

@adamctierney I can answer that: all elections are turnout elections now, and Democrats have never understood that the reason that they're so bad at turnout is that they always falsely think they're going to peel off a layer of Republicans.		Wake up! This criminal has 90% support from the GOP.
When I hear Democratic candidates speak of "bipartisanship," I think about how in *all prior general elections* I found such language important and admirable. But when I hear it now all I can think to say is, what the f*ck are you talking about? How can you lead if you're asleep?
A candidate needs to stand up and unambiguously tell America that while we're stronger under a two-party system, at present we have only one party capable of governing or even *eligible* to govern, as the other has experienced a moral collapse that excludes it from civil society.
It's unbelievable that we're going to have a massive Democratic field for the 2020 primaries, and not one candidate will say outright what I believe a majority of Democratic voters are thinking: the Republican party is no longer a viable discourse partner in our two-party system.
Didn't the party that tried to rig and steal elections by "ratfucking" Democrats in the Watergate era, and which staged a riot in Miami in 2000 to stop the counting of legal ballots, owe it to America—or sheer decency—to take the lead against Russia today? https://t.co/BImo9qQpgJ
RT @SethAbramson: The GOP has a long history of richly rewarding and even lionizing party hacks who commit crimes or other foul deeds—from…
8/ When the only "governing" philosophy of a political party is that it hates the government it wants to control, and wants to reverse the progress of the democratic experiment of which it's a part, why should we be surprised when it makes a malignant narcissist into its godhead?
7/ 70% of the GOP would lionize Roger Stone in perpetuity if it discovered that he'd secretly worked with Russia to elect Trump, and had thereafter found some sleazy way to get away with it, by pardon or otherwise. And Stone knows it. And Stone is excitedly waiting for sainthood.
6/ The GOP is now the party of "owning the libs." It doesn't care about immigration; it knows a wall won't reduce illegal immigration. As long as it seats judges who set us back 100 years and finds ways to prove that government doesn't work, it's doing *just* what it wants to do.
5/ I guess what I'm saying is, what if Trump—despite not believing in any Republican "principles" or being anything but the clear anathema of any "moral majority"—is in fact the natural conclusion of the devolution of GOP politics, as in fact the principles never really mattered?
4/ Dick Cheney is a hero for orchestrating a ruinous and false conflict that cost thousands of lives. Did the GOP care that Libby was outing agents in our clandestine services? "Owning the libs" has *always* been—my whole life—more important to the GOP than ethics or governance.
3/ We may sometimes think of Trump as a sort of exception in the history of the GOP, but how often does a Republican do something awful and quickly wind up a "hero" of the Republican base? When has the party clearly tossed out its scoundrels? That'd be counter to its philosophy.
2/ So when the GOP finds a criminal who knows how to win, backing that horse fervently offers the dual benefit of increasing Americans' hopelessness that government can ever be honest or work while also ensuring that those atop government aren't honest and do only nefarious work.
1/ The benefit of being in a party that doesn't want or need government to work, because it fundamentally doesn't believe in government and benefits enormously when government fails, is that all you need is to jam the machine's gears so it breaks. You don't have to *do* anything.
The GOP has a long history of richly rewarding and even lionizing party hacks who commit crimes or other foul deeds—from Oliver North to Gordon Liddy to Katherine Harris to Ken Blackwell—it's amazing we're ever surprised when the party backs scoundrels. Its only ethos is winning.
@MJaMitchell That's the point. She was just an average American. It was the party hacks connected to CREEP who put party over country, partisan politics over principle.

@RonWaxman Besides, I'm an attorney. I've seen *all* the "attorney movies" you'd expect. Not sure most journalists would care about that. Sometimes our heads are in a "lane" even when we know better.
@RonWaxman The excuses aren't good ones; I'm just being honest about where my head was at. But that certainly doesn't mean I haven't read a great deal about Nixon over the years. I just hadn't read this one book/seen this one film.
5/ As a viewer, perhaps unsurprisingly I find myself drawn to Bernstein most; he's exacting about the pieces, while Woodward devalues pieces until the whole ("it") is solid. It's inductive versus deductive, at least as portrayed in the film. I think the big truths are inductive.
4/ Like Bradlee saying "you don't have it" to Woodward/Bernstein, which I bet some find sage but I find ridiculous as someone who teaches journalism. In a story so big, there's no "it"—*one* big story. There are 1,000 pieces that make up the "event." Get every piece right, first.
3/ Some of the things I refer to are obvious—like the way competition between outlets was foregrounded or Woodward/Bernstein were derided as being the "wrong people" to be covering such a big story. But I also mean more subtle things in the film and the media culture of the time.
2/ It's not so surprising that I haven't seen ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN—as I don't work fulltime in journalism and it came out before I was born. But I can't imagine what excuse fulltime journalists have for not seeing that they're repeating many seventies' media-subculture errors.
1/ You could take almost any line from ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and apply it to some scenario we've seen, or controversy about what to cover and when (or who's "legitimate" enough to cover it), and the way false denials by the White House have made media (wrongly) fear it's wrong.
I finally did it—watched ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. It's not just that all this has happened before, but that all the conversations we're having about how this is being covered and by whom and with what response from the White House and under what circumstances has happened before.

@LeadHolders I agree about the Deep South, though there are success stories in Fayetteville, Oxford, Nashville, Atlanta and a number of other places you're ignoring. You basically mean rural areas in these regions—and only some of them. That's a small part of much larger regional narratives.
@commute_life No—I think the people of Santa Fe, San Antonio, Minneapolis, Lawrence, and *many* other places not on the coasts would disagree with you. This is an old canard that needs to die. And FWIW, ask about race relations in *Boston* compared to, say, a 25% nonwhite city like Des Moines.
@LeadHolders Cities I'm familiar with? For starters, Chicago, Lincoln, Madison, Minneapolis, Boulder, Austin, Albuquerque, Salt Lake City, Fargo, Denver, Columbus, Lawrence, Des Moines, Fargo, Boise, Iowa City, Indianapolis, Santa Fe, San Antonio...like, are you serious? I can name a hundred.
2/ Obviously I'm speaking only of my own experience—and all such geographic generalities are fundamentally stupid and puerile. But I do think it's sad and embarrassing when a coastal lefty basically acknowleges that they have no clue how much better their life could be elsewhere.
1/ I've lived in both Iowa and DC, Boston and Wisconsin, and now I live in New Hampshire. In large coastal cities I have found a willingness to accept a low-grade misery that I never found in the Midwest. Even now I consider Midwestern living fundamentally better in all respects.
Maher is right that Amazon must think more creatively about its expansion. And he may be right about why Trumpism has flourished in Mississippi and West Virginia.

RT @SethAbramson: The idea that we'd pretend these three possibilities are *equally possible* when we know Manafort secretly offered in-kin…
41/ The sanctions discussed here are potential pre-annexation U.S. sanctions relating (in 2013) to an entirely different issue (stemming from the actions of pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politicians), but it's still fascinating to see Manafort working directly on fighting U.S. sanctions. https://t.co/VzpWBRqctb
40/ The attachments confirm it: Manafort was working for Kremlin interests lobbying the US government as that very government was putting sanctions on the Kremlin—*the* key political issue that Putin's fear of a Clinton presidency and promotion of a Trump presidency was based on.
39/ My point here is simply to emphasize that Paul Manafort was working (in essence) for the Kremlin lobbying people who were already or could be powerful in Washington at a point when the Kremlin *very* much wanted to cultivate Trump as a U.S. politician who'd be in its corner.
38/ The Agalarovs arrived in the U.S. to begin luring Trump to Moscow one week after this notation regarding an email from an unknown entity to Rick Gates (just saying): https://t.co/15U1ecIRaj
37/ Per Sam Nunberg, Trump decided to run in November 2012; Roger Stone says by January 1, 2013. Mueller's redactions go *fully insane* after that point—he wants us to see basically *nothing*. This suggests that Manafort may have been working on issues relevant to the *election*.
I'm sorry, but the "Hey, maybe Mueller has nothing on Manafort related to Russia?" days are *over* if you've done any work on the Trump-Russia case whatsoever— whether journalism or legal analysis or (as I have ) both of those things plus writing two 450-page books on the subject
The idea that we'd pretend these three possibilities are *equally possible* when we know Manafort secretly offered in-kind value to the Kremlin during the campaign—offered it to both Kilimnik (GRU) and Deripaska (Kremlin)—in exchange for "getting whole" is *really bad journalism* https://t.co/cvky2M4mxV
36/ Redacting the names of certain people, in or out of government, that Paul Manafort met with? Okay. They may be innocents. What about redacting the initials of the person who demanded regular briefings from Manafort on his progress? That's a very *different* sort of redaction.
35/ Mueller redacts from these attachments—with *alarming* regularity—many of the people who were directing Manafort and who Manafort corresponded with, including some identified by initials (Oleg Deripaska seems a likely candidate). Why redact unless these people may be charged?
34/ By the way, does everyone realize that Manafort was *living in Trump Tower* for the entirety of his 10-year course of collusion with pro-Kremlin forces in Ukraine—and that he'd long known Trump before he bought an apartment from him? Why do we always assume Trump is clueless?
33/ EXHIBIT 438 blacks out the name of a *Congressman*. Could that be just for the sake of not implicating a Congressman falsely in Manafort's crimes? Absolutely. Or it could be that the Congressman is Dana Rohrabacher, and that we have lots of evidence about what *he* was up to.
32/ Manafort's daughter texted a friend saying Trump and Manafort spent all day "plotting" in Trump Tower—and in January '18 Trump was privately telling friends that Manafort could "flip" on him and hurt him badly. Does any of that sound like Trump was in the dark about Manafort?
31/ But what's not clear is *why in the world Manafort would've had to keep that secret* given Trump's opposition to the sanctions and friendliness with Putin. There'd *no reason* at all for Manafort to withhold what he was *really* doing working for Trump's campaign "for free."
30/ Given that we know Manafort owed money to his bosses after 2014, it's not just a reasonable read of the facts but perhaps the *only* reasonable read of the facts that Manafort was instructed to go work for Trump *once it was clear Trump was viable*—approximately February '16.
29/ *Well less than 24 months* after pro-Kremlin forces were paying Manafort for his work "on behalf of" Ukraine, Manafort was saying he "had to get to Trump"—at that point both the only candidate in America opposing the sanctions over Ukraine *and* a guy with a chance to *win*.
RT @SethAbramson: BREAKING NEWS: You can find the Manafort filing here: https://t.co/BVHMlI95oD
28/ Indeed, the natural continuation of Manafort's 2014 work for pro-Kremlin sources in Ukraine would've been to combat the sanctions Putin's February and March 2014 annexation eventually created. But which is better: lobbying Congress or working for an anti-sanctions candidate?
27/ Manafort looks to have been engaged with Ukraine during Putin's annexation of Crimea, but if the money trail goes dark after that point, which is more likely: Putin/Deripaska no longer needed Manafort to fight for pro-Kremlin interests—e.g. opposing sanctions—or *really* did?
26/ All this said, I'm reading the attachments now, and am happy to share what I find. For instance, I can confirm that EXHIBIT 434 shows the Manafort payments extended *beyond* Putin's invasion of Crimea—and why would Putin need Manafort's pro-Kremlin lobbying *less* after that?
25/ Any journalist who wants to die on the hill of "Manafort withheld nothing" or "Manafort withheld but for no reason" or "Mueller has told us all he knows because he's probably done" or "we *don't* have a mountain of public info but *only* what a final report says" can do so.
24/ No conclusion on what *else* Mueller has on Trump-Russia—beyond the mountain of info we *know* he has (all of which is in PROOF OF COLLUSION)—can be drawn from this filing, which means either Manafort withheld nothing and Mueller is near done or...the opposite on both counts.
23/ So if you go on TV, or come on social media, and say, "See, Mueller can't reveal to us all the ties between Manafort and Russia, because... maybe there are none!" you're both contradicting all the facts we have about Manafort-Russia contact *and* rewarding Manafort for lying.
22/ The very *reason* Manafort is looking at life in prison is because he *broke his agreement* with the feds by lying and withholding information from them—and what he lied and withheld had to do with a Russian agent, Kilimnik, and Manafort's contacts with him from 2016 to 2018.
21/ The bigger issue is that *anyone*—in media, politics, or the public—who uses the fact of Mueller's redactions or us not getting much useful Trump-Russia info from this filing is (in the nonlegal sense) abetting Manafort. His lies, we know, *did* cover up Trump-Russia conduct.
20/ It wouldn't be so hard for me to link the Crimea/Trump campaign timeline to Manafort's crimes to show that his entire participation in the Trump campaign was part of a criminal scheme. But that'd still take us to our origin-point: what did Trump know of it? And who else knew?
19/ The fact that we're still getting redactions means more indictments are coming (keeping in mind a few redactions could be protecting innocent parties from harassment or unfair connection to criminal conduct). If Mueller were "done" there'd be little to no need for redactions.
18/ Per usual, a mulligan will lead Trumpists—who still, two years on, know nothing more about this wildly complex and labyrinthine federal criminal investigation besides cries of "no collusion!" and "ROTFLMAO" taunts—to think that somehow nothing's coming. They're *still* wrong.
17/ We don't know—due to redactions and the lack of a PSR—if this filing has nothing in it (or little in it) of use to Trump-Russia discourse, or if what's useful are pages that were sealed. But for now this filing looks like a "mulligan"—it doesn't move the ball either way much.
16/ For that reason, my feeling with this document was that either @KenDilanianNBC would be, if not right—he said mid-February—at least within a month of getting the date of Mueller's report release right, in which case this filing could reveal a lot, or it would reveal nothing.
15/ Attorneys aren't trained—in law school or on the job—to send signals via filings. Either an attorney wants an argument and/or information to be made public and makes the argument the best she can, or she keeps the information entirely under wraps. Attorneys don't do subtlety.
14/ Am I intrigued by lines like these (below)? Yes. But we mustn't pretend Mueller is sending "signals."		"[Manafort's] deceit, which is a fundamental component of the crimes of conviction and relevant conduct, extended to members of the executive branch of the U.S. government."
13/ If I had much work yet to do; if I trusted DOJ to handle my final report (whenever it comes) responsibly; if disclosing more info on Manafort would endanger sources or methods; if I didn't want future defendants to get a jump on what's coming—I would do what Mueller did here.
12/ I'll say this: if I were Mueller and knew my work was done, and worried that dirty partisan politics could obscure my final report—and if that report were coming shortly—I'd use filings like this to get information to the public. So Mueller has made a different decision here.
11/ Both those who thought this filing would be a big reveal *and* those who think that it not being a big reveal somehow tells us something are wrong. The important information would be in the PSR, and it's been sealed, likely—again—for various reasons. So the mystery continues.
10/ That Mueller doesn't want us to see the pre-sentence investigation could partly be because it contains info he doesn't want public, or partly for other reasons (e.g., to protect other parties, or withhold information that for some reason Manafort is entitled to keep private).
9/ Prior to this filing coming out, there were folks on Twitter and elsewhere implying Mueller would definitely use this document to lay out everything Manafort has ever done wrong. I wasn't of that view—though I acknowledged the possibility the document *could* have useful info.
8/ Never forget: we *know* what was in the letter Manafort and Barrack wrote—with Roger Stone in support by phone—to get Manafort his job with Trump (who he'd long known). That letter *emphasized* the work Manafort had done in Ukraine. He didn't hide *that* from *Trump* at all.
7/ Was Trump the sort of "high-level champion and politically credible friend" Manafort wanted to cultivate while working on behalf of pro-Kremlin forces? Well, he was looking for such friends in mid-2012, so why not 44 months later, when he told Barrack "I have to get to Trump"? https://t.co/IxJbjJeBzJ
6/ Remember that Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2014, so Manafort was actively assisting politicians in Ukraine who supported Putin's invasion in 2014, 2015, and into 2016. This underscores that Manafort's work in Ukraine benefitted Putin indirectly and, eventually, directly.
5/ No big deal—Manafort was only involved in lobbying related to *arms deals with Saudi Arabia* (which certainly wasn't a clandestine issue during the 2016 campaign, as Saudi Arabia hoped for nuclear tech from a prospective Trump administration and colluded with him to get it): https://t.co/3qukLrpU5W
4/ I'm not sure I realized Manafort was an agent of Saudi Arabia from 1984 to 1986, and I wonder what sort of contacts he made during that period that might have carried forward into subsequent decades.
3/ The pre-sentence report done on Manafort appears to be the subject of a good bit of the redaction in this filing. A PSR would look at circumstances and conduct and information outside the scope of the current charges themselves—in other words, it could consider collusive acts.
2/ In total, Trump was in contact with Manafort for 10 of the 12 months of 2016, a year in which Mueller says Manafort was still laundering money related to pro-Kremlin politicians.
1/ Mueller says Manafort was still laundering money in 2016—which is interesting because it was mid-February 2016, just 6 weeks into the year that he was still money laundering, that Manafort met with Trump's good pal Thomas Barrack and told Barrack that he "had to get to Trump."

The key thing to look for tonight is how much of Mueller's new Manafort filing is redacted		If little or nothing is redacted, it suggests Mueller sees no need to hide any of his evidence anymore		If a lot is redacted, it means more indictments coming eventually against someone(s)
Everyone in media playing the let's-guess-when-Mueller-will-finish game needs to get out of that game right now
I've tweeted that I'd apologize to @KenDilanianNBC if his December claim that Mueller's report would come out in mid-February were accurate (i.e., if it wasn't—as I argued—poorly sourced reporting previously found untrue 6 times)		Update: I won't be apologizing to @KenDilanianNBC
RESOURCES2. Both "circumstantial" and "direct" evidence are *regularly used in trials*—and as some cases note, sometimes circumstantial evidence is *more* convincing than direct evidence—so these terms are worth looking up too. It underscores how silly the "no evidence" claim is.
RESOURCES. I encourage folks to follow @neal_katyal to find more on an interesting argument: if Mueller acts primarily as *investigator*—bringing indictments only when they further the *investigation* phase of the Trump-Russia case—he may hand off the prosecuting to Main Justice.
CONCLUSION3. And finally—because in the view of *any* responsible attorney in America the Manafort-Kilimnik conspiracy would *alone* put proof of Trump-Russia collusion at *over 50%*—we must *stop* with this wild, out-of-court misuse of the phrase "presumption of innocence." /end
CONCLUSION2. Also, we must *keep pushing* for the correction of *past* media reports—and proper writing of *current* reports—as to whether *any* GOPer can claim there's "no evidence" of collusion, or merely say they think there isn't *90%* proof: a different proposition entirely.
CONCLUSION. We *must* fight to see as much of Mueller's report as possible—and *must* fight to remind media that *as to Trump* this is a noncriminal process and that because national security is at stake, standards of proof *well* below "beyond a reasonable doubt" should be used.
70. And today's big news from Reuters that the NBC/CNN/WP/NYT reports on the timing of Mueller's final report were premature seems to support my view. But what I've said here is that, *even if Mueller were well and truly done*, the chances we'll misunderstand his report are high.
69. I've said many times I *don't* think Mueller is done—either with his investigation proper (for all the reasons I just stated) or with all the Congressional investigations and future criminal cases that could arise based on what he's found (for all the reasons I just stated).
68. ...indefinitely just two weeks ago, meaning that his continued assistance is *not* needed for Manafort—who's now at the sentencing phase—but for some *other* indictment not yet brought...and on and on and on. In other words, this whole thread assumes Mueller really *is* done.
67. ...or the fact that Mueller just extended his grand jury for 6 months, or that Mueller is still fighting in court to get grand jury testimony from a key witness and grand jury document production from a foreign corporation, or the fact that Gates' sentencing was continued...
66. ...or the fact that many others *besides* Trump Jr. and Prince might fall into this category, or the fact that *many* federal cooperators Mueller has considered *enormously* helpful (e.g., Flynn and Nader) have yet to see the indictments their information generated brought...
65. ...or the fact that Congress has now sent all its inquiry transcripts to Mueller, along with criminal referrals, under circumstances in which major-media reporting already confirms that two key Trump-Russia witnesses, Trump Jr. and Prince, can both be charged with felonies...
64. ...or entirely *new* developments touching on Donald Trump's criminal liability, like this BREAKING NEWS from today... https://t.co/0Aih9z3Dtg
63. ...the many cases that Bob Mueller has "handed off" to other federal prosecutors (doubtless only *some* of which we know about), any ongoing state or federal cases (e.g., Epstein or Cohen, respectively) that could produce new information relevant to Mueller's investigation...
62. For the purposes of this thread, I've put *aside* all the signs Mueller isn't close to done—or any reference to still-sealed indictments, Jerome Corsi's pending indictment, the ongoing possibility of cooperation deals with Stone or Manafort or Erickson (Butina's boyfriend)...
61. So if you're wondering why this lawyer, former public defender, former investigator, and current legal advocacy prof would write a thread *this long* on *this boring a topic*, it's because America could lose this ballgame—its national security—before any report is even filed.
60. And to get even *further* into the weeds, the way media and politicians are setting this all up would allow AG Barr to withhold from Congress and America *any* information that isn't sufficient for prosecution—even though "beyond a reasonable doubt" *isn't the standard here*.
59. As if *that* weren't bad enough, both politicians *and* the media are setting us up to believe that *anyone* Mueller *doesn't* bring charges against—or in the president's case, recommend charges against—not only didn't do anything but there is "no evidence" they did anything.
58. Moreover, we have members of media using the phrase "no evidence" (0% proof) *synonymously* with "beyond a reasonable doubt" (90%+ proof) when quoting GOP officials making political statements, which makes it even harder to safeguard American via a future impeachment hearing.
57. So we have a situation in which *most* Americans—on *these* allegations, in a *noncriminal* hearing—would set the standard of proof at somewhere between 15% and 50.1%, yet Trump's allies will demand a standard *higher* than (say) *97%* to impeach him.		That endangers America.
56. So Mueller may have proof "beyond a reasonable doubt" that Trump committed federal crimes and *still* wouldn't say that he had done so in his final report. This would effectively make the standard for impeachment among Trump's allies *higher* than "beyond a reasonable doubt."
55. That's right: even though we're discussing a noncriminal hearing (impeachment), and even though a president who's a foreign asset is *far more dangerous* than any one person in America could *ever* be, some prosecutors want Mueller to treat Trump *better* than everybody else.
54. We're now hearing something *terrifying* that you'd *never* hear from public defenders—who defend average Americans in criminal cases—and would *only* hear from a politically minded prosecutor: the standard of proof for Trump will be *higher* than "beyond a reasonable doubt."
53. My *personal* opinion is that if you *even* set the standard of proof for betraying America to its enemies at "clear and convincing" in a *noncriminal case* you're *endangering us all*. The *highest* standard *anyone* could rationally defend—at a stretch—would be 50.1% proof.
52. If the allegations against Trump were like the allegations against Clinton—lying about sex—*many* Americans might decide to set the standard of proof at "beyond a reasonable doubt" for an impeachment, and demand their Senators do the same. *That's not where we are right now*.
51. And the reason it *doesn't matter* is *what kind of America-hating buffoon would require more than 70% certainty that a president has criminally betrayed his country to want that president removed from office for the safety of all America*? I'm serious—what sort of *buffoon*?
50. What we're *also* saying is that—as to impeachment proceedings—whether Mueller says that Trump could be charged with crimes under a "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard or that there's "only" enough proof to meet the "clear and convincing" standard (70% proof) doesn't matter.
49. We're saying that Senators *aren't* jurors in a criminal case—so they don't need to "presume innocence" pre-impeachment if they've seen evidence that makes them think someone *isn't* innocent. And at the impeachment, they can use *any standard of proof that they want to use*.
48. When we say impeachment is a "political" (not "criminal") process—because there are no criminal penalties, like imprisonment—and that allegations can be brought in an impeachment (like "Abuse of Power") that aren't statutory crimes, we're saying a lot more than you may think.
47. Anyone who thinks the Impeachment Clause's "high crimes and misdemeanors" means that allegations in an impeachment must be proven "beyond a reasonable doubt" is *wrong*. Any lawyer will tell you you're wrong. The Republicans who impeached Clinton would tell you you're wrong.
46. In that scenario, *any* American—including *any member of Congress*—for whom the necessary "standard of proof" (in a *non-criminal hearing* where the allegation is conspiring with our enemies) is "clear and convincing" or *anything below that*, will demand Trump be impeached.
45. So let's say Mueller can prove Trump conspired with our enemies at the "clear and convincing" level of proof—will he allege, in his report, that Trump can be charged with criminal conspiracy? No. He would simply summarize his mountain of evidence and let us decide what to do.
44. Well, it'd mean Mueller will *prosecute* a person—specifically, any person who's committed an offense falling under Mueller's broad DOJ authorization—if he thinks he can prove his case "beyond a reasonable doubt." Any case he can prove *below* that standard he *won't* charge.
43. So let's imagine Mueller sees himself as both an investigator and a prosecutor—which is technically correct, as DOJ regulations give him the power to prosecute instances of criminality he uncovers as part of his investigation into Trump-Russia collusion. What would that mean?
42. Though arrests require "probable cause"—25% proof—in theory prosecutors don't take a case to trial/plea unless they believe they can prove it "beyond a reasonable doubt" (90%+ proof). This creates a natural tension between the investigative and prosecutorial phases of a case.
41. And here's where we come, finally, to Special Counsel Mueller's final report on Trump-Russia collusion, which will arrive in March at the earliest but—for all we know—could arrive after Mueller's grand jury finishes its term (*after Mueller extended it in January*) this July.
40. As I began researching Trump-Russia collusion for *two* trade-press books on the subject—reading hundreds and hundreds of articles from all across the world and going back decades—I *well* surpassed "15% to 20% certainty" that Donald Trump had committed impeachable offenses.
39. To say there's "15% to 20% proof" that Trump—among much else—Aided/Abetted Computer Crimes under federal law, or committed Bribery, or committed Obstruction in a way that colluded with crimes by our enemies, would be to say that the proof is shy of indictment level but close.
38. More specifically, before I learned *anything* about the Trump-Russia facts and timeline, I "presumed innocence" for Trump—and then, when approximately 15% to 20% proof was provided that Trump had colluded with our enemies, I deemed him too great a risk to remain in office.
37. Personally, because I *love America* and because an impeachment *isn't a criminal case*—i.e. there's no danger of an impeached president going to jail *because* he was removed from office—my standard of proof for a commander-in-chief betraying us to our enemies is *very low*.
36. As you can see from my hypothetical, what we *demand* as Americans is that our *juries*—in *criminal cases*—presume innocence until someone is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As for the *rest* of us—everyone *but* the jurors—we can think *whatever the hell we want*.
35. HYPOTHETICAL: You live on a quiet street with your spouse and 3 kids—2 girls and a boy. A man moves next door who stands accusing of raping 3 girls in two states. Is your family allowed to *avoid this man at all costs*—or must you "presume innocence" and ask him to a cookout?
34. Trump's allies and supporters not *only* say that the standard for this should be "beyond a reasonable doubt" (90%+ certainty of treachery against the United States), they also *demand* that *everybody* in America *permanently* give this person the "presumption of innocence."
33. HYPOTHETICAL (continued): Under such circumstances, what should the standard of proof be—for the accusation that a man with his finger on the nuclear trigger is conspiring against us with our enemies—for the man *simply* to be taken from a position in which he can cause harm?
32. HYPOTHETICAL: A man who has been accused 20 times of sexual harassment or assault, and repeatedly accused of fraud in his business dealings, has his finger on the nuclear trigger—with the power to kill you and your family—and is *now* accused of working for America's enemies.
31. We cannot *imagine* a person so stupid as to think—in a race for condo association president—that you must prove with *90% or more certainty* that one of the candidates is a serial bank robber to justify a vote against that person. Most people would say 10% to 20% certainty.
30. Based on your personality—risk-averse/not; forgiving/not; skeptical/not—your answer on who you want in charge of condo fees (someone accused of 6 bank robberies or not) will be that the standard is "reasonable suspicion," "probable cause," or "preponderance of the evidence."
29. HYPOTHETICAL: You live in a condo complex with a "condo association" run by a "condo association president." There's an accusation that 1 of the 2 men running for president has robbed 6 banks. What standard of proof must be met for you to vote against him for condo president?
28. Faced with this question—and it *is* the question before us, whether journalists pose it or not—Trump's supporters and allies suddenly shift from false cries of "no evidence" to the *other end of the spectrum*: *demanding* the standard of proof be "beyond a reasonable doubt."
27. So the conversation Burr's interview *should've* initiated is this:		What's the *appropriate* standard of proof to be met when the allegation is that a president criminally betrayed his country and is a national security threat and the remedy requested is removal from office?
26. If journalists had educated America on standards of proof, it would've been clear to all that Burr *hasn't* concluded that there's "no evidence of collusion," but rather something *entirely different*: that in *his* view, the standard of proof he wants to see met hasn't been.
25. The headline from Burr's CBS interview was therefore this:		TOP REPUBLICAN SENATOR INVESTIGATING COLLUSION SAYS EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION EXISTS, PERMANENTLY ENDING TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS' "NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION" MANTRA		Instead we got: "Burr says no evidence of collusion."
24. ...it means the big debate over whether there's *any* evidence of criminal collusion (conspiracy, aiding and abetting, or charged as any other federal crime) is *over*. Repeat: it's *over*. *All* we're arguing about now is *what standard of proof [of collusion] has been met*.
23. The reason Burr's statement acknowledging evidence of criminal collusion exists was the headline of his CBS interview is twofold: (1) It means the most powerful GOP Senator looking into collusion *disagrees* with Trump and his allies that there's "no evidence" of it; and (2):
22. The moment Senator Burr admitted to CBS—which he did—that the Senate had collected evidence of criminal collusion (chargeable, variously, as conspiracy, aiding and abetting, or any criminal offense whose underlying facts involve collusion)—*that* was the story's *only* lede.
21. We *know* Burr doesn't *actually* think there's "no evidence of collusion"—in the legal sense of the phrase "no evidence"—because he spent his CBS interview with @Olivia_Gazis saying the Senate had evidence *some people would read as sufficient proof of [criminal] collusion*.
20. So when Senator Richard Burr, Republican Chair of the Senate Intel Committee, said that there was "no evidence of collusion"—a phrase media and Trump supporters *leapt* on—either he lied, he misspoke, or, because he's only a businessman, he knows nothing of legal terminology.
19. BREAKING NEWS: Those of us who have consistently said that Mueller's Trump-Russia report would *not* be finished by February 2019 have turned out to be correct—and those who insisted otherwise *incorrect*—according to major breaking news from Reuters: https://t.co/ZIcRHZ4fss
18. To say that there's "no evidence" of something is to say that *not a single fact exists* that *makes a matter in controversy more likely to come down one way or another*—"no evidence" would mean no circumstantial evidence, no direct evidence, no evidence *of any kind at all*.
17. NO EVIDENCE (0%). This phrase doesn't really exist in the law—as "no evidence" isn't a "standard" of proof or "level" of proof a judge could ever formally recognize, and indeed we almost never encounter "no evidence" of something in the law—so you'd *rarely* hear these words.
16. And yet there's *another level of proof*—I won't say "standard of proof," as no such standard exists in the law—that's become *critical* to the Trump-Russia investigation. It's a *non-legal* phrase used (and, I'd add, willy-nilly) by Trump's supporters and allies. Here it is:
15. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT (90%+): What percentage should unofficially be assigned to beyond a reasonable doubt—the standard of proof prosecutors must meet to convict someone of a crime—is hotly contested. But everyone generally agrees it's at least 90% certainty of something.
14. CLEAR AND CONVINCING (70%): I won't spend much time on this standard of proof—it comes up rarely—but I want you to know it exists. If you've proven something is true with 70% certainty, 70% is considered—unofficially speaking—to have met the "clear and convincing" standard.
13. PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE (50.1%): In civil cases—where "only" money is at stake—the plaintiff merely needs to prove its case by what's called a "more likely than not" standard, or "preponderance of the evidence." If something is "more likely than not," it's 50.1% likely.
12. (In just a moment you're going to see how explosively relevant all this is to Donald Trump and the Russia investigation.)
11. In *practice*, probable cause is less than 25% certainty. The reason lawyers say that "the average grand jury would indict a ham sandwich"—an indictment being a legal instrument, requiring probable cause, accusing someone of a crime—is because the standard is treated as low.
10. PROBABLE CAUSE (25%): Probable cause is a "higher" standard of proof than reasonable suspicion is. It's what needs to be shown to a judge to get a search warrant, and what law enforcement needs to arrest someone. It *should* be more certainty than mere "reasonable suspicion*.
9. For instance, imagine that a police officer on patrol on a given street sees something that gives him a "reasonable suspicion" that a murder has just been committed in a home's backyard. If the officer even "5% thinks it happened," we certainly want to see him go investigate.
8. Generally, the *more* serious the criminal offense, the *less* certainty a law enforcement officer needs to show a judge—I'm speaking in practical terms here; that is, where the rubber meets the road in real cases—that s/he had in initiating an investigation. That makes sense.
7. REASONABLE SUSPICION (5% to 20%): Depending on the situation, "reasonable suspicion"—the level of certainty someone did something that's needed for law enforcement to initiate an investigative "stop" of a person—could be treated by a judge as anywhere from 5% to 20% certainty.
6. It's helpful, in discussing standards of proof, to know that they're often *informally* attached to percentages—with the percentage representing the "level of certainty" a finder of fact needs to have (that an accusation is true) for a finding of legal liability to be entered.
5. STANDARD OF PROOF. Here are the most common standards of proof we encounter in our justice system (in ascending order of how hard they are to meet):		a. REASONABLE SUSPICION	b. PROBABLE CAUSE	c. PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE	d. CLEAR AND CONVINCING	e. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT
4. What "burden of proof" means is that a party to a case must prove its case to the finder of fact (whether judge or jury) to a well-established level of certainty called the "standard of proof" required for that particular sort of case. Different cases have different standards.
3. BURDEN OF PROOF. Depending on the type of legal proceeding involved, the "burden of proof" in a case may rest on any one of several parties—but the most common scenario is a criminal hearing in which the *entirety* of the "burden of proof" rests on the *prosecuting authority*.
2. Americans wrongly believe the "presumption of innocence" a general principle all Americans must adopt; it manifestly is not and isn't meant to be. What it means is a courtroom finder of fact—usually a jury—must presume innocence unless and until a burden of proof has been met.
1. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. The "presumption of innocence" is what's called in the justice system a "trial presumption," meaning it has force and effect exclusively in a setting in which a "finder of fact" (usually a jury) is deliberating after evidence has been presented to it.
(THREAD) If—as reported by CNN, NBC, NYT, and WP—we're days or weeks from Mueller delivering a report on Trump-Russia collusion to DOJ, America needs a crash course in some basic concepts to understand what's happening.

(As for Ken saying I don't care about America, only money, *that's* a statement made without any evidence whatsoever—and a literal *lifetime* of evidence of working in modestly paid public service that offers proof *against* his claim—for which I will *never* receive an apology.)
Re: @KenDilanianNBC, we all agree his December story that Mueller "could" file his report with DOJ "as soon as mid-February" didn't mean anything—as every day post-February 14 until Doomsday is "as soon as mid-February." But if Mueller files in February I *will* apologize to Ken.
NOTE2/ I should've added that IF Barr prematurely shut down Mueller (as the spouse of Trump's Director of Strategic Communications somehow "knew" on Twitter)—but which I DON'T think is what this is—it goes without saying that protestors shutting down D.C. is the only option left.
@BeeseJoe @ZJBardou @ggreenwald I *work*, moron
NOTE/ Having said that, should Mueller give DOJ a report that Barr then publishes—redacted—suggesting no illegal pre-election conspiracy with foreign powers, I'll be happy to publish PROOF OF CONSPIRACY to show America what Barr would have had to redact to reach his "conclusion."
PS5/ For all we know, Robert Mueller will dump tons of raw intel into the laps of Congress and the CIA and tell them to investigate it all because he doesn't want to exceed his mandate. We just can't know now and *won't* know for many, many more months—and maybe not even in 2019.
PS4/ I can't give you an answer on where these clear lines of federal inquiry are going, and neither can anyone else—but I know they exist and I know they cannot and will not be blithely closed with a simple report in March. *Many* of these threads are *far* too explosive to end.
PS3/ So (taking that as just one example of many), I could take today's news as meaning that Trump Jr. will be charged with Lying to Congress by March and then leaned on for more info on Wikistrat/Psy-Group; that this is all part of the ongoing counterintel op; or something else.
PS2/ For instance, I did a thread a week ago summarizing that we have *all ends* of an illegal "quid pro quo" of pre-election collusion involving the Trump campaign and an Israeli business intelligence operation that successfully sold Trump Jr. on a Saudi-funded disinfo campaign.
PS/ Those of us *also* in the midst of researching books are in a particularly fraught place—as we need to get our research done and *know* a book-length treatise is required to explain what's happened, but *also* know how bad the truth is and that therefore this isn't near over.
25/ (And/or to explain how the news the reporters are reporting doesn't actually mean what some of the reporters are implying—as I've tried to do here by emphasizing how many different explosive directions this situation could go in over the next month, many harrowing for Trump.)
24/ So if you're seeing attorneys scrambling a bit here, it's because reporters have the easy job in this instance—simply saying whether they're hearing a report is coming—and attorneys the much harder job: to explain how that could be the case when it *factually* makes no sense.
23/ Certainly, we know that people like Flynn and Gates have provided the feds with enormous cooperation with secret intel only they (or they and few people) have—and we've seen *no indictments* from that information, which means other shoes *have* to drop. That's how this works.
22/ Just one probe *alone*—of Trump's inaugural committee—has many of the same witnesses as the Russia investigation "proper" (e.g., Barrack, Flynn, Gates, and more), so how and whether charges emanate from those cases will determine how much more such cases produce on collusion.
21/ I'm only scratching the surface of this topic here. We still may have up to 20 sealed indictments per the DC docket (or none, or more) and even CNN notes that "even with signs of a wrap-up, the DC US Attorney's office has stepped in to work on cases that may continue longer."
20/ So if the reports are right, as @neal_katyal says we're only at the "end of the beginning," not the end of the end. And depending upon how and why we got here now, and what Mueller says in his report—or else sees redacted—we may well be at the beginning of a year of scandals.
19/ The upshot: lawyers and investigators (or, like me, lawyers and former investigators) have consistently said that *on the facts* Mueller can't be done with his work or even 3 months from done; CNN and MSNBC are reporting that *administratively* Mueller may be closing up shop.
18/ We don't know if Mueller was forced to end his work by Barr; if Mueller chose not to indict certain Trump compatriots because they're cooperating witnesses in an impeachable-offense (collusion-related) allegation against Trump; if Mueller handed off explosive cases, or what.
17/ Mueller's report, if indeed issued in March, could include information that leads to new counterintelligence investigations, new criminal investigations, new Congressional hearings that lead to new security concerns and new criminal referrals—we just have no idea whatsoever.
16/ We also know that Robert Mueller may or may not close (or be involved with, or even know about) every *counterintelligence* case that may remain open about Trump and his campaign—possibly leading to new criminal cases down the line—as opposed to Mueller's *criminal* inquiry.
15/ What those who've been reporting that Mueller is close to issuing a final report have been saying is simply that: that he's close to issuing a "final report." That doesn't mean "the Russia investigation is complete" in anything like the way most people will hear that phrase.
14/ At the same time, as DOJ doesn't comment on ongoing investigations, any "hand-off" cases that go to other federal prosecutors (say at SDNY, EDVA or DC) will not necessarily be addressed in any "final" report, or, if mentioned, may appear partly or wholly redacted pre-release.
13/ So a "final" report from Robert Mueller could be issued at the same time as any number of indictments are brought or pursued, with DOJ knowing that Mueller's office will have to supplement any "final" report with anything it learns from current or future indicted individuals.
12/ Even taking all this—and more—into account, Mueller is entitled to issue a "final" report saying who he prosecuted, who he *plans to prosecute* or *is about to prosecute*, and who he chose not to prosecute (which could include the president, non-prosecuted due to DOJ regs).
11/ Mueller is still fighting with one individual and one corporation to compel grand jury testimony, and just extended his grand jury 6 months, so those matters must be litigated, as must outstanding subpoenas for document production—apparently internationally—that Mueller sent.
10/ Mueller's office previously told Jerome Corsi it would indict him, and that still hasn't happened; Congress has sent transcripts to Mueller indicating felony perjury or lying to Congress by Erik Prince, Donald Trump Jr. and others, and those charges have not yet been brought.
9/ Russian spy Maria Butina's boyfriend Paul Erickson was just charged, and we don't know what he'll reveal; Roger Stone was just charged, and we don't know what he'll reveal; Manafort may face new charges or may balk when he gets his sentence, so we don't know what he'll reveal.
8/ One reason many attorneys (me, Preet Bharara, and many others) saw Mueller delivering a report to DOJ this summer rather than this spring—keeping in mind that when *we* see it, and how much of it we see, is a different matter—is because certain things can't be wrapped up yet.
7/ This is why some inexact language being used by very good reporters at CNN should be checked, including one journalist who said (erroneously) that this report, if true, meant "the completion of the Russia investigation." If we know one thing, we know that that's not accurate.
6/ In making that second observation (about files leaving Mueller's office), CNN issued a *warning* about how we should understand what's happening—noting that the movement of files may signal a "hand-off" of certain cases (to other federal prosecutors) rather than their closure.
5/ Some of CNN's report is rehashed—reading signs about Mueller possibly finishing up it's noted before (e.g., 4 of Mueller's 17 prosecutors being reassigned). CNN also says it saw "special counsel's office employees carry boxes and push a cart full of files out of their office."
4/ A last hedge from CNN—and previously NBC—is that neither Justice nor Mueller will comment on these reports, and the sources are (of course) anonymous, so we have no idea how strong the sourcing is. The sources are at Justice—but whether they're in-the-know/biased we can't say.
3/ As someone who teaches journalism as well as legal advocacy, I'd say that's a heck of a lot of hedging. We got the same thing—admittedly on a more sparse report—from NBC's Pete Williams yesterday when he said "it's just our [NBC's] speculation" as to when Mueller will finish.
2/ 		(c) If true, it means Mueller's "nearly" done.	(d) "The precise timing of the announcement is subject to change."	(e) "The scope and contours of what Barr will send to Congress remain unclear."	(f) "Also unclear is how long it'll take Justice to prepare what it will submit."
1/ The first important thing is to understand that—as NBC has done with a similar report over the last two days—CNN hedged its bets on its report in every way possible:		(a) Barr's actions are merely "preparations."	(b) CNN treats the news as merely an "indication" of the future.
(THREAD) BREAKING: CNN says "AG Barr is preparing to announce as early as next week the completion of Mueller's Russia probe—with plans for Barr to submit to Congress soon after a summary of Mueller's confidential report." I unpack the news in this thread. https://t.co/yPjOgsYZiU
Another thing that's going to happen over the next 48 hours is that some hard questions will be asked about whether Mueller was prematurely shut down—which I would not bet on—given the comments by people in Trump's orbit that Barr planned to (in essence) "shut Mueller down."
What's going to happen in the next 48 hours will be the use of some inexact, non-legal language from talented, well-meaning journalists—with the result that there will be a great deal of confusion that is unnecessary. "Completion of the Russia investigation" is already incorrect. https://t.co/Urfj6ttiyB
I just finished teaching my pre-law class, so I'm seeing the breaking news on CNN for the first time now. I agree with Neal that this "the end of the beginning." Those who presume it will be the end of the end aren't understanding what this breaking news—if it is correct—imports. https://t.co/Jm7mrf7XTV

@dawn_sickles Hi Dawn, I don't think anyone should ever do anything they think unethical to be "on board" with anyone, so that's not a phrase I ever use. I think Peter is saying that whoever wins on the Democratic side is far preferable to Trump. That's a simple and very different proposition.

PS/ I'm sorry for the long thread. My upset has nothing to do with fear and everything to do with the fact that I came out of law school with massive debt and chose to be a "public defender" because that phrase means something to me. I would never act as an "enemy of the people."
10/ If by some insane miracle it were to be found that—despite all the evidence—Trump has never run afoul of our rule of law, I'd be first in line to say he should be treated no differently than any law-abiding citizen. If not, not. We're a nation of laws—and must always be. /end
9/ I am nobody's "enemy" because—unlike Trump—I identify myself by what I'm *for* rather than against. As a lawyer, I'm *for* the rule of law; as an educator, I'm *for* factual debate; as a poet, I'm *for* the dignity of all people and the possibility of beauty in all structures.
8/ "Enemy of the people" is a phrase despots use. For all that I've criticized Trump, I've consistently done so by saying he undermines and has contempt for our rule of law and the values that undergird rule of law. When he says "enemy of the people," he just means "enemy of me."
7/ There are international figures media recognizes as antisocial and dangerous—and they approach covering them accordingly. There are protocols. Here in America, Trump can foment hatred and violence and he'll still be covered not much differently then any Senator or Congressman.
6/ There was an obligation for media to do something to register that this man is antisocial and dangerous—*besides* chattering about it nightly with pundits from "both sides." If you're still attending and covering his pressers as you would anyone else's, you're normalizing him.
5/ Trump knows his followers won't distinguish between institutions and people when he uses the phrase "enemy of the people," not that either is OK. When some of us call this man dangerous, this is what we're referring to—his willingness to cause pain and fear to protect himself.
4/ When people write me to say, "Hey, I disagree with you, and here's why," I don't mind—in fact it's why my DMs are open. I want us to be able to communicate freely on important topics. But increasingly all I hear from Trump supporters is anger and abuse stoked by their hero.
3/ I believe it's possible for *any* person—including a president—to act in a way that positions them outside our civil society. Here in America, declaring *near-daily* to *tens of millions of people* that US media is the "enemy of the people" should have that effect immediately.
2/ Trump wants *anyone* who opposes him, in any fashion and for any reason and with any set of expressed values, to be regarded as an enemy of the people. He knows what he's doing, and how dangerous it is—and still he's treated as part of civilized society rather than outside it.
1/ I've said from the start that—though I can't think of what it could be—I always hold out hope there's some insane innocent explanation for everything that's happened. I've also said opposition to Trump should always be legal, peaceful, and fact-based. But none of that matters.
Lately I've started getting direct messages calling me an "enemy of the people." Trump is putting this nonsense into the jetstream, and his less sophisticated followers are beginning to hate in the way he hates and use rhetoric in the way he uses rhetoric, if they didn't already. https://t.co/bRww9ddGVQ
@19harvey30 God, let's hope so
@EdGreenberger A report said Rosenstein told people he wouldn't leave until either the report was finished or the probe on strong enough footing he believed it couldn't be shut down. I don't know why people won't just assume the second thing has happened, or that Rosenstein has been forced out.
Everyone, *including Pete Williams* in yesterday's "report," agrees that the Mueller investigation is as leakproof an investigation as they've ever seen in or out of D.C. So there's no reason to think that MSNBC, or even anyone at DOJ, has special insight into Mueller's timeline.
The truth: Rosenstein said at the time he began at DOJ that he'd only serve 2 years—and once the incoming AG told him he'd bring in his own team that plan was confirmed. Also, Rosenstein recommended Barr for the job—and so appears not to be afraid Barr will end the Mueller probe.
Pete apparently based his "reporting" on signs he personally considered persuasive, most having to do with the debunked theory that Rod Rosenstein has been empowered to decide he'll only leave DOJ when the Mueller report is done, so this is not a scheduled—and enforced—departure.
I finally watched that Pete Williams clip from yesterday in which he discusses on MSNBC his "reporting" that Mueller will deliver a report to DOJ in the next week or two. Those who told me about it did not *also* specify that Williams clearly says, "this is just our speculation."

@Mikel_Jollett It's OK for someone who's in an organization with the word "socialist" in it but also other words that change the meaning of the word "socialism" to proudly be in that organization, I mean that a democratic socialist or social democrat shouldn't be a member of the Socialist Party
Great article. https://t.co/0bErpGYqeU
@Mikel_Jollett I hear you but I look at it this way: anyone calling themselves something without knowing what the word they're calling themselves means is not someone I have to or do take very seriously whether they're on the right or the left, nor should media pay much attention to them either
I think it's fine for Fox News to spend the next two years talking about "socialism" without anyone on either side of the camera or watching at home having any idea what socialism or democratic socialism or progressivism is but if other outlets do even a bit of that it's shameful
I mean at what point is this just smart people arguing with stupid people and media covering the stupid people as though they were smart people and smart politicians pretending not to be smart so they can look smart by quietly hoovering up an additional 1.15% of the stupid vote
It's like if I told you I was going to call you at inconvenient hours every day for the next year and each time I did I addressed you by a mispronunciation of your name and then argued with you condescendingly each time about which of us knew how to really pronounce your name
I can't believe we have to go through a year of far-righters talking about socialism when they neither know what socialism is nor understand what democratic socialism is nor understand that even with respect to democratic socialism only one democratic socialist is running in 2020

I'm often asked, "Which probe do you think will finally do Trump in?" And I'm put in mind of animations in Civil War documentaries that show the "red" army inexorably being surrounded by the "blue"—you can see it a mile off. My answer to which probe will do him in? "All of them."
If the law gives Trump special privileges or exemptions, Mueller will honor those—and should. But in every other respect, law enforcement officials are *trained* to apply the same SOPs to all cases—and a really good lawman like Mueller won't deviate from that even under pressure.
The NYT also summarizes the *antithesis* of my journalistic ethos: "This is far from a routine criminal investigation....Mueller will have to make judgments about the impact on the country of making a criminal case against the president." No—all are equal under the law. Even him.
It was evident, early on, that the size and scope of the Trump-Russia case was such that journalists would need to *regularly* think about how "Americans have lost track" of the story and write reports "fusing the strands" of far-flung reporting. But that hasn't happened often.
Today's NYT story includes a summary of my journalistic philosophy: The Trump-Russia case "has been voluminously covered in the news media, to such a degree that many Americans have lost track of how unusual his behavior is. But fusing the strands reveals an extraordinary story."

10/ Having said all this, far and away the most likely possibility is that these two NBC reporters are using the same bad sources that were used on the six prior occasions the end of the Mueller investigation was erroneously reported by major media. My money's still on that. /end
9/ Certainly, no one believes (say) Prince, Bannon, Kushner, or Trump Jr. *need* to face indictments down the line that are exclusively non-collusion-related. Mueller may be at the point where all future indictments are expected to be in cases that are—overall—collusion-related.
8/ Another possibility: as Congress has already done, Mueller could issue a separate report for each of the discrete categories of investigation that he's permitted. For instance, he could issue a report on non-collusion-related crimes that arose in his collusion investigation.
7/ Just to play this hypothetical out, if this MSNBC reporter were correct that Justice had a report from Mueller, but had not acknowledged receiving it, that would, I'd admit, be well explained by the report being a status update Justice doesn't have to publicize or acknowledge.
6/ If Mueller needed a justification for such a report, it could come from *many* quarters, including that he previously had no AG he was allowed to issue a status report to, and that this new AG has publicly expressed doubts about Mueller's work that Mueller might want to allay.
5/ Such a document, in the nature of a status report, might help protect Mueller from any action Barr might take to close down his investigation. Having said this, let me be very clear here: I continue to say that the chance of a final report coming anytime soon is virtually nil.
4/ I'm merely musing here. I'm not claiming to know this has happened, or even to believe it's happened. But I do find the timing here interesting—as this would be a reasonable time for Mueller to cover his ass by creating a document telling a new AG how much he has accomplished.
3/ I think it's interesting that we're hearing two MSNBC journalists being so insistent a report is coming soon—with one implying it's already here—right as Main Justice has a new AG coming in. Could this alleged report be Mueller issuing a report to a new AG to protect himself?
2/ Long, long ago, we had a conversation here on the feed about whether the authorization letter that initiated the Mueller probe permits anything other than a final report. I speculated at the time that perhaps Mueller would want to issue a status report, but might be unable to.
1/ Here's my take on that: someone at Justice who's not in the know—and may be a Trump partisan—is leaking things to this MSNBC reporter to put pressure on Mueller to hurry up. But there's a second possibility, which is that there *is* such report—but it's *not the final report*.
Just 5 weeks after Mueller extended his Trump-Russia grand jury for 6 months—and just days after we learned Mueller has subpoenaed a Cambridge Analytica executive—a certain MSNBC reporter is implying Mueller's report is already done and was submitted to the Department of Justice.

What Trump-Russia-related collusion is at the heart of my forthcoming book, PROOF OF CONSPIRACY (begun 5 months ago)? Today's breaking news in the New York Times: https://t.co/Vd4SX29E1N
So I'm just registering my sadness about that—because anyone who's read PROOF OF COLLUSION will confirm for you that they're not surprised by 90% of what others consider breaking news. So if you ever have a chance to recommend the book to someone, I hope you'll consider doing so.
My point is, PROOF OF COLLUSION has prepared tens of thousands of people for 2019's "breaking news." But hundreds of thousands never read the book because of bullshit hitpieces by people who had not done any of the work that I had done and didn't understand the Trump-Russia case.
Then I wrote a book, PROOF OF COLLUSION, which documented everything that I'd found in major-media reports from around the world and going back decades. It became a NYT bestseller, but still many wouldn't read it—because of those hitpieces that had been proven conclusively wrong.
The feed then went on to find every other connection between McFarlane, K.T. McFarland (Bud's mentee, Flynn's deputy), and Flynn—including employment histories, photos, and evidence of meetings. The whole time I was doing this, hitpieces were being written about how stupid I was.
If you've been along for the ride on this feed the last two years, you may recall that it was this feed that found photos and video from the 30 minutes before Trump's Mayflower speech and crowdsourced identifying VIP attendees as they walked in. McFarlane was the first I spotted.
The first hitpiece ever written about me, in DEADSPIN—a sports website—was focused on how ridiculous I was for writing such a lengthy treatise on a single VIP event at a Trump speech. The site's smugness at how obviously foolish I was—despite my bona fides—how does that look now?
Two years after I wrote a 100-tweet thread on the VIP-event attendees to Trump's first foreign policy speech (the Mayflower Hotel; April 27, 2016), with an emphasis on Bud McFarlane, here we are: McFarlane is at the center of breaking news on Trump-Saudi collusion.		*Two years*.
I'm writing an entire book centering around this topic right now, and it's amazing how much of this Trump-Saudi collusion we have known about and for how long. That it is *inextricably linked to Trump-Russia collusion*—and provably so—is what will really blow America's hair back. https://t.co/twWeZArWPt

The media *has* to register how abnormal, dangerous, and legitimately scary Trump's behavior is, and frankly having Chris Cilizza on to talk about it signals quite clearly that media is treating this as a "media" issue—how Trump frames the news—even though it's clearly much more.
So for the President of the U.S. to discuss *both* "treason" *and* a "coup" in reference to law enforcement officials discussing in a *responsible, thorough, and deliberative way* ongoing criminal and counterintelligence investigations, *and* accuse *SNL* of collusion—it's scary.
I have a) *consistently* said that nothing Trump has done could be charged as treason, and b) *never* referenced a "coup" except for one time: when a report came out in major media that top White House officials discussing "tackling" Trump if he sought a frivolous nuclear launch.
This isn't a game. When Trump publicly alleged "treason" and a "coup" at the FBI and DOJ, the correct response was a thorough vetting of the facts as I offered here on Twitter (with the expertise to speak credibly on the issue). I don't know what the heck Chris Cilizza was doing.
If Chris Cilizza can't run through a legal and investigative hypothetical to determine which investigative and NatSec options officials must talk through in an unexpected emergency, maybe he shouldn't be on television implicitly enabling Trump's charges of "treason" and a "coup."
I was sure that I'd turn on my TV and see CNN analysts making the same basic points about the McCabe-Rosenstein conversations that I have—that they were fully justified under the Constitution, SOPs, and the facts on the ground. Instead, I heard Chris Cilizza calling them "crazy."
7/ An innocent man would simply refer journalists to the statement made by DOJ and claim that any conversations of the sort McCabe describes rightfully led to nothing; he would then reassert his innocence. Instead Trump's words imagine federal death penalty-eligible prosecutions.
6/ The conversation between McCabe and Rosenstein—a necessary running through of potential options under historically idiosyncratic circumstances created by Trump—led nowhere. That Trump is raging against it two years on is a sign Trump is afraid of *what's coming*, not the past.
5/ *Every politician in America* should be rebuking the president tonight. If we lived in normal times, the statements that Trump has issued today—*taken by themselves*—would be deserving of Congressional censure as a direct assault on the rule of law and Trump's Oath of Office.
4/ It is unacceptable—and dangerous—for any sizable percentage of Americans to believe law enforcement officials acting appropriately in their official capacity are in fact staging a death penalty-eligible coup of our government. That the POTUS would say so makes it more obscene.
3/ What Trump said today is a clear assault on our rule of law—and even public safety—at a time when the walls are closing in on him in a major federal criminal investigation. At some point *someone* in DC has to register that Trump is creating a legitimately dangerous situation.
2/ Law enforcement officials across the country need to stand ready to report to media that, as I've itemized in a thread today and as all public reporting confirms, the actions of the then-Acting FBI Director and then-Acting AG (as to the Russia probe) were all 100% appropriate.
1/ False claims of Treason (a death penalty-eligible crime) and a coup of the U.S. government (an event that could lead to a Second Civil War) are imminent threats to public order, public safety, and our rule of law. Whether it's deranged ex-cop @dbongino or Trump doesn't matter.
This is really important: is everyone processing that, across two tweets today—considered official presidential statements—the President of the United States falsely accused the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice of secretly plotting a "treasonous" "coup"?

(@FrankFigliuzzi1): "...that McCabe may have lacked candor during an inquiry troubles me greatly, but the circumstances around his firing trouble me even more, and give rise to concern that the White House or AG put their thumbs on the scale of justice when it came to [McCabe]."
(@FrankFigliuzzi1): "In the hundreds of internal investigations I’ve handled, I never saw an FBI employee fired within 26 hours of retirement....employees in similar situations were typically allowed to stay on, sometimes under suspension, until retirement eligibility kicked in."
3/ Here's one of the threads I did a year ago on DiGenova's role in the "Trumplandia" conspiracy that—more provably than anything else—*proximately* made Trump the POTUS. The crimes were "smaller" than in the Russia case—but in their *effect*, far greater. https://t.co/5Kl5qCugbI
2/ Here are rogue FBI agents illegally speaking to conservative media days before an election with the assistance and facilitation of future Trump attorney Joe DiGenova. *This* is the FBI "Resistance" Trump spoke of with McCabe, and it's a *criminal* bloc. https://t.co/MSiZQ8jJfw
1/ Loretta Lynch: "It’s clear to me that there's a cadre of senior people in NYC who have a deep and visceral hatred of Secretary Clinton. It is deep." Rudy Giuliani: "There’s a kind of revolution going on inside the FBI." That's what Trump is speaking of. https://t.co/V2kulXO4aK
Clint, I think Trump knew *exactly* what he was talking about. See my comments on the pro-Trump "Resistance" bloc in the NYC office of the FBI during the Clinton probe and through Election Day, which provably worked in tandem (illegally) with Trump aides: https://t.co/TepzPLVAMG https://t.co/zU69Bbel0k
Some midday music (h/t @DocSpender): https://t.co/Qe1y5mx5wO
NOTE/ A clarification on Tweet #14: as McCabe explained to CBS, he didn't initiate the FBI probes, but rather used his authority as FBI Director post-Comey to check in on two *ongoing* ones—counterintelligence, begun summer 2016; obstruction, begun 2017—to ensure their viability.
PS/ McCabe ends his interview by telling CBS that he made *contemporaneous memoranda* of all his conversations with Trump—as investigators are trained to do—that will confirm everything he is saying now about what Trump said. Those memoranda are now in the custody of Bob Mueller.
100/ In summary, there's every reason to agree with McCabe when he says, "I was fired [a day before retirement, rather than being permitted to retire] because I opened an investigation into the president."		And every reason for us to fear Trump is a national security threat. /end https://t.co/JW7xuRad0O
99/ Of course, I don't need to relate for you all the evidence of Trump perjuring himself—including about Russia (below). By comparison, McCabe's statement that he had no *reason* to lie to the IG because he'd done nothing but protect the FBI is credible. https://t.co/tr1QZo2S6P
98/ McCabe's error—and it was one—was not admitting to the IG that he'd made the decision. He's alleged to have lied about it 3 times under oath—which is exactly one-tenth the number of times Trump admitted under oath—in a single civil deposition—to lying. https://t.co/rPWSrXZx1H
97/ This was in the context of the WSJ using an "unknown" FBI source to hurt Clinton while McCabe and Comey knew there was a pro-Trump bloc leaking to media for that very same purpose. For *his* part, McCabe connected to media openly—going through the FBI's Public Affairs office.
96/ As detailed by CBS News, what McCabe faced was bad also: he gave info to the WSJ to correct a false story at a time he was authorized to give info to the media. Trump's media allies were at the time trying to cast doubt on McCabe and Comey's objectivity for partisan purposes.
I agree with Joyce. This sort of thing can lead to someone being jailed pre-trial. https://t.co/uLrMQ5Zua3
95/ Per McCabe, Rosenstein's fear was Trump would fire him—leaving the DOJ with no Senate-confirmed leader—disabling the FBI's ongoing probe into Russian interference in the election and possible Trump campaign ties to it. *That's* the sort of effect Trump's malfeasance can have.
94/ We have lost all sense of what is normal in this country—even in our legal system and law enforcement. McCabe revealing to CBS that Rosenstein was afraid to do his duty and appoint a Special Counsel in the Trump-Russia matter because Trump might fire him is harrowing, indeed.
93/ There are lies a man tells that get him fired but do not permanently affect his credibility because of the circumstances under which they were told. And then there are cases where a man in that situation is in a public credibility battle with *the biggest liar in US history*.
92/ My point is to remind us how *spitefully and irrationally contemptuous* Trump was of McCabe *seven months after the election*—so you can imagine the fear McCabe had for how Trump or his minions might be manipulating media coverage of his wife in October 2016. Which they were.
91/ Ask yourself—red-blooded Republican men of America—what *you* would do if a man called your wife a "loser"... *over the phone so he didn't have to face you*... and did so merely out of spite, and not because she had ever done any harm or wrong whatsoever to him. Imagine that.
90/ McCabe's honest belief that he and his wife were being falsely oriented in the public as scoundrels—purely to benefit the political campaign of a single man—is bolstered and indeed *corroborated* by Trump calling McCabe's wife a "loser" in a May 2017 conversation with McCabe.
89/ The McCabe-Comey emails FOIAed by right-wing operation Judicial Watch indicate that McCabe absolutely believed that he and his wife were being used as political pawns in October 2016—which they definitely were. Without excusing his conduct, I'd note that that was its context.
88/ Andy McCabe could have been allowed to retire, given that (a) he was one day from retiring, and (b) he had had a long career with the FBI unblemished by misconduct, and (c) his actions arose in the context of an historic set of circumstances that are still being investigated.
87/ We previously saw, in the case of Peter Strzok, FBI officials, independent and nonpartisan, recommending a demotion and a 60-day suspension—with Trump's agents instead orchestrating a *firing*, just as Trump was publicly calling for. So Trump *is* influencing these decisions.
86/ That media didn't disregard Trump's wildly unsupported conspiracy theory about the McCabes out-of-hand, and allowed McCabe's firing—*clearly influenced* by Trump's public exhortation of his former campaign aide, Jeff Sessions, to do it—to affect his credibility is disgusting.
85/ As a Democratic candidate for state office in Virginia, Jill McCabe received money—as *many* such candidates did—from a PAC controlled by someone who is friends with the Clinton. She did not get special treatment—and in any case, McCabe WASN'T ON THE CLINTON CASE at the time.
84/ Just so, how McCabe describes Trump's execrable lies about McCabe and his wife is consistent with Trump's modus operandi. Trump says the Clintons gave Jill McCabe money while Andy McCabe was working on Clinton's case. In fact, EVERY PART OF THAT SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY UNTRUE.
83/ Indeed, McCabe's statement that Trump said "I believe Putin" when confronted with intel that North Korea is still a significant national security risk for America—dismissing what his own intelligence was telling him—is so consistent for Trump it bolsters McCabe's credibility.
82/ Those who say McCabe's statement on what Trump said in a security briefing isn't credible are—excuse me, I don't know how to say this politely—not living in the reality the rest of us are. Trump has *repeatedly* and *publicly* accepted the Kremlin line over U.S. intelligence.
81/ So now we come to the scariest part of the McCabe interview—a discussion of which will close this thread. McCabe reveals to CBS that Trump said he believed *Russian intelligence* on North Korea's nuclear capabilities over U.S. intelligence.		That's a national security threat.
80/ (The rest of the DOJ press release is just a statement of fact about the actions taken by Rosenstein and the basis for McCabe being terminated from the FBI.)
79/ And—follow me—once you've said that the potential national security threat is *not* so imminent the investigation can't finish, you're *also* saying that the appropriate remedy once it's finished, if malfeasance is found, is impeachment not the 25th. That's all DOJ is saying.
78/ So when DOJ says there's "no basis" to use the 25th, it's saying that until its Russia probe concludes, it is the finding of Main Justice (*and*, I would note, of *McCabe also*) that the threat from Trump is not *so* imminent that the investigation can't be allowed to finish.
77/ Please understand that, in short order, *all of the people involved in this conversation*, including *both McCabe and Rosenstein*, decided that the threat from Trump's collusive obstruction was *not so imminent* that *either* a wire *or* the 25th Amendment was yet necessary.
76/ When McCabe, Rosenstein, and others gamed out (a) a wire, and (b) the 25th Amendment—as part of a responsible professional discussion of what to do in a novel scenario—what they were trying to determine is *how imminent is the national security threat posed by the president*.
75/ Indeed, the biggest canard spread by those who support Trump but know *absolutely nothing about the criminal justice system* is that a criminal investigator announces publicly his/her findings in *mid-investigation*. That *doesn't happen* for about 100 very important reasons.
74/ Some of you will wonder about Rosenstein saying "there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment." This too is *technically true* even though McCabe is telling the truth also—i.e. there's no conflict here. Until the Russia probe is over, FBI/DOJ can't decide there's collusion.
73/ (The DOJ is *made up of* lawyers, so if you don't think DOJ's statement is making incredibly fine distinctions of that sort, I, uh... well, you don't know any lawyers.)
72/ Just so, McCabe doesn't say Rosenstein was "consider[ing] invoking the 25th Amendment" but that he, Rosenstein and others were gaming out a scenario as part of their responsible discussion of the situation. "What would happen if we did this" is different from "I may do this." https://t.co/97sdmF3Zyv
71/ Any person or institution that feels compelled to "forgive," condone, or enable malfeasance out of a fear that they might anger the wrongdoer is definitionally in an abusive relationship. I do think Trump's abuse of the DOJ and FBI has real effects and we're seeing them here.
70/ Trump has been so threatening to the *DOJ*—just as much as the FBI—that it's clear there's a legitimate fear within Justice that if it does anything whatsoever that makes it appear partisan, even if it's just *telling the truth*, it will anger Trump into some dramatic action.
69/ Just as Trump's malfeasance "forced" Comey to defend the FBI in a way that covered up how bad things really were there (re: the pro-Trump, Trump campaign-adjacent "Resistance" in the New York field office), here the DOJ throws McCabe under the bus largely to protect itself.
68/ For instance, look at the screenshot below.		McCabe *never* said that Rosenstein *ever* authorized a wiretap. And the DOJ *agrees* with him. But it does so in a way that *implies* that McCabe said that, thereby discrediting his account as "inaccurate and factually incorrect." https://t.co/ygzudHkJ1P
67/ At the 14:50 mark in the interview, CBS puts on screen the DOJ's response to what McCabe has detailed—a response that is unfortunate because it *seems* to discredit McCabe even as the *language of the statement itself* does very little to deny the truth of *anything* he says.
66/ I urge people to *re-watch* the first 14 minutes of the CBS interview with former Acting FBI Director Andy McCabe in light of all the background information I've explained here. (This thread will continue in the next tweet, though the video is below): https://t.co/lzsyKrin4I
65/ Presented with a novel scenario, a professional works through *all* of the possible responses to that scenario to ensure that prior prejudices—from prior events that may *seem* to be the same, but are clearly different—are not unduly weighted. It's the *right* way to proceed.
64/ McCabe's description of his meetings with Rosenstein and others after the Comey firing should comfort Americans. While they are described as intense and stressful, McCabe also describes them moving from topic to topic in the open, deliberative way that was proper at the time.
63/ So:		In a battle of credibility between MCCABE and TRUMP, MCCABE wins.	In a battle of credibility between ROSENSTEIN and TRUMP, ROSENSTEIN wins.	In a battle of credibility between TRUMP and ANYONE AT DOJ/FBI WHO WASN'T PART OF TRUMP'S PRE-ELECTION CONSPIRACY, the latter wins.
62/ Moreover, the leaks to the press McCabe is accused of *are so less serious in content, timing, and intent* from those Trump and his aides engaged in pre-election to win the general election that *anyone* who says you can't believe McCabe because of what he did is a partisan.
61/ There is *absolutely no reading* of the "specific, articulable facts" before the *lifelong Republicans* who discussed either the use of a wire or the 25th Amendment (some of which Republicans Trump had himself appointed) that made the conversation in *any way* inappropriate.
60/ Under the 25th, evidence a POTUS is an *immediate* danger to America is presented in a meeting of the president's Cabinet—as I said, it's like an impromptu impeachment before a *sympathetic jury* where the political process simply won't move quickly enough to protect America.
59/ The way the 25th—which removes a president from office, sometimes temporarily—is executed looks a little bit like a "mini-impeachment" that is conducted quickly and *by the president's own people*. That the president's own people do it is an implicit check on it being abused.
58/ Well, whereas "crime --&gt; impeachment"—and impeachment is a *political* process that moves *slowly*—"collusive crime --&gt; impeachment and national security fear," so the Constitution imagines a *jointly* political *and* emergency process that moves *quickly*—to protect America.
57/ If impeachment is the remedy for a criminal act, the Constitution suggests that the remedy for a criminal act underwritten by collusive intent *and therefore a national security concern* might be, under circumstances, the invocation of the 25th Amendment. So what is the 25th?
56/ Many crimes can be undergirded by a "collusive" intent—obstruction being one—which elevates the case from being "merely" a criminal case to one that is *both* a criminal and counterintelligence case. After Comey's firing, DOJ and FBI saw collusion and thus a security concern.
55/ This is why the nation's discussion of "collusion" has been such a *disaster*. *Everyone* agrees collusion "is not a crime" as such—but that *doesn't* mean that crimes can't be "collusive" in character, and that that collusive quality can't raise counterintelligence concerns.
54/ The language of the 25th impliedly imagines a scenario in which America is under *immediate* threat from a president's continued authority. That sort of threat would *not* exist for a "straight" impeachable act of obstruction, but *would* for a *collusive* act of obstruction.
53/ If FBI and DOJ only knew Trump had confessed—or was about to confess—to an impeachable offense, you'd expect them to try to send that information to the appropriate party for impeachment: Congress. But the national security element understandably extended their deliberations.
52/ This takes us to the "25th Amendment" portion of the interview, in which the question is implicitly asked, "What should FBI and DOJ do if they know that the president has confessed (or would readily confess) to an impeachable offense with a major national security component?"
51/ But those of us who've seen people *go to jail*—be torn from their families—over obstruction charges, and who understand that the history of enforcement of obstruction statutes is one in which such statutes are always taken seriously, refuse to *change history* to suit Trump.
50/ Now, instead of Americans working from that common assumption, we have attorneys like Alan Dershowitz and right-wing law enforcement analysts suddenly deciding that—for the first time in history—crimes like obstruction are just process crimes that don't really matter so much.
49/ And that's the thing we *have* to remember: as *lifelong Republicans*, both Rosenstein and McCabe were assuredly aware of the fact that *their party* had established in the late 1990s that the offense Trump was suspected of committing could remove him from office permanently.
48/ In retrospect, I wish the FBI and DOJ had indeed attempted a clandestine intercept of the president, as it would have forced both the media and many Americans—who can't understand criminal justice except in Hollywood tropes—that Trump has confessed to an impeachable offense.
47/ What this means is that the wire was only passed over due to matters of *investigative strategy and timing*—*not* whether there could at any point be a justification in taking that route. I expect all the people involved saw that Trump might confess *publicly*. And so he did.
46/ Note that, per McCabe, the FBI General Counsel said of the wire idea only that the investigation wasn't there "yet"—meaning there were other avenues to extract the same information from Trump as to his motives in firing Comey. And after the NBC interview, he was proven right.
45/ If Rod Rosenstein had worn a wire into the Oval Office and Trump had said to him there *exactly the same words* he said to NBC, many more Americans would understand his words were a confession. As it stands, legal and law enforcement professionals do, but many others do not.
44/ Let me put this clearly, speaking as a lawyer and former criminal investigator: the only reason we don't treat Trump's statement to NBC as a confession to a federal crime is that it occurred in public, and Americans wrongly assume evidence of a crime always arises in private.
43/ What is remarkable is that the evidence Rosenstein would have hoped to obtain by wearing a wire—an investigative method McCabe vetoed—was exactly the evidence that Trump would, soon after, give *publicly* to Lester Holt at NBC: Trump fired Comey over the Russia investigation.
42/ Certain of the facts McCabe, Rosenstein, and the remainder of Comey's team were working with in May 2017 were unknown to Americans until now—and some remain unknown. Trump's conversations with McCabe and Rosenstein are powerful new evidence that informed these men's actions.
41/ Conservatives in law enforcement can disagree with the reading of the "specific, articulable facts" top brass at DOJ/FBI *unanimously observed* in May 2017, but they also *must* concede that *if* a law enforcement official felt such facts existed, they had to act accordingly.
40/ So once the DOJ and FBI had an active counterintelligence investigation open involving the president, they were *obligated* to act *pursuant to SOP* on how such an investigation might be conducted *and* the speed and urgency with which all of its operations should be handled.
39/ If there's one thing *every person America must accept* as a condition of citizenship it's that our Constitution *is* the document from which our laws emanate. *Any* person in the Oval who's a foreign agent *must* be removed *immediately* by impeachment or the 25th Amendment.
38/ Anyone shocked by more than the historic novelty of the act Rosenstein described—who cannot see its investigative sense—simply does not understand or has refused to process how historically serious it is when the FBI and DOJ determine a POTUS could be a witting foreign agent.
37/ When Rosenstein "absolutely serious[ly]" volunteered, *twice*, to wear a wire into the Oval, it was shocking in its novelty but not its investigative sense. If indeed the FBI had an active counterintel probe open then, which it did, a wire would be *one* investigative method.
36/ The firing of Jim Comey, under the circumstances in which it occurred, was an *historically astounding event* whose factual contours suggested criminality *even to the man who helped Trump do it*, Rod Rosenstein. And the reason for that is Trump's public statements on Russia.
35/ McCabe describes "pressure," "chaos," "incredible turbulence," "stress", and "frenzy" at FBI/DOJ in the days after Comey's firing. This underscores that it was *nonpartisan* when legal/investigative professionals outside the FBI/DOJ—including on Twitter—responded as they did.
34/ That top officials at the FBI and DOJ were unanimous, it appears, in believing that both a criminal and counterintelligence investigation of Trump needed to be opened and maintained underscores that Trump's "Resistance" was located in New York, not at FBI HQ or Main Justice.
33/ What was portrayed on Twitter—and even in media—as conspiratorial thinking was in fact *precisely* the sort of professional-grade legal and investigative analysis that was happening within the FBI and DOJ in May 2017. I want to register that McCabe's interview confirms this.
32/ It's important for people to hear this: the way top FBI officials thought through whether Trump's words were evidence of a) a crime, and b) an illicit relationship with the Kremlin, is exactly the way legal and investigative professionals like me have discussed it on Twitter.
31/ An investigation can be initiated when law enforcement has "reasonable, articulable suspicion" that a crime may have been committed or be in the process of commission. That suspicion must be based on "specific facts." McCabe deliberately uses this language in speaking to CBS.
30/ That strategy—tweets, plus illicit contacts with law enforcement—had worked for Trump in getting Comey to reopen the Clinton case, so once he fired Comey Trump clearly expected that *the very same Resistance* could be exhorted to end the Russia investigation as McCabe feared.
29/ One reason Trump's statements about the FBI are evidence of a crime—by no means the only one—is that by speaking to McCabe of the "Resistance" and having aides make contact with rogue FBI agents, it's clear Trump wanted his words to foment rebellion (a "coup") inside the FBI.
28/ Back to Trump inviting Rosenstein to enter a conspiracy to obstruct justice. McCabe confirms what those of us with a criminal law, criminal justice, and criminal investigations background have said from the jump: Trump's tweets are *evidence of a crime* and *the FBI agrees*.
27/ It now seems self-apparent that Trump, Nunes, and others are alleging a "coup" within the FBI precisely *because* they're well aware that they participated in a "coup" within the FBI in October '16 that gave Trump the White House. Always accuse your enemies of what *you* did.
26/ Nunes refers to the same Resistance inin the FBI Trump did. Note: future Trump attorney DiGenova spoke to media about helping FBI "whistleblowers" get to Congress. Giuliani has described the Resistance as a sort of coup, ironic given Trump's allegations against the FBI now.
25/ Side note: I recommend the video below, in which Trump transition team member and Trump adviser Devin Nunes admits that "good FBI agents" in the NYC field office who he considered "whistleblowers" came to GOP members of Congress in September 2016. https://t.co/cqm2Qq4W6K
24/ To the extent "collusion" means anything outside antitrust law, we can say that a crime is "collusive" in its character if its commission raises counterintelligence fears that someone is wittingly acting as a foreign agent. McCabe is saying the FBI and DAG *feared collusion*.
23/ McCabe's interview—and his summary of Rosenstein's words the day after Comey was fired—underscores that Obstruction of Justice can indeed be seen by law enforcement as a *collusive crime* whose commission raises *counterintelligence* fears about a person's loyalty to America.
22/ It is shocking to learn that *within 24 hours* of Trump's firing of the FBI Director, it was the belief of the nation's Deputy AG that Trump had followed up on that act—which the FBI believed was evidence of obstruction—with a solicitation for the DAG to *enter a conspiracy*.
21/ We also learn via McCabe's interview that Trump tried to recruit Rosenstein into a *Russia-related obstruction conspiracy* by asking his Deputy AG to *fraudulently* put in a memo recommending Comey's firing "Russia" as a reason. Rosenstein knew this implicated him in a crime.
20/ Therefore, Trump's knowledge of a Resistance in the FBI is a significant area of criminal inquiry that Trump, Prince, DiGenova, and Giuliani must all be asked about. While illegal FBI leaks to media are Hatch Act violations, they're even more dire when they swing an election.
19/ So when McCabe talks about being worried that open FBI investigations might suddenly be "closed or vanish in the night without a trace," understand that he is *speaking of the pro-Trump "Resistance" in the FBI*. He obviously knows Trump himself can't close FBI investigations.
18/ But we now know something else: that when McCabe went into the Oval Office with all those—eminently reasonable and indeed wholly accurate—fears, the President of the United States *immediately* made reference to there being a "Resistance" within the FBI that Trump knew about.
17/ From those emails, it's clear that Andy McCabe (a) knew there were rogue pro-Trump agents in the FBI's NYC field office, (b) knew that those agents were illegally leaking to media, and (c) knew those leaks were putting pressure on the Bureau with respect to the Clinton case.
16/ I've written extensively about how a far-right organization's FOIA lawsuit (Judicial Watch) led to the revelation of emails between McCabe and Comey right before Comey was pressured to reopen the Clinton case in which McCabe and Comey discussed rogue agents leaking case info.
15/ "I was very concerned," McCabe says, "that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground—in indelible fashion—[so] that were I removed quickly or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace." Those words matter.
14/ McCabe told CBS that, after Comey's firing, he ordered two investigations of the president (as we now know, both a criminal and a counterintelligence investigation, each focused on Trump's relationship with Russia) for a very clear reason. Here is what McCabe said to CBS:
13/ That McCabe—a former Acting FBI Director—is willing to talk implicitly the "Resistance" in the FBI in a way Comey wouldn't, even if obliquely, is a major feature of his CBS interview. Particularly important is what McCabe says about the fears he had one Comey had been fired.
12/ Eventually, McCabe was fired the day before his retirement by the chair of Trump's pre-election National Security Advisory Committee, AG Sessions—a major witness in the Russia case—and the result is that McCabe does not have the same delicate view of the FBI that Comey does.
11/ Indeed, Trump, conservative commentators, and GOP Congressman are now calling for *massive investigations and criminal prosecutions* of FBI agents (in their view, including McCabe) who illegally leaked to media. Yet *that's exactly what Trump conspired to do in October 2016*.
10/ Not only were the illegal FBI leaks to media about the Clinton case in October 2016 a major part of the Bureau's reasoning in reopening the Clinton case—as multiple agents told the IG—but *Trump himself is now tweeting daily* about how serious illegal FBI leaks to media are.
9/ Comey has said he wants more than anything to protect the FBI's reputation. In pursuit of that goal, he has made a significant error: downplaying the significance of illegal FBI leaks to media to protect the FBI's reputation. Fortunately, the IG report set the record straight.
8/ America doesn't have to wonder how a GOP presidential candidate would "hear" about the *internal politics* of the FBI. I have linked repeatedly to articles and videos and interviews confirming DiGenova, Giuliani, and Prince were in touch with both Trump and these rogue agents.
7/ "I heard that you were part of the Resistance," President Trump said to Acting FBI Director Andy McCabe. Trump went on to explain that he knew of a bloc of FBI agents who "did not support Jim Comey...[who] didn't agree with him, and the decisions he made in the Clinton case."
6/ In the first minute of CBS's interview, McCabe reveals that Trump *was aware* of a bloc of FBI agents who'd been secretly working against Comey—we now know, by illegally leaking false information about the Clinton case to the media through Trump advisers—and said so to McCabe.
5/ This was critical because those illegal leaks were, per IG Horowitz, a major consideration in Comey reopening Clinton's case—a decision that, per polling data, gave Trump the presidential election. If Trump knew of these crimes, he was part of a conspiracy that made him POTUS.
4/ The question has always been how much Trump knew of what his advisers Giuliani, Prince, and DiGenova were doing to make contact with rogue FBI and NYPD officials, facilitate their illegal pre-election leaks to media, and use those leaks and a threat of more to blackmail Comey.
3/ I've written of how these rogue agents, in conjunction with rogue NYPD officers—including, it appears, the man running the Weiner investigation, who donated to Trump's campaign in October 2016—leaked false info and/or coordinated false leaks with top Trump adviser Erik Prince.
2/ I've written of how these rogue agents (a) used former Trump attorney—and current attorney for multiple Trump aides—Joe DiGenova to illegally leak to the media and threaten Comey via media, and (b) used Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani likewise to leak to media and threaten Comey.
1/ Working from interviews with Jim Comey and Inspector General Horowitz's first report on Comey—the second is still forthcoming—I've written extensively about how a faction of rogue FBI agents in the NYC field office threatened illegal leaks until Comey reopened Clinton's case.
(THREAD) What can we learn from CBS's interview with lifelong Republican and former FBI Acting Director Andy McCabe? A lot.

🇬🇧: 2015, 2016, 2017: Trump's Data Firm Cambridge Analytica (CA) Faces Collusion Allegations		Mueller is now focused on how internal Trump campaign data got into Kremlin agents' hands; whether Trump's data firm colluded with WikiLeaks; and whether Israeli agents colluded with CA.

Some Key American Trump-Russia Co-Conspirators/Enablers		🇺🇸: Bannon, Barrack, Clovis, Cohen, Conway, Corsi, Credico, Dearborn, Erickson (boyfriend of 🇷🇺: Butina), Gordon, Kushner, Mashburn, Mercer, Page, Prince, Sater, Schmitz, Sessions, Trump (Don), Trump (Eric), Trump (Ivanka).
Some Key Trump-Russia Foreign Agents		🇷🇺: Putin, Kilimnik, Deripaska, Rybolovlev, Agalarov, Papadopoulos*	🇺🇦: Manafort*	🇮🇱: Netanyahu, Zamel, Birnbaum*	🇸🇦: MbS, al-Assiri, Nader*	🇦🇪: MbZ, Dahlan, Nader*	🇹🇷: Kian, Alptekin, Flynn*	🇭🇺: Orban	🇪🇬: el-Sisi		*Legally (not nationality).
🇺🇸: 2019: Many Americans decide any news story too complex to easily summarize is a "conspiracy theory"		Trump's greatest aid in escaping responsibility for his illegal pre-election collusion, after media's inability to readily cover a story of this scope, is Americans' cynicism.
🇶🇦🇹🇷🇪🇬🇧🇭🇭🇺: 2015, 2016, 2017: Other nations offer Trumps covert aid		The Trump-Russia case is made too complex for easy reporting due to its runtime (decades) and international scope, including major roles for agents from Qatar, Turkey, Egypt, Bahrain, Hungary, and other nations.
📺: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019: News follows daily outrages only		Cable news has been so focused on Trump's daily outrages—partly for ratings, partly because it's structurally ill-equipped to report complex stories—leaving Americans with little sense of the big picture on collusion.
💻: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019: Citizens compile public evidence		Feeds like this one have compiled the evidence available in major-media reports from around the world—and going back years—to bring to Americans the content of the Mueller report in case the report never gets released.
🇺🇸: 2017 and 2018: Mueller indicts Russians and Trump campaign colluders		Mueller has used indictments to get six key Trump colluders to talk: Flynn; Manafort; Gates; Cohen; Papadopoulos; Stone. Some of these colluders have given Mueller evidence for future collusion indictments.
🇷🇺🇸🇦🇮🇱🇦🇪: 2015 and 2016: Multiple nations collude with Trump		Nations upon whom Trump has been financially dependent—with others assisting—illegally aid Trump pre-election in an effort to create an anti-Iranian Middle East security alliance that Russia will be willing to support.
🇺🇸: 2012: Trump decides to run for president		Mueller is now focused on when Trump decided to run for president. Why? Because it's clear Trump's attacks on Obama were part of an effort to signal publicly what Trump told many foreign powers privately—he would end Obama's policies.
🇮🇷: 2015: Iranian nuclear deal		Obama and a global alliance made a nuclear deal with Iran with the aim of bringing peace to the Middle East. Some Arab nations and Israel opposed the deal on military and geopolitical grounds and felt Trump, not Clinton, would abandon Obama's deal.
🇺🇦: 2014: Russian annexation of Crimea		Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine led Obama and a global alliance to level sanctions on Russia. Russia knew Clinton would maintain Obama's sanctions and Trump wouldn't. Sunni powers in the Gulf saw sanctions gave them an "in" with Russia.
(SPOILER) Trump's multinational pre-election collusion (chief co-conspirators: 🇷🇺 , 🇸🇦, 🇮🇱, 🇦🇪) has its origin in two international events, which together offer a key to understanding the Trump-Russia scandal:		🇺🇦: 2014: Russian annexation of Crimea	🇮🇷: 2015: Iranian nuclear deal

Would love to hear any high school/college basketball refs—former or current—weigh in on this: if the overhead horn blasts multiple times in the middle of a possession, play stops, right?

NOTE/ Many have good reasons for locking their DMs or not being their true selves online; I know firsthand what perpetual public/private Twitter abuse looks, feels, and sounds like. My comments on that score were really directed to journalists (and in some rare cases, activists).
@alilynnet ...that I don't understand when high-follower Twitter accounts who would benefit from generative public input because the account is run by (e.g.) a journalist keep their Twitter DMs locked. I *fully* understand why many, many millions of others do. My apologies for misspeaking.
@alilynnet Hi AliLynne, I hear what you're saying.		I should say that I receive antisemitic death threats and harassment regularly. I'm not comparing that to anyone else's experience, I'm just saying that I know what perpetual Twitter abuse looks like. *That said*, I meant to say...{cont.}
CORRECTION/ Case in point! Tweet #16 should say, "...even when social media *wants* one *not* to be."
PS/ I almost forgot! I learned to admit mistakes. No one is perfect—we're all doing the best we can. I'm working every weekend to try to stay fully informed on this globe-spanning story for the book and the feed, but I'm sure I'll sometimes mess up. I'll acknowledge it when I do.
25/ Thanks to the 600K of you who've been here on this crazy ride—and that even includes the occasional haters, libelers, and condescending folks in the law, media or otherwise whose experience, knowledge and credentials I'd be proud to stack mine against. You too have taught me.
24/ Finally, I've learned social media makes us unhappy; it's impossible to "be yourself" online (the "self" doesn't translate); and no one's really a human being to anyone else on the internet, so we might as well explore virtual spaces with courage—even some generative abandon.
23/ There's a lot of work that can be done in synthesizing what's good in U.S. media rather than merely cantankerously attacking what's bad. While I criticize media regularly, anyone who reads this feed also knows that my threads honor and rely upon the best reporting I can find.
22/ But with this, I've learned that some really incredible reporting is being done—and that new media journalism, particularly a subgenre I'm interested in called "curatorial journalism," can help rescue obscure, foreign, or too-complex reporting from falling through the cracks.
21/ We all see the problems—an alternating terror of being wrong and flippancy toward exactness; an unwillingness to research, acknowledge or incorporate the full scope of work done on the topic you're reporting; hostility to those outside institutions—and they're not going away.
20/ A fifth thing I've learned is that major media is deeply broken—even though it's filled with some amazingly dedicated and talented public servants—and that as a whole our media ecosystem is in no mood whatsoever to be judged, critiqued, or in any way whatsoever improved upon.
19/ I'm proud of the way my being an educator, editor, and post-internet theorist is manifested in my social media feed. I've no difficulty seeing how my interdisciplinary background is an asset—even if it makes me easy to misread or ridicule. (Bio below.) https://t.co/FdF29Ze5j5
18/ People who don't understand how public communicators learn their skills make hay of me having published books of poetry—though if there's one skill-set that *every tweet I've ever written* made *direct* use of, it's understanding language from the viewpoint of a working poet.
17/ By the same token, that I was a federal criminal investigator on the defense side means nothing to those who've investigated for federal law enforcement; that I was a state-level public defender who saw our justice system in a "high-traffic" way is icky to federal attorneys.
16/ A fourth thing I've learned is one shouldn't be ashamed of being interdisciplinary—even when social media *wants* one to be. For instance, practicing attorneys shame me for being an attorney who used to practice but now teaches—but teaching enables me to be the tweeter I am.
15/ For instance, I've worked many Obstruction, Witness Tampering and Perjury cases, so I know the sort of evidence that's used daily to convict average Americans for these offenses. I'm not going to pretend that these cases are *so hard to prove* when they're not—for you and me.
14/ I admit that I'm someone who speaks from his ideals—meaning that if I know Trump is supposed to be treated the same way you or I would be in a given situation, I'm not going to cynically recite how he is *likely* to abuse the system but to insist on it being honored, instead.
13/ Sometimes that puts me a little at odds with the most common sort of analyst we have—former or current federal prosecutors, who are well-attuned to how white-collar cases prosecuting the wealthy and powerful are *generally* handled. That's different from how they *should* be.
12/ What that means is that I've tried to approach this case from the presumption that Trump should be treated no differently than you or me under the law—except in those rare instances the law or Constitution explicitly gives him distinct powers, privileges and responsibilities.
11/ And that's the third thing I've learned: it's important to tweet your values. As a former public defender, my chief value as an officer of the court and someone who took an oath to uphold the Constitution is that all people—rich or poor—deserve equal treatment under the law.
10/ By the same token, sometimes you encounter a smart, talented, and articulate analyst who has no point of view or ethos when it comes to the present national emergency—they're looking to offer opinions that will offend or disturb no one and largely repeat what we already know.
9/ Sometimes it's hard to watch TV and see analysts be interviewed who are smart and talented but have done virtually no off-air research into the Trump-Russia scandal—and that happens more than you'd think. Many of these analysts know only the bare basics of this historic story.
8/ I think the reality is that we should try to be ourselves on Twitter, and, when and as we can be, gregarious and courageous in how we communicate online. I am a passionate, emotional, and counter-institutional person by nature, and I'm glad readers gave me the room to be that.
7/ Many (even most) of those well-credentialed analysts were smart, talented people. They were also, many of them, cautious by temperament—they wanted to wait until scores of major media personalities had told them the Russia story was important before they stuck their necks out.
6/ The second thing I've learned is that most of the hard work happens off Twitter. When the Trump-Russia story finally took off in major media—six or seven months after many of us began focusing on it—a gaggle of well-credentialed analysts appeared who'd long ignored the story.
5/ For that reason, I don't really understand Twitter feeds with closed private messages. It's worth suffering through occasional threats, "sexy bot" solicitations, and the occasional off-target "lead" to get assistance from one's readers in finding the news that really matters.
4/ So a big part of this first element of my ethos on Twitter is: listen to and respect your readers, because if you've done your very best to create a well-informed, highly engaged, fact-based feed, chances are that you have a well-informed, highly engaged, fact-based audience.
3/ Far from what some might have expected, I don't regularly have readers publicly or privately trying to sell me on conspiracy theories. In fact, the bulk of the link-oriented public *and* private feedback on this feed has sought to point me toward valuable major-media reports.
2/ Those who think Twitter readers don't have the patience for complex stories or arguments, or don't read widely across platforms and outlets, or are looking for simple "hot takes" are just wrong. There will always be some of that, but I've found readers to be incredibly astute.
1/ First and most importantly, I've learned how very grateful and humbled one should be to have engaged, informed, intelligent readers. Because my DMs are open and have always been open—another thing I've learned is critical—I hear from many of you privately as well as publicly.
(THREAD) As this feed hits 600K followers, I've had cause to reflect on the ethos—philosophy—behind the work I've tried to do here as a lawyer, former criminal investigator, educator, author and curatorial journalist. I hope you'll read on if you're interested in what I've found.

NOTE4/ The reason Ken doesn't define "direct evidence" with clarity is that it would gut his story. Imagine if he'd written, "Burr Says Senate Has No Collusion Confession or Contract." Would anyone have been surprised or cared? (Even though we *do* have confessions?) No. So—this.
NOTE3/ When Ken defines "direct evidence" as "emails, text messages or the testimony of co-conspirators," and then says *Burr* says "there's no direct evidence of collusion," he makes it sound like the Senate has no "emails, messages, or testimony" from potential co-conspirators.
NOTE2/ So when Ken summarizes Burr as saying "no direct evidence of collusion," Ken is claiming that *Burr* says there is no evidence that directly proves a collusive conspiracy (e.g. a confession, an eyewitness accusing someone of a crime, or a photo of a crime being committed).
NOTE/ This thread is about "direct evidence [of a collusive crime]"—what Ken, Burr, and I are all discussing. Obviously "direct evidence" could also relate to a relevant fact that's not the fact of a crime itself (e.g., a photo of two men meeting may be direct evidence they met).

RT @SethAbramson: Goodnight, all. https://t.co/GdHHUyhhhG
5/ Ken's vague tweet misdefining "direct evidence" actually *worsens* his erroneous summary of Burr's interview with CBS by *broadening significantly* the category of what Burr says (already incorrectly!) the Senate Intel Committee *doesn't* have. Sheesh, Ken! OK—now to bed. /end
4/ This is likely why Sen. Mark Warner—Burr's Democratic counterpart—had to publicly disagree with Burr's comment about "direct evidence": because the Senate *does* have direct evidence of collusion, which I know because the *public* does and the Senate has what we have and more.
3/ In contrast, if the Senate had evidence Manafort emailed Kilimnik to offer the Kremlin agent proprietary campaign polling data after he knew the Kremlin was waging a propaganda war, *that* would be direct evidence of aiding and abetting. An offer of private briefings—the same.
2/ The *overwhelming majority" of "emails, texts, or testimony" from co-conspirators in any conspiracy case is what's called *circumstantial evidence*—which Burr's full interview *acknowledges exists*. So, for instance, Manafort agreeing to meet Kilimnik is not "direct evidence."
1/ So Ken is now saying *Burr* says the Senate has no "emails, texts, or testimony" suggesting collusion. But even had Ken correctly interpreted the sum of Burr's remarks, we would say Burr says there's no *confession or eyewitness accusation* in email, text, or testimonial form.
This is *not* what "direct evidence" is. An email, text or testimony excerpt is "direct evidence" *only* if it directly supports or refutes the matter in dispute (e.g., if the defendant committed the crime charged). This wildly broad definition makes Ken's misreporting *worse*. https://t.co/3ObiitT3bK

@calebj15 @KenDilanianNBC Probably true, but my concern is that Ken has followed up that report with a series of additional reports that seem equally dodgy, so pointing out that we should be suspicious of his sources now has more value then it will in several months, when he's filed many more such reports
@WatchdogDiva @KenDilanianNBC Neither do I (that's my point) 😄
@bourst @KenDilanianNBC No, he hasn't
@calebj15 @KenDilanianNBC Incidentally, if that's what you're saying, i.e. that this scoop was fraudulent from the get-go because of how it was written and what it contained and how it was then framed and distributed for viewers, I'm totally here for that		In fact I observed it at the time
@calebj15 @KenDilanianNBC Got it—so what you're *saying* is Ken and NBC treated this as a *major* scoop/exclusive for days, but in fact the *content* of the report actually meant *nothing at all*, as *this June* is "as soon as February," and 2020 is "as soon as February," and 2065 is "as soon as February"

@NancyDH01 I know! I was going to count that one but then I thought, no, it was sarcasm. As was... most of the video, apparently, on reflection. She is really angry and most of it comes out as sarcasm.
PS/ She just called "Ilhan Omar" "this one here" and pretended she couldn't pronounce *her* name, either. I get nervous that people can be this proudly racist and have 100,000+ followers on YouTube. It's the Trump era—I shouldn't be surprised—but somehow, I always am. #optimist
35/ Maybe everyone in America should watch this? 48. I'm coming around to that view, as this is some bananas right here. She just said "proverbial"—how is "incumbent" elitist but not "proverbial"? 49. OK. 50. Done. Last time I try this experiment. I only got to 50—her fault. /end
34/ ..."moving right along." Is this Beckettesque? I don't even know what this "Tracy Beanz" video is about anymore. What are we "moving right along" to, Tracy? An Existentialist cloud? Purgatory? I think this feels like purgatory. She's ranting about "there are two genders"?
33/ 47. I think it's racist to pretend not to be able to pronounce an African-American politician's name you can easily pronounce? Yes—it's racist. Not a lie per se, but I guess pretending not to be racist when you're racist is a lie. 48. We're 18 minutes in and she just said...
32/ 46. She says that she has a lot of "liberal friends" who she "put her arm around" and "took them on a journey [to enlightenment]. I can't imagine a progressive hanging out with this person. Can you? Willingly? Let alone being magically convinced to a new worldview by... this?
31/ 44. I'm kind of annoyed, actually, that I can't get to 100 because this video wasn't as advertised. 45. She pretends she doesn't know how to pronounce Kamala Harris's name—she knows just fine. She's just being a jerk (liar)—it's the sort of childish stuff Rush Limbaugh does.
30/ I should've realized how much of this video billed as being about me would be an embarrassing juvenile rant. I tried to listen to a Dan Bongino show "about me," but he just yelled my name a few times and then tried to sell sanitary napkins or something. Not sure—it was an ad.
29/ 42. "Infanticide" is a legal term—so pro-choice voters aren't "OK with infanticide" (which is illegal), they're "OK" (or something similar) with a legal medical procedure. 43. The Democratic platform isn't "socialism" if you actually know what socialism is, which she doesn't.
28/ 39. No one is, uh... "running on banning cow farts and stopping planes." 40. Nothing is "over" and no one has "lost" when the Senate says it has "10 years" of investigation left and we have no timeline for a Mueller report. 41/ Kamala Harris didn't lie about smoking weed.
27/ 38. Wow... no one who's been stalking me and my feed for over a year would scream "Collusion with who!" when I write that there is proof of collusion. Every reader of my feed knows who and what I'm talking about. If she doesn't, there's a reading *and* credibility issue here.
26/ OK, I'm getting worried about getting to 100 lies. I didn't realize how much sighing she does, and pregnant pauses intended to suggest thoughtfulness, and fake voices that deliberately slow things down (and re-read things the viewer can already see) to fluff the video length.
25/ 37. I don't think "I'm better than everybody" because I wrote a Trump-Russia book and much of a second one. I *do* think I know more about the Trump-Russia case—because I wrote a Trump-Russia book and much of a second one—than someone who can't lay out *specific* critiques.
24/ Again, this person has 100,000+ YouTube followers. Her videos get tens of thousands of views. People watch this person's videos—which actually have no content, just emotion and fake voices—instead of watching the news. Is it wrong to do one takedown in four years on Twitter?
23/ ...Horowitz said it's going to be supplemented (as to Giuliani and illegal FBI leaks). Any claim there was a "final conclusion" is false. 36. When a proven liar says "truth is not a consideration for [other] people anymore" it counts as a lie; it excludes the self improperly.
22/ 34. She says an embedded thread of mine "lies to your face" but won't read/discuss it—won't even click on it—which I think is lie-adjacent or worse because she won't or can't explain her provocative claim. 35. It's a lie to say the NYE IG report had "no wrongdoing" because...
21/ 32. Her saying she's going to "report" the second tweet in my thread counts as a lie because either (a) she's not going to, or (b) her proposed "report" is a lie because the tweet doesn't violate any ToS. 33. No, I wrote a book on this, I don't think "Tracy Beanz" knows more.
20/ 31. Oddly, I think it's *also* false to say "Mueller has *tons* of power"—as it deliberately implies there's no check on him. His appointment letter is a check; the update to the letter is a check; needing DOJ approval for indictments and funds is a check; juries are a check.
19/ 29. Anyone can *call* my use of asterisks (not "stars") elitist, but it's a common form of bolding on platforms without that function—it has nothing to do with education or erudition. 30. "The Senate has no power whatsoever"—see my prior correction of this *ridiculous* claim.
18/ 27. Lying is indeed a right/wrong, not "partisan" thing, but as this person is lying about me to gain a partisan audience (and cash), it does seem pretty partisan. 28. The idea that only "ridiculously intelligent people" are comfortable with the word "incumbent" is hilarious.
17/ 25. I get "properly criticized" (improperly, too) often. The idea I avoid criticism is, uh... pretty "meta-" given the forum—the video—in which it's being claimed. 26. There was indeed a pre-election Zamel media campaign for Trump—Zamel admitted it in the *story I linked to*.
16/ 24. Zamel's proposed media campaign was illegal because it would have involved foreign nationals (thus, foreign in-kind donations). This person gets livid at the word "illegal"... but somehow never gets around to explaining why that word is wrong. (She has no legal training.)
15/ Look—everyone, I think, has to do this one time: show how easy it is to discredit your haters. I chose 100 as a *random number of lies* to try to find. I assume at least a few folks are at least *curious* (even if morbidly so) to see if I can make it. Spoiler: I probably can.
14/ 21. I tried murder cases in my 20s—you can't do that if you "get emotional" under pressure. I'm not your snowflake, Tracy. 22. I'm not sad at all—I'm determined. 23. Trump isn't "telling the truth" to say there's "no evidence" of collusion—even Burr said there was *evidence*.
13/ 19. "The media as a whole creates domestic disinformation on a daily basis" is such a broad and fabulous lie as to be meaningless. 20. There is no new "implosion" on "the left"; there has been real anger about this lawless man since he called Mexicans rapists in June of 2015.
12/ I know this is ridiculous, but I'm treating it like an AMA where there's one questioner and she knows nothing of the law, Trump-Russia, or me and my feed—despite following it for years. The broader point is important—if you engage these people their lies fall apart instantly.
11/ 18. Congressional committees have much power: they can find people in contempt, refer people for prosecution, hold hearings where lies are felonies; subpoena documents and people; get sworn testimony that contradicts other testimony (illuminating new felonies); and on and on.
10/ 16. I haven't alleged a "grand conspiracy" but a "grand bargain" with a small number of conspirators and I've explained the difference repeatedly on my feed (which she avidly reads). 17. I didn't "chastise NBC"; I focused quite clearly on Ken Dilanian, a single journo there.
9/ 15. She hasn't "been thinking" about how I'll react if there's "no collusion" because she reads my feed and I've repeatedly said there that if there's "no collusion" (which would be impossible given what we already know) it'd be a *great day for America* and I'd be *thrilled*.
8/ 13. The "Senate" has not "come out and said there's no evidence of Russian collusion." 14. Mueller *already charged* Trump's Campaign Manager with colluding with a Russian agent in an act of Obstruction, so he would/could hardly "come out and say there's no Russian collusion."
7/ 10. Dems aren't cherrypicking transcripts—they're releasing full ones. 11. Anyone can watch my YouTube interviews—;my steady temperament/unemotional voice are no mystery and only a demagogue pretends otherwise. 12. I never have/never would call media "the enemy of the people."
6/ 7 (cont.) ...there's no proof of collusion; she's attributing a Burr quote to journalists. 8. I've in no sense moved away from Trump-Saudi collusion; I'm writing a book on it right now. 9. The people she claims say Congressional committees have no power have never said that.
5/ 5. The Mueller probe has turned a profit. 6. 199 indictments isn't "nothing." 6. I didn't just "turn to Israel"; anyone can use Twitter's search function to see how long I've been discussing Trump-Israeli collusion. 7. The reporters for NBC and CBS did not themselves say...
4/ 1. I didn't "put a narrative out there"—my sources are major media and the narrative is theirs. 2. I'm not teaching a course on Russian collusion and never have and never would. 3. I've explicitly said Trump isn't guilty of treason. 4. The Mueller probe hasn't gone on "years."
3/ I'm going to try to find these 100 lies in real time—like, *fast*—to show how easy it is and how little time this video or *any video like it* is deserving of (and remember the stakes: 100,000+ people subscribe to this liar on YouTube). Let's move fast and have some fun here.
2/ I want media to see how badly misinformed the Right has become about the Mueller probe and take at least a little responsibility for it—as people like "Tracey Beanz" do claim to read major media. I also want to show how when major-media misreports, these people are emboldened.
1/ I don't care about this person; I assume her name is fake and for the purposes of this real-time test I watched 60 seconds of this video to gauge if a random big number I came up with (100) was a reasonable test of how many lies she tells. The purpose of this exercise is this:
(THREAD) This person has hate-read my feed via a dummy account for a year-plus. She has 100,000 YouTube followers and uses my name to raise cash. Real-time test: to see if I can find 100 lies in her 23-minute video to make a point about far-right grifters. https://t.co/A8UCsVFwpZ

NOTE3/ In other words, I've put in the work, and I have a lifetime in public service to confirm that when I try to be helpful to my community it's because I believe that's important. My work—and that of the scores of other hardworking Trump-Russia analysts—will soon be validated.
NOTE2/ Any time one of these Trump dead-enders wants to put their credentials against mine in terms of having the relevant education, knowledge, experience, training, and other bona fides (e.g., a book on this subject) to speak with authority on this topic, they should feel free.
NOTE/ The people who have the background to do this research (whether a legal, investigative, Russian Studies, financial crimes, or any other background) are not sweating what all these far-right morons are saying. This *happened*—it's the waiting for consequences that's painful.
PS/ I didn't want to be involved in researching all this. I have other things to do. But I have a skillset—as an author, educator, attorney, former investigator and social media theorist—that allows me to be helpful in educating the public on this. My bio: https://t.co/FdF29Ze5j5
10/ All of that's ~2% of the evidence I have in Proof of Collusion and its sequel Proof of Conspiracy. Maybe less. Yet it underscores that when Swalwell talks about circumstantial evidence, he's right to focus us on that *and* keep wide open the existence of direct evidence, too.
9/ That's right, Zamel and Cambridge Analytica entered into a deal and *we've seen it*. Nader is confirmed to have paid Zamel $2 million. Zamel is confirmed to have said he did it. Zamel is confirmed to have asked the Saudis/UAE to pay for it. And Nader confirms that they did so.
8/ These entwined 2016 events confirm that the Saudis and the UAE did indeed, as Zamel requested of their emissary Nader, fund a disinformation campaign that Zamel then delivered in conjunction with the Kremlin, an Israeli business intelligence company, and *Cambridge Analytica*.
7/ Around these events we have confirmed (a) secret (b) lied-about (c) related meetings involving Kushner, Bannon, Prince, Flynn, Jr., Nader, the Crown Prince of the UAE, the head of a Saudi assassination program, and the general charged with running point on Khashoggi's murder.
6/ So we have Netanyahu's agent Birnbaum; Trump's agents Manafort/Gates; Deripaska's agents Zamel/Kilimnik; and, to top it off, apparent secret meetings—two—between Trump himself and Zamel's other former boss (Rybolovlev) in the 10 days pre-election. All via major media reports.
5/ In January 2018, Trump told friends by phone, per NBC, that *Manafort was the guy* who could bring him (Trump) down if he "flipped" on him, which definitionally means Trump was telling friends that Manafort could incriminate him. Well, Manafort could—and we know *exactly* how.
4/ George Birnbaum, the man who introduced Zamel (who worked for Kremlin-linked oligarchs Rybolovlev and Deripaska) to Manafort's deputy Gates, was *also* the boss of the man (Tony Fabrizio) whose polling Manafort gave to Deripaska's agent Kilimnik. This is how conspiracy works.
3/ Longtime Trump-Saudi intermediary George Nader—who partnered with Zamel during the campaign, then *paid him* after (following Zamel asking Nader to get his Saudi/UAE friends to fund pre-election collusion)—has told Mueller Trump aides lied about related meetings. A confession.
2/ THE NEW YORKER reports Israeli Joel Zamel, introduced to Team Trump by Netanyahu's longtime Chief of Staff, not only offered the Trumps collusive pre-election help on August 2, 2016—to which offer Jr. said *yes*—post-election he said the collusion happened. Another confession.
1/ I'd add to this that, per POLITICO, Kremlin agent Konstantin Kilimnik told political operatives in Europe that his negotiations with the Trump team got the RNC platform changed after (per Trump aides) Trump directed that it be changed. That's a confession regarding collusion.
This. A hundred times this. We're in a moment when our politicians and our media need to be *educators* as well as advocates.

Thank you for your service, Senator. 🇺🇸 https://t.co/N3hbBZnB5e
@AddieWoolf @Olivia_Gazis Hed, no; lede, yes; framing in the write-up, yes; TV interview, yes. I also think that with a story of this national and even global significance an editor would likely receive input from the journo on the hed (and then do, as editors often will, what they like).
Whereas @KenDilanianNBC has long been—not due to bad faith per se but infirmities in sourcing, framing and contextualizing, and recalcitrance in the face of error—a misinformer on Trump-Russia, @Olivia_Gazis' good interview was destroyed by mistakes in post. Please don't bug her.
I'd like to clarify one thing: I thought @Olivia_Gazis did astonishingly good work on the *interview itself*. Where things fell apart was the hed, lede, write-up—which failed to explain or contextualize key terms/events—and attendant TV interview. But the original work was great.
@Olivia_Gazis @Cathdud @KenDilanianNBC Olivia, as I mentioned elsewhere, besides the hed/lede CBS chose being contradicted by what Burr spent the rest of hour saying, what scores of folks wrote me about and asked me to explain was this interview with you, whose content doesn't match your story. https://t.co/XtHOav0ZJz
Not just ally—longtime friend, campaign adviser, Manafort (and Gates and Flynn) business associate, and chairman of Trump's inaugural committee. Barrack—along with ten to twelve others—is as close to a definitive Trumpworld source as you can get.		And he says something like this. https://t.co/LwqNp02k5m
3/ If you want to know the truth of what's *actually* happening with the Trump-Russia investigation, here's a place to start: https://t.co/KNdJJUaFPX
2/ Even if you correct your reports, I'm not sure I can forgive the veritable *torrent* of slack-jawed morons you've unleashed who literally know nothing about the Trump-Russia investigation but your misleading headlines and are now insufferably, publicly, and *wrongly* gloating.
1/ It's now incumbent upon you, @KenDilanianNBC and @Olivia_Gazis, to correct your reports by contextualizing the Burr quote within his interview—which contradicts it—and explaining what direct evidence means, how evidence works, and the difference between the Senate and Mueller.
You did this, @KenDilanianNBC and @Olivia_Gazis.		Singlehandedly.		You misreported the Burr interview by using a non-representative pull-quote contradicted by the rest of the interview and by failing to explain how evidence works. In so doing, you created domestic disinformation. https://t.co/rEt4QYHrz0

10/ My point: if you were disheartened by one CBS and one NBC article that misrepresented an hour-long Richard Burr interview with a single pull-quote—which articles have already started coming apart—please don't be. Collusion and conspiracy occurred and the truth is coming. /end
9/ It's incredible that on the same day a Pulitzer Prize winner—who unfortunately wrote his article as a feature-length piece rather than a news report, so it has an interminable soft lede and buried actual lede—closes the circle on collusion, we get these silly NBC/CBS reports.
8/ Two of the confessions we have are now publicly reported: Zamel (Israel) and Kilimnick (Russia). Nader (Saudi Arabia, UAE) is a Mueller cooperator and has given his confession, so far as we know, in private. And the 25 to 30 key events in the timeline have all been reported.
7/ ...writing a book's necessary—and why I'm doing it. I can tweet that we now have a completed timeline—offer, acceptance, confession—for Trump-Russia collusion, but nobody listens until it's put between two covers. On TV it can't be reduced to a soundbite so it can't translate.
6/ The problem for media—and for Trump-Russia researchers—is that the events confirming "Trump-Russia Plus" collusion (Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE) are scattered across 50 major-media articles. Someone has to synthesize them and then be paid attention to in doing so. That's why...
5/ What's frustrating: those who've done the research *also* know the research isn't hidden or secret—rather, it's all in major media reports from around the world (including Israel). So as US media implies falsely that everything's over, major-media reporting confirms collusion.
4/ Those of us who've done a dive into the Israeli piece—in my case, for a book—know that Trump will be found to have illegally colluded pre-election with Russia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE (at least). It's not in doubt anymore—the question is the timing of the disclosure.
3/ Collusion is confirmed, and anyone who has been tracking a six-person—Trump, Rybolovlev, Manafort, Deripaska, Zamel, Nader—timeline knows it. None of us are sweating the misreporting by NBC and CBS; it's an annoyance only. There are some of us who know where Mueller is headed.
2/ ...the publication of Ronan Farrow's article—which also has Zamel post-election bragging about helping Trump gets elected—has just closed the circle on Trump-Russia collusion with the assistance of at least two Gulf States. We have the ask, the acceptance, and the confession.
1/ We now know Zamel and his representatives have repeatedly lied about who he met with and when. We know he formerly was employed by Oleg Deripaska and Dmitry Rybolovlev—two Russian oligarchs connected to Paul Manafort and Donald Trump respectively. I guess what I'm saying is...
In 2018 my PROOF OF CONSPIRACY proposal focused on Israeli Joel Zamel not only successfully pitching the Trumps on an illegal media campaign pre-election and Saudi Arabia/UAE—via George Nader—funding it, but Russia being involved.

ATTENTION US MEDIA: Donald Trump has 20 unresolved allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault and has faced repeated credible allegations of racism, misogyny, and antisemitism. Enjoy your day hammering Elizabeth Warren for a gaffe and Kamala Harris for having smoked pot.
2/ I don't care how much pot Kamala smoked or if she liked Snoop, I mean *Jesus*. She's gotten right on legalization. Warren made a gaffe and apologized—so *let it go already*. Media is fueling this right-wing double-standard that gives Trump a pass on everything and no one else.
1/ And the best part of all? American media, bewildered by Trump's twisting of political culture, will not just permit but *enable* Republicans' double-standard for candidate conduct—letting Trump's outrages stand only lightly commented on while Dems must campaign like it's 2007.
GOP attacks on Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and other Democratic candidates confirm something we all knew: Republicans are just going to *pretend that Donald Trump never happened* and that the standards for mistakes, hypocrisy, bad behavior, gaffes, and so on haven't changed.

2/ Just one left for sale at the new price, and by a secondary Amazon dealer.
1/ For all that Proof of Collusion was a New York Times bestseller and has been widely read around the world, it's never sold out at Amazon, to my knowledge. We're now minutes from that happening. Americans realize 2019 will be a historic year in the biggest scandal of our lives.
@monicamiller202 Sorry, but it is *not* a bit player. I've written a book on the subject and I'm halfway through a second one and nothing could be further from the truth, I'm afraid. Israel will be central to this story, as will 7 or 8 other countries, including the ones you mentioned.
3/ And here's the grotesque part: Trump and Netanyahu have been in bed for at least 2 years with some of the most harrowing anti-Semitic political campaigns around the world you could imagine. So Trump would like some protection against blowback for when all that is exposed, too.
2/ He also wants American Jews to rally around him no matter what comes out about him working with the Saudis and the Emiratis and working with the Israelis in a way that embarasses Israel and calls into question both his values (of which there are none) and Netanyahu's (ditto).
1/ Trump's goal here is to re-position himself by saying I am pro-Israel and have always been pro-Israel and anything I did before the election with the Israelis was merely consistent with being pro-Israel and everyone else should be pro-Israel and *stop looking at my collusion*.
Make no mistake—major-media news reports confirm Mueller's probe is turning toward a finding of Trump campaign collusion with Israeli business intel companies working in conjunction with Netanyahu's government, so Trump is suddenly playing the pro-Israel card quite strategically. https://t.co/IDKb81AiPO
@i_am_noam @CBSNews I know. That interview she did on-air was one of the most surreal things I have seen in news in a long time, as she said all sorts of things that appeared nowhere in her report or indeed contradicted what she had reported.
1/ Inasmuch as what Burr finally said is the Senate didn't expect to see a confession and didn't get one, and didn't expect to see a contract for a conspiracy and didn't get one, but did see evidence of collusion and doesn't know what Mueller has, Warner has no cause to disagree.
I actually don't think Senator Warner has as much complaint with what Burr said as people would presume. I think that what Burr said was mischaracterized and misreported and so poorly explained by journalists that Warner has to register some sort of disagreement prophylactically. https://t.co/r2SxGwVtRp

2/ None of this means that we can't call Republicans to account for their historic malfeasance in doing nothing to help the rest of us push back on Trump, but even that malfeasance can't make Trump anything but an *apolitical* non-Republican who presents a unique security threat.
1/ When someone writes me in an AMA to say Pence is as bad as Trump, I say to them that while I agree he is *on policy* it's absolutely essential that we understand that Trump presents a unique threat to America that's beyond partisan politics. Pence is "just" a crazy Republican.
One of the first things I ever wrote about the Trump-Russia scandal is that as Trump is not a real Republican, it's not partisan to use expert legal analysis or even political analysis to call him to account for his actions.		This has always been about *America*, not red or blue. https://t.co/thImzJ7Zm1

Natasha is one of the (very) good ones. She's pointing out here what my recent thread was about: the word direct is doing a *lot* of work in Ken's (and others') reporting today, and they are doing *zero* work to explain to Americans the work "direct" is doing and *how* and *why*. https://t.co/TQupW2zaJD
@KsKM3 @KenDilanianNBC Good! Very good.
NOTE5/ I don't mean to say there are no journalists doing extraordinary work—there are. But it's harder than it should to be find one who is consistently exacting in how they talk about criminal cases, and some—like Ken—are downright irresponsible. Try to find the good ones. /end
@KenDilanianNBC NOTE4/ ...saying exactly that, you might be guilty of witness tampering or obstruction or hindering prosecution or aiding and abetting but *none of those statutes* would have the words "conspiracy" or "collusion" in them, though that's what any layperson would say you were doing.
@KenDilanianNBC NOTE3/ For instance, if at an international conference Putin has a private conversation with you you don't immediately tell media about, in which he tells you to tell the media your son spoke with Kremlin agents about "adoptions," and the next day you write a statement...
@KenDilanianNBC NOTE2/ The media would then have written stories explaining to Americans that "inculpatory evidence" is evidence that tends to point *toward* the guilt of a defendant—and collusive intent can be implied in many criminal acts in whose statutes the term "collusion" nowhere appears.
@KenDilanianNBC NOTE/ If you want to know what question a responsible media would've asked Burr, it's this: "Has the Senate found inculpatory evidence of any crime with an implicitly collusive component, as attorneys define 'inculpatory evidence'?" Burr's answer would have been a *definite yes*.
@KenDilanianNBC SUMMARY/ Fix your sh*t, media. You're getting paid *more* than well enough to do your job without getting constantly corrected by experts in the areas you're attempting to cover. But the only *inexcusable offense* is not listening to those experts when they point out your errors.
@KenDilanianNBC 15/ And when I take the time to carefully point out to folks like Ken what it is they don't understand and what it is they need to correct and instead of doing so they accuse an officer of the court—which is what a lawyer is—of ulterior motives, that makes me *goddamned furious*.
@KenDilanianNBC 14/ I also know that Ken being bad at his job immediately goes viral on social media when the way in which he's bad at his job fits into exactly the false narrative that Trump supporters desperately want to hear and that the media knows will get it viewers. *That* makes me angry.
@KenDilanianNBC 13/ If you sense I'm angry at people like @KenDilanianNBC, it's because he's paid a healthy salary to misinform you on things he doesn't understand and can't explain while I'm taking time away from my career to fix the mistakes he should be ashamed of but isn't. I *resent that*.
@KenDilanianNBC 12/ The case for a conspiracy between members of the Trump campaign and Kremlin agents has been made right in front of our faces every week for 2 years. Meanwhile, the media and Trump supporters have made up a fake justice system with fake rules and are assessing Mueller by that.
@KenDilanianNBC 11/ The percent of U.S. criminal cases in which one finds a contract agreeing to commit a crime is *virtually zero*. Confessions are *common*—and are *exactly* what Mueller has been getting, behind closed doors, from people like Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, Nader, and many others.
@KenDilanianNBC 10/ I can only hope that people reading this thread will share it as widely as possible so that the spread of disinformation about evidence and our criminal justice system being perpetuated by folks like @KenDilanianNBC can be mitigated slightly on this one social media platform.
@KenDilanianNBC 9/ As an attorney, I'm ashamed that this has happened to us: that apparently no combination of attorneys and journalists was willing or able to explain at a time of national emergency even the most basic functioning of our justice system, though it was vitally important to do so.
@KenDilanianNBC 8/ The journalists who misreported what Burr said to CBS and what it meant and how evidence works and the fact that most American criminal trials are in fact dominated by circumstantial or indirect evidence should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. Rest assured, they are *not*.
@KenDilanianNBC 7/ What was expected was that by interviewing witnesses the Senate would find *evidence* of collusion that could be put to a criminal or political jury. And Burr confirmed *that is what happened*. But because the media had misinformed the public about evidence, it misreported it.
@DKinnard @KenDilanianNBC Sorry, but you are 100% wrong. Most cases put before juries are built of circumstantial or indirect evidence. People who don't understand our legal system need to stop pretending that they do, with all due respect.
@KenDilanianNBC 6/ There may be confessions in the Russia probe before it's over, but they will come *via Mueller's charges/deals*, not Congress—and no explicit contract for a conspiracy like this would ever be created, let alone found. We knew all this two years ago. The media pretended not to.
@KenDilanianNBC 5/ No attorney with criminal law experience came into the Trump-Russia probe believing one of the conspirators would confess to Congress or that an explicit contract would be found. That absurd standard was set by non-attorney Trump supporters and was then *adopted by the media*.
@KenDilanianNBC 4/ If you or I were in Ken's shoes—and we were writing about the most important story of our times—and we were using legal terms we didn't understand, we'd make sure we explained to readers *exactly what we were saying and what we weren't*. Unfortunately, that's not media today.
3/ What journalists like @KenDilanianNBC did—instead of explaining how evidence works, and what Burr's words meant—was take a quote in which Burr was saying there'd been no confession or explicit contracts found yet, even though that's *self-evident, predictable, and irrelevant*.
2/ When GOP Senate Intel chair Richard Burr was asked that question, he said Americans would have to read the report the Senate eventually creates—	likely a long time from now—and will then have to decide for themselves whether it's collusion. That's what he actually said to CBS.
1/ Any attorney—rather than a journalist pretending to know what the legal terms they're using mean—will tell you that substantial evidence of collusion has been found and the only question is what the standard of proof is to be set at and if you think that standard has been met.
When you read that a Congressional committee hasn't yet found "direct evidence" of something, understand that *all they're saying from an evidentiary standpoint* is that no one has *confessed* yet nor has any *explicit contract* been found—neither of which things anyone expected.

@real_xy11xy I didn't say I was neutral on what Israel has done. Crimes are crimes no matter who is committing them; I'm an attorney and I have always believed that and make no exception based on fondness or animus. I meant I was neutral on what should be done to resolve the situation there.
NOTE/ I want to underscore, again, that just as Putin and the Kremlin are not the Russia people, Netanyahu's corrupt government is *not* the people of Israel. I think—based on research, not animus—that Netanyahu is a major Trump-Russia villain, and in being so he's failed Israel.
CONCLUSION/ Media needs to *effing stop it* with these false stories implying Mueller is almost done. The level of complexity of the Mueller probe is obvious to *anyone* with an investigative or legal background who has done deep-dive research. Let Mueller take the time he needs.
10/ Every story we're seeing (particularly overseas) says that Mueller has had agents talk to every one of these Israeli firms, often in Israel, and that he is closing in on how Israeli engagement(s) with the Trumps pre-election fits in with—yes—Manafort and Kilimnik's collusion.
9/ I'm also saying this *now* to underscore that the Trumps hiring an attorney who already represents one of the chief Israeli figures in the Mueller investigation, Joel Zamel, is to those of us who've written books on Trump-Russia a five-alarm fire in terms of witness tampering.
8/ I'm saying this now because I'm a Jew and because no one can accuse me of hating Israel. There are many, *many* Trump-Russia analysts who've uncovered similar information about what Netanyahu—to be clear, him and not the people of Israel—appears to have done in 2015 and 2016.
7/ We know the motive: to help Trump win, because Trump would then drop sanctions on Russia, and Russia would in turn agreed to stop aiding Iran, which would then allow a new pro-US, pro-Israel geopolitical alliance to emerge in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Bahrain.
6/ And we know that top aides to Benjamin Netanyahu were involved. And not tangentially—centrally. We know their names. We know who they were communicating with within Trumpworld and when (spoiler—pre- and post-election). And we know Netanyahu is a corrupt politician (Google it).
5/ We know there was coordination between some of these firms and Trump's data firm, Cambridge Analytica. We know two of these firms offered pre-election social media manipulation to Don Jr. and he said yes. We know at least two of the firms coordinated with the Saudi Arabia/UAE.
4/ All these companies are connected in some way to social media manipulation tech and cyber-espionage—some via their outfits, some via ops adjacent to their outfits. They reached out directly to Trump aides, hitting on Gates, Kushner, Papadopoulos, Don Jr., Flynn, and 2+ others.
3/ The number of entities involved in pre-election outreach to Trump is huge, and all are "Israeli business intel" outfits whose employees are near-universally former IDF (maybe current IDF) and specifically MI: Black Cube, Wikistrat, Psy-Group, Terrogence, Inspiration, and more.
2/ The approaches from Israeli government-linked agents to the Trump campaign are legion. The intermediaries are legion. The meetings are legion. The lies told about the meetings are legion. And these are the *same* investigative patterns that we see in the Trump-Russia cover-up.
1/ I think Mueller believes this also—which is why he originally aimed to charge Papadopoulos with being an unregistered agent of Israel. An open question is how successful the Israeli op was and to what extent it leads straight to the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
I'm Jewish. I love my fellow Jews. I have a neutral disposition toward Israel. But I'm not a liar—and won't lie for Jews/Israel. After countless hours of research for Proof of Conspiracy, I've concluded that Israel may have sought to influence the 2016 election as much as Russia.
4/ Here's Mukasey lying about whether Zamel has ever met Mike Flynn in an article for The Daily Beast. Those saying Mukasey is a good guy maybe knew him before the Trumps got to him. https://t.co/mxahMoQYyZ
RT @SethAbramson: This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. Anyone who knows the Trump-Russia case even a little bit knows that Mukasey represents J…
1/ The NYT is still being too cute by half in how they approach the Special Counsel's probe, saying that he has "at least one theory" that's "still alive"—even though the NYT has *no evidence at all* that *any* theory has been discarded or refuted. So that language is misleading.
Coverage of Burr's interview dramatically misstated what Burr was indicating to media. I did a lengthy thread on the actual content of the interview here—and that thread now dovetails perfectly with what the NYT is saying about Mueller being far from done: https://t.co/EhUBj7vssL https://t.co/ST9OTincbP
3/ Since it was reported Zamel is "in Mueller's sights" months ago it only looks *more* likely Zamel was involved in pre-election collusion with Trump. I can't *believe* no one's resisting these conflicts of interest and possible joint-defense agreements. https://t.co/duQ94Ejlkr
2/ And I don't care if Mukasey has a "good reputation." We've seen the Trumps destroy the integrity of *many* men previously thought to have a "good reputation." Unless this is a different Marc Mukasey than Zamel's Marc Mukasey—which research says it isn't—this is a huge problem.
1/ Given the Trumps' long history of using shady joint-defense agreements with attorneys with few scruples, we must now assume that the TRUMPS and ZAMEL are sharing information with one another in an effort to frustrate the Special Counsel's investigation. And that's *dangerous*.
This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. Anyone who knows the Trump-Russia case even a little bit knows that Mukasey represents Joel Zamel, one of the central figures in the ENTIRE Trump-Russia investigation. The idea that Mukasey would represent the Trumps AND Zamel is... beyond insane. https://t.co/HELhfqVAT1

2/ Were I a paid political consultant (which I'm not and don't want to be) I'd consider it my duty to educate my client on where the internet will be at in 2020 and 2025 rather than dragging them kicking/screaming into an understanding of the internet that is most definitely 2004
1/ Someday (and the Republican Party, sadly, is *much* closer to this day than is the Democratic Party) people paid a lot of money to be political consultants will start seriously trying to understand how the internet works rather than bemusedly waving it all away and then losing

PS/ I submit to you seriously that the first Dem candidate who says during a speech "I'm running for President of the United States because we absolutely cannot let Mike Pence be president" immediately vaults into the top tier of candidates because they show they get the internet
10/ Anyway this thread has been free metamodern political advice for any Democratic candidate who wants to run with it and in so doing show that they understand that the currency of the digital age is attention		/end
9/ Frankly Trump's pissed off tweets demanding to be acknowledged would alone make this worth it
8/ Seriously let's just do the whole Democratic primary and maybe even the general without Trump being part of it		Just make it so much better for everyone and that's likely to be what happens anyway
RT @SethAbramson: My 2019 would be officially made if one of the Democratic candidates spent their whole primary campaign campaigning again…
7/ Trump today announced that he's basically going to stop being an actual president until the investigations into his conduct stop so this is basically Democratic candidates saying okay well until those investigations are over we are also going to act like you're not president
6/ I'd also like to point out that when this was proven effective as it immediately would be multiple Democratic candidates would start doing it until the whole field just stopped acknowledging Trump's ongoing viability as a political entity		Trump would be an old irrelevent meme
5/ You also ensure Trump talks about you constantly because he'd be enraged at you		But his obsession with you which you'd never acknowledge or return in any way would simultaneously vault you into the first tier of Dem candidates and show you'd know how to beat him if you had to
4/ And look at it this way candidates if you start running against Mike Pence now and Trump indeed goes down politically and/or legally sometime during or before the 2020 primaries you get a massive credibility boost and are many many months ahead of your competitors rhetorically
3/ Incidentally this is the sort of thing that actually seriously should happen, given that maybe twenty Democrats will be running and at least 1 or 2 of them need to find a way to distinguish themselves and you know what this is it		Start running against Pence right now somebody
2/ You wouldn't even have to make a big to-do about it, you'd just announce things like "this week we're going to show the American people how Mike Pence is wrong on immigration"
1/ Doing this would also free that candidate to answer any question about Trump or anything Trump has said about them with, "It's irrelevant"
My 2019 would be officially made if one of the Democratic candidates spent their whole primary campaign campaigning against Mike Pence on the assumption Trump will not be in office in November 2020		It would be the ultimate troll, as Trump has no idea what to do when 100% ignored

RT @jentaub: 📌 Highlights from the partial transcript from Monday's sealed court hearing with Paul Manafort. 		https://t.co/gKUfZnZ4Af
5/ While I think it's readily overstated, it's certainly true that Trump faces a unique sort of danger from SDNY or state-level prosecutions that's different in kind from what he faces at the hands of Bob Mueller—simply because he *theoretically* could try to fire/hamper Mueller.
4/ I'm not saying we know what happened here, I'm saying all the pieces are in place for this to become every bit as big of a scandal—and possible indictment—involving Trump and/or his associates as the Stormy Daniels affair, the Karen McDougal affair, and other ongoing outrages.
3/ That this story could involve the Saudis—who we know the Trumps agreed to collude with on August 3, 2016; and who (Mueller appears to believe) illegally funneled money to the Trumps in January 2017 at the very latest; and for whom Trump is now covering up a murder—I mean, wow.
2/ With *any other criminal* you'd say, "Well, surely they'll be on their best behavior while under investigation!", but Trump (a) is pathological, (b) believes his position as president affords him immunity, and (c) has a *history of committing crimes* while under investigation.
1/ The kicker: not only is this something Trump would be involved in, as he daily demonstrates that no one and nothing can stop his pathological penchant for committing crimes—e.g. Obstruction and Witness Tampering—but Pecker's *cooperating with the feds*, so they can access him.
I'd like to be the first to ask, "What did Trump know about the Pecker-Bezos extortion attempt, and when did he know it?" Hard to believe Trump never asked his pal Pecker if anything damaging could be found on his nemesis Bezos, given the nature of the Trump-Pecker relationship.
This story is the easiest frame in the history of journalism: The Richest Man in the World versus The Most Powerful Man in the World, with an infamous sleaze-merchant *currently cooperating with federal law enforcement* in the middle—who's now publicly accused of a federal crime.
TRUMP hates BEZOS—he tweets about it often. And we know TRUMP and PECKER were in a longtime covert agreement regarding the clandestine acquisition of salacious materials. Now PECKER has attempted to extort BEZOS over salacious materials. Hard to overstate how big a story this is. https://t.co/W0q0FG0OTK

BREAKING: https://t.co/cdmPdQXE3t
@StahlGilda @glenntenney I know. And I wrote my recent thread, which is about what the article *actually* says, in large part to show how effed up and lazy the media has gotten. That read of the article (that it's reducible to one glib pull-quote) is beyond irresponsible: it's profoundly unprofessional.
CONCLUSION/ I've *never* said—and would *never* say—I'm the only attorney folks should read. Read *all* the attorneys and investigators—even read @AlanDersh, who's disagreed with by the rest of us. But if you're quoting Trump Jr. on a complex federal investigation, grow up. /end
50/ Media—and attorneys like me—have an obligation to contextualize, dissect and explain interviews like Burr's so we can see how they *devastate* both of two key narratives: (1) that the Trump-Russia investigation is almost done *or* (2) that there is *no* evidence of collusion.
49/ Burr's words make clear he *doesn't* discount collusion as a possible explanation for the evidence he's seen—just that there are still enough *other* explanations that he *personally* wouldn't say collusion has been proven to the highest standard of proof. See the difference?
48/ Folks like @AlanDersh have lied about standards of proof—pretending collusion is a binary (i.e. it 100% exists or 100% doesn't). Burr instead speaks responsibly, noting that some will say collusion exists beyond a reasonable doubt and some will see evidence shy of that level.
47/ In other words, he's saying collusion will continue to be arguable post-report *based on what he knows now*—with eight years left of work to do. Given that "beyond a reasonable doubt" is the discourse standard here, he's saying some will see that level of proof, and some not.
46/ That is, the Burr interview makes absolutely, 100% crystal clear that "collusion" is *already* a *reasonable interpretation* of EXISTING FACTS—if not one he *personally* adopts—and may well be a reasonable interpretation of STILL-UNDER-INVESTIGATION and AS-YET UNKNOWN facts.
45/ But because social media (and media generally) is crappy, the entire CBS interview, which is harrowing for Trump, has now been reduced to a *single pull-quote* that Burr *quite deliberately* threw as red meat to the Trumpists—even though it contradicts his expanded comments.
44/ Burr makes clear that—in his view—it's about "60%" of America that's in the as-yet-undecided group that'll have to decide whether, "by whatever definition...[the report indicates] collusion." He allows that, in addition to the 20% (his view) who see it already, many more may.
43/ QUOTE #16: "What I'm telling you is that [the Senate Intelligence Committee] is going to present, as best we can, the facts to [media] and the American people. And you'll have to draw your own conclusion as to whether you think that, by whatever definition, that's collusion."
42/ Burr says the Senate *hasn't* started its report and *doesn't even know what form it would take*.		But most importantly, he hedges on who the report would please or displease and, contrary to what Trumpists are falsely saying today, doesn't take a final position on collusion.
41/ QUOTE #15: "In a lot of cases, we found out they [the Trump-Russia connections the Senate Intelligence Committee has found] fit in neither bucket [listed in QUOTE #14], or we don't know which bucket [yet]." So Burr admits "collusion" may well be the answer to open questions.
40/ QUOTE #14: "There's an awful lot of connections. They may not be connections that are tied to 2016 elections, but just the sheer fact that they have a relationship—it may be business. It may be Russian intelligence. It may be they're all on the payroll of Oleg Deripaska."
39/ Referring to the Manafort-Kilimnik interactions, Burr calls the argument that they were collusive a "stretch" without dismissing it (and of course he has much, much more investigation of that topic to go). But he allows that "collusion" is one possibility there and elsewhere.
38/ Burr gives a nice quotable answer that'll make Trumpists happy—which is what that quote was clearly intended to do. But his further breakdown leaves doubt. He allows that "collusion" is a possible explanation for the motivations of many of the Trump-Russia ties they've found.
37/ What some harp on is the end of the story, which tries—as media *won't stop doing*—to freeze in time a probe Burr *just said* has many, *many* years left to go. But CBS couldn't resist: have you found "collusion" right now, with (Burr implied) 8 years of investigation left?
36/ Burr implies that some witnesses (presumably U.S. witnesses) were so scared to testify before Congress that they *asked to be subpoenaed* so that they could represent (to what nefarious political or other forces we don't know) that they had no choice. What does that tell you?
35/ QUOTE #13: "It's not the people that were on the deck that we knew about that lengthened the time. It was the people we didn't know about that we came to the conclusion—either for the campaign interactions or this bigger picture we're looking at—that extended the timeline."
34/ So Burr is saying—stunningly—that the Senate came up with, in early 2017, a list of every witness it felt it needed to interview based on the intelligence it had...		...and finished with that list *two years ago*. But Burr says they've been working 6-7 days a week since then.
33/ So how great is the size/scope of this story?		QUOTE #12: "Burr had not wanted to expand the universe of witnesses the committee interviewed, but felt he had little choice. He guessed that the committee had completed interviews with its target list 'fairly early on' in 2017."
32/ So CBS registers what all who follow the Trump-Russia case closely—and have experience with criminal investigations—are saying: *every prior story* claiming the core Trump-Russia investigation was about to shut down has been *false* and no more such stories should be printed.
31/ QUOTE #11: "Burr and Warner have offered inexact estimates of when the investigation would wind down. It was already supposed to have ended by the end of 2017, by spring 2018, before the midterms, and then by the end of last year." Burr now—"We don't know what we don't know."
30/ Despite a dwindling crew of mainstream media journalists (led by @KenDilanianNBC) desperately hawking a prediction that Mueller is almost done, what CBS pulls from its interview with Richard Burr is completely different, and makes up QUOTE #11 in this thread (see next tweet).
29/ CBS underscores how much bigger those inquiries are turning out to be with some numbers, especially these two:		(1) The Committee has held ~13 public hearings.	(2) The Committee has interviewed 200+ witnesses.		Do the math. How many witnesses do you think we don't know about?
28/ The Senate reports with no timeline?		(1) Trump-Russia coordination; and	(2) the *effect* of Russian interference on the 2016 election and beyond.		This would suggest to anyone that these topics are the ones "larger, more complicated, more nefarious" than anyone anticipated.
27/ As CBS reports, when the Committee started it had 3 areas of inquiry; it's had to expand its brief to *5* areas of inquiry. And how much work does it have left? Well, it's released 2 reports and has months left before releasing a third.		And the two biggest ones? No timeline.
26/ What's true for Mueller is *also* true for the *GOP-led Senate Intel Committee*. Not only are they referring for criminal prosecution people they won't tell us about—per a Republican, Burr—they are *also* saying they know about key witnesses *none of us do yet*. Process that.
25/ Folks like @AlanDersh luxuriate in lying to Americans who don't understand our criminal justice system. They imply that law enforcement reveals its findings as it goes along—rather than only at the end—so if Mueller had anything, we'd know. No we wouldn't—that's a filthy lie.
24/ QUOTE #10: "There've been a lot of people—a lot of people—that none of you [in media] have caught. Not all the interviews [of Trump-Russia witnesses] have taken place up here [on Capitol Hill]." So Burr is saying we haven't even heard of *many* major Trump-Russia figures yet.
23/ Just imagine how *complex and nefarious* Russia's intent (as to America) has to be for a nine-person Senate staff to be *two years* into an investigation and be using a giant murder board with "a constellation of players whose roles and relationships aren't fully understood."
22/ QUOTE #9: "Inside the [Committee's investigative] spaces, the staff have several investigation boards mapping out known connections between witnesses—and a constellation of players whose roles/relationships aren't fully understood." What do you know? A *GOP-run murder board*.
21/ I often get asked—always by far-right Twitter users weakly trolling me—if I have a "murder board" in my house tying together elements of the Trump-Russia story with lengths of yarn. (Answer: nope. It's all in my head.) But you know who *does* have a murder board? The Senate.
20/ QUOTE #8: "It's hard for me to believe this could fall apart at the easiest point, which is: 'Here are the facts. Write the report.'" Burr's confidence the report won't be a fight suggests that the facts are so obvious and/or damning neither side will need/want to shade them.
19/ CBS was—it's clear—so surprised about how unified the Senate staff are that it had to tease something not in its story to gain readers: the idea there might be a fight over the final report. But when you see what Burr says about it, it's that he doesn't worry about it at all.
18/ Equally significant is how the Senate team is operating: it's a nine-person *bipartisan team* apparently so *unified* in their concern about what they're finding that they're able to *agree* on nearly everything. That's right: Burr describes a team basically on the same page.
17/ QUOTE #7: "Though the team's known to work 6 and sometimes 7 days a week, Burr denied it'd taken a toll. 'Morale's great,' he said. 'I think they're fueled by what they find.'" People ask what keeps me (or others who follow Trump-Russia daily) going—it's that. "What we find."
16/ How crazy is this? *So many people have lied to the Senate Intel Committee* in its Trump-Russia investigation that Richard Burr, once a Trump ally, *won't even tell CBS how many did* except to intimate that it's *a lot*.		Which means *some* (or *many*) new charges are coming.
15/ Burr—again, folks, an October 2016 MEMBER OF TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM—says the unprecedented access the Senate got to U.S. intelligence "gave us tremendous insight to know when somebody was lying to us." He says *many* people have been referred for criminal prosecution.
14/ Those who read this feed know which "regions and continents" Russia's "intent" covers besides North America and Russia's immediate neighbors. In fact, *everyone* following the case knows this—though we rarely hear it on TV. The Russia investigation is about *the Middle East*.
13/ QUOTE #6 (CBS): "The investigation now spans continents and includes sources from countries besides Russia—the [Committee] staff have traveled overseas and witnesses have come in to testify from abroad." So the story of Russia's "intent" involves other regions and continents.
12/ So we have a "larger, more complicated, more nefarious" story behind Russia's "intent" that goes "beyond" one election cycle and will require "a decade" to fully understand. Okay, but is the story limited to Russia's regional interests (e.g., Ukraine, NATO's eastern creep)?
11/ The implication in Burr's words is chilling: that the "story" is so big the whole Senate Intel Committee needs a *decade* to work on it, and that a big part of the story is Russia's "intent"—which far too many journalists have blithely assumed they know. It goes beyond Trump.
10/ QUOTE #5: "'[This is] work the [Senate Intel] committee will do for the next decade. And it has helped even our intelligence community's understanding of Russia's capabilities and intent behind this.' This was not, he stressed, 'Let's go screw with the Americans in 2016.'"
9/ As I write about "the grand bargain," I discuss names major media—and Mueller's indictments thus far—aren't focused on: Dahlan, Nader, Barrack, Broidy, MBS, MBZ, el-Sisi, dozens more.		Burr QUOTE #4: "We've interviewed people I don't know if the special counsel knows about..."
8/ According to CBS, per Burr the "story" Trump-Russia investigators are seeing is "larger, more complicated, and more nefarious" than the story of the 2016 election. On this feed, the shorthand we use to describe what the Republican Burr is telling CBS/us is "the grand bargain."
7/ As that CBS summary of what Burr said attests, most Americans—but not people who read this feed, I'm happy to say—think Mueller is only discovering info about what happened in "one election." Burr, Trump-Russia analysts, and readers of feeds like this know it's *beyond* that.
6/ QUOTE #3 (CBS): "The [probe] isn't compiling the story of one pivotal election, but of something larger, more complicated and—from a counterintelligence perspective—more nefarious. The final report may be so highly classified that a meaningful portion may not be made public."
5/ And "shock" isn't too strong a word, as Burr says "none of us"—meaning *even the Democrats on the Senate Intel Committee who hate Trump the most*—"ever anticipated that this [investigation] would be two years." Burr made this comment to CBS, CBS says, "solemnly." That's eerie.
4/ QUOTE #2: "What [has]...extended the life of the [Senate] investigation...is a better understanding of...how coordinated and organized the effort was." So it was the "coordination" and "organization" of what Russia did—uh, coordinating with *whom*?—that has shocked the Senate.
3/ QUOTE #1: "[Burr] acknowledges now that the investigation is broader, and perhaps more consequential, than it has long been thought to be." So America doesn't realize how much troubling material the Senate has found—or how far-flung and important to our future the material is.
2/ CBS notes that the Senate Intel Committee is entering its third year of a bipartisan Russia probe *despite* intense pressure—particularly from Burr's fellow Republicans—to wrap up its work. That alone is telling: that the Senate majority on the Committee is resisting stopping.
1/ Here's the link to the CBS interview. Skeptics reading this thread—who will be stunned by what they read—should understand that the interviewee, Republican Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, was on TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM as of October 2016. https://t.co/Z9Lbh8tyoz
(THREAD) CBS just spoke to the REPUBLICAN chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee—now entering its third year of investigating Trump-Russia ties—and what Richard Burr has to tell America should decimate any lingering skepticism about Mueller. I hope you'll read on and retweet. https://t.co/k91JqVYzds
RT @SethAbramson: (NOTE) If you can read these 285 pages of docs and *not* think when you're done that Trump was trading US foreign policy…
5/ The Trump Tower Moscow docs just released are the biggest story in America and should get wall-to-wall coverage, but they won't because too many journalists don't fully comprehend what they import legally and factually and because they cynically think folks can't follow along.
4/ Moreover, an independent digital journalist can build a horizontal appreciation for the scope of a story that lets them robustly *contextualize* new reporting, rather than getting caught in a vertical silo trying to drill down on just one topic. Jill Abramson doesn't get that.
3/ While I think the NYT and WP have done amazing work on the Trump-Russia story, they also have an institutional hubris that puts them in competition with their peers and causes them to downplay others' scoops. Independent digital journalists don't have to play that game at all.
2/ If you wonder why there's so much anger at Jill Abramson now, indeed so much major media is covering it more than the Buzzfeed docs, it's because this former New York Times editor spent much of her book wagging her finger at a digital media running *circles* around Old Media.
1/ The top question I'm getting is why my feed has a giant thread on the Trump Tower Moscow docs Buzzfeed just released while major media isn't on the story at all. Answer: major media has missed big swaths of the Trump-Russia story while criticizing feeds like mine that haven't.
@afd1369 It's *exactly* the opposite. I wrote a whole book on this subject and have an excellent handle on the context, so I'm able to take these docs and show you how the "tip of the iceberg" (as I called it) relates to a broader context I've exhaustedly researched. *Zero* extrapolation.

25/ I only touched the tip of the iceberg here with these Buzzfeed docs. The point is this: only *willful ignorance* explains, going forward, anyone saying or thinking that Trump did not conspire with the Russians via his longtime business agents (who briefed him regularly). /end
24/ I mean, *look*! Sater in blue, Cohen in white: https://t.co/Dcdltdauyr
23/ And Sater confirms that Putin *knew* of the tower deal (Putin, in context, is "the boss" in this Sater text): https://t.co/gSN5Z3wfMo
22/ Trump knew *everything* (excerpt from text from Cohen to Sater): https://t.co/3gXB1XFP9F
21/ Was this really a deal between Trump and the Kremlin? Well, look at the evidence Sater sent privately to his friend Cohen, not knowing Mueller (or anyone) would ever see it: https://t.co/hi2IUJ1pND
20/ And did Trump "ask Cohen what was happening [on the tower deal]"? Well, look at the evidence Cohen sent privately to his friend Sater, not knowing Mueller (or anyone) would ever see it: https://t.co/HISXIVDnuK
19/ Here is Sater *acknowledging to Cohen* that he is *actively hiding* what he's doing from media, voters, and all others. https://t.co/MaWoO3jD1T
18/ As established in PROOF OF COLLUSION, Cohen is almost certainly referring here to the *other tower deals Russia had offered Trump* when he refers to "the others." There were at *least* two other deals that Cohen did *not* reject but merely placed on temporary hold for Trump. https://t.co/HAH0lpqUOz
17/ It'd be comedic if it weren't a national tragedy. https://t.co/QgtQ7p3qLT
16/ These are *all* "acts in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy" by law, and it's clear Cohen will testify they were taken at Trump's direction—just as he's already said Trump directed him to take other illegal actions. There's no chance Trump can argue Cohen was freelancing.
15/ ALL OF THIS IS A VIOLATION OF THE STRINGER BELL RULE (NSFW): https://t.co/ixIoDSGutF
14/ I mean JFC two of Trump's *longtime business agents* are *discussing in texts Mueller has* that they must *hide what they're doing* because the *Kremlin wants it hidden*. This is *conspiring with the Kremlin to defraud the US* by pretending there are no illegal negotiations. https://t.co/Of2M0fnAi8
13/ Just 10 days after Trump's adviser Michael Flynn dined with Putin in Moscow in December '15 (after *also* going to the home of the Russian ambassador), Trump's attorney is negotiating *Trump himself going overseas* to meet with Putin. I mean, holy crap! You should be floored. https://t.co/qfdKKvmnrB
12/ That Trump is done isn't in question; either he'll face impeachment or he'll face indictments post-presidency. What *is* in doubt, and very much so, is the timeframe for Trump facing the music. But anyone who says he won't ever face the music hasn't seen the evidence. Period.
11/ Moreover, as detailed in Proof of Collusion, not only has Sater previously cooperated with the FBI, but his attorney has *publicly offered such cooperation* and *in the Mueller probe*. So Sater is undoubtedly speaking to Mueller and all *he* says is confirmed in these emails.
10/ So many of Cohen's claims about his relationship with Trump will be confirmed by *audiotapes with Trump's voice on them* that the idea anyone's going to have to accept things merely on Cohen's say-so is absurd. Mueller already has—we know—corroborating information from Cohen.
9/ We've already heard audio of how closely Cohen briefed Trump on his activities on Trump's behalf (and at his direction); remember the Stormy Daniels audiotapes. There is no reason to believe Cohen did not keep Trump apprised of all these details, and indeed he now says he did.
8/ Understand this, too: Felix Sater is *himself* an agent of Trump. So Trump is authorizing Sater to engage with Putin's "very very close" friends and advisers on his behalf as part of a ten-year business relationship Trump has had with Sater (who has a Trump Org business card).
7/ Of course Trump's statements on US foreign policy—the ones Sater wants—are *promises* Trump is making to voters on *what he'll do as president* in terms of *real US policy*. So this is a federal bribery case. Bribery is enumerated in the Constitution as an impeachable offense.
6/ Sater is telling Cohen that Trump must record his public statements on U.S. foreign policy so that they can be given, via an intermediary who will "have dinner with Putin," to Putin himself. And that will be done so that Putin will green-light Trump's multibillion dollar deal.
5/ Sater *tells* Trump's attorney (and longtime political adviser/aide in prior embryonic POTUS runs) Cohen that Trump's public statements on *U.S. foreign policy* are *helping Trump get this deal done with Putin*. And make no mistake—*Putin* is seen as the man he's dealing with.
4/ Sater is dealing with Putin's "very very close people," says he can "get Putin" to say certain things publicly, acknowledges that what Trump is doing is "negotiating" with Putin in secret, and even makes references to US policy in key areas, most interestingly the Middle East. https://t.co/knHal7ITfn
3/ Consciousness of guilt on the part of all parties was confirmed by a) Trump lying about all of this ("NO DEALS! NO NOTHING!") but of course also b) the lengths everyone involved went to to hide what was happening and then lie about it if caught. *Everyone* knew this was wrong. https://t.co/6zCT92Lgfg
2/ Almost *every* message Sater sent to Trump's attorney and fixer was about *how Trump could please Putin* and specifically *how Trump could please Putin through foreign policy*. Here, it's about pleasing Putin by going into business with his old boss (*always* note the dates): https://t.co/Vps8JfFo2J
1/ I mean just *look*! This is Felix Sater, Trump's *extremely close business partner* since 2005. Sater is Trump's designated fixer on all things Russia and began working on potential tower deals in Moscow for Trump a full decade before these emails. And Trump knew all about it. https://t.co/chlHx3AxH3
(NOTE) If you can read these 285 pages of docs and *not* think when you're done that Trump was trading US foreign policy on Russia for money, you're a Trumpist dead-ender. I don't even say that cruelly, but sadly.		What these documents signify is *insane*. https://t.co/f97kKFOMYB
2/ What I'm saying is that even guys with big rap sheets and some antisocial tendencies would consider Trump that most *gregarious* brand of criminal who not only wants to hurt people and/or take things not his but do so with 100% impunity. Those are the *really* dangerous folks.
Having represented a couple thousand defendants, I'd say people would be surprised by how few—how *few*—defendants deem investigation of their actions illegitimate. They may not *like* it, but they generally accept that it must happen. Trump is one of the *hard-bitten* criminals. https://t.co/7UgQlxTuNf
In his defense, he's only saying this because he's guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors https://t.co/1XmOlXpdC3
I'm not at all bothered by those who think the Saudi/UAE (and Israeli/Egyptian) angles are a "turn away" from Russia. As the author of Proof of Collusion and its sequel Proof of Conspiracy, I know all about the not just rude but *thundering* awakening they have coming and *soon*.
@LisbethFarnum1 Soon
SPOILER: The Russia story *is* the Saudi Arabia/UAE/Israel/Egypt/Bahrain story and vice versa. These *aren't* two separate stories; the latter is part of a broader story that *entwines* with Trump-Russia collusion at every point and is at *many* points factually the *same story*.
Asha is exactly right. Readers of this feed will know all about where the probe's heading, as we've been discussing it here (me/readers) for a long time.

@asaltandbuttery Flynn simultaneously advised five candidates in 2015, one of whom was Trump (another, Carson). In December he leaves Carson and is officially on Trump's team by February. His work with Carson is relevant to what he offers Trump, as I will discuss much more in Proof of Conspiracy.
6/ So Cohen "calling off" the deal could be Trump's petulance, a negotiating tactic (Trump thought he had the upper hand as the presumptive GOP nominee), or a foreknowledge of the hacking that caused Trump to back off for fear of being caught redhanded in a deal with the Kremlin.
5/ It's at that time that the Trumps realize finally that their Russian business partners the Agalarovs aren't going to get them the stolen Clinton documents directly, and Team Trump initiates at least 4 secret efforts to get to Russian hackers to secure the documents themselves.
4/ Another missing element is what it could possibly be that causes Cohen to (allegedly) call off the tower deal on June 14. In Proof of Collusion, June 14 is almost the exact date the Trump team's anger over Russia not providing Clinton's stolen emails causes a change of course.
3/ But surely the most striking thing in the article is that Trump's lawyer Cohen communicated to the Kremlin directly just before the primaries started that Trump was willing to bribe Putin with a $50 million penthouse to approve the deal. Not long after, Russia's hacking began.
2/ As evidenced by Sater asking Cohen to get him a video of Trump discussing his pro-Russia policies for Putin to review, both Cohen and Sater were aware that if Trump did not do well in the early primaries he'd lose the cultural capital he needed to cut a tower deal with Putin.
1/ Other things to remember: Cohen and Sater are close friends from childhood, not mere business acquaintances. Second, it seems likely Cohen starts to get angry at Sater about the delay in signing the deal because he knows the primaries are coming up and Trump might not do well.
This is a great summary, though a key event Buzzfeed misses is the event that likely caused Putin to for the first time quasi-endorse Trump and for Sater to tell the Trumps, in consequence, "now is the time": Trump adviser Flynn dines with Putin in Moscow in early December 2015. https://t.co/ZsZuTvRTcd

3/ And because I'm also a writer, I do think in terms of metaphors. Everything Donald Trump does to hide his true form from Americans (whether it be with his hair, skin, or anything else) is a metaphor for the penchant for deceit he has now poisoned our values and discourse with.

7/ This TIME piece is a warning from our top security officials, yet there is *no question whatsoever* most of us will ignore it by continuing to pretend this man is something other than a clear and present danger to our security and the health and well-being of all our families.
6/ Proof of my claim (that Trump is a danger): Trump repeated North Korean propaganda about its nuclear program even *after* U.S. officials went to *extraordinary* lengths (building him a toy model of the nuclear facility in question) to get him to understand and relay the truth.
5/ Then (same briefing): "When Trump [looked at the map of South Asia and] said he was familiar with Bhutan and knew it, too, was part of India, his briefers told him that Bhutan was an independent kingdom."		Still *not* an Onion excerpt. But it *is* a sign that Trump's a danger.
4/ "In a briefing on South Asia, Trump’s advisors brought a map of the region from Afghanistan to Bangladesh. Trump, they said, pointed at the map and said he knew Nepal was part of India, only to be told that it is an independent nation."		This is *not* an Onion article excerpt.
3/ "[At a briefing on the] British Territory of Diego Garcia, Trump asked two questions: Are the people nice, and are the beaches good? 'Some of us wondered if he was thinking of the security issues in an important area, or whether he was thinking like a real estate developer.'"
2/ "What's most troubling, say these officials and others in government and on the Hill who've been briefed on the episodes, are Trump’s angry reactions when he's given information that contradicts positions he has taken or beliefs he holds."		This *won't* save him from the law.
1/ "Analysts who prepare Trump’s briefs, and the briefers themselves, describe futile attempts to keep his attention by using visual aids, confining some briefing points to two or three sentences, and repeating his name and title as frequently as possible."		This is a *disgrace*.
Everyone should understand that "willful ignorance" of a crime is NOT (I repeat NOT) a defense to aiding and abetting it under federal law. So Trump's willful ignorance of the Russian crimes he was briefed on in August 2016 is NOT (I repeat NOT) a defense. https://t.co/qGzCYVWfus

American politics is experiencing two spacetime continua:		(1) When DEMOCRATS misbehave, we enter a STANDARD political sphere, in which racism and other bigotry is unacceptable. Call it "2014."		(2) When REPUBLICANS (Trump, Moore, King) misbehave, we enter the damn TWILIGHT ZONE.

@DavidCayJ @GovernorVA I think you may be right, but if he won't resign, a VA delegate on MSNBC already said they will explore other options for removal so this conversation too seems relevant
@matt_alters Agreed. Some Democrats would go also.
4/ Hewitt told MSNBC that he is calling for Northam's impeachment because Virginia is under a "malfeasance" standard for impeachment. So is America, which is why Abuse of Power (not a crime) was an impeachment-eligible offense at the presidential level for both Nixon and Clinton.
3/ Northam should go. And under the Hewitt Standard, so should Kavanaugh, Trump, King, Hyde-Smith, McConnell, and a large number of federal and state GOP officials. Let's *do* this. Let's clean house in American government of the documented racists, misogynists, and antisemites.
2/ We Democrats can either deal with a single bad actor in Virginia (which would be fine) or *change America for the better* by agreeing on a *bipartisan standard* for the conduct of our leaders (which would be *great*).		Let's not blow this *critical* moment in American history.
1/ Let's do this, America. Let's have this discussion *now*. Let's create a firm moral standard we can apply equally to all our leaders when it comes to racism, misogyny, and antisemitism. This conversation, initiated by the Republican Hewitt, *will* happen if US media allows it.
BREAKING NEWS (MSNBC): Preeminent Right-Wing Commentator Hugh Hewitt Has Called for Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to Be Impeached, Forcing All Major Republican Figures Nationwide to Declare Whether a 1984 Med School Photo Is An Impeachable Offense; Consequences for Trump Pending
@WhosePolitics @GOPChairwoman As to whether it *should* be I think, as I'm a New Hampshirite not a Virginian, it's best for Virginians to decide that via their elected officials		But now that national GOP figures have weighed in to express their views, I think they *must* answer the impeachment question, also
@WhosePolitics @GOPChairwoman *Technically* anything legislators say is impeachable is impeachable, both in Virginia and when the GOP impeached a U.S. president for oral sex
This Northam scandal in Virginia could blow up in Republicans' faces *real* fast. All it would take is *a single member of US media* asking @GOPChairwoman whether Northam should be *impeached* now that he has refused to resign. I expect that she would shut up *extremely* quickly.
Now that Northam has refused to resign, American media must ask *all politicians nationwide* whether they think he should be *impeached* on the basis of that photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook. This is a great opportunity for healing in America and it should not be missed.
@teerpvar He has already refused. They will have to move to impeach him now.
A political observation: if Virginia Democrats vote to remove Northam on the basis of a photo in his 1984 med school yearbook, Virginia *Republicans* will have to decide if that's a basis for impeachment.		At that point, media *must* ask *every* national Republican if they agree.

@SirLearnsaloteh My last tweet was a general statement, i.e. it wasn't directed at you in particular		Sorry for the confusion
@upsanddowns8 You have gravely misdefined "whataboutism," which has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with what I wrote		"Whataboutism" is giving your side a pass on its bad behavior because the other side has done so under similar circumstances, and that's the *opposite* of what I just said
@SirLearnsaloteh Candidly, I don't care how my tweets come across to those who don't read what they actually say or can't accommodate the idea of a consistent and rigorous moral code on the subject of racism
@MaggyW5 Yes, I meant Trump		Many Democrats won't call for him to resign because it's "too partisan"
@SirLearnsaloteh The "yeah but" reaction you reference here is EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE of what I just proposed, which is "yes and," i.e., we must at ALL times hold ALL leaders to the same high standard. "Whataboutism" would be saying Northam should get a pass because Trump has. I said no such thing.
@MaggyW5 Nope, not even close
I urge ALL DEMOCRATS and ALL REPUBLICANS to add to their calls for Northam's resignation a call for Trump's resignation, as his history of racist acts is even longer and more spectacular. Let's hold ALL pols to the same high standard. RETWEET if you agree. https://t.co/iivniDqNkX

Putin wanted out of the pact. Trump obliged him by going first and making Putin's action seem reasonable and warranted. Another win for Putin—another loss for America.

Considering who our president is and what he's done and how publicly he's done it and for how long he's done it, it's really something to watch Gov. Northam's political career go from fine to dead in 24 hours. Imagine if America could arouse this level of moral outrage for Trump.

PS2/ And here's my original thread to Alan: https://t.co/CCyM3yVf77
PS/ Here (below) is Alan's thread, which was in response to my first thread addressing him. https://t.co/Q7t5MJTcu9
1/ Here, below, is a link to my response to Alan Dershowitz's new—in some cases {*ahem*} quite *disappointingly* "new"—claims. Click the link below to open up a thread with my responses to him. (In a postscript, I'll provide a link to Dershowitz's thread.) https://t.co/eRIYT2CWww
(THREAD) To his credit, @AlanDersh likes a spirited debate as much as I do. So here is "Round 2" of our debate on whether Robert Mueller is the most professional, admirable, and successful federal prosecutor of this century thus far—which he is. I hope you'll read on and retweet. https://t.co/KP8EMXdNQk
15/ Alan and I have both been in the trenches of our criminal justice system—we know how it works. And we both know that the way he describes how the system should work for a man in his social milieu—Trump—is not how it works for the rest of us. And that's his gravest error. /end
14/ But I'll say this: Alan got one thing right. He says that I was presumptuous to presume that he gave me an A+ in Criminal Law at Harvard Law School in the late 1990s because I "thought like him." I should have said that I earned that grade by thinking for myself—as I am here.
13/ It's no coincidence that Cohen was shaking down women with threats, NDAs, and secret deals with their lawyers *before* the election and then shaking down foreigners for money *after* the election—in both cases as Trump's fixer and bagman. This was Cohen's *role* with Trump.
12/ Just so, I *also* criticize Mueller for handing off the *Cohen* case, as Cohen's behavior managing Trump's illicit funding and campaign schemes before and after the election—including Russian collusion before and after the election—was of a piece, and Mueller should say that.
11/ Indeed, I'll go in the *other* direction and say Mueller must be *criticized* for *not* keeping the Butina case under his control and supervision, as it's *very much* about Russia-US collusion during the election. Mueller handing it off allowed demagogues like Alan to thrive.
10/ But what I've shown is that *every* indictment Alan has a problem with is *essential* to what Alan himself has called Mueller's "core" mandate. In fact, we can't find *any* offense Mueller *didn't* hand off to someone that *doesn't* aid him in his (per Alan) "core" mandate.
9/ What Alan is really saying: "The majority of Mueller's indictments are exactly what I think he should be doing—but unfortunately, by no fault of Mueller's, those defendants won't show up to trial. Some of his other indictments are also OK by me. A *few* I have a problem with."
8/ Alan tells us to a) ignore the *majority* of Mueller's indictments, which involve Russian interference—crimes even Alan calls part of Mueller's core mandate—and then b) *admits* that *some percentage* of the other indictments *don't* fall into the two baskets he's angry about.
7/ What I can't get over is, what type of argument holds it significant that "nearly all" indictments in a short period—just 20 months, a *blink of an eye* for an investigation like this one—fit into "one of three categories"? Why doesn't Alan tell us more about the *exceptions*?
6/ Alan's tripartite argument:		(1) Forget the indictments for collusion!	(2) See! There are no indictments for collusion!	(3) Also, any indictment Mueller hasn't brought in 18 months will probably never happen!*		*Ken Starr took nine years to investigate President Bill Clinton.
5/ Alan *also* says that (what he calls) Mueller's "secondary role"—to prosecute any crimes he finds—"has produced many more indictments that the primary one" (to prosecute people for collusion). That's, uh... wildly false? There are *many* more indictments in the latter basket.
4/ Oddest of all, Alan crows about how the Russians Mueller charged "will never be brought to trial" and how Mueller has *thus far* not charged an American with conspiring with those Russians... *even though the evidence he's collected shows that an American did*. Patience, Alan!
3/ @AlanDersh also falsely says that Mueller's only purpose in conclusively establishing Manafort's and Gates' motives to collude by showing their financial status when they decided to work for Trump for "free" was in fact to "pressure them to provide information against Trump."
2/ For instance, his claim that Bob Mueller's authorizing document indicates that he should acknowledge "core," "secondary," and "not directly related" categories of crimes is *false*. In fact, Mueller's authorization implicitly demands the *opposite*: that all crimes be pursued.
In response to my thread disassembling his claim that "Mueller crimes fit into 3 categories: process crimes that occurred after he was appointed; financial crimes unrelated to the Russia investigation; and crimes by non-Americans," @AlanDersh has changed his argument. Do I reply? https://t.co/Q7t5MJTcu9
@ememwilson123 And that's why what I suggested is the opposite of what you said: I'm saying we hold *everyone* to the same high standard, rather than saying things like, "We have to be better than Republicans." Saying that just enables them to create their own—obscenely low—standard of conduct.
(UPDATE) We need to know where Howard Lorber was on June 6—as we know that, *within a 48-hour window* of that time, *he was with Trump*. If Lorber was planning the June 8 NYC fundraiser with Trump, the chances he was with him on June 6 are *high*. (h/t DM) https://t.co/pGQNDiSSCY
@BruceSba48 Yes—you've got it. Strategic morality. I can't locate tonight, certainly not in the GOP but not even in many Democrats, a consistent scale of moral outrage that is applied on the basis of unwavering principle, and always in proper measure, no matter who the offender is. It's sad.
@DianneGallo No—it's not sustainable. But calling on Northam to resign—an instinct I understand—makes everyone feel *so* good that we're not seeing how *very* effed up the larger picture is. I mean, the Virginia Republican Party called on Northam to resign in *minutes* and is silent on Trump.
PS/ My point is, we're being fooled by leaders who find it easy to call on Northam to resign because it makes them look bipartisan, but who *won't* make the same call under *worse* circumstances with Trump... because they want to look bipartisan. We need to learn our lesson. /end
@derrickb75 I understand the desire to handle this cleanly. But there are many things that must be learned here—and one is that we can't let our Dem leaders call for Northam's resignation but then tell the base that they're insufficiently wise or temperate when they demand that Trump resign.
10/ I remember when some of us called for Kavanaugh to resign, not only because he perjured himself—a felony—multiple times, but because there was evidence of a pattern of sexual aggression in his life. The same DC Democrats who told us to cool down are telling Northam to resign.
9/ (Correction: Northam's "C**nman" nickname was from his VMI years, not medical school, and remains unexplained—though there's no reason to hope it's anything but what it seems to be, which is another grotesque racial slur played off at the time, incredibly, as jaunty hijinks.)
@derrickb75 That's my point—if we don't hold *everyone* to the *same high standard*, but rather demand more of ourselves than everyone else, we're actually *enabling* the GOP view that *their* politicians can do whatever they want, but when *ours* make grave mistakes, they must be destroyed.
8/ What Northam did was grotesquely racist. If it's true his med school nickname was "C**nman," that pic was no one-time cataclysmic error in judgment. But I wish the moral clarity some D.C. Democrats have today would appear when Trump acts as or more evil than this *every week*.
7/ And before you say, "Of course all the powerful Democrats who are calling for Northam to resign have also repeatedly called on Trump to resign," please do a Google search to confirm whether that's in fact correct or whether we're presuming moral backbone where none yet exists.
6/ Today's a great day for people of conscience from both sides of the aisle to call for Northam to resign over a 1984 photo if they consider it appropriate and then *with one loud voice* say that Northam could live 100 lifetimes and not be as vile or dangerous as this president.
5/ Anyone can feel or think any way they want to about how horrible Northam is in 2019 because of what he did in 1984, and it'll *still* indict our collective moral judgment if we don't *also* say Trump's offenses are 1000% fresher, greater in number, more hateful and more cruel.
4/ The revelation of what Northam did 35 years ago at a med school party has hurt many people, and Northam will have to answer for it. But I am hearing some D.C. Democrats talk about what should happen to Northam in a way they *never* have about Trump, though we've asked them to.
3/ To put a finer point on it: we already know history will damn this era's GOP for being hypocrites who put party over country or basic decency. But all *Democrats* who call on Northam to resign—which is fine—must *also* be asked if they're currently demanding that Trump resign.
2/ This applies, as Gillibrand said, to both "friends and foes." Virginia Republican Party, *fuck you*. And any Democrat who let Trump be racist, anti-Semitic, and misogynistic as hell and *didn't* call for him to resign because you didn't want to seem "partisan," screw you, too.
I've no problem with people calling for Northam to resign. I'm 100% fine with it. But if you're doing so and *haven't* publicly called for Trump to resign at least *30 times*, including after he called neo-Nazis "fine people" in *2017*, I have *strong* feelings about your values.

@maggieNYT 4/ To be clear, I'm not trying to get inside Maggie's head with this analysis, I'm saying that the way that NYT story is written confirms the metanarrative behind its authorship and editing had to do with a political "horse race" that bears no relationship to a journalist's duty.
@maggieNYT 3/ What happened here is that Maggie decided Trump hadn't had a "win" for awhile, and that if this story, which is devastating for Trump, wasn't spun as a "win" Trump and his allies would be livid at the NYT and say not nice things about their coverage, maybe hurting sales a bit.

2/ The Daily Caller is just Tucker Carlson's blog written by people who aren't Tucker Carlson but it's still embarrassing to see a grown adult calling a Don Jr.-Lorber call a "destruction" of the stone-cold certainty Don told Daddy of his upcoming Kremlin meeting at Daddy's house
The *lack of mental acuity* one has to have to believe Trump Jr. lied to his dad for a year about a piece of intel his dad had wanted to receive more than any other in his entire life is beyond stunning and I can't imagine a real journalist writing a story like Chuck Ross now has https://t.co/FKI4lXgBr8
3/ Trump had many(ish) advisers, probably many with blocked numbers, so what this CNN report does is underscore that Mueller has been able to penetrate that veil of secrecy to discover which Trump friends/advisers were immediately called in the thick of the Trump-Russia contacts.
2/ And of course Lorber will be asked not only if he remembers that call but *any* conversation with Trump about Russia, Clinton emails, and so on while he was Trump's best friend and adviser. And if he lies, there are probably texts, emails and/or call records contradicting him.
Investigators may see it differently. With a Trump-Don Jr. call, Trump and his son can both deny recalling whether the call mentioned the Agalarovs and no one would be able to contradict them. *Now* Lorber becomes a "new" witness who can be asked a slough of questions under oath. https://t.co/ALPYBv2Tms

3/ I have no idea why any member of the media or Congress is implying even distantly that CNN's report is positive for Trump. It's a disaster. An *exculpatory* call would've been to a random vendor or something, suggesting that Don didn't think the Goldstone news was significant.
2/ Put aside that Don could've *at any point* after Goldstone wrote him talked to his dad *in person* about the news, including the day he got the email. Even *beyond* that, I'd argue that *Lorber* being the call recipient suggests the news penetrated Trump's inner circle *ASAP*.
If you think it's exculpatory that when he learned the Kremlin would give his dad stolen Clinton docs Jr. called his dad's best friend—a campaign adviser, member of Trump's inner circle, and man with Russia ties who'd gone with Trump to Russia—you on some level have to be joking. https://t.co/TxdwqUASbL

RT @SethAbramson: IMPORTANT NOTE: One of the two men Trump Jr. called after hearing from Agalarov about stolen Clinton docs is, per *Trump…
5/ IMPORTANT NOTE #2: Per POLITICO, Lorber was a *part of Trump's campaign*. Specifically he was on the economic advisory team—the equivalent of the National Security Advisory Committee. Shouldn't we be saying Trump Jr.'s phone called a *campaign adviser*? https://t.co/xDn41I9Ao3
4/ Also, if Don Jr. was in the same place as his dad on June 6, which he probably was if it was Trump Tower, isn't it possible that it was *Trump* using his son's phone to call his best friend, Lorber? Who knows, but I do think the writing's on the wall as to where this is going.
3/ During the campaign the New York Times asked Trump to name his best friends, and Lorber was one of the two people he mentioned. However, Lorber refused to speak to the New York Times about his best friend. Why was Lorber so concerned about talking to media during the campaign?
2/ Who knows if Lorber gave Trump his phone for sensitive calls, if the men were together at the time, if Lorber was used as an intermediary on Russia issues (as Lorber historically has had major Russia ties), if Trump was conferenced in... but *somehow* that call leads to Trump.
IMPORTANT NOTE: One of the two men Trump Jr. called after hearing from Agalarov about stolen Clinton docs is, per *Trump himself*, "one of his two best friends" (Bloomberg). There's *no way* that call doesn't end up leading to revelations that Trump knew of the June 2016 meeting.
@Adam_Michaelson Of course! I agree it could've been something as simple as that and is very likely to be. But my point is that Don knew to call Lorber rather than his dad, which suggests some sort of ongoing arrangement for calls involving Russia that were sensitive. Otherwise he'd call his dad.
6/ WASHINGTON POST: Lorber is one of Trump's *best friends*. He's not one of Trump Jr.'s best friends.  We will learn that this Lorber call involved Trump somehow. https://t.co/72j6cOvaUC
5/ Or Trump had Lorber's phone. Who knows. But *something* here does not sound right at all. Don had *just* learned the Kremlin was going to give his dad the documents he'd wanted for a *long* time.
4/ I wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that the Trumps used conference calls with third parties to "launder" phone records, meaning Don may have called Lorber, who may have then brought Trump in on the call. This is *not* going to be the end of this story. Not by a long shot.
3/ By "the normal amount of sense," I mean something that must be *thoroughly* investigated by Mueller, as it may be indicative of illicit behavior. I would not want to be Howard Lorber right now, as any contacts he's ever had with Russia are going to be or have been scrutinized.
2/ OTOH, if Lorber was previously a prospective business partner in Moscow, and Jr. had just gotten a communication originating with Trump's then-active partner in a Trump Tower Moscow, Aras Agalarov...maybe this call to Lorber actually makes precisely the normal amount of sense?
BREAKING: One call was to Howard Lorber.		"Trump’s ties with Lorber run deep...[and] have attracted the interest of congressional investigators. In the 90s, when Trump started exploring real estate options in Russia, Lorber accompanied him on a tour of Moscow."		This feels fishy. https://t.co/UyqXPy8QQJ
Serious question: this is an image I took directly off my TV just now while watching Ari Melber. Did Trump *really* look like this on November 4, 2018? Does anyone else remember this happening?

That is correct. https://t.co/RjYorHm9DV

5/ (I don't mean in any sense to take away from the overwhelming volume of suspicious events taking place in and around the Trump campaign between June 3rd, 2016 and August 3rd, 2016, but I think we'll start to see this as the *second* of three phases of pre-election collusion.)
4/ While the number of key Trump-Russia events in April 2016 is very large, so many of them seem to have been directly "set up" by March 2016 events. As for January/February 2016, that's when Trump was still building his team, and not yet clearly a favorite to win the nomination.
3/ March 2016 is shaping up as perhaps the most critical month of activity in the Trump-Russia timeline. The number of suspicious Trump campaign events then (involving Stone, Manafort, Papadopoulos, &amp;c), alongside the number of hacking events, will increasingly be a major focus.
2/ In other words, as time goes on the phrase "but her emails" becomes less a joke about how poorly media covered the 2016 presidential election and more a sober assessment of where the Mueller investigation is headed. Trump's obsession with "her emails" could end his presidency.
Given that WikiLeaks published its archive of Clinton emails on March 16, 2016, the chances Stone waited until June to locate an intermediary to WikiLeaks are low, especially as the Washington Post says by "spring 2016" he was talking to people about upcoming WikiLeaks releases.

If I understand right Mitch McConnell came out hard against... voting... today
CONCLUSION/ Twenty years ago, almost to the day, I entered Alan's Criminal Law class at Harvard. I ended up getting an A+—not a typo—which is a grade that doesn't even exist at HLS. I suspect Alan gave me the grade because he felt I think as he does. I'm glad that I no longer do.
50/ Who knows if it's Trump's pre-election collusion with Israelis, prurient stuff involving Trump pals, or something else that so diminishes Alan on Trump issues. I really don't care. What I care about is him being repeatedly and deliberately wrong when I *know* he knows better.
49/ We've all heard of the importance of motive—and, more broadly, state of mind or mens rea—in proving a criminal case. The so-called "unrelated" financial crimes Mueller brought against Manafort and Gates *provide the entire context and reasoning behind their Russia collusion*.
48/ So you needn't be a lawyer to see that charges establishing the financial crimes Manafort (and Gates) committed to *get Manafort into the situation he was in* during the campaign, under which circumstances he *colluded with the Kremlin*—with *Gates' aid*—are *hyper-relevant*.
47/ Manafort was a consultant making millions a year when he declared to a Trump pal he had to "get to Trump" and offered to work for *free*—he then used his position as Trump's Campaign Manager to try to "get whole" with ex-business partners by offering collusion to the Kremlin.
46/ And finally, I want to address the farce that is Alan's reference to "financial crimes" he claims are "unrelated" to the Russian collusion issue. This is a dire and frankly embarrassing misunderstanding of particularly the charges brought against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates.
45/ But it also doesn't change the facts: when you read Mueller's speaking indictments on Papadopoulos or Flynn or anyone else, you understand perfectly that the charges against these men are being used (in the former case quite successfully) to pursue Mueller's primary mission.
44/ Mueller's speaking indictments—indictments that don't just itemize charges, but lay out some facts that led to the charges—are generous acts that *ensure* men like Alan Dershowitz won't *ever* get to claim that *any* Mueller charges are far afield. But that doesn't stop Alan.
43/ The Stone indictment's of the same character. Stone *chose* to tell lies that were not only *about* Russian collusion but whose telling *revealed* to Mueller that Russia-related wrongdoing was afoot—and tied to Trump's campaign. That's why Mueller uses "speaking" indictments.
42/ So maybe it's no accident Alan forgot about Papadopoulos and Flynn, as in these cases the men had *much* to tell Mueller that was directly relevant to his ongoing Russia investigation—*and* it was the nature of the lies they *chose* to tell that *revealed* they had such info.
41/ In other words, Mueller's doing exactly what prosecutors do: not looking for crimes that are out of his way, but using charges—of *all* kinds—to undercover Russia-related lies/wrongdoing and force those who chose quite carefully to lie about *that conduct* to tell the truth.
40/ That is, the so-called "process crimes" Mueller charges: (a) reveal lies about substantive Russia-related wrongdoing; (b) arise in the *very midst* of Mueller *doing his job* investigating Russian collusion; and (c) are intended—as they should be—to *help him find the truth*.
39/ So what we see, over and over again, is that Mueller doesn't bring the sort of "you put me out!" charges that suggest he's stretching to find crimes by Trump aides, allies, and associates that his own investigation (only sort of) "created" just by existing—but the *opposite*.
38/ For that matter, what did Alex van der Zwaan, another Mueller perp, lie about? Uh...only whether he lied to federal agents about a report he did for Trump's Campaign Manager and Deputy Campaign Manager that involved their work for Kremlin agents—including Kilimnik—in Ukraine.
37/ What did Flynn lie about? Uh...only whether he'd illegally negotiated U.S. foreign policy with the Kremlin, whether he'd done so in his capacity as a Trump campaign official, and whether any Trump campaign staff were in a position to know what he was doing.		So—*substantive*.
36/ What did Papadopoulos lie about? Uh...only whether and when he'd had contact with Kremlin agents and whether he did so as a Trump campaign adviser and whether anyone on the campaign knew or could have known about his contacts with Kremlin agents.		*Substantive as hell*, that.
35/ So what sort of so-called "process crimes" are we dealing with here, of these very different situations? Alan doesn't want you to think about it. And candidly, that's because *of course* what Mueller has brought are *substantive* charges very *much* about the underlying case.
34/ ...the investigation has already locked in all relevant facts, and the tamperer just wants to disrupt the trial process. In the former instance, the charge might well be *substantive*—a charge *necessary* to advance the underlying case. In the latter instance, maybe less so.
33/ The witness tampering example I gave—that is, a non-trial witness threatening a trial witness post-investigation but pre-trial—could go either way. *Maybe* the prosecutor really fears that the tampering's intended to hide facts relevant to the case about to start, or maybe...
32/ Compare that to a perjury charge brought *after* a trial's over because the prosecutor has evidence one of the witnesses lied under oath. In *that* case, sure—we wouldn't say the charge was brought "because of" or "to illuminate" the initial trial issue, as the trial is over.
31/ Moreover, in any false statements case you might ever think of—*including* the Papadopoulos and Flynn cases whose defendants, dates and particulars Alan already misrepresented—the fact was hidden in the first place *because* of the underlying conduct the defendant engaged in.
30/ The last of these—the mid-investigation false statements charge—*isn't* brought because a prosecutor feels *put out*, but because (by law) a witness has lied about a "material fact" that's "relevant to the ongoing probe." So you bring a new charge *to get at the hidden fact*.
29/ But let's go back to the three examples I just gave: a post-trial perjury charge, post-investigation/pre-trial witness tampering charge, and a mid-investigation false statements charge. *No* attorney who's *ever* investigated a case would put these charges in the same basket.
28/ To Alan, a "process crime"—in the context of his analysis of Mueller's investigation—is a crime that is brought by Mueller *simply* because someone in Trump's orbit messed with him somehow. Alan wants you to believe that these are not *substantive*, *Russia-related* charges.
27/ To Alan, these charges all fall into the category of "process crimes"—by which he means they're not about Mueller's probe of Trump-Russia collusion (1/3rd of his brief per his DOJ appointment letter). You can read that letter—it seems Alan hasn't—here: https://t.co/t9EPelHsBJ
26/ To explain: consider the difference between a perjury charge against a witness after a trial's ended; a witness tampering charge against a non-witness after an investigation is over but pre-trial; and a false statements charge brought in the midst of a criminal investigation.
25/ Alan identifies 3 categories of indictment he says reveal the paltry fruits—and bad faith—of Mueller's work. These categories don't exist in the law, but worse—as a matter of teleology—they've nothing to do with how lawyers assess investigative inquiries or criminal charges.
24/ But Alan saves his biggest fibs for his "process crimes" argument: an argument so wrong on the facts, law, and analysis of facts and law that it *materially undermines* Americans' understanding of the rule of law—a cardinal sin for public statements by high-profile attorneys.
23/ So one of the "non-Americans" Alan wants you to ignore—under the theory he has *nothing* to do with Trump—claims credit for *negotiating* a universally-lied-about pro-Kremlin campaign gambit *Trump's own team says* Trump was the Trump-side manager for. How's *that*for a link?
22/ And Trump not only lied about his involvement, but aided and abetted Gordon and Manafort in lying about theirs. And do you know *who* took credit in August 2016 for having negotiated the pro-Kremlin RNC platform change with Trump's campaign? That's right: Konstantin Kilimnik.
21/ Gordon further made clear he was on the line to Trump Tower getting marching orders on the RNC platform change while it was happening. And once the change was made, Gordon lied about his involvement. Manafort lied about his involvement. And *Trump* lied about his involvement.
20/ According Business Insider, CNN, and the number-two man on the Trump campaign's National Security Advisory Committee, J.D. Gordon, Trump *ordered* the RNC platform shift on Ukraine (which benefitted Putin) on March 31, 2016, at his hotel in DC. 96 hours after hiring Manafort.
19/ But wait! you say. Does this involve Trump? (Not that it'd *have* to to contradict Alan's thesis, but let's still look at this question—just for the lulz.) Answer: yes, Kilimnik is *absolutely* connected to Trump himself based on public reporting about the RNC platform shift.
18/ Manafort spoke with Kilimnik about giving *proprietary internal polling data* to the Kremlin; about giving *private briefings on Trump's campaign-eyes-only strategies* to the Kremlin; and about receiving *illicit monies from Russian sources* in exchange for this *collusion*.
17/ In fact, one of the many Russians Mueller indicted is Konstantin Kilimnik, the Oleg Deripaska agent—i.e., the *Kremlin* agent, as Deripaska boasts of being "one with the State"—who Paul Manafort, Trump's Campaign Manager, communicated with regularly during the 2016 election.
16/ What Alan wants you to believe—along with his legions of adoring but quite candidly hallucinating conservative fans who, to their own detriment, deny the reality of what Mueller's uncovering daily—is that the "non-Americans" Mueller has indicted have nothing to do with Trump.
15/ Needless to say, I won't dispute Alan's claim Mueller has charged non-Americans with crimes—as not only has Mueller done that, he's done it *over and over and quite impressively*. He deserves kudos for it. But Alan *implies* something with this claim that is grievously wrong.
14/ Not even a first-year law student would call Pinedo and Cohen's crimes "unrelated" to the Russia investigation, and needless to say their nationalities and the dates of their offenses are basic public data even a non-attorney would spot immediately with a basic Google search.
13/ So Alan is already *egregiously* wrong on *4 counts*. That's so many errors that we can put aside any thought that Alan—one of the most respected and experienced attorneys in America—just made an oopsie. No: his omissions present a *pattern of deception*. They are deliberate.
12/ Lest you say, "OK—but Mueller wasn't planning on investigating *that* election fraud involving Trump!", hold your horses: Mueller encountered the Cohen crimes in the context of determining if Cohen received *illegal foreign campaign donations from Russians* on Trump's behalf.
11/ The Cohen charges go *directly* to whether Trump engaged in a fraudulent conspiracy to win election, and under no circumstances are a "financial crime" unrelated (as Dershowitz implies) to one of Mueller's briefs—to investigate whether the Trump campaign conspired in a fraud.
10/ While Cohen was convicted in the SDNY (a separate federal jurisdiction from Mueller's D.C. jurisdiction) *it was in a case Mueller handed off to the SDNY*, so it *is* very much a product of Mueller's efforts. And it's not a "financial crime" in the sense Alan means that term.
9/ A fourth American charged with pre-Mueller appointment crimes that aren't "financial crimes" in the "unrelated to Trump-Russia" sense Alan means it is Michael Cohen. A tough conviction to miss—but it's the fourth "miss" by Dershowitz in his blanket claim about Mueller's work.
8/ But of course Pinedo—an American accused of pre-Mueller appointment crimes—was charged and convicted of selling bank account numbers to Russians which were then used in Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Pinedo is now a cooperating witness in Mueller's investigation.
7/ Alan uses the phrase "financial crimes" as a cudgel against Mueller—that is, he means something *very* specific by it. To Alan, such a crime (in the context of Mueller's work) is a crime that has nothing to do with Russian collusion but rather unrelated financial transactions.
6/ A lesser-known Mueller conviction (but still one someone of Alan's status and visibility should know) is Richard Pinedo, an American charged with crimes committed from 2014 through 2017. And Pinedo's crimes *weren't* "financial crimes" in the way Alan means that term here.
5/ Mike Flynn is an American who committed his crime pre-May 2017, and Flynn *also* wasn't charged with a financial crime. Flynn committed his crime during the same month that George Papadopoulos did, in January 2017. Anyone who knows anything of the Trump-Russia case knows this.
4/ Papadopoulos committed his crime in January '17. Anyone who knows anything about the Trump-Russia case knows this. I can't conceive of a world in which Alan is brought on TV as often as he is to discuss the Trump-Russia case and somehow *doesn't* know this. But that's not all.
3/ George Papadopoulos is an American who committed the crime Mueller charged him with pre-May '17—and it wasn't a financial crime. So already Alan's claim—that all Mueller indictments fall into one of 3 categories—is demonstrably false. And frankly it wasn't hard to demonstrate.
2/ Special Counsel Bob Mueller was appointed in May 2017. According to Alan Dershowitz, *none* of Mueller's indictments are of Americans who committed their crimes prior to May 2017—*unless* (Alan says) the crimes in question were "financial crimes." This is factually incorrect.
1/ First, here's what Alan publicly wrote me earlier today via tweet: "Mueller crimes fit into three categories: process crimes that occurred after he was appointed; financial crimes unrelated to the Russia investigation; and crimes by non-Americans." Every part of this is wrong.

5/ I'm not saying this did or didn't happen; I just want to confirm we have no evidence yet on whether this is/isn't what happened. Because if it did happen, it would certainly fit with what we know about the Stone/Manafort relationship and the strange story of Manafort's hiring.
4/ In other words, if Stone was trying to get Manafort hired by Trump in March 2016; and if Manafort met Assange in March 2016; and if the hack occurred in March 2016; how do we know Trump didn't hire Manafort precisely *because* he had a lead on "Hillary's emails" via WikiLeaks?
3/ I guess what I'm asking is, how we do know Manafort didn't learn from Assange that the emails had been stolen when/if he met him in March 2016, immediately tell his old business partner Stone, and then Stone told someone (WP) in "spring 2016"...perhaps long *before* June/July?
2/ Mueller's "in or around June and July 2016" certainly COULD include "spring" dates, but nothing in the Mueller indictment confirms for us that these two events are the same event. The hack occurred on March 21, 2016; Manafort (per THE GUARDIAN) visited Assange in "March 2016."

@AggressiveDem Right, but SDNY is in an info-sharing arrangement with Mueller as to non-campaign finance matters, as I understand it, so Christie saying SDNY "instead of" (or similar words) Mueller as a threat to Trump is literally wrong on the facts, as Mueller is investigating Trump Org also.

(NOTE2) For instance, let's say Saudi Arabia, UAE, Israel, Egypt, Bahrain, Russia, and the Trumps secretly agreed to remake the geopolitics of the Middle East. Some criminality may end up arising in such a conspiratorial plot; *other* parts of it will merely be morally grotesque.
(NOTE) Less pessimistically, some of the confusion arises in the difference between conspiracy as a legal term and a lay one. A lay conspiracy is a secret agreement; an illegal conspiracy is a secret agreement that's also criminal as to all co-conspirators and chargeable as such.
(PS) Some of the confusion between the "grand bargain" investigative theory of the Trump-Russia case and the idea almost no one's put forward of a "grand conspiracy" is propagated by those aiming to discredit people who discuss Trump-Russia on Twitter. That's annoying, but life.
(2 of 2) A "grand bargain [partly criminal]" and "grand conspiracy [wholly criminal]" are different concepts. I've anticipated conspiracy or aiding/abetting charges against a *small* group, charges of *some* kind against 12-15, and a grand bargain that has some criminal elements.
(1 of 2) I saw something strange on Twitter today: the idea that those attorneys who see criminality in elements of the "grand bargain" major media has written of are *also* claiming Mueller will *charge* a "grand conspiracy." This is a misunderstanding by folks who are confused.

I admire @JeffreyToobin to an almost unhealthy degree—*by which I simply mean* that he's one of the few people on television who I can *always* watch without getting annoyed or feeling disappointed. His is a fine mind and he's an indispensable commentator. https://t.co/K55h2NNxYu
CONCLUSION/ Any lawyer or investigator who's ever worked a case can see that Trump's a career criminal who committed crimes here with the help of 12-15 Americans over a two-year period. We can briefly muse on the 1-in-1000 chance it isn't so, but to do more is irresponsible. /end
20/ And I will say again that *if that turns out to be the case* it will be a *great day for America* because it will mean that no American on or connected to the Trump campaign did anything wrong during the election besides lying about every single event that occurred during it.
19/ As a lawyer, I *have* to admit the possibility—the 1 in 1000 odds—that the federal case with the most inculpatory evidence any American has seen in their lifetime is in fact *hundreds* of completely disconnected data-points that point to criminality but somehow fall just shy.
18/ If Mueller *were* weeks from being done, it'd necessarily mean that there was no criminal conspiracy—and that the hundreds of data points catalogued by legal experts, all the months and years of lying and secret meetups and clandestine deals, actually meant *nothing*. At all.
17/ Because all I care about is facts—on an emotional level (which I try to ignore) my interest would be in having this whole thing be over so I can get back to my life—I'll note the implication of the alternative proposition, that the AG meant "weeks" and is right about Mueller.
16/ ...that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as we—as soon as possible." That's what Whitaker said, with all words/pauses included. It reads entirely differently than how it was presented by the AP and others—as a clear, confident declamation on Mueller's work.
15/ What Whitaker said: "I'm, uh, you know, comfortable that, uh, the decisions that were made are going to be, ah, reviewed, uh, yeah, either through the various means we have, but right now the investigation is, uh, I think, uh, close to {pause} being completed, and I hope...
14/ Indicator 20 (and truly, this one indicator includes so many different lines of inquiry that have shown up on the national radar screen in just the last 60 days that I could only scratch the surface here—and didn't even reference the new "process crimes" Trump commits daily): https://t.co/ksrgw4ygL8
13/ Indicators 18 and 19 (apologies for the reference to Dershowitz but I think a lot of people reading this feed wouldn't believe that there's *any* attorney in America claiming that "all Mueller has" is so-called "process crimes" if I didn't name at least one person saying so): https://t.co/jnn8KoMSvd
12/ Indicators 16 and 17 (note that "2018" in the last sentence here should be "2019"): https://t.co/lBxwHFe9xS
11/ Indicators 13, 14, and 15: https://t.co/G4nFS2teta
10/ Indicators 10, 11, and 12: https://t.co/HJXaoCz5qi
9/ Indicators 7, 8, and 9: https://t.co/YO1CtzpSS8
8/ Indicators 4, 5, and 6 (all text written by me): https://t.co/dvVrAEyHQF
7/ Indicators 1, 2, and 3: https://t.co/bCVrImJQgx
6/ And that's the final point I'll make before I get to the twenty indicators that Mueller has months of work to do: that we actually have no idea what "close" would mean in this context, so all the journalists out there assuming it means "weeks" are just jumping to a conclusion.
5/ POLITICO today called Mueller's "ever-expanding"—and indeed even if we take Whitaker's words at face value, in the context of a federal probe that's *two and a half years old*, even being *six months* from completion would be *close*. So for all we know, Whitaker meant *that*.
4/ Whitaker is therefore repeating the Trump *party line*—Mueller is almost done—which has been reported *seven times before* over a period of a *year* and has been *wrong every time*. Whitaker, who's been investigated for fraud, is as not-credible as any AG America has ever had.
3/ And everything from Whitaker *must* come with a mountain of salt: he was, pre-AG, a Trump plant at DOJ briefing Trump about the Russia probe behind Sessions' back, and pre-AG he said, in effect, that the probe was legitimate. DOJ ethics gurus suggested he recuse and he didn't.
2/ You also need to know that Whitaker is getting his Mueller info secondhand, via briefings by Rosenstein—who, contrary to erroneous early November 2018 reports, *is* still overseeing the Mueller probe until he leaves DOJ. Meanwhile, Whitaker will be *out* as soon as Barr is in.
1/ A note: please do *not* read this thread without watching the below (very short) YouTube video *first*. You cannot understand why Whitaker's comment is unusual, possibly *not* news, and likely inaccurate until you see the context in which it was made. https://t.co/VqBzoKck1b
(THREAD) Here are 20 indications that Mueller has *months* of work left to do. I write this thread in the shadow of a vague, hesitant, afterthought-like remark that AG Whitaker made today. I hope you'll read on and retweet; this may be the most important issue before the country. https://t.co/vQTa12cMzl
7/ Reporters of course had to report what Whitaker said—and equally "of course" they had to provide the context for the statement *and* (because it was so extraordinary) the way in which it was delivered, which changes *entirely* how one would receive it compared to the AP story.
6/ ...as we—as soon as possible." All of the above said haltingly, while perspiring and with a hesitant tone. But then AP and MSNBC and others report this out as "right now the investigation is close to being completed" as though Whitaker was giving a prepared address on Mueller.
5/ ...the decisions that were made are going to be, ah, reviewed, uh, yeah, either through the various means we have, but right now the investigation is, uh, I think, uh, close to {pause} being completed, and I hope that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon {cont.}
4/ ...the final report and I, ah, really am not going to talk about, uh, an open and ongoing investigation otherwise but sort of the statements that I made were as a private citizen, only with publicly available information, ah, and, I'm, uh, you know, comfortable that, uh {cont}
3/ How about the fact Whitaker was clearly unprepared for the question and that his remark (the purported news in all this) came at the end of a sentence he couldn't figure out how to finish delicately? "You know I look forward to, ah, Director Mueller, um, delivering... {cont.}
2/ Does Ken underscore that Rod Rosenstein (contrary to erroneous early November 2018 reporting) is *still in charge of the Mueller probe*, so Whitaker is only getting *second-hand* briefings? No, as that would undercut how much we can trust Whitaker here. https://t.co/SNEglvSXCO https://t.co/6pciLC9KmT
I feel like @KenDilanianNBC tweeted the "news" about Whitaker's remark *seven times* without once posting the video because if you watch the video the comment seems vague, an afterthought, hesitant, and basically nothing like the major news that Ken avers. https://t.co/VqBzoKck1b

VIDEO/ Boy, I've got to say, when you watch the full video of what Whitaker said (at an unrelated press conference) it really isn't very convincing as a major news story on the duration of the Mueller probe.		I think the media is going to look bad on this. https://t.co/kDrsRRfBma
NOTE/ It's reasonable for regular observers of the Mueller probe to be taking note right now of who credits Whitaker's vague words and who doesn't. But it'll also be my responsibility, if I'm wrong, which I'm not, to acknowledge the reality of what Mueller has chosen *not* to do.

PS5/ I also try as best I can to put the interests of the country ahead of my own interests, because in a time of national emergency I feel it's my duty to do that as an attorney who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. I *know* wanting this all to be over is just selfish.
PS4/ I mention this last piece just to underscore that when I give my assessment of Mueller's probe, it's *always* based on the facts. If it were based on emotion, I'd honestly say I just want this whole thing to be over so I can get back to the rest of my life. That's the truth.
PS3/ I also want to be transparent and say that while I don't think Mueller is within a month of being done and do believe it'd be horrible for America if he were, as it'd mean many crimes will go unpunished, it'd be amazing for me personally as I could go back to my normal life.
PS2/ And I do feel compelled to add that anyone who's taking these vague comments to mean Mueller has under a month left simply has not been following the Trump-Russia case or the leads Mueller is still pursuing *or* literally has no faith in our rule of law. I'm in neither camp.
PS/ My opinion is that it's irresponsible to report this offhand statement outgoing AG/Trump plant Whitaker made at an unrelated press conference and just leave it to readers' imagination as to what "I think" and "close" could mean. It could literally mean "six months...*maybe*."
5/ What I'm saying is that the number of facts we have at our disposal telling us that Mueller is within a month of completing his work is zero. Let me repeat: zero. The number of facts suggesting 4 to 6 months more work and indictments is over 100. Those are just the hard facts.
4/ Don Jr. and Prince lied to Congress. Mueller's grand jury was extended 6 months. Gates' sentencing was postponed at least 2 months. Cohen/Manafort cooperated for 100 hours to help Mueller get new indictments. Whitaker could be right if these and 100 similar facts mean nothing.
3/ Keep in mind, those who say the investigation is almost done are literally saying it'll be over in 2 to 3 weeks, despite Stone just getting indicted and Cohen just getting new lawyers to assist in his cooperation with Mueller and Don Jr. saying he expects to be indicted &amp;c &amp;c.
2/ I don't know what kind of work the words "I think" are doing here, and given that the Russia investigation started two and a half years ago, "close" to done could easily mean six months, which is what most of us are predicting, so I'm seriously not sure if this is news or not.
Doesn't make any sense at all for this to be so, and I don't at all believe it's so, but the fact that a guy hired by Trump to deep-six Mueller's probe, who's about to lose his job, and who's been connected to fraudulent schemes says Mueller is nearly done is news. (Uh, I guess?) https://t.co/XXZT9aYVNI

20/ When we hear a counter-intuitive, counter-historical, counter-factual statement being made in conclusory fashion by a media figure, of *course* we assume bias or incompetence. That's *human*. Media needs to on occasion *see* their audience—*and* the whole field of data. /end
19/ Maybe Gloria, April and Dana are right about everything. But we've no evidence they are; it'd be counter-intuitive/counter-historical for them to be; and they're so confident in their analyses that—far from acknowledging how unlikely such reads are—they're being *conclusory*.
18/ I just... look. I *love* media. I love CNN. I'm a journalist and teach journalism at a research university. I want journalism to be at its best. But too many in the journalistic establishment are just *not seeing* why people of all political stripes are frustrated with them.
17/ Americans see no *evidence* any of this is true—indeed the *whole weight of the evidence in the Trump-Russia case so far*, and the *entire history of the American criminal justice system*, points us in a different direction—so they're right to be really frustrated with media.
16/ Most people know this. But we hear Gloria saying Stone has no utility to Mueller; April Ryan was on CNN saying "sources" said Mueller only wants Stone "for the truth" of the indictment he's now under; and Dana Bash says this was the last big development of the Mueller probe.
15/ But Mueller also has to think about ongoing lines of inquiry, upcoming prosecutions, other suspects—considerations that may cause him to say "I want Stone—or bigger fish—on conspiracy, but I *don't* want to charge that right now because it will hurt my efforts in other ways."
14/ For instance, Mueller is always thinking about how to forestall getting fired—and so-called "process crimes" don't scare Trump enough to get Mueller fired. Were I Mueller, I might want to bring as many of my "scary" charges at once as I could—to ensure Trump couldn't stop me.
13/ And I say all this without even *touching* on the many reasons Mueller might have brought only these charges—for *now*—and not others. Those reasons are all so obvious that anyone covering the Trump-Russia case really needs to have them down cold—ready at a moment's notice.
12/ It's in this context that Borger said that Stone having lied to prosecutors meant she "couldn't imagine" a prosecutor using him as a witness. That's such a basic misunderstanding of how our criminal justice system works *each day* that it really needed to be corrected on-air.
11/ So Mueller can squeeze Stone for info leading to other evidence, place him in a matrix of mutually corroborating testimonial and physical evidence, *and* make sure both Stone *and* jurors know the consequences of Stone (and his—in that instance—corroborating witnesses) lying.
10/ Cooperators face perjury charges *and* loss of any forbearance they've gotten from prosecutors on other charges. And there are other ways a prosecutor can hurt someone who welches on a deal. And don't forget that the prosecutor usually has other evidence of what the truth is.
9/ The reason juries believe cooperators every day in US courts—despite the only sometimes successful efforts of defense lawyers to discredit them—is that when a witness gets on the stand they know that they can be charged with a *felony* for lying. It's *worse* for a cooperator.
8/ And Gloria knows—from intermittently covering criminal cases during her career as a political analyst—that juries are asked to believe those who've cut deals (even for lying) *every day in America*. And she knows juries *believe* those witnesses *every day*, and she knows why.
7/ But she *also* knows that neither Stone, Credico, nor Corsi would *ever* be put on a witness stand in a case like this without Mueller having found a *mountain* of other evidence—to be clear, not that the law requires it—confirming the testimonial evidence of these three guys.
6/ And Gloria—who's been following the Trump-Russia story as her main job for two years—knows this. For instance, she knows Stone would be placed within (*at a minimum*) a Stone-Corsi-Credico matrix of mutually confirming testimonial evidence—three men agreeing with one another.
5/ But let's say Mueller *did* want Stone as a witness. Would he—as Borger implies—simply plop Stone on a witness stand and tell his jury, "There's my case"? Of *course not*. Stone would be situated within a massive, convincing matrix of mutually reinforcing inculpatory evidence.
4/ First, it's possible Mueller wants Stone for *information* that could lead to new physical or testimonial evidence—and *not* primarily for his own testimony. We already have {*checks notes*} a gazillion reasons that Stone might have information that could lead to new evidence.
3/ Journalists don't even seem to understand the *basics* of building a criminal case. Borger said Mueller could never want Stone as a witness in *any* case because he has credibility issues. My god—there are so many things wrong with that statement from an attorney's standpoint.
2/ I just heard Gloria Borger—not an attorney—say on CNN that she "can't imagine" that Mueller wants Stone for *any* purpose other than to be prosecuted for *exactly* what he's now been charged with. In other words, there is no information Stone has that Mueller could want.		Wow.
Every attorney on social media who knows even the first thing about the Trump-Russia investigation has already given a slough of reasons as to why Mueller might do this. I can think of 5+ offhand. Any journalist (even a non-attorney) covering Trump-Russia should be able to, also. https://t.co/P9pCaedk76

(PS) And yes—to cut the dramatic irony off at the pass—I know we lawyers are often *not* better than this. But the Trump-Russia case has offered attorneys around the country a chance to *step up* and aid the country in understanding what's happening. Alan is doing the *opposite*.
(5) Imagine how little you *and* your audience have to know about the facts of the Trump-Russia case for you to say something like what @AlanDersh said. It's so counterfactual that it makes me ashamed to share a profession with Alan. Lawyers are supposed to be *better* than this.
(4) More broadly, *all* the Russians that Special Counsel Mueller indicted committed crimes before May 2017, and nearly all the Gates and Manafort crimes happened before May 2017, and Papadopoulos' crime occurred before May 2017—I mean what the *hell* is Dershowitz talking about?
(3) Trump conspiring with Cohen to offer Putin a $50 million penthouse in a yet-to-be-constructed Trump Tower Moscow after he was aware Russia was committing ongoing federal crimes is somehow not criminal? Dershowitz may be the least-informed lawyer in America on the Russia case.
(1) Dershowitz has *no idea* what Mueller has found, and knows it.	(2) Dershowitz needs to read PROOF OF COLLUSION—as all the evidence of crimes he could want is in it. Trump lying to federal agents about Russia on August 17, 2016 at a classified briefing is somehow not criminal? https://t.co/5aAIsMQrTH

RT @kylegriffin1: 6 in 10 Americans say House Democrats should obtain and release Trump's tax returns, according to a new ABC/WaPo poll.
PS10/ But more than any of that, my experience as a journalist, editor, and professor who teaches journalism tells me that when you have a story of this sort, you don't *pretend it doesn't exist*—you discuss it openly and transparently to analyze it and expose it from all angles.
PS9/ My experience as an investigator and criminal defense attorney teaches me that when a story has multiple sources, convincing details, and fits perfectly a theory of case that is *already robustly supported* by hundreds of data-points, there's a good chance the story is true.
PS8/ When I post a thread like this, those who aren't regular readers say things like, "He's saying he *knows* this or that happened"—in this case, that I *know* THE GUARDIAN is right. I don't. But I know its story fits the evidence, and we should be talking about Manafort/Stone.
PS7/ Readers of this feed understand what it is—it uses curatorial journalism to try to point the media in the direction of possibly fruitful future research. And this feed has successfully done that many times and with major media outlets. So don't mistake this thread's purpose.
PS6/ It's not insignificant here that—per Manafort's lawyers—Mueller thinks Trump is lying about a) his contacts with Manafort and b) secret meetings Manafort attended. The one we *know* of is June '16, but it's little stretch to think there may be others. https://t.co/Q4es0xOcTg
PS5/ For a year, I've said the *biggest* mystery of all is why Trump was so clear with friends— per NBC—that it was *Manafort* who could end him, and then *Manafort* began making choices no defendant would ever make. And *Manafort* is Stone's second-closest associate after Trump.
PS4/ But as there is far more evidence Harding is right than wrong, and as his story was implicitly corroborated days later by a major Manafort-Assange revelation—which also implied Trump was using Manafort as an agent involving Assange—we at least need to *speak* about Manafort.
PS3/ So media is spending hundreds of hours daily discussing the Stone indictment without giving Americans the context in which it arises—because they don't want to say the name of Stone's closest associate (Manafort) with respect to Stone, due to *vague fears* Harding was wrong.
PS2/ Note, too, that Manafort told Barrack he "had to get to Trump"—as though he knew he'd have value to him well before he was hired. That would be readily explained by 2013 and 2015 trips to visit Assange and ties to Kremlin agents—who began working on their Trump plan in 2013.
PS/ A longer thread would have discussed in detail that it's Stone and Manafort who have acted the *most* bizarrely of any Trump-Russia defendants, and that both men are angling the *hardest* of anyone for a Trump pardon—as though they can hurt Trump the most and they/he know it.
50/ I'm saying Stone knew earlier than almost anyone that WikiLeaks was willing to be a conduit for dirty tricks—and it was Stone who got [the allegedly WikiLeaks-linked] Manafort his Trump job. And Trump says *Manafort* is his biggest danger. So we need to talk about this. /end
49/ I'm saying that if—as many assume from the odd use of the passive voice in Mueller's indictment—it was Trump who "directed" a senior campaign official to talk to Stone about WikiLeaks, and did so while Manafort was his campaign manager, Manafort likely knew it was happening.
48/ I'm not suggesting Stone or Manafort knew of Russian hacking in March 2016—it's certain that neither did. I'm saying Stone and Manafort were busy making a case to Trump about Manafort's value at a time THE GUARDIAN says Manafort had access to WikiLeaks. And that's *relevant*.
47/ A *big* missing piece in the Trump-Russia timeline is *why* Trump let his "delegate counter" immediately take over his campaign. Who'd convinced Trump that Manafort had *so* much to offer that Trump should turn over his campaign to him immediately? And *how did they do that*?
46/ The millions-in-fees-per-year Manafort was allegedly hired by Trump (for free) in March 2016 as a delegate counter for a convention—the Republican National Convention—Trump didn't yet know he'd be the nominee at. Yet mysteriously, Manafort *took over his campaign* in 2 weeks.
45/ And keep in mind that Stone was certainly talking to *Manafort* in March 2016—and *specifically* talking with Manafort about how to make his pitch to Trump. So if Manafort had WikiLeaks insight, he surely would've shared it with Stone then—and Stone shared it with Trump then.
44/ So THE GUARDIAN puts Manafort in WikiLeaks' orbit *while* Trump is talking with Stone *about Manafort and what he adds to Trump's campaign*.		Now Mueller has Trump, Manafort, or Bannon either talking with Stone about WikiLeaks or directing someone else to—just 120 days later.
43/ But let's return to Harding's GUARDIAN reporting, which says that Manafort met with Assange in March '16—coincidentally, *right as he was negotiating with Trump* about joining the Trump campaign and *right as Stone was also negotiating with Trump* about Trump hiring Manafort.
42/ So Manafort has already lied about Assange—as he secretly did things relating to Assange that he hid from everyone for a year and a half. And that's on top of all the other lies he's told. (And remember that when I say "WikiLeaks denies it, too," that's just Assange talking.)
41/ Here's a NYT report—days after Harding's news in THE GUARDIAN—saying Manafort was secretly negotiating Assange's release to federal authorities in spring '17. Who could possibly have given him authority to negotiate on behalf of Trump's administration? https://t.co/Uh63BGCOYi
40/ And what if I told you that the news story in question further implies that Manafort's secret overseas contacts relating to Assange came under the aegis of his ongoing secret connection to Trump following Manafort's "firing"—done purely for PR purposes—in mid-August of 2016?
39/ What if I told you that days after Manafort denied meeting with Assange, evidence emerged showing that Manafort has *indeed* made at least one secret trip abroad since 2013 that relates directly to Assange? Wouldn't that be interesting evidence Harding was on the right track?
38/ I'll compare and contrast the POLITICO article to *real* evidence that corroborates Harding's work (because apparently US media is confused about what sort of responsible journalism is even *capable* of corroborating—or else tending to cast doubt on—the work of THE GUARDIAN).
37/ That's right! POLITICO has a big article whose title makes you *think* that US media has *evidence* that Harding was duped. But guess what? The article's just an editorial that speculates offhandedly about its subject matter with *no evidence whatsoever* to back up its title.
36/ But just because US media, which of course *doesn't know the top-notch UK sources UK media has*—and has no background with or access to many of them—can't reproduce UK reporting is no grounds for *baseless conjecture* like what US media did to Harding: https://t.co/wA5I49L0kb
35/ There are *whole Trump-Russia lines of inquiry* reported in the UK that you can't find in the US. Is it because they're minor? No—many have to do with *Russian kompromat on Trump*. It's because US media doesn't have UK media's sources, so they can't confirm all their stories.
34/ For my book PROOF OF COLLUSION, I reviewed major-media investigative reports from *many* countries, and the UK was one of them. I can't tell you how many scoops UK media had about Trump-Russia events relevant to the UK (or that occurred in the UK) that US media *didn't* have.
33/ So we're left with the idea that reporting by a top UK media outlet with sources in high places in the UK that no one in US media would have has reported something about events in the UK that US media can't confirm via *its* sources. Do you know how *frequently* that happens?
32/ An equally stupid reason to toss Harding's reporting is Glenn Greenwald—essentially a spokesman for Assange who's gambled his career as a journalist on there being no Trump-Russia collusion whatsoever—says it's *likely* wrong. That's right—he's not even sure. So much for him.
31/ The second-stupidest reason to toss Harding's report is Manafort and WikiLeaks—the first a criminal and liar, the second a criminal entity that has repeatedly lied—deny the story. If you had a dollar for every true Trump-Russia story the principals have denied, you'd be rich.
30/ Manafort has more than three passports. Not sure how much more than this needs to be said.
29/ Let's start with the *worst* reason to toss Harding's reporting—this idea that Manafort, who we know has a damn *drawerful* of passports, didn't go to London in 2013, 2015 or 2016 (on trips he would've had to be *very* secretive about) because his "3 passports" don't show it.
28/ (This despite the fact that everyone now agrees the Stone indictment gets Mueller closer to Trump himself colluding than anything else—more even than Cohen's charges—and that Trump, for his part, has said, per NBC reporting, that *Manafort* poses the greatest danger to him.)
27/ It's on *these* flimsy grounds—I'll show you just how flimsy they are in a moment—that Harding's reporting has been tossed by US media. And the result of that collective decision among US media is that Manafort hasn't been raised with respect to the Stone indictment at *all*.
26/ The case *against* Harding's story being true:		1. Manafort/WikiLeaks deny it. (They would—and are both proven liars.)	2. Assange flack Glenn Greenwald denies it (Again, he would—for 100 reasons.)	3. Other outlets can't confirm it.	4. Manafort's "three passports."		That's it.
25/ Harding also has evidence Manafort regularly flew to London. That's become a point of contention (you'll see why in a moment) but it's worth noting here that Luke Harding has in the past appeared to have contacts in British intelligence. You'll see the relevance of that soon.
24/ At least one of Harding's witnesses claims to be a percipient witness of some kind—someone who either saw Manafort at the Ecuadorian embassy in London visiting Assange at the time or who has reviewed the security footage. We know this because Manafort's clothing is described.
23/ Beyond Harding's bona fides generally *and* on this subtopic—and the reputation of THE GUARDIAN—we have Harding saying he has "multiple" sources *and* saying that Ecuadorian intelligence has documents listing "Paul Manaford [sic]" as an Assange visitor in 2013, 2015 and 2016.
22/ So let's see what indicia of reliability we find in this story in THE GUARDIAN—which alleges that Manafort secretly met with Assange in 2013, 2015, and 2016. We have to conduct this assessment because significant doubt has been cast on Harding's reporting (more on that soon).
21/ So Harding has gravitas on Assange and collusion, and not only works for one of the top outlets in the UK but one that's (a) the world's longstanding go-to for Assange news (because it's worked with him before), and (b) broken significant news before in the Trump-Russia case.
20/ First, understand that the author of the piece, Luke Harding, is *highly* respected in UK media (feel free to Google it). Moreover, not only did he write an entire *book* on Julian Assange, he also wrote the first significant book (by a *mile*, too) on Trump-Russia collusion.
19/ So here's the major story from THE GUARDIAN—a top UK media outlet—that no one wants to touch, even though VANITY FAIR and other US publications have said would be the biggest scoop of 2018 if it's true. I'll break down everything about this story here. https://t.co/Voxii81F5I
18/ But we actually *know* the reason the media won't talk about Manafort with respect to Assange—because it's *terrified* to do so, as discussing Manafort as a possible Trump-Stone intermediary on WikiLeaks would force discussion of a December 2016 story *no one* wants to touch.
17/ Yet despite all this—and despite Stone and Manafort's long association and Stone's role in getting Manafort his job—you may have noticed that no one is really talking about Manafort as being involved in any way in the July 2016 goings on at the Trump campaign. That's bizarre.
16/ Bannon's October email to Stone ("well done") is being taken as proof that, 3 months earlier, he was the person who contacted Stone, but other evidence from October—an email in which Bannon seems to dismiss the importance of any WikiLeaks foreknowledge—points a different way.
15/ Either Trump or Kushner was the director—ordering around someone else on the list—or else we've got a problem, as it's hard to imagine anyone else but Bannon or Manafort being high enough in the staff to order another senior campaign official around (and Bannon is a stretch).
14/ Of course the further down that list of seven people you go, the less likely it is that that person is the "director," as they need to—per the Stone indictment—*not* be so low in the senior campaign staff that they don't have a "senior campaign official" left to order around.
13/ Some other people you might think of as the "director" either weren't in official campaign roles (Mike Flynn, Trump Jr.) or hadn't yet reached the heights of the campaign that they subsequently would (Kellyanne Conway) or had by then been demoted or fired (Corey Lewandowski).
12/ The list of men who could be the "director" would seem to include these seven:		Donald Trump	Jared Kushner	Paul Manafort	Steve Bannon	Rick Gates	Sam Clovis	Eric Trump*		*Only because reports indicate (incredibly) that Eric was one of the men "actually" running the campaign.
11/ But whether it was Trump "direct[ing]" Manafort ("senior campaign official") to contact Stone, or Manafort directing Bannon to contact Stone—which he could do, as he outranked Bannon then—the number of people who could have been involved in *any* of this is vanishingly small.
10/ Manafort was running Trump's campaign until August 19, 2016; the "senior campaign official" contacted Stone around July 22, 2016. Still, many guess that Steve Bannon was the "senior campaign official"—because we know he later emailed Stone in October about his WikiLeaks info.
9/ So when the Stone indictment tells us that a "senior campaign official" was in contact with Stone in late July '16 at the "direct[ion]" of someone else in the Trump campaign—necessarily either a more senior campaign official or Trump himself—Manafort and Trump fit those bills.
8/ Stone and Manafort were business partners for *many* years. Stone *got Manafort his job* with Trump (with help from Trump friend Tom Barrack). Stone is famous for his belief in "political dirty tricks"—and developed that belief as part of a political consultancy with Manafort.
7/ Just taking the indictment on its face, anyone who has been following the Trump-Russia investigation would have assumed that Paul Manafort was Stone's primary contact—besides Trump—at the Trump campaign. The reasons for this are almost too many to name, but I'll mention a few.
6/ Whatever his reasoning, it's clear Mueller has a wealth of information that would be relevant to and probative in a prosecution against Stone for charges beyond what he faces now, so America is faced with *many* questions about who Stone coordinated with at the Trump campaign.
5/ Third, he might not want to turn over discovery to Stone—"discovery," a legal term, comprises certain investigative materials a defendant is entitled to see pre-trial—on the subject of a Trump-WikiLeaks conspiracy, either to protect sources and methods or future prosecutions.
4/ Second, he might be strategically holding back as part of his upcoming negotiations with Stone about—presumably—Stone being a cooperating witness. Stone admits to speaking with Trump regularly during the president campaign, so we already know he has information to offer there.
3/ There are many reasons that Mueller might indicate he could bring conspiracy or other charges against Stone but not charge Stone with those offenses. First, he doesn't have to when he's bringing charges of this sort (obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements).
2/ The Stone indictment, which of course contains only a fraction of the evidence Mueller has on Stone, seems to lay the groundwork for additional charges down the line should Stone not cooperate with Mueller—which is likely what Mueller really wants here. https://t.co/4Yb1FFDgzC
1/ We all know Stone faces 7 federal charges that could put him in prison for 20 years or more (though the federal guidelines suggest somewhere between a low of 15 to 21 months and a high of 41 to 51 months is more likely)—but what's as interesting is what he wasn't charged with.
(THREAD) Now that Roger Stone, one of Trump's oldest advisers and pals, has been accused of (but not yet indicted for) being a Team Trump-WikiLeaks go-between, it's time to revisit late 2018 allegations that Paul Manafort—Stone's oldest business partner—was too. Read on for more. https://t.co/A6n15aZHgr
"The WikiLeaks-Trump campaign association adds a juicy subplot to the ever-expanding Mueller probe—and legal experts say that coupled with Stone’s upcoming case could mean the special counsel still has many months to go before wrapping up his investigation."

6/ Far more likely is that Christie is not being exact with his language here, and is using the word "meeting" carelessly. It sounds as though the purpose of this scene in the book is to establish Trump as an affable and naive political neophyte, rather than to report out facts.
5/ And on the other hand, if Trump was indeed referring to these 2015 Flynn-Russia meetings in explaining his firing of Flynn, it would suggest that these 2015 meetings had a *meaning* to Trump that at present we have no evidence to suggest they do. Maybe media should follow up?
4/ Flynn *did* meet with the Russian ambassador in December 2015, and did meet with Putin in December 2015, but the chances Trump was referring to these meetings in February 2017 is nil. That is, there may be news in this Christie book if people actually believe what he's saying.
@DTrumpJrJunior Exactly, see thread
3/ Remember that what got Flynn in trouble were *phone calls* in December 2016, not meetings. So if Trump was referring to a "meeting" as Christie claims he was, and that meeting *wasn't* one of the ones that Kushner condoned by attending, what the *hell* was Trump talking about?
2/ Indeed, if what Christie writes is true, it'd suggest Trump knows of a Flynn-Russia meeting we don't know of, because it would be insane for him to refer to one that Kushner was at, in front of Kushner, as a firing offense.		That's the real story Maggie should be reporting on.
I'm not buying anything coming out of this panegyric to Trump written by a close friend of his. The idea that Trump would sit at a table WITH KUSHNER talking about how Flynn meeting with Russians (which Flynn did WITH KUSHNER) is what led to Flynn's firing...sorry, it's too much. https://t.co/jxD0EgQ2fL

3/ If Trump is secretly offering a pardon to Stone of course all bets are off the table, but on the basis of the indictment itself and Stone's age and the quality of the prosecutorial team you'd normally expect what Stone is doing now publicly is merely negotiating a better deal.
2/ There is great value in speaking with attorneys who've worked with thousands of criminal defendants on a 1-on-1 basis. I think, generally, I'd trust an opinion about how a given defendant may think through a case from a defense attorney over a prosecutor 100 times out of 100.
Remember that time Stone was indicted and immediately after I said as a former criminal defense attorney that his claims he'd never plead guilty, credited by many former prosecutors on TV, shouldn't be?

3/ 2016 was a lesson for a great many of us, myself included: anything but a unified front in the face of a monster is a disaster. I hope this time we can all, myself included, find a way to support whoever we support in a way that risks no damage to the effort to unseat Trump.

4/ The pattern is this: have secret conversations via encrypted/other means with a vague plan to just smear anyone as a liar who finds out what you discussed. This simple (and stupid) plan would explain virtually everything bizarre that Roger Stone has said on TV in the last day.
3/ More evidence: Kushner meeting Kislyak in December 2016 to discuss a secret communications channel to the Kremlin the FBI and CIA couldn't overhear. Erik Prince seemingly convincing Trump that the deep state had bugged Trump Tower. So a very clear pattern emerges in all this.
2/ More evidence is that Kushner is Trump's top adviser and he regularly uses WhatsApp to talk to MBS in Saudi Arabia. More evidence again: Trump insisting on using cell devices not cleared for his use. These men think their secret conversations are secret and will stay that way.
More evidence that my read of Stone's bizarre TV denials is correct: the NYT here details his penchant for WhatsApp, which Kushner is also obsessed with. It sounds to me like Stone/Trump spoke regularly about WikiLeaks but by means they think untraceable. https://t.co/1vyuxV1g98

@ScottMStedman I didn't see the articles you wrote referencing Mirax, but if they're still editable make sure you have the dissolution date (if any) correct, that 2013 date I found is only confirmation Mirax didn't die in 2011, it may well have been around with a loose Sater affiliation in 2015
@ScottMStedman Indeed, for Felix to have brought a prospective Trump Tower Moscow deal to Cohen in August 2015, he would had to have been negotiating the possibility with Rozov in June or July '15 at the very latest. Rozov said "yes" pre-August, so that troubles that December date for a payoff.
@ScottMStedman I certainly agree that it *looks* like both Sater and Rozov left Mirax before 2015, though I'm not sure we can prove a negative by saying that the two men had nothing to do with each other until December of 2015 just because but no one's looked for it or yet been able to find it.

5/ I think people sometimes wrongly conflate being willing to speak to federal prosecutors to being a cooperating witness who's been granted some kind of immunity and has therefore spilled his guts to the government. We don't yet know the *character* of the questioning of Bannon.
4/ You may recall that Bannon used outrageously false justifications to avoid speaking to Congress, but ultimately was questioned by federal prosecutors. That was so long ago, however, that it does *not* preclude the possibility that he's become a Mueller target in the meantime.
3/ That said, Bannon being so *gleefully* the primary source for books like Fire and Fury suggests that either he's a fool (he isn't) or has so gregariously thrown Trump's campaign under the bus behind the scenes that he is indeed, also, one of Mueller's top investigative assets.
2/ Bannon was of course also involved with Cambridge Analytica, and the Russian disinformation Erik Prince put out days before the election on Breitbart, and much else, but unless he has been Mueller's chief secret cooperating witness for 18 months, he remains in legal jeopardy.
Bannon was involved in the Trump campaign-Stone communications. One of the biggest questions in the Mueller probe is whether Bannon is a target. If you know what Bannon was up to during and after the campaign with respect to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, that question answers itself.
lol https://t.co/9bAx1HDEKX
3/ The reason Mueller accused Stone of collusion without charging him with it is that he wants Stone's cooperation against Trump, Kushner, Prince, Bannon, Don Jr. or all of the above. So what he's done is let us and Stone see the tip of the iceberg as to how much evidence he has.
2/ Mueller had the option of bringing an indictment that didn't disclose Stone's collusion with a Russian cutout through an intermediary, and instead he chose to provide a wealth of information about not just Stone's collusion but also that of Trump's campaign. We *must* say so.
I think that US media needs to be very precise in how they talk about what's happened today. They need to say that while Roger Stone has not been CHARGED with colluding with a Russian cutout through an intermediary, he has been ACCUSED of doing so in a Special Counsel indictment.

If Trump directed a "senior campaign official" to coordinate with WikiLeaks through Stone—*or* if he knew that the person who so directed a senior campaign official was going to do so—we're looking at a conspiracy of silence over coordinating with WikiLeaks that goes to the top.
If Mueller knows that someone at the Trump campaign *directed* a "senior Trump campaign official" to do something, that information is likely coming from a Trump campaign official who is already cooperating. That narrows the list of possible sources on this issue *significantly*.

16/ My point is that if Stone flips on Trump, the amount of information we're going to get about not just what Stone was up to during the campaign but what Donald Trump himself *knew* Stone was up to will be absolutely staggering and a major nail in the case against Donald Trump.
15/ That a Trump campaign official immediately directed someone to reach out to Roger Stone after the first WikiLeaks leak in July '16 underscores the role that Stone must have been playing after his "firing," which was to work behind the scenes *on behalf of* the Trump campaign.
14/ A rather obscure note that I still feel compelled to make: when Roger Stone was allegedly "fired" from the Trump campaign in mid-2015, there were stories that ran saying that the firing was a sham and the plan was to have Stone operate for Trump independently of the campaign.
13/ I wonder whether Mueller already has or soon will go back to Corsi with the plea offer he previously made and Corsi rejected, or possibly a slightly worse version of it, to see if today's indictment and arrest of Stone has changed Corsi's mind at all. Perhaps it will have.
RT @stengel: Conspiring behind the scenes and then boasting about it in public. #rogerstoneindictment https://t.co/NRYjHmDh80
This was my favorite line in the indictment 👇 https://t.co/DyQT9AxkE9
12/ So I suspect we are seeing Corsi and Credico [anonymously] referenced throughout this indictment not so much because they are likely to be indicted at some point, though that is certainly still possible, but because Mueller wants to use these men as cooperators against Stone.
11/ And the reason Mueller cared and cares about Roger Stone infinitely more than Jerome Corsi is quite simple: the former was in regular contact with Donald Trump.
10/ I think it's clear now that Ari Melber was onto something yesterday in detecting that Jerome Corsi had suddenly turned on Roger Stone. This indictment suggests Mueller did indeed, as we always suspected, want Stone much more than Corsi, and wanted to turn Corsi against Stone.
9/ Indeed, it was in anticipation of charges just like these that Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and Roger Stone all tried to convince America that charges of this sort are mere "process crimes" that have no substantive content. Read this indictment—you'll see the lie in that immediately.
8/ Contrary to the false info Trump has fed America for many months now, lying to the feds is only going to be charged if the lie is as to a material fact in a probe. What that means is the *content* of these lies is every bit as important or more important than the fact of them.
RT @justinhendrix: CNN footage of the FBI surrounding Roger Stone's home in Florida as they are about to arrest him in the early hours of t…
7/ So all those who say these charges have nothing to do with Donald Trump, and those who say these are not crimes of collusion, and those who say that these charges represent all that Mueller has or plans to have against Stone or senior Trump campaign officials are *dead wrong*.
6/ And I'll say again what I've said in Proof of Collusion and everywhere else: crimes besides conspiracy can be collusive crimes, including tampering with witnesses, obstructing justice, and telling lies to feds to hide your collusion with a hostile foreign intelligence service.
RT @SethAbramson: Mueller says Roger Stone kept *multiple* "senior Trump campaign officials" apprised of his inside intel about WikiLeaks.…
5/ And one of the people Roger Stone was in contact with the *most* was Donald Trump himself, which underscores that these 7 charges bring the Mueller probe much closer to Donald Trump than many who think this is all just about Stone, Jerome Corsi, and Randy Credico will realize.
4/ We also know that for months Mueller has been intensely intrested in learning how frequently Stone was in touch with the Trump campaign and who precisely he spoke with, which suggests he's trying to gauge how much access Stone had to internal campaign discussions on collusion.
3/ Stone isn't the ideal guy for a cooperation deal because—from a certain standpoint and in a certain light—he's a true believer in his form of "political ratfuckery," but his regular contacts with senior Trump campaign officials suggest he does have a story to tell if he wants.
2/ While by no means would we ever expect someone facing the 50 years in consecutive sentences Stone is theoretically facing to actually get that, Stone is 66, so even the possibility of facing 10 years of actual time creates a risk for him that he'd never again be a free man.
Understand that, given his age, Roger Stone now faces more than enough charges to keep him in prison until he dies. A key purpose of these 7 charges is to find out *what else Stone knows and did and with whom*. Ignore those who say this is all Mueller had.		This is a *beginning*.
Mueller says Roger Stone kept *multiple* "senior Trump campaign officials" apprised of his inside intel about WikiLeaks. Funny how none of those "senior Trump campaign officials" gave any indication they were getting covert collusive assistance from an enemy of the United States.

20/ I've been saying it all week: media is wrong to say there was only the Trump-Rozov tower deal and that the Agalarov deal—in active talks through 2017—can be ignored. Emin's OBSERVER interview and refusal to enter the U.S. is more evidence of this. /end https://t.co/uHVJxRSPRS
19/ So Emin created a cloud of suspicion and mystery in his answers to just *four questions* I provided. Imagine what would happen if he were in a pressure-filled situation being asked *scores* of questions by federal agents who know even more about all this than I do—much more.
18/ And the fact that Emin says he *knows* that "somebody else" at Crocus was handling the Trump transaction means that either Emin can name the person for Mueller and/or Congress *or* he has it within his power to look internally within Crocus to determine the person's identity.
17/ Imagine the "jurisdiction" you'd have to have at the Crocus Group to *know* whether a contract was signed between two multi-billionaires but *not* whether a Letter of Intent was—especially when you previously told Forbes an LOI *was* signed and were *present* for the signing.
16/ That Emin sees the danger in a deal that "never went through" is evidenced by him claiming to THE NEW YORK OBSERVER that he knows for *certain* a contract was never signed between Trump and Crocus—but is bewildered, confused, and unsure about whether a *Letter of Intent* was.
15/ The point is one I made yesterday: the tower deals aren't legally, politically and journalistically significant because they "went through"—in fact that question is only tangentially relevant to whether there's evidence of criminality, political scandal, or news in the deals.
14/ There's an inadvertent message to journalists in Emin's evasions—he says inquiries about the Trump-Agalarov Trump Tower Moscow are "irrelevant," as "the project never went through." Well, the Trump-Rozov tower "never went through" to the *exact same extent*—but we still care.
13/ On the absolutely critical question of whether, when, and why Trump signed a Letter of Intent with Crocus, Emin says, "I'm just not sure whether we signed. I don’t know why." How is someone in his position in the company not able to get—or unwilling to relay—this information?
12/ It's tough to tell if Emin immediately ended his NEW YORK OBSERVER interview when asked about his ex-wife's allegations he's a Russian spy, but it certainly wasn't a good look for Emin either way—given that he'd already been less than candid about both the Kremlin and Crocus.
11/ Any witness in a criminal case who's both cagey about his business and cagey about his connections to government and who—also—shuts down immediately a question on whether his ex-sister-in-law allegedly called him (on his ex-wife's say-so) a "spy" is going to arouse interest.
10/ Moreover, Emin says that he has a particular "jurisdiction" in the company—which I know Congress would love to talk to him about because we know he *directly* engaged in business negotiations with Trump, Trump Jr., Eric, and possibly Ivanka in at *least* 2013, 2014, and 2017.
9/ It's not *just* that Emin used the plural first-person pronoun ("we") in speaking of the Crocus Group—and did so *6 times*, at least—it's *also* that he at one point in his answers refers to "somebody *else* at the company [Crocus Group]." (Emphasis supplied.) That's critical.
8/ For the sake of his musical career, Emin has not only sought to distance himself from the Kremlin (falsely) but also (equally falsely) from the Crocus Group—because it was this business entity that his father Aras used to enter into a Trump Tower Moscow deal with Donald Trump.
7/ I think it's clear that Emin has *no* intention of ever being honest about the relationship his family has with the Kremlin. Which brings me to the second interesting thing Emin said in response to my Twitter questions, on the subject of his relationship with the Crocus Group.
6/ Emin says, "It’s not like I could call President Putin and say, 'Hey, will you meet Mr. Trump?' It doesn’t work like that." And *yet*, Yury Chaika, the Prosecutor General of Russia, *was* able to call the Agalarovs and ask them to pass stolen documents to Trump in Trump Tower.
5/ The fact is, you don't promise a presidential candidate or the president-elect of the United States a meeting with Putin unless you can deliver—and you don't risk angering Putin by promising he'll attend *a birthday party* unless you *damn well know it's okay* via the Kremlin.
4/ And yet here was Emin promising a Putin appearance at a birthday party. So Emin saying he had no authority to ever promise Putin, and never sought any authority, *works* for the example he chose—the Miss Universe pageant—but *not* for the interesting event: the birthday party.
3/ Emin extended the invitation to Trump for him to meet Putin at a birthday party through his agent, Rob Goldstone. That invitation underscores what Emin implicitly acknowledges to THE NEW YORK OBSERVER—that it'd be *crazy* to promise Putin at any event but an international one.
2/ The invitation Emin extended to Trump to meet Putin that I wanted to catch Emin in a lie about was a *different* one involving...wait for it...a birthday party. Emin's claim that he only would've thought he could get to Putin because it was the Miss Universe pageant was a lie.
1/ Emin says that he told Trump he could meet Putin during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant not because he'd *ever* spoken to anyone in the Kremlin about the possibility but because it was a natural thing to say regarding such a big event.		Great!—because that was a trick question.
(THREAD) I found myself in a position today to do what Congress and Mueller weren't able to do—ask Emin Agalarov questions. Thanks to THE NEW YORK OBSERVER for agreeing to put to Emin 4 questions I recently tweeted out. Here are my thoughts on his answers. https://t.co/KxYHeSQZdX
This Cohen statement (via Davis) *alone* creates a reasonable suspicion Trump violated 18 U.S.C. § 1512—an impeachable offense.

@RRlas18 I think Ben and Buzzfeed News are doing great work. I *also* think that everyone writing on this topic is so narrowly focused on their own scoop that it's doing incalculable damage to the forest for the sake of the trees. That's not just regrettable but avoidable and urgently so.
@ScottMStedman You've done great work on this topic, Scott. The problem is, if you wrote about Mirax months ago it was vital that you point your readers to that ongoing business relationship during *this* round of reporting, as it's relevant even if it might turn your scoop into something less.
@thomasafine @ScottMStedman Right, but see what you did there? You called Sater a "Trump proxy," when you could just as easily have described him as a "Rozov business partner who'd been doing multimillion-dollar real estate transactions with Rozov for years [which this may be another of]."		See the problem?
@ScottMStedman I think you missed my point. My point was that December 2015 *is* in the midst of the deal, but that is irrelevant because we don't know that that transaction has to do with Trump rather than Mirax and you haven't shown it. If you know Mirax so well, I'm sure you see the problem.
The damage Ben is doing by denying that Trump had *two* Trump Tower Moscow deals rather than one not only negates the value of his team's research on one of those deals but actually makes it a net negative for Americans' understanding of Trump's tower(s)-for-sanctions relief bid. https://t.co/ly1FPejVta

If we were discussing the likelihood of Trump initiating a pretextal war with Iran with anything like the frequency that that possibility really deserves, all of us would be 73% more terrified about the danger Trump poses not just to our national security but global security, too
PS5/ So no, this isn't some esoteric spat among different types of journalists (independent and corporate, reporter and curatorial, younger and older, less established and more established) it is the *central* question of whether we can be—or are—discussing Trump-Russia cogently.
PS4/ There's a reason Emin *just today refused to enter the U.S.* for fear of legal and/or investigative consequences for doing so—whereas Rozov's name is *never* part of the Trump-Russia timeline except as a potential partner for Trump. The Agalarovs are *all over* the timeline.
PS3/ What I'm saying is that *non-lawyers* set the terms for when a Trump Tower Moscow deal "counted" based on—and this is amazing to say—whatever *Trump* considered to matter, not on the basis of a legal comparison of the significance of the Trump-Rozov and Trump-Agalarov deals.
PS2/ Moreover, the Agalarovs *continue offering big value to Trump* throughout the campaign and transition—offering stolen documents, access to Putin, and missives from the Kremlin—whereas Rozov and Trump never (it seems) have any contact. Another sign Trump-Agalarov is critical.
PS/ Given that many charges relevant to Trump-Agalarov and Trump-Rozov *require* Trump to be trying to perform on a tower-for-sanctions deal *post-inauguration*—and Trump-Rozov has *no* sign of extending post-inauguration while Trump-Agalarov does—the latter may be more critical.
@ScottMStedman For instance, if Sater and Rozov had done a deal 9 months earlier, i.e. 5 months before and not "in the MIDST of" the Trump-Rozov negotiations, I could as easily say it was suspicious—"The money convinced Rozov to deal with Trump!"—or that they'd been at Mirax together since '08.
@ScottMStedman This is not necessarily news. As established in Proof of Collusion (below) Sater and Rozov had been in a *real estate* business relationship at Mirax Group for *seven years* by the time of the deal you cite. The two doing a deal together in December 2015 doesn't tell us anything. https://t.co/uZyPLAE62Q
50/ I'm indebted to those—e.g. David Corn—who did good work reporting on the 2013 Trump-Agalarov deal. I was happy—as a curatorial journalist—to matrix overseas (RIA Novosti) and wrongly obscure (Forbes) elements into that narrative. I hope those reporters will speak up now. /end
49/ I urge anyone who sees on social media the false claim that there was only one Trump Tower Moscow deal to correct that claim with this—or any equivalent—thread establishing there were two. And don't forget—Trump has long been quoted saying he *wanted* multiple Moscow towers.
48/ And *that* matters because of all the things Trump was doing from January 1, 2013 through his run announcement—including secretive contact with and surrounding the NRA that just today we learned the Special Counsel is looking at. Why? Because he doesn't set false date ranges.
47/ And that's kind of the point here—those who are discussing "the [sic] Trump Tower Moscow deal" aren't just erasing a second (frankly as or more interesting) course of potentially criminal business negotiations, but are *also* falsely setting the dates we should be looking at.
46/ But don't doubt that Trump was involved in negotiations on *multiple* Trump Tower Moscow deals following the *only* date that matters: the date he knew and could begin representing to others that he had capital to trade in exchange for cash—his future foreign policy as POTUS.
45/ However much I might wish it, Twitter isn't the venue to *fully* explain why it's *so* damaging to Trump-Russia journalism that those who cut their teeth on *one* Trump Tower Moscow deal are now ignoring or misrepresenting the other. Frankly, that's why I had to write a book.
44/ In this thread I haven't gotten into the pictures of Trump looking at plans in Moscow in 2013 (below), or the tweets from his Moscow entourage about how much he was talking policy, or the social media posts from Ivanka in 2014, or the 2014 Alferova tweets about Trump running. https://t.co/FHDvIbEb4o
43/ Keep in mind that this is the *barest dip* into the background of the Trump-Agalarov deal and the proof that it was *active* from mid-June 2013 for *at least* four years—through the pre-campaign (when Trump knew he'd run), the campaign, the transition, and post-inauguration.
42/ Moreover, we know that Trump has broken every single promise he ever made to voters about (a) divesting from the Trump Organization, or (b) keeping the Trump Organization from doing overseas deals. So the ongoing Trump-Agalarov deal *is* a deal with Trump that can enrich him.
41/ Emin was party to the Trump-Agalarov deal from Day 1 (June 2013). He had every ability to say the deal was "dead" if it was dead—as did Jr. (who didn't say it), as did Eric Trump (who didn't say it), as did Aras Agalarov (who didn't say it). Maybe we take "yes" for an answer?
40/ What Emin says *Trump Jr.* said is that the only delay on the Trump-Agalarov deal is Don and Eric figuring out "who is handling what, how and when." *That* statement has *nothing* to do with a Trump-Agalarov deal being inactive or "irrelevant"—it's a logistical question only.
39/ Talking with Don and Eric about whether and how they are able to do deals with the Agalarovs—which Emin makes clear in the interview is what he's discussing with Don/Eric—is of *course* part of a process of negotiation, but it's *Trump Jr.'s* words that are most telling here.
38/ But after he confesses the Trump-Agalarov deal *was* active in our fourth time-period—June 16, 2015 to November 8, 2016—Emin goes *beyond* that to say that he is still "in contact" with Don and Eric about "pick[ing] up those [Trump-Agalarov Trump Tower Moscow] conversations."
37/ But Emin goes further—*acknowledging* that post-election the Agalarovs had "[business] discussions" that were *part of* the Trump-Agalarov deal: specifically, with a Turkish furniture-maker who was supposed to be supplying furniture for the Trump-Agalarov Trump Tower Moscow.
36/ Moreover, Emin *acknowledges* that he talked about the deal with Trump Jr. post-election—meaning, there was *a reason to do so* because the deal was still active and the Agalarovs needed to know if the election had "changed" anything on that front. This is a major confession.
35/ Notice what Emin says here: that right after Election Day, Trump Jr. told him that the Trump-Agalarov deal had to be put on hold *at that point* because "things [were] changing." That *alone* tells us Emin and Don *both* believed the deal was *active* *prior* to Election Day.
34/ Here's another excerpt from that Forbes interview with Emin Agalarov from July 2017. There are a *number* of things I've highlighted here that demand some additional discussion and consideration. First, the excerpt: https://t.co/xtnZAg5QYW
33/ But even if you still had doubt on this, we could go right back to Emin Agalarov's July 2017 Forbes interview to see that in fact Aras *wasn't* calling the Trump-Agalarov deal dead—or, as he said, oddly, "irrelevant"—in February '17. He was just saying *Trump* couldn't do it.
32/ Journalists who just aren't up on the Agalarov deal now ask us to think that a) the Trump-Agalarov deal ended *at the latest* on June 15, 2015, b) Aras waited *20 months* to say so—then inexplicably attributed it to Trump's *election*, not his *decision to run*. That's silly.
31/ (Note: this https://t.co/96BQ0AdAd7 article used to be freely available in full. I find it interesting, as how could any of us not, that it was suddenly put, at least partially, behind a firewall.)
30/ Notice Agalarov's language to RIA Novosti (covered by https://t.co/96BQ0AdAd7) in February 2017: the deal became "irrelevant" (he doesn't even say "inactive") only "after" Trump was elected on November 8, 2016. And it was only post-inauguration he felt he "couldn't do deals."
29/ In fact, *Aras Agalarov himself* told a major Russian website (a Russian real estate watchdog/news site) that his deal with Trump—a Letter of Intent with design plans *and* funding for the project via a Kremlin bank—was *active* through February 2017: https://t.co/j7nYnBZhIl https://t.co/caHp0KKoZt
28/ I'm not saying Don Jr. responding to Aras and Emin's entreaties *within minutes* is the best sign that the Trump-Agalarov deal was *active*, i.e. that the Agalarovs were in no sense "ex-partners" of the Trumps—though of course it *is* a sign. No—we have much better than that.
27/ Aras and Emin Agalarov set up the June 2016 meeting at which multiple Kremlin agents *entered Trump's home* to offer *stolen documents*—an offer every bit as illegal as Don Jr.'s active solicitation/acceptance of it. And the Agalarovs had access to Trump as business partners.
26/ But wait! you say. Are you suggesting there's *no evidence* the deal remained active in our *fourth* time-period of assessment—June 16, 2015 to November 8, 2016 (Election Day)? Not at all. Not least because Aras Agalarov conspired with the Trumps in crimes during that period.
25/ The Trump-Agalarov deal—*far* more documented; *far* more Kremlin-tied; *far* more advanced (as we'll see) in becoming reality than "Trump-Rozov"—was being *actively* negotiated while Trump had policy promises he could make the Kremlin *and* is betrayed by his "no deals" lie.
24/ Rather, the operative question is whether Trump was in a position to *have something to offer* (i.e. policy positions based not in an Oath of Office, American interests, or anything he ever promised on the campaign trail but rather his own enrichment) in exchange for *money*.
23/ The reason journalists don't lay out for you the legal significance of Trump announcing his presidential run is that—well—there isn't any. The Bribery statute doesn't address candidates—one can begin one's criminal course of conduct under the Bribery statute pre-announcement.
22/ Mind you, during this period Trump has *told GOP officials he's running for president* (December '13) and Cohen has *put presidential polls in the field* for Trump. All his advisers agree he was definitely going to run for president during this period when he was negotiating.
21/ So Emin is confirming active discussions on the Trump-Agalarov deal from November 11, 2013 through *at least* June 16, 2015—negotiations that included the completion of the funding piece (mid-November '13) and other business actions of a journalistically cognizable character.
20/ In a July 2017 Forbes interview, Emin Agalarov reveals that Trump *announced his run for president*—this would be June 16, 2015—"during" the ongoing negotiations on the Trump-Agalarov tower, which negotiations included either a Letter of Intent, NDA, or (more probably) both. https://t.co/YFrdvobywK
19/ Donald Trump Jr. acknowledges spending months working on the deal. Ivanka travels to Moscow to look into additional details. Aras and Emin Agalarov are in regular contact with multiple Trumps—Emin in person several times. But there's even more evidence for us to look at here.
18/ So how about the *third* time-period we can break down the Trump-Agalarov deal into: November 11, 2013 (Trump's return from Moscow) to June 16, 2015 (the date of his *official* announcement of a run)? Well, *this* was an active time-period for the Trump-Agalarov deal as well.
17/ With Trump-Agalarov, you have numerous acknowledgments by Trump, Aras Agalarov, Emin Agalarov, Don Jr., Ivanka, Sberbank—who announced funding for the project days after Trump left Moscow in 2013—The Moscow Times, Russian construction websites, *many* eyewitnesses, and more.
16/ Moreover, public acknowledgment of the Trumps' level of involvement in the Trump-Agalarov deal well outstrips the public evidence we have of the Trumps' involvement in the Rozov deal. Right now all the information we have on the latter comes from two sources—Sater and Cohen.
15/ By contrast, the Trump-Agalarov deal was negotiated with a Kremlin banker, Kremlin developer, and Kremlin official—in short, it was a deal *with Kremlin agents* from start to finish. And it had the same features—Letter of Intent, design plans, funding—as the Trump-Rozov deal.
14/ I say the Kremlin's involvement is "iffy" because Cohen spent *ten months* on the 2015 Trump-Rozov deal before he got the Kremlin's attention—and even then, it was just Trump's "Russian rainmaker" Felix Sater telling Cohen that Putin's lieutenant might be willing to meet him.
13/ Let me take a moment here to note how much/little we know about the *other* "Trump Tower Moscow" deal people are hyping. We know the funding for the 2015 "Trump-Rozov" deal, and we know the site—and today we learned about the design plans. The Kremlin's involvement is *iffy*.
12/ In Moscow Trump met with the other PLAYERS in the deal—while later refusing to say who he met with, besides that they were the "top people." Well we now know who they were: Gref, head of a Kremlin bank; Kozhin, the Kremlin's permits man; and Agalarov, the Kremlin's developer.
11/ Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that while Trump was in Moscow stories were being written in Russian media establishing the deal's SITE, DESIGN PLANS, and rough details on FUNDING, and—of course—the PLAYERS. These things had to have been worked on before Trump went to Moscow.
10/ For two high-profile billionaires to announce a *multibillion-dollar, transnational real estate partnership* at an event watched by *tens of millions of people around the world* requires a certain amount of dedicated back-and-forth on the basic contours of such a major deal.
9/ Within *a day* of landing in Moscow, the Trump-Agalarov deal was announced. That tells us when Trump did his negotiating—between June 16, 2013 (when he first met the Agalarovs at the Miss USA pageant) and November 7, 2013, the day before he arrived in Moscow for Miss Universe.
8/ Between January 1, 2013 and November 7, 2013, Trump did *so* much negotiating for a "Trump Tower Moscow" with business partner (and Kremlin agent) Aras Agalarov he was able to show up at the Miss Universe pageant weekend in Moscow in November 2013 with the deal basically done.
7/ I've been generous to Trump and set January 1, 2013 as that date—even though everyone knows Trump had made up his mind *well* before that. But let's begin our analysis on January 1, 2013, as after that point Trump was open for business in terms of bribery or political scandal.
6/ So whether we're doing a legal, political, *or* journalistic analysis, we're going to begin—*must* begin—at the point Trump was even *capable* of forming a criminal mens rea, committing a political "crime," or entering a journalist-cognizable scandal: the day he chose to run.
5/ Trump lawyer Michael Cohen began preparing for an eventual Trump POTUS run in 2008; Trump adviser Sam Nunberg says Trump decided to run in 2016 in November of 2012; Trump pal/adviser Roger Stone says Trump made an irrevocable decision to run on January 1, 2013 *at the latest*.
4/ So as an *initial* matter, *any* journalist who focuses your attention on (or restricts facts' "relevance" to) a specific date range (usually, but not always, June 16, 2015 to November 8, 2016) has absolutely *no* legal or political (let alone journalistic) basis for doing so.
3/ *Politically*, Trump's tweets denying ties to Russia—a political malfeasance that could contribute in small part to Conspiracy to Defraud the U.S. charges—purposefully didn't specify dates. Trump was just telling us his foreign policy was unaffected by business considerations.
2/ *Legally*, as a matter of Bribery—a discrete federal crime designated as an impeachable offense in the Constitution—the question is whether Trump participated in a course of conduct that began *anytime* pre-election and had him promising specific policy as POTUS for *payment*.
1/ First, understand that as both a legal matter *and* a political matter the importance—indeed necessity—of correctly discussing *two* Trump Tower Moscow deals rather than one has nothing to do with the date range some who know better focus on: June 16, 2015 to November 8, 2016.
(THREAD) Some smart folks in independent and corporate media are being obtuse about whether Trump was in negotiations for *1 Moscow tower or 2* during the period of time such negotiations would be relevant to Mueller's probe.

4/ I like @BuzzFeedNews. I'm glad they have a scoop about *one* of the *two* Trump Tower Moscow deals Trump was working on during the 2016 campaign.		But you don't—not even for the sake of stoking excitement about your scoop—falsely state there was one deal when there were *two*.
3/ The two building sites—🅰️ and 🅱️—are *18 kilometers* from one another, so they're *not* the same project, same site, same architectural plans, same letter of intent, same business partners, same funding... yet media ignores one and tells us the other *is* "Trump Tower Moscow.* https://t.co/fmdA2ISh2m
2/ PROOF OF COLLUSION establishes via major media reporting that Trump has wanted *multiple* towers in Moscow since the late 80s. The media's insistence on discussing only *one* tower isn't based in reported fact, merely in a sense America can't concentrate on two towers at once.

CONCLUSION: As you can see from these questions, while Agalarov and his attorney may have wanted to give the impression that they tried their best to work with Mueller and Congress to make Emin available for questioning under oath, the chances Emin wanted that are virtually zero.
BONUS QUESTION: Your ex-wife's sister has told media your ex-wife broke up with you because you're a "Russian spy." Is this true—are you a Kremlin agent in a constant and studied (rather than merely, as we already know, intermittent) way? And if not, why would she lie about that?
BONUS QUESTION: Your father has stated that he does the Kremlin's bidding when asked—whether it involves building a structure or anything else. To your knowledge, what are all the tasks (*Trump-related or not*) the Kremlin has directly asked of your dad, a Trump business partner?
BONUS QUESTION: Has any person you knew at the time (or subsequently learned) was a Kremlin agent *ever* promised to you *any* benefit—including, but not limited to, money, access to media, or various forms of assistance to your musical career—in exchange for aiding the Kremlin?
BONUS QUESTION: According to the Forbes interview you gave in mid-2017, you, Don, and Eric continued discussing the Trump-Agalarov tower after Trump's inauguration—and have kept the deal entirely open and active. (Please pay some damn attention to this fact, U.S. media!) Explain.
BONUS QUESTION: Your friends Artem Klyushin and Konstantin Rykov have both either stated or intimated on social media that—beginning years before the 2016 election—they were working behind the scenes to get Trump elected. What do you know of their plans and online "confessions"?
QUESTION 10: At various points before and after Trump announced his run you represented to the Trumps you could arrange a personal meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin—and were interested in doing so. Who gave you that authority? When? Why? Who did you discuss this idea with?
QUESTION 9: You had calls with *Trump Sr.* during his presidential run, as well as appearing at his properties (sometimes with him) after he had made the decision to run. What statements did he make to you about any of: sanctions; his Moscow tower; Vladimir Putin; foreign policy?
QUESTION 8: You had emails and calls with Don (Donald Trump Jr.) in early June 2016 as you—legally speaking, a Kremlin agent (while *also* being a Trump business partner)—were setting up a meeting for the Kremlin. Who did Don say he'd told about this meeting? Did he tell his dad?
QUESTION 7: In 2016, the Kremlin asked you/your dad to set a meeting at Trump Tower with Trump or Don at which Kremlin agents would secretly—and illegally—get stolen docs to Trump to help him win as part of the "Kremlin's support for Trump." How much did you know about this plot?
QUESTION 6: Just as Trump put Don and Ivanka in charge of the (2015) "Trump-Rozov" tower deal post-Letter of Intent, after Trump signed an LOI with your dad in 2013 you spent lots of time with him, Don, and Ivanka in 2014 and 2015. What conversations did you have about the tower?
QUESTION 5: Your dad very clearly told Russian media his Letter of Intent for a multibillion-dollar Moscow tower with Trump (with financing, a site, architectural plans, and more) was active through—for Christ's sake, pay attention, U.S. media!—February 2017. Was your dad lying?
QUESTION 4: While in Russia, Trump signed a Letter of Intent to build a multibillion-tower Moscow tower with your dad. He and your dad had financing, a site, architectural plans, and more. You told Forbes about it in 2017—then called them back to retract. Who told you to do that?
QUESTION 3: Trump spent his time in Moscow talking politics; after he left, those he was with seemed to know for certain he was running for POTUS. To what extent did he entangle conversation about the White House with discussion of his business interests while in Moscow in 2013?
QUESTION 2: You are now suspected of being—or of being an associate of—the person who offered, in 2013, to have prostitutes go up to Trump's room at the Ritz Moscow with the intention of having whatever they did in his room be taped. Was it you? If not, what do you know about it?
QUESTION 1: When you came to America in mid-2013 to woo Trump and the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow, you were accompanied by persons connected to the Kremlin. What conversations did you (or anyone on the trip, to your knowledge) have with Kremlin agents about Trump pre-trip?

3/ Too often, questions are being asked in media for which valuable research has already been done--we just don't like that the research wasn't done by major media. But is that dilettantish approach to information any way to act/think about info, in the face of a national crisis?
2/ And we already know from my research of a *year* ago that the Trump-Agalarov deal *didn't* end in February '17, but was handed off by Trump to his sons and extended through at least July '17. Why would the Trump-Rozov deal be *any* different? Can anyone in media tell me that?
18 months ago I established conclusively, by reviewing Russian media, that Trump's Letter of Intent with the Agalarovs extended into February '17. Now people are publicly wondering if the Trump-Rozov talks extended past November '16, as though these prior analyses never happened.

5/ So I think it's incumbent on us to say that Rudy *may* be breaching confidentiality *or* waiving the attorney-client privilege on behalf of his client *but we don't know which*. Therefore, the *legal status* of the words Rudy says (*including* for future trial use) is unclear.
4/ This takes me back to an earlier point: the media is co-authoring Trump's defense by *never* forcing Rudy to say if he's speaking for/waiving privilege on behalf of his client. So Rudy gets to say what he likes and he/Trump can later say none of it was representation of Trump.
3/ Here's why that matters: I think it's possible that a time is coming when Trump *fires* Giuliani so that he can save himself by claiming that much of what Rudy said to the media was said without Trump's consent (i.e., was an improper breach of attorney-client confidentiality).
2/ I think Renato is assuming, not unreasonably, that Rudy was speaking with his client's consent, i.e. Trump had previously, in speaking with Rudy, waived privilege as to that particular attorney-client communication. But my assumption is the *opposite*: I think Rudy went rogue.
One clarification I'd make here is that Giuliani can't waive privilege without Trump's consent. So either Trump waived privilege here, and that's why Rudy said what he did, or Trump did not waive privilege as to that conversation and Rudy is immediately subject to bar discipline. https://t.co/V4kyyDoIGY

2/ That *doesn't* mean there shouldn't be a vigorous Congressional investigation alongside and—as necessary—in cooperation with Mueller. But to say "we can't Mueller our way out of this" is to say that US rule of law can't effectively contest a career criminal in the White House.
I respect this view, but I have a different one: America's rule of law *must* be vindicated by (a) any/all non-Trump indictments that can be brought (Mueller, SDNY, EDVA, DC) and (b) the constitutional process of impeachment. Anything less and we admit the rule of law has failed. https://t.co/UJ8KVgx6uG

Chris, you know I love your shows. But your focus on deceit over illegality, while well-intended, doesn't track with the facts we have.

@england_michael No, it doesn't, and no, it isn't, and you need to read the whole thread and stop this offensive foolishness immediately.
7/ If you're wondering why I'd bother to do a thread on this uncomfortable subject: America is going to have to learn *very soon* how to have a conversation about collusive crimes committed by government-linked Israelis that do not involve immediate accusations of anti-Semitism.
6/ Saying there was an Israeli and non-Israeli pre-election collusion criminal conspiracy involving a small and discrete number of Israeli and non-Israeli Jews who were motivated by their twisted sense of themselves as Jews is a sad (legal) fact having nothing to do with Judaism.
5/ And as Buzzfeed News *correctly* notes, Birnbaum and Finkelstein's religious background is *relevant* to their mens rea because they explicitly weighed being anti-Semitic themselves (re: Soros) against Trump's purported long-term value to their narrow understanding of Judaism.
4/ Upshot: be careful about accusing me of speaking incautiously about Israel or Jews, not primarily because I am also a Jew but because I have done enough research to know the *very* small, discrete number of Israelis and non-Israeli Jews who are villains in the collusion story.
3/ Anyone doing a deep dive on the Trump-Israeli connection will shortly come across a small cadre of Jews so committed to Trump being president that they were willing to create a danger of assassination for a Holocaust survivor. Birnbaum/Finkelstein are in that very small group.
2/ I know I don't have to tell 99% of you this, but for the other 1% I'll tell you, as a Jew, that not only is the word "Jew" not offensive, but it's a relevant noun here because there are very few Jews who'd make it their life's work to destroy the life of a Holocaust survivor.
When I started reading this and saw that two Jews were behind this, based on my research for PROOF OF CONSPIRACY I immediately thought to myself, "It'll be Birnbaum and Finkelstein."		And it was.		I'll tell you now that these two guys were part of pre-election collusion. Bigtime. https://t.co/GR9M6d4Dqi
Rudy's claim that Trump, if he spoke to Cohen, spoke only about Cohen's impending testimony—which *Trump had no reason to disbelieve*—is a *nonsense*. Cohen spoke to Trump *ten times* about the Trump-Rozov deal. Trump *knew* whether Cohen's planned testimony was going to be true.

4/ That's why I have Making False Statements on the list of "collusive crimes" (in this particular fact-pattern, i.e. the Trump-Russia investigation). Because that's almost certainly what Trump did on August 17, 2016 and Mueller would have multiple witnesses to confirm it by now.
3/ Beyond having spoken to the briefers, Mueller would know from Flynn exactly what Trump said during that meeting, in other words how many lies he told to law enforcement bout his contacts with the Kremlin. And those lies, told during a criminal investigation, would be *crimes*.
2/ In that briefing, U.S. intel was *also* informing Trump that the Russians were going to try to infiltrate his campaign to influence him. It's evident that those statements (plus questions) were intended to provoke disclosures from Trump about whether any such effort had begun.
THIS. 		THIS is a key point not enough people have been making. 		Under questioning Trump *actively hid from U.S. intelligence what he'd been doing*. And if Flynn knew any of what Trump was doing, so did he, as he was in the classified briefing with Trump on August 17, 2016.		👇 https://t.co/AYpHPNZIDi

@AtelierEnglish It is *also* those things. Both Bribery and Conspiracy to Defraud the United States are on the list of charges I have designated as being under the umbrella of collusion. It's not an either/or situation but a situation in which the list of relevant charges is actually quite long.
9/ Incidentally, I think readers of this feed understand that when I say "today we learned" I don't actually mean "today we learned." Readers of this feed and readers of Proof of Collusion already knew about Trump's aiding and abetting. What I mean is "today all America learned."
This is what I meant about detractors of the Buzzfeed News story "overplaying their hand." There's no question that *some* version of that story is true, and the several minutes of jubilant self-righteousness Buzzfeed News' detractors felt is going to deflate pretty damn quickly. https://t.co/W2QIIeUKgK
8/ The important thing is this: if Giuliani is willing to say this publicly, it means he's either certain Mueller already has this information from another source, or sure that information at *least* this bad about the Trump-Kremlin negotiations is certain to come out eventually.
7/ I think the problem that we're going to have now is that media is so invested in this grave misconception of how to use the term "collusion" in discussing Mueller's work that there's a chance the full import of what Rudy confessed to today will be missed and not reported upon.
6/ The only reason Giuliani was willing to admit today that Trump was negotiating with the Kremlin up until Election Day is that media has so doggedly (but wrongly) said that conspiracy is the only collusion charge relevant to Mueller's probe that Trump's team came to believe it.
5/ Remember that, as of August 17, 2016, Donald Trump was one of the few civilians in the *world* with a legally cognizable level of certainty that the Kremlin was engaged in a hot cyberwar against America. His obligations from then on were therefore *special* and *justiciable*.
4/ Remember that what we call the Trump-Rozov deal (the 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal, as opposed to the 2013 Trump-Agalarov deal) was being negotiated *with the Kremlin*. You *cannot* learn that Putin is in a hot cyberwar with America and keep negotiating a deal with the Kremlin.
3/ The focus of the collusion conversation has always been exclusively conspiracy. In Proof of Collusion I argued that two dozen crimes could be collusive; then, once Ben Wittes said obstruction could be collusion, everyone took note. Well aiding and abetting is *also* collusion.
2/ Today we learned that Trump was discussing unilateral sanctions relief with the Kremlin (via Sessions) *and* floating the idea of a gifted $50 million penthouse in Moscow for Putin (via Cohen and Sater) *and* negotiating a massive Trump Tower Moscow deal post-August 17, 2016.
One of the central theses of this feed has been that Trump had a legal obligation to do nothing to aid/abet Russian cybercrimes after August 17, 2016, when he received his first classified briefing as a candidate and learned of Putin's cyberwar. Today we learned he did just that.

@EdGreenberger @ShanaLin4 It would be a crime if he was designating someone as a legal agent to send a messge to Cohen by discussing his testimony, and not a crime if he was simply ruminating publicly about Cohen's testimony and someone who heard him decided to "help him out" by committing a crime for him
5/ What I'll say as a lawyer is that if I'd been writing that Cohen filing, I'd say "as per" or "pursuant to" if Trump has issued the directive directly, and "in accordance with" if the directive was issued *indirectly*. So I think what Ed quoted is a valuable piece of evidence.
@EdGreenberger @ShanaLin4 What I'll say as a lawyer is that if I'd been writing that Cohen filing, I'd say "as per" or "pursuant to" if Trump has issued the directive directly, and "in accordance with" if the directive was issued *indirectly*. So I do think what Ed quoted is a valuable piece of evidence.
I think the pushback on Buzzfeed News is *way* overplaying its hand—and is going to seem *very* foolish *very* soon. Trump has committed obstruction *repeatedly* over the last two years. If you now think it'll come out he *never* did any such thing, feel free to die on that hill.
@RWhisk1 Right, so what you did was take a tweet that very, very clearly was just theorizing, and you pretended it was offering "verified" facts so you could discredit it. What you're doing is spreading disinformation about what I said, while decrying disinformation. What a beautiful con.
@MilesHilarius This is another reason I see some value in this particular theory (which is *only* a theory). Mueller seems to be saying that the particular *type* of evidence the Buzzfeed News story would have us looking for does not exist, which would be the case if Trump used an intermediary.
@Sweetling I was very, very, *very* clear that this is not "news." Fox News, Trump, and his ilk use the phrase to spread what they pretend is "news." What I'm putting out there is a mere theory that acknowledges itself as speculation. But it is consistent with the facts and people involved.
4/ This reading would also be consistent with Michael Cohen's prior court filings; with an M.O. Trump has repeatedly used before (using cutouts for crimes); with Mueller needing to correct an inaccurate story; and with Trump still being *every bit* the criminal we know him to be.
3/ Under *this* reading, Mueller had to limit damage to his witness (Cohen); to his agents (who Buzzfeed News implied were leaking, and if the story is inaccurate, it'd wrongly suggest they were leaking inaccurate news); and to Congress, which might initiate a probe on bad facts.
2/ What this possibility does, at a minimum, is remind us that it's possible for the Buzzfeed News story to have inaccuracies within it yet still rightly report that Trump was part of a conspiracy to suborn perjury. It could simply be that the means used were not those described.
I don't offer this as news, but a hopefully valuable rumination: I hear many saying, including some with access to smart people, that Mueller's objection to the Buzzfeed News story may've been based in part on Trump issuing a directive to Cohen *via intermediary*.		Still a crime. https://t.co/udtZQzWjuI
2/ What I mean is, some of what Mueller deemed inaccurate may be the idea that Buzzfeed News had access to Mueller's team. I do think it's more than that, but I'm not at all convinced that Mueller was trying to deep-six the *entire* Buzzfeed News report. But many will say he did.
It could easily be the case that Mueller's big concern tonight was ensuring people don't think his team is leaking, as Buzzfeed came close to indicating it was. Its story could still be partly inaccurate, but Mueller's reason for speaking out is more likely to be self-protective.

The funny thing about the foam bricks Trump is now sending to the Capitol by the truckload is that they'd be just as effective at actually securing the border as the barrier Trump is demanding
7/ Note even Parscale's language is fraudulent—perhaps criminally so—by saying "we’ll send the wall to them, brick by brick," a clear allusion to the idea that (as the picture also suggests) these are real bricks that are heavy and a nuisance to Chuck/Nancy and expensive to ship.
6/ Lest you doubt this is fraud, note that the picture provided to donors is of a real brick (intended to make you think a real brick will be sent, and that $20/brick is needed for postage) then the small print says a) none of the money is going to that and b) they're faux bricks
@dyqik I would have thought that was fraud but I'm just a lawyer
@lalahhathaway That too

4/ By the way, "I did this [mailed them 100,000 bricks]...to make sure...they had no choice [but to agree with me]" sounds SO MUCH LIKE a criminal mens rea it's almost like it totally, 100% is
3/ Imagine if, tomorrow, you get into a dispute with your neighbor over the boundary-line between your properties, and then, tomorrow night, you decide to mail 100,000 BRICKS to your neighbor (*100,000*).		How *quickly* do you think you'll experience contact with local police?

7/ But from a *journalistic* standpoint (not a defense-strategy standpoint), what's vital here is to make decisions as a journalist that *force* Trump to issue a statement and thereby give readers some actual news content they can later use to adjudicate Trump's *political* fate.
6/ There's actually no reason for Trump not to issue his own (dishonest) statement on Twitter: a) impeachment is wholly political anyway, so he can "play politics" with his legal liability (for now), and b) if he goes down for what he did, any such statement won't matter anyway.
I see eye to eye with Renato on this 👇 https://t.co/SvP2b50WYA
@RatsebeLekoatsa No, I've *never* said Ken lies; I questioned the quality of his sources on one story, and criticized him for re-reporting a story (in effect) that had been falsely reported on seven prior occasions (that Mueller was almost done with his work *per* a certain class of *bad* source)
5/ And as a shrewd reader points out, when Sarah H. Sanders later says, "I'd refer you to the president's counsel" when asked about this, she's getting media to *re-report* what was *never a denial in the first place* by Trump. The result is Trump *never* has to actually respond.
4/ Rudy, like any defense lawyer, has learned when the journalists covering him, like Ken, are not going to force him to say that he is making a representation on Trump's behalf (that is, upon consultation with his client). This has freed Rudy to say whatever the *hell* he wants.
3/ When journalists give the impression they're counting the minutes until Rudy denies a piece of breaking news is accurate, it gives readers the false impression that a denial from Rudy has any news value whatsoever. It does not. Only a denial from Trump would matter or be news.
2/ People forget, probably because Rudy is himself famous, that Rudy literally matters not at all in this equation and is supposed to be merely a mouthpiece for representations his client wishes to make to the public if any. And what Rudy said was NOT a representation from Trump.
Not a denial, actually, from the standpoint of a defense lawyer. If Ken's quote is accurate this is *not* the same as saying "we categorically deny" or "Mr. Trump categorically denies," this is Rudy speaking for Rudy and Trump later can say he had nothing to do with Rudy's words. https://t.co/T4Dy93QgEB

4/ Trump has **very** clear patterns of criminality recognizable to anyone who's worked in that milieu and many who haven't. There is no such thing as a "one-off" in such circumstances. Anything Trump did once (suborning perjury, witness tampering, obstruction) he did habitually.
3/ And note that Trump *also* issued orders to both Steve Bannon and Corey Lewandowski about how they should avoid Congressional questioning that in *each* case required the man to make false claims of "privilege" that would have led to Contempt findings with a Democratic House.
2/ Trump Jr.'s lies to Congress were... *extraordinary*... in their depth and scope. The idea he'd walk into Congressional testimony planning to lie to Congress (a federal crime) and never run it past his father first to make sure that's what Trump wanted him to do... no—he did.
Everyone realizes Trump *also* told his *son* to lie to Congress, right? I mean, nobody is doubting that, based on the evidence we have, right?
2/ As someone who negotiated for a living for years, I'll say that if *this* (what Trump is doing) is how you "negotiate" you are a joke as a dealmaker and always will be
This shutdown makes (and will continue to make) Trump look *weak* because he said daily for two years he was a "dealmaker," please don't forget that

@JohnT15 "Center-right" doesn't come from me. I've never read the Epoch Times. I'm relaying what is said about it by other media outlets.
9/ So *if*—e.g.—we find he told Congress he was asked to wear a wire, chances are he *was*. But his description of the event will *exaggerate* everyone's words and actions, he'll bend the truth as to his *own* words/actions, and his theorizing on the event will be pure nonsense.
8/ What I mean: if Papadopoulos says he met with a person, or got an email, at a given time/place, the *majority* of the time (but not all the time) he will be telling the truth as he understands it. But everything he says will include exaggeration, minimizing, and BS theorizing.
7/ My position on Papadopoulos has remained firm, based on years of defendant and witness interviews:		1. The majority of the *facts* he offers are *broadly* true.	2. He's a serial exaggerator.	3. He's a serial minimizer of his own wrongdoing.	4. His theorizing/speculation is BS.
6/ If in fact TET does have Papadopoulos' leaked Congressional testimony—and if Papadopoulos was telling the truth when he said the FBI asked him to wear a wire—I admit I'd feel vindicated as a legal professional and former investigator for having rightly noted the *possibility*.
5/ For the record—and as the BBC (below) has noted regarding my writing on this—I told the BBC that Papadopoulos "may" have worn a wire (*may*) based on the language of court filings in his case. Certain folks skewered me for even noting the *possibility*. https://t.co/lf9vG4Jcxe
4/ Anyway, we don't know who leaked the testimony, and we certainly don't know how much of what Papadopoulos has said is true, so I'm not doing a longer, substantive thread at this point. But I've marked this story (in my head) in the event it breaks soon in other media outlets.
3/ The other concern with the Epoch Times story—and the outlet is, to be clear, rated as a "center-right" media outlet, not a progressive news outlet—is that it is entirely based on Papadopoulos' in-some-cases-wild claims, though we should note that Papadopoulos *was* under oath.
2/ I've not yet linked to the Epoch Times story, not because the outlet fails bias/accuracy checks from watchdogs (it doesn't) but because it's odd they'd be the only outlet with Papadopoulos' Congressional testimony.		But now Papadopoulos himself admits his testimony has leaked.
BREAKING: Papadopoulos says his congressional testimony has leaked, which means whether or not the recent Epoch Times story is true—it quotes Papadopoulos as saying he was asked to wear a wire—at a minimum The Epoch Times is correct in claiming Papadopoulos' testimony has leaked. https://t.co/eu61FtsHTL

PS/ What makes the NBC report, which has *never been refuted*, more stunning is Trump doesn't *just* say "flip"—which in theory he could play off as a fear Manafort would lie about him—he also says "sell him out," which *acknowledges* that Manafort has incriminating info to sell.

2/ To be clear, my *preference* would have been to follow norms in an emergency, but we already decided not to do that (with Rosenstein, and in so many other cases), so the bridge between principle and pragmatism has already been crossed and we should acknowledge that eventually.
I agree with Walt but this is similar, to me, to the Rosenstein situation. In a non-emergency Rosenstein would have and should recused himself, as he's a Mueller witness. Just so, Barr should recuse, but in an emergency I will take a Mueller friend over 6 months more of Whitaker. https://t.co/p346YhK62Y

5/ I realize it's convenient for me to be working on a sequel to Proof of Collusion and saying "guys this is huge"—so by all means feel free to disbelieve what I'm saying, as soon enough we'll *all* see and publicly how small a part of the whole narrative the current narrative is
4/ John Hannah and Mohammed Dahlan are two of the *most* important names in the whole Trump-Russia/Trump-Saudi/Trump-Emirati/Trump-Israeli narrative—and ask yourself, how often have you heard those names on TV? Even Nader (a *star* witness) almost never has his name uttered on TV
3/ Listen, only 20% of the story of what Trump did during the election is on TV thus far; in working on Proof of Conspiracy and relying *only* on major news sources around the world, I'm finding dozens of narratives that are harrowing and criminal and not on any TV channel at all
2/ This despite Mueller now focusing on lines of inquiry involving Nader, Prince, Hannah, MBS, MBZ, Bannon, Dahlan, and so on, i.e., that should be telling any analyst on TV that Gates is still needed at least in *part* because of Trump-Saudi/Trump-Emirati/Trump-Israeli collusion
One way I know no one on TV knows anything about the "grand bargain" is that no one's noting—as to the extension of Gates' case—that Gates met with Saudi/Emirati emissary Nader *before* Nader was invited to Trump Tower with Zamel and Prince to offer illegal preelection assistance

@KamjoleJonathan It would be *more* shrewd to note that Pompeo went to Qatar.		But we have a base there, *and* Qatar got back into Trump's good graces once they loaned his son-in-law money. But the other 50+ Muslim nations are clearly not relevant to the "grand bargain" to remake the Middle East.

3/ BTW, when I state a fact about recusal ethics that contradicts the outcome non-lawyers would like to see, I expect to be disagreed with and that's OK. But as a lawyer I'm obligated, as are all lawyers, to note that in any normal situation Rosenstein would have recused himself.
@downeyballs Look, I'm ultimately glad he didn't recuse. But you are wrong on the facts. Rosenstein had a conversation with Trump about whether Russia would or should be referenced in the Comey firing letter or not and that makes him a significant and material witness on the obstruction case.
RT @SethAbramson: Oh god, the president is being mocked by... Burger King https://t.co/7XALjpOIdQ
2/ Barr said that Rod Rosenstein told him he *wanted* to leave DOJ because he'd only ever intended on being in the job for two years, and that a new AG coming in (and seeking to have a deputy of his choice) was an excellent occasion for him to make good on his longstanding plans.
If the answer Barr just gave under oath was honest, I was correct that Rosenstein leaving had *nothing* to do with the false claim that Mueller is almost done with his work. That story never made *any* sense to me—and Barr is effectively denying it under oath before Congress now.
Oh god, the president is being mocked by... Burger King https://t.co/7XALjpOIdQ
2/ (Mind you, I have *always* favored an aggressive recusal policy, so to me, all things being equal, Sessions, Rosenstein, and Barr should *all* have recused. And I expect that Brand resigned her #3 spot at DOJ because *she* thought Rosenstein would have to recuse himself, too.)
Significant, yes, but if Rosenstein didn't have to recuse... as a *witness in the case he's overseeing*... should we expect Barr would've been told to recuse, or that we should've had a reasonable expectation he would? The recusal case for Sessions and Rosenstein was/is stronger. https://t.co/vZl2imHFzP

10/ If confirmed, Barr will be fighting off Trump daily. He'll face pressure from Trump aides, allies and associates to violate his oath. He'll be enticed to bend to Trump's will. But that was always going to be so. Barr might be better able to withstand pressure than most. /end
9/ Upshot: the Democrats *aren't* super upset about this nomination. Media and certain folks online got us amped up over it because they wanted a day of drama. What I've always tried to be is a straight shooter—even when/as I know readers might want to hear something different.
8/ Whoever Trump nominated, he was going to try to tamper with—try to obstruct or intimidate. So I would rather have an old dude like Barr who's been at DOJ and is at the end of his career—giving him the freedom to act independently—than a young buck who's trying to please POTUS.
7/ Never assess a nomination like this against the AG you wanted—assess a nomination like this in the context of the GOP having 53 Senate votes and Trump therefore being able to nominate nearly anyone he wants. In that context, uh, yeah, I'll take a family friend of the Muellers.
6/ Did Trump hire Barr hoping he'd obstruct Mueller's work? Of course. Do we have evidence Barr made that commitment, either from his answers or other info? No. We have evidence he's a Republican I wouldn't have picked, who nevertheless doesn't aim to impede (his friend) Mueller.
5/ Of course Barr could be lying—under oath—in his answers. But if you think an AG candidate can't or shouldn't be confirmed because (without evidence) you think he's lying under oath, what candidate *would* be acceptable? We can always claim that a job candidate might be lying.
4/ I see folks online who want this hearing to be an outrage—wall-to-wall evidence Barr is going to shut down Mueller's probe. Candidly, I don't think we have that—I think we have evidence the Barrs and the Muellers are friends and Barr is a better pick than certain alternatives.
3/ I'm not saying Barr is who I would've picked. I'm not saying I *don't* think he should recuse himself. But the case for his recusal is weaker than it was for Sessions—and by far—and we have to acknowledge that. Barr acknowledging his memo was rank speculation helps him a lot.
2/ I'll say—perhaps contrary to expectation—that I think media hyped this hearing overmuch. CNN suggested pre-hearing that Barr could be a major threat to Mueller's probe, and I'm not sure we had any evidence of that. By and large his answers have been... in the acceptable range.
Barr just confirmed that the presidential pardon power is not absolute, and that it is possible for a pardon to be a criminal act (e.g. obstruction) and that (if so) that pardon cannot legally be issued. That was my understanding of his answer, at least, and it seemed a good one.

@mmrsofagayshai I do
🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/mIjiwHb5BJ
@Laura_E_Adkins My understanding is that in trade publishing the author really has to decide how much they're going to invest in fact-checking and how. If or when authors don't invest... well, we're seeing the results now, maybe. (That's a presumption, though; I really don't know what happened.)
This book—PROOF OF CONSPIRACY—will make people unbelievably angry. And rightfully so. The President of the United States sold America's foreign policy to a cabal of nations with whom he colluded before and after the 2016 election, and thousands of innocents have died as a result.
@Paulallenk I know, right? But a surprising number of people were writing me or writing online expressing confusion about whether I'm the "Abramson" who has a major fact-checking issue with his book. Again: I am not.		I am, as you say, not a Jill.
FYI: I'm *not* the Abramson (nor related to the Abramson) everyone is writing about today. That's *Jill* Abramson.		Also: pre-pub I hired a team of 3 top fact-checkers to scour Proof of Collusion for any errors. I can't speak to Jill's book because I don't know anything about it.
@TheBromm @cindila2009 See the full thread, Sean. I noted I was making a broader point: that we already know the denial he was ostensibly making is false, which is why him answering the question so torturously *matters*. Had he used proper grammar, the fact that he's *lying* would've been self-evident.
RT @SethAbramson: Amazing that he couldn't even use proper grammar in answering the most important question of his life.		❎ "I never worked…
PS2/ Instead we got:		❎ "I never worked for Russia."		From a man who says he has the "best words."		A man who then went on to angrily admonish the national media for asking him this incredibly obvious question in the first place.		Which question he answered like a second grader.
PS/ Shrewd readers will note how obvious it should've been to Trump that the *full* sentence he needs to utter to America right now, not that it would be the truth if he said it, is this:		🆗️ "I am not now coordinating—and have never coordinated—with agents of Putin's Kremlin."
5/ So if you've been following this thread, you'll see that I wasn't making a joke about grammar—I was proving how important grammar is to proper journalism. Trump's poor grammar hides the fact that he can't honestly utter the grammatically correct sentence America needs to hear.
4/ Except Trump *can't* say "I've never coordinated with agents of Putin's Kremlin," as when Papadopoulos looked him in the eye on March 31, 2016 and told him he was acting as a Kremlin intermediary to set up a secret summit with Putin, Trump *encouraged* and then *promoted* him.
3/ And of course the use of the word "Russia" here is inaccurate, as what we're speaking of is Putin's Kremlin, and more specifically than even that, *agents* of Putin's Kremlin. So what he *really* should've said is:		🆗️ "I've never coordinated with agents of Putin's Kremlin."
2/ And his big denial doesn't even cover what he's *really* accused of—as what's at issue here is whether he's worked "with" Russia rather than "for" Russia. Not that anyone should believe him anyway, but this is what he should've said:		🆗️ "I've never coordinated with Russia."
Amazing that he couldn't even use proper grammar in answering the most important question of his life.		❎ "I never worked for Russia."	🆗️ "I've never worked for Russia."

2/ I've said before and will say again that FBI employees whose errors at the FBI were a) minor, and b) not malicious got fired by Trump or his people *precisely* so that Trump could use this information down the line to smear lifelong public servants. Media is letting him do it.
Trump fired Comey. Trump's campaign NatSec chief, Sessions, fired McCabe. Baker and Page *chose* to leave the FBI. Strzok was fired *despite* recommendations he get a small suspension. *Any* media reference to how these folks left the FBI without these facts is pro-Trump disinfo.

@jonkarl SOURCE/ The VANITY FAIR story is from 5 days ago; it'd make sense for the White House to use reporters to get a counternarrative out now. To Jon's credit, he acknowledges the "anticlimactic" line was what he'd been "led to believe" by White House sources. https://t.co/qVD5YPwzgc

Dartmouth (@DartmouthMBK) is leading Harvard by 15 at halftime		All who follow Ivy League hoops know how delightfully surprising this is		@IvyHoopsOnline https://t.co/Cscg3HQOwE
6/ Anyway, Trump's Middle Eastern allies had several reasons to want Tillerson gone—don't get me wrong—but I just find the time overlap interesting, i.e. Tillerson had special access to a Trump-Putin summit and almost immediately Trump's Middle East allies want Tillerson *gone*.
5/ Trump handled Helsinki differently from Hamburg. Why?		"It's not clear if Trump has taken notes from interpreters on other occasions, but officials say they never got a reliable readout of Trump's Helsinki meeting. Unlike Hamburg, he allowed no officials or aides in the room."
4/ When a White House spokesman asserts that Tillerson "gave a fulsome readout of the [Trump-Putin Hamburg] meeting immediately afterward to other U.S. officials in a private setting, as well as a readout to the press," you have to at least *wonder*, was Trump *happy* about that?
3/ Trump met privately with Putin and Tillerson in Hamburg in July '17. Then the press started prying into what was said. Then Trump's Middle Eastern allies began using proxies—e.g. Broidy—to get Trump to fire Tillerson. Did they decide Tillerson wasn't loyal enough post-Hamburg?
6 months ago I asked Congress to subpoena Trump's Helsinki interpreter. 14,000+ people retweeted that call. Today's it's sounding like *exactly* what Congress should be moving to do given the breaking news from The Washington Post. Trump's straight up acting like a Kremlin asset. https://t.co/2elrS6RSoZ
2/ Not even spies do this—this is dumb, evil collusion.		"Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Putin, including taking his interpreter's notes and instructing a linguist not to discuss what transpired with administration officials."
Jesus https://t.co/qebfHCKT3I
KEY CLARIFICATION #14: In the 2016 election, Russia was in a discrete, unilaterally aggressive "hot" cyberwar with America that some GOP pols—e.g. Trump—knew of long before some of their actions giving aid/comfort to the Kremlin. But the Treason statute requires a *declared* war.
KEY CLARIFICATION #13: Even if I told you the wildest year-/continent-spanning tale of international collusion between leaders of major nations, not only *wouldn't* it be the first time in history it's happened but most *other* times it was far harder because it was pre-internet.
KEY CLARIFICATION #12: Just as the "presumption of innocence" is, in the law, only a "trial presumption"—meaning non-jurors needn't indulge it, or can apply it however they wish if they do—there's a gulf between when corporate media will say collusion and when normal folks would.
KEY CLARIFICATION #11: *All the public evidence* indicates Trump and his aides "crossed" their illegal coordination with foreign nations—meaning not only did they *not* draw lines between the nations they coordinated with, but figured out ways to *dovetail* all such coordination.
KEY CLARIFICATION #10: To the best of my knowledge—after researching and writing on this case for two years—*no lines of inquiry* in the Trump-Russia investigation (including Prague, the Alfa Bank pings, or anything else) have been disproven, shut down, or moved on from entirely.
KEY CLARIFICATION #9: *Every witness* in the Trump-Russia case with *one* exception—Erik Prince—has a *significantly less robust* history of lying than Trump, and would *decimate* Trump in a "battle of credibility" before a jury, so all evidentiary analyses *must* flow from that.
KEY CLARIFICATION #8: Once Giuliani said—rightly—that *as to his client* the Mueller probe is, until Trump leaves office, a purely *political* matter (i.e., a question of impeachment), *nothing* Giuliani *ever* said could be treated as news or legal analysis rather than rhetoric.
KEY CLARIFICATION #7: It's a violation of journalistic ethics—*always*—to anonymously quote *any* defense lawyer for *any* proposition in *any* story, as defense lawyers are sworn to zealously advocate for a position and *not* to be neutral, open, objective sources for reporters.
KEY CLARIFICATION #6: Lawyers following Mueller's probe know there are collusive criminal acts, non-collusive criminal acts, collusive non-criminal acts, and non-collusive, non-criminal *but still impeachable* offenses—so Trump can be up a creek even if he didn't conspire by law.
KEY CLARIFICATION #5: That the FBI folded its counterintelligence probe into Trump into Mueller's investigation means—contra what the NYT says—that investigation *must* be open, as Mueller has no mechanism or authority to "close" only *parts* of his probe until he reports to DOJ.
KEY CLARIFICATION #4: Because the FBI concluded—based on specific, articulable *public* facts—that there was a reasonable suspicion in May 2017 to think Trump was possibly a Russian asset, anyone who said otherwise (even some lawyers) *wasn't* exhibiting FBI-level case awareness.
KEY CLARIFICATION #3: The FBI having concluded—based on "specific and articulable facts"—that there was a reasonable suspicion in May 2017 to believe Trump was a witting or unwitting Russian asset means *everyone* who said that at the time was exhibiting FBI-level case awareness.
KEY CLARIFICATION #2: When media says we don't know if Trump was a "witting" colluder, they *mean* we don't know if he was "wittingly" a Kremlin *agent*. We *know* he "wittingly" *coordinated* with the Kremlin—see e.g. promoting Papadopoulos after learning he was a Kremlin agent.
KEY CLARIFICATION #1: Based on how Trump (via his lawyer Rudy Giuliani) has defined "collusion"—that is, to mean *only* "conspiring directly with the Kremlin to hack the DNC"—when Trump says "no collusion," he's *literally* only denying 5% of what would be considered "collusion."
@CivRightsAtty They are not synonyms, as discussed in Proof of Collusion; it is absolutely possible to collude in ways that would not be charged as conspiracy
@MargaretOrmrod1 Yes
@thekevster101 Actually, me too, I grew up on fantasy trade paperbacks and wish I'd never had to turn to nonfiction
@mnb84 I too would be much happier if there were no conspiracy to write about		Anyone who loves America would
@ElizMarlowe It'll be in there, I've written about it a bit on Twitter already
@njohnarmour The Treason statute is not in play here because (at least in the legal sense) we are not at war with Russia, a hot cyberwar notwithstanding
@nev_ev Not sure what to say except that they apparently have several hundred other guests who know more about collusion than the guy who wrote a NYT bestseller called Proof of Collusion		Such is life
@SusanSolomon The first 3 pages of PROOF OF COLLUSION cover this topic extensively, and PROOF OF CONSPIRACY is a true sequel, so I'm hopeful people will understand what I'm saying. The sequel massively broadens the story, even as it hones in on a specific set of actions: a criminal conspiracy.
@myleftone Tom I will admit that if this ever becomes a trilogy that is exactly what I hope to title the third book, though truthfully the idea of writing a third book makes me want to crawl into a bed and never get out
10/ When someone asks me whether I'd rather none of this had happened—even if it meant no one ever read my Twitter feed, or had any idea who I was—I write back to them YES even before I've finished reading the question. What a *dead heart* one would have to have to say otherwise.
9/ That's something I hope folks like @KenDilanianNBC will remember: those of us who did *not* think we'd be doing what we're doing now, and didn't ask for it but wanted to help, love America and *never* forget that our research/writing being *wrong* would be *great* for America.
8/ I did an 11-hour interview with @Playboy—yes, you read that right; fortunately, only 4+ hours was recorded, as it was almost ridiculously wide-ranging—two days ago. I was asked if I wake up in sweats worried I'm wrong. I said no because being wrong is the *best-case scenario*.
7/ And apparently I need to say this sometimes, as people do "forget": I love my country and I want to be wrong about all of this. I want to find contrary evidence. I want nothing bad to have happened. It'd be better for America. Those just aren't the facts we have—and I hate it.
6/ The scary part is I could say the same, with this book, for Erik Prince, Elliott Broidy, Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Thomas Barrack, Rick Gates, Joel Zamel, MBS, MBZ, Trump Jr., and Mohammed Dahlan. It's all so bad, folks. It's all really, really, bad. There's *no* good news.
5/ I've done the deepest dive into George Nader's life that I think anyone has—reading scores of articles from media around the world. And *everything's worse* than I imagined. The only thing that keeps me on course is knowing that Nader has been forced to cooperate with Mueller.
4/ I keep saying that as a former criminal defense lawyer and investigator I'm accustomed to even solid "theories of a case" producing some seemingly contrary evidence. This...isn't that. Everything I find is inculpatory. *Everything*. I've never seen anything like it in my life.
@DickTater4ever Yes, that's been why. I'm neck-deep in deep-dive research on some topics harder to work on/through than any I have before.
@tinydancerz90 I'm busting my hump, promise. I am hopeful I can get this story out.
@joeytwostops I liked that too, but it's important to emphasize that this really *is* a sequel to PROOF OF COLLUSION. The narratives in the two books are so inextricably linked that they should be seen as a single decade-spanning, continent-spanning, criminal conspiracy-establishing storyline.
@MukasaAMaat @CNN @MSNBC I was invited on "CNN New Day" this morning, but unfortunately got bumped (no worries—it happens). Hopefully I'll eventually be able to get this meticulously cited story (PROOF OF CONSPIRACY will likely end up with even more endnotes than PROOF OF COLLUSION!) to a wider audience.
3/ There are also events in the book that were lightly reported even in *foreign* media, meaning there's been no effort to link them to the broader Trump-Russia narrative. What I'm saying is, what we thought was the whole (public) story on Trump-Russia is 33% of a bigger picture.
2/ As the subject of PROOF OF CONSPIRACY is pre-/post-election multi-state collusion (Trump-Russia-Saudi Arabia-UAE-Egypt-Israel), I'm building a timeline of events only lightly reported here or exclusively reported in foreign media. This timeline creates...harrowing revelations.
I'm writing the sequel to PROOF OF COLLUSION, and what I'm researching and writing is shocking and terrifying me even more than PROOF OF COLLUSION.		The book's working title is PROOF OF CONSPIRACY.		If PROOF OF CONSPIRACY is a book that'd interest you, I hope you'll retweet this.

4/ There's a carelessness in some quarters in speaking of the Trump-Russia probe that belies the fact it's the most important news story of our era. Poorly sourced scoops on when the probe will end—which equals misleading news on whether there was collusion—is just a part of it.
3/ For instance, if Trump conspired with the Kremlin, or aided/abetted the Kremlin, or solicited assistance from the Kremlin, or helped hide Kremlin crimes, or tried to obstruct investigation into those crimes, those acts would all be illegal even if Trump wasn't a Kremlin agent.
2/ Rather, Mueller's brief is to determine if there was coordination between Trump or his campaign and the Kremlin before, during, or after the 2016 election—which covers all *sorts* of activities (including criminal activities) that fall short of "[working] on behalf of" Russia.
This is not the central question of the Mueller investigation, as saying so raises the bar for Mueller's work *considerably*—forcing him to show that Trump entered a conspiracy with Russia so early that he was legally an *agent* of Russia (working "on behalf of Russia") pre-2015. https://t.co/HfJOlpz2Xh

@BillyBoy2749 May 2017 (when Comey was fired)
@ilanagain Yes—that's exactly what the article I linked to says. Though I think the NYT errs in suggesting it'd be possible to fold a counterintel probe into the Mueller probe and then *just* close the counterintel part *only* as it related to Trump—that's not how Mueller's brief/DOJ works.
5/ While tonight's NYT news is about a counterintel investigation, the fact that by May '17 the FBI had a reasonable basis to think Trump's actions had the effect of aiding Russian crimes and endangering America *does* tell us something about Trump's potential criminal liability.
4/ In PROOF OF COLLUSION, I trace Trump's legal responsibility not to aid or abet Russian crimes in detail. Nearly *all* of his obstructive behavior occurred *after* the date he had sufficient knowledge of Russia's unlawful conduct he was legally prohibited from facilitating it.
3/ By way of (only one) example, I began discussing "aiding and abetting" well over a year ago.		Note what DOJ says: "It does not take much evidence to satisfy the facilitation element once the defendant's knowledge of the unlawful purpose is established." https://t.co/DcYAJ4rKkL
2/ Most Americans have heard of the idea of committing a crime "after the fact"; most Americans know that part of a conspiracy is the cover-up; most Americans know that Trump has deliberately taken actions that benefitted the Kremlin by making its actions harder to detect/punish.
Wittes here catches up to what many of us have said for two years: Trump's obstruction was collusive. But it's not an either/or: the evidence tells us there was also pre-election collusion.		This article seems to hail from 2017—well before all we know now. https://t.co/3KIsAPiIGn
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THIS: https://t.co/m2I7WOdW5K
Here's what's most mind-blowing to me: has *anything* happened in the last 20 months that'd make the FBI *less* concerned about this than it was in May 2017? In other words, on what basis would the FBI have felt comfortable *closing* this probe into Trump being a Russian asset?
THE NEW YORK TIMES: "Following Trump’s firing of James Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau grew increasingly concerned about whether the president’s actions constituted anti-American activity."		Read that sentence as many times as you need to in order to *really* let it sink in.

I bet Trump really hates sentence-long typos like the one on his campaign website saying Mexico would make a "one-time payment of $5 to $10 billion" to pay for the Wall, and also there being no mention there of Mexico paying "billions a year for the Wall through a new trade deal" https://t.co/GZfQOyMy05
