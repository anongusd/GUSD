Also, in The Foreigner, virtually every single martial arts or action move Chan makes in the entire movie is featured in the trailer. smh.
Ok, remake of the movie that would actually be good: Jackie Chan goes for revenge against Irish Republicans, but then quickly finds out that his daughter was killed in a British intel false-flag operation		Then, Jackie Chan joins Sinn Fein and restarts the Troubles singlehandedly
Also, this movie basically casually endorses torture and extra-judicial killing of IRA members at the very end in a flash, like it‚Äôs nothing, and makes Chan a supporting role for way too much of it.
it blows my mind how bad the Jackie Chan movie The Foreigner was. A movie about Jackie Chan taking on the IRA should actually be fun, and not have a Raiders of the Lost Ark flaw in it a la ‚Äúthis movie woulda turned out exactly the same if the protagonist didn‚Äôt exist"

Trump blurting out repeatedly that many of the people around him are being ‚Äúfucking idiots‚Äù		Show me the lie.
A good counterweight to the idiocy on various sides of this issue is the works of Tim O‚ÄôBrien, who served in Vietnam and subsequently, poignantly wrote stories &amp; books detailing his shame for not being ‚Äúcourageous‚Äù enough to be willing to go to jail for resisting the draft.
‚Ä¶who sent countless to kill, die, or be maimed for a war they knew, fairly quickly, was unwinnable.
You can take the well-worn hypocrisy angle, or that he was a rich kid that got out of it when braver, poorer people were forced to go, or even volunteered. But the problem wasn‚Äôt rich people who took (understandable) advantage of their privilege, it was Respected Politicians‚Ä¶

Maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôs best to assess The Troops as individual human beings each with their own desires and motivations rather than as a toy you can trot out then immediately forget about once you‚Äôre done projecting your own geopolitical ambitions onto them
On the off chance you think I‚Äôm sayin Trump is the Good Guy here, a reminder that his air wars are even more brutal than Obama‚Äôs (based on available data), Trump escalated in Afghanistan, &amp; previously said he‚Äôd pullout of Syria but then simply lost interest &amp; didn‚Äôt
thread messed up, so adding this here https://t.co/cTYifWArcp
Trump pointing to the sky and saying the dead troops would want him not to do Syria is maddening, but it‚Äôs still less vulgar to me than scores of politicians who routinely use soldiers living or dead as human shields as they advocate to send them to neverending war and death
...the eventual Vietnam pullout which they blame for the bloodbath in, say, Cambodia, while (obviously) sidestepping the US‚Äôs own role in doing mass murder in both countries &amp; helping the KR‚Äôs ascent.		Those takes don‚Äôt hold up well! Something to consider

The cacophony of the media commentariat, center left and center right, that I recall during the late obama years, post- advent of ISIS, was about how much of a wuss he was and how badly he screwed up in the Iraqi withdrawal...cuz we should have been there for eternity apparently
