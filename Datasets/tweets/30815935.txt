Congress‚Äôs great shame is their willingness to give the NRA an outsized voice on how we enact gun safety. We will keep marching, legislating, advocating, and pushing Congress until they finally deliver gun safety laws that will keep our communities protected.
I am grateful to the men and women in the ranks of our law enforcement who were so quick to respond at the #ThousandOaksShooting. Sheriff‚Äôs Sgt. Ron Helus, who died trying to save lives inside the bar, is a true hero. My heart is with his family today.
My heart is heavy this morning as the Thousand Oaks community recovers from last night‚Äôs horrific shooting. No one should have to lose a loved one in such thoughtless violence.
Our moment has sparked a movement; one that will ignite our state - and this nation - into a brighter future, together.
I will continue to stand with you to organize and build coalitions in our communities, to focus on electing progressive Democrats at every level of government.
Ours was a historic race; one that gave a voice to every hardworking Californian. Thank you to the millions of janitors, home-care workers, nurses, electrical and port workers, students and volunteers who gave their all on this campaign.
Electing Democrats who have the courage of their convictions to move policies that uplift the human condition is a fight we will win, because it is a fight we must win.
Our challenge to California's establishment has shifted the political center of gravity in this state. From abolishing the death penalty to real immigration reform and descheduling cannabis - we have reshaped our Senator's position on a host of issues.
Congratulations to Senator Feinstein on her victory last night. While the results of the election were not what we'd hoped, I am proud to have earned the support of nearly 3 million Californians and 70% of counties throughout the Golden State.

@GregoryWilken You're right, @GregoryWilken - #CA is a donor state. If elected, I'll do everything in my power to make sure that the taxpayer dollars we send to Washington, DC are spent on improving our state.
There is a simple reason why we're surging in the polling and @SenFeinstein is dropping below 40%, it's because Californians of all stripes are tired of politics as usual and want to see meaningful change in how this state is represented in Washington. #resistnotassist #3debates

Protecting #NetNeutrality is far too important to our economy and our way of life. And if the @realDonaldTrump Administration won't protect consumers, the State of California will.
The #CAleg just passed the strongest #NetNeutrality protections in the nation. Today, we put the people of #CA over the profits of special interest groups. Today, we secured a free &amp; open internet for every Californian - not just those who can afford it.
The FCC's decision to repeal #NetNeutrality contradicts the will of most Americans, and it's dangerous because it will restrict American families from lifting themselves out of poverty.
And we know there is a direct link between who can access the internet, and their ability to achieve economic security and stability. #NetNeutrality is just as much about free speech as it is about economic justice.
No company should have the power to slow down your connection; no company should be able to hold your ideas hostage or demand a ransom to access your favorite streaming service or website.
üö® BREAKING: We just sent the #NetNeutrality bill I coauthored with @Scott_Wiener, @SantiagoAD53 &amp; @RobBonta to the Governor's desk. Proud of the work we're doing to protect a free &amp; open internet in #CA, vital to both our democracy and our way of life.

The Republican immigration bills President Trump is supporting will only exasperate the cruel treatment of millions of families in America. At this critical moment - #CA must be clear and unequivocal in its opposition to such policies.

It is incumbent upon our leaders in Congress to act swiftly on comprehensive immigration reforms with a clear path to citizenship. The future of so many hardworking families in America depends on it.
Currently, there is no law that requires children to be detained separately from their parents. This is a policy @realDonaldTrump has implemented with the support of @jeffsessions to further dehumanize asylum seekers.
In addition to the #MissingChildren, since the beginning of this year, over 200 cases of children being separated from their families have been reported in Arizona alone. This practice is inhumane and un-American.
Last year, this administration lost track of nearly 1500 immigrant children. So #WhereAreTheChildren? These reports are disheartening, but they‚Äôre far from surprising. @realDonaldTrump has consistently attacked this country‚Äôs immigrants while actively working against solutions.
We must honor those who serve this country when they come back home, just as we take this day to honor those who never could. No veteran should have to sleep on the streets. #NoPlaceLikeHome provides $2B for housing and supportive services, but we have more work to do.
This #MemorialDay, we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our nation so that we could continue to breathe free.  To the men and women of #SD24 and across the nation who gave their all, thank you.

Our hardworking immigrant families aren‚Äôt ‚Äúanimals‚Äù, Mr. President. The families you‚Äôre tearing apart are people, just like you. No matter how hard you try, you can‚Äôt strip away their humanity.
Last night San Diego joined the majority of Californians in supporting #SB54. Today @realDonaldTrump brought a gaggle of Republican, anti-immigrant politicians from California to the White House, to plot against the policies that keep all of our residents safe. #SB54 #CAValues
By a margin in the millions, Californians overwhelmingly rejected politics fueled by resentment, bigotry, and misogyny and embraced a resistance fueled by diversity and inclusivity. @realDonaldTrump didn‚Äôt stand a chance here. He still doesn‚Äôt.

Recent legal challenges have put the funding on hold, but Californians can‚Äôt afford to wait anymore. #SB1207 would put #NoPlaceLikeHome on the ballot, to make that funding available as soon as possible - because we need to get started building now.
It‚Äôs reprehensible that CA, the 5th largest economy in the world, has one of the largest homeless populations in the country. That‚Äôs why I worked on #NoPlaceLikeHome in 2016 with @Mayor_Steinberg to put $2B into housing and mental health services for the chronically homeless.
Chronic homelessness is a real, life-threatening crisis in CA. From 2016 to 2017 our homeless population increased 14% - to an astounding total of more than 134,000 people. https://t.co/dIn4L4WO6d https://t.co/M2cJTcU3wo
Californians will not stand for regressive and corrupt policy makers  attacks on our environment. While @EPAScottPruitt stays busy lining the pockets of his fossil fuel friends - we‚Äôll be making sure all Californians have access to the clean water &amp; air they deserve. #BootPruitt

Californians have never been fooled into thinking Trump could be a "good president." @realDonaldTrump consistently negotiates against diplomacy and the safety of the American people.

Thank you to the California Nurses Association and @NationalNursesUnited @SEIU_California and @unacuhcp for amplifying the voices of RNs and patients in public policy. I pledge to continue fighting for affordable and quality  healthcare, a universal human right.

It‚Äôs time for D.C. Democrats to stop playing defense on healthcare and go on the offense for working families who can‚Äôt currently afford it. Cost should never be a barrier to quality care.
In 2015 CA's Medicaid expansion cut the number of uninsured Californians almost in half.  Now, proposed federal budget cuts threaten to undo that incredible progress.
Even though California is the 5th largest economy in the world, it leaves far too many Californians behind, forcing them to make an impossible choice: paying for basic necessities or for healthcare. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve worked so hard to expand access to affordable coverage.
Every year, 45,000 Americans die from a lack of access to healthcare.  Health insurance provides access to crucial services, but it comes at a cost. Those who can‚Äôt afford it are more likely to receive substandard care or suffer from undiagnosed conditions.

Bottom line: California will NOT help President Trump, Jeff Sessions or Thomas Homan rip children from the arms of their mothers and fathers.  Here in CA, we embrace our historic diversity, and we will do everything in our legal power to protect it.
Based on Jeff Session's track record in court so far - I like our odds of beating back his racist and xenophobic attack on the CA Values Act.
If Sessions is serious about cracking down on crime, he should stop fretting about CA and look in his own backyard. 2016 FBI stats show crime is far higher in his home state of Alabama than in California.
Our nation‚Äôs Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions is suing CA because we refuse to help the Trump administration tear apart honest, hardworking immigrant families. To that, I say BRING IT ON! CA will not be intimidiated.
We need Congress to pass universal background checks NOW.  CA might have the toughest gun controls, but handguns &amp; assault weapons sold at gun shows in NV translate to a 70% jump in gun violence in nearby parts of CA. Don‚Äôt wait for Trump. Just do it. https://t.co/2TTn2OgAUg

Last month, the Pentagon released an analysis showing that half of all American military installations around the world are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.¬†https://t.co/bb8nFAA9Xd
The U.S. @DeptofDefense calls climate change a ‚Äúthreat multiplier,‚Äù because it intensifies drought, famine, disease and social conflict, creating new populations of refugees and destabilizing entire regions of the world.
The U.S. military is leading the charge to a clean energy future because they understand that climate change is a threat to America‚Äôs national security.
Instead of propping up dying industries that poison our children and threaten the planet, we should be focusing on retraining coal workers. Clean energy is a great place to start.
So don‚Äôt believe for one second that dismantling the #CleanPowerPlan is about jobs or our economy. It‚Äôs not.
Climate disasters cost Americans a record $306 BILLION dollars in 2017, nearly $100 BILLION more than any prior year.¬†https://t.co/C7UQe0c9ho
2017 tied the record for the most billion-dollar disasters in a year ‚Äì including the record wildfires in CA, and the hurricanes that devastated Texas and Puerto Rico.
It also betrays the federal government‚Äôs legal obligation to reduce carbon pollution, at a time when we‚Äôre already seeing the impacts of climate change across the nation.
This proposal puts the short-term profits of coal executives above the public‚Äôs interest in clean air and the long-term health of our planet; It‚Äôs not about coal jobs, it‚Äôs about profits for the President‚Äôs political donors.

Properly vetting would-be gun owners saves lives, period.  Until Nevada enforces their laws, California communities will continue to suffer increased gun violence.
Right now, Californians are paying the price in blood for Nevada‚Äôs weak background check laws. The research is startling: gun violence in CA jumps 69% in the 2 weeks following a gun show in NV. https://t.co/OfLXDd9GQe
Until they do, politicians in our neighboring states like Nevada must stop cowering to the NRA and actually enforce their own voter-approved initiative for universal background checks on gun sales.
Congress has watched over 200 school shootings since Newtown, and two of the worst massacres in American history in Orlando and Las Vegas - and done nothing of substance to change the status quo.
So far this year we‚Äôre averaging one deadly school shooting per week.  Is this just part of the American experience - real American carnage - that we‚Äôre wiling to live with?		Because I‚Äôm not.  It‚Äôs not okay.

@FCC Fundamentally, this is an issue of free speech and free expression; It‚Äôs about who has access to which ideas; who gets to decide what information you see; and how fast your internet works.
@FCC #SB460 will prevent ISP‚Äôs from using deceptive, discriminatory or anti-competitive business practices. It preserves the heart of the FCC‚Äôs net neutrality rules and prohibits ISP‚Äôs from blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. #CANetNeutrality
@FCC We cannot allow the profits and political interests of internet service providers to outweigh the public interest in a free and open internet.

The @SenateGOP tax bill raises taxes on students -- the aspiring educators &amp; innovators that we need to compete in a global economy -- and devastates renewable energy innovation, fastest growing industry &amp; job creator. Just to pad profits of world's richest companies &amp; Wall St.
This tax plan is an insult to millions of Americans. After running a populist campaign appealing to the real frustration and economic insecurity of the middle class, the President and Republicans in Congress are pulling a classic bait and switch.
This #TaxBill is based entirely on faulty math and false promises, and it will only lead to even greater economic inequality in our nation. It's a sick joke, and unless you make more than a million dollars a year, it comes at your expense.

The President-Elect chooses to ignore facts and instead continues to recklessly portray the undocumented community as a lawless population.
The President-elect's heated rhetoric has families living in fear again. School children are feeling the sting of discrimination.
In California, we reject the politics of hate and exclusion. We believe in justice and dignity for all people.
California is the last rock before the continent gives way to the ocean. https://t.co/FZ2OJBGy6f
