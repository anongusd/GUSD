@CarolMattey @MikeRomanoNTCA Will AMG successfully do what it said it can do? I’d say it’s a long shot. I hope they prove me wrong.
@CarolMattey @MikeRomanoNTCA “Service is limited to the coverage area of NextLink wireless network via line of sight.”	“Internet rates reflect the ability to connect to our tower with a sufficient signal within 3 to 4 miles of your residence.”
@CarolMattey @MikeRomanoNTCA AMG/Nextlink’s highest tier service available now is 50 Mbps down, at a cost of $149.95 per month.
@CarolMattey @MikeRomanoNTCA It now has to provide service covering a total land mass many many times greater than its current footprint. And it will use spectrum it does not exclusively control. It will have to acquire or construct new tower assets.
@CarolMattey @MikeRomanoNTCA Take AMG for example. Nextlink won support to provide “above baseline” (100 Mbps down) service. It currently doesn’t offer those speeds anywhere.
@CarolMattey @MikeRomanoNTCA I’m still skeptical. After researching about half the winning bidders, I’d say quite a few are “punching far above their weight.”

Ugh, just had an argument about whether Adnan is guilty. You are killing me #serialpodcast
Sec. 64.2010 - Telecom carriers must take reasonable measures to discover/protect against attempts to gain unauthorized access to CPNI.
But don't the FCC's existing CPNI rules give the Commission authority for data breachs?
But, I think most/all in telecom industry would agree it’s OBVIOUS that TerraCom/YourTel’s data security practices were “unreasonable”
Reasonableness standard of Section 201(b) appears to provide no guidance in the highly complex and sophisticated world of data security...
