Momentum &amp; enthusiasm is clearly w/ GOP. GOP contests have record turnout while Dems lag behind &amp; fallen far short from turnout 8 yrs ago
Dem voters forced to make an impossible choice between 1 candidate facing FBI investigation &amp; another that‚Äôs a self-proclaimed socialist
The Democrat Primary continues to deteriorate into a race to the extreme left
Dems should decide whether they really want to nom someone who so boldly violated public trust with complete disregard for national security
Clinton's misguided belief that she can play by different rules &amp; her endless pursuit of secrecy above all else is a dangerous combo
Each court-ordered email release serves as an alarming reminder of Clinton‚Äôs reckless and dangerous disregard for national security
