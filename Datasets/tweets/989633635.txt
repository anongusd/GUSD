@Peters_Glen @ReisingerAndy @janfug Since CH4 (and black carbon) reductions remove the some of the needed CO2 reductions, the amount of NE will go down to match. Thus it's not a deliberate strategy, it's simply built in to the process via the constraint on total warming.
@Peters_Glen @ReisingerAndy @janfug Given that the IAMs find it hard to reduce emissions at the rate needed in a cost effective manner, they max out on these, and then to maintain &lt;2¬∫C climate have to include NE to make up the difference. Thus the amount of NE is a residual (needed reductions - possible reductions)
@Peters_Glen @ReisingerAndy @janfug Isn‚Äôt this simply a consequence of the fact that negative emissions are effectively calculated as a residual?
@Peters_Glen @ReisingerAndy @janfug But since there is a positive rate of return in reducing CH4 emissions, surely all 'cost optimal' runs will reduce them?
@scottpwaldman Maybe @MichaelGerrard can help?
@scottpwaldman who has standing to demand that that FACA be applied?

@matthewisles but... you could also allocate some of the transportation to the agri sector and some of the electricity etc. So it's not completely clean comparison. However, how much is this is animal husbandry? FAO estimates it's about 14.5% of total GHG emissions https://t.co/iMjNFzcM54
@matthewisles ...it's roughly as seen in the pie chart below (from IPCC (2014)). That includes contributions from methane and N2O (but one could quibble about how that is merged). So agriculture as a whole is about ~25%. https://t.co/BZgM67hpmB
@matthewisles Some of the confusion comes from ppl conflating incommensurate schemes for allocating emissions. It can be done by sector, or by technology, but because diff sectors uses many kinds of technology, you can't mix and match. So by sector...
@haqqmisra @BrendanLMullan @sciworthy @LifeNspace @sanjoymarcel Sure, but the wind and high PE water would have dissipated to heat in any case. Of course, massive utilization of any of this will perturb the system, but I don't think it's as simple as implied. For DH to be important you need to be mining some sort of stored energy.
@WillOremus @roseveleth Part of the pro argument was that the incentives really weren't that large (spread out over 10 yrs etc.). Thus it would make sense that a relatively trivial change wouldn't affect the decision. It's only if they were actually massive would their removal be determinative?
@haqqmisra @BrendanLMullan @sciworthy @LifeNspace @sanjoymarcel Minor point &amp; maybe I'm missing something, but in the paper w/@BrendanLMullan you equate direct thermal heating w/global energy use. However, to the extent the energy comes from renewable sources (solar/hydro/wind) there isn't any additional direct heating from our use of it, no?

@Wells135 It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòso warm‚Äô. It was just warmer than surrounding centuries. And the magnitudes of solar and volcanic variability at the time are about right. Very small changes (a few ppm) in CO2 have correspondingly small impacts on climate. Changes now are much bigger.
@wmconnolley @curaffairs @mtobis @TheEconomist You want to give EM kudos for supporting a mythical unicorn carbon tax but not any conceivable policy. Sorry, but that‚Äôs on a par with the sunny uplands folk.
@AlaskaWx @Climatologist49 @DaveSnider Is this actually predictive of the ice out date?
@theresphysics @jg_environ @ClimateOpp Again. I disagree that this is a problem. It‚Äôs trivially easy to produce a consensus statement saying exactly that X is widely accepted but Y is plausible but not yet fully supported.

@KHayhoe I remain unconvinced by this thesis. e.g. underestimates of Arctic sea ice trends in CMIP3 was due to resolution/physics that were systematic, not because scientists didn't want to make predictions of bigger change.

@kojonkoski @curryja @richardabetts TMT is not a particularly sensitive metric since it combines lower stratospheric cooling with tropospheric warming. Structural uncertainty is high, and we don't (yet) have a good estimate for how sensitive the comparison is to updates in the forcings.
@barryjcooke1 The impact of the putative CO2 decrease (~10 ppm) is small and short-lived. You might get at most 0.1¬∫C cooling (probably less) for a decade or two. I doubt that is detectable in surface temperatures in a single realization.

@nevaudit Sometimes even the foolish child asks a question that the wise child might usefully ponder.
Understanding the timing, extent &amp; drivers of past events helps put the current changes in context. The ice caps discussed in the new paper might be the 1st places where current change is demonstrably the largest since the Eemian, but they aren't likely to be the last.
I ask these Qs not because I think this has the possibility of undermining the new study (which is totally independent), but because we do need to be able to fit all data into our understanding. Just because there were warm periods before, doesn't mean we aren't warmer now.
4) has the tree line already extended to this location? or would it do so even with stable climate from now on?	5) Or is this an area where the changes haven't yet exceeded early Holocene warmth? If so, how much longer will it take?
So the questions are:	1) When was the photo taken? Presumably in the 1970s or early 80s?	2) How fast is the tree line in this region moving?	3) Treeline movement is obviously a lagging indicator (since it takes time for pollen to move and trees to grow), but how long a lag?
Indeed, J.C.Ritchie (who took the photo we started with), had a paper in Nature in 1983 showing the pollen record of white spruce in this area. 	https://doi-org/10.1038/305126a0 https://t.co/FhR79bJmmg
Climate change in this area is substantial. It's warmed more than 1¬∫C in summer, and sea ice is forming later and melting earlier. But we know that this region did have a warm early Holocene period in line with the expectation from orbital forcing. https://t.co/J0sOU9sPuN

Presumably it would warm more, but exactly how much depends on the missing factors (mentioned in the paper), the aerosol efficacy, and the model response. Hard to know until you do it.
@ArgonneForest perhaps.
@ArgonneForest Genuinely don't know.
@ArgonneForest it's not really quantifiable like that.
@ArgonneForest What do you define as reasonable? It's more likely than anything like RCP2.6, but it depends on a lot of decisions...
@dougmcneall pretty good working hypothesis. Sorry about that.

@Sci_or_Fic @Peters_Glen You would have to see. That paper doesn't do the full calculation (since biomass burning affects more than just aerosols), it's missing SL gas phase emissions/coherent land cover effects etc. The claims about tuning and climate sensitivity are wrong tho.

@Peters_Glen @past_is_future @_nadineunger As peter said, I‚Äôm not disputing the science or its uncertainties, merely the apparent suggestion that there is some reluctance - to the point of misconduct - to discuss these effects.
@Sci_or_Fic @Peters_Glen Affected, sure. Significantly affected? not so much. The RF associated with different assumptions will be in the tenth's of W/m2 range, and so will not affected the PIcontrols base climate much.
@Peters_Glen The quote suggesting that scientists would hide results on the albedo or VOC effects. It's nonsense since this has been published on many times. Perhaps the speaker did or didn't hear someone say that, but to suggest it's a widespread opinion is self-evidently nonsense.
@Sci_or_Fic @Peters_Glen We are very aware that both the absolute levels and anthropogenic component of PI biomass burning is uncertain. Ppl are working on better assumptions and we will update the PIcontrols and historical runs as needed. It‚Äôs an important uncertainty to test.
@carolynporco Yes it was. Mostly due to @eroston and @BlackiLi though.

@BlackPhysicists @NatureClimate It's kind of covered in the @RealClimate piece I tweeted earlier. As non-climatic artifacts are removed from the OHC analyses and more data is being ingested from Argo etc, the predictions from GCMs are being nicely validated.
@BlackPhysicists Some discussions of that here in the light of recent updates and discussions: https://t.co/2o1NFCHpWV #iteachphysics
@BlackPhysicists But ocean heat content changes writ large are tied to the planetary imbalance (how much more energy are we bringing in than losing to space). It was predicted in the 1980s that if the predictions of global warming were right for the right reasons, the signal would be in the OHC‚Ä¶
@BlackPhysicists Sea surface temperature is a diagnostic of what‚Äôs happening at the surface (duh!). It‚Äôs the field that has the direct connection to the atmosphere (via radiation, evap etc.). It is changes in SST that allow for the planet to requilibirate to any change in radiative forcing.‚Ä¶
@BlackPhysicists They aren‚Äôt different in principle. But all these models need to have a scale (in time/space) below which they are not resolving the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô equations. For weather models that scale is a little smaller than for climate models, but for both it‚Äôs getting smaller over time.
@BlackPhysicists @RogerAPielkeSr ‚Ä¶ (like Pinatubo), the climate impacts easily exceed the ‚Äònoise‚Äô of the weather. Same with the seasons! (Note ‚Äònoise‚Äô here isn‚Äôt pejorative- one person‚Äôs noise is another‚Äôs signal after all). Bottom line, there is no longer single time period that separates weather &amp; climate.
@BlackPhysicists @RogerAPielkeSr Those climate forecasts were for 1, 2, 3 years out. Much shorter than the ‚Äò30 year‚Äô period you mentioned. The issue is one of signal and noise. For slow changes in forcings (or none), 30 years is a good period to average out a lot of internal variability. But for a big signal‚Ä¶
@BlackPhysicists @RogerAPielkeSr Take Mt Pinatubo eruption. A very large forcing on the climate system, which had detectable impacts on rainfall, temperature, wind patterns. It didn‚Äôt extend the predictability of weather forecasts, however the statistical impacts were predicted skillfully by climate models.
@BlackPhysicists @RogerAPielkeSr That‚Äôs been true historically, but that‚Äôs a little arbritrary and not fundamental. I would prefer a distinction based on forecasts of specific trajectories vs statistics of trajectories. 		An example might help... #iteachphysics
@BlackPhysicists Actually, understanding the notion of skill is key for both kinds of model - how can you judge if a model is useful despite it not being perfect?
@BlackPhysicists Other issues are the diagnostics one is interested in. With weather, you want the specific trajectory of storms/fronts etc, with climate you want the statistical description (how many storms/what tracks) because that is where the skill is. #iteachphysics
@BlackPhysicists ... conservation properties and ingestion of observations. For a weather model, continual updating with observations means small businesses imbalances don‚Äôt matter much. But climate models don‚Äôt ingest obs like this so small biases can build (model ‚Äòdrift‚Äô). Conservation is key.
@BlackPhysicists Atmospheric physics is basically the same - slightly different levels of truncation (spatial resolution etc) since climate models have to run longer and with more components (oceans, sea ice, composition, biosphere (to some extent)). But major difference in....
@BlackPhysicists Here‚Äôs a good metaphor. Climate is the clothes in your closet, weather is what you are wearing right now. The weather is constrained by the climate (you can‚Äôt wear clothes you don‚Äôt have), and the closet can change over time (new purchases/gifts), sometimes abruptly!
@BlackPhysicists Actually no. Once explained - lots of good metaphors available - ppl generally get it. The ‚Äòconfusion‚Äô one sees in punditry is fake - a position taken for rhetorical effect rather than any real misunderstanding. #iteachphysics

@DoctorVive @theresphysics Local events are already happening, and will likely continue to do so (at an increasing rate), and for some those are already catastrophic.
@JosephEdmundKe1 @DoctorVive @theresphysics This, I was pleasantly surprised to hear. But the very next day, I was rather nonplussed when it turned out his presentation was based on a model that did exactly that. I never got an explanation.
@JosephEdmundKe1 @DoctorVive @theresphysics I was sharing a car to go to some event w/Robert Mendelsohn (yale economist), and I ask him about this directly - "how can you justify using ~T^2 for damages?". And he swears blind that no-one does such a thing anymore.
@JosephEdmundKe1 @DoctorVive @theresphysics not in the slightest. This is just a simple formula that some economists plug into their models. It's not based on anything other than convenience. But that reminds me...
@DoctorVive @theresphysics hmm.... The point of 1.5¬∫C or 2¬∫C is not that these are points at which something catastrophic happens, but rather (like speed limits) they are assessments of where risks are increasing rapidly. Global damages will be a mostly smooth, but increasing, function of temperature
@climatecal not specifically. Might be worth doing though.
@richardabetts @rahmstorf @IPCC_CH @metoffice Probably still disagree with that. People are interested in year-to-year variability (which leads to both decadal forecasting and to interest in GMST variability).
@afreedma Not clear. It's still penciled in for Jan 17. If we are still shutdown then, then it will obviously not happen. But if we come back before then, we'll have to assess how long it will take to bring it up to speed. Ask me again next week.

@richardabetts @rahmstorf @IPCC_CH @metoffice I'm disagreeing w/the pt you made in the tweet I responded to, namely: "The interest in temperature evolution over a small number of years  largely arises from a research focus on interannual to decadal  forecasting.". This is backwards. Interest happens before research foci.
@richardabetts @rahmstorf @IPCC_CH @metoffice Quote: "There is, however, particular interest in the coming decade, which represents a key planning horizon for infrastructure upgrades, insurance, energy policy, &amp; business development."	Or are you arguing that Smith et al were working on something no-one cared about?
@climateunion @KHayhoe @MichaelEMann @climate_ice Teeny-weeny. 		Estimated flux from Greenland Ice Shelf is 2.1 Gg CH4/yr, compared to total atmospheric sources of ~550 Tg CH4/yr.

@symbish_Sam yes. the specific issue is that it's a giveaway to coal plant operators. But more generally, it's simply a terrible way to conduct policy analyses.
@symbish_Sam exactly. we know that these pollutants have costs, so further reductions  due to these regs are a net benefit (which the new rule wants us to ignore).
@symbish_Sam there's no double counting. Reducing mercury emissions has the benefit of reducing other known criteria pollutants - which is a positive benefit. The new rules would disallow that benefit from being counted at all!
Worth noting that policy-making in the absence of understanding (and valuing) the co-benefits (or side effects) is policy-making devoid of any broad societal goal. It exemplifies the opposite of the joined-up thinking that is needed. https://t.co/Q0dGjnwlm0

@shubclimate Again, so what? The claim is not that every wiggle is anthropogenic but that the long term trends are.
@shubclimate So what? No-one is saying there isn‚Äôt  some decadal or longer variability. But this doesn‚Äôt much affect the longer term trends (which are attributable to anthro drivers). (PS Jonathan has made it clear he has no interest in discussing anything with me, so I untagged him).
@shubclimate Ah... the old argument from personal incredulity. Always a winner.
@shubclimate Why not read the paper I linked?
@clivehbest @mtobis @shubclimate Nope again. These are 60 yr trends anyway, so a 60 yr oscillation is irrelevant. The internal variability is embedded in the error bars, so you are double counting anyway.
@clivehbest Nope. Not how fingerprint attribution works at all. Clue. It doesn't use the transient all forcing runs which you incorrectly believe have been tuned to give the correct trend.
@clivehbest @shubclimate Sigh... the errors are not independent, so RMS combination is not correct. Really, we‚Äôve been over this a dozen times - there is an overlap in the aerosol and GHG signature which makes detection of the ANT signal easier than the individual terms.
@clivehbest @shubclimate People have explained it many times. That you haven‚Äôt understood it is another issue altogether. But sure, let‚Äôs agree it‚Äôs just ‚Äòmagic‚Äô in the Arthur C Clarke sense.

@ChuckKutscher @KevinClimate @KOSullivanIT @think_or_swim Your use of tense is incorrect. "Became" is more accurate than "was" (at least in reference to his time at NASA - which he left in 1981. At that time he supported the work on GCM development and was concerned.
@StottPeter @GarethSJones1 @climpeter @GregFlato @richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @_richardblack @IPCC_CH (Frankly nor do I). 	All of those things are fine and good. 	But science is also a social activity, done by people, and there can be missteps that create more heat than light.
@GarethSJones1 @climpeter @GregFlato @richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH Of course. The long term trends are far more robust and easier to attribute. This kerfuffle is mostly an inside baseball discussion - but hopefully one that helps us improve going forward.
@KevinClimate @KOSullivanIT @think_or_swim I think he worked at Greenbelt (not GISS), and in any case left there before I started working w/NASA in 1996. But, you are correct, his is very clearly a minority view.
@GarethSJones1 @climpeter @GregFlato @richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH No. I'm demonstrating that it was over-confident to solely rely on a specific well-designed (but not complete) error model. (I'm not criticising the HadCRUT ensemble here).
@climpeter @GregFlato @richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH Of course - all of these things are works in progress. But even from comparing Ch2 and BoxTS3 it should have been clear (at the time) that HadCRUT4 ensemble spread was too small. With upgrades to the obs products since then, it's even clearer. https://t.co/VCImOJbhaF
@climpeter @GregFlato @richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH PS. We have a fuller uncertainty analysis for GISTEMP under review. Should be out soon.
@climpeter @GregFlato @richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH The calc that we want is the probability that the obs could be drawn from the model pdf. But as we know, the CMIP5 histogram is not a pdf, the 'obs' don't measure quite the same thing as the model output, and the unc. in the trend given a single realization != ensemble spread.
@climpeter @GregFlato @richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH There is some subtlety here that merits some thought. (The Ch2 calcs are fine - tho w/90% vs 95% CI above). But do you agree that the unc. on the HadCRUT4 ensemble is under-estimated in panel a?

@richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter @GregFlato But the GISTEMP mean line could easily be drawn from the CMIP5 histogram. So what would need to be explained?
@ArgonneForest Probably just some confusion btw ‚Äòpoints of no return‚Äô/‚Äòthresholds‚Äô/‚Äòtipping points‚Äô at local or regional levels are being lumped together. Some of these have indeed been passed already.
@richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter @GregFlato Which means that the impression given of something that needs to be explained in fig 1a, is illusory. I hadn't realised this about this figure before now.
@richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter @GregFlato I think there is a deeper issue. The HadCRUT4 ensemble pdf does not sample the full structural uncertainty in estimating GMSAT (the impact of spatial coverage/the SST vs SAT diff/etc.), nor does it include the standard OLS error. The CMIP5 ensemble is not commensurate. 1/2
@richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter This adds the GISTEMP (vintage Jan 2013) trends + 95% CI. 	The HadCRUT4 ensemble is much tighter than the OLS uncertainty. https://t.co/VQzi7XEUdD
@richardabetts @ret_ward @rahmstorf @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter Richard, this isn't really the point. All of those things are fine. But here's a question. In Fig. 1 of Box TS.3, why was only HadCRUT4 plotted?

@richardabetts @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter But the focus on the hiatus in AR5 was due to pressure from the govts. on the authors to address it. Is that not 'political pressure'?
@richardabetts @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter This is ref'd to the prior Lewandowski paper, not to anything in these. But frankly, it isn't absurd. We research things we think may be 'interesting' &amp; that does not occur in a vacuum. Thus some research was v. likely done because it was an issue in the public discussion.
@richardabetts @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter Not seeing where they are speculating on motives. Neither do they claim that it wasn't legitimately interesting. But partly the confusion *was* driven by conflicting definitions in the literature, and that (IMO) did have impact.
@richardabetts @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter I didn't say they were necessarily correct. But if (as we all claim in our grant applications) our research has influence on public policy, then discussing that impact (good or bad) is legit. (btw there clearly are research directions that are not followed for societal reasons).
@_richardblack @richardabetts @IPCC_CH The AR5 got ahead of the science they were supposed to be assessing (for understandable reasons) on this specific topic. A section setting out all the issues w/o concluding anything (since it was still an active discussion) would have been wiser.
@richardabetts @StottPeter @_richardblack @IPCC_CH @climpeter Not really. I doubt you are actually claiming that nothing that happens in the literature has real world effects. So if it does, should it not be discussed?

@aaronhuertas Things can change quickly is all I'm saying.
@aaronhuertas Again, that may be. But to base arguments on voting reform on partisan gain makes the whole situation very tricky. There have a few cases where systems changed two or three times back and forth because each party was only focused on the short term advantage.
@aaronhuertas Maybe, but maybe not. Running under a different system leads ppl to do different things - who stands/who votes etc. Would Clinton have won in 92? Would instant runoff have helped Dems in the MS Senate race?
@aaronhuertas No. Ranked choice is good because ppl can vote for who they want without wasting their vote and eventual winner has a mandate. But ppl supporting voting reform for partisan reasons in narrow situations are fooling themselves and making it harder to achieve. cf. Australia‚Ä¶

@smith_valence @seanmcarroll That's exactly my point.
Minor development in the Resplandy et al discussion:	"We are aware the way we handled the errors underestimated the uncertainties.  We are working on an update that addresses this issue. We thank Nicholas Lewis for bringing this to our attention." (from https://t.co/VhyT2ALB7q).
@smith_valence @seanmcarroll Maybe, maybe not. There are lots of useful predictions made at 'higher levels' that have approximations or assumptions at the base. Whether those are salient is very context dependent.
@smith_valence @seanmcarroll I doubt that drug simulations will be incorporating general relativity in the calculation, so you know ahead of time that the physics is 'wrong'. Yet you are (rightly) confident that it may still be useful.
@smith_valence @seanmcarroll There's nothing conceptually different between climate models or more fundamental/simple ones - it's just easier to see with complex models that no perfect map (less than the size of the universe) is ever achievable.
@DrJaneFlegal That's a valid point. And of course, if there are undisclosed value judgements baked in at the beginning, it makes it harder still. My plea would be for more transparency on that aspect.
@Rongreen5 @seanmcarroll Exactly. The only sensible statements about a model relate to its usefulness or skill, not it's truth.
@DrJaneFlegal It's not supposed to resolve values questions, but rather to inform them. If you don't actually know what the net impacts of a policy will be, it's a little hard to decide whether it's a good thing or not!
@DrJaneFlegal What are the net effects (economic/climate/air quality/public health) of practical policy action X compared to Y or not-X?  Where X,Y are real things that could be passed into law or regulations (RE standards/carbon fee/efficiency mandates/subsidies etc.).
@seanmcarroll But why do you have any confidence that they will? Surely the history of radical conceptual updates to get progressively more useful theories gives you some pause?
@DrJaneFlegal I'm not a fan of IAMs at all - or indeed most aggregated modeling efforts. But if you look at the actual policy realm (as opposed to target setting discussions), they barely feature. In fact, there is a crying need for more models that answer real questions policymakers have.

@daveypower @Ciquah @nytimes Your logic is faulty. It's no surprise that climate changes can affect the carbon cycle (solubility/biosphere/circulation etc.), and neither is it a surprise that greenhouse gas changes affect the greenhouse effect and hence climate. So it's not either/or, it's both.
@daveypower @Ciquah @nytimes Those changes seem to fit well with volcanic/solar drivers, perhaps with a little land use change thrown in. Hard to be as precise for then since we don't have ocean heat content or stratospheric data that allow us to be far more confident about recent change.

Are you getting confused with the bet that was made? https://t.co/jJdZ4bhdzS
@MichaelWWara @Maldoror969 @Lars_Feld Sure. But I've seen many occasions where attempts to 'make it real' using this specific analogy fall completely flat.
@TedNordhaus @theresphysics @DrJaneFlegal @DrKateMarvel @GlobalEcoGuy All public communication is advocacy (for something). Might as well get used to that and define it for yourself so that other people's expectations/projections don't set up impossible expectations.
@MichaelWWara @Maldoror969 @Lars_Feld My point is that scales of temperature for planets has nothing to do on a fundamental way with scales of human internal body temperatures. The only illuminating scale is one that ties the changes to things that have happened to the planet before (hence the ice age unit).
@judsondoyle4 @MichaelEMann That argument relies on something else, that temperature changes (caused by orbital forcing/ice sheets) come prior to CO2 changes in the ice cores. But that's exactly what you expect given that the carbon cycle/biology is dependent on climate. Feedbacks go in both directions.

@RJinBaltimore @marcorubio @jaketapper No. MSU observations are different from the surface record and have larger structural errors. If you want more info on possible issues with the external forcings in CMIP5 see https://t.co/nFcxSji0sV
@judsondoyle4 @MichaelEMann Time-scale is a bit too long. Everything else being equal, temperatures will start to rise as soon as CO2 does, but because of the thermal inertia of the system, you get a lag before the full effects are seen. But are you sure that you have phrased their argument correctly?
@MichaelWWara argument by analogy isn't terribly good though. Why should a planet's temperature change have the same scale of impacts as if it were a human body? Better off talking about real impacts (on ice/soil moisture/rain/heat etc.).

@SalKrinkle interesting question. Because the ocean is stratified (lighter water on top, heavier below), adding heat and freshwater to the surface increases the stratification, making it harder to mix heat/FW down. This leads to more heat accumulation at the surface (so warmer).

@robbynewton Not really. Total volume would definitely go down. Diff between ice density and sea water is much more than density effects alone.
@dougmcneall @climpeter @ed_hawkins @GarethSJones1 @DrKateMarvel All the fields are in CMIP5 HistoricalMisc - knock yourself out.
@LindaLarsonKemp Well that‚Äôs not right at all. With more water in the oceans that pushes the ocean crust down a little slightly compensating for the extra water (over a thousands of years).
@Mike_Page At STP seawater with 35g/kg salt has a density of 1023.6 kg/m3 compared to 1000 kg/m3 for fresh water. So the latter.
@LindaLarsonKemp umm... that's actually true. It's called isostatic rebound.

This is wrong on multiple levels. First, sea level is rising because of ice on land melting (mountain glaciers, Greenland + W Antarctica). Second, contrary to popular opinion, melting sea ice *adds* (a bit) to sea level rise since it is fresher than ocean water (thus less dense). https://t.co/3ceulLAGAP

@d_olivaw @JosephMajkut @Eaterofsun @DrJaneFlegal @VariabilityBlog Yet another shoddy paper (sincere though) that tried to game the system (unsuccessfully). Actually a demo that almost anything can (almost) get published.
@Eaterofsun @DrJaneFlegal Also @VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @d_olivaw
@d_olivaw @VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy Meh. A much better approach is to simply except that peer review is - even at it's best - an imperfect filter for truth, and that we should be vigilant in performing post-publication assessment of anything important.
@VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy This has nothing to do with the reproducibility crisis.
@d_olivaw @VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy There is abundant evidence that w/ enough effort anything can get through peer review if you persist. The SciGen effort showed that clearly. Biased studies to look only for a specific suspected political bias are thus almost guaranteed to confirm their initial hypothesis (bias).
@d_olivaw @VariabilityBlog @NRO @reason Of course, shoddy scholarship should be criticized - that isn't the issue at all. But making up shoddy scholarship and then criticizing that is not moving anything forward. It's just a more elaborate strawman argument.
@VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy I have no idea why you think doing hoax scholarship and it being used to condemn whole fields of research is in any way, shape or form, adding to the quantity of high quality important research.
@d_olivaw @VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy In our field there are sincerely shoddy articles published all the time - papers claiming that CO2 is not a greenhouse gas, that climate is controlled by the outer planets, etc. It doesn't mean that the whole field is corrupt.
@VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy Really? Ppl think there is a problem in scholarship, they do hoax scholarship, it gets reported as an example of the problem in scholarship, reinforcing the impression that this is what the problem in scholarship produces.

@wmconnolley @VariabilityBlog @NRO @reason Really? Voluntary peer review is hard enough without reviewers having to do investigative work to verify that the paper isn't totally fraudulent.
@d_olivaw @VariabilityBlog @NRO @reason That's valid. But once people are writing articles using the evidence from on the hoax to reinforcing the narrative that academia is filled with crazy? That has crossed a line. It would be equivalent to yr hacker not notifying the system owner of the vulnerability.
@VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy Strawman. You aren't addressing the ethical issue.
@VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy I repeat, how is it ethical to not notify journalists/media that their stories on 'crazy academics' were based on hoax articles? This is after the peer review at the journal was tested and found wanting.
@VariabilityBlog @JosephMajkut @NRO @reason @jtlevy No-one needs any more evidence that crap makes it through peer review. You just need to look at the crap, you don't need to make more crap.
@VariabilityBlog @NRO @reason But when the press is reporting on your hoax as if it was real, how do you justify continuing the test? (articles were in June, revelations in October. Article has been retracted, news stories have not been).
@VariabilityBlog @NRO @reason Um... the alternative would be not submitting hoax articles to journals? 		I find myself (and most of my colleagues) quite capable of meeting that bar.
How is it ethical to produce hoax scholarship supposedly to highlight craziness in academia and not say anything when @NRO and @reason write articles using the hoax paper as evidence for... wait for it ... craziness in academia?

@ArgonneForest @HM_Quitters It's a concern. But this is likely to be a detail compared to the main feedbacks to increasing CO2 (water vapour, clouds, ice-albedo etc.).
@icey_mark @sheldonbacon @RippethT @IanMBrooks Even in 1961 ppl knew that this isn‚Äôt true in salt water, surely?
@HM_Quitters This isn‚Äôt terrifying. Interesting though.
@jamesannan the point they are making is that it's better that the carbon comes out as methane as opposed to CO2. That's sdrawkcab.
Tech note: factor of 12 is the 100 yr GWP scaled by the ratio of atomic masses of each gas ie 34*16/44. If you have 12 kg of C, that makes 16 kg of CH4 or 44 kg of CO2. Global Warming Potential is a function of the total mass emitted compared to mass of CO2.
For the same amount of carbon emitted as methane (CH4) rather than carbon dioxide (CO2), climate impacts are much greater (by a factor of ~12 over 100 yrs). Also the CH4 oxidizes to CO2, so very long term impacts are identical.
This paragraph is completely backwards. https://t.co/EbsN0jVaoP
This is interesting (and beautifully illustrated) but there are some odd statements. https://t.co/HbjzSq8abF

@Sci_or_Fic You aren't comparing like with like. To get equivalent CO2 emissions they are using GWP100 - which is an estimate of the 100yr impacts of the emissions. This is not what a climate model responds to. The RF is the relevant quantity - as I already showed.
@Sci_or_Fic I'm really not following you. a) the growth didn't start in 1990, nor did the scenarios. b) I already showed the match of GHG concentrations (and RF) associated with them. If you think that's wrong, redo it and show me where.

Once more for the hard of learning: Attribution is *always* a model-based exercise. The real world just happened once, and if you want to know what it would have done w/o factor X, you need a model (physical/statistical/whateverical). https://t.co/aXTMkM7zJZ
@hillkatydr yes. I was thinking "unsurprising". Thanks for the catch.
@danrothenberg No clue. @MaibachEd or @ecotone2 might know.
There's something to be said for that. But it's also clear this is a 'first draft'. Post-storm analyses will be better &amp; more robust. Will they change the main thrust of these results? Unlikely - similar thermodynamic effects can be seen in many previous studies (Harvey, Katrina)
But more importantly, what are we gaining from doing this in real time vs. doing it more comprehensively later on? 	One correspondent suggests that it's simply to demonstrate that there is a climate change signal in what is occurring while people are paying attention.
What is the spread amongst the ensemble members? How well is the ensemble mean characterized? How robust would this be with a different model? (hard) Does it matter how good the prediction is? (ie does the attribution depend very sensitively on the exact path or intensification?)
While the overall direction of the results are unexpected (higher rainfall, longer time as an intense storm), the specific numbers are not going to be as robust. 	A few questions to ask...
Each experiment is an ensemble - in this case using perturbed physics - and the estimated attribution (in rainfall amounts/intensity etc.) are estimated using the differences in the ensemble means.
The basic idea is fine: make initialized predictions of Florence with observed background state, and then with a background state from which you subtract the estimated anthropogenic warming/moistening. Then see what's different.

@bobkopp @RisetoClimate @PolicyIntegrity @theNASEM @CassSunstein Discount rates and their rationale are far more of a value-based discussion and so you aren‚Äôt ever going to get a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô answer.
@bobkopp @PolicyIntegrity Sure you can. Tariffs (cf Nordhaus‚Äô carbon club) or legal processes in foreign courts for local damages. But none is as efficient as simply using the right SCC. My point was not they politics though, but the principle.
@bobkopp @PolicyIntegrity No. That‚Äôs not coherent because you still want to price the emissions of others that affect you. That leads inevitably to a consideration of global damages even if everyone is just like you.
@IsotopeThomas @holy_kau Not so surprising if you didn‚Äôt think that d18O was a proxy for local rainfall in the first place!
@pluckow The absolutely value is not really a legal question but the rationale might be.
@bobkopp @PolicyIntegrity All fair enough, but there is no underlying principle that both recognizes that there is a harm and ends up with a local cost only SCC.
@JasonBordoff @jmklopp1 @WSJ You should be clear that these choices are not simply arbitrary but actually economically nonsensical. It would make more of difference coming from @WSJ than from me: https://t.co/I6c8Fx6VaK
There is simply no rational economic basis for this change. And I expect that to feature prominently in the (sigh) many lawsuits to come.
... with all the counter-suits, you would end up with a social cost where we started ($1000 per T), but now with all the additional legal fees as well. And you know they aren't cheap!
Ah... but you might argue that you need a different mechanism for cross-border damages. Perhaps N-1 international lawsuits to force the other countries to provide the rest of the needed compensation? That would indeed do it, but...
This wouldn't matter for a local pollution source that only had local effects, but for any pollutant (hello CO2!) for which the impacts are the same regardless of where it's emitted, focusing only on the local impacts of local emissions is economically &amp; ethically illiterate.
What went wrong is everyone ignoring most of the downstream impacts of their actions, and so the whole principle of 'polluter pays' falls apart. A country might only suffer 1/N of the global damages, but they are still being affected by the other N-1 countries pollution too.
And yet.... the amount of total damage is still the same ($1 million/N in each country), but each country is only raising 1000/N^2 in compensation, or 1/N of what is needed. For N=20, it would fall short by a whopping 95%. What went wrong?
You can do the same thing w/N sources in N countries &amp; you can convince yourself (perhaps) that the social cost would be $1000/N per T for whatever N. That means the more a pollutant source is distributed, the less you need to charge to alleviate the damage it does to you. Magic!
But the times being what they are, both countries decide that the global cost is not their problem, and they only care about the damages that happen to their country (half of them) from their emissions. So they set the social cost to 0.5*$1 m/1000=$500 per T (a 50% decrease!).
Now let's imagine that there are only two countries with a single source each and the damages are spread equally. Nothing has changed since the first calculation, and so the standard (global) compensation for each country's emissions is the same: $1000 per T.
Here's a thought experiment. Imagine there is a pollutant (say, with a total of 1000 tonnes/yr) that we know causes $1 million in global damages. The damages per tonne are then $1 million/1000=$1000 per T &amp; that'd be what you'd want to charge to compensate the ppl that were hurt.
The least defendable change in the ACE plan is the following:	"E.P.A.... focused solely on damages that occurred within the borders of the United States, rather than looking at harm to other countries as well."	Sounds kinda reasonable!! But you need to look deeper...
A simple way to think of the SCC is as how much you'd need to compensate someone for the harm that your incidental emissions did. It's an additional cost that you'd want to take account of perhaps before making a decision.
The social cost is a difficult thing to estimate accurately to be sure - there was a whole Natl. Academies report on it in 2017: https://t.co/G6bxRffp29
Part of the change in EPA reasoning about the new ACE proposals compared to the Clean Power Plan is a change in the 'social cost of carbon'. This might sound obscure, but it's important and the changes they made are not kosher. Read on...	https://t.co/QDpSPiRp5T

I'm not claiming that we are yet down to levels of Arctic sea ice that were typical for the early Holocene, and it clearly takes more than a couple of weeks to start producing beaches, but it's curious how close we are to matching what even 7 years ago seemed far away.
This is from a paper by Svend Funder and colleagues (2011) https://t.co/pB7stzcllM who went to these beaches and dated the driftwood and other carbon to between 8.5 and 6 ky ago when because of stronger summer sun, the Arctic was warmer than today. https://t.co/W13BvN6P03

But maybe I‚Äôve missed something? Feel free to let me know.
To conclude. Real time attribution of increasing heat waves to human climate change is solid. This has been predicted, and predictions are playing out. Same with reductions in cold snaps and increasing intensity of precipitation. Everything else (IMO) is a work in progress.
Finally, fires. This is tricky - not because of the anthropogenic part - deliberate arson, accidental human disturbances and suppression and climate (drying, lightning changes) are all human related of course. But we want to parse out which are causal.
For events that more dynamic in nature - depending more fundamentally on the weather regime or synoptic pattern - ice storms, derechos, tornado swarms, etc, it‚Äôs more ambiguous &amp; both model credibility &amp; signal to noise will be less. So real time attribution is less likely.
... the more likely you can find a anthropogenic signal. So heat waves are more likely, cold snaps less likely &amp; precipitation more intense. These results are now so ubiquitous you can skillfully predict ahead of time what the general attribution will be (tho not the exact frac).
But there are now many bespoke studies done after the fact for many specific extremes - flooding in the UK, European heat waves in 2003 &amp; 2010, downpours during Harvey, Katrina etc and they show a clear pattern: the closer an event is to a thermodynamic process....
We have lots of modeling w/ &amp; w/o anthropogenic climate change in #CMIP (w/more to come), and extremes like regional heat waves, cold snaps &amp; precipitation intensity are well resolved, credible &amp; evaluatable against the historic record. Not so good for storms, tornadoes or fires.
Which means you are limited in terms of the class of event you can look at to those that are definable and extractable from the database you have already. If that data set didn‚Äôt resolve fires, or hurricanes, then tough - you aren‚Äôt going to be able to use it to say much.
This needs a lot of modeling - statistical emulators or physics-based models, incl. climate models etc. But if you want real-time attribution that modeling has to exist already (since you don‚Äôt have time to do a bespoke study).
Second point is that to attribute extremes in the way we have been doing (i.e. is there a greater chance of it happening now than before we affected the climate?), we need big data in order to estimate the likelihood of these rare events - tails of the distributions.
First thing to realize is that it depends on the kind of event. Heat waves, intense rainfall, fires, storms and so on have different dynamics (spatial scales, necessary background conditions etc).
This thread is interesting. What are the real prospects for real time attribution of extreme climate events? https://t.co/JUH8ZPxsXE

@DoctorVive @nevaudit @mtobis @jg_environ @pashulman @CColose @theresphysics @PeterBrannen1 @ColdWarScience @stevenmosher truth is the highest goal, and by demonstrating allegiance to truth over self-serving and flattering narratives, we build credibility - and that is probably the best defense against Cruzean BS. Perhaps.
@EthonRaptor @DoctorVive @nevaudit @mtobis @jg_environ @pashulman @CColose @theresphysics @PeterBrannen1 @ColdWarScience @stevenmosher But you can only really test your understanding by making predictions  (otherwise how do you differentiate ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô from a convenient ‚Äòjust so‚Äô story?).
@DoctorVive @nevaudit @mtobis @jg_environ @pashulman @CColose @theresphysics @PeterBrannen1 @ColdWarScience @stevenmosher My answer is that the political component (however defined) is irrelevant. Predictions can be tested or evaluated by anyone (and that is ultimately why science works).
@DoctorVive @nevaudit @mtobis @jg_environ @pashulman @CColose @theresphysics @PeterBrannen1 @ColdWarScience @stevenmosher All science is wrong, but some of it is useful... I‚Äôm not sure why anyone is defending science as ‚Äòtruth‚Äô in a heavily philosophical tweet convo. The best we can ask for is skillful predictions, not ultimate reality.
@DoctorVive @nevaudit @mtobis @jg_environ @pashulman @CColose @theresphysics @PeterBrannen1 @ColdWarScience @stevenmosher Possibly. But trying to maintain (unarguably) popular and widespread fictions about ‚Äòscience‚Äô in order to counter Cruzean disinformation is not sustainable.
@DoctorVive @nevaudit @mtobis @jg_environ @pashulman @CColose @theresphysics @PeterBrannen1 @ColdWarScience @stevenmosher Of course that is the intent. But there are two possible responses: a) science is apolitical therefore legitimate, or b) science can have complex origins but its utility can be independently affirmed.		The problem with (a) as a strategy is that it is easy to find counterpoints.
@DoctorVive @nevaudit @mtobis @jg_environ @pashulman @CColose @theresphysics @PeterBrannen1 @ColdWarScience @stevenmosher That some ppl attack inconvenient scientific results as politicized does not imply that valid and useful science must therefore have an apolitical genesis. Indeed, you appear to be granting an implicit warrant for all science (however well evaluated) to be suspect.
@mtobis Because a) it‚Äôs true (and that has obvious benefits), and b) it‚Äôs a counterpoint to the (false) narratives that science is pure/objective/disinterested that have been used for centuries to privilege some value systems over others.
@mtobis Distinct doesn‚Äôt mean exempt from the political background and power structures.

@FabiusMaximus01 @wildweatherdan Your claim about Hargreaves (2010) not being mentioned in my blog post is patently incorrect. It is mentioned, linked and referenced, and indeed is the basis for the update to the skill assessment for the H88 runs.
@YYCtj1 My tone has nothing to do with anything. Instead, download the data, read the paper and check it out yourself. If you decide on reality based on how nice someone is in twitter you will be played for a fool.

@drjoshlarsen @AndrewDessler There are lots of contrary people in science (and I have sometimes been so described) but I do not find that they are perfectly correlated with the set of ppl who are nice, nor who are correct.  But sometimes you can find all three.
@drjoshlarsen Not following you. Are you arguing that the science community shouldn't criticise the ppl who make these poor arguments?
@drjoshlarsen People risk their scientific reputation not in espousing contrary ideas, but in doing it poorly - cherry picking/jumping to conclusions/making logical leaps/using ad hom and other fallacious arguments.
@Meweesi You don‚Äôt need a PhD to see where ppl are being underhand - talking about CO2 at the top of a paragraph and assuming that this covers all greenhouse gases when they (and now you) know that there are others.
@Meweesi feel free to link the tweets in the discussion.

@RealClimate version here: https://t.co/hldVdrc3Wh
@TJ05650196 Not sure what the question is (both figures the same), but there is plenty of background and FAQs at the GISTEMP site if you are curious about how global temperature estimates are put together: https://t.co/y41ZoMbvUD
Much better analyses are available from @hausfath and others. https://t.co/UWFzD1pEjV
And then they end with a lame cliche about the science not being settled. I mean, FFS. 		We need a better class of climate dismissives. These guys aren‚Äôt even trying anymore.
They totally ignore that the net forcing (easily calculated from the GHG projections) was higher in Scenario A and B than the real world https://t.co/fqXrSRKrmf
They don‚Äôt appear to understand that ENSO is an internal mode of variability in the system and that it would be impossible for Hansen et al to ‚Äòaccount‚Äô for the observed time series in their projections. Note that the model did not have a dynamic ocean in any case.
Then they (rightly) state that the long term trends are important but then spend their time special pleading to remove the 2015/6 El Ni√±o in the obs, and the episodic volcanic forcing in the projections - neither of which much affect the trends.
Blatant misrepresentation of the forcings in the Hansen 1988. They look at the CO2 trends (which were well predicted) and elide into saying that the greenhouse gas forcing was correct - ignoring the other GHGs https://t.co/ew7mpIXB7M

@bobathon Experiment year.
@kyitroot You can read that off the graph - it's about 0.4¬∫C. But probably ¬±0.2¬∫C.
Ok - that's enough. If you want more details on these analyses, please check out our new paper in JGR: 	https://t.co/wlor0EtNRJ		Now back to your regularly scheduled chaos.
But is this really anything like the Younger Dryas? 		You be the judge. https://t.co/vTXvyxzNYE
The trigger for the collapse/recovery seems to be the hemispheric balance of temperature. The SH is slow to warm, so sub-polar water density in each hemisphere initially converges, triggering a collapse (and NH cooling). When the NH eventually catches the SH, the AMOC restarts. https://t.co/jHv9CiAsNz
Rather it depends on the sensitivity of atmospheric fluxes to cooling. In the models that flip, the change in evaporation for a change in SST in the North Atlantic is stronger (which is destabilizing). A big evap decrease when the surface cools decreases salinity &amp; density.
Looking at the differences btw models that flip and those that don't, it has nothing to do with standard ocean diagnostics of circulation stability (one would predict all models would be stable based on FW budgets).
In these simulations, some threshold is clearly crossed and - depending a little on the initial conditions and the scenario - the same phenomenon occurs ¬± a hundred years in timing. Oddly, in a v. similar model (minus only an aerosol indirect effect on clouds), nothing happens.
In at least 3 simulations (w/same model &amp; w/strong forcing &gt;7 W/m2), there's a relatively fast shutdown in the AMOC, a long multi-century period w/o overturning circulation, &amp; then a v. rapid overshoot &amp; recovery. Note that there aren't *any* external freshwater sources here.
3 kinds of experiment here, abrupt increases to 4xCO2, ramped up CO2 (at 1%/yr) and the standard RCP runs, all run for multiple centuries... 		Notice anything? https://t.co/LeP44EQwGu
Buried in that graphic are some interesting variations... I'll talk about some of the GISS models.
So, let's look elsewhere. For instance, what are the really long term responses in the GCMs to anthropogenic forcings - way beyond the 2100 or even 2300 horizons we are used to seeing? (eg. https://t.co/re1LrM5TWa) https://t.co/sbQMWU53xj
Many of these questions remain open because it's hard to do simulations of the whole deglaciation, also the background climate before the YD is different to today or the pre-industrial (for which most simulations have been made), and we don't know the FW forcing well enough.
3) How do you maintain an 'off state' for multiple centuries? Most models show the circulation comes back relatively quickly if you turn off the fresh water. Maybe the freshwater lasted centuries? Maybe models are too stable?
What Q's remain?	1) A quantified fresh water history through this period. (W/o an independent input function, getting the 'right' model response is hard)	2) It's easy for models to cool at about the right rate, but v. hard to get them to warm abruptly at the end.
The point to make is that it isn't as strongly quantified as listening to paleo-climate talks might sometimes lead you to believe (I'm not implicating anyone specific here). But it is much better supported than anything else.
Whether any of these sources are sufficient either to trigger a collapse, or maintain it for ~1000 years is unclear. Modeling evidence in support of this scenario is 'ambiguous'. But there are lots of uncertainties - so it's certainly not ruled out.
Many claims have been made for a specific freshwater source that could have triggered the initial slowdown of circulation (via the St. Lawrence, The Mississippi or the MacKenzie - for instance https://t.co/q1ZEUFG5AJ) https://t.co/omOlFhFQn1
The poster-child for abrupt change involving AMOC is the multi-century Younger Dryas cooling during the last deglaciation (despite multiple 'alternate' theories that have been suggested over the years). https://t.co/V6biydOSwl
We know too that freshwater inputs from Greenland (and in the past, other NH ice sheets or paleo-lake collapses) can cause relatively abrupt shutdowns in the circulation. A (partial) collapse 8200 yr ago is the most recent example https://t.co/otv1RjQcfI
It's well known that GCMs suggest that over the 21st Century under increasing GHGs, the AMOC decreases - mostly because of ocean surface warming decreasing the density. https://t.co/yquJntKwu3 https://t.co/nhXE4uHao1
There is some discussion of potential current and ongoing changes in AMOC at @RealClimate this week https://t.co/ZRz6c4CsvB from @rahmstorf, but I'm going to talk about something a little different, namely, what is the scope for changes in AMOC over the longer-term?
I see that Twitter is excited today about instability, abrupt changes, come backs, and shut downs.		So, time for a mini-thread on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), predictability and perhaps the Younger Dryas cold reversal?

@BuildSoil yes. I should have distinguished. This is Peter L. Ward, 	https://t.co/kkRDIhiIUy	not Peter D. Ward	https://t.co/mu4SyVxN0d
Finally, it seems inevitable that someone blames volcanoes for all environmental changes whenever a new eruption (of whatever relevance) occurs. This "Volcano Gambit" has been used for decades: 	https://t.co/fdoZESDlPT	Please help make it stop! https://t.co/fbuM8vPHUd
Claims by Peter Ward to the contrary are totally bogus and w/o foundation. Journalists, please, please, please, ask someone competent and independent before you do a whole story based on someone's crackpot idea!
To summarise: 	- Neither Kilauea nor Bardarbunga are/were emitting any SO2 or HCl into the stratosphere	- There are no CFCs involved at all	- Neither had any impact on stratospheric ozone	- Even if they had, the resulting ozone depletion would cause a slight *cooling*!
One more little fact ere we go back to @NBCNewsMACH. Ozone depletion does affect surface temperature - but it actually causes a *cooling* because the greenhouse effect of stratospheric ozone is more important than the change in UV.  [Net effect is little blue bar on 3rd row] https://t.co/b0Y8qOWPYO
But the long term trends are due to increases in CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) which are much more stable and almost all anthropogenic (notably, CFC-11, CFC-12 etc.) https://t.co/6cwatDwwbl
Now, Cl in the stratosphere does mean that volcanic injections of SO2 can cause spikes of ozone depletion https://t.co/JBI0PQOs12 https://t.co/zH4BLwSLrJ
It's also true that there is quite a lot of Chlorine (Cl) in volcanic plumes - mostly in the form of HCl. Back in the day this source of Cl was (incorrectly) posited as a reason for naturally high Cl levels in the stratosphere explaining ozone depletion. [Narrator. No, It was us]
The key is whether enough SO2 gets into the stratosphere where it doesn't wash out very quickly. The impacts of non-explosive non-tropical volcanos (Laki, Bardarbunga, Kilauea) are much more localized and may not have a detectable climate signal at all. [Laki was a big deal tho]
Volcanos impact climate for sure. On short time scales (as mentioned in the video), eruptions like Mt Pinatubo (1991) or Krakatau (1883) can eject so much SO2 into the stratosphere that the resulting (reflective) sulphate particles cool the planet for a few years https://t.co/f7FHcxMp3G

@DrJBaxter @shubclimate @mattwridley Not what I'm saying. I don't think there is much evidence for ECS being a very sensitive function of climate state (within Holocene bounds say), though it might not be symmetrical (w.r.t cooling or warming). The spatial patterns I mentioned are biases, not 'noise'.
@DrJBaxter @shubclimate @mattwridley No. Length helps you get past issues related to internal variability, but doesn't help with spatial pattern differences (either because of regionally specific forcings or asymmetries in ocean heat uptake).
@DrJBaxter @shubclimate @mattwridley The most basic is that this formulation assumes that the drivers+response in the past were like they will be in the future. There is lots of evidence against that which you (and L&amp;C) do not include.

@DrJBaxter @shubclimate @mattwridley That is laced with assumptions that you (and L&amp;C) don‚Äôt even know you are making.
@DrJBaxter @shubclimate @mattwridley No. L&amp;C just use a much simpler model that also conserves energy by design, but that doesn‚Äôt account for spatial variability, the diff btw short or long wave forcings, the complexity of ocean heat uptake etc
@DrJBaxter @mattwridley It‚Äôs actually much more selective and ad hoc than you might think. But there is a lot of justification for why it‚Äôs likely to be biased in work by @DrKateMarvel and others - issues that L&amp;C simply assume to be zero w/zero uncertainty.
@DrJBaxter @mattwridley Why would you assume such a thing? The argument is that because of the one or all of the above mentioned issues, it might be extremely biased.
@DrJBaxter @shubclimate @mattwridley You overstate their demonstration. All CMIP5 mods conserve energy &amp; clearly do match the historical record with higher ECS than L&amp;C infer. Diffs may be be in the ocean heat content, internal variability, forcing efficacy, spatial pattern of SST, or underestimate of uncertainty.
@DrJBaxter @mattwridley But that‚Äôs not the claim. L&amp;C claim that the CMIP5 range of ECS is inconsistent with the historical change. That is clearly not true. I agree that it doesn‚Äôt provide a strong constraint on the real world ECS.
@DrJBaxter @shubclimate @mattwridley Actually - while that isn‚Äôt what has happened- you‚Äôve almost put your finger on exactly the right issue. I.e. The 20th C change is not perfectly determinative of the long term change at 2xCO2. Which is the exact point everyone has made in response to L&amp;C
@DrJBaxter @shubclimate @mattwridley You are beyond help. Sorry.

@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 We aren't going around and around, we are actually making progress. üôÇ		I think you now accept that the rise is indeed man-made. But now let's get to your second point - that this isn't a problem.
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 only burning of fossil fuels fits the data.
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 actually there is plenty of proof we are the only contributor:	1) 13C changes =&gt; biogenic	2) 14C changes =&gt; old	3) O2 decreases =&gt; it must have been burnt	4) all carbon pools are increasing carbon (ocean+biosphere).	5) Plus, we have emitted ~2x more than is still in the air.
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 No-one disputes it was higher in the past (note also it was much warmer &amp; sea level was much higher).		But if you accept the recent rise is man-made &amp; you accept the CO2 history I showed you, simple arithmetic tells us that ~31% of current CO2 concentration is man-made, yes?
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 (You'd be surprised).		But you accept that CO2 has risen. And the fact that it's coincident with us putting a cumulative half a trillion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere should lead you to conclude that the rise is man-made, yes?
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 We are making progress! Given that you accept the data on CO2 concentrations I showed, do you dispute the arithmetic that I gave showing CO2 has risen ~45% since 1800AD?
If you are misquoted, you should indeed try and set the record straight. But if you find yourself doing it a lot, you might want to think about what it is you are actually saying and why everyone seems to have such trouble with it. Hence @xkcd
i.e. the communication goal is not to improve understanding of a specific point of science, but rather to position themselves as the person who says difficult things and is victimized because of it.		This is communication as performance art and should be judged accordingly.
But we often see ppl repeating their claim to have been misquoted for basically the same issue time after time after time. 	At some point, you conclude that they don't actually mind and both their original statements &amp; their complaints are part of what they want to communicate.
We can mostly dismiss #1 for the most persistent cases. So we are left w/#2. 		Assuming misinterpretations keep happening, it is predictable that similar statements made in future will engender the same confusion. So disavowing the consequences of statements becomes harder.
Two reasons spring to mind. 	1) They're terrible communicators &amp; continually fail to get the point they want across. 	2) They're good communicators but they keep saying things that feed an existing narrative that they (nominally) don't agree with but keep getting swept up in.
Misinterpretation is funny. 		I occasionally get misquoted (2 or 3 times over many years), but some other science commentators seem to be continually complaining that they are misquoted (&amp; indeed they often are). It's worth thinking about why. https://t.co/qhGrIkIZrf
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 I love your confidence. 		But really, what don't you agree with in the plot of atmospheric CO2 concentration I showed? Steady for thousands of years, then a big jump post-1800.
This!	"Misinterpretation"  https://t.co/PVY1ZnIcS0
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 Because for millennia before industrialization there was a balance of natural sources and natural sinks of CO2. Since then the massive exploitation of fossil fuels has upset that balance.
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 please answer the previous question - and if we get past that, maybe the answer to yours will become clear...
@chipchipgogo @chuck2143 @Jaketech201 @HughEHamilton @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 So let's break it down. What do you not accept about the recent changes in CO2 concentration? It was around 280ppm for millennia, and since ~1800 has increased to ~405ppm.	https://t.co/d8vbZKywBC

@cityatlas @DoctorVive @mtobis @coralsncaves @ClimateHuman @EthonRaptor @past_is_future @theresphysics @mammuthus @AndrewDessler @ekvraga Sure. But individuals can't make lifestyle choices that directly impact the national infrastructure emissions. Indirectly, they can though - by helping inform/shape policy/developing tech/sending signals to utilities etc.
@DoctorVive @mtobis @coralsncaves @ClimateHuman @EthonRaptor @past_is_future @theresphysics @mammuthus @AndrewDessler @ekvraga Yes - that distributes national emissions in proportion to national income distribution and so doesn't address the impact of actual lifestyle choices.

@JohnFBruno @ed_hawkins @KHayhoe @simondonner What is your grid?
Losses are not simply the value of infrastructure submerged or swept away. They include the lives, the stories, different ways of thinking of the people displaced. That uncosted externality may be the most expensive of them all.
Most important perhaps is that it underlines that impacts are non-linear. A small shift when nothing else is happening can be dealt with, but the same shift when systems are already stressed can be fatal.
Lots of lessons here for the bigger issues: 	- uncosted externalities will come back to screw you over	- once you start geoengineering, you can‚Äôt go back	- Econ arguments about the sunk cost fallacy aren‚Äôt persuasive to people on the ground.
But it‚Äôs the stories of the folk affected that are the heart of the issues. Things are happening that they can‚Äôt control (and it‚Äôs not clear if anyone can).
So many things going on here: the Mississippi levees reducing sedimentation in wetlands, natural subsidence, dredging for oil&amp;gas drilling, and, yes, sea level rise.

@rjtklein Not aimed specifically at you at all. It is a generic ""you" like "one" (but less formal).
@rjtklein You were not the target of the initial &lt;rant&gt;.
@rjtklein @mammuthus Ok - finally, this is indeed what I said. Since you think that the goal of reducing emissions is indeed good policy, perhaps you would like to chime in on where the blame lies?
@rjtklein It was not a complaint per se against the lack of political action, but rather a complaint about ppl blaming climate scientists specifically for that lack of action.
@rjtklein Sorry, but since it isn't even close to what I was complaining about, it is your jumping to conclusions that is 'lazy'. Yr second claim is, again, not related to anything I've ever said.
@rjtklein If you think that CS's actions (alone) are what causes (or doesn't cause) actions, that is precisely the linear model. It's precisely that I am criticizing! And when have I ever criticized working with others to deal with the complexity?
@rjtklein How can you think this is what I was arguing? #strawman
@rjtklein Ok - that's not a sufficient response. Let me try again:	1) the notion that I'm criticizing (that climate scientists are to blame for the lack of progress (because RCP85, or whatever)) is implicitly based on the 'linear model'. 	2) I am well aware that policy making is complex.
@rjtklein Don't be ridiculous.
@RogerPielkeJr @DeepShort7 @EthonRaptor I don't disagree with either. Tho technically it's FF emissions that need to go to zero, not use (depending on whether CCS ever gets implemented at scale). But focus on carbon-free sources hides the reduction in emissions from lower carbon sources that impact eventual temperature
@ScarsellaMatt That is actually a (small) term in the budget! Total water in the atmosphere is about 25 mm (equivalent SLR), and that increases ~7% per degree of global warming. So for 1¬∫C so far, the decrease is &lt; 2mm over 100 years or so. Not enough to reduce the rise appreciably.
@RogerPielkeJr @DeepShort7 @EthonRaptor Thanks for the clarification. The second point stands.
@DodwellHenry You miss the fact that we can attribute the changes very well now. The terms that are causing the acceleration (ice sheets mainly) are not going away.
@Chris45215 The website https://t.co/lHLIwpDj7B tries to do this, as does GISS directly, the Colorado sea level group, NOAA (including the BAMS SOTC issue) etc. If you have a metric that you think should be kept up in real time that isn't there, let them know!

The timing of aerosol changes in the RCPs is basically the same, so different 3¬∫C points correspond to different mixes of aerosol and CO2 forcings, and so hydrological diags like eval &amp; precip show different sensitivities to temperature-related ones.
@DeepShort7 @EthonRaptor Confuses primary energy with usable energy (i.e. lots of heat loss in fossil fuel burning). Ignores transitions that lower carbon emissions (i.e. natural gas replacing coal) that reduce long term temperature rises etc.

No. If only the worst case scenario had only gone up to 7.5W/m2. That would have made all the difference in the world. Bad, climate scientists, bad!
And finally, none of this can possibly be because it‚Äôs hard to change pathways of economic development consciously in a better direction. That there are confounding clashes of values in uncertain times that can get swamped by the acute demands of everyday life.
Vested interests can‚Äôt stop funding disinformation campaigns or buying compliant political classes - it‚Äôs just in their corporate DNA. No, it must be the climate scientists fault.
Because of course, scientists are the only folks with agency in this whole business. Politicians don‚Äôt have free will. Commentators can‚Äôt help but take contrarian stands that boost their self-esteem at the cost of public understanding.	[narrator: umm...]
If only scientists had been better communicators! If only scientists never flew anywhere to communicate things!
If only scientists hadn‚Äôt talked about uncertainty; if only scientists had talked more about uncertainty!
If only climate scientists hadn‚Äôt developed and used plausible worst case scenarios to bracket what could happen!	[narrator: that wasn‚Äôt it either]
If only IPCC had defined climate change the same exact way as the UNFCCC - that would have made all the difference! 	[narrator: not]
We should dedicate February as #findaclimatescapegoat month as yet again some political scientists try to find ways to blame climate scientists for the lack of progress in CO2 emission reductions, instead of, say, politics.

Journalists who get offended that scientists don‚Äôt automatically trust that they will get the quote right, could be a little more understanding. Empathy (on both sides) goes a long way towards building good long term relationships.
It‚Äôs understandable for scientists to want to ask to check what they are quoted as saying. Especially if they aren‚Äôt sure that the journalist has actually understood their point. But trying to make sure they really understood is a better way to ensure that you aren‚Äôt misquoted.

The point being that the net impact of anthropogenic aerosols (about 0.5¬∫C cooling) hides a lot of complexity and will not suddenly disappear and make global warming much worse.
Sulphates have already falling dramatically since the 1990s. Technology exists to push this even lower. Nitrates are growing and will be dominant human-related aerosol by end of the century. Reductions in transport NOx are possible, agricultural emissions harder.
On the contrary, judicious focus on specific emissions and activities can decouple the CO2/aerosol connection: Focus on 	- black carbon to reduce warming and improve air quality	- reduction in low temperature inefficient coal burning (mostly for residential &amp; mostly in Asia)
important conclusion: while aerosols are linked to many of the activities related to CO2 emissions (coal burning, deforestation), there is not a one-to-one correspondence. You cannot assume that net zero CO2 emissions must also imply zero anthropogenic aerosol emissions.
Third, what activities are involved?	- fossil fuels (sulphates, nitrates, black carbon)	- agriculture (nitrates)	- biomass burning (black carbon, other carbonaceous)	- other industry	- indirect effects (CH4 reduces sulphates/nitrates, rainfall impacts dust, winds change sea salt)
Second, where do they come from?	- direct emissions of particles 	- emissions of precursor gases	- changes in emissions or production because of other human changes (like the ozone hole/climate change/atmos chemistry)
First, what do they do? 	- some reflect+scatter sunlight (cooling effect) ‚òÄÔ∏è --&gt; üå§Ô∏è	- some absorb sunlight (warming effect) üòé	- some interact with clouds (cooling effect) üå§Ô∏è --&gt; ‚õÖÔ∏è	- some interact with snow alebdo ‚ùÑÔ∏è

@cliffmasst @johnupton @CliffMass No. There is also an anthropogenic component before 1995. The attribution work to close the SLR budget shows clearly that steric changes (OHC) go back longer, and the Greenland component is very clearly accelerating (Chen et al 2017). https://t.co/XwU6vRoISg
@jdavich Hi, just a minor correction to your piece. NASA has not made any announcement for the 2017 temperatures as yet (it'll come on Jan 18). For the Jan-Nov value (and for the Dec-Nov meteorological year), 2017 was the second warmest in our record.
@cliffmasst @johnupton @CliffMass You are simply not correct. The very long term global rate of SLR is ~1. to 1.5 mm/yr. Current rates - whether assessed from tide gauges or satellites - are over 3 mm/yr (and rising) *and* attributable to components associated with a warming planet (Greenland, W. Ant., OHC etc).

@curryja Well of course not. LC14 assumes the attribution result before you start.
@curryja This has been singularly lacking. Results from complex coupled GCMs don‚Äôt show this (control runs don‚Äôt have 20th C-scale excursions in TOA balance), so you need to show that the variability you posit is both missing *and* has a large global-mean TOA fingerprint.
@curryja If you want to show that multi-decadal internal variability is important for attribution in an EB framework, you have to show that the patterns of variability you posit have a big impact on the TOA energy balance (ie they don‚Äôt essentially cancel in the global mean).

@curryja Though oddly, when presented with these results from multiple authors, you and your co-author haven‚Äôt adjusted your simple EBM approach at all. That doesn‚Äôt much matter (others will do so for you), but it does seem to complicate the argument you are making now.
@curryja You have it backwards. All the other perspectives inform &amp; impact how simpler levels are used. For instance, understanding that different forcings have different efficacies at influencing global temperature is a result from complex models that should adjust simpler EBM analyses.

@PlancksLaw @Sci_or_Fic @curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre Aha! A testable hypothesis! If true, the simulations that started a millennium earlier should show something very different in the 20th Century. Do they or do they not?

@curryja @Sci_or_Fic @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre I *literally* wrote the paper on this. Previous poster was referring to trends, not observations more generally. 	https://t.co/EgDY8Cvogm
@Sci_or_Fic @curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre 1) models are not fitted to observations in the sense you imply: https://t.co/Yh2NwAdk03	2) RCP scenarios define forcings, not outcomes.	3) Assessment against relevant observed features.
@rgrumbine IMO very little. Push back even on technical issues leads to entrenchment + increased external support from outside players which validates and reinforces original stance. Once ppl stop listening to colleagues, their trajectory is set.
@Sci_or_Fic @curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre Not sure what you are responding to, but attribution studies are based on historical period simulations, not the RCPs.

@el_nino_waves @SciSpen @curryja @CColose @shubclimate @SCStreet @SarahEMyhre You should read the RC post. Models control runs do exhibit LTP at local scale v. simillarly to obs. Determining LTP from obs assuming no forcing can be done, but produces vastly greater variability in the past than observed.
There is something seriously messed up with current UK policy. https://t.co/qujtoYGxc6
@SturmLLiouville @SciSpen @ericsteig @curryja @CColose @shubclimate @SCStreet @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre Indeed. 30 years ago was 1987. I am unaware of any mainstream ‚Äòcooling‚Äô or even static prediction from around that time.
@curryja @CColose @shubclimate @SCStreet @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre I'm certainly not getting your attempt to allege it. No-one is 'excluding' internal variability - that's a silly strawman argument. But pray tell what internal mode of variability has a multiple decades of +ve global radiative balance &amp; looks exactly like the forced GHG signal?
@curryja @CColose @shubclimate @SCStreet @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre How is this relevant to attribution over the 20th C? OHC is definitely increasing since ~1960 (globally and in the Pacific), counter to any natural long term trend (influenced by volcanoes, orbital forcing etc.).
@curryja @SCStreet @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre Nope. These were all independent simulations - it is a *result* that runs w/all forcings (or the sum of the single forcing runs) add up to the pretty much the observed trend.		Curiously, the constraints on ECS in Lewis &amp; Curry 14 do assume the changes are all forced. ü§î
@curryja @SCStreet @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre What a strange statement. Of course it isn't just an uncertainty on the mean. But on a plot of global mean temperature responses, how do you propose visualizing those multi-dimensional effects? An uncertainty band in the quantity your are plotting is a pretty standard approach.
@curryja @SCStreet @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre Why would you say something so incorrect? The assessment of internal variability is embedded in the uncertainty bands around the mean forced signals. You could perhaps question its magnitude and derivation, but not its existence.
Hard to overturn past ruling, but what an outspoken woman might do:	overturn present day (inclusively) (channeling Anais?). Starts with arrest! (12,7) #crypticclimateclue
@kaleekreider @curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre True. But it has less salience than it used to.
@curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre If my review was just ‚Äòcircular reasoning!‚Äô without further details I wouldn‚Äôt expect the editor to give it much weight.
@curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre A lot of people have also seen &gt; 3 years of evasion on this topic. Of course, your time is your own to use as you see fit. But you can't legitimately complain when people don't take you seriously if you fail to deal seriously with the topic.
@Balinteractive @curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre Please show me where decadal or multi-decadal variability in the real world (black lines) is outside the bounds of the model ensemble (colors) (AR5 WG1 fig 9.33) https://t.co/CtoNpppNYJ
@curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre Umm... no. If you want to be taken seriously (and I assume you do), you have to do more work than just saying everyone else is wrong. You have made specific quantitative claims about attribution w/o any analysis. Why would anyone take them seriously?
@LizNeeley It came up in the context of climate stories as well back in 2010.... https://t.co/5WTZxPpHAg
@curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre This is just hand-waving. Where is the quantification of the specific nat var that you claim is missing? Where is the analysis that shows this would make a difference to any attribution? Why do you think a claim of impossibility is credible w/o evidence? (I have)
A corollary: The further away from the technical details and/or personalities involved, the more a call for greater integrity will be taken at face value.
Thus the risk to this advocacy is dependent, not only on the specifics, but the implied context. The extent to which accusations of misconduct/corruption are credible (to any particular audience) will determine how welcomed a call for integrity will be.
But often, a specific call for scientific integrity (a widely shared value) is accompanied by explicit or implicit statements about the lack of integrity or corruption of others (more problematic). Regardless of the merits, the risk profile starts to look something like this: https://t.co/wqSAnyR54C
It's instructive to think about the risks involved in the advocacy of scientific integrity. This is a very widely shared value, and so according to our framing, should be relatively low risk. i.e. the RAVE profile should look like this: https://t.co/4ZJRHtTIEK
As an aside to tweet storms going on about being public scientists and criticism of that role, @simondonner and I wrote a paper on Risk, Advocacy and Values in Engagment (RAVE):	https://t.co/vjeaHAhgCH
@curryja @el_nino_waves @SarahEMyhre Then where are the quantitative analyses to support your claims? Arguing that everyone else is wrong isn't likely to be persuasive in the field, but may be welcomed outside since it suits certain factions to believe it. Such a reception says zero about the quality of the argument

@LizNeeley You can‚Äôt blame humanity as a whole for the excesses of the Daily Mail.
@jbeilinson @LizNeeley Right, but the net effect is that stories that aren‚Äôt really either sensational or news sometimes get reported as such and ppl notice that and impressions are formed.

@BenLillie @SarahEMyhre Agreed. But are all psychologists mentally stable? All lawyers law-abiding? All priests paragons? ;-)
@BenLillie @SarahEMyhre I don't mean to be glib, but #scicomm is a craft that needs (some) talent, (perhaps) training and (definitely) experience.  	Biggest problem? Mostly people don't get any feedback at all.
@BenLillie @SarahEMyhre Yes. But we shouldn't assume that skill in communication is the same as skill in research. This holds for all fields, so why not the #scicomm field too?
@GeoffBeacon @ITVAlexC Attributable warming (the metric used by Millar et al) depends a little on the dataset. They used HadCRUT4 to 2014. If you use GISTEMP to 2016 it's 1.1¬∫C.
@marksulmer @AndrewDessler @dougmcneall @capitalweather It makes the error of looking at the surface energy budget instead of at the tropopause. Not a good guide to what‚Äôs happening.
@mahiko I can make any version you like...
2017 annual mean prediction updated using Oct data. Probability of ~94% it will be the 2nd warmest yr in the GISTEMP record. https://t.co/Ot7V8wGR5z
@icarus62 @JohnMashey Another example is the Dover 'creation science' case. It rested on whether creation science was derived from a religious tenet, not a decision per se on the validity of evolution.
@icarus62 Interesting point. Perhaps @JohnMashey could jump in, but wasn't the main lever the release of papers acknowledging that they knew the dangers but lied about it?
Roger pretends that reason in (3) is always equal to reason in (2) &amp; that rights to (1) should be given up. Anyone that disagrees (as I do), is therefore supposed to be supportive of (2). This fails on multiple levels.
Some things that shouldn't need saying (but hey #2017):	1) Everyone (even scientists) shld have equal access to the law	2) Using courts to settle science issues is silly	3) Using courts to settle defamation cases is appropriate	4) Wisdom of filing suit is always arguable
@RogerPielkeJr Hey Roger, some equations for you. 	Criticizing your arguments != anti-science	Thinking a lawsuit is unwise or unlikely to succeed != thinking all lawsuits are unwise or unlikely to succeed. 	Thanks!
