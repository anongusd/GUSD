@JohnCornyn That’s just patently unfair. A blatant scare tactic. What about yesterday’s tweet about starting with the facts? Have we abandoned that less than 21 hours later?
@RyanHillMI It’s the dumbest thing. What value does a hardcore partisan add to coverage apart from ratcheting up divisions and tension? It’s always been stupid. Hire journalists.
@brianschatz Sold!!
@AlanDersh Any specific examples to support that? Because it can’t be based on the text!
@LindseyGrahamSC Cuck.
@JohnCornyn We can come together on a bipartisan basis and deal with this public health crisis.

@TheRickWilson He won 18 gold medals at the 2012 olympics. Hater. He’s a better marksman than Kim Jong Un. He’s a legend at everything.
@TRB_1990 @JohnCornyn I’m not going to take a projection accusation from people who are the kings of projection. What do you think your leader lives and breathes off of? Lies and projection. Have a wonderful weekend in fantasy land!
@TheRickWilson Bring it to em!!
@TRB_1990 @JohnCornyn The sad life is being a racist. A xenophobe. And un-American. You make me sick. All of you do.
@TRB_1990 @JohnCornyn I’m not a MAGA idiot full of lies so I think I’m doing fine. I live on earth. Not in some fantasy land. You fucking loser.
@JohnCornyn You’re wrong. But, hey, you’re trying to get out in front of your re-election bid!
@dick_nixon I’d respect you a lot more if you weren’t a felon and total disgrace.
@brianschatz Yeah, but I once saw Rubio and Flake tweet about stuff like it.
@jaredlholt @slpng_giants Oh my god just when you think these fucks can’t get more regressive. And people wonder why progressives complain about victim-blaming.

@AnnCoulter No because there are hateful people like you who remind us that humans have committed genocide. Idiot.

@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @DanCrenshawTX Nope.

@kaitlancollins Sounds like we’re in for a great two years of bipartisanship then!
@MarisaKabas All my feelings. And wine.
@DavidAFrench And so you embrace Trump. You own him, his rhetoric, and all you hate about him. You enable him. Did you take the same nuanced approach when Obama was in the White House? Clinton? Take a look in the mirror. Hypocrite.
@NateSilver538 Could I please poll-splain this election to you then?
@TomiLahren Wait. So you’re just going to shut up then? Great!
@TheRickWilson This is hilarious. Well played.
@costareports This thread has very sharp analysis. 👇
@ShannonBream Fact check: she claimed to have been an anonymous accuser but was not. Big difference. Get it right. This is basic reading comprehension.
@samstein We’ll find out Tuesday. Hopefully that time has passed. Decency in politics feels like drinking cool water in the desert these days.
@DineshDSouza Uh, she wasn’t an accuser. She lied about being an anonymous accuser. Live in facts and not your pathetic fantasy world, felonious dirt bag.
@realDonaldTrump No.

@JohnCornyn You should be ashamed at what a bad senator you are. But you have no shame. Only raw thirst for power.
@NateSilver538 So who used every trick and tactic in the book in this case then?
@JohnCornyn Senator, you do realize Judge Bork was okay with poll taxes and carried out the Saturday Night Massacre, right? He was swatted down - like almost one-third of SCOTUS nominations have been - because he was a terrible choice.
@irin Oh, so he hates facts as much as Trump!
@AnnCoulter Um. Why? You’re so dumb. It kills me. I am literally dead.
@Kokomothegreat And Lindsey Graham will give him a Devil’s Triangle.
@kaitlancollins It’s almost like she doesn’t get it.
@marcorubio Dude, do you KNOW Senate history? It’s all about tribalism. The southern racists held the institution and the nation hostage on civil rights for almost 100 years after the Civil War.
@mitchellreports @ChuckGrassley And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. It will be a great time when this generation has left us. #boomerssuck
@AnnCoulter Gosh, that’s almost like a talk show booking, I dunno, Ann Coulter. There are no standards anymore.
@JenaNotJameson I don’t know if I can properly give you that, but I’ve got a match!
@KimStrassel You must not be familiar with the history of the Senate. Maybe read up on that.
@AnnCoulter Um, you realize that destroying Dr. Ford’s reputation and going on a scorched earth campaign to call this a smear job is a complete lack of civility, right? Er. Maybe not. Because you’re such a hypocrite.
@KimStrassel Isn’t being thorough important?
@KimStrassel How about the text messages and additional perjury? How are you gonna spin that? I’ll wait.
@JohnCornyn You’re right. Let’s just hold him to the Merrick Garland standard and not give him a vote for political reasons. Cool?
@rebeccaballhaus The least surprising thing ever. Has Flake done anything but tweet or speak in opposition of his own party? No.
@shannonrwatts This was the least dramatic thing ever. @JeffFlake is such a reliable Trump vote. He just makes noise. One of the core principles of the Republican Party is blood lust for power. And getting someone like Kavanaugh on the bench to undo the New Deal and women’s rights is a dream.
@kthalps Because no one involved in the Catholic Church has ever committed sexual assault, as far as I’m aware. At least nothing high-profile, right?
@DavidAFrench Because it never became a big national issue until then. It’s not limited to Georgetown Prep. This is a huge issue many places. Let’s air ALL of it.
@JeffFlake A speech during which you will courageously decry people for rushing through Kavanaugh and then announce you will support his nomination.
@realDonaldTrump Better than being a fifth rate president.
@KimStrassel How about also demanding the same level of investigation for the other Kavanaugh accusations, too? No picking and choosing. Put a hold on this and find out the truth as best we can with an independent investigation.
@JuddLegum Right. So in his mind, from the women who matter. He’s a racist, you know.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Porn lawyer? Every allegation Stormy made has panned out, dude.
@DavidCornDC Of course they can. They only care about power and getting Kavanaugh through.
@kaitlancollins “The woman.” What a Renaissance man. Literally. His views on women are like 15th century.
@KimStrassel @emmersbrown Red herring. Come on. Three. Four. Admitted fuzzy memory on some details. But substantial corroborating evidence to show this isn’t just some political game, which is why it merits investigation.
@JonahNRO Any reason for believe that other than just wishful thinking or a hunch? Because there have been a lot of indictments and guilty pleas and little evidence that’s been made public.
@DineshDSouza @jimmykimmel Way to keep it civil, dude!
@KimStrassel @NBCNews Since when do you traffic in facts, @KimStrassel?
@DonaldJTrumpJr You’re not good at politics, so just lay off.
@RadioFreeTom The way to reconcile it is by accepting he’s a liar. Puts all the pieces together.
@DavidAFrench Or he’s just lying. He did it before the Senate under oath and got away with it, so why not keep riding the horse that brung ya?
@jameshohmann Guy can’t stop lying.
@sahilkapur @SenateMajLdr Spare me your outrage, Senator. Your sense of fairness only moves one direction. That’s not okay.
@JohnCornyn Yeah, well, if he did it, it doesn’t matter the age. What about rule of law?
@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Yeah. And so should his accusers be treated fairly. Fairness for everyone. I know that’s a challenging concept for you.
@KimStrassel Gosh, where was that passion for fairness 2 years ago?
@WalshFreedom Remove “male,” and this tweet applies to the conservative philosophy on any nominee. Or candidate.
@KimStrassel If only you didn’t choose who to believe based on ideological identification.
Friendly reminder that Robert Mueller is still hard at work.
@brithume Being at Fox, you know this tactic well.
@JonahNRO That’s rich. Come on. Conservatives getting a dose of their own medicine and not liking it? Gee, who could have seen such a hypocritical reaction coming. As if it isn’t a core feature of the contemporary Republican Party. Family values! #Hypocrite
@JohnCornyn Oh? As if you had any other play in your playbook, Senator? Did Justice Garland prefer coffee or tea? You’re a hypocrite. #Hypocrite
@DineshDSouza @ChuckGrassley Yes. You’ve been such gentleman. Do you long for the good old days of the genteel South, too? Oh wait. Don’t answer that. It’s very well documented.
@mattyglesias That would require a man to own up and apologize. Seems a commodity more rare than, I dunno, general integrity in politics and all that.
@JamesFallows And Dan Burton was a House impeachment manager while busy playing grab-ass in the elevators with any available female.
@mitchellvii @MichaelAvenatti Yes. Donald Trump. Duh.
@speechboy71 Because he’s as power hungry as the people who will keep ramming him through?
@AnnCoulter Yes, Republicans are just so genteel.
@KimStrassel Question for conservatives: your thirst for power is really this strong and without principle?
@KimStrassel If that’s the side you want to be on.
@AnnCoulter Huh, reading your own stuff and commenting on it?
@peterbakernyt Yeah, because when I was out boozing in high school I made sure to have a written record of all the parties. Suspicious as all get out.
@JenaNotJameson Everybody gets a free rape-sprunga in high school right?
And Papa John’s wants to celebrate by giving all white fans a free pizza! Or something. #racistpizza https://t.co/EFmhoylGpC
@AriFleischer Yes. The republican senators aren’t politically calculating. Ari, how would you have reacted if that’s how someone wanted to handle the Miers confirmation? You’re a hypocrite.
@JonahNRO Ted is scared. And also a bad candidate. That’s it.
@DavidAFrench But he was African-American! The cops can do anything then! Fuck. What a savage @tedcruz is. Pandering loser.
@peterdaou @CNN This is sick. No one should do this. Regardless the age.
@realDonaldTrump Please name the records. Each of them with particularity.
@KimStrassel Your selective choice of which 36-year-old memories to believe is striking. It’s almost like you’ve got a dog in this fight. What’s your case for NOT having a full public hearing?
@JenaNotJameson Yeah, but the boyz had such a long week of oppressing! They gotta get home to being dick husbands and online mansplaining!!
@KimStrassel You are such a hack.
@realDonaldTrump Slut-shaming is unbecoming if anyone, much less the President of the United States. The floor keeps dropping.
@RVAwonk Yes.
@JohnnyBlkshrt 🤢
@EdWhelanEPPC Pretty pathetic. Your desire for power and control brought you to not think twice about defaming someone. You should seriously take time for self-reflection.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Conspiracy theories are the domain of people who can’t support their positions with facts and reason. This is such a weak take. #failed

@joshtpm From Dimon’s comments yesterday. Nothing is beneath Trump. No fight is too petty. He is the perfect internet user.
@realDonaldTrump He’s like a mouse if you put out a piece of cheese. He just can’t resist the bait. This, perhaps more than anything, backs up the Woodward account of the Dowd/Mueller conversation. Trump is his own worst enemy and is clueless to that fact.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You’re a loser. #loser

@SterlingCBeard @jimgeraghty I’m not sure it’s a mess, but there is a lack of analysis or thought that goes into it. There’s a complete failure to make connections. Just because something occurs in the investigation doesn’t make it Trump-related even! But our bite-sized news demands far-reaching conclusions.
@williamlegate It’s true. It really seems like it.
@SterlingCBeard @jimgeraghty That’s disingenuous. These are charges directly related to Mueller’s assignment, which contemplated that unrelated crimes might be found. This is unrelated. But it still doesn’t look good, having a criminal run your campaign.
@KFILE Never. Because it’s a bit of normalcy in politics. And so many in the press and so many among their readers crave that well-worn territory. Even if it is completely stupid.

@speechboy71 Yeah but if he did come back? The evangelicals would brand him a criminal too.
@realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch @TomFitton Please provide specific evidence and examples that DOJ and the FBI abused the FISA process in that document. Your bare conclusions are meaningless and not believable. #FactsMatter #factsoverfeelings
@FoxNews Good! Call out the bastards! There is nothing wrong with counter-speech. Buck up, snowflakes.
@TomPaine1737 @wesley_jordan That doesn’t address the reason to ban assault weapons. You can make a compelling argument handguns should be, too. In fact, for 200 years, SCOTUS treated the Second Amendment as a collective right, not an individual one. But you asked re assault weapons. Strong case for regs.
@JordanSchachtel “Probable cause” doesn’t mean there need to ever be charges. There just needs to be ... probable cause to investigate. #hack #partisanhack #FactsMatter
@TomPaine1737 @wesley_jordan The Constitution contemplates regulation of firearms. Assault style weapons can and have caused numerous deaths. It is reasonable to regulate them because we have no obligation to allow those who choose to commit these acts to be so efficient in doing their damage.
@PatrickW It has ALWAYS been the ends justify the means for this Republican Party. It’s a hallmark of the evangelical movement because they believe in the morality of their cause. And it’s infected the whole system.

@boobsforgold Your skill at projection is almost as stubborn as Trump’s. You speculate that it’s possible the forensic imaging could have been faked. But Comey’s testimony you cite does not raise that concern. You speculate and speculate. I go with what we know. What’s fact. Try next time.

@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ The company is immaterial. You would go nuts if they just turned info about you over without a subpoena. As you should. The proof of the hack need be nothing more than the release of the materials. Your theory the DNC did this themselves is beyond reason.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ That’s not how those things work. Would you want Verizon to hand over records of your communications voluntarily? Of course not. You’d be up in arms. But that’s why subpoenas exist and why companies have that policy. It’s not nefarious.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ You know what, I just realized I was mistaken that the whole committee read it. That’s right. They do not. There was an agreement not to. Regardless, my analysis stands. It’s not dependent upon reading a conspiracy theory into the FISA warrant or anything else.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ 🙄
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ Not technically. They don’t. And companies generally make that policy, so I just don’t see how the voluntary refusal somehow leads to the conclusion that they actually hacked themselves. It’s an absurd assertion.

@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ I admit you’re mildly better than most Trump supporters. But your position is not well-reasoned, nor supported by much factual evidence. You use a factual hook to then run with a litany of wild conspiracy theories. Not compelling in the least. Let’s just wait for Mueller.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ Gowdy is one individual on the committee. Is he your direct source? Others on the committee disagree and have provided more compelling evidence.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ You think a fact is anything that supports your position. But your position is unsupportable under the facts.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ “Usually”? 😂😂😂
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ I’d be glad to challenge any and all. Because the FBI made clear that they relied on more than the dossier. And FISA rules require multiple sources. So you’re going with yet another speculative conspiracy theory that the FISA was unlawfully obtained.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ Of course they didn’t. Voluntarily complying and doing so under subpoena is a frequent strategic choice for entities. Verizon, for example, won’t turn over phone records of any kind voluntarily - for the FBI or anyone else.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ So you go with the opinion of someone who supports you and claim that’s fact?
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ A direct source who read the FISA warrant ... sure. Don’t believe you because there’s no reason to. You provide no basis for that.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ There are a litany of reasons you don’t turn over materials without a subpoena when you’re a third party. Corporations do this all the time and, indeed, maintain policies of requiring a subpoena to do so.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ Those are not facts. Those are speculative hypotheses.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ So you have a vague source who said be read the warrant. The consensus position is taken from people who, like Gowdy, saw it.
@mikedebonis @JohnCornyn What a disgrace of a Senator. Don’t recall him being so adoring of the office when someone he didn’t agree with held it.
RT @SallyQYates: Our President today not only chose a tyrant over his own Intel community, he chose Russia’s interests over the country he…
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ To your pinned tweet, they asked and if refused still retained subpoena power. Didn’t use it. Can only presume they didn’t need it. That’s the reasonable conclusion.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ I didn’t read it. You didn’t read it. So we extrapolate conclusions based upon those who have. You cite one person’s reading of it. I synthesize the consensus position. Mine is more reasoned and more reliable than yours. You desire only to feed your own preconceptions.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ And so did others, and the narrative does not support your selective use of Gowdy’s quote. 		https://t.co/m88pU5qNae
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ False. 		https://t.co/Kr8UCs1rD6
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ So you’re going solely on the words on Trey Gowdy?
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ You’ve said like two facts in both our exchanges. I recommend you familiarize with the definition and also come to the understanding that just because you think something or feel something doesn’t make it a fact, no matter how strongly you believe it or want it to be true.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ If the investigators needed them, they have the subpoena power. So if they wanted them, they would get them.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ But at least you’re admitting the GOP funded it, too. So that undermines your theory. And you have no proof that FISA warrants came exclusively based on the dossier. Because they weren’t, and that’s public record. #unthinking #uncritical #FactsMatter #factsoverfeelings
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ Live outside your own echo chamber.
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ So you won’t argue unless your nutjob conspiracy theory gets played out first? That’s absurd. Learn to live in reality. Until then, piss off. #trolls #bot
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ You do understand the fact that GOP contenders initially started the Fusion GPS, right?
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ *they are called facts #grammarpolice
@boobsforgold @paulsperry_ Tell me, what are you hypothesizing such an analysis would prove? That the DNC was behind it all? That all the copious evidence used in these dozens of indictments is a DNC fabrication?

@TYsoVM @SabrinaCath @Marymakestoast Guess we’ll wait to see on thsat, but given Mueller has taken over the Russia investigation, it seems to be somewhat a moot point given that Mueller has found a range of wrongdoing. Good point on awaiting that additional concision.
@teamfrazzled @JenaNotJameson I welcome your supporting facts and evidence of that tightly packed set of accusations, @teamfrazzled!
@smokeiris @SugarSugar931 How are they going after Trump for nothing? That genuinely confuses me. There have been multiple guilty pleas.
@Snobcockery1 @thegoodbuygirl @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast @brithume I welcome supporting evidence for all those accusations against unnamed federal employees.
@RustyBradley74 @DonalJMurphy @gblockheads @Marymakestoast I don’t see a man worthy of trust. I see the facts and evidence from many sources. You prefer to state unsupported conclusions.
@smokeiris @SugarSugar931 Not the agent. The agents. A whole team. With supervisors. The processes and safeguards in investigations exist, in part, to minimize bias or the influence one person’s impact. I just don’t by the premise of a vast FBI conspiracy because the facts and evidence don’t show it.
@SabrinaCath @drou_bre Possibly. It depends on whether he could separate that view from the obligations of a juror to reach a verdict based on the evidence. For example, a juror not believing in the death penalty only disqualifieshimself if he refused to consider applying it if the law allows.
@Gerasim06091877 Stay a while and read. You’ll find I’m very reasonable and rational. Fill your head with facts and evidence that lead to informed opinions!
@SabrinaCath @Marymakestoast Fair point. But perhaps also a semantic one. Key issue is whether investigation was tainted.
@LaurieC710 @Carolde This makes no sense. Do you have any evidence that Mueller knew of the bias and did nothing? If not, your key premise fails.
@SabrinaCath @Marymakestoast Personally, foreign interference with an election seems much more serious than misuse of classified information. But, hey, reasonable minds can disagree.
@SabrinaCath @Marymakestoast But the conclusion of Strzok’s motive here is purely by the journalist. Also, perfectly reasonable of an investigator to make a classification of importance of two investigations. We can disagree with how he did so, and he got investigated for it. No wrongdoing.
@FrankLChilds @SugarSugar931 @thegoodbuygirl @Marymakestoast @brithume This is a very strong counter to the “we” text.
@SabrinaCath @Marymakestoast I honesty read almost the entire report. It’s very thorough. I’m not seeing how, in particular, that third image applies to Strzok because I thought that one was more of a McCabe issue? I appreciate you coming to the discussion with such thoughtful points, though we may disagree!
@IcyTekla @thegoodbuygirl @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast @brithume Taking the under on 50,000.
@IcyTekla A vey fair point. He seemed not to like Trump at all. And had negative things to say about other candidates. You’re right about what the core question is.
@TYsoVM @SabrinaCath @Marymakestoast How does that affect the analysis here?
@Areyouasaved1 I mean, in all seriousness, how do I obtain this enlightenment? Because up until now, I just use facts, evidence, reasoning, and analysis. #FactsMatter
@RustyBradley74 @DonalJMurphy @gblockheads @Marymakestoast Wearily, I renew my call that you provide any facts and evidence to support the conclusion you have asserted. The IG report is full of facts, evidence, and analysis. Your statement is naked conclusion. Without support, a conclusion is baseless opinion that’s easy to ignore.
@OliverParks18 It’s almost as if they’re grandstanding.
@SabrinaCath @Marymakestoast You conveniently leave out the IG’s conclusion.
@dantoujours @SugarSugar931 @thegoodbuygirl @Marymakestoast Excellent point on the selective record the House panel has used. He didn’t like a lot of people. Kind of like lots of people are turned off by politicians.
@runajam1 @RicBlythe @thegoodbuygirl @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast Gowdy’s opening doesn’t stand up to scrutiny of the facts and record. He makes a lot of conclusory statements and doesn’t back them up. He lacks the link. Anyway, I was really hoping you had Rick Roll’d me.
@desertveteran @AndreaGuibord @thegoodbuygirl @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast But the IG found none of that so there we are.
@clifgregoryod @brithume I would expect many (all?) people to have an opinion of and conversations about someone running for president. It would be less expected and possibly more alarming in this context if it was just some run-of-the-mill citizen. Hence why it’s apples to oranges.
@DeplorableDrew Wait, please provide facts and evidence to support the assertion that Mueller and Rosenstine have the appearance of impropriety.
@clifgregoryod @Marymakestoast Gracious, do I have to make the public/private distinction again?! Or can I simply refer to the other iterations of it within this thread?
@JodiGiddings Um, he’s still an FBI agent. Facts, please.
@smokeiris @SugarSugar931 Also, Flynn pleaded guilty!
@smokeiris @SugarSugar931 He had no say in the Flynn prosecution. Charging decisions aren’t made by agents. And kid glove treatment? Absurd on its face. Has anyone faced more enduring public scrutiny than Hillary? Debatable.
@marccarpenter3 @JenaNotJameson @sunnydays878 You are affording Agent Strzok way more power than he had. Let’s get some facts straight. He didn’t make the charging decision. He isn’t a position to put someone under oath.
@GoldenGirl4and6 My apologies for wanting facts and evidence! You have your opinions.  I don’t think they rule every decision you make. I bet you can try to be objective sometimes.
@RicBlythe @runajam1 @thegoodbuygirl @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast Also a possibility! But, to date, the evidence doesn’t support that inference.
@jimaggie93 hey! I’m not a bot! A real person responding. I take offense to the term “libtard” but not to your adding me to a list of people you likely won’t agree with.
@RicBlythe @thegoodbuygirl @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast Those are good questions, which is why the IG conducted such a thorough review here.
@Swizznuts @bulliegirl1959 Fair point. Maybe there is reason to distrust him. Hence the larger investigation and finding of no bias. And “we” to refer to the electorate? Very common. We the people and all ...
@Sunidaze I offer myself as a counter-example, so that destroys your assertion. Let’s try another one.
@smokeiris @SugarSugar931 The texts show strong opinions that definitely could give rise to the appearance of bias. Hence the investigation and the IG report. The texts raise concern but are not dispositive of bias. It came out, he was pulled off the investigation, thorough review concluded no bias.

@smokeiris Not at all. I’m open to hearing any evidence and facts regarding those interviews that you would like to offer.
@AndreaGuibord @thegoodbuygirl @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast The important distinction is between having the opinion and then actually acting upon it.
@slashsnake1 @7SunnyView @boobsforgold @Nuhaserrac @Marymakestoast @Idaho_HUB Recall that, while in the House, GHW Bush voted against the Civil Rights Act. A strong reminder of just how close in time we are to that period of shameful history.
@nsewanswers @awej3 The IG report or the Steele Dossier? And you know Steele’s research began because other Republican candidates like Cruz funded it ...
@1776_reagan1 Oh! Please share with me your magical formula for not allowing opinions to color your feelings and actions! I didn’t realize that was a skill dished out on a partisan basis!
@runajam1 @thegoodbuygirl @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast Makes perfect sense if the “we” is the electorate.
@SugarSugar931 @thegoodbuygirl @Marymakestoast Wait. So nothing done in the personal sphere counts? So Clinton never should have had to give the deposition in th Paula Jones case that got him impeached? ... Point on Strzok isn’t if he’s a good guy. Question is if the investigation got tainted by bias.
@tparsley6960 Sure you can’t fully suppress opinions, potentially. That’s why it’s imperative to have the second step in the analysis: did the opinion lead to bias in the investigation? IG report clearly says no.
@drou_bre Except you get jurors who have opinions and even know parties all the time! Thanks for helping make my point. The jury observation is an astute one.
@naugusta @brithume That’s patently untrue. Judges rules on issues all the time they may have personal opinions about. And, more pointedly, jurors are allowed to sit for some cases even if they know a party but don’t believe it will impair their ability to reach an impartial verdict.
@kikidan I extend to you the same offer to provide facts and evidence to support your conclusion!
@SugarSugar931 LOL to “poundtown rendezvous.”
@zaleski_thomas But Strzok had no hand in making a charging decision. And there’s no evidence of your other claims. By all means, provide some.
@OliverParks18 The FBI doesn’t comment regarding ongoing investigations. Long-standing policy.
@CasualMeyhem Concur. But that doesn’t mean the entire investigation should be thrown out. No conclusion that it was compromised because of his opinions.
@7SunnyView @boobsforgold @Nuhaserrac @Marymakestoast @Idaho_HUB @brithume I read the whole article, thanks. I think you refuse to see a distinction between “Republican” and “conservative.” I reject the repackaging of southern racism in its “states rights” and “individual responsibility” form. I also know the Civil War was all about slavery.
@boobsforgold @Marymakestoast @7SunnyView @Nuhaserrac @Idaho_HUB I am always willing to engage and always hope for respectful, fruitful dialogue. I can scream disagreement at you all day and still to buy you a beer at the end of it.
@tdhalesmt How fast do you think Republicans did the same when Ken Starr got appointed?
@7SunnyView @boobsforgold @Nuhaserrac @Marymakestoast @Idaho_HUB I see your article and raise you:		Interpreting Some Overlooked Stories From the South  https://t.co/ahZQS1x5HT		This comes down to the long-held desire to mask racism in another vernacular. We can disagree over it. But indisputably conservatives opposed civil rights.
@wrecked600rr Cannot emphasize enough the difference between being a candidate for president and being a private citizen. I expect everyone to have an opinion about the former. Way fewer to have opinion about the latter.
@DodsonBill @thegoodbuygirl @psychsurvival @SugarSugar931 @Marymakestoast @brithume No, seeking asylum no matter the method of entry is a protected legal status and not a crime.
@GlenWoodfin @JenaNotJameson *Jena
@HonestJude I don’t. I have great faith in the judiciary. I do have a problem with how politicized the process is for all judicial nominations. It has hurt our courts. I opposed Reid taking away the filibuster for appointments. I oppose McConnell doing the same for SCOTUS.
@ZYinzzzz Well played!!
@7SunnyView @boobsforgold @Nuhaserrac @Marymakestoast @Idaho_HUB @brithume I’m an American and have great familiarity with the history of civil rights legislation. It was a conservative vs. liberal issue. People in both parties supported and opposed. Those who opposed all ended up joining forces as Republicans since the CRA of 1964.
@boobsforgold @7SunnyView @Nuhaserrac @Marymakestoast @Idaho_HUB @brithume Right. Which is why I said conservatives. Also, you should brush up as well on the history of civil rights legislation from the 1920s to 1950s, which ran into a conservative coalition of Republicans and Democrats.
@XtamerlaneX @brithume I actually wouldn’t. Hypocrisy is a killer of democracy. It’s why I have such distaste for McConnell and his SCOTUS nominee flip flopping. Among many examples of hypocrisy on both sides.
@injoyfulhope1 @DarrenG71973819 I think you misinterpret the meaning of my tweet. Also, it’s “electoral” process.
@patwestcoast @brithume It’s amazing conservatives can say Trump doesn’t lie!
@CryptoRays That makes no sense. He also wasn’t expressing bias. He was expressing an opinion. The question is whether that opinion manifested itself in bias. The IG forcefully concluded it did not, based on examination of the evidence.
@XtamerlaneX @Luck_Fiberals16 I said conservatives. Not a political party.
@spitsfire_ @Marymakestoast @brithume *can’t #grammarpolice
@RustyBradley74 @DonalJMurphy @gblockheads @Marymakestoast But you can’t just say “I won’t give weight to the IG report” for no substantiated reason and then say you’re relying on evidence. It seems you are relying on your feeling about this. I welcome evidence and specific examples and am open to being proven wrong.
@bulliegirl1959 Sure, if there was evidence that he was trying to do so. But it appears the “we” meant the electorate. And the IG report didn’t find bias. So he didn’t like him, the texts were dumb, and it had no impact on the investigation.
This is basically the perfect summation. https://t.co/MvOwCX8PGd
@1WorldTrader @KyleC7511 I think you’re conflating his dislike of someone running for office and whether he could still do his job. The evidence of bias in the investigation simply isn’t there, and what’s pathetic is hanging your hat on a position without evidentiary support.
@moonskoobie @awej3 He was an Australian diplomat who, you know, had business in London. He’s now ambassador to the UK. Based in London.
@KyleC7511 @1WorldTrader Also, you expect people will form opinions about those running for high political office. But not of some random private party. That’s a significant difference.
@KyleC7511 @1WorldTrader Please refrain from personal attacks. It is apples to oranges. The analogy that works better is a juror. There’s no indication Strzok had formed a conclusion about his investigations. There was no conclusion of bias.
@everlong554 @awej3 Not seeing any specific evidence or examples here. Just conclusions. Makes me think you might have some bias, rather than a reasoned opinion.
@vol80 @JenaNotJameson Please provide specific evidence and examples for the 90% of your team. Also, your conclusion on Strzok is not supported by the record.
@1WorldTrader @KyleC7511 Except not because it’s apples to oranges. Next.
@KyleC7511 But I’m not a public figure running for President. There would be no reason for him to be texting about me. So your analogy doesn’t hold up.
@jmotivator Please share the secret of your mind-reading ability that lets you guarantee that. Or would you like to bet $250 on it? I absolutely believe it. Don’t act so surprised when you meet a person who’s rational.
@7SunnyView @Nuhaserrac @Marymakestoast @Idaho_HUB @brithume Racism is a conservative value historically, I’ll give you that.
@Bama86Bama @JenaNotJameson @brithume @HillaryClinton @SallyQYates Could someone PLEASE explain the “13 Dems” thing because we all agree Mueller is a Republican, right? To say otherwise is demonstrably false.
@TechQn Difference continues to be personal opinion and whether it had demonstrable impact on his job. A lot of us can relate to that - have a boss you dislike and trash talk but still do your work.
@TechQn So he’s not nice. But I don’t make the same conclusion on his motive or his explanation. And I have nothing on this insurance policy thing, but it doesn’t bother me because there’s no evidence that anything of concern exists on that. If it itself even does.
@theoriginal1960 @dbongino Haha! Ok that was legit funny @theoriginal1960. Well played.
@MikeLester @brithume There are other explanations, but your concern for the statement is fair.
@dbongino You are too stupid to follow. #blocked
@Luck_Fiberals16 @brithume I agree that can be a recipe for bad things. But please provide specific examples that it did so here. Also, “my ilk”? I do believe it was conservatives in the south who absolutely insisted on segregation. I recommend brushing up on the history of that.
@TechQn The timing of the “stop him” comment you’ve just pointed out underscores Strzok’s own explanation that he felt the “we” was the electorate, not the FBI.
@MayThewords @brithume No, because the appearance of bias was sufficient. It didn’t reach the level of bias in Mueller’s eyes (I’m guessing), but even the appearance was serious enough.
@TechQn I don’t think what you’ve just pointed to, given the explained context in testimony today, and the IG conclusions show a tainted investigation or that the work he did was biased. But I definitely appreciate why those texts would raise concerns. I think Mueller responded correctly
@nsewanswers @awej3 @brithume Okay ... first, other Republicans initiated the Steele dossier work. So that point doesn’t pan on. Please provide evidence that the FBI paid for it. That’s news to me.
@sunnydays878 @JenaNotJameson @brithume As we should. Because it makes our respective positions stronger. I appreciate your reasoned responses. We need more of that in our public discourse. Thanks!
@coshjoupe @kildea_m @sunnydays878 @JenaNotJameson @brithume Thanks @coshjoupe for the link!
@kildea_m @coshjoupe @sunnydays878 @JenaNotJameson @brithume Please cite to that specific conclusion. I’ve been unable to find it.
@CaseyParksIt @Marymakestoast @brithume How do you square that conclusion with the exhaustive IG report that comes to the opposite conclusion?
@DarrenG71973819 @brithume Millions of Americans actually tried to do that. 63 million. They voted.
@TechQn @gblockheads @RustyBradley74 @Marymakestoast @brithume I’m not sure what you’re referring to, but please provide specific examples of the bias you mention!
@sunnydays878 @JenaNotJameson @brithume Although obviously rational people can disagree over his explanation.
@sunnydays878 @JenaNotJameson @brithume The adultery is immaterial. But a good point about the “stop him” email. I think, though, his explanation of the full context and the IG report conclusions rebut that as being indicative that he was or did do anything in his official capacity that tainted the investigation.
@sunnydays878 @JenaNotJameson @brithume Again, please provide specific examples. Not just conclusions or feelings.
@blon480 @brithume Again, please provide specific examples and evidence and not merely conclusions or your opinions.
@johnny4america @brithume But even more so that it’s a political opinion. You expect all people to have those. So whether there is bias and, if any, whether it affected the investigation is the inquiry. IG conclusions are unequivocal on that.
@blon480 @brithume Well, as a Trump support @blon480, I agree you likely know how hate works. But please include specific examples and evidence to support your point and not merely conclusory statements.

@RustyBradley74 @gblockheads @Marymakestoast @brithume Please provide specific examples that contradict the IG report that there was no bias that affected the investigation.
@KCancelmo @brithume Irrelevant. So he’s not nice. The president and, indeed, everyone has people they disdain. That tells me nothing about how he does his job.
@JoeNeysailor @brithume Thanks for your considered response. But isn’t categorizing the seriousness of the investigated subjects something he can and should do? We can disagree about the conclusion, but making the conclusion doesn’t inherently indicate bias.
If only the Speaker of the House were in position to do something. https://t.co/N8WeVfOBlK
@awej3 @brithume What IS this truth you’re talking about? If you believe the Mueller investigation is a witch hunt, please provide specific examples based on evidence and not simply make conclusions.
@Crisstti @brithume There’s a whole report from the IG that resulted from an in-depth investigation that says there wasn’t bias. Please provide specific examples that contradict that report or undermine its conclusions.
@dawn_haggard @Miggelindo @brithume Please provide evidence and specific examples. Also, he was not fired. He was reassigned.
@TrumpPollock1 @brithume Didn’t he? Could you provide specific examples?
@kgyngirl77 @brithume So people who investigate can’t have personal opinions? That can’t be right. But as Brit rightly pointed out, Mueller removed Strzok. That’s as it should have been. But it doesn’t necessitate a conclusion of bias or that the investigation is somehow a witch hunt.
@brithume Good question! And I think rightly he did so to avoid any appearance of impropriety - which is similar to the standard judges hold themselves to in recusal decisions.
@Belindahenry18 @brithume Very true! And many other circumstances. But on its face it isn’t disqualifying, and the IG report makes clear it wasn’t a big factor here.
@KimStrassel And let’s also not forget of all the other safeguards in place to ensure something like personal opinion didn’t taint an investigation, as the IG report made clear. This isn’t hard, but I realize it’s difficult in the Trump era to understand because he demands sycophants.
@KimStrassel Well, if I were running for President and such a well-known public figure, I’d presume anyone investigating me or, you know, just being a citizen might have feelings toward me. I wouldn’t presume he couldn’t do his job.
@brithume That’s because, Brit, you can have personal opinions and still do your job. I know that’s hard for you, but millions of us can do it!
@BillKristol Your adherence to principal has been admirable in the Trump era, sir. We would disagree over many policies, but it would always be respectfully. We need more people like you.
@housewolves @dbongino No, when it ends, and there are investigative findings, that’s the time those issues get discussed. This is not some new set of rules.
@AnnCoulter “No good reason” being that the questions pertain to an ongoing investigation? You’re such a hack. Go complain about getting a shitty airline seat. It suits how petty you are.
