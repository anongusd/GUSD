As close as @SpeakerPelosi got to a victory lap: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt unify our caucus our values unify us, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the same in the Senate. And the fact is is that our diversity is our strength. ... But our unity is our power and that is what maybe the president underestimated.‚Äù

Conference motion will be separate. That could be done when House members return.
Per House Democratic aide, plan is to pass clean CR by unanimous consent. Government on track to reopen TODAY.
Trump closes: "Let me be very clear: We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier. If we don;t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shutdown on Feb. 15 again or I will use the powers afforded to me ... to address this emergency."
THERE it is: If I don't get a wall by 2/15, I will declare a national emergency. And scene.
"No border security plan can work without a physical barrier. Just doesn't happen."
Ah, there it is: "Walls should not be controversial. ... No matter where you go, they work." But he does not seem to be explicitly demanding the conferenced bill include wall funding.
Trump announces conf committee on homeland security funding. "I expect that both Democrats and Republicans will work in good faith." I am not hearing the word "wall."
Trump says he will sign bill "very soon" and workers will get paid "very quickly or as soon as possible."

Hoyer blames Trump "demagoguery" for shutdown. "the president is fixated on walls, and we are not discussing alternatives," but then says talk if technology "came up."
On the politics of shutdowns: after '95/96 shutdowns, "there was not another shutdown for 17 years" because GOP learned they are so unpopular.
HOYER says Trump using emerg powers is "analogous to governments all around the world who declare martial law...to do whatever it is they want to do."	An abuse of power? "It certainly could be. ... There is no crisis. There is no invasion. There is no clear and present danger."

@CitizenChgo @feliciasonmez A circuit judge is an appellate judge. A Supreme Court justice is also an appellate judge. So circuit judge would be the more precise term.

So the coverage has trained on the question: Given both her acumen and her unpopularity, is she worth it? Pelosi herself says she's worth it. Many in the party disagree, most quietly. 5/
Per Gallup, she is markedly less popular than Paul Ryan, who is about as well known, and better known than Mitch McConnell, who is similarly unpopular. Independents in particular are much more favorable about Ryan than they are about Pelosi. 4/

Per a member familiar, the deal is that conservatives are giving Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte a list of documents to be delivered during the next several weeks, with an agreement to hold DOJ in contempt if they don't deliver them.
NEW: Scalise aide says there will be no impeachment vote today: "Members agreed the best path forward is to keep this and contempt on the table in order to keep the pressure up on DOJ to demonstrate how serious the House is about obtaining these documents."

&gt;@GOPLeader also says DOJ should comply... "They've got a responsibility; we have a responsibility."	But suggests imoeachnent resolution should not get floor vote... "I always think you gotta go through committee, lay out the case."
@SteveScalise: "We've given them a lot of time, and it's time for them to take this serious, to turn over the remaining documents and stop stonewalling and stop trying to hide the facts from the American people."

Regarding contempt/impeachment for Rosenstein, Meadows would not comment except to say there is "still great frustration" and he wanted to talk it over with Goodlatte/Gowdy.

In memoriam, here is @louiseslaughter last month, debating a rule at 4 a.m. (!) in order to end a brief government shutdown and send a major bipartisan budget deal to the president's desk. RIP: https://t.co/kjZdLxBCgK
And she did it well. As many others have noted, she was sharp, feisty and beloved until her last day on Capitol Hill.
Serving in the Rules minority is perhaps the most thankless job in a Congress full of them. But someone has to do it! Someone has to fight! And @LouiseSlaughter did that thankless job into her 89th year.
And, especially these days, none of that debate matters. At all. After all the talking and debating, the majority party does what the majority party's leadership wants to do.
The Rules Cmte is a weird place. You meet at odd hours in what are often marathon meetings in a cramped room where dozens upon dozens of amendments are debated.
And after serving four years as Rules Committee chairman, the first woman to hold the post, she kept going more than seven more years as ranker. That in itself is an incredible feat.
She pushed relentlessly to curb the unnecessary use of powerful antibiotics to prevent drug-resistant superbugs. She called out @RepChrisCollins for potential ethics violations regarding his business dealings.
That cannot be said of @LouiseSlaughter, who did these things in her 80s: She got the STOCK Act through the House, which exposed and curtailed insider trading by lawmakers.
Aging on Capitol Hill can be a quiet and humbling experience. See the final years of many diminished octogenarian lawmakers, including some of those still sitting in powerful positions today.

Times like this when I wish I could take a picture from the gallery of everyone on the floor starting at the tally board.
GOP well into majority of the majority at this point. Feel like 170 would be a tipping point for Dems, given that 45 voted to break Jan shutdown.
So 157 yes votes on the board. All but a few are Rs. A lot of Dems holding back seeing what GOP will put up. Some game theory in action.

House CR has been posted	Text:	https://t.co/09QZRCdh4E	Section by section: https://t.co/iZeJEE2Pue
@JRubinBlogger Yes, but CHIP is mainly aimed at the 2018 Senate Dems,
Wonky note: House Dems opposed previous GOP CHIP reauth because they didn't like the payfors. New CBO baseline made the bill cheaper so they ditched the ones Dems hated. Still doesn't means Dems won't find something else to hate.
According to multiple members and aides, CR will go through Feb. 16. Will include six year CHIP reauth and delay of minor Obamacare taxes. No disaster aid.
Still early, but not getting a sense that House Republicans are going to revolt on CR. No one I've spoken to who voted for Dec. 21 CR is voting against this one. They're not happy but they aren't taking down the ship.

Lots of punditry this morning (looking at you @Morning_Joe) that Republicans have WH, House &amp; Senate, and OF COURSE they'll get blamed for a shutdown. Maybe true nationally. But try telling that to a Senate Dem running in a Trump state. https://t.co/9b4uAcVhBs
And then (2) depends if R's can split Senate Dems to get to 60 for a CR. Republicans are likely to add a long-term CHIP reauth to the CR in order to get Democratic votes. https://t.co/9b4uAcVhBs
Note House Dems are keeping a hard line. See @repjoecrowley saying sens' deal "fell short" because it includes wall $. Will they hold back votes if a real deal emerges? Of course not, but until then can't expect they will help R's keep gov open. https://t.co/9b4uAcVhBs
Will there be a shutdown? Absent quick dreamer deal, depends (1) on whether House Rs can pass a CR. Dems will hold back votes again as they did past 2 times. Will GOP defense hawks swallow AGAIN? https://t.co/9b4uAcVhBs
