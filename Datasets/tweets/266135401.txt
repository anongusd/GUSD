JoAnne Kloppenburg is on Up Front. I can't stand to watch her any more.
Kloppenburg turned down four times for judgeships.
It is good to see the Troy Merryfield ad.
"If they can't subvert the legislative process, they'll try to subvert the judicial process."
I am at S. A. Loons. More people are signing than not. Good job Larry.
Larry is getting signatures to recall Holperin. I just signed the petition.
The reason GovWalker and Justice Prosser agree a lot is because they both want what is best for our state and our citizens.
Paul Ryan will be on FoxSunday.
The slam-ads are getting worse from the Kloppenburg camp. Impressive, how Justice Prosser is countering these ads.

Don't believe the Kloppenburg lies. Ask us. We will share the truth with you. Prosser is clearly the only choice for Wisconsin.
A vote for JoAnne Kloppenburg is a vote for "bench legislation".
Thank you, Justice Prosser, for protecting Wisconsin families.
