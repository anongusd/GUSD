Working closely with fishermen toward a thriving fishery and healthy albatross populations was really satisfying - together, we really made a difference. When an @OregonSeaGrant fisheries extension position opened in Astoria, OR, I jumped at the opportunity. #mySGStory https://t.co/llslwdoDTr
Great experience in collaboration, listening &amp; co-discovery. We talked albatross conservation w/ 100s of fishermen, got streamer lines on key WC longline vessels &amp; our findings are getting incorporated into policy - giving fishermen more practical options #squadgoals #MySGStory https://t.co/32OgL6tyia
We found that simple devices called streamer lines could keep birds from attacking baited hooks, but also that fishing at night was a better option for boats that added floats to their fishing gear. And guess where the night fishing idea came from? Fishermen! #MySGStory https://t.co/dZyS8Nj0cx
After grad school, I combined my interests in seabirds &amp; commercial fisheries - I worked with black cod longliners on the West Coast to find practical ways to avoid catching albatrosses. #MySGStory https://t.co/C07ZoLLe7o
Pretty soon I was pursuing a Masters at @OSUCEOAS, studying marine food webs as an @OregonSeaGrant Scholar. I studied how seabird and commercial fish diets overlapped. Could seabirds sample the prey field &amp; help inform fisheries management? #MySGStory https://t.co/AxwMzjuMvl
Moving back to the Oregon Coast in 2006 as an @AmeriCorps volunteer with @USFWSPacific sparked my passion for marine science. I taught over 600 5th graders about shorebirds &amp; environmental science &amp; got to do some wildlife biology on the side! #MySGStory https://t.co/fgaEeRWrga

While our restoration work occurs on public lands, we also support private landowners by working with @NHStateParks to provide free native dune plants to NH residents. If you are in NH &amp; want to restore dunes on your property, let me know! #MySGStory https://t.co/OxwkQC24i0
To date, we’ve led more than 1200 student &amp; adult volunteers to do over 4800 volunteer hours and planted more than 160,000 stems of beachgrass to restore dunes in 5 communities #MySGStory https://t.co/g4e499lBbA
By planting native beachgrass vegetation, we help to build dunes in two ways: roots/rhizomes provide belowground structure that anchor the dunes while stems and leaves aboveground catch the sand from the wind which builds up at the base of the plants #MySGStory https://t.co/YOtIAcABXR
I also work with communities to increase #coastalresilience through sand dune restoration funded by @NHDES. Dunes play an important role in protecting coastlines from storms - they’re our first line of defense against powerful waves &amp; rebuild over time #MySGStory https://t.co/vrfg5sYk1K
In our annual survey of CRV participants, 97% of those surveyed reported an increased capacity to make informed decisions about coastal issues as a result of their involvement in the program #citizenscience #MySGStory https://t.co/aQBGVwV3CY
Just one example of a CRV success: to date, volunteers have collected data on oyster spat (baby oysters) which has contributed to the restoration of over 17 acres of oyster reef to New Hampshire’s Great Bay Estuary #citizenscience #MySGStory https://t.co/hmzwJH0SuI
The goals of the CRV program are to increase research capacity as well as provide community members with authentic research &amp; stewardship experiences. All CRV projects have local research/management objectives #citizenscience #MySGStory https://t.co/i4xZv9z9W6
The CRV program is a new model of #citizenscience where we engage volunteers to work with researchers &amp; natural resource managers on a variety of projects such as eel monitoring, horseshoe crab surveys and more! #citsci #MySGStory https://t.co/rNaqzhKXEj
For the second day of #MySGStory, I'd like to talk about my work @NHSeaGrant which involves engaging community members in coastal resilience efforts, sand dune restoration &amp; local research through the Coastal Research Volunteer (CRV) program. https://t.co/UG7el8Zyt1
My experiences impressed on me the importance of both science &amp; meaningful community engagement. Now I’m fortunate to work @NHSeaGrant where all of my experiences have come together. More about that tomorrow! #MySGStory https://t.co/SwbGkyzWZZ
In grad school I helped lead community-based restoration projects in salt marshes, eelgrass beds &amp; oyster reefs. I see tremendous value in opening up science to local community members to provide greater insight into what we’re doing &amp; opportunities to ask questions. #MySGStory https://t.co/wLm4AaVyq9
I went to graduate school @UofNH where I found my stable isotope experience to be extremely valuable. Using this method, my research found that American eels can remain in New England salt marshes for a long time &amp; rely on them for food #MySGStory https://t.co/lb1GJc6oA7
I worked many jobs after college, including with @MysticMyRWA where I developed a #citizenscience water quality monitoring program. The experience of engaging volunteers in research &amp; stewardship made a big impression on me and would play a formative role in my career #MySGStory https://t.co/1TgK2g1SvO
My first research experience after college was as a technician with @NJSeaGrant. We collected saltmarsh fish and prepped them for stable isotope analysis to look at whether salt marshes serve as an energy source for resident and transient (visiting) fish… they do! #MySGStory https://t.co/KOUqm7RNbC
I went to college @DrewUniversity where I studied biology with a focus on marine and coastal systems. I took a class that took me to @ShoalsMarineLab and #AppledoreIsland - I had no idea that a few years later I’d come	back to NH to study the coast! #MySGStory https://t.co/DfsJjxaCjT

That's a wrap for our April #MySGStory-teller Emily Grason! For more about #citizenscience &amp; #invasivespecies in the #SalishSea, keep up with her adventures by following @WAgreencrab &amp; @WASeaGrant. Thanks, Emily! https://t.co/6QtOkBFHHQ
Or ... a species will be incredibly abundant, then mysteriously and suddenly disappear. This is called boom-bust dynamics #MySGStory https://t.co/M6EW6t5Pq2 @WAgreencrab @WASeaGrant https://t.co/iTkvCwrkEO
A favorite example is #invasive clams in San Francisco Bay. They were present in low abundances for 30y before invasive green crab arrived &amp; started eating the clams’ competitors - good news for clams! #MySGStory https://t.co/kUWKBqu1vi @WAgreencrab @WASeaGrant https://t.co/cm9jmCzpEv
Studying invasions keeps you humble because they often do something unexpected. Species can suddenly become abundant when they previously weren’t - these “lags” can last decades &amp; happen for many reasons #MySGStory https://t.co/T1z647OSU5 @WAgreencrab @WASeaGrant https://t.co/2KJLOiTShU
@GaSouthernBiol @GSCOSM @JohnnyScallops We see a #MySGstory in Dr. Carroll's future! @GeorgiaSeaGrant
Biological invasions don’t follow human-drawn political boundaries - instead, they’re about the evolutionary history that species share (or don’t!) with each other &amp; places #MySGStory @WAgreencrab @WASeaGrant https://t.co/Bo6gYZQL0H
Invasions teach us that evolution matters when it comes to species interactions. If you meet an evolutionary stranger, you might not know how to react #MySGStory https://t.co/4HjzU49DSE @WAgreencrab @WASeaGrant https://t.co/KmxGPTSMA6
Every single invasion is a brand new event! Never before in the history of the earth has that combo of species occurred in that exact place - can make it hard to predict effects. Image credit: @oldenfish #MySGStory @WAgreencrab @WASeaGrant https://t.co/Ac0gTO5vUk
Biological invasions are amazing processes to study - we can learn so much about ecology &amp; evolution from them! #MySGStory @WAgreencrab @WASeaGrant https://t.co/aogCey7m94
On the final day of #MySGStory takeover, I’m going to talk in more detail about why we study biological invasions (AKA #invasivespecies) @WAgreencrab @WASeaGrant https://t.co/TYWS3WNKP4
Last year, @NJSeaGrant educators reached 25,000 K-12 students, including through programs like "Ocean-to-Go!" @NOAAeducation #SeaGrantRewind https://t.co/p0DS6PRUi1 https://t.co/coXh6cSosc
.@SeaGrant is an especially great home for #CitSci: each of the 33 programs bring together scientists, educators, outreach specialists, and communities to tackle tough issues of coastal management across the country #MySGStory https://t.co/Mzec54rf3w
Working with 200+ volunteers brings an amazing amount of energy, creativity &amp; FUN to a project. Totally unrelated: we’re taking suggestions for a Crab Team signature cocktail… #MySGStory https://t.co/NLFIzkdoFE
Communicating how science is done is important in #CitSci. Understanding the “why” of a protocol is as important as the “how” since doing science can be ... tedious. If we don’t convince people it’s important, they’ll find something else to do! #MySGStory https://t.co/bIQqfQAJ0m https://t.co/5bt96pCNYD
The volunteers love having direct access to “their scientists.” We are a gateway for them to learn about more than just crabs - often their observations &amp; off the cuff questions spur me to do literature searches and reach out to experts to learn more #MySGStory https://t.co/FoaJjr6nh1
When creating a #CitSci program, it’s easy to focus just on the “sci”, but we invest at least 1/2 of our time in communicating directly with individual volunteers &amp; sustaining their engagement. Continuing education, logistics, getting right there in the mud with them! #MySGStory https://t.co/VjpM7Tzvid
Designing a #CitSci program for early detection is tricky b/c we’re training volunteers to look for something we hope they don’t find! They can get bored if they never find one. Protocols also collect data on native species &amp; help us learn about understudied habitats #MySGStory https://t.co/bNijUbNiYK
.@WAGreenCrab #volunteers made the very first confirmed detections of this global invader in 2016. It was very exciting to publish the results of their work - pdf download here: https://t.co/O9CVMR7tB2 #MySGStory https://t.co/JM3aaN93gQ
Given the damage #greencrab have done in other parts of the world to shellfish, eelgrass and native ecological communities, there is concern they could dramatically change habitats if they become as abundant in this new range #MySGStory https://t.co/MoJFvGfbvc https://t.co/hOML3Rzjxf
Though they’ve been present on the outer coast for nearly 30 yrs, #invasive #greencrab are just starting to arrive in inland waters &amp; are still extremely rare in Washington’s inland shorelines #MySGStory https://t.co/05DKw5CgKs https://t.co/7Z4wW98gxD
As Program Coordinator for @WAGreenCrab, I train and manage a network of 225 monitors (mostly #volunteers) who sample monthly half of the year for #invasive European #greencrab at 52 sites across WA's #SalishSea #MySGStory https://t.co/gq3bOOHbFw

I got involved with @WASeaGrant as a graduate student in 2014. Instead of a TA or RA, I got to help design and launch a #citizenscience early detection network for #invasive European #greencrab in Washington’s #SalishSea #MySGStory https://t.co/b0meiLDhY2
I delved into science communication (#scicomm) because it was a way to share my excitement for ecology &amp; the natural world in a different “voice” than academic writing. Some examples: https://t.co/IsGJqmw7mi, @SciPos, https://t.co/icFNvUv5jZ, @biodv, @jrsbiodiversity #MySGStory https://t.co/ImtkIyaRiL
But hearing the call of the sea, I returned to marine ecology, earning an MS at @WWU &amp; PhD at @UWBiology by researching how #InvasiveSpecies use different sources of info than natives to tell when they're in danger of being eaten #StrangerDanger #MySGStory https://t.co/g0g7d8Sqj0 https://t.co/a5jTPQEV3L
Heading from one corner of the US to another, I moved to Seattle for @AmeriCorpsVISTA at @LittleBitTRC. I worked w/ volunteers &amp; fundraising, got an intro to non-profit administration &amp; learned the power that a mission has to catalyze &amp; sustain community action #MySGStory https://t.co/siESNMl6yf
As an undergrad, I learned how #InvasiveSpecies can have new ecological interactions. I researched how an invasive bryozan provides a new food source for a native nudibranch. FYI: anemones will eat your research, even if they aren’t supposed to #MySGStory https://t.co/sGk0KS86j5 https://t.co/B1JpLgcOOI

The best gift of all: #25DaysofFishmas has connected me to some truly amazing people and organizations who are helping us better understand &amp; protect the fish who call the #GreatLakes home #MySGStory https://t.co/Ouk8Vm9IDW
Over the past two years of #25DaysofFishmas, I’ve featured 50 different fish species found in the #GreatLakes (both native + invasive) which has encouraged others to share their expertise, memories &amp; stories #MySGStory https://t.co/jvj0JZZaAi
Each day of #25DaysofFishmas is the result of hours of behind-the-scenes research gathering facts &amp; coming up with the day's series of tweets - in 2017, I actually started prepping everything in August! #MySGStory https://t.co/Z3MykUD19F
#25DaysofFishmas was born in 2016 when I saw this poster from @UWiscSeaGrant. It reminded me of an advent calendar - where you open a door each day in December to receive a surprise, only instead of candy, you’d get facts about a different #GreatLakes fish! #MySGStory https://t.co/zlDCFijN2J
For the past two years, I’ve shared facts about different #GreatLakes fish species during a Twitter #scicomm event I created called #25DaysofFishmas #MySGStory https://t.co/itQvWRZaE7
Today is my favorite day of #MySGStory takeover - I'll be talking about my experiences with science communication (#scicomm) through a Twitter event I created called #25DaysofFishmas! https://t.co/qM680Oe6av
Studying fish movement between coastal wetland &amp; lake habitats can help us better understand the importance of wetland habitats for recreational fishing in the #GreatLakes, which is a big contributor to the region's economy #MySGStory https://t.co/DbAQGsEzTQ
This past fall, the #GreatLakes Sea Grant Network released a report about the life history and ecosystem impacts of Asian carp #invasivespecies #InvasiveSpeciesWeek https://t.co/yrEatXR9VN https://t.co/puUjlUyqGW
By linking this chemical record to the otolith's age rings, we can estimate when fish are moving between chemically-distinct habitats #MySGStory https://t.co/KobN9h7JXV
Otoliths not only tell us a fish’s age (we count the rings), but also contain a record of trace elements which get incorporated into the otolith structure based on concentrations in the surrounding water #MySGStory https://t.co/VD5D8Oe3Ce
One way to study fish movement between habitats is through a technique called “otolith microchemistry.” Otoliths are fish ear bones (yes, fish do have ears!) which grow continuously throughout life, forming rings like a tree #MySGStory https://t.co/a6H4o7DxsV
When fish move from wetland to the lake, they might serve as a biotic (biological) link between food webs of those two habitats - basically, moving energy from the wetland into the less-productive nearshore food web #MySGStory https://t.co/ehAfmj4yRy
Some fish species such as perch use coastal wetlands as a nursery - young fish spend early life there growing big on abundant food available before moving to the open water of the lake as they get older #MySGStory https://t.co/1vyMrVtR57
Coastal wetlands are highly-productive ecosystems at the boundary between land and lake that provide important habitat for fish like yellow perch + smallmouth bass #GreatLakesSci #MySGStory https://t.co/dSsro0bT3Z
Today on #MySGStory takeover, I’ll be talking about my ongoing PhD research on how #GreatLakes coastal wetland and nearshore ecosystems are connected, a project that's been supported by @ILINSeaGrant + @UWiscSeaGrant https://t.co/jwcGlN2yUZ

My education was more than just what I learned in the classroom! I learned as much outside of class doing research alongside grad students in a coral lab &amp; getting certified as a scientific diver #MySGStory https://t.co/6xYoL1EGlb
As a marine science major, I took a LOT of science classes. Biology, chemistry (a class I struggled with), physics &amp; geology are all important for understanding how the oceans work #MySGStory https://t.co/MACNKaWLW3
I left the Midwest to do my undergrad at the @univmiami (go Canes!) where I double-majored in Marine Science &amp; Biology #MySGStory https://t.co/eeB90fXR5N
Every day after school, I would voraciously consume nature documentaries - especially ocean ones. In high school, I had the opportunity to take a marine biology elective which resulted in a trip to the FL Keys, and I was hooked! #MySGStory https://t.co/jqC4qVLnsC
Growing up in the 1990s near #LakeErie, “going to the beach” meant keeping shoes on to avoid stepping on sharp shells of zebra mussels (a #GreatLakes invasive) &amp; sometimes not being able to swim because of algae blooms and/or E.coli warnings #MySGStory https://t.co/EhGAuD51m8
