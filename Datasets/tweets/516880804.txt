We closed out this afternoon’s hearing with testimony about the importance of stopping wildlife trafficking &amp; supporting the conservation of endangered species and sustainable resource management at home and around the world. Thanks @TheWCS, @action4ifaw &amp; @HSLegFund.
Thanks to @ABCbirds &amp; @sdzglobal for insights on the delicate balance of many bird species and their habitats – birds are the proverbial ‘canary in the coal mine’ for pollution and climate change impacts.
.@protectNPS testimony highlighted NPS' maintenance backlog &amp; staffing/visitor services needs that have gone unaddressed due to budget constraints. National parks preserve our pristine natural places for future generations &amp; need adequate funding to operate safely &amp; sustainably.

I condemn Mr. Netanyahu’s embracing of the racist Otzma Yehudit party, and I urge all Members of Congress and Pro-Israel groups to join me.
Mr. Netanyahu’s decision to embrace hateful, racist, vile politics has a direct effect on U.S.-Israeli relations. Congress rightly condemns anti-Semitism; it must also condemn this effort by Mr. Netanyahu, a man who has addressed Joint Sessions of Congress on numerous occasions.
An Otzma Yehudit candidate in the April election was denied U.S. entry for being a member of a terrorist group. Another candidate "has acknowledged having a picture in his home of Baruch Goldstein...who massacred 29 Palestinians while they were praying at a mosque in Hebron..."
As Prime Minister Netanyahu seeks re-election he has joined forces with “the extremist party Otzma Yehudit, or Jewish Power, whose leaders have a long history of expressing support for violence against Palestinians &amp; expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the occupied territories."
What does Congress, the Trump administration, and the American people do when the leader of Israel, a U.S. ally and beneficiary of billions of dollars in aid, embraces racists and terrorists? https://t.co/gY2qckBkdF

Let’s be clear – this is not a national emergency, it is a political emergency for President Trump. Instead of working with Congress on humane, responsible, and effective border security, the President has chosen to abuse his power under the Constitution.
Just voted for the bipartisan compromise agreement to keep government open. President Trump should sign this bill immediately and keep our federal employees at work.
The only emergency at the border was created by President Trump &amp; his barbaric policy of family separation. The President should not abuse his power by declaring an emergency to fulfill a campaign promise he failed to deliver when the GOP had full gov't control for two years.

@Upworthy @HRC A6: In 1993 as a member of the Minnesota State House, I was proud to vote to ban workplace discrimination in our state. Now, we need to move to pass these protections at the federal level so that all LGBTQ people can be protected from harassment in the workplace.

In February, Congress appropriated $516 mill to Interior for recovery from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. As of the week of May 14th, $3 million was obligated – which means the Dept. had withheld $513 million. This is unacceptable when hurricane season begins this month.
These cuts target air and water quality programs, and reduce funding to enforce the law against polluters. If enacted, they will undermine the EPA’s ability to keep our families and communities healthy, and to protect our environment for future generations.

@realDonaldTrump @Interior @SecretaryZinke It is alarming that @realDonaldTrump continues to prioritize “energy dominance” and profits for the fossil fuel industry over the protection of our national treasures, the conservation of our natural habitats &amp; our responsibilities to the American people.
@realDonaldTrump @Interior @SecretaryZinke .@SecretaryZinke, your task is to protect, preserve &amp; use resources wisely for the benefit of the American people today, and for future generations. Right now, you are not meeting your mission.
@realDonaldTrump @Interior .@Interior serves the American public &amp; tells the story of America. It should reflect its diversity and should never marginalize minorities. That's why I'm so disappointed about the apparent discrimination @SecretaryZinke's reassignment of senior staff.
@realDonaldTrump The first year of @realDonaldTrump's administration has also undermined scientific integrity, threatened access to our National Parks &amp; began a "reorganization" process that could disrupt all of the functions of @Interior.
@realDonaldTrump Shrinking the #BearsEars National Monument to expand mining and opening up the #ArcticRefuge for oil drilling both demonstrate @realDonaldTrump's callous disregard for our treasured places.
Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump's disregard for the well-being of the American people goes far beyond his budget. His first year in office has been remarkably damaging to our environment, public health &amp; natural resources.

@realDonaldTrump @EPA Our natural resources and public lands are targeted by the #TrumpBudget, including a 13 percent cut to @Interior and an end to new acquisitions under #LWCF.
The #TrumpBudget embodies @realDonaldTrump's Polluters First agenda, with a devastating 24 percent cut to the @EPA that will endanger human health &amp; our environment. https://t.co/3AosnihqMZ
@realDonaldTrump The good news is that much of the #TrumpBudget is dead on arrival in Congress. As we move forward with the appropriations process, I’m going to fight alongside @AppropsDems for #ABetterDeal that gives all Americans the opportunity to contribute and succeed.
@realDonaldTrump Eliminating heating assistance for low-income seniors and families, cutting support for public schools &amp; college students, slashing funds to hire police officers, and zeroing out arts &amp; humanities hurts our families and weakens our communities.
The #TrumpBudget reflects @realDonaldTrump's warped values by offsetting the #GOPTaxScam's giveaways to the rich with attacks on the critical investments that keep Minnesota and our entire nation safe, strong &amp; moving forward. https://t.co/q1ZuOuQWM4

@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Until Republicans are serious about negotiating with Democrats on a budget agreement, the continuing resolution passed today will simply yield another continuing resolution — or shutdown — next month. That is a terrible deal for Minnesota.
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP While @HouseGOP has finally stopped blocking #CHIP reauthorization, this CR still fails Minnesota children and families. It does nothing to extend Community Health Centers, which will now be forced to lay off staff and limit services.
We all wanted the #TrumpShutdown to end, but the 17-day CR that was passed today does nothing but paper over the abject failure of @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP to agree on a budget and address urgent priorities.

Now, more than ever, we need all Americans to emulate the civic engagement and moral leadership that characterized Dr. King’s movement. We must speak out against bigotry and discrimination in all forms and redouble our efforts to pursue justice and equality for all.
Today Dr. King’s legacy is under direct attack from the Trump-Pence White House and the complicit silence of Congressional Republicans. President Trump openly uses racist rhetoric as his administration rolls back the progress our country has made in living up to Dr. King’s dream.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. dedicated his life to equality &amp; opportunity for all Americans. He spoke up for civil rights, civil liberties, voting rights, health care, living wages, union representation, women’s reproductive rights &amp; a more peaceful foreign policy. #MLKDay2018

@realDonaldTrump @GOP It’s an affront to our democracy and a waste of taxpayer dollars. No federal funds should be spent on this sham commission.
@realDonaldTrump This commission exists solely to justify @realDonaldTrump’s false claims about "illegal voting" &amp; further @GOP’s voter suppression agenda.
Tomorrow I'm introducing an amendment to defund @realDonaldTrump's sham "election integrity commission." https://t.co/fqt0NLQl4Z
I oppose @HouseGOP's sharp cuts to the #EPA &amp; other programs that protect our resources. I'll keep working to fully fund these priorities.
@HouseGOP @EPA The @HouseGOP Interior-Environment bill weakens the enforcement that keeps toxins out of our air and water.
@HouseGOP @EPA The cuts proposed in this bill would further undermine #EPA’s ability to protect human health and the health of our environment.
Once again, the Environmental Protection Agency is hit hard by @HouseGOP budget cuts. The proposed $528 million cut to @EPA is unacceptable.

@realDonaldTrump I will keeping working with @AppropsDems &amp; my Republican colleagues to craft a responsible budget that protects our environment.
@realDonaldTrump The #EPA is already struggling to do its job and keep Americans safe. We cannot afford to cut any more money from this critical agency.
We learned today just how little @realDonaldTrump cares about safeguarding our environment. A 30 percent cut to the #EPA is unacceptable.
@EPAScottPruitt I look forward to a thorough explanation from the Administrator of his apparently inaccurate and incomplete answers to the Senate.
I asked @EPAScottPruitt about very distressing report he gave misleading answers about his email use as Oklahoma AG. https://t.co/jvfvIcMnDe
RT @johnupton: Pruitt's proposal to cut EPA grants programs was described as a "nonstarter" by Democrat @BettyMcCollum04 of Minnesota.
To really help miners, we must oppose @realDonaldTrump's elimination of Appalachian Regional Commission, which supports these communities.
FACT: Power plants are using natural gas because it is cheaper and burns cleaner than coal.
Once again, cutting 3,800  frontline scientists, experts &amp; enforcement officers will make it impossible for #EPA to keep Americans safe.
@EPAScottPruitt Key American partners like the UK, France, Canada (among many others) have condemned @realDonaldTrump's #ParisAgreement withdrawal.
FACT: @EPAScottPruitt left the G7 meetings more than a day early. There is no serious effort to renegotiate the #ParisAgreement.
The #EPA cannot carry out its mission with 3,800 fewer frontline scientists, experts &amp; enforcement officers. https://t.co/UVWGqNJiQU

In short, the American taxpayer is getting a great deal from these programs that protect our resources, create jobs, and promote growth!
For example, for every $1 invested in Great Lakes restoration, there is a $2 return in benefits like increased tourism and home values.
The #EPA's geographic programs clean up national treasures like Puget Sound and generate economic growth &amp; jobs in local communities.
Learn more about the time @EPAScottPruitt ignored science and left a dangerous neurotoxin on the market → https://t.co/rZd63P3cwg.
FACT: @EPAScottPruitt's budget cuts Superfund by 30 percent. That means fewer cleanups &amp; more toxic waste sites in our neighborhoods.
Congress cannot allow the many harms that #TrumpCuts will inflict. @HouseDemocrats will stand strong for environmental protection.
One egregious example: radon kills 21,000 Americans each year.		@realDonaldTrump &amp; @EPAScottPruitt propose ending the #EPA's radon program.
The #EPA's budget has already been cut 29 percent since fiscal year 2010. We cannot cut a single dollar more without putting lives at risk.
#TrumpCuts eliminates nearly 3,800 #EPA employees — frontline scientists, experts &amp; enforcement officers who protect the American people.
#TrumpCuts cuts categorical grants by 46 percent, crippling states’ ability to implement environmental programs that protect public health.
@realDonaldTrump This cut comes after @EPAScottPruitt ignored #EPA science &amp; kept chlorpyrifos, a very dangerous pesticide, on the market.
.@realDonaldTrump's contempt for science is made clear by a 46 percent cut to EPA’s Office of Research and Development.
The budget ends enormously successful geographic programs focused on treasures like our Great Lakes, the Puget Sound &amp; the Chesapeake Bay.
The budget eliminates programs like @ENERGYSTAR, which has saved Americans an estimated $430 billion on utility bills since 1992.
@realDonaldTrump In fact, this budget cuts funding for the EPA's climate change programs by an appalling 91 percent.
.@realDonaldTrump's #TrumpCuts budget is the latest expression of his willful denial of climate science.
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; @EPAScottPruitt want to cut the #EPA by 30 percent, abandoning the agency's responsibility to protect American families.

These 10 examples are just the start. @realDonaldTrump's budget touches virtually every program &amp; shifts burdens onto Minnesota taxpayers.
10/ @Amtrak service at St. Paul's Union Depot could be eliminated as funding is refocused to the Northeast. #TrumpCuts is bad for transit.
9/ Community Development Block Grant, which helps economic development &amp; affordable housing, is gone. #TrumpCuts = less investment in MN.
8/ Support for the arts and the humanities is zeroed out. #TrumpCuts imperils our community's cultural, civic &amp; economic life.
7/ Community Services Block Grant for Community Action Agencies to fight poverty is terminated. #TrumpCuts leaves most vulnerable behind.
6/ Minnesota will get less money to keep our roads and highways safe &amp; commuters moving. #TrumpCuts sends roads towards gridlock.
5/ AmeriCorps and Senior Corps are abolished, putting a big strain on Minnesota nonprofits. #TrumpCuts means fewer volunteers.
4/ Public school students will lose resources in school &amp; after-school programs eliminated. #TrumpCuts is bad for our children.
3/ Heating assistance and home weatherization for families &amp; seniors is eliminated. #TrumpCuts leaves Minnesotans in the cold.
2/ Superfund program will be cut dramatically, meaning more toxic waste sites will fester in communities. #TrumpCuts threaten public health.
1/ Law enforcement will have fewer resources to keep us safe &amp; to support victims of domestic violence. #TrumpCuts are downright dangerous.
How will Minnesotans (and all Americans) be affected by the devastating cuts in @realDonaldTrump's budget? Here’s just a few ways.

It is time for citizens to stand together with @HouseDemocrats to stop this disastrous bill before that nightmare becomes our reality.
The @USCBO has given the American people a glimpse into the nightmare that the @HouseGOP health care bill will cause.
Health insurance and pharmaceutical executives will reap huge profits, while 24 million more Americans will be one illness away from ruin.
The @USCBO score also shows that many American women will lose access to comprehensive health care because of @HouseGOP attack on @PPFA.
.@HouseGOP bill cuts $880 billion from Medicaid, the health care that low-income Americans, seniors, and people with disabilities rely on.
.@HouseGOP health care bill causes insurance premiums to increase, per @USCBO. Their bill actually makes Americans #PayMoreForLess.
.@USCBO score demonstrates @HouseGOP bill shreds safety net that tens of millions of families rely on when a loved one is sick.
Today’s @USCBO report confirms that @HouseGOP &amp; @realDonaldTrump's health care bill is a mean-spirited and callous #RxForDisaster.
