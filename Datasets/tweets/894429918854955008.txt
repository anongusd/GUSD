@ProfMSinha I am glad that you took the time to respond, but am concerned with this distinction because your article makes it sound like Johnson bucked his own party when in reality he was a Democratic figurehead whose own politics would have figured zilch had Lincoln not been assassinated.
@ProfMSinha Johnson is who we are talking about.
@ProfMSinha The National Union Party was created SPECIFICALLY TO ATTRACT DEMOCRATS. There was no such thing as a Republican National Union Party. The whole point was to rebrand as not just Republicans‚Äîhence the nomination of Johnson, a known Democrat!
Oh, You Won Your Ring On A Superteam? Big Deal üôÑ https://t.co/UAHkc7q4Q8 		Was expecting some ad hoc analytics to justify this take a la when LeBron‚Äôs finals record was justified
@ProfMSinha But his own party remained the Democratic Party. Running on a particular ticket doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you adopt that party as your own, see Bernie Sanders.
@ProfMSinha What evidence do you have for this assertion? I have never heard that Johnson became a Republican. The whole raison d‚Äô√™tre of his Vice Presidency was that he was a Democrat. Upon acceding to the Presidency, as you point out in your article, he certainly governed like one.
@ProfMSinha You say, ‚Äúhis own party, the Republicans,‚Äù which is not the same thing as ‚Äúa Democrat who joined the  National Union coalition with Republicans.‚Äù
@nycsouthpaw @KilljoyGSW Unlike the James Gunn ‚Äújokes‚Äù, I think this was funny.
