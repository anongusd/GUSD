Tonight, I'll watch as Donald Trump gives his first #SOTU. He'll undoubtedly praise the tax bill that stole trillions from the middle class to help the richest 1%. He‚Äôll talk about de-regulation when he really means rolling back critical protections for clean air &amp; clean water.

These values are not Ventura County's values. It's clear that Tony Strickland is way too extreme for Ventura County. #CA26
Tony Strickland said that this plan "deserves a lot of credit" and he'll vote for it with the rest of his party if elected to Congress #CA26
As supported by Strickland, the Ryan Budget makes all these cuts to give even more tax cuts to the richest Americans. #CA26
As supported by Strickland, it will reinstate annual and lifetime caps on healthcare coverage. #CA26
As supported by Strickland, it will allow insurance companies to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions such as breast cancer. #CA26
As supported by Strickland, it allows insurance companies to charge women more than men for the same services. #CA26
As supported by Strickland, it slashes over $100 billion from education funding and reduces Pell Grants for 9.6 million students. #CA26
As supported by Strickland, this budget cuts Medicare's guaranteed benefits to force seniors to pay an extra $6,400 more per year. #CA26
As supported by Strickland, this budget raises the Medicare age of eligibility. #CA26

Julia: Failed ideology that didn‚Äôt work under Bush, won‚Äôt work now. #CD26Debate
Julia: I believe we should allow wealthy to pay fair share, rather than cut education to pay for tax breaks for rich. # CD26Debate
Julia: Education is how we provide opportunity to future generations. We must improve education in VC for our children. #CD26Debate
Tony Strickland says he's moderate but his favorite justice? Clarence Thomas. It's not what you say, it's what you believe. #CD26Debate
Julia: We must create jobs in VC by improving education, investing in clean energy tech and supporting small businesses. # CD26Debate
Julia: In Congress, I‚Äôll work hard to protect Naval Base Ventura County so it remains a key source of jobs for VC. #CD26Debate
Julia: Medicare and Social Security are promises to seniors who have paid into them, and we must uphold those promises. # CD26Debate

That's not the Strickland-Ryan plan. #CA26
Ventura County needs leadership that will grow middle class, nurture our children, defend seniors, respect ALL segments of community. #CA26
Strickland and Ryan have both signed Grover Norquist‚Äôs destructive extremist pledge. #CA26
Strickland and Ryan will pay for these cuts to seniors, middle class, and children by slashing taxes on very wealthy. #CA26
Strickland and Ryan have both opposed requiring insurance companies to provide coverage for maternity services. #CA26
Strickland and Ryan have both opposed requiring insurance companies to provide coverage for birth control. #CA26
Strickland-Ryan plan will allow insurance companies to charge women more than men for same services. #CA26
Strickland-Ryan plan will no longer allow kids to stay on parents‚Äô healthcare plan through age 26. #CA26.
Strickland-Ryan plan will kick 200,000 kids out of the Head Start Program. #CA26
Strickland-Ryan plan will cut $115 billion from education over the next decade. That‚Äôs not a recipe for growth. #CA26
Strickland-Ryan plan will turn medicare into a voucher program, make seniors pay an average of $6,400 more per year for healthcare. #CA26
The following are just some of the effects of the policy Tony Strickland and Paul Ryan are proposing. #CA26
Tony Strickland is trying to run from his friend Paul Ryan and hide from their policies that are just too extreme for Ventura County.
As Paul Ryan addresses the RNC, let‚Äôs examine the destructive effects the Strickland-Ryan plan will have on seniors, children, middle class.

If the governor signs AB 487, schools can sell surplus materials instead of donating, recycling or dumping them. Millions in savings!
AB 487 lets school districts and county offices of education sell surplus and obsolete materials. Proceeds can be used for new materials.
I'm celebrating the passage of my bill, AB 487, to help California's cash-strapped schools recoup money they spend on books and materials.
Now we just need Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign this bill.
AB 239 passed on a unanimous 61-0 vote. Access to highly-qualified teachers boosts student achievement, so this is an important step.
My bill, AB 239, simplifies the credential process for teachers and counselors who attain rigorous national board certification.
CA faces a serious shortage of counselors and specialized teachers in math, science and special education.
The Assembly just passed my bill streamlining the credentialing process for exceptional teachers and counselors in CA!
A vibrant economy requires workers with the skills they need to do their jobs well. That's why quality schools are essential.
It is imperative we invest wisely in education, make sure all students have the resources they need to learn -- not just for a few students.
AB 8 will start streamlining school funding, making it easy to see where Californians' resources are going and what the outcomes are.
This is shameful! We can't educate our students to compete in the world without adequate funding for schools.
A parent said she had to teach art at her children's school because they have no money to hire an art teacher.
One of the students said she was a gifted student but her school had no money for a GATE program for her.
Parents said they are tired of raising funds to pay for basic school supplies like paper and art materials.
There were lots of parents and children at the event. They all want quality education and transparency in funding.
I spoke at Burning Moms' childrens' rally at the State Capitol a few minutes ago. I urged support for my bill, AB 8.
Just one PVC bottle can ruin an entire batch of plastic during recycling. What a waste! There are lots of alternatives to PVC.
Plastic containing PVC looks identical to recyclable, non-toxic PET bottles.
Scarcely any of the 60,000 tons of PVC generated annually in CA is recycled because of high costs and few markets for it.
A bill I have to reduce PVC in plastic packaging in CA won passage in the CA Assembly tonight.
AB 314 helps schools with buying textbooks and requires publishers to offer electronic versions cheaper than print.
The CA Assembly tonight passed my bill to give school districts greater options and flexibility in buying textbooks.
AB 627 also requires at least one vegetable be served at lunch and supper. We need to fight the country's alarming rate of child obesity.
Currently there are no nutritional standards in licensed child care settings. My bill limits sugary cereals and french fries.
Moments ago, the CA Assembly passed my bill, AB 627, to strengthen child nutrition standards in CA's licensed child care facilities.
I'm celebrating my victories of the day. Check out my alter ego BrownleyFlak.
