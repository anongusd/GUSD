@badd1957 Illegal immigration is at about a 40-year low. Most illegals got here by overstaying their Visas. Most heroin comes thorough legal checkpoints.	The border needs extra personnel and better technology. But solutions  should not be rushed by putting a gun to innocent workers.
@badd1957 Yep.	But there have been several budget opportunities to add more border security into the budget. And the GOP had all three branches of government.		The problem with doing it now is in the timing. This was timed to use federal workers as leverage. Result: Workers w/o paychecks.
@badd1957 In December, the Senate voted 100-0 for a funding bill.	But, we now have the 116th Congress. So the House passed that same Senate bill word for word (now called a House bill).	So the Senate is sitting on the bill. But Trump promised to veto, so now the Senate won’t vote on it.

Couldn't have said it better myself-but I'll try. We can't ignore these atrocities simply because we can make profitable deals with the perpetrators. Money is not what makes America great.
