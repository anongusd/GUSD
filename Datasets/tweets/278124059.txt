Stunning. The President overruled the concerns of his Chief of Staff, his WH Counsel, the FBI, &amp; the CIA to grant his son-in-law access to our most sensitive national security secrets. Then the President &amp; his lawyer lied about it to the American people. https://t.co/4EzLCUuk4b
There is a lot of use of the phrase ‘rigged system’ these days. One of the systems that is truly rigged against consumers, workers, &amp; the American people is our current system of forced arbitration. When asked, 84% of Americans agree—we must #EndForcedArbitration. https://t.co/ZTiGTx33KZ
Forced arbitration is unfair, unjust, &amp; un-American. One of the fundamental principles of our democracy is that everyone gets their day in court.

And this is just the beginning. Cohen also told the House Committee that there are more Trump crimes under investigation by SDNY we don’t yet know about.
Cohen also testified that some of those reimbursement checks were signed by Donald Trump, Jr.—implicating Don Jr. in the ongoing Southern District of New York criminal case.
Cohen testified today that President Trump personally directed Cohen’s messaging to Congress, &amp; his lawyers reviewed &amp; edited Cohen’s statement—implicating Trump in a criminal conspiracy to commit perjury, making false statements, &amp; obstruction of justice.
These facts, if corroborated by other witnesses/docs, are completely damning &amp; overpowering in impact. If true, Cohen’s testimony reveals that the President of the United States has brazenly &amp; repeatedly violated the law &amp; lied to the American people.
There should no longer be doubt in anyone’s mind that collusion with Russia links directly to President Trump himself.
Per today’s testimony, Roger Stone, who was coordinating w/WikiLeaks, told Trump about releasing illegally hacked emails before it happened— &amp; before Trump made a plea for hackers to commit the crime again—implicating Trump in a conspiracy to violate Computer Fraud &amp; Abuse Act.
According to Cohen, Donald Trump, Jr. told President Trump about the June 9th Trump Tower meeting before it happened, &amp; Trump approved it—implicating the president in violations of federal campaign finance laws.
Cohen’s testimony is a bombshell. As set forth by him today, powerful &amp; compelling facts implicate President Trump in serious violations of the law.

I asked Barr whether he would at least allow Mueller to testify to Congress about his findings. He refused to commit. The American people deserve transparency. I’ll be voting no.
I am deeply concerned that Barr will do the President’s bidding &amp; put Trump’s interests ahead of the public’s interest.
Trump’s threats to derail or even obstruct the Russia investigation—as recently as the #SOTU—shows the need for full disclosure of findings &amp; evidence by the Special Counsel, which Barr has refused to commit to. I urge my colleagues to oppose him.
No commitment from AG nominee William Barr to disclose the Special Counsel report means he is likely to be Trump’s lawyer at DOJ, not the people’s lawyer.

If he really wanted to unify the country, he wouldn’t threaten to undermine women’s healthcare/reproductive rights, or falsely vilify women &amp; kids seeking asylum as they flee persecution. Actions speak louder than words. Trump’s actions betray his words tonight &amp; American values.
His call for an end to the Russia investigation is another effort to derail &amp; even obstruct or avoid any accountability for potential wrongdoing. That line shows all the more reason why the Special Counsel must release a report w/all the facts &amp; evidence directly to Americans.
This #SOTU speech was a tale of two countries. President Trump’s calls for unity seem deeply hollow &amp; empty when he appealed to policies that critically divide us. He wants to build more walls—not bridges.

For me, the issue of releasing the Special Counsel’s report is a defining &amp; definitive test of a larger question: will Mr. Barr be the people’s lawyer or the President’s lawyer? The answer is unclear &amp; that’s deeply concerning.
I disagree with William Barr on policy issues from women’s health care &amp; reproductive rights to criminal justice reform &amp; civil rights. And importantly: I disagree with his decision not to commit to releasing the Mueller report or comply with a subpoena to release the findings.

Reproductive health isn’t a political game for American women like it appears to be for Congressional Republicans. This vote should fail, &amp; Republicans in Congress should get back to doing the job their constituents actually sent them here to do &amp; open the government.
Rather than working to address today’s news that an unspeakable &amp;  apparently unknown number of children were ripped from their families at the border, the purported pro-life party is focused on permanently standing between low income women &amp; their right to access an abortion.
Rather than bringing up any of the numerous House-passed bills languishing before the Senate that could end this unnecessary shutdown, we are voting on a bill to ban abortion coverage.
This vote to block millions of American women from their constitutional right to access an abortion is yet another excuse for Republicans to put themselves exactly where they don’t belong—between a woman &amp; her right to control her own reproductive decisions.
Our bill makes a simple clarification to existing law—ensuring all federal employees are able to access unemployment benefits when they’re caught in the middle of a gov't shutdown. A missed paycheck is a missed paycheck, whether you are working without pay or furloughed.
Federal workers on the job &amp; unpaid deserve the same financial lifeline as furloughed workers. When I met air traffic controllers &amp; TSA officers they told me they aren’t able to access unemployment benefits because they’re going to work. This fundamental unfairness must be fixed.

Mueller investigation—seemingly far from done—now more endangered. Memo by AG nominee Barr disparaging Special Counsel, Rosenstein resignation &amp; more—all raise threat level.
Resigning Rosenstein requires reassurance: protecting the Special Counsel legislatively now more urgent than ever. AG nominee Barr must support it &amp; give specific commitments at next week's hearing.
President Trump’s continued reliance on falsehoods &amp; xenophobic anecdotes rather than facts are roadblocks to progress.
There’s a clear consensus that border security is necessary through better technology &amp; other resources. Let’s reopen the government &amp; have a real conversation about comprehensive immigration reform.
Far from forcing this issue to protect Americans, President Trump is seeking to protect his own ego &amp; pander to his base. Tonight, from the Oval Office, he fed us divisive &amp; distorted rhetoric, ignoring the reality that a wall is wasteful, ineffective, &amp; impractical.
The real crises here are of Donald Trump’s own making: dedicated public servants missing paychecks; taxpayers denied critical government services; economic hardship for small businesses &amp; low income Americans.
Tonight know your facts from the president’s spin &amp; lies. https://t.co/Ni2vrF2DSQ
Internal polling data is precious. It reveals your strengths— &amp; your weaknesses. Why share such valuable information with a foreign adversary—unless that adversary was really a friend? https://t.co/JF9J2Jgk57
More than 90% of Americans agree: No background check ➔ no sale. Proud to join @ChrisMurphyCT, @SenSchumer, @SenatorDurbin, @SenCortezMasto &amp; others to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a 1st step in advancing sensible measures to end America’s gun violence epidemic.
2. Did the Russian government use the polling data provided by Manafort to engage in their social media disinformation campaign, a criminal conspiracy, to get Trump elected?
Two big questions: 	1. Did a Russian intelligence operative get Trump’s campaign manager to shape the Republican party’s stance during the campaign to be more pro-Russian? (Remember that the RNC changed its position on Russia/Ukraine during the convention.)
Stunning information revealed in Manafort legal team’s improperly redacted filing: Manafort lied about discussing a Ukranian peace plan with suspected Russian intel operative, Kilimnik, met with him in Madrid in run up to the election, &amp; shared election polling data.
Walls closing in for Trump family. NY prosecutors, not just Mueller, on their case.
Trump allies &amp; sycophants will try to say these charges have nothing to do with collusion, but don’t be fooled: Veselnitskaya is a key player in connecting Trump to Russia, &amp; her indictment spells bad news for him. The next step is cooperation with SDNY &amp; Mueller prosecutors.
Another indictment from SDNY implicating Trump &amp; his closest aides. The President’s son, son-in-law, &amp; campaign manager tried to get “dirt” on Hillary Clinton from a confirmed agent of the Russian government who has now been indicted for obstruction of justice.
Indictment of this Russian agent recalls Trump Jr.’s vivid joy when she offered to meet with him to deliver dirt on Hillary Clinton: “I love it.” Now, that offer of “dirt” has become criminal quicksand for Trump Jr.
Indictment of Russian lawyer at infamous Trump Tower meeting portends peril for Trump Jr. &amp; Kushner—much more to come. https://t.co/HX4iq4WoSe
Background checks are a crucial step in the right direction. Moving forward I will continue working to pass other federal measures—like safe gun storage requirements &amp; red flag statute—that will better protect people in CT &amp; around the country.
Guns have no respect for state borders. Without an expanded national background check in place, the people of CT are at the mercy of states with more lax legislation. Passing the Background Check Expansion Act will make our state laws more effective protective measures.

Our bipartisan challenge now is to come together in support of our courageous national defense professionals &amp; avoid shockwaves of alarm.
That the President’s decision to withdraw all troops from Syria contributed to the resignation of this dedicated &amp; professional leader shows how deeply flawed &amp; dangerous it is.
Secretary Mattis’ resignation is deeply alarming—almost our worst nightmare. He leaves a chasm of leadership that could be destabilizing to national security policies &amp; morale.
In Secretary Mattis’ letter is the plea of a patriot put in an untenable position. It culminates a series of unacceptable decisions &amp; actions by Trump alienating our allies &amp; embracing our enemies, rejecting sound &amp; stable advice from top military, civilian, &amp; intel experts.
In an administration filled with self-enriching &amp; self-aggrandizing grifters, Secretary Mattis stood out as a model of patriotism &amp; public service. As a matter of national defense, but also personal integrity, he will be deeply missed across the political spectrum.
Anybody who thinks that putting the president’s patsy in charge of investigating the president is a good idea either didn’t ask the right questions or was provided the wrong answers. Americans deserve to know what happened.

Trump’s urging Comey to drop the Flynn investigation—going to the heart of potential obstruction of justice—was done to prevent Flynn’s eventual cooperation, which now includes 19 interviews with the Special Counsel.
Flynn spoke with senior officials on President Trump’s transition team to discuss what he should communicate to the Russian ambassador. The Special Counsel likely knows who these senior officials are and what legal consequences they face.
Michael Flynn admitted to deliberately lying to the FBI about his conversations w/Russian Ambassador Kislyak. If these discussions weren't nefarious, why did he lie to federal agents? This question, among others, is part of the puzzle Mueller is putting together.
How extraordinary: the President’s former National Security Advisor stood before federal court today &amp; admitted to a felony implicating our national security. He is cooperating w/federal prosecutors investigating the possible complicity of his old boss, the President of the U.S.
Fundamental to a plea agreement that results in leniency is admission of guilt &amp; taking responsibility for your own wrongdoing. Flynn’s attempt to walk it back was met with a harsh rebuke, &amp; rightly so.
Judge Sullivan’s warning to Flynn that moving forward with sentencing today may involve jail time sends a message: trying to play games with the court or downplay serious crimes is intolerable.
Extraordinary events today deepen Trump’s legal jeopardy because Flynn must tell all about what Trump did &amp; knew concerning contacts &amp; collusion with Russians.
Trump tried to stop the Flynn investigation, discredit the prosecution &amp; excuse criminal conduct because he fears what Flynn knows about him &amp; others in his orbit.
Judges are never potted plants in their courtroom. They impose real scrutiny &amp; demand real cooperation from defendants &amp; full truth from everyone. That’s what Judge Sullivan is doing here. https://t.co/VSYIurvWJQ
Thanks to Judge Sullivan for doing his job. No matter what agreement prosecutors &amp; a defendant may reach, a judge’s role—&amp; responsibility—is to assure that any sentencing deal serves the public interest. Hardly unprecedented.
Trump’s delusional campaign to discredit the Special Counsel’s prosecution of Flynn is shattered in court—by Flynn himself.  As important as Flynn’s admission of guilt, is his continuing cooperation.

After all that, it still took Trump two years &amp; the threat of actual oversight from the new Democratic majority in the House to fire him. Zinke leaves behind a shameful legacy of self-dealing &amp; corruption.
Zinke also met with Nevada friends of MGM to discuss a proposed CT casino, while refusing to meet with CT &amp; Tribal officials. After this meeting he then ignored his own staff’s recommendation &amp; clear legal precedent to stall the casino, thereby aiding MGM’s bottom line.
In less than two years in office, Zinke has already been the subject of 15 federal investigations. At least one was referred to the Justice Department, whose investigation must be allowed to continue.
Zinke repeatedly skirted agency policy to allow family, friends, &amp; guests, including fundraisers &amp; former donors, to benefit from taxpayer-funded travel.
Even in President Trump’s corrupt Cabinet, Secretary Zinke stood out. He oversaw the attempted rollback of critical protections for land, water, &amp; wildlife—including the Northeast Canyons &amp; Seamounts—all the while, cozying up to industry lobbyists &amp; donors. https://t.co/wMWqF13ZtV

The CURE High Drug Prices Act I introduced today w/@SenKamalaHarris, @SenJeffMerkley, @amyklobuchar will give the federal gov’t power to do more than ‘name &amp; shame’ pharmaceutical companies. HHS could turn back exploitative price increases &amp; better fend off Big Pharma’s greed.
High prescription prices are an unavoidable reality for many Americans. I applaud CT &amp; other states for taking action to stop generic drug companies' coordination to overcharge on antibiotics, blood-pressure medications, arthritis treatments, &amp; more. https://t.co/LdnxAN5BvM
Predatory pricing lets drug companies rake in money at the expense of Americans’ health. The price of EpiPens shouldn’t rise by 500% over 10 years nor the cost of insulin 2x from 2012-2016.

Cohen testified that “blind loyalty” to Trump “led me to choose darkness over light.” Powerful reminder that the President of the United States is implicated in a federal crime. This is just the beginning: Cohen’s cooperation with the Special Counsel may reveal even more.
Donald Trump’s long-time personal lawyer &amp; fixer was just sentenced by a federal judge to 3 years in prison, including for crimes that he committed in coordination with &amp; at the direction of the President of the United States.

As Trump becomes more desperate &amp; destructive &amp; potentially more damaging, the groundwork is being laid for the investigation to continue. Today, Mueller is planting the seeds that will live on &amp; ensure that no one is above the law.
We mustn't lose sight of the breadth of this investigation. From the NRA, adult actresses, real estate investments, illegal campaign coordination &amp; financing... the list goes on. Such a wide scope of serious accusations indicate something in the 2016 election doesn't add up.
By having other DOJ departments looking into Trump/Russia/2016, Mueller is able to 1.) take advantage of expertise in other offices 2.) ensure other legal entities, independent of the Special Counsel, will persist even if he were to be stymied, stifled, or shut down.
Butina’s decision to change her plea &amp; likely strike a deal with U.S. Attorney for D.C. is a reminder that Mueller has been delegating &amp; decentralizing his investigation—a smart move. A number of different DOJ components now work on elements of Russia’s 2016 interference.
As we mark 70 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we must continue to fight with determination &amp; dedication to ensure all humans have basic rights, equality, &amp; dignity that cannot be undercut or taken away. #StandUp4HumanRights

Epstein survivor Courtney Wild said, “He went after girls who he thought no one would listen to &amp; he was right.” Shame on our justice system for failing to prove Courtney wrong. It’s past time to take ALL survivors seriously.
Larry Nassar &amp; Epstein share a fundamental similarity: these sexual predators kept committing crimes &amp; avoiding accountability because powerful people &amp; institutions enabled &amp; protected them. While Nassar was sentenced 175 yrs for abusing athletes, Epstein was let off the hook.
Jeffrey Epstein is a despicable monster &amp; serial abuser who targeted &amp; assaulted at-risk girls. When he was finally caught, federal prosecutors, including the current Secretary of Labor, gave him a pass &amp; withheld information from the public instead of holding him accountable.

To ensure the Mueller probe can proceed without interference or obstruction, my colleagues &amp; I will be making the same demand of Barr. American liberty depends on a full, fair investigation.
During Watergate, AG Richardson promised the Senate that the special prosecutor would have “a truly unique level of independent authority” &amp; that he would only be removed for “extraordinary improprieties.” This pledge was key to the investigation's endurance &amp; success.
Even before confirmation proceedings for Barr, President Trump must immediately reverse his unconstitutional appointment of Matthew Whitaker, as my colleagues &amp; I have demanded in court.
Barr must firmly commit to protect the Special Counsel, operate independently of the WH, &amp; uphold the rule of law. The Senate must scrutinize this nominee, in light of comments suggesting he was more interested in currying favor with Trump than objectively analyzing law &amp; facts. https://t.co/yZbx31dZOv

Two roads diverged... Flynn took one (right), Manafort the other (wrong). And that has made all the difference (for them, and Trump). https://t.co/RcxQ0Lls1U
Questions still remain. Why did Flynn ask the Russians to hold off on retaliation to sanctions until Trump took office &amp; then lie about it to the FBI &amp; others? What did the Russians give the Trump campaign that they were going to treat them so favorably once Trump took office?
Manafort’s decision to try to play both sides looks even more futile— &amp; gives future witnesses &amp; cooperators a warning. Don’t try to pull one over Mueller. It won’t get past him.
With Flynn’s sentencing memo tonight, we now have 2 major players in Trump’s inner circle—his longtime personal lawyer &amp; fixer, Michael Cohen, &amp; his National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, providing substantial cooperation to Robert Mueller.
As the walls close in, deterring Trump’s destructive impulses is all the more important.

Tonight, we honor those who lost their lives &amp; stand as one with their congregation. Tomorrow, we must act.
This tragedy calls for more than a day of platitudes from politicians. They must summon the courage &amp; conviction to take action—action to fight gun violence &amp; bring people together.
We must speak out against hate &amp; violence. Hold accountable those who seek to divide us based on what we look like, where we come from, how we worship, who we love, &amp; which political party we belong to. That must be our resolve.
Common sense gun safety reforms would make an impact. Require universal background checks to keep people who are a danger to themselves or others from owning a firearm. Crack down on illegal gun purchases. Ban assault weapons.
But all that is needed for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. Our faith &amp; history teach us that injustice must be met with action.
There are no words to bring back the brave &amp; beautiful lives lost to this unspeakable hate crime. But we know—from Sandy Hook, Sutherland Springs, Oak Park, &amp; Charleston—that love, hope, &amp; faith always win.
Vitriol breeds violence. Hate speech breeds hate crimes. Demagoguery &amp; dehumanizing our political opponents, or those who don’t look like us, or worship differently must end. A day of platitudes from political leaders is no substitute for action against gun violence.
Today all Americans join these families who weep in grief &amp; horror. We must come together to stop this national epidemic of gun violence. People in power must take action.
Our hearts break &amp; stomachs turn after these shameful anti-Semitic murders. My thoughts are with the families &amp; brave law enforcement. Congress is complicit—by its inaction—in this loathsome epidemic of gun violence.

Hate speech on the suspect’s van is Exhibit A, combined with selection of targets, showing political motive in this terrorist attack. Anybody who conspired or aided him must be apprehended &amp; held accountable. The investigation must continue.

The Saudis are grasping for a consistent narrative — their contradictions defy common sense. This was a premeditated plan to assassinate Khashoggi, suppress free speech &amp; conceal the Crown Prince’s potential culpability in the murder.
American intelligence officials should review Turkish surveillance images, security footage, audio recordings &amp; all evidence related to the Khashoggi murder in support of an international investigation.
The findings—stomach-turning—show a meticulously planned, savage murder. Without doubt or delay, a full immediate international investigation is now needed to bring all Saudis to justice, at the highest levels, not just 18 fall guys.

As President, Trump seems to continue benefiting from the Saudis. According to @washingtonpost, a last-minute visit to NYC by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan enabled it to increase revenues in 2018 after 2 years of falling revenue.
Trump giving Saudis a pass on Khashoggi murder—maybe because he continues to benefit from Saudi rentals, hotel bookings &amp; other payments to the Trump Org? Saudi gov't payments violate our Constitution’s chief public corruption prohibition. Our lawsuit holds Trump accountable.

Any lawyer knows coordinating eyewitness accounts could constitute witness tampering. We don't know what Judge Kavanaugh said in the days before the New Yorker story broke, but it sure seems like something the FBI should've investigated, &amp; may explain misleading testimony.
Judge Kavanaugh told the Judiciary Committee under oath he never discussed Ms. Ramirez's allegations before the New Yorker article—now we know, from confirmed public reports, he asked friends to vouch for him before it was ever published.
One of my constituents went to the FBI with evidence that Judge Kavanaugh was in touch with the wife of an alleged eye witness regarding Ms. Ramirez’s allegations of sexual misconduct before the New Yorker story broke. The FBI never called her back.
The public testimony of Judge Kavanaugh &amp; Dr. Blasey Ford is no substitute for interviews with the FBI. Even the handpicked Republican prosecutor thought the process was faulty.
This FBI report is blatantly incomplete &amp; inadequate—straitjacketed by the White House. In a word, a cover-up.
Chairman Grassley said this partial report included no “whiff” of sexual misconduct. I can only conclude that he purposefully skipped the interview of Deborah Ramirez, who testified to the FBI under oath that Judge Kavanaugh assaulted her.
We won't stand for sexual assault survivors, like Dr. Blasey Ford, being silenced or mocked. Together we are making sure these brave women &amp; men are heard &amp; supported.

We should hear what these witnesses have to say for themselves publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what they remember of the Summer of 1982. In their own words. Right now we are missing this critical information.
One of the four witnesses Judge Kavanaugh kept on referring to as exonerating, Leland Keyser, has said publicly that she believes Dr. Blasey Ford.
Judge Kavanaugh kept repeating that four witnesses swore that Dr. Blasey Ford’s account “did not happen.” Not true. All we have are statements from their lawyers claiming that they have no knowledge of the night in question. That is not the same thing as it "did not happen.”
Republicans’ desperate attempt to distract from Dr. Blasey Ford’s powerful testimony by blaming Democrats is refuted by her own words: "All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public."

Tomorrow, I’ll be joining women— &amp; men—across the country during a national day of action calling for a serious, respectful response to these disturbing allegations of sexual assault. I am humbled &amp; proud to stand with them. I recommend my Republican colleagues listen.
Debbie Ramirez came forward to share her story even after seeing the nightmare of public shaming, character assassination, &amp; threats to personal safety endured by Dr. Blasey Ford. She is incredibly brave to face a near certainty of similar attacks.
The Senate simply cannot in good conscience vote on this nomination without a full fair FBI investigation of all these allegations— &amp; an opportunity for these sexual assault survivors to be heard.
The Senate needs to put aside petty politics &amp; pursue the full truth—that means a complete FBI investigation &amp; testimony from all relevant witnesses. Nothing less.
Dr. Blasey Ford is a profile in courage. She deserves to be heard &amp; treated with respect. America must listen.
Testimony on Thursday will test America’s conscience. https://t.co/10oYTaV2AX
No one should confuse support for that story with an endorsement or acceptance of this deeply broken process. I remain deeply disturbed by the conduct of my colleagues over the last week, &amp; am committed to ensuring that Dr. Ford’s safety &amp; security is made a top priority.
The nation should rally around her decision to speak truth to power. Dr. Ford’s sharing her story despite death threats &amp; vicious bullying speaks to the credibility of her allegations.
Courageously, Dr. Ford will tell her story in the face of an impossible choice &amp; vile bullying by Republican leadership. I will support her steadfast bravery against the arbitrary, unfair, irrational constraints set by Chairman Grassley.
Republicans show why sexual assault is still one of the most underreported crimes: courageous survivors who do come forward are bullied by those in power.
Republicans’ relentless, ruthless revictimizing must stop. Bullying deadlines must cease. This intimidation must be halted by Republicans speaking out. https://t.co/eReYpWTc7t
After spending the day in FBI interviews about death threats against her, Dr. Blasey deserves the minimal decency of 24 hours to make a decision about testifying. Rejecting her request would take the Senate to a shameful new low—a blatant abuse of power. https://t.co/6cBAWqSyVa
Republicans’ so-called “counter-offer” includes an arbitrary &amp; irrational deadline in a rush to silence a survivor. It has no basis in law or fact—or simple humanity.
The thinly disguised purpose of Republicans’ attempted intimidation of a sexual assault survivor can only be that they hope to avoid her testimony. The American people will rightly understand that Republicans fear her testimony because they fear the truth.
Today, I heard from the impressive doctors &amp; researchers at @YaleCancer. 	How important is the fight against tobacco &amp; nicotine in our push to end cancer? 		Remember: We can do our part by warning young people of tobacco &amp; nicotine's dangers. #BidenCancerSummit
Bullying a sexual assault victim into testifying in front of this committee before she is ready, without an FBI investigation &amp; while she is still getting death threats, is shameful &amp; shameless.
Republicans apparently decided it’s bad optics for 11 male senators—many of whom already judged Dr. Ford a liar—to question a survivor on live TV. Instead of personally facing her to ask questions, they are hiding behind a private lawyer whom they hired to do their jobs for them. https://t.co/EsIGF6umOD

A full, fair FBI investigation with sworn interviews, all relevant witnesses, &amp; review of all documents is needed before any hearing. Otherwise, we’re asking questions in the dark &amp; not doing justice by these charges.
My Republican colleagues have handled Dr. Ford’s serious accusations with dismissals &amp; attacks. These actions shamefully reinforces dangerous preconceptions that push survivors into silence.
By rushing to have a hearing about Kavanaugh’s attempted rape allegations, Republicans are only trying to check the box on oversight, &amp; not find the truth.

Only a full, fair FBI investigation, including sworn interviews with all relevant witnesses &amp; review of all documents, is an acceptable next step. It must precede any staff interviews or any possible additional hearings.
To Ms. Ford, &amp; to all survivors: you are not alone.
I’m dismayed by Republican dismissals of a sexual assault &amp; denigration of a survivor. Calling an assault a political ploy &amp; mocking Ms. Ford's wish for confidentiality reinforces dangerous preconceptions that shame&amp;silence survivors. These comments are despicable&amp;deeply harmful.
Ms. Ford has shown incredible bravery in coming forward. Now that she has made her story public, I am committed to ensuring that she is heard, that her safety is protected, &amp; that she is treated with respect.

Nothing successful about 3,000 deaths. The Trump Admin’s response in PR was &amp; remains a disgrace.

Susanne Lyons represents the corrupt culture at USOC that continually prioritized medal counts over athlete safety. How can we take USOC’s promises of change seriously with this kind of move?

More questions than answers—about seemingly misleading testimony from Brett Kavanaugh—that require full document disclosure &amp; another hearing. Senators who vote on this record, with more holes than Swiss cheese, will be condemned by history. https://t.co/aKvhFJtGFE
Kavanaugh fails to show even Gorsuch’s minimal fortitude—to denounce attacks on judges as “disheartening” &amp; “demoralizing.” He gives a green light to Trump’s gutter assault on our independent judiciary.
No backbone against Trump’s bullying—Kavanaugh’s failure to stand up to Trump’s venal attacks on Justice Ginsburg show abject absence of judicial independence. https://t.co/YtNr4QzQG3
“Abortion on-demand”; “existing precedent”; “abortion inducing drugs”—Kavanaugh’s bullhorn bumper stickers clearly signal his intent: to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Kavanaugh, in referring to Roe v. Wade in 2003, said #SCOTUS “can always overrule its precedent.” Last week he refused to commit otherwise. What more revelations are Republicans hiding in 100,000 concealed documents? Senate must reject this decisive 5th vote to roll back Roe. https://t.co/JBLI77Z4Oy

The President of the United States has been implicated in a criminal plot to violate campaign finance laws &amp; influence the outcome of an election. Under no circumstances should we be considering his nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in just one week.
After bombshell convictions of key Trump cohorts—&amp; identification of President Trump as an unnamed, unidicted co-conspirator—Judiciary Committee must postpone Kavanaugh nomination hearing.
Today we have learned a lot from @facebook &amp; @Microsoft about foreign interference from Russia &amp; Iran. The American public has a right to know what’s happening—the administration should be more transparent on threats to the midterms.

The loose talk about possible pardons should end now. For the President to pardon either Manafort or Cohen would be reprehensible &amp; irresponsible—an abuse of power, &amp; possible obstruction of justice.
After this powerful verdict, the President’s attacks seem increasingly desperate &amp; dishonest—reflecting an ongoing effort to obstruct the Special Counsel investigation.
The Mueller legal team’s abundance of evidence was on full display in this first major test in the courtroom. The Mueller team will now continue following the facts—&amp; the money—as this investigation circles ever closer to the Oval Office.
No one is above the law—not Manafort &amp; not his former boss, Donald Trump. Not a witch hunt or hoax, this milestone verdict is a message: the Special Counsel is for real—getting results through real facts &amp; evidence compelling to a jury of Americans.
White House looks increasingly like a criminal enterprise with the convictions today of President Trump’s former campaign manager &amp; personal lawyer— &amp; the inclusion of the President as an unnamed, unindicted co-conspirator in the Cohen plea agreement.
A legal &amp; political bombshell. The Michael Cohen plea agreement names a “candidate for federal office” who directed him to violate campaign finance law. There is no other reading: President Trump is an unindicted criminal co-conspirator.

Putin must turn over spies for trial in this country. Relying on Russian justice system is a non-starter.
American Presidents take an oath to defend the United States against all enemies, foreign or domestic. President Trump unequivocally failed to defend the United States today when he refused to hold Russia accountable for aggression.
Putin is a KGB thug who ordered this attack &amp; only understands action. Not words.
All of the words from Putin &amp; Trump today are meaningless or worse without strong action to deter &amp; stop continuing Russian attacks documented in stunning detail by the Special Counsel’s indictment of Russian spies.
America needs to hit back – hit back hard – on Russian cyberattacks on our democracy. We must act with our allies, not trash &amp; demean them. Now more than ever, NATO matters.
President Trump’s priority seems to be protecting himself over protecting the nation. There is no other explanation for siding with Putin over his own intelligence agencies &amp; continuing to denounce the Special Counsel investigation.
When Trump says “Putin was extremely strong &amp; powerful in his denial,” he apparently believes Putin over his own intelligence agencies &amp; DOJ. Reprehensible &amp; irresponsible

The moment it acquired Time Warner, AT&amp;T showed its true face&amp;raised prices for consumers. I support DOJ’s decision to appeal a ruling that threatens an era of anti-consumer mega mergers.

As a former federal prosecutor myself, I know the incredible power&amp;responsibility that comes w/this role. Prosecutors have the ability to take away someone’s liberty. Overseeing 448 federal prosecutors requires extensive experience&amp;judgment. Benczowksi doesn’t have it.
Even if Benczowksi didn’t have such disturbing Russian connections, he’d still be completely unfit to oversee the DOJ’s Criminal Division. He’s never served as a prosecutor and what courtroom experience he does have is minimal.
Benczowksi has bafflingly refused to recuse himself from any oversight of the Mueller investigation, despite his significant ties to a major Russian bank&amp;stated support for the firing of Jim Comey.
🚨The Senate is minutes away from voting on a nominee to be the third-ranking official at DOJ. Ben Benczowksi is not only wildly unqualified, he represents yet another Trump administration official with alarming, unexplained links to Russia. 🚨

Approval of this nominee wld mean the crucial swing vote to destroy hard-won rights&amp;liberties enshrined in long established law - and to take the nation back to a dark time when abortion was criminalized, when women died&amp;were denied access to contraception&amp;the morning after pill.
No other president has set such a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees. No other president has allowed himself to be a puppet of extreme right-wing outside organizations, or outsourced the selection to such fringe groups as the Federalist Society.
Judge Kavanaugh’s record&amp;writings signal an extreme hostility to the precious rights&amp;liberties that make our nation great. He's passed the Trump litmus test – screened&amp;vetted by extreme right-wing groups that have made this president their puppet.

Children will experience many of the same lasting traumas that they do now&amp;the world will continue to watch the spectacle of the American government locking up innocent children and throwing away the key.
President Trump's current policies - as articulated in this Executive Order - will put children behind bars indefinitely&amp;indiscriminately. That is intolerable in a free and democratic society.
Family separation cannot be replaced by family incarceration&amp;imprisonment.

Don’t be defrauded or fooled tomorrow when the DOJ IG report comes out. Look at the facts.
The more President Trump tries to use tomorrow’s report to claim FBI bias, the more ridiculous his supposed justification for firing FBI Director Jim Comey looks. (As if it ever passed the laugh test to begin with.) He said it himself: it was “this Russia thing.”
President Trump’s allies will try to convince the American public somehow that the FBI’s decision to release information about the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server but hide what they knew about his ties to Russia…somehow makes him the victim? What?!
I’m calling it now: no matter what the DOJ IG report actually says, President Trump’s sycophantic supporters will try to claim that somehow he is the victim of FBI wrongdoing&amp;bias. Talk about fake news.
Spoiler alert: President Trump’s cronies have already readied their talking points to exaggerate&amp;distort the facts of tomorrow’s DOJ IG report and spin them into a false narrative about the Special Counsel investigation.
Special Counsel filing asserting that Russia will interfere in this year’s midterm elections backs up what we’ve been hearing from U.S. intelligence for months: the Russians attacked our democracy in 2016&amp;they’ll do it again in 2018 unless we take immediate action to prevent it.
Today, the DOJ told me “we have to find ways to raise costs of malicious and malign behavior by foreign states” when I asked about Russian interference in the 2018 midterms. I agree: the Russians need to pay a price for past meddling to prevent future attacks on our democracy.
Filing today by Special Counsel seeks to protect investigation against possible continuing Russian interference. Judiciary Committee witnesses conceded it will happen, if Russians pay no price. https://t.co/ZB6r0wtoSF

Only in a two-bit tin horn totalitarian dictatorship could the President even consider pardoning himself from all accountability. It's unthinkable in this great country, and already legally indisputable.
That statement was short, but it sure wasn’t accurate - it was a lie meant to cover up the truth about meetings between President Trump’s top campaign advisers and Russian operatives peddling damaging information about his political opponent.
After months of denials, stunningly clear admission that President Trump dictated the misleading statement his son gave about meeting w/Russian agents during the campaign.
The President’s lawyers contend that having him testify “demeans the office.” No. This President’s actions demean the office, and this absurd assertion demeans our entire system of law.
Special Counsel cannot be dissuaded or deterred from subpoenaing President Trump by lawyers' fallacious, farcical memo. Uncover the truth. Follow the facts and law.
The legal assertions in this document are no longer laughable - they are terrifying to anyone who believes in the rule of law.
President Trump’s lawyers cite out-of-date statutes, magical legal thinking&amp;unconstitutional assumptions, but ignore this core truth: no one is above the law.

President Trump has proposed/issued pardons for illegal campaign donations, obstruction of justice, public corruption&amp;lying to federal investigators. Does that list sound familiar? It should – it’s the same crimes Trump allies Flynn, Manafort&amp;Cohen are on the hook for.

What is the Foreign Emoluments Clause? Before the President receives any gifts, payments, or benefits from foreign governments he must first receive the consent of Congress. Pretty simple, right? Not for this President.
President Trump has repeatedly&amp;flagrantly violated the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause. He has thumbed his nose at its plain text, and in doing so, thumbed his nose at the American people as well.
One week out from oral arguments in our case to compel the President to obey the Constitution of the United States. We’re seeking to hold President Trump accountable for violating the Foreign Emoluments Clause – the Constitution’s preeminent anti-corruption provision.

Commissioner Gottlieb, I welcome your commitment to work w/Congress to protect consumers from drug shortages – whether they occur at the pharmacy or in a hospital. I’m eager to work w/FDA to ensure that critical drugs are available to patients&amp;providers when they need them.
Drug shortages are a serious – sometimes deadly – problem. I’ve frequently called on FDA to take aggressive action to protect consumers from drug shortages, no matter what the cause – natural disasters like Hurricane Maria or manufacturing delays. https://t.co/xkKTEcX2be

The review of highly classified documents in the midst of a highly charged partisan conflict raises the clear&amp;present danger of illegal disclosure potentially catastrophic to confidential sources and operations.
President Trump put DAG Rosenstein in an impossible situation, forcing him to choose between a face-saving compromise and a destructive confrontation threatening continued progress by the Special Counsel.
Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has sought to manipulate DOJ to pursue his own personal vendettas. Once again, the President is attempting to use the power and influence of his office to put himself above the law.
This calculated, coordinated strategy is the last resort of many criminal defendants: when an investigation has you cornered, attack the investigators.
President Trump&amp;his surrogates are weaponizing false claims against DOJ&amp;law enforcement. Their purpose is to discredit the Special Counsel's investigation of the President himself.

By tearing up the #IranDeal, Pres. Trump has squandered a historic chance to strengthen the agreement with enhanced limits and sanctions – trashing instead of tightening it – and eroding our position in stopping a nuclear-armed North Korea.

Trump should be listening to young reformers, not mindless NRA applause for a senseless speech. He's on the wrong side of history, and the wrong side of the American people.
Regardless of Trump's pandering to the NRA, young people are championing a new social change movement to end gun violence - sweeping the nation and saying "our blood, your hands."
Pres. Trump squandered a golden opportunity to call for commonsense solutions to the gun violence ravaging America – instead trotting out more tired talking points and appalling excuses. This is what moral bankruptcy looks like.
While Pres. Trump doubles down to the NRA, we redouble our fight for commonsense reforms - universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders &amp; bans on assault weapons/high-capacity magazines.
Pres. Trump would rather stand with the NRA - and cheer Congressional complicity in gun violence - than survivors &amp; loved ones demanding action. His fatal fidelity to the gun lobby is despicable.
After chastising fellow Republicans for fearing the NRA, Pres. Trump parrots their tired talking points to rapturous applause. A profile in cowardice that should outrage every American.
If Pres. Trump truly wanted to confront gun violence, he'd use his NRA address to call for the commonsense reforms Americans want to see. I’m not holding my breath.

Glad to see @NTSB launch immediate investigation into #Southwest engine failure. We need to determine whether other planes are at risk – because no passenger should have to experience this nightmare.
Deeply troubled by the tragic loss of life aboard a #Southwest flight today. Thankful for the quick action of pilots and first responders on the ground in Philadelphia.

Sanctions must be enforced to be effective. The White House needs to recognize this and respond with coherent, consistent strategy.
What will it take for Pres. Trump to punish Russian complicity in Assad’s mass murder? Refusal to do so is inexplicable – and indefensible.
Absolutely outrageous. Trump’s slapdash sanctions strategy emboldens our foes and diminishes America. https://t.co/MN9GCxKbHL
No more silence. At this critical moment – one Trump tweet from Constitutional crisis – my GOP colleagues must speak out in defense of Mueller, Rosenstein, and rule of law. Democracy depends on it. https://t.co/lt6TFLIlBU
Look forward to your thoughts and questions at tomorrow’s #NetNeutrality Town Hall with @JRosenworcel - 2pm at Goodwin College Auditorium in #EastHartford. I’ll make sure my colleagues in Washington hear your concerns loud and clear. https://t.co/p0DuqJisD1
The Trump Admin has essentially slammed the door in the face of refugees fleeing Assad’s vicious rule. Turning our back on children &amp; families seeking refuge is a shameful affront to American values.
An effective response to the crisis in Syria cannot just be a military one - what remains lacking are robust diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian efforts.
Assad should be held accountable -  tried and convicted of war crimes. His Russian and Iranian enablers should be held responsible as well.
A military response to Assad’s brutal use of chemical weapons was well-merited, but Pres. Trump must come to Congress and set forth a consistent strategic path forward.
Syria strike still lacks a coherent strategy - sending a message without real effect on Assad’s war capability.
Hope you’ll join me and FCC Commissioner @JRosenworcel in #EastHartford this Sunday (4/15) for a Town Hall on #NetNeutrality - the foundation of our free and open internet. https://t.co/CSH6jrxfLh

By making proven drug take-back programs available to more Americans, we can stop opioid misuse and diversion in its tracks and save lives. That’s why I’ll fight for the AIDD Act.
Proud to work with @SenJoniErnst and @ChuckGrassley on the Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act, which would encourage safe disposal of unwanted drugs by incentivizing pharmacies and other locations to establish take-back programs.
For too many Americans, the path to addiction starts at the medicine cabinet. Unused drugs can end up causing unexpected harm – in part due to a lack of participation in critical take-back programs.

Facebook’s efforts to combat sex trafficking - including its support of #SESTA - show what we can achieve by facing tough challenges together. Zuckerberg needs to bring that approach to protecting consumer privacy.
Facebook’s failure to protect users after being provided this app’s terms and conditions is strong evidence that the company recklessly violated FTC’s consent decree.
Zuckerberg admitted at today’s hearing that no one on Facebook's app review team was held accountable for approving the app used to sell user data to Cambridge Analytica. Wondering why not? So am I.
More apologies from Mark Zuckerberg won’t fix Facebook. We need accountability and action – not vague commitments to do better while continuing to profit off of users’ personal data. https://t.co/qaKAYLj3VE

Joined NPR’s @MorningEdition to discuss the latest in Syria and tomorrow’s high-stakes hearing with Mark Zuckerberg. Listen here: https://t.co/PTYaArYzdN
Latest atrocity - an unspeakable chemical attack on his own people - shows Assad to be truly a war criminal. He should be prosecuted, in absentia if necessary.
Humanitarian aid must be unfrozen - some of $200 million suspended by Trump - to aid Syrian victims of this heinous, inhumane chemical attack.
If Pres. Trump truly wants to lead, he can start by standing up to Russia and ending the freeze he placed on $200 million in Syria relief funds Congress provided. https://t.co/5wWMyEwpkV
We cannot avert our eyes. Time to confront this horrific crisis with action to hold Assad - as well as Russian &amp; Iranian enablers - accountable for barbaric brutality.
Time for real leadership from Trump. More than merely words, action is necessary to hold Russia, as well as Syria &amp; Iran, accountable. https://t.co/YqiKmkBUIg
At gun violence Town Halls across America, students are speaking out and showing the way to commonsense change. It’s time my colleagues listen - we work for them, not the gun lobby.

Tiptoeing toward transparency is not good enough. Fulsome, broad reform - imposing full disclosure and screening -  is necessary to restore trust and meet Facebook’s responsibility. https://t.co/U4iFOiEwrV
Trump bribes to judges in effect flout the Constitution - showing more clear contempt for the rule of law. Judiciary Committee oversight necessary. 	https://t.co/q7pgIx24D7
Rosenstein refusal to release Special Counsel reports would ignite a Constitutional conflagration. Only full disclosure can avoid this looming firestorm.

#SESTA will make a huge difference, but truly stamping out the scourge of sex trafficking will take more than legislation. Encouraging to see companies like @UPS doing their part.

Facebook’s betrayal of privacy rights is almost certainly a gross violation of its FTC consent decree, requiring immediate and vigorous action. FTC must show wronged consumers its mettle and seek meaningful monetary damages and other remedies. https://t.co/QRkLUpxLbV
Next week’s Commerce/Judiciary joint hearing is a good first step toward instituting some vitally necessary rules of the road for Big Tech - something that can and ought to be a bipartisan priority.
Glad Zuckerberg has agreed to face the music. His company has shamelessly shredded its users’ privacy rights- just today admitting that the personal data of most of its 2 billion users had been compromised by “malicious actors” over the last several years. https://t.co/15HPNK3yjG
Facebook is devaluing its own currency: its business model is to sell personal info without users' knowledge or consent. Its betrayal of trust, sabotaging privacy protection, squanders the coin of its realm.
High noon for Facebook - and Big Tech. A reckoning moment for privacy protection. Whose side are they on?
Facebook shamelessly shredded privacy rights through its failure to protect users. Rigorous rules of the road - vigorously enforced - are vital, now. Mark Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs must be subpoenaed for documents. https://t.co/QRkLUpxLbV
Today’s stunning new disclosure further demonstrates how important it is for Zuckerberg to answer questions before the Senate - and the American people.
An astonishing escalation in the number of users impacted by Cambridge Analytica’s deceptive data collection – raising new questions about Facebook’s failure to act for so long. https://t.co/37rZojfIUg

Swirling reports heighten concern, requiring Congress to send a clear message: Firing Mueller will not be tolerated by DOJ leaders or the American people.
DOJ officials in line of succession – who Trump could order to fire Mueller – must get on the record now. Tell America you will not constrain Mueller’s ability to follow facts and law.
Trump threats becoming more erratic and extreme as Special Counsel comes closer - requiring public pledges from top DOJ officials that they will refuse orders to fire Mueller. Saturday Night Massacre now looming larger.
High alert to Congress: As Special Counsel nears Oval Office, DOJ leaders should go on the record now in defense of the rule of law. Let Mueller follow the facts wherever they lead.
Pres. Trump tried to fire Mueller last June. We must be ready if he tries again. That’s why I’m urging DOJ leadership to pledge – publicly – that they will refuse any White House order to stymie or stop the investigation.

In today’s hyperpartisan climate, we can take nothing for granted. DOJ leadership need to affirm that they will uphold their oaths and defend the rule of law from White House interference.
The DOJ officials overseeing the Special Counsel probe must publicly assure America that they will refuse any order or request – express or implied – to fire Mueller or impede his investigation. https://t.co/CP4eLtAU0P

Another impulsive, distracting Trump threat that he's dramatically abandoning - this one to veto the #Omnibus budget deal. More chaos and confusion, not leadership.
Bolton paid Cambridge Analytica $1.2 million for Facebook data. He should be investigated by FEC, not welcome in the White House. https://t.co/lhUleTL4nO
Like Flynn before him, Bolton has accepted foreign secret speaking fees – that he must disclose and answer for.
This chaotic White House does not need another temperamentally unfit employee with troubling conflicts of interest in his past. Pres. Trump ought to rescind Bolton’s appointment now.
John Bolton’s poor judgment and record of reckless right-wing warmongering should disqualify him from any White House role, much less National Security Advisor.
Pres. Trump needs to drop his wildly reckless veto threats and sign the #Omnibus bill right now. Americans deserve leadership from the White House, not more self-inflicted chaos.
The #Omnibus legislation is not perfect, but it represents a significant investment in businesses and job growth across our state.
Connecticut will benefit from the #Omnibus bill's significant investments in defense spending, bolstering our transportation network, and real resources to fight the #OpioidCrisis.
The #Omnibus bill is the result of real bipartisan compromise, and serves as a testament to what we can accomplish when we work together.

Congressional subpoenas necessary to obtain all relevant documents detailing Facebook’s abysmal failure to safeguard users’ private info. Zuckerberg and his team are not above the law.
Zuckerberg must come clean. Tell the public how Cambridge Analytica was permitted to retain personal data – and what measures will be instituted to forestall future breaches. The buck stops with him.

#SESTA could not have happened without the steadfast support of survivors, loved ones, and advocates. Your faces and voices powered this long-overdue reform across the finish line.
No longer will outdated laws allow enablers of horrific human trafficking to evade justice. #SESTA’s passage is a well-deserved victory for survivors, families, and the rule of law.
Backed by a wide coalition of advocates, law enforcement, and tech companies, #SESTA swings open the courthouse doors – allowing survivors to hold online facilitators like Backpage accountable.
Thrilled to see the Senate overwhelmingly pass #SESTA, my bipartisan bill w/ @SenRobPortman that will curb sex trafficking by opening a path to justice for survivors.
Thanks @SenDougJones for using your first Senate Floor speech to highlight some of the steps Congress can take to curb gun violence, such as Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation. We must confront the mass slaughter unfolding across America every day.
We must prevent more young Americans – the target demographic for new products like flavored e-cigarettes – from being lured into addiction by Big Tobacco’s marketing tactics.

FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info - now a hollow promise.
Congress should explore links between Cambridge Analytica and Russian state interests. Misuse of Facebook data by Russians attacking us?
Angry consumers should demand Facebook institute reforms to prevent release of private data to predators and political operatives. Congress should investigate.
Facebook must take responsibility and reform procedures for data release. Continuing threat to users - with continuing absence of oversight and transparency. Own it, not evade.
Facebook's failure to secure privacy of private data - that it released - seems a breach of trust and even law. Judiciary Committee should hold open hearings, with Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and others, under oath and in public.
Facebook executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, must explain at Judiciary Committee hearing why apparently absent or abysmal safeguards enabled shocking misuse of consumer data.
I agree with Sens. Graham and Leahy - Judiciary Committee hearing and inquiry on McCabe firing necessary ASAP. This bipartisan step and others are critical to protect against Trump threat to Special Counsel. https://t.co/gzoj9enW9i

Firing McCabe threatens professional law enforcement with blatant political interference - a disservice to dedicated men and women of FBI and other agencies.
Firing McCabe - a possible witness to obstruction - exemplifies Pres. Trump’s total contempt for the rule of law. He will stop at nothing to undermine the Mueller investigation.
McCabe firing - a shot at Special Counsel - makes legislation protecting the investigation more vital than ever. Investigation putting Oval Office under siege - raising specter of more firings.
McCabe firing is an undisguised attack on Special Counsel investigation - attempting to undermine him as a witness. Added evidence of obstruction of justice. https://t.co/3cvhLlTJom

Congress must do its job now - so Mueller can keep doing his. We must pass legislation protecting him from possible Trump retaliation.
As the Special Counsel follows the facts into an area Pres. Trump views as off-limits, ensuring his ability to continue unimpeded has never been more critical.
Will Trump’s team follow in Nixon’s footsteps and risk a Constitutional crisis by failing to comply with subpoena for documents? It didn’t work out well for him.
Trump Organization documents could show evidence of obstruction or other serious crimes, which Mueller’s team is unlikely to ignore.
Days after House Intel Committee Republicans shamefully shut down their investigation, the Special Counsel continues his vitally important pursuit of the truth. https://t.co/vwBi5P8K4B
My heart is with all affected by the terrible tragedy this afternoon in Miami. Grateful for the prompt action of first responders on the scene.
This is not the sanctions package Congress passed. Absent a credible deterrent – which Trump continues to neglect – Russia will continue its information warfare and malign activities.

Sanctions’ reliance on Special Counsel indictment supports the credibility and legitimacy of his investigation and criminal charges. This is no witch hunt. https://t.co/GhYHwtCjqd

I’ll demand Pompeo do better defending State Dept. against Trump malign neglect. Trump’s hollowing out American diplomatic capacity - its budget, staffing, expertise - all undercut our national security.

Congress must meet the moment. Hear and heed the passion of young activists carrying signs like, “Our Blood, Your Hands.”
Americans want real gun violence reforms: universal background checks, high-capacity magazine bans, and federal Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation.
After overheated reality show rhetoric, Trump proposes anemic non-action. An irresponsible retreat, straight from the gun lobby playbook.
Rather than make good on his vow to confront the NRA, Pres. Trump’s plan borrows many of their favorite deceptive distractions.
As America clamors for real action on gun violence, Pres. Trump turns his back – and runs right into the gun lobby’s arms. A profile in cowardice. https://t.co/EBjiMwAcGD
With Presidential leadership appallingly absent, a groundswell of grassroots energy - led by students - must move Congress to take meaningful action on gun violence reform.
If Pres. Trump wants to prove that his priority is the American people and not the NRA, he should unequivocally support universal background checks, federal extreme risk protection orders, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Shamefully, the President couldn’t even summon the political courage to propose raising the age limit on firearm purchases - despite repeated promises to support such a step at a meeting with lawmakers.
The President seems to have received a permission slip from the NRA to back the Fix NICS and STOP School Violence Acts. While I proudly support both bills, they only scratch the surface of what’s needed to address our gun violence epidemic.
Arming teachers is an absolutely abhorrent response to school shootings - opposed by law enforcement, students, and educators alike.

When families see something and say something, law enforcement should be empowered to do something. My bill w/ @LindseyGrahamSC would enable them to step in and block dangerous individuals from accessing guns.
Constituents rightly ask: Why can’t Congress act to stop dangerous people from getting guns? With our Extreme Risk Protection Order bill, we can. Let’s get it done.

Special Counsel is no doubt focusing on Pres. Trump’s continuing efforts to stymie investigations of Russian interference, campaign collusion, and obstruction of justice – assembling a mosaic of evidence methodically and meticulously.
Trump’s reported conversations about Special Counsel interviews smack of witness tampering - further bolstering an already credible obstruction of justice case.

My bill with @LindseyGrahamSC is a proven step Congress can take today to stem the gun violence ravaging communities of all sizes. Let’s seize the moment and make progress now.
By keeping guns out of dangerous hands, Extreme Risk Protection Orders / #RedFlag laws prevent gun violence. Time to follow Connecticut’s example and take this law nationwide.
42% of mass shooters exhibited warning signs before committing their crimes. Think of the tragedies we might prevent with a federal #RedFlag law. That’s worth fighting for. https://t.co/UOURScriex
Extreme Risk Protection Orders – also called #RedFlag laws – empower loved ones and law enforcement to remove guns from individuals in crisis, before warning signs escalate into tragedies.
We need federal Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation to keep guns out of dangerous hands. This law saves lives in Connecticut and would make a major difference nationwide.

Thanks to all witnesses at today’s hearing for their brave testimony and steadfast dedication to gun safety reform. Your advocacy is putting progress within reach.
Family members and survivors – forever changed by unthinkable tragedy – know that we cannot combat this epidemic without strengthening gun laws. No more lethal inaction.
Poignant, powerful words from survivors and loved ones, incl. #SandyHook’s Francine Wheeler, at today’s gun violence prevention hearing. My colleagues must reject the gun lobby’s tired talking points and hear these voices of reason.
Instead of squeezing Americans with #TrumpTolls and piling up debt, we ought to make forward-thinking investments to fix crumbling #infrastructure. Our Democratic plan would do just that.

Congress can still act to provide the permanent status and path to citizenship #Dreamers deserve - and act we must. Our constituents and values demand it.
Despite agonizing legal limbo, #Dreamers continue to work hard, raise families, and better their communities. Their courageous example stands in stark contrast to Congress’s cowardice.
Hundreds of thousands of #DACA recipients, including many in CT, could soon lose their work permits and deportation protection - a direct result of lawmakers’ inaction and lacking leadership from the White House.
#Dreamers deserve far better than a President who pulled the rug out from under them - then disingenuously told them not to worry while rejecting every bipartisan effort to stop their mass deportation.
#Dreamers are awakening to a new level of chaos and confusion because neither Pres. Trump nor Congress could summon the leadership necessary to keep faith with them.
Today is the arbitrary deadline Pres. Trump gave lawmakers to pass a #DACA fix. Through its inexcusable inaction, Congress has failed #Dreamers - and vast majorities of Americans who want them shielded from mass deportation.

States like Connecticut can do a lot to protect their citizens, but guns don’t respect state borders. The federal government needs to step up with real action&amp;real resources.
The nation can build on the CT model: an assault weapons ban, investments in school security that respect local priorities&amp;measures like my effort w/ @LindseyGrahamSC to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.
Connecticut is proof that common sense gun safety laws and school safety measures save lives. We need more Connecticut common sense in Congress, not hare-brained pandering to the NRA.
Sadly, school safety is not a new topic—after Sandy Hook, I visited schools across CT to urge increased federal investment in school security. We’re still having these discussions, because while our state took action, Congress shamefully did nothing.

Both parties can agree: Someone who is an immediate threat to themselves or others shouldn’t have a gun. Congress has a duty to keep weapons of war from people in crisis. My bipartisan bill w/ @LindseyGrahamSC would do just that.
Proud to partner w/ @LindseyGrahamSC on federal “red flag” legislation. This bipartisan breakthrough – modeled on CT’s proven law – would enable law enforcement to stop individuals in crisis from accessing guns.
Right now, there is no federal process to remove guns from imminently dangerous individuals. @LindseyGrahamSC and I are teaming up to right this deadly wrong.

How deep is the White House’s indifference when it comes to protecting our nation’s secrets? Look no further than Kushner’s continued presence in the West Wing.
Each day Kushner remains at the White House is an affront to Americans who deserve a responsible government - and a reminder that “America First” was a hollow campaign line.
Even after his clearance downgrade, Kushner’s conflicts make him vulnerable to foreign pressure. The White House knows this – apparently, they just don’t care.
If Kushner worked in any other Administration, he’d have been fired months ago. Pres. Trump must demonstrate long-overdue leadership and ask him to leave now.
Last night, @WashingtonPost exposed foreign government efforts to manipulate Jared Kushner. Today, he went back to work for the President. This White House can’t even pretend to take its obligations seriously.

Talking to colleagues on both sides of the aisle about an Extreme Risk Protection Order bill to stop individuals in crisis from accessing deadly weapons - one of many straightforward steps we can and must take to protect Americans.
An Extreme Risk Protection Order law would give families or police the ability to stop someone from buying guns if a court says they are a danger to themselves or others - preventing a potential tragedy.
Encouraged by my colleagues’ support for federal Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation to keep weapons out of dangerous hands. CT has shown these laws work.
We cannot tolerate a system that lets enablers of sex trafficking slip by. Time to get #SESTA across the finish line and provide survivors a path to justice.
Survivors of sex trafficking have waited too long for justice. My #SESTA bill with @SenRobPortman would open the courthouse doors to them – and bring accountability to facilitators like Backpage.
Last night the House voted to empower sex trafficking survivors and hold online enablers of this unthinkable crime accountable. The Senate should pass #SESTA and do the same.
A senior White House official vulnerable to manipulation by foreign governments - exactly what the security clearance process is designed to avoid. https://t.co/b2pkdr6Wcy
Today’s action is no substitute for substantive responses to the series of questions I have put to the White House about the unknown number of high-level officials who have been operating without permanent security clearances there.
Kushner clearance downgrade raises questions about his entanglements with countries like China and potential conflicts of interests while he holds significant foreign policy responsibilities at the White House.
Reminder: We still have no idea why Kushner could not obtain a permanent security clearance – or how many high-level White House officials have been working without one.
No reasonable justification for a yearlong policy that allowed people who may have very harmful secrets in their backgrounds to have access to America’s secrets.
This gives new meaning to the term “overdue.” Kushner had no business accessing highly sensitive, classified info for more than a year, and nothing done today can right that wrong. https://t.co/UxMIzKYwY8

Extreme Risk Protection Order laws like CT’s keep guns out of dangerous hands - thwarting tragedies before they begin. Congress should follow our lead.
A national version of Connecticut’s Extreme Risk Protection Order would help prevent gun violence and save lives. It deserves bipartisan backing.
If you’re an imminent danger to yourself or others, you shouldn’t be able to get a gun. That’s what CT’s Extreme Risk Protection Order - a national model - is all about.
I’ll be pushing new laws that enable courts to issue extreme risk orders - stopping imminently dangerous people from having guns. They work. CT has shown it.
Hopeful Pres. Trump will join my effort to expand on Connecticut’s example and ensure that people shown to be imminently dangerous to themselves or others don’t have access to guns.
Someone exhibiting warning signs that they are a danger to themselves or others should not have access to deadly weapons.
Connecticut’s Extreme Risk Protection Order is just one example of how our state leads the way on keeping guns from dangerous people. I’ll fight to take it nationwide.
Today is a good day for transparency – and an alarming reminder that the Trump White House is willing to engage in obstruction of justice in real time.
The memo released today provides bombshell revelations about the extent to which the White House &amp; its lackeys are willing to go to smear the Special Counsel &amp; FBI - thoroughly debunking the allegation that the Russia probe was borne of political motivations or wrongdoing.
No surprise that the White House originally placed a gag on making these facts public while allowing the release of the #NunesMemo’s cherry-picked narrative.

It is disgraceful that Republicans seem more willing to turn schools into free-fire zones than to make even a single concession to the NRA.
Trump’s cruel attack on Americans living with mental illness is a despicable red herring – especially from a President who has aggressively slashed mental health funding while in office.

Numbness cannot defeat our gun violence epidemic. Students - like the brave #Parkland survivors - show the path to long-overdue change. https://t.co/NLaX0ZgQ1L

Monstrously misguided Concealed Carry Reciprocity bill is DOA in Senate - a demise it richly deserves. It mocks gun violence victims and their loved ones.
Our #FixNICS bill would close information gaps in the background check database - helping keep guns away from dangerous buyers. Bipartisan support, now Trump support, overwhelming popular support - no excuse for continued delay.
So inspiring to see students standing up and speaking up - leading the nation by their courage and compassion. Thank you!
Trump words supporting our bipartisan #FixNICS bill must be backed by action. He must throw away the NRA playbook and break the gun lobby’s grip. Students showing the way.
My #FixNICS bill w/ @JohnCornyn and @ChrisMurphyCT - a breakthrough bipartisan compromise - would bolster background checks and save lives. Congress can and must pass now - without attaching dangerous non starters like concealed carry reciprocity.  https://t.co/3lDjfjkYGd
Trump background check loopholes will lead to more mass slaughter. His funding cuts would enable more dangerous people to buy more guns. My Republican colleagues must stand up &amp; speak out. https://t.co/Wm6vNDoNyK
More than mouthing empty words, thoughts and prayers, and mocking thumbs up, Pres. Trump must act. It's Presidents’ Day tomorrow - time to lead.
Connecticut’s example should move Congress and Trump to back stricter gun violence prevention measures. They work. Sandy Hook families and survivors have shown the way. https://t.co/yum09CfEqC

As the Special Counsel investigation intensifies, so does the need to protect it from irresponsible, politically motivated attacks by the President’s Congressional surrogates.
Politically motivated, irresponsible attacks on the Special Counsel by Trump’s Capitol Hill sycophants soundly refuted by today’s Russian indictments.
The Special Counsel is proceeding with vigor and independence. He must continue to follow the facts and law wherever they lead, including possible collusion by Americans and obstruction of justice.
The Russian attackers were real criminals with real impacts that will continue to be repeated - as the intelligence community warned only days ago.
Pres. Trump has so far refused to apply any deterrents or even acknowledge the Russian criminal conspiracy so powerfully portrayed in these indictments. Americans should be alarmed and appalled, even if he denies reality.
Today’s criminal charges outline a terrifying blueprint of ongoing and future assaults – indisputably demonstrating the need for strong sanctions to make these Russians and their government pay a price.
Blockbuster indictments depict a massive, chilling Russian attack on our democracy - using sophisticated social media and complex fraud to derail elections, sow discord, and seek to distort the outcome. https://t.co/e5tm8cbXXI
For 150,000 students and countless faculty, gun violence like #Parkland is far from unthinkable. It's part of their lives. That terrifying truth should be all the impetus we need to confront this epidemic with action. https://t.co/gBSOx8CxXS
If Pres. Trump wants to “make a difference” as he said today, he can start by backing gun violence prevention reforms supported by wide majorities. No action = no change.
We don’t have higher mental illness rates in America, Mr. President – but we do have easier access to weapons of war. A ban on assault weapons won't stop every tragedy, but it will save lives.
Pres. Trump’s failure to recognize the need for reforms – proposing none in his remarks – risks more American lives. We need leadership, and we need it now.
Sympathies from Pres. Trump are important but insufficient. More than words, action needed now to confront gun violence and prevent future massacres.
Thankful for every American who has spoken out and demanded action to curb gun violence. Your voices of reason are needed now more than ever – and I will continue to amplify them in Washington.
We cannot accept a world where so many of America’s elected representatives put fidelity to the NRA over their constituents’ demands for action on gun violence.
Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook – now #Parkland. The list goes on, as does Congress's cowardly complicity. When will my colleagues put children’s lives ahead of the gun lobby's bottom line?
Congress is complicit in gun violence – a national scourge infecting communities of all sizes – each day it fails to act. Shame on my colleagues who would rather throw up their hands than confront this epidemic of mass slaughter.
Tragedies like #Parkland are not inevitable and they cannot deter us from demanding action on gun violence. We owe it to victims, loved ones and families to fight harder than ever before.
Pres. Trump seems to blame the community that just saw 17 of its children slaughtered - but America knows where the real failure to act lies. https://t.co/s3dJibNaDu
Behind each point is a grieving family forever wounded by the senseless scourge of gun violence. Every last one of them deserves action now – not excuses. https://t.co/DAWjtchtvJ
No security clearance for Rob Porter's replacement as Staff Secretary? Farcical, yes - but also deadly dangerous to national security.
The list grows - now more than 100 national security ticking time bombs lacking necessary clearance, putting secrets and sources in peril. If they can’t be cleared, fire them - or deny classified access.
White House must immediately answer for this inexcusable, infuriating report on security clearances – a slap in the face to Americans who expect and deserve responsible leadership.
Reckless and irresponsible that 100+ high-level White House staff w/o permanent clearances still have access to secret classified information. What skeletons make them susceptible to blackmail or other national security risks? https://t.co/tJtttcMEHi

Gun violence spares no communities. Its lethal toll often goes unpublicized. As America watches in horror, Congress can’t stand idly by. We must confront this scourge with urgent action.
Haunting, harrowing images from Parkland provoke an all too familiar stomach-churning feeling – a gut punch – as our national epidemic infects yet another school.
My heart breaks as Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School of Parkland, FL faces the unthinkable horror of gun violence – the 18th school shooting of 2018. When will Congress wake up? Enough is enough.
Closely following reports of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida – my thoughts are with the victims, loved ones, and all affected. Thankful for the swift action of courageous first responders on scene.
Great countries do not break their promises. Under #DACA, the United States promised #Dreamers protection for coming out of the shadows. We must keep our word now.
Imagine your whole life ripped away from you – your job, your home, your family – because of a choice you didn’t even make. That's the nightmare #Dreamers face right now, and Congress shouldn't tolerate it for another minute.
Pres. Trump's #DACA rescission and the resulting uncertainty won't stop Jonathan from fighting for what’s right. Deporting hardworking, dedicated #Dreamers like him would be shortsighted and senseless.
Jonathan Gonzalez-Cruz, brought here at age 4, saw his father deported. #DACA let him attend SCSU on a full scholarship and become an immigrant rights advocate – but uncertainty over his status has forced this bright leader to put his education on hold. https://t.co/yeJS3u9MCX
A nation of immigrants cannot forsake #Dreamers – who work hard, give back, and serve in our military. We must act now to shield them from draconian mass deportation.
This week, the Senate can vote to give #Dreamers – Americans in all but name – the future they deserve. Let’s seize the moment and #ProtectDreamers.
The headline says it all. Pres. Trump must drop his denials and listen to the Intelligence Community chiefs. Do your job – or nothing will stop Putin’s cronies from doing theirs. https://t.co/66zCvUqf2l
Intel Community heads agree Russian meddlers will return – but Pres. Trump continues to deny reality and disregard sanctions Congress passed 517-5. Americans are right to ask: Why?
Stunning and inexplicable that none of the Intel Community heads were consulted on #NunesMemo before White House recklessly released it – putting political vendettas ahead of national security.

White House must disclose to Congress 30 to 40 top-level Presidential staff who still have only interim security clearances - failed to be deemed trustworthy a full year into this Administration - yet given access to classified secret information.
Pres. Trump’s morally bankrupt budget should be dead on arrival in the Senate. We need forward-thinking leadership that reflects our values, not shameful political attacks masquerading as policy.
Here we go again. #TrumpBudget calls for repealing #ACA, even though doing so would leave millions uninsured. That alone should disqualify this disgraceful proposal.
Remember when Candidate Trump opposed Medicare cuts? President Trump’s budget slashes it by billions – betraying seniors and debasing his office.
Budgets reflect values. Pres. Trump's budget – brimming with broken promises, monstrous cuts to the social safety net, and wasteful wall spending – couldn't do a better job reflecting his.
Want to buy the Brooklyn Bridge? You’ll love the Trump #InfrastructurePlan. This sell off is a sellout – making America lesser and poorer, not great.
Trump #infrastructure privatization means selling off roads and bridges - selling out America to get-rich-quick schemers and secretive foreign buyers. This bad deal for America makes nothing great except corporate profits.
I'll fight for real and robust #infrastructure investment with a dedicated federal funding stream, not Trump’s smoke-and-mirrors scam.
Trump’s #infrastructure plan means sweeping corporate giveaways, fire sales of public assets, and new tolls across the country – enriching private interests at everyday Americans’ expense.
More for hedge funds than hard hats, Pres. Trump's #InfrastructurePlan relies on magical thinking, massive private interest profits, and a pittance of public investment.

As a prosecutor, I saw plenty of defense teams try to put the government on trial. Now, the nation sees Trump’s Capitol Hill lackeys using this well-worn tactic against the FBI/DOJ - with bogus memos and public attacks.

The White House may be "saddened” but the rest of us are shocked and stunned. This Administration is apparently oblivious to the national security threat posed by a broken clearance process.
An accused domestic abuser had access to America’s secrets - vulnerable to blackmail and without a background check or security clearance.
Chilling lapses in security and background clearance process shown by Rob Porter’s access to classified info. White House indifference, on full display at today’s press briefing, should outrage and frighten everyone.

My colleagues cannot remain silent as we careen toward a Constitutional crisis. Judiciary Committee must approve and Congress must pass legislation to #ProtectMueller and #DefendOurDemocracy.
If President Trump refuses to talk with the Special Counsel, he should be subpoenaed to the grand jury and forced to testify under threat of contempt. No one is above the law, not even the President.
It is irresponsible for the commander-in-chief to undermine national security by attacking the FBI and Intel Community – and shameful for his sycophants on Capitol Hill to amplify those attacks.
From pressuring and then firing Comey to trying to fire Mueller to the White House reportedly participating in #NunesMemo, Trump has acted repeatedly in an effort to make the investigation into his wrongdoing go away. That is obstruction of justice, and it is a crime.
There is irrefutably a credible obstruction of justice case against President Trump. That should scare all Americans, whatever your politics.
Despite our government’s unanimous assessment, President Trump refuses to recognize the reality of Russian meddling. Americans are right to ask: What is he trying to hide?

#NunesMemo release is a stunning, sobering turning point in Trump vendetta on law enforcement and intel community. Now more than ever, Congress must unite and pass legislation to #ProtectMueller.
Pres. Trump has spent months deriding the Mueller investigation as a partisan “witch hunt.” Today, his Capitol Hill lackeys have shown us what a real witch hunt looks like.
#NunesMemo regurgitates now well-worn and widely discredited Republican talking points - recalling dark days of McCarthy-era character assassination.
This transparent ploy – clearly intended to provide pretext for undermining Deputy AG and Special Counsel – is gutter politics at its absolute worst.
By allowing #NunesMemo’s release, Pres. Trump made clear once and for all that in his White House, self-interest supersedes our national security interest. That should infuriate every American. https://t.co/laCNWpt0dz
Stopped by @morning_joe to discuss the White House’s desperate, dangerous attempt to weaponize the #NunesMemo against the Special Counsel &amp; FBI. Watch here if you missed it: https://t.co/azNUC9anXo
History will condemn complicit Republicans who stood silent as their colleagues impugned intelligence agencies, celebrated character assassination, and undercut the rule of law to score political points.
How can intel agencies now confidently share material with Congressional committees? Republicans’ political charade risks irreparable harm to America’s security – all to shield Trump.
If transparency was the goal, House Intel Republicans wouldn’t have blocked Democrats’ memo - or rushed to release a doctored version of their memo w/o proper Committee vote and despite FBI/DOJ objections. What is transparent is the blatant partisanship driving this travesty.
The President’s own DOJ appointee and FBI director said it would be “extraordinarily reckless” and raise “grave concerns” to release #NunesMemo. That he would do so anyway shows the White House is politically weaponizing law enforcement and intelligence systems.
The #NunesMemo is a desperate bid by Trump &amp; Republicans to smear the Special Counsel. Trump reportedly said as much by telling associates that the memo will undermine Mueller's probe. Career public servants at the FBI will needlessly suffer from this brazen ploy.
Republicans must end this stunt - put the rule of law before shameful subservience to White House.

No mention of Russian interference - none - was a stunning, glaring gap. The President's own CIA Director today cited the continuing threat of Russian election meddling, but the President ignores it. His silence spoke volumes.
Sadly, Pres. Trump continued a hostage taking immigration policy by denying #Dreamers a path to citizenship without policies that rip apart families and terrorize immigrant communities. #SOTU
After the lofty rhetoric, tonight’s speech was mostly red meat partisan applause lines. There were vacuous promises but few specifics on issues like infrastructure, opioid addiction, veterans and other key priorities. #SOTU

Republicans’ motive for releasing the Nunes memo couldn’t be clearer: to discredit and degrade the FBI, DOJ, and Special Counsel at a time when their work could not be more vital.
Last night House Intel Committee Republicans voted to release a misleading, deceptive memo – an act of partisan gutter politics that impugns the integrity of law enforcement and threatens the intelligence community and national security.

Stunningly, while Russian-linked social media accounts aided and abetted their rash and reckless agenda, House Republicans remained completely silent – complicit in a foreign adversary’s ongoing attempts to undermine our law enforcement and national security.
House Republicans shredded crucial safeguards designed to protect our national security to continue levying baseless, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement.
President Trump’s own appointee at the Department of Justice has called this move “extraordinarily reckless.” It is a transparent political ploy – appallingly irresponsible and dangerous.

Instead of jeopardizing children’s lives and hobnobbing with billionaires, Trump should dump this plan and work with Congress to fix our broken immigration system.
The White House immigration plan is a dream come true for the far-right – and a nightmare for most everyone else.
This immigration plan disregards due process, sending refugee children back to deadly danger – subverting American values.
The party of “family values” seems to care more for its nativist political base than actual families facing cruel separation.
Repugnant Trump immigration plan holds #Dreamers hostage and orders draconian restrictions – while doubling down on wasteful wall funding. A non-starter in the Senate.

We have bipartisan consensus on #infrastructure investment. Pres. Trump needs to ditch this half-baked plan, seize the opportunity, and deliver for America.
There can be no red or blue when it comes to fortifying the transportation network that keeps America moving.
Pres. Trump’s mishmash of meaningless proposals makes no mention of the Highway Trust Fund – a cornerstone of #infrastructure funding at risk of insolvency.
Reversing longstanding state/federal funding formulas, this plan abdicates federal leadership in #infrastructure – pushing states like #Connecticut toward tolling and even selling off assets to raise revenue.
This #infrastructure proposal plans selling off federal assets – selling out America. It is a pathetic whimper when we need a visionary clarion call.
Pres. Trump’s supposed #infrastructure “plan” dangerously shortchanges #Connecticut’s vital road and rail networks – and all America’s needs.

The President must lead, or get out of the way – because he is wrong in seeking a “good shutdown.” There is no good shutdown. We must come together to end it.
I will continue to call for good faith negotiations, but only Senator McConnell can call these measures for a vote and end the self-inflicted crisis of the #TrumpShutdown
There is bipartisan consensus behind every single major issue before us: defense spending, funding for the opioid crisis and pensions, disaster relief, community health centers, the Children’s Health Insurance Program&amp;avoiding mass deportation of the Dreamers.
Governing month to month through short term extensions has the effect of a slow motion shutdown – short-changing and damaging our military, health care and opioid addiction programs, disaster relief, as well as protection of Dreamers.
Congress must do its job. Serious talks and compromise by the Republican leadership and the President could have avoided this self-inflicted crisis – and still can.
We’ve already waited months for a resolution on #DACA, robust disaster relief, and funds for health programs that millions rely on. Republicans need to end this embarrassing episode and get to work.
Americans see this self-inflicted, senseless dysfunction for what it is – and they know exactly who is at fault. Republicans should listen to their constituents and work to avert a #TrumpShutdown before it’s too late.
We owe this country real action on real problems – not another stopgap CR that ignores #DACA, Community Health Centers, disaster relief, and so much more. Time to negotiate on a bipartisan basis and avert a #TrumpShutdown.
Passing what would be the fourth short-term CR in as many months delays defense programs – we urgently need full year funding for national security, both military and non-military.
Republicans could have taken the bipartisan approach Americans want and deserve. Instead, they’re using kids’ healthcare as a bargaining chip, leaving #Dreamers in limbo, and pushing us toward a #TrumpShutdown. This is what failed leadership looks like.
Almost exactly one year ago, millions of Americans joined the Women’s March in support of shared values - including access to safe, affordable health care services. We stood together then, and we stand together now against this disgraceful assault on our Constitutional rights.
Today’s announcement comes on the heels of a separate attempt to let providers discriminate against patients in need of medical care for ideological reasons. Both efforts are a slap in the face to millions of American women and their families.
This action invites states to violate longstanding federal law that protects patients' ability to seek care from the provider of their choice - a thinly veiled, partisan assault on women &amp; families who seek care at Planned Parenthood and other providers. https://t.co/oDtseJoYE4
This shameful move is further evidence of the federal government’s disgraceful response to Puerto Ricans devastated by disaster. I demand @FEMA do the right thing and reverse course on its dangerous decision to pull the rug out from under displaced families.

There is no reason to deport Joel Colindres now, while US Citizenship and Immigration Services needs more time to properly adjudicate his application.
My heart breaks as Joel Colindres fights yet another cold, callous attempt to break apart his beautiful family. I am in close contact with the Colindres family and their attorney to support all efforts to keep Joel here in #Connecticut where he belongs.

We cannot grow desensitized. President Trump’s racist remarks – unworthy of the office he holds – demand outrage and outcry from Americans everywhere.
Trump’s racist remarks threaten our national security and diminish our standing around the world as a beacon of tolerance. He owes every single American an apology.
Connecticut and America are stronger because of hardworking immigrants – from all countries – who call this country home. We see Trump’s remarks for what they are: a brazen betrayal of American values.
President Trump’s remarks smack of blatant racism – odious and insidious racism masquerading poorly as immigration policy. He does not speak for me as an American.
#HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay reminds us of our shared obligation to deliver accountability for perpetrators of trafficking – and justice for victims and survivors. Inaction in the face of these heinous crimes is intolerable.
As long as the government fails to disclose data that could lead to the prosecution of human traffickers, it will remain a silent partner in this unconscionable scourge. Our bill will bring much-needed transparency and accountability.
Proud to introduce the Visa Transparency Anti-Trafficking Act w/ @SenTedCruz, @RepLoisFrankel &amp; @RepTedDeutch. This bipartisan bill will strengthen reporting - helping authorities end visa exploitation &amp; combat horrific #humantrafficking.
Abusive employers lure foreign workers to the United States with false promises of jobs - only to coerce them into the sex trade and domestic servitude. Reporting gaps in temporary worker visa programs help traffickers get away with it. Today we say: No more.
If the President has nothing to hide, he should have no reluctance to answer questions about collusion between his campaign and Russian interference, and obstruction of justice.
The US v. Nixon case established the principle that the President has a duty to comply with subpoenas for documents or other evidence. In line with that precedent, four recent Presidents have provided interviews or grand jury testimony. Trump is no different.

Time is now to declare that we will not politicize the pursuit of justice. Defending the rule of law in the face of baseless, biased attacks must be a bipartisan goal.

Hopeful that the Judiciary Committee investigation’s pace will intensify, and that we will use our powers to investigate effectively and comprehensively.
The Special Counsel and his team will not be distracted. Our Committee investigations should be just as focused on uncovering the facts about Russian meddling, Trump campaign collusion, and possible obstruction of justice.
I remain deeply disappointed that the first major action by Judiciary Committee Republicans was aimed at someone who reported wrongdoing and done w/o Democratic consultation. That is a blatant betrayal of the bipartisanship that should characterize this moment.

One point of indisputable fact is that the FBI investigation of Russian election interference – and Trump campaign collaboration with it – was triggered by information completely independent from the dossier, Christopher Steele, or Fusion GPS.
These vaguely stated, secret allegations seem designed more to distract from the investigation's priorities, and even discredit the FBI and other law enforcement.

Meeting with Puerto Rican families in #Hartford, I heard their stories of loss and sacrifice after escaping the ravages of #HurricaneMaria - spending weeks and now the holidays in temporary housing away from loved ones. https://t.co/VmE8hKDoHI
Last night’s Continuing Resolution left so many national priorities undone:		❌ Protection for #Dreamers	❌ Disaster relief for Puerto Rico, the Gulf, and California	❌ Long-term funding for #CHIP and Community Health Centers	 	That's why I voted NO.
Sen. McConnell said ‘we have plenty of time’ to address DACA. I dare him to look into the eyes of a Dreamer – who goes to sleep every night filled with anxiety about their future – and deliver that cruel message.
I could not in good conscience support a short-term funding extension that lacks protections for #Dreamers. Congressional Republicans have sentenced 700,000+ young people to another holiday spent wondering if it will be their last in the country they call home.
I voted against last night's Continuing Resolution. There's no excuse for Congress's abject failure to meet our most basic obligations. Lurching from crisis to near catastrophe is no way to govern and certainly no way to lead.
Behind these statistics are grieving families and shattered communities, including so many in Connecticut. We need immediate federal funding and resources to curb the #OpioidEpidemic. https://t.co/JgJfxrTP0t

As the investigations deepen, the Senate must demonstrate an unwavering commitment to protecting the Special Counsel and countering interference threats from the White House.

I’ll fight as long as it takes for Congress to #RenewCHIP and go back to treating the health of America’s children as a top priority.
Republicans moved heaven and earth to pass tax cuts for the rich, but won’t lift a finger for 9 million kids on #CHIP. Every American should be outraged.
Instead of looking out for sick children, Republicans are celebrating the passage of tax breaks for the wealthy. Shameful.
Because of Republican inaction, thousands of CT families could spend the holidays worried about their kids’ healthcare. What a complete disgrace. https://t.co/AEY3G11Djk
America promised #Dreamers protection and peace of mind for coming out of the shadows. A great nation keeps its promises. #DreamActNow
Congress cannot wait to keep America's promise to 700k+ #Dreamers. The only way to morally pass an extension, the only way we can go home, is by passing the #DreamAct.
We must keep faith with the dedicated #Dreamers who make this great nation even greater - and that means passing the #DreamActNow. I will vote against any Continuing Resolution that fails to include the #DreamAct. #NoDreamNoDeal
Congratulations to Geno and Chris on your 1,000th win - and being teacher and mentor to so many. #Geno1000
The #GOPTaxScam is an abomination. Congressional Republicans have revealed their true selves: partisan zealots who care more about political promises to their wealthy donors than the lives of the people they are elected to represent.
Instead of enabling local governments to balance their books, this bill punishes their taxpayers for investing in their communities.
Instead of encouraging college student aid, this bill taxes higher education endowments used for scholarship funds and rewards the heirs of the wealthiest with no estate tax.
Instead of helping American wage-earning workers, this bill benefits real estate tycoons and foreign shareholders.
Instead of helping families buy their first home, the #GOPTaxScam gives breaks to millionaires purchasing their third mansion.
A tax bill is a moral statement. This one betrays basic American values. It funds burgeoning tax breaks for the wealthiest one percent – who receive 83 percent of the bill’s benefits – by burdening our children with trillions in debt.
We are fighting for #Dreamers across America - on the side of fairness, decency, and justice. History is watching. Let’s pass the #DreamActNow! https://t.co/zrUq82PASc
It is stunning that anyone would force hardworking young people - who know no home but here - back into the shadows. Now is the time to keep our promise and pass the #DreamAct.
Republicans in Congress should be focused on relief for 700,000+ #Dreamers, not gift-wrapping a tax break for corporations and wealthy donors. #DreamActNow
Imagine spending the holidays racked with fear of deportation. That’s the reality for thousands of #Dreamers right now. We cannot wait any longer to pass the #DreamAct.
RT @civilrightsorg: Passing the #DreamActNow is an issue of fundamental human decency and justice. Thank you @SenBlumenthal and @MartinOMal…
Sabotaging programs vital to America’s most vulnerable, like Social Security and Medicare, is no way to govern. The #GOPTaxScam should be roundly rejected.
Outrageous: #GOPTaxScam benefits - 83 percent - go to the wealthiest 1 percent. One third of all corporate benefits go to foreign shareholders.

Americans are right to wonder why Trump’s lawyers seem intent on discrediting Mueller investigation. Congress must act against urgent threat of interference from White House.

NTSB is on scene investigating derailment. Facts needed now – not months or years as investigations often take.
After disaster in Washington State, FRA must aggressively demand accountability and full PTC installation by 2018 deadline. Inaction puts American lives at risk.
NTSB first recommended Positive Train Control nearly 50 years ago. This proven technology can save lives and prevent injuries.
Technology like Positive Train Control must be implemented immediately to prevent trains from speeding and flying off rails. Statutory deadline is 2018 – no excuses.
Today's Amtrak accident demands a swift, thorough @NTSB investigation - and reminds us of the urgent need to redouble our commitment to infrastructure investment.
My heart goes out to the victims, loved ones, and all impacted by today's Amtrak tragedy in Washington State. Grateful for the quick action of first responders on the scene.

I am disgusted that @AjitPaiFCC and the FCC have defied overwhelming public opposition and upended the level playing field so integral to the success of our internet – undercutting the accessibility and spirit that have made it a force for innovation and economic growth.
In true Trump Administration fashion, everyday Americans will end up paying the price for the FCC’s disastrous decision to undo #NetNeutrality today.
Undoing #NetNeutrality is an early Christmas present for internet service providers, who will now be free to block content, slow speeds, and charge higher fees for access.
Today’s rollback of #NetNeutrality is a brazen betrayal of American consumers, innovators, students, and entrepreneurs – all of whom will suffer tremendously without a free and open internet.
Heading to the Senate Floor to speak on the fifth anniversary of #SandyHook. Tune in live on my Facebook page: https://t.co/6dMfLp9Lh1
Today and every day, we must honor the victims of tragedies like #SandyHook with action to curb the scourge of gun violence. I will never give up this fight. #HonorWithAction
Each day it does not act, Congress turns its back on the will of the American public - continuing its complicity as 90 more lives are lost to gun violence.
Shame on Congress for allowing yet another year to pass without action. Shame on Congress for allowing this tragic anniversary to be followed by so many more - in Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas, Orlando, Charleston, and communities big and small each day.
I stand in awe of the #SandyHook families who have shown unparalleled courage and resilience through unimaginable grief and pain. We must never forget the innocent lives lost five years ago today.
Today we mark five years since the tragedy at #SandyHook Elementary School in #Newtown - one of the darkest moments in our nation’s history.
Despite Rosenstein strongly supporting Mueller investigation today, bipartisan legislation protecting the Special Counsel is still urgent and necessary. I will fight for it.
As a federal prosecutor and state AG, I worked with FBI, state police, other professionals - all having political views, left and right. The mark of their professionalism is they parked them at the door, following only the facts and law.
Special Counsel Mueller took swift and decisive action to remove texting FBI agents from the investigation, even though there is no evidence that their views impacted their work or the investigation.
Rosenstein stood strong against disgraceful attacks by GOP Congressmen on Mueller inquiry today - a shameful effort to distract and sabotage the investigation with deceptive calls for second Special Counsel.
Brett Talley was beyond unqualified for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench. The rest of Trump’s unacceptable nominees ought to follow his lead and withdraw. https://t.co/QgnMk2hNjU

#NewBritain’s Mariano Cardoso has called America home for 27 years – raising a family, paying taxes, and giving back to his community. Deporting him while his permanent residency application remains pending is simply shameful.

Trump’s tweets are HIS words - no disavowal from him, no admission of “mistake.” He knew about Flynn’s FBI lies when he fired him, and when he asked Comey to stop investigating, and when he fired Comey too. Stunning evidence of obstruction of justice. https://t.co/YJLGyH0IJB
Top military commanders defending our nation against the national security and safety threat of gun violence - an enemy and epidemic that must be defeated. https://t.co/wOO8KQOJnQ
Today's Trump tweet about knowledge of Flynn lies adds evidence of Presidential obstruction of justice - after pressure on DOJ to stop Flynn investigation, firing Comey and Yates, calls to Senators, etc.
Obstruction of justice in the Oval Office unfolding before our eyes in real time - as Trump seemingly admits to covering up Flynn's lies to FBI about Russian contacts.
Trump's claim today that he fired Flynn because of lies to FBI, as well as Pence, shows knowledge of lawbreaking he concealed - never before disclosed.
This bill drives deeper divisions – creating more income inequality and uncertainty, engendering increased anger and anxiety, and undermining democracy. The feeble claim that it will spur jobs and economic growth is magical thinking – delusion or deception at an enormous price.
The people of Connecticut are particularly harmed by this malicious, malign bill - which eliminates critical deductions of state and local taxes and casualty losses for home repairs like the crumbling foundation homeowners.
The #GOPTaxScam promises relief for all, but massive permanent tax cuts go mostly to corporations and the wealthy, while the crumbs to the middle class are small and temporary. It imposes a mountain of debt on our children and grandchildren.
Americans will remember this day - and the Senate Republican majority will rue it - for the catastrophic scam foisted on the American people in the dead of night. It is a bait-and-switch, promising a simpler and fairer tax code, and actually making it more complex and unfair.

With the #GOPTaxScam, the wealthiest get tax cuts they don’t need, while everyday people get higher premiums they can’t afford. A stark reminder of who Republicans really work for.
There can be no delay. Senate Judiciary Committee must issue subpoenas for documents and witness testimony – in public and under oath – as I have repeatedly urged.
.@SenJudiciary is investigating obstruction of justice directly relating to Pres. Trump’s firing of James Comey after Comey refused to drop the very investigation of Michael Flynn now culminating in this conviction. We must pursue with new urgency.
Congress must now match the Special Counsel's courage by approving legislation to shield him from the very real threat of improper political interference, as I and others have proposed.
Make no mistake, #Flynn’s betrayal of national security is an enduring black mark on our country’s history and a stunning violation of his oath of office. Incredibly, he lied to the FBI while he was the President’s chief national security adviser.
This charge sends a bombshell signal: It’s about the Russians. #Flynn lied about issues of preeminent Russian interests – sanctions, the United Nations, and Russian exchanges.
#Flynn must continue to cooperate - completely and candidly - if he hopes to avoid even more serious criminal convictions.
The Special Counsel's investigation has breached the White House gates, reaching one of Pres. Trump's most trusted confidants and unmistakably implicating other top officials.
#Flynn's fall is staggeringly significant - the tip of the iceberg for him and Pres. Trump - as Special Prosecutor continues to pursue justice.

Connecticut isn’t fooled by the GOP’s spin and neither am I. We deserve better than a bait-and-switch #GOPTaxPlan that will leave many working families paying more.
Unconscionable that #GOPTaxPlan would open Arctic Nat’l Wildlife Refuge to oil/gas drilling in a desperate ploy to finance permanent corporate tax cuts.
I can’t understand how anyone can look their kids in the eye while backing a #GOPTaxPlan that will betray future generations and break the #ACA – all to benefit the wealthiest.
Today, every last Republican on the Senate Budget Committee voted (with no debate) to advance huge giveaways for the wealthiest and stick everyday Americans with the tab.
The people of Puerto Rico &amp; U.S. Virgin Islands have endured the unthinkable. We must promptly pass this urgently-needed bill and provide the help they need to recover. https://t.co/sYpAtgcFuL
Our bill has the makings of a Marshall Plan – providing vital funds to rebuild islands’ housing, electricity, health care, and basic government operations.
Proud to represent a state that has welcomed so many who fled Maria’s devastation. States like Connecticut need help to ensure public schools can accommodate the surge of displaced students. That’s exactly what our bill does.
Relief is not enough. Puerto Rico and USVI must rebuild with resilience to better withstand future disasters.
In the 10 weeks since #HurricaneMaria, the Administration’s response has been anemic and inadequate – a national disgrace that betrays all Americans.
Proud to join my colleagues in announcing a long-term, comprehensive plan to help fellow Americans in Puerto Rico &amp; U.S. Virgin Islands recover and rebuild.
#DREAMers in Connecticut and across America deserve peace of mind - not betrayal. RT if you agree: We must #ProtectDREAMers and pass the #DREAMAct by year’s end.

Time is running out to defeat this monstrous #GOPTaxPlan. We must continue standing up and speaking out in this critical fight. https://t.co/AHpRrPeYsv
If Republicans truly wanted to help everyday Americans, they wouldn’t have let CHIP health funds for millions of kids expire. Their priority is, and always has been, giveaways for the privileged few.
My constituents are right to be outraged by this reckless and rotten #GOPTaxPlan, which would end state/local deductions families use to save thousands.
Connecticut’s working families deserve far better than a tax plan that would steal from the middle class and wreak havoc on our economy and healthcare system.
Heading back to DC and ready to fight tooth and nail against the malicious and misguided #GOPTaxPlan – which could get a vote as soon as this week.

@CFPB Showdown in court over @CFPB benefits no one. Better for Mulvaney to stand down. Let CFPB do its job without political bullying.
Mulvaney isn't interested in helping consumers - only rich WallSt bankers. Strong leadership @CFPB means commitment to consumers over corporate profits.
Turning a consumer watchdog into a lapdog for big WallSt banks is not what American people need or deserve. CFPB must remain a vigilant protector of consumer &amp; economy. https://t.co/tYSnQ1LLdi
CFPB Director Cordray’s job should be filled by his deputy, as Dodd-Frank clearly requires. It supplants the older Vacancies Act. The President wants a dismantler, not a leader.
Congress had great foresight to mandate that the CFPB deputy fills the Director’s vacancy - to stop a bullying, tyrannical President from crippling the agency and undercutting consumers. That more recently passed provision trumps others. https://t.co/6HLb5WEMR9
Revelations about Trump’s foreign business deals underscore urgency of our Emoluments legal action. We need full disclosure and compliance with Constitution - no excuses.
Trump must come clean to the American people about his partners and funders in foreign ventures. Our Emoluments lawsuit would force it.
Sleazy and corrupt investors in Trump foreign deals show urgency of full disclosure that Emoluments lawsuit would require.
New evidence suggests why Trump avoids the transparency that the Constitution requires - our Emoluments suit would hold him accountable. https://t.co/j1rLPdsR0Y

From our family to yours, Happy #Thanksgiving! Wishing you a wonderful holiday surrounded by family and friends.
Uber should immediately provide all consumers with free credit monitoring and credit freeze services as well as identity theft insurance.
Senate Commerce Committee should hold hearing to demand Uber explain their outrageous breach - and inexplicable delay in informing its consumers and drivers.
I urge Federal Trade Commission to take swift enforcement action and impose significant penalties in response to Uber breach.
Consumers and drivers deserve better than Uber’s appalling contempt for their personal information. This corporate malfeasance should be swiftly and strongly punished.
Uber put its customers and employees at serious risk by not only failing to notify the public of the data breach but by taking affirmative steps to bury the news and paying off the hackers.
I urge everyone to read this new report on the dangerous toys still widely available in stores. It could save you a trip to the ER this holiday season. https://t.co/sbkCVzpZig
Toy safety goes beyond physical hazards. Increasingly popular internet-connected toys can become a tool for trolls to target kids – or for trackers to sell their personal info to advertisers. I’m fighting to strengthen laws.
Holiday celebrations can turn tragic in an instant thanks to dangers found in items as simple as balloons and magnets. Understanding the risks now could save a child’s life.
I joined @ConnPIRG at @CTChildrens to highlight this year’s "Trouble in Toyland" report – a must-read on hazardous toys available across America. https://t.co/DKMlfOL920

I remain appalled by Pres. Trump’s attempts to weaponize antitrust law because he disagrees with CNN’s coverage, and I’ll continue to oppose any improper influence by White House and any attempts by Administration to chill freedom of speech.
DOJ can anticipate a tough battle, but it deserves support for the goal of protecting against undue power and possible abuse that harms innovation and consumer choice.
Department of Justice suit blocking AT&amp;T/Time Warner merger is highly significant as an apparent effort to protect competition and consumers.
We need real, robust relief to tackle this humanitarian crisis, not the paltry package the White House has requested. I'll fight as long as it takes for Puerto Rico and USVI to get the help they need.
Two months after #HurricaneMaria, help urgently needed to get health, education, and economy of Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands on track – plus long-term Marshall Plan for lasting recovery.

@ChrisMurphyCT @RepEsty We can leave no stone unturned when it comes to curbing gun violence. That's why we must pass Fix NICS Act and take a bipartisan step toward the reforms Americans demand.
@ChrisMurphyCT @RepEsty Hopeful that the powerful alliance united behind Fix NICS Act is a prelude to more bipartisan collaboration on gun violence prevention.
@ChrisMurphyCT @RepEsty Our background check system is only as good as the information in it. Fix NICS Act will help close potentially lethal reporting gaps - helping prevent gun sales to people who are a danger to themselves or others.

This holiday - talk turkey, and taxes. Only public outcry and outrage can defeat this monstrosity.
Stopping this mean monstrosity of a bill means mustering the same energy that beat #Trumpcare. Retweet if you're ready to fight #GOPTaxPlan with all you’ve got.
#GOPTaxPlan shows Republicans will do anything to hand giveaways to those who need them least. Raising taxes &amp; premiums on working families is just the cost of doing business.
.@HouseGOP bill was bad, but what Senate Finance rushed through in the dead of night is worse. On top of raising healthcare costs and kicking millions off coverage, it would hike taxes for middle class.
It's absurd that the “party of fiscal responsibility” would grow the deficit by $1.5 trillion – and abhorrent that they stuck Connecticut's middle class with the tab.
In #Hartford w/ health advocates who know we need all hands on deck to defeat the #GOPTaxPlan and beat this backdoor attempt to gut the #ACA. https://t.co/GWWAtG0LqA

The @HouseGOP tax bill is a classic bait-and-switch - and the proof will be in middle class Americans' paychecks, where many will see higher taxes. This giveaway to the wealthiest should be dead on arrival in the Senate.

Here's an idea: If you want to make it harder for Americans to vote, organize, breathe clean air or drink clean water, you aren't fit for a lifetime judicial appointment.
How can any of my colleagues back nominee Brett Talley, who says the answer to Newtown is to “stop being a society of pansies and man up” and hasn’t tried a case in his life?
Jeff Mateer calls transgender children “Satan’s plan” and proudly says “we discriminate” based on sexual orientation. Handing him a lifetime appointment is beyond inexcusable. #StopMateer
The Trump administration has tried its level best to ram through nominees that would boost their destructive, deeply unpopular agenda. I won’t stand for it. https://t.co/tLPZicKtCf
We can’t hand lifetime appointments to nominees who would seek to undo decades of precedent on everything from reproductive rights to LGBT equality. https://t.co/kt0ytv2Eqf

Cooperation and compromise are not four letter words - helping here to save lives, literally.
Powerful alliance across the aisle could be a step toward more effective measures against gun violence.
With the Fix NICS Act we can bolster our background check system, keep guns away from would-be killers, and save lives. Grateful for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for confronting this crisis with action.
Our bipartisan Fix NICS Act will incentivize states, and hold federal agencies accountable, to build robust reporting systems that can prevent gun sales to people who are a danger to themselves or others - including convicted domestic abusers.
From Sutherland Springs to Charleston to Blacksburg, we’ve seen what can happen when gaps in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) let guns fall into the wrong hands. Enough is enough.
Americans have waited long enough for commonsense reforms to curb gun violence. Today, we are taking bipartisan action.
As if eliminating money-saving deductions for working families wasn’t vile enough, @SenateGOP now ready to hike premiums and kick millions off insurance. This isn’t #TaxReform – it’s an all-out assault on the middle class. https://t.co/OQ6x1oXX0h

As we continue our fight for passage of SESTA, I am buoyed by the steadfast support from diverse stakeholders committed to giving victims of sex trafficking their day in court, and bringing online sex traffickers to justice.

This critical step forward in our fight to end online sex trafficking is thanks to the tireless work of advocates, survivors, and a diligent bipartisan coalition of my colleagues. https://t.co/VZpSo09roW
The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act - bipartisan legislation I sponsored with @SenRobPortman - was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee this morning.
We cannot accept the inevitability of gun violence. Numbness is not the answer - now is the time to honor victims with action.
Gun violence touches communities of all sizes in all states. Curbing this senseless scourge can and should be a bipartisan priority.

Connecticut knows the horror of gun violence all too well. We grieve with the brave souls in Texas enduring unspeakable pain.

Until Republicans scrap this shameful tax plan and commit to a bipartisan effort that protects the most vulnerable, they can count me out.
By making massive corporate tax cuts permanent, it's never been clearer who Republicans really work for.
Nixing the student loan interest deduction throws graduates already struggling with debt further under the bus.
Repealing state and local tax deductions will devastate Connecticut families, who rely on them each year to save thousands.
This GOP plan hands a massive tax cut giveaway to corporations, leaving middle class families to pick up the tab.
True #TaxReform would help all Americans get ahead. That's not even close to what the Republican plan does.
The Republican tax plan is fundamentally unfair and fiscally irresponsible – a massive giveaway to special interests and the wealthiest.

You don't get to lecture anyone about "fiscal responsibility" if you support exploding our debt to finance tax cuts for the rich. Period.
Fact: The man who griped about the cost of lifesaving Puerto Rico aid wants $1.5 TRILLION in deficit-busting tax cuts for him &amp; his cabinet.
Despicable that Republicans want CT's working families to foot the bill for giveaways to top 1%. This is #TaxReform only Trump could love.
GOP #TaxPlan is a middle class sucker-punch - jacking up taxes on 428K Connecticut households to pay for giveaways to the wealthy.
No one is immune from the opioid epidemic - here in Connecticut or across America. We have an obligation to confront this crisis head-on.
I have urged Pres. Trump to allow the federal government to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a lifesaving opioid overdose reversal drug.
The $45bn my colleagues and I have proposed is only a start, but it will bring immediate relief to communities ravaged by the opioid crisis.
With dozens of Americans dying from opioids daily, we need an immediate emergency declaration - accompanied by resources, funding &amp; action.
Trump's declaration falls far short of needed action on opioids, freeing up a mere $57K in funding &amp; pulling resources from other programs.
Americans deserve real leadership on the opioid epidemic, not the empty rhetoric and half-measures we heard from the President yesterday.
Pres. Trump is right that we face an opioid crisis of epic proportions, but he has failed by reverting to the worn out "Just Say No" mantra. https://t.co/cFBZ6xAUJo

Horrifying. Why are immigration agents going after a 10-year-old girl seeking gallbladder surgery? https://t.co/IngSM46EXd
Mr. President, how many more Americans will die from opioids before you decide to take the bold steps this crisis demands?
In the three months since Pres. Trump called for an emergency declaration, hundreds of thousands have been touched by the opioid epidemic.
The Trump administration’s opioid declaration falls drastically short of the sustained, robust action American communities desperately need.
CT families suffering from the opioid crisis deserve better than half-measures and empty rhetoric offered seemingly as an afterthought.
@ChrisMurphyCT We have it in our power to curb gun violence. No more excuses. Let's pass the Background Check Expansion Act and make America safer.

HHS and CDC must prioritize disease control, prevention, and treatment - to prevent worsening of crisis and allow Puerto Rico to recover.

Disgraceful that Pres. Trump is undercutting Americans' healthcare in service of misguided, myopic crusade against ACA. Not leadership.

ACA is law of the land. President Trump should work w/ both parties on improvements, instead of using regular Americans as political pawns.

We need full truth about situation in Puerto Rico, not self-promotional videos that sugarcoat catastrophic crisis on the ground.
Americans need to know whether the Trump Administration is truly focused on helping millions of citizens suffering in Puerto Rico.
Congress must rescue health care from Trump sabotage. Onward Sens. Alexander &amp; Murray. Bipartisan work is our only hope.
Mean-spirited, rash, irrational - Trump's ending critical ACA subsidies shreds health care protections and shatters promises.

We cannot grow numb to the nightmare Puerto Rico &amp; USVI are facing. I'll fight for every ounce of relief they deserve - whatever it takes.
Americans everywhere have rallied behind Puerto Rico. Their inspiring response must be matched with unparalleled federal action.
Recovering from this crisis requires a long-term Marshall Plan to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure and restore vital networks.
Catastrophic conditions on the ground putting Puerto Ricans at risk. All available resources must be brought to bear on their behalf.
We cannot forget the humanitarian crisis facing millions of Americans - on their second week without access to clean water, power or fuel.
Pressed officials for answers on Puerto Rico/USVI relief during FEMA HQ tour in DC. Grateful for the chance to see relief efforts in action. https://t.co/pzFH67XRJu
Mr. President, if this senseless, cruel killing was “pure evil” then please lead to stop it - and 90 more deaths every day.
We should pray and grieve for victims, and honor them with action - commonsense steps to save others from gun violence.
Americans are right to be angry at Congress's inaction on gun violence - not just mass shootings, but 90 deaths in our communities each day.
Nothing has changed since Newtown, and Congress is complicit in this unspeakable slaughter. If not now, when?
As Connecticut did at Newtown, we grieve and pray for loved ones - but thoughts and prayers are not enough. We must act.
My heart breaks with sorrow for Las Vegas, but my stomach churns with anger. I am furious.
My heart breaks for Las Vegas - prayers to families and loved ones. The nation's conscience must be galvanized.
When crisis befalls our fellow Americans, count on Connecticut to step up. https://t.co/1X4Ihud1Jo
Long road to recovery ahead must unite us. President Trump is dividing Americans by demeaning and denigrating Puerto Rico.
I'll be visiting FEMA Headquarters in DC tomorrow with colleagues to demand more and better disaster relief.
Fellow Americans are facing dire need and danger. Response so far shamefully inadequate. https://t.co/Jk4xumDGu9
Double standard for disaster relief is unacceptable. Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico deserve more and better aid.
Heading to @FEMA HQ in DC tomorrow to question top FEMA &amp; administration officials on recovery efforts in Puerto Rico &amp; US Virgin Islands.

I'll continue fighting for Community Health Centers &amp; CHIP no matter how long it takes. There's nothing red or blue about saving lives. https://t.co/YKVZEqw1Aj
If this sabotage continues, the economic price will be tremendous – and loss of life will be inevitable.
Community health centers are worth their weight in gold, providing care to thousands in Connecticut - including many from Puerto Rico.
Republicans' inexcusable inaction on health center and CHIP funding endangers a vital healthcare network that has taken years to construct.
Allowing health center &amp; Children's Health Insurance Program funding to lapse is political malpractice to the point of purposeful neglect.

A week after Maria, 90% of Puerto Rico lacks power. 42% have no water. It's long past time to meet this crisis with the action it demands.
Appointment of Lt. Gen. Buchanan to coordinate Puerto Rico military relief is an encouraging step, but much more must be done.
I applaud the heroic, Herculean work FEMA and others are doing in Puerto Rico and USVI. Their efforts must be matched by many, many more.
Supply shortages span Puerto Rico's cities and rural interior, while a lack of drivers and impassable roads worsen a dire situation.
The anemic, inadequate response to Maria has become a man-made disaster – with food, water, and medical necessities in scarce supply. https://t.co/KtODnujEE9
This afternoon I spoke on the Senate Floor for the third time in as many days about a humanitarian crisis affecting millions of Americans.
A major issue like #TaxReform demands an open, bipartisan process. Instead, GOP wrote it in secret without Democrats - just like healthcare.
We should focus on proven drivers of economic growth like infrastructure, not a sham #TaxReform plan for people like Trump.
Unconscionable that GOP #TaxReform plan nixes $1.5 trillion in revenue- equivalent to defunding a decade of veterans’ healthcare &amp; benefits.
Unfair #TaxReform plan removes state/local deductions for thousands of CT families while lowering Trump's tax bill. https://t.co/64ft5Rn0jm

Every single American in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands deserves a robust, immediate response. Let’s get to work.
Our job now is to address both immediate recovery needs and long-term financial peril that continues to put Puerto Rico’s economy at risk.
I will continue pressing for solutions to Puerto Rico’s financial challenges – a result of unfair tax and healthcare laws.
Puerto Rico’s debt troubles are no secret, but they cannot impede efforts to help our fellow Americans recover and rebuild.
Neither Puerto Rico nor the Virgin Islands should be required to match or provide a share of money needed for recovery efforts.
We must provide the kind of relief that will allow all in hurricanes’ wake not only to endure and survive, but eventually thrive.
To our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands: You are not alone in this humanitarian crisis. Congress will have your back.
Follow the money - absolutely right. https://t.co/RyxFxSZk4n
Full aid package for those in Maria &amp; Irma's wake must be prepared &amp; passed ASAP. Anything less is an inexcusable insult to our compatriots.
Appreciate Gen. Dunford’s assurances that @DeptofDefense is ready and able to assist in hurricane relief and recovery efforts.
All available resources – including military support – must be brought to bear on behalf of Americans suffering in Puerto Rico.
We cannot avert our eyes from the nightmare our fellow citizens are facing. Puerto Rico needs help - now. https://t.co/enngylEEmd

Rigorous investigation - both civil and criminal - necessary now, as well as more leadership accountability.
Consumers need relief, not just resignations. Require stronger financial protections now.
Resignation does not excuse Smith from answering difficult questions about massive breach on his watch.
This is no substitute for the accountability consumers deserve. Equifax must fully comply w/ regulatory authorities during transition. https://t.co/92FZPSQvZ9
This is a make-or-break moment. #GrahamCassidy's fate will hinge on which side fights hardest this week. Don't let up now.
We are better than a bill that cuts coverage for millions, slashes Medicaid, and weakens women's health. We are better than #GrahamCassidy.
Make no mistake: #GrahamCassidy is 100% rotten to the core. Desperate, last-minute giveaways cannot change that.
With lengthy power outages likely, inaction is inexcusable. Thanks @USCPSC for joining the call for safer portable generators.
All portable generator sales should include carbon monoxide alarms with battery backup as well as 25-foot extension cords.
Portable generator manufacturers must implement stronger safety measures for their products – which can emit as much CO as 450 idling cars.
I am concerned by reports of carbon monoxide deaths &amp; poisonings resulting from portable generators used after recent natural disasters.
Congress must move swiftly on a robust aid package for Puerto Rico - one that includes urgent relief and long-term recovery support.
We must provide immediate support for Puerto Rico, where millions face the prospect of prolonged power outages &amp; clean water shortages.
As our fellow Americans embark on the long road to recovery, we have an obligation to do whatever it takes to help Puerto Rico rebuild.
The heartbreaking humanitarian crisis facing Puerto Rico after #HurricaneMaria demands more than sympathy and well-wishes. We must act now.

If Senate Republicans aren't giving up their misguided, misanthropic effort to strip healthcare from millions, we cannot back down.
This monstrously cruel bill would be catastrophic for real people with real healthcare needs. We cannot abandon efforts to fight it.
Sen. McCain’s characteristic courage and conviction in rejecting #GrahamCassidy should inspire my colleagues to take a bipartisan approach.

Millions kicked off insurance. Medicaid eviscerated. Protections for preexisting conditions slashed. That's the future under #GrahamCassidy.

We need a prompt, robust federal response to help Puerto Rico recover from Maria's devastation. Our fellow Americans deserve no less.
My thoughts are with everyone in Puerto Rico facing down #HurricaneMaria, the second storm to affect the island in as many weeks.
I'm ready to work on bipartisan healthcare fixes. But I won't heap more worry on families like Conner's, and neither should anyone else.
We are better than a system that turns its back on kids like Conner and makes families choose between children's health &amp; their finances.
Could my GOP colleagues explain to Conner's parents why Medicaid funding &amp; protections for kids w/ preexisting conditions should be slashed?
As Conner gets older he'll need a compassionate healthcare system to protect him when he's at his most vulnerable. #GrahamCassidy fails him.
Conner's Duchenne muscular dystrophy will rob him of his ability to run, walk, or hug. As there is no cure, it will likely take his life.
When I look at #GrahamCassidy, I can’t help but think of 7-year-old Conner Curran of #Ridgefield, Connecticut. https://t.co/DrQFbDNhKC
@jimmykimmel I won't stand silently while Republicans seek to strip #healthcare from millions. Connecticut and America deserve better than this disgrace.
.@JimmyKimmel is right. #GrahamCassidy is even more monstrous than the last #healthcare bill. It deserves the same fate.
#GrahamCassidy would cut hundreds of billions from Medicaid and end protections countless Americans rely on for lifesaving care.
Without question, #GrahamCassidy is the most extreme proposal we've seen from Republicans in their myopic, misguided #ACA repeal obsession.
I am horrified that once again, we must fight back against a healthcare bill that would devastate health &amp; finances of countless families.

Women in America have been denied care for too long because of Hyde Amendment restrictions. With #MedicareForAll, Hyde is history.
#MedicareForAll bill would guarantee coverage of a full range of reproductive health services. That's progress worth fighting for.
At a time when the Trump admin seems intent on dismantling reproductive rights, #MedicareForAll would protect women's health.
For those battling addiction, healthcare access is life and death. #MedicareForAll puts crucial treatment and support services in reach.
