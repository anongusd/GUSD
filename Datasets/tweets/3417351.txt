@Tsenzee @maziehirono He did not snub the parkland dad. That dad went with a chip on his shoulder, bragged on social media, he was on secret service radar and CHARGED at Kavanaugh. I‚Äôd have been afraid of the dude too.
@Tsenzee @maziehirono I‚Äôll give you that, the nuclear was BS. But I honestly think this Kavanaugh attack is malicious. I don‚Äôt always side with the accused and I‚Äôve been fairly accurate so far. This one reeks to high heaven.
@Tsenzee @maziehirono No, but I know some who flat lied. If it‚Äôs true in the least, he won‚Äôt be SCOTUS. BUT, what if it‚Äôs found that she‚Äôs lying, what should happen to women who lie in this *trendy* #MeToo - everyone-wants-to-be-a-victim, climate?
