If only nonwhite Americans could cast ballots, they would elect a gigantic Democratic majority - They leaned 33 points more Democratic than the national environment and their adjusted vote share would net a 388-to-47 Democratic majority. (Sounds good to me) https://t.co/SUJdcZzVIz
If we look at white voters w/o a college degree, their party preference was even more pronounced than college-educated whites. And as you can see, if only they were to vote, the country would be almost entirely red outside of big cities. https://t.co/tTmT2UIp7q
White college voters would elect a 233-to-202 Democratic majority, which isn‚Äôt all that different from where the Lite forecast sat on Wednesday: a 231-to-204 Democratic majority. https://t.co/gOwj7LnfwH
Men, on the other hand, were about 11 points more Republican than the country, and as such, they would elect a 249-to-186 Republican majority. But notice that the GOP seat total that men would secure is lower than the 275-seat Democratic majority that women would elect. https://t.co/d1oeJM1rZV
A women-only electorate would give Democrats a huge House majority: The adjusted vote share estimates suggest that women would elect 275 Democrats to just 160 Republicans, which is 44 more Democratic seats than the 231 projected Wednesday https://t.co/qEw2HJvOYn

Arming teachers is a stupid argument. ‚Äú
This isn‚Äôt a soldier we‚Äôre talking about. Not a Navy SEAL.. or a SWAT member. A teacher. You‚Äôre saying give 47 year old Mrs Johnson who teaches English Lit II a 9mm Glock and tell her she will need to put 2 rounds in the chest and one in the head of a kid.
Psychological: You‚Äôre asking a teacher to shoot and kill someone. You don‚Äôt shoot to injure or wound. You use a Taser to incapacitate. You use a firearm to kill. Period. And since most school shootings are carried out by children, you‚Äôre asking a Teacher to kill a child.
Liability: What happens if a teacher shoots someone who Isn‚Äôt the shooter? Who is responsible? The Teacher? The school district? The State? Who Pays for the injuries sustained?
Training: The training for an active shooter situation is extensive. Very extensive. And specialized. And it‚Äôs not free. It requires special facilities, specialized equipment, specialized instructors, and needs to be done often. Who pays for the constant training?
First, in no particular order: 	Cost. Who pays for the firearms? The school district? The State? The Feds? Or is the teacher responsible for the cost of the firearm and ammunition?
‚Äú‚ÄòOne way to stop school shootings is to arm the teachers.‚Äô This one gets thrown out there a lot. This is stupid. Aside from the fact that this is not addressing the core issues of gun violence...
