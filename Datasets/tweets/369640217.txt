@FareedZakaria It would have been nice to have more Saudis speak about their own country and history and the current and past transformations instead of listening to you projecting your own feelings towards Saudis as irrefutable facts.
In their jihad against Trump, it would make sense for CNN to go after Saudi, #KingdomOfSecrets latest of CNN hit pieces that deliver a predetermined narrative casting KSA in the worst possible light. The problem is this ends up dehumanizing us &amp; distorting the truth about us.
Many logical fallacies in doc, #KSA is an easy target for sensational stories that later get debunked.from the”wife tracking app” to the enquirer saga, to the many false stories over past 3 yrs. Does @CNN tell you that those stories turned out to be false? Don’t hold your breath.
Saudis are tired of the shallow understanding of their society &amp; history that was embodied by this @CNN documentary. Using punchlines &amp; soundbites to gloss over massively complex issues does not reflect an accurate picture at all. Shallow &amp; sensational.
Just watched #KingdomofSecrets by @FareedZakaria on @CNN. A collection of out of context half truths &amp; old, tired stereotypes put into dramatical sequence. Really hoped it would reflect an accurate picture of what is going on in #KSA &amp; dynamics behind it. Really disappointing.

In a message turning downan interview request, he said: “The main problem is Iran to Yemen, not [the] west to Yemen, which is nothing more than a political agenda rather than factual presentation. Too many on this bandwagon.”
He said many civilian deaths were because Houthi forces placed human shields in the way of the west’s allies. “I never read from the NGO community the huge problem we have now where human shields are being used.
Jones told the defence select committee that NGOs were “dishonest” in their reporting. “We see it time and time again with regards to airstrikes – there is a gross exaggeration by NGOs as to what has happened. You just have to pick up the newspaper.

The Crown Prince’s bold vision for the future proved its success during the last two years, and so did the CP, the connection between him and the people is something hard to describe, it is real and deep, which makes calls in the west to change KSA leadership all the more absurd.
In a region filled with wars and conflicts, here is the CP of Saudi Arabia talking about reforms, automation, industry, and an inclusive future for the “great Saudi people”. He speaks in the language of numbers, It is beyond refreshing and much needed at this point in time.
As a Saudi listening to Crown Prince Mohammed’s remarks, I am truly proud and grateful for a progressive leadership that has achieved so much in the last two years. Hearing words of encouragement and motivation from the CP himself has a powerful effect on young Saudis and Arabs.

13 In conclusion: 	The Turkish/Qatar/Muslim Brotherhood Media axis has been lying/changing the story from day 1 and is reveling in the global condemnation of an American ally.	In demanding answers on #JamalKhashoggi, one must look towards Turkey first and foremost.
11- .. Says KSA "committed to its principles in compliance with int'l laws/conventions &amp; safety of all its citizens." 	12- after 11 days of a vicious campaign against all things KSA, no evidence, no corroboration,just leaks &amp; cheap talk fed to hungry reporters looking for blood.
10- Global media circulate unsubstantiated claims by anon officials, start leaking, changing story,&amp; introducing (now debunked) rumors, creating media frenzy,hysteria. 	11- KSA interior minister condemns "lies and baseless allegations against the Saudi gov." ....
Lets follow the chronology of reports since disappearance of #JamalKhashoggi between KSA &amp;Turkey/Qatar/Muslim Brotherhood Axis, figure out for yourself who is telling the truth and who is creating hysteria: 	1- Jamal's fiancé, who isn't known to his family, reports him missing..

In meantime, KSA has been transparent; opening up consulate to media and to relevant authorities. CP said Jamal was “A Saudi citizen and we are very keen to know what happened to him. And we will continue our dialogue with the Turkish gov to see what happened to Jamal there.”
The Qatari media through its arms Al Jazeera and Middle East Eye and affiliated NGO’s have been severely irresponsible and deliberate in their misinformation campaign, which is not only been detrimental to the cause of truth, but also hurtful to Khashoggi’s family.
One must also take a minute to denounce the Qatari media’s reckless reporting on this case. Responsible journalists must see through the Qatari information operation conducted to undermine the truth about what happened.
These tapes that the Erdogan regime claims to have sound very exciting. They also sound like lies that could easily be eaten up by emotional colleagues of Jamal in the media establishment. Despite the hysteria, this episode has united the Saudi people more than ever.
After Americans have experienced - first hand - the lies and the brutality of the thuggish Erdogan regime against American citizens, why would their liberal media establishment take his word (and leaks) as the holy gospel? 	The truth will come out.
The 15 men squad - Fake	The apple watch - Fake 	The private jets - Fake 	The doctor- Fake 	The “dexter” episode- Fake 	The conflicting narratives are duping the world into a larger and more extensive attack against KSA. Beware Turkey &amp; Qatar’s information warfare.
One must deal with cation when it comes to anonymous Turkish sources, as they are compromised, unreliable and more importantly, politically motivated. All allegations are lacking in concrete evidence. The Turkish press is not free and totally under gov control. Remember that.
The series of Turkish leaks are designed to mislead. The changing narrative from the Turkish media should be a cause of great concern to all, as they continue changing the story every day since the disappearance of Jamal. No evidence, no proof, just leaks. By unnamed “officials”.

What a New Terrorist Designation Says About Iranian Action in Bahrain https://t.co/D46pv6OG13
“The United States and our friends in the Middle East must continue to work together against the common enemy of the Iranian regime. We must make their expansionism too costly and force them to refocus their time and treasure on better serving the needs of their own people.”
“Iranian proxy forces firing Iranian missiles are seeking to control this second vital piece of terrain on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Such control could give Iran the ability to use anti-ship missiles to threaten or shut down both major routes for oil to leave the region.”
@Uncle_Jimbo: A story in the @WSJ attempts to make this seem contrary to US interests or simply mercenary as a way to make weapons. That is an unfair characterization that presumes the weapons sales were the rationale for the certification, rather than simply a related issue. https://t.co/5ZUlcHMYlf

RT @Uncle_Jimbo: Excellent view of what the new Crown Prince means to the younger generation of Saudis https://t.co/ujv8LaMbcL
The sucess of Mohammed Bin Salman is a matter of international stability and continuity, we should all be rooting for him. As Saudis we cannot wait to keep working on improving our country, modernize, and move towards a tolerant, open, and non-oil dependant global power.
Regionally, he decisively confronted Iranian aggression and extremism. Critics say this came with mixed results, but as Saudis, the status quo was unacceptable, and he started a process which should have been initiated a long time ago.
Whatever you think of him, you cannot deny he is bold, His rise constitutes a breath of fresh air, for me, for my Saudi sisters, and for my (future) children. We as Saudis now have a sense of purpose/goals to achieve, stated in Vision 2030, bringing back enthusiasm and excitement
Hating Saudi Arabia and blaming it for all the world’s problems was “trendy” both on the left and right. Critics seized on the ambiguity and lack of outside communication to misinform and cast the country in whatever light they chose. Not with this Crown Prince..
The Crown Prince is not perfect, and he was/will be criticized for many things. His haters, long used to an archaic and impotent Saudi, have been grappling with the new, dynamic,&amp;reform oriented KSA. I watched them trying their best to undermine him at every step during last year
Thread: Last year, Mohammed Bin Salman became KSA’s Crown Prince in a historic decision by King Salman to elevate a 3rd generation royal, ending speculation about transiton of power &amp; securing the rule for the foreseeable future.For Saudis like me, the rise of MBS was a god send.
