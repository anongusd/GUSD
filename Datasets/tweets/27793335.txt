Demand that businesses commit to Safe Harbor for Black consumers now https://t.co/DAJjpA6Jx2
Dignity is a human right and corporations, businesses, restaurants and franchises have a responsibility to create a culture where everyone feels safe and welcome.
The Black dollar is powerful in America and annually brings in 1.2 trillion dollars to the economy, yet Black people are frequently not respected in the stores and brands they support.
We have the power to demand that corporations+businesses put an end to these dehumanizing experiences through Safe Harbor. A commitment to Safe Harbor is a commitment to ending racial bias and the frivolous calling of police on Black consumers that puts Black lives at risk.
A Black woman getting thrown onto the ground in an AL Waffle House, Black men being arrested in a Starbucks while waiting for a friend, or Black women members of a golf club questioned by police for playing golf are not unique experiences when you're Black in America
Pretrial incarceration often forces innocent Black people to plead guilty by holding them in inhumane conditions for month or years, simply because they can't afford bail. No more! This Mother's Day, #FreeBlackMamas https://t.co/2ZAxlExh4a https://t.co/B6qwPUyP9M
