RT @jon_kinsley: @MichaelGWaltz Good Afternoon! Nice seeing you on the @dailybriefing w/ @DanaPerino Thanks for supporting @realDonaldTrump‚Ä¶
@DavidTafuri @dailybriefing @DanaPerino @FoxNews @DavidTafuri this answer was in response to @DanaPerino question ‚Äúshould we remove Turkey from NATO?‚Äù I fully support US support to the Kurds and @POTUS Was right to tell #Erdogan to back down.
The #Turks are a critical ally- we have to continue to work with them, and we have great relationships with them across the #NationalSecurity apparatus. Really the problem here is #Erdogan and the political piece he‚Äôs put in place. .@dailybriefing .@DanaPerino .@FoxNews https://t.co/GNNhCI2QXE
The US is going to have to remain engaged in #Syria, &amp; .@POTUS was right to tell #Erdogan to back off. At the same time, we‚Äôre going to have to be very firm with the #Kurds- there better not be a single #Turkish civilian/soldier hurt while we‚Äôre working with them .@DanaPerino https://t.co/m0YPzdErvG

@RonandKatBecker Thank you!  God Bless. Onward!
What isn‚Äôt being discussed enough is the #proliferation issue, especially to #Iran. You have a rich nation that wants #nukes (Iran) that we already know works with a poor nation on the verge of having nukes (#NorthKorea). Pretty easy to see how this is going to go. .@TheStoryFNC https://t.co/SPGPd4NdAr
There are also very real risks to doing nothing and letting his program progress. It is only going to get more sophisticated with mobile launchers, solid fuel that allows quicker launches, submarine, etc. that will make the program more lethal and harder to destroy .@TheStoryFNC https://t.co/Bnd2WMpXHc
The job of the NSC/interagency is to present .@POTUS with options. In this case a preemptive strike is an option between doing nothing and all out war. I‚Äôm fine with #NorthKorea knowing about it loud and clear. That‚Äôs what will help our #diplomacy .@marthamaccallum .@TheStoryFNC https://t.co/zLAGgFmvBf
