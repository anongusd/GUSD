@ABC We should all just relax. Technology is far too powerful these days for anyone to not just Netflix and chill together.
@ABC Handsome
@CNN Everyone just chill and be nice to each other and we straight
@sizzyasplants @Emma4Change I agree with harsh gun control. And there are other ways that will protect the schools along with harsh gun control. Harsh gun control can help protect schools but it can lead to a bunch of other messes too. We should think outside the box when protecting the schools
@Emma4Change @sizzyasplants There are ways to protect the school without taking away protection from our homes

@FoxNews @TheJusticeDept We're sending the ice back to Alaska!
@CNN Okay folks, back to the basics. If you do something good, I'll give you a donut. If you do something great, I'll give you a glazed donut. Do something greater than that and I'll give you 2 glazed donuts
@ABC If I find one I'm going to find out if it's cool to deep fry pizza. Or if I should do a calizone and deep fry that. Or if I should bake it first then deep fry it. Hope I find one soon!
@CNN What a shit show, where the hell are all the leaders?! All we have in the White House are liters! Liters of horse piss!
@FoxNews @mgoodwin_nypost Any excuse we want to give it. If there wasn't all this media behind the shootings maybe no one would give a crap and kids wouldn't think about how much attention they would get if they ended up infamous.
@ABC She had pretty hair though
@sighnatasha How does a 16,17 or 18 year old have 28k tweets? That's 77 tweets a day for a year str8 if they have been tweeting year. If they've been tweeting for 2 years that is 30ish tweets a day and you get the math from there. That's mass tweeting. Hope the media stays out of your way!
@CNN @CNNStyle My 100 dollar bill would have 50 sets of boobies
@ABC Yep https://t.co/dHR7qGnZZF
@FoxNews @davidhogg111 How does he have 313k followers after 414 tweets, most of which got hardly any attention and is also a verified account? Good for him being able to make some impact on the Twitter. Hopefully he can help the world with his message

@shanejblair @paintercrystal @ABC But it's not messed up to send people in a country illegally back to their country. I'm all for figuring out a way to let them stay but it is not racist and people should be aware of what they're actually saying
@ABC Try going to live in another country without the correct paperwork and see how long they let you chill
@paintercrystal @ABC If you went to France without a work visa they would send you back too

@FoxNews @GovGaryJohnson What the hell is so hard about metal detectors and no one gets in the building without ID. It's really not that difficult. If some shit goes down after that the officer in the school can handle it if they were trained properly and has some balls.
@FoxNews @IvankaTrump The heck they all laughing at though?!
@JFSLT905 @CNN You're cool
@HistoryInPix Where is Waldo lookin
@FoxNews @POTUS And diversity, values, Italian food made in New York and trolls with wild hair like yours fam.
@FactSoup Didn't think you would ever say that so you already did. Mad props fam

@FoxNews @TeamCavuto What's up with the kids on Twitter getting 171k likes and retweets out the ass after being on here for 6 days? God bless these kids but seems skep that they join twitter and their first tweets get tons of action.
@TheWeirdWorld Fittin ta
@CaamanoKimberly @FoxNews I probably love you. Make sure someone gives you a foot massage tonight or soon
@CarpeNoctemNews @CNN Stories on stories. Morning stories and evening stories and bedtime stories and Twitter stories and cookies
@FoxNews Love taking dumps and pot... Let's do this
@sarahchad_ I admire you and your fellow students bravery. 171k followers after 6 days on Twitter should show that there are so many others out here that support you too. God bless
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson What's up with these kids that have 22k followers and getting retweeted 1000s of times after being on Twitter for 6 days too? I'm glad their voices are getting out there but seems skep to me.

@realDonaldTrump Once I thought I would be a policeman because I wanted to be a hero. I decided against it because I didn't want to have to carry a weapon to be a hero so I became a hero using my heart &amp; mind. Spend money on metal detectors &amp; have an officer in the school &amp; no one gets in w/o ID
@DiGiorno You should have someone deliver DiGiorno. That would be ðŸ”¥
@leroyl_dixon @ABC We're the safest nation in relation to other nations attacking us probably but it appears that this melting pot that we call USA is boiling. We need to promote lots of love and take action to keep the future generations safe. And you're right, starts with an open mind
@CultureWarrior7 @ABC Exactly. Throw up some metal detectors and doors that will open only to school IDs. No one should be getting into a school without someone knowingly letting them in and no one should be able to walk through an entrance to a school without going through a metal detector either.
@leroyl_dixon @ABC There's no good answer to any of this but at least they're going to do what they can. At least that's something they can do
@ABC Add metal detectors and officers both and should be as safe as we can get with schools. I had armed police in my high school back in the day because of drugs and fights, makes sense to keep them there to help prevent harm to innocent kids too.
@ABC Is it that hard to put in metal detectors in school? I had police in my high school every day for 4 years because of drugs. Throw some metal detectors up and some police and let's get it done. I'd rather them patrol the schools then pull someone over rushing to work
@Brandonwoelfel They pretty much are

@tedlieu @votevets @realDonaldTrump A bigger show of strength would be to spend those millions on sending food to the hungry both in our country and others. Feed people and help them feel safe. #usa  #makelovenotwar
