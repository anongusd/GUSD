We recommend local health departments work with their community and state partners to use surveillance data to monitor trends, identify outbreaks, track emerging #antibioticresistant threats, &amp; guide planning efforts to combat them! #USAAW18 #AntibioticResistance
Robust funding that equips local health departments with modern laboratory infrastructure &amp; supports workforce development to leverage novel surveillance techniques is critical to addressing the increasing threat of drug-resistant #gonorrhea. #USAAW18 #AntibioticResistance
Despite ongoing efforts, few labs &amp; healthcare settings can access tests for #gonorrhea drug-resistance. Slowing this emerging crisis requires access to tests &amp; improved surveillance systems to detect, treat &amp; prevent spread. Local health depts. are essential to this. #USAAW18

A5: @AdamPStewards: The quote from @RasuShrestha, "Healthcare should not just be about surviving, it should be about living and thriving," captures it. We must understand that our work has real human consequences. #2018PHI
Q5: What's the call to action moving forward? #2018PHI
A4: @AdamPStewards: Data is only going to get better and, with time, so will our ability to use it. We've all got to be professional optimists and use the progress we've made to inspire us to keep moving forward. #2018PHI
A4: @WaHealthSec: We've got to get to a point where consistent, real-time, quality data is the norm. It's also important to celebrate our successes. Our problems/challenges will remain, so it's vital to remind ourselves that we're doing good work &amp; have come a long way. #2018PHI
Q4: What does the future look like as it pertains to being stewards of change for population health? #2018PHI
A3: We also need leadership. Someone has to step up and say that the culture has to change, and then start making inroads with the leadership in other sectors to move things forward. #2018PHI
RT @LillyKan: .@AdamPStewards on collaboration and connecting information systems: We cannot see what happens next, we can make what happen…
A3: Our problems cross sectors. No one sector can address everything, so we all need each other. By partnering, we can expand our impact by plugging each other's gaps. Collaboration has to be a core value or else we won't reach our goals. #2018PHI
Q3: How do we shift from competing with other sectors to cooperating? #2018PHI
A2: We have to partner with each other. The state can set overarching vision and guidance, but localities know their communities best. Locals need the recognition, support, and resources to implement the right approaches for the people they serve. #2018PHI
Q2: How do local health departments get more involved with what's happening at the state level? #2018PHI
A1: @AdamPStewards: There's lots of emphasis on data, but we need to focus on how we use and communicate that data to create change. #2018PHI
A1: @WaHealthSec: As a trained epi, I was all about collecting as much data as possible. But, I've learned to have a bias for action. Data is only useful if you do something with it.  #2018PHI
Q1: What is one thing you'd wish you'd known at the start of your journeys? #2018PHI
Now it's time for some Q&amp;A! #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: Inaction could be the death of us, so please just start somewhere. #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: Another one of our goals is to end HIV/AIDS in Washington State. Through data, we can make this a reality. We're already working toward this by using data to track whether people living with HIV are engaged in care. #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: Washington State has a successful prescription drug monitoring program and is working to incorporate that data into EHRs. With this, you can more accessibly monitor patients and track provider prescribing practices. #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: If your leadership is not engaged and convinced about the need for interoperable information systems, you have to involve them and get their buy-in. #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: As leaders, we have to grapple with the governance of our information systems, develop policies, educate staff about the vision, and train them to execute. #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: In public health, our foundation is crumbling. Resource constraints make it difficult to deliver basic pieces of our services and capabilities. In Washington State, we're working on raising this issue to elected officials so that we can get more support. #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: Cell phones were a major motivator for me. We can do so much in real-time with apps - hail a ride, order groceries - we've got to innovate so that we can move information more quickly and comprehensively. #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: It's hard to lead and improve programs when data are stale. #Publichealth needs more real-time information and feedback loops to inform our work. #2018PHI
.@WaHealthSec: Having a general direction and vision is important and having a team that can help you tackle that vision is even more important, especially because our path isn't always clear. #2018PHI
Dr. John Wiesman, @WaHealthSec, takes the stage next! #2018PHI
.@AdamPStewards leaves us with some strong words: The best way to predict the future is to create it. Let's the create the future we want to see. #2018PHI
.@AdamPStewards: working on Opioids Prevention Playbook and certification program for Interoperability Training and Curriculum #2018PHI
.@AdamPStewards: Interoperability is the goal but once you start to set up interoperable systems, it's important to also continually think about how to optimize that interoperability. #2018PHI
.@AdamPStewards: @NICnetworks focuses on six domains, with an emphasis on using social services to leverage data across human services, public health, education, public safety, EMS, and healthcare IT. #2018PHI
.@APertmanStewards discusses collaboration among @kresgefdn @AcademyHealth and Stewards of Change. #2018PHI
.@APertmanStewards The success is in advancing the cause: interoperability, integration, and information sharing, to advance your own work. #2018PHI
.@AdamPStewards talks about the National Interoperability Collaborative, @NICnetworks, a community of networks that connect programs and sectors to serve the most vulnerable populations in our nation. #2018PHI
Pertman: It’s about the people you serve, and takes patience and relentlessness #2018PHI
.@AdamPStewards: You look at science and data for a living, but this conference has been inspirational because it hasn't been about the numbers; it's been about how we change people lives. #2018PHI
Adam Pertman from Stewards of Change and John Wiesman @WaHealthSec bring the inspirational piece to #2018PHI
.@EOscarAlleyne shares a nice call to action: Strike at the source of trouble and not the symptoms. Use sincerity and honesty. Know how to benefit others. Give people &amp; communities something to believe in. #2018PHI
.@EOscarAlleyne: "The world of public health can rise under your leadership. You all are such a part of that success." #2018PHI
@nacchoalerts’ Sr Advisor @EOscarAlleyne moderates the final session of #2018PHI like a boss. https://t.co/PtFoxAqNZt

For more information about the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA), visit https://t.co/WSk8nkJom2. #2018PHI
Good question from the audience: what's going to incentivize people to move into the Framework? @ONC_HealthIT cannot go in-depth about this, but recognizes there does need to be drivers to push people to participate or else data silos will continue. #2018PHI
RT @RasuShrestha: Here's a summary of public comments for #TEFCA from #PublicHealth:		✔push transactions	✔opt out	✔bulk data use cases	✔sin…
Qualified HINs, end users, and individuals must participate in an "identify proofing" process to ensure that they are who they say they are. Plus, authentication is required to gain access and there's a mechanism for data breach notifications. #2018PHI
So the big question: what privacy and security protections does the Trusted Exchange Framework guarantee? #2018PHI
1) Broadcast Query (i.e., request for patient's EHI from all QHINs); 2) Directed Query (i.e., sending a targeted request for a patient's EHI to a specific organization); and 3) Population Level data (i.e., querying EHI about multiple patients in a single query). #2018PHI
There are three public health uses cases for using the Trusted Exchange Framework to query and gather electronic health information (EHI). #2018PHI
The Trusted Exchange Framework has permitted purposes, which include #publichealth, treatment, benefits determination, payment, individual access, and #healthcare operations. #2018PHI
And here’s a logic model of how the Trusted Exchange Framework will work: #2018PHI https://t.co/uVyzqzae7X
This is what the structure of a qualified HIN (QHIN) would look: #2018PHI https://t.co/rziBdZwjYc
@ONC_HealthIT will select a "Recognized Coordinating Entity" that will act as a governance body to incorporate the Trusted Exchange Framework into a single, all-encompassing data use agreement that qualified HINs must agree to abide by. #2018PHI
The Trusted Exchange Framework appears to have potential to open the doors to greater data accessibility for providers, patients, and partners - but how will it work? #2018PHI
For patients and caregivers, the Framework enables them to find all of their health information from across the care continuum, even if they don't remember the name of the provider they saw. That last part sounds like it could be game-changing! #2018PHI https://t.co/hJpWZCvKHp
There benefits of the Framework for health information networks (HINs) are that health systems will be able to work with third parties more easily and HIN participants will gain access to more data on the patients they serve. #2018PHI
The Trusted Exchange Framework aims to create a technical and governance infrastructure for qualified health information networks (HINs). #2018PHI
Here are the goals for the Trusted Exchange Framework. #2018PHI https://t.co/vR8Tls4gwv
The need for the Trusted Exchange Framework stems from having more than 100 health information networks in the U.S., many of which do not share data with each other. #2018PHI
We're live from the #2018PHI Town Hall on Forging a Path to Interopability with the Trusted Exchange Framework, featuring @ONC_HealthIT's Rachel Abbey.

RT @EsteGeraghty: “Everybody loves to innovate, but nobody really likes to change.” Well said @RasuShrestha #2018PHI @NACCHOalerts
A3: @RasuShrestha “Visualizing what could be, telling compelling stories is key.” #2018PHI
A3: @RasuShrestha “We need to understand that things evolve and continue to change. We must be able to articulate the vision well.”
A4: @RasuShrestha: Innovation is attractive, but no one really likes to change. So we can't shun the status quo; we have to dig deep to understand how it came to be in the first place and empathize with that. Then, work to engage stakeholders to evolve. #2018PHI
A3: @MonaSiddiquiMD “There are good reasons for silos at @HHSGov, our perspective is to push the conversations to get to the source of truth. It comes down to education on the processes, raising the bar, being open to learning, and pushing more.” #2018PHI
Q4: What are successful strategies to get people to disrupt the status quo? #2018PHI
A2: @MonaSiddiquiMD “I look to our state partners for showing how you make data interoperable. I’m acutely aware of the funding challenges... it needs to be a line item in a budget.”
Q3: How can we ensure we get our "fair share" of funding contributions but programs (e.g., Medicare) that benefit from us improving our data strategy and interoperability? #2018PHI
A1: On interoperability: “No patient’s story lives within one silo” #2018PHI
A2: @RasuShrestha: Patients and the people we serve live above our organizational silos, so we have to figure out how to connect our disparate systems to deliver the care they need. #2018PHI
Q2: What's your current state and strategy for sharing health records across your service areas? #2018PHI
A1: @MonaSiddiquiMD: We're working with data folks, journalists, entrepreneurs, etc. to gather input and ensure we redevelop our open data platform to deliver maximum value for the end user. #2018PHI
A1: @RasuShrestha: We're also working to collaborate outside of our organization, through a local data alliance. We work in concert with partners and stakeholders to strategize around how we can put data to use and make sustainable change a reality at all levels. #2018PHI
A1: @RasuShrestha: We're addressing the culture clash by integrating patients, clinicians, and everyday people to help us inform our work before we ever right a line of code. #2018PHI
Q1: What lessons have you learned from undertaking change management efforts to shift the culture around data in your organizations? #2018PHI
It's time for some Q&amp;A! #2018PHI
.@MonaSiddiquiMD: We need a strategy for data beyond just one-off projects. We need an organizational strategy that shifts the culture and can drive our approach to data long-term. #2018PHI
.@MonaSiddiquiMD shares a good change management lesson for us all: staff and leadership in your agencies need to see incremental advancement and demonstrated value from your changing data strategy. That's what creates and sustains buy-in. #2018PHI
.@MonaSiddiquiMD Change management is the hardest piece; this is the challenge.   The guidance document is the key, and the status quo is our biggest competitor. @HHSGov #2018PHI
.@MonaSiddiquiMD A framework for the vision of how the work gets done.     @HHSGov #2018PHI https://t.co/C9XAJAV6xK
.@MonaSiddiquiMD: We're now creation a vision for the future that allows us to address those challenges by creating a common organizational understanding of data sharing across agencies. #2018PHI
.@MonaSiddiquiMD: Through our work, we uncovered process (e.g., data requests), technical (e.g., formatting), legal (e.g., data access restrictions), and workforce capacity (e.g., strained resources) challenges. #2018PHI
.@MonaSiddiquiMD: We started with a current state assessment, collecting high-value data assets from HHS agencies and doing interviews to gather insight into how that data came to be. This provides a powerful look into the way our agencies operate. #2018PHI
Dr. Mona Siddiqui, chief data officer, U.S. Dept of HHS talks about how HHS is leveraging its own data to create value. @MonaSiddiquiMD @HHSGov #2018PHI https://t.co/iYN0VJlCTk
.@MonaSiddiquiMD: The desired outcome of our approach is transforming @HHSgov into a more interoperable organization. #2018PHI
"We're setting ambitious timelines and talking to our customers at the frontlines of doing this work." @MonaSiddiquiMD @HHSGov #2018PHI
.@MonaSiddiquiMD: We were facing challenges, such as data being siloed in the agency of origin, inefficient data sharing processes, and uneven analytics capacity. #2018PHI
.@MonaSiddiquiMD: We often talk about the value of data; but we need to talk more about the process of turning the data we've compiled into useable information. #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: As data people, there's an ethos that we should carry; one that is curious, disruptive, intense, people-centric, and accountable. #2018PHI
How should we incentivize our systems? Entrepreneurship means we're trying to find newer ways at doing healthcare; we're looking at data to see how we tackle the #SDOH @RasuShrestha @UPMCnews #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: Healthcare isn't just about adding years to life, it's about adding life to years. And if our hospital beds are filled, it means we've failed. #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: At @UPMC, we're risk-stratifying our chronically ill patients. Through this, we're able to discharge people with digital health tools that can bridge them to their care needs, based on their level of risk. #2018PHI
"We're not taking into account all the factors about patients that matter most. We're not taking time to ask these questions." @RasuShrestha @UPMCnews #2018PHI
The data that really matters: will a patient be able to afford their medicine? In understanding why patients opt out of interventions, we need to better understand the elements that motivate the decisions that patients are making. @RasuShrestha @UPMCnews #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: It's not just about the data we can see in our records, it's also about the data happening around the lives of the people we serve. #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: From a perspective of social determinants of health, we can use data to figure out why patients opt out of interventions. We often think of these people as noncompliant, but we should be tapping into the factors motivating people's decisions. #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: There's data everywhere, telling stories about you, your families, cities, and counties. But we're just scratching the surface of data accessibility.  #2018PHI
"Data is not the end goal. So how do we use data as a basis for actually transforming the face of healthcare?" @RasuShrestha @UPMCnews #2018PHI
"We make this culture at UMPC coming together in meaningful ways, working together with members of the community. We're not afraid of things that are daunting."  @RasuShrestha @UPMCnews #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: It starts with people. We've got to take a person-centered approach to care and come together to make a difference in the lives of those we serve. #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha shares the building blocks of making innovation stick: #2018PHI https://t.co/LIYX5eYaCp
"We're all innovators" -- what are the building blocks of making innovation stick?  @RasuShrestha CIO, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,  	@UPMCnews #2018PHI

The evolution of data storage #2018PHI https://t.co/ltX3UMzZYL
.@RasuShrestha: We've got to advance the things that have worked before, but also be open to new approaches from innovators. #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: We've had remarkable progress in embracing digital and data in the health system, but the challenge today is capitalizing on the investments we've made to transform the data we have into meaningful insights. #2018PHI
.@RasuShrestha: There's a clash in the pursuit of excellence in health and healthcare. Most startups are in a hurry, but most healthcare is not. Howe do we solve for that? #2018PHI

Foldy welcomes this morning's speakers, Dr. @RasuShrestha, Chief Innovation Officer at @UPMC, and Dr. @MonaSiddiquiMD, Chief Data Officer at @HHSGov. #2018PHI
Foldy: Today's plenary is all about our efforts to make sense of data. We've got growing piles of information; it's on us to link that information and data together to help us save lives. #2018PHI
Dr. Seth Foldy takes the stage at #2018PHI https://t.co/plkunyuG74
Next to the stage is Dr. Seth Foldy, Director of Epidemiology, Preparedness, and Informatics at @DenPublicHealth. #2018PHI
Freeman: Public health is fairly comprehensive &amp; inclusive. Optimistic and strong leadership across sectors is critical to augmenting public health surveillance, programs, and services sufficiently in the 21st century. #2018PHI
Freeman: "All members of a partnership team, from senior management to the end user, need to be invested in creating the most usable, goal-oriented system possible and identifying the ways electronic information can be managed and used for the maximum benefit." #2018PHI
Freeman: These and other influences challenge us to think beyond the traditional framework of public health, but the benefit of public health informatics is its potential to help people make better decisions, no matter their role in the health system or beyond. #2018PHI
Freeman: Tech and information systems are constantly changing the ways in which we operate and do business. The data that are available are far more abundant than before, but accessing and using them remain major challenges. #2018PHI
Freeman: In #publichealth, we continue to live in uncertainty as the livelihood of our work remains at the whim of shifting priorities and shifting budgets. #2018PHI
NACCHO's Executive Director, Lori Tremmel Freeman, takes the stage to give opening remarks. #2018PHI

A3: Richards: It starts with governance. We have to have the resources to modernize certain systems, but also need to consider how we can better integrate and maximize the use of the existing systems we have. #2018PHI
Q3: What concrete steps are being made for CDC to give funding to historically underfunded areas of public health informatics  (e.g., lab data)? #2018PHI
.@ASTHO's Tim Carney hops onto the mic to note that not only will it be helpful for state and local health depts. to know what CDC is doing with their data, but also *how* the agency collects, analyzes, and applies that data. This will allow us to replicate to a degree. #2018PHI
A2: Richards: We have to get the discipline more recognized, but until then we can at least make sure that we're accurately listing the competencies we're looking for in our informatics professionals. Formal education isn't the only indicator of capability. #2018PHI
Q2: Public health informatics training programs, especially at universities, aren't currently robust; how do we get around that challenge? #2018PHI
A1: Richards: Informatics has had a challenged history and not many people know what it is; by focusing on data science, we can get a bit closer to terminology and approaches that resonate more with people working in public health programs. #2018PHI
Q1: Why is your focus on strengthening data science vs. informatics? #2018PHI
Now, Jason and Dr. Richards will take questions. #2018PHI
Bonander: The Digital Bridge governance model has EHR, public health, and healthcare at the table working together, and this is a nice framework to consider working off of. #2018PHI
Bonander: The process of identifying, planning, and prioritizing strateic investments is going to require a fundamental change in the culture of #publichealth in general. #2018PHI
Bonander: CDC is hoping to better plan, prioritize, and coordinate investments internally to have a broader impact across the public health spectrum, and ultimately a broader impact in serving communities. #2018PHI
Bonander: In the second prong of our two-part recommendation, CDC will work to: 1) Create state-of-the-art, interoperable systems and tools; 2) Support, improve, and coordinate our data partnerships; and 3) Coordinate data and IT investments and governance. #2018PHI
Bonander: This is a humbling presentation to give because we at CDC know that we have a lot of work to be done within our own agency. #2018PHI
Richards: We also have to get serious about interoperability. We need systems that can talk to each other. #2018PHI
Richards: And when we CDC does embark upon data initiatives, we realize we need to do a better job gathering state and local perspectives to inform such efforts. #2018PHI
Richards: Historically, we've put emphasis on building our own systems and putting our own data into them. But we have to shift our perspective to start leveraging existing systems and and datasets to solve our problems. #2018PHI
Richards: Training is at the foundation of these recommended actions, but we must also work to attract new, young talent. And not just those with health backgrounds, but those with skillsets that could complement the work of #publichealth (i.e., engineers). #2018PHI
Richards: There are two actions CDC is recommending to get us to the future we envision: 1) Grow our data science and IT-savvy workforce, and 2) Expand our core data and IT capacity. #2018PHI
Richards: CDC sees a future that looks like this: #2018PHI https://t.co/lTHoKL9hBF
Understanding all of this, these are the 5 areas that CDC’s Public Health Data Strategh is aiming to address. #2018PHI https://t.co/uHbzw7unQy
Richards: CDC has great relationships with our traditional #publichealth partners, but we have to reach beyond that. By collaborating with non-traditional sectors and professions, we can move our work forward, even if we're approaching it from different perspectives. #2018PHI
Richards: CDC also recognizes that people outside of our agency are often sending us data but aren't seeing the outputs of what's being done with it. We're working to change that. #2018PHI
Richards: #Publichealth is comfortable with primary data collection (i.e., surveys), but we're missing people with the kind of data science skills to do big data analysis with the electronic health record data that's available. #2018PHI
We're live from the #2018PHI town hall on "Key Principles Guiding CDC’s  Public Health Data Strategy &amp;  IT Modernization Activities," featuring Jason Bonander, Assoc. Director for Informatics at @CDCChronic, &amp; Dr. Chesley Richards, Dep. Dir. for Public Health Scientific Services.

The #2018PHI Exhibit Hall is officially open! Stop by the Grand Ballroom between  10:00am-6:30pm to connect with more than 30 exhibitors and see live demos of health information exchange at the @HIMSS Interoperability Showcase: https://t.co/FCXUXoEMFk
#A9: @usahluwalia @MoCoDHHS It's daunting; you need to ask the right questions and realign resources. Do we have the right partners? And, not just having the data, but having a vision to bring it to people. On all levels, much training is needed. #2018PHI
#A9: Richards: We need an openness to look broadly at the solutions. We hold out for perfection, and don't make progress. So we need to create an environment that less than perfect is okay. I wrestle with: how do you stay current?  #2018PHI
Q9: What skills and abilities do people need to be successful in holistically integrating resources (people and systems) to improve health? #2018PHI
#A8: @usahluwalia: Patient access: We're not there yet. It's very overwhelming, considering what's still not done. A big part of the service sector isn't connected. Working through privacy concerns. But we do need to get there; it's the next frontier. #2018PHI
Q8: Have you thought about patient access and how that would work? #2018PHI
#A7: Guillen: There are mechanism in all of these communities. Nonprofits know the communities and can be the gatekeepers. Get some engineers together for a hackathon, see what they come up with. We're not maximizing the innovation. #2018PHI
A7: Guillen: Mobile technology is key. Lots of people, despite their socioeconomic situations, at least have access to a cell phone. Think about how we can connect with people that way. #2018PHI
Q7: How do we best connect people across sectors to bring data to life in a way that's meaningful to the people we serve? #2018PHI
#A6: @usahluwalia @MoCoDHHS: Building a mobile workforce would help. 	to get institutions like the local universities interested. I'd love for them to come where we are and play with our data and find solutions. #2018PHI
Q6: What are the top things you would like to have solved that aren't being solved? #2018PHI
#A5 @CDCgov's Richards: the role of the small business is to fit in with these different responsibilities. Keep it as simple as possible. Having training in real-time to give people time to master new information. #2018PHI
A5: Richards: At the federal level, we need to be able to bring data together; deliver tools that allow people to collect data collaboratively, when necessary; and ensure there is training available to help people use these tools. #2018PHI
Q5: How do you see small businesses supporting data efforts at @CDCgov? #2018PHI
A4: We also intentionally ask candidates about their views on the role of social determinants of health and the role of public health in their work. So we also integrate the importance of SDOH in the hiring process. #2018PHI
#A4: Bring all of the elements to bear; the hardest part is that culture of public health and that of human services can be different. Any integrated conversations had to have a public health lens. We built early adopters among our nurses and they became our ambassadors. #2018PHI
Q4: How can we better integrate social determinants of health into our data and technology efforts?#2018PHI
#A3: We use QSOA mechanism/signed agreements to use data. It's helpful to have a risk manager to review work. #2018PHI
Q3: Around CFR 42 (confidentiality of substance abuse), how can we reduce barriers to improve data sharing? #2018PHI
#Q2A: They are commercial; not homegrown. We use the same EHR, and then our integrated case management system. Is it ideal? No, but it gets us 3/4 of the way there. We're still learning. State gave us access to their servers. #2018PHI
Q2: Can you talk about the electronic case management systems used at @MoCoDHHS? #2018PHI
Q&amp;A #2018PHI #1A: You have to disrupt the existing status quo.
A1: Trust. Listen. Disrupt. #2018PHI
Q1: What's one thing that people should take home from this conference? #2018PHI
Guillen: What is really keeping us from maximizing innovative processes to solve problems? Fear, risk factors, workload impact. We have the methods, but we hold ourselves back. #2018PHI
Guillen: Understanding culture and diversity is key to connecting people and building partnerships. We're making great technological advancements but aren't always thinking about basic barriers that prevent the most vulnerable people from benefiting. #2018PHI
#2018PHI Ruby Guillen, Humanistic Technologies: Critical to create apps that actually address the barriers that prevent people from receiving needed services.
#2018PHI Ruby Guillen, Humanistic Technologies: How do you solve problems by implementing smart city infrastructure without talking about social services?
#2018PHI Ruby Guillen talks about her personal eperiences in receiving services https://t.co/augjGtxZOi
Guillen: As we answer these questions and start to think about using data to create solutions, we need to be cognizant of how we engage with people because at the end of the day it's about them. #2018PHI
Guillen: In order to connect people across sectors, we have to ask ourselves some simple questions:  What is the status of public health? Where does public health info, research, and data exist? Who has access to that info? And how can I gain access? #2018PHI
#2018PHI Ruby Guillen, LA County, founder &amp; CEO of Humanistic Technologies: what does it feel like to be a client at the other end of services?
Next up is Ruby Guillen! #2018PHI https://t.co/KaK39pWRCe
.@usahluwalia: Data can also lead to simple revelations that can make a big difference in #pophealth. For example, we found that texting is better than calling to get immigrant populations to show up for appointments because this group saves their minutes to call home. #2018PHI
#2018PHI @usahluwalia from @MoCoDHHS: All of these require an integrated approach, using a 360 degree view. "Our approach to housing is healthcare."
.@usahluwalia: This is what that integration looks like in our system; you can get a 360 degree view of the client. #2018PHI https://t.co/hKkbkrvOmZ
.@usahluwalia: The value prop of an integrated health and human services enterprise is the realization that we can't treat our way out of health inequities. Healthcare is not the sole solution to improving #pophealth outcomes. #2018PHI
.@usahluwalia: We're preparing staff to use performance data and we have some data on open source platforms to 1) increase transparency and accountability for our communities, and 2) create opportunity for hackathons to solve our #pophealth challenges. #2018PHI
#2018PHI @usahluwalia from @MoCoDHHS: Preparing our staff to manage data, show potential, get staff excited, asking the right questions.
#2018PHI @usahluwalia from @MoCoDHHS: How to get people out of poverty? You have to address the #SDOH. We're going zip code by zip code to target these interventions.
.@usahluwalia: Our #populationhealth roadmap is built on the social determinants of health. If we don't address the social determinants of health, we can never stop the cycle of health inequities. #2018PHI
#2018PHI @usahluwalia from @MoCoDHHS: We think of our services as a trampoline and focus on the "whole family" practice.
.@usahluwalia: In our integrated system of collaborative practice, there's no "wrong door" for entry; we intake everyone and filter them to the appropriate services.  #2018PHI
https://t.co/fyMr8kO7kf
.@usahluwalia: 1/3 of our clients need 3-4 services when they come in; staff need to know what services the client is receiving; what add'l needs they may have; &amp; what services are available to meet those needs. This is why collaborative practice &amp; integration are key.  #2018PHI
.@usahluwalia: We have begun partnering with the University of Maryland's entities (e.g., pharmacy, social work, corrections) to annually train a cohort of students about collaborative practice.  #2018PHI
@MoCoDHHS’s integration framework #2018PHI https://t.co/QwqX8YLPCQ
#2018PHI @usahluwalia from @MoCoDHHS: For transformation at our health department, we needed practice, people, policy confidentiality, and infrastructure. We had the data, but needed to figure out what we wanted the staff to do with it.
.@usahluwalia: We have to figure out how to integrate data so that we can expand and ease access to our services. #2018PHI
#2018PHI @usahluwalia from @MoCoDHHS talks abut siloed systems: it's inhumane to expect people to tell their stories over and over: we need to figure  how to integrate all that data to help people.
Next up is @usahluwalia from @MoCoDHHS. #2018PHI https://t.co/w7MsgqKsOA
Richards: Despite progress, Q's still remain: How do we ensure data for all our partners? How do preserve confidentiality in an age of discoverability? How do we use data to influence policy? And at what level can we get data to answer the important questions we have? #2018PHI
#2018PHI  @CDCgov's Dr. Chesley Richards: How  do we improve data to improve pop health? For example, connecting health to housing; we need to get better at connecting data to people. It's technology *and* people, not either/or.
Richards: There are many opportunities ahead and the potential for #publichealth informatics is limitless. But we need to get better at connecting data and people to predict health threats or identify them at an earlier stage. #2018PHI
Richards: Since I last spoke at this conference in 2014, we've made progress in public health informatics toward faster and higher quality digital surveillance, routing of data, and electronic reporting for public health through the Digital Bridge. #2018PHI
@CDCgov’s Dr. Chesley Richards is the first to the stage. #2018PHI https://t.co/ewiE9Xvy7c
Dr. Bill Mac Kenzie opens with an African proverb: "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." That's what #2018PHI is all about.

Carmen Orozco-Acosta, @OxfamAmerica: In 2016, 24 million people in 180 countries were displaced by natural disasters, three times as many as displaced by conflict. #climatechange
Trousdale: We need to be considering children's unique vulnerabilities when planning for and responding to natural disasters related to #climatechange. @CEHN
Trousdale: Displacement from home and separation from friends and family members due to natural disasters can affect a child's mental stability, especially for children already at risk. #mentalhealth #climatechange

Gridley-Smith shared local health departments' activities to address climate change and natural disasters, and their effect on health, from @SF_DPH, @AusPublicHealth, and @HealthyBoston in today's Congressional panel hosted by @BennieGThompson.
Gridley-Smith: The lack of direct funding to local health departments stymies efforts to build and expand sustainable #climatechange adaptation and mitigation efforts. #publichealth
Gridley-Smith: While more than half of health department directors acknowledge the health impacts of #climatechange, less than 20% have the resources and expertise needed to assess potential impacts, create effective plans, and protect their community from these health impacts.
Gridley-Smith: NACCHO advocates for national, state, and local policies, regulations, research, and resources that will enhance local health departments’ abilities to prepare for and respond to a changing global and local climate. #climatechange

Gridley-Smith: Limited but emerging data indicate that health, social, and economic costs of #climatechange are vast, with one study estimating health costs of six climate-related events at approximately $14 billion.
Gridley-Smith: The health impacts of #climatechange disproportionately affect already vulnerable or at-risk populations.
Chelsea Gridley-Smith of @NACCHOalerts: Local health departments ensure communities are prepared for, adapted to, and able to mitigate the health risks from the built and natural environment, and in effect build resilience to #climatechange and natural disasters.
.@mdhDuBois We have to balance development with environmental conservation and engage communities early and often to ensure equity and resilience. #climatechange #publichealth

A3. Slayton: Our pharmacy division has been actively involved in looking at prescribing practices, and through behavioral health we've looked at opioid treatment centers in communities. #NA18
Q3: What kind of strategies or partnerships are you pursuing to help people who are dependent on opioids, but not yet categorized as experiencing opioid use disorder? #NA18
A2. Azuma: We try to be reflective and think about what expertise we bring and what areas we may not have core competencies and could benefit from partnerships. #NA18
A2: Eversley: Understand the power of local engagement. It's important to give a voice and platform to the community-based organizations &amp; the everyday citizen. Folks in the community and on the ground want to be empowered -not just thru funding, but thru education, too. #NA18
A2. Slayton: Cast a very wide net. There's a lot of interest in getting involved with health-related projects that are atypical for business. #NA18
Q2: Earlier, we heard the @Surgeon_General's tagline about "better health through better partnerships." What's one suggestion you have for creating power through partnerships? #NA18
A1. Eversley: There is always opportunity, and as a corporate funder partnerships are key. We have a wealth of platforms to collaborate. #NA18
Q1: How can  local health departments (or the orgs that support them get involved in the public-private partnerships and projects you've described today? #NA18
Azuma: We need the power of partnership to create healthy people and healthy communities. #NA18 #publichealth
Ready for some Q&amp;A with the panel? #NA18
Azuma: None of this work happens with us working alone. There are so many opportunities for collaboration with local health departments and to build bridges between health care and social services organizations. #NA18
Azuma: @KPShare is putting our money where our mouth is and engaging all our assets to create a total health impact. #NA18 https://t.co/ESAOzPi0mS
Azuma: We're rethinking the everyday business decisions we make and asking ourselves how we can act in our business practices to take health and equity into consideration. #NA18
Azuma; We're also working to identify resources in communities beyond just state and federal programs and including locally-based resources. This is an area rich in cross-sector partnerships, and we're trying to take advantage of that. #NA18
Azuma: We want to help understand what programs are working best for our members so we can replicate and scale these interventions to reach more people. #NA18
Azuma; Through this program, we also discovered that many of our members are eligible for other programs but aren't currently receiving those benefits. By linking these people to services, we're getting them more money and resources to support better health outcomes. #NA18
Azuma shares an example of how Hunger Free Colorado is using policy change + systems change + social change + collaboration to end hunger and food insecurity in the state. #NA18
Azuma: At least 4 million of @KPShare's 12 million members live at or below 250% of the federal poverty level. Pressing needs include food, transportation, and housing, so addressing social, non-medical needs is key to overall health. #NA18
Azuma; As a long-standing, mission-based, integrative network, we have the resources and relationships to make a difference and our community health strategy recognizes and leverages that interplay to increase and improve health access. #NA18
Azuma: We know that we cannot limit our view of health to healthcare because the evidence shows, and we understand, that health goes beyond payers and providers. #NA18
Azuma: At the same time, we also know that we can never achieve community health unless we achieve health at the individual level. #NA18
Azuma: We truly believe that healthy communities and healthy people are inextricably linked. @KPShare @KPCommHealth #NA18
Next up is @KPShare's (and @KPCommHealth's) Andrea Azuma! #NA18
Slayton: Food insecure patients are more likely to develop chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. #NA18
Here’s the structural approach being taken in Louisville: #NA18 https://t.co/S7XHVdMes1
Slayton: @Humana is approaching this through a shared-value approach, the concept that by doing social good, you can succeed in a business setting. #NA18
Slayton: @Humana's method includes (1) Collective impact model/convening stakeholders; (2) social determinants of health; and (3) research, healthy days measurement &amp; scale. #NA18
Slayton: .@Humana serves as a convener for the Clinical Town Halls; we don't necessarily lead them, but we do serve to incentivize individuals and organizations to come to the table to talk. #NA18
Slayton: To identify which health conditions and barriers pose the greatest opportunity, @Humana looks at data, engages in conversations, and bring together leaders to align on what's most meaningful to the community. #NA18
Slayton: Physical health, mental health, and even environmental changes like climate changes can affect the number of health days reported. #NA18
Slayton: We measure progress with the metric of "healthy days" - and we use it because it's a very personal, individual measure. It's not a traditional quality of life measure but it allows individuals themselves to tell the provider what may be impacting their health.  #NA18
Slayton: @Humana set a bold goal: 20% healthier by 2020. We make it easier for individuals to achieve their best health. #NA18
Next to the stage is Dr. Val Slayton from @Humana. #NA18
Eversley: The data is the means, not the end, to working together to build healthier communities. #NA18
Eversley: The @Aetna Foundation collaborated with @usnews to showcase healthiest communities rankings. https://t.co/PaWMs9Xz4k #NA18
Eversley: Through all this work, the Challenge hopes to advance community health by empowering communities to do the following: #NA18 https://t.co/qDVL5tfw64
Eversley: One of the most important components of this challenge is our collaborative network that creates an interactive platform for collaboration, community engagement, and communication by providing technical assistance and a learning network. #NA18
Learn more about the HealthyCommunity50, the Healthiest Cities &amp; Counties Challenge finalists: https://t.co/AzP8NaoWUv #NA18 @Aetna @PublicHealth @NACoTweets
Eversley: Our "Healthy Community 50" Finalists have showed marked progress in addressing the social determinants of health through initiatives like community gardens, increased pedestrian access, pop up produce markets, etc. #NA18
Eversley: The Healthiest Cities &amp; Counties Challenge focuses on five health improvement area: healthy behaviors, built environment, community safety, social/economic factors, and environmental exposure. #NA18
Eversley: The vision for the Healthiest Cities and Counties Challenge is to support communities in their collaorative efforts to become healthier places to live, learn, work, play, and pray through strong cross-sector, cross-generational teams. #NA18
Eversley: @Aetna Foundation's Healthiest Cities &amp; Counties Challenge launched in 2016 to provide support to organizations working on local health issues at a local level. #NA18
Eversley: As research shows, where a person resides is just as good of a health indicator as a person's genetic makeup. There are factors outside of the doctor's office that impact a person's life expectancy. #NA18
First to the stage is Ace Eversley! #NA18
Jacob: Payers and health systems have an important and emerging role in achieving population health gains. Clinical interventions remain necessary, but are no longer sufficient to control costs or achieve continued improvements in population health. #NA18
Today's panel is moderated by @CambHealth's Chief Public Health Officer, Claude Jacob, and features Alan Eversley, Program Consultant for @Aetna Foundation; Dr. Val Slayton, Regional VP for Health Services at @Humana; and Andrea Azuma, Dir. of @KPCommHealth Improvement. #NA18
Thank you to @CDCDirector Dr. Redfield for joining us at #NA18, sharing your very personal story, and highlighting your priorities for @CDCgov and its partners. NACCHO looks forward to continuing to help @cdcgov carry out its work. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: My blood bleeds #publichealth. I do think we can achieve all these priorities, but to do this we need your help and I look forward to working with you. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: There are two approaches to public health: individual to family to community to population - or population to community to family to individual. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: And, of course, we can't forget chronic disease - obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, Infectious diseases tend to get all the attention, but chronic disease continues to impact many of our nation's people in lasting ways. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Vaccination is the best way we have to confront infectious disease, and it's the only way we have to eliminate infectious disease. #NA18 #VaccinesWork
.@CDCDirector: Many states are way behind on the HPV vaccine for both men and women. This vaccine is cancer prevention and we all need to work to increase #HPV immunization rates. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: You're innovative public health people. Let's figure out how to get Hepatitis C therapy to the people that need it and eliminate Hepatitis C in America. #publichealthchallenge #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Very proud of the U.S. for having the 21st Century Cures Act, but we also need to have an approach for 21st-Century implementation of the cures we find. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: I want to challenge you to all work together so we can bring an end to the AIDS epidemic. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: We now know that if we can get people diagnosed - and you all are on the frontline - and we can get them on treatment and virally suppressed, they can not just thrive in life, but worry less about transmitting the virus: "undetectable = untransmittable." #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Lastly, science on the shelf is of no value, so disease elimination is important to me. By preventing and, better yet, eliminating diseases, we are making science really work for us. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: An important part of global health security is to increase the capacity of host nations to prevent, detect, and respond to new pathogens. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: The Ebola and Zika outbreaks woke the world to the number of different pathogens globally and the effect they can have abroad and at home. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Antimicrobial resistance is another threat. A number of bacteria are no longer susceptible to antibiotics. We've seen highly resistant gonorrhea and typhoid fever so far. Antibiotic prescribing practices &amp; antimicrobial stewardship ae going to be important. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: The most important way to improve flu vaccine efficacy is to get people immunized against the flu. #NA18 #publichealth
.@CDCDirector: Less than 50% of Americans actually get vaccinated for flu - this continues to be an important challenge for us all. There are important scientific questions about flu vaccine efficacy and we plan to facilitate that type of research. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Global health security is another main CDC priority, and pandemic flu continues to be a serious threat for us. It's not a matter of "if" we need to confront the flu, but when. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: We also continue to face other challenging outbreaks (e.g., foodborne, synthetic marijuana, Legionnaire's). You all are the people that first detect them and do the #publichealth work to prevent them from spreading. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Through the power of science, the power of public health, and the power of medicine, we are close to overcoming HIV, and we will also overcome the opioid crisis. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Finally, we have to educate the American public about the potential for addiction with prescribed opioids. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: CDC has worked hard to develop guidelines for chronic pain control, including looking at alternatives to opioids. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: CDC is also working on guidelines. We in the medical community have to accept some responsibility - we played a role in creating an environment that allowed opioid use and abuse to proliferate. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Doctors and nurses and health systems need to be a part of he public health response to the Opioid crisis so we can get better real-time data. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: For CDC, one of the things we're trying to do is get data and information more quickly. A big goal is to try to accelerate the ability to have real-time data; we can't end the #opioidepidemic using data that's 18-months old. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: When you look at our care delivery systems to treat addiction, some of them actually reinforce stigma through verbal and non-verbal ways. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Even when my own son came to ask for help, he was so ashamed that he had become a regular user of cocaine. Words like "disorder" and "addict" are still being used - we need to continue to destigmatize our language so we can destigmatize the condition. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: When I look back at the AIDS epidemic, one of the greatest challenges we faced was the stigma associated with HIV infection. Today, stigma is an even greater challenge with the Opioid epidemic. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: Thinking back 40 years, there's similarities now between the #opioidepidemic and the #HIVepidemic, in terms of the number of people affected. And for me, it's personal. I almost lost one of my children to it. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: One of CDC's main priorities is the Opioid and drug-overdose epidemic. #NA18
.@CDCDirector: In order for CDC to do its efforts, its largely through the help and support our partners, including NACCHO and its members. #NA18
Next, we warmly welcome @CDCDirector Dr. Robert Redfield to the stage for some remarks. #NA18 https://t.co/rrFWOXbRPz
.@RexArcherMD is three followers away from hitting 2,000. Let's help him out!! #NA18

Lori Tremmel Freeman: Hopefully you’re leaving this conference inspired and taking home with you a toolbox of strategies—and new friends—to help you tackle the public health challenges in your community. #NA18
#NA18: The final plenary featuring @CDCDirector Robert Redfield, Andrea Azuma, Ace Eversley, Val Slayton, and Claude-Alix Jacob starts now. https://t.co/FJeTMYVqo4
#NA18: We're moments away from the final plenary, Unleashing the Power of Payers to Improve Population Health.
#NA18: The final plenary will highlight some of the most innovative payers and integrated health systems in the nation and their efforts to move beyond a clinical scope to achieve improvements in population health.

Harris: Trust and relationships have been a cornerstone of our work, and the most successful path to building a healthy and resilient community. #NA18 @nolahealthdept
Harris: We've found success by listening to our community's voice, understanding their needs, and involving and engaging them to make sure the programs being developed will be of use to them. #NA18
Harris: FitNOLA is another shining initiative in our city. It impacts communities through physical fitness and healthy eating, but also our local governmental staff through employee incentive programs. #NA18
NACCHO's Congressional Action Network needs you!	 https://t.co/RphoFKFGEM
Harris: Given the health disparities in New Orleans, the @nolahealthdept sought to physically locate health services in communities with the most need. #NA18
Harris: New Orleans' local government system has also made a commitment to addressing equity. #NA18
Harris: Our health department has begun to use a Health in All Policies approach, and we weave equity across all of our priorities. #NA18 @nolahealthdept
Harris: Our culture in New Orleans is helping to build and rebuild a new hope for future generations to enjoy and be a part of. #NA18

Alexander-Scott: The @ASTHO President’s Challenge needs NACCHO members’ input. Connect and share your thoughts! #NA18 https://t.co/9qZraJu2bh
Alexander-Scott: The @Surgeon_General's model of "better health through better partnerships" is an important piece of this work. #NA18
Alexander-Scott: Achieving the challenge will require us to rethink how we should work with communities and who our partners should be. #NA18
Alexander-Scott quotes @JonathanGoyer , Expert Advisor to the RI Governor's Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force: "The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety. It's connectedness." #NA18 @RIHEALTH
Alexander-Scott: The @ASTHO President's Challenge will promote positive social connectivity and improve community resilience. #NA18
Alexander-Scott: This is an opportunity to go from talking about #healthequity to now collaboratively implementing opportunities at the national, state, and local levels to address equity. #NA18
Alexander-Scott: Effective community-led, place-based collectives offer a ready-made investment opportunity for business leaders and policy-makers as sustainable funding that supports the community and public health. #NA18
Alexander-Scott: As governmental public health officials working together in environmental and social determinants of health, we can accomplish disease elimination. #NA18
Alexander-Scott: Investments in community-led, place-based approaches empower communities, transform systems and policies long-term, address determinants of health disease elimination (#HIV, #HepC, violence) and limit the harms of gentrification. #NA18
Alexander-Scott: The second goal is to connect #publichealth officials to business leaders and policymakers who want to invest in community-led, place-based approaches and advance community development by reaching cross-sector to include non-traditional partners. #NA18
Alexander-Scott: @ASTHO, @NACCHOalerts &amp; @Surgeon_General will provide tools to health officials for the mobilization of community-led, place-based collectives that use an outcome driven cross sector approach to build stronger communities. #NA18
Alexander-Scott: The 2018-2019 @ASTHO challenge calls on health officials to "Build Healthy and Resilient Communities" by supporting investments in community-led place-based approaches. #NA18 @RIHEALTH

Freeman: If you are the top official in your organization, encourage junior colleagues and rising stars to get involved so that we can build the leaders of tomorrow. Remember, your local health department is our member, and this includes all of the staff of your agency. #NA18
Freeman: Join the Congressional Action Network. Submit an abstract to our conferences. Apply to be on a NACCHO Workgroup. There's lots of ways to get involved. #NA18
Freeman: It takes your continued engagement to ensure NACCHO is responsive, relevant, and member-driven. NACCHO is your professional home and we encourage you to get involved. #NA18
Freeman: All of our work is for naught if LHDs and other stakeholders don’t know about it. We strive to amplify our message, and last year, NACCHO published over 650 blog posts, issued 75 publications, and earned nearly 5,000 reputable media mentions. #NA18
Freeman: The NACCHO Consulting team helps local health departments realize partnerships, catalyze community engagement, enhance workforce training and leadership skills, and facilitate dynamic and effective meetings: https://t.co/z3c0YdqqjL #NA18
Freeman: NACCHO's Adaptive Leadership Program helps LHDs and their staff adapt and succeed in challenging environments through the gradual but meaningful process of change. Last year, we trained 160 cross-sector professionals through the program. #NA18
Freeman: In March, NACCHO hosted its first #vectorcontrol summit to provide training, education, peer-to-peer learning, and capacity-building activities for local vector-control organizations: 	https://t.co/sL25Gm7MeO #NA18
Freeman: The #opioidepidemic took center stage in the last year. Through partnerships &amp; funding support, NACCHO provided funding and technical assistance to LHDs to implement innovative and collaborative efforts to combat the crisis in their communities. #NA18
Freeman: This year, we’ve awarded 29 model practices and 52 promising practices, which will be added to the NACCHO Model Practices Database: https://t.co/XuimqcRwGn #NA18
Freeman: At the core of NACCHO’s mission to strengthen LHDs is the need to shine a spotlight on innovation in local #publichealth practice. Our Model Practices Program is a great mechanism to share and be recognized for your LHD's forward-thinking, peer-tested solutions. #NA18
Freeman: This past year, we released findings from the 2017 Forces of Change survey, which focuses on a handful of timely #publichealth issues: 	https://t.co/tFHJcZlHgI #NA18
Freeman: NACCHO’s research efforts are critical to providing an accurate picture of the local realities you face. If you haven't already, check out the 2017 Forces of Change survey results, which focus on a handful of timely #publichealth issues. 	https://t.co/tFHJcZlHgI #NA18
Freeman: NACCHO’s research efforts are critical to providing an accurate picture of the local realities facing our members. #NA18
Freeman: NACCHO serves as a home for all LHDs, whether large and urban, small and rural, or in between. Because of your diversity, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions. Through initiatives like the Rural Health Section, we're making strides to better support you all. #NA18
Freeman: NACCHO’s Big Cities Health Coalition comprises the leaders of America’s largest metropolitan health departments and continues to effectively promote and protect the health and safety of the 55 million people they serve: https://t.co/GWAfpSMWmk #NA18
Freeman: In the words of Mark Zuckerberg, “the only risk is not taking any risk, in a world that is changing really quickly the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.” #NA18
Freeman: The NACCHO Board has been hard at work this year developing a new set of strategic priorities. This plan will serve as a road map for everything that we do to serve our membership and keep NACCHO strong going forward: https://t.co/YTOnXIzgBe #NA18
Freeman: The past year has been a time of transition for NACCHO. Like any good organization exploring ways to grow and flourish, we haven’t been afraid to take a few risks to move us forward &amp; we learn something new about ourselves, even if things don’t always go our way. #NA18
Freeman: As we face new and evolving challenges, the work of county and local health departments has perhaps never been more important to the health and well-being of our communities and our country. #NA18
Freeman: We continue to have to fight hard to keep prevention and public health both funded AND valued and to educate our lawmakers of its vital importance. #NA18
Freeman: Even though I’ve only been away 4 ½ years or so, the organization has continued to evolve and change. More often than not, this is due to the field of public health facing new and different challenges. #NA18
Freeman: It’s really great to be back at NACCHO – like returning ‘home’ in many respects. #NA18

A3. @choucair: So many people are just one paycheck away from being homeless. Grants help, but we need partnerships to create systems changes to create lasting solutions. #NA18
Q3. With high housing costs, is $2 million enough to handle a problem with national dimensions? #NA18
A2: @SarahKCMO: Once you have the data, It's important to empower the people represented to tell their own stories. #NA18
A2. @AndreQuintero: Data can be more effective when it is communicated from people in the community, and not from your staff. #NA18
A2: @ColleenBridger: @FrameWorksInst is a good resource. They do a great job helping organizations figure out how to present data through storytelling so that it resonates better with people. #NA18
A2. @ColleenBridger: Figure out where folks are and meet them there to walk through the wonderful world of data. You have to get to know people and where they're coming from and how to speak their language. #NA18
Q2: It's discouraging that people don't believe data and evidence. What successes and challenges have you had with sharing data? #NA18
A1. @choucair: Always think about policy as a marathon as opposed to a sprint, and always keep in mind implementation and enforcement. #NA18
A1. @choucair: The issues with policies when they pass is there's always an attempt to water them down. #NA18
A1: @sarahkcmo: Communication is key. Finding the right message and testing that message - with both the community and elected officials - is important. #NA18
A1. @ColleenBridger: The people who are your opposition for one particular policy can become your advocates for another policy, so don't destroy the relationship you have with them. You may need them later. #NA18
A1: @AndreQuintero: We were able to connect with city leadership, learned we needed to work closer with school systems, and, as a result, other cities were able to take our lessons and find success. #NA18
A1: @AndreQuintero: Sometimes there are battles you have to fight that may not turn out the way you want them to, but you learn a lot from them, and you can learn to counter the issues the other side raises. #NA18
Q1: What policy initiatives have you pushed forward that failed, and what lessons did you learn? #NA18
Next up is the Q&amp;A! #NA18
.@choucair: Housing and health are closely connected. Recognizing this, we recently made a commitment to invest $200M thru our Thriving Communities Fund to Preserve and Expand Affordable Housing. #NA18
.@choucair: Housing and homelessness are a big deal in all of our cities. The Mayors &amp; CEOs for US Housing Investment partnership is pursuing federal policy proposals to support affordable housing. #NA18
.@choucair: We have to focus on the conditions of health and equity in order to achieve our community health (and thus, population health) goals. @city_health is really focused on this work. #NA18
.@choucair: Over 1,000 policies have been adopted in the 337 "Healthy Eating Active Living" cities, representing over 20 million people. #NA18
.@choucair: We hope that our $2M investment in this research will be a rallying cry to get others in the healthcare and public health space to make their own commitments to creating more robust research foundation for gun violence. #NA18
.@choucair: After noticing we were treating lots of firearm injuries, we created a task force to figure out how we can support research to prevent firearm-related injury and death. #NA18
.@choucair: Our strategy around community health boils down to serving individuals with top-notch clinical care and wraparound services, improving conditions for health and equity by engaging the people in them, and advancing the future of health by innovating. #NA18
.@choucair: While most health systems get reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis, we don't. We are an integrated health care system. We have the incentive to keep you healthy. #NA18 @KPShare @KPCommHealth
.@choucair: There's no way we can maximize health if we only focus on healthcare. Have to think about social and economic factors and the built environment in addition to personal behaviors. #NA18
.@choucair: There's no way we can optimize the health of our 12.2 million members if we don't improve the conditions for health and equity where those members live. #NA18
.@choucair: We can't improve the health of communities if we don't improve the health of individuals. #NA18
.@choucair: Health is not limited to the four walls of our hospitals and doctors offices. Health starts in our communities. #NA18
.@choucair: As the health system we come to health policy work and #communityhealth work with humility and a lot of curiosity. #NA18 @KPCommHealth @KPShare
.@choucair: @KPShare is the largest integrated health system in the nation and has had the same mission for the last 75 years: improve the health and well-being of our members and of communities. #NA18
Our final speaker for today is Dr. Bechara Choucair (@choucair), Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Community Health Officer at Kaiser Permanente (@KPShare). #NA18 https://t.co/hxfw3m9CIm
.@SarahKCMO: You can't promote Health in All Policies but then say people can't run the health department because they don't have an MPH. #NA18 #publichealth @KCMOHealthDept
. @SarahKCMO: As you move to unleash the power of policy &amp; compile data that can serve as evidence points, beware of pitches from tech companies trying to sell you the latest data/analytics tools. Remember that whatever we do has to be human-centered and user-centered. #NA18
Typical nutrition label? Look again. This is how @KCMOHealthDept displayed obesity statistics for policymakers. @SarahKCMO #NA18 https://t.co/qL1qfVrnPu
.@sarahkcmo: You want to be the credible, indispensable source for elected officials. Testify more. Listen for misinformation and hand out fact sheets. Just talking to them can go a long way. #NA18
.@SarahKCMO: Data is important, but it only helps policy to the extent that your elected officlas believe it, esp. when it comes to racial disparities. But we have to keep pushing because if public health isn't talking about racial equity, no one's talking about it. #NA18
.@SarahKCMO: It comes down to being an "empire builder." It's about using your relationships to integrate yourself and the needs of your communities into the rest of your local government's efforts. #NA18
.@SarahKCMO: Make the right choice the easiest choice for elected officials. #NA18
.@SarahKCMO: As we're asked to engage in more social and economic policy, we have to figure out how to build up our workforce to be able to do this. Public health isn't overflowing with public policy experts, but we need to find a wayfor our people to get involved. #NA18
.@SarahKCMO: Policy is action as well as inaction. A lot of the things we're trying to undo were done by policy. #NA18
.@sarahkcmo: You do have to be moderate and play nice to make policy, BUT someone has to step up and be courageous. #NA18
.@SarahKCMO: We moved from bronze to silver this year and we're very proud of how far we've come.  #NA18
Next, Dr. Sarah Martin (@SarahKCMO), Deputy Director of the City of Kansas City, MO Health Department (@KCMOHealthDept). #NA18 https://t.co/mNtyDKxGdb

.@AndreQuintero: We're in the process of developing a parks master plan so we can revitalize existing parks and acquire open spaces for new parks. #NA18
.@AndreQuintero: If you have a park very close to where you live, you're more likely to use it. #NA18
.@AndreQuintero: You have to be collaborative with other cities to make things work, like the comprehensive bicycle network in El Monte and five surrounding towns. #NA18
.@AndreQuintero: We're investing over $2.6M in our health and wellness programs, out of a general $60M budget. That's a small amount, but we're still recovering from the recession. Eventually, we'd like to dedicate more $$$. #NA18
.@AndreQuintero: How do we create a healthy community? Enhance land use and community design, create a healthy transportation system, increase the number of park and trails, provide safe access to healthy foods, and more. #NA18
.@AndreQuintero: In response, we added a health and wellness element to our city's vision. It talks about air quality, safe and effective transportation, promoting physical activity, food access, safe neighborhoods, and high-quality healthcare and mental health services. #NA18
.@AndreQuintero: In 2007, we had higher prevalence of obese and overweight constituents and heart attacks than the state, and lower prevelance of physical activity. #NA18
.@AndreQuintero: Thank you for devoting your lives to #publichealth and to our communities across the country. #NA18

.@ColleenBridger: Policy is the buzzsaw in your toolbox. You need to keep your blade sharpened for it to be effective and if you take your eye off it for one second, things can go terribly wrong. #NA18
Those of us back here at @NACCHOalerts HQ in DC send wildly enthusiastic congratulations to Dom! 💥 https://t.co/T5MRabNOER
.@ColleenBridger: There are plenty of conservative areas where progressive public health policies have passed. I don't need to convince you that policy is one of the most effective power tools we have in our public health toolbox. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: In getting policy passed, a lot of times it comes down to what the constituency wants. Elected officials who want to keep their jobs are likely to take the action that the majority of their constituency is demanding. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: Everyone in this room has heard some variation of "I don't believe your science" over the years. #NA18
@NACCHOalerts https://t.co/MYRnLaMmUQ
.@ColleenBridger: I once had a Commissioner who told me, "I don't believe your science." That says a lot about how we need to be framing policy conversations. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: Few of us get hands-on training about how to get policy passed; instead, we're trained on the science behind policy. I'm here to tell you: science doesn't get policy passed. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: PUP is the most controversial aspect of Tobacco 21. Do you give consequences to youth, or just retailers? In San Antonio we decided to only penalize retailers. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: Be prepared for retail pushback. But we also had pushback on the pushback from the Chambers. Just because some tobacco retailers are against this, it doesn't mean a majority of businesses in your city are as well. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: Our most effective talking point was referencing back to the survey that said the community wanted #Tobacco21. By directing the conversation back to that data point, we were able to keep elected officials committed. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: Lessons learned from Tobacco 21: Work with the advocacy community; practice open, honest, and redundant communication; be prepared for retail push back. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: One compromise we had to make was not being able to do targeted ordinance checks in locations that needed #Tobacco21 most. But we settled on random sampling for checks and that's working, too. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: The biggest question I get is about enforcement, and it varies across the nation. But the recommended model is for the local health department to enforce the ordinance. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: In San Antonio we held meetings for those we knew were opposed to Tobacco 21 to address their specific concerns, as well as open community meetings. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: In San Antonio, we had weekly meetings with partners to discuss  who was going to do what. You need to have a really comprehensive coalition to make #Tobacco21 work. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: One of the push-backs when you implement Tobacco 21 at city/county level is people will go across city lines to purchase tobacco, but we have still seen a decrease in high school smoking. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: #Tobacco21 started in 2014 and has swept the nation unlike any #publichealth initiative I've seen. 310 + cities and counties in 20 states have implemented the initiative and 30% of Americans are covered. #NA18
.@ColleenBridger: If we can delay the age of first tobacco use and keep tobacco out of schools, we can decrease tobacco use among high school students. #NA18 @SAMetroHealth
.@ColleenBridger: DYK? 95% of adults who currently smoke started before they were 21. In addition, only 2% of tobacco sold is purchased by 18-20 year olds, but that two percent supplies 90% of tobacco products to younger folks. #NA18
Next up is Dr. Colleen Bridger (@colleenbridger), Health Director for San Antonio Metropolitan Health District (@SAMetroHealth) #NA18 https://t.co/wBtRkjx9aW
.@deBeaumontFndtn (Patterson):  You don't have to have all nine policies on the books to receive a gold medal - you only need five, which makes this goal more achievable. #NA18

A5. @WaHealthSec: Show that you value the work they've done, and show how those skills are transferable to the work ahead. #NA18
A5: @KBDeSalvo: Have distance learning and other learning opportunities for the incumbent workforce. Leverage your existing personnel and help them get comfortable modernizing. #NA18
A5. @KBDeSalvo: Our strategy was to have all the staff be a part of the visioning and the change, and to do as much individual assessment of skills and abilities as possible, showing people their skills could be applied in different ways. #NA18
Q5: When a local health department has diversified its workforce, those who have been there for years (or decades, maybe) may feel left out or left behind. What advice do you have about supporting organizational transformation? #NA18
A4: @HealthyBoston: We have to change the perception that people are going to enter the health department and stay for 20 years. Have to be able to demonstrate innovation, opportunity, and upward mobility in order to recruit and retain talented staff. #NA18
A4: @WaHealthSec: All of us should be striving to be an "employer of choice" and we can do that by thinking about value-adds that are not explicitly financial, but help staff in ways that are critical. #NA18
A4. @WaHealthSec: It isn't just about the money. How do we make ourselves the employer of choice? Look at other benefits people care about, such as work-life balance. #NA18
RT @ChrissieJuliano: Yes! More #publichealth dollars need to get #local! https://t.co/xwGwII7f8A
Q4: When #publichealth is playing the role of "Chief Health Strategist," we help communities and bring value to organizations outside of the health department. Are there examples of how to bring add'l compensation (e.g., student loan payback) to reward frontline staff? #NA18
A3. @KBDeSalvo The language matters as we go to policymakers and funders, but it can also be off-putting. Most importantly we need to foster community trust, no matter the titles. #NA18
Q3: When there's another health system in your jurisdiction trying to stake the claim as "Chief Health Strategist," how do you have a conversation about taking over and/or sharing that role and stage? #NA18
A2. @KBDeSalvo We as a country have to figure out how we change the game and invest upstream. We can move the dial but we also need to figure out how to move the money. #NA18

.@mvlupi: The growth and evolution of public health isn't a new concept, but it's difficult to see the future because it's always in motion. #NA18
Our final speaker for the opening session is Monica Valdes Lupi (@mvlupi), Executive Director of @HealthyBoston. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: We can do this. We can rise to the challenge. We can unleash the power of #publichealth and we're going to do it by unleashing our workforce. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: 3 Actions for Success Planning: Commit to your own development and that of your staff, pick a best practice and try it out, and get a buddy to do the same thing. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: And of course, don't let your high performance-high potential staff get away. Find opportunities that enable them to grow personally and professionally so that they feel appropriately challenged and committed to the work. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: Goal-setting should be done with every employee. There's nothing special to this, but many of us still don't take the time to go through this process with staff. #NA18
@WaHealthSec: Goal setting should happen every day with every employee, and it should go into performance reviews. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: Coaching and mentoring is incredibly important, but often get confused. Coaches can help track/support skill development and performance, whereas a mentor gives a broader, 360-degree support system for professional growth. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: If you have a union, engage them from the beginning and work together on a plan for employee development. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: Employee development is key. As we develop people, we need to broaden their scopes of work. #Publichealth can silo us into specific topic areas, but it's important to allow people to build expertise and skillsets across the organization. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: How do you select high-performing, high-potential employees? Look outside the people you already know. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: There are 25 practices for talent development that can help us select and retain the best people for our work. #NA18
.@WaHealthSec: Commit to taking some kind of action. Public health officials have an imperative to stand up and implement succession planning. #NA18
Next up is John Wiesman, @WaHealthSec. #NA18
.@KBDeSalvo: For people to achieve the quality of health they deserve, we have to address all the social determinants of health. #Publichealth cannot do it alone, but we are a natural and logical leader. Embrace this role. #NA18
.@KBDeSalvo: In every department, we all have to be chief health strategists. It's not just the leadership - it's everyone. #NA18
.@KBDeSalvo: Building partnerships can help build capacity in health departments that don't have everything they need internally. #NA18
@KBDeSalvo: #Publichealth is interesting because we are the only members of the community that have an imperative to see to it that people in our communities are healthy and well. #NA18
.@KBDeSalvo: These are the five recommendations for propelling #publichealth forward: #NA18 https://t.co/vQrwxWOGrN
.@KBDeSalvo: #PublicHealth 3.0 has five component areas: leadership and workforce; essential infrastructure; strategic partnerships; data, analytics and metrics; and flexible and sustainable funding. #NA18
.@KBDeSalvo: The Public Health 3.0 definition is more important than ever: #Publichealth is what we do together as a society to ensure the conditions in which everyone can be healthy. #NA18 https://t.co/JbE2icRAvF
@KBDeSalvo talks about the evolution of public health. #NA18 https://t.co/5N8Jp9Skh5
.@KBDeSalvo: We need a modern #publichealth workforce and structure because we're facing modern public health issues. But also, people are dying of deaths of despair; hopelessness &amp; lack of opportunity (educational, economic) are manifesting themselves in people's health. #NA18
Now joining @BrianCCastrucci on the stage to continue the conversation: @KBDeSalvo @WaHealthSec @mvlupi #NA18 https://t.co/cQHYclOC1o
.@BrianCCastrucci: As part of the #publichealth workforce, you are really our only hope to getting to a place where our health workforce is ready to take on all the health challenges including those that we know are coming and those that will blindside us. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci PH Wins is not a research project. This is a national workforce survey to drive action. #NA18 @deBeaumontFndtn
.@BrianCCastrucci: We've never had a point of comparison for our whole workforce, but now we do. With that, we encourage you to field some or all of the survey at your own health depts. If your org. is too small to ensure anonymity, use the national data as a talking point. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci: The data we've collected from the PH WINS survey gives us a baseline of understanding. What we need now is your help in assuring we have workforce development efforts in every state, local, and tribal health department. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci: Nearly 40% of the #publichealth workforce hasn't heard much about multi-sector partnerships and more than 1/3 say it won't impact their day-to-day lives. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci 34% of LHD executives think influencing policy is highly important, but they have low ability to do so. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci: Continued improvement in our nation's health is going to lie in our ability to build partnerships and influence policy so that we can create health equity. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci: To fix this, we have to improve compensation and increase opportunities to advance. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci: 39% of the public health workforce will be leaving in the next five years; more than half of those will leave in the next year. And we're not just losing people to retirement, it's for other jobs and even other fields. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci shares this graphic of the thought process of a modern “knowledge-worker.” https://t.co/NlrYRf4pwG
@BrianCCastrucci: Creativity is the knowledge worker's currency, and it is key to worker engagement and problem solving. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci: When people in DC want to hear wgat #publichealth thinks, they often look to local health officials for their thoughts. That's valid, but we also need to be getting the perspective of the other 99% working on the ground. #NA18
The Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS) is the first nationally representative survey of individual state health agency workers: https://t.co/v2G1hQGFri @BrianCCastrucci @deBeaumontFndtn #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci: Workforce development must be seen as an integral component of every outcomes-based initiative we do. In #publichealth, our people are our biggest asset. We have to really think about how we invest in that asset. #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci We need a coordinated, thoughtful workforce development effort to reach clearly articulated workforce development goals. #NA18 @deBeaumontFndtn
.@BrianCCastrucci: Public health workers influence all parts of the #publichealth system and, as a result, impact the health of the communities they serve. But we have to ask ourselves: are we doing enough to ensure we have the workforce we need? #NA18
.@BrianCCastrucci We cannot unleash the power of #publichealth unless we unleash the power of the public health workforce #NA18 @deBeaumontFndtn
Today’s plenary is being moderated by Brian Castrucci (@BrianCCastrucci), Chief Program and Strategy Officer at @deBeaumontFndtn. https://t.co/OWb0lwtuAa
.@mbrhc: Together, we will advance our association, meet the needs of our members, and improve our public's health. #NA18
@HCSMnews @HoustonHealth @ushahmd @hcphtx Visibility, value, and validation. 💪
@mbrhc: I urge all of you to tell your stories, share them with each other and your communities, spread the public health word, and inspire others as your have inspired me. #NA18
.@mbrhc: Working as a team, public health will succeed in making our communities healthier. Our history and experiences inform our future, and knowing our history will help us avoid past mistakes, build success for the future, and tell our story. #NA18
.@mbrhc: And, of course, continued partnership development and relationship-building is essential. To the extent possible, we must speak collectively and with one voice. #NA18
.@mbrhc: Education of communities is important to all health depts., but critical in small and medium-sized jurisdictions. We must empower people to develop locally-led initiatives that improve community health. #NA18
.@mbrhc: As I look at my priorities for the upcoming year, I hope to find ways to serve all local health departments equitably so that they can thrive in serving their communities. #NA18
.@kevingsumner: We need to find ways to support all health departments equitably so they thrive while serving their communities #NA18 #healthequity
.@kevingsumner: NACCHO is one of the most effective #publichealth teams I have had the pleasure and honor to be associated with. #NA18
.@mbrhc: Over the past 33 years, I have learned the value of public health and local health departments. #Publichealth, much like life in general, is a team sport and it takes all of us to accomplish the great things we do. #NA18

.@ushahmd passes the gavel on to the 2018-2019 NACCHO President, Kevin G. Sumner, Health Officer and Director of Middle-Brook Regional Health Commission (@mbrhc). #NA18 https://t.co/COzwS0Mdq5
.@ushahmd: When our Visible work is Valued, we see Validation through investment in people, policies, and resources. And when public health succeeds, we all succeed. it all starts by raising your local health department's profile. #NA18
.@ushahmd: When we remain invisible, other sectors get credit for our work. Don't be invisible, and change the narrative. The future of our field relies on it. #NA18
.@ushahmd:  Each and every one of you are dedicated, passionate, and work very hard. And that work means something, even if others don't see the value. But there is a solution: the three V's of public health. #NA18
.@ushahmd I appreciate the resiliency of this field and the untold stories of why what we do matters. We have an incredibly noble and humble field with a lot of heart but not a lot of brand recognition. #NA18
.@ushahmd: We have an incredibly noble and humble field with a LOT of heart, but not a lot of recognition. We're facing an "invisibility crisis" in #publichealth. Like the offensive line of a football team, we do the dirty work but don't get the credit that the QB does. #NA18

A5: Always remember “Get Inside, Stay Inside, Stay Tuned.” Other topics include; notification of emergency, how to stay safe, decontamination procedures, info on water and food consumption, air quality, evacuation and CRC info, 1st Aid, and medical countermeasures. #RadReady
@HHS_HealthReg2 Thanks for bringing that up. It's important to include all populations in radiation planning. #RadReady
Q5: What are some important public information topics and messages to consider for risk communication planning in the aftermath of a radiation emergency? #RadReady
A4B: Internal contamination can also be detected when after external decon survey meter still identifies residual radioactivity. A nasal swab can be used to determine lung contamination, or a urine sample can be collected to determine isotope measurement. #RadReady
A4A: Some additional short term health effects related to Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) are nausea, fever, fatigue, and depleted white blood cell counts and long term health effects include cancer, prenatal radiation exposure, and emotional &amp; psychological distress. #RadReady
@DebraKRobinson Thanks for your insight!
Q4B: How is internal radiation contamination detected? #RadReady
Q4A: What are the health effects of radiation on the human body? #RadReady
A3: Some other strategies include; recruiting during regional MRC events, contacting state/local chapters of radiation professional orgs, developing a registry of volunteers, offering radiation training volunteers prior to an emergency. #RadReady
@PublicHealthGuy Great suggestion! Consider bringing in state radiation control representatives to your training to provide additional subject matter knowledge and expertise. #RadReady
RT @PublicHealthGuy: Q3A: We've seen some great programs in GA using local MRCs and implementing a routine training schedule. Works even be…
Q3: What are some strategies jurisdictions can use to recruit and retain radiation response volunteers? #RadReady
A2A/B: “There are medicines and foods that cure radiation contamination” – There is no one magic pill or cure. There are medical countermeasures to block uptake of radiation, speed up removal of internal contam, or help body recover from radiation exposure. #RadReady
A2A/B: “You can’t protect yourself from radiation exposure” - If contaminated, bodies and items can be cleaned. If exposed, you’re not a risk to others (not contagious). Actually, most people are exposed to ionizing radiation in everyday life, from natural sources. #RadReady
A2A/B: “Any amount of radiation dangerous”- Health effects from exposure range from no effect to death, but depends on dose, type of rad, time exposed, age, and indiv sensitivity. No “safe” level because safety is based on PERCEPTION and implies ZERO risk. #RadReady
Q2B: While we are discussing myths, what is the actual reality surrounding those myths? #RadReady
Q2A: What are some common radiation myths you have heard? #RadReady
A1: Some additional things to consider are: shelter screening and decon capabilities; shelter location; shelter staff, volunteer, and security needs; support services for those with access and functional needs; pet services. #RadReady
@OrtizGuminaNEHA Thanks for bringing that up! FRMAC and NARAC offers resources on plume modeling.
@MissDoctorC That's a great suggestion!

.@ericdishman, Director of @AllofUsResearch and cancer survivor, says he's alive today because he was lucky enough to be one of the early prototypes for precision medicine. #JoinAllofUs
To populations underrepresented in research — or those whose historical research experiences have been negative — @AllofUsResearch wants you to know: this research isn't something that's happening *to* participants, it's happening *with* and *for* you. #JoinAllofUs.
.@AllofUsResearch recognizes that when you #JoinAllofUs, you share sensitive personal data. To protect your privacy, the program has certificates of confidentiality from the U.S. gov't, stores data on protected computers, removes identifying info, and will alert you of breaches.
Historically, communities of color have been left out of research. So if we're going to be able to learn more about the diversity of health in America, it's going to take all of us! #JoinAllofUs at https://t.co/etrUvXov1F!
With more data on more people, especially those who have been underrepresented in research, @AllofUsResearch can find patterns that help understand what keeps pepole healthy, what happens when people get sick, and why drugs cause some people side effects. #JoinAllofUs
Hearing lots of good stories from people of color who #JoinAllofUs in order to contribute to research that will help the nation's system develop and provide prevention and treatment approaches that are just as diverse as the people receiving them.
The @AllofUsResearch program isn't just about gathering data - it's about creating a detailed picture of the diverse health needs of our nation's people. For far too long, we've approached healthcare as "one-size-fits-all." When you #JoinAllofUs, you can help change that.
"Precision medicine" is healthcare that considers factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. The goal is to be able to tell people the best ways to stay healthy &amp; to provide individualize treatment regimens when you do get sick. #JoinAllofUs
