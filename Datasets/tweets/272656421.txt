@OS26 @realDonaldTrump Hey @NewAmericaISP @NewAmerica! Is @OS26 promoting the illegal extradition of @FGulencomEN in line with American values? Also, note he works for erdogan's state media outletü§î
@CillizzaCNN why is @realDonaldTrump breathing so hard?
@woot It's tiny! I think I know what I bought: https://t.co/4MdIBBXdLN
@jonathanchait News cycle.
@BillKristol Barium meal test.
@OS26 I‚Äôd call you a puppet, but you have gotten so fat the strings would break.
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump You clearly don't understand how appropriations work.  There is no requirement for the DOJ to spend that money. It's simply been appropriated.
@OS26 You are just jealous that they wouldn't power their country on your Erdogan funded BS
@OS26 @IAFsite You've gotten so fat you have to catch your breath between words.
@OS26 You are on Erdogan's payroll. You support this alleged behavior every time you speak. Or are you speaking from the moral high ground of that O'Bagy style "PhD" from Georgetown you frequently tell people you have. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
@AriMelber You literally put kumquats in your mouth and chew....like an apple.
@GloriaBorger ...someone is projecting.
@OS26 Says the unregistered foreign agent.
@johnroderick PWNED is not pronounced "pawned." Your lack of memetic knowledge has certainly offended our future briney overlords.
@JuliaDavisNews Did you do any work on who is paying for this codel???

@TundraPower can I get some tundra power love?

@KrangTNelson Better yet...when will she challenge @benshapiro to an arm wrestling match? Winner gets a lifetime supply of Alex Jones‚Äô supplements?
@KrangTNelson If you are against the US, then you are against the federal bill of rights. If you oppose the bill of rights, you oppose 2A. If you want Ohio to be independent then you will get Kasich‚Äôs gun control laws...which is the sovereign will of Ohio‚Äôs voters.
@OS26 @NicholasAHeras @OS26 don't you have some Saudi money to go shimmy for? Get out of IA and stick to the one thing you are good at...being a pudgy shill.
@AshaRangappa_ @nytimes Don't forget that as a clearance holder it is MUCH easier for the FBI to investigate him. This is the 4th amendment sacrifice all cleared individuals make.
@DistrictTrivia is it permitted for hosts to participate in competition?
@bustle why on Earth is museum of Bible sending me ads for Father's day, it ain't even mother's day...not surprised https://t.co/TORLSLmFmO
@DistrictTrivia I love WNBA doing WNBA...but new rule, no more WNBA or Spiderman questions.

@KellyannePolls Did you say "gotcha" when the access Hollywood tape came out?
@mikiebarb realllllly classy running a https://t.co/9699f9d0Em ad after the nicanor story.
@BradMossEsq Google the SF-86 form and carefully look at what you agree to when you sign one. The FBI doesn't need a warrant...kushner and anyone in the Whitehouse who applied for/obtained a clearance waived the warrant requirement. Even if they try to back out with an interim clearance. Oops
@GDouglasJones Congrats! what other miracles are in store for us? #8crazynights #oldtestamentgod

@maddow how much tax $ was spent on repeal efforts? Bet it's a lot more than cost of transgender soldiers
@SenatorCollins I wonder if @farenthold offered to duel the former staffer he sexually harassed? ü§î
@jonlovett Why is no one disc the fact that Trump ordered Price to engage in illegal partisan behavior to lobby congress under threat of firing?
@JeffreyToobin no one discussing the fact that @realDonaldTrump thrtened to fire Tom Price if he didn't illegally lobby Cngress for repeal?
@thedollop @reynoldsgareth @daveanthony Kinda disappointed that this only got liked by lil'Garfie and not Dave or Jos√©. üòí #slightedAF
@thedollop @reynoldsgareth @daveanthony more people in line for the DC show than Trump's inauguration. Any Russian intrprtrs in the house?
@michaeldweiss 2) the front row at hearings is always reserved for witness guests/special invite. who invited veselnitskaya to front row?
@michaeldweiss 1) Rohrbacher said veselnitskaya didn't speak English. How did she understand McFaul hearing/Don Jr.?
Impeach @realDonaldTrump unless he proves Elvis, Andy Kaufman, and Tupac are alive.
RT @JosephScrimshaw: This is like if Nixon added "I am not a crook" to the top of his stationery. https://t.co/1mVxxeHAR5
@Doritos can a Jew get a Doritos-matzah mashup? #letmypeoplesnackonthego
@Doranimated Plus Flynn, as a high profile citizen, was under numerous investigations which all pinned him as a foreign agent. It's called probable cause
@Doranimated Quit excusing Flynn's behavior. There is no 4th amndt violation.
@Thesixler looks like America is stuck with the worst "little lyre(sic) of building" for the foreseeable future. :(
@realDonaldTrump what war were we in when you were in college? Oh wait you wouldn't know, you never went. #draftdodged

@LiveExtra What's up with the apple TV streaming? It keeps crashing.
Shocked @realDonaldTrump doesn't think that characterization of @RealBenCarson as cerebral is just PC speak for mentally challenged.
@RealBenCarson what is #terroristmalpractice ?
@BenCarson2016 Wtf is #terroristmalpractice ?
@OS26 how are you a director at a media company when you #can'teven. Or do you sleep well at night knowing you are a fraud. @edwardedark
@OS26 were you responsible for this hard hitting poll? #Syria https://t.co/mhHlhdxmHe
