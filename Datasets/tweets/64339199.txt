@rDragaliaLost Awesome! I love a good raid event!
@iamjohnoliver It was such a fantastic episode, and it was so well done that even some of my most close minded friends said “That was really entertaining and there are a lot more consequences to Brexit than I had previously heard about”. Changing a mind is a rare, beautiful thing these days!
@iamjohnoliver I love every episode, and this one was no exception. I fear that when people allow themselves to have exceptions to rational thinking, I quickly mutates into something horrible. I absolutely agree that talk shows need to stop lending credibility to these shameless vultures.
@DonnieWahlberg Did you mess with Jenny at home? I keep picturing her saying “You have to tell me if you are The Rabit” and you just giving her a cheeky smile! 😂
@AOC When I was a teenager, I wanted to grow up and become a lawyer like Alan Shore from Boston Legal. I’ll never be a lawyer, but I did learn to speak elegantly and make clear points at least 😁
@tommychong I’ve been a fan of yours all my life, and I immediately knew after your first promo that you were the Pineapple on The Masked Singer. I loved it, and I still love all the great work you do. Stay awesome man, much respect.
@Tori_Spelling @MaskedSingerFOX @FOXTV They really were amazing tonight. You were amazing too. I hope to hear you sing again someday. You’ve got a fan in me you magical unicorn you.

@realjoeyfatone @TheRue I absolutely love this idea!!! I sincerely hope to see new tracks coming from both of you! You got a guaranteed sale right here, promise!
@kenjeong @MaskedSingerFOX You are still the king in my book Ken!
@MaskedSingerFOX I think one of my all time favorite moments from this season was when Nick Cannon asked Donny “What made you want to do a show like this?” And with Star filled joy in his eyes, Donny yelled “Because it’s fun!” Every single contestant is a winner in my book, congratulations!
@TPAIN @LilTunechi @russdiemon @torylanez @FlippDinero @otgenasis @BOOSIEOFFICIAL @ProfitDinero850 I just downloaded 1UP! Consider it the official soundtrack to my tomorrow! Can hardly wait!
@MaskedSingerFOX There is no better way to put it. Only The Masked Singer could provide this unique combination of excitement, laughter, heartache, joy, and wonder all at the same time! Going to miss you guys next week 😘😭🥰
@DonnieWahlberg @TPAIN T-Pain, week after week you gave us incredible performances. You showed me a part of you that I never knew about, and I feel so lucky to have seen that side of you. I just want to say thanks for the memories, the excitement, and even the tears. Can’t wait to see what you do next!
@Tattoodfknheart You know what they say, Two out of three ain’t bad!
@4Shelby21 @MaskedSingerFOX He is, and not to take away from any of the hot tracks he chooses to use it on, but after this, I hope to hear a lot more genuine T-Pain in the future!
@MaskedSingerFOX That’s awesome! Can’t wait!
@windycitygirl91 @MaskedSingerFOX 😂😂😂Great catch Kelly! Donny Osmond did a fantastic job!
@FoxLexington So excited for the Pokémon segment! Happy Pokémon day!!! https://t.co/7kTDWcVsJL
@JennyMcCarthy @MaskedSingerFOX It has been my pleasure, and I cannot wait to do it again next season! Stay awesome Jenny!
@kenjeong @MaskedSingerFOX Thank you Ken! You made me laugh each and every week, and I can’t wait to see you again next season!
@issakpoplover @MaskedSingerFOX Absolutely! I am not ashamed to admit that the soul within his voice brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion, and it was always nice to see that I was not the only one 🥰😭🥰
@MaskedSingerFOX @FOXTV I just want to thank you guys again! You are all champions in my book. Every week you gave me something to look forward to, and I can hardly wait until we can do this again. Parting is such sweet sorrow, so until next time, The Rico loves you, and good night 😘 🥰
@MaskedSingerFOX This show has been an incredible opportunity not only for T-Pain, but for us as the audience to see and appreciate this side of T-Pain. I don’t ever want to hear anyone say this man needs Autotune again! Congratulations my man, you earned the championship!!!
@MaskedSingerFOX Way to go Gladys! You were amazing at the Super Bowl and you were amazing on the show! The path you have walked has been a legendary one, and I feel confident that it is far from over! Keep the legend going Gladys!
@MaskedSingerFOX Way to go Donnie! I can’t believe you were performing on the show and then flying to Vegas this whole time! Now that is a magic act!
@NickCannon @MaskedSingerFOX This is how we do it was a fantastic choice!
@MaskedSingerFOX It’s almost time!!! Take off the masks!!!
@MaskedSingerFOX I am still hoping it is Neil Patrick Harris, although if it turns out to be Weird Al I would be pleasantly surprised!
@NickCannon @MaskedSingerFOX It’s going to be a great contest. They are already champions in my book, but the Peacock is going to fly high tonight!
@MaskedSingerFOX The Monster said “On A Boat” hmm...

@MaskedSingerFOX Bring your A game to the finals Peacock, The Rico is rooting for you!
@MaskedSingerFOX Gladys Knight is the best guess I got, can’t wait to find out!
@JennyMcCarthy @MaskedSingerFOX 😂😂😂
@JennyMcCarthy @MaskedSingerFOX Totally agree. The only thing I know about The Bee is that she is legendary!
@MaskedSingerFOX Absolutely! You know it!
RT @MaskedSingerFOX: Hey #TheMaskedSinger fans, RETWEET and we might follow you! 🎭
@MaskedSingerFOX @FOXTV No matter who wins, I certainly won’t be disappointed. That being said, I’m Team Peacock tonight!
@MaskedSingerFOX @kenanthompson I want to know as well, but I am sooo not tired of it. I could probably watch this show year round 😂😂😂
@JennyMcCarthy @MaskedSingerFOX If The Rico were to choose a costume for the masked singer, he would probably be The Demon, donning black and red with a splash of gold.
@NickCannon @MaskedSingerFOX I do remember the thrill of discovering that was Terry Bradshaw though! I love when your outfits pair great with one of the singers as well! Stay awesome Nick!
@kenanthompson @MaskedSingerFOX @FOXTV Loved seeing you as a guest judge! Stay awesome Kenan!
@MaskedSingerFOX You guys have absolutely kept me wondering the entire time! Great job!
@MaskedSingerFOX Ken Jeong busting out the crown for a week was pretty awesome! Also, the guest judges have all been hilarious! But the talent is absolutely front and center in this competition!

@RealKristiKalis @MaskedSingerFOX Ooh, that is a really good guess!
@MaskedSingerFOX Keenan is feeling a lot of my guesses tonight. I think it is Gladys Knight, but I know it is a legend 😉
@MaskedSingerFOX I hadn’t considered Nick Lachey until the moment he said chicken of the sea 🤔
@MaskedSingerFOX Pretty sure the Monster is T-Pain. If I am right, this show has really given him a chance to show us another side of him, another skillset I never knew he had. Go Monster!
@MaskedSingerFOX Whoa! I had not even considered that it might be Weird Al! Game changer!

Do you think there should be a limit on campaign contributions made by special interest groups?
@hakan_geijer @pookietooth It’s wild, hilarious, and sweet in the weirdest way
@NORML @amyklobuchar I stand in the “Please, for the sake of my sanity, legalize our freedom to choose marijuana like free thinking adults.” category. It is an essential part of “liberty and justice for all”.
@NORML This saddens me deeply. I don’t want anyone else to suffer, to have difficulty securing employment over outdated laws that destroy the lives of many great people. 😢
@MaskedSingerFOX Great job Ricki! So good to see you again!
@MaskedSingerFOX The Monster was my favorite tonight, but I can’t wait to see the Rabbit next week!
@MaskedSingerFOX @kenjeong Robin’s awesome observational prowess either paid off, or he is really good at listening to twitter! Either way, great job Robin! Great job Ricki! What a fantastic show. Do I really have to wait a week to do this again? 😢😁

@MaskedSingerFOX The Monster has my vote tonight! #MaskedSinger
@MaskedSingerFOX Such an amazing performance! I agree, I want to know, but I don’t want you to go!
@MaskedSingerFOX For those guessing Ricki Lake, does anyone know where she keeps her Emmy? It seemed like a really important hint! Somewhere public? Like a hall of fame or museum or something?
@MaskedSingerFOX Amazing performance Raven. One more performance, and somebody’s mask is coming off!!! I can’t wait to see who it is, even though it means one of these awesome people is going home. So bitter sweet!
@MaskedSingerFOX I don’t know who the Raven is, but she sounded amazing! Quote the Raven, Nevermore!
@MaskedSingerFOX That clue has me completely thrown off 😂
@MaskedSingerFOX If this turns out to be nph, I’m gonna feel terrible. I felt like nph was the bunny 😂😂😂
@MaskedSingerFOX @robinthicke I think Robin comes off week after week as the most observant of the group. He picks up on a lot of subtle performance ticks!
@NickCannon @MaskedSingerFOX I want to say Gladys Knight. Her performance kind of reminded me of the Super Bowl performance!

@MaskedSingerFOX I also am leaning towards Gladys Knight, but I have been wrong a couple of times 😂
@MaskedSingerFOX The opening song absolutely left me feeling good! Everyone on that stage sounds so talented!
@MaskedSingerFOX The crown was a nice touch! Sorry they took the trophy back 😂😂😂 @kenjeong

@MartyDa1MnParty @staceyabrams @DNC @SenateDems @williamlegate @jvgraz @KyleKulinski I would also like to hear that explanation. I thought the speech tonight was great, however I in no way support gerrymandering! What is going on here?
@guardian I dunno...was it any good?
@AOC I often find it hard to look “spirited and warm” when unsettled by world events as well, especially lately. Definitely don’t fake what you don’t feel. I hope you have what it takes to bring about some positive change. Wish I could say I had any hope left.

@fairfightaction @staceyabrams Just wanted to say, I felt like you did very well tonight, and I look forward to observing your work in the future.
@Brend73352864 @MaskedSingerFOX @FOXTV I love @DonnieWahlberg and that would be awesome. My wife and I are hoping it turns out to be none other than @ActuallyNPH 😂. Either way, I have never found a show like this that excites me on this level like @MaskedSingerFOX
@tweetmommybop Honestly, it was a very hard year. Some of that was a result of the company I worked for going back on promises made both to receive tax cuts and merge. That said, I hope to find my way again someday, as I also hope this country can.

@jacksonbacksonx There is only one world. This "third world" crap is devaluing entire populations of people so we don't have to go help them do work. It is a sad and lazy way for the majority of a country way to act. I will yell in their faces pointlessly until i die pointlessly probably.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart You only get credit for the caring you have done personally in this world. You don't get to take credit for the caring your forefathers did. The way you speak doesn't sound as humanitarian as many people from those countries. It's even weirdly obvious. Judge individually man.
@jacksonbacksonx I am extremely arrogant because nobody thinks like me. It seems like literally everyone else is too busy focused on petty squabbles to even try to save the world or the species anymore. What do you think happens when this planet and the sun start to change?
And there it is sir. You believe only Americans and Europeans can engage in hand holding. That makes you on the wrong side of history my friend. I hope we all blend into a single race with time, and stories are told of the idiots that used to struggle against it. https://t.co/bKmZLcC1C6
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Gladly is grossly misused here. It is not an argument, I was simply stating that as the rest of the world gains enlightenment, we will obviously be afraid of their new capabilities, especially at first. Why do we face our fears? It is the only way we grow, as a person or species.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart You misunderstand me sir. I am personally challenging you to try. If you want to fix the symptom that is illegal immigration, try to solve the disease that is fear, hate, and stupidity among our entire species. Then we can peacefully, reasonably, and practically solve it.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Yeah. Knowledge is power. It is true that when everyone is equally enlightened, Americans will probably know fears that only the rest of the world has had to know until now. That sucks, but we are part of this planet whether we like it or not.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart I will not discriminate against my fellow Americans any more than I discriminate against them, but we all need to work together. America is a cog in a bigger machine. I want to see the Earthians, or something like that. There has got to be some good solution for everyone. Try.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Enlightened? Like, they are not in on some big secret? They are generally less educated? They have less technology? How do you define enlightenment? Some monks claim to find it without any resources in a temple. Is enlightenment some thing that only Euro-Americans are capable of?
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart That is what happens to most good people. The world chews them up and everyone they care about. So we are afraid to try. That fear is the real big evil I am talking about, that must be cured. We are all like fetal position babies when it comes to trying to help anyone anymore.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Very true. And we have to be smart about what we are realistically able to give. I’d say for all I know we could be giving too much already, but I know how this country shops and eats. We do have to sort a lot of our own shit out. Massively ignorant and greedy pop.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart If a person genuinely believes or taking care of the bear will make them a shitty person, they are probably better off dying trying to help that bear than living long enough to become the villain
@jacksonbacksonx I am not a capitalist, socialist, or communist. Dumb people made that bullshit up long before I was born. Labels are stupid. You label yourself, you limit your ability to think. The only label I wear is human, and sometimes that barely feels quite right lol.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart That’s where stuff really gets weird. I suppose that depends on how much you value the life of that bear. I eat animals, but I thank them thoroughly for their sacrifice when I do. I do not know that it is more just to kill a plant than an animal. It is all a sick cosmic joke.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Everything by need. If someone needs it more, and it is more practical for us to help that person, by all means, pass up a Southern American. But now turn that around a bit. What about when they need something we have more than we do?
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart No sir, I am from a small town originally. I have planted and sewn. Grown food from seed with love and a little plot of land. But we don’t have unlimited resources ourselves. Which resources are we most limited on right now? We should probably decide the numbers based on that.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Nobody is talking about every inch dude. But there is a ton of excess. Hours and hours of it. We need to buy time and simultaneously drastically reduce the entire world’s pop with better reproductive mentalities
@jacksonbacksonx Justice is an illusion. Justice is fair and equal to all. The very concept is flawed. We were not born with equal opportunities and circumstances. However, I do not believe the best way to help is to starve our own people. We absolutely have to be practical, and stop immigration
@jacksonbacksonx No, it is not I am afraid. I was born and raised half Mexican in Greenville, Mississippi. The white supremacists and xenophobes are not imaginary, and their goals are rarely to make the lives of other types of people better in any way.
@jacksonbacksonx Definitely not. I have been more understanding than most about the difficult decisions the president has had to deal with in those situations. And the left does take a picture of every crying kid they can find and put his name on it. Most people who take a label abandon logic.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart I said we should use the resources to help, and we could stand to let a controlled amount in to occupy some unused land for our own needs. It is you who misunderstands my platform. I only want to take the venom of how we solve our very real immigration problem.
@jacksonbacksonx Absolutely, uncontrolled immigration is dangerous and could ruin any great nation, as history has indeed shown us time and time again. They are a symptom of a much larger problem that connects us all and also causes Americans to suffer. That is the problem we must solve first!
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart You kinda jumped to assuming I just wanted to let them in, but I’m not a leftist devoid of reason, I’m a guy in the middle trying to bridge every stupid gap we made best as I can. We all have the struggle of life in common, and the media screams about our differences and terror.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart They are not helping by promoting illegal immigration. They should instead focus on helping make those people actually want to stay in their homeland. With the mass death I don’t know how we begin to do that, but we try, because we are good
@jacksonbacksonx I don’t think it’s great. I preferred not caring. It was easier. But I can’t stand how stupid all these systems are. People born long before us did and we roll with it like nothing ever needs to change. Our ways are outdated and inefficient. Writeoff of a species.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Still, I think we are so worried about trying to do that with tough words and brute force, when there might be an easier way to convince them their land can be good too. I liked what Trump did with that Korea trailer of what they could be! That was so clever! Could it work again?
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Yeah, the illegal immigrants. Same ones. But still as human as us. Same species. They bleed the same. Breathing the same. They try to raise families and do jobs and smile. Sometimes cry. I do want to help them, but preventing illegal immigration is absolutely a top priority!
I just read that @KimGuadagnoNJ would rather legalize prostitution than recreational marijuana. Well ma’am, I say, legalize them both and stop trying to tell people how to live their miserable lives when they aren’t working it all away!!!

I used to wonder why I was born a Mexican-American in the Delta of Mississippi. I do not feel Mexican or American, White, brown, or black, liberal or conservative, Democrat or republican. It was lonely, but I wonder if The World knew you would need someone who could bridge gaps.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart I am not fine with people suffering in general. Your biggest problem is that you don’t see that the greatest source of American suffering has nothing to do with immigrants? It is our mindset as a country, and really as a species. Hate spreads so fast and easy.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am tonight’s entertainment, and we have a lot of work to do, so let’s get started.
@jacksonbacksonx And you are not even trying to. You just want to shove thousands of people in a shitty land so you don’t have to look at them. That is who you are as a person. Keep owning it, because I see clearly, I cannot save you. I did try though. Not for them, for you. Your soul. Your mind.
@jacksonbacksonx You say “Why should I” an awful lot. I will tell you why you specifically and personally should: because you didn’t come up with a better idea. Honestly, what sort of materialistic, greedy, selfish asshole did your parents raise? Deep down, you know better. Deny it all you want.
@jacksonbacksonx Maybe that was a little dishonest. I have had times myself where I thought about it, but who hasn’t yeah? But my friends are. Mostly Americans. They are not suffering because “illegals are crossing”, they are suffering because ignorant people are quick to hate and anger
@jacksonbacksonx I’m glad you are well cheif. I’m not suicidal, but I ain’t exactly well. But, I’m still trying my best, just like everyone else. But yeah, overpopulation is bad. It is not an “Our country” thing though, we need to start talking reducing global pop, better birth laws, etc.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart No. The right choice is for us to come together as a species and work out every one of our petty ass squabbles. Every human on this planet. Then, we focus on leaving this rock before the whole species just disappears in a flash. Spread among the stars like the virus we are.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart I try my best to always be honest. There may be times when you are right and I am wrong, but I will try not to lie on my honor and integrity. Phrases like “I shouldn’t have to just so illegals can” indicate a poisonous mindset. I challenge you to be better, even if it’s harder!
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart It is. So is America. The whole world is a shithole now. Filled with greedy, people who would see each other die if they could get more “stuff” out of it. George Carlin saw it long before me. I’m not a socialist, a capitalist, or a communist. I’m a person, and my name is Anakin.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Just looked up Kate. Did you know her? I am really sorry for your loss man. I am not happy to see anyone suffer. She was only 32?
@jacksonbacksonx Agreed. I don’t think opening the floodgates is the answer either. I’m thinking more creative solutions. How would you help them best? You could probably do it way better than me, but you have to come at it with love is all. I promise, I’m just a nobody who never wanted to care.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Also, I refuse to lean right or left, so don’t go mistaking me for a snowflake. Democrats and liberals are just a different bag of shit.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart I can’t tell a lie bud, I have no idea who that is. Weird thing is, I bet you are way more informed than I am. If you have good knowledge, I am not against learning from you. I only want less hateful bile from you. But yeah, I’ll check into her. Who knows what I might learn.
@jacksonbacksonx Although, I see your point man. You do deserve to feel reasonably safe, and it sounds like you feel anxious about that right now. Everyone has anxiety right now, but we can’t shit on each other to feel better about it, and we can’t zone out through our life problems.
@jacksonbacksonx Two. One for a couple days and one of and on for several weeks. He was in an incredibly dark place, and even sent out a goodbye suicide text. I was so scared that night. Honestly, didn’t have the food or money to support him, but he was in agony man. Divorce and mental hardships.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Absolutely, I agree that it would be stupid to open the floodgates. There are important parts to the process. We should control the numbers we permit, on this I absolutely agree. But we also have to find a way to help them, and stop demonizing an entire population.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart You are equally ok with the lives of those thousands of illegals being miserable from the moment they are born to the moment they die. It is the most basic logic. You just added a bunch of extra bullshit to your perspective over the years. Again, everyone can win!
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Someone who has lost close friends to that battle, and is trying hard not to lose even more. Everyone has anxiety now. Everyone is suicidal. What you “want”, just doesn’t make any of the priority lists of actual human suffering.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Wrong. My responsibility is to human beings. It is both to you and them. You drew lines and said fuck everyone but these people? That’s such a monstorous thing to do! Borders can protect us, I actually believe that, but they do not define us, just the plot of land we reside on.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Healthcare is valuable to the physical &amp; mental health of every human being. Your mental health can survive people living in places you’ll never see. And what is this happiness bullshit? Most people aren’t happy anymore. Anywhere. Everyone is freaking suicidal now. It’s all bad.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart So, like that episode of South Park where Kyle signed the contract with manbearpig so Americans could keep their “stuff”, like red dead redemption 2, and the latest iPhone.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Truth be told, I don’t want to live in Mexico either. I have always loved my American life and privileges. But lately, I have started to realize how guilty I am of ignoring so much suffering and i think it is finally starting to catch up to me.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart That is the point and the problem. You think “I like those stretches of land” outweighs actual problems. You make a lot of wise points, but as a species I assure you, we are all equally worthless. When this rock blows, you will be as forgotten as I, and every Mexican ever born.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart I fully realize we can’t afford to hand out all of our resources, but...do you ever drive from one city to the next and just take time to appreciate how much land is between them? What if people who had nowhere else to go tried to farm that land? Make more resources?
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart ...make the right choices as a species, with the handful of instructions we are given in life. I don’t know that you see these people as humans at all. You just say illegals a lot.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart That is problematic, and I completely understand that. But that is a symptom of the real problem. Why do those people not have access to healthcare they feel comfortable going to? Why do they run? The same reason any of us are doing anything man. We keep trying to...
Don’t tell me we can’t adjust our health care system to take care of more people. When we arrived in this country, there was no healthcare system. We built it from scratch. We did a shit job, but don’t tell me it can’t be restructured.
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart You are not wrong. I do see the healthcare system abused all the time. Mostly by natural citizens who want a pill fix and doctors who want to prescribe pills for profit. Too much corruption for good to win. It isn’t an immigration problem. People are naturally shittier all around
This country has a serious gambling problem. We bet prison sentences on the outcome of a sport we call trial, we bet on our health of our citizens with a scam we call “insurance”. And politics? C’mon. We need to get serious rebuilding and optimizing these systems!
@jacksonbacksonx @MickSweetman @iD4RO @m_r_stewart Many who sweat most have the least healthcare. It’s a bullshit system. Insurance=gambling with health in a way looser way than it ever had to be. Paid insurance for four years, never got sick. Lost coverage this month, lung infection. Zero product for my sweat, blood, and tears.
@SethMacFarlane Ha, went to the local clinic today for coughing blood. After they told me the price without insurance, almost left and just ignored it. They’re only lungs, right? 😂😂😂
@Wild_Pikahiiri @ZenothChipsune @Crazzyintheusa I understood your point, but challenged the metaphor itself using a line from the @lildickytweets song “Pillow Talking”, but it is cool to learn how Black Friday works in other countries, and I love a lot about the U.K. In general 😁

Rollins in history? I hoped we'd forget he ever happened, but @WWE is so determined to ram him down throats people are starting to swallow.

Not all rivalries have to peak at Mania. Wyatt vs Ambrose is an obvious distraction from Ambrose vs Rollins. @WWE #SurvivorSeries

@TheRealLayRock because network sales are that bad
@totinos @WWE AMBROSE!!!
@TheRealLayRock for only $9.99!
If Ambrose chooses the stakes, I say we bring back the "Lion's Den" match. @WWE #RAW
@JRsBBQ Tough call. Brock doesn't usually stay long, and I dunno who negotiates his contracts, but the guy usually appears, wins, and leaves
Who do you think is/was a better commentator, Michael cole or Tony Schiavone?
Go ahead and give it to Lesnar. It will make it that much greater when DANIEL BRYAN COMES BACK, AND TAKES IT AWAY!!! #RAW #YesMovement

@realmickfoley lol. Well Mick, it's not an easy pill to swallow, but we can't let it ruin what was almost a flawless night.

@TheRealLayRock He has the potential to be a great champ, just not when he's in whining hand it to me mode
@JohnCena You're not my favorite, but I respect you for giving everything every time and maintaining your dignity in the face of adversity

@R_Roddy_Piper Absolutely loved the stores about the boxing match with Mr. T and the night out on the town!
I am developing my own road to Wrestlemania storyline via 2k14. It will heavily revolve around behind the scenes decisions, with some twists
What if Bryan came out, mad at HHH, and Punk came out like "I got this Bryan. HHH, if I beat you, you put Bryan in the main event at WM @WWE
@TheRealLayRock Roman Reigns will be champ someday, no doubt.

Daniel Bryan's wins don't feel nearly as inspiring as they did a week ago. I am almost completely bored with @WWE #SmackDown
@JRsBBQ @SportsNightly I don't know JR. Like everyone else, I wanted Bryan in that match, but I fear it is too late for that.
I have a new love for twitter and I feel like a million bucks, thanks to some incredible people.
@TheRealLayRock Now that you mention it, I haven't seen her fight much. She makes a great face. They need to focus on getting her ready.
@TheRealLayRock I wonder why. The WWE should really work on utilizing their most valuable assets more efficiently. That is #BestforBusiness
@WWE Any idea when #WWENetwork will be working on Xbox360
@TheRealLayRock that's unfortunate. She's got some attitude, but isn't that what we've all been missing from the WWE lately?
@NatbyNature @KiddWWE You are more inspirational and motivational than any girl I know, and my #1 choice for Diva's Champion.
@HEELZiggler I'll look into it. Sounds great. Big fan by the way, and I love your intro.
@TheRealLayRock Who send hate to @natalieevamarie ? That girl is incredible! I think she's great, and so does my girlfriend.
@CTEGurl @CageTheElephant Happy birthday Jared

@_shaunirvine @TheRealLayRock I think it will be 22-0 won't it?
@TheRealLayRock @WWE creative department hasn't been at its best, I hope they don't end the streak as a cheap way to make the ppv memorable
@TheRealLayRock there's a good chance that this match could take the show. So far, it's the only one that has my interest.
@TheRealLayRock I'm here. Sup bud?
@StephMcMahon @TripleH I really like the NXT shows. It's good to form early bonds with the fresh talent that may be the future faces of @WWE
@realmickfoley @ChynatheIcon WWE gave me so much over the years, I should let go of my fury. I miss Eddie too. Thanks Mick. I needed that.
I'm starting to feel ok. I feel bad for being negative toward @WWE. I love it, they just hurt me. I didn't know I cared so much. I'm sorry.
@WWEDanielBryan You deserved the chamber win. There are thousands of ppl like me who wanted to see you win the main event at WM30. I'm sorry
It's been half a week since @WWE broke my spirit. I can't bring myself to watch Raw. I heard DB beat Kane and I can't even smile about that.
@steveaustinBSR When Shawn turned on Bryan at Hell in a Cell, I really hoped Stone Cold would show up and train him to destroy the Authority
@BobbyBamber I just can not bring myself to care about that match at all. The match that should have been still haunts my every hour.
@12ApEx_PrEdAtOr I wouldn't mind. I'd love a cell three way with Lesnar, taker, and HHH, but I'm too creative to work for WWE creative.
HHH vs Bryan should've happened at extreme rules, after Bryan won the title to immortalize the now disappointing Wrestlemania 30 @WWE
@12ApEx_PrEdAtOr I'm slightly interested in the Undertaker vs Lesnar. That is about it.
@JustinMershimer  I'd be lying if I said I was anything less than a hardcore Daniel Bryan fan. But honestly, that streak should never end
@JustinMershimer I agree Taker vs Lesnar isn't appealing, but I feel that the triple threat would be brutal, and hardly requires story.
@JustinMershimer how about taker, Lesnar, and HHH triple threat hell in a cell?
@InLuvWithRKO16 I think even Orton fans are tired of watching him get spoonfed victories like a baby on a boobie. He used to fight well.
If HHH is desperate for a mania match with Punk gone, how about triple threat hell in a cell with Lesnar and Taker? @WWE #BestForBusiness
Want to do what's best for business? Bryan win's title at mania, defends it against HHH at extreme rules. Everybody wins. @WWE #MakeItRight
@WWE @WWEDanielBryan I do not want to see Daniel Bryan vs HHH at Wrestlemania.
@realmickfoley it's ok Mick. We all expected so much more with the launch of the Network and Elimination Chamber, it's not just you man.
@abzie21 @WWEDanielBryan @WWEUniverse Yes, we want justice, and it is not HHHvs Daniel Bryan
@bull_air @JRsBBQ I think when Punk walked out, he HHH was like "I've totally got to have a match dude"
@WrestleChatNet hell no
Triple H and CM Punk would've been a great WM30 match, but Punk walks out and Triple H is all "Whoa dude, i still got to be in a match @WWE
@nicoleandbri @WWE I agree, but the people do not want Daniel Bryan vs Triple H. We deserve better.
@RassslinRantin @nicoleandbri @WWE think of the immortal moment that could have been Daniel's WM30 victory, he has more than earned it
@DougDCBTito4lif Eventually you take all that you can take until one day, you either make yourself heard or just quit. I'm not sure yet.
@BryanIsWWE @WWE @WrestleMania nobody cares. At all.
@BradMaddoxIsWWE Nobody wants to see that match. Give up.
@FUTUREWWEDIVA18 unfortunately, by the time it happens, it will be disappointing, knowing that WM30 should have been his immortal moment.
@DougDCBTito4lif Because we deserve better. Never settle for second best, WWE is supposed to be better than that
@LanaWWE @RusevBUL @WWE if he knows what is best for him he will run. @WWE is about to sink.
@realmickfoley @WWEDanielBryan I know guys. My heart breaks for what could have been an immortal moment of triumph and hope.
I know it's a bit much, but I am so depresssed. @WWE used to bring me joy, now I don't feel excited about anything #WWE #YouReallyLetMeDown
@WWEUniverse @WWE @WrestleMania @WWEDanielBryan Nobody wants that
I've been waiting a long time to see Triple H fight again, but I do not want to see Triple H vs Bryan at Wrestlemania. I deserve better @WWE
@RassslinRantin @nicoleandbri @WWE I watched every show since Summerslam hoping for that , but I don't have the heart to hope anymore
I just don't care enough to watch Raw tonight. I don't care to see Daniel Bryan vs Kane, or triple h, or any other garbage @WWE #ImDone
@WWEShop @WWEDanielBryan How about you give him a fair title shot, and then I buy merchandise from you. I've learned my lesson.
@HenryElizondo9 @WWEXStream that is the exact same thing I said. Even vengeance seems less than satisfying this time. I'm so down
RT @realmickfoley: The ending to #WWEChamber was probably #NotBestForBusiness for my #wrestlemaniadreamvacation raffle for @RAINN01 http://…
@AnthonyOnDeck @WWEXStream You're not wrong. It's just, I hadn't lost hope. And i wouldn't even mind if just once he could lose fairly @WWE
@realmickfoley Thank you Mick for calling it like it is. Mine is also the picture of a fan whose heart is tired of breaking. #thankyoumick
I saw the announcement of the WWE Network. Since, I've been counting the minutes 'til I could subscribe. Tonight I stopped counting. @WWE
Mine is the face of someone who is tired of watching Daniel Bryan get screwed. He deserves better and so do we. @WWE #WWECHAMBER #WWENetwork
@WWENetwork #boycottforbryan
@WrestleMania @WWE @RandyOrton @davebatista @MBSuperdome I am in no way excited about this.
Someone should probably tell Stephanie and Triple H that Kane just single handedly cost them a lot of subscriptions. #WWEChamber
Even classic Orton fans have to be tired of this spoonfed garbage. I remember when Randy could fight his battles without help #WWEChamber
Tonight Elimination Chamber, Tomorrow WWE Network. It doesn't get any better than this. Thank you WWE for everything #WWEChamber
Tonight Elimination Chamber, Tomorrow, WWE Network, it does not get any better than this. Thank you so much WWE for everything @WWE #CHAMBER
JERRY! JERRY! JERRY! I love WWE Pregame shows. It is almost like being there @WWE #Chamber
I really, really hate Zeb Colter @WWE #Chamber
Daniel, I know the odds have never looked more stacked against you, but I know you have what it takes, you have heart Daniel. @WWE #Chamber
Tonight, is a night, that will live on in legends. Wrestlers will become warriors, and fight for immortality! @WWE #EliminationChamber
Dear Titus O'Neil: WHO's THE BIOTCH NOW!!! Lol @WWE#SmackDown
YES! YES! YES! Daniel Bryan for WWE World Heavyweight Champion and The Face of the WWE @WWE#SmackDown
Who is Seth trying to kid? There are definitely cracks in The Shield @WWE #SmackDown
#raw @WWE is bringing back legends, but I pray Daniel Bryan wins the Royal Rumble. He deserves a Wrestlemania title shot.
Smackdown is off to a beautiful start with a great first match and an even better main event. Not to mention the Divas! @WWE #Smackdown
@JohnCena I do not understand why the fans Boo you so much. You're an amazing wrestler and an even better sportsman. Get well soon bud.
Daniel Bryan gave everything to prove that he is a champion, THAT is something that you can not take away. @WWE #RAW
My favorite summer slam memory was when Daniel Bryan defeated John Cena for the WWE championship!
That ain't the way I remember it jack #redneckrenewal
@RandyOrton was just about to raise the stakes. Damn the Shield! @WWE #RAW

Divine Justice for Damien Sandow. Didn't anyone ever tell you not to drink the water in Mexico? @WWE #SmackDown
Someone's going in the river, hopefully the contract as well @WWE #SmackDown
Bold move by Cody Rhodes. I haven't seen anything like this since the Rock threw Stone Cold into the river in Detroit @WWE #SmackDown
Christian pulls off the victory over Swagger. Take that Colter! What now Sandow? @WWE #SmackDown
Excellent match between Christian and Swagger. Swagger is a great athlete, but I'm tire of this We the People garbage @WWE #SmackDown
How much longer will we have to endure Zeb Colter? @WWE #SmackDown
What do you think about The Wyatt Family vs. The Shield? I would love to see that @WWE #SmackDown
Is this their first official match? Up until now I think it has been nothing but sneak attacks @WWE #SmackDown

It's a great day to be Ziggler! @WWE #SmackDown
@JRsBBQ @MichaelCole @JCLayfield @LayfieldReport Sure do miss you J.R.
Time to find out what A.J. is thinking...yikes! @WWE #SmackDown
Whew, Damien Sandow making all sorts of enemies. Speaking of making enemies, here come A.J. Lee and Big E @WWE #SmackDown
I got a feeling if we want to see a real match between these two, we will have to buy SummerSlam @WWE #SmackDown
I don't know exactly what that was, but Alberto Del Rio did pull off the victory. @WWE #SmackDown
I really miss Ricardo Rodriguez @WWE #SmackDown
@FoxParker30 @WWEXStream I hate to say that when Randy Orton cashes in that contract, Cena may be in no condition to fight.
It's that time, RVD vs Alberto Del Rio! Is this a preview of Summerslam?
Was Cody Rhodes dressed as Sin Cara by any chance? @WWE #SmackDown
What do you think? Alberto Del Rio vs RVD at SummerSlam? I like it! @WWE #SummerSlam
Raw promises to be great, with Team Hell No fighting each other, Daniel Bryant vs Kane, and the Tables match between John Cena and Ryback!
@TheMarkHenry Even though I lost a lot of respect for you throughout your bout with Cena, you are earning it back lately.
Later tonight, Alberto Del Rio will take on Rob Van Dam, but first, we must endure A.J. Lee's State of Mind address @WWE #SmackDown
Mark Henry and the Usos played The Players and brawled the Brawler. Good match guys. @WWE #SmackDown
I admire the potential of the Prime Time Players, though they better learn to stop showboating in order to be effective @WWE #SmackDown
Got to love that 1-800-Fella ;) @WWESheamus
Get my head in the game? How about you get some damn rhythm? Lol, Titus to Wade Barret. He and the PTP will take on Mark Henry and the Usos.
Aww...I'm cool with CM Punk putting Fandango to sleep and all, but I at least would like to know why he came out @WWE #SmackDown
Really? Fandango chooses NOW to come out? Well, I didn't see it coming, but why interrupt Punk? It doesn't seem like a good idea at all @WWE
@WWECameron @WWE I think we will get a special glimpse at the Divas, and what they go through. I can hardly wait! #TotalDivas
I can't wait to see "The Best vs The Beast" @WWE #SummerSlam
Here he comes, "The Best in the World", CM PUNK! @WWE #Smackdown @CMPunk
@BriWWEfan @InLuvWithRKO16 I will totally be watching Total Divas this Sunday!
Up next, CM Punk. I can't wait to see what he has in store. If only Paul Heyman and Brock Lesner were in the building? @WWE #SmackDown
What do you think would happen if Cody Rhodes burned Damien Sandow's Money in the Bank contract? @WWE #SmackDown
Cody Rhodes with the distraction, and Randy Orton defeats Damien Sandow with an R.K.O. Congratulations Randy! @WWE #SmackDown
I am the voice in Randy Orton's head! @WWE #Smackdown @RandyOrton
This is an excellent matchup, the momentum keeps shifting. I may not like Sandow, but he is definitely impressing me at the moment @WWE
@vasquez2424 @WWEXStream @JohnCena Two Reasons, he deserves it, and the WWE Universe made it clear, this is what they want to see!
Damien Sandow likes chocking Orton with his foot. I guess you have to have a sadistic mentality to fight the viper though @WWE #SmackDown
@WWE @getglue @NatbyNature You know I did! Loving the Divas of Summer stickers!
I've been wanting to see someone kick @TheDamienSandow in the ass since money in the bank. @RandyOrton is the perfect person to do it! @WWE
First up, it's the money in the bank winners, Randy Orton vs Damien Sandow, what an excellent way to start the show! @WWE #SmackDown

@ExcuseMeWWE You better believe that I will be watching. I would be lying if I said I am not eager to see what you have planned tonight.
Last Friday, Vince Mcmahon shocked the WWE Universe by naming Vikki Gurerro permanent GM of Smackdown. The question becomes "Now what?" @WWE
According to http://t.co/rYtIzFKCHD, the Wyatts are set to make their SmackDown debut. Who will be their next victim?	@WWE #SmackDown
It's Almost that time. Friday Night Smackdown, only on SciFi, Imagine Greater @WWE #SmackDown

@JRsBBQ Daniel Bryan is on fire, and I personally would not be disappointed to see him walk away from Summerslam with the WWE Championship
@Esmebonterre @gaay182 I feel the same way. It makes me laugh, but I feel so guilty everytime it does.
Who will walk away from Summerslam with the WWE championship? John Cena? Daniel Bryan? Or Randy Ortan? @WWE #SummerSlam #RespectTheBeard
Daniel Bryan arises from the table like a Phoenix from the ashes. YES! YES! YES! @WWE #RAW
I can't wait to see Paul Heyman get what he deserves @WWE #RAW

@ExcuseMeWWE I will definitely be watching!
Do you think that the members of the Prime Time Players will be effective in singles competition? @WWE #RAW
I think Teddy Long makes a better GM! How long has he been doing it without us asking for the usual "You're Fired" @WWE #RAW #SmackDown
I still can not believe that Vikki Guerrero was named permanent General manager of smackdown *shiver* @WWE #RAW
@_WWEFan4LIFE @DelormeLacey I agree, he put up a hell of a fight, even with the bruise.
Despite Shemus' bad leg, he put up a hell of a fight! Still, pride goes to the victor, and Del Rio did walk away victorious @WWE #RAW
Del Rio's talent can not be denied as he keeps finding a way back on top during this match @WWE #RAW @VivaDelRio
That leg really seems to be slowing Shemus down. But hes one tough SOB, and I would love to see him overcome Del Rio tonight @WWE #RAW
You have got to love the WWEApp @WWE #RAW
Shemus vs Alberto Del Rio! This is going to be an excellent match! @WWE #RAW
