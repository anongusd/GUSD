@sideen_dan It may take some time to work the bugs out, however the science is sound, eventually it will get there.
@sideen_dan It typically takes decades to take a nuclear plant from planning to generation. A nuclear power plant planned will not produce energy in time to help with the climate crisis.
Transitioning to 100% renewables will require massive projects at a scale needed to address the scope of the problem.  Building 2,000 more Crescent Dunes size projects in our deserts is the right scale.
@sideen_dan There are  130 million households in the US. To power all of them with solar we would need less than 2,000 Crescent Dunes or 2 trillion dollars. These are the brass tacks and practical facts on renewables. It will take work and work means jobs. 100% renewable is 100% doable.
I am encouraged by the #GreenNewDeal and the #SchoolStrike4Climate movement I think we are at a tipping point. 2030 100% renewable looks like a real possibility.

@michaeljacole @DavidCEasley @ZachWeiner Distributed energy doesn't rely on a grid. There's a trade-off between centralized power + the cost of distribution vs. decentralized power, like solar. Solar on its own is not going to replace nuclear--they are apples and oranges.
@michaeljacole @DavidCEasley @ZachWeiner I am a degreed electrical engineer without allegiance to any particular technology. Nikola Tesla. didn't think we needed wires why should you? Grids are most not necessary they are only the current tech.
@ZachWeiner I believe Information theory gives a more practical argument. To know everything you have to be able to store and retrieve an infinite number of data points. The storage for the data would be bigger than the universe itself.
@DavidCEasley @michaeljacole @ZachWeiner You can't ignore that half the cost of centralized power is in the delivery. Which continually adds costs due to maintenance. Decentralized power literally gives power to the people. Gov't subsidizes oil so you are not paying the real price or for the environmental damage.
@DavidCEasley @michaeljacole @ZachWeiner Your system looks like it will just about pay for itself before end-of-life (~30 years). Do you agree with that?

@lowerthetemp @PaulEDawson With so little time left incrementalism will be how we fail.
@lowerthetemp @PaulEDawson I agree. $10 a gallon gas would sunset the internal combustion engine, which is why the tax will be nowhere near one dollar. I can not imagine the politician that would advocate for even a $1.00 tax on a gallon of gas. I see carbon pricing as a bad stall tactic.
@lowerthetemp @PaulEDawson My thinking is the public will pay the incrementally rising costs until we are boiled like frogs. We have ten years. If it's not electric it should be illegal. We need to sunset the internal combustion engine within the next few years. There's not going to be a soft landing.

The southwest is well suited for solar towers. Our wind energy potential is 37,000,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year. Renewables are all easier to live with.

@EvanSchultheis @CannabisFairy69 @sennekuyl @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy I think of biomass as “reuse” as in reduce, reuse, recycle. It may cost more to the environment to dispose of the biomass and biomass (methane) burns cleaner than fossil fuels.
@sennekuyl @CannabisFairy69 @tao327 @EvanSchultheis @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy The US can meet its current energy demands and future needs entirely from geothermal, solar, and wind energy.

@EvanSchultheis @CannabisFairy69 @sennekuyl @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy I think Molten Salt Storage is a better storage solution than batteries, for block size and up.
@EvanSchultheis @CannabisFairy69 @sennekuyl @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy Geothermal is accessible everywhere in the US. Below the frost line is (&lt; 10 feet) a stable store of ground temperature that can be used for cooling in the summer and heating in the winter.
@EvanSchultheis @sennekuyl @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy I believe the lifespan of a nuclear plant is in decades, maybe twice as long as the solar panel.
@EvanSchultheis @CannabisFairy69 @sennekuyl @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy The geothermal power potential of the US is far more than all of the nuclear power plants we could build safely. Geothermal is cleaner, safer, faster to develop, and more cost-effective than nuclear.

@EvanSchultheis @sennekuyl @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy “...safe levels in 300 years” w technology we haven’t invented yet is my point
@sennekuyl @CannabisFairy69 @EvanSchultheis @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy what right do we have, as a cohort of humans, to leave a byproduct that will last millennia into the future when we have an abundance of less expensive alternates. Geothermal is by far more cost effective than nuclear.
@sennekuyl @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy Improving energy efficiency is a good thing, however, it is only part of the solution. If we could instantly make every appliance/car/machine 30% or 40% more efficient it would not get us to where we need to be.
@EvanSchultheis @sennekuyl @rosencrantz1984 @GlobalEcoGuy To be clear, nuclear waste means nuclear energy is not clean. Nuclear waste is not widely used commercially and is dangerous to people and the environment for literally tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.

If we electrify and get our electrical power from renewables, we will have solved the problem.
Renewable energy sources are the key to solving climate change.
What do you mean when you say we have to get our electrical power from renewables? Renewable energy sources like geothermal, wind and solar are the least polluting. That is, they emit little to no greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
An electric motor can do the job of an internal combustion engine and better. Every bus, every car, every truck, every train, every plane, everywhere you see an internal combustion engine today an electric motor can do the job better and save money.
All-in-all, an electric car costs about two-thirds less to own.
Does that mean no more cars? No. As it turns out much better technology already exists and has since the 1800's--it's the electric motor. Electric motors are far more reliable, less expensive, less expensive to maintain and perform better.
Before 2030!
Here's what the politicians are afraid to say--we have to retire the internal combustion engine. Tens-of-millions of human lives are a risk. Soon the earth's ecosystems will be forever altered. Straight and to the point, we have to retire the internal combustion engine before...
What does it mean to electrify? To electrify means if it moves it can move under electric power.
How do we do that? We have to electrify and get our electrical power from renewables.
The cause of climate change is known--it's the greenhouse gasses (GHG) emitted from burning fossil fuels. All we have to do is, stop burning fossil fuels and we've solved the problem.
Now, what if I told you we could avoid all that? Not only can we avoid catastrophe, but we can thrive from our natural abundance.
People will move en masse. Mass migrations will test the strength of civil society. This scenario will be very costly, financially, and in term of human suffering.
What happens is anybody's guess, what most in the science community expect is that the poles will continue to melt. The seas will rise. Storms will make landfall more frequently and with more ferocity, inflicting more damage. Droughts will become more commonplace.
If true, we will be in a world of hurt, and there's not much time is there?		https://t.co/5EdtNH4VOH
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released a report on the climate crises that everyone should read. To summarize, on our present course, it is likely that our earth will warm 1.5°C, above pre-industrial levels, somewhere between the year 2030 and 2052
The human population is projected to be 8.1 billion souls by the year 2025. Meaning, there will be more of us. We will need more and more energy. For more food. For more homes, roads, and bridges. For more of everything humans do.
To address the climate crisis, we must change our sources of energy. Make no mistake about it humanity needs the energy to power its industries. We grow food. We build homes, roads, and bridges. We travel. We move things from here to there. All of our activities require energy.
Today though, China is changing. China is tackling the problem head-on. Closing coal plant after coal plant, launching fleet after fleet of electric buses and installing acres and acres of solar panels. China is adopting renewables at an astonishing pace.
The U.S. and China have got to get their ducks in a row if the world has a chance to address the climate change crisis. China is—we aren’t. China burnt so much coal over the last few decades that their sky is thick and dark and the air unbreathable. They live in our future.
The U.S. pollutes more than any other country on planet earth per capita, and that’s the good news. Why? Because it’s us—the U.S.— that is the problem or a big part of it. We also have what we need to fix the problem. So it's entirely within our power when we’re ready. https://t.co/Pbulwcm9NX

@ClimateBen As for pesticides, electrified in-door farms typically use little to no pesticides. With renewables, like solar, they can be net negative GHG.
@ClimateBen Let me clarify, capitalism insofar as investors, as rational actors, seek the best long term opportunity for their capital. I say, renewables will out perform most other investments. When energy changes everything follows. Economies embrace efficiency.

I should have proof-read this better. What I meant to say was...in a timeframe that will keep the atmosphere below the 1.5C of warming.
There may be better ways to deliver the power, sure, here again, if we do what we know how to do we can get the job done. When we’re ready we have what we need.	When will we be ready?	(25 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Yes, we may need to build more grid infrastructure to handle the additional power. Stringing the new cable may be expensive, however, requires no new invention. And it means jobs. 	(24 of 25)	#ClimateAction
To deliver the energy all we have to do is connect the new electrical power to the grid. 	(23 of 25)	#ClimateAction
At the Geysers geothermal energy plant in California, it took two months to drill down 10,000 feet, another 10,000 is well within our reasonable ability. 	(22 of 25)	#ClimateAction
At 20,000 ft under the surface of the Yellowstone Caldera, the temperature is 600 Fahrenheit, which is plenty good enough to generate electricity. 	(21 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Geothermal energy from our volcanoes is a non-incremental plan to fight climate change that can be done in a timeframe to save the 1.5 degrees Celsius. There is no other plan. 	(20 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Solar and geothermal energy are two sources of energy big enough and readily available to meet the scale of the climate crisis--nuclear is not.	(19 of 25)	#ClimateAction
The United States of America has incredible geothermal energy and it’s not being tapped into.	(18 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Geothermal is more cost-effective than nuclear. 	(17 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Geothermal electrical power is half as much as what we pay for energy now. And it’s clean and green, it’s about 5% of the greenhouse gas emissions as coal and there’s no nuclear waste. 	(16 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Anytime I post about drilling in Yellowstone some says “NO! It’ll ruin the geysers.” A geyser and I like geysers, by the way, is hot water that shoots up into the air. Real high. And if that’s the reason that’s not a reason.	(15 of 25)	#ClimateAction
We’ve put a velvet rope around the sources of energy that could save us and the planet. 	(14 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Here’s the problem with the whole plan, two of the volcanoes—are inside national parks and the other volcanoes around the country (mostly in the west) are scenic tourist areas. 	(13 of 25)	#ClimateAction
The Yellowstone Caldera alone could power earth several times over, and it goes all the way down to the earth’s core. There’s little likelihood we’d run out of hot rock at Yellowstone for centuries.	(12 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Did you know that most power plants work the same? Whether the fuel is coal, gas, or nuclear they all heat water up to make steam. That steam turns a turbine and voila electricity.	(11 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Now hear me out, we can make electricity from these volcanic systems. Not just a little. A lot. And not just for a little while, for many, many, decades. 	(10 of 25)	#ClimateAction
These volcanoes are often called ‘supervolcanoes’ because of their immense size.	(9 of 25)	#ClimateAction
The United States of America is home to several hundred volcanoes (don’t act like you knew that), three of the six largest volcanic systems on earth are the Yellowstone Caldera, Wyoming, the Long Valley Caldera, California, and the Valles Caldera, New Mexico. 	(8 of 25)	#Climate
However, we do have the means in which to change our fate and the fate of humanity.	(7 of 25)	#ClimateAction
The point is, China is serious about the climate change challenge—we are not.	(6 of 25)	#ClimateAction
Now, China has decided to tackle the problem straight on. China is launching fleet after fleet of electric buses. Acres and acres of solar panels. And they are seeing changes, not in climate, in the levels of pollution. 	(5 of 25)	#ClimateAction
China burnt so much coal over the last few decades that their sky is thick and dark and the air unbreathable. They live in our future. They saw the path they were headed down didn’t make sense. 	(4 of 25)	#ClimateAction
The U.S. and China have to get their ducks in a row if the world has a chance to address the climate change crisis. China is—we aren’t. 	(3 of 25)	#ClimateAction
That’s the good news. Why? Because it’s us—the U.S.— the problem or a big part of it. So we can fix it when we’re ready.	(2 of 25)	#ClimateAction
There's a plan that could work for us all. The United States of America pollutes more than any other country on planet earth per person. 	(1 of 25)		#ClimateAction

@Daniel_00000007 @EricHolthaus I don't agree. We have some time, just not a lot of time. We also waste a lot of time waiting for politicians to lead. The #ParisAgreement is evidence enough for me. It is simply a wealth redistribution plan it does little address the cause of climate change and that's -- energy.
@EricHolthaus It's clear what we must do is something that we haven't yet done. Humanity needs the energy to power its industries. Where the energy comes from matters. We have to change where we get our energy, plain and simple.
@PaulEDawson Classic conflict of interest. We can not expect politicians to lead on climate. The oil and gas industry is too big. Too many lobbyists with too much money. However, they will follow if we lead them.
@EricHolthaus Finally! The Marshall Islands targets 100% renewable by 2050, too late. California 100% renewable grid by 2045, too late. Paris Accord phases out gas cars by 2040, too late. These are all the wrong dates. Incremental plans won't get us there.

Climate Change - Part I https://t.co/wi33hBKlrm	#Electrify2025
How far do you think your car goes on two and one-quarter gallons of gas?	#Electrify2025
As a direct comparison, the weight of a Tesla Model 3 is between 3,838 to 4,072 lbs.  A 2019 BMW 3 Series weighs between 3,780 to 4,010 lbs, roughly the same as the Tesla. On two and one-quarter gallons of gas, the BMW will go less than 75 miles. 	#Electrify2025
There is an interesting thing to note, however.  Even though batteries are nowhere near the energy density of fossil fuels, since electric motors are so much more energy efficient, that Tesla Model 3 has a range of 310 miles. 	#Electrify2025
The 2018 @Tesla Model 3 long range has a 75 kWh 350 V lithium-ion battery. 75 kWh is the energy equivalent of two and one-quarter gallons of gas and the battery weighs around 1,200 lbs.	#Electrify2025
One gallon of gasoline has the energy equivalent of 33.70 kWh of electricity and weighs 6.3 lbs. 	#Electrify2025
Fossil fuels, due to their molecular makeup, have a lot of energy inside. Said another way, fossil fuels are very energy dense, a little goes a long way. The energy density of fossil fuels is sincerely hard to beat.	#Electrify2025
Then why don’t we just use sources of energy that don’t emit greenhouse gases? Tradition, infrastructure, and politics.	#Electrify2025
What can we do? If we develop electrical power from renewable energy sources, that is sources, that do not contribute significantly to our GHG total, then we will make a serious headway in the climate change crisis.	#Electrify2025
From the numbers, we see the most impactful way human activities affect climate is how we go from here to there and how we develop electrical power.	#Electrify2025
Business and homes, either directly or indirectly, burn fossil fuels mostly for heat. The commercial and residential sector accounts for a little more than 10% of our GHG emissions.	#Electrify2025
The typical way we generate electricity, around the world, is by burning fossil fuels to heat water to steam. The steam is then used to turn a turbine. The turbine generates electricity [magnets!].	#Electrify2025
About one-third of our greenhouse gas emissions are from generating electricity. 	#Electrify2025
About one-third of our greenhouse gas emissions are from transportation. That’s why paradigm-shifting companies like @Tesla, @Proterra_Inc, and @ZeroMC are so important.		#Electrify2025
We burn fossil fuels to build things. The concrete and steel industries account for most of the greenhouse gas emissions from industry. We burn fossil fuels is the point.	#Electrify2025
What do we do that's so bad? We burn fossil fuels to make electricity. We burn fossil fuels for heat. We burn fossil fuels to move from one place to another. We burn fossil fuels to move things from one place to another.	#Electrify2025
Ecosystems can be catastrophically affected by small disruptions. The ecosystems of the earth are the same way.	#Electrify2025
Before you think to yourself, "Well, it’s just 1% what harm can it do?" the answer is a lot. Think about how much poison it takes to make you ill, or the size of a virus? 	#Electrify2025
The problem is with the 1%. In the 1%, there are gasses like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, chlorofluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. All of them heat up when the sun shines on them, during the day.	#Electrify2025
Our atmosphere is made up of about 78% nitrogen, about 21% oxygen, and about 1% of other gasses. 	#Electrify2025
Since the air molecules are trapped inside the greenhouse, the greenhouse heats up too. This is great for farmers that want to grow plants in the winter, however, it is very bad on a global scale. 	#Electrify2025
Greenhouses allow the sun’s rays in through a transparent medium, like glass windows.  The air molecules inside the greenhouse absorb the sun's energy.	#Electrify2025
In the simplest terms, humanity contributes to climate change by emitting greenhouse gasses (GHG) to the atmosphere. GHG cause the earth's atmosphere to act like a giant greenhouse. 	#Electrify2025
It is important for each of us, to understand how we affect the climate of the planet and what we can do to address the climate change crisis that is unfolding.	#Electrify2025
Climate change affects all of humanity. Everywhere on earth is affected. There is no “over there” when it comes to climate change. 		#Electrify2025 https://t.co/Q7MP5ljVdZ

@rosencrantz1984 @EricHolthaus It's not chicken vs egg--it's just chicken. The simple truth of gov't is there are far too many politicos that make money the old-fashioned way--through oil, gas, and coal. Where there's a conflict of interest people act willfully ignorant. We can educate The People.
@PaulEDawson As long as we burn fossil fuels for energy we are creating more harm than we can fix.
In other words, Yellowstone is a fantastic geothermal resource. Near molten rock is plenty hot enough to boil water for electrical power.	 https://t.co/xZ9MOh9C84

@rosencrantz1984 @EricHolthaus Policymakers are too slow to act on climate. The Paris Accord doesn't phase out gas cars until 2040. That's not going to work. Consumers make choices every day, if we educate the public to make better choices we may have a chance, e.g. water from bottles vs water from the tap.

I am often asked if the electrification through renewables by year 2025 is a realistic goal. My reply is usually to point to our history. In 1930 it took one year and 45 days to build the world's tallest building. When we want to--we do.	#Electrify2025

The downside of some renewables is that they generate energy intermittently. Solar, when the sunshines. Wind, when the wind blows. The grid doesn't store energy, once energy is generated it has to be used immediately. Molten salt solves this by acting as a buffer. https://t.co/AflHCmoqUs

@NickCowern @350 @ECIU_UK @ClientEarth @FT @Independent @guardianeco @beisgovuk @DMiliband @IPCC_CH Agreed. Our best way forward is to electrify through renewables like biogas, geothermal, hydro, solar, and wind. I think our best course is to change our own consumption rather than to try to change the gov't. Thoughts on personal responsiblity?
@AndyOstroy @POTUS The gov't effects the economy through tax policy, trade policy, and economic policy (via the Fed setting the interest rate), and one could say by upholding the rule of law. The economy does not expand continuously, there are ups and downs.

@AndersWijkman Indeed we should. The inconvenient truth is nothing works with fossil fuels in the equation. If we put cars on the road tomorrow with 100 MPG it still would only delay the inevitable. The ONLY sensible course is to electrify through renewables. Everything else is politics.
@AndersWijkman It's a classic case of "The Tragedy of the Commons". What we pay at the pump is largely for the commercialization of the energy product: finding it, pumping it out of the ground, refining it, and finally delivering it-- we do not pay for the environmental impact of burning it.
@AndersWijkman There you've said it! "We need to rethink economics!" The environmental concerns you've raised can ONLY be addressed by including the cost of our environmental impact at the cash register. Simply put, the price at the pump is not the real cost. We need transparency.

@AndersWijkman We pay taxes for services like public transportation, schools, and roads. No taxes isn't an ideal. However, by definition, higher taxes mean an individual has less freedom to do as they please. Higher taxes means less freedom. No taxes means no roads. There's a balance.

@AndersWijkman The problem we are having is not with capitalism. It's with transparency. Generally speaking tax cuts drive economic growth, which is what we see. These are basic economic fundamentals. Better wages are on the way.
