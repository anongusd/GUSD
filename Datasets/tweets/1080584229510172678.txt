When we finally got to Central Square, the only available elevator was broken, so we had to take the train to Harvard &amp; then board a bus back to Central. This detour added 40 minutes onto our total trip time. https://t.co/kuHbU79LPT
At Park Street, where we switched from Green to Red, Dianna showed me that the elevator buttons are often too high for her / too hard to push.
At Lechmere Station in #Cambridge, the train went past the accessibility ramp, forcing us to wait for the next train to arrive, adding 10 mins to our trip.
