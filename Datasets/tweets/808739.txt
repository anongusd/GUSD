@homelessdallas1 You need to be at every table where housing and homelessness is discussed. We need your voices.
Not everyone on Skid Row is on drugs or will offer drugs, but we are seeing more and more single women, young mothers, families, young children, elderly every week. The area is already too dangerous for some.
The politics of sleeping in a tent in Skid Row is painful and dangerous, especially for women -- often if you don't have your own tent, you will have to barter shelter in someone's tent for sex, drugs, etc.  This is common and something folks should know about homelessness.
We've had several instances where we've replaced supplies for our friends in Skid Row-- they're hurt by the sweeps and made even more vulnerable without their tents, medication, food and other items. These are the elderly, transgender, young folks https://t.co/1WGCSwdLxR

@nancywyuen I'm very excited about the first bi member of the house -- it will be interesting to see how all the members interact with him as he navigates his sexuality and understands what he loves and needs.
@nancywyuen Tsubasa and Shion, and their dynamic is really interesting. Tsubasa's dad even said that she's not the "typical girl" and what makes their romance so good is how Shion who presents as a slightly feminine, fell for her.
@nancywyuen about the way he courted Seina, like only someone like him (from whatever region in Japan he's from) would do it that way. But I really appreciate how Shohei doesn't apologize for his emotions -- he's clear about them from the jump. My favorite couple on the show is
@nancywyuen character. He seems at first glance the most "masculine" -- athletic, tan, muscular, stoic, but he cries the most when someone leaves. Shohei is so sensitive and emotional -- a lot of it comes out in his work. I think there was an episode when the commentators said something

crisis sets in. Not everyone on Skid Row is on drugs or involved in any other criminal activity. We see more and more elderly, single women with young children every week. It is getting worse.
she can survive out there and she would rather be with her husband. Most of us on the outreach team started to cry and someone on our team gathered her info so we could get her sheltered right away.		This is just one story. I just wanted to share this so reality of our housing
Shortly after her husband died, she was hospitalized. This took all the funds she had left and that‚Äôs how she ended up in Skid Row. 		I asked her where she was sleeping last night and she said on a chair next to a tent with a couple who were her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.  She doesn‚Äôt know how
She came to us with no shoes on. Someone had stolen her tent and almost all her belongings. We did our best to gather what we could and as I talked to her she started to weep. Her family is in Idaho, her husband‚Äôs family is here but they‚Äôre not close. They have no children.
#homelessness #losangeles 		thread:		I don‚Äôt like posting photos of folks I meet during our outreach out of respect for their privacy, but I met a woman last night who was in her seventies. She lost her husband in May and they were evicted from their home in Long Beach in June.
