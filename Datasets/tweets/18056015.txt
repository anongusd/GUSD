Huge win at the @KWCH12 debate. I am the clear conservative winner.
My opponent wrote a $1,000 check to a pro-abortion special interest PAC that backs Hillary in October 2015. That's not pro-life.
The conviction is a matter of public record. It speaks to his integrity, just like his fabricated ad. https://t.co/j2rEnwgj0i
My opponent talks about Obamacare. I have voted to repeal it and co-sponsored legislation to replace it. #provenconservative
Another issue where my opponent talks about doing something I have already done. #provenrecord
