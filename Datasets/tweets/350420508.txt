RT @TeamLeos: A #Leo loves to give but doesnt expect much because they have their own.
RT @TeamLeos: #Leo's still care, that's the problem.
RT @TeamLeos: Before you assume anything about #Leo try this crazy method called "asking".
RT @TeamLeos: #Leo's have small intimate circles of friends. Large groups of friends bring drama which is a Leo no no.

RT @TeamLeos: #Leo's never gave you a reason to hate them. You're just creating drama out of your own pure insecurity.
RT @TeamLeos: #Leo's are very sensitive, they over think every little thing, and they care way too much.
RT @TeamLeos: #Leo is heartless and sometimes cold but honest and straightforward with love.
RT @Leo_Tweets: When #Leo cries, it's not just over one thing. It's built up anger and emotions that they've been holding in for too long.
