@artxmaverick Believe what you want.  I’ve been coveting independent counsel and special counsel investigations for 26 years.
2). According to the lawyers close to the special counsel investigation, the question now is NOT whether Mueller reports grounds for impeachment...it’s whether new AG Barr releases to Congress or provides his own summary.  Same for Mueller grand jury materials.  #TrumpRussia
@realtruthkings @realDonaldTrump He was under oath when he gave written answers to questions posed by Mueller and team.
@JettGoldsmith @realDonaldTrump Starr report in 1998 alleged 11 grounds for impeachment.  The only difference now is the reporting requirement.  Under the special counsel law passed later by Congress, report must go to DOJ.  Up to AG what is released to Congress.
Lawyers close to the special counsel investigation say the Mueller report is nearing completion and will allege multiple grounds for impeachment @realDonaldTrump including conspiracy, perjury, and obstruction. Report will go to DOJ AG.  #TrumpRussia #MuellerInvestigation

@GentlemansHall Socialism and corruption are not the same thing.  There are many socialist countries that are not corrupt.
@marniehutchinso This isn’t about free speech.  It’s about whether your taxpayer dollars should subsidize a school that pays for kids  to travel to a political rally.  Sorry that’s so difficult for you to understand.  Then again, it’s a tough concept for 3rd graders.
@Ay4Juliana It’s not about “supporting life” or supporting choice.  It’s about giving tax exempt status to a group that spends money transporting people to a political rally.
@GERALYNDOSSAN Black churches don’t pay the transportation costs of the politicians who visit them.  Covington paid for their students to travel to DC.   If you can’t see the difference, you are beyond help.
Interesting to see uninformed conservatives blame Venezuela’s collapse on socialism, when that’s not the reason in the least. Still, if folks are so worried about socialism, they should oppose a U.S.government funded Trump border wall. https://t.co/aNYqOjF9Xk
This temperate response doesn’t sound like the @realDonaldTrump America has grown accustomed to.   Did somebody hack his twitter account? https://t.co/7wCmZdqgy4
@Duckypam All of them?  Name another tax exempt school that spends money sending students to a political rally and I’ll call them out too.
@pdseghers And you think taxpayers should be subsidizing that?  Would you be okay with tax exempt all girls schools sending their students to participate in the women’s march?  Tax exempt schools, no matter the political views, should not be spending $ this way.
@TheDORIANGRAE On whose dime?  Nobody is saying they can’t travel to DC and protest.  The question is whether their tax exempt school should be paying for it or should the kids foot the bill themselves.
Lost in the #media and #CovingtonBoys controversy is this question:  why are tax exempt catholic schools sending students to Washington, D.C. to protest women’s legal rights?

Some indications @realDonaldTrump may refer to the effectiveness of the Israeli border wall with Palestinians.  Keep in mind, a 25 foot concrete wall covers only 1/10 of that Israeli barrier.  The rest is a two meter (6 foot) high electronic fence.  #BorderWall #facts
According to the Department of Homeland Security, 606,926 people overstayed their visas in the U.S. in fiscal 2017.  That was more than the number who tried to cross the border.  #FactsMatter #borderwall #trump
Is the situation along the US/Mexico border a "crisis?"  According to Customs and Border Protection, there were 396,579 apprehensions in 2018.  That's up from 2017.  But, both years are only a fraction of the 1.6 million people who tried to cross the border in 2000.  #facts

James Roche recalls Brett Kavanaugh, his freshman (1983-84) roommate at Yale being, “frequently, incoherently drunk.”  In February 1984 of that winter semester, Kavanaugh turned 19.  The drinking age in Connecticut that year was 20.   #kavanaughdrinking
Kavanaugh told @FoxNews “the seniors were legal and had beer there.”  It’s true drinking age was 18.  But with Feb.12,1965 birthday, Kavanaugh wasn’t “legal” until winter/final semester senior year.  Georgetown prep HS classmates say he drank at parties before then...illegally.

Smart take. Seems like it’s now up to Kerry, Moniz, and others who negotiated JCPOA to weigh in.   Did the deal require Iran’s full disclosure?  Did they (US negotiators) know about the “Amad” program?  Are the IAEA inspectors getting access to all the materials and sites? https://t.co/mebqlkrnuJ
Right.  Except that the Bush administration relied on cherry picked intel assembled by CIA and NSA.  Israel is relying on Iran’s own documents.  It’s a bit different, don’t ya think?  #IranNuclearDeal https://t.co/Hkeswalu5o

???  1) The South Koreans asked Trump to take the meeting.  2). The North agreed to stop all nuclear and missile tests 3) The North said the US and SK could go forward with joint military exercises in April as planned, with no NK response. https://t.co/Vm18DgARCO
@vexedinthecity @maddow I don’t use twitter to promote my employer.  I also don’t say or tweet things for “clicks” or to raise a profile.  If that’s your approach or expectation, please stop following me.  We will both be happier.  Thanks.
.@vexedinthecity Sorry.   I’m always going to put journalism and integrity ahead of places where I used to work.  If somebody is wrong, I’m going to say so regardless of channel or party.  I have enough personal respect @maddow to know she can handle it.
Iran dreamed of nuclear deal that didn’t restrict missiles or terror funding.  Cuba dreamed of normal relations with US without improving their human rights.  @maddow strongly supported both under Obama.  The criticism of Trump/NK meeting is #Hypocrisy + #Trumpderangementsyndrome https://t.co/3B3hk0qUtr
The South Koreans asked him to take the meeting.  He said “yes.”  But you think he should be criticized for not stringing along the South Koreans for weeks/months?  And during that time, NK gets to test more missiles and nukes... Bizarre argument you make. https://t.co/8zrFBP4dX0
New definition of “delightful” — running into the always amazing @Peggynoonannyc on a train platform in NYC, exchanging hugs, and introducing her to my family.   #delightful
Funny, I don’t recall the South Koreans trying to distract from either of those.  They think the meeting is the right move.  Why not let Trump honor their request?  A miss-step is far more dangerous to them than to the U.S. https://t.co/7Ef4SjlwCn
I get the frustration with @realDonaldTrump.  But the derangement syndrome over his meeting #KimJongUn is over the top.  Many dems criticizing talk with NK were convinced Trump would start a war with NK, praised #Iiran nuclear deal + #cuba normalization.   It’s #hypocrisygalore

Sorry to break it to you.  But in the modern political age, most Americans have always voted for/against the person...NOT the policies.  Surveys and political science have proven this for 80 years.  We may not want that.  But it’s reality. https://t.co/AUmK2SDl9U
it’s not about @Oprah being a celebrity + rich.  It’s about her charisma, personality, empathy, + etc.  All the things that made her a TV talk show super star are the same things that make for a powerful presidential candidate, regardless of politics/views. https://t.co/FV9klkGb6E
“A new day is on the horizon...”. @Oprah speech at #GoldenGlobes2018 was a tour de force.   It underscores why so many political pros believe Oprah, if she ran, would easily become America’s first woman President.  And it wouldn’t matter who the opponent is... #Oprah2020

&gt;@realDonaldTrump has appeared in front of live microphones for all of 30 seconds since Sunday night.   Yes, he's been tweeting up a storm.  But why the reluctance to go in front of cameras/microphones? Makes his 2pm WH departure for Camp David something to watch closely.
She wrote that in a later tweet.  In her original, she wondered if it might be real.   Misleading her followers, or refusing to fact check, perhaps because she wanted to promote a claim about POTUS and gorillas.  Irresponsible. https://t.co/MQ0rMaxv2u
