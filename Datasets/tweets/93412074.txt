@carigervin Agree it is federal money and doing away with their collecting and re-disbursement would be the best solution!
@carigervin No we want the money in the form of a block grant.  TennCare is funded 2/3rds by the feds w strings.  We want strings GONE!
@carigervin We don't want more money!  We want the federal government to allow us to use what they are spending in a free market manner.

@ashaynes the system we have now works for Sec of State, Comptroller, and Treasurer.  It'll do nicely for AG too.
@ashaynes court should not pick the lawyer trying cases in front of it.  Appointees appointing AG makes him twice removed from the people.
@ashaynes  do you want someone else picking your lawyer to defend your actions? We write laws for our people. He should defend'em but hasnt
