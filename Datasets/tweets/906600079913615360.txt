@donaldtrumpdbag Hey, your double chin was really visible tonight, during the State of the Union. Just thought you should know.
@realDonaldTrump Walls are inanimate objects. They have to be manned. Walls cannot recognize illegals, and they cannot handcuff anyone, turn them away, or report their whereabouts. Border Patrol Agents, however, CAN.		Save money, AND create more jobs - double the Border Patrol.
@realDonaldTrump "Presidential Harrassment" has quite the Snowflake ring to it. Fitting. Good choice of words, Mr. Prez.		What about what @AnnCoulter has recently said? Care to comment?		https://t.co/AdDsVbUV2H
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan How 'strongly' did he inform you? Did he shout? Or did he just speak really, really aggressively at you?
@realDonaldTrump Well, gee, perhaps because in the 20+ years since the Democrats first brought it up, they did their research and came to the realization that it was a phenomenal waste of money, since walls need gates (ie, Ports-of-Entry), and that's already how most illegals are passing through.
@realDonaldTrump Boy, you're making this too easy to refute-		Saudi Arabia - among the richest countries on Earth, and we're giving them $355k/year in Foreign Aid. Admittedly not a huge amount of money, but - why??		Not nearly as huge as the $3.2 Billion/year we give to Israel. THAT is a Con job.
@realDonaldTrump What, you mean like Saudi Arabia? Cuz we give them $355k/year, and they're pretty damn rich already.		Or possibly Israel, who we give $3.2 Billion to every year.		#thinkbeforeyouspeak
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, that was all the money that we confiscated from them, when we first placed sanctions on them for their Nuke program.		The way sanctions work is: when they're lifted, you return the stuff you took from them. You don't get to keep it, @realDonaldTrump- that would be stealing.
@realDonaldTrump By whom?
@realDonaldTrump So, how are you giving out contracts for building 115 miles of wall, if it hasn't gotten funding approved yet?		Are you *quite literally* writing checks that you can't cash?
@realDonaldTrump I think you're confusing the word "saved" with the word "spent," @realDonaldTrump.		Or maybe "used," if you want to put it more lightly. But spending money is inherently the opposite of saving it.
@SenatorCarper Huh. Good to know. Thanks, @SenatorCarper
@realDonaldTrump Says the man who believes in Tariffs, a relic of Mercantilism that was rendered obsolete 200 years ago by a better trade practice called "Free Market Capitalism."
@RepClayHiggins Put the Bible down, Clay. You can read directly from it all you want, but you've demonstrated you have no idea what it says.
You know, the funny thing is, if it wasn't for the steel tariffs, building a border wall would be a whole lot cheaper...
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, you know Everything better than anyone, apparently.		But did you know that wheels are notoriously ineffective at sea? And have you ever heard of 'ladders' or 'tunnels'? There's nothing better than ladders and tunnels! It's been true for thousands of years!
@realDonaldTrump Even if true - that's now past-tense.
@RepClayHiggins You ever heard of a 'ladder' before?
@RepClayHiggins Well Gee, "Mr. Constitutionalist," if you're THAT righteous, why hasn't Twitter deleted you yet?		I think it's much more likely that Twitter just deletes bot accounts, and the accounts of people who spread hate-speech. Ie, all your friends. Hence your whining.
@realDonaldTrump and what if they were already under-funded? That'd be like demanding that a chef make 3 omelets with 2 eggs, or else you'll take all their eggs away.		Also, those forests are under YOUR management, Mr. President. Dept of Interior. You've just accused yourself of doing a bad job.
A profound thought occurred to me: there are no widely-accepted Conservative fact-checking sites.
@benshapiro @therealroseanne The reverse can be said too, @benshapiro . Eye-opening to see a bunch of kneeler-haters express outrage that the Roseanne show got cancelled. 		Private businesses CAN censure, either way. But which is more overtly offensive? Kneeling, or comparing a black person to an Ape?
@realDonaldTrump &lt;sigh&gt;		C'mon man. Find some tact.
Jim's caption says it all. https://t.co/cGGR8cKKQm
@realDonaldTrump hey, Idiot - then why were you happy to announce their hirings three days ago? Liar.		Ah, that's right - you didn't do your homework at all, and found out after the announcement they were already representing someone in the Mueller investigation, so they couldn't represent you.
@Toekmann Well, I'm actually Moderate, but I do lean slightly Left.
@El79191417 Yes I am! Sorry, I don't check my Twitter account all that often, so I'm just now seeing this. Not sure why I didn't get your FB message, but you're welcome to email me at dave@davelanglinais2018.com
@RichardBSpencer Prrrrobably because they were all Russian bots.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. POTUS, you need to tone it down with your tweets. It does no one any good to lash out at your own Cabinet members and Govt Agencies. Right or wrong, you're sowing discord in your own ranks. As our leader, you need to pull us all together - not drive us apart.
I could pick out four pages worth of text from "Moby Dick," rearrange the sentences and make it about a sailor making pretty-smelling candles, but that does NOT mean that's what the book was about.		But if you've never read "Moby Dick," how would YOU know that I was lying to you?
@Apipwhisperer Somehow it's ALWAYS Obama or Clinton's fault, isn't it?		Stop playing the #victimcard, ya #snowflake.
Dammit, a day late! 		Happy late-Birthday, BoR! https://t.co/ZuBdtLrGh4
Ah, and now I'm seeing politicians start to comment! Good on you, Senator Tom @SenatorCarper !! https://t.co/lwoeySMkUh
@SportsPillowTlk Oh, I'm sure he's been told about Net Neutrality by Ajit Pai ! ðŸ˜…
Trump admin officials are forbidding the CDC from using a list of seven words or phrases: "vulnerable," "entitlement," "diversity," "transgender," "fetus," "evidence-based" and "science-based."		Those last two concepts are what brought us out of the Dark Ages. Now chew on that.
He is not the only LA Rep/Senator to vote to kill Net Neutrality after getting contributions from TeleComm:		Senators:	Bill Cassidy - $34,909 	John Kennedy - $1,000		Reps:	Ralph Abraham - $5,750	Steve Scalise - $121,750		All of whom are Republicans https://t.co/9Vp6w2wtf8
@RepClayHiggins How does a tax reform that eliminates nearly all itemized deductions "grow" the economy? Or inspire confidence, for that matter?
@TerrellMPitts1 And here I am a full week later, seeing THIS response for the first time :)
RT @GenMhayden: @jmclaughlinSAIS If this is who we are or who we are becoming, I have wasted 40 years of my life.   Until now it was not poâ€¦
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @Varneyco Well that would be a pleasant surprise.
@realDonaldTrump No, dude. YOU'RE killing the NFL by making kneeling a far bigger thing than it otherwise would be. YOU'RE the one who's always inciting your followers to rage against the practice. 		Keen as you are on self-recognition, I'm surprised you can't see how much your words affect them.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Yeah, that's not how the economy works. It takes about a year or two, generally, for a President's actions to be reflected in how the economy does. 		So, really, you're still taking credit for Obama's work. Give it another year, then we'll really see how Trump is doing.
@RepClayHiggins You sir are two of three things: 		1. ) A jackass. (this one is certain)		2.) Either a gullible idiot, or a deceitful skunk. Still not sold on which is which.
@feeonlyplanner Man, I'm glad for this whole 'George Papadopoulos' name mixup - ever since that, I've been following you, and your Twitter feed has been quite entertaining!
@RepLaMalfa Yeah, and how many OTHER deductions will the common American lose, DOUG??		Your tax reform is a crock of shit, sir, and you - YOU - need to own up to that, and push for a better one!		My dad always said - ya gonna do something - do it Right the first time, or don't bother at all.
@RepTipton Well, it IS all in the numbers, but - unfortunately the truth is that numbers point to the majority of the American people getting screwed, and Corporations walking, laughingly, to the bank, with our money!		END SOCIALISM! YOU NEED TO STOP TRANSFERRING OUR MONEY TO BIG BUSINESS!
@repdavidkustoff @CFPB Also, I think you misspelled 'Dictator.' 		Seeing how, since you're buddy-buddy with Trump and all, that's almost certainly what you meant, instead of 'Director.'
@repdavidkustoff @CFPB 2 things:		Trump appointing someone would mean they STILL would not be elected, or have oversight. You contradict yourself		When a Republican utters the words "excessive regulation," 9 times in 10 they're in the pocket of a business that would directly benefit from DE-regulation.
@FoxNews @RepMattGaetz No, you would erode the Rule of Law by interfering with the Mueller investigation.		Here's the difference: Mueller is investigating corruption and collusion of a *SITTING* administration. That has immediate and dire ramifications.		Uranium One would just be retroactive Justice.
@RepGarretGraves If we can afford it, then good on ya!
@RepClayHiggins You mean the military that was *already* bigger, more well-equipped, and stronger than the next 10 most-militarized countries COMBINED?		What you NEED to do is scrap the F-35 program, stop building more Abrams tanks when 1,000 already rot in storage, AND PAY THE SOLDIERS BETTER.
@RepMattGaetz The fact that you've been calling for an investigation into this for 3.5 months, and not three YEARS (when this first came to light, was researched, and then dismissed) just goes to prove you're trying to start your OWN witch-hunt to drawn attn away from Russia Scandal. 		SHAME!
Doppleganger GOLD! https://t.co/XLdHiyhNYq
@feeonlyplanner I am so glad I started following you! You put out some hilarious stuff!
@JeffFlake You are a good man, sir. I wish the political situation was such that you did not have to step down after this term; you, McCain, and a few others represent the paradigm of true Republican values and integrity - which sadly seems to be becoming a thing of the past.
@RepMattGaetz You're only fooling the gullible. And thankfully they are not in the majority of Americans.		#stepdownrepmattgaetz
@RepMattGaetz YOU are undeniably conflicted in this case. Why all of a sudden is Mueller such a huge deal to you over well-known events from years ago, THE SAME WEEK his investigation became 'serious' when two indictments and a guilty confession became public knowledge??		YOU should step down!
The trick is to simply recognize that fact! https://t.co/rpt0K50j9U
@ham_op @RepClayHiggins @taxfoundation Also @ham_op I gotta say, I love your handle! I may not agree with you politically, but I do LOVE the fact that you're a civilian HAM Operator! Kudos to you, fellow Prepper!
@ham_op @RepClayHiggins @taxfoundation And the Obama administration DID double the debt, but most of that went to recovering our economy after the 2008 collapse (should have been far longer, and far more severe). It also ignores the fact that the yearly deficit went from $1.2 TRILLION to just $600 Billion.
@ham_op @RepClayHiggins @taxfoundation Ok, so you're saying that you're gambling our collective future on the idea that tax cuts will cause an economic boom, that will then yield more tax revenue. That's all well and good, except that - historically, no tax cut has ever had that result.
@RepClayHiggins Can you please explain this, then? 	https://t.co/CdKwJ11Mcz
@RepMattGaetz @FoxBusiness That'd be wonderful! Would be the first time in decades!
@RepClayHiggins @taxfoundation How about we start whittling down the National Debt first, before handing out tax cuts? The Tax Reform you're pushing is going to ADD $1.7Trillion to the national debt.		Seems like you've got your priorities backward. 		Fiscal responsibility = pay off your credit card first.
@RepClayHiggins @taxfoundation Numerous studies over the past 30 years have confirmed that tax cuts (and 'Trickle-down Econ' in general) do NOT encourage economic growth, job creation, or increased wages. What you're peddling is a Conservative myth. 		Also, @taxfoundation has been accused of deliberate fraud.
How is it that some Republicans think that Uranium One is a matter of grave national security, but - Russian Collusion? Nah. Not important..
@RepGarretGraves And keeps in place the Carried-interest loophole, that hedge-fund managers and private-equity firms use to screw the rest of us! Good ..job?
@RepMattGaetz @replouiegohmert @RepAndyBiggsAZ Don't you think that needs to be investigated first, before crying "recusal"?		Because otherwise the timing looks like obstructing justice..
@GerritGraham @RepClayHiggins Also, the Carried-interest loophole is remaining untouched. Hedge-fund managers and private-equity firms take vulgar advantage of this. Why?
@RepClayHiggins Also, Tax "Reform" will nix the Johnson Amendment - churches can enter politics without losing tax-exempt status. Helps middle-class how??
@SportsPillowTlk @realDonaldTrump Oh, I did right from the beginning..
@TerrellMPitts1 Sorry, whut? Haha! (first time I've logged in since I made the account)
@cracked_belle Touche, madam.
@RepClayHiggins Why are the federal and state tax deductions being eliminated? Why is the mortgage interest deduction being cut in half? Lying, or gullible?
@RepClayHiggins If that's the case, then why are Corporations getting a 15% tax cut? Why is the Estate Tax being thrown out? (only affects +$5mil estates)
@realDonaldTrump Wouldn't have known to put my name on this list, if you hadn't helped him spread the word. Thanks!	 https://t.co/NWBChPXobM
@realDonaldTrump ..You DO realize you're giving Steyer (the man trying to impeach you) FREE ADVERTISING, right? 		Not a very smart man, are you, Mr. POTUS..?
I have zero tweets.		..Dammit. So much for that.
