5/ Why does this matter? Because @BernieSanders is a leading critics of "dark money" in politics ‚Äî money that can't be traced to its human source. And Our Revolution, which has gotten quite political by urging Sanders to run for president, trades in what's all but "dark money."
4/ This makes it impossible to determine who an Our Revolution donor is when some of the names listed are common ‚Äî  "Thomas Hill", "Sharon Smith" ‚Äî or not names, such as "Anonymous Anonymous" https://t.co/LH2kIMNazS
3/ Our Revolution voluntarily releases the names of donors on a quarterly basis, but that's it. Doesn't offer info on the donation amount, where a person lives or their employer/occupation, which is what the @FEC requires for donations of more than $200 given to a political cmte.
2/ They're also raising money for Our Revolution, which doesn't fully disclose the identities of its donors yet could conceivably advocate for a @BernieSanders 2020 presidential bid by running TV ads, digital ads, etc., or otherwise promoting Sanders / attacking his opponents. https://t.co/ik2g1Zv6eu
