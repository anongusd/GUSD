12/Dignitaries from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Azerbaijan have all lodged or rented rooms at the Old Post Office. Even the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak stayed at Trump’s hotel. Journalist @Z_everson has been keeping track: https://t.co/PkiupKu588
11/Abubakar isn’t the only foreign political figure to patronize the Trump International D.C. hotel since 2017. There’s a long list of others...
10/Mason and his lobby firm did not respond to requests for comment. A partner at Ballard’s firm, James Rubin, told us they were simply “promoting free and fair elections” in Nigeria.
9/From the halls of the hotel, Abubakar gave an interview to reporters back in Nigeria. https://t.co/DQ9SHvxfFU
8/Just a few months later, Abubakar had a US visa for the first time in 10 years. His destination? The Trump International Hotel DC.
7/Abubakar’s political party also hired a lobbying firm run by Trump fundraiser Brian Ballard. Politico has called Ballard: “The Most Powerful Lobbyist in Trump’s Washington.” https://t.co/2PZNkcNUzJ
6/Last year, Abubakar hired lobbyist Scott Mason, a former Trump campaign adviser. We found disclosures showing Mason lobbied Congress, the State Department and the National Security Council.		What did he lobby them on? “Visa Issues.” https://t.co/wC1WCPLJfR https://t.co/wpGZXQ0oDs
5/Abubakar was never arrested or charged in the U.S. or Nigeria. He insists on his innocence, and has said he’s never been barred from the U.S. (We also reached out to Abubakar and his party. They didn’t respond. Understandably. They’re busy.)
4/A 2010 Senate report on foreign corruption dedicates an entire chapter to Abubakar and his wife.		The report details their efforts to transfer $40mil in “suspect funds” into the U.S. through offshore accounts while Abubakar served as vice president. https://t.co/TXBnalMory
3/Nearly 10 years ago, Abubakar was reportedly barred from the U.S. for his alleged involvement in corruption scandals 		...including one where the FBI found $90,000 cash in a congressman’s freezer, allegedly a bribe for Abubakar. https://t.co/Ox5eQHqWZr
2/Hanging at the Trump hotel was Nigerian politician Atiku Abubakar and his entourage. Abubakar just came in a close second in Nigeria’s now-contested presidential race. 		The biggest issue he faced? Allegations of corruption. https://t.co/eIfVNM8pYj
