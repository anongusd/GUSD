@TheObamanista @blankslate2017 I totally get that. And they may never realize we nuke the filibuster even if we do it. But they‚Äôll eventually have some sense of whether the policies we pass had a positive impact on their lives and process reforms make the answer to that question much more likely to be yes.
@TheObamanista @blankslate2017 Maybe. But boring process issues like this could be the difference between passing a bold agenda that improves the lives of millions versus tinkering around the edges and heading into the 2022 mid terms against a Trump-less GOP with nothing much to show for our time in power.
@TheObamanista @blankslate2017 That‚Äôs fine. But we don‚Äôt have to be limited to that. We can also spend time during the primary process figuring out who will best address the massive problems we care about that have nothing to do with Trump, and which cause massive suffering across the country every day.
@TheObamanista @blankslate2017 And I‚Äôm aware POTUS doesn‚Äôt have a vote in the senate. But it‚Äôs wrong to say they have no role to play - to the contrary their role could be decisive. It‚Äôs their agenda at stake and their advocacy, public and private, could be the difference on whether you get the votes or not.
@TheObamanista @blankslate2017 Whether and how to make this a big part of your public pitch is a separate question. To me the question is whether people want to do it or not, how to avoid being counterproductive in your public comments in the meantime, and how to decode who is serious and who isn‚Äôt.
This strategy only works if the candidates are working behind the scenes to line up the votes to go nuclear after Republicans block something. Publicly defending the 60-vote threshold is counterproductive and probably ensures they‚Äôre not working behind the scenes to kill it. https://t.co/nwzKwe8ucV

@mmcauliff Caitlin was hired at a different job at CBS, worked there for years and then got the job mentioned in that story. Flores is being hired straight up as an editor with zero experience. Glossing over those differences is disingenuous.

Is that supposed to be reassuring? The real question is whether she‚Äôll  be involved in CNN‚Äôs political coverage. Since her job is politics editor, the answer seems to be yes. https://t.co/Gigi4o9JJ7

@joshorton I think we agree?
@joshorton With the major difference that this time around, there is no Earthly, credible reason to believe Republicans will engage with a Dem POTUS in good faith and deliver a large number of votes for their big-ticket agenda items. Fool me once...
@jbview @MattGertz And is it healthier to design a senate where the big-ticket  legislation passes on majority votes - but is jerry-rigged to fit obscure rules and bypasses the committee process, regular order etc - while small legislation goes through regular order? How so?
@jbview @MattGertz A lot of people want to keep the filibuster so it can be used to block big things they oppose. What‚Äôs the point of keeping it to oppose small things while the big things pass on majority vote?
@MattGertz This is the first election I can recall where the process so clearly decoded policy outcomes. In the past the possibility of ~60 votes and bipartisan work were always real possibilities. Now we know Senate Dems will have low-50s at best and Rs won‚Äôt give us 60 for anything.
@MattGertz And a follow up to your follow up: if we‚Äôre just going to start passing everything through reconciliation, won‚Äôt that just become the standard path? And why not just go nuclear so you don‚Äôt have to shoehorn legislation into rules that were not designed for it?
Booker‚Äôs answer is reasonable. It‚Äôs just important to be clear: if a candidate doesn‚Äôt want to get rid of the filibuster, they‚Äôre pursuing a very limited agenda. On the flip side, those who want to nuke it should be clear that it‚Äôs not possible unless they have 51 votes.
Reporters should ask the question more directly: what exactly do candidates think they can get 60 votes for? The answer is, very little. If a candidate is planning to accomplish very little, voters deserve to know that, and be able to judge the gap between rhetoric &amp; reality. https://t.co/99UzCBgf8u

This is a valid point - we can't stop Republicans from suing. But we can design a process that produces well-designed legislation that is more likely to withstand legal challenges than emergency declarations or bills shoehorned into reconciliation rules. https://t.co/iGKdNYjpNf
[whispers] A Dem POTUS won't have to declare a national emergency if Dems take the Senate &amp; abolish the 60-vote threshold...[wind blows] There's a world where we pass good legislation through regular order and it won't get tied up in court like an emergency declaration would...
McConnell had just seen Boehner get bounced by the Tea Party. He never expected Trump to win, as he's said. He blocked Garland to protect his own ass &amp; won the biggest jackpot in political history. It wasn't genius- it was just rigid obedience to the base. https://t.co/4KLLdOfPIn
McConnell's decision to block Garland only looks brilliant in retrospect. The day Scalia died, there was a GOP presidential debate in the evening where Cruz was expected to call on McConnell to block any Obama SCOTUS nominee. McConnell rushed out a statement to get ahead of Cruz.
This is just the latest example of McConnell caving. Assuming Trump threatened to veto the spending bill, McConnell had a choice: override Trump‚Äôs veto and protect the prerogatives of the Senate, or cave and support a national emergency he knows is not real. He caved.
Since McConnell‚Äôs pet candidate lost the GOP primary to Rand Paul in 2010, Mitch has rigidly adhered to what the base wants at every turn. There‚Äôs no genius to his strategy - he‚Äôs just covering his own ass. It‚Äôs completely predictable and happens without fail. https://t.co/pmfCMl6JAz

@StevenTDennis @OsitaNwanevu @billscher @TheMezcalJones Not always. Tortured routes are largely byproducts of the post-McConnell, hyper obstructionist era. That‚Äôs the point.

The next time a #nevertrumper gives Democrats advice about who we should nominate... https://t.co/t32idNixwR
@StevenTDennis @OsitaNwanevu @billscher @TheMezcalJones Sure. But you‚Äôre still fundamentally trying to shoehorn massive legislation into a process that wasn‚Äôt designed for it. I‚Äôm all for it but if it becomes your go-to move, it seems silly to pursue this tortured route rather than just going nuclear and using regular order.
@OsitaNwanevu @billscher @TheMezcalJones If you‚Äôre going to start regularly passing major legislation through reconciliation you might as well go nuclear. It would lead to a healthier process - regular order, robust committee involvement, etc - and better legislative outcomes than reconciliation.
@OsitaNwanevu @billscher @TheMezcalJones Also, forcing legislation to comply with reconciliation‚Äôs strict rules leads to poorly/designed bills that are extra vulnerable to legal challenges.
The conversation is about Mideast policy &amp; Adelson makes his policy aims explicit. It‚Äôs not an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory - he gives massive sums to secure specific Mideast policy outcomes like moving the embassy to Jerusalem &amp; cutting Palestinian aid. https://t.co/gSCgNdcNTG
@billscher @OsitaNwanevu I know well. And that‚Äôs my point - passing a nonbinding budget resolution is a pain but it‚Äôs not *that* much of a pain. If it enabled you to pass a wave of major priorities you‚Äôd do it. And Rs would have done it in 2018 if they thought they had 51 votes for big-ticket items.
@billscher @OsitaNwanevu After Rs failed to get 51 votes for their single biggest campaign promise of repealing Obamacare and passed up the chance to move a reconciliation package in 2018, think it‚Äôs wrong to assume that there is this raft of right-wing policies that would sail through with 51 votes.
@billscher @OsitaNwanevu Right, but they passed a budget resolution to do ACA repeal and tax cuts. It‚Äôs not a huge challenge. Pretty hard to argue that Republicans passed up the chance to pass a massive wave of right-wing policies because passing a budget resolution was just too hard.
@billscher @OsitaNwanevu Hm. Republicans  could have moved another reconciliation package in 2018, stuffed it with whatever they wanted and passed the whole package with a majority vote. They knew they weren‚Äôt going to have unified control of government for much longer. So why didn‚Äôt they?

@spongeworthy2 @lyle_nubbins Yes. Asking earnestly. Your fellow Americans are asking for compassion to address problems they are telling you are real and whose existence is supported by mountains of data and evidence. Why does that feel like division and not a chance to forge unity?
@spongeworthy2 @lyle_nubbins Why does acknowledging and addressing these disparities feel like division to you?
@spongeworthy2 @lyle_nubbins Many would argue the law does not do that, and at a minimum it‚Äôs pretty universally acknowledged that enforcement is skewed heavily by race, to the disadvantage of minorities.
@spongeworthy2 @lyle_nubbins You‚Äôve made this point several times
@spongeworthy2 @lyle_nubbins To point 2, I think you‚Äôre making my case? I believe all people are created equal. If structural racism didn‚Äôt exist then people‚Äôd succeed or fail at similar rates. Unless you attribute discrepancies to something intrinsic, in which case you don‚Äôt think all ppl are created equal.
@spongeworthy2 @lyle_nubbins I‚Äôm not talking about rich relatives - I‚Äôm talking about whether your family owns their house, has any savings to fall back on, etc. The kind of modest but important wealth that post-war government programs helped white people build while excluding  black people.

@spongeworthy2 @WesleyMouch8 Black Americans were excluded from many of the GI Bill's most important benefits. The narrative of post-war wealth creation hinges on many benefits that whites enjoyed but from which blacks were excluded. But we like to tell ourselves a different story. 	https://t.co/Uc2B0s1eiU https://t.co/leCvJgAD4d

@spongeworthy2 @WesleyMouch8 It's a fact that white people have enjoyed massive government benefits for centuries and many are now cranky now that people of color are asking for the same or at least similar treatment. The story of govt-subsidized, postwar middle-class wealth creation is mostly a white story.

The Founders invented the Senate as a majority-rule body. The supermajority threshold is a 20th-century mutation. McConnell will deny any Dem POTUS 60 votes on everything.

This is a legit objection. The answer IMO is that the party of big social change has far more to gain from making it easier to pass big legislation than the party of the status quo. We should pass big policies then let Rs have at them, instead of tinkering at the margins. https://t.co/gtIvjteNHx
ü§î if you don‚Äôt have 60 votes, it might also mean that McConnell has placed blocking your agenda and generating the impression of gridlock above bipartisan productivity.

@TopherSpiro Agreed on all. My concern is for the scenario a degree or two down from an open and shut case, where there is no smoking gun but still clear Trump did collusion. Dems will need to be aggressive and confident in pressing the case in the court of public opinion. But, we'll see.
@mcbyrne Sorry, too flip. I think Trump is doing a ton of damage on your concern. I also think a clean transition is unlikely &amp; fallout hits others who were complicit. And in general I don‚Äôt think we have much of a choice unless we want to say the leg branch will never check the exec.
@TopherSpiro It‚Äôs fine. What matters now is having a strategy that accounts for the possibility that Trump‚Äôs crime could be direct collusion. I‚Äôve just always been fascinated by the bipartisan compulsion to assume that this would end up being NBD despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.
@mcbyrne I don‚Äôt worry much about pence.

RT @jwgop: Just to state the truth: Everything -- EVERYTHING -- in the dossier is true.
Moving forward it would be a very good idea for Dems to quickly re-evaluate all of their assumptions about what Mueller will find, and to be prepared for the possibility that the finding is clear collusion involving Trump. In that case the impeachment question is not if but how.
But it‚Äôs also self-fulfilling. Dems could have done a lot more over the past two years to educate the public about what the available evidence showed and where this was likely headed. And that effort could have happened on a separate track from the campaign focus on health care.
I think part of it is that Dems have always been assuming that the fight would be waged over less than clear-cut crimes, or less than clear evidence that Trump was involved. That‚Äôs always been a flawed assumption too as some of us have been saying for years (cc @maxbergmann).
I agree and have made this argument (e.g.., Cohen guilty plea). But as someone who has worked on this for a long time I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the unquestioning acceptance of the premise that impeachment of high crimes is bad politics. https://t.co/njhGYnKBHf
The idea that impeachment is bad politics seems like oberlearning the lessons of the last war. It was bad politics when Clinton was impeached but good politics when Nixon was inpeached. Maybe the correct lesson is that the political upside correlates to the severity of the crime.

The Russians didn‚Äôt need to know Trump would win to offer help and Trump didn‚Äôt need to know he‚Äôd win to accept. From Putin‚Äôs perspective, even a good showing by Trump would further his goal of destabilizing our democracy and faith in our instituons. https://t.co/zOTBOXDNLv
Also, given everything we know about Trump, try to imagine a scenario where he accepts the help &amp; does it stealth enough to evade the tuned-in intelligence agencies of multiple countries and, now, Robert Mueller. Where Michael effing Cohen &amp; Stone &amp; Corsi outsmart the field.
Seriously: with everything we know about Trump, with everything we‚Äôve experienced, try to imagine a scenario where Putin-connected Russians - with whom Trump has extensive business interests - offers to help him beat Hillary and he says ‚Äúno thanks.‚Äù Go ahead, try.
The most obvious explanation has always made the most sense. Trump had extensive ties to Russia and when they offered to help him get elected he eagerly accepted. Nothing about him suggests he‚Äôd decline the help &amp; everything about him suggests he‚Äôd accept. https://t.co/NbU7GmkRj9

Pelosi is a "set it &amp; forget it" leader for progressives: she can always be relied upon to find the most progressive position possible under a given set of circumstances. If it's possible to get there, she finds a way. It ain't always pretty, but that's what a great leader does.
It's really hard to overstate how little rank and file members or even chairmen understand about the job of running a caucus. You don't step into it overnight. Paul Ryan is a bad example because I think he's a profoundly weak person but still, look at how badly he faceplanted.
And if you're someone who, like me, thinks the party needs to change dramatically &amp; change fast, then you want Pelosi at the helm. She sees where the party is going and she will get us there. It's really important to remember that Pelosi passed a public option and cap &amp; trade.
Quick thread: real-life stans are people who are there for you all the time when shit gets real. Pelosi is that person fo progressives. When I worked for Reid I saw it firsthand, through good times and bad. Being Speaker is a hellishly tough job and she is insanely good at it.

@RichardRubinDC PS it‚Äôs the way the Senate was supposed to work - the Founders envisioned the Senste as a majority vote institution, the 60-vote threshold is a 20th-century invention and the default assumption that all legislation has to clear it is only decades old.

[coughs] Harry Reid [coughs]. But yes. And in '12 we gained seats to increase our majority when pundits said we'd lose control. 2016 was huge opportunity cost for us, but 2018 could be same for Rs. And in 2022 we can reclaim 2016 losses. It's a long game. https://t.co/h8TyEjItFa

Dems could absolutely win the Senate tomorrow, but they don't need to do so to have a great night. Holding down GOP gains during what is arguably the toughest cycle for Dems in recent history (ever?) would be a huge victory that will pay dividends next cycle and beyond.
Since Trump will claim victory if Rs hold the Senate, remember that Rs were supposed to gain 6-8 seats this cycle &amp; build a red wall that'd hold for several cycles. GOP failing to make big Senate gains tomorrow puts both the Senate &amp; unified control within reach for Dems in 2020.

The first time Dems filibustered *any* Trump nominee early in 2017- say, Sessions - McConnell would've gone nuclear for all nominees including judicial, &amp; lowered the SCOTUS threshold before Gorsuch was nominated. So Trump would get all his nominees &amp; have more vacancies to fill.
I feel like it goes without saying, but of course McConnell would have gone nuclear immediately and lowered the threshold for himself if Dems hadn't. And remember that you can use any type of nominee to go nuclear on all nominees. This is important re: the SCOTUS debate...
"Thanks to Reid, then, Obama has a robust judicial legacy. The Senate confirmed 324 of his nominees to the federal courts, including Sotomayor and Kagan... Obama‚Äôs confirmed nominees set records for diversity; 42% were female and 36% non-white." https://t.co/9Y7G2fuZxt
This is the critical point. We are rightfully appalled at how many judges Trump and McConnell are confirming.

Countless people this morning are reading this birthright news and feeling terrified for themselves and their families. By failing to press Trump on whether this is real and instead gleefully seizing on the sensational, @jonathanvswan and @axios are stoking that fear for clicks.
To be fair, if Trump really is considering and EO it‚Äôs definitely news. But a reporter‚Äôs job should be to interrogate whether this is a real possibility or just the usual Trump bullshit. Instead, Swan leads him into the sensational answer and @axios goes full throttle with it.
I‚Äôd bet dollars to donuts that before the interview, the WH press shop told @jonathanvswan that Trump was ready to make news on birthright citizenship - maybe even specifically on an executive order. So Swan tees up the question in the most leading, flattering way possible.
.@jonathanvswan frames the question as, ‚Äúsome legal scholars believe‚Äù you can end birthright citizenship without changing the Constitution. That‚Äôs a hell of a way to frame an idea that is overwhelmingly rejected by legal scholars.
Watch the clip. @jonathanvswan leads Trump into the birthright citizenship answer he wants.
