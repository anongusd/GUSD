The border may be important, but it’s most certainly not an emergency. Trump admitted this himself. https://t.co/NR1h9u5ZYy
It’s understandable why Congress did this. In a sped-up world, it’s slow and inefficient to go thru proper constitutional channels. But it’s just one step between a prez declaring a real emergency to a prez declaring a fake one. At that point, congress means nothing.
The immediate problem is that Trump (like Obama) is usurping the legislative branch’s authority. The larger problem is that Congress opened the door to this by ceding power to the executive branch to unilaterally declare “emergencies”—real, or (in this case)—imagined...

I'm VERY curious about this vote. https://t.co/ntXDevogLN
If these same Tea Party/constitutional conservatives who (IMHO, rightly) criticized Obama's 2014 overreach go along with Trump's "emergency" declaration, then we will know that it was all partisan hackery/BS (from them), all along. Ditto the institutionalists like McConnell.
This looks like it’s headed for passage—and then a veto. Question: Why are the GOP moderates the ones taking the courageous stand in defense of separation of powers? Shouldn’t this be the constitutional conservatives? Where’s Ted Cruz? Where’s Mike Lee?? https://t.co/12Jd2PzxtO

@TonyFratto True. But in this scenario, Trump may still see this as a “win,” even as it collectively harms the GOP/conservative movement...
Fights happen when both sides think they can “win” (otherwise, one side usually backs down). This is true in the schoolyard &amp; in politics—&amp; it’s why a shutdown may last a long time. Dems are on the right side of public opinion/Trump is on the right side of his base. &amp; so we wait.

@ron_fournier I think people like Ann are frustrated that they finally found a guy who agrees with them philosophically (as much as Trump has a philosophy), yet can’t (or won’t) make an eloquent argument. IF he’s going to engage in a prolonged battle, he will need the ability to communicate
Ann has a point. IF Trump wants to have a fight ove the wall/shutdown, he should make his case—and try to frame the issue. Can Trump use the bully pulpit to communicate a persuasive message—and win the “argument”? https://t.co/W6yzNEYV3z

People like Jim Mattis served as guardrails. They served even as the president’s temperament tested their will &amp; his policy pursuits tested their patience. Now, they are engaged in a mass exodus, just as Trump becomes more susceptible to the provocateurs. It’s getting scary!
And so we enter a very dangerous phase of the Trump presidency. 		The problem with the entertainment wing of the GOP is not that they are politically conservative (that would generally be fine by me) but that they are irresponsible actors.
What explains Trump’s flip-flop for Coulter?		Can a president whose approval rating is at 42% afford to piss off some of his most prominent and passionate supporters? 		Not if he wants to weather the storms of scandals, investigations, and (potentially) impeachment...
The obvious takeaway is that Trump is now almost solely dedicated to preserving his base support; that he cares more about not offending the Coulters’ of the world than humoring the Mattis’.
Coulter warned Trump not to sign a short-term spending bill to keep the government open (w/out wall funding). 		Mattis warned Trump not to retreat in Syria and create a vacuum for ISIS, appease Putin, &amp; throw the Kurds under the bus. 		....Guess whose opinion Trump valued?

That's not to say Macron is wrong about the need to defend the liberal world order. But this real debate only gets mixed up and confused by the "nationalism" term, which means entirely different things to different Americans.
Depending on whom you ask, "nationalism" is (a) synonymous w/ "patriotism," (b) a belief in the nation state (vs. a global world order), (c) a code word for ethno-nationalism (associated w/ xenophobia), or (d) isolationism &amp; an inward	focus (as opposed to internationalism)...

This book (and podcast) will help you understand why Hitler posed as a supporter of Christianity, but plotted to pervert its message, "Aryanize" Jesus, and, ultimately, destroy the faith.
This is a fascinating story, because Pastor Niemöller starts out as a right-wing nationalist who votes for Hitler--but then ends up at a concentration camp. Unlike the more heroic Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Niemöller's story is complicated.

Trump won (partly) because of Reality TV, salacious cable news coverage, and social media. He *exploited* these preexisting conditions. Discussing these foundational problems does not absolve Trump of his sins. https://t.co/OSm9rywE9h
This is true. https://t.co/CC4VNYiDqy
If you’re in the business of cultural commentary, discussing the myriad of factors contributing to a toxic media culture should be heralded (by sophisticated readers) as “nuanced” &amp; “sophisticated” discussion, while ignoring them should be  called “simplistic” or “reductionist.”
You’re right. It’s all Trump. All if it. Trump shot Steve Scalise. He also forged the Dan Rather memo, got Rush Limbaugh a radio gig (after engineering the end of the Fairness Doctrine, and started Twitter. https://t.co/vDmbswDzPg
As much as I have been (and will continue to be) critical of Donald Trump and his rhetoric, it’s also clear to me that ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ is very real. 		I blame Trump for (contributing to) driving some good people in the media (and on Twitter) crazy.
@cambridge65 That is what I have been saying over and over.
Now, if you believe that I am going easy on Trump (by virtue of not *solely* blaming him for the attempted bombing or shooting), then we may just disagree over the level of Trump’s culpability... https://t.co/qaP7hQPGY3

Let’s be honest. It’s not OK for someone like me to (a) blame Trump for his big part, and/but (b) also point out we all contribute to this toxic environment. No—according to my friends in the MSM—the ONLY honorable thing you can do is to solely blame conservatives for everything. https://t.co/vASnjtNY8m

I’d get your criticism if I wrote a column saying, “Mitch McConnell’s ruined dinner = sending pipe bombs,” or “Bernie Sanders = Trump.” That’s not what I said.

@stillabill What liberals did these last couple of weeks fits the textbook definition of the word.
@JNEREBEL Yes, I will. I definitely think latent racism partly explains the rise of Trump on the Right. (There are many reasons for where we are.)
RT @JNEREBEL: @mattklewis Racism is more apt an answer but you will never acknowledge that fact.
@gorskon @MarkHoofnagle Read more closely. You are being reductive. I said that these were two of many contributing factors behind the rise of Trump. I don’t let the Right off the hook.
Yes—I WILL call out conservatives for chanting “lock her up!” It’s horrible. You’ll be hard pressed to find someone who has been more willing to criticize his “side” for bad behavior. Why won’t liberals apply the same intellectual honesty? https://t.co/BKKn1IB6Xu

As someone who spent the better part of a decade chronicling &amp; lamenting the rise of what came to be called “Trumpism” on the Right, it’s worth pointing out that two of the many contributing factors to this were (a) liberal media bias, and (b) the radicalization of the Left.

@PhoenixRLL She’s fine. But I’m not sure she’s getting anywhere.
@dspector3 It’s possible.
Republicans obviously wanted to avoid the optics of having a bunch of old, white men asking the questions. We might look back later and second-guess that decision.
(“Cross examining” would probably be more precise than “prosecuting.”)
Republicans better hope their prosecuting lawyer is just establishing some facts and laying the predicate for some big reveal, later. Because, so far, she’s got nothing...
@Sam_anthas He was replacing Scalia, not Kennedy.
@KarynAmira True. But he also wasn’t replacing a swing vote.
For the most part, Dems have avoided grandstanding or pandering or playing obvious politics, during their questioning of Dr. Ford. Their questions have been pretty brief, too. Lets see if they can keep it up.
(My primary doubts about her occurred during that period of time when it appeared she was attempting to delay—or avoid— testimony about her allegations. )
I’m more than willing to believe that Dem pols would say or do anything to block a conservative judge. Having said that, so far, Dr. Ford seems credible. At the very least, I believe *she believes* her story.

@findingTangle Just passing on admittedly anecdotal info I have gotten (independently) from several center-right friends today--which feels to me like something of a small trend.
@malteseh The people I'm referring to were tepidly supporting Kavanaugh and found Cruz to be a snake oil salesman.
@dark_hawk_98 @BruceBartlett No. I've been speaking at a conference much of the day. Did he do that? If so, I applaud him. FWIW, I don't have a problem with Beto. https://t.co/skCE4c1Wyv
@step4battle The kinds of people who chased Ted Cruz out of Fiola.
@BruceBartlett What have I fallen for? Several people I personally know have experienced a sort of backlash. In the case of Cruz, they generally found him oleaginous, but are repelled by seeing a mob force him &amp; his wife out of a restaurant. That's it, Bruce.
IMHO, a lot of center-right Americans were turned off by Trump. A moderate/sane/moral Dem Party could have picked up some of these good folks. But w/ nobody competing for their support, the Left pushes them back into their original tribal/partisan GOP “corners.” https://t.co/UdhPvs8uzV
@findingTangle I think some of these folks could have abandoned the gop in favor of a sensible, moderate Democratic Party. They hate Trump. But when they see how the Left acts, it forces them back into their original tribal “corners.”
@a81arnold Generally speaking, they tepidly supported Kavanaugh and were disgusted by Cruz (not that they would have voted against him; none of them even, live in Texas).
RT @senatorshoshana: remember when romeny's graphic missing a letter in "America" was a 2 day news story
This is admittedly anecdotal, but I’ve heard from several of my center-right friends today who are turned off by the Left’s attacks on Kavanaugh &amp; Cruz. As a result, they have started solidly supporting them both.

New column --&gt; Hail Mary Time? Maybe the GOP Should Dump Brett Kavanaugh for Mike Lee https://t.co/zyU60BPLBf via @thedailybeast
@a81arnold Completely serious. I have no idea if he’s innocent or guilty, but having her visibly by his side is important for politics.
@DrPMX I believe it would be fair for Dr. Ford to also appear on TV—if she chooses.
It’s important his wife is by his side. Good optics. https://t.co/QP0hxPQmnJ
@johnhawkinsrwn True. But Thomas said that during the hearings. He didn’t really have alternative media to go on.
I’m assuming the Trump team is involved in coordinating this. But if not, Kavanaugh is giving Trump what Trump wants to see—a fighter. Makes it much less likely Trump will abandon him (even if it turns out doing so would have been smart).
To a degree, this strikes me as a norm-breaking move (traditionally, the nominee would probably remain silent and have surrogates make the case for him). But I think we live in norm-breaking times.
If Kavanaugh is going to survive, I think he is doing the right thing by putting out this letter and going on Fox tonight. People are more likely to rally to your defense if they see you’re fighting, instead of being passive. He hasn’t controlled the narrative for a week, now.
@WarGit Yep.
Also, Philip Seymour Hoffman was amazing.
Watching “Charlie Wilson’s War” on a plane. First time I’ve seen it in years. He just said, “I’m close to violating the Logan Act.”  Also, I’m pretty sure he couldn’t get confirmed to #scotus https://t.co/6cqQOOjmlF

@michaelmccusk14 Hard to say. I think that Kavanaugh’s confirmation probably motivated the GOP base, while blocking him probably motivates liberals more. But it’s hard to say whether winning or losing (the feeling of being cheated) is a greater motivator.
