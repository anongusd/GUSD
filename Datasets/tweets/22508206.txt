However, CO2 is not good to all plants, and climate change in general is bad for humans. Many big crops, like corn and sugarcane, don't do much better. And for many of the ones that do better, it's quite limited

@deregtracker True, the AG had the authority at the time, since INS was part of DOJ
And in the declaration, Trump says that the border requires the armed forces (a necessary factor in order to use 10 U.S.C. 2808 absent a war declaration) https://t.co/s8LyshrvOI
Trump is using 10 U.S.C. 2808 to shift resources to the border wall. Among other restrictions, it can only be used in the case of a declaration or war or a national emergency 'that requires use of the armed forces' https://t.co/Pb9SDbINZn https://t.co/PGdbqJNnSc

EPA: No new coal plants likely to be built despite relaxed rule https://t.co/4DcFeGtQVr
It's hard to quote from to make the point, but those 3 judges essentially say that the SCOTUS majority in Mass v. EPA knew that their ruling could lead to regulating power plant GHG, and they were fine with that https://t.co/fWtIWOWOVB
The DC Circuit, however, essentially denied this interpretation in 2012. And judges Sentelle, Rogers and Tatel denied it somewhat more explicitly, on p. 5 here https://t.co/Ib8qlGMSJa
Opponents of GHG regulation have brought up this idea in the past. Mass v. EPA was only about car GHGs, as was the original endangerment finding. So they argue you can get rid of power plant regs without actually amending or repealing the endangerment finding
As others have noted, EPA is also asking whether the 2009 endangerment finding means it can/must regulation GHGs from power plants. Revisiting that would be huge; it's the basis of GHG regulation under the CAA https://t.co/DZTSlxbKvU

Anyway, the public comment period for the asbestos proposal ends Friday. There are 21 comments in the docket, a small fraction of what high-profile EPA rules usually get https://t.co/SWmVrqs5b3
Meanwhile, the bigger criticism is that with asbestos and a slew other chemicals, EPA is basically ignoring the health harms from existing asbestos in the atmosphere. Lautenberg Act gave EPA new authorities on this front
The proposal leaves the door open to EPA approving those uses case-by-case — health advocates criticize this, saying EPA should just outright ban them — but EPA also makes it clear that asbestos is a carcinogen and seems to leave little room for approval
Under the proposal, anybody wishing to start making or importing one of those uses of asbestos would need to notify EPA, giving it time to evaluate the health effects
EPA's June 1 proposal is pretty limited. It identifies uses of asbestos that EPA believes are not currently being made or imported, like floor tile, roof felt and electrical paper
Asbestos currently is not banned at the federal level. EPA tried it in 1990, industry sued, EPA lost. So you can't really allow something that hasn't been banned in the first place
The proposal at issue came out June 1, so it's weird that it's getting all this attention now https://t.co/i2DKWFTMEi
