@thehill I do not like the comment of @RepRashida but @realDonaldTrump has absolutely nothing to say. He speaks very badly, the quality of his vocabulary is of the maternal level, he insults people regularly and his remarks are most often incoherent.	It's embarrassing for a president.
@TrefaultPaulina @ebbenton0303 @SeanRayford @LindseyGrahamSC No it's not and in spite of what Trump said, USMCA is worse than NAFTA.
@ebbenton0303 @jamesfox718 @Hbgmomma @SeanRayford @LindseyGrahamSC USMCA is not a win. Inform yourself before saying that.
@ebbenton0303 @SeanRayford @LindseyGrahamSC 1) The USMCA has not passed yet	2) It's worse than the NAFTA	3) Instead of believing without reading, read and then you will be informed.
