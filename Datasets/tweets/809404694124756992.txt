@UKenyatta We really appreciate sana
When you can't control what's happening, challenge yourself to control the way you respond to what's happening..... That's where your power is
Grace is when God gives us good things we don't deserve, Mercy is when He spares us from bad things we deserve, Blessings are when He is generous with both. Truly, we can never run out of reasons to thank Him. God is good all the time.
When emotions are hurt, danger roams around, therefore check the trend of true love in your relationship... Do you see any trace of affections that guarantees fulfillment of purpose and vision in life?
True love is not by force  or by crooked or craftings, true love flows and soothe the soul of your spouse, when the heart has no peace and always in trouble, then love is no longer genuine....

Successful people are fearless, they fight their fears, they are not scared of failure, they do not care what people say because people change what they think all the time.... Public opinion is fickle learn your mistakes, anarlyze them and correct them ..
Keep going towards your ideas because problem it's not the defeat that destroys you, it's being demoralised by defeat that destroys you. Learn your mistakes, anarlyze and correct them.wish you all a prosperous New Year with new objectives, passions and ideas.
Do not allow ur live be driven by what people say,go by what ur objectives are, passions are what ur ideas are and never ever downgrade ur ideas in a moment of weakness, when u are suffered a setback that's the time to reflect why u suffered a  setback.

Your destiny is not controlled by ur past or present Circumstance,trends of the world do not affect ur destiny, not even the economy controls ur status, God can open doors, shut certain doors, raise people up and sit people down.
He can put u where He wants u as He has the  ability to go  contrary to laws, seasons, nature n even boundaries set by man. He overturns what "they"said were limitations, The Lord is about to set u apart, u are secure in Father's mighty hand 🙏
