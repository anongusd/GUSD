@GrattanMiller @PamKeithFL Because Putin told him to. Not to win but to divide. He’s going to go after whomever the front runner is to weaken them. He’s like Nader. Sit down!
@GrattanMiller @PamKeithFL Nope! Russia has been cultivating Bernie since 1988, just like Trump. Since 1977, 1987, Trump ran in 88. Why is Bernie running for president at 77????????
@Astartiel @KarsinXXX Very fraudulent. Especially her. #bankfraudJaneSanders
@Astartiel @KarsinXXX Why is it that folks don’t get why we are #neverBernie!!
@CCCACF @KarsinXXX @PamKeithFL I’m pointing out that Russia has been cultivating #KremlinBernie over time, just like #Individual1. It’s easy to overlook but he ain’t fooling me
@CCCACF @KarsinXXX @PamKeithFL I get the difference
@CCCACF @KarsinXXX @PamKeithFL *liked what he saw *then (communism)
@CCCACF @KarsinXXX @PamKeithFL Exactly. Bernie like what he saw them but they had other plans for him. #MoscowBernie supports the current regime

@neal_katyal @ChrisCuomo @CNN @vermontgmg I value your feedback so much! You wrote the #SCOguidelines. I love how folks keep trying to tell you what the SCO rules are. Your face says it all. Like b-tch plz I wrote it and I’m telling you what it says and what it means! 		Thank you! You may have saved America.
@RachelMcGonagi1 I’ve been listening to @neal_katyal, who wrote the SC regulations. He seems to be pushing back on all this Mueller is done and that his report will be made public! I’d rather hear it from the horse’s mouth, no offense. Congress will get that report. Barr must notify Congress/us!

@TiaMari489 @CindyCinnis @AOC I’m not being sexist. I’d say the same for #RussianBackedBernie. I’m actually a feminist. I’m no fan of AOC. She threatened Pelosi, on her first day. Who TH are you? You know nothing about Congress and you’re telling others what to do? Girl bye 👋🏾
@TiaMari489 @CindyCinnis @AOC What are you talking about? AOC is a #BernieProtege! Did she meet with #TadDevine or #Credico? I want to know! They’ve both been indicted for their activities related to the 2016 election and Russia. What did #AOC know/see while she worked for Bernie? Was she sexually harassed? https://t.co/VgxEBsbgi7
@Ironyisfunny8 @ajplus Makes sense! All the military vehicles, tanks, ships and planes/jets burn fossil fuels. Those craft need to be solar now!

@robertgowdey Women were sexually harassed on his campaign. Are you kidding me? Bernie only cares about Bernie! What has Bernie done for anyone other than himself?
@robertgowdey Bernie is a fraud bro!
@robertgowdey Yes it is about policy but gender and race matter. Especially for those who aren’t white men. We need people that get it. Obama got it! Trump does not, Bush did not, Clinton did get it! Rare but he got it and so did Carter. But those are anomalies. I want a female president!
@robertgowdey Easy to say as a man. I’m sick of rich white men running America. They just don’t get it. If you’ve not been marginalized, you don’t get it! We need folks that get it, so they are here for everyone not just their fellow white males.
@robertgowdey @owillis @TulsiGabbard @DNC @dccc @BernieSanders Bernie is backed by Putin! Read the dossier. You don’t make it into the #SteeleDossier unless you have ties to Putin...Bernie hired #TadDevine (Manafort’s strategist) and #Credico (Roger Stone’s strategist) on his campaign. They used the same tactics! https://t.co/EWmZOpIibS

@NICKIMINAJ Wait after all the stunts you’ve pulled behind the scenes against Remy, Cardi, Kim. Now you mad? #Karma is a b, and when that boomerang comes back and smacks you in the face, it hurts, right? Probably about as bad as it hurt them, when you created this karma! No shade!
