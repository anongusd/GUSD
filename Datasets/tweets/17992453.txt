@AnnCurry what is the extent of nuclear radiation spread?
@DianeRavitch Maybe because we feel its our job to police the world first and send all our $$$ off abroad in foreign aid
@HuffPostGreen I would have to agree.  Disasters could strike that would cause a meltdown that the best nuclear protocols could not prevent.

@shellieshel thank you!
@acarvin LOL...give me a call after the Messiah comes, my friend....it's a philosophical discussion worth having.  It's not heartlessness
@JoeSudbay my pleasure
@acarvin when the coffers are already empty, how can we keep giving when doing so is a hardship?
@acarvin It's not cynicism, either, but the need for real dollars is so great, and people suffer so much, especially here at home
@acarvin our giving seems to drain away, and several days after Americans focus attention elsewhere, what gains have been made?
@acarvin charitable contributions built the US...Carnegie, libraries, public works, for example.  But our giving does not create any more
@acarvin that we never used to do prior to the 20th century
@acarvin no, Im not.  But our generosity may be part of why our govt feels we need to give so much foreign aid and pay for so much

@acarvin Right.  I contribute too, but isnt this part of the reason for American debt?  Americans feel they need to help everyone?
@DJBabyJesus Maybe all the "choirs" need to sing as one.
@shellieshel my pleasure...Retweets appreciated!  ;)
@acarvin real tragedy in Japan, but with $14T in debt and Americans losing their homes shouldn't relief begin here in the US?
@cbellantoni It may, if WI balances budget, but political fallout & Americans will drown out pluses if rage and #Madison spreads
@jdb820 No.  We shouldn't go overboard.  The constitution's a living doc; but a rights enumeration would make our debt resemble chump change

Obama Flip-Flop on Signing Statements Explained:  http://www.insidegov.org/?p=474
Terrell. What is possible?  I don't have threads. I'm on my blackberry
Obama never gives an apples for apples explanation regarding job loss and job replacement and that is my issue
If 30000 white collar jobs at chryslers world hq are lost, they can't be replaced w 30000 med records data entry in atlanta at $12/hour
In terms of skill, ability, pay, and geographic distribution
The whole thing about the job issue is that the high paying manufacturing jobs being lost are not being replaced with comparable jobs
There are ppockets of healthiness to the economy but many more deep pits of despair
Terrell I'm posting via twitter.  Ill respond fully to yoiu tomorrow.  But I'm from MI and there's a different perspective there
@ChiNurse excellent.  Leave a comment on the site after you read some posts.  We'll get back to you
@ChiNurse we recentl ripped a rep state rep in michigan. Its a recent post. We want responsive and honest govt. That's all.
@ChiNurse thank you. Our mission is to explain how govt works, hold politicians accountable and help people take action
@ChiNurse its twiter and 140 character limitation. Read our posts on the blog. You'll see they're fair and non partisan
@ChiNurse that's your call.  Were after truth and explanations, not song and dance, no matter what party is dancing
@SpectatorDad I'm on my blackberry. What is george loving?
For eric following on facebook:  keep the change bud, apply it to the deficit
@jepaco it is if you live in michigan or other border states
Oh sure.  Obama has time to tackle israel palestine and world peace issues. Mazel tov
@CathyGday I just know that spending more in some areas of the budget requires steep cuts in others to reduce the deficit. Wher're the cuts?
@jepaco if I'm wrong ill stand corrected. But dollar is still way down vs canadian dollar
@ChadHastyRadio ah.  Thanks. Lol
@CathyGday hmmm.  I think I missed fuzzy math in high school.  I was too busy w special topics algebra
@ChadHastyRadio we don't hate change. Plz elaborate
Mr obama.  What specifically are you doing for people who lose there jobs?  How do you replace the old job with an equivalent new job?
@jepaco you are correct, but its nowere near as strong against those currencies as it was a decade ago.  Its just weakened so much.
I'm sorry folks but I don't see the leadership here. Just a tap dancer
@thedecliner I just pray that the worlds of Twilight and Harry Potter are real
The dollar is NOT strong
Who knew Obama was Lord of the Dance?
It looks that way Eric
MY GOD.  Mr president you can't cut taxes spend more and result in a reduced deficit!
I'm so disappopinted obama is being the dem politician instead of acting to cut the deficit and submitting a balanced budget
Agreed eric
@jepaco agreed
@KarenAguilar that is the trillion dollar elephant in the room
So. Reforming purchasing by our govt will reduce deficit in half despite increased spending elsewhere?
So.  Largest military increase in benefits. Nebulous health care and educ spending increases.  What is being cut?
Hillary explained these issues during her campaign.  Ob ama doesn't have the gift of being to explain
Again.  No specifics.
Mexico is off topic
Why not reduce the size of govt and govt payroll?
Sounds like voodoo economics.  8-10 years from now obama is out of office.  How can he pin his hopes on what haapens after his term?
What are:  a whole host of adjustments?
Ok now obama is spinning his wheels
@KateOH lol. That's what I was afraid of
I'm with you mr president BUT where are the cuts and sacrifices to compensate?
Please explain specifically mr president
Wow.  Budget going up nine trillion!  How does that result in a reduction in the deficit by half in his first term?
So whatever else nancy wants
Waffle
Ok now obama is avoiding the question
Is it me or are obamas temples graying already?
Obama is correct.  Todd is out of touch if he thinks americans aren't sacrificing
Bravo jennifer for your followup

@ChairMissing I'm not complaining. I'm posing the question:  will it really make a difference fir those losing their homes and who lost jobs
Obama will submit budget to congress as a blueprint for the future in the next few days. Everyone must sacrifice.
@ChairMissing obama campaigned on going through spending bills line by line to eliminate earmarks
Big words:  I refuse to let that happen.  This is cheerleading. The devil is in the details. Where are the details?
Hmmm. Taxbreaks in our paychecks beginning april first. Thirteen dollars a week?  Mcdonalds will be thankful I can still afford mcnuggets.
http://www.recovery.gov will provide transparency for how bailout money is being spent.

Obama says three million jobs will be created but doesn't say they will be equal geographically and salary wise for the jobs lost.
