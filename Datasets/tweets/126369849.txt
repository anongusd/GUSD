Most columnists for the big newspapers just seem to restate their predilections and preferences over &amp; over. No reporting, no re-thinking, no travel to far-off places to do real eyewitness observation.

@TheSpicyCurry There was a cloture vote on Alito. 25 noes included Obama. Some Ds [Cantwell, eg] voted yes on cloture, but no on nomination
