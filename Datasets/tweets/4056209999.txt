@Michael32112332 @ScottPresler @gbky1 @GOP @DNC I would wish you the were your endeavors not oriented toward my country falling further into the corrupt, racist, homophobic, misogynist, xenophobic, autocratic oligarchy. But you have a nice weekend, too. Bless your heart.
@Michael32112332 @ScottPresler @gbky1 @GOP @DNC The funniest thing about you is that you don't get how fundamentally racist it is to say that 90+% of Black voters who are Democrats are too stupid, gullible, or brainwashed to know which party best represents our interests. #HoodlessKlansman
@Michael32112332 @ScottPresler @gbky1 @GOP @DNC I have many times more actual, real-life Black, Latinx, Muslim, Arab, Pan-Asian, Gay, Lesbian, Trans and other non-ciswhiteheterochristianesque friends and family than you; and our real-life, lived lives are more informed than the uninformed opinions of the bots that follow you.

@Michael32112332 @ScottPresler @gbky1 Keep Black people out of your racist @GOP mouth. Yours is the one party dedicated to #whitesupremacy in the #21stCentury. You are too ignorant to know that; but the 90+% of Black people who are @DNC know our lives, communities, and political needs better than your racist azz.
@ktconlin @ScottPresler Get Black people out of your racist @GOP mouth. You don't know us. You know nothing real about us. Just put on a hood a go burn a cross in a field, you nitwit.
@1122jwhite @ScottPresler Moronic women haters: getting their "facts" from memes since 2010. At least they don't mind the world seeing how gullible they are. #PointAndLaugh
@ScottPresler 1. You're lying. 2. Or maybe you just believe everything you see in a meme. 3. You don't give a single fuq about Black people except as rhetorical pawns to use in  your desire to have poor women and girls lose control over their bodies to rapists.
@washingtonweek In answer to @peterbakernyt's question: why impeach if no conviction is possible? Answer: Posterity. Congress has a responsibility to the Constitution and successive generations to at least attempt to hold @realDonaldTrump to account for his many crimes and misdeeds.

Here we go.

Stop it by making #BigPharma accept less $?
Romney: How is he there and I'm here?
We generally don't export a product to the same country from which we import it, you buffoon.
You are the catastrophe, not NAFTA.
It's called competition.
USA USA USA USA!!!
Ew, #RichSheldonCooper!
More women in CONGRESS than ever before!!!
Many of those jobs women have filled were inCONGRESS!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
You're making shizz up again. #ElPaso
"The areas where needed" so not a wall. Just the status quo.
You won't abolish ICE; but we shall.
Seriously, dude, you really should avoid this sex trafficking subject. #epsteinisland
What about the American lives lost because we can't control white supremacist #MAGAt hate-monsters.
Well, he has lasted over 30 minutes.
The vast majority of violent crimes are committed by citizens, you yutz.
.@realDonaldTrump you are the one using migrant children as pawns. By the way, you shouldn't bring up sex trafficking. #EpsteinIsland
Plenty of working class Americans want to give asylum to refugees from America's drug wars in Central America.
.@realDonaldTrump, no matter how many lies you tell, you're not getting your wall.
@realDonaldTrump you are the threat to our safety, security and economic well-being.
You are literally lying.
Our southern border is out of control because of our arms sales south of the border and our drug hunger above it.
@realDonaldTrump, criminal justice reform is about ending the over policing of Black and Brown communities and destroying lives; not about what you do to make up for it afterward.
Brava Alice!
Jared is basically #SheldonCooper with money
Thanks, @KimKardashian! #CriminalJusticeReform
.@realDonaldTrump Dude, your judicial appointments are atrocious embarrassments!
Thank you, @BarackObama for setting us on such a strong trajectory that even this feebleminded buffoon hasn't upset it.
"The state of our union is strong." Now, you just sound delusional.
Our country inspires only fear and derision globally thanks to you.
#1 net exporter of energy! And killing the planet.
We are also the #1 consumer of fossil fuels, so...
K. That last bit was a boldface lie.
And removing the penalty drove up premiums.
More people working than ever before because the population is the highest ever, you dolt.
Low unemployment! #ThanksObama. @BarackObama  did that.
Wages rising thanks to the progressive push for $15/hr. Ditto, lifting folks off welfare.
We are choosing greatness! By doing whatever we can to get you out of office within the next 2 years.
.@AOC , that's right! Stay seated for this #pabulum.
Yay, more platitudes!
.@realDonaldTrump , you left out that August 20th of this year will be the 400th Anniversary of Africans being brought here as slaves, and thus, of Black America. Also, the 50th Anniversary of #StonewallRebellion and #Woodstock; but ooh, rockets! #DontKnowMuchAboutHistory
Ooh, thunderous applause from the @GOP for platitudes.
.@realDonaldTrump , no, fool, we are hopeful that you and @vp get removed from office.
.@realDonaldTrump will tout "his" @endaidsby2030 program (completely cribbed from #NYState's #EndAIDSby2020 push over the last decade) during the #SOTU. Meanwhile @GOP governors are cutting #Medicaid. So this, like any trump policy that sounds reasonable, is a #smokescreen.

.@JayZeeCincy just embarrassed herself by caping for #WhiteSupremacy. While some facts may have been incorrect in the initial tweet storm, the truth is that a bunch of bigoted White kids from a racist school wearing racist regalia invaded a space of people of color. https://t.co/wZvZIB7RRd
@kahanvict @TamikaDMallory @michelleinbklyn @rtraister And I won't play along with people on the left adopting the @GOP use of Farrakhan to demonize Black leaders and give a pass to the white supremacy that is the font of Anti-Semitism. It's so pathetically transparent.
RT @PaulRabin1: Hey @jaketapper, what were you saying before? https://t.co/0g3AZQwQ4S
@kahanvict @TamikaDMallory @michelleinbklyn @rtraister The fact that you are such a coward that you need to post from an anonymous account is really just a further testament to your lack of value.
@kahanvict @TamikaDMallory @michelleinbklyn @rtraister And no one cares what someone who hasn't even managed to gather 40 followers after 6 years on twitter thinks. You're inconsequential.
@kahanvict @TamikaDMallory @michelleinbklyn @rtraister And I don't "call Jews white supremacists;" I call white supremacists white supremacists regardless of their ethnicity or religion. Just because I call you out on your BS, that doesn't mean I am referring to all of your group. Just you. Tryna cloak yourself in your people. Coward
@kahanvict @TamikaDMallory @michelleinbklyn @rtraister And Anti-Semitism is an invention of White Christendom. Clean up your own damn White House and then worry about us.
@kahanvict @TamikaDMallory @michelleinbklyn @rtraister The attackers were not a members of the Nation of Islam. Fail.
@kahanvict @TamikaDMallory @michelleinbklyn @rtraister By the way, your assumption that you get to decide whom Black people and members of intersectional movements can choose to be a leader is embarrassingly presumptuous. And yes, I will call out that sort of white supremacist ideation every time I see it.
@kahanvict @TamikaDMallory @michelleinbklyn @rtraister Considering the fact that almost every instance of Anti-Semitic violence and property destruction in this country is from white Christians, I can absolutely say that. And when you insist that every @GOP pol denounce #WhiteSupremacist @realDonaldTrump, then you can say that mess.

Wow, @kasie  really stepped in it. People are going in on this post which can ONLY be interpreted as an endorsement, even though she insists that it was not. Chiiiiiiile! https://t.co/3iBshX7CDA

BTW, Royals have been doing coke for decades; but you decide to call the Duchess a cokehead, why. Oh yeah: you're an ignorant bigot. #sad

@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA I didn't think a member of the death cult could keep up the, "I'm such a demure and reasonable lady" act for very long.
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA Wait, does GFOH stand for "Get the Fuck Out of Here"? I feel my vapors coming on!
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA Oh my goodness! "Douchebag" is such an of eloquent term from someone in a death cult who clutches her pearls over "gullible saps." Mmm hmmm. 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA Poor dear. Apparently snark, sarcasm, and irony are modes of communication with which you are unfamiliar and do not readily recognize. Helpful hint: when someone uses the term "the vapors" in 2018, they're probably being sarcastic. Nice chat. Bless your heart.
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA No, you're talking to someone who has been actively studying your little death cult for years. You've apparently never realized that your membership is nothing but a target demo for selling more guns and giving cover to the insane bills they write for their political puppets.
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA And by the way, I'm not venting. You approached me by responding to my tweet and then you got sad because I countered your brainwashing with facts. There's a saying: "Don't start none; won't be none." You might want to adopt that philosophy.
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA So funny that you belong to a death cult whose leadership and spokespeople regularly make jokes about murdered teens; but you get the vapors over a euphemism for a vulgar phrase. I'll say it again: #Fuqouttahere!
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA No, I am anchored in reality. You are anchored in a false narrative created to get you and others like you to be obsessed with owning and celebrating instruments of death. Good luck with all that. Have a lovely day. And bless your heart.
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA My point is that the NRA only exists now to do the bidding of gun manufacturers. You just denied it in your prior tweet talking about the Board. Now you seem to get that you're paying dues to a marketing firm that sows paranoia and racism to get gullible saps to buy lots of guns.
@ckdeblasio @stevelng1267 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA The gun industry gives you all your money. Fuqouttahere with the fake squabbles. You have been duped if you think that the @NRA isn't doing the bidding of the weapons industry. The NRA is a gun industry marketing firm. Sole purpose: get more guns sold.

@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline And they need to be outlawed too.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline They're far less lethal and a mass shooter would injure or far less people. Get rid of them all except for soldiers fighting foreign wars. None for civs, cops, or feds. NONE.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline No, they were older guns that didn't work well with more modern ammo and would frequently injure the shooters.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Well, it's back to revolvers and rifles, I guess. ☹️
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline And the technology to 3D print with metal is being developed.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Like I said, they're on the list.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Their other nickname was suicide specials for EXACTLY that reason.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Most guns that are actually used for self protection by civilians are used in and around the home, not while they're  being carried in the streets, concealed or open.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Ghost guns are on the list.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline And there's a history of people getting cheap flimsy guns for quick jobs:	https://t.co/0AgE7PBrm8
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Semiautomatic weapons are not "most guns."
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline They aren't widely available like they would be if the tech and specs were allowed to be widely available. That's what the court case of is about.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Um...you know that technology improves quickly over time once the money from the sales of a product come in and the technology is spread widely, right?
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Fortunately people of color will soon be in the majority. And paranoia about government taking guns - which literally no one in the GVP movement is advocating - isn't a useful talking point.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Ever heard of a Saturday night special? Untraceable guns are about quick and easy use and then disposal.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Nah, it's a weapons manufacturing issue. That's why we have controls on fertilizer now. Because it's a weapons manufacturing issue.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Yeah, but most of the 3D guns won't be made in homes either. They'll be made in and shipped out of warehouses by criminal enterprises. And most of the people who do make them at home will be criminals and gun-nutters.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline And this has EVERYTHING to do with gun-nutter culture.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Maybe you need to move somewhere that has no government, since you seem to hate government so much.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Criminals don't buy their guns legally with background checks because they can't pass the background checks. The illegal arms trade serves the criminals. And the 3D printed guns trade will do the same.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline You've never heard of organized crime and illegal arms trafficking? Plenty of money. Then there's the drug trade. Ditto
@kylegriffin1 @SethAbramson No. I mean, I would hire him to represent me and I wouldn't kick him out of bed; but no.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Gun-nutter culture props up trump. Read c a r e f u l l y.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline And I have lived in New York City for 33 years (20 of them Uptown: in Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood) and I have never once wanted or needed a gun.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline And that isn't remotely funny.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline No by trying to give an endless line of criminals the ability to produce and trade in untraceable guns, which will a) only ever be used by criminals and b) eventually cause regularly manufactured guns to become less expensive. All of which will lead to more needless deaths.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline By the way, I have never suggested that anyone give up a gun they keep for self protection. I don't however agree with open carry laws or stand your ground laws because they end up encouraging yahoos to needlessly kill and maim people.
@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Of course Cody might be the most morally bankrupt of them all.

@ResethO @chrisbitel @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Which is why your beloved @NRA never defends Black people legally carrying when they're killed by cops during traffic stops. They're very selective in their application of the 2nd Amendment.
@ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Did you read the conclusion? https://t.co/VCugBE5v5D
@chrisbitel @ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Dude, then why are there no Black militia men, doomsday preppers, or race-war preppers? Why is the NRA membership almost entirely White? Beacause White gun-nutters are paranoid AF.
@ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline No, it's actually not. Your paranoia is something to behold.
@IngrahamAngle, thanks for consistently showing the world what a vile racist you are. #RacistAF #WhiteSupremacists https://t.co/HgjTAbPAqx
@chrisbitel @ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Imagine living in a country so steeped in racism that millions are convinced that any attempt to address systemic, historical racism is met by White people hoarding guns and pretending it's about defending against the government. Oh wait...there's no need to "imagine" it.
@ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Except a woman who owns a gun for protection is far more likely to see that gun used against her or her loved ones than she is ever likely to use it for her protection. But you maintain your illusions for as long as they comfort you or until they get you killed.
@ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Actually swords into ploughshares is about turning weapons of war into instruments of peace and community uplift; but enjoy your paranoia.
@ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline Again, we are talking about the human enterprises of weapons manufacture and use. Saying that that area of life is in any way beyond good and evil is an entirely corrupt mode of thinking by an entirely corrupt man.
@ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline And NOTHING that includes human involvement is beyond good and evil. That sort of Nietzchian logic is what led to the rise of Hitler, Mussolini, and Paul Ryan.
@ResethO @Radomysisky @ABC @Nightline That is a completely fallacious argument. Weapons are not tools. They are the complete opposite of tools, hence the "swords into ploughshares metaphor. The only purpose for untraceable guns is criminality. Guns in this country have been weapons of oppression, not tools of freedom

@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP I mean, really darling, you've come to a knife fight with a slapstick. It's almost laughable how woefully unprepared you are to defend your nonsensical assertions. FYI: I have no emotional investment in swatting gnats. It's simply what one does when they buzz about.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP Yes, and one without any cogent rationale to back it up. Bless your heart.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP My dear little klansman, I've seen many 10-15 tweet responses to white supremacist idiocy. And you're taken aback by three or four? Honey, maybe you shouldn't be on the twitters . It seems a bit too taxing for you.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP Ah, so you're unable to face the facts, so you choose to police my "tone." Do you realize just how typical you are?
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP And anytime a White man uses the word "All" to counter a Black man's argument, one knows that that White man is afflicted with white supremacist ideation and needs help.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP You are going to have to face that fact or live in a bubble of delusion. The facts are readily available. If you choose not to see them parading about with tiki torches, then that's on you. You are responsible for not putting on the spectacles to correct your myopia.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP The Republican party has been the official party of the sort of white supremacist ideation that you espouse for FIFTY YEARS.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP Nixon was taped stating that the drug war was a war on Blacks. Reagan was horrifically racist and essentially started his prez campaign at a Philadelphia, Missippi klan rally. The Southern Strategy of the @GOP was racist to its core.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP You won't comment on it because you cannot deny the basic truth  For the past 50 years, excepting '77 - ' 85, Republicans have wrecked the economy and Democrats have saved it. Those are basic facts.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP You missed that part about the last 50 years. That means 1968 to the present.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats @GOP I mean, really, it's the height of white supremacist ideation to believe that over 90% of Black folks vote against our interests when all empirical evidence shows that it's a majority of middle and working class Whites who consistently do just that.
@rabbi_oj Um...the only ones trying to normalize pedophilia were the entirety of the @GOP when they backed #RoyMoore and enslaved teen rapist @realDonaldTrump.
@rabbi_oj @TheDemocrats Because, believe it or not, people of color understand what is in our best interests far batter than people in the @GOP, a party that has been the political arm of white supremacy for the last 50 years.

So, folks, we have a choice in this world. We can allow the Outrage Huffers of the world to fill us with doubts about ourselves and our friends or we can just take the cue from Jay Z (and President Obama) and just brush the dirt of our shoulders and keep on keeping on.
You cannot get inside my head or under my skin by imputing false motives to me, by mischaracterizing me, or by accusing me of the thing you spend all your time accusing half the world of doing. It doesn't work. It just makes me discount everything you have to say. 4/
What this person did not understand about me, because she does not know me from Adam, is that I am a finished product. I know myself. I love myself. I do not doubt myself. No one can undermine me. You can call me misogynist or a self-hating Black person. It won't matter. 3/
In this thread moving forward: When I refused to accept her mischaracterizations, denigration, and insults as valid and provided her with chapter and verse as to why they aren't valid, the Outrage Huffing began. 2/
Well, Outrage Huffing is not limited to racist Republican operatives and pundits. Recently, I have been on the receiving end of Outrage 	Huffing from someone who felt the need to come to my feed after insulting, mischaracterizing, and denigrating my friends for days.
Outrage Huffing is going apeshiz over the President having been in the same living room as Bill Ayres.
Outrage Huffing is freaking out about The First Lady's sleeveless dresses.
Outrage Huffing is pundits waxing crazily over a tan suit worn by the President.
There is a form of social and public engagement that for years I have called "Outrage Huffing." We see it constantly from the right wing. We saw it constantly during the Obama administration targeting the President, the First Lady and even their daughters.
@SheWritesToLive Sleep well Miss One
Proudly giving no fux to haters since 1967.
@SheWritesToLive Riiiiiiight, and you haven't been doing everything to disprove any display of facts that RAR has presented. #ontoyou #knowyourgame #seerightthroughit
@SheWritesToLive I could comment on a pair of black shoes you were wearing and you'd accuse me of misogynoir for it. Screencap away!
@SheWritesToLive The original Nurse Ratched was a White lady. And the modern use of the term, while stemming from Black vernacular, is not gendered.
@SheWritesToLive I prefer that your letters of your your names and handles not touch my thumbs in succession.
@SheWritesToLive Then why the ratched "sooner than he thinks"?
Sooner than I think? Chile we've been expecting you at tomorrow's meeting since Thursday. Whether I shall choose to meet you or not remains to be seen.
https://t.co/54x1fhjrgB
Went to. Dived bombed. Whatevs.
You can bring your cray cray to my space; but I won't treat it like anything other than the cray cray that it is.
@SheWritesToLive No, I'm actually not defensive at all. I'm just pointing out these gaping flaws in your argument. It's what I've been doing all night.
@SheWritesToLive No, when a man of color points out the irony of a bunch of women of color suposedly calling out racism all the while erasing the presence of a man of color whose actions disprove their narrative, it most certainly is not anti-Blackness.
@SheWritesToLive Yeah but you write it while I'm wriring a response and I don't see it until after and then you respond to my response and the cycle renews.
@SheWritesToLive I'm just ironically pulling the "You disagree with me, therefire it most be due to my race/gender/orienraion/serostatus trope. (I almost kept it going with: And you can work in HIV/AIDS and disparage poz people, just like Black folks can be anti-Black.)
@SheWritesToLive Thank you for discounting my existence. That won't read well to gay, Black HIV+ men on twitter.
@SheWritesToLive It is a list of goals we have had in the group for over a year. It's the same list thar every majority White lefty activist group has had since ACT UP days.
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny From my perspective, you sought me out to mistreat a gay, HIV+ man of Color.
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny See my comment re the constant privilege-checking. Oh and I forgot able privilege.
@SheWritesToLive I honestly don't know what you hope to achieve. I don't think you want to join. And the White RARers and we Cis RARers and straight RARers spend so much time checking their privilege, that any more and we won't have time to plan actions.
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny And it always has in our meeting, in our actions, and in our interpersonal interactions. Your attacks on us prompted defensiveness in some, anger in others and dismisiveness in others. But our varied responses to you all have one thing in common. They are in response to you.
@SheWritesToLive Except, once again, as long as I know I am not, you just keep throwing around the calumnies to your heart's content.
@SheWritesToLive Well those are the effects you are having.
@SheWritesToLive Oh lawd, lawd, lawd!!! I done said de wrong thing and miss Tamela done seen't it. I'se gwine get whupped fo sho!
@SheWritesToLive What could you possibly be hoping to achieve. Undermining? Destroying? Disbanding? What?
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny I really don't care. I'm not a relatively privileged White guy or  lady you can cow into guilty submission.
@SheWritesToLive I didn't put up a post targeting "women of color." I put up a post stating that "some women of color" were erasing a gay, Black man.
@SheWritesToLive I am sure you do. But as long as I know there is none, I am fine with that.
@SheWritesToLive Yeah, it is. To me, that is exactly what you are doing.
@SheWritesToLive Except that we do. But that contradicts your chosen narrative.
@SheWritesToLive And again, my organization doesn't have a problem with Black women. One Black woman who thinks she represents all Black women has a problem with my organization.
@SheWritesToLive Perhaps you haven't heard, yelling is a common response to being attacked.
@SheWritesToLive Yes, you have in these tweets that you have been tweeting at me tonight.
@SheWritesToLive If you walk into my home and tell me that my brother just killed your dog 15 minutes ago, when I have been sitting with my brother watching TV for the last two hours, I will discount your perception.
@SheWritesToLive Sorry, you ATTACKED US AND READ US FOR FILTH FOR 24 HOURS BECAUSE OF A POORLY WORDED STATEMENT AND THEN YOU WONDER WHY WE'RE NOT NICE TO YOU.
@SheWritesToLive Please stop using buzzwords light gaslighting. I am trying to have an honest conversation with you; but you want only to attack, denigrate and heap scorn.
@SheWritesToLive I am talking about my actual experience with these actual people doing actual work, having actual socializing, and actually growing to love amd respect them. Some I have known for decades, some for a few years.
@SheWritesToLive Because it completely disproves the narrative you proffered about RAR actually distancing ourselves from Patricia.
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny And that literally makes no sense in response to that tweet.
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny Because if I were being erased by a bunch of men of Color, I would and have called it out. And if I were being erased by a bunch of wypipo if any gender, I would call it out as well.
@SheWritesToLive Because my perception us based on 19 months of actual experience and yours is based on 5 days of virtual experience and 30 minutes live and a few phone calls worth of actual experience.
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny Yeah, because if it were, I wouldn't have been there since before the group had chosen our name.
@SheWritesToLive Yeah, that was combative. And insulting. I am not asking anyone to sing my praises. I am pointing out that the work that I did to support Patricia on 7/4 before you had ever heard of her is being ignored because it doesn't fit your chosen narrative.
@SheWritesToLive So, I am not able to discuss my feelings on my own twitter feed? Did I call out anyone by name. No. I spoke to my own experience.
@SheWritesToLive Cruel? How?
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny I am not combative. I am however snarky on occasion. You came onto my feed to be combative. Read your first comment. I also have no woes. So I certainly am not blaming anyone for woes I don't have.
@SheWritesToLive @riseandresistny You have not addressed a single fact that I laid out. You are so committed to your narrative that you cannot see anything else. As for me, I was brought up in a matriarchal family. I have nothing but respect for strong women. Especially strong women of color.
@SheWritesToLive And no, some members of our group, myself included, had an issue with you. You are not every woman of color. It is not all in you.
@SheWritesToLive No, I am stating a fact that you and your twitter platoon erased me. And I am only referring to you particular women of color, not all women of color. But you are proving my point about your chosen narrative is set in stone.
@SheWritesToLive 10. That's it. I have a timeline I could email you. But I doubt you want it. The narrative you want seems to be set in stone and unshakeable. That's on you. I'm going to keep organizing with these wonderful people of all colors, genders, orientations and religions. Good night.
@SheWritesToLive 9. As for your Medium piece, I read it yesterday. You confused a person you engaged with online but waa not there with a person who did not engage with you online but was there. One of them I have known since he was in high school and your characterization of him was ridiculous.
@SheWritesToLive 8. Once your narrative was in place, it was all that mattered. As for your visit to our meeting (which was supposed to be about dealing with the Supreme Court): I believe that your experience was the fruit of a poisonous tree, a tree you poisoned. (I arrived as you left.)
@SheWritesToLive 7. ...they are somehow racist wypipo using this Black woman. Never mind that that narrative infantilized a 44 year old strong AF Black woman. Never mind that you erased the Black, gay man who voiced our collective support and concern for our friend and comrade. ...
@SheWritesToLive 6. And because my existence and the work that I did on this action did not fit your narrative, it was erased by you and all others who decided that my friends and comrades were in the wrong. Not they were exhausted after 9 hours of activism and made a mistake. But that ...
@SheWritesToLive 5. Again, I, a gay, Black man representing RAR, in full consultation with Martin, whom you met Thursday, lauded Patricia before her name was even released by law enforcement, and therefore anybody was saying, "Say her name."
@SheWritesToLive 4. I discussed our particular concern for her as a woman of color about to be engaged by law enforcement. I also discussed what a wonderful, active addition she had been to the group. I described how smart and passionate she is. ...
@SheWritesToLive 3. In those statements to the press (which were made beginning 5 HOURS before the hastily written press statement that upset you) I expressed our collective  unconditional support for Patricia and our concern for her safety. I discussed our work to get her legal representation...
@SheWritesToLive 2. I made these statements to the @nytimes, @NYDailyNews, @WPIX, @CNN, @nypost and others starting at about 4:30pm. The statements I gave to each news org were virtually identical to each other, but for updates with new information from the Island. ...
@SheWritesToLive 1. No, I was referring to the erasure that people in social media perpetrated upon me. As the designated press contact for that July 4th, I gave statements (made in consultation with my fellow RAR organizers) on behalf of RAR to the multiple major outlets.

@Billharmon20 And my outrage for the detentions was just as great under Obama and Bush. Trump, unlike Obama and even Bush, just commits 1,000 other outrages against the ideals, morals, character, and honor of my country and my constitution DAILY.
@Billharmon20 Actually it is racist when it is targeted at Black and Brown immigrants exclusively. And the fact that you don't get that, by your standards, the European people whom we fondly call "settlers" and "colonists" were actually uninvited illegal immigrants to this land speaks volumes.

@4rch1p3l_4g0 @scottishbking And I call you a coward or a bot because you are either afraid to show your face or name or you are an entirely fake presence created in a Russian warehouse. Show your face and name when you spew your racist ignorance; otherwise you are immaterial.
@4rch1p3l_4g0 @scottishbking No, it's because you ask stupid questions. Africans had been trading and traveling all around the Mediterranean for thousands of years. Very few were enslaved after the fall of Rome. Until Euros started "conquering" the west and enslaving and murdering the indigenous over here.
@RealJamesWoods is such a loser. https://t.co/dLEUV6OhrM

@4rch1p3l_4g0 @scottishbking No idea why I responded to the tweet of a coward hiding behind a fake picture and no real name.
@4rch1p3l_4g0 @scottishbking In North America, there were plenty of Muslim slaves and NO, ZERO, ZILCH, Muslin slave owners. At least until White Christians beat, tortured, and raped them into being Christians.
@Jorge58706040 @DuzzinsSama @RacistJeanne @scottishbking Before The Mayflower by Ketone Bennett, Jr. Bye. You're in your own now. Blocking.
@Jorge58706040 @DuzzinsSama @RacistJeanne @scottishbking Actually, don't bother. I am not responsible for improving your education. And I don't need to hear about the deficiencies of your white supremacist indoctrination.
@scottishbking European slave traders killed scores times more Africans than that in the Middle Passage. Anyway, blocking your pathetic, bigoted ass now. Bye!
@Jorge58706040 @DuzzinsSama @RacistJeanne @scottishbking You first.
@AbeFrohman8 @enjen99 @riseandresistny Because a bunch of bigoted morons and gullible saps bought a con-man's lies. There's a reason 80% of New Yorkers didn't vote for him. We know him best.
@Jorge58706040 @scottishbking Better historians that weren't and aren't white supremacist apologists for European Christian barbarism.
@Jorge58706040 @DuzzinsSama @RacistJeanne @scottishbking What you're saying is what we call the Euro propaganda created to excuse their wholesale barbarism.
@Jorge58706040 @DuzzinsSama @RacistJeanne @scottishbking The rapes were RAMPANT.
@Jorge58706040 @DuzzinsSama @RacistJeanne @scottishbking Bull. The gold went back to the Vatican. You don't build churches out of gold.
@scottishbking No. Euros altered the millennia old practice of war-captive slavery into a slave trade at the point of a gun threatening to enslave one kingdom/tribe if they didn't help enslave another. Then in America, altered it again into chattel slavery, while making up lies about Afr tribes
@snj_dlb @riseandresistny A factual statement is no gloat. You don't know me, Patricia, or any of the people in our group. You are judging based on a  hastily written &amp; poorly worded statement. That is your right. As it is ours and mine to give additional information to correct a false narrative.
@AbeFrohman8 @enjen99 @riseandresistny Ahhhh white supremacist, homophobic, anal apertures, all you have is ...well, nothing that anyone wants, respects, or values. Just ignorance, hatred, and epic gullibility. Bless your hearts.
@Clintstoise @riseandresistny Perhaps you'd care to add a "Hmmph!" to that tweet.
@AbeFrohman8 @enjen99 @riseandresistny As if we care what some MAGA hat wearing, racist AF, ICE supporting, homophobic trumpalumpa has to say. Don't you have a cross burning to attend? A lynching? Dragging someone being a truck?
@snj_dlb @riseandresistny Yeah we issued a poorly worded statement while we were busy trying to (and succeeding in) securing the best legal representation for our sister. But haters gonna hate. Revel in your negativity. We'll be supporting our sister.
@Clintstoise @riseandresistny Wanna be a hater, be a hater. We're busy supporting our sister.
@ScrappyChaos @prisonculture @riseandresistny Don't believe every misinformed supposition that people make.
@Jorge58706040 @scottishbking You know you're buying lies that gold stealing Euros told about the people they were busy murdering and raping, right?
@DuzzinsSama @Jorge58706040 @RacistJeanne @scottishbking No dear. You plundered civilizations, raped their women and girls, and made up lies about them to excuse your  eventual genocide against their peoples, then converted them to a Christianity that your murderous missionaries never actually practiced.
@scottishbking You mean like counting all those murdered through the genocide against native peoples and those murdered in the middle passage, through the plantation system, Jim Crow and beyond. Oh and those nuked in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Need more?
@prisonculture @riseandresistny Our members will be at her hearing in force along with her legal representative tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Patricia and her attorneys will decide what public statements to make from then on.
@prisonculture @riseandresistny We have been working non-stop on getting her the best possible legal representation since she made the climb. We have gotten it and are securing funding for it. We have not been able to see or speak to our sister and are therefore not speaking extensively about her sitch.
@scottishbking No one is following you. We just keep an eye in you in case you get in the lynching/cross-linking/raping-pillaging mood as you're known to do.
@scottishbking We've been trying to deport them back to Europe for centuries. But the infestation is too severe.  Thankfully they are slowly becoming sterile and seeking melanin enriched people to have babies with and are becoming browner with each successive generation. #FuqTheWhiteOut
@scottishbking No, the Spaniards seized all the wealth, money, and power. The people who migrate are the descendent's of the Aztecs and Maya whom the Spaniards enslaved and murdered. Damn, wypipo are so  ignorant of history.

@Glad2bGsMom Well, since God is the largest abortion provider (miscarriages) and He does it to fetuses, blastocysts, and embryos that are planned and wanted, it must be OK for women to seek medical assistance in terminating unplanned, unwanted ones.

NOPE NOPE NOPE. You are trying to make these students do independently or at their parents' expense the job you are paid for. Summer reading is intended to inculcate a pattern of reading literature for pleasure; not to sneak in curriculum.
I attended an elite private school. We had a list from which we CHOSE 3 books. This was when we had 12 weeks of summer vacay. 100% of our grads entered college. But we had excellent teachers for the other 9 months. And you demand 5 books with only 8 wks? Plus mandatory SAT prep?

@iowamachine @angusparvo @therealroseanne @ABC @RobertIger @espn @KeithOlbermann That is just one point. Your party consistently goes against abortion in cases of rape, incest, and women's health.

@iowamachine @angusparvo @therealroseanne @ABC @RobertIger @espn @KeithOlbermann @RealCandaceO @kanyewest @DiamondandSilk And the answer to your question is that the #whitesupremacist @GOP routinely undoes @DNC advances for POC when they take power. @realDonaldTrump and @jeffsessions are currently undoing the criminal justice reforms made under @BarackObama and @EricHolder.

@iamwandasykes, thank you for leaving @RoseanneOnABC! #JohnGoodman &amp; #LaurieMetcalfe, do you think Dan and Jackie should run off together this summer and leave @therealroseanne far behind?
It's official: @therealroseanne is dead to me. Racist AF. @ValerieJarrett is about 100× more attractive, poised, educated, sophisticated, knowledgeable, and worthy of attention than RB or anyone in her family. @THEsaragilbert, @DisneyABCTV time to pull the plug on @RoseanneOnABC. https://t.co/VbiNUWni7T
@ABC  @Nightline "Mexico: The March Toward Hell" is my new mantra.
@mhendr61 @wilw No, responsibility lies with the US government that has been destabilizing Central American governments for over a century and the US populace's hunger for drugs that the US made (and pressured Mexican and Central American gocts into making) illegal.

@Douglas17383124 Uh....no. It has not always been played before sportsballs play-play. And if you are more upset by people kneeling during it than you are about citizens being brutalized and murdered by police, then YOU, Douglas, are un-American. In fact you may be a Russian bot.

@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon And that is complete BS. Israel has been a non-stop war zone sonce 1947. Thanks for showing your idiocy.
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon @DNC Poor little Hillbot. They programmed you well.
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon Nope. 100% true. Try readinh some African journalism instead of listening to Missy Anne's lies as she stirs her tea. #Bamboozled
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon Bernie was only known as Bomber Bernie to Clinton operatives and gullible idiots who don't understand dirty campaining. Oh, and Israel is soooooo peaceful now. 😂😂😂😂
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon Once the idiots like Clinton and Bush committed our soldiers to tge war, it would have been treasonous not to adequately fund it. Chiiiiile, you are so slow.
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon She got millions more votes because the @DNC helped her fix the primary system and admitted it in court. Poor little Auntie Tom. Just can't deal with proven fact, can you?
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon Yeah, you just keep pretending that facts are a conspiracy and not dealing with reality. Poor little deluded antisemite.
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon Obama entered at Hillary's insistence. And the reason was to undermine the development of a Pan-African currency to rival the Euro and the Dollar. So, keep supporting racist international banking interests, Dearie. Enjoy your Barcalounger in the #SunkenPlace
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon That essay was a satire. How typically Clintonite to take something out of context. You just keep washing Missy Anne's dirty drawers, Auntie Tom. #gurlplease

@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon Not to mention Clinton's Iraq War vote, her insistence on plunging Libya into anarchy rather than allowing Khaddafi to   complete his Pan-African currency project, her family's plundering of Haiti after the earthquake...
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon And let's not forget about the disgusting anti-semitism by which you Clintonites were clearly inspired.
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon And, you're the one who got fooled by Missy Anne Reynolds, who, by the way, managed to lose to a racist con-man because enough voters recognized just how corrupt she is.
@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon Little one, you responded in a thread started by my tweet with your illiterate memery. And I am telling you I'm not going anywhere because some sleeping, brainwashed Clintonite thinks I should. You, though, may feel free to get to stepping until you get woke.

@VettingBernie @SenSanders @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon Darling, learn to compose a tweet that is decipherable, and then maybe we can have a conversation. 	P.S. Text memes of falsehoods do not a solid argument make.

@VettingBernie Oh, gurl, please spare me the prattle about imaginary sexism among @SenSanders supporters. Especially those of us who were begging @SenWarren to run B4 Bern announced and are behind @CynthiaNixon now. It's sooo tired and transparently bullshiterous.
