@JustSomeDamnFoo @GreyHouseDan @IlhanMN in what universe do you think they are doing that in? You don't have to believe anything with a "victim" group attached to it.

@mattgaetz maybe his nickname "Coonman" was not him as well, must have been an editorial typo........riiiiiight
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro whoa, ok we part here.....you're getting lost in idealism and reality
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro because if we DID recognize transgender as a sex, then it would be protected with anti-discrimination law. The media can characterize the ruling as "Tran ban" or w/e but it's merely a ban on adding a 3rd sex to the list.
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro exactly! there's no other sex to add, so a bloke that wants to identify with anything he wants CAN join the military, the decision is that the military would not recognize "Transgender" as a sex to enter the military.
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro maybe in your utopia, but in reality religious beliefs most certainly do have relevance to the treatment you get
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro not relevant? tell that to the people next to you while under fire
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro no.......because we didn't allow it.........
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro I mean sure, I guess.....there are Dr's in all parts of the world that disagree though, and would def be treating certain groups differently if not withholding treatment completely
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro I understand the surgery isn't required, but it could then be requested and forced to be paid for by the military or again lawsuits.....we have non-discrimination laws on the books, if we add another sex, then we have to protect it under those laws as well.
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro the stress of deployment/combat, the mental fortitude it takes to be in the jungle for who knows how long
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro it's not as simple as you want to make it out to be
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro but it is or it's open to lawsuits
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro but nobody should be put in financial ruin for following his/her religous beliefs......again, the patient isn't left on death's door, this would be done way before any health issue arose to any kind of magnitude
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro agreed, and if they made that decision, I'm sure they would be in a different field very quickly either by choice or loss of license. The bill just protects them from lawsuits for following their conscience, it wouldn't prevent them from losing their license.
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro there are sooo many accomodations that would have to change if we introduced T's in the military, including sex changes paid for by the military, and that's not even touching the argument of the stress or mental fortitude
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro I disagree, we would need to setup a 3rd bathroom everywhere and anywhere the military is deployed or it would be discrimination, all forms would need a 3rd option, new programs for training like they have for females and males...otherwise it's lawsuits for discrimination
@Zakading @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro agreed, but I think they are coming from a standpoint of trying to save those who's souls they deem need saving, might be crazy, but I've seen crazier. My reasonable answer would be it goes against biology, IMO reproduction is the only point of life
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro protecting a specific Dr to withhold because of his religion is correct, it's not like you are being denied care nor are you being left on the operating table
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro conversion therapy is dumb, I agree	TG military ban is common sense, has more to do with cost for such a small small small percentage than anything else
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro how is he not letting you live? that's my point, it's made up oppression
@wanton_soup @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro this is what my point is exactly! you are of the mind that "not agreeing" is the same as "being intolerant"....that's so off base it's flat out crazy. Can someone not agree to something yet be tolerant?
@Zakading @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro K, this thread was started about an actress claiming it's Pence's hatred and intolerance leading to the violence. I disagree, all she is saying is "agree with something or you hate it"
@Hungy4hotpocket @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro you mean like this?	ya I agree, Islam is very hateful and calls for death, unlike Christians who might believe you are going to hell, but they don't plan on sending you there early because of your orientation https://t.co/Pf6XyaNJCt
@Zakading @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro but I only see hate coming from one side, I see a lot of accusations of hate made against one side, but rarely do we see it in action. Then on the other side, we see the hate almost constantly, just check out any political Twitter feed.
@Zakading @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro just like their churches or summits hurt literally nobody
@Hungy4hotpocket @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro can you show me please? seriously, maybe I'm living in a Utopia or something, I fail to see all this hate and oppression that you feel homosexuals encounter
@Hungy4hotpocket @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro not fueled by hate at all, in that case they are trying to save you from burning in hell, not trying to burn you themselves. Where is this homosexual oppression/hate that you feel so strong about?
@Zakading @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro and I agree, I could care less about someones sexuality, I do have issue with the idea that not agreeing equates to spreading hate
@Zakading @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro but they feel obligated to have marches and parades? I wish someone would point me to all this homosexual oppression in America that I don't see.
@Hungy4hotpocket @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro how YOU choose to take something does not define hate from another. Do you think when a family member tells you to stop drinking or something else they find digression with, it's always fueled by hate? it seems to me, there's an idea of "agree with me or you hate me"
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro but by disagreeing with homosexuality, you are claiming "hate for what people are".....there is no hate, it's morally wrong to some
@Zakading @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro you've lost me, by your logic, why disagree with anything? what's the point? Why disagree with God? Why disagree about different tastes in music/food? Just by disagreeing, the law is not oppressing you
@omeagoz @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro I would say people are people regardless of sexuality, we may have found where we disagree. I don't think anyone's identity is existence is defined by their sexuality.
@Zakading @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro but nobody is saying you can't be homosexual, that's my point.....where is the oppression? People have turned 'not agreeing' into oppression, it's simply not. Now if a Muslim threw a homosexual off a roof, then that would be violent and oppressive. https://t.co/e3aUxPD2HJ
@Hungy4hotpocket @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro you've got a strange definition of "hate" and a weird characterization of "so filled with hate".......where or how do you come to those sentiments?
@CaprockDemocrat @poncho_nevarez https://t.co/WfBFKrtn2Z
@lolax121 @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro not at all, but characterizing his beliefs as the reason for the violence is asinine.
@Hungy4hotpocket @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro I'm sorry your existence is defined by your sexuality.
@hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro wut? just scroll up man, this was about that actress saying it's Pence's fault for spreading hate......but if you are just going to take out what you want and accuse people of lying, g'night...why do leftist always resort to name calling?
@Wicked_Raptor @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro I'm assuming you are talking about the "Family Research Council" summit? are you saying people can't congregate with others than have the same beliefs?
@Appleofmyey @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro you might want to research those 2 things some more, the SC of our great country does not allow banning gay marriage, and I agree the gov shouldn't be forcing anyone to do anything, like make a cake. He has not forced anything on anyone
@Appleofmyey @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro I disagree, I assume you are referring to Indiana SB101?

@Hungy4hotpocket @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro if your sexuality defines your existence, we are already on different pages
@patrick_andrew_ @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro so then fine, let's just assume we both agree for a sec, his opinion is immoral....that to you equals hate?

@patrick_andrew_ @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro do you think we should have laws that make it a criminal offense to have a thought?
@patrick_andrew_ @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro people will always disagree and have every right to do so, but to equate that to hate is silly and childish. You present a strawman argument
@patrick_andrew_ @hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro and the law was changed to reflect that is was wrong, you are mixing up individual thoughts and political law. Just bc Pence is a homophobe, doesn't mean there's hate. The law says no discrimination, the law says gays can get married
@IngrahamAngle The Thatcher is strong with this one.
@EddieHudson @IngrahamAngle Damn you're dumb
@hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro You think not agreeing with homosexuality is hateful? Grow up man, people throughout life aren't going to always agree, that doesn't equal hate.
@hutchinson @jtLOL @benshapiro you're right you can't, because it's subjective.....so again, please point to this rhetoric from Pence that you think a point has been so eloquently made		Realz over Feelz please

@jdindavenport @KamalaHarris I don't need to be convincing, if you watched it all happen in real-time, with no pundits, it was plain for most to see with their own eyes what a sham it was
@tdhseattle82 @KamalaHarris I watched every minute of the SC nomination, no rose/onyx colored goggles here, no pundits adding their own adjectives, just watch without someone else telling you what to think

@bluewatersong she's compromised now, I believe she was the part of the group that intentionally instigated the spectacle, it's sad how they play politics at this point. The reports are there, the judiciary committee knows all about Feinstein/Harris , she's a sac lamb
@KamalaHarris that's great that you know how to appeal to emotion. Can we hear your version of "American values"? I'd like to know your foreign policy. I'd like to know your view on the EU. I'd like to know if you plan on cleaning up the DNC.

@hzahwa @IlhanMN My use of the word "seen" might have been the wrong word in my characterization of MLK's sentiment, I meant it in the spirit of not judging by skin color, hence being blind to it, and judging strictly on merit.
@hzahwa @IlhanMN I'm Japanese/Hispanic/Caucasian btw, I agree. What I don't agree is getting into position BECAUSE of your skin color, racism works both ways, positive and negative. There is no reason we should be filling positions  not based on merit but on race.

@creedreader @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems how do you not see yourself as fascist when you say there is too much of me because of my surname? You are literally using someones name as ammunition to push your agenda, so crazy.
@creedreader @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems lol don't know, never thought to count them....
@creedreader @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems what a weird response. I'm assuming you are virtually yawning to signify you are bored with something? If you didn't want to continue the thought I don't understand what a virtual yawn does. To get back on topic, do you feel that women can't represent you because you are a man?
@creedreader @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems The females I know don't have to share genitalia with their government representative to feel as if they are being represented. A man can represent a woman and a woman can represent a man for political views and purposes.

@Glenofthe @KamalaHarris I disagree. For reference, I live in TX, I have 2x marijuana convictions to my name. A border wall would reduce drugs, more than just marijuana, tremendously. Don't confuse having a wall and 'end all immigration'...the USA has the best immigration process in the world.
@Glenofthe @KamalaHarris I'm not anxious about brown skin either, kinda strange you bring that up, I'm more concerned with drug/sex trafficking. Certainly you agree that a wall would reduce drugs coming in from Mexico?
@KamalaHarris you're using "financial anxiety" as emotional ammunition to push your agenda. I don't like MY financial anxiety imposed upon from penalties/taxes imposed/mandated by my government.

@hlphoenix @SenWhitehouse well sure, we went through the Industrial Revolution, and Industrial Age. Which lead to the many innovations he have today in alternative renewable energy. My point is that this is not a partisan issue that Dems should be standing on.

@CoryBooker @tedcruz  @JohnCornyn On wealth inequality - The first and most impactful thing that can be done to fix wealth inequality would be to stop all the tax evasion from over shore havens. Trickle down economics doesn't apply when the excess is being stashed away off-shore.

You don't have to wear a label. Outline to yourself where you stand on important issues. Then during an election, research(actual voting records, not media opinion pieces) the candidates up for vote and make a decision based on who best represents your values.
I had no idea so many people can't accept reality. Reality &gt; Opinion. Truth &gt; Feels. How can people not just take facts and then make a decision based on what good for them and their families. Why does tribalism trump common sense?
@cmebtl @JamesEdmondston @kristenschaaled speaking of conditioning, none of those things are true. Do you not see YOU are being conditioned? Opinion is not greater than reality.
