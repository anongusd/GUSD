@AmelixBratton @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler Maybe, but a lawyer would tell you there is already firm precedent on that. Having a hard and fast rule for anything leaves out the ability to account for unforeseen circumstances. That is why precedent coupled with some wiggle room to account to changing times is smart policy.
@AmelixBratton @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler The Senate acts as the jury, but The Chief Justice literally adjudicates the trial. https://t.co/vBJYmVlup1
@AmelixBratton @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler The courts make law in their rulings. There are a number of laws that we live under that are a result of Judicial rulings rather than Congressional laws. Every action taking by government lies within the Constitution and the Courts have the power of Judicial Review.

@AmelixBratton @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler first, a political decision as you have said, the House can impeach whenever they think they have the votes to do it.
@AmelixBratton @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court also presides over a trial after an official has been impeached, so there also is a direct influence of the courts on the removal of an impeached official. Regardless of any of that, whether or not an impeachable offense has been made is
@AmelixBratton @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler Since the courts have established guidelines on what constitutes impeachable offenses, those are the rules that Congress is bound by. Unless they pass an amendment to the Constitution.
@AmelixBratton @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler The interpretation of the Constitution is determined by the courts, an act of Congress can be ruled unconstitutional and so the courts do have a role to play in impeachment.

@SiggyBizel @CNN No, I want their economic policies. Stop rewording my words and just listen to them. Their ECONOMIC policies are what makes them strong, not their superficial characteristic. This tribal thought is primitive and it's holding us back. Do your research.
@SiggyBizel @CNN Why does it matter? Who told you it matters and what evidence have they given to make you believe that? The US has had a social welfare system since the 1940's and we are incredibly diverse. Stop drinking propaganda without doing proper research. https://t.co/Ty8CDHqJ7W
@el_shoeberto @CNN No its not, we were talking about US poverty and you posted a GLOBAL poverty level that I responded to was a terrible indicator because of India and China and their terrible conditions. Why do you believe more billionaires equals less poverty? That simplistic and false.
@SiggyBizel @CNN Your homogeneity line has nothing to do with their economic systems. That is just a nice way of saying brown and black people make things worse just because they are brown or black. Belarus and Russia are also very homogenous and smaller economies than California.
@el_shoeberto @CNN You posted a GLOBAL  poverty statistic. That includes China and India. Are you actually serious?  You can't be this dense.
@el_shoeberto @CNN No, that is false. You are completely wrong and everything I have shown you is evidence of that fact. You're ignoring facts and choosing to live in a false reality the rich have fed to you. No reasonable person could honestly review this evidence and maintain your perspective.
@SiggyBizel @CNN Wanna bet? Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand all of them have people who are more satisfied with their lives. How about I just post all of the countries that kick our ass in many ways. https://t.co/4Qvg7Yagwi
@el_shoeberto @CNN No, not anyone can do it. If for all intents and purposes people had a 99% chance of staying in the lifestyle they were born into, but still had a 1% of getting out, that is not a chance, that is a lottery ticket.
@el_shoeberto @CNN I'm sure those Chinese and Indian people living on a whopping $10 a day think they sure are out of poverty. You're joking right? Most of the world's wealth is held by a group of 30 billionaires. 30 people having more than billions.  https://t.co/bfq7F1djsU
@el_shoeberto @CNN That is where you're wrong kiddo. Being born into wealth is the best chance anyone in this country has to make it big. The American dream is a lie. 		https://t.co/ghL7e0GWFx
@el_shoeberto @CNN You have no evidence to support your claim, you're just spouting hot air. https://t.co/45WNumFZXx
@SiggyBizel @CNN So I should have to give up my home because people like you think we're hunky dory? I should leave behind my entire family and friends because some folks refuse to wake up and smell the corruption. lol, no, not even close. We're going to change this country to work for everyone.
@SiggyBizel @CNN The predominant factor in low wages is the lack of regulations and corruption.  Companies are making record profits yet almost 80% of Americans are still living paycheck to paycheck. That isn't due to low skilled workers, its due to runaway greed and corruption. https://t.co/PMd4SCAArD
@SiggyBizel @CNN The USA is most likely worse than I think it is. I've only scratched the surface on my research. People actually live and work under an oligarchy, Government does the bidding of the rich how can you not see that? How do you not think that is bad??  https://t.co/45WNumFZXx
@SiggyBizel @CNN I mean everyone pays taxes so everyone gets healthcare. The amount of taxes we pay will be less than the private premiums we pay because the actual cost of the medical service is lower than insurance companies charger us. The difference is taken by them as profit.
@SiggyBizel @CNN UBI is a band-aid on the problem that exists and will persist for as long as we continue to innovate. It also isn't incompatible with open borders, we need people to immigrate here to work. It adds to our economy. Add a citizen or work requirement to UBI, boom problem solved.
@SiggyBizel @CNN With coming to your own conclusions regardless of any additional information I share? Because if you are this talk is pointless.
@SiggyBizel @CNN We don't need a wall. Immigration from Mexico is a net zero, and many people are coming here because their countries are literal war zones. Is that your base level of acceptable living conditions??? Have you even read anything I have given to you as evidence or are you content..
@el_shoeberto @CNN Its a problem because being born into wealth is the best chance anyone has at living an actual dignified life. The extreme levels of income inequality are literally creating hereditary caste systems.
@el_shoeberto @CNN Its a problem because people are literally starting to die earlier because of the extreme levels of income inequality. The lives of their children are unlikely to become better. They are more likely to commit a crime or become addicted to drugs. https://t.co/45WNumFZXx

@NotaBot23780875 @CNN That is false, 18 million Americans live in abject poverty. Another sign that your information sources are either false or you are making this stuff up. Extreme poverty is likely to be exacerbated if the current levels of income inequality persist.  https://t.co/45WNumFZXx
@NotaBot23780875 @CNN No we are not, greater than 70% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. They have no economic freedom. Wealth is zero sum when someone creates it and receives a minority fraction of the value they just created. That is our system and that is unjust. https://t.co/5dgbWe5O5d
@el_shoeberto @CNN I've laid out why income inequality is a problem. If you want to continue to ignore it, I am not going to waste my time. Google/Apple do not hire enough to offset the number of people who are going to be unemployed. https://t.co/3Uv0LIVtq1
@el_shoeberto @CNN America's wealth is a product of its people, but the people are not receiving compensation and investment equal to the value of their work. It is parties and gross spending for the rich and barrel scraping and crushing debt for everyone else.
@SiggyBizel @CNN The historic low tax rates that have led to this gross divide in living standards among Americans can only be addressed via taxes and investment.
@SiggyBizel @CNN The solution is to tax and invest. Invest in infrastructure, invest in education, invest in renewable energies, invest in medical care for everyone, and yes, invest in people directly via UBI.
@SiggyBizel @CNN No, no they are not. The poor in the US are on the same levels as the poor in any other country. They have little hope for social mobility and are becoming closer to indentured servants or peasants than at any other time in our history. https://t.co/Mqojj65u24
@el_shoeberto @CNN It is a problem because it leads to the political and economic environment we currently live in. Wealthy elites buying government, media corporations doing the bidding of wealthy elites, the vast majority of Americans falling closer and closer to becoming indentured servants.
@el_shoeberto @CNN Another shallow point, most of the jobs that are being produced are McDonald and Walmart level jobs. This is not a great substitute for jobs that people could actually raise a family on. They are jobs that require 2 or three of the same kind to even live on. Economic oppression.
@NotaBot23780875 @CNN wealth, that is unjust. And it creates an environment where freedom comes at a premium. We are only as free as we are economically free. And the rich are increasingly and unnecessarily restricting that freedom for about 70% of Americans. That has to change.
@NotaBot23780875 @CNN They are directly correlated. There is only so much wealth produced in a system. The growth you keep hearing is the amount of additional wealth being created in the system via the production of goods and services. If a huge minority of a population takes the majority of the
@el_shoeberto @CNN proposals that would address the problem of income inequality in concert.
@el_shoeberto @CNN You underestimate the scale of the AI revolution. And no, not all of those jobs that have left see an equal increase of jobs in new sectors. That is a colloquial saying that doesn't mean anything to the people actually losing their incomes and economic lives. UBI is one of many
@el_shoeberto @CNN That is a strawman argument. Where did I say that is the only solution. The AI revolution is going to lead to millions of unemployable people who have families. UBI is going to be a necessity. But so is also investing in education and a (good paying) jobs guarantee.
@NotaBot23780875 @CNN I think the income inequality to the extent we currently have is bad. Want to correct that idea you have there. If you have a dude who has billions of dollars in the same country as a dude who is homeless, something is wrong with society.
@SiggyBizel @CNN You know what that map is also of? Its a map of where people predominately live in the US. This map is statistical white noise. You can read in a way to confirm your already held beliefs or you can actually analyze it. For Pete's sake, Texas is grouped with California, lol.
@CNN Wouldn't have to donate so much if the income inequality in this country wasn't the disaster it currently is.

@tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein "We can't pay for it" is a conservative argument to handicapp ambitious projects. Fact is, we can pay for it. It would be easy for us to. All it takes are people in those seats who believe we can. That is our only limit.

@jennifro @Kpad3300 @mrvndn I already replied to you.
@jennifro @Kpad3300 @mrvndn He got tens of thousands of Amazon workers a raise. He has completely turned the political conversation from 08 centrist politics to stuff that would actually help the American people like		Medicare for All	Green New Deal	$15 minimum wage		Bernie is the OG of this movement.
@Kamalaallday @T_FisherKing @yashar It is the weaponizing of identity that has exacerbated the problems with our country. People have no decision on the circumstances of their birth, so why take that into account when considering the merits of their anything. Not to do so would be going against our values.
@T_FisherKing Proponent of civil asset forfeiture- cops declare you are guilty and take your money because they "think" you're about to commit a crime with it. 		She is the establishment's candidate and her election would only see American become even more of a police state.
@T_FisherKing Defended Californian's three strike laws- taking money from private prisons	Pushed to criminalize teen truancy and threatened to throw parents in jail for their kids missing school. 	Tried to dismiss a case critical of solitary confinement (torture)
@T_FisherKing Harris's record: 	Refused to do her job and prosecute Steve Mnuchin	Laughed at legal marijuana (being a proponent of the new Jim Crow)	Refused to drop charges on an INNOCENT MAN because it would hurt her record		https://t.co/hQPdyFMpis
@T_FisherKing @yashar Nope, she is unclean for: 		Being against body cameras on police officers	Massively Pro Israel and has spoken at AIPAC	Refused to do her job and prosecute Steve Mnuchin, that guy who kicked grandmas's out of their houses	I got plenty more, gimme a sec ;) 	https://t.co/hQPdyFMpis

@jennifro @Kpad3300 @mrvndn False, and bluepilled. You're either misinformed or willfully ignorant.
@Kpad3300 @mrvndn He got tens of thousands of Americans working for Amazon a pay raise from the slave wages they were working at before. Stop drinking the cool aid the establishment want you to drink. How about you do some research of your own rather than continue to be a drone.

@Zuasibel That is completely asinine. The influence of the Israeli lobby is such that the US continues to be an ardent supporter of it despite their values and policies being directly opposed to US values of equal right and protection under the law.
@Zuasibel You are misinformed. I am not arguing the state of the Israeli lobby 30 years ago. We're talking about the state of the relationship TODAY. Are you saying because there were no rapport between Israel and SA 30 years ago, the Israeli lobby has no influence on US policy today???
@Zuasibel Iran continues to be an enemy of the United States in part due to our support to an extreme right wing apartheid regime that goes by the name Israel. They sought nuclear weapons to defend themselves against US regime change, because of their opposition to Israel.
@Zuasibel the way of a two state solution and peace in the middle east, and that is entirely due to the power of the Israeli lobby.

@Zuasibel Why are you shilling so hard for the Israeli lobby? No reasonable person would say, yes only Israel shouldn't be allowed to lobby. But the effects of their lobby are uniquely and disproportionately effective. 		The effect of the lobby is Iran continues to be an enemy of the US...
@Zuasibel and if there is an anti-Israel lobby, then they're doing a pretty shit job at it. Worry over your nothingburger while I defend our freedom of speech and domestic and international sovereignty.

American Jews being offended someone brought up that Israeli Jews lobby our politicians are missing the point. There are state actors lobbying our politicians! If American Jews are offended by THAT, they can stay offended.
@justicedems @IlhanMN To clarify, any apology is going to and has been misconstrued as walking back the actual ideas she was trying to communicate. That being the Israeli lobby has a disproportionately large inference in our government. The msm, will take this and use it to validate this influence.
@george_cothran @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN No, she did not. Nothing in her statements hinted at those conspiracy theories. She was speaking TRUTH to power and bringing a light to the Israeli lobby and its power in our government. If Jews unrelated to Israel took offense, maybe its time we stop rushing to be offended.

Can anyone tell me why the only thing establishment right and left wingers can agree on is, it is the gravest sin to criticize Israel? Why is our government passing laws making it illegal to boycott them? Why are they making people apologize for criticizing them?
@ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN How sickening is it to see the response to criticism of Israeli lobbyists in this country. It is bonified group-think and good-speech. This shit is Orwellian and ya'll are eating it up. American interest, not Israeli should dictate our politics. @IlhanMN did nothing wrong.
@IlhanMN You did nothing wrong. Screw the establishment politicians for putting Israel over the American people.

@alexnpress Democracy in the workplace is and should be the economic model in a civilized society. As it stands now, businesses are legal oligarchies in their structure. And no, they aren't meritocracies either. No one votes for boards of directors.
@DavidMDrucker @chlobert_ @kristinegWP @rachaelmbade @washingtonpost That line is arbitrary and it exists because of the undo influence in our culture from Israeli lobbyists.

@Gatorplanner36 @AOC rather than bank on speculation. If corporatists managed to open a history book they'd have learned this by now, but short term profits and running out of the back with the cash rather than long term growth is the name of the game. And it has lead to the rotten economy we have.
@Gatorplanner36 @AOC Of course it is, because recessions are a characteristic of unregulated capitalism. The rank speculation of markets creates bubbles that do not match productivity and when the bubble bursts you get a recession. You need to invest in your people to increase productivity/growth

@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN It seems rather than being willing to entertain a different perspective you're looking to close your eyes from the truth. Show me a modern democrat who is advocating for white nationalism. Prove me wrong. Facts over feelings right?  https://t.co/XokcjrXj7x
@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN They're not mine, and the ones that you have shared with me are false. yes. If you to share something that isn't false, I'd be glad to agree with you but so far I am not seeing much of anything.
@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN Though I have to say, liberals at least have it right when it comes to social policy. Conservatives believe in big government when it comes to telling people how they should act in their personal lives. How is that promoting freedom???
@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN I dislike liberals just as much as the next guy, I'm a progressive. As a progressive I believe both conservatives and liberals are wrong in their perspectives to the detriment of the American people. I'm not going to defend liberals because I don't agree with them.
@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN You're selectively applying history that no longer is relevant to the modern shape of politics. No democrat is advocating for slavery, white supremacy, or white nationalism. Those people have migrated over to the Republican party and vote Republican.
@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN So criticizing someone for choosing to believe in something is the same as people being born into a situation they have no control over? That is completely false and it has no basis of knowledge. I am criticizing you because your stated views are false and I am pointing them out.
@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN Capitalism has never worked by itself, it always needed regulation to exist otherwise it would collapse in on itself.

@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN No, its not and oligarchs convincing you it is, is their greatest deception. America has a number of advantages the source of which stems from its geography but also its ideals and its character. None of which is tied to capitalism. You are so afraid of tyrannical government
@cutiekimmy704 @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN the American people. Do you get it now? 50-70% taxes are honestly too low. During the Golden Age of economic expansion taxes were around 90% for the same levels. Do you know the history of your country at all???

@JulieRowanZoch @alaw202 @SSWorks @RepJayapal The article linked to has a few items, but I am not aware of @RepJayapal's confirmation nor much else officially on the bill other than it is being written. That is exactly why I am so skeptical. They're asking for support before even officially telling us what is in it.
It's because she actually reflects the will of the people rather than the will of elites and corporations. We see ourselves in @AOC and that is the true definition of a representative. It's what everyone of our representatives should be. It's a contradiction they aren't. https://t.co/p76Mfk8lBw

@Legislate_Watch @alaw202 @RepJayapal @SSWorks Propaganda. The middle class is shrinking due to the policies of conservatives. Conservative economics does not work. Only by investing in your people can you have a healthy economy and society. An economic model should not be one that sees billionaires and starvation wages.
@Legislate_Watch @alaw202 @RepJayapal @SSWorks In contrast to a system (capitalism) that always leads to an elite population of oligarchs, through their private businesses, oppressing the majority of a population. They are perpetuating this model by publishing fake news and putting people against each other. Wake up.
@Legislate_Watch @alaw202 @RepJayapal @SSWorks Propaganda. Elites are using you to disseminate fake news in the interest of preserving their power and money. Democratic-socialism is socialism through democratic means. The definition is in the words. People vote on their economic interests and that becomes the policy of state.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @GOP We have to reach out to @GOP the middle class/poor with a level head, and inform them without attacking them, of the systemic campaign to convince them to act against their own interests. It will take a politician with vision to do this. That is why I'm #Bernie2020
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The @GOP really is just a huge disinformation campaigned setup by corporations so they can continue to divide and conquer the American people. The purpose? So they can continue to rake in most of the money produced by the workers of this country. They are not for the little guy.
@alaw202 @SSWorks @RepJayapal For the inclusion of the people into the national legislative process. The PCP needed to have put out a press release with quotes from members/leaders of the caucus that goes over every single point of change in the bill and why. That is the gold standard for democracy.
@alaw202 @SSWorks @RepJayapal The writing process needs to be public and open for public criticism. That has to be the golden standard of representative democracy. For too long, oligarchs have ran our country behind a wall of secrecy and we got our current country because of it. We must not settle.
@alaw202 @SSWorks @RepJayapal You can SAY that but there are dissenting voices and THEIR facts need to be addressed and rebutted if you want to convince people. That's how things should work. They haven't for so long and as a result our standards have fallen for actual democracy. I am not so quick to trust.
@alaw202 @SSWorks @RepJayapal And holding rallies to get people to lobby for support of it while the writing process is being done behind closed doors AND these nasty rumors floating around... I don't like it. And it shouldn't be done like this. It should be done out in the open so the people can analyze it.
@alaw202 @SSWorks @RepJayapal I don't buy that excuse. These organizations can have just as much of an impact writing the legislation out in the open for the public as they do now. Doing it behind closed doors is done so the people don't know what the specific text of the bill is. That is shady.

@drjoyce_knudsen Can't agree. Though I support the idea of giving people help with dealing with their stress, the solution is wrong. We should be attempting to relieve our stress by taking away what makes us stressed out. Namely, a system that forces this stress on us.
This is what happens when people who don't believe in government are allowed to run it. Conservatives want you to believe the free market is a God, but that is just a way for them to take advantage of people. Often illegally/immorally. https://t.co/wyWJYr8qnF
@CTPatriot2006 @alphasixtyone @aaronjmate So if anyone is going to cast stones at other people, they should be free of the same crime. That is what I am saying, but for some reason some folks are rushing to argue against it, which is so weird.
@CTPatriot2006 @alphasixtyone @aaronjmate I think anyone who values the standards they publish should follow those standards. We have no clue the true extent of the investigation because there is so much not published. Making any conclusion whether in the affirmative or negative is premature. That idea isn't universal.
@alphasixtyone @aaronjmate Then call balls and strikes instead of pretending to be better than your peers but actually being hypocritical about it. Its fake, and it weakens his arguments. Whether he has to report on the investigation, idk. But he isn't doing a good job on it.
@alphasixtyone @aaronjmate That was me yes. I am saying, that him criticizing people for doing the same thing he is doing is hypocritical. 		I think it is normal to make conclusions based off the evidence you have, as long as you recognize the limits of what you know. Like a normal person.
@alphasixtyone @aaronjmate But rather than doing that, he's tweeting about this soap opera shit with him calling out other journalists but missing the entire point.
@alphasixtyone @aaronjmate If he wants to criticize the msm, how about you call out their silencing of Progressive activists, or their lack of reporting on the shrinking middle class, or the wealth inequality, or the for profit health insurance leading to people dying. There are other fights to fight.
@alphasixtyone @aaronjmate The dude is criticizing people for coming to reasonable conclusions based off the evidence. They are being a bit too on the face with it in the amount of time they cover it, but its about the President of the United States. He gets air time everyday.
@HussleBrAnd @aaronjmate ALL I am saying is, pretending you're being a better journalist by just coming to a different conclusion based off of the incomplete evidence is hypocritical. Cognitive dissidence is hard to spot.
@HussleBrAnd @aaronjmate Look dude, people connect the dots in their own head all the time. It is part of the pattern recognition software we have as humans. That is normal. What settles conflicts are laws and precedent. What determines reality depends on what the people involved directly believe.
@aaronjmate There is information listed in those indictments that aren't public dude. You're making conclusions with incomplete evidence, Slow down on telling everyone they are wrong. You don't know that.

That is akin to, if not arguably worse than say, interfering in a country's elections. The US has a enormous double standard when it comes to national sovereignty. That contradiction is part of why we are losing our rights, and the American dream domestically.
Quick reminder that the United States just overthrew the government of Venezuela through a tweet and video clip. No working through the UN, no legally accepted decision by an international body. That is against international law. That is anti law and order.

@mGbYz104ARRySyy @mmfa The world we live in now is a period of historic inequality. The kind of inequality that was worse than ancient Rome or revolutionary France. Americans take too much shit from the rich. All because each of us are fooled into we have equal chances at living the good life. Lies.
@mGbYz104ARRySyy @mmfa It is precisely the well-being of the middle class that will allow more people to interact with and enjoy the life of the rich. You get more opportunities to achieve happiness and production would go through the roof.
@mGbYz104ARRySyy @mmfa That is another conservative talking point meant to get you to vote against your interest. People exist in societies. No one becomes rich without cooperating with a host of different people and the environment they interact in. A stronger middle class leads to a stronger America.
@justicedems Cool, so can you start advocating for more public discourse that gets some sort of media? The people can't see what isn't published. We should be publishing videos that have a call to action. We need to tell people to actively protest. Sit in strikes, acts of civil disobedience.
This will be your legacy. The man who brought a people's revolution to the workplace. A true, Democratic Socialist.
@SenSanders If you want to be President of the United States. You have to separate yourself from the pack right? Your signature legislation can be: A People's Revolution. Come out and say you support the idea of Worker Co Ops. And the government should encourage them.

@Carnage11B @ellen_knudson @nowthisnews @JewdyGold The government is going to be shut down irregardless of any hypothetical political movement. Until they pass a budget it will remain shut down. The minute a new administration takes office (Speaker of the House is third in line to the Presidency) we can pass a budget.
@Hauske @CNN We need fame to break into the social consciousness of America. That fame comes with leaders and their patrons. Say we created an organization with the explicit goal of gaining social attention and then used that fame to mobilize the people for social change.
@Carnage11B @ellen_knudson @nowthisnews @JewdyGold Install a new transitional administration that would keep the government running while we hold special elections.
@Hauske @CNN I called it a People's Rights Movement for a reason. Its because we have to start taking inspiration from the Civil Rights Movement all those years ago. Those people are not fundamentally different from us today. They just had vocal, courageous and passionate leaders.
@Hauske @CNN It's in part because no one is asking us to protest, to strike, to communicate our displeasure. No one I have seen is actively telling people what they could or should be doing. A call to action is a vital part of any movement. People need the imaginations of people.
@Hauske @CNN In this case yes, but it is important to communicate between folks who are just as aware as we are. We have to start creating or joining a network of other people who are part of the choir, and begin to create and implement a plan to inspire the American imagination.
@Hauske @CNN to the system that we live in. Corporations own the media, they control what ideas and "facts" about our reality of a huge percentage of the population. The first step to any potential revolution is cooping the establishment media to the purposes of the people.
@Hauske @CNN You're entirely correct. Which is why there has been an explosion of independent media in the last decade. We are only able to imagine what our experiences have shown us. The state of anxiety people exist in today and the lack of teaching critical thinking has sedated us.
@aaronjmate Everyone agrees Stone is a liar. He is not going to incriminate himself regarding anything he may or may not have done that would get  him time. What the Special Council has, they will charge and they will attempt to leverage the time he will get for more info. Lets wait and see.
@Hauske @CNN Contrast is the name of the game in politics and captivating the imagination of the people via appealing to their better nature in an extended, focused, and public campaign is what is needed. We need another comprehensive People's Rights Movement. Stop limiting our imagination.
@Hauske @CNN We literally just had a "let them eat cake" moment the other day and yet I am hearing nothing from Americans. Where is our sense of social consciousness? Have we become so individualistic in our Pavlovian response to capitalism that we just passively accept it?
@Hauske @CNN I am at a loss as to why there have not been large scale protests across the country. Organized by informed leaders with the aim of reshaping society into something that is more egalitarian and empathetic. Income equality is worse than ancient Rome and revolutionary France.
@Hauske @CNN union, who will? There are plenty of people willing to take part in protests. They just need organization. People to enable them to voice their displeasure, and in part, tell them what is going on in this country is not normal and we shouldn't accept it.

@mGbYz104ARRySyy @mmfa No one is asking you to if you don't already have the means so. That is what you're hearing from everyone supporting ambitious investments. The rich have all the money because of our structure. We have to change it in order to create a more perfect union.
@Jbraxn @nycgogi @UTLAnow If we were/are able to assimilate all of those people into our economy. Do you know how much cool shit we could afford? Why would you care what they look like. If we do it in a smart way, we should absolutely do it. We'd be crazy not to.
@nwcali6 @DailyCaller That means taxing the rich and investing in our people.
@nwcali6 @DailyCaller BUT it is a fact that the law is interpreted by people and as a result of their perspectives we have the world we have right now. That results in a lot more people suffering than is necessary. The Court needs to be course directed to help make us a more perfect union.

@Jbraxn @nycgogi @UTLAnow Dude do you know how the economy works? It is the result of transactions between people. Demand, supply, consumption, production. The more people you have in your country. The larger the potential economy. That means more money to spend on programs.

Every person not creating as much wealth as they can results in a smaller economy. Billionaires kill,
@Jbraxn @nycgogi @UTLAnow At the end of the day, the economy are just transactions. And the money taxed from those transactions give the government cash to spend. If you invest in your people, the value of the economy will raise. Imagine investing in 300 million people and the value they can create.
@Jbraxn @nycgogi @UTLAnow Greece's fall was due to it not having any control over its monetary policy. If the US's currency was not controlled by a US central bank, you'd have a point. Greece's banks had to answer to German banks. That doesn't exist for the US. We print our own money.
@nycgogi @Jbraxn @UTLAnow Empirical data and the analysis in combination with empathetic intelligence needs to be the standard with which we make decisions. We have to be a rationale and a loving country. That is not what we currently are. Its emotions and hearsay.

@HarpsterDeborah @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @senatemajldr Look, I am not going to be defend Nancy Pelosi. I didn't want her for Speaker. That sort of callousness, lack of imagination, and corporate sellout lack of empathy  is exactly why I don't support her. The shutdown should not have lasted this long. Override should have been used.
@fauxdea @marianaatencio @MSNBC @justicedems @HouseDemocrats @SenSanders @senatemajldr He has publicly said he won't bring it to a vote BECAUSE Trump will override it. The natural and in my opinion next logic response to that is stirring up public opinion to support a 2/3rd's majority override so they know this is a popular enough idea to do. You have to counter.
@USATODAY One thing I have to admire about the Republicans is they are ambitious and courageous in their use of their power. They'll do what they want to achieve their ends, within the multi-confines that exist. That is something the left needs to take notes on and start implementing.
Use their rhetoric against them. Change the framing. This is why you are a leader. https://t.co/FA4iO3kjpH
@yeezyeezy234 @SpeakerPelosi That backpay line is also a lie. https://t.co/Tr0Ns8sEOe She both allowed a vote to go through and it passed in the House and Senate. Where the fuck do you get your information?
@yeezyeezy234 @SpeakerPelosi There exists a deal that Dems support that would address border security. That is something everyone agrees will work. The only reason Trump is not signing it, is it does not fund a wall most Americans do not want. Fact. That's it. His approval rating has gone down for a reason.
@dturn63 @SpeakerPelosi HE HAS SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO BRING IT TO A VOTE BECAUSE TRUMP WILL VETO IT. WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT A SOLUTION TO THE VETO. THAT IS 2/3RDS OVERRIDE. BUT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT. THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYING.
@funder Dude, can you bring attention to Congress' 2/3rd override? We need more people talking about this and to have it in the minds of our representative so the Americans suffering under the shutdown can get some fucking relief.
@SpeakerPelosi CONGRESS CAN OVERRIDE A PRESIDENTIAL VETO. GO ON TV AND STIR UP PUBLIC OPINION ON THE 2/3RDS OVERRIDE OF A VETO. GET PEOPLE TO SUPPORT IT, AND THEN PASS IT. ITS NOT THAT HARD.

@marianaatencio @MSNBC @justicedems @HouseDemocrats @SenSanders Will someone for the love of god remind people that you can override the Presidential veto? I mean for Gods sake people, it is written in the Constitution. Why is no one talking about this as a possible solution?
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Why are you not entertaining a Presidential veto override? Have we forgotten the fundamental powers of the legislature? Recruit Republicans to vote for a bill that passed the Senate unanimously. You, @senatemajldr and every other person in there are ignoring your power.
@Jbraxn @nycgogi @UTLAnow Everyone agrees in borders existing. Everyone agrees in legal immigration and tackling illegal immigration. But the solutions to these problems that many have heard are the arguments of those with the money making up excuses not to have these services. That is all is it.
@Jbraxn @nycgogi @UTLAnow What is relative wealth? Are we talking about the second or third house these folks are finding it hard to pay? If that is our threshold, I'm sorry but most Americans don't even own a single home, let alone two or three. How about we fund a culture of home ownership for Americans
@Jbraxn @nycgogi @UTLAnow You know why its hard to find the money? Because the rich are hoarding it for themselves. This is what we're trying to tell you. The money exists. The value exists. But the willpower to fund our education as a country is not there from those who have the money. We have to TAX it.

@nwcali6 @DailyCaller The law is interpreted by people. The perspective with which people interpret the Constitution vary. There isn't one perspective on the Constitution. It has been this way since it was first written. That is a faux news/conservative talking point.
@jaketapper @jeffzeleny @TheLeadCNN A new generation is needed. This country has gone to shit under traditional leaders. Because of them we got Trump. Its time for a generation of leaders who's perspective is one for the working class.
@StevenOrlando87 @DailyCaller I will not allow you to limit my imagination. We The People can demand any rule we desire. We are what gives our nation legitimacy and if we don't believe in the legitimacy of this court or this government. We can decide what fair ways to re-legitimize it. SCOTUS will change.
@DailyCaller It absolutely should be expanded. What happened to Merrick Garland is a stain on this country. And by expanding the court we make sure people who hold the perspective OF THE PEOPLE interpret the laws. As it should be.

@Jbraxn @UTLAnow We should be content to know the people we allow in this great country are good people. We're going to attract good people by being good ourselves. Building a war not only is immoral its impractical and it is a dumb policy meant to serve as a political ploy. A trick.
@Jbraxn @UTLAnow I am for the rule of law too my dude. But I feel like this is an issue that isn't mutually exclusive with it. Immigration reform does need to happen. Progressives agree with that too, we just think it should be done right and smart, rather than being based on fear.
@Jbraxn @UTLAnow Then we have to open up more schools. How is the idea of having more schools to teach people about reality a bad thing? We should have tons more teachers. The profession needs to be more prestigious than it already is because developing the mind of our citizens is paramount.
@Jbraxn @UTLAnow Taking the position that a child shouldn't be educated is just wrong. If you were that kid, through no fault of your own you would want to chance to be happy. Just as much as you wish it as you are. You're limiting your imagination for the perception of comfort. Its not true.
@Jbraxn @UTLAnow We have the will power to, as a society, demand we have the greatest military in the world. Why can we not demand to have the greatest education system in the world. Our priorities reflect our values. And our present values are shit. We can find a way if we choose to. I choose to
@Jbraxn @UTLAnow I think we as a country should have equal education for each and every kid born in our country. No qualifiers. Everyone gets the same education. Of course we should control who gets in our country. And approve the immigration of the optimum amount of people, The issue is funding,
@UTLAnow Ya'll are settling for a lot less than you should. If you're going to do this actually have some ambition.

@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC So the price of college doesn't matter. Student debt doesn't exist and people can go learn how to improve society if they want to without worrying about paying a tax to corporations their whole life. That is what interest payments are you know. FOR PROFIT TAXES.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Medicare for all would eliminate most private healthcare insurance companies. Its taxed and you actually end up with more money in the end. Colleges can be paid for with taxation on the rich (there are billionaires btw that are at a lower tax bracket than their secretaries)
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Because the cost of healtcare is artificially higher because there is a middleman who takes more money than is necessary for the healthcare to exist by itself.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Because your employer pays your heathcare guess how much less money they have invest in the business? Now what if every person in the country could pay $0 when they go to the doctor and everyone has health insurance AND you have more money in your pocket.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Wouldn't it be so much easier to have the same reference points as a country? To know the different cultural things or ideas we share with each other. To be comfortable knowing your neighbor has the same values you do and you are safe and secure? Why would you not want that???
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC NO DUDE. If you have political power centered on each state. EVERYONE WILL PRIORITIZE THEIR STATE RATHER THAN THE COUNTRY. You are calling for America to be balkanized and turned European. Yes they do know because education is based on facts. The truth and facts ARE UNIVERSAL.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Its not universal so of course the premiums should be sky high. There is less funding for it. If we go for Medicare for All instead, the pool would be the size of the entire country. And premiums would be LESS THAN REGULAR INSURANCE NOW.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Obamacare and Romneycare are literally the same in the perspective they have as legislation. Rather than single payer where your healthcare is paid for via taxes (still lower than your premiums you pay now) people on Obama/Romneycare have to subsidize the system with few people.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Do you think Europeans have killed themselves in record numbers because that is just inheritor to their nature? No, the situations they were born into created the conditions for them to kill themselves over time. Namely, VALUING REGIONAL IDENTITIES OVER THE COMMON GOOD FOR ALL
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Europe is a piece of land with different people who have different ideas on how they should live their lives. It is a piece of land that exists that cares for more for its region than the entire continent. This has resulting in horrific wars in the past that killed tons of people
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Funding is not the only problem. Its the laws that are in place. Why is the department of education only 200 billion and the department of defense gets closer to 800 billion in funding. 800 billion in something is what it takes to be the best in the world. But not in education.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC That became Obamacare because Democrats are fucking pussies who do not know how to fight for the ideas they believe in. They sold us  out and ran with a fucking Republican idea rather than single payer.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Obamacare is an idea created by the Heritage Foundation, which is a Republican/Conservative think-tank that creates legislation. Americans as a people believe healthcare is a right. That is a fact. To counter this Republicans made sure to only partially commit to single payer.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC inherit and swearing allegiance to America should have the absolute right and ability to achieve happiness. Circumstance should not matter at all. This is the land of opportunity. We have to empower our people to succeed. And we are not doing that with corporate control.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Do you want our identities to be divided by state like they are in Europe??? Where there has been wars between neighbors many times closer than some American states are to each other? These are absolutely federal decisions. Americans should have universal standards. Every life
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC That is a faux conservative talking point. States already have a lot of control over how each one governs itself and by and large the country is STILL SHITTY. Everything you're arguing for has been tried. That is why it is a conservative opinion. It does not work.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Because our energy sources are controlled by corporations who don't want research into renewable energies. There is not enough investment in our infrastructure because we spend all of our money on the military. We have the best military but that is it. We need more funding.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC You're reasoning for attributing fault is flawed. Healthcare sucks because it is a Republican idea that the Democrats implemented because they are pussies, Education sucks because we don't fund it enough and restrict information to people-&gt; Conservative idea. Transportation sucks

@duncanliles @AOC @realDonaldTrump I feel ya dude, and if that was the case mb. But the problems facing our country are dead serious. People are dying as a result of the policies our government takes. If that was me or you or someone we love. I imagine our attitudes towards the comparisons would be different.
@FiveThirtyEight tl:dr I see what you are doing @FiveThirtyEight thanks for contributing to the shit society we have.
@FiveThirtyEight I want our generation of Americans. The Millennials to unapologetically embrace this questioning of our reality and the assumptions society has inherited. Only then can we free our imagination and create a world straight from our dreams. But is as real as a cold shower.
@FiveThirtyEight Yet, their perceptions tell them a lot is wrong with it. Things aren't as rosy as the societal consciousness would like them to believe. Not by a long shot for the vast majority of the population. It takes critical thinking skills and a courage to question the status quo.
@FiveThirtyEight I love how relatively conservative media outlets love to position things as against rather than for ideas. Its a neat psychological trick. Anti-capitalist is aiming at activating the fear based parts of your brain. American grow up being taught the infallibility of capitalism.
@duncanliles @AOC @realDonaldTrump Progressives agree about the existence of fake news, but we are on completely different planets on a lot of other issues. It is a fact he is a terrible President and a threat to our Republic. Progressive ideas focus on enabling each and every American to have a shot at happiness.

@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC The idea itself that education was better for society without public funding is completely ignorant and shows a lack of knowledge of how people were exploited before the education system was established. You'd have us become a nation even more ignorant than we already are. Stop.
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Taxes are the price of civilization. If you want society to fall apart, eliminate government. People seem to think that America and its people are special but that's not the case, we're human and we're guaranteed to look like Somalia if we embrace your conservative perspective.
@IMetZach @AOC Conservatives really have you by the balls don't they my dude. I have a point where I become a conservative too but that MAY be the case if we are talking about some sort of utopian model. You need to do more research on economics my dude. Your perspective is incomplete.
I find it interesting how, ideas in its purest form are only limited by our state of mind. Our internal limiters. Maybe we each have a line that we believe a certain reality is simply not possible, but do we know where exactly that line is?  https://t.co/VFj5A2skks via @YouTube
@Dustin_Tha_Wind @realDennisLynch @AOC Its a slogan meant to symbolize an idea. Its not literal. Research the idea free college to learn more about it. Its too complex to convey on twitter. But essentially, invest in the American people and we'll be more likely to have a better society.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump For the nth time, Trump does not want to fun the government unless he has a wall. Most Americans do not want a wall and so the Dems are following the ..will... of...the...people. I try to imagine how anyone could ever be supporting this Republican party. I can't even...
FACTS. SIGN ME UP SENPAI https://t.co/4ugoz0OlhE
@ConservativePTZ This is pretty funny, especially that @AnnCoulter retweeted it. Pro tip, if people are criticizing you for some reason, they may have a point. How about you listen to them rather than shutting off your brain.
@Caedere4 @BenjySarlin Not what I said, but nice attempt at straw manning my argument. It is fact that skinheads, racists, and literal Nazis marching in the streets support the Republican party. They are doing it for a reason and its because their ideas have a home in the party. Fact.
@BenjySarlin Wait, R's expect D's to have trouble with Antisemitism??? You're joking right? The Republican party is the party of literal Nazis marching in the streets and saying the Jews won't replace us. Are people's memories that short?!?!?!?!?
Stranger than fiction. https://t.co/A2kWe9990W
@IlhanMN The decision to make war should not be an easy one for our government to make. Congress needs to assert its jurisdiction over war and reign in our country's uncontrollable war industry. These are people profiting off of other people dying. It has to stop.
You're now imagining what life would be like if @SenSanders was already President. I'd love to have lived in that timeline, it sounds amazing. https://t.co/o6O3Y3aeuw

@DavidMDrucker @GrahamBlog @IlhanMN Looks like its all hands on deck at @CNN to try to character assassinate one of the only genuine people in our federal government. You and everyone who works at cnn are fucking jokes. Where is my progressive channel already, it can't come soon enough.
@secupp When people say virtue signaling, this shit is what they mean. You're twisting a genuine issue for cheap, disgusting, and shallow political points on twitter. You should be ashamed to call yourself a journalist.
@devinher @navgirl63 @sam_vinograd @secupp @IlhanMN I haven't seen anything to that effect yet.

@BernieSanders One thing that distinguishes people is humility. Even if you weren't entirely responsible for the actions of others, you're taking it upon yourself to do the right thing. How many other people can swallow their pride like this. Bernie is the President we need. #Bernie2020
@Krabboss I stand corrected.
@Krabboss @OsitaNwanevu Never said he is, and yes in some circles this is exactly what they say. There is more than one narrative used to attempt to stain lefties. There is no trophy for continuing this argument dude. You have better things to do with your time.
@RepCummings @RoKhanna @CoryBooker @PeterWelch @JoeNeguse Thank you for standing with @SenSanders in taking a right direction to address the health care crisis currently plaguing our country. There is still a lot of work to be done #MedicareForAll

@Guy_Sch @OsitaNwanevu You'd be surprised what you see in conservative twitter.

@trubl9 @GOP @KellyannePolls @TYTNetwork @KyleKulinski That it is.

@trubl9 @GOP @KellyannePolls @TYTNetwork @KyleKulinski some of the most accurate reports of facts come from online sources (cable is pretty bad) like TyT and Secular Talk. If we through word of mouth can support these guys, we can subvert the power of the msm. And force them to report actual facts instead of spin.
@trubl9 @GOP @KellyannePolls @TYTNetwork @KyleKulinski What we have to do is support media that actually reports based on objective facts. Facts exist, they're there and there are conclusions you can make from facts, but the msm takes facts and spins them in a corporate left direction (msnbc) or corporate right (fox news) or fake cnn

Run for President @SenSanders no one perfectly has your perspective. Everyone is social democratic but we need a democratic socialist to truly address the plight of the working class families in America. We have lost our socialist identity as a nation that we had under FDR. https://t.co/gBp4LEs84d
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork This seems like a sarcastic remark. It is your position of non globalism don't take their position for a pointless rhetorical exercise. Our interest in the ME is to balance between the powers of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Israel, and Egypt. those are the regional powers.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork @SenSanders @DNC @BernieSanders The language of the American worker and middle class is the literal cornerstone or @justicedems's policies. Seriously look more into their media sources in conjunction to your own and then make up your own mind.

@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork @SenSanders I'm sorry but isn't everyone ok with all of the crappy things Trump has said? That is how people talk.

They see the good and bad of both sides of the isle and want to take over the democratic party. I am supporting this takeover of the party so we can represent people.

@Darrell33857181 @dawn_dknapp2 @CindyCarreau @ABC I'm sure they don't but they are still making crap tons of money. Because of Trump's policies.

@Stratfor The people of France are protesting to communicate their displeasure to their government. This era of corporate rule had driven them into a corner and when that happens, the French revolt. Neoliberalism had to die. Progressivism had to lead.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork The things you like about Trump, the perspective of working to help American families, to de-tangle ourselves from globalist wars, those are all things @SenSanders supports. Just in a way that people can actually respect and without all of the mucky, mafia like drama.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork I know that stoning women and chopping up people makes them terrible. I don't have to question that one.

@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork You're conflating my argument. I am not saying those are his faults. BUT he is at fault for HIS actions and the actions he has done has me worried he is not putting AMERICA's interest at heart when he makes these decisions but himself. That is what I am saying backed by evidence.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork I think I did answer you in another one of these threads, of course I support us getting our of the Middle East. I wanted us out back when Obama was elected. We shouldn't be there and our presence only makes things worse.

@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork Ok, so they are terrible people overall. We have that established. So why are we such close allies? Because the corporations want us to be. Oil. And Trump is not acting against them at all. He is appeasing them. Giving them money and weapons. Which is partly why I dislike him.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork But even so, yes I believe we should prioritize resources at home and interact with the world through diplomacy.

Greece didn't.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski Yes, you are starting to understand me now, lol. Yes I am for all those things and so are the people/links I have given you. This is our perspective.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork I never said we should. Only that we should talk to other countries and be willing to act in our national interest. I think you're not really getting what I am communicating, lol.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork I think the US should act in its national interest as it has always done and has led us to become the greatest country in the history of the world. I want actions to be smart, calculated and clearly defined. I don't want endless wars but we can't disband the military either.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork He was a member, but not at the time of his murder. https://t.co/aUYs8AXh9b		The characterization of him from the right has been off base. Read this. Trump is trying to pull out of Syria, not Saudi. And Turkey is going to fill that vacuum. Trump was paid off by an arms deal.
@FiveThirtyEight Until now. @justicedems are actually fighting for us in the government. We have to support them anyway we can so we can change this country for the better.
@FiveThirtyEight You know why? Because the Republican base has been activated. Those guys are freaking hyper and they know it. Republicans have a much more active and passionate base. Because Republicans actually are loyal to their base. Democrats are not and that is why there is no activation.
I wonder why. Lets float a 90% marginal tax and a 40$ capital gains tax. https://t.co/JqS0C8pwdu
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski No, I don't support globalism as you understand it. I don't at all. But I do believe America can and will suffer if we do not interact with other countries at all. That is what I am saying. Fair trade deals, having allies, defending ourselves. Those are all things we need.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems @KyleKulinski @TYTNetwork But he really isn't, he says he is but for the most part he isn't AND when he does its because it benefits him personally.

Listen to these people and tell them how your ideas will solve their problems, use their language but in a progressive way. Above all, treat them not as enemies but as potential supporters and ask for their vote.
@SenSanders You are entirely correct. In order to truly become the leader of this entire nation you need to speak to everyone. Traditionally politicians believe you have to be a centrist but that is wrong. You speak to people's point of view using progressive ideas.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems Watch @tytnework and @KyleKulinski consider the progressive perspective and let me know if it makes sense to you. You're one of us brother, you just don't know it yet. And so are so many others. We need everyone we can get if we are going to change this nation. Join us.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems The media may not want him to succeed. but oil companies, finance companies, arms dealers, the traditional, rich donors of the conservative elite DO support him. Because he is making them money! He doesn't want to criticize a terrorist state like Saudi Arabia why? Because oil!!
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems Some of the rich and elite are against him but a lot aren't. The dude has the support of literally all of the Republican party outside of like 3 people. Why do you think that? Did their identity as the party of the elite suddenly change? No, he is making them money intentionally.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems Did you even look at the @justicedems page I have been sending to you. There are real working class representatives in Congress now. We need to support them rather than a fake.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems No, dude. I was talking to the populist aspects of his rhetoric. That sounds nice, but he isn't actually doing any of that. He is just trying to make himself richer and prevent any harm to himself from the criminal investigations. In between that he is putting on a show. Like tv.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems That is the thing dude, he's not doing any of those things. Its a lie. He is manipulating people. @SenSanders is speaking truth to power. Trump is just pretending to be.

@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems Its not true, it simply isn't. The underlying causes of our problems still exist. The rich can still bribe politicians so anything we actually want won't happen. Its not going to change until the rich can no longer bribe politicians. Trump is one of said bribed politicians that
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems I dislike Trump not because he wants to make America great. Its because the way he is going about it is completely wrong.

@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems The things we both agree are a problem and need to be addressed? They're because they make rich people money. They created and want this system because it earns them shit tons of money. The priority is getting money out of politics so rich people cannot bride politicians.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems Tackling these problems are not mutually exclusive, what people are saying is the way the administration is tackling a lot of these problems are not the way that would actually help anything. Look, our problem is not outside its inside. The rich own our political system. All of

@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems We both agree the money we spend outside the nation needs to stop. I feel like we're just repeating that to each other.
@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems If you believe in those things and want them for our country, you know who are the only people who want to get it done.

@Thesanelib @ABC @justicedems We shouldn't be in endless wars nor fund a military as much as we have that has not won them in over a decade of action.

@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC @justicedems @RoKhanna @SenSanders Americans work longer and harder than most of the world on average and yet some stuff can't afford it because its for profit.

@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC @justicedems @RoKhanna @SenSanders You're right which is why most Americans would rather have Medicare for All and that being the policy people support who really want folks to get health care. You know where Obama got the idea for his healthcare plan? Mit Romney https://t.co/ke2tB3ld7J

@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC @justicedems @RoKhanna @SenSanders Obamacare objectively insured more people as a result of its passing. What are you talking about?? Woooould you rather all of the people who got insurance for the first time under it, not have access to it? I don't understand.
@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC How am I defending corporation? Or people who I believe are corrupt. Fuck ever single one of them. I am saying Trump is one of them and he needs to go. Every single corrupt politician needs to go. Including and especially corrupt Democrats.
@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC @justicedems @RoKhanna @SenSanders Look, I am familiar with your conservative arguments, but they are false. Objectively false. We agree somethings need fixing, that our country is not perfect, but for some reason ya'll want to continue down the path of conservatism rather than attempt progressivism. Why??
@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC @justicedems @RoKhanna @SenSanders Obamacare did more for Americans than any other health plan ever put forward. We currently have a private medical system, and millions were uninsured. I'd prefer Medicare for All, however not doing anything would have been objectively worse. Dumbass.
@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC You're misinformed. It was not perfect but it was a positive in the lives of millions of Americans. It got Americans out of breadlines due to the shit show the banks made and put them to work https://t.co/TyIpD0LIzX

@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Look at their opponents, they were objectively worse. Mit Romney was just Obama but white and a bit worse. We haven't had a real progressive president since FDR.
@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC The productivity of an empowered American middle class due to FDR's Progressive policies.
@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC He had nothing to do with the prosperity Americans felt while he was President so they voted him in 4 times. He had nothing to do with the happiness and opportunities people got so they voted in his Vice President again. That makes no sense. https://t.co/G1Cb4uedDP
@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC People voted him into office so many times they had to make up that rule. People loved him, that is why they voted for him. Why would people vote for horrible Presidents 4 times??? Hell, they voted for him in the middle of a huge war crap tons of American died in. Are you serious
@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Harry Truman was a Democrat. He was FDR's Vice President. FDR was President from the Great Depression and through most of WW2. Why did we get out of the Great Depression a combination of FDR's policies and the increased gov spending and employment of ww2 +GI bill.
@Thesanelib @ABC People worker on the border literally say they don't need a wall. https://t.co/o093Wcw3IC		Border security is something most people agree with, ,though its not the biggest priority when compared to something like income inequality. Its the wall that is a waste of money.
@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC The post ww2 economy was the best we've ever had. https://t.co/Bxlm5doWdm And we got it under the most Progressive President we've ever had. Since then we've become more and more economically conservative and it shows.
@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC @justicedems @RoKhanna @SenSanders No one said he doesn't occasionally have points, he does. I praised the dude for starting a conversation about pulling out of the Middle East, but then we also have to be honest with ourselves about his other policies. We need a real middle class President.
@Darrell33857181 @scotthalpain @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC should be able to have a happy life.

@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Compared to the economic policy of FDR, yes the fuck they did. Compared to the economic policies that resulted in the greatest period of prosperity in the history of this country. Yes the fuck they did. On a political spectrum Clinton/Obama were traditional Republicans.
@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC Because he is a liar. The dude cut taxes for the rich rather than helping normal people out. He is not passing middle class laws he is acting conservatively. He is a fake populist. A fake President of the people. @AOC @justicedems @RoKhanna @SenSanders actually are for the people
@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Dude, we've lived in a Conservative economy for the past what 30 years? Wages haven't increased, in fact they've decreased. The policies Progressives are presenting would both enrich and empower the middle class. You're acting against your own interest. https://t.co/3WOmYIFsfX
@rainybeaches99 @Godzilla4USA @lissie_w @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal What you need is actual representation in the government so we can actually have the ideas we want implemented to be translated into tangible policy. We get that by getting the money out of politics.
@VictoriaLeighM2 @Darrell33857181 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC What is the causes of said torn government and split country. Who could possibly benefit from normal people being at each other's throats over the cause of the problems they face. The people who live well under such conditions, the 1%. Wake up dude.
@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC No response to that? I see, well I'd shut off my brain and resort to memes if I had no logical reason for my beliefs too. Tackling your assumptions can be hard at first, but trust me its healthy &lt;3
@VictoriaLeighM2 @Darrell33857181 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC Ok, so you need to find out who actually is responsible for America failing to achieve as much prosperity as we can.

@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC So you're ok with giving power to people who you have no accountability over vs people who you can control having power or not? So you want to live in Somalia. Ok. I don't want that, so I guess we're fundamentally apart. I'm ok with that.
@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Look up @AOC @RoKhanna @SenSanders @TulsiGabbard @KyleKulinski @pewresearch @jimmy_dore @justicedems 		You're being fed lies and a false reality. Do some research and objectively consider the merits of what you're hearing from the people you normally listen to and these people.
@VictoriaLeighM2 @Darrell33857181 @ABC So you want to protect the sanctity of life, but only while they are in the womb? So fuck that kid that wants to go to college and get a good job but he is poor and can't afford it, fuck those people who want clean air to breath and water to drink. Their lives don't matter.
@scotthalpain @Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC So you're going to take your own money and hire a fucking company to fix your roads? Or to keep the planet safe for us to live on, or to protect your commerce, or to enforce the law. Use your brain. Without any of that we look like Somalia. And I haven't even started.

@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Do you know how the progressive tax rate in this country even works? They in part paid for sure before with tariffs, I know that but they decided to go with income tax because its more efficient. And the people who originally argued for it were poor farmers
@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Every single poll showed it was incredibly close. The media showed you percentages likeliness based off what they wanted you to believe. If you actually go back and read the polls it was borderline. Yes, I am willing to acknowledge the bias of the media but the polls were right
@VictoriaLeighM2 @Darrell33857181 @ABC Ok, then go live in a mudhut away from everyone else and we'll continue civilization with the ideas that make sense and help support a world we believe in. Problems arise from conflicts in perspectives. If you want to get rid of that then we'll all have to fuse or die. Thats it.
@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Did we have the same standard of living in 1913 as we do now? Do you think all of the shit that we can afford as a society could have happened without an income tax? Taxes are the cost of civilization. I don't want to live in a fucking mud hut.
@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Dude, no one would listen to them if they issued shitty polls. its Gallup. Grow a brain and think. https://t.co/rw8yUMt2xw	https://t.co/kOkUA2nvml
@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC The cost of civilization is taxes. People will not fund the things we need to support our way of life without there being taxes. If there were no taxes we would look like fucking Somalia. What I think is awesome is the most most amount of happiness for every single person alive.
@Darrell33857181 @VictoriaLeighM2 @ABC Lol...I mean the actual thought thermometer on the wall shows most Americans don't want it. https://t.co/zPC2aK5zfW		I fucking hate schumer and cnn. Wise up and stop watching fox news and Trump. Your perception of reality is flawed, wake the fuck up.

@lissie_w @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal The pragmatism you are familiar with is the definition of caution. It is not pragmatic to start a negotiation already in the middle. You're going to end up on your opponents side of the line and that is what America has done since FDR died in office.
@CindyCarreau @ABC He has literally committed serious crimes and should not be in office.
@TWKeene77 @ABC There are sources for the information you can click to go to official pages dude. Look down bottom. Companies aren't left wing dude. They are left socially yes, but they are right wing economically AND ECONOMICS DETERMINES POWER. Just check out Tyt or secular talk and lmk.
@lissie_w @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal Because that is what it takes to win. Conservatives have been chomping at the bit of abortion for over 40 years. But they never gave up, they never were afraid of feeling disappointed because they didn't get their way, they fought. We need to be even a portion as passionate.
@lissie_w @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal Are you listening to yourself? Why does it matter if people are disappointed if we don't get everything we want immediately. That is not a reason to not try. Its preemptively giving up because you're afraid to fight. You have to be unapologetically passionate about these..

@lissie_w @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal When they fight back with negative spin, you have to have the courage of your convictions to call that spin out and fuck em with it. Unapologetic. That is fighting for real and that is the perspective every single one of us needs to have if we are serious.
@lissie_w @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal For too long, decades, since before either of us were born. Progressives have either been publicly persecuted as they are now or they have been safe with their policies. Look to see where we are now. Get it out of your head that you have to be reasonable. Thats not how it works.
@lissie_w @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal You don't get wins by not pushing the envelop. That isn't how negotiation work. You need to be MORE bold, MORE fringe, MORE radical so when people talk you down you reach a point you actually are comfortable with. That is how it works and that is what we need to do.
This is what conservative "economics" will get you. It is part of why paygo was/is such a bad rule. Conservative arguments have no merit. They are wrong on the policy. Flat out wrong. People need to start confronting the legitimacy of their argument more because it doesn't exist. https://t.co/GKxZI892FL
@lissie_w @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal So you want to preemptively give up just because you THINK they will save themselves with a weak ass argument?

@lissie_w @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal Nope it will have to get the necessary votes in the senate and get Trump's signature. But if we pass an option to give each and every American Healthcare as a right, if we pass laws that empower democracy and Trump/Republicans reject it would be political suicide.
@Newsweek Good, because that is what needs to happen. If Ann Coulter predicted she will never be a public figure again it would be even better.
@GOPChairwoman I think its immoral for anyone to give more money to the military without funding medicare for all or a green new deal or social security for all. We can turn this shit around too and we need to more often.
@AbbyDobby @thehill Because they want to convince you to not like her. They are criticizing her because politics. Its propaganda.
@AOC I think I love you @AOC
@rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal No its not fine, its makes it significantly harder for actual work to get done. It was purposely put in there to make it harder for actual change, and that is because the party leadership doesn't want actual work being done. Its a slippery slope dude, frog in the hot water.

@lilradishn I call non Progressive Democrats, Republicans. That's what they really are and so our language should reflect it. Seriously, start calling @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi the Republicans they actually are.

@ericawerner Thank you for the update. A quick comment on the language use. You have to be a bit clearer when it comes to the pronoun use. Consider that for improving your writing in the future. Sandra Barron angel in your comments painted a clearer picture. Thanks again.
@HoulihanShana @MSNBC @DNC Ad Hominems are a good indicator or a flawed argument or insecurity. https://t.co/uX3QaIFrsw	This culture of criticizing passion and public discourse is one of the problems of this country. Be part of the solution instead. Don't Ad Hominem.
@HoulihanShana @MSNBC @DNC Based off of your public statement it is fairly obviously. No one would conflate a real progressive with a corporate sellout democrat nor hold the superficial opinions on politics displayed in said comment.
@HoulihanShana @MSNBC @DNC Yeah, you do have to justify your opinion first and foremost to yourself if you actually believe it. If you actually believe you don't have to have some sort of evidence with which to form your opinion, then reality doesn't matter to you.
@BabsEaton @PamKeithFL @joncoopertweets @AndrewGillum @VP Being on Clinton's short list is a negative for him, not a positive. Clinton is a sellout corporate democrat. You don't want to be associated with a name that lost to Donald Trump.
@joncoopertweets #Bernie2020 Simply because he is the best. He has fought for the American people his whole adult life, he is outspoken about our broken economic system and the oppression the American people have suffered under corporations. He simply has the best policies....so far.
@HoulihanShana @MSNBC @DNC Ok, so you consume corporate media predominantly. Check out tyt and secular talk for an actual progressive opinion. 		Also if you were truly a supporter of Bernie. There is no way you would believe he can't win, let alone put his name in the same line as Cory fucking Booker.
@ladyraenna @MSNBC Trump won, because he spoke to the issues regular people are having, he gave them an explanation and they ate it up. You beat him by posing better ideas and being a better candidate. Not with wall paper. 		How many people in the Republican nomination had wall paper. They all lost
@ladyraenna @MSNBC No, that is not how it works. It is if you and everyone decides how it will be but that is not written in stone. 		What we THINK needs to be the criteria for a candidate is exactly what we will vote for. CHOOSE and defend the idea to have a criteria based on substance and we will
@MSNBC If @SenWarren has the best ideas she should absolutely be the Democratic nominee. DNA test be damned, fucking Trump is a criminal asshole and he still fucking won. The people falling for her detractors need to have their brains wake the fuck up and start thinking critically.
@MSNBC To y'all bashing Warren. Are you serious??? Ideas these people are for should be the first and last resort when it comes to candidates. How long have you animals been obsessing over fucking aesthetics and look what it got us. Substance matters, substance is what counts. Policy.
@HoulihanShana @MSNBC @DNC Don't conflate some of those names with others. Warren is not perfect but she is a hell of a lot better than most and she can win if she campaigns on Progressive ideas. And Bernie is the best potential candidate anyone has heard of. Where do you get your news? Cnn???
@ladyraenna @MSNBC Are you insane. Ideas should win out not fucking identity. It's this thought of placing the wall paper over substance that helped to put us in this mess in the first place.		America needs to be a place where IDEAS and LAW rule, not people.
@Bonny17322841 @MSNBC She (Harris) is if you want a sellout corporate Dem in the White House again. You know the guy who helped give us Trump? I think his name was Obama. He was a corporate Dem. 		Look into her history and find out she has been corrupted by power and greed.
@ijvalko @MSNBC You are aware the msm is not an accurate representation of American opinions on these issues right?? They are corporations selling a product.  		Warren will do better than most but her problem isn't people won't vote for her if every other candidate is more conservative.
@nyscotsman12 @MSNBC No, Harris is corporate owned.
That's because most Americans haven't been told what actually happens during a gov shutdown. Maybe someone should take this opportunity to explain it in detail how thousands of average government workers won't be getting paychecks while this goes on. Would you want that for you?? https://t.co/l3GoImyUGL
Facts have always been on the progressive side. It's just that corporations have succeeded in their public opinion brainwashing scheme for so long. But we can circumvent them now. We can talk to each other we can connect from across the country in real time. People's Revolution. https://t.co/mnLCRBe185

@KamalaHarris It's the human cost of capitalism which has led to monopolies strangling the middle class out of the American Dream.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders In case you misinterpreted by first message, the immigration and dreamers bit was something I was for and supported, if you thought it was all criticism, then it really only highlights my point you're too geared toward cynicism and are looking for reasons to turn off your brain.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders another perspective for a second is a flaw in your critical thinking skills and its something you should really address if you want to take part in constructive conversation. Merry Christmas.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders No, you are wrong. If anything I see more nuance in life than most people. You're trying to tell me what my argument is but that is not true. And you have failed to effectively counter any of my stated facts. Don't project your lack of insight onto me. That you can't consider..
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders The information is out there, indoctrination is hard to shed but when you do and view our system for what it is you think how could you ever have missed it.

@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders The GND would be closer to the ND where a series of reforms, regulations, investment, and programs would be signed into law in an effort to save the species. I don't see how anyone could see that as outrageous.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders You're conflating the ND and the ARRA. ND was a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms and regulations. The ARRA was basically just a cash infusion and investment. The scales of the ND was significantly larger in scope and more comprehensive in its reforms
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders one independent of the other. If republicans got this amount of skepticism from the people, we wouldn't be falling off the conservative edge of the political spectrum as a country.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders am attempting to motivate people to take part in the political process. Asking people to talk to their friends and family about the problems that exist with our system is cultist in your eyes. I've provided you with more references for my opinions than you have for yours, each
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Ok, so your criticism is you believe I rely solely on these "specific individuals" for information. This is also incorrect and is a conclusion made without facts to support it. How do you have any idea how I rely on for my information? You don't. You have a problem with the way I
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders What? The GND legislation hasn't even been drafted yet. What are you talking about. How is it outrageous?
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Do you not see your own mental gymnastics? Everyone depends on everyone else for information they have not cultivated themselves. Are you saying you haven't relied on ANYONE for ANY piece of information??? Do you go you and mine your own facts? How do you get your information?
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders talking about, verified through multiple, independent sources and from my own observations. We have the problems we have due to our system not the other way around. If you'd consider my rationale for a bit rather than dismissing it as propaganda, you may see my perspective.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders I have thought about it and I've communicated my ideas for why I believe some people come to different conclusions. I don't know every experience every single other person knows and the same for other people to me. But I do know the history and the facts behind the things I am
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders You're assuming I haven't thought about it at all. The assumption that people have thought about this is flawed. A lot of people have not. They are busy going about their lives trying to get by. Not everyone is as informed there are a lot of people and education is pay to play.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders That is cool and you are free to judge what you deem as honest or dishonest but you're wrong about the facts. You've just told me I am wrong without actually bothering...to...present...facts. You're criticisms are hollow is you can't back them up. And that's what I've seen.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Yet, up to this point up to 40 Representatives have signed a resolution supporting such a committee. Sounds serious enough to me. Yes I do, but that isn't relevant to have an opinion on the issues clearly, since you were unawares of the proposal of the GND special committee.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders https://t.co/9v8vZHUz8A	3. I know of the tax increases, but guess what it is still less than you would pay in premiums and co pays. It saves money plain and simple. 		Use some of your cynicism for a second to actually think about our system and whether our values reflects reality
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders 1. Yes, it is peer-reviewed. It means multiple things but the important part is it has been reviewed by experts in the field. Have you even looked up those names and viewed their qualification?	2. A Koch brothers review came to the conclusion that it would save  2 trillion
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Lol, ok my dude suit yourself. There are some who would rather live in peaceful ignorance. I get it. But I'd rather you not slander people who are actually trying to save the species by attempting to cling onto a fantasy that has been sold to you from the moment you're born.
@EaleyGregory @tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders M4A does not outlaw private insurance and you're assuming a for profit insurance company would be better quality healthcare than a single payer system. Fun fact, its not https://t.co/lel0wP8mfB 		This Harvard study shows its not, and its factually worse.
@tintintar @EaleyGregory @davidsirota @SenSanders There is a link in the article I sent you. Click on it and you can download the pdf.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Its not my policy, its the Green New Deal. The special committee on the Green New Deal would first have to be created. The House has yet to vote on its creation, that is being determined now. If not a new committee then Energy and Commerce would most likely take it up.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Honestly, I read articles from sources I more or less trust and the abstract of the study. There are people who do this for a living and a few of them even are truthful so I trust them. However, if the study was flawed, there would have been critiques of it by now. There are none
@EaleyGregory @tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Strawman argument. The law has been peer reviewed no one is counting on the guy's word. We're counting on the people who checked the economic impact of his law, and it saves people money while giving everyone insurance.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders I just posted a link from a study peer reviewed that says Medicare for all would save US tax payers 5 trillion dollars. Why are you bringing up the costs. It is cheaper. Its been verified. Are you able to understand numbers???
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Federal laws begin in either the house or senate in their respective committee's. Past that it gets a floor vote if the Speaker brings it up. Then it gets passed to the other chamber where it can be debated and voted on. Then the President votes or signs it into law.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders https://t.co/xc8fpFDogt		Medicare for all would be passed in Congress and would enable everyone to have healthcare through Medicare. At the point of medical service nothing would be paid, it would be through taxes which would save the US $5 billion https://t.co/Pr3CmYg5SS
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders Green New Deal is a package of legislation aimed at revamping America's power generation and consumption along with rebuilding old infrastructure. There is currently a conversation going on regarding establishing a special committee for drafting said legislation.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders "What can actually be accomplished" So you fell for the "realist democrat" meme? They are actually just selling you half measures so they can keep oppressing American people. How many people thought Obama was going to be the next FDR, he ended up being closer to Bill Clinton.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders I posted those clips so people can easily consume them. I get my information from reading articles and books. Also, anyone who is sells information has their income dependent on it. Are you willing to believe that people who make speeches could be biased but not anyone else?
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders You're still failing to actually challenge my facts, you're just telling me I am wrong. Can you not see the flaws in your own reasoning?

She was fake and power hungry and she rigged her primary. We cannot elect a single other corrupt politician.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders I think you need to be a bit more informed brother. Why do you think life expectancy is down? Because we have a for profit health care system. Why don't we have universal healthcare? Because insurance companies bribe our government. Educate yourself before condemning truth. .

@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders The dude is pointing out one of the many hypocritical aspects of corporate dems. Say one thing and plan another. The dude is also pointing out a hushed up strategy session aimed to undermine progressive candidates who are the only ones working for the people.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders And we have grown accustomed to it over time. Media culture, cheap food, and poor education has sedated us from the politics which effects our lives. The will to change our circumstance is painted as fringe and crazy. The indoctrination starts from the beginning.
@tintintar @davidsirota @SenSanders I understand my dude, but the situation calls for this kind of rhetoric. Americans have been fed propaganda their entire lives about this history and their society. We are a nation ruled by corporations. People live and die in unnecessary anxiety because of corporations.
@davidsirota @SenSanders time outside of the essentials, its not as important as this. The way our kids will live, the way our friends and family will live depends on the trends set by Progressives gaining strength. Republicans and Democrats will try to bury them. Progressives have to fight. For America.
@davidsirota We need to spread the word of @SenSanders far and wide. These people are going to try to drown out the people who actually represent us. We have to get our friends and family involved in politics with us. We have to do this thing grassroots. Direct action. Whatever takes up your.

@proviewsusa @justicedems It is a flaw for sure, and I'd rather us have a political system that is more democratic, however we are not going to get that kind of system by not participating. We have to join it or in some other way express our values and directly act on them if we want things to change.
@proviewsusa @justicedems The DNC is non democratic, yes so you're not getting a say in the direct running of the committee unless your are politically active. You have to take part in the system and rub elbows with other politicians if you want a direct say in the committee's specific agenda.

@The2boysmom @CNN Watch Tyt/Secular talk instead, share the new media with your friends and family and break out of the brainwashing.
@The2boysmom @CNN Biden will take on Trump via the same corny corporate rhetoric we've heard from politicians for the last 30 years. #Bernie2020 will hit the dude where it hurts, actually appealing to working class people.  https://t.co/3WbO8jwTxX. Corporate media wants to brainwash you on Biden.
@deezaintmypants @filosofella @thehill These are facts, not opinions my dude. Critical thinking is important but we should be open to reconsidering our opinions when confronted with new information. That is how we should come to decisions. This is not a football team debate this is life or death for people. Empathize.
@sarahkliff The only reason we don't have it now is because corporations want to leech you for your money and give it to themselves. That is what for profit means, they are charging more than it actually takes to give us the service. Over 70% of us want #MedicareForAll, Pass it now or leave
@sarahkliff Pass #MedicareForAll it would save the US like 4/5 trillion dollars https://t.co/wIaSRmctb3		We can use that 5 trillion to help pay for #freecollege and #GreenNewDeal and maybe have some left over to spend on #socialsecurityforall.
It's not happening in part because of corruption and lack of popular involvement in the political process.

Americans objectively want #MedicareForAll #GreenNewDeal #Moneyoutofpolitics #endthewars and #freecollege. Because we are an oligarchy, we don't.
@CNN Fuck off CNN. O'Rourke is a corporate dem. This is why people hate the MSM, because ya'll are obviously corporate propagandists. Yes, corporate propagandist. You're trying so god damn hard to sell people on this guy when #BernieSanders objectively would improve more lives. Stop.

@justicedems Republicans are mounting a full court press. We must counterattack. Use this opportunity to throw #Medicare4All into the public discourse even more. We can use this republican slip up to get medical coverage for all Americans. We have to fight.
They don't care about you dude. These guys lack empathy. Millions of people could be effected. Thousands may die if this is appealed. Those deaths mean nothing, our lives mean nothing to them. We have to voice our outrage via protest and political activism. This shit is real https://t.co/tYeojbCbiV

@_geeberry @6ixNuck @BernieSanders We are re-learning our progressive and egalitarian rhetoric that drove the working class in the early 20th century. The fundamental nature of folks in the US hasn't changed much. We still live in capitalism and the things that workers fought for in the 30s/40s still apply to us.

@SenateGOP @SenSchumer This is what you get when you concede the direction you are approaching an issue.

@justicedems @CoryBooker I am glad people see through Booker. Sometimes cynicism can be toxic, but in the case of Booker, its really necessary. Good on you dude @CoryBooker for supporting this, but we know you're still taking corporate money so don't play this up too much. #GreenNewDeal  is a layup.
We need to have this sort of energy for each and every single issue there is. Politics needs to be more inclusive and be something people consume and produce more frequently. Only by investing people in politics will there be a strong populist opinion reflected in power. https://t.co/b9HyEbgR1T
@sabrina68 @PatTheBerner @who4fan I don't believe we should tear down any progressive momentum there is, it is enough of an uphill battle my dude, its been 50+ years since the New Deal was defeated by corporations.

@ML77 @politico Ya'll are centrist because you've been fed that line from conservatives. Why is it when Americans want to better their lives questions of the bill comes up but when we want to bomb something no one looks at the price tag???
The hardest fight always comes from within.

@Ocasio2018 If AOC was of age to run for President I'd absolutely vote for her. Experience be damned. She has her priorities in place and her judgement can lead to her picking folks who are qualified to help advise her. She is the future of the Democratic party and the United States.
@Ocasio2018 AOC has the potential to surpass FDR if this keeps up. People may berate me for jumping to conclusions she has only just gotten elected. But these revaluations on the systemic corruption IN Washington was something we all knew existed but never had confirmation like this.

@anarchosocial If a Democratic leader called for protests people would be out in the streets. Strong leadership is needed. Someone needs to step up. I have half a mind to.
@anarchosocial It's due to a lack of inspiring leadership. Our resistant leaders have been tranquilized and are too afraid to actually fight at all. They are tip toeing around the issues and want to make it seem like they don't really want to try at all. It's incredibly frustrating.
Fundraising helps give you exposure for your message but it's not everything. Engaging in the electorates and asking people for their vote works better. It's something corporate or "new democrats don't understand" progressives do tho and they are the future https://t.co/fujYa85mZE

@trubl9 @GrandKidBlessed @NewDay @CNN Thanks for listening my dude. We have to be the change we want to see.

@thealisonbecker Bernie will do more for women than literally any other candidate. I don't get identity politics. People are people. The best ideas from the best people should win. Not people who fill in a certain box on a form. This sort of thinking is tribal and backwards. Look into his policy.
@trubl9 @GrandKidBlessed @NewDay @CNN Our most celebrated citizens are those who took action for what is right. It's time we embrace that American tradition.
@trubl9 @GrandKidBlessed @NewDay @CNN Many more people used to be in unions, they organized themselves and took direct action to carve out their rights. Protest, civil disobedience, pressing officials by calling, email, donating to people who fight for them, talking to each other and sharing the workers perspectives.
@trubl9 @GrandKidBlessed @NewDay @CNN Not only stopping at conversation either. People need to have to willingness to take direct action to being about the reality they wish to happen. For too long Americans have been bullied and oppressed into becoming docile and satisfied with their station.
@trubl9 @GrandKidBlessed @NewDay @CNN Perspectives can be shared and exchanged. And the better ideas will win out. But only if people get to hear them. That's why spreading the word and talking to people is so important. We are too uncomfortable talking about politics to people, it needs to change.
@trubl9 @GrandKidBlessed @NewDay @CNN At times civil discourse can be hard to come by. People too easily live in their bubble. What we need is a platform to act as a way for people to share ideas openly and then have conversations about them. When people are forced to integrate their reality with everyone else...

@trubl9 @GrandKidBlessed @NewDay @CNN It's likely because they were given this talking point by someone who happens to be a corporate shill. The US is a police state. You can be shot no questions asked in today's America and you won't even have the peace of mind to know your killer is going away.

@colinjones @vicenews Nice to see what we will be expecting again soon enough with these economic policies.
@JZSamm @davidsirota Those labels have definitions and it's useful to use when you want to contrast perspectives. It's also useful because a lot of folks in Congress (Dems* and Dems) fall predominantly in one or the other. You have to generalize at times to get to a point you want to convey.
@BernardDouthit @davidsirota That sounds like bribery to me. Sounds like BRIBERY to anyone else?
@davidsirota It's closer to "the ones who are trying to stop debate are corporate sellouts or brainwashed corporate drones". Look, progressives will debate anyone because we are objectively correct on the issues. Data supports this, it's corporations and their stooges that try to silence.
@RepBarbaraLee @HouseGOP You need to be ready to fight corporate Democrats to the death when the time comes. It's the only way we will end this nightmare of an oligarchy that has persisted in our country for far too long.
@GrandKidBlessed @NewDay @CNN I mean when it's likely the cop is the one who is pointing the gun at my family it's kind of a tossup honestly.

@Letstalkturkey1 @mviser One year older than the current corporate faux leftist candidate Biden, a front-runner for the corporate wing of the Democratic party. 		Bernie is the most popular politician in the country so the base appeal comment is: 1. False parroting of false information or 2. A lie.

@gramsy338 @mviser Biden is also a corporate Democrat. He is also only a year younger than Bernie (check me on that) so the age argument doesn't really work. Educate yourself on his platform.
@gramsy338 @mviser You're factually incorrect. Bernie polls the best among young people because he speaks to their needs. College students love the guy, they are his base. Anyone who spent any amount of time studying Bernie knows this.
@thehill What we need is to share this perspective with every single person we know. But do it in a respectful and informative way. It can be hard for people to wake up from the illusion. Some will fight against it and continue to swallow the blue pill. But it is up to us to be the change
@GaryWypiszynski @thehill We can vote to govern ourselves any way we want if it becomes popular enough. All that I'd rather see is something that actually reflects what the PEOPLE want rather than the establishment and corporations.
@GaryWypiszynski @thehill Things aren't mandated by God to be as they are until the sun swallows us. It's a judgement call. We choose to remain an oligarchy in part due to a perceived association of oligarchic traditions with the "natural state of things" in combination with a sense of inefficacy.
@GaryWypiszynski @thehill We are an oligarchy. Defending oligarchy by discounting the popular vote is authoritarian in nature. More people than not want our country to look a certain way. Denying the people the vision of how they wish to be govern is authoritarian and unAmerican.

@thehill The present Republican party is insane. They have allowed this President to destroy one democratic norm after another. The fact this dude isn't impeached yet is insane. 		The Senate as an institution for the tyranny of the minority has merit.

@kchandwhipple @SMGDMFHJC @mviser Bernie was subjected to Clinton attack ads but he still almost won with no name recognition and a rigged system. We can't read the future perfectly. But you win elections by getting people to vote for you in the right places and Bernie polls better than anyone else. It's a fact
@kchandwhipple @SMGDMFHJC @mviser Polls have accurately projected the last election. A +13 point lead equates to an EC landslide. Are you familiar with the notion that anything above a +7 for Dems is an EC victory?		The establishment media has done opposition research against him the whole time. And he still wins
@kchandwhipple @SMGDMFHJC @mviser Which clearly shows him blowing every other politician out of the water. If the election isn't rigged again the dude will be President of these United States

@scentscene @DavidGierman @mviser Heya dude. Something to think about when you consider your candidate.

@RichardDurkin @TheDemocrats @staceyabrams Mueller's name will do down in history books as the agent who shown a light on the most corrupt administration in US history.
@TheDemocrats @staceyabrams Help her launch lawsuits into the voter suppression. If you aren't going to fight for the people who voted for you, you have no purpose as a political party.
@washingtonpost We knew this. SA is a hotbed for terrorists, we know this. What we need to do is vote in leaders who will hold them accountable. That is what we need to do. Vote. In 2020, America is on the ballot. True America or Fake America.
@staceyabrams thank you for continuing to fight. never stop fighting stacey. this is life or death for millions of people. live or death. thank you for fighting for a #trueamerica
@WhoopiGoldberg By speaking out against Just Democrats you have done harm to the opinions of the people of this country. They are for working class Americans. Americans put them there to represent us. Why? Because Pelosi and Feinstein have voted for policies that are against us
@WhoopiGoldberg Hi, please educate yourself about Justice Democrats. They represent the people rather than corporations. Educate yourself. Feinstein and Pelosi take money from corporations and that influences them. https://t.co/yqdJqwiZ7B

@NancyPelosi If you care for this Republic Representative Pelosi you will embrace this wind for change and hand power to the next generation of leaders. Please, this wave was possible because of the hopes and dreams of people looking for change, not more of the same. Please.
@HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @SenateDems		Listen to these people. You have to speak the language of Republicans. The language of power. You have the majority of the US behind you. USE IT!!!!	Republicans Plot To Strip Elected Democrat Of Power https://t.co/MBs1BPs4Kw via @YouTube
@HouseDemocrats Representative Pelosi cannot be allowed to be the Democratic leader. America is yearning for change. New leadership to combat the archaic Republicans is needed. Heed my words! They are the words of the people! Please!
@NancyPelosi Representative Pelosi you have to step down and allow a Progressive to take the reigns. The Republicans are counting on you winning and then taking back the house in 2020. Read the political winds, Progressivism is on the rise. Ride the wave instead of fighting it.

@HouseDemocrats Do NOT repeat the mistakes of the 2016 election and putting into leadership establishment, corporate democrats. PROGRESSIVE POPULIST Democrats in House leadership will see you rule this country. From top to bottom ala FDR. Do NOT elect Representative Pelosi.
@NancyPelosi Representative Pelosi you have to step down and allow a Populist Progressive to lead The House. The Democratic Party needs to reinvent itself and embrace its role as the part of THE PEOPLE. NOT CORPORATIONS.
A progressive populist agenda should be the eternal guideline of this party and this Democratic house. Think of THE PEOPLE, serve the interest of THE PEOPLE. And always keep in mind a future where the greatest number of people in this country can be happy. 	@TheDemocrats
Despite the superficial appeals to unity from President Trump, we cannot allow his corruption of our politics to become the status quo in this question. We must follow Dr. King's example and continue to push for an America that judges us by content.	@HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats
Look at what Richard Ojeda is doing in the reddest district in the country. A progressive populist will become the next FDR of this country. That is the winning strategy going forward. Populist Progressive. 		@SenSanders @TheDemocrats @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenWarren
@HillaryClinton Please do not run again Secretary Clinton. This country needs a progressive non establishment candidate from the left. I respect you and your accomplishment but the best thing you can do is not run. Please, for our country.
@AP Thank god these women had a moral backbone and turned down the office. This is disgusting. And I am getting sick of this corruption and violence coming from Republicans and their operatives. Shit needs to change. #VoteThemOut
@JamesKosur This shit can't keep happening. The ability to poison the minds of the American people without punishment is going too far. These people and certain members of the conservative media need to be held accountable for what they peddle as reality.
@chuckwoolery Ya'll should be locked up for poisoning the minds of the American people.

@Maelvampyre @WSJ Why was he unable to do so? because he had a minority party who's sole political goal was to run him out of office. Don't blame Obama for Republican obstructionism. https://t.co/6q0WUbWKtb

@Reuters The jury is in. This was a coordinated attempt to wipe out prominent liberal and progressive leadership. This was an attempt to relive the days of antiquity where they mass assassinate their political opponents. This is the world we live in. Don't get scared, VOTE AGAINST THIS.
@Dorunda Yes, yes they would. Have you seen some of these supporters?
@brookefoxnews You know what is really not productive? Trying to murder your political opponents #magabomber
@jace_tobias They were caught because of the different mailing system each of these high profile people have. Not because it was a false flag. Entertaining this conspiracy theory is merely taking away from the conversation.
@Bryan700 If you believe this is a false flag no, no I don't. What are you saying?
@NiccumTerri @CNNPolitics Don't hope. Vote
@Denise62386150 they do which is why they are trying. instigating violence and its effects directly plays into their interests. (or so they believe)
@SenSanders Please take care of yourself Bernie, we cannot have anything happen to you. These events reflect our political climate. Your leadership is needed now more than ever.
