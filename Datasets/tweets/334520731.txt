@SkyVendor3 @chap1nita @NancyPelosi Making something illegal doesn't stop people from engaging in that activity. It only pushes it underground.		If I do coca I want to know it's safe and not cut with fetynol. I also want to make sure I don't get robbed. That means having a legal framework.
@SkyVendor3 @chap1nita @NancyPelosi Legalize and regulate both prostitution and drugs. I just solved both those problems all while putting the cartels out of business and reducing the flow of refugees. You are welcome.

@zombiesands @TNsmartgal @davidhogg111 You are right. It's time to stop meddling in the middle east and measuring the health of our economy by housing and gas prices. We want to help poor people but push policies that drive up housing costs as well as manipulate food and oil costs so they remain higher than otherwise.
@TNsmartgal @zombiesands @davidhogg111 2. While minimum the wage has not been adjusted for inflation. Nobody actually earns minimum wage. Often even starter jobs pay atleast $8.00. Which means the market rate is just that. And cost of living varies from state to state. Raising the federal wage wouldn't make sense.
@TNsmartgal @zombiesands @davidhogg111 1. I'm talking long term. There are always Short term fluctuations. And this is obviously accounting for inflation. Dollar for dollar an hours worth of work purchases more food today than in the 1930s
@JaclynBrohl_ Well.. Do you blame him?
@TNsmartgal @zombiesands @davidhogg111 Not true. The total cost of living has gone up but the price of. Many consumer goods has decreased.		Healthcare, education, car insurance, etc, Are the main areas responsible for driving up costs. All areas subject to regulation and price controls like that of the minimum wage.

@scottsantens @basicincomenews I don't disagree. I've already stated a UBI would be more efficient and giving folks money is better than a fractured welfare system.		I'm just pointing out that it's disengenuous to say it will magically fix a poor persons mentality.
@littlebrowndawg @basicincomenews @scottsantens Not for long. People blow through wealth every day.		This is why mega millions winners often go broke. Giving money to those with a poor mentality doesn't fix the mentality.		The difference between rich and poor can be demonstrated in the marshmallow test.

@TheEconomist @frankfieldteam Finally most of our welfare costs are wasted in administration costs. A simple UBI built into the tax code could easily replace our current model. Further if we modernize and actually use computers to cut out the middle man we could greatly cut costs of the program.

@TheEconomist @frankfieldteam A few problems here. The article first argues that it would cost a lot of money. Then that businesses would underpay workers to take advantage.		Except those same businesses would actually be paying that hefty tax bill.

@SenSchumer Because he doesnt have to comply numb nuts.  It is the authority of Congress to investigate and impeach Trump if there is any wrongdoing. Special prosecutors have no constitutional authority to subpoena a sitting president who cannot be idicted.

The only way for #UBI to work without distorting the marketplace too much is to use it as a safety net that tapers off. People always want more. Take advantage of that and wean them off of the system.
Universal Basic Income can't just be free money. Goods are finite and thus need to be rationed. Giving everyone $15000 for example doesn't actually create houses. It inflates demand and thus prices. But without allowing supply to grow there will still be a shortage.
@scottsantens are your familiar with the negative income tax? I've always argued a 30% tax rate applied to a bracket of $30,000 would supply a basic income without distorting the market.

Yes we need to enforce the law. But there are different levels of criminality. There is a reason the swat team doesn't kick in your door and throw in a flash bang for unpaid parking tickets.		The #Asylum situation is no different. We don't need break up families over this.
#Asylum seekers should be detained until they can be vetted and the legality of their entry into our country is sorted out. But there is no reason we can't utilize family detention centers.
The #asylum situation is just one example of how both sides have gone off the rails. Progressives imply that there should be no consequences for breaking law. Meanwhile conservatives show a complete lack of compassion for people that just want a better life.

@safetyinletters @washingtonpost Don't confuse free speech with the first ammendment. Hunting somone down to ruin their livelyhood is absolutely a violation of the principles of free speech.

Its not the gun grabbers who are most dangerous to gun rights, so much as its the fake conservatives that give in to their demands.
We've forgotten that being angry, or defensive are natural human traits.		Saying hurtful things in anger or jest, things we may even come to regret is part of the human condition.		It makes little sense to me to attack somones lively hood over that.
I think we all need to loosen the valve and let some steam out on occasion.		But with the entire world watching what we say, we instead decide to bottle it up. Until we explode, releasing all of that bottled up toxicity on somone.

@CONSMILITIA @ShawnaLeneeShow @fleccas @davidhogg111 Read this again. And very slowly. Nobody is arguing over the definition of militia. We are arguing over the definition of regulated and how it pertains to the individuals that have the inalienable rights.

@CONSMILITIA @ShawnaLeneeShow @fleccas @davidhogg111 And that has something to do with what I said how?		It comes down to who makes up the Militia? US citizenry. And US citizens must be armed in order for a well regulated Militia to function.
@CONSMILITIA @ShawnaLeneeShow @fleccas @davidhogg111 I'm not denying the legal definition of militias.

We have an inalienable right to self defense which is merely outlined and protected in the constitution. If the state deems that it doesn't apply we can always withdraw consent.
@ShawnaLeneeShow @fleccas @davidhogg111 Well regulated. I.e "well maintained" or "well supplied."		Because we need a well supplied militia the people's (you and I) right to keep and bare arms. SHALL NOT be infringed.

@VVWRITER20 @RepBPhinneyNH @AP4Liberty @nogimmickspod A MILITIA being necessary (,) The PEOPLE'S right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. 		It does not say the militia has the right to bear arms. But rather the people. Because the people must be armed to form an effective militia.
@proud_snowflake @RonaldIrwin @ABC Somone clearly can't strike G a full paragraph together.		Please. The "well regulated" argument has been covered a thousand times. Try again lefty.
@ABC Reading from that script must be hard if you have to glance down for the word "adult"		They are clearly being coached by an outside player. Whoever it is does a good job of keeping the narrative on the NRA and the "adults" at every turn. Clearly some vulture swooped in.
@MattSchultz13 @HamillHimself @ElizabethGalen That's not how the constitution works.		The government may excersicing any enumerated powers so long as it does not infringe on the restrictions outlined in the bill of rights.		Your argument would justify rounding up and executing people if it ensured tranquility.
@HamillHimself Reading a script and being coached by people with agendas is hardly "being a leader"
@VVWRITER20 @RepBPhinneyNH @AP4Liberty @nogimmickspod Show me where it says in the constitution that the militias right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.		No. It says a Militia being nessesary therefore the PEOPLES right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.		People were clearly seperated from militia in phrasing
I say this as an atheist. Mocking peoples #thoughtsandprayers just makes you an asshole.		And I'm a fucking asshole too. So think about that for a moment.
@dotcomlandlords @DVGCPresident @KamalaHarris So why should a man have to exploit his own body to work and pay child support for a child the woman wanted?		Is this really about bodily autonomy?
Demonizing a faceless organization is easy. When you scream bloody murder at the #NRA remember that they are so powerful because of their 5 million and growing dues paying members.		Attacking average Americans that stand for the #2ndAmendment. They're just deplorables right?
@longlivekcx I always have to say. These comment threads are a clear example of why women were not allowed to vote. Leave the thinking to the men that didn't spend half their life getting their skulls rammed into the headboard.

The modern #Atheists screaming for #guncontrol are exactly the ones spewing hateful rhetoric that embolden these people to begin with!
If people want to offer prayers that isn't a cue for your smug pompous ass to jam your unwanted views down their throats. #GunControl
The only people mocking prayers, wanting #GunControl are atheists. Something I find to be sickening considering the shooter was an #atheist

@gdombrowski11 @truthteller8889 @ya_boy_brian @SenSanders 1. It's not so simple. High Profits to shareholders means more investment. One can't simply measure Cost to R&amp;D.
@POTUS Don't take credit for it. You'll also have to take credit for the fall when the bubble bursts.
@SenSanders Yeah let's power everything with solar freaking roadways.. FFS people are so delusional. Natural gas is the most realistic energy source.

@gdombrowski11 @truthteller8889 @ya_boy_brian @SenSanders Because the costs help with R&amp;D to make new drugs in the firstplace. That's why the US is the leader in drug biotechnologies.

@1hairyman @DadWearsGlasses I can't find the numbers either way. Google isn't giving me relevant results.
@1hairyman @DadWearsGlasses actually. Im looking for the statistic. Google just wants to give me murder rate, what races are killing others
@1hairyman @DadWearsGlasses whites also make up almost 80% of the populating. Being that white men make up about 40% so not as big a jump.
@1hairyman @BibleReloaded @DadWearsGlasses Those are facts.
@1hairyman @BibleReloaded @DadWearsGlasses like what? That blacks commit 60% of violent crime? That whiter countries tend to be better?
@1hairyman @DadWearsGlasses Yeah no. I don't buy the "advantage" argument. Its not your fault if born poor. It is if you die poor.
@BibleReloaded @1hairyman @DadWearsGlasses Oh no the "the race card" can't bring up politically incorect facts or its racist.
@BloatedCarcass @CaseyCorpulent Your point? Cars aren't a garanteed right.
@DadWearsGlasses @1hairyman @BibleReloaded I don't think you do. I can criticize destructive cultures without advocating active violence.
@1hairyman @DadWearsGlasses It means G is right next to H on a touchpad.
@1hairyman @DadWearsGlasses If that were true then they wouldn't be poor. Poor people are either stupid or lazy.
@DadWearsGlasses @1hairyman @BibleReloaded why is it the whiter a country is tge less of a shit hole ot is? Hmmm..
@DadWearsGlasses @1hairyman @BibleReloaded Want to come to Flint or detroit and hang?
@DadWearsGlasses @1hairyman @BibleReloaded So they don't commit 60% of violent crimes?
@1hairyman @DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded stop being poor and get off your ass and work.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Can't refute the facts. Calls me ignorant.. ok.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Fine. Again 60% of violent crimes are committed by blacks. I call for black control.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded committing most crimes is a relevant subject.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Human death statistics as an argument to control guns. one demographic.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded *Argument
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded so when you discount destructive black culture the numbers drop drastically.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Yes. Humans with a different culture.		My argent is that their culture is destructive.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Yes it is. If you are unable to differentiate between cultures and demographics than you wont get causation
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded You are missing the point. If we didn't have blacks shooting each other gun crimes wouldn't be so prevalent.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Idiotic. So blacks don't make up 60% of violent crime in the US?
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Lets ban blacks because clearly theres a correlation.		Basically the same argument.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded oh wow you caught a spelling error from a phone tweet. You are sooo smart. Im in awe.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Blacks make up 60% of violent crime in the US.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Swizterland has very few gun crimes relative to us in spite having a large cache of guns.
@DadWearsGlasses @BibleReloaded Because maybe the corelation you are looking at is black population rather than. Gun ownership
@BibleReloaded @hasselstash Ever been to murder valley?
@BibleReloaded @hasselstash Fines if "Caught" key there. Do what we say or we use our guns on you... for sayftey.
@amandahursxc Ban cars! Too many people die in accidents.
@amandahursxc well no shit. Accidents happen with any tool. Thats like saying we should live in the stone age because stuff can hurt you.
@BibleReloaded You forgot to include blacks killing each other bloating the statistics even further.
@StableToFrisky @BibleReloaded And their crime rate went up.. soooo
@BibleReloaded Because its asked in a way to make the answer wrong without explanation. Its a prime example of a loaded question.
@BibleReloaded Its disingenuous to use gun related deaths which include suicide to bring forth a mental image of people murdering each other
@BibleReloaded Nice loaded question. Very intellectual of you. People will commit suicide if thats what they want to do.
@SenSanders Then quit driving up the costs by subsidizing it you old goat!
@BibleReloaded Why is it atheists can b the least logical people outside of religion?
@BibleReloaded because people can commit suicide with virtually anything other than a gun...

@SaraiBabe @blackvoices but take "straight out of Compton" as a white guy that doesn't appeal to me. Its aimed at a specific demographic.

@DFlexmatrix @Clarknt67 @MileHighJoe1 So then your stupid law can be overturned too. Cut the BS law arguments. I DGAF about collective BS
@Clarknt67 @MileHighJoe1 You know what I'm getting at. don't want. KKK have free speech. Should you be forced to serve them?
@Clarknt67 @MileHighJoe1 I'm not talking about the parade. When they come to your hotel you should be forced to serve them?
@DFlexmatrix @Clarknt67 @MileHighJoe1 again with the stupid law arguments. Slavery was legal. Jim crow was a law. The law isn't always moral
@Clarknt67 @MileHighJoe1 Its still part of your first amendment to decide who you wish to serve. To make someone work for you is servitude.
@MileHighJoe1 @Clarknt67 So say you own a hotel. should you be forced to serve the Aryan Nation or KKK when they go on a hate march?
@Clarknt67 again the Negros don't own my property. I DO! And jim crow was a law. A bit of research will show most discrimination was public.
@Clarknt67 Yes it does. That's what freedom of association F**king means.
@Clarknt67 besides. Stupid argument.  gay marriage is illegal in most states. so does that make it right? laws aren't always moral.
@Clarknt67 who the F**k cares? You pass an imaginary law through an imaginary government and that gives you the right to police my property?
@Chris_Saul what do you mean public square? you mean within the imaginary borders in your imaginary democracy? Their property is now yours?
@Clarknt67 ah.. so the first amendment doesn't apply to business owners? what about freedom of association?
@Clarknt67 I don't support it either. Won't give them my business. That said I'ts their property. Don't like it open your own bakery.
@Clarknt67 But I'm not a gay marriage opponent. nor am I making a slippery slope. I'm simply pointing out the reality of what WILL happen.
@Clarknt67 I didn't I said it was a two way street. and many homosexuals would support it. As evident by the lawsuits in other countries.
@Captain1986 IDGAF about the law. Slavery was a law. Runaway slaves broke the law. Do you really follow your logic through?
@pianomcg @JulieBorowski @SenTedCruz @RonPaul Congrats You pointed out a twitter typo from months ago. Care to go through my old FB posts?
@Clarknt67 And when did I say I was against Gay marriage or in support of homophobes?
@Captain1986  Hey dipshit. I never said they did. But you have forced private owners to break their beliefs. So don't act like you wouldn't
@Clarknt67 That isn't at all what I said. Please avoid strawmanning. I support getting gov out of marriage all together.
@Clarknt67 This isn't about your screwed up collectivist ideals. Its about thinking you own other peoples businesses. IDGF about the country
@Clarknt67 @MarcusRSilva Not in the US. It would harm the movement if they took that step to quickly. They have to win other battles first.
@MarcusRSilva @Clarknt67 You already use the government to force others to act within your PC expectations. don't tell me you wouldn't.
@Clarknt67 @MarcusRSilva bull. You know as well as I do that its down the road.  History repeats. Property rights always fall to PC.
@Chris_Saul @Clarknt67 @MarcusRSilva you mean like bake a cake? And I'm an atheist.
@Clarknt67 @MarcusRSilva agreed. But its a two way streak. shouldn't be able to prevent gay marriage. nor force it on church.

For People Who Cry about the Environment. The NSA alone Uses over a million gallons of water per day to cool their super computers.
@UberFacts @Powermanium If Germany was really worried about that they would get rid of there Fascist Prussian Education system.
@LibertarianWing And If the libertarian party wins they will just become polarized in a few years just as the others. Unfortunate fact
@Obomination1 @pjamericanpatri Because #Feminism like most activism isn't about equality. Its about power, and free stuff.
@Dan_Gray_ @pjamericanpatri No Illegals are only illegal because laws make it so. whats tearing the country apart is the laws.
@RedScareBot This Proletarian Quite likes his Capitalistic Chains thank you.
@libertyideals Well No duh. Did it really take this much time for an old fart in a moo moo to decipher 1st amendment. It's plain English.
The ACA is Corporatism not Socialism. There is a difference, even if that difference is paper thin.
@charliekirk11 Just a recommendation. The font in the bio is near unreadable thanks to the poor color choice. I'd recommend White on red.

@hamilt0n Sorry. I didn't think much of the others on the CC. It is really dumb Twitter automatically adds everyone to that.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown I've made valid arguments. It's not my fault you are too childish to clearly see them.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown If you don't understand how BASIC intro philosophy works your brain is not worth my time.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown yeah sounds like youv'e never studied econ in your life.		I'm done arguing with a 12 year old
@ARossP Genius always looks insane to those to stupid to understand it. Basic Philosophy being too hard to get says more about society.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown Its the same as you can't break get viruses. I destroyed your modem. Well no shit guy.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown With programs to keep people employed. You are setting up a premise thats never wrong
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown Depressions aren't the only economic threat. of course you can't have massive Unemployment.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown You Dumb Dumby Doo doo Head! Am I winning the argument yet?		here. http://t.co/LtW3878Ga7
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown Um no. as a former CS major I can tell you that modern protocols and cabling were private.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown Yeah raising spending was surely libertarian.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown That about sums your argument up.		"Repeat What I've heard with no research, Adhom, Insult"
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown Key word "IF". the fact is that California overtaxed itself out of relevance.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown It was private institutions that made the internet what it is. Someone never heard of TCP/IP?
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown No It didn't. The government invented a defense network for about 12 computers.
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown haha.. Ronald Reagan? Libertarian? If you had any credibility you just lost it!
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown um no. Silicon valley came from private entities capitalizing on what was collecting dust#IBM
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown Sorry. Imaginary money to pay workers to build Roads that nobody drives on. *Fixed
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown You mean The California people are clamoring to leave?
@atraf404 @ARossP @cal_abel @hamilt0n @cobrown Because borrowing imaginary money to pay workers to do jobs nobody needs is the solution!

Even Krugman Said the Low Transportation costs can push an economy, and drive people to urban areas.		So why are we overtaxing Fuel?

@Freedorman no. You can't pick and chose what you believe in your own damn bible. if you follow broken morals do so on your own.
@Freedorman You are not arguing. You are asserting your right to impose your beliefs onto me. there is a difference.
@Freedorman So you ignore the old testament? then I guess Jesus was just a dude with magic tricks?
@Freedorman You cannot believe the new testament without the old. since it that profisized Jesus. but that leads many contradictions
@Freedorman calls for death - Lev 20:27, Ex 21:15, Lev 20:29, Deut 17:12, Ex 22:20, Lev 20:10, 2 Chron 15: 12-13, Lev 21:9		Shall I go on?
@Freedorman well that's because you are an emotional idiot who wants control of my business to pacify the problem.
@Freedorman also which bible did you read? the real one old, and new testament? or the mass printed mini version for the sheeple?
@Freedorman the point that morals drawn from the bible are not something to follow. If homosexuality is bad. than so are the other parts.
@Freedorman The bible, Religious leaders, Zealots. etc.		But of course you are probably one of the Christians who never read your bible?
@Freedorman because these are the same people that called for the stoning, torcher, and murder of thousands. it has everything to do with it
@JulieBorowski @zachblox Please tell me what you think. I enjoy your channel, and would awesome if you checked mine		http://t.co/0ILStYb9nl
@Freedorman No of course not. people who believe its immoral have no understanding of science and believe in magical fairy tales.
@Freedorman this is not according to my moral values but according to liberty. we are individuals and are thus naturally free to our own.
@Freedorman no it is not. because while i hold a belief I don't force it on others. I only hold my belief in defense of yours.
@Freedorman that's not a universal moral. its not my opinion of right and wrong. I only disdain from your morals pushed on me and my fellows
@Freedorman  morality is an opinion. its an opinion of whats right and wrong. some think homosexuality is immoral, some don't.
@Freedorman  that is not moral. a moral value is ones OWN opinion on right or wrong. as it being your own, universal morals are not possible
@NaturallyKatz correct me if i'm wrong. aren't they already following everybody.		But your right. its internet tough guy shit.
@NancyGraceHLN where were those tears when Casey Anthony got off? 		I hate the fake media. I guess you need those ratings. #fake #Zimmerman
@Freedorman that is not a moral. do you know the definition of morality? it seems to me you have the republican definition.
@Freedorman  no I don't. for 1 moral by  definition can not be universal. we all have our own. which is why we all should live and let live.
@Freedorman yes it is. I look down on those who Force their whims on others. when did I say I was not judgmental?
@_GetYoLifeee No i'm not. She is a black conservative, and  she is betraying her race. she forgot to ask NAACP for permission of oppinion
@j3VOL I can't stand watching the news right now. There trying to pre convict based on emotion, and race rather than evidence.
@_GetYoLifeee Lets get this straight. YOU ARE NOT A RACE. you simply have a darker complexion than I. Yet you segregate yourself.
@j3VOL I wouldn't mind. Someone with actual knowledge of the law wouldn't allow stupid convictions.
@_GetYoLifeee so she wants to be white? so we are not individuals? but different skins? whose segregating who?
@_GetYoLifeee Ali herself referred to another lady as an Oreo for not agreeing with the black consensus. so all black people must agree?
@Freedorman 10th amendment was to avoid issues with powers not being defined. It was about splitting powers. moral law can still be avoided.
@Freedorman no. as said. virtue is subjective. We all have our own. to control another mans "virtues" based on your whims is wrong.
@_GetYoLifeee  What are you talking about? It's miss Ali and the media turning this into a race issue. Its her who is the damn racist.
@HLNTV got to love seeing the fake jury vote by race lines. none of the blacks in it could say why he was guilty.. only that he was.. #Skins
@_GetYoLifeee @DrDrewHLN The truth to what? that you think we are responsible for past transgressions that happened before we were born?
@DrDrewHLN tell #MissAli that Shes the attitude thats holding the black population down. blame, blame, blame white people.
@DrDrewHLN when are you going to quit bending over for Miss Ali, and start calling her out on her Bull S#%t?		#ZimmermanTrial #MissAli
Worst Anti-#Libertarian Arguments		http://t.co/SKthtRHRgp
@Freedorman No.. read it. It simply grants all powers not granted in the constitution to states. its up to the states to draft there own
@Freedorman Its not my place to promote virtue in your life. What is virtue? this is subjective.
@FiveRights I made a video on this very subject.		http://t.co/0ILStYb9nl #ZimmermanTrial
@Freedorman  The tenth amendment has nothing to do with morality laws. It simply grants powers not implied by the constitution to the states
@Freedorman Same could have been said of democracy, republic.		we came close to a libertarian utopia. I think it was called the constitution
@Freedorman No. Morals are subjective. It's not my place to tell you how to live, who to date, what to do. ect.
@Freedorman so lets get this straight we shouldn't try something because you think it hasn't been tried. how does anything get tried at all?
@JetSetterRyan Is there something wrong with that. If I decided to sell my Kidney does that somehow effect you. Its mine is it not?
