This past November, LGBTQ people and pro-equality voters delivered the victory we needed to move equality forward. Now, we have to seize the moment and the momentum and make full federal LGBTQ equality a reality. Join us!
The patchwork of laws that currently exist leaves our entire community vulnerable to discrimination and attack. The Equality Act would protect the rights of all LGBTQ Americans by adding gender identity and sexual orientation to our nation‚Äôs non-discrimination laws.
50 percent of LGBTQ people live in states without legal protections. That means that millions of Americans are at risk of being fired, refused service, or denied housing simply because of who they are or who they love.

@mike_pence Today, as @mike_pence reads hollow prepared remarks, he himself is part of the problem. For decades he has stood in the way of real progress to combat HIV &amp; AIDS in this country and around the world. #RealMikePence https://t.co/jVMNcQ1JhS
@mike_pence As the outbreak of HIV &amp; AIDS spiraled out of control, Pence was ‚Äúreluctant‚Äù to lift a ban on needle exchanges. After the CDC intervened, Pence continued to drag his feet, waiting a year to sign off on funding. Meanwhile, 190 people contracted HIV in Scott County alone.
@mike_pence Just look at when @mike_pence was governor of Indiana. Cuts to public health funding helped fuel the worst outbreak of HIV &amp; AIDS in Indiana‚Äôs history. The outbreak in Scott County was enabled by the closure of a Planned Parenthood clinic -- the county‚Äôs only HIV testing center.
.@mike_pence marking #WorldAIDSDay right now is truly the height of hypocrisy. From spreading misinformation about condom use, to contributing to a major outbreak of HIV &amp; AIDS in his home state, Pence has put ideology before the health &amp; lives of countless people. #RealMikePence

Exit polls show LGBTQ people made up to 6-7% of the electorate with 83% voting for the pro-equality Democrat. @HRC‚Äôs endorsed candidates fought for the LGBTQ vote and it carried them to victory.
By reclaiming a pro-equality majority in the House, we now have the ability to pull the emergency brake on this administration, pass the Equality Act, and protect healthcare.
Senator Dean Heller and half of the House incumbents we defeated had a 0 out of 100 on @HRC's Congressional Scorecard. The average score among them was 15. By ousting those who work against us, we now have partners in Congress who will work with us to move equality forward.

Thanks to all the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who used their time today to question Howard Nielson about his history of attacking the rights of LGBTQ people. His views disqualify him from the federal bench and his nomination must be rejected.
Nielson submitted this anti-LGBTQ argument in the Prop 8 case:		"Only if Chief Judge Walker had unequivocally disavowed any interest in marrying his partner could the parties and the public be confident that he did not have a direct personal interest in the outcome of the case." https://t.co/1SMyYbHJlT
Proud to see @SenKamalaHarris during her first day on the Senate Judiciary Committee holding Howard Nielson accountable for his anti-LGBTQ record. He tried to thwart the Constitutional rights of millions during Prop 8, and for that he should be flatly rejected.
Howard Nielson has staked his career on promoting anti-LGBTQ propaganda. The Senate Judiciary Committee cannot let Nielson be confirmed. https://t.co/79fuT74Lvx
During the Prop 8 case in 2011, I listened to Howard Nielson and his team argue that a Reagan &amp; Bush nominated federal judge couldn‚Äôt rule on a civil rights case BECAUSE he was gay. Then-Attorney General @KamalaHarris summed it up best: https://t.co/X5eOj0qnDc
Howard Nielson infamously claimed that a gay judge couldn‚Äôt be trusted to rule on a case involving LGBTQ rights. He is not fit to serve in the Judiciary.
While defending unconstitutional Proposition 8 in court, Howard Nielson argued that homosexuality is a choice. His views have no basis in reality.
Howard Nielson fought in court to defend Prop 8, the notoriously unconstitutional law that prohibited loving, same-sex couples from marrying in California. We fought him then, and we‚Äôre fighting him now.

How could Pence, the head of Trump‚Äôs transition, not know anything about this? Not believable and doesn't add up.
2.) Sally Yates tried to protect Pence by warning him that Flynn had lied to him, which had caused him to lie in his own public statements. Pence quiet when Yates gets fired, but Flynn keeps his job for 2 more weeks?
1) If Christie knew that Flynn was a bad actor and warned Trump not to hire him, why did Pence later let the fox in the hen house?
