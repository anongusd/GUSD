Food is at the center of so many traditions. Food is essential to our bodies. Food deserves to be celebrated, enjoyed, &amp; shared. The same could be said about the truth in #food. #TrendsAZ #FoodTruths

People will forget the perfect soundbite, they‚Äôll forget your professional work, but they‚Äôll never forget the way you make them feel.  Our collective challenge (#farmers &amp; #dietitians) is how people feel about #food. More coming up in Food Truths next.  #TrendsAZ
Three steps in Knowing Your Food Source.  1) Consider context, especially around #farm claims.  2) Evaluate content, particularly on #food labels. 3. Measure food claims against your OWN standards.  #TrendsAZ #undeniablydairy
Farming is a deeply personal business. Unfortunately, the #farm side of the plate sometimes leads with science &amp; data, rather than connecting with stories of how personal it is to us. That‚Äôs why we get a little defensive, but farmers care deeply. #realitycheck #agchat #TrendsAZ
Food deserves to be celebrated. it is time for #farmers, #dietitians, family consumer science educators and teachers to connect on that commonality.  #TrendsAZ #UndeniablyDairy
Excited to be working with #dietitians &amp; #educators this morning at Dairy Council of Arizona #TrendsAZ Conference to provide perspective on how #food comes from #farms with ‚ÄúKnowing Your Food Source.‚Äù
Consumers will google and check food claims. They like to be involved . We need to think of new ways to connect with and reassure our consumers through involving them with the grand and values, says Kantar at #TrendsAZ.
Consumers want more involvement - they want their brand to "say something" or "do something."  1 in 3 consumers make a genuine effort to support companies that give back to the local community, which has grown since 2015. #TrendsAZ
Health is no longer synonymous with diet, but "free from" and "natural" are. Diets are more focused on back to basics. Increased concern about ingredients with more ways to track what we are putting into our bodies.  Kantar #TrendsAZ
Are you #mom looking for solid #food info? Get it from #dietitians at https://t.co/wLK3JEAMDk #foodchat #RDchat
Customizable convenience is key with smaller sized households!  Think Keurig, single serving, etc. says Kantar at #TrendsAZ.
Smoothies represent an opportunity to engage children with milk again says Kantar at #TrendsAZ. Peach, strawberry, banana and the like are popular flavors.  Centennials are much more pragmatic, they are more self aware &amp; want to be different than millennials. #TrendsAZ
"There is a growing disconnect between younger consumers &amp; milk" says Kantar.  Nearly 100% of 6-7 year-olds in 2012 drank milk. Today same group 70%.  They are leaving the category faster than other group. Education about the necessity of milk for nutrition is critical. #TrendsAZ
Per Kantar, what teens drink in the average week has changed dramatically compared to teens in previous generations.  Sodas dropped 18%, milk down 17%, fruit juice down 4%. 8% more iced tea, 55% increase in water, 18% increased smoothies, 12% growth in iced coffee. #TrendsAZ
Centennials and millennials will account for 45% of market in next 30 years. Centennials are born after 1997. 40% say "My choice of drink brands is important - I believe what I buy says something about who I am." #TrendsAZ
American consumers are more educated than ever before, according to Kantar. "Negative press has impacted consumers' perception of key refreshment categories." #TrendsAZ #RDchat
Soda, milk, fruit juice all declding. Growth in bottled water, plant based beverages, smoothies, iced coffee.  New, fusion categories are gaining share and have secondary component of milk. #TrendsAZ #undeniablydairy
Milk is still huge category, but it is declining. In 2011, 50% of Americans drink milk in average week. Just 4 years later, less than 50% drink milk in a week says Kantar. This makes me sad, particularly for children needing protein and calcium. #undeniablydairy #TrendsAZ
8 core categories have lost substantial share of beverage occasions, per Kantar: Hot coffee, hot tea, soda, iced tea, milk, fruit juice, fruit drinks, drink mixes. Water continues to gain share of occasions, in both tap &amp; bottled.  #TrendsAZ
The beverages landscape has changed significantly, from soda generation in 80s to bottled water boom to energy drinks to replenishment &amp; health to now new age fusion &amp; nutrition, per Kantar Worldpanel. Plant based grows drinkers by 25% in 2 years. #TrendsAZ #dairy
Consumers in America drink 7.4 Trillion fluid ounces/year. That's 80 olympic sized swimming pools. That's 143 billion ounces/week or 11.1 billion beverage occasions. #Dairy milk accounts for 8%. #TrendsAZ

@TheOneSchmucker Understood. I've tried to look for science as to why reasonable and rational people make the decisions they do about food. I believe there has to be some neuroscience involved, but have yet to find that answer.
@BoshartDavisAg Trust me, I get it. I think it's impossible for all of us to remember all the label claims. But thanks, it's nice to hear you use Food Truths.
@FarmChicJodi Why?

@AgNews_Otto @SmithAgConrad @Walmart It was the Lebanon, IN store and I was told by two employees that there was no milk because of a "supplier issue." The store is 2 hours from the new plant at most.
@SmithAgConrad @AgNews_Otto Sorry for delay, it's the first week of our county fair and I've been up to my eyeballs in cow hair, sugar and flour - or at least monitoring my 4-Her. I hadn't gotten it on Twitter yet because of all that. Thanks for sharing - WM not having milk in our local community is crazy.
Yes, you can also see the lack of milk (90% of case reserved for WM brand milk that was missing). It was sourced from IN plant, which means it had to come from their own. BEYOND FRUSTRATING to see an empty milk case when dairy farmers are hurting so badly! https://t.co/hREfRxjT6P

@LilianBrislen @albertafarmlife @foodtank @JodiKoberinski @LeahMcGrathRD @ClaytonRobins @FarmGirlJen Just curious if you've ever farmed? Or had your family farm experience bankruptcy? I have. Those of us who actually produce food have a perspective rarely brought into the philosophical debate. I maintain that farming is a practice, one built on feeding people, NOT an agenda.
@LilianBrislen @albertafarmlife @foodtank @JodiKoberinski @LeahMcGrathRD @ClaytonRobins @FarmGirlJen The graphic was about farmers, not corporations. I've worked with thousands of farmers across the country, have cattle myself - and don't know any of them that believe their best interest is in their "input dealer." Again, family businesses come in many sizes &amp; shapes.

@LilianBrislen @albertafarmlife @foodtank @JodiKoberinski @LeahMcGrathRD @ClaytonRobins @FarmGirlJen Guess that's the difference; farmers don't have "agendas." They have a family business.
