I agree with members on both sides of the aisle that declaring a national emergency sets a dangerous precedent, undermines the role of Congress and our Constitution, &amp; distracts from our ability to find serious, long-term solutions.
8.7M people in NY are not getting high-speed internet, and Chenango &amp; Tioga counties have some of the worst broadband coverage in NY. This is exactly why I invited FCC Chairman Pai to #NY22. He needs to see firsthand the challenges rural consumers face. https://t.co/R73YFqpf5T
It‚Äôs also an example of what we can accomplish if we put aside our differences and work together to find common ground. That‚Äôs the kind of leadership our country deserves, and it‚Äôs the approach I‚Äôll continue to take. (2/2)
I am glad both sides were able to work together to prevent another govt shutdown. Shutdowns hurt everyday Americans &amp; threaten our country‚Äôs safety &amp; security.  This deal is not perfect, but it is an important step to help secure our border and keep our country safe. (1/2)
There are real consequences to these all-or-nothing political games, where people refuse to work together to find common ground. NY has now lost thousands of good-paying jobs &amp; revenue that could have been invested in our roads, bridges, schools &amp; communities all across NY state. https://t.co/DQ8qS2IMvR

Excited to get to work on @VetAffairsDems and @HouseAgDems Committees and bring the voices of NY-22 farmers and veterans to Congress. https://t.co/dNu6jnWKKK
RT @HouseAgDems: Welcome to the House Ag team, Congressman! https://t.co/Wzn4agZCFA
I‚Äôm setting up 2 advisory councils made up of folks from NY-22 who can help guide my work in Congress. I will meet regularly with our Vets &amp; our Ag Advisory Councils to hear directly from those on the frontlines about the challenges they face and the work that needs to be done.
On the @VetAffairsDems committee, I will work every day to meet the needs of our veterans and ensure the VA has the tools and resources it needs to give veterans the best possible care. https://t.co/cFDeASKFmK
The NY-22 dairy industry supports nearly 4,000 direct jobs, more than $235 million in wages, and generates an economic impact of $1.83 billion. On the @HouseAgDems Committee, I‚Äôll make sure our dairy farmers have the support and resources they need to thrive.
Excited to stand with NY-22 veterans and farmers today to announce that I will serve on the @VetAffairsDems and @HouseAgDems Committees. https://t.co/dUSx09t8eO
Our mistake. Today‚Äôs news conference at Smith Post in Rome announcing appointment to @HouseAgDems @VetAffairsDems committees.

Our thoughts are with the families of the four Americans whose lives were tragically taken during the attack in Syria. We mourn our country‚Äôs loss and thank our service members and their families for their service and sacrifice.
We have to get the government up and running and have serious discussions about border security. As long as the government is closed, our security, safety and economy are at risk. https://t.co/sWvBn8khwF

FDA listened to our concerns &amp; will restart food safety inspections for high-risk foods; however, employees won't be paid &amp; some inspections still won't happen. This is an important step but not a real solution. Let's work together &amp; end the shutdown now. https://t.co/RtR5AvM2cX
Tune in tonight. https://t.co/Pm4CE0U8SJ
We need food inspectors back on the job. The House passed bipartisan legislation to reopen USDA and FDA - time for the Senate to do the same. Read more from @RomeSentinel ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/0U7IL4rKQM
Stopping routine inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables and other foods puts us all at risk. This shutdown has real consequences for everyday people and has gone on long enough. We need to end this shutdown now. https://t.co/Qrn7RxV6F7
This investment will not only bring good-paying jobs to our region, it also puts the Southern Tier at the forefront of a brand-new industry. This is exactly the innovative, forward-thinking action we need to grow our economy &amp; create opportunity for people in the Southern Tier. https://t.co/avBQl7alPO
This shutdown has real consequences for everyday people. Families shouldn‚Äôt have to worry if the food they‚Äôre eating is safe, and farmers shouldn‚Äôt have to worry that government dysfunction could threaten their livelihood. https://t.co/JE6RwOzdbD
Stopping routine food safety inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables and other foods at high risk of contamination because of the federal government‚Äôs shutdown is a recipe for disaster. Mitch McConnell should bring the bill to reopen USDA and FDA to the Senate floor now. https://t.co/WRUkG3ZYsK
Stopping routine food safety inspections because of the govt shutdown is a recipe for disaster. We need to get USDA and FDA employees back to work. The House passed a bipartisan bill last week to reopen these agencies. Mitch McConnell needs to bring it to the Senate floor now.
FDA SHUTDOWN: Bad food on store shelves here at home would be a recipe for disaster and something we need to fix ASAP. More later this morning.
I will hold a town hall each month, visiting every county in #NY22 in 2019. First stop: Binghamton on Tuesday, January 22. See you there! https://t.co/JuVPWiyM8T
It's time for Congress to do its job. That means listening to YOU and working hard to solve problems. I will hold town halls in every county in the district and fight for commonsense solutions like #NoBudgetNoPay to hold Congress accountable. https://t.co/h7mGwAD3bc
Today the House passed a bipartisan bill to help combat anti-Semitism. We must continue to unite around actions that put an end to hatred and violence targeting Jewish communities here and around the world.
Looking forward to our first of many #NY22 town halls! See you Tuesday, January 22nd at American Legion Post 1645 in Binghamton. https://t.co/aYJrXbJRpG
Great to see @MVCC_UticaRome &amp; @CyberHawk_Jake on Capitol Hill today showcasing their cutting-edge cybersecurity education work! MVCC plays a vital role in ensuring we have the cybersecurity instructors we need to advance innovation &amp; keep our country safe. https://t.co/jzgPTmZTuN
I voted to reopen @US_FDA because everyday Americans shouldn‚Äôt have to worry if their food is safe to eat. This shutdown has real consequences. It‚Äôs time for it to end.
Just voted to reopen agencies that help ensure everyday people have affordable housing, safe roads, &amp; reliable transportation. Read more: https://t.co/Nn4pe6XKbg

It's simple: if members of Congress don't do their jobs, they shouldn't get paid. #NoBudgetNoPay https://t.co/psuAKquiYg

Today I voted to reopen important agencies including the IRS. Washington‚Äôs dysfunction shouldn‚Äôt stop people from getting their tax refunds on time. https://t.co/Pn8CMZE3s6
We can't go back to when insurers could deny coverage or raise costs for people w/ pre-existing conditions. Time to stop the partisan games &amp; find solutions to protect those w/pre-existing conditions, lower RX prices &amp; ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care
Today is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Thank you to all the men and women who put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/5TfPKdxXA4
We just passed bipartisan legislation in the House to reopen the govt &amp; hopefully the President‚Äôs message tonight will spur Mitch McConnell to bring this same legislation to the Senate so we can address comprehensive border security and immigration reform in a functioning govt.
The President‚Äôs address to the nation underscores my main hope: to end this needless shutdown before it does lasting damage.
Each month, I will hold a town hall in #NY22 because listening to you is my top priority. Excited to kick things off in Binghamton on Tuesday, January 22 at 6pm at American Legion Post 1645 (39 Louisa St, Binghamton). Hope to see you there! https://t.co/Ws1LCi4o6I
Today I cosponsored the No Budget No Pay Act because if members of Congress can't do their jobs and pass a budget, they shouldn't get paid. https://t.co/hOZUOzcdHV
This government shutdown isn‚Äôt good for anyone. That‚Äôs why, until the President can signal to Mitch McConnell what to bring to the floor of the Senate and pass, I will be pushing to open various agencies that YOU depend on every day. We should be able to do that much.
My main focus: get things done for the people of Upstate New York. https://t.co/wsefvqvDVp
