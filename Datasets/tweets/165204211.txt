One other thing: Liddell says he thinks he's made progress in preventing Trump's aides from circumventing the policy process. Others in the White House are skeptical.
Still, some in the White House were annoyed that Liddell was in his native New Zealand during the fallout from Trump's flawed family separation executive order
But Liddell sees himself as a manager, not an advocate. And he acknowledges he's not a policy expert.		‚ÄúMy argument is that‚Äôs actually a strength, not a weakness,‚Äù Liddell said in an interview last week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essential that I don‚Äôt bring personal bias to the role."
Liddell‚Äôs critics believe Trump needs an empowered policy coordinator who has deep knowledge of the issues, influence with the president and enough sway to push back on bad ideas.

As a DO alum, there‚Äôs a lot to be proud of, but I‚Äôm particularly proud of the newspaper‚Äôs professional and aggressive coverage over the last week.
Instead, Syverud‚Äôs communications team tried to control the interview, requesting that the DO send questions in advance. When the DO reporter strayed from the list of pre-approved questions, Syverud‚Äôs team ended the interview early.
The least Syverud can do is sit down for a wide-ranging interview with the DO to answer questions from student journalists. SU students spend a lot of money on tuition and the DO represents them.
The DO‚Äôs reporting lead to nationwide coverage and fierce protests on SU‚Äôs campus.
The DO obtained and posted a video of Theta Tau members participating in a racist and anti-semitic skit, prompting the expulsion of the fraternity and the suspension of 18 members of the frat.

Anything is possible with Trump, of course. But it's worth pausing a moment and remembering that Pruitt himself has been pushing the idea of him becoming AG. Pruitt has even mused to friends that he wants to be president someday.
But there's a big difference between wanting the job and actually getting it. Pruitt is seen in the White House as a self-promoter and senior aides are unhappy with his lavish spending and insistence on flying first class.

Either option would be the lowest cap on refugees in decades

A couple things to keep in mind: This is largely a symbolic statement. Under UN rules, Trump can't pull out until 2020.

Our goal is to make this database as close to comprehensive as possible. And we hope other journalists use it too. We want to collaborate.
We tried to be transparent about what we don't know (see methodology). Our data are limited because we can't know everybody Trump talks to.
Expect more updates and features in the coming days and weeks, including new ways to search and comb through the data.
