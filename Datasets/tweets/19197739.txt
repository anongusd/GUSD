@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller You are punishing the federal workers because you want a wall? ... there are far greater problems and better strategies to deal with this funding thing ... but you remain FIXATED on the wall! Trump twitters  while America burns!!!!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @GOP They are heart breaking anecdotal stories but so are the stories of soldiers who die because of your negligence! And refugee children dying while in your custody! And 800,000 federal employees working without pay because of your shutdown!

@D_Rial_7M1 @PattyMurray Illegals are not the biggest problem... Drugs are and most of the drugs are coming through ports if entry!

@BobbieTravis11 @DHipgecko @nancydchurchill @PattyMurray The rush is coming through ports of entry... The 5 billion for security would be best spent there!
@nancydchurchill @PattyMurray The wall might be nice but there are better projects to spend 5 billion of our  money on... The ones we have now are working. Not 100% effective but no wall will be... Ports of entry are the most vulnerable and need more funding.

@wilbur_may @GovMikeHuckabee @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Unfortunately we don‚Äôt  need more evidence that he‚Äôs unhinged... he tweets it out every day or rants at the rallies  he seems to enjoy so much.  Wish he would just play more golf...
@Fr8mover @GovMikeHuckabee @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Unfortunately your memory must be failing... I‚Äôm 72 and this president‚Äôs administration is unprecedented for sure but not for his being ‚Äúpresidential.‚Äù Bragging about his accomplishments are just that, ‚Äúboasts‚Äù... and not verifiable.
@GovMikeHuckabee @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews When you defend and enable a certifiable unstable ‚Äúgenius‚Äù it‚Äôs difficult to understand why we should believe you...
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs your daughter!!! She‚Äôs the only one who cares that you have dementia and is afraid to tell you.
@GovMikeHuckabee Sessions may not be your favorite but if being too nice is a fault... perhaps you should hang him from a cross!

@LizOwenLA @SenSchumer The Republicans have the votes... that‚Äôs why they are in a hurry.
@ChuckGrassley Seriously? A president is unhinged and Congress does nothing? Now they are going to elect a Supreme Court Justice who doesn‚Äôt believe in investigating a sitting president? The country is in trouble and anyone who disagrees with him is ‚Äúdisloyal.‚Äù Was this the Republican strategy?
@senrobportman You‚Äôre still there?
@mike_pence You may be painted with the same brush if you keep defending a known liar... or don‚Äôt you care?... whether it‚Äôs Alzheimer‚Äôs or not ... this president is not playing with a full deck... and it scares the bejesus out of a majority of the population.
@WalshFreedom @Nike @Kaepernick7 You might want to talk with Kaepernick before you claim to know his heart... former Marine Nate Boyer did.
@teresatorchia @ee61star My father(now deceased) said lots of things I disagreed with but doing the right thing and showing respect for a hero was a priority. Perhaps she knows her Dad is suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs. His behavior seems to indicate he has some kind of mental decline... Paranoia is common!
@RealJamesWoods This was in May?
@diannebdee @IvankaTrump @SenJohnMcCain Perhaps they aren‚Äôt as loyal as Donald would like!!!
@BrownAlbie608 Maybe they don‚Äôt!
@2belinda Perhaps paying their respects for a real hero is their only way to apologize for Donald‚Äôs past remarks... no one can shut him up but showing ‚Äútheir‚Äù respect is a good start.
@SicTransit34 @peterbakernyt @ktumulty @IvankaTrump I think they must recognize that Donald is becoming unglued. Paying respect to an American hero is the least they could do.
@DeborahVolpe2 @HallieJackson @IvankaTrump @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Donald was banned because he can‚Äôt keep his mouth shut... the Kushners were respectful and knew that honoring McCain was a good thing.

@FrankByrne10 @anita_7756 @WalshFreedom MLK Jr. envisioned a world where global brotherhood and sisterhood were not a dream but the state of humankind.
@GizenZirin @WalshFreedom True but most people have no knowledge of the history other than a romanticized version and that's not on the statue.
@Freebirdwraps @WalshFreedom @cbslocal The statues R accompanied by very little "history" beyond names &amp; dates..but UR right reading history would probably change people's minds.
@Blotgo @WalshFreedom Donald &amp; birther movement might have been detonator. The fuse burned for 8 years &amp; set off the "bomb" which blew up on Trump's election!
@JKirking @WalshFreedom Too late! That happened when those statues were erected in the first place with no explanation of their real role in history.
@USAmericaFirst @WalshFreedom I'll bet that most Americans only know myth associated with these men not the real history. They should be accompanied by a detailed history
@ThomasWiederhol @WalshFreedom @cbslocal As long as there is a plaque with a detailed explanation and not the myth most of us were taught but should really be in a museum!
@debele1901 @WalshFreedom Except that many Americans were taught a "romanticized"version of history! Some of us are just beginning to realize that!
@Blotgo @WalshFreedom Should definitely be placed in a museum with a more detailed explanation of their place in history!!!
@WalshFreedom Pigeons would miss them...and it's not "erasing" history because most people R unaware or were taught a version of history that was slanted!
