@cattleprod @SecOfChampagne I seriously dont understand how this is so accurate. I mean, it is accurate. Still baffled.
@dancanon @SecOfChampagne They really think we‚Äôre at work? ü§ì
@SecOfChampagne Forgot to hit send? üò≥
@nick__do I agree. 	The whole argument over text is a semantics argument that began when I challenged the premise of Medicare for all not actually being Medicare. (That kicked the ‚Äúhere are details‚Äù hornet‚Äôs nest.)	But totally fair and appropriate for all to plant their principle flags.
@choppadoo I agree! So why are Socialist Democrats  drawing a line in the sand over one proposal? There‚Äôs only one group of purists who aren‚Äôt willing to listen to other ways of redistributing $3.2 trillion.
@choppadoo No. That it‚Äôs as ridiculous as saying their views on healthcare are in any way similar. 	But you were trying to make a point.
@choppadoo Compelling point. Probably the same on the Space Force.
@choppadoo I also put my name on my Twitter... Sparrow? Nesting? 		And, as of today, the widespread support you refer to wouldn‚Äôt even be half the number of votes required to pass the House, much less the Senate, much less become law and provide affordable, universal coverage.
@nick__do Fair point. It's just funny that the people who have drawn a line in the sand and assert a no-compromise position don't have the specifics of the bill. Because, generally speaking, we're most likely going to agree on a vast majority of things.
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth What... the same team part? 	Or that you're from California and not even a KY-3 constituent?
@GOPJake @dsa_louisville Probably more fun than watching the Michael Cohen hearings.
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth Cool. She's on the Budget Committee (which he chairs), so I'm sure they're both working with THE SAME committee TEAM. 	Maybe he and others just want to see any number of proposals that would achieve the same goal of universal healthcare. While also reorganizing $3.2 trillion.
@cpirman12 @thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation only took 719 words. üòÇ
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth It feels a little weird because I can't find text on it anywhere, between https://t.co/4HoTrhTbpM and Google, it's a little odd to not be able to find it. (And that article only talks about the 120 pages and last year's bill, but it doesn't provide anything on this one.)
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth There's NO DRAFT. There's no legislation. 		I don't disagree with you that Congress doesn't even read most bills it votes on, much less cosponsor proposals without text... but what I'm saying is that you don't know what you're arguing on behalf of...
I just want to retweet this for (AMAZING) emphasis. If you're not a Bernie bro or Socialist Democrat, the purity test for Democrats is that you sign on, cosponsor legislation that literally has no text. None. The proposed bill has a title. But that's all. https://t.co/AKHaWFs0cJ

@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth I know what he's been fighting for for 12 years in Congress... I know where he stands. So... he's got my vote.üòÇ
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Once again, I agree. But you are the one who sent those two documents. I'm just pointing out the first inconsistency, which was in the first point made.	@dsa_louisville wants it to all sound so easy, and it's not.
@brohammersdad @dsa_louisville @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth üëçüèº
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod 100%. And no, you should not be intimidated. 	So why is @dsa_louisville threatening a primary challenge to @RepJohnYarmuth... who agrees with this principle (albeit vague). 		So, like I said, go for it DSA! 11 months to file.
@brohammersdad @dsa_louisville @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth Not to mention... https://t.co/cMkFYqOimQ
@brohammersdad @dsa_louisville @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth The original story on this thread... https://t.co/IoPqtuhrqh
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Also, first point made "Universal Entitlement" says, 	"Authorizes the HHS Secretary to determine criteria of residency"		Just so you are all aware, this is the type of huge, gaping bureaucratic loophole that doesn't follow your aforementioned principles. (That's just line 1).
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Just did a quick search... literally not a single $ sign in the entire document. 		So, my first impression is it's a little lite on details.
@realscotttandy @RepJohnYarmuth @senatemajldr @MattBevin @Rand4KY Sounds as tho it was you who was triggered my good man.
@brohammersdad @dsa_louisville @cattleprod Or, single payer. Or universal healthcare. 		Oh, and by the way... @RepJohnYarmuth has advocates for and supports ending a (real) plan "that actually frees people from the agony of private, employer based health insurance..."
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod And just because it's commonly accepted in your bubble, doesn't mean it's commonly accepted. Also, I'm not for shorthand when it comes to overhauling a $3.2 trillion/year sector of the economy. I'm for overhaul, and for details...
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Pedantic as in there isn't a single $ sign on @dsa_louisville's favorite chart. And it's not pedantic to mislead people into thinking something is Medicare when it's not. I'd like to win the debate on the merits, not piggybacking on a popular healthcare program.
@dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Sweet chart. Very helpful... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @dsa_louisville Also, these two lines in your tweet contradict one another... "when it's clear you don't [know what Medicare is]. You are right about one thing- Medicare for All is not Medicare."
@ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @dsa_louisville You know what you call Medicare for All. What other refer to as Medicare for All is allowing anyone to buy into Medicare, regardless of age. 	My only point (which you acknowledge I'm right on) is that calling something Medicare for All has nothing to do with Medicare.
@dsa_louisville @brohammersdad @cattleprod Once you demonstrate that you understand what Medicare for All actually means, then your demand will have more credibility.	You're talking about platinum single-payer.
@dsa_louisville @brohammersdad @cattleprod Your list of principles shows you don't even understand what Medicare is. 	Medicare does not provide free, equal access to all medical services and treatments. 	All services are not fully covered. You don't just get to pick any doctor you want.
@brohammersdad @cattleprod @dsa_louisville And as your list includes "federal legislation like Bernie Sanders‚Äô Medicare for All Act of 2017," understand that Bern's "Medicare for All" is NOT Medicare for All... it's a catchy title that bears no similarity to Medicare.	https://t.co/yjVTtpfcRR
@brohammersdad @cattleprod @dsa_louisville OK, but while you mean to be "something extremely specific," when overhauling a $3.2 trillion sector of the economy, it's very unspecific. This is a list of specific principles.
RT @cattleprod: @yarmuth @dsa_louisville A lot of elected leaders don't even have the guts to have a conversation about health care, let al‚Ä¶
@cattleprod @dsa_louisville The truly frustrating and scary part is that a lot of elected leaders use them interchangeably.
@cattleprod Yep. I can't speak to the wealth part, but, my only suggestion to progressives, @dsa_louisville and supporters of universal healthcare is to understand that many people use "Medicare for All" when they really mean "universal healthcare." They are not the same.
Maybe Louisville's Socialist Democrats should read the story... which (while not exactly correct) explains @RepJohnYarmuth has been a cosponsor of Medicare for All legislation for every year since he was first elected.

@meshor01 @MurphyCartoons @Topgolf @courierjournal Granted I knew when moving in downtown what I was getting into... 		Well, I guess kind of like those who moved in next to Oxmoor Mall.
@meshor01 @MurphyCartoons @Topgolf @courierjournal They put the YUM! Center and Wateefront Park outside of my condo, where I lived for the last dozen years. It‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs good for the city.

@MurphyCartoons @Topgolf @courierjournal The ridiculous outrage over issues facing modern society has finally taken its toll.
@rbaron321 That's very interesting... And home values are obviously a legitimate concern for people to have. May be an unreasonable expectation or reality, but I certainly don't fault anyone for being concerned.
Have to applaud @VickieYGlisson. A campaign "abuzz with energetic pessimism" is quite a feat.		"We're not resting	We're not snoozing	We're pumped up	'Cause we're losing!"	üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ https://t.co/KirMFwmh2y
And the same goes for the lights... How bright would it have to be to bother the neighborhood that doesn‚Äôt (already) face Oxmoor mall? 		Topgolfers would have to wear sunglasses all night... 		It‚Äôs just not a realistic problem residents will have to worry about or contend with.
I drove through some of the Hurstbourne neighborhood over the weekend, and it occurred to me... 		Seeing how far away some of the ‚Äúwe oppose Topgolf‚Äù signs were from Oxmoor mall, how LOUD do residents think it has to be to disturb them? Topgolf visitors would have hearing damage! https://t.co/Ns4TbapLyd

@dabearsman51 @DavidIainSmith @dnlevans128 @JustinThomas34 Again, I don‚Äôt care... 	And, people choose to watch golf, too. 		I‚Äôm just pointing out it was an ironic criticism given you own profile. But if a golfer celebrating with a ‚Äú$&amp;@# yeah!‚Äù got you yesterday... guess I can‚Äôt argue. Your right to be offended on behalf of the kids.
@ForwardKy Chances are this will not lead to anything, good or bad. Doesn‚Äôt make it a good idea. 	In fact, it‚Äôs definitely a bad idea. But, hoping for the best (which is nothing).
@RyanInAuburn @wduce22 @LegoMyFrego @DCooney64 @JustinThomas34 True.
@RyanInAuburn @wduce22 @LegoMyFrego @DCooney64 @JustinThomas34 Not to mention, drunk fans get kicked out of games in all those sports regularly.
@RyanInAuburn @wduce22 @LegoMyFrego @DCooney64 @JustinThomas34 Again, Ryder Cup is an exhibition. 	And in all other sports you can play defense... not in golf. 	My boys and I have music going at all times on the course, but tournament golf is different... Common courtesy for all competitors.
@dabearsman51 @DavidIainSmith @dnlevans128 @JustinThomas34 Just hard to believe someone would be offended by language who highlights making the dollar menu his bitch. 	Again, I‚Äôm not offended by either.
@TIHLIF @SandraMesrine @JustinThomas34 A fine.
@wduce22 @RyanInAuburn @LegoMyFrego @DCooney64 @JustinThomas34 Yeah, an exhibition, hit where these guys are making heir living. There‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of dollars between first and second... that‚Äôs one shot.

@TishMoscow @RepJohnYarmuth No, I‚Äôd like for you to realize I‚Äôve answered your questions. 	You just don‚Äôt like the answer. 		Isn‚Äôt your question about answering questions? 	Try calling his office, writing a letter or email.		Or just continue to Twitter attack. Whatever you like...
@TishMoscow @RepJohnYarmuth Nobody said it was bantering. I said not everyone on social media is a constituent. 		And if you want to get technical about it, he‚Äôs been answering questions daily while in office for over 4,000 days. That doesn‚Äôt include the months of campaigning before he was first elected.
@TishMoscow No to the other part while we‚Äôre at it. He‚Äôs answered to his 700,000+ constituents 5 times, and they like what he has to say and what he stands for...		Also, answering on social media is probable tough, given it‚Äôs a place for non constituents, Russians and whatnot.
@TishMoscow No, I‚Äôm not on the federal payroll... which is public record, so you can look it up instead of throwing nonsense onto Twitter.
@TishMoscow @RepJohnYarmuth Nope.

@CryptonomicsPro @OriginalKuiper @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth If someone told you that, after 70 years, people you‚Äôve never met are questioning your citizenship... sometimes all you can do is laugh at the ridiculousness.
@CryptonomicsPro @OriginalKuiper @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth So you are asking me now? 	I told you that yesterday. No, he is not. We actually had a good laugh about it at dinner last night.
@OriginalKuiper (... Far from your representative.)
@OriginalKuiper @CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth Says the person from Alaska.
@CARDSALLDAY26 Nah. I‚Äôm speaking up for facts. 	He‚Äôs been speaking on his own behalf to the tune of 4 reelections... he‚Äôs just fine.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth And that‚Äôs not an opinion to disagree with. That‚Äôs a fact... republicans defunding that subsidy is what drove costs up... that‚Äôs the economics of it. Insurance executives have said as much.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth You mean come up with a regulation? I agree entirely... hospitals should be audited. Until we know the true cost of care, we can‚Äôt truly know what compensation rates should be.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth And I agree costs are too high... I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs because Republicans defunded the mechanism designed to keep costs down.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth That‚Äôs not what those subsidies were. Cost sharing reduction subsidies would have kept down the cost of insurance. 	Not to mention it was quality insurance. 		And expanded Medicaid was coverage. That‚Äôs what Medicaid is... insurance for those who truly can‚Äôt afford it.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth And yes... it did. Those are statistical facts.
@MeganImel @RepJohnYarmuth That‚Äôs because Republicans defunded the subsidies that would have kept the cost of plans down for everyone. 	They were called cost sharing reductions.
@mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth 480,000 Kentuckians have healthcare because of his work on the Affordable Care Act... Obamacare.	In fact, cut Kentucky‚Äôs uninsured rate in half. 	...that‚Äôs a way.
@RussSalsman1 @RepJohnYarmuth Honestly still surprised there is this underground antisemitism being stirred up around the country. Or at whatever is fueling this hyper-focus on American Jews... 	I understand it‚Äôs my own naivety, but still confounding... and saddening.

@CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth Probably because he never would imagine there‚Äôs a conspiracy theory about his citizenship...	Since you‚Äôre so interested in our family history... his father was a decorated WWII veteran and POW. One might say he‚Äôs from a good ol‚Äô all-American family.
@CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth Wow. A conspiracy blog that doesn‚Äôt list a single name or author of its posts, doesn‚Äôt provide any information of it‚Äôs board, leadership or funders... 	I don‚Äôt mean this as an insult, but you‚Äôve been suckered. 	And, advice: Don‚Äôt trust everything you see online.
@CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth Somehow I don‚Äôt trust that you‚Äôd believe whatever his answer would be.
@MeganImel @RepJohnYarmuth Well, one thing would be donating every penny of his salary for the last 11 years to  local charities.
@CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth That‚Äôs probably because he doesn‚Äôt have dual citizenship... I would know.

@cdbradley2 And you're conflating health insurance with car insurance! One is 1/6 of entire economy and something everyone needs. The other is a car...!
@cdbradley2 Dude, you said that's not how any other health insurance works. It's quite obvious that, yes, they all work that way...
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 This is a very simple concept.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Yes! If you are paying for car insurance and never use it... you are participating in a system to help cover the costs and risks of others.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Not to mention... car insurance is a horrible comparison because there is no similarity between cars and people, or cars and healthcare.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 If you are never in a car wreck (a healthy person), your car insurance helps other people pay for their car insurance when they need it.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Here's a car insurance analogy to Sarah's original statement... you might understand:
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Really not sure how you can acknowledge the ways in which health insurance is based on risk, and then say it's not how it works...
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Oh, and where you live... also a determining factor (based on risk).
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 https://t.co/5rRUdkvVzp	Preexisting conditions thanks to the ACA only means you can't be denied or charged more for essential benefits.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Thats not what preexisting conditions means. The higher risk model still stands. Smokers still pay more, as you age your rates increase, etc
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 I agree. üôÑ https://t.co/53aqKHlmSj
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 The mythical solution republicans like to talk about... "high risk pools" which don't work... it's all about risk.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 You're joking, right? That's all insurance companies look at... risk. Do you smoke? You're a higher risk, you pay more.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Actually, that's exactly how insurance works. It's  the fundamental model of insurance industry. Shared costs makes it affordable for all.

@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes Oh, and hospitals (especially rural) now provide more services because they finally are compensated for care, instead of care for uninsured
@CardChronicle Hahahahaha
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes But there is a lot more that can be done to curb costs. Like better understanding true hospital costs of services.
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes It did some with costs as well... reimbursements were based on better outcomes rather than unnecessary procedures. https://t.co/om38ZQkuIr
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes Hence.... the need for risk corridors. The ACA foresaw that problem, republicans in congress defunded it, and Americans paid for it.
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes And it wasn't as much people not buying into plan as disproportionately sick people buying in, which overburdened insurance companies...
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes Ah, ok. Yes I misread. But that is still the CSR's I said you were talking about earlier. 	What I'm talking about are risk corridors.
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes 2) This is a story about a lawsuit from 2014. Insurance companies have been shorted for 3 years, and raising prices on people as a result.
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes 1) Thank you Mike, that is my point! Insurance companies have had to raise cost because Republicans decided not to pay.
@TyUnderIce @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr America spends almost $10,000 per person per year on health care. Can you afford that? Insurance is the way to make healthcare affordable
@micomazuma @angeil @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr Penalty is because you're already in the system. If you get sick tomorrow, everyone else picks up the tab, and you do the same for others.

@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr My "source" is telling me you might be thinking of CSR (cost sharing reductions) which helps lower income pay for deductibles and copays.
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr Actually, republicans made it so that the government could only pay a portion of what was owed. Which was a fraction https://t.co/7jY7jmX8Or
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr They're called "risk corridors," and under republican control of congress, the appropriations for them were defunded.
@micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 3) GOP defunded that support, which quite literally passed the burden onto those in the individual marketplace.
@micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 2) impact of influx of new people into market. People who were disproportionately sick. That influx drove up costs.
@micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 1) It's not Medicaid I'm talking about. The individual marketplace was supported with subsidies to insurance companies to brace for the
@micomazuma @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr That's exactly what I'm saying. Since the ACA, Republicans took control of congress and defunded the mechanism to help insurance  increases.
@MssAnthrope @micomazuma @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr I'm not. I'm in Kentucky... which is the national model for how expanded Medicaid and ACA should be implemented.
@micomazuma @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr I understand it's expensive. My only point is that blaming Obamacare is misplaced. ACA would have kept costs down, but for GOP sabotaging it
@micomazuma @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 2 things: 1) ACA was partially created to provide freedom to be self employed an not have to worry about insurance thru employer. And 2)...
@LikesScaryStuff @micomazuma @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 100% the ACA had support mechanisms to keep premiums down. Republicans eliminated that funding, then blamed Obamacare for rising costs.

@EnPerpetuity @ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP I had a good source... or teacher. üòâ It's remarkably complicated.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP It's everyone sharing in the system that lowers the cost for everyone. Nobody can pay for their own cancer treatments on an as-need basis.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Elwood, this is how insurance works. I'm 33yrs old and healthy. I don't plan on getting sick, but I share in the system in case it happens.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP That's not how insurance works. For insurance to work, everyone shares in the risk.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Cool. Good luck Elwood!
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Insurance companies decided it's not worth it to them to come into a market, which might have disproportionately high number of sick.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP ...that's the deal... And, problem with free market is the market is too small. People either on Medicaid/Care or on employer plan.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Nothing is stopping insurance companies from offering coverage in KY. And I shouldn't have to pay for a lot of things, but I live in America
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP I don't know where local is, but Obamacare has saved rural hospitals thanks to Medicaid actually reimbursing them for their care.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Also, thanks to Obamacare, ALL insurance plans are GOOD plans. Unlike before when insurance companies could sell truly junk plans for cheap.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Did you look into the subsidies to help you pay for it?
Since 2013, the uninsured rate in KY has seen largest drop in U.S. From 20.4% to 7.8%, and saved rural hospitals. Thanks again #Obamacare https://t.co/KVRhZFiV61

@GovMattBevin Stop misleading people on #KentuckyHEALTH (with tweets!), admit you were wrong and do your job to help the people of Kentucky.
@GovMattBevin At this point, the source of your misleading quote has as much authority on the ACA as any private attorney.
@GovMattBevin Further, you're intentionally misleading people, presenting this person as someone who IS part of HHS, when he is clearly not.
@GovMattBevin He's an attorney who worked for the BUSH Administration. He was at major DC law firm by the time ACA/Obamacare even written!
@GovMattBevin Serious leaders confront real issues like adults (@RepJohnYarmuth letter on your desk). You tweet. Get serious #KYTrump.

@KENTUCKYProud2 actually not a Hillary fan. Wrote about that over a year ago. (And, no, was not a Bernie Bro either.)
@RaeHodge apologies. I do want to give you the credit you deserve. You are beyond "qualified." I should have said "best," in previous tweet
@wdcc4falcons meaning he and/or his followers have already gamed the system (which I've admitted many times needs fixing).
@wdcc4falcons No, we can safely assume that his votes are not a reflection of our readers when he received votes in literally every category
@RaeHodge Is that "screencap" on Twitter "cheating?" Or is that something new editors need to learn?
@RaeHodge "Journo" conversations are welcome. But I don't think you are qualified to speak to @leoweekly's role in Louisville from the U.K. https://t.co/630iLQCa1L
Not to mention our paper is free. But thank you for the business tip.
@wdcc4falcons that's not at all what I've said or suggested anywhere, and to suggest that is totally disingenuous and, well ... not smart.
@Hizootiemizark you're always free to contact us. We'll consider any inquiries/suggestions, as we have in the past.
@kingave66 It's an imperfect system we're always trying to improve. Never have we had to vet for obscenity-something we won't associate with
@hgod88 No, our best local comedian someone who performs, preferably in local clubs. But it's his obscene videos that are not comedy.
@Hizootiemizark 1st amendment protects speech from government, nothing else. Also, exceptions made for obscenity, which how work clearly is.
@KENTUCKYProud2 Thanks, but those individuals didn't win an award. Plus picture above is not of waist up, and the "banter" was in workplace
@TimSchooler1 @phillipmbailey Agree. We're continually refining the process, which is not perfect. We now realize it's a more immediate need
@phillipmbailey I must have misplaced the liberal standards handbook. The problem is not being offensive, but obscene, which he clearly is.
@phillipmbailey Our "alt principles" no different from human principles: obscene assaults on women and minorities not worthy of recognition.
