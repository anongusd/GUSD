@HillaryClinton @politico The definition of insanity...
@RepAdamSchiff How about this? Nobody cares about anything you have to say. Better see a doctor for the leak problem of yours.
@BillOReilly I'm afraid of Corgis because I think they might be smarter than me.
@DailyCaller She tries so hard to sound so thoughtful and intelligent, hedging her bets with every sentence. Dumb as a rock and has no clue what is worse than what. All she knows is that everything is racist somehow.
@SenGillibrand Maybe don't be sexist and fight for a country that values and respects all citizens? Just sayin'..
@abc7newsbayarea My eyes just rolled out of my eye sockets.
@CoryBooker Wrong. If everyone should resign because of an allegation, I would allege that you are destroying America with your bigotry and you'd have to resign. Don't you care about the presumption of innocence or waiting until all the facts are in? You will not be POTUS.
@StoopidTallKid @maziehirono Senator Hirano - You can do better than this and stop embarrassing those of us who live in Hawai`i. Look back at your oath of office and remember this is a constitutional republic and you are supposed to be the best of the best. Clearly, you are not.
@StoopidTallKid @maziehirono If it's true, and you have a conscience, own it and resign. If it's not true, you should defend yourself. So, back to Senator Hirano's statement that he should immediately resign because of an allegation - not how things work.
@StoopidTallKid @maziehirono btw, I'm pretty far to the right and I'm not defending a Democrat. I'm defending the Constitutional rights of a lieutenant governor I do not support and would never vote for. It's that simple. You shouldn't have to resign because of an allegation.
@StoopidTallKid @maziehirono Nice try, but try to stay on topic. Anybody can google statistics on anything and prove their point. Rape statistics and potential political hit jobs are two different topics.
@StoopidTallKid @maziehirono False accusations are rare? Really? Pay attention!
@maziehirono Your bi-partisan stance is noted, but if everybody just quits their job every time there is an allegation, that is a presumption of guilt.		In America, there is a presumption of innocence and you shouldn't ave to be reminded of this. You're in Congress, for crying out loud.
@nowthisnews @AOC Most are good people looking for a better life, but it would make more sense to do our best to prevent criminals, gangs, and drugs from crossing the border. Obviously.		Abolishing ICE is a stupid idea. Obviously.		Victim of Illegal Aliens Memorial	https://t.co/prI0gUouc9
@AOC Nice try, but it's still legal to tell jokes in America so far. The GND is pretty funny, too, so I believe you know funny.
@the__dude1 @NYCMayor @AOC @sunrisemvmt Oh, well if she said so. She knows better than us, I'm sure.
@NYCMayor @AOC @sunrisemvmt Our planet is on the brink. Existential threat. https://t.co/aa9B8dPgz7
@realDonaldTrump DeClas
@SenMarkey Which major corporations are paying you to do this? Stop with the ridiculous power grab and go do your job.
@JoeBiden I respectfully disagree.
@SebGorka @SpeakerPelosi Grinding her teeth because she hates America
@greta To them it's a game. It's Theater. They think perception is more important than facts. Americans are not as dumb and gullible as they wish we would be. They will not win the game.
@MarkDice @Kevin_Shipp I agree Mark is not himself today.
@AOC A vast majority of Americans are not obsessed with race or racism like you are. We don't see you as "brown". We see an "Honorable" Congresswoman who lacks restraint and discretion. We should be able to let our kids watch elected representatives speak in public. You can do better.
@rezaaslan The little beast Reza Aslan is a scholar of what, exactly? Evil! Your words, not mine.
@AlanCorona @BernieSanders And for good measure.		https://t.co/7yQ6wIkQW4

@BernieSanders Socialism leaves nothing but death and destruction and destroys the lives of those you pretend to support. Go away, Mr. Sanders.
@SebGorka @BillKristol He will probably deny, deny, deny or ignore, ignore, ignore because that is what dishonest journalists do with their freedom of speech.
@secupp Moving forward, exercise the freedom of the press and do it with honesty and dignity. It took me three hours to look into it and find the video of the entire event and realize the narrative was more important to your editors than the truth. It shouldn't have taken you this long.
@kathygriffin If you truly care, find the entire 2 hour video that shows everything and watch it. Then you'll have enough information to form an opinion.
@campusreform Reparations for parents who did not send their children to Notre Dame to make them dumber?
@brithume It's going to be easy to find a college for my grandchildren to attend. The list of institutions not run by PC terrorists will be very short. Make no mistake, PC overload is bullying committed by people who claim to be anti-bullying.
@JimCarrey Overactor! I love that you are paying attention and are speaking your mind. You're not convincing anybody of anything and it would be nice to see less incessant negativity. You're driving yourself crazy with hate and that is no way to live. I hope you find yourself again soon.
@Alyssa_Milano Adults think first and do their own research.		https://t.co/SMjvTusEmY
@Ocasio2018 While you are linking to biased sources that you agree with, the rest of us are aware of actual facts. I did my own research and did my best to explain. I would urge members of Congress to stop being Twitter trolls and talk to each other and resolve this!		https://t.co/Lwj1v0xytc

@BillKristol @jmartNYT Duty and Honor are alive and well. Where do you get these random flashes of stupidity? Those who know the meaning of the words Duty and Honor also know the meaning of sedition - conduct or speech inciting people to rebel against the authority of a state or monarch. You are lost.
@BillKristol You are paid by dishonest bigots to find the negative in everything he does and when it's not negative, you do your best to make it sound negative. You have the right to remain silent. Oh. Also, you suck at your job.

@JohnBrennan We're on the floor laughing at you. You've lost your mind. You want to talk about treason, let's talk about treason. Public debate. You and me.
