@wannabefarmer19 @RizzoMandy To our knowledge, sugarcane isn't grown in Hawaii anymore--think they stopped growing cane in 2016. They found coffee was more profitable.
@janie_pluenneke To our knowledge, sugarcane isn't grown in Hawaii anymore. They found coffee was more profitable.
@HoosierHayFarm @lesleyraekelly It depends on the area whether or not farmers burn. They have to follow specific guidelines when burning. Not all locations will work for that. The farmer we talked to says yield is better and harvest is more efficient when burning. Without leaves, less trash is taken to the gin.
@rbgibbfarms @CPSBrad When harvesting green, it leaves a mat of matter about 5-6 inches thick, making it near impossible to incorporate that into the soil without terminating the cane plant.
@rbgibbfarms @CPSBrad Sugarcane produces so much leaf matter that it's not feasible to leave it all in the field. It's an environment for pests and disease to flourish.
@SusanJayne17 It is taken to the mill where it is cleaned and processed.

This is what it looks like to burn a #sugarcane field. It's burned before harvest to eliminate the leaf matter.
