@xsf19705 @larabazelon @ryangrim @amyklobuchar If you think racism has increased, you need a history lesson.
@larabazelon @xsf19705 @ryangrim @amyklobuchar Is Senator Harris a racist? Also professor, I'd love to hear your insight whether the astronomically high single motherhood rate in Black communities increases the crime rates therein. Does the lack of positive adult male role models increase the crime rates among Black youth?
@larabazelon @xsf19705 @ryangrim @amyklobuchar No. I already conceded that it is wrong when a Black criminal &amp; White criminal (with identical records) are punished differently for the same crime. I would love, however, for you to explain why you attacked a Black prosecutor for being too tough on criminals.
@xsf19705 @larabazelon @ryangrim @amyklobuchar If racism is the cause, why have Black crime rates gone up as discrimination has decreased and equality has increased? Compare, for example, the Black crime rates of the 1950s to today. I'm all for fighting racism but not convinced that is the cause of this problem.

@LeaderHoyer @RepAOC @RepBarbaraLee @RepLoisFrankel @RepLawrence @BobbyScott The 80 cents on a dollar for equal work is a complete lie. It assumes that there are equal numbers of men and women across all professions. In reality, men and women choose very different professions, and men often work longer hours than women.
@headlines_see @LeaderHoyer But, instead of bitching, making excuses and playing victim, I believe men should get their sh!t together and make something of themselves.
@headlines_see @LeaderHoyer There are also numerous studies that boys and girls learn differently. The teachers, who are mostly women, teach in a way that favors girls. That's why more girls end up in college &amp; grad school &amp; more boys end up in prison.
@headlines_see @LeaderHoyer My point is that people shouldn't work middle class jobs, like education, and expect to make big money. As for "not emphasized as realistic for women" they aren't either emphasized for men. Men just choose to enter those fields.
@headlines_see @LeaderHoyer Absolutely. Many highly capable women choose middle class jobs like teaching &amp; nursing instead of computer science or engineering. Of the ones who choose high paying jobs, they are much less likely than men to put in 60-80 hour work weeks necessary to earn the most money.

@CALLMEMRTIBBSS @Marvallene @charliekirk11 The absence of fathers is important, because "children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
@CALLMEMRTIBBSS @Marvallene @charliekirk11 I'm not saying that single parenthood is a uniquely Black problem or that it is the only cause of poor educational results. Rather, single parenthood is disproportionate in Black communities.
@Marvallene @CALLMEMRTIBBSS @charliekirk11 Exactly. Corrupt bueracrats are misusing so much of the money. In addition, there is the problem of 73% of Black kids living in single mother households which negatively impacts their educational outcomes.
@JZarif Said the mouthpiece of a tyrannical, theocracy that kills homosexuals, tortures journalists, shoots peaceful demonstrators and forces women to wear hijabs.

@E_Gruberman @GStephanopoulos Lol! No difference, Cohen literally pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, which makes him a liar and a criminal. FYI, Cohen does not have a deal. He's just hoping the judge will give him a light sentence.
@E_Gruberman @GStephanopoulos Not a pivot at all. Like they're saying about Cohen, people said Manafort had a bombshell but he didn't. Your assertion that Manafort is "refusing to provide what he has" is unfounded and illogical. Why would he voluntarily enter a cooperation agreement and then withhold info?
You're deliberately omitting that he said he will receive a briefing aboard Air Force One about the Ukraine-Russia situation before making a decision on the Putin meeting; I guess it doesn't fit your Anti Trump narrative. That's why he calls you #FakeNews. https://t.co/Qf4RLV1Y9S
@E_Gruberman @GStephanopoulos Ok comrade, 		Remember 3 months ago when Manafort was supposed to provide a great deal of "investigative testimony"? 		It turned out he didn't have anything to offer.

@BurtShanks @JFNYC1 I'll be Laughing My As$ Off when Kavanaugh gets confirmed and when, in 2-4 years, Trump replaces Ginsburg with Amy Barret. In desperation, the left overplayed all of their cards, and it will come back to haunt them when Trump cements a 5-4 and then 6-3 majority on the SCOTUS.
@BuzzFeedNews For LIBTARDS racism against Whites is perfectly acceptable.
@WOM_alley @lissmith Not to interrupt your sycophantic rant, but if she has half a brain she won't work for @MartinOMalley. His failed record, lack of charisma, inability to navigate the national media, &amp; inability to get 1% in Iowa will ensure that he attracts an equally incompetent staff.
@SteveHiltonx Can you please do a Swamp Watch segment on Senator Joe Manchin. He used his political connections to make his daughter a millionaire pharmaceutical executive of a company that consistently raises drug prices and rips off consumers.....

@burnzy25 @FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @eugenegu Go back to third grade Wah Lung.
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu I didn't mention Hillary. She has no relevance to what I said.
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu Maybe you missed when Democrats  voted not to remove Bill Clinton for committing perjury and defended him from multiple rape accusations.  Republicans have been consistent. Democrats are the hypocrits.
@burnzy25 @FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @eugenegu Wah Lung screams "I AM A LOW IQ INDIVIDUAL; I DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TO AND TOO!"
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu Its called the law and constitution. Your total lack of substantive arguments and total reliance on pathetic ad hominem attacks and profanity speaks volumes about you.
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu A. Read the Constitution and go to law school, and then you'll understand what I mean. 	B. You have no idea what perjury is. Giving a vague or open ended answer happens all the time and does not meet the statutory requirements for perjury even if the answer is not complete.
@JMCSPORTSBOOK @FilmCriticOne @burnzy25 @eugenegu Democrats didn't believe cheating was a problem for JFK, LBJ, and Bill Clinton. Nor did they think the multiple rape accusations against Bill Clinton were credible. How do you apply a double standard so shamelessly?
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu Scratch that. You're a low IQ buffoon who responds to substantive arguments with profanity &amp; ad hominem attacks. Sad!
@JMCSPORTSBOOK @FilmCriticOne @burnzy25 @eugenegu Dumb logic. Cosby was convicted by a jury of 12 people who found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence. Cosby got due process.
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu The other accusers are wild allegations from politically motivated people he never even met. The FBI investigated him 6 times and none of this ever surfaced. Democrats just want to delay. Remember, its impossible to prove a negative. I hope no woman ever falsely accuses you.
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu Please name one thing Trump did to destroy the "rule of law." I am open minded, and willing to change my views on him. Please, name the things he's done to destroy the "rule of law."
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu 3. But that does not make it right for Democrats to destroy Kavanaugh's life based on vague accusation's from 36 years ago, that are uncorroborated, denied by the alleged witnesses, and don't fit with his impeccable record.
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu 2. said about Justice Thomas. You seem smart, and must realize all of this, but unfortunately you are playing the dumb Corey Booker political circus games. I can't say I blame you, however. You &amp; I probably agree that Garland was treated very unfairly by Republicans.
@FilmCriticOne @JMCSPORTSBOOK @burnzy25 @eugenegu 1. Republicans know FBI will reach an inconclusive report like they did with Justice Thomas. It's impossible to prove a negative to Ford's vague accusation. Dems are just trying to delay &amp; will say that the inconclusive FBI report does not exonerate Kavanaugh like Biden said
@JMCSPORTSBOOK @FilmCriticOne @burnzy25 @eugenegu No one shamed Dr. Ford. You can believe that Kavanaugh did'nt do it without shaming. You want to know what is shaming victims? When groups of people celebrated OJ's murder acquittal to which he later admitted while immune from prosecution. That was shaming the murdered victims.
@FilmCriticOne @burnzy25 @JMCSPORTSBOOK @eugenegu I'm good. I'll leave the conspiracy theory blogs to morons like you.
@JMCSPORTSBOOK @FilmCriticOne @burnzy25 @eugenegu You can't selectively oppose authoritarianism based on when it's politically convenient for you to do so. Part of living in a Democracy is presuming people innocent until proven guilty, including people you don't like. In a Democracy, the burden of proof must be on the accuser
@JMCSPORTSBOOK @FilmCriticOne @burnzy25 @eugenegu I'm sorry, but I vehemently object to you calling him a "sexual predator" based on one person's testimony. He has denied it, the supposed witnesses have denied it and Ford has no corroborating evidence. Dems are all against Russia &amp; so am I....
@30piecesofsilve @Kimmer4444 @jonfavs @JJohnsonLaw She's wrong. He goes down in the polls if he votes against Kavanaugh. Remember, Indiana is a very red state that Trump won by 20 points. Mike Pence was the governor of that state!
@Kimmer4444 @30piecesofsilve @jonfavs @JJohnsonLaw You're wrong. Indiana is a red state that Trump won by 20 points. Donnelly can only win reelection if he gets Republicans to vote for him, and they all want him to vote for Kavanaugh.
@JMCSPORTSBOOK @eugenegu Of course you're right, but previous presidents' trade policies crushed the industries that provided well paying jobs to Blacks. They then exploited the poverty to get votes. Instead of expanding welfare, Trump is bringing back well paying jobs to these struggling people.
@RabbiShmuley @netanyahu @UN @realDonaldTrump Lol, you're probably the only person who paid attention to Bibi's speech today.
@ToddElkins11 @eugenegu I'm sure it has to do with your inability to have sex w/o soliciting low class prostitutes. While you'll always be ugly, don't despair. You can always lose weight b4 obesity kills you.
@JMCSPORTSBOOK @eugenegu I respectfully disagree. The Democrats still want to keep Blacks poor &amp; dependent on welfare so they vote for Democrats. LBJ launched the war on poverty and poverty won. Trump offers real economic opportunities to Blacks which is why so many of them support him secretly &amp; openly.
@eugenegu Democrats are the party of slavery.
@JPeters_in_MD @WOM_alley @BrianFrosh @LarryHogan 4. Maybe he's bitter bc his dad can't raise taxes on struggling MDers, while taking multiple 6 digit pensions at their expense. Maybe he's bitter that his dad can't steal anymore furniture. Or maybe he's bitter that his dad spends so much time in Iowa but will never be  POTUS
@JPeters_in_MD @WOM_alley @BrianFrosh @LarryHogan 3. Hogan came and started fixing the serious damage that Omalley caused to MD. The polls speak for themselves; Hogan is one of the most popular governors ever. This really seems to bother Omalley's hack of a son. So he goes on Twitter and makes absurd, nonsensical assertions.
@JPeters_in_MD @WOM_alley @BrianFrosh @LarryHogan 2. MD gave Omalley a chance, and boy did he screw up. After 8 years of: income &amp; sales tax increases, rising unemployment, shrinking population, rising poverty, higher tolls, fewer businesses moving to MD, &amp; higher crime rates Marylanders wisely rejected Omalley's failed policies
@JPeters_in_MD @WOM_alley @BrianFrosh @LarryHogan 1. William Omalley is total moron. He thinks the ban is unconstitutional. He thinks that the governor controls the AG's office. He thinks that the AG should divert limited prosecutorial resources to meddle in partisan federal politics instead of prosecuting violent criminals.
@WOM_alley @LarryHogan @MartinOMalley, a partisan hack, won elections with zero Republican support. Hogan, in contrast, brings people together &amp; is widely popular amongst Democrats. You'd be better off helping your loser dad crack that 1% glass ceiling in Iowa, than pontificating about #MDPolitics
@ohheyjenna Shame on you for normalizing obesity and the array of terrible health ailments that come with it. How about you do your job and promote self control and exercise. How about talking about the Hundreds of Billions of dollars wasted on expensive medical care for obese people?
@JeffBezos is a piece of sh!t. He'd rather hord money he can never spend rather than give charity. No, placing money in a "fund" isn't tantamount to giving it to charity.

@WOM_alley FACT: the bay is cleaner under @LarryHogan than it was under @MartinOMalley.
@SarahBurris Thank goodness the Democrats were dumb enough to nominate Hillary in 2016 after her time came and went.
@JPeters_in_MD @WOM_alley Lol. WOM Alley is one of those ignoramuses who thinks that every low skilled worker should get paid 15 dollars an hour. Even Mayor Pugh understood what a terrible idea that was and that any benefits to the workers would be lost due to huge price increases and inflation.
@RealKanyeTwitty @nytimes Republicans. However, since you're ignorant, I'll educate you about Senate rules and procedures: Democrats are able to demand a full 30 hours of debate for every nominee. This is a totally extreme move, &amp; even wasn't done by Republican, who were obstructionists against Obama.
@RealThndrMonkey @RealKanyeTwitty @nytimes Lol. I looked at YOUR bio. You're a disheveled guy from Western Arkansas (one of the worst states according to @usnews) &amp; badly in need of a haircut and shave. You claim to be an aspiring author, despite your inability to properly write a few sentences on Twitter. You're the bot!
@RealThndrMonkey @RealKanyeTwitty @nytimes Like a typical liberal, instead of addressing the facts of my argument--as to why so few ambassadors have been confirmed--you make personal attacks against me. For the record, your arguments are non-existent; your grammar and language usage is sloppy? Who's the bot here?
@WOM_alley Popular Analysis: @MartinOMalley is a failed governor and  nationally unknown, overly ambitious individual; his frequent visits to Iowa should not be taken seriously.
@all4feets @nytimes FYI, Chuck Schumer and his flunkies arr taking extreme measures in the Senate to have 30 hours of debate for each nominee to obstruct &amp; slow down the process. They delayed the confirmation of the first gay ambassador to Germany for almost a year. Sad!
@ComedianTheDA @nytimes I challenge you to name one person indicted from the Trump administration.
@nytimes Typically, the #FakeNews @nytimes fails to mention the context: the fact that Cryin Chuck Schumer &amp; his flunkies are making it nearly impossible to confirm them; they are demanding 30 hours of Senate review for each nominee instead of the regular, quick perfunctory confirmation.
@realDonaldTrump @MikePompeo4USA @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I think you meant @SecPompeo.
@sheeraf Stop bitching. Millions of women are struggling to put food on their tables, and you're complaining that despite your cushy job and nanny it's difficult to go on morning TV shows. Very tone deaf.
@WOM_alley Lol. So Michael Avenatti is the future of your party, or my party ( I'm officially a Democrat thanks to the Democratic corrupt stranglehold on Baltimore based on lies and race baiting.) I think I'd even prefer @MartinOMalley over that unqualified clown.
@WOM_alley If Rich and White like Omalley's, you live in a 99% White area within a 70% Black city; you take 2 large pensions @ taxpayers expense; you obtain a high paying judgeship for your unqualified relative through cronyism; you steal furniture from the governor's mansion. #MDPolitics
@WOM_alley Dude, I totally understand that it's your dream for your dad to be president. However, I need to burst your bubble, since even Michael Avenatti has more national name recognition than @MartinOMalley. Stop dreaming and wasting your time in Iowa. It's never going to happen!
@simpson_mart @lanebrooks Lol. You really have no idea what you're talking about. Quite amusing to see such blatant ignorance.
@lanebrooks The Social Security Act is bankrupting the country, taxing young workers for benefits they will never receive, and opening the floodgates for parasites to feign injuries and live off the taxpayers. But you can always count on liberals to celebrate another failed entitlement. Sad!
@WOM_alley Hogan is the second most popular governor in the United States. https://t.co/Pt8aFN6Xsm
@WOM_alley The Chesapeake Bay is cleaner under Larry Hogan than under @MartinOMalley.
@WOM_alley Project that would only benefit a few thousand people. The Department of Transportation already debunked your false allegation, but you're lying- as you always do. Sad!
@WOM_alley Blacks in Baltimore got crushed under Omalley's gubernatorial &amp; mayoral administration's. Typically, when you have no record to stand by, you resort to reckless race baiting. The red line was canceled because it wasn't viable to burden taxpayers with a multi billion dollar...
@TheSatmarWorld The entiled, selfish Rebbe takes a four week vacation, while the Hasidim live in abysmal poverty. Sad! https://t.co/1CC7LbAaNj
@TheSatmarWorld Because when you're a Rebbe (parasite) you get to take fancy vacations, at the expense of wealthy suckups, while the brainwashed Hasidim who were denied an education struggle in KJ, the poorest town in the country, to feed the 10 children they were brainwashed to have. Sad!
@TheSatmarWorld No one cares about your very ordinary rabbi. He brainwashes his mass cult into thinking he's a deity so he can mooch from a small group of wealthy sycophants, to live in luxury, while the remaining Hasidim live in poverty- b/c they can't get an education &amp; must have 10 kids. Sad!
@WOM_alley You're lying, but Paul Ryan didn't spend his career raising taxes &amp; pandering to poor people like your father, giving them a few measly entitlements, while living off  multiple tax payer funded pensions in a rich, exclusively white neighborhood in a majority Black city.
@WOM_alley I agree! Democrats will get trounced in 2020!
@WOM_alley @MartinOMalley LOL. Your Dads lack of self awareness is so amusing. Getting less than 1% in the Iowa caucus doesn't make him a "national Democrat," nor does stumping for obscure, low level, local office seekers.
@WOM_alley @LarryHogan @realDonaldTrump Liar. The governor has no control over the Attorney General's office. #MDPolitics #DemocratsForHogan
@AprilDRyan No, you're not a genius for figuring that out. He's given 3 speeches in New Hampshire.
@ze_lama Dude, cut off those hideous side locks.
@AbeRosenberg1 @JFNYC1 @nycphotog Hasidim are a disgrace. It's shameful that tens of thousands of American Hasidim can only speak broken English with thick Yiddish accents. It is illegal and a violation of HR to deny children basic language skills for your sinister motive of trapping them in your community.
@TalbertSwan @jamfan40 @realDonaldTrump Your ignorance in foreign policy matters is profound. Iran and North Korea pose much greater threats to the USA  than Russia.
@StevenMStrohl @realDonaldTrump Because retards like you support the traitor, Barack Hussein Obama and the terrorists in Iran to whom he illegally sent billions of dollars in cash to buttress their terrorist activities. Sad! #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
@Wicomico_Jared @BenJealous Keep on dreaming. We Marylanders are not going to replace the second most popular governor in the country with an inexperienced, self professed socialist who wants to raise our taxes even higher than Omalley. Ben Jealous' nomination is a dream come true for Governor Hogan.
@MartinOMalley @WOM_alley @RoadToChange Ludicrous. Baltimore is the murder capital of America. However, you might be oblivious to the poverty &amp; crime in your own city, since you live in a segregated neighborhood that's 99% White, in which, under covenants, Blacks are unable to buy homes. @iowademocrats
@WalkerBragman @WOM_alley I agree. That's why, given the derangement of the libtards, I'm confident that we will have a #RedWave2018.
@WOM_alley @LarryHogan Disgraceful that the hack @MartinOMalley touts his unconstitutional weapons bans as a measure to prevent school shootings while ignoring the fact that it only infringes on the second amendment rights of law abiding people.
@WOM_alley @LarryHogan @SloanForMD26 Keep dreaming. Hogan will win in a landslide. He's far more popular than your hack of a father ever was. I can't wait to see his @ss get kicked in Iowa.

@WOM_alley Unlike @MartinOMalley, Governor Hogan got his money honestly. He didn't make it by mooching cushy pensions from the hard working taxpayers of Baltimore and Maryland or by stealing furniture from the governor's mansion. #FurnitureGate 	@iowademocrats 		https://t.co/qqVVoxg128
@WOM_alley @MartinOMalley lives in Homeland, a neighborhood thats 99% White within a city that's 80% Black. He  does'nt give a dam about Black poverty, &amp; unlike Hogan, derives his $$ by mooching cushy pensions from taxpayers &amp; stealing furniture from the governor's mansion. @iowademocrats
@TheRevAl @CoryBooker Why does this filthy racist abd Anti semite have a verified Twitter @Jack?
@dnewhauser A few reporters and I. Learn basic grammar before becoming a reporter
@karentravers Because you're a loser and don't get to fly on Air Force One.
@WOM_alley In his typical childish tone, William Omalley shows us how resentful he is that Marylanders rejected @MartinOMalley's policies of tax hikes and protecting the corrupt status quo. Omalley, the hack, can only dream of Hogan's 80% approval rating despite being a Democrat. Sad!
@WOM_alley How did @MartinOMalley secure a cushy judgeship for your mother, who graduated from University of Baltimore Law, a third tier law school?		Answer: because he is a privileged, entitled white man who used cronyism and nepotism to advance his unqualified relatives. @iowademocrats
@WOM_alley Speaking of priveliged whites, why does @MartinOMalley live in Homeland, a neighborhood that's 99% white in a city that's 80% Black. A neighborhood with covenants discriminating against and barring Jews &amp; Blacks from buying homes there. Youre all talk &amp; no action. @iowademocrats
@PaulaChertok Yeah, because Obama was a weak pushover who made red lines and then caved to Putin's pressure. Of course it was Obama's weakness that allowed Putin to annex Crimea. You're a hypocritical idiot.
@WOM_alley https://t.co/Rl8jqHrd5P  CC. @MartinOMalley @iowademocrats
@TheCreatureLive You British fu&lt;ktards sure know how to burn bridges and insult the most powerful man in the world. I'll be LMAO when your country is out of the EU and desperately begging Trump for a trade deal only to be told to GO F&lt;CK YOURSELVES IN YOUR COCKY BRITISH ASSES.
@dtxErgaOmnes @tedcruz Ludicrous to conflate a vacancy during a presidential election and the eighth year of a lame duck Obama presidency with a vacancy during a midterm and second year of the Trump presidency.

@imillhiser RACIST
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Sadly, America is full of extraordinarily low IQ individuals like you- who believe that the anatomy of one's genetalia determines the validity of their argument. Sad!
@AlwaysLinderell @peter_kwong1 @maggieNYT Not Michelle. She had a low LSAT score and only got in because of affirmative action.
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins You're the one committing elementary logical fallacies, appealing to statistics instead of defending the morality of abortion, and suggesting that my gender is relevant to my arguments on abortion.
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Yes
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins What about you?
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins I'm sorry, but that's a logical fallacy. Abortion is murderous and wrong, and I can recognize that even if I don't have a vagina.
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Dude, it's not at all like Gary marriage. Unlike marriage equality, which is innocuous, abortion is killing the unborn fetus. No one should ever be allowed to do that.
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins First, I'm a Conservative Democrat. Second, it's a false equation to conflate innocent unborn children with convicted criminals. With that being said, I don't trust the criminal justice system enough to not screw up and execute innocent people which has occurred in the past.
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Wrong! When did I say I'm ok with that!?
@vanderpunked @sstamm27 @JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins The word is rapists, and one heinous crime of rape does not justify another heinous crime of killing a fetus.
@JameyFunny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins You have the right to not become pregnant. However, you can't murder a fetus out of convenience. Would it have been cool if your mother chose to "control her body" and aborted you.
@TheUndefeated FYI, he was an abusive father to his children.
@WOM_alley @LarryHogan Wasn't it the @MartinOMalley administration that gave the incompetent MVA bureaucrats the ability to register voters?

@Condorian2487 @ggreenwald I love winning and watching the losers, liberal snowflakes, bawling on election night.
@ggreenwald It		Thank you Sleepy Joe (Biden) for the Biden rule that the Senate won't confirm SCOTUS nominees in a presidential election year. The difference is that Democrats are losers and Republicans know how to achieve their goals.
@DanteAtkins üòÇ We won; you lost. Deal with it.
@PatCunnane @KamalaHarris @AmbassadorRice It would, for Republicans.
@DayvonLove @Happy2BeJudith @jillpcarter @jdmerrill @baltimoresun It's not ok to miss 5% of votes when tens of thousands of constituents are relying on your representation. The legislature is only in session for 3 months per year, but she's too lazy to show up every day. She had the worst voting record of any Baltimore delegate. Try again....
@sugarjacq @jillpcarter Why are you supporting a derelict politician who according to the @baltimoresun missed 1600 votes but thinks she's entitled to a cushy government salary and benefits.
@SmartBlackMan @jdmerrill You have no idea what you're talking about. Blacks are the majority at City College; stop pretending that they're fragile victims, in a hostile environment, who need special treatment.
@jillpcarter No thanks. I'm actually voting against you, and I hope you lose.
@jillpcarter @YouTube Years of experience skipping votes in Annapolis does not make you more qualified.
@jillpcarter It is indeed very important to vote so we can remove arrogant, derelict politicians like you from office.
@Happy2BeJudith @jillpcarter @jdmerrill As noted by the @baltimoresun, she missed 1600 votes in Anapolis. She is a selfish, derelict, arrogant individual who believes she is entitled to a cushy government salary and benefits without putting in the work for her constituents. Why would any same individual vote for her?
@rob_schrader @PinchasBalsam @gdebenedetti So ludicrous. You clearly don't understand what fascism is. No capitalist billionaire in their right mind would support a political system that involves the state forcibly taking control over their industries.
@LisaMcCray @jillpcarter Racebating moron. The @baltimoresun didn't endorse her because of her abysmal voting record and her disregard for representing constituents on important issues. But when you can't defend her record, idiots like you play the race card. Sad!
@bmoreProjects @jillpcarter @baltimoresun She's so uncompromising that she thinks she can miss hundreds of votes in Annapolis. Sicko!
@jillpcarter @themeum LOL!!! You're so bitter because the @baltimoresun didn't endorse you. You're an incompetent, derelict moron. It was a pleasure to vote against you. I can't wait to watch your defeat.
@RushernBaker @WOM_alley @ggwash Highways are not built in four years, DUMB MORON.
@WOM_alley @umdrepublicans You're such an ignorant fool. The parents are inficting pain on their children. You don't get an out of jail free card because you have children. Incarcerated parents are separated from their parents all the time. Children suffer frequently from their parents dumb choices.
Hey @ScottTurow. You lied in your book "1L." Harvard Law is not the oldest law school. University of Maryland and William and Mary are older.
@JuliaIsWriting @ChrisVanHollen You're a despicable person. Your job is to work for and represent the people of Maryland. You should not be traveling to Texas to visit families who were separated due to the parents crime of illegally entering the country, a practice that occurred frequently under Obama.
@JGWentworth6 @MarkSinatra @markknoller @POTUS @AmbassadorRice @BarackObama Trump has done nothing to reward Putin. You're wholly ignorant. Obama was a weak pushover who, per Putin's demands didn't honor his red line in 2013. Sensing Obama's weakness, Putin annexed Crimea in 2014.

@WOM_alley I agree. Democrats will lose badly in 2018 and 2020. If your dad wants a chance at becoming POTUS, he should wait until 2024.
@stephanieodigi1 Especially if you're dumb! Seriously, if you feel that way, you might want to choose another career before borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars. I promise you that if you feel that way, law school, passing the bar, &amp; actually practicing law will not be any easier.
@prxncess_ayo It's called Black Privelage. Just hope you're able to pass the bar and actually become a lawyer.
@coolcam101 @realDonaldTrump Dude, What the fuck. That is some creepy shit
@jules_su Amazing how you lie so brazenly and with such impunity.
@LiveSatNews @YouTube I think you meant a multilateral meeting.
@WOM_alley @LarryHogan LOL! We all know you're extremely bitter, since @MartinOMalley could only dream of the 73% percent approval Hogan enjoys. 2/3 of Democrats think he's doing a good job. Falsely tying him to Trump, whom he didn't endorse, is why the Omalleys are notorious for being dishonest.

@jerome_briscoe @WOM_alley @jillpcarter No surprise that a thick headed moron like you plays the race card, since you can't defend Jill Carter's abysmal voting record. Except for idiots like you, being Black and a woman doesn't give her immunity from legitimate criticism.

@SteveOgdenArt I will be running on that trail as well.
@SmartBlackMan @jdmerrill @MartinOMalley Despite your self promoting Twitter handle, you're quite unintelligent. Blacks are a super majority in Baltimore City, and Omalley only got elected because he was widely supported by Blacks.
@SmartBlackMan @WOM_alley Funny how the rabid, biggoted alt left, Anti Semitic/Anti-White movement believes that derelict Black politicians should be immune from criticism because of their skin color. Someone who missed 1600 votes is not someone I will support. Saying that doesn't make me a racist.
@WOM_alley Not that I like the Omalleys, but, as a Conservative Democrat, I will be voting for @jdmerrill. Anyone is better than the corrupt, derelict disgrace of a politician @jillpcarter.
@JulianLopezPG @KrishForMD Obama, whom I supported, had a vision. We know how that turned out. He was a weak, ineffective pushover, who didn't garner any respect from world leaders. He imposed crippling regulations on the economy and prevented a full recovery. That's why Democrats like me voted for Trump.
@plutonomic @KrishForMD She's not even legally qualified to run for a Maryland election, since she hasn't lived in Maryland for the last 5 years. Thankfully, she has no chance of winning, so there won't be any need for a lawsuit.
LOL! You can't even respond by telling us what qualifications you have to be the governor of a large state. Being: a low level advisor to Michelle Obama, a woman &amp; an immigrant does not qualify you to effectively run the large bureaucracies of Maryland. https://t.co/h1hWE97nB7
@ohiosinger07 @KrishForMD But you're unable to tell me why Krish is qualified to manage the large government bureaucracies. Also, running a billion dollar real estate corporation for 40 years is much more of a qualification than being a low level advisor to Michelle Obama for 2 years.
@ohiosinger07 @KrishForMD Hypothetically, because she used to be a governor. I was saying that identify politics is a failed strategy. The smart Democrats understand this. Contrary to the lies of Vignarajah, we Conservatives don't oppose her bc of gender or race; we oppose her bc of lack of qualifications
@KrishForMD Moron, playing the woman's card &amp; attributing mean Tweets to sexism &amp; racism is ludicrous. The backlash is because you have no qualifications other than identity politics. I would gladly vote for Nicki Haley for governor. She's qualified &amp; doesn't need to run on her sex and race.
@KrishForMD @EvelinaS22 You're a delusional laughingstock. Running for governor, and you can't even get verified on Twitter. üòÇüòÇüòÇ Sad!
@KrishForMD @EvelinaS22 You're a disgrace to MD. Actually, you can't even meet the 5 year residency rule bec. you're a swamp dweller. You have literally no experience that qualifies you to run a large state. Thankfully, all you're able to run on is identity politics. I can't wait to vote against you.
Deceptive. The very unpopular rain tax was repealed by the Democrat super majority in the legislature. Under Taxer in Chief Omalley, Maryland was the only state to levy a rain tax.

@jim_sensei_2112 @axios It's pathetic that feminists can't find a hero who is not married to a male POTUS
@ememwilson123 @_EthanGrey And it's ironic that people who claim to support women's rights don't support a female presidential candidate who is self made, and doesn't need to invoke her husband's last name. Last time I checked, Michelle Obama is the most popular amongst so called feminists
@ememwilson123 @_EthanGrey Sadly, there are morons like you who think that she was more qualified than GW, Lincoln, and FDR. FYI, if she didn't marry the larger than life Bill Clinton, she would still be an obscure lawyer. Her rise to prominence was completely tied to her husband's success....
@_EthanGrey Because sadly, deranged morons like you think that Trump appointments must be reflexively blocked, even if she served the agency with distinction for 30 years, is widely popular among her colleagues, &amp; has the support of both Obama and Bush CIA directors.

@GehennaHelena *garbs
@GehennaHelena You're wrong about how many innocent Arabs are attacked by Israelis. The opposite is true, but I won't defend the perpetrators of any unjustified violence. You, however, justify the violence of terrorist groups by saying Israel deserves it. That is wrong.
@GehennaHelena LOL. You've only been in conflict with each other for some 1400 years.
@GehennaHelena Because you don't agree with the Arab League that Hezbollah is a terrorist group. Also, you seem sympathetic to Iran. Did you know that Iran kills LGBTs, bans social media, violently attacks peaceful protestestors, &amp; forces women to dress in religious carbs. Do you condemn Iran?
@GehennaHelena The mosque in Jerusalem was built centuries after Mohamed died.
@GehennaHelena Iran and Saudi Arabia are Muslim states, but that doesn't mean all Muslims are associated with them. Btw, are you Muslim or Christian? Shia or Sunni?
@GehennaHelena Because the Arabs were throwing rocks at Jews praying at the Western Wall, so they went in to arrest them. And, for the record Jerusalem isn't mentioned even once in the Koran as a holy place. Only relatively recently did Muslims claim that, unlike Christians and Jews.
@GehennaHelena @ss I'm not Anti-Muslim.
@GehennaHelena @ss Right, rogue countries like Russia and China which leftists like you pick and choose when they are credible international players.
@GehennaHelena @ss It does matter what Americans think, because if Muslims want to immigrate to the US, and they are sympathetic to terrorists, and won't cooperate with the FBI to try to prevent terrorism, we have a right to deny them entry.
@GehennaHelena Also, if Hezbollah has No hatred for non-Israeli Jews, why did Hezbollah bomb the Jewish Comunity Center in Buenos Aires, killing 85 Argentinian Jews?
@GehennaHelena Unlike Nasrallah-who speaks for Hezbollah- none of those people represent the views of Israel. I condemn those statements, but you sadly don't condemn the heinous, violent actions of Hezbollah against civilians, which is a violation of international law.
@GehennaHelena @ss From Arab and Muslim countries, and why President Trump decided to temporarily freeze immigration from those countries until a better vetting process could be put in place.
@GehennaHelena @ss Hezbollah was labeled a terrorist group by: the US, UK, New Zealand, Netherlands, Japan, France, the EU, Canada, Bahrain, Australia, &amp; the Arab League. The fact that people like you refuse to condemn Hezbollah is why many Americans are suspicious of people immigrating...
@GehennaHelena @ss Hospitals &amp; kindergartens to inflate Arab casualties. Unlike Hezbollah, which by their own admission targets Israeli civilians, the IDF does their best to avoid harming civilians. Facts matter.
@GehennaHelena @ss You're childish name calling doesn't detract from your utter ignorance of facts. 83% of Americans polled by Gallup blamed Hezbollah for the war. Hez. targeted Israeli civilians with rockets, forcing the IDF to bomb their weapons caches which they purposely build under....
@GehennaHelena The leader of Hezbollah said that he hopes all the Jews of the worldgather in Israel so that they won't need to hunt them down around the world. You should condem Hezbollah not defend it.
@GehennaHelena They absolutely never bombed it that is total #FakeNews, propaganda nonsense.
@GehennaHelena Lol, idiot. The elections were supposed to take place in 2013, but didn't take place until 2018 due to the political instability in Lebanon.
@GehennaHelena Hezbollah blew up the one synagogue. They subsequently restored it, trying to pretend that they're only Anti-Israel but not Anti-Semitic. We're not fooled. Virtually all the Lebanese Jews had to flee Lebanon due to persecution.
@GehennaHelena Why is it ok for Iran to interfere with Lebanese geopolitical affairs but not ok for Saudi Arabia? Do you prefer Shiites?
@GehennaHelena Do you really think Israel started the war? Actually, Hezbollah, a Shia fanatic, extremist, Anti-Semitic group initiated the war by kidnapping 3 Israeli soldiers. That is an act of war, and Israel was alowed to retaliate under international law.
@GehennaHelena Lebanon is not a democracy. They didn't hold elections for 9 years!
@GehennaHelena Doesn't seem like a good place to live.
@GehennaHelena Synagogues were bombed. Jews had to flee. Christians were persecuted &amp; had to flee. Constant civil wars. Homosexual sex officially illegal, let alone marriage. Hezbollah    army free to operate independently and cause wars that effect Lebanese civilians. PM detained by Saudis.
@GehennaHelena Also, I say this respectfully, but Arab culture lacks human rights, women's rights, gay rights, freedom of speech, protection of religious minorities, economic mobility, &amp; election integrity. If you care about these fundamental democratic issues, you  should avoid Arab countries.
@GehennaHelena If you're concerned about war with Iran, I would stay far away from the Middle East. Iran's nefarious activities in the region are getting worse every day, &amp; there might be a war between Iran/Hezbollah And Israel.
@GehennaHelena Really? You're ok moving from the U.S. to an autocracy with an abysmal human rights record? Please tell me that you're joking.
@GehennaHelena Moreover, I'm a registered Democrat, who opposed Bush &amp; the Iraq War (which Hillary supported.) It's not a question of if the war was a smart decision, it's a question of weather Obama &amp; Hillary withdrew in a fashion that destabilized the region even more and helped create ISIS.
@GehennaHelena No. I'm quite intelligent. I studied International Relations actually, &amp; I'm not sure why you needed to send me a quackery article that generally refers to the Iraq war as a terrible FP decision. I already told you I agree with you on that &amp; it doesn't prove your point on ISIS.
@GehennaHelena Are you suggesting that you would move to Africa if you had the chance? Are you crazy!? Are you acknowledging that countries get to decide who they admit? If yes, I wholeheartedly agree with you, and I believe that America can exercise this right.
@GehennaHelena And in Nigeria there is a neighborhood in which corrupt oligarchs live in opulent mansions. Why don't you move there!? You look at a country holistically. If you don't comprehend this, you are not very intelligent.
@GehennaHelena Not sure what you want me to do with a NY tabloid, biased, trash article.
@GehennaHelena I'm not a supporter of Bush or the invasion of Iraq, but don't pretend for even a second that ISIS was a formidable force before Barack Hussein Obama stupidly, prematurely withdrew from Iraq.
@GehennaHelena Moron, I specifically acknowledged that Barack Hussein Obama only catagorized them as high risk, but didn't ban them because he was too concerned what his unpatriotic, politically correct base would think. Sad!
@GehennaHelena Thanks for proving my point. Obama designated those countries as high risk, and Trump, who actually cares about national security, took it a step further and temporarily banned them until better vetting systems could be implemented. Not so complicated.
@GehennaHelena Right. By Barack Hussein Obama and Crooked Hillary Clinton when they preemptively withdrew from Iraq and left a void that was filled by ISIS.
@GehennaHelena No, it's not racism. He's underscoring his belief that he wants skilled immigrants who can contribute to the American economy. Not illiterate but dwellers who won't be able to support themselves and will immediately go on welfare. Again, nothing to do with race.
@GehennaHelena Shithole countries exist among many races. Pointing them out doesn't make you a racist against those people.
@GehennaHelena Why don't you go to Kenya, Nigeria, or Uganda- where they speak English. The answer is because they are poor, sh!thole, corrupt failed countries. That is indisputable, and irrelevant to the race of the people who live there. Moldova &amp; Romania are also sh!tholes as is Bangladesh.
@GehennaHelena Regarding ISIS, you're conflating a geographical caliphate and radical Islamic terrorism which is unfortunately still in existence.
@GehennaHelena Out of foreigners, who we have no obligation to permit entry, Muslims pose the highest risk of terrorism. No one disputes this? The Obama administration originally designated those countries as posing a high risk of sending terrorists. https://t.co/vF3bCBSspw
@GehennaHelena Oh, so now you're conflating a phone call to making a special trip to Andrews Air Force Base at 2:30am. Very intelligent!
@GehennaHelena If you think that those countries are so great, why don't you move to one of them?
@GehennaHelena You're wrong yet again. You don't get to redefine racism. You're the only one bringing up Black &amp; White. Trump was simply stating the reality that Sub-Saharan Africa is full of failed, sh!thole countries run by greedy, corrupt autocrats. Norway is not like that.
@GehennaHelena You're wrong again. Barack Hussein Obama never greeted the released hostages at Andrews Air Force Base. Facts matter.
@GehennaHelena The travel ban was designed to temporarily keep out people from the most high risk countries until proper vetting systems could be implemented.
@GehennaHelena Has a serious problem with radicals who hate America and it's values. While some of these extremist become terrorists, many abbet the terrorists by not reporting suspicious, radical, Anti-American behavior to law enforcement.
@GehennaHelena He apologized for the tweets. He never said all Muslims hate us. His first foreign trip was to Saudi Arabia where he was warmly received by 70 Muslim heads of state. Muslim leaders respect him. It's not about Islamaphobia, it's about acknowledging the reality that your religion..

@GehennaHelena And thanks for pointing out that President Trump gained the freedom of an Egyptian woman even though the standard libtard  talking point is that he's Anti-Muslim
@GehennaHelena referred to some of the most troubled countries in the world as shi!thole. That's not racism. Nor is it racist to criticize a Black person. Nor is it sexism to criticize a woman. Racism is insulting a person because of their race, and that's not what President Trump did.
@GehennaHelena He traveled to Andrews at 2:30am to welcome them. You're truly dumb, if you believe he didn't want to. He also utilized his friendship with the President Xi to free 3 Blacks who stole in China, but dumb libtards like you falsely claim he's hates Blacks because he correctly......
@Mazinkaiser24 That's a logical fallacy, moron, but you're probably too dumb to understand why.

@KLMcFilth @DonaldJTrumpJr What's your marital status?
@TheGOPSux @realTomShae @BiglyPrez @realDonaldTrump @USNavy Because in your deranged libtard mind, Anti-Semititism and racism is ok when it comes from a Black Democrat. Sad!

@AnitaSchelde Learn English you dumb Polish moron.
Hey @LauraAJarrett of #fakenews @cnn. @POTUS didn't "go after DOJ  attorneys" as you falsely reported to @wolfblitzer. On the contrary, Trump  was asking why DOJ attorneys were not investigating Obama's corrupt FISA abuses.

@StuartTebbutt @gray82411691 @ZchCarbon @markwools @piersmorgan In addition all of their so called personal wealth was accumulated over many centuries of taxing the peasants and working class and stealing from foreign lands that they colonized.
@StuartTebbutt @gray82411691 @ZchCarbon @markwools @piersmorgan Tens of millions of pounds anually is not nothing. Are you literate?

@StuartTebbutt @gray82411691 @ZchCarbon @markwools @piersmorgan No chip in my shoulder. I just won't accept your cocky, ungrateful attitude after we Americans sacrificed lives so that you can live in freedom. Of course Britain restricts free speech, but that's another issue.
@gray82411691 @StuartTebbutt @ZchCarbon @markwools @piersmorgan Lol. She literally did nothing in her life other than being born to the right family at the right time.
@StuartTebbutt @gray82411691 @ZchCarbon @markwools @piersmorgan You keep saying that, but you can't contend even one thing I said on a factual basis. Sad!

@gray82411691 @StuartTebbutt @ZchCarbon @markwools @piersmorgan They spent centuries colonizing much of Europe and Asia, stealing the natural resources of the natives, and persecuting the natives. I don't need any lessons on how to live from such a horrible country.
@gray82411691 @StuartTebbutt @ZchCarbon @markwools @piersmorgan The cocky Brits live in an alternative reality.

They rely on America to guarantee their defense but don't contribute their fair share to NATO.
@gray82411691 @StuartTebbutt @ZchCarbon @markwools @piersmorgan Sorry, though the  British morons distort history, the truth is clear. The British parasites were twice getting pummeled by the Axis until American troops traveled across the Atlantic to save you. Instead of being grateful, Brits have a cocky attitude and try to distort history.

@williamlegate @CoryBooker @StopBigMoney So do you reject the liberal hypocrites like Obama and Hillary who criticize the Koch brothers and then take millions from the Soros' Steyers, Sussman, Saban and other wealthy liberals?

@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG In my neighborhood there are many hardworking, decent, middle class Blacks who raise their families in a responsible manner and send their kids to decent schools. In other neighborhoods, both Black &amp; white, irresponsible ppl make bad choices that cause generational poverty.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG You live in a dream world in which you freely distort my statements. What I said was, the Obama's ability to afford good schools (Nothing about becoming POTUS) was due to their good decisions. If Michelle dropped out of HS got pregnant @ 15 her kids lives would be very different.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG Personally, I would never seek help from someone who is a racist.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG Not my experience with law firms. I've worked with and been interviewed by both women and Blacks. It sounds like you live in one of the most racist parts of the country.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG It's not because of racism nor Black privelage that President Obama can afford to send Malia and Sasha to better schools than a white heroine addict in West Virginia or an inner city Black woman who decided to become pregnant as a teenager. Its only because he made better choices
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG My teachers weren't racists,  but I take issue with your assumption that people attend better schools bc they're white. Ppl attend excellent schools because their parents made good choices that enabled them to afford private schools or live in expensive areas with good public ed
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG There is no institutional racism against minorities. Institutions only discriminate against whites, especially men, by requiring them to have higher SAT and LSAT scores.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG I am very genuine. Instead of getting ad hominem, please tell me specific advantages you have had as a white man.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG What specific advantages are you referring to? I can't think of any, but you're probably a generation older than me. Maybe things have changed.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG Thats not true. Its discrimination to artificially create diversity by lowering the standard for a select group. I think it's incredibly degrading to Black women for Harvard to assume that they are too dumb to get a 170 on LSAT so it's necessary to lower their standard to 160.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG This discrimination manifests in many arenas. If I applied to law school as a Black woman I would have gotten accepted to Harvard with my grades. As a white male I must meet a much higher standard. I suspect you had a similar experience. Do you think this discrimination is ok?
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG I absolutely agree that a diverse group of lawyers qualify for SCOTUS. However, we can't start reverse discriminating, identity politics games against white males just because they were traditionally overrepresented. Discrimination is not the solution to discrimination.
@wbaltv11 They are sending drugs, crime, package thieves, they're rapists, and some, I assume are good people.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG To suggest that an entire race/sex shares the same biases and that diversity is necessary for the justices to uphold the constitution.
@RandyAlberhasky @Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG It's not just memorizing the constitution, which very few people can do, it's also knowing the relevant precedences and having the intellect to apply it to modern dilemmas. Perhaps everyone is naturally biased, however it's racist/sexist....
@Sifill_LDF @ConstitutionCtr @NotoriousRBG So absurd. The only prerequisite to being a SCOTUS justice is demonstrated knowledge of the constitution. Backround and diversity are totally irrelevant.
@sandypsj You lose your credabilaty when you use the race card on honorable politicians like Larry Hogan. It only underscores how desperate and deranged liberals are, and how they will get clobbered this November- especially if the liberals nominate a loser like @kevinkamenetz.

@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion Suppose the government paid my way through school and gave me a stipend during my years in school. It would not be worth it because I would be paying exorbitant tax rates for the next forty years.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion If you had a free market system doctors would be compensated their true value and they can pay their way through school with loans. That's what we Americans do. I'm borrowing money to pay for law school because I know I will be paid well in a free market
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion I don't tweet for Trump and certainly can't defend every one of his tweets. I am a big supporter of Trump however, albeit anonymously,  because I live in a liberal city in which people yell racist the second they see a Trump supporter.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion A huge demand for doctors because it's free.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion My point was, as long as you have NHS artificially lowering the cost of healthcare via regulations, you will have people dying because doctors aren't getting paid their value, so no one wants to study in school for many years to become a doctor. Meanwhile, there is...
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion I say all this as a poor student, struggling to pay my way through law school. However, I live in a country that rewards hard work and tenacity much more than the democratic socialist countries. I wouldn't want it to be any different.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion You can't change the reality of life that some people are wealthy and can afford more things than others. But we agree that the government shouldn't let it's people die.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion I'm don't understand why you or other Brits would advocate spending more taxpayer money on a system that is fundamentally flawed from an economic standpoint as aposed to transitioning to a free market system?
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion You keep asking that, but again, how about you tell me why my economic arguments are wrong instead of saying "how can you know better than people who live in England?"
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion The US system rewards doctors for their many years of schooling while also preventing people from making unecesary visits to doctors. And no, we don't have bureaucrats deciding which age cohorts lives are more valuable.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion And even they will not be denied emergency health care if they show up at an emergency room.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion 1. We in the US have a free market. Healthcare costs reflect the actual market value and some people can afford better care than others. However, poor people receive healthcare through Medicaid and Medicare. No one is denied healthcare other than illegal immigrants...
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion Isabel, 		You seem like a smart, reasonable person. However, you keep committing logical fallacies.  Me living in Britain and using the NHS is completely irrelevant to the validity of my argument.  Please address my arguments, not my background and nationality.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion Pouring more taxpayer dollars into the NHS system will not resolve the core of your country's healthcare crisis.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion When your NHS artificially lowers the price of medical care it causes fewer people to want to become doctors while also causing more people to seek unnecessary medical care. The results in Britain are: more patients, fewer doctors, long wait times, and sick people dying.
@isabel_dixon @BrotherOwens @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion Why would Brits advocate for more money getting poured into a failed system that by your own admission had serious problems even at higher funding levels? Why wouldn't you want to switch to a free market system like we Americans have?
@BrotherOwens @isabel_dixon @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion Sorry, but most of those articles predated Theresa May and your current government. These problems have existed in Britain for many years precisely because of the socialized nature of NHS. Perhaps the cuts somewhat exacerbated the problems, but the problems were previously there.
@BrotherOwens @isabel_dixon @Avem_Darkstar @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump @NHSMillion The list continues, but you probably get my point.

@Henderia93 @AshAgony OK Cocky British parasite. Just remember that the very same American military you hate saved the as$es of your lazy, incompetent British ancestors who were on the verge of losing two World Wars to the Nazis until America stepped up to save the ungrateful British morons. Sad!
@Henderia93 @AshAgony GOOD. I'm delighted to hear that you hate America. STAY AWAY! Our country has enough problems, and the last thing we need is a parasite like you.

@SGMurdoch @honk4peace @LindsayMenz @alfranken @LeeannTweeden I'm not worried about them stealing my job. I'm worried about my tax dollars funding an array of benefits to illegal immigrants who broke our immigration laws and don't pay any income taxes.
@SGMurdoch @honk4peace @LindsayMenz @alfranken @LeeannTweeden You're a sick person. Al Franken, was caught on camera assaulting a sleeping woman; Roy Moore &amp; Trump face unconfirmed allegations which I I believe should be investigated. You, in contrast, defended a confirmed sexual predator. By your own standards you're the guy with skeletons
@SGMurdoch @honk4peace @LindsayMenz @alfranken @LeeannTweeden Apparently you don't like facts. Instead of responding to the facts and substance you engage in cheap ad hominem attacks.

@honk4peace @SGMurdoch @LindsayMenz @alfranken @LeeannTweeden "They let you do it" At most Trump admitted to consensual touching. However, he maintains that he was just talking dirty, AKA "locker room talk." Al Franken, in contrast, was caught on camera grabing a woman's breasts which is why he resigned.

@AboAlezswafery @realDonaldTrump You are not correct. Jerusalem isn't mentioned even once in the Koran. Muslims only recently decided that Jerusalem is their holy city, without any historical basis, because of their Anti-Semitic bigotry.
@AlfredWalters2 @jordan_gravelin I know, Franken is much worse because he is a confirmed sexual predator. Trump and Moore, in contrast, face unsubstantiated allegations. https://t.co/DDp5tH2nVX
