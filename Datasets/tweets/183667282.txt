End thread.
This is mostly a tribute to the rising popularity of C-SPAN's use of @TwitterVideo in less than 3 years. This trend demonstrates the rising value of Twitter video.
So, @RepAOC's speech is the most watched C-SPAN Twitter video from the House floor. It's currently C-SPAN's 7th most watched C-SPAN @TwitterVideo ever.		But if you rank all the videos on C-SPAN's three primary social platforms (Twitter, Facebook &amp; YouTube), it ranks 36th.
And let's not forget about Facebook and YouTube.		There are 11 C-SPAN Facebook videos with more than 2.36 million views.	https://t.co/dwaDFGlbjn		There are 17 C-SPAN YouTube videos with more than 2.36 million views. https://t.co/sduf6ZNdQI

In 2018, sixteen (16) C-SPAN Twitter videos had at least 1 million views. Six were #Kavanaugh related. Five featured POTUS. 7 of these had more than 2.36 million views. This was the most viewed: https://t.co/4W3ePz6dMD
In 2017, two (2) C-SPAN Twitter videos surpassed 1 million views:	From a James @Comey hearing https://t.co/fu9two9Tth	From a @SenBobCorker statement https://t.co/ChNV5oGnNb

@AmeliaFrappolli @dougalpollux @nielslesniewski @pkcapitol Based on my research, looks like there were no senators with a last name beginning with the letter A from 1818-1829 &amp; 1831-1836. 		So, if there's no Sen. Alexander in 2021 (&amp; no new A senators), it'll be the first time the Senate roll call begins after the letter A in 185 years.
@AmeliaFrappolli @dougalpollux @nielslesniewski @pkcapitol Nope. Sen. George Aiken served from 1941-1975.

@cspan @hasanminhaj Finally, I personally had two tweets that performed very well…(6/9)
@cspan @hasanminhaj In 2017, 18 videos had over 1 million views on C-SPAN's Facebook page.	Ten of these videos of from Congress (floor or hearings).	President Trump appears in 5 of these videos. (5/9) https://t.co/jIpqS1wTHR
@cspan No tweets from the night of the WHCA Dinner made #cspantop10 list, but here's top tweet from that night. Also, video of @hasanminhaj's complete remarks was the top video on C-SPAN's YouTube page this year (1.5 million views). https://t.co/1pdEqGXJvu	https://t.co/LpXCURBddf (4/9)
@cspan Nine of the #cspanTop10 tweets include video. Of these, only one is less than a minute in length. (3/9)
@cspan President Trump appears in none of the #cspantop10 tweets. In fact, this list would have to be expanded to the top 15 tweets for him to make the list with this tweet. (2/9) https://t.co/c06XHtyxrU
