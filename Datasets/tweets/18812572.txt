60 Minutes asked the White House for comment on McCabe’s claims and received this statement: “Andrew McCabe was fired in disgrace from the FBI for lying, and he opened a completely baseless investigation into the president. Everyone knows he has no credibility.”
“I believe I was fired because I opened a case against the President of the United States,” says McCabe, who lost his job just a day before he would have been able to collect his full pension. He is considering suing the government over this. https://t.co/9oNEXZi0GR https://t.co/MzmP4ej7XW

McCabe was fired from the FBI after a Justice Department investigation concluded that he had lied under oath about a leak to the Wall Street Journal. McCabe told Pelley he was confused by the investigators’ questions and distracted by the Comey crisis. (1/2)
“I knew...how perilous it was for the FBI to be investigating … the president himself,” McCabe said. “This was a situation that clearly called for the appointment of a special counsel.” Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller in May 2017. https://t.co/aQVpsS6qgO

“I think, like most people, I’ve become bored with President Trump and his tweets.” Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz tells 60 Minutes he is weighing a presidential run as an Independent, and he doesn’t care what the president has to say about it. https://t.co/nad8eKD3iE https://t.co/LhiEz3LgVA
Two retirees crack the code to state lotteries to the tune of millions? And they somehow do it legally? Jerry and Marge Selbee's remarkable story didn't just land them on 60 Minutes; they could be headed to Hollywood. https://t.co/ecHj4GafXt https://t.co/6D5IKvaAOV
The Selbees' adventure came to an end after 9 years. Their little company grossed more than $26M during that time. https://t.co/hSb2xSvCgZ
The Selbees' group and another group from MIT spent and won millions playing Cash Winfall, but in 2011, the Mass. state treasurer shut the game down. The State Inspector General at the time, Greg Sullivan, launched an investigation to see if there was anything illegal going on. https://t.co/b6R6yckaaf
Michigan unexpectedly shut down Winfall in the middle of the group’s winning streak. But the Selbees later found a similar game in Massachusetts. For 6 years, Jerry and Marge drove 900 miles each time there was a rolldown and bought hundreds of thousands of tickets. https://t.co/pnVj7i9wKn
“It helped me put three kids through school and one through law school,” said one member of Jerry and Marge Selbee’s lottery investment club. By 2005, the club’s 25 members had played 12 times and won millions. https://t.co/kiqE7Bczw6
Jerry tested his theory and then upped his bets. Soon he was playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars and invited friends and family to join his lottery club. https://t.co/RZUVbulXyR
The game had a feature called a “rolldown.” If the jackpot hit $5M and nobody matched all 6 numbers, the money would rolldown to those who matched 5, 4 or 3 numbers. During a rolldown, Jerry saw the odds were in his favor. (2/2) https://t.co/pCfO1xdAlg https://t.co/k0M1KwAdkv
Jerry Selbee and his wife, Marge, ran a local convenience store for 17 years until they retired in 2000. One day, in 2003, Jerry took notice when a new lottery game called Winfall came on the market. (½) https://t.co/HIeo4h2C3P

The NGA’s satellites are the equivalent of a Hubble Telescope and cost billions of dollars, which is one reason there are so few in orbit and why Planet Labs’ small satellites and their images are so valuable to the agency. https://t.co/VD8n8cewVi
President Obama and his national security team used seven years of satellite imagery to construct a scale model of Osama bin Laden’s hideout--the inside and the outside. https://t.co/66WN0MX7Dq https://t.co/5k6CzsJSaQ
The NGA won’t say how many high resolution satellites it operates, but amateur satellite tracker Ted Molczan has figured it out, using $300 binoculars. https://t.co/uHXattYItJ https://t.co/XJLWUjSP5I
Planet Labs sells its images to over 200 clients, many agricultural companies. But its most important client is the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, a government organization which uses images to support one of its missions, national security. https://t.co/gLeVxdsDhL
Launching so many satellites risks losing a lot of satellites. Four years ago Planet Labs lost 26 satellites when a launch vehicle exploded on takeoff. https://t.co/ALucFds5lO https://t.co/m1SxsJJ0Zn
Planet Labs has built over 300 satellites; the company launched 146 into space just last year. The little satellites orbit the globe taking photos every 90 minutes. https://t.co/3ELle3PSld

In the dead of winter, 60 Minutes went looking for wolves in Yellowstone National Park, and we weren’t alone. These fierce and feral animals are the darlings of tourists willing to endure frigid temperatures to catch a glimpse. https://t.co/tqnuMGYlpk https://t.co/VTWISaZZDI
Yellowstone wolf biologist Doug Smith says the park's wolves are safe within its boundaries, but that they're vulnerable if they wander on the outside. https://t.co/WPBcXYZCjo https://t.co/rujED9gUTF
The introduction of wolves has caused ranchers to lose cattle and sheep. Those losses were the reason wolves were initially eradicated. But now, there are nearly 2K wolves in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho where wolf hunting is legal. https://t.co/F1lbcWADy0 https://t.co/28xGGpxTzM
Without wolves, elk were overpopulated in Yellowstone. As wolves have cut the size of those herds, plants that elk feed on have made a comeback, which has produced benefits for other species. https://t.co/twghNzg4Xo
Each pack of wolves is tracked by a team of park officials. The packs are lead by an alpha male and an alpha female, which are the only two members of the group who mate with each other. https://t.co/3wnvrJ0hfK https://t.co/RuWTOeSbGO
The lifespan of a typical wolf in Yellowstone is five years. They are fierce and territorial; the leading cause of death is attack from other wolves. https://t.co/LCgy1TVLlB
Beginning in 1995, a total of 41 wolves were carried into Yellowstone over three years. When we visited, the park has 96 wolves in 10 packs. https://t.co/Xu6SDmK4PE
In the early 20th century, wolves were trapped, poisoned and hunted until not a single one was left in the American west. But in the 90s, they were reintroduced to Yellowstone where they’ve had an outsized impact on the park’s ecology. https://t.co/NOAgN66vDg

Former CIA officer Kevin Mallory denies sending any classified information to the Chinese. In June, a jury found him guilty of conspiracy under the espionage act and lying to the FBI. He is awaiting sentencing. https://t.co/ylSJEBdD3x
“When it comes to espionage, China poses the greatest threat.” Bill Evanina, the US government’s top intelligence official, says China poses a bigger threat than Russia and Iran. https://t.co/rXdeD27STi https://t.co/2eDfn8eRpg
The US currently has three cases pending against former US intelligence officers alleged to have been spying on behalf of the Chinese. The DOJ’s John Demers says: “It’s not unusual. It’s unprecedented.” https://t.co/rtvn749coV
Mallory began to fear he would get caught, prosecutors say, and reached out to the CIA with a cover story. He was called in for an interview and admitted his phone was a covert communication device–but lied about sending classified documents to China. https://t.co/SYeHHgjMdL https://t.co/TZATVddBJH
"Your object is to gain information and my object is to be paid for.” That’s what Kevin Mallory said to his Chinese contact via text from his cell phone. https://t.co/OCiqg4t3Tk https://t.co/NWUhTzjDWC
After he was approached by the Chinese, former CIA case officer Kevin Mallory reached out to former colleagues at the agency asking for contacts who had current intelligence on China. Those colleagues grew suspicious and reported him, which put him on law enforcement’s radar.
The Chinese reached out to Kevin Mallory as any job recruiter might, via LinkedIn. His profile basically screamed, “I was a former intelligence official.” https://t.co/F96hidS9tM https://t.co/2TDiMMf4I0
John Demers, the DOJ’s top national security official, says China’s Ministry of State Security—known as MSS and basically their version of the CIA and FBI combined—has world-class surveillance tools and capabilities. https://t.co/WZJCjEgROz
When Kevin Mallory was approached by the Chinese, he hadn’t worked for any intelligence agency in 5 years. But he spoke Mandarin, needed money and had access to national security information. Officials say he sent documents to a Chinese spy that could have put lives in danger. https://t.co/00UMufhcC7

Plastic can look like food sources to the Laysan albatross. US Fish and Wildlife scientists estimates the birds carry 5 tons of plastic back to Midway in their stomachs every year. https://t.co/RxEtnD9H0y
None of the plastic found on Midway originates there. It washes ashore. Our cameras found a shoreline strewn with bottles and buoys, crates and canisters. https://t.co/xCKtbsflj2 https://t.co/8ZBRzLIT21

There’s no way to monitor what happens to the plastic we ship to other countries—in many cases, we don’t know if it’s being recycled at all—which may be why Boyan Slat’s device is getting so much attention. But the scientists 60 Minutes talked to have doubts about its efficacy.
The 10% we do recycle ends up in facilities that--until recently--sent much of their plastic to China because it was cheaper. But China no longer wants to be the world’s trash dump, so plants have had to find new places for plastic, countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh. (2/2)
There are really only three things you can do with plastic once you're done with it: put it in a landfill, burn it or recycle it. But according to environmental scientist Roland Geyer, 90% of the plastic we’ve used never made it to a recycling bin. (½) https://t.co/5M83E7vYup

Sorkin expanded the roles of defendant Tom Robinson as well as Atticus’ housemaid Calpurnia, played by LaTanya Richardson Jackson, because “we understand now in 2018 that using African American characters as atmosphere in a story is offensive.” https://t.co/gDEYzCHobg https://t.co/vfSR1PGPbK
In the Broadway adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” the children’s roles of Scout, Jem and Dill are all played by adults looking back in time because the parts were too big and too difficult for child actors. https://t.co/vkXxCbBGid

Aaron Sorkin was approved to adapt “To Kill a Mockingbird” for Broadway by author Harper Lee herself before her death 3 years ago. https://t.co/ENbapc1IYr https://t.co/Pcxp7HOdid

Little Sunfish was a robot that had success. Using reactor No. 5, which did not meltdown, engineers were able to help plan Sunfish’s mission to look for the missing fuel. https://t.co/0SkgIGrqKg https://t.co/89pDe3BUdu
The radiation levels inside the reactors are so intense that even early iterations of the robots ran into problems—their electronics and cameras were fried.

No senior official would speak to 60 Minutes for this story, but the president ended his separation policy after 11 weeks. The White House says more than 2600 children were separated, but reports show that number is closer to 5000. https://t.co/PyiVQbZvfc
Cecilia Munoz says the Obama administration found that deterrent messages failed to turn back people at the border, even parents with children. “You're thinking much more about their safety today and tomorrow than...about, "What's going to happen once we get to our destination?"
The copy of the Homeland Security order to arrest and detain all adults who crossed the border illegally to seek asylum was censored. What the White House didn’t want the public to see was that child separation began 9 months earlier than initially acknowledged.
After Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney, convinced a federal judge to order the reunification of children with their parents, the government realized it had lost track of many parents. Then, the government told the court it was up to the ACLU to find them. https://t.co/DyYHUPRVIS
Dr. Pam McPherson inspects government detention facilities for Homeland Security.

Immers, the 3-year-old sent to Michigan when his father was incarcerated at the border, was reunited with his mother after 3 months. Immers has been withdrawn and moody, which psychologists say can result from the trauma of separation. (½)
Cecilia Munoz—who handled immigration policy in the Obama administration and has worked in the field for 30 years—says, “We take better care of people's effects when we send them to jail than we took care of the children who we took from their parents.” https://t.co/SmY94xtSmG https://t.co/W6CWjEbWep
A Homeland Security internal investigation obtained by 60 Minutes found, in part, that one border control station “made to no effort to identify and reunite families prior to (their) removal” from the US. https://t.co/sPsOzvPjpX
Scott Shuchart worked at Homeland Security HQ at the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Even he was surprised by President Trump’s new policy, saying when his office offered advice, it was ignored. https://t.co/LJpgkVaaEM https://t.co/vJSX6DGofy
Because children can’t be incarcerated, they are sent to child welfare facilities or foster families. Immers was sent to live with a foster family in Michigan. https://t.co/0JyDSaqeRR
Last spring, a Honduran father and his son, Immers, crossed the border illegally. They requested asylum, but Homeland Security issued arrest warrants for both—Immers was 3. https://t.co/LhWn5FyPJE

When Jaap van Zweden’s son Benjamin was diagnosed with autism as a young child, doctors said he would never talk. But music eventually helped him do just that. Since then, Jaap and his wife created a foundation offering music therapy and a home for young adults with autism. https://t.co/GD2s1vnoCn
Van Zweden admits he’s demanding and can be critical. Some musicians have said he scares them. Recalling one such instance, he says, “No, you are not afraid of me. You’re afraid of yourself. You did not prepare well, and then blame it on me.”
Jaap van Zweden might never have become a conductor if it weren’t for Leonard Bernstein, the legendary composer and the most famous American maestro at the New York Philharmonic. He first told van Zweden to pick up a baton, and it didn’t go well. https://t.co/mLRfzpvvky https://t.co/MQBybHTrOd

How did a woman from Oklahoma City end up in with nomads Mongolia learning to hunt with “modern day Velociraptors?” Ah well, I read a book on falconry. And it’s like the fire was lit.” Lauren McGough gives 60 Minutes a front row seat to an ancient art. https://t.co/VpQGg3SRH8 https://t.co/sRlx8lil1t
What does falconer Lauren McGough say to those who suggested the eagles are being abused? “We only encourage their natural instincts. The only difference is you’re right there. You have a front row seat to see this incredible million-year-old predator-prey relationship.” https://t.co/wsekkgdx0y
The only eagles worth partnering with are female. They’re larger, stronger and better hunters: Their talons can close in on prey with a force of 900 pounds per square inch. https://t.co/PFD4bk8aFs
According to falconer Lauren McGough, eagles are incredibly effective at killing, a “modern day Velociraptor, a perfect product of evolution.” https://t.co/gjILVihe7t
It’s a technique well over 1000 years old—hunters train eagles with a fox pelt tugged by a rope. When the bird zeroes in on the fox and makes the kill, the hunter rides in and strips the pelt. The meat goes to the eagle.
How did a woman from Oklahoma City end up living with nomadic Kazakh eagle hunters in Mongolia? Says falconer Lauren McGough: “I read a book on falconry. And it’s like a fire was lit.” McGough earned a PhD based on her work with the eagle hunters.
Nomads on the Mongolian Steppe depend on animals for nearly all of their food, fiber, clothing and fuel. One of the oldest bonds in nature is the alliance of survival among hunters and golden eagles.

Are users unwittingly being used as genetic informants on their relatives? Genetic Genealogy—first used by police in the “The Golden State Killer” case—is so new, it’s impossible to predict the consequences. None of the cases have gone to trial, and no one has plead guilty.
The support for genetic genealogy among law enforcement is virtually unanimous. But cautionary questions are being raised by civil rights groups and bioethicists about the reliability of crime scene DNA and the lack of standards and protocol.

Senator Susan Collins tells 60 Minutes she feels “very comfortable” with her decision to vote "yes" on Brett Kavanaugh—and what it may mean for women’s reproductive rights. https://t.co/RWUtXvihn8
"That's not someone I want sitting on the bench." Senator Heidi Heitkamp says she thought Brett Kavanaugh’s conduct during his confirmation hearing showed he does not have the right temperament to be on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/pbTijsM9Ih
Chef Bottura doesn’t only cater to the fine dining set. Partnering with local charities and grocery stores, he’s opened six “reffettorios”— think souped-up soup kitchens— where the homeless, the working poor and refugees dine side by side.
A tasting menu at Bottura’s restaurant consists of 10 or 12 courses and can cost over $500 when paired with wine. Dishes include a version of a caesar salad that takes two chefs to build and features 27 elements. https://t.co/IB1SkftQGV

Judge Kavanaugh’s was the closest vote for confirmation to the Supreme Court since 1881. Senators. Susan Collins and Heidi Heitkamp cast 2 of the key votes—for and against. The Republican and Democratic Senators explain their politically-risky decisions. https://t.co/1Yn6q14fmK https://t.co/6hfSoqsutp
“I could not vote for a judge who had demonstrated hostility to Roe v. Wade,” Sen. Collins says, adding that Judge Kavanaugh told her, “he views precedent not just as legal doctrine, but as rooted in our constitution.”
“Do I have work that I want to continue to do? Absolutely. Do I want to compromise my principles and compromise my conscience for that job? No. And do I want to compromise the Supreme Court for that job? No.” —Sen. Heitkamp on voting against Judge Kavanaugh in an election year.
Sen. Heitkamp is now up for reelection in North Dakota, where, in August, Judge Kavanaugh’s support was at 60%. Says Sen. Heitkamp of her vote against: “I don’t think there’s any doubt … the politically expedient vote here was a ‘yes’ vote.”
Sen. Collins—who won’t face reelection until 2020—knows her Kavanaugh vote is unpopular with many in her home state of Maine: “I did try not to weigh a political calculus to this decision. It’s too important for that.”
“I have had to have security because of threats against me and family members and staffers, and this has been unlike anything I have ever been through,” says Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine about the Kavanaugh confirmation process. https://t.co/HrAzoAqQtO
Next on 60 Minutes, Senators Susan Collins and Heidi Heitkamp explain how they arrived at opposite views of Judge Kavanaugh’s fitness for a place on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/glQYgE51sz https://t.co/EFplzzVthk

A project including Dutch-inspired designs to prevent storm damage and flooding for Hoboken, Weehawken and Jersey City, NJ is set to break ground next year. It could be the first big test for Henk Ovink’s vision in the United States. https://t.co/1ix3IYVdDa
Henk Ovink was an advisor to President Obama’s task force after Hurricane Sandy. In that role, he helped develop Rebuild by Design, a competition awarding almost $1 billion for innovative solutions in the region--to rebuild with a Dutch philosophy: for the future. https://t.co/dQIcN90AbG
Henk Ovink and the Netherlands advocate multi-function approaches to storm and flood mitigation--a world class rowing facility doubles as a flood reservoir; a basketball court can hold almost 450K gallons of rainwater; man-made dunes on a beach house a parking garage. https://t.co/gnr9puZv9i
No one has died from flooding in the Netherlands since 1953. Water is in the Dutch DNA. 97 percent of Dutch children earn swim diplomas showing they can swim the length of a pool in clothes and shoes (in case of emergency) by the time they are 6.

Businessman and rancher John Hume believes rhino poachers will be all but gone if his plan works, driven away by the legal sale of cheaper rhino horns. He thinks he can save the species from extinction by having his rhino give up life in the wild for life on his farm. #60Minutes
Poaching also causes collateral damage: orphans. Baby rhino who should be in the wild are being raised in orphanages because their mothers were killed. https://t.co/Eixt031OGw https://t.co/jR9pLewjKx
John Hume says selling his rhino horn is the best way to protect his 1500 rhino. But this has made him a detested figure in the conservation community. Veterinarian Jacques Flamand--who has been working to relocate rhino for 15 years--says selling horns isn’t the answer. https://t.co/1o0SFkFtZd
It’s common practice in South Africa to remove rhino horns to turn off poachers. There are no nerve endings, and the horns grow back in a few years. South African John Hume wants to sell the horns from his rhino farm. He says the money helps him protect his herd.
The rhino horn is made of nothing more than keratin, the main component in our fingernails. But in Vietnam and China, the horn is prized as a remedy for hangovers and a way to increase virility. Ground into powder it can be worth more by the ounce than gold.

The NYPD confirms to #60Minutes that there is an ongoing criminal investigation into Mario Batali. https://t.co/KIwBwHJsfQ
Spotted Pig manager Jamie Seet says one night in 2008 she was counting receipts and saw Mario Batali sexually touching a woman who appeared to be unconscious on the restaurant’s security camera. She and other employees stopped him. https://t.co/d52C4VTbx2
Batali said in his statement, in response to the story from 2005, “I vehemently deny the allegation that I sexually assaulted this woman.” (2/2)
A woman who worked at Mario Batali’s restaurant Babbo says she believes “something very wrong” happened to her on the 3rd floor of The Spotted Pig in 2005. She later called a crisis hotline and went to the hospital. (1/2)
Mario Batali says in a statement to 60 Minutes, “my past behavior has been deeply inappropriate and I am sincerely remorseful for my actions.”
A spokesman for Ken Friedman says he “vehemently denies any non-consensual activity.” In a statement, Ken Friedman says in part, “over the past several months I have focused … on my own personal decisions and my mistakes for which I have apologized.”
Spotted Pig co-owner, chef April Bloomfield says in a statement “I am in the final stages of severing my partnership with Ken Friedman. I deeply regret not doing more to protect by staff, who relied on me.”
Mario Batali, Ken Friedman and his Spotted Pig co-owner April Bloomfield declined 60 Minutes’ requests for interviews. Friedman has taken a leave of absence from the business. In Dec., Batali was removed from his TV show, and is leaving the company he founded.

The Theranos deception: How a company with a blood-testing machine that could never perform as touted went from billion-dollar baby to complete bust. https://t.co/AdJcBD2SfH
Was the media duped by Elizabeth Holmes? A conversation with 60 Minutes about media coverage of the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and her hot startup, Theranos. https://t.co/Izo651EMJk
Elizabeth Holmes settled with the SEC without admitting guilt and paid a half a million dollar fine. She remains CEO of Theranos. A federal criminal investigation is ongoing. #60Minutes
In 2016, after a series of surprise inspections, federal regulators shut down Theranos’ lab saying it posed “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.” Nearly 1M test results were invalidated.
John Carreyrou, who publicly outed Elizabeth Holmes in the Wall Street Journal in 2015 and later wrote a book about the Theranos saga, says, the board “did nothing to verify that her scientific claims were true.”
Theranos employees were required to sign NDAs, which is why when Tyler Shultz alerted authorities in 2014, he used an alias. https://t.co/EQRHOEWdoJ
Elizabeth Holmes took on the trappings of power. She bragged that bullet-proof windows had been installed in her office, and she travelled with the full-time security detail that formerly protected James Mattis when he was commander of CENTCOM
Theranos employees told #60Minutes they were instructed to give fake demos for investors. Investors’ blood would be taken in rooms filled with Theranos machines, but tested behind closed doors by scientists and commercial analyzers.
Another former Theranos lab associate says the Edison often gave contradictory blood test results, and Theranos would send those faulty results to Walgreens patients. https://t.co/0M3tao86T7
Holmes claimed her invention performed all the tests big lab machines could--from cholesterol to cancer--all from a painless finger prick. But Tyler Shultz says the machine he saw didn’t work. https://t.co/VY2Tu45e63 https://t.co/DV66LfsCvy
Elizabeth Holmes claimed her blood tests would cost a fraction of current prices, and she was backed by an illustrious board packed with heavyweights like Henry Kissinger and James Mattis. https://t.co/2A57GpJK6N
Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz—who recruited his friends to Theranos’ board—introduced his grandson Tyler to Elizabeth Holmes. Tyler Shultz joined Theranos after graduating from Stanford with a degree in biology.
Elizabeth Holmes built Theranos on an invention she named the Edison. It’s a miniaturized blood analyzer she called the iPod of healthcare, and it made her a celebrity. #60Minutes

Warthogs in love? Online matchmaking comes to the zoo. To get a good genetic match and avoid inbreeding, zoos are choosing their animals’ mates with the help of a massive online database. https://t.co/ASFmWfhn8R
https://t.co/hoaqxsGjBr at the zoo? Lesley Stahl tells 60 Minutes Overtime about this week's story of conservation—and controversy. https://t.co/qHQzyTr94z
Zoos today are creating the next generation through a mix of science, software and genetics that helps each animal find its best match for mating. But the practice comes with some moral dilemmas. https://t.co/A8EZhmO8HY
In the US, culling isn’t explicitly banned by the Zoo Association, but it’s not widespread. It is a touchy subject, but it is being discussed. Two published papers in the journal “Zoo Biology” explore possible advantages to selective culling.
The European breeding program didn’t have a spot for Marius, so the zoo thought their only choice was to euthanize the giraffe. (2/2) https://t.co/Yt4P6FkHd9
Marius, a giraffe born at the Copenhagen Zoo 6 years ago, needed to be moved when he turned 2. He started challenging his father to take over the harem of females. The zoo says his father would have killed  him if he stayed. (½)
It’s not that difficult to place female giraffes because one dominant male lives and breeds with several females. But for young males, it’s tough, particularly for ones whose parents have bred well. Their genes aren’t considered valuable. https://t.co/6RSCvv5zuq
The Copenhagen Zoo is against birth control. They believe animals should be allowed to breed and raise their young just as they would in the wild. But that means offspring who need new homes in other zoos once they reach adolescence to avoid inbreeding.
At the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, some of the gorillas are on birth control--the same stuff humans take. Chicago’s Brookfield Zoo gets theirs from Walgreens. #60Minutes https://t.co/hHxa6ShgMF
Zoo genetic matchmaking isn’t just success stories. There are dilemmas and moral quandaries. A few years ago the Copenhagen Zoo killed a healthy 2-year-old giraffe who didn’t get a breeding recommendation. It caused an international uproar.
Zoos are also now working on conservation with wildlife agencies, as well. The last remaining Mexican Gray Wolves were brought to zoos to see if they could bring the species back from 7. It worked. There are now about 250 of the wolves, many now back in the wild.
For animals that live all together in big groups, like penguins or flamingos, zoo managers have recommended pairings. If an undesirable pair mates, keepers sometimes employ a practice called “egg management.” https://t.co/sOUwm3XHPS
Software provides, for example, a list of every gorilla in an accredited North American zoo with a family tree tracing its ancestry back to the wild, as well as a genetic ranking. It then tells the genetic value of any pair of animals from 1 (best) to 6 (should never breed).
Geneticist Bob Lacy of the Chicago Zoological Society and colleagues developed software now used worldwide to assess animals’ lineages and calculate ideal couplings to make sure all genetic lines remain in the mix. https://t.co/UEIyBVTKeb
Population management started in the 1970s when zoos largely stopped getting animals from the wild. They realized they had to manage populations themselves, but didn’t want to risk inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity.
Zoo animals travel the country to mate with their ideal genetic matches. When #60Minutes visited the Detroit Zoo, a warthog was about to take a 9-hour drive to his prospective love interest in Maryland. https://t.co/t6jOkgSnxv
All living creatures are biologically programmed to mate, but you might be surprised to learn that long before babies are born in zoos, a group of population biologists search out the best genetic matches for just about every zoo animal in North America. #60Minutes https://t.co/Oi0sxovxfT

Pope Francis’ progressiveness frustrates some traditionalists. He’s criticized the Vatican’s bloated bureaucracy, and when discussing the Catholic Church’s unrelenting sex abuse scandals, the pope was angry, saying, “Towards pedophilia, zero tolerance!” https://t.co/fPNZ0IdJs7
.@ThePopeMovie director Wim Wenders interviewed the pope 4 times for more than 8 hours total. Wenders’ face was projected on a screen in front of the lens, so the pope could look at him face-to-face.
“Families have difficulties. Families, we quarrel. Sometimes plates can fly. And children bring headaches. I won’t speak about mother-in-laws.” --Pope Francis to a conference celebrating family in Philadelphia. https://t.co/emgZhJ3XzW
This pope speaks openly of evolution, and says, “the biblical story of creation is a mythical form of expression.” He likens the neglect of the earth to the neglect of the poor. https://t.co/MhUieY8EIJ
Pope Francis himself gave the green light on Wim Wenders’ new film and agreed to be the star. In a series of unprecedented interviews, the pope spoke spontaneously on matters both spiritual and material. https://t.co/ZSM1PBugzp

Is shock therapy making a comeback? For people with treatment-resistant depression, a controversial therapy gains ground and leads to innovation.	https://t.co/7IT1iLQHAp
Starting this year, doctors are comparing ECT and MST in the first large coordinated trial by the National Institute of Mental Health. It will span five years and involve more than 250 patients. #60Minutes
A 2015 study that compared ECT and Dr. Lisanby’s magnetic treatment found that “ECT-induced acute memory disruption … is absent after MST.” Dr. Lisanby says MST would be “another tool in the toolbox” for treating depression. (2/2) https://t.co/3hqrVGiebp
ECT does carry a disturbing side effect, memory loss. In an attempt to solve that problem Dr. Sarah Lisanby has developed an experimental treatment called magnetic seizure therapy or MST that uses magnets instead of electricity to induce the seizure. (½)
For most depressed patients, ECT involves about 8 to 12 treatments over several weeks. Over the past 20 years, Kitty Dukakis has undergone ECT more than 100 times. https://t.co/olbTLw64Bd
Kitty Dukakis tried medications--unsuccessfully--for 17 years before trying ECT to treat her depression. In her case, the results were immediate. https://t.co/dehxDB2nGx
Shortly after her husband, Governor Michael Dukakis, ran unsuccessfully for president in 1988, Kitty was treated for alcoholism, but her drinking masked an underlying chronic depression.
One of the most outspoken advocates for ECT is former first lady of Massachusetts, Kitty Dukakis. She first had the treatment almost 20 years ago. https://t.co/YiVgkKcQes
Dr. Sarah Lisanby of the National Institute of Mental Health says ECT is “not something you have to be afraid of, and so many of my patients, after they’ve had ECT, say to me ‘why did I wait so long to do this?” #60Minutes
ECT may work wonders for patients suffering from depression, but only about 1% of the people who could benefit from it end up trying it. #60Minutes
Electroconvulsive therapy--long considered a last resort--works by inducing a one-minute seizure, which the patient doesn’t feel because of muscle relaxants and general anesthesia. https://t.co/1yCAd3wk3Y
“It’s not uncommon for someone to have tried 20 or 30 different medications by the time they come to see me,” Dr. Sarah Lisanby of the National Institute of Mental Health says, adding, “imagine how that would magnify your hopelessness.” https://t.co/Pm73VcJq4C

The FDA looked into Boston Scientific’s experience with Chinese plastic. The FDA declined an interview, but wrote, “we did not find any indication that the change in (plastic) resin led to an increase in adverse events.” https://t.co/SpUAEdT2Rf
Boston Scientific eventually purchased plastic purported to be produced by Chevron Phillips via a Chinese broker. Chevron Phillips told Boston Scientific three times that the lot numbers on the bags from China were wrong. https://t.co/UxCKBh1SqX
In 2005, Chevron Phillips cut off Boston Scientific’s supply of its polypropylene plastic. When the company later appealed, Chevron Phillips replied, “we are simply not interested in this business at any price.” https://t.co/82oHOcE570
Boston Scientific uses polypropylene in its gynecological mesh. Duane Priddy told #60Minutes Oxygen breaks up the material. The plastic’s antioxidant properties dissipate over time. (2/2)
“I can’t in my wildest imagination imagine anybody that’s knowledgeable in the science of plastics ever deciding that it was appropriate to use polypropylene in the human body.” --Duane Priddy, a leading engineer and fellow of the American Chemical Society (½)
Boston Scientific declined an interview with #60Minutes, but told us, in part, “we have extensively tested the (plastic) resin to confirm its composition, safety and performance.” https://t.co/NDGYGcJ39Q

People often mistake Tom Mangelsen’s photos for paintings. Since the 1970s, he’s sold them out of galleries. His photo “Catch of the Day” is often called “the most famous wildlife photograph in the world.” #60Minutes https://t.co/Tvha1WWUqQ
Whether it’s a grizzly bear with battle scars, a cheetah chasing its prey or butterflies sipping the tears of a giant caiman, each of Tom Mangelsen’s photographs tells a story. On every continent, in every season, he’s built a reputation on patience.
Tom Mangelsen has spent nearly 50 years photographing wild animals. And though he says the amount of time he’s spent waiting is “stupid,” he says he’s learned if “you wait long enough, it does pay off.” #60Minutes

For viewers who were moved by tonight's 60 Minutes story about children orphaned by war in Syria:  It's virtually impossible for Americans to adopt the kids-- but there are ways to help them. https://t.co/SeZ9qsqWfY
The Turkish government is moving to regulate emergency orphanages. After 60 Minutes’ visit, Yazan Shishakly was told he could only provide daycare, so his children now sleep elsewhere. He told us he plans to expand his school now to teach 200 Syrian kids. https://t.co/fdQDjGL4PJ
Elaph Yassin has run out of money for the apartment building and moved her orphans to new, less expensive quarters. #60Minutes
Yakzan Shishakly says he had no experience in humanitarian work before first starting a refugee camp, and then building a school and an orphanage--named “My House”--where 60 children live within sight of the Syrian border.
Yakzan Shishakly @yakzanshishakly, the grandson of a former Syrian president, opened his own orphanage. He had owned an air conditioning business in Houston where he lived for more than a decade and became a US citizen.
Escaping Syria doesn’t mean safety. In the streets of neighboring countries, including Turkey, some children are pressed into labor; some are sexually assaulted. One orphaned boy #60Minutes met fled the war by himself at 10. That was 5 years ago. He’s now an addict.
Fatima, one of the children in Elaph Yassin’s orphanage, Karim, was in the hospital for a year after shrapnel lacerated her liver and broke her back. Her father had been killed in Aleppo, and her mother was unable to care for her and her brothers. https://t.co/r25NehZqnR
Elaph Yassin @elaph1 is a Syrian correspondent for Al Jazeera who decided she needed to do more than cover the story. In 2015, with the help of a wealthy friend, she converted an apartment building in Turkey--about 35 miles from Syria--into an orphanage. https://t.co/Tc5J62esE8
Syria’s orphans are often children who have been rescued after attacks that kill brothers, sisters and parents. No one knows how many orphans there are. Conservative estimates start at 100,000.
In 2016, children in an Aleppo orphanage were forced by bombs to live underground for 5 months. In a smuggled video, they begged for help. 10-year-old Yasmeen Qanouz spoke for them, saying in part, “this might be the last time you see and hear me.”

Acthar costs are taking a bite out of Medicare, which in 2015 paid $.5B for the drug, even though there’s little evidence it’s the best drug for the illnesses for which it was prescribed. https://t.co/dOO07t7vNY
Mallinckrodt declined 60 Minutes’s interview request, but sent an email saying it had invested in new research and development for Acthar.
The FTC found that to keep the price of Acthar high, Mallinckrodt bought Acthar’s main competitor, Synacthen. Synacthen costs $33 in Canada.
Rockford, IL, sued Mallinckrodt, the maker of the Acthar, claiming price fixing. The company denies the charge and says the biggest price increases were implemented by the drug’s previous owner, Questcor.
“It’s absolute secrecy. There’s an absolute opaque system of pricing for drugs in our country,” says a former mayor about his efforts to understand his town’s rising health care costs.
Acthar is used to treat a rare, potentially fatal condition called infantile spasms that afflicts about 2K babies a year. It used to be sold for $40 a vial. Today? More than $40K. An increase of 100K%.
In 2015, Rockford, Illinois’s healthcare costs were “out of control” due to Acthar, a drug administered to two infants, says the former mayor. Total cost: nearly $500K. https://t.co/17k7FVEkGN
“Everybody's asking the question: ‘Why is healthcare so expensive?’ Because the fix is in... That's the short answer,” says the former mayor of Rockford, IL.

Blanched in 170-degree water, kelp turns a vivid green and can then be sold fresh or frozen, sometimes as noodles. Bren Smith’s customers include Google for their cafeteria, Yale and several restaurants.
A former industrial fisherman, Bren Smith turned to seaweed farming at the suggestion of a marine biology professor after overfishing and hurricanes sunk his fishing career. https://t.co/2w7LoRcP7Y
It takes 5 or 6 months for Bren Smith’s seaweed to grow. He farms it on a 20-acre plot of water he began leasing from CT in 2012. His was the first commercial seaweed farm in the state. Now, there are 9, with more in the works.
Bren Smith, the nation’s leading advocate for ocean farming, says his staple crop--a type of seaweed called sugar kelp--is a zero-input crop, meaning it doesn’t need fertilizer or fresh water.

Our DNA is made up of chemical bases abbreviated by the letters A, T, C and G. A mutation that causes disease reads like a typo in those genetic instructions. If scientists can identify the typo, they can program CRISPR to try to correct it.
For the past 7 years, Feng Zhang has been working on CRISPR at the Broad Institute where some of the brightest minds from Harvard and MIT are on a mission to fight disease. They predict the gene-editing tool will help them tackle diseases like cancer. https://t.co/G1ehh0IhWV

After years of telling us he would never put Carol in a nursing home, he decided to do so for her safety.
According to the Alzheimer’s Association, the vast majority of caregivers say their toughest challenge is emotional stress. Mike’s health has suffered, and he says he even considered suicide.
Last year, Carol was unable to communicate, spending most of her days sitting quietly. But she was able to hum along to music when a social worker played some of her old favorites, which was emotional for Mike.
Mike eventually reached the point where he could not care for Carol by himself. He hired a home care aide costing nearly $40K per year.
By 2014, Carol couldn’t remember her last name or her husband’s first name. Alzheimer’s wasn’t affecting just her brain, it was destroying more of her physical abilities. https://t.co/wn4lYt7B9e
By 2011, Mike, a former NYC cop, had to apply Carol’s makeup and dress her. He told us this was his chance to repay Carol for all she had done for him. https://t.co/rFpfcDW5cl
But as Carol’s memory deteriorated, she lost her job, and she couldn’t cook. Unable to concentrate, she also had to give up reading and movies.
When we first met Mike and Carol Daly a decade ago, Carol had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, but she was active, conversational and determined to make the best of her failing memory.

"I'm sincerely sorry." Aleksandr Kogan says he’s come to see the error of his ways, "…what we did was not right and was not wise." https://t.co/4EsG20ggb6
Kogan did research and consulting for Facebook in 2013 and 2015 although, in a statement to #60Minutes, Facebook said: “At no point during these two years was Facebook aware of Kogan’s activities with Cambridge Analytica.”
Facebook deleted Kogan’s account, but never took action against Kogan’s co-worker on the Cambridge Analytica study, Joseph Chancellor. Chancellor works at Facebook. https://t.co/mveDKWmYiH
Facebook shut down Kogan’s app in December, 2015, but only after it was exposed in the press. The company didn’t start notifying the tens of millions of users whose data had been scraped until this month.
Facebook’s developer policy clearly states data cannot be sold, but Kogan says nobody reads these privacy sign-offs. Kogan’s own terms of service included language saying his app could sell the data.
Two weeks ago, Zuckerberg testified about Facebook’s years of failing to protect users’ data before Congress. In his defense, he pointed the finger at Aleksandr Kogan, saying Kogan was “in violation of his agreement with us.”
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg turned down 60 Minutes’ interview request. Eventually the company did change its policy. App developers can no longer use "friend permissions" to gather data from users’ friends without their consent.
Facebook should’ve been aware of how friend permissions could be abused because they were repeatedly warned, including by Sandy Parakilas, who used to be a manager in charge of protecting data at the company. He says he raised concerns years before Kogan built his app. #60Minutes
Kogan estimates tens of thousands of developers accessed personal data via Facebook in the same way he did through a feature called "friend permissions."
Kogan was able to collect information like the location, gender, birthday, page “likes” of any user who took his survey and authorized his app, as well as the personal information of their Facebook friends.
He failed to disclose that what he was really after was access to their friends and that he was doing the survey for Cambridge Analytica which used the material to influence people on how to vote. (2/2) #60Minutes https://t.co/lkVaiENxTd
In order to get their data, Kogan asked Facebook users to take a survey he designed from which he built psychological profiles meant to predict their behavior. (½)

Whenever Marc Benioff and Salesforce acquire a new company, their team needs to do another internal audit to re-adjust pay gaps because they exist in much of the male-dominated tech industry. https://t.co/0FGjisVA6h
Kullman says unconscious bias is a major problem. At Dupont, Kullman says women were getting promoted in 30-36 months to the same kind of jobs men were getting every 18-24. Some companies are now offering employees unconscious bias training.
Former Dupont CEO Ellen Kullman who now co-chairs an organization of women pushing for equality in the corporate world says senior leadership in all companies should be 50% women.
"There's a cultural phenomenon where women are paid less. And the World Economic Forum says that it'll take more than 100 years for us to pay men and women equally. So we better get going now." --Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on his company's decision to correct its gender pay gap
Salesforce says it spent about $3 million making corrections in the first year they realized the pay gap. More than 10% of women working there got bigger paychecks.
Benioff and Salesforce commissioned an internal audit and realized they did have a persistent pay gap between men and women doing the same job. https://t.co/kQYXVIn0iS
“It’s impossible because we have a great culture here. We’re a best place to work. We don’t do that kinda thing.” --Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recalls being shocked to find out his company might have a gender pay gap in 2015. https://t.co/lvWZaDz7Kb
According to the census bureau, A woman made 60 cents for every $1 made by a man in 1960. In 2000, that gap had been narrowed by just a dime. And it's taken nearly 2 decades more to shave another dime off. Today, women still make an avg. of 20% less than their male counterparts.

Flyer beware? 60 Minutes' Allegiant Air investigation: Steve Kroft talks with 60 Minutes Overtime about safety concerns aboard Allegiant Air. https://t.co/yzoKWVUkwx https://t.co/cRXAd8Rc7v
It must be noted that there has been a sharp drop-off in the No. of Allegiant’s service difficulty reports since 60 Minutes notified the airline and the FAA a story was in the works. It may have to do with the fact that Allegiant has replaced 10 of its old MD-80s.
After our interview, the FAA overruled Allegiant’s objections to the FOIA request and produced the mechanical interruption summary reports. They showed, on avg., the airline was nearly 3.5x more likely to have mid-air breakdowns than American, United, Delta, JetBlue and Spirit.
60 Minutes filed a FOIA request with the FAA asking for more than a year’s worth of mechanical interruption summary reports from Allegiant and 7 other airlines. We received the documents from every airline except Allegiant. https://t.co/qrLFXPbSD9
Coverage by @TB_Times prodded the FAA to undertake a review of Allegiant’s operations in April, 2016. The FAA concluded there were no serious deficiencies. The FAA also says it’s been monitoring the airline ever since without noticing any systemic problems.
60 Minutes asked John Duncan, the FAA’s executive director of flight standards about the more than 100 serious mechanical incidents the production team found in a 22-month period ending last October. https://t.co/8i2zn3ljnb
Over the last 3 years, the FAA has switched its priorities from actively enforcing safety rules with fines, warning letters and sanctions--which become part of public record--to working quietly behind the scenes with airlines to fix the problems.
Last July, Allegiant flight 533 may have returned to service before the plane was ready. Passengers told 60 Minutes they contacted their loved ones to say goodbye before safely landing. https://t.co/R8jClkcSXA
Daniel Wells, a captain for Atlas Air, with 30 years experience, is president of teamsters union 1224 which reps pilots from Allegiant and 9 other airlines. He says Allegiant’s problems are “outside the norm for sure.”
“All of us at Allegiant are proud of our strong safety record,” Allegiant said in a statement to #60Minutes. “Safety is at the forefront of our minds and the core of our operations.”
Between Jan. 1, 2016 and the end of Oct., 2017, 60 Minutes found more than 100 serious mechanical incidents filed by Allegiant with the FAA. We also found that Allegiant reported 60 unscheduled landings and 46 in-flight emergencies.
Allegiant has some of the lowest fares, the least frills and the oldest fleet in the airline business. Right now, nearly 30% of its planes are antiquated, gas-guzzling MD-80s, all of them purchased second-hand.

Longtime SNL writer Jim Downey, class of ‘74, cuts a mythical figure within Harvard Lampoon circles. He told #60Minutes the story of an old joke. https://t.co/flPaRztWES
Early generations of the Lampoon count William Randolph Hearst and George Plimpton. The modern era produced Conan O’Brien and SNL’s Colin Jost.
A few days after candidate Trump sat in the Crimson’s chair, Waddick and the Lampoon got a call from the candidate’s personal attorney Michael Cohen saying they could be expelled. They weren’t.
Occasionally the Lampoon pulls off an epic prank. Current senior Tom Waddick may have set a new standard by tricking candidate Donald Trump to sit in a chair stolen from student newspaper--and frequent target--The Harvard Crimson. The ruse? The Crimson endorsed Mr. Trump. https://t.co/PyuzN0Gayg
The Lampoon serves as a first writer’s room for students who aspire to a career in comedy. Just as iron sharpens iron, here, irony sharpens irony. #60Minutes
Officially, members major in everything at Harvard from math to poetry but the Lampoon is their real area of concentration. Take Alice Ju, philosophy student and former Lampoon President who says 99% of her time is dedicated to the club. https://t.co/HnLsoOfZiG
Lampoon compers are tasked with one big challenge: Can they make their upperclassmen judges laugh? Only the funniest survive. Out of about 100 pledges last semester, six made the cut.
Akin to rushing a fraternity, Lampoon pledges are called compers for the competencies they’ll have to demonstrate before landing a spot on the magazine staff and literally scoring keys to the HQ--an actual castle.

Stevenson wants people to understand that lynchings were not just brutal footnotes in history. They reflected a belief in racial differences that reinforced segregation in the ‘50s and ‘60s, and, he says, has resulted in a pattern of unequal justice today. #60Minutes.
As cases mounted, Stevenson wanted to do something to commemorate the victims. His team bought six acres of land and started construction on a memorial to the victims of lynching. https://t.co/jVa83dmQFI
Stevenson’s team @eji_org started their investigation in Alabama, where they’ve found evidence of 361 lynchings between 1877 and 1947. But soon they uncovered accounts from throughout the south and beyond.
In 1993, Bryan Stevenson founded “The Equal Justice Initiative,” @eji_org, a legal advocacy group focused on defending the poor and powerless. But 10 years ago, he turned his attention to also investigating the crimes of the past--the lynchings of African Americans.
So far, Stevenson’s team has chronicled over 4,300 lynchings. They continue to find more. In nearly every case, there was no evidence. Just an accusation was enough. #60Minutes

When compared to brains of civilians who had injured their brains in car wrecks, Perl found scarring in the veterans’ brains that didn’t show up for the civilians. He discovered a previously unknown form of brain injury. https://t.co/Rc8ljcwGhm
Perl and his team examined brain tissue from eight veterans with a microscope he says is thousands of times more powerful than the best MRI.
The Mancinis found neuropathologist Dr. Daniel Perl who oversees the brain tissue repository at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences @USUHS, the military medical school in Maryland.
Last year, Mancini donated his life savings to his church. He then drove to a remote canal and shot himself in the head. The betrayal of his mind had been so sudden and shocking that his family wanted his brain tissue studied.
But as he reached his peak in 2015, Mancini suddenly began to suffer delusions. He imagined the government was spying on him, that members of the Honor House board were with the CIA. And he thought he was being tracked with cell phones.
After his recovery, Mancini founded “Honor House” to provide wounded vets with therapies that helped him--including yoga, acupuncture and fly fishing.
In 2011, Mancini told 60 Minutes about his recovery: “I have a titanium mesh plate in my forehead. They rebuilt my whole orbital socket. My sinuses were replaced or rebuilt.” He couldn’t remember how many surgeries he’d had.
Mancini made a nearly miraculous recovery from the impact of a roadside bomb in Iraq. 60 Minutes followed him back to Iraq on a therapy program designed to help veterans come to terms with the day they were wounded and leave that day behind.

Giannis was invited to the NBA draft in June of 2013. He didn’t even know he was supposed to wear a suit, but the Bucks selected him 15th overall. #60Minutes https://t.co/5me4YcPDsa
Playing in a dingy gym for less than $500 a month--and even sharing shoes with his brother in the same game--Giannis was discovered and signed by an agent after a grainy video of him was posted online in 2013.
Giannis’ parents emigrated to Greece from Nigeria. They had no papers and lived in tiny apartments. There was rarely enough food. To make money, the family peddled goods on the streets. https://t.co/VdTY14dLL4
Because of Giannis, the once lousy Bucks are back in the NBA conversation. The Greek Freak has also given Milwaukee a marketing foothold in the global basketball business. Bucks President Peter Feigin says more than 50% of the team’s digital traffic comes from abroad. https://t.co/U9F0YPDQY7
Already a two-time All Star, Giannis is listed as a forward, but plays every position from point guard to center. He leads the Bucks in points, rebounds and assists.
Giannis says it takes him just six steps to get down the full court. From the foul line? “Maybe none. I can jump from the foul line, I think.”
Last month, when the Bucks played the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, Milwaukee’s “Greek Freak” dunked right over a 6’6” defender.

What makes the dispute between Stormy Daniels and President Trump more than a tabloid scandal is that her silence was purchased 11 days before the election, which may run afoul of campaign finance laws, #60Minutes reports
Now, Stormy Daniels says the statements she signed were untrue, and that she felt pressured to sign them. (2/2)
After The Wall Street Journal published a story this past January saying Michael Cohen had paid Stormy Daniels for her silence about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump, Daniels signed statements denying the affair. (½)
Not long after the magazine story was killed, Stormy Daniels says she was threatened by a man who approached her in Las Vegas. “A guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘leave Trump alone. Forget the story.’” https://t.co/JMskKQiYCi
When Donald Trump won the Republican nomination, Daniels says she started getting calls again with offers to tell her story. And she got one offer not to tell her story. Mr. Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen agreed to pay $130K in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement. https://t.co/HB98pik8bj
In 2011, Daniels agreed to tell her story to a sister publication of In Touch magazine for $15K. Two former magazine staffers told #60Minutes that the story never ran because after Mr. Trump was contacted for comment, his attorney Michael Cohen threatened to sue.
“He was like, ‘wow, you are special. You remind me of my daughter.’” --Stormy Daniels says of her conversation with Mr. Trump the night they met. https://t.co/Mj52gSoDbH
“This was not a secret,” Daniels says of her relationship with Mr. Trump in 2006. “He never asked me not to tell anyone.”
Stormy Daniels says she and Mr. Trump had unprotected, consensual sex in his hotel suite the night they met. She says they only had sex one time. She was 27; he was 60.
Daniels has been acting in, directing, and writing adult films for nearly 20 years. She was one of the most popular actresses in the industry when she met Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf event in 2006. She says he invited her to dinner.
“I was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I’m not ok with being made out to be a liar or people thinking I did this for money.” --Stormy Daniels on why she’s setting the record straight.
Through his representatives, Mr. Trump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels, and his lawyers are now threatening her with financial ruin, saying she has to pay $1M every time she violates her agreement to stay silent.
A week and a half before the 2016 election, Donald Trump’s personal attorney paid porn star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged relationship with the Republican candidate for president. #60Minutes

Headscarves optional? "The decision is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire she chooses," Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says of Islamic law.

“Today, Saudi women still have not received their full rights. There are rights stipulated in Islam that they still don’t have. We have come a very long way and have a short way to go.” --Crown Prince Mohammed on improving conditions for women. https://t.co/ke8fGvJsCA
Out of necessity, Mohammed bin Salman has been overhauling the Saudi economy. He’s created a fund which plans to invest $2 trillion into ventures at home and abroad. They recently sank $3.5 billion into Uber.
75% of Saudi Arabia’s citizens are under 30. Because oil is no longer a predictable revenue source, the cradle-to-grave services--including healthcare and education--guaranteed to everyone are imperiled.

“I’m a rich person and not a poor person. I’m not Gandhi or Mandela.” --Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on his fortune.
Some reports have said the detainees were physically abused, and one died in custody. But, the Saudis deny any detainees were abused.
One of the crown prince’s most trusted advisors, Saudi-born, Harvard-trained lawyer Mohammed al-Sheikh says detaining the accused was necessary. https://t.co/0DXjDpIs4F
Prince Mohammed has been accused of heavy-handed tactics. Last Nov., at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, he invited hundreds of prominent Saudis to a meeting, accused them of stealing from the state. They were held until they paid what was owed or proved their innocence.
Mohammed bin Salman has curbed the powers of Saudi Arabia’s “religious police,” who until recently were able to arrest women for not covering up. And he says Islamic law “does not particularly specify a black abaya or a black head cover.” https://t.co/mgKEt35NoK
“This is not the real Saudi Arabia.” --Prince Mohammed bin Salman says of the past 40 years. https://t.co/C7JcQfLsQw
The crown prince has kicked a hornet’s nest in the Middle East and earned a host of new enemies, which is partly why he’s one of the most heavily-guarded men in the world.
Prince Mohammed bin Salman is already the most dominant Arab leader in a generation. His reforms inside Saudi Arabia have been revolutionary. He’s emancipating women, introducing music and cinema and cracking down on corruption in a land with 15K princes.

The horses of an Argentine polo club may look normal, but the way they came into existence is anything but conventional. https://t.co/MMmt35NRs8
Some argue players using clones have an unfair advantage. One player will have to rotate his star horses out when they tire, but Adolfo can rotate 8 Cuarteteras.
Each clone is also named Cuartetera--they are identified by numbers. Adolfo and his business partners, including shrewd Argentinian businessman Ernesto Gutierrezz, sell their foals for up to $250K, but they never sell the clones. They keep the DNA. https://t.co/VSGgoiJQaV
While cloning is on the rise in polo, some breeders are sticking with more traditional methods. Facundo Pieres, the world No. 2 who also has a multi-million dollar breeding business, does not clone.
Last year, Cuartetera was honored as the best polo horse in history. Cambiaso has already won two Argentine Opens with the horse's clones.
While regulators of thoroughbred racing worldwide have taken a firm stance against cloning, no such prohibition exists in polo.
Dr. Adrian Mutto was hired as the lead scientist in Adolfo Cambiaso’s cloning business. He told us that by 2019, they will have as many as 34 Cuartetera clones. https://t.co/hNixP608qJ
At the same time, Cambiaso decided to clone another horse--his biggest star--a mare named Cuartetera. Now 17, she started playing polo at 4, a year younger than most. She took to the game prodigiously. He has now cloned her 14 times.
Meeker and Cambiaso had acquaintances in common who put the two in touch. After two years, and one failed attempt, Adolfo got his wish--a clone of his beloved Aiken Cura who grew into a magnificent, healthy horse.
In 2009,  Texas oil heir and polo enthusiast, Alan Meeker, decided his goal of building a fleet of champion horses would be best achieved via cloning. He started a business, and a year later, licensed the tech that had been used to clone the famed sheep Dolly.
During the prestigious Argentine Open 12 years ago, Cambiaso’s then most-prized horse Aiken Cura broke his leg and couldn’t be saved. He asked his vet to save some of the horse’s skin cells. https://t.co/35JyJxSAru
Adolfo Cambiaso has been the top-ranked player in the world for 22 years. 18 years ago, he created his own polo team and a lucrative breeding business. Today, he has nearly 1000 horses.
The mayor of New Orleans took down a monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Who asked him to do it? One of the city's most famous musicians: Wynton Marsalis. https://t.co/cwit8a8RWQ
Unlike New Orleans, the Confederate statues in Richmond might be protected by state law. One person that might have disappointed is Robert E. Lee. He is on record opposing the building of Civil War monuments. “Wiser,” he once wrote, “not to keep open the sores of war.” #60Minutes
Julian Hayter, a professor at the University of Richmond who was appointed to the city’s Monument Avenue commission says, “I think the statues should stay with a footnote of epic proportions.” https://t.co/0R70Kw4eDB
William J. Cooper, who was a professor of history at LSU for 46 years and a past president of the Southern Historical Association, says removing the monuments is a mistake. https://t.co/dIoUsC6Ypy
There have been protests in Richmond over the future of Monument Avenue. Mayor Levar Stoney wants the statues taken down, calling them, “the fake news of their time.”
Several Confederate monuments have been removed in both Baltimore and Austin. In Durham, NC, protesters tore down a statue. No state has more Confederate monuments than Virginia. In Richmond, there is a contentious debate about 5 Confederate statues on Monument Ave.
Two of the Confederate statues in New Orleans have been gathering dust in a plywood shed in a location #60Minutes was asked not to reveal. “The whole point is to confront history.” --Mayor Landrieu https://t.co/izb96KLrpm
"I really did want to make a definitive statement, as a white man from the South, as the mayor of a major American city ... that it's not unclear anymore about what the Civil War was about and who won, and what the values are that we should really revere." --Mayor Landrieu
When the City of New Orleans removed a statue of Confederate General P.G.T Beauregard, they did so in the dead of night. Mayor Mitch Landrieu says it was impossible to find a local company to take the job and that a contractor’s car was fire bombed. https://t.co/lrArg3qgbd
This past spring, after years of legal wrangling, four Confederate monuments in New Orleans came down. The last one removed was a 16.5-foot bronze statue of General Robert E. Lee that stood for 133 years.

Dr. Bruce Perry, @BDPerry, who has been called on for decades to treat children traumatized in high-profile events--including the Columbine and Sandy Hook shootings--says children are especially vulnerable to chaos and violence.
According to the CDC, a high score on the ACE test makes you 5 times as likely to be depressed, and can cut your life expectancy by as much as 20 years. The CDC says 1 out of every 8 children suffers enough trauma to cause lasting damage.
A crucial element of trauma-informed care is something called the ACE Test--ACE stands for Adverse Childhood Experiences. A high score is a powerful predictor of physical and mental problems down the road.
Trauma-informed care focuses on a person’s experiences before trying to correct their behavior, whether it be juvenile delinquency, poor performance in school, or out-of-control anger. https://t.co/SMKRwyBNrd

In 2013, Lawrence won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Tiffany, a young widow, in “Silver Linings Playbook.”
At 21, Lawrence shattered the myth that women can’t carry an action franchise. Her four “Hunger Games” movies earned almost $3 billion.
“Desperation. An appetite. Confidence. And ambition.” --Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence on how she got from Kentucky to the top of Hollywood. #60Minutes
JR's hidden message on Ellis Island: The street artist has brought his trademark oversized photographs to an abandoned immigrants' hospital, but there's more than meets the eye. https://t.co/6N5UHucG98
JR has over a million Instagram followers, and he’s routinely seen in the company of rock stars and other artists. Last month, a documentary he directed, “Faces, Places,” was nominated for an Oscar.
JR now has a team of about 16 working for him in Paris and New York. He funds his projects with proceeds from print sales and help from wealthy art patrons.
In Africa, JR focused his lens on women, heroes, he says who are often treated as second-class citizens. A Kenyan woman named Elizabeth asked JR to paste her photo for all the world to see. He pasted her eyes on a ship that spent months traveling thousands of miles at sea.
The idea of breaking tension through photography was a revelation to JR. In 2007, he went to Israel after the second intifada. He plan was to paste his giant photos on the wall separating the Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank. (½) https://t.co/Qye2om4mNo
But before JR could begin pasting, he was arrested by Israeli authorities. After some questioning, he and his team were released and given 15 days to leave. Instead, JR went to the Palestinian side of the wall and began to paste. (2/2)
In 2005, riots broke out in a neighborhood similar to JR’s where most residents are of African or Arab descent. Two kids had died while being chased by police. JR saw how the young people were being portrayed on TV and decided to tell a different story with his camera. https://t.co/O46tqDjuvW
JR’s foray into photography began, he says, by accident. He found a camera on the subway and started taking pictures of his friends. “I went from ‘I exist’ to ‘they exist,’ and I realized the power of that.” #60Minutes
We don’t know his real name. That’s just how JR wants it. In public, he never takes off his glasses or hat. He’s been arrested several times, deported. We do know that JR is 35 and was born in France, the child of Tunisian immigrants. https://t.co/DiIddReGwZ
The photographer known as JR has been pasting enormous pictures of everyday people all over the world--Nairobi, Cuba, Istanbul, Tunisia--for the past 14 years. #60Minutes
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has used internationally banned chemical weapons nearly 200 times throughout the civil war threatening his regime. Now, rare footage shows just how brutal those attacks are. https://t.co/iWXQZaDUWS
The dictatorship used conventional bombs against hospitals and schools in addition to the nerve gas in the neighborhoods. Millions of Syrians have been forced from their homes. https://t.co/7hK53KlM79
Edmond Mulet--who had been investigating chemical attacks in Syria on behalf of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons--lost his job. Russia, the Syrian dictatorship’s chief ally, ended his investigation with a veto in the security council
The Syrian dictatorship has denied involvement in the attack, even claiming it was staged by the opposition.
White Helmets had to load victims into a truck and drive them 30 miles to one of the nearest surviving hospitals. Doctors tried everything, but were unable to save many. Dr. Mamoun Morad told us the scene “was like Judgement Day, the Apocalypse.” #60Minutes https://t.co/wekWquHzCG
The attack drew immediate retaliation from the Trump administration, which fired 59 cruise missiles into a Syrian airbase. #60Minutes
The emergency response was coordinated by the famed White Helmets. Mustafa al-Haj Yousef supervised their efforts. He counted the bodies of more than 30 children. https://t.co/EQrGlDdqGQ
The UN says more than 200 people, mainly women and children, were affected by last year’s sarin gas attack on Khan Shaykhun, Syria.

Rex Tillerson opens up in rare, wide-ranging interview. The normally private Secretary of State talks with 60 Minutes about his life, his relationship with the President, and his efforts to bring North Korea to the bargaining table. https://t.co/585bNpSvz1
Last fall, Oprah Winfrey spoke with 14 Michigan voters, seven of whom voted for Donald Trump. Winfrey sat down with the voters again to get their thoughts on Trump's first year in office. https://t.co/fvItU7cDJN https://t.co/XLC09keC0k
"We're not using a carrot to convince them to talk. We're using large sticks," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tells 60 Minutes how to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. https://t.co/z8DzJAdz14
In our first discussion, @Oprah asked the group if the sides would be able to find common ground. Six months later, they’re working on it. #60Minutes https://t.co/Wn75kfY9sd
Conservative pollster Frank Luntz, who first assembled the group for #60Minutes said the word “denounce” stood out to him. “Denouncement is the kind of political correctness that so many people reject today.”
The discussion about a tweet progressed into a larger conversation about sexual harassment. One female member of the group challenged some of the conservative men to “condemn” the president’s treatment of women. https://t.co/5dKyAE3HOE
The primary source of conflict for the group on Facebook was a tweet President Trump wrote about Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand part of which read she “would do anything for” campaign contributions.
After 60 Minutes left the group in Grand Rapids six months ago, the members stayed in close touch in a private Facebook message thread they named “America’s Hope.” But one subject nearly broke them apart for good. https://t.co/vD4zpNAtSF
At some points in the discussion, things got personal. A few Trump supporters and a few liberals at the table were challenged. https://t.co/3eU9zF2IKM
Jennifer, a Republican who did not vote for Trump, says the president’s tweets about potential nuclear war with Kim Jong Un’s North Korea are like, “playground antics of ‘my dad can beat up your dad.’” #60Minutes
President Trump’s supporters in the group say he speaks for the people. But those who aren’t fans of the president argue the opposite. #60Minutes https://t.co/VhrVp38ocE
The 14 members of our group may know each other better now, but their political views have not changed … especially when it comes to President Trump. https://t.co/6bm9JpOt7y
“Now I’m looking at them as people, not as you’re Trump or not Trump.” Jennifer from Grand Rapids says staying in touch with people she met via #60Minutes last fall has been an education for her.

The showdown over the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act: A bill passing through Congress could change the way states recognize concealed carry permits. https://t.co/RP8YQS5P86
"A lightweight" was just one of the ways Pres. Trump described Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Twitter in Dec., and her response was just as pointed. The senator tells 60 Minutes why she believes the president's tweet was "a sexist smear." https://t.co/BUY4cYKZtl https://t.co/ne6KHQN4Zh
Senator Gillibrand: “We only have 21 women in the U.S Senate.  We need 51 and that will be representative of the nation.”
Senator Gillibrand and her colleagues--including Republican Ted Cruz--are pressuring congress to change the way it deals with its own harassment complaints. Accusers are required mandatory counseling and then mediation with the accused. Why? "To protect predators," she says. https://t.co/lZHkLHoHlw
As a congresswoman, Gillibrand used her hunting background to appeal to voters in Upstate New York. She boasted an “A” rating from the NRA. She still supports the 2nd Amendment, but her stance has changed. She has also pivoted from a more conservative position on immigration. https://t.co/aJ3J5QrXx7
President Trump responded to Gillibrand’s criticism by trolling her on twitter. He called her a lightweight. Her response, which included the line, “you cannot silence me” drew six times more RTs than the president. #60Minutes
Gillibrand had previously taken on Bill Clinton. And she called out President Donald Trump for a long history of alleged sexual misconduct.
In Dec., Sen. Gillibrand was the first to publicly call for Sen. Al Franken to resign after 8 women accused him of sexual misconduct. Franken, whom Gillibrand calls a friend, had hoped a congressional investigation would clear him. #60Minutes https://t.co/R3ODvqxYif
An attorney for Rodchenkov is trying to get the U.S. government to let Rodchenkov stay so he won’t be deported to Russia where he is a wanted man. #60Minutes
But just this month, an international court removed the lifetime bans on 2/3s of the Russian athletes allegedly caught doping at Sochi. The court also reinstated 9 of the 13 medals. (2/2)
Russia was stripped of 13 Sochi medals. More than 100 Russians were banned from the Rio Olympics. And Russia itself has been disqualified from Pyeongchang, although some Russian athletes are competing under the Olympic flag. (½)
Rodchenkov told his story in “Icarus,” a documentary nominated for an Academy Award this year. He also told the New York Times and the World Anti-Doping Agency, which found witnesses and evidence to back up his story.
The Russian government admits there are Russian athletes who have cheated, but it claims it wasn’t The Kremlin, it was Rodchenkov alone. #60Minutes
Rodchenkov told us the details of the plot were known to Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s Minister of Sport. Mutko, he says, reported directly to Putin. https://t.co/xUkLXz5BM5
In Sochi, Rodchenkov says he was helped by the Russian intelligence service, the FSB. An agent posing as a plumber would help open “tamper-proof” bottles and replace dirty urine with clean urine frozen before the Games. https://t.co/9N0MZe3Vs3
To help Russia win in Sochi, Rodchenkov formulated an illicit performance enhancing prescription that contained three banned drugs. Of Russia’s 13 gold medals, Rodchenkov says he believes five were won by athletes who were dirty.
As Russia was preparing to host the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Vladimir Putin was determined to win. And mysteriously, the investigation against Russia’s doping mastermind was dropped. #60Minutes
Rodchenkov says the ultimate goal of his lab was “win at any cost.” The Kremlin will tell you today he’s a criminal and mentally ill. In 2011, Rodchenkov and his sister were investigated for selling performance enhancing drugs.
To protect his safety, Rodchenkov asked us to disguise his face; he said #60Minutes could use earlier images of him without a disguise.
In 2015, Grigory Rodchenkov escaped to the U.S. carrying the files of Russia’s doping program. The former director of Russia’s anti-doping lab in Russia says the Kremlin wants him to stop talking. #60Minutes https://t.co/ShCFdAvHD4
Steve Kroft talks about the NRA-supported gun bill that would allow concealed carry nationwide -- and why no NRA interview appears in his 60 Minutes story. https://t.co/pju31uTQs2 https://t.co/dYd6ONnqHx
Tim Schmidt of the U.S. Concealed Carry Association believes everyone should have the right to carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the country. #60Minutes https://t.co/6j3frzanBe
The central tenet of Concealed Carry Reciprocity is that the 2nd Amendment gives people the right to carry guns anywhere they want. Robyn Thomas, the executive director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence says that’s a fallacy. https://t.co/WNUIQHQQXa
Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance says his city has the most to lose should the bill pass. Every year, New York takes in nearly 50 million visitors from all over the country. The bill could mean hundreds of thousands of additional guns for what is now the safest big city in the U.S. https://t.co/Hmh6bFxz7a
But there is fierce opposition to the bill in places like California, where there are strict gun laws and concealed carry permits are hard to get. A dozen other states, however, require no permit at all.
The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act sailed through the House, has the full support of President Trump and has roughly 40 co-sponsors in the Senate. Supporters call it a simple solution to confusing state gun laws. #60Minutes
Of all the political and cultural issues that divide red states from blue ones, none is more volatile than guns and who can carry them. Steve Kroft reports, next.
The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act has sailed through the House of Representatives and has the full support of the President of The United States. What is it and what does it mean for you? Find out tonight. https://t.co/3s6PjoSurg

ICYMI: As America's longest war rages on, Kabul is under seige. The American scientist who's seen North Korea's nuclear secrets tells his story. And, is Portland still Portlandia? https://t.co/scCsQX6y8J
Nuclear programs are usually secretive – so why did North Korea purposely brag about theirs to an American scientist? https://t.co/2NoQxvSgNX
Is Portland still Portlandia? For years, Portland has been the symbol for laid-back, inexpensive quirkiness, but the city may be losing that identity. https://t.co/CkPlhWN1jd
The average family income for whites in Portland is more than double that of African Americans. And Portland’s homeless population is up 10% in just the last two years. https://t.co/HIZShkoLcg
It’s true that Portland’s progressive present is at odds with its racist past, which includes a state constitution adopted in 1857 that actually banned black people from moving to Oregon, and a once-robust KKK presence.
Police say that in May 2017, Jeremy Christian stabbed 2 men to death on a Portland light rail train after they came to the defense of 2 African American women he was harassing. One of the women was wearing a hijab.
In 2016, when Ted Wheeler ran for mayor, Portland was placid. He is now presiding over a suddenly pugnacious city. https://t.co/MjowVOdUUW
But precisely because Portland is a liberal enclave, right-wing nationalists have targeted the city with rallies and marches. And those nationalists have been met by far-left antifa protesters with people on each side trying to bait the other into violence. #60Minutes
More than 4 times as many people in Portland voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump. After his election, some of the largest demonstrations arose in Portland.
Colin Meloy, founder of the band The Decemberists “retired” to cheap, hip Portland in the 1990s. He estimates he was paying $180 per month in rent. https://t.co/Con3zUCP7r

It may mostly be propaganda when North Korea boasts about its nuclear capabilities, but one American says to be careful not to underestimate the country's power. https://t.co/FgnzKrbcyY
If you believe North Korean propaganda, Kim Jong Un is ecstatic with the progress his nuclear scientists have made. Ri Hong Sop has been promoted to director of the nuclear weapons program.
This past September when North Korea unveiled a sleeker warhead design--one it said was much more powerful--Hecker’s old tour guide, Ri Hong Sop, was beside North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
US intelligence estimates that, by now, North Korea could have enough bomb-grade material for 60 weapons, though the precise number is not what’s important to Hecker. He’s more concerned with how small they can make them. https://t.co/55YIihV4Ly
In all, Hecker visited North Korea 7 times. Since his last trip, that uranium plant has doubled in size and is likely not the only uranium enrichment plant in the country.
Until Sig Hecker was invited back in 2010 and saw thousands of modern centrifuges used to enrich uranium. (2/2) #60Minutes
Americans relied on satellite photos to keep an eye on North Korea’s nuclear program, but they were unable to tell for sure whether the North Koreans were building a second type of bomb made of uranium. (½)
Ri Hong Sop, Hecker’s guide and the complex’s director, showed him plutonium. The North Koreans wanted him to know they had the same radioactive element that had produced the first nuclear explosion in 1945. https://t.co/QGUcVTA61K
For 11 years, Sig Hecker had been director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, birthplace of the American atomic bomb. So he was surprised when, in 2004, he was invited to tour North Korea’s nuclear complex. https://t.co/FPf2GBNWSe
In 16 years, the Afghan War has cost 2,400 American lives and $1 trillion. But with the country's capital under siege, the end still seems far away. https://t.co/06cGS54TJg
60 Minutes correspondent Lara Logan has reported from Afghanistan over the last 16 years. But this time, she says, was different--and more dangerous. https://t.co/lh0sSSHn2B
Nicholson is targeting Taliban leaders and their largest source of revenue, labs that turn opium into heroin. His goal is to do what his predecessors have tried to do and failed--force the Taliban to cut a deal. https://t.co/xczDUGKuQY
General John Nicholson, who leads the US troops in Afghanistan, believes America’s new strategy--more troops in, time limits out—and Pakistan under pressure for being a safe haven for terrorists will end the war. It’s something we have heard from previous commanders.
When cornered, the terrorists detonated grenades strapped to their chests. They murdered more than 50 people that day. (2/2)

American taxpayers bankroll 90 percent of Afghanistan’s defense budget. That’s more $4 billion per year. Another $30 billion has been spent rebuilding the country.
In just 4 months last year, more than 4K Afghan soldiers and police were wounded, another 2.5K killed. Since then, Ghani has refused to reveal casualty numbers. https://t.co/KGVRtiK21P
By terrorizing the people, the Taliban have sown deep doubts about the government, resulting in angry protesters chanting “death to Ashraf Ghani.” https://t.co/4wWQteUKEG
Afghan president Ashraf Ghani says 21 international terrorist groups are operating in his country, adding “there are factories producing suicide bombers.” #60Minutes
When the US first entered Afghanistan, Kabul’s population was 500K. Now, it’s more than 5 million. Shortly after US troops were cut to fewer than 10K in 2016, the enemy filled the vacuum. Suicide bombers have terrorized Kabul ever since.
After 16 years in Afghanistan, America’s goals and strategies have changed. President Trump recently sent 3K more troops to train and assist the Afghan army. But Kabul is so dangerous, American diplomats and soldiers aren’t allowed to use the roads. They have to fly.

CTE, the brain disease best known for impacting football players who suffered concussions, is now being found in soldiers. https://t.co/bVfj7Soyx1
33-year-old Tom Bates survived four IED blasts in Iraq and Afghanistan. When he returned in 2009, his wife noticed a dramatic change, so they started looking for answers. Bates is working with doctors in New York who are trying to move beyond only diagnosing CTE in the dead. https://t.co/ct0WjjsT82
The only fool-proof way to diagnose CTE is by testing a post-mortem brain. Researchers dissect sections of the folds of the frontal lobes, an area responsible for--among other things--personality. #60Minutes
Blast trauma--”shell shock”--was first recognized in WWI. Poorly-protected soldiers often died immediately. Today, sophisticated armor allows more soldiers to walk away from an explosion, but exposure can still damage the brain--an injury that can worsen over time.
Of the 102 veterans’ brains Dr McKee has examined, 66 had CTE. #60Minutes https://t.co/UoVpVaocF8
Sgt. Ash donated his brain to science, a gesture he thought would bring a better understanding to the invisible wounds of war. Dr. Ann McKee who has spent 14 years studying the brains of NFL players at Boston University is seeing similar results with veterans, including Ash.
By his last birthday, Sgt. Ash was unable to speak, walk, eat on his own. “The thing I didn’t know was his brain was continuing to die.” --Joy Kieffer (Ash’s mom)
Over three deployments, Sgt. Kevin Ash was exposed to 12 combat blasts. His mother Joy Kieffer says “his whole personality had changed” when he returned home in 2012. Kieffer buried her 34-year-old son this past summer. https://t.co/1JB8HI3KYe
An experimental computer program is trying to prevent crime by predicting it. Chicago hopes it can reduce the city's gun violence and save lives. https://t.co/T2e3UGaxz0
It’s taken four years for the violence reduction strategy to visit nearly 1500 people. Of them, 78 percent have no new arrest for a violent crime. And last year, shootings were down 21 percent.
Donna Hall’s son, Marshall, was shot and killed in 2013. She helps lead “the sisterhood,” a movement of moms of the murdered. She makes home visits to people police believe are at high risk of shooting or being shot. #60Minutes https://t.co/n85ZRFwqN2
One of the obstacles to success is fear and loathing of the cops. Chicago police have an infamous history of brutality, so the violence reduction strategy enlists the neighborhood. #60Minutes

For security, we can’t tell you exactly where Flamand moves the rhino, but the animals #60Minutes witnessed were moved to a well-guarded reserve. Flamand says there are now 200 more black rhino in South Africa than when the project began.
Flamand and his team dehorn the rhino to protect them from poachers. He says it’s painless. And while the rhino need them to defend themselves, the team relocates them to places with few predators.
Rhino horn is made of keratin, the same substance as human fingernails. Yet in countries like Vietnam and China, people believe it can cure hangovers and increase virility. It’s worth more per ounce than gold or cocaine. #60Minutes
When the project first started in 2003, 3 or 4 black rhino were being killed per year. Now, because of a demand for rhino horn, Flamand says poachers are killing South African black rhino well into the hundreds. #60Minutes
Once the rhino is tranquilized, it’s a race to remove the dart; treat the wound; clear a path to above; affix four leg straps and the chain; and whisk the rhino away. The whole process takes about 15 minutes. #60Minutes https://t.co/a5Pgl6BBqH
Pilot Tosh Ross who has been working with Cooper since the beginning, says the helicopter he flies can haul 2 tons--more than enough to lift a black rhino. Ross also says the team has lifted 200 rhinos successfully. #60Minutes
Dave Cooper has been the chief veterinarian for Kwazulu-Natal Parks for 22 years and says the rhino are usually in the air--suspended by their legs--for fewer than 10 minutes and fully sedated the entire time. #60Minutes https://t.co/OsGdp6Nuee
When Flamand and his team began The Black Rhino Range Expansion Project 15 years ago, Flamand says there were about 2500 in South Africa. The goal was to relocate 20 at a time--a genetically viable number--to a block of safe land for them to breed.
The intricate extraction operation was choreographed by veterinarian Jacques Flamand, who says, “Some of these rhino are in very inaccessible parts of the reserve. And this method of airlifting them provided us with an opportunity.” #60Minutes
Relocating a black rhino is a complicated process--take one 1400-lb rhino who’s been darted and sedated, two vets, three game capture specialists, four leg straps, a 52-year-old Huey helicopter and its pilot and a 130-foot chain and you get this … #60Minutes https://t.co/vMdIyFbAev

Picciolini still has regrets about his past, including both the violence and recruitment, and he says he gets death threats on a daily basis. He says trying to pull people out of the movement helps him live with himself and what he’s done. #60Minutes https://t.co/KzkLioGWDB
Picciolini wrote to Dylann Roof in the hope that Roof would express remorse. In a response, Roof called him a traitor, among other things. #60Minutes https://t.co/tig2suUL4z
His hardest case is the most notorious white supremacist of our time--Dylann Roof who murdered 9 African Americans during bible study in Charleston, SC.
Not only does Picciolini consult with law enforcement, he says he’s counseled 200 members of the movement. He’s sought out by parents and courts to help de-radicalize white supremacists.
Segal says data shows 74% of extremist-related killings in the US over the past 10 years have been carried out by white extremists, not Islamic extremists. (2/2) #60Minutes

20 years later, Picciolini is making amends. He trains police, the FBI and Homeland Security in the mindset and tactics of the white supremacy movement.
Picciolini recruited dozens to his racist gang and unleashed them on a campaign of assault. The violence reached its peak 1 night when he and his “soldiers” chased a black man out of a restaurant and beat him. Picciolini says that was the last time he hurt anyone. https://t.co/gfPjDqFIbK
He was expelled from high school for multiple assaults against black students and faculty. #60Minutes
Picciolini believed “everybody was against me as a white man,” and “I was being intentionally ostracized and that diversity was a code word for white genocide.” #60Minutes
Christian Picciolini was an American terrorist, a white supremacist, for nearly a decade. As a teenager, he struggled to fit in until one of his Chicago neighbors, a national figure in the neo-Nazi movement, promised him acceptance. #60Minutes https://t.co/YQ5kfN7puv

A DEA spokesperson told us the agreement with McKesson was a good deal. Priority was to get McKesson to do the right thing going forward. And now, an independent monitor watches the company more closely.
After 2 years of negotiations, McKesson was fined $150 million--just about $50 million more than McKesson's CEO made last year. Schiller called it a slap on the wrist for the Fortune 50 Company who was a previous offender.
With the opioid epidemic getting worse, Schiller and his team wanted to send a message. They wanted to fine McKesson more than $1 billion, revoke registrations and put an exec behind bars. But, he says, DEA and DOJ attorneys retreated. #60Minutes https://t.co/Zro9QGajtJ
Helen Kaupang was a veteran DEA investigator. She says McKesson was supplying enough pills to parts of Colorado’s San Luis Valley for every man, woman and child to have a monthly dose of 30-60 tablets. #60Minutes https://t.co/t57HHqFOiP
McKesson delivers more than a third of all medicines in the US from a network of 30 warehouses. Schiller says there were hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders that the company should have reported. For a time, McKesson wasn’t reporting any at all. #60Minutes https://t.co/xIJAt7RLFn

The long, unconventional career of Donald Sutherland: He has appeared in more than 150 films and TV shows, and at 82 years old, he remains one of the hardest working actors in show business. #60Minutes https://t.co/8edvRF2UDP
Russia's government says Alexey Navalny can't run for office, but he remains determined to run against Vladimir Putin in 2018. https://t.co/xjn5bUJ1lv
At the end of his 60 Minutes interview, Donald Sutherland said to Anderson Cooper: "I am leaving this interview with a complete and utter sense of failure." https://t.co/ONLt3bsxNa https://t.co/w0HZ1VHrzX
Sutherland survived polio as a toddler and spent all of 4th grade at home with rheumatic fever. He was an awkward kid --tall with big ears. At school they called him Dumbo. When he was 16, he asked his mother about his looks. She told Sutherland his face had "character." https://t.co/sazX8bgrz5
Sutherland insists he’s never given much thought to the trajectory of his career or viewed it as a climb to stardom. https://t.co/lxurbTto3r
#60Minutes set up a makeshift screening room for Sutherland to watch some of his most iconic performances. It quickly became clear that the characters he’s created stay with him for decades after he’s finished a film.
Sutherland says he rarely sees any of the movies he stars in. His main interest, he says, is his performance because that’s all he has control over. #60Minutes
Sutherland’s big break came in “The Dirty Dozen” after which he was offered a lead in “MASH” and a role in “Kelly’s Heroes” earning a place in Hollywood as an oddball icon of the early 70s counterculture.
To prepare for roles, Sutherland spends months immersing himself in the script, pouring over the parts as he conjures the characters to life. He calls the process “delicious.” #60Minutes https://t.co/Ai570yFU5r
After his 1st film audition, the writer and producer called Donald Sutherland to tell him he didn't get the part. The role was for "a guy next door sort of guy," they told him. “And to be absolutely truthful, we don't think you look like you ever lived next door to anybody.” https://t.co/XeWYlukDk6

President Putin never mentions Navalny’s name. Instead, Navalny says, the president criticizes him via nicknames like “this convict.” “Believe me,” he says, “ they are afraid of me, afraid of us. So it’s--that is much more important for us than mentioning my name.” #60Minutes
Three years ago, both Navalny and his younger brother Oleg were convicted of embezzlement, a ruling the European Court of Human Rights called “arbitrary and unfair.” Alexey got a suspended sentence. Oleg is still behind bars.
In the west, Navalny’s assumed to be a Russian liberal, but there was a time he marched with nationalists.
Navalny is seen as the last man standing. Most of the other opposition leaders have fled the country or been found dead under mysterious circumstances. Even Navalny’s wife wonders how he’s still alive. #60Minutes https://t.co/6r4CvArSKM
But his supporters came out in droves all across the country. Close to 1700 were arrested (2/2) #60Minutes
The video inflamed so much outrage that tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets in March. When Navalny called for a second round of protests three months later, he was arrested before he even left his apartment building. (½)
Navalny says he found that the Kremlin’s inner circle was accumulating vast amounts of wealth. He published pictures of multiple homes and yachts. He moved on to airing YouTube documentaries featuring video of the officials’ lavish lifestyle https://t.co/76UWAneVMw
His most-watched documentary has over 25 million views. It focused on Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and his estates--five of them, Navalny says. #60Minutes
By purchasing small shares of state-owned companies a decade ago, Navalny was able to get his hands on internal financial docs. He investigated evidence of misconduct, and began his public life by posting it all on a blog. #60Minutes
Navalny says poverty is the biggest issue for the Russian people. “No opportunities,” he says, adding, “Putin is stealing their future.”  #60Minutes
Mr. Putin remains extremely popular and is expected to be reelected. The gov't. says Navalny can’t even be on the ballot because he was found guilty of embezzlement--a charge he insists was trumped up. Still, Navalny says his campaign has amassed 170K volunteers. #60Minutes
Running against Putin and holding rallies--often without official permits--has had its consequences: one arrest … after another. https://t.co/BZYwsLA2Zf
Alexey Navalny is a 41-year-old Russian lawyer who has chosen one of the most dangerous occupations in the world--running against the man who controls the Kremlin. #60Minutes
"The planet is warming, and all hell is breaking loose." As California endures its most destructive fire season, Governor Jerry Brown tells 60 Minutes that President Trump's skepticism about climate change is "a reckless disregard for the truth." https://t.co/0K7feAEnyR
Under Governor Brown, California’s economy has become the 6th largest in the world, bigger than the economy of France. But economic success has come at a cost. Spiraling housing costs are contributing to a surge in homelessness. 25% of the country’s homeless live in California https://t.co/QydkFuz5bZ
“California is showing that dealing with climate is good for the economy, not bad,” says Governor Brown, touting the state’s policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions https://t.co/7WXbu04ay3
“I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord-- the fear of the wrath of God… And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed,” California Governor Brown says of the president’s position on climate change https://t.co/or3JfIw8m2
California Governor Jerry Brown urges the president to reconsider his stance on the Paris Agreement: “I'd say to Mr. Trump, take a deeper look. Now is not the time to undo what every country in the world is committed to.”
“These fires are unprecedented. We've never seen anything like it.  Scientists are telling us, this is the kind of stuff that's gonna happen,” says @JerryBrownGov, citing science that predicts extreme weather patterns can create conditions for fires. https://t.co/QVg5FBTNCV

This week, 60 Minutes celebrates its 50 seasons on air. Here's a look back at some of the stories correspondents remember most. https://t.co/4LatwMQD3n
Steve Kroft, Scott Pelley, Lesley Stahl, Bill Whitaker and more look back at 50 seasons of 60 Minutes https://t.co/gc7ySzoS3U
What makes a great #60Minutes interview? Over the past half century, the broadcast has conducted hundreds of important interviews. Correspondents past and present explain how the best ones are done. #50yearsof60 https://t.co/zcbe13TaX6 https://t.co/Izxa3VfflS
At #60Minutes, we stand on the shoulders of giants: Don Hewitt, Mike Wallace, Morley Safer, Ed Bradley, Andy Rooney and so many more. To those pioneers, to all who make this broadcast tick every week, and to our viewers – thank you. It’s been a great 50 years. #50yearsof60
We’re indebted to @Beyonce for this backstage interpretation of the #60Minutes theme song, otherwise known as the stopwatch. #50yearsof60 https://t.co/BLMxi0K3gj
While profiling @LadyGaga, @AndersonCooper came to expect the unexpected from this talented musician and performer. #60Minutes https://t.co/qb80wob5GM
Many of Mike Wallace’s showbiz interviews were done in his trademark take-no-prisoners style, like this moment with Barbra Streisand. https://t.co/HaUBSpSFKy
Morley Safer to Katharine Hepburn: “Do you feel like a legend?” Hepburn: “I don’t think you ever feel like anything. You feel like a bore.”
In 1996, Ed Bradley interviewed Muhammad Ali, whose Parkinson’s disease made it hard for him to talk or walk. When Ali appeared to nod off during lunch, Ed realized he had been pranked by The Greatest. #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/aMOacIulQC
During his interview with Steve Kroft, LeBron James scored from the top of the key into the opposite net. Watch this 2009 clip: https://t.co/KQ456JOWcl
Next on our 50th anniversary broadcast: athletes on #60Minutes, including LeBron James, Tom Brady, Jose Canseco, Tyler Hamilton, and Muhammad Ali.
During his long career at CBS News, Bob Simon covered dozens of wars and rebellions. In his later years, Bob also became something of a wildlife correspondent. #50yearsof60 https://t.co/HZhDegp9eO
Morley Safer was one of our greatest travelogue writers. In this clip, hear how he describes the grim Finnish version of the passionate Argentinian tango. https://t.co/qH1Fz5DE8P
“Diving with great white sharks is among the stupidest things you can do,” says @AndersonCooper. Yet he did it on #60Minutes – without cage or protection. https://t.co/wDs02yrpEk
“I think the most important thing is to own up to it, to help the viewer understand how we made the mistake,” says executive producer @JeffFager about errors in #60Minutes stories.
“It’s incredible in retrospect, because the story itself about tobacco was as important as stories get,” says #60Minutes executive producer @JeffFager. (2/2)
Mike Wallace’s 1996 story on how the tobacco industry lied about the dangers of smoking was so controversial that CBS lawyers blocked its broadcast for months, fearing a huge lawsuit. (1/2)
“The good news is we’re not cops. The bad news is, we’re 60 Minutes.” That’s how Steve Kroft let a con man know we’d been using a hidden camera to capture his crime: rolling back odometers on used cars.
It is still painful to hear Clint Hill -- one of the secret service agents protecting JFK in Dallas – describe his deep guilt for not taking the fatal shot instead of the president. “I’ll live with that to my grave.” https://t.co/jnmNkJBWpI
Rules for conducting a #60Minutes interview: Do your homework. Don’t be shy. Take your time. And even when you’ve mastered all that, it’s still not as easy as it looks. Pointers from Ed Bradley in this clip: https://t.co/Bo6JDOTNBl
“People drown on the way over all the time,” says @AndersonCooper about reporting on Syrian refugees coming to Greece in small, unsteady rubber boats. “[It’s] an unspeakable tragedy.” #60Minutes https://t.co/k7hJze8kvE

The Isle of Eigg: Just off Scotland, a tiny island with one main road is a testament to human independence. #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/UbbuxvDwfY
Dr. Basel Termanini, VP of the Syrian-American Medical Society tells #60Minutes the society has donated 120 ambulances, pays the salaries of nearly 2K Syrian medical staff, equips 135 facilities, and is building more. #60Minutes
"So what are they talkin' about this week?" "Mainly you." #60Minutes was apparently the talk of the island on our recent visit to the craggy, sparsely-populated Isle of Eigg, resident Charlie Galli tells Steve Kroft https://t.co/LFIXfEGnUM https://t.co/HuFAc4aAx6
The residents of Eigg have no grand ambitions for development. The owners don’t want hotels or a golf course or hundreds of new residents. #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/5oOwgN6yzT
Eigg is not always served sunny-side up. Gusts of wind get up to 100 MPH. The boats might not get in for a week, so people keep lots of beans and Spam in the pantry.
The island has no formal government, no offices, no court system, no police, and the doctor only comes on Tuesday. #60Minutes https://t.co/i2mUo9LfAO
Eigg has a tiny, but unique power grid that runs almost entirely on renewable energy. It’s the first time that’s ever been accomplished anywhere. #60Minutes
When it comes to essentials, there is basically one of everything on Eigg--1 primary school for 5 kids, 1 grocery shop, 1 pub serving local beer, including a brew called “I Am The Eggman”. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
Jobs are hard to find on Eigg--you kind of have to create your own. 1 resident edits a sports journal; 1 is a handyman; and Sarah Boden runs her uncle’s sheep farm. A former music journalist, Boden convinced her partner, one of Scotland’s most famous musicians, to move to Eigg. https://t.co/If36eBvLHs
To celebrate 20 years of ownership, the Eiggers had a blowout they call a Ceilidh with music, dancing and drink. We canceled the next day’s shoot to allow for recovery. #60Minutes
No one in Scotland had ever tried a community buyout before, &amp; certainly not 64 residents with no cash or credit. But people knew their story &amp; liked the idea of wee folk taking on the big guy. In 1997, a public fundraising campaign brought in $2.5 million to close the deal.
The Eigg residents hatched a plan--they would try to buy the island themselves. “We wouldn’t have to do very much to do better than what he’d done, which was nothin’” --Eigg Secretary, Maggie Fyffe. (2/2)
Schellenberg realized things weren’t quite working out with Eigg’s residents, so he sold the island to a German who called himself Maruma and claimed to be an artist of note and professor. He turned out to be neither, and within 2 years, creditors put Eigg up for auction. (½)
Schellenberg treated the island like a personal playground while most of his tenants lived in poverty. A rebellion started with a slow burn that burst into flames in 1994 when Schellenberg’s 1927 Rolls Royce met a fiery end. #60Minutes https://t.co/geejUJyaM1
In the mid 70s, the entire island of Eigg was purchased by an Englishman named Keith Schellenberg. Under Scotland’s feudal landlord system, he had absolute power over the island. #60Minutes https://t.co/MLjW2wQ7QX
While Eigg doesn’t have many permanent residents, it does get its share of tourists--12,000 visitors ferried over last year. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
3 miles wide and 6 miles long, Eigg is a craggy isle populated mostly by sheep. Eigg has one source of public transportation. His name is Charlie Galli, and he knows everyone on the island. #60Minutes https://t.co/FWTNV1YSOP
Syria's dictator is trying to quash the remnants of rebellion by bombing hospitals. Still, brave doctors in the country, many of them American volunteers, are risking everything to save lives. #60Minutes https://t.co/Ubws1Phttt
The Syrian-American Medical Society says that, over six years of war, it has delivered more than 100K babies and supported almost 400K surgeries. #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/v4EgTrxTWG
Saving lives is just one part of the challenge. For every life saved, there is a lifetime of recovery. Dr. Ghanem re-sculpts the disfigured: “One of the most important things is the face, is how people identify themselves.” https://t.co/fCHPNdLXoF
The Syrian-American Medical Society is building more sophisticated underground hospitals now, including one in an excavated cave that will replace a hospital that serves 200K people. Private donations and the U.N. are helping to fund.
Before it’s fall last Dec., Aleppo’s underground hospitals were hard to destroy. Assad tried to root them out using chemical weapons. Two doctors told #60Minutes that during one attack they had only one tank of oxygen, so they transferred the mask among children. #60Minutes
Dr. Termanini says more than 800 medical professionals have been killed in attacks on Syrian hospitals. “Those are our heroes.”  #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/tokEWWVZPx
Dr. Samer Attar, a surgeon from Chicago, is one of many to enlist with the Syrian-American Medical Society, which has raised nearly $100 million in aid. He is one of many who have improvised care, sometimes in underground hospitals. #60Minutes https://t.co/sifwol1boZ
Targeting hospitals started the Geneva Conventions 153 years ago. It led to the creation of the Red Cross. Since 2011, there have been more than 450 attacks on Syrian hospitals. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
An estimated 400K people have been killed in Syria’s civil war. President Bashar al-Assad has committed nearly every war crime on the books so far. Now, he’s focused on the original war crime--targeting hospitals. #60Minutes
José Andrés has some 30 popular restaurants across the United States, but he's barely stepped foot in them for two months. He and an army of chefs and volunteers have been serving the people in Puerto Rico. #60Minutes https://t.co/rh295trMlj
.@chefjoseandres spent Thanksgiving in Puerto Rico, continuing to feed people one plate at a time. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
#60Minutes follows José Andrés as he feeds the citizens of the devastated island of Puerto Rico. How his cooking has changed since the broadcast first met him. https://t.co/WUQ5Crnp3O
Andrés’ presence hasn’t been without controversy--he called FEMA HQ in San Juan the most inefficient place on earth. And while FEMA did award World Central Kitchen to short-term grants worth $11 million, they didn’t grant him a third, longer-term contract.
Andrés has inspired others in Puerto Rico. In a church perched in the mountains of Naguabo, Pastor Eliomar Santana and his parishioners cook hot meals for neighboring communities with food Andrés has provided. https://t.co/l1qYSORoeh
At the height of the emergency, Andrés had 18 kitchens going at once, and used trucks, cars and anyone he could find to deliver meals, including, he says Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
“Americans should be receiving one plate a day of hot food. That’s not too much to ask in America.” --José Andrés to @AndersonCooper https://t.co/VD4FMdb0dP
With the help of private donations and money from the federal government, Andrés’ non-profit organization World Central Kitchen has prepared more hot meals than the Salvation Army and the Red Cross. #60Minutes
“The problem was the urgency of now. It’s a very simple thing when you’re a cook. When you’re hungry, you gather the food, you gather your helpers, you begin cooking, and then you start feeding people.”--José Andrés on feeding the people of Puerto Rico.
Andrés came up with his own plan to feed as many of the island’s nearly 3.5 million people as possible. He started with $10K and pockets full of credit cards. #60Minutes https://t.co/UVkSf7Pryk
When @chefjoseandres arrived in Puerto Rico shortly after Hurricane Maria, he and his team made about a thousand meals the first day. Now, they’ve served more than 3 million. #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/nwZaJZKk8Z

19 of the 22 players that made up the professional soccer team from Chapeco, Brazil were killed when their plane crashed last Nov. Nearly a year later, the victims' families and the teams' fans are trying to recover. https://t.co/3dzgKqOFT9
Every home game this season at the 71st minute, the crowd serenades both the new players and the old with “Vamos Chape” in honor of the 71 members of their community lost last year. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
For the widows of Chapecoense, it’s been tough to watch new players wearing their husband’s numbers. They say the club hasn’t done enough to help them.
Chapecoense’s president, known to all as Maninho, says he never seriously considered taking a season off to regroup. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
Not long after the crash, the club decided--for the good of the community and for financial reasons--Chapecoense would continue competing.
The widows each received payouts worth about 3 years salary from the club and the Brazilian Soccer Federation, but some have also filed lawsuits against Chapecoense. #60Minutes
Five days after the crash, the players’ wives were on Chapecoense’s field, not for a game, but for a funeral. #60Minutes https://t.co/0cMTaAAyiQ
Families, including the players’ wives, were told the airline had an invalid insurance policy. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
The flight’s pilot has received the bulk of the blame for the accident from various investigations. He took off without enough fuel. #60Minutes
Neto was in a coma for 9 days. Ruschel sustained a spinal cord injury. Follmann lost his right leg below the knee. #60Minutes https://t.co/7yzqYJxwsO
Miraculously, 3 players-- Jakson Follmann, Helio Neto and Alan Ruschel--survived the crash. “There was no sound at all. Only the wind,” Follmann says. #60Minutes https://t.co/7S2gZ4dZI0
Five days later, they chartered a flight from an airline called La Mia. How big of a moment was this for Chapeco? A local news crew captured the gleeful players as they boarded. https://t.co/n17yCqh8Rc
Last season, the little club punching above its weight secured a spot in the finals of the Copa Sudamericana--one of the continent’s most prestigious competitions.
With great pride, Chape fans will tell you their club has no Pelés. Instead, the team took on the characteristics of the city--unpretentious, unfussy, never outworked. #60Minutes
Matheus Saroli, whose father was Chapecoense’s coach and died in the crash, says he had never even heard of the club until a few years ago. By then, Chapecoense had risen from deep in the minors to the big time in just 5 years. https://t.co/kSyRBVVaG3
Closer to Argentina than Rio, Chapeco, Brazil is a city of immigrants, most coming from Europe in the past 100 years. And all of them worship one team, Chapecoense. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
In the most horrific sports tragedy in years, Chapecoense’s chartered flight ran out of fuel, and crashed into a Colombian mountainside, killing 19 of the club’s 22 players, and 71 passengers total.
The Voyager mission was only supposed to last four years. But four decades after the launch of Voyager 1 and 2, the spacecraft are still sending back messages from the farthest reaches of the final frontier. https://t.co/V1bfOjKZFZ
In about 10 years, when the Voyagers’ nuclear power runs out, chief project scientist for Voyager Ed Stone says they’ll continue to zip through interstellar space where they’re unlikely to crash into anything. Long after we’re gone, Voyager 1 &amp; 2 will just keep going. #60Minutes

Voyager 2 was the first spacecraft to visit Uranus in 1986 and Neptune--the most distant planet in our solar system--in 1989.
Their observations of Jupiter’s moon Europa suggested there could be an ocean beneath its surface.  And Voyager 2 sensed something unusual on Saturn’s moon Enceladus, where geysers of water were later discovered. (2/2) #60Minutes
The Voyagers haven’t found any extraterrestrials yet, but they have contributed to the search for life in space (½)
Ann Druyan--creative director of the team assembled to collect the sounds of our planet--included Chuck Berry’s song  “Johnny B. Goode” on the record. @SteveMartinToGo made a joke about aliens reacting to the Golden Record on @nbcSNL in 1978.
Each spacecraft has a Golden Record filled with music--from Mozart to Louis Armstrong, along with instructions on how to play it, photographs, and greetings in 55 languages. The records are mounted in a position no alien could miss.
Voyager 1 is now 13 billion miles away from Earth. Its radio signals travel at the speed of light and are sent by a transmitter that uses less power than the light bulb in your refrigerator. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
“Your smartphone has 240,000 times more memory than the Voyager spacecraft” -- Voyager’s chief project scientist Ed Stone

When Voyager 1 &amp; 2 took off in Aug. and Sept., 1977, they had cameras and sensors and Golden Records filled with the sights and sounds of planet Earth. #60Minutes

For the first time, Saudi Arabia is on the U.N.’s blacklist of nations that disregard the safety of children in war. The Saudis have pledged $8 billion in humanitarian aid for Yemen, but so far have delivered little of that. #60Minutes
Much of the world is unaware of the circumstances in Yemen because Saudi Arabia tries to keep reporters out of the war zone. #60Minutes producers were kicked off a plane and a ship en route to Yemen but 60 Minutes still managed to get pictures out. #50yearsof60
Lack of food and clean water has also led to a cholera epidemic that has infected more than 900K people in Yemen. The bacteria causes dehydration and sometimes death.
“If we don’t get the monies we need in the next few months, I would say 125,000 little boys and girls will die.” --David Beasley, Executive Director of The World Food Programme on #YemenFamine. #60Minutes https://t.co/YVYQ1d4w74
Beasley told #60Minutes that the World Food Programme’s ships are being blocked by Saudi Arabia, and asks that all parties engaged in this conflict respect humanitarian law.
Thousands have died in the war, but the deadliest weapon in Yemen is a blockade holding up food, fuel and medical aid. #YemenCrisis #60Minutes #50yearsof60

"Speaking out and creating positive change so athletes are safe is more important than any Olympic medal you could ever win" -- @Aly_Raisman
"Sit down with your kids and explain to them that predators aren't just strangers." – Lynn Raisman, @Aly_Raisman's mom
In a statement, USA Gymnastics told #60Minutes it “is very sorry that any athlete has been harmed,” and “we want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe.”
"It felt like I was like floating." -- @Aly_Raisman on her gold medal winning floor routine at the London Olympics

Why were five U.S. soldiers killed by an American bomber in Afghanistan? #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/5RHx8yqZjq
As for the B-1 bomber’s targeting system--it still can’t detect infrared strobes, which these soldiers think is putting others in harm’s way. #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/32oFGjOWbk
Anderson’s commanding general concluded he didn’t deserve punishment, but the accident effectively ended his Green Beret career. Montalbano and Branch were not faulted in the report. The Air Force controller was stripped of his combat qualifications.
And while the report says the bomber crew didn’t know their targeting system couldn’t see infrared strobes, &amp; that “the capabilities were not specifically covered…in sniper academics,” the Air Force General who wrote it also faults the controller and the Green Berets. (2/2) https://t.co/Z1LLZ3gY9Z
Among other things, the investigation found Anderson operated with a false sense of urgency. (½)
The Pentagon’s investigation spread the blame around to the Air Force Controller, the bomber crew and The Green Berets. But it singled out Captain Anderson. https://t.co/jWEjdxbbvX
Scott Studenmund, Aaron Toppen, Jason McDonald, Justin Helton, Justin Clouse and Afghan Sgt. Gulbuddin Sakhi were all killed. #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/ZBsveEL7a2
The report also concluded that the Air Force controller made a fatal mistake--he gave the bomber crew the US soldiers as their target. And the B-1 dropped two 500-pound bombs directly on them. https://t.co/zNCCreZnIH
Because the plane’s crew couldn’t see the Green Berets’ strobes, they mistook the soldiers’ gunfire for the Taliban. The investigation found that there were a series of critical errors that night, which all contributed to the accident.
The plane sent to support the Special Forces that night was a B-1, a high-flying bomber with a belly full of bombs, not typically used for close air support missions. It cannot, the soldiers say, see the infrared strobes the Green Berets wore that night. https://t.co/gQRWETx5Rn
The classified official investigation, obtained by #60Minutes, concluded that everyone--the soldiers, the bomber crew, the Air Force controller, all thought the B-1 was able to detect infrared strobes. They were all wrong.
Sergeant McDonald sounded an urgent alarm over the radio--”troops in contact.” The others say they had never heard such urgency from him their entire deployment.
Half a mile from the team commander, Army medic Branch was in a ditch with Green Berets Jason McDonald and Scott Studenmund. Around 8 PM, Taliban fighters started shooting into the ditch. https://t.co/37WbwRyeWi
The 95-man task force was dropped into the Gaza Valley to chase away Taliban fighters. Attached to the team was an Air Force controller who had been assigned to the team just 72 hours earlier. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
Anderson says the Taliban stepped up its attacks after the US announced most troops would be leaving there after June elections. https://t.co/fUQXYG6ybn
Green Berets Hank Montalbano and Derrick Anderson and Army combat medic Brandon Branch and their team were on their final mission after a 6-month deployment.
The Pentagon concluded the deaths were an “avoidable accident” of friendly fire. But three soldiers who were there dispute the official version of events.
On June 9, 2014, 5 US soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. It was the deadliest such incident involving US fatalities in 16 years of war there. #60Minutes

Koch then bought 4 bottles of “Jefferson” wine himself, spending over $400,000. #60Minutes
Collecting hundreds of millions of dollars in art, The America’s Cup in 1992, and a cellar full of the rarest wine in the world (2/2)
Koch was fired from his family’s company in the 80s, and sued his brothers for his share. He then went on a spending spree (½) #60Minutes
Bill Koch is a billionaire with deep pockets. The sibling--and a bit of a black sheep--of the famous Koch Brothers, Charles and David. https://t.co/64WSnCGMJ0
Why Oprah pitched a story on prisons. https://t.co/OHB5SBFjny
After 24 years in the Pelican Bay SHU, Clyde Jackson is now in the general population at Solano State Prison. https://t.co/db6ADevaqT
At Pelican Bay, the SHU is so empty that pods are now being converted to minimum security units.
California’s SHUs now hold 80% fewer inmates than just a few years before. #60Minutes
Pressure for change began to build in 2011, when SHU inmates organized hunger strikes and filed a class-action lawsuit. https://t.co/jKGVhYS9UK
Kernan--the man who runs the prison system—now believes that using the SHU to isolate gang members was a mistake. #60Minutes https://t.co/oqE6ovjCgF
Craig Haney’s studies of Pelican Bay SHU inmates have become central to arguments against widespread solitary confinement. https://t.co/ULwztw9aQA
At 17, Clyde Jackson was sent to prison for kidnapping, rape, robbery and attempted murder. But gang ties got him sent to Pelican Bay. https://t.co/TKJG6ronYj
Kernan says nearly all of the violence was and is caused by powerful race-based prison gangs. #60Minutes
At its peak in the 90’s CA corrections secretary, Scott Kernan, says Pelican Bay’s SHU held almost 2000 prisoners. #60Minutes
The only time a prisoner leaves his cell is for 90 mins of exercise in “the yard”, a concrete box at the end of a SHU pod. #60Minutes
Inside the Pelican Bay SHU, an inmate would spend up to 22.5 hours in his cell, which is the size of a small parking space.
The SHU is reserved for offenses committed once you're in prison. #60Minutes https://t.co/2Il8BQn2cv
Inmate Aron Franklin is serving part of his 50-to-life sentence for murdering a fellow gang member. But that’s not why he’s in the SHU. (½)
The trail to the American sleeper, if he existed, went cold. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
Esseghaier and his accomplice were tried, convicted and sentenced to life. #60Minutes
The FBI wanted time, but after the Boston Marathon attack, Canadian officials arrested Elnoury’s target-Chiheb Esseghaier-&amp; an accomplice.
Their New York trip included a visit to where the twin towers had fallen. #60Minutes https://t.co/q3Ms8tRjiC
While there, Esseghaier revealed plans to attack Times Square. (2/2) #60Minutes
In an attempt to coax information about an American sleeper agent from his target, Elnoury took him sightseeing in NYC (½)
The target planned to derail a train from New York to Toronto. Elnoury cased a bridge with him near Toronto and recorded it. https://t.co/fPXCNdWv6S
He passed that grilling, and was enlisted in what al Qaeda hoped would be its long frustrated encore to 9/11.
One night in Toronto, Elnoury was grilled by his target and three accomplices (2/2) #60Minutes https://t.co/EVCvWaRroz
After months of cultivating him, Elnoury’s target finally told him that he had been meeting with a senior al Qaeda member in Iran (½)
The history also had a fake personal tragedy. Elnoury said his mother died of neglect in a US hospital because of anti-Muslim discrimination
The FBI created a history for Tamer Elnoury--an online presence, an office for his company, fake IDs. #60Minutes
He met his target on a flight from Houston to San Jose during a planned “accidental” meeting called a bump. https://t.co/6HVp4F6Hm1
His legend, or false biography, was that of a wealthy Arab-American real estate investor with a painful, private grudge. #60Minutes
After the target got a visa to travel to the US for a conference, the FBI had Elnoury dangle himself as bait. #60Minutes
One of the biggest investigations of his career targeted a 30-year-old Tunisian studying in Canada. #60Minutes #50yearsof60 https://t.co/4AN1TT8ySy
In his new book, Elnoury writes about infiltrating terrorist groups at home and abroad. #60Minutes
Devoted to Islam and the US, comfortable working alone amongst killers, this undercover cop was a rare find for the FBI. #60Minutes
Tamer Elnoury, one of his many aliases, immigrated from Egypt as a child, and was raised in NJ in a traditional Islamic home. https://t.co/wfW7nJKEXs

Ex-DEA agent: Opioid crisis fueled by drug industry and Congress. #60Minutes https://t.co/dscAuPkhp6
Shon Hopwood was serving time for robbery when he discovered he had a mind for the law. Steve Kroft reports. https://t.co/Br68HCaG29
DEA whistleblower: Drug distributors fueled the opioid epidemic #60Minutes @washingtonpost https://t.co/i4ZyOFwrll https://t.co/q9WjtZoCki
Hopwood has continued to thrive--earning a fellowship at Georgetown where he is now a law professor. #60Minutes https://t.co/I17xVvn2qw
Hopwood landed a prestigious clerkship with the US Court of Appeals in DC, the 2nd most important court in the country.
Hopwood attended law school at the University of Washington on a scholarship. (2/2)
After 3 years working in the legal field, and finishing the degree he’d started in prison, he defied more odds (½)
When Hopwood was released in 2008, he had never seen an iPhone or been on the Internet.
That year more than 8K petitions were filed. 74 were accepted. 1 of those was written by Shon Hopwood. #60Minutes https://t.co/4ls7m8NSF1
And he identified errors made by lawyers and judges in the appeal process before crafting an argument in the language of the court. (2/2)
He spent months working on the petition, mastering the facts, statutes and legal precedents. (1/2)
3 yrs into his term, Hopwood was asked if he would appeal a friend’s case to the Supreme Court.
Inside prison walls, Hopwood won the respect of fellow inmates, and discovered that he had an aptitude for something: the law. #60Minutes https://t.co/fGEHCHfRXI
In 1997, Hopwood got a call from a friend asking to meet at the local bar for a drink, and listen to what turned out to be a very bad idea. https://t.co/WxSywbUvfH
The idea was to stick up small banks in tiny towns where there was no police and little risk of armed confrontation. https://t.co/daDwE0mizU
Now a professor at Georgetown, his students at Georgetown know he was a felon less than a decade ago.  #60Minutes https://t.co/23FJCZcHWn
Congressman Marino was just nominated to be President Trump’s new drug czar. #60Minutes @washingtonpost
Joe Rannazzisi now consults with state attorneys general who have filed suit against distributors for their role in the opioid crisis.
But the DEA's chief judge wrote that the legislation would make it "all but impossible" to stop an unscrupulous distributors. (2/2) https://t.co/fKEzCCK8GL
The drug distributors told #60Minutes the new law would in no way limit the DEA’s enforcement abilities. (½)
In 2016, Marino’s bill was signed into law. #60Minutes @washingtonpost
Rep. Marino requested an investigation into Rannazzisi. It went nowhere, but he was removed from his position at DEA, so he resigned.
The memo states the bill “could actually result in increased diversion, abuse and public health and safety consequences.” (2/2)
A 2015 DOJ memo obtained by #60Minutes &amp; @washingtonpost seems to support Novak. (½)
Frmr. DEA attorney Jonathan Novak says the bill really strips the DEA of its ability to freeze shady shipments to keep drugs off the streets
The bill, introduced by Reps. Tom Marino and Marsha Blackburn was touted as a way to ensure patients had access to needed meds. #60Minutes
In 2013, with Congress' help, the drug industry began to pave the way for legislation that would reduce the DEA’s power @washingtonpost
The DEA’s toughest sanction is to freeze distributors’ shipments of narcotics--a step they haven’t taken in nearly 2 years. #60Minutes
About 11 million of those pills went to Mingo Cty, pop. 25,000. He says he was thwarted by DEA attorneys. (2/2)
Jim Geldhof was investigating a distributor that shipped over 28 million pills into WV over 5 years. (½)
Rannazzisi says his bosses at the DOJ called him in to explain his tactics after he started going after Fortune 500 companies. https://t.co/jpc5goRIOP
In 2011, more than 17K Americans died from opioid Rx overdoses. That same yr. distributors started pushing back at the DEA’s Joe Rannazzisi
Distributors' fines have exceeded $341 million over 7 yrs. They complained to Congress that the DEA treated them like a foreign drug cartel. https://t.co/udTtI7BLyB

Las Vegas officers describe storming shooter Stephen Paddock’s hotel room #60Minutes https://t.co/ODMZWoNKWb
Instead, customers will order and pay at touch screen kiosks or from the Shake Shack app. (2/2) #60Minutes
Last week, Shake Shack announced it was testing a new concept with its latest restaurant--no one will be taking orders or cash (½)
Meyer's eliminated tipping in 9 restaurants, and upped base pay for servers and kitchen staff. He’s also raised menu prices significantly.
In most states, laws prevent servers from sharing tips with kitchen staffers. And Meyer found the pay disparity problematic. #60Minutes
Meyer’s most controversial innovation is also his riskiest--he’s trying to eliminate tipping.
He says, the key to hiring his 2,000 plus employees is choosing those who are intuitive and empathetic. (2/2)
Danny Meyer’s philosophy of hospitality has become a standard for the industry. (½) #60Minutes
Growing up in St. Louis, Meyer would create a culinary experience out of ballpark hot dogs. #60Mintues #50yearsof60
Fast casual, or as Meyer calls it “fine casual”, is the fastest-growing sector of the restaurant business.
Meyer says his Shake Shack burgers are so good because he uses the same ingredients he uses in his expensive restaurants.
Danny Meyer opened his first restaurant in 1985. He now runs 15, and founded billion-dollar chain, Shake Shack. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
What happened when Brad Parscale predicted a Trump victory to TV news organizations? #60Minutes https://t.co/hDoWjalvl2 https://t.co/YXqa9Wn9K4
Brad Parscale is already working on President Trump’s 2020 campaign. #60Minutes #50yearsof60
Last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to make political ads on the network more transparent. #60Minutes
Parscale says “it’s a joke” to suspect that he colluded with Russians in the campaign
@Parscale thinks one reason President Trump won is he honed in on something the RNC database identified but Clinton missed: infrastructure.
The Trump campaign microtargeted ads—unlike network TV ads, neighbors could get wholly different messages from the campaign.
Both campaigns used Facebook, but Parscale says the Trump campaign used it to microtarget on a scale never seen before.
Facebook says it offers all candidates “the same levels of support in key moments to help campaigns understand how best to use the platform”
@parscale says Facebook allowed him to “find…15 people in the Florida Panhandle that I would never buy a TV commercial for.”

@LVMPD officers say there were so many weapons inside the Las Vegas gunman’s room, they were “tripping over long guns.” #60Minutes

@LVMPD officers zeroed in on the shooter’s floor, just after a security guard encountered 200 rounds shot from behind the gunman’s door.

Will Christian Pulisic be the next big name in soccer? #60Minutes https://t.co/r9yNFPlPy0
He already has endorsement deals with Nike and Gatorade, and other European clubs have offered Dortmund as much as $40 million for him.
Pulisic’s biggest indulgence from his earnings was to take a private jet to join his friends at the Hershey High Senior Prom
To sharpen his skills, Dortmund uses their “footbonaut”, which fires balls at 60 miles per hour. #60Minutes https://t.co/amsRreg7hq
It took him a year, but he mastered German, which has endeared him to the notoriously tough Dortmund faithful.
He signed with Dortmund at 16, and enrolled in a German high school even though he couldn't speak the language.
And by the time he was 12, Pulisic was getting attention from pro scouts. #60Minutes https://t.co/PnpcFtE8A9
Before he even started kindergarten, Christian had mastered one of the game’s most difficult skills--playing with both feet.
Pulisic has scored or set up 9 of Team USA’s last 11 goals.
The team might not even qualify. When Bruce Arena took over the 0-2 squad in March, he decided to build around Pulisic. https://t.co/zIsQUoGXe2

Months after being ambushed by a gunman, Rep. Steve Scalise recalls how a series of "little miracles" saved him. #60Minutes
Steve Scalise returns to Capitol Hill for the 1st time since shooting to emotional welcome from members of Congress. https://t.co/IRBYszvjmX https://t.co/DjVggM7PTz
But hundreds of pieces of that single bullet will remain inside him for the rest of his life. (2/2) #60Minutes #50yearsof60
He says his doctors are optimistic he’ll walk again without help, and maybe even run. (½)
@stevescalise spent nearly 6 weeks in the hospital, 20 days in in the ICU. He lost 50 lbs. And, at 51, had to learn to walk again #60Minutes
Shortly after he arrived at Medstar Washington Hospital, doctors say they couldn’t detect a blood pressure for Scalise. https://t.co/aoMDzkfXqg
The pilot who evacuated @stevescalise later told Wenstrup: “I flew that bird like I stole it” of the 7-min flight to the hospital #60Minutes
Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup is also a combat surgeon; he quickly administered care to Scalise. #60Minutes https://t.co/vVgM74aG55
Transpelvic gunshot wounds can create internal bleeding that’s hard to stop. Rep. Wenstrup fashioned a tourniquet out of a belt. #60Minutes
The shootout lasted about 10 minutes and roughly 100 shots were exchanged. Five were injured; the shooter was killed
Because of his position as whip, @stevescalise has a police detail that returned fire, likely saving many other legislators. #60Minutes https://t.co/xWmBqZNDgs
Scalise: "'God, please don't let my daughter have to walk up the aisle alone.' That was the first thing that came to mind."
Scalise on the gunman: “I don’t think he coulda been in the right frame of mind.”
The shooter was James Hodgkinson, 66, whom the FBI says had posted anti-Republican views on social media. #60Minutes #50yearsof60

le Carré reads le Carré to #60Minutes https://t.co/pVnBYZ1KYk
le Carré  says the most depressing time in his life is when he’s finished a book. Luckily, he has plans for his next one. https://t.co/6AMkBXBBdT
le Carré’s novels have been printed in 43 different languages over the past five and a half decades.
There are no computers involved in his writing process. He edits with scissors and a stapler.
le Carré  says his characters never left him--they were “conscious companions at times” in his imagination.
For the first time in nearly 30 years, Smiley and his cohorts are back in le Carré’s new novel "A Legacy of Spies"
Smiley’s search for a Russian mole is the plot of the novelist’s most memorable success “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.” (2/2)
le Carré ’s favorite character is his portly spymaster, George Smiley (½)
He calls his den of spies “a half-dream world which I can inform from experience.”
Cornwell says le Carré ’s portrayal isn’t exactly an accurate description of his experience as a spy, but it is credible.
The book made le Carré  famous, but only British Intelligence knew who and where he was. It didn't want to blow Cornwell’s cover.
le Carré ’s "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" was the publishing event of 1963, spending 34 weeks at No. 1 on the bestseller list.
Cornwell worked for MI6 at the height of the Cold War, posing as a young diplomat at the British Embassy in West Germany. https://t.co/JVDUOVcJCv
Cornwell was raised by his father--a colorful, charismatic conman. https://t.co/j9gU4ocXHf
Cornwell created his pen name, John le Carré, while working as a British spy. He began writing fiction on his commute to work. https://t.co/EzwEAeGLoh
On the differences between the pseudonymous author and the man: David is a regular guy. John is a man of imagination.
le Carré : “Each book feels like my last book. And then I think, like a dedicated alcoholic, that one more won’t do me any harm.”

Ferencz has spent his life since the Nuremberg Trials trying to deter war -- and war crimes.
Ferencz says war criminals, in their minds, are patriotic human beings acting in the interest of their country: https://t.co/Mo18qwI8Mk
@LesleyRStahl asks if Ferencz met war criminals who otherwise would have been normal, upstanding citizens. “Of course,” he responds.
A Nazi defendant so enraged Ferencz that he imagined putting “a bayonet right thru one ear and let it come out the other”
One by one, the Nazi defendants declared themselves “nicht schuldig” – not guilty. But Ferencz had documents proving their guilt
In the ruins of the German foreign ministry, Ferencz’s unit found secret documents that reported the murders of over a million people
Ferencz tells @LesleyRStahl he’s still haunted by the things he saw and the stories he heard in the concentration camps: https://t.co/OZqpF2Z6g1

@andersoncooper asks the wife of an illegal immigrant why he deserved special treatment when other people have waited for years: https://t.co/nSLiN4ByQe
Under Pres. Obama, ICE agents focused on deporting convicted felons. @POTUS has made it easier to detain non-criminals.
Beristain’s wife says he’s not a criminal. The government says he was the subject of a “final order of removal” issued 17 years ago.
Since @POTUS took office, ICE has arrested over 5,000 undocumented immigrants who have no criminal record. That’s 2x as many as last year.
