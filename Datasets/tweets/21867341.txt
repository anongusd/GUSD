@immunetoboredom Same! Haven‚Äôt been to Monroeville, but was born in MS and been to Oxford many times.  And - yes - the courthouse gives you chills.
@immunetoboredom Agree with all this.  It was traumatic to read GSTW. And also agree TKAMB is superior novel.  Just wish I could still love it. Thanks for sharing.
RT @immunetoboredom: @jmpalmieri https://t.co/Q1frkelvWh
Interested to hear on this question from those who have seen the play. It saddens me to have lost TKAMB as a story about America I could love, but I have.
When I heard that TKAMB was coming to Broadway, I was intrigued. Figured they would find a way to account for the version of Atticus that was revealed in GSTW. From what I have read, play doesn‚Äôt do that.
In Go Set the Watchmen, Scout was the hero. As a young adult she had to come to terms w/ racist views of her father &amp; find a way to break from that past. Editors rejected it, they wanted to hear the story of Atticus as hero - and TKAMB was born.
To Kill A Mockingbird used to be my 2nd favorite book, until I read Go Set the Watchmen - the 1st book Harper Lee wrote, where her father wasn‚Äôt a hero.

@creynoldsnc That‚Äôs funny!
It didn‚Äôt make Hillary Clinton hard to work for - but it‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs hard to be a woman in politics and no matter how generous &amp; confident the woman in question is - the pressure she feels also gets absorbed by the staff.
No one ever told me when I worked for President Obama or President Clinton that I needed to put extra work into memos I did for First Lady Obama/Clinton - but I did. Because I knew they had to be perfect when they appeared in public.
Women politicians are held to a higher standard than male counterparts.  They have to be perfect. The pressure isn‚Äôt just felt by them, it‚Äôs felt by the staff too...
Feel the need to weigh in here bc it‚Äôs often said that a woman politician is hard on staff.  My experience is that it‚Äôs hard to work for a woman in politics - that‚Äôs different than the woman being hard on her staff.... https://t.co/FapfRbSYzA

@jonkerbryce @MonicaLewinsky Glad you found it so.
Not knowing what it feels like to be  threatened or powerless gives one a skewed view of the world. Makes it harder to understand other people &amp; easy to view world in simplistic terms. Men who haven‚Äôt experienced those feelings are ill-equipped to understand changing world. https://t.co/jpM972sDBd
Women are better at controlling our emotions than men because we have more experience at it. We often feel threatened or powerless &amp; try to appear calm. Kavanaugh‚Äôs tears of rage tell us feeling threatened &amp; powerless were new emotions for him. https://t.co/mnC8lLRbrg

@waltshaub Super helpful!
@risal770 Totally
@KennethBaer So stealth! Yes, an assistant secretary would be an ‚ÄúSenior Admin official.‚Äù  To address your point about ‚ÄúWH official‚Äù - SAP would be sourced as a ‚ÄúSenior WH official.‚Äù  And that could include OMB officials.  Even USTR.  But I doubt this person is from USTR.  Too random.
@risal770 Yeah. It‚Äôs never as interesting as you want it to be.
@johnobriant Yes. When I was in Obama press office a ‚Äúspecial asst to President,‚Äù ‚Äúdeputy asst to the President‚Äù and (most senior) ‚ÄúAssistant to the President‚Äù would all be sourced as a ‚ÄúSenior Admin Official‚Äù by NYT and other outlets.
@KennethBaer Not necessarily. A SAP (special assistant to President) would be sourced as a ‚Äúsenior administration official‚Äù by NYT and other outlets during my time w/ 44 and 42.
@MrGregTowns Also true
@ConnieSchultz You are a gem
Fwiw, based on my experience with NYT sourcing rules for Administration officials, this person could easily be someone most of us have never heard of &amp; more junior than you‚Äôd expect. Like a deputy at legislative affairs or NEC.

IT MATTERS &amp; shouldn't happen again but will if we continue to not take this assault seriously.
@CitizenCohn @MrWalterShapiro @JoshuaGreen @JBSDC @DouthatNYT MI &amp; WI wasn't enough, had to win PA too. WI was slipping, but thot it'd hold. PA was in worse shape so spent time there. I was shocked to learn on Fri Russia had our data &amp; surprised reax to news is to critique our campaign &amp; not fully consider what Russia may have done w/ data.

@susu1954 Didn‚Äôt say it was why she lost. Still think it‚Äôs worth learning from the experience.
@crisgdl I didn‚Äôt say it was why she lost.  I believe email issues was blown grossly out of proportion because it was really about being uneasy with her motivations and suspicions of her.  I believe it‚Äôs worth understanding what‚Äôs at the root:
@bearhill14 @HillaryClinton Everything you say can be true (not saying it it) and it could also be true that emails was a grossly overblown issue that was really about being suspicious about a  woman‚Äôs motivations.
If it wasn‚Äôt emails, it would have been something else.  Because at the heart of questions around emails, was suspicion about a woman hiding something.  Suspicion about Hillary built on years of suspicion about Hillary. https://t.co/b32fb4n5Sn
