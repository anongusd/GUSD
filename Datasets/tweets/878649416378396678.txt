@aquila_den @testisfidelis Thank you
@aquila_den @testisfidelis Ok, sorry about that. I think our talk is not going anywhere anyway. So just praying for peace in this world and want to finish this talk that is not helping to understand each other's point of view. Really nice to talk to you. God bless you.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis I accept already, Muslims are not doing what they should do and doing what they not allow to do. Killing innocents in wars, terrorists. And who are not involve in these things they are not sitting togather to sort out these problems and busy in their own lives. No care 4 others.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis Translations are wrong as they are not about people of Book to fight. This is an example what cause misunderstanding about Quran. You forget we are from One God Who send other Holy Scriptures as well. How can He ask to kill His own belivers? Make any sense? Think hard if you can.
@SecPompeo Pakistan is suffring from terroists itself, how can they provide safe haven to their own killers? Every country is responsible for their own safty and security and if they fail they should not blame other country who even suffring itself as well from same enemy of humanity.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis So Muslims behaving incorrectly that is not Islam's fault. Islam is perfect for all humankind but user of Islam are not following what they ask to do, where problems begin. Evil getting success there but in the end evil have no escape nor its followers.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis God never wrong and evil is messing up with Holy words mean, Holy books are right as God's words but who translate them to others they manipulate. My point is, God not talking to us directly so how can we prove Him wrong?He gave us understanding against evil so we need 2 use it.

@aquila_den @testisfidelis If you really want to understand all those incidents happened in history that are mentioned in the Quran then pls read history related to them. How and why this instruction is here only can be clear at you when you reach the depth. I assure you, God never wrong, evil manipulate.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis But it's no mean all Christians and Jews. Likewise, all Muslims are not perfect. Who follows a religion it's no mean that person is outreach from evil and mistakes. So these talks about them who were not on the right path and not followed their own religions as it should be.
@codeofvets 💐🎖️🤲❤️
@aquila_den @testisfidelis If you read carefully then you can see who are the topic (those who do not believe in God). Christian and Jews believe in God, yes? So it is clear from begining that Christian and Jews are not the subject of this verse and so on.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis 29: Fight those who do not believe in God, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what God and His messanger have forbidden, nor abide by the religion of truth-from among those who received the Scripture-until they pay the due tax, willingly or unwillingly.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis When Islam was new and Muslim were on risk from neiaghbour countries who were attacking innocents,there were clashes between them&amp;Jizyah was allowed2take from them when they defeated.But no brutality for them and no harm for olds, children&amp;women.Translation given wrong direction.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis Thanks for the reply. It is clear that written in brackets is the translator's own choice. First of all Christianity and Jewish are old and root branches of Islam. If Muslim does not believe that then they are not Muslim. So according to that, we are one and not out from Islam.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis They're not Muslim at all when they're not following what Islam is.If they take someone life they should punished for justice and hanged, this is Islam.I'm agree what Islam says so I'm Muslim.If I kill someone then the same punishment for me. Only God has the right to take life.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis Thank you for asking. Please search first which translation is written accurately or best rated. I have Talal Itani's translation in Amazon Kindle and it is easy to understand. Please let me know where you not understand and feel that is not looking right in translation. Thanks.
@testisfidelis @aquila_den Thanks for the webpage. IS is Evil and nothing to do with Islam. Islam is for peace and protection for all. There is no instruction for anyone to become slaughter like this. Who are allow this to happen they definitely will go to hell and will slaughter there. Shame on them.

Not just the line where is ask to punish someone but also whom. Keep remembering the Quran was sent when there were clashes between groups and guidance for them.
@aquila_den @testisfidelis If I say who are doing wrong should be punished then how I am a liar. If I am not telling truth about Islam then bring any single verse from Quran that allowed to hurt innocent or encourage to do crime. Bring it, bring it here to show everyone.

So he lured them with deceit. And when they tasted the tree, their nakedness became evident to them, and they began covering themselfves with the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called out to them, " Did I not forbid you from this tree, and say to you that Satan is a ...
But Satan whispered to them, to reveal to them their nakedness, which was invisible to them. (Al-A'raf)	He (Satan) said," Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree, lest you become angels, or become immortals." (Al-A'raf)	And he swore to them," I am a sincere advisor to you."
And you, Adam, inhabit the Garden, you and your wife and eat whatever you wish; but do not approach this tree, lest you become sinners."	Al-A'raf. Quran.

He (God) said," You of those give respite." (Al-A'raf)	He (Satan) said," Because you have lured me, I will waylay them on your stright path. (Al-A'raf)	Then I (Satan) will come at them from before them, and from behind them, and from their right, and from their left; and You...

We crated you, Then We shaped you, then We said to the angels,"Bow down before Adam; "so they bowed down, except for Satan; he was not of those who bowed down.	Al-A'raf. Quran.	He (God) said, " What pevented you form bowing down when I have commanded you?"He (Satan) said,"I am...

What you are promised is coming and you cannot thwart it. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the Possessor of Mercy. If He wills, He can do away with you, and substitute whomever He wills in your place, just as He produced you from the descendants of anothr people.	Al-An'am. Quran.
They all have ranks according to what they did; and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.	Al-An'am. Quran.
That is because your Lord would not destroy towns for injustice while their inhabitants are unaware.	Al-An'am. Quran.
They will say,"We testify against ourselves." The life of the world reduced them. They will testify against themselves that they were disbelivers. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
"O assembly of jinn and humans, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My revelations, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?"
Thus We make some of the wrongdoers befriend one another, because of what they used to do.	Al-An'am. Quran.
He" will say," The Fire is your dwelling, whrein you will remain, except as God wills. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.	Al-An'am. Quran.
On the Day when He gathers them all together:	"O assembly of jinn, you have exploited multitude of humans." There adherents among mankind will say," Our Lord, we have profited from one another, but we have reached the term that you have assigned for us."
For them the Home of Peace with their Lord, and He is their Master-because of what they used to do.	Al-An'am. Quran.
This is the straight path of your Lord. We have explained the revelations in detail for people who recollect. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
Whomever God desires to guide, He spreads open his heart to Islam and whomever He desires to misguide, He makes his heart narrow, constricted, as though he were climbing up the sky. God thus lays defilement upon those who do not believe.	Al-An'am. Quran.
When a sign comes to them, they say," We will not believe unless we are given the like of what was given to God's messengers." God knows best where to place His message. Humiliation from God and severe torment will afflict the criminals for their scheming.	Al-An'am. Quran.
And thus We set up in every city its leading wicked sinners, to conspire in it, but they conspire only against themselves, and they do not realize it.	Al-An'am. Quran.
Is he who was dead, then We gave him life, and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like he who is in total darkness, and cannot get out of it? Thus the doings of disbelievers are make to appear good to them.	Al-An'am. Quran.
So abandon sin, out-ward and inward. Those who commit sins will be repaid for what they used to perpetrate.	Al-An'am. Quran..

So that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it, and be content with it, and that they may perpetrate. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
Likewise, We have assigned for every prophet and enemy-human and jinn devils-inspiring one another with fancy words in order to deceive. But had your Lord willed, they would not have done it. So leave them to their fabrications. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
Even We sent down the angels ot them, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered all things before them, they still would not believe, unless God wills' but most of them are ignorant. 	Al-An'am. Quran.

And you were tought what you did not know-neither you, nor your ancestors. say," God;" then leave them toying away in thier speculation.	Al-An'am. Quran.
They do not value God as He should be valued, when they say, " God did not reveal anything to any human being." Say," Who revealed the Scripture which Moses brought- a light and guidance for humanity?	You put it on scrolls, displaying them, yet concealing much.
Those are they whom God has guided, so follow their guidance. Say," I ask of you no compensation for it; it is just a reminder for all mankind."	Al-An'am. Quran.
Those are they whom We gave the Book, and wisdom, and prophethood.	If these reject them, We have entrusted them to others who do not reject them. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
Such is God's guidance. He guides with it whomever He wills of His servants. Had they associated, their deeds would have gone in vain. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
And of their ancestors, and their descendents, and their siblings-We chose them to a straight path. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
And Ishmael, and Elijah, and Jonah, and Lot-We favored each one of them over all other people.	Al-An'am. Quran.
And Zechariah, and John, and Jesus, and Elias-everyone of them was of the upright.	Al-An'am. Quran.
And We gave him (Abrahim) Isaac and Jacob-each of them We guided. And We guided Noah previously; and from his descendants David, and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Aaron. Thus We reaward the righteous. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
That was Our argument which we gave to Abrahim against his people. We elevate by degrees whomever We will. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.	Al-An'am. Quran.
Those who believe, and do not obscure their faith with wrongdoing-those will have security, and they are guided. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
And why should I (Abrahim) fear those you associate with Him, and you do not fear associating others with God for which He sent down to you no authority?	Which side is more entitled to security, if you are aware?"	Al-An'am. Quran.
And his (Abrahim) people argued with him. he said," Do you argue with me about God, when He has guided me? I do  not fear what you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills it. My Lord comprehends all things in knowldge. Will you not reconsider?	Al-An'am. Quran.
I (Abrahim) have directed my atention towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth-a monotheist-and I am not of the idolaters."	Al-An'am. Quran.
Then, when He (Abrahim) saw the sun rising, he said," This is my lord,	this is bigger." But when it set, he said," O my people, I am innocent of your idolatry. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
Then, when he (Abrahim) saw the moon rising, he said," This is my lord."	But when it set, he said," If my Lord does not guid me, I will be one of the erring people."	Al-An'am. Quran.
When the night fell over him, he saw a planet. He said, " This is my lord." But when it set, he said," I do not love those that set."	Al-An'am. Quran.

It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. On the Day when He says:"Be," it will be. His saying is the truth, and His is the sovereignty on the Day when the trumpet is blown. The Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the Wise, the Expert. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
"And to perform the prayers, and to revere Him; it is to Him that you will be gathered."	Al-An'am. Quran.

none will be accepted from it. There are the ones who are deliverd to perdition by their actions. They will have a drink of scalding water, and a painful punishment, because they used to disbelieve. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
So leave alone those who take their religion for play and pastime, and whom the worldly life has deceived. But remind with it, lest a soul becomes damned on account of what it has earned. It has no helper or intercessor besides God. Even if it offers every equivalent,.....
The righteous are in no way accountable for them; it is only a reminder,	that they may be careful.	Al-An'am. Quran.

Say," It is God who delivers you from it and from every disaster. Yes then you associate others with Him."	Al-An'am. Quran.
Say," Who delivers you from the darkness of land and sea?" You call upon Him humbly and inwardly:" If He delivers us from this, We will surely be among the thankful."	Al-An'am. Quran.

It is He who takes you by night, and He knows what you earn by day. Then He raises you up in it, until a fixed term is fulfilled. Then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you used to do.	Al-an'am. Quran.
With Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except He. And He knows everything on land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but He knows it; and there is not a single grain in the darkness of earth, nor is there anything wet or dry, but is in a clear record.	Al-An'am.Quran
Say," If I possessed what you seek me to hasten, the matter between you and me would have been settled. God is well aware of the unjust."	Al-An'am. Quran.

When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say," Peace be upon you, your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself. Whoever among you does wrong out of ignorance and then repents afterwards and reforms-He is Forgiving and Merciful."	Al-An'am. Quran.
Thus We try some of them by means of others, that they may say," Are those the ones whom God has favoured from among us?"	Is God not aware of the appreciative?"	Al-An'am. Quran.
And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His attention. You are not accountable for them in any way, nor are they accountable for you in any way. If you drive them away, you would be one of the unjust. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
And warn with it those who fear to be gathered before their Lord-they have no protector or intercessor apart from Him-perhaps they will grow in piety. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
Say," I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of God, nor do I know the future, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only follow what is inspired to me. Say" Are the blind and the seeing alike? Do you not think?"	Al-An'am. Quran.
But as for those who reject Our revelations, torment will afflict them because of their defiance.	Al-An'am. Quran.
We sent the messangers only as bearers of good news and as warners. Those who believe and reform have nothing to fear, not shall they grieve. 	Al-An'am. Quran.

If you find their rejection hard to bear, then if you can, seek a tunnel into the earth, or a stairsway into the heaven, and bring them a sign. Had God willed, He could have gathered them to guidance. So do not be of the ignorant. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
Other messangers before you were rejected, but they endured rejection and persecution until our help came to them. There can be no change to God,s words. News of the messangers has already reached you. 	Al-An'am. Quran.
We know that what they say grieves you. It is not you they reject, but it is God's revelations that the wicked deny.	Al-An'am. Quran.
