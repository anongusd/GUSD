We have directed an Inspector General investigation and have taken other actions .  We will hold  our chain of command and private contractors accountable to ensure they are meeting their obligations to provide safe, high quality family housing.
Our most sacred obligation as Army leaders is to take care of our people - our Soldiers and our family members.  We are  fully committed to providing a safe and secure environment on all of our installations.
We are deeply troubled by the recent reports highlighting the deficient conditions in some of our family housing. It is unacceptable for our families who sacrifice so much to have to endure these hardships in their own homes.
The @USArmy is collaborating with the @usairforce, @USNavy, &amp; @USMC on modernization, multi-domain operations and hypersonic technology. Read about how we are working together and realigning programs to better prepare for future wars. 	https://t.co/TMQCJB2QE9 https://t.co/tX523kQguc
