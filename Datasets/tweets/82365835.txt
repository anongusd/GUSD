@jfreewright Jeffrey Wright has the most distinguished voice in entertainment next to James Earl Jones.
@BarakRavid @abbydphillip Incredible.
@NikkiHaley @jaketapper Otto was a criminal under North Korean law. 	North Korea does not recognize his white skin privilege, Ms. Haley.
@MalcolmNance Make that expert level, high plains grifters, Mr. Nance.
@IlhanMN Very good, Representative Omar.🙂
@TaraSetmayer ...but Ms. Setmayer, Otto was a criminal under the jurisdiction of North Korean law.
@RepJeffries Just the facts, sir.
@SpeakerPelosi Congratulations!🏛️
@michelleisawolf Michelle Wolf is a sweetheart.🥰
@RepKatieHill @andersoncooper Representative Hill is another rising star in Washington D.C.	---if she wants to be.
@Bakari_Sellers Well, I do...
@jemelehill This is the worst aspect of our democracy... the gall.	You gotta have a strong stomach for this 'cause behavior like rep. Jordan is disgusting.
@IlhanMN Ha HA HA  YUP!
@JoyAnnReid Creepy...
@michelleisawolf Good luck!   	Have fun!
@RepKatieHill @OversightDems We're watching, Representative...
@Lawrence Ya Know?
@JoyceWhiteVance Time for the acting-president to come home and face the music.⛓️🥁🎼
@jfreewright Heh Heh heh heh...☺️
@kasie I'm stunned yet... creeped out.	I-I … *sigh*
@NAACP @RepCummings Yup.	Contempt.
@TheRickWilson @joanwalsh HA HA HA HA HA HA AH...
@K_JeanPierre ...and looked into the camera when he revealed this.
@JamilSmith I *KNOW* my SAT score were horrible... especially the math section but I attended a high school that was in the process of desegregation and the teachers were awful to black students.
@MariaChappelleN Ha Ha HA!
@Phil_Lewis_ @jamdonaldson *sigh*	Ohh-h boy...
@K_JeanPierre @RepCummings I hope...
@MariaChappelleN Oh my gawd...
@vanitaguptaCR Ohhh-h-h... the irony.
@DrJasonJohnson Not a good student?!		Are you kidding?		trump owned his own university!
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump Which is why he's over there right now.
@RepJeffries Sad.	Isn't it?
@K_JeanPierre I'm almost tearing b/c this is where we are after such Barack Obama's non-threatening presidency... we're back to square one...	--- corruption in Washington, D.C.
@FredRogersPro @levarburton You are a legend, Mr. Burton. ☺️	I just wanted to say that.
@KatiePhang @PreetBharara YUP!
@PreetBharara It'll be interesting to watch the gop side of the committee try to downplay this stinging testimony.
@TheoHayesWBAL THEO!
@alexwagner BOOM.
@krystalball YUP!
@KarenAttiah @LoujainHathloul In due time.
@DrJasonJohnson Yup.	cohen confirms what we already know,
@JillWineBanks @RepCummings Wise words, ma'am.
@AprilDRyan @RepCummings I know, I KNOW!!!😞😑
@CapehartJ Trying to be boisterous like the Brits in Parliament.
@PreetBharara 'cause that's all he's left with.  He has absolutely nothing to contribute to the hearing except being a ________ head.
@JamilSmith Agree!
@crampell 'cause he has nothing else to contribute to the hearing.
@AriMelber Double jeopardy...
@AprilDRyan @MichaelCohen212 Those gop bombshells will be duds, Ms Ryan.
@davidaxelrod @GOP Yup yup!
@AriMelber Good questions, Mr. Melber.
@K_JeanPierre @RepCummings Yup, Yup...
@AprilDRyan @RepCummings Yup!  Yup!
@JRubinBlogger Such BS...
@KatiePhang Yup.
@AprilDRyan @CNN Such BS...
@K_JeanPierre @GOP Such bull - f_____ing  s____t.
@JoyceWhiteVance Heh.🙂
@KirbyKrackleArt @reghud @salcomicbookpro Jack Kirby's early '70s stuff was just raw!🙂
@maggieNYT *sigh*
@Lawrence Yessir, Mr. Lawrence!🙂
@NormaJTorres Appreciate your remarks regarding Black History Month, Representative Torres.
@SymoneDSanders Good for you, Ms. Sanders!🙂	I've always said that there are beautiful, decent, peace-loving, good people out there but they're surrounded by the likes of garbage like trump &amp; those who follow him.
@mrpolonog @reghud YUP!👍🏿
@RepJeffries I hear you, Representative.
@ChrisEvans @reghud HA HA HA!!!
@JerrellZod @reghud It was the best, most exciting, most anticipated Oscars night I've ever experience.	It was a good night.	I slept well after the event.😴💤💤💤
@finneyk @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper You guys are turning me into an American political junkie...!🏛️
@JamilSmith @RollingStone clarence thomas is such a cretin.	jussie smollett's career is not only in danger but, perhaps, his life should he be incarcerated.	...and I don't even know who the third subject is (and don't wanna know).
@MSNBC Really?	We'll see...
@KamalaHarris Finally...	THANK YOU, Senator!!!
@TaraSetmayer @BrookeBCNN @CNN I'll take a look...	re: reparations for slavery	I believe the issue should be discussed. The issue has only been on hold ever since the end of the Civil War.  Better late than never.
@TitmouseInc @chrisprynoski @RyanVerniere Hell.. most of all, support American animation!
@STLChessClub I'll take a look.
@kyrstensinema Prince was onto something:	"Sometimes It Snows In April"❄️
@PINAYJD Uh-Oh... the carnage begins.
@CahnEmily @SymoneDSanders I am seriously considering the republican majority leader as key component of the Mueller Russia/trump Investigation .
@TheoHayesWBAL Also, since someone offered, what is that person willing to pay?
@TheoHayesWBAL re: what do you think she can get for it?		Depends greatly on what she deserves.
@SymoneDSanders They've all the time in the world, Ms. Sanders.
@SteveCase @RonaldKlain @FreightWaves Railroad tycoons... made real.
@TaraSetmayer Good question.
@DrJasonJohnson @AmaraEnyia @LightfootForChi @ToniPreckwinkle Thank you for keeping us informed, sir.
@ChrisMurphyCT Reading opinions like that is similar to reading a comicbook with characters that speak w/empty word balloons.
@JoyceWhiteVance an excerpt:	When Benjamin Franklin was walking home from the [Constitutional] Convention, a woman named Elizabeth Powel asked him what type of government the Founders created.  Franklin replied with these words: “A republic, … if you can keep it.”
@mayawiley @SRuhle Already there...🙂👍🏿
@seungminkim @maggieNYT Hm.	I have not considered such a possibility.
@DrJasonJohnson Careful, Dr. Johnson...	You're making too much common sense.  We can't have that here!👍🏿
@alinaselyukh Wal*Mart... the glorified warehouse turned retail store.
@NPR I hope the animal lover doesn't consider taking the cat to court for compensatory damages.	I'm aware the point is to expose the outlandish cost of medical expenses but...	Did she not know to handle stray animals w/hand protection...? gloves $1 - $2.
@TheLastWord Yet another reason to legislate further safeguards in the Judicial branch of American government.
@RonaldKlain @GeraldoRivera Oh, yeah...  geraldo rivera searching the infamous Al Capone vault... and the Titanic, if memory serves.	Whatever happened to those days?
@SpeakerPelosi Good morning, Madam Speaker.🙂
@JoyAnnReid That's why we must investigate further election fraud into states other than North Carolina to make sure those unscrupulous members of Congress are not cheating the American people directly at the ballot box, Ms. Reid, regardless of their deceptions.
@MalcolmNance HA HA HA HA HA HA HA   Go 'head Senior Chief!👍🏿
@AshaRangappa_ Asha uses all*...😊		*a Heroes of Might &amp; Magic V reference
@Bakari_Sellers Oh my gawd… Heh heh heh🙂
@BetteMidler HA HA!!!
@JoyceWhiteVance HA HA HA!!!😃
@soledadobrien Cringe worthy, yo.
@MatthewACherry @jamdonaldson Yup.	I've always said that 'The Boondocks' didn't really need animation, especially anime (yuck!).	The sound production was suitable on its own with its cast featuring Regina King.
@ewarren @allinwithchris @MSNBC @chrislhayes Tuning in, Senator!📺
@BetteMidler Fascinating!	Looks appetizing...
@TheBeatWithAri @ElieNYC He's always funny when he's a guest.🙂
@PattyMurray Good luck!
@JRubinBlogger So it seems...	The energy is generating to the left... for now. 	The question remains, which Democratic candidate is going to be the conductor channeling that energy?	I have a feeling who that person is.
@TitmouseInc @chrisprynoski @RyanVerniere Good for you, guys!  	Support American artists!
@JoyceWhiteVance It's a process...
@JacksonLeeTX18 This should be interesting, Representative Lee.	By the way, good afternoon, ma'am.
@NormaJTorres Very informative questions at the 'Gun Buyer Background Checks' hearing this afternoon, Representative Torres.
@KristenClarkeJD Democracy is working just fine.	It's North Carolina that's broken.	Will someone please call for an indictment for this criminal?
@NewDay @DanaBashCNN WHOA!😲
@AprilDRyan AGREED.
@BirdieTold @JoyceWhiteVance Hear, hear!
Good night, everyone.👋🏿
@unholidiver @jemelehill I hear you.
@JamilSmith It's all good.  'Black Panther' got the nomination.  That's what is important.
@jemelehill It's a very good looking period piece.
@jemelehill Ha HA HA!   It's all good.  Black Panther didn't win, but the movie got sooo-o-o close.
@jemelehill Bunk that, Ms. Hill...	That's the third (maybe fourth) Run DMC song utilized in a television ad I've ever seen.
@MSNBC Mm...HM. 	Publish it.   Let's see it.
@JamilSmith HYPER - REALISM, yo!
@Bakari_Sellers Brooklyn's in da house!👍🏿
@ArvellPoe Don't worry... DJ MastrMynd… your time is coming soon. 👍🏿
@RealDLHughley HA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!   	Go 'head, Spike!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@wkamaubell Yup, used to love that TV show!
@SenSchumer @NYCHA @realDonaldTrump Absolutely, Senator Schumer.
@AprilDRyan Indeed!
@AshleyKSmalls Art of Noise - "LEGS!"👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@DrJasonJohnson Senator Sanders would be perfect to handle the domestic terrorist issue here in America, I'll give him that.
@kyrstensinema A much needed proposal.		Seems as if violet is your favorite color?
@sunny Yup!
@AprilDRyan Wakanda forever!
@sunny @iamRuthECarter Unbelievable... yet, believable.👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@tamronhall @ReginaKing Same here.
@K_JeanPierre I need to read this book.
@Sifill_LDF @ReginaKing @BealeStreet A very good sign!👍🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿	She had what it took when she was in 'Boyz n the Hood'
@K_JeanPierre @ReginaKing A good sign!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@JoyceWhiteVance @ChrisLu44 Agree.
@kasie @KasieDC I'm switching back &amp; forth between Oscars Live On The Red Carpet and MSNBC's KASIE DC.
@ReignOfApril @joanwalsh @theblackpanther I wish Ruth E. Carter the best of luck...	Even if she doesn't win in her category, it's still a win 'cause she's a contender!👏🏿👏🏿
@nprpolitics @NPR The puppet suspends China Tariff Hike b/c his henchmen told him the attempt was a losing battle.
@beguntosplinter @ed_naill @chisolm_john @AOC It's time for me to block you b/c you're asking silly questions.
@Bakari_Sellers Go 'head &amp; have that talk, Mr. Sellers.	I understand the American historic reasons why folks Down South dine on that... uh-h-h... delicacy (…?), but don't indulge.
@RWPUSA Nice Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote reference.👍🏿
@beguntosplinter @ed_naill @chisolm_john @AOC You're not very persuasive.  	There are more pressing issues than what you posit.
@CharlesMBlow @CNNReliable Will do, Mr. Blow.👍🏿
@hmcghee When I saw the smog on the horizon line off the coast of southern California so thick, it look as if a hurricane was forming... that's when I got choked up.  This was in 1994.   The issue is as real as cancer... literally.
@JoyceWhiteVance As I've written before:	Contradiction is an underlying motive of conservative ideology.
@GovHowardDean @K_JeanPierre YUP! 	That's why they must be dealt with in the future.
@perlmutations @MalcolmNance Severely limited vocabulary, Mr. Perlman.
@41Strange @reghud Looks as if H.R. Giger had a hand in this sculture/furniture.🙂
@CharlesMBlow @JoyAnnReid Yup.	Although, I have to throw a zinger in there from time to time before I do.🙂
@shashikapoor @JoyAnnReid @KamalaHarris Oh, yeah, that's right... both of them are from the West Indies.  	Haitian, if I'm not mistaken.
@FrankGiarra @reghud 'Easy Rider' beat out  George Lucas' 'THX 1138' that same year, but Lucas was still in college when he shot his student film.
@AOC Those billboards are actually assisting your popularity... 	--- in a good way.🙂	Go 'head, Representative AOC!
@LaurenDeWynter @ManyVids Good evening.  How are you?
@misterbasic @BeingtheThe @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC Been there.  Done that.  	It doesn't work when there are more moving parts than that.
@beguntosplinter @ed_naill @chisolm_john @AOC Not interested.
@Hemiheadx @misterbasic @BeingtheThe @Eli_is_Elite @AOC You don't know what I need or what I consider luxurious.
@Hemiheadx @deplorabl3_me @Eli_is_Elite @AOC There are 2 benefits: 1) generate income 2) w/out arrest.
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC This should be good, Ms. Reid!🙂
@misterbasic @BeingtheThe @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC If only there was a place w/euro-styled, roman styled architecture where we could all just pull up a table, offer some food treats, a beverage and just have a conversation abt whatever our daily concerns are.🏛️	Democracy is such a busy, messy business... yes?
@misterbasic @BeingtheThe @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC I was abt to block you, then I realized... we agree.😦🙂
@deplorabl3_me @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC Why not do both?   🤨	Decriminalize &amp; commercialize.
@misterbasic @BeingtheThe @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC The feeling is mutual.
@GovBillLee It would be prudent for you to consider resignation, governor and spare the Democratic Party any further grief.		Be a real man &amp; do the correct thing.
@deplorabl3_me @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC There wouldn't even be any concern for street weed rates IF WEED WAS LEGAL, now would it?	Think, bruh.  	THINK.
@deplorabl3_me @AOC Disagree.	I'm all abt uniformity. 	Go national.
@AOC Chris Rock said it best:	"Do you know what that means when you're paid minimum wage? That means your employer doesn't give a fuck abt you. If your employer could pay you less than min. wage, they would but IT'S AGAINST THE LAW."
@AOC Keep going, Representative AOC.		Take nothing for granted &amp; some 'em whatcha got!
@PamKeithFL @MalcolmNance Senator Fienstein is great in congressional hearing.  		She's a real poker player.
@New_Narrative @MalcolmNance They're laughing at him b/c they KNOW he's idiot [read: puppet].
@amjoyshow @MalcolmNance Mr. Nance made a very, very good point about the state trooper who arrested tim mcveigh.
@MalcolmNance Very good point abt the tim mcveigh story and the trooper who arrested him regarding trump ringing sirens for his supporters to commit violence against his rivals.
@kaj33 I remember when you played basketball in college, bruh.	How does it feel waking up every morning a legend, Mr. Abdul-Jabbar?
@BeingtheThe @cool_metal_dad @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC As if...
@reelestateone @AOC The puppet won b/c he defrauded the United States by conspiring &amp; coordinating w/foreign actors.
@growabrain222 @AOC You are absolutely correct abt being small.
@BeingtheThe @cool_metal_dad @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC As if those unfortunate things hasn't happened already.
@esglaude @davidgura @Mimirocah1 @TimOBrien @adrienneelrod So did I, Professor. 	Please come back.
@Harvard @KarenAttiah Written in beautiful, elegant American Spencerian script... the very trademark of an Esquire.
@RepEscobar Good morning, Representative Escobar!
@MSNBC Overheard these allegations happened back in '08. I'd wager that staff member will not forgot to bring her fork next time. I am certain that Senator Klobuchar expects the best from her staff. This is her method how to motivate her staff. No harm, no foul.
@BeingtheThe @Hemiheadx @Eli_is_Elite @AOC JUST DO IT.👉🏿	$22 PLUS an extra $2 for each year the proposal doesn't go up for a vote.	End of discussion.
@RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal @RepEliotEngel @RepCummings Agree.	Thank you, Representative Schiff!
@soledadobrien I wish people would cease citing the sex offender as billionaire as if his income status rules out his capability to commit sex crimes.
@jemelehill An excerpt from your manuscript, perhaps?
@glennkirschner2 @UPonMSNBC @davidgura @UpPastryPlate @MSNBC @PhilippeReines ROUND 1	FIGHT!
@esglaude I like your style on MSNBC's UP this morning, sir.
@UPonMSNBC @esglaude Chuckled at the D&amp;D reference!
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid Will tune in this morning, Ms. Reid!👍
@RevDrBarber Congratulations on the Board's decision for a re-election in North Carolina, Rev. Dr. Barber.
@DrJasonJohnson Use the Legos to construct an Executive Mansion (not a wall).  	13 Smurfs will convene as Representatives who will then appoint an Executive to occupy the Mansion. 	After a vigorous debate on blanket coverage on the cold bunkbed, the Reps agree to vote 13-0
@reshmasaujani @AOC One can definitely say this about Representative Ocasio-Cortez:		She has a aura &amp; energy that is irresistible.
@Eli_is_Elite @AOC Glad you liked my proposal!😊
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC Sound went out on The Last Word, Ms. Reid
@AOC I saw this video!  😊	Pet dogs can be fun!🐶
@JamilSmith Thank you for the update, Mr. Smith.
@AOC The need to legislate for a $15 p/hr minimum wage has expired, Representative. 		The rate should be adjusted to $22 p/hr minimum wage plus $2 for each year the measure doesn't go up for a vote.
@SteveKornacki re: Perry Mason	What do you know about Perry Mason?😊
@JRubinBlogger @BulwarkOnline Contradiction seems to be the underlying motive behind conservative ideology.
@Mimirocah1 @AshaRangappa_ stone was literally at the mercy of this powerful woman.  	She should have dropped the boom on him just to demonstrate what she can do with a snap of her finger.
@MichaelEDyson You have my condolences, Mr. Dyson.
@RealDLHughley ...and she wonders why she was booted off her own show, DL!
@thelauracoates @CNNSitRoom @CNN Great zinger abt roger stone/broken clock analogy, Ms. Coates!
@JacksonLeeTX18 @BarackObama So do I, Representative Lee.
@KamalaHarris Agreed.
@farhip @jaketapper The reason the family is suing is because their son will need that money in the future as his life is officially ruined... of his own doing.   [read: alliteration y'all!]
@dbryanjones @ProtegoPress @OpenAI @justinhendrix Yep...	Artificial Intelligence is the next frontier in governing. I foresee that a talented, charismatic politician in Washington D.C. with more than a rudimentary knowledge in A.I. programming can help provide solutions.
@Bakari_Sellers Right... exactly...  knowing when to quit.
@AngrySage2012 @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh, trump knows he's going to eventually wind up in federal prison.		He should count his blessings that the United States doesn't consider him for execution...   yet.
@VABVOX @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenGillibrand Dropped the BOOM on him.🤗
@maceface53 @NatashaBertrand 😄'The Pink Panther'!  nunes also known as the Inspector.
@jamdonaldson JAM!
@eaglescandy @MamurphyMaureen @NatashaBertrand At the time, nunes' facial expressions made him appear as if he knows what he is doing is going to ruin him but if he stays close to trump who conned everyone into becoming president, maybe trump will reward him with something in return.
@DevilDocWes @chelliepingree @BettyMcCollum04 @ScottGottliebMD @RepGolden @PeterWelch @RepKClark @DonYoungAK @TulsiPress @repblumenauer @RepPerlmutter @repmarkpocan @RepDianaDeGette Hemp has been held back for that long?!😞
@DonnaCOjai @NatashaBertrand nunes is more akin to co-conspirator, as it seems.
@maceface53 @NatashaBertrand I'm aware of this. 	The recounting of McCabe's (who's currently on MSNBC's The Last Word hosted by Lawrence O'Donnell) impression of that meeting is when nunes wanted to play the role of a spy for trump which makes him a co-conspirator.
@mikebuc67523134 @NatashaBertrand What a sight that would be!🤗
@robreiner mitch mcconnell, Edgar the bug man from 'Men In Black'.🐜
@Sifill_LDF re: clarence thomas...If only we knew then what we know now.   If only...	The man doesn't even speak out loud.  He just votes for republicans issues only. I wish someday he falls victim to his own traps that he sets for others.
@chelliepingree @BettyMcCollum04 @ScottGottliebMD @RepGolden @PeterWelch @RepKClark @DonYoungAK @TulsiPress @repblumenauer @RepPerlmutter @repmarkpocan @RepDianaDeGette Thank you.  	Would love to see hemp as a useful &amp; acceptable, as well as, a lucrative resource in American agriculture.
@NatashaBertrand What kind of power does devin nunes have???  	He [nunes] has this shifty-eyed, look of guilt on his face every time the cameras point in his direction.
@theangstydad @RWPUSA I hear you.
@richlawless3 @RWPUSA I understand Mr. Painter's point.	About sanctuary cities:  a by-product of careless politicians who refuse to find solutions &amp; refuse to work w/ concerned politicians who DO have solutions to this issue.
@CapehartJ I assume "Craig Melvin" host of MSNBC Live...?
@TheLastWord @Lawrence Good point.   Instead of governing, the acting-president is looking for someone to bully.
@crampell Not a coincidence.🤔
@jemelehill All of the online chatter [read: gossip] about Senator Harris can be found inside the forums at Reddit, Ms. Hill.
@CarlMcNeill5 @RashidaTlaib @RevDrBarber Do you know the difference between sarcasm &amp; polite adulation?	This is a rhetorical question.  Take all the time in the world to answer.
@landshark805 @RoKhanna I'm open to that idea.
@RWPUSA Agreed.
@RepEscobar Very informative meeting, and great questions asked at the 'Sexual Assault at Military Services Academies' hearing televised on C-SPAN3.
@RWPUSA That's not a bad idea, Mr. Painter. 	Maybe a Democratic President should propose such an action.
@timkstory Thanks for 'Fantastic Four' and 'Rise of the Silver Surfer'. A dream come true.
@RashidaTlaib @RevDrBarber Representative Tlaib!  One of my favorites after the mid-term elections!
@reghud @phillydotcom Wow.  	That is heartbreaking.😧	Seriously.
@RepKatieHill @HASCDemocrats I am thankful for you letting us know what's happening on the other side of the world.
@amjoyshow @AyannaPressley Ah! AM Joy finally booked Rep Pressley as a guest!   2 powerful black women on a live national television news program... on a Saturday morning.  	This combination did not exist 10 years ago.	A far departure from waiting for 'Soul Train'.
@JRubinBlogger Agreed.
@JoyceWhiteVance The NRA has been rather silent as of late.
@RoKhanna Question: Don’t you feel that you should know the financial dealings of those who sit in the oval office?		ABSOLUTELY!!!
@TheRevAl @amazon I am so proud of your continued success, Rev. Al. 	You may not remember but I once met you unofficially Summer of 1989 on Flatbush Ave. in Brooklyn, N.Y.	You were a very different man by appearance.
@amjoyshow @TheRickWilson Off-Topic: Rick Wilson was the dude who flew the colorful metaphor, "sh___ty" on-the-air on MSNBC's ALL-IN hosted by Chris Hayes when describing trump's presidential run in 2016. 	Mr. Wilson is alright w/me.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Individual-1 has decided to make his move w/this so-called 'emergency'.		Time for the democrats to take this problem to the next level for a solution.🎚️		Individual-1 asked for this.
@amjoyshow Great panel of guests on A.M. Joy this morning.
@K_JeanPierre Agreed, Ms. J-P.	There is a method to prevent creeps like trump from slipping thru the cracks &amp; ever entering the Executive's Office.	We just need a democratic congress &amp; a democratic president.
@K_JeanPierre He's fuller schitt.
@ATACXGYM As you have mine, sir. Welcome to 2019.
@NPR @nprscottsimon Erratum: should have read, "...didn't tone down his material enough."
@aeonimine @RashidaTlaib @RepMaxineWaters The Sumerians?  	I'll look into that someday.
@scott_m4 @1_thestrange @da_wessel @TheDemocrats Conjecture:	Speculation.
@JoyceWhiteVance @steve_vladeck Do you feel tread upon?🐍🤕		I feel a revolution about to erupt.🇺🇸
@crampell When a native Russian, as alluring as she, would rather stay in Thailand than be sent back to her country should be of concern.  Russia sounds like a wretched place to live... if you want to call that living.
@AshaRangappa_ Agreed.
@K_JeanPierre @MichelleObama Happy Birthday, First Michelle Obama!!!  The First Lady with the sweetest disposition ever married to a real American President I've ever witnessed.
@AshaRangappa_ That would be humorous.
@RepRobinKelly Doesn't feel like it, at all, Representative Kelly.
@MarshallJulius @thedailyjaws @starwars @StarWarsUK Casablanca (1942) "Here's looking at you, kid."  		However, usually I hear from that movie just "Play it!"
@SenatorDurbin @NPR On it!
@RWPUSA Interesting...
@Kaepernick7 @reghud Ali was so admired, even had a kid's animated television adapted in his image.
@MarshallJulius @reghud James Earl Jones' voice-work in the original 'Star Wars' drawls far more often than in 'Empire Strikes Back'; whereas 'Empire Strikes Back' became the definitive tone for the later episodes in my observation.
@mayawiley Unacceptable.
@MalcolmNance @JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Exactly.  The puppet is so dumb thinking he was 'getting back at her' neglected to consider exposing the security risks which is exactly what was the purpose of the Speaker's concern when her memo was forwarded to postpone the State of the Union event.
@1_thestrange @scott_m4 @da_wessel @TheDemocrats Disagree.
@hasanminhaj @MarieKondo Hasan Minhaj, the man who rocked the mic at the WHCD!🎙️
@AshaRangappa_ You were very informative on NPR regarding the puppet inside the Executive Mansion this afternoon, Ms Rangappa.🎙️
@angela_rye No, Ms Rye, YOU are amazing!👍🏿
@K_JeanPierre Anyone else notice that his signature looks just like indecipherable Russian scribble instead of the beautiful, elegance of American Spencerian script?  Coincidence?🤔
@RepEscobar @SenateGOP Agreed.
@SpeakerPelosi Will tune in!
@JillWineBanks Let me add: O'Rourke wasn't drained of energy b/c cruz was the better candidate (he wasn't). It's the fact that O'Rourke came soooo-o-o-o close and still lost. However, the information gained from the mid-terms revealed was that Texas desires new leadership.
@RepMGS Just goes to show how mysteriously, powerful &amp; ahead of its time that 1 document, The United States Constitution, was when drafted. It took the Digital Age for everyone to understand its true meaning.
@Sifill_LDF Just wait until his Congressional testimony.  A day long remembered.
@RepMGS Good luck!
@MariaChappelleN Abstain.
@soledadobrien @matteroffacttv You were great on C/NET Central back-in-th'-day.
@TaraSetmayer Notice that the use of the word "...Right..." is capitalized?
@JillWineBanks A 20 page memo at that!  1 page is a memo but 20 pages?  That's a dissertation.📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃
@JillWineBanks I can imagine that after being defeated by cruz in the mid-terms, took a lot of energy out of O'Rourke. It must be difficult to muster up the strength to recover from such an event. He needs rest and reflection to continue.
@ThePatriotsGame @K_JeanPierre Now that is an image I'd like to wipe from my memory.🧠😑
@AppropsDems @NitaLowey @Morning_Joe @MSNBC @HouseDemocrats Watching you right now, ma'am.
@DrStaceyPatton Not to be too analytical but when I say, 'applying the knowledge', I mean...take your personal experiences, education, whatever tools you have at your disposal, however miniscule &amp; apply that to solve problem X.
@mayawiley *UGH* Modern American politics...	---not for the feint of heart.🤭💔
@DrStaceyPatton Applying the knowledge is what is key here, Dr. Patton.
@da_wessel @TheDemocrats $15 min. wage will not cut it. Make it $22 &amp; +$2.00 for every year the measure doesn't go up for a vote.
@K_JeanPierre Further, if fox news didn't exist, puppetine would NEVER get elected president of the United States. Never. 	...and his election results are still questionable to me.
@cspan @AOC (applause)👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@finneyk @NBCChicagoPD @AnneHeche I truly dislike crime dramas but Anne Heche has a inescapably, strange history in her personal life that allows her to be heckled relentlessly in public. Seems like that strangeness has followed her to this gig.
@DrStaceyPatton Indeed. Look to history how Rome fell. One may wonder, how did that happen? Why didn't the people rise up &amp; prevent this? Look today, &amp; see who refused to rise up &amp; prevent what this Republic is going thru right now &amp; you will find your answer.
@K_JeanPierre It's difficult... it really is. Our Republic is crumbling right before our very eyes &amp; hangs in the balance of just a few unscrupulous egotistical men running from prosecution.
@AshaRangappa_ Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@mayawiley Certainly looks like it.
@AlienBlackout What I love abt Alien: Isolation is that the game's design follows philosophy of the legendary Eugene Jarvis: 1) Fantastic particle effects 2)Physics 3) Simple A.I. rules. When these 3 elements come together form beautiful, unpredictable, replayable gameplay.
@xAndrewJJx @AlienBlackout I have the same feeling.
@Ramon73Juan @AlienAnthology @AlienBlackout I've played &amp; enjoyed only 1 mobile game in the Alien series; Alien: Infestation (DS). Alien: Blackout really looks good. I wouldn't mind playing it on the PS Vita.📱
@RonaldKlain @Lawrence @TheLastWord Already there!
@dinatitus Very good appearance on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show this evening.
@davidrosscr8s @Evan_Rosenfeld @ChrisCuomo Agreed.
@repdinatitus Great showing on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show this evening.
@jemelehill @TheAtlantic Ranked 6th out of 50 makes you... exceptional, Ms Hill.☺️
@Tamira47 @RepJeffries You misunderstand. Can you cite an example in American history in your lifetime where the Speaker of the House of Reps didnt send an RSVP to deliver the State of the Union to an American President who didn't agree to sign off a budget agreement for 26+ days?
@TheLastWord Not acceptable. 	There is a criminal hiding in plain sight inside the Executive Mansion pretending to be a U.S. President and being protected by republican politicians.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
@SymoneDSanders She has to live with racism &amp; bigotry everyday in 2019, too.  She just chooses to ignore the problem. You're right by bringing the issue to her attention just to remind her.
@jamdonaldson What the hell does Russia over these republican M/Fers?  Who're the Senators who down voted easing sanctions against Russia?????	Something is up.
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump That quip would very funny if it were not so depressing.  	After all, comedy is tragedy.
@RepJeffries This is uncharted territory.
@maziehirono Watching you right now on C-SPAN3
@morgfair @MalcolmNance A bit distracting to take someone seriously in politics who resembles Pauly Shore.🎥
@mayawiley @AriMelber Heh heh heh…😊 	Ari Melber is turning into a rock star at MSNBC. 😊
@NPR It was inevitable. They're giving customers the content they've always wanted. Now, they expect their customers to give them what they want...	---accepting a rate hike.
@JamilSmith @PeterBeinart I'm at a loss for word. Totally blown away at this news this morning.😊
@newrepublic I don't.👎🏿
@maggieNYT @kasie Agreed.
@maura_healey Congratulations!
@jfreewright You were great in 'Source Code'.🎥
@ChrisCuomo He is, perhaps, the most ridiculously stupid person I've ever seen in such a position. 	Has no idea what he has gotten himself into.
@SenKamalaHarris I wish Spectrum would stop creating technical difficulties whenever C-SPAN House of Representatives goes live. Been having this problem ever since AFTER the mid-term elections.  Would someone please help contact Spectrum in South Carolina?
@MichLKosinski Why would he give a s_____t? 	His stank ass is not out there doing any fighting for his country. His entire career consisted of sitting on his rump &amp; running his mouth behind a microphone. 🎙️
@juliehdavis @maggieNYT I wonder which Democrats are in agreement with this kind of coercion?
@JoyceWhiteVance Methinks barr's involvement in reagan's little pet project, the Iran-Contra affair, should be disqualifying enough.
@WashPostPR I wonder what these unofficial newspaper contain? Whatever, these forged papers are I'd advise caution displaying its content. Perhaps, that was the intent of the forger.
@NPR Sounds familiar...	Nonetheless, sounds like a potential hit.
@AJ_Asamoah @SymoneDSanders Speaker Pelosi exclaimed, 	"Rook to B4, check. Move your king."☺️
@Me75327714 @SymoneDSanders Y'know um sayin'?☺️👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿(applause)
@SymoneDSanders That's how you exert power 'cause knowledge is power. 	Rep. Pelosi just made me a fan of hers!
@NydiaVelazquez @HUDgov @realDonaldTrump We hear you!
@robreiner We are living in a bizzaro world, Mr. Reiner.
@K_JeanPierre Figures... thanks for keeping us informed, Ms. J-P!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿(applause)
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService Wise move Rep. Pelosi! Misjudged you, too. Extremely impressed. You are certainly worthy of t/Speakership. Couldn't imagine an American President addressing Congress, t/Judicial &amp; the American people "The State of the Union is strong!" who refuses to govern.
@RepMaxineWaters @CBSNews You are amazing! You have persuasive abilities, too, ma'am!
@mayawiley The acting-president has no concern to govern; the census helps provide businesses information on how much money can be generated within certain districts. If the information isn't accurate in certain communities, businesses will not locate there.
@JakeSherman @SymoneDSanders Man... he's worse than me; I don't much about what's going on at Capitol Hill but this guy is supposed to head the entire Executive Branch and asking such questions.
@MaddowBlog I misjudged Sen. Schumer.  He does have persuasive abilities and can negotiate with efficiency in accordance with his seniority.
@KeithOlbermann Correction:  "...and a former gop Michigan governor..."	Those typos...!😞
@KeithOlbermann He's a former gop governor...  figures.😒	...and his misogyny is showing, too.	Another gop trademark.
@ShaneGoldmacher @maggieNYT That's great news! 	A young, freshman Representative granted a seat on a committee within a few weeks.
@IlhanMN @MSNBC You are always welcome at MSNBC, Representative Omar.	I have a very good childhood friend from Queens, NY named Omar.
@TaraSetmayer Hm.🤨	I dunno…	Yet, you were on CNN a week ago speaking the same gop talking points from the mid-90s somethin' about "...Democrats support distribution of wealth..." opposite of Angela Rye; do you not know that line came straight from a video game?
@AshaRangappa_ @MalcolmNance Wimpy, indeed.👍🏿
@staceyabrams Amen!
@SenSchumer b/c reducing sanctions on Russia was... 'Part of the Deal'. 	(get it? rhymes w/art of the deal...?) 		Oh, never mind.
@hues_of_thought @MarkSinatra @DailyCaller @ErinBurnett @joanwalsh Actually, his 3rd wife probably sucks blood considering she resembles one of the vampire villains in 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'.
@leahmcelrath @MalcolmNance @ComdtUSCG I remember when I was in the Navy when this gov shutdown business started in Congress &amp; hearing the higher ranked fellows who were into politics contemplating the possibility of not receiving a paycheck; it has finally happened. Imagine receiving this memo...
@KamalaHarris ...and we are in agreement w/you.
@mayawiley If what you heard is true ('cause I didn't hear it; away from desk), he should be reminded there is an assortment of religions all over the U.S. … Which religion was he referring to?
@MarkSinatra @DailyCaller @ErinBurnett @joanwalsh We're not living in a 'traditional' era; why don't trump prepare salads for his guests?
@kathygriffin Tell 'im, girl!👍🏿
@common Go 'head, Common!
@AyannaPressley A real man and a soldier.
@kasie Representative Rush votes "No" [translation: "Oo-o-o, massuh gon' git me...!"]  		rep. steve king votes "Yes" [translation: "I'm so bad, I can suck my own d!ck."]
@JoyAnnReid I saw!	Politics, nationally and around the globe is getting exciting!
@hmcghee @allinwithchris @MSNBC Will tune in!👍🏿
@mayawiley barr needed that quick testosterone rush from sen. kennedy in those exchanges, is all.
@mayawiley Sen. Hirono is one of my favorites; I wish her a prosperously healthy &amp; speedy recovery to her condition.
@mayawiley Apparently, barr is no stranger to corruption. He probably thinks this is just another day at the office w/out concern of the inherent dangers of the acting-POTC as a foreign agent.
@BostonJerry Every time someone refers to the Executive Mansion in Washington DC as 'The White House', you are contributing to racism; from a certain perspective, 'The White House' says to the world,  'whites only' or 'whites in power'.
@AriMelber Does that mean the possibility of barr taking control of the investigation &amp; shelving it if the report does not meet his expectations?
@mayawiley cruz is essentally prompting barr to espouse his extreme right-wing views during his session.
@seungminkim Remember: fox news would be immune if he agrees.  Unfortunately.
@mayawiley Sex trafficking is complex b/c the practice is intertwined w/BDSM and its merchandising; there are people in law enforcement and the judicial branch involved, as well.
@mayawiley People w/out morals are not concerned abt limitations to what brings them pleasure.
@DrJasonJohnson Without an official Law Enforcement Code of Conduct or Law Enforcement Code of Justice, things like this will (and can!) occur often.
@upyour6 @TeaPainUSA Actually, mcconnell looks like Edgar the bug man from 'Men in Black'.🐜
@reghud Agreed.
@kasie @clairecmc Congratulations! I'm am 100% certain her experience &amp; expertise in Congress will yield useful information on these trying times at MSNBC.
@JoyAnnReid On Martin Luther King Jr's birthday, too!💪🏿💪🏿
@JoyAnnReid Hooray for Democracy, indeed!💪🏿
@soledadobrien I know how that frog feels. 🐸
@TheBeatWithAri O.K.... I missed that part mentioning the president bullying him. I misheard while live Tweeting.
@mayawiley barr described fentanyl as the "the new crack".  Considering how crack hit &amp; who put the poison on the streets in American communities (particularly populated by people of color) in the 1980s, that's a very, very very implied and complex statement.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yup.
@mayawiley barr mentioned those he thinks that would bully him (the press) but he didn't mention the acting-president (who actually is a bully).  How in the world can the press bully him?  They're just reporting what they see, and hear.
@JRubinBlogger I can tell you right now what I'm seeing, experiencing and reading about what's coming next in digital technology; words &amp; tweets WILL matter. How do you feel abt digital Wi-Fi internet micro implants that's promotes hands-free devices simulating telekinesis?
@Gmasterg4 @STLChessClub ...with a healthy reserve of pawns on the F, G and H files.
@mayawiley Interesting seeing Senator Leahy alive and well after that dubious Superman vs. Batman movie.✌🏿
@TheRevAl WPIX... channel 11 on the dial.*		*remember the dial on the cathode ray tube television?
@Marvel @DrJasonJohnson Was that Mysterio? 🙂
@mayawiley Whenever chaos &amp; mayhem is brought into law &amp; order, wouldn't that constitute "corrupt intent"?
@NatashaBertrand Ever since Col. Oliver North's testimony in the Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s... that's why republicans say that.
@mayawiley @neal_katyal @TheBeatWithAri That way, he can be boxed in when this candidate decides to retreat on the same issue.
@billmcNichols54 @mayawiley Didn't know barr was a part of that debacle.
@mayawiley You are correct. I wanted to add that barr not see himself as 'the president's lawyer' but didn't want to copy Sen. Feinstein's introduction in this hearing.
@mayawiley Those warts on his face can really creep you out if you're unfortunate enough to own a super 3-D HD television; for once I'm relieved to have a lower resolution television.📺😥
@hmcghee Yeah... slave wages.  fighting to legislate for an increase in minimum wage to $15 has expired; legislate for a $22 increase &amp; an extra $2 for each year the measure hasn't come up for a vote in Congress.
@jemelehill @TheAtlantic Ranked 6th rates you above average...	---not too shabby.🙂
@amyklobuchar @Morning_Joe I look forward hearing very intrusive, probing, invasive questions from both political party members that challenge this candidates' integrity in maintaining the Rule of Law that is in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.
@LukeEasterling @jemelehill *sigh*   Such a classy guy...
@TheRevAl Yes, Happy Birthday, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.!
@maggieNYT This is the part in the movie where the villain(s) show their weakness by squabbling amongst each other while the tied up hostages look on.👀
@JoyceWhiteVance As D.L. Hughley once joked, "The blue book value of the American President has been lowered considerably."
@jfreewright heh heh heh… hamberders…🍔🙂
@AprilDRyan Congratulations, Ms Ryan!
@RicoSuaveJD @JoyAnnReid Good point!  Why do you think they're called 'nut jobs'?
@AlienBlackout ...or bird's eye view.🦅
@AlienBlackout Perhaps from all of the traumatized gamers from Alien: Isolation, the game designers decided to change the perspective from 1st person to 3rd person.😏
@soledadobrien March of the Trolls
@levarburton Would You Like To Know More?	https://t.co/5Wkm0vySza
@levarburton Fresh Wassup with you?*		*from the movie 'Cars'😏
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber That clip you showed of Robery Mueller speaking about the consequences of government shutdowns... that's the first time I've ever heard him speak until now.
@kasie @KasieDC Would be nice if MSNBC's Kasie DC hosted by Kasie Hunt replaced the timeslot held by Hardball hosted by Chris Matthews.  Just sayin...😏
@JoyAnnReid What do you expect from an uncouth slob?
@TheBeatWithAri @neal_katyal Great show; yet bittersweet and sad.😥 I'm relieved that more &amp; more people understand this counterintelligence crisis everyday.
@JoyceWhiteVance All the resources that a sitting U.S. president needs to run the executive branch of a nation's government and this current guy disregards all of that as if none of that is necessary &amp; he has the experience to proceed.
@kasie @MittRomney @frankthorp I'll believe it when it happens.
@RealDLHughley That's why judicial, criminal justice and law enforcement reform is desired in the future.
@JoyceWhiteVance @TheBeatWithAri @mayawiley @AriMelber On it!
@RashidaTlaib @RepMaxineWaters Didja know that the numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are all Arabic in origin?
@factsimile1 @NatashaBertrand Try thinking before you post.  		Works for me.  Can work for you, too.  I promise!
@MidwinCharles Exactly...	Don't.	Feed.	The.	Trolls.
@morgfair I am, too.
@RashidaTlaib Yes, please, Representative Tlaib… Don't stop fighting. Keep the heat up when you can and remember this: profanity is a stress reliever.  When the time is right, LET'S IMPEACH THE MUTHAFUCKER!✌🏿
@abbydphillip Right?😄  Heh heh heh heh heh
@AshaRangappa_ What I find amusing is that trump really think that Americans (in-the-know) are stupid and can be ignored regarding his involvement with Russian politicians &amp; spies; He probably goes back to his Russian contacts asking, "They know. What do I do next?"😓
@HillaryClinton YUP!
@BarbMcQuade @benjaminwittes @kasie @mitchellreports @MSNBC Gotcha.
@SymoneDSanders That's right. 	I hadn't considered that.
@SymoneDSanders @CBS CBS is, perhaps, composing a press release for a feeble excuse as I type this.
I'm in agreement w/the more civil comments; License holders of Alien series could've made a worse decision. This isn't one of them.
Alien Blackout backlash shows fans and creators see mobile very differently https://t.co/1L8BgLEvEL via @thenextweb
@MarkHarrisNYC @joanwalsh HEH HEH HEH… I know, right?  What he really means, "I volunteered!"👍🏿
@TheRickWilson @reghud YUP!  Representative Ocasio-Cortez came to play.
@JayCuervo @reghud YEP! (applause)👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@MauriceAshley Good to see you back 'in the game'.
@Yamiche @abbydphillip @NABJ Ms. Alcindor, you must learn how not to 'feed the trolls'.
@JillWineBanks I've been meaning to comment on that pin before the 'Frogger' pin; Nice interpretation of Ol' Glory; Ol Glory has 6 white stripes, 7 red stripes.
@AOC BINGO!
@MSNBC @PeteWilliamsNBC TOLD YA!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@jimsciutto @CNNnewsroom @LindseyGrahamSC As the more informed political pundits have phrased over the weekend, "...this is the hill the acting-prez wants to die on."
@RepTipton Why should fallen law enforcement officer's names be enshrined on post offices &amp; not fallen military veterans?
@lachlan @soledadobrien @woodruffbets Now we understand why every (white) American civilian was afforded military grade weapons, committing heinous acts of murder every few months; Our enemies were picking us off slowly but surely from within our own borders &amp; the NRA was IN on it.
@cmclymer @soledadobrien Whatever is uncovered on honey graham probably has much to do with what's happening in So Carolina; [read: voting fraud].  honey graham certainly doesn't speak for me.
@Mimirocah1 @RonaldKlain Your political commentary is useful information on MSNBC.	At least, to me.
@AshaRangappa_ Republicans was so desperate to gain control of the Exec Off and Congress w/SCJustice pick neglected the possibility that their key candidate is a Russian asset; mcconnell &amp; his cohorts should be a targeted for investigation.
@NatashaBertrand We hear you. We're just preoccupied w/real life and other priorities.
@RepMaxineWaters Agreed.
@RealDLHughley Doesn't work that way. The people I admire got where they are b/c someone helped; they didn't get there by themselves. Just as easily as they 'got it', lost it all b/c of interference; someone took it all away. Bill Cosby is a perfect example of this.
@JoyceWhiteVance @PhilipRucker @petermarksdrama I am so relieved that the show, 'Hamilton' is doing well in Puerto Rico.🇵🇷
@bringonthebeans @CaryHaskin @JoyceWhiteVance Agreed.
@sanityzone @JoyceWhiteVance @SenateGOP @senatemajldr Disagree.
@sanityzone @JoyceWhiteVance @SenateGOP @senatemajldr Everyone understands what the problems are in local/state politics. That's not relevant. Once the Democrats gain 100% control of Congress &amp; The Exec Off. extreme measures are gonna be taken. Laws can be repealed &amp;/or outright abolished.
@sanityzone @JoyceWhiteVance @SenateGOP @senatemajldr The turkey-necked senator f/Kentucky 'thinks' he's "...playing the long game." The new Democratic maj. of the 116th Congress is planning to bring the political pendulum swing to a permanent halt once they gain 100% control of Congress &amp; The Exec Office. Watch
@GameOfThrones Let me just say, I remember watching the 1st season on HBO upon its premiere and knew the show was an instant classic but never imagined its tremendous success season after season was altogether...unexpected.
@NBCNightlyNews @MSNBC @tvkatesnow This is an achievement I'm proud of.
@skboake @MalcolmNance Did you know that Benjamin Franklin supported the abolition of slavery in America?  He just didn't have enough support to begin the process, however, he definetly drafted the outline.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I have a suggestion: rather than treat this debacle by sayin' "Reopen our government." as if he was a gatekeeper, try holding this man to his oath that he took in January 2017:  Demand that he 'resume governing'.🏛️ 'cause what he is doing is not governing.
@Lawrence I've said this all along... political pundits, news anchors and commentators should caution themselves when reading his Twitter feed b/c all they're doing is helping him. If anything, they should make fun of him 'cause it's so easy.
@ArvellPoe Heh heh heh😀 Nice.
@sanityzone @JoyceWhiteVance @SenateGOP @senatemajldr Yep. trump election was all about getting SC justice pick but at what cost? Democrats will eventually take control of both chambers in Congress &amp; Exec Office to compensate for Judicial branch losses considering that more &amp; more citizens are aware each day.
@JoyceWhiteVance That is why the Russia investigation is of the utmost importance; We are faced with two major world powers (the U.S. &amp; Russia) armed with nukes in the hands of two men; 1 of 2 too stupid to fully understand why these deterrents exist in the 1st place.
@JoyceWhiteVance Cold. Hard. Evidence.    	That's what it'll take. I believe the Mueller investigation will deliver. I'm reading a lot of on-line chatter that the up-coming report will be underwhelming; I don't believe that, at all. Way too many questions, not enough answers.
@AshaRangappa_ That person is into BDSM, looking for a submissive, all of which is illegal.
@K_JeanPierre Yeah... I saw.  	Nope. No racial discrimination there.		Of course, I jest. 😒It is an advantage for these news media outlets to widen the coverage of the 2020 campaign trail for everyone else; wider audience means greater ratings, perhaps?
@RealDLHughley Wild s____t, right?   I see stuff like this, I couldn't have kids, 'cause I'd have to go to prison.
@MuslimIQ This is why I don't have children; I sometimes ask young parents, "Would you die for your child?" or "Would you go to prison for your child?" and every single one of them say, "Yes."
@CalmHealthySexy @JRubinBlogger The voting polls in South Carolina need a closer inspection for tampering; it seems as if a Democrat cannot gain a foothold in our local elections.
@reghud Mmm-m... No, he's not.
@TheView @RealDLHughley I remember your 1st episode on CNN where you invited George Washington as a guest and the first he said upon gretting you was, "Uh, what plantation are you from?" Yoo-o-o, I nearly fell outta my seat from laughing so hard!
@CapehartJ There it is.	It is only when problems affect anyone directly does anyone gives a hoot.	I know this from experience. That's what changed my perspective to be more empathetic, and sympathetic about others.
@Lin_Manuel When I think of Carole King, I also think of the mysterious Laura Nyro (she's someone to research as one of the more intriguing 1970s songwriters).
@JoyAnnReid It was a good zinger; he must've had a salad before coming on.
@AOC Good point.
@amjoyshow @JRubinBlogger I agree with the buzz around House Democrats that this man should be removed from any &amp; all committee positions and activity.
@JRubinBlogger You'll have to excuse him, he's from South Carolina. We can't take him anywhere. 😏
@AOC That editor is not familiar with your level of knowledge and experience in such matters b/c he's concerned w/managing written content for specific readers. You represent an entire district in y/community. IOW, his ass is showing.
@AshaRangappa_ I don't believe trump would ever take action against Russia b/c he's in too deep with them; inquiring American minds really want to know exactly what do the Russians have on this man to manipulate into this debacle. I believe he didn't think he'd get caught.
@mayawiley Agreed.
@reghud Agreed.
@MSNBC The reason he's growing the beard is b/c he's trying to conceal his likeness from that black &amp; white nazi film footage that was uncovered a few years ago; or he's losing sleep over the hour by hour, minute by minute hell trump is putting the gop thru.
@Mikel_Jollett What trump and his ilk don't seem to understand is that WE KNOW YOU DEFRAUDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY COMMITING CONSPIRACY W/ THE RUSSIANS TO GET ELECTED AS U.S. PRESIDENT, we just wanna how you did it. That's what this FBI investigation is all about.
@kurtbardella @AOC @realDonaldTrump I foresee that Representative Ocasio-Cortez has a very bright future in American politics.
@finneyk Interesting... Sounds suspicious.
@mayawiley @amjoyshow Already there!
@NatashaBertrand @amjoyshow @MSNBC Will tune in, ma'am.
@DaVoiceman @reghud @ElieNYC Isn't he great?  I'm so impressed by his commentary on MSNBC.👍🏿
@joshgad @reghud That cute lil terrier saved the day in Oz.
@angela_rye @reghud Congratulations, Ms Rye!
@TalbertSwan @reghud BAM!
@JillWineBanks @JoyAnnReid Nice.
@DrJasonJohnson @LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews Now you KNOW there's something odd when fox news starts checking republican politicians *live* on-the-air.
@kumailn @reghud HA HA HAH!!!👍🏿
@goldietaylor Nope. No racial discrimination there.
@MichaelSteele @CapehartJ Lemme tell you... 'Soul Train' in the 1970s really shows how far we've come; as a kid, had to wait an entire week for this show to air on weekends. Today, a show like this can air every day, if not, every hour.
@DrJasonJohnson Good point!
@ATACXGYM You are, sir!👍🏿
@hmcghee @MSNBC Will tune in, Ms McGhee!
@wcnc @finneyk High school students may pass a personal finance class to graduate in SC but where are the laws that regulate banks that discriminate against applicants on loans or and various money lending institutions that prey on unsuspecting persons desperate for funds?
@bfmitchell @CBSNews Nope. No racial discrimination there.
@JillWineBanks 5 BANK-RUPT-CIES!	4 tax returns	3 girlfriends	2 suspect sons	...and some handcuffs waiting for me.🙂
@JillWineBanks Wasserman drew one that went: On the 12th day of christmas, Bob Mueller gave to me...12 Russian singing	11 aides a-pleading	10 staff resigning	9 ladies suing	8 lawyers billing	7 days rage-tweeting	6 judges judging
@johntomlinson @soledadobrien Possibly.🤔
@mayawiley To this day, we still don't know the nature of discussion in those meetings.
@BenariLee @reghud Hell, trump couldn't even be voted borough president in New York!😁
@Yamiche @jamdonaldson It's called 'thread bombing'; all opposed to her joined together and piled on with objections w/out any thought just to silence her. She should've never capitulated. She should understand that objections t/her voice and what she reps comes with the territory.
@levarburton Ahhhh-h-h-h... That beer!😋🍻
@BenariLee @reghud 93% of New Yorkers voted AGAINST trump in the US presidential elections b/c NYrs knew who &amp; what he was all about; ...and he's from NY. That means if he ran for N.Y. mayor, rep. or gov he wouldn't stand a chance. It's idiot voters outside NY is the problem.
@jemelehill I love watchin' females gettin' down in some b-ball!
@levarburton It's the beer that brings zest to this dish.
@AshaRangappa_ Now, she's hawt!
@AshaRangappa_ @soledadobrien His southern drawl is annoying, right? Nasally and high pitch, milquetoast-y!😖
@soledadobrien Clearly, Dr Shafi's devotion to the grand ol' party is because of his accrued tax income bracket b/c I just don't see what else he has in common with them.😖
@MiekeEoyang The charge of conspiracy against the United States is extremely broad and far reaching; why not include every enabler including an entire media company? After all, companies are people, too.*		*according to a US Supreme Court ruling (which I don't agree).
@CBella0418 @mjwatts1983 You misspelled MAGGOT.🙂
@AshaRangappa_ Stop honey-pottin'!*		*from the movie, 'The Interview'
@mjwatts1983 Did it ever occur to anyone else that b/c of the acting-prez's  part. gov shutdown there is less security at US airports; statistically speakin, enabling drugs and other unsavory items to be easily smuggled thru to whome'er. Was this trump's plan all along?
@reghud Agreed.
@AshaRangappa_ HA HAH AHAHA HAHAH!!!😁
@AshaRangappa_ He's from South Carolina...  says it all.
@LaurenDeWynter @xhamsterpremium Yes, you are. I've been wanting to interview you for months.
@LaurenDeWynter @xhamsterpremium You are the most difficult person to reach, Ms. De Wynter.
@maggieNYT I hear in news feeds that Lin-Manuel Miranda was well received in Puerto Rico.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI Agreed.
@donnabrazile It's a start. Now, I wished she and her colleagues would translate that sentiment into votes to resume governing.
@donnabrazile @thehill This year of presidential campaigning is gonna be fun, ma'am!
@AriMelber RIGHT!!!  That's why everyone is exclaiming his actions on a building a wall on the Mexican southern border are manufactured.
@JillWineBanks Those brooches are so creative; everytime you make a television appearance, I always look to see what kind of pin you're wearing.
@joshtpm What's really disappointing is that Hillary would've made a great United States President unlike this clown.
@CapehartJ @JulianCastro Was surprised to discover that Representative Castro has a twin brother; I wonder if his brother can duel campaign with him?🤔
@robreiner @MalcolmNance That's why everyone is so engaged in this debacle; spectators are anxious to know how this story ends.
@MalcolmNance Fascinating.  As I learn more about Benjamin Franklin, he was one of the most wisest and most talented of the original 13 Representatives in the 1st United States Congress.
@ATACXGYM Supreme...
@tedlieu @MSNBC @AlexWitt Will tune in, Representative.
@AshaRangappa_ According to the article, I'll take "brilliantly stupid" for $200, Ms. Rangappa.
@MariaChappelleN What I believe was revealing was that Brad Pitt's character in the movie, 'Seven' was supposed to a law abiding law enforcer (if memory serves), not allowing case studies to be personal until he became one of the victims and he loses control at the end.
@tedlieu @SteveKingIA I am impressed by your confidence, Representative Lieu.  It's inspiring.👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@AshaRangappa_ As I've learned this morning on MSNBC's A.M. Joy hosted by Joy Reid mentioned by one of her guest Attorneys, that since 9/11 info on counterintelligence investigations &amp; criminal investigations is commonly shared or nearly one &amp; the same.
@amjoyshow @JoeConason This is, perhaps, one of your best shows yet, ma'am.
@finneyk There are beautiful, kind, mindful, peace-loving, intelligent, caring, good Americans all over, Ms. Finney. We're just surrounded by the likes of garbage like trump and people who mindlessly follow behind his stank behind.
@MsTaraDowdell You are always great on MSNBC's A.M. Joy hosted by Joy Reid, Ms. Dowdell. Thank you for relentlessly plugging away at this charlatan sitting in the Oval Office. We must keep his transgressions in the hearts &amp; minds of the American people.
@JoyceWhiteVance Consistent. Suspicious. Malicious. Mean-Spirited... These actions will not be easily forgotten by voters.
@RealDLHughley HA HA HAH HAHAH!  Every now and then, you drop a good one, D.L.!😄
@MHarrisPerry @lavGncf @WakeForest With all due respect, wine is sipped, ma'am.🍷😋
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC Joy Reid fans called 'Reiders'; I like that tag.🙂
@RealDLHughley He won't be there very long.
@KellyO @SpeakerPelosi Experience counts; she would know.
@donnabrazile @JenSiebelNewsom Interesting...
@levarburton Happy Friday to you, sir.
@cspanwj @RepRaskin Great showing on Washington Journal this morning.
@JillWineBanks We now know understand what the opposition party is capable of.  When the Democrats eventually take control of Congress &amp; The Executive Office, the opposition party will have no choice but to accept what the Democrats are REALLY capable of.
@kosmokittie @K_JeanPierre Yep.
@mayawiley Typos are common and are forgivable.
@backt0nature @reghud My grandmother (bless her soul) used to freak the f_____k out whenever she saw a garden snake in her yard. I mean, she would lose it!
@KamalaHarris @colbertlateshow The Truths We Hold
@KamalaHarris @colbertlateshow Good song choice on the Senator Harris hitting the floor, Marvin Gaye - "Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler)"  👍🏿
@KamalaHarris @colbertlateshow Will tune in, Senator!👍🏿
@donnabrazile Because polling data is useful information to a foreign entity, namely Russia, who plans to coordinate interference in an American election for their own interests.
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid Congratulations, Ms. Reid!!!  I knew you had the right stuff on MSNBC.  The future is bright with you on-the-air. ☀️🌞
@giselemojica Hey, Gee...👋🏿
@JoyAnnReid @maddow Yeah, heard that interview on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show hosted by Rachel Maddow, too!
@tinabland1025 @abbydphillip ...and that's when you realize that drumphf's presence has outlived his usefulness and overstayed his welcome.	He's like half-eaten, 3 day old fish... 	---time to go.
@finneyk Agreed.
@levarburton Good morning to you, sir. ☺️
@K_JeanPierre The acting-prez is just attempting to curry favor with the leader of China who actually has respect. Unlike him; in other words, drumphf is ass-kissing.
@Bakari_Sellers Good morning to you, sir!☺️
@mayawiley Good idea!
@donnabrazile @thehill Yeah... I saw. There was also a vote for consideration that the minority party to not hold last minute votes at the end their terms.  I am uncertain what the results were.
@SenGillibrand We are with you.
@alroker @JeremyKappell @news10nbc No, Mr. Roker, I'm sure he's a 'great guy' and all but the termination stands.  That's the second time I've heard a white guy say those exact slurs on live television in the same exact way.
@levarburton Culinary skills is all about presentation, Mr. Burton.
@IlhanMN That is why it is imperative in the future to consider a measure that exacts penalties to elected officials who refuse to govern because of their inability to persuade through discussion.
@IlhanMN Agreed!
@RealDLHughley Just heard your lil note f/ GED section today; you really ought to consider doing stand-up in politics by actually running for Congress. You'd make a great Representative or a Senator someday.
@AriMelber Congratulations on your show's success.🌞
@kerrywashington Same here, only if it is The Salsoul Orchestra's classic Christmas album.
@Sandboy1 @JillWineBanks As I've written before, oftentimes I confuse the two chambers of Congress: the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Demonstrates how segmented the separation of powers really is in American Government.
@K_JeanPierre @NBCNews @MSNBC @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Congratulations, Ms. J-P!  Next to Ms. Joy A. Reid, you are one of the most informative Political Analysts on MSNBC!   Your future is bright!🌞
@Bakari_Sellers CONGRATULATIONS, Mr. Sellers!
@mayawiley @AriMelber It was fun watching corsi try to cover his lies on MSNBC's The Beat hosted by Ari Melber yesterday.
@NPR @nprscottsimon Perhaps those women that has taken him to task for his sexual assault claims didn't tone his material enough.
@Bakari_Sellers Yep. All about the paycheck.
@JoyAnnReid @maddow Loved the photograph of teenager Nancy Pelosi meeting President John F Kennedy; wished Ms. Pelosi revealed a few more personal stories about that event no one knows about on your show.
@K_JeanPierre @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow @MSNBC Bust out laughing about your comment that lice polls greater than paul ryan on MSNBC's https://t.co/T83iZLaGP9 hosted by Joy Reid.😁
@JillWineBanks Looks like somebody ain't gonna be confirmed by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2019.
@mayawiley Congratulations on being the first, ma'am!👍🏿
@mayawiley Very unfortunate. In Jan. 2019, this newly assembled 116th American Congress will roll like the A-train in New York where the first &amp; last stop in Rockaway Park, Queens is 116th Street 'cause we're going to be railroading corrupt motherf____s until 2020!🇺🇸
@PINAYJD My condolences, as well, Ms. Dough.
@jfreewright Taken me forever to find you on Twitter.  I just wanted to say thanks for what you are doing for veterans coping with adjusting to civilian life.🙂
@JoyceWhiteVance Breaking in 2 young bull terriers right now by allowing them a little more freedom from their cage; results: chewed up footwear, and dog doo doo on the carpet.🐶🐶Unleashing outside seems to encourage wandering off into unexplored territory...*sheesh*😩
@RuralLiberal @cspan @cspanwj @Harvard Watching her presentation on CSPAN/ Washington Journal as I type this... She's powerful.
@DrJasonJohnson dc comics suck. That's why the movie, as you've said, "...kinda sucked."
@donnabrazile So will be his sentencing after trial...⏳
@cathykaku1 @ChrisCoons Folks... Please don't mistake beauty with age; his daughter ain't all that!  She's just young (and dumb). Put some mileage on that Edsel and you'll look at her very differently.	Plus: an elderly women once told me that she has the neck of a giraffe.
@abbydphillip I forsee that you're gonna be a star in the CNN newsroom (journalism, in general) someday, Ms Phillips.
@kerrywashington So the weinstein sex assault case goes to trial, eh? Should be a VERY interesting, if not, entertaining 2019.	🎥  Lights! Camera! Action!
@PINAYJD You reap what you sow when f_____ing with Jane Dough!
@DWStweets I agree. There is a number of simple solutions to the gun problem in America. We just need a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President, not a unqualified television game show host pretending to be an American President or a turkey-neck senator from Ky.
@Ocasio2018 Thanks for keeping us informed, Representative Ocasio-Cortez. People such as that board member love to show their ass, if able.
@jemelehill Hanging onto that MAGGOT base for his political life.🤣
@USDA @USDANutrition The acting-prez is an idiot, &amp; a racist, mysogynist. Qualification for SNAP has absolutely ZERO to do w/whether the recipient is 'able-bodied' or whatever ramblings coming out his scatterbrain; The issue has to do w/ INCOME and the HIGH COST OF GROCERIES.
@NPR The acting-prez is an idiot, &amp; a racist, mysogynist. Qualification for SNAP has absolutely ZERO to do w/whether the recipient is 'able-bodied' or whatever ramblings coming out his scatterbrain; The issue has to do w/ INCOME and the HIGH COST OF GROCERIES.
@TheBeatWithAri TOLD YA!🇺🇸
@SenKamalaHarris @CoryBooker @SenatorTimScott The good news is that there is no statute of limitation regarding  murder.
@NancyPelosi The republican short term solutions are not helpful, at all.
@RepRoKhanna Love the 'Internet Bill of Rights' proposal, sir!👍🏿
@IlhanMN Great appearance on CNN this morning Representative-elect Omar!☺️
@SymoneDSanders That's right, girl!  Treat yourself.
@jonallendc @kasie This is exactly I enjoy modern day news media. The facial reactions from the absurb things these reporters hear &amp; read from screwball politicians, republicans in particular, is similar to accidently sampling rancid food.🍴
@TheBeatWithAri I'll admit, when 'The Beat' first aired on MSNBC, was skeptical considering the show that was replaced in that 6pm - 7pm slot but once you began quoting verses from rap artists, w/ relevant guests &amp; opened up 'FALLBACK FRIDAYS', soon began to lighten up.🌞
@SRuhle There's a reason Senator Warren is proposing a very ambitious 'Anti-Corruption Bill' to peer into such matters.
@Lawrence @SpeakerRyan Correction:  ryan ran for representative; oftentimes, I confuse the two political positions.
@realejandro85 @TerminalLance Thank you...   You have expressed my exact feelings.👍🏿
@davidaxelrod You're kidding, right?
@Lawrence @SpeakerRyan Both.  Remember, this guy used to run a Oscar Mayer weiner vehicle that was actually shaped like a weiner.  He probably ran for senator because he was often teased and craved respect.
@MalcolmNance Roger that, Senior Chief!👍🏿
@KamalaHarris Thanks for everything, Senator Harris!
@markmobility @RealDLHughley Just... one more... month until the U.S. House of Representatives assembles.🗓️🇺🇸Just... one...more...month...
@mateagold @PostRoz @hsu_spencer She almost resembles the Russian character from BBC America's 'Killing Eve'.
@K_JeanPierre Of course, a sitting president can be indicted. As a matter of national security, what if the president decided on a whim to break a law that causes massive loss of life thinking that he could get away with it?
@soledadobrien In the video game world, it's called 'enabling cheat codes'.👎🏿	I hate cheaters.  	I really do.
@mayawiley Just... one... more... month until the U.S. House of Representatives assembles...  Just.. one... more... month.🗓️🇺🇸
@melelani22 @UpPastryPlate @UPonMSNBC @lizzwinstead @davidgura @KatiePhang @selectedwisdom @leighgallagher @harrylitman @glennkirschner2 @ElieNYC @pbump @fran_chambers @matthewamiller @MSNBC An uppers pastry show?  Could possibly shave off 3.5 minutes to close the show.
@UpPastryPlate @LisaMariePC @UPonMSNBC Let's see... early Sunday morning... lying in a bed with a friend.. 	could be raining outdoors...		Yep... very Freudian.
@LisaMariePC @UPonMSNBC Really, really, really, really, nice.🥰
@UPonMSNBC @davidgura @lizzwinstead Really, really nice.  Didja know that Pastry Chef is a complely different profession in the Culinary Arts?
@crampell Texas, right?   Of course!
@crampell *sigh*
@UPonMSNBC @lizzwinstead @davidgura @KatiePhang @selectedwisdom @leighgallagher @harrylitman @glennkirschner2 @ElieNYC @pbump @fran_chambers @matthewamiller @UpPastryPlate @MSNBC Those homemade cup cakes on display on MSNBC are very impressive!🥰
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid Happy birthday, Ms. Reid!  You help make MSNBC enjoyable!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@PINAYJD @1077JAMZ Will do!	Now I understand why they call your station 'Foxy'!😊
@K_JeanPierre Agree. 	1 trillion percent.	Infinity.
@soledadobrien Agreed.  I remember when the position was open, the other wiser military officers said (paraphrasing), "I don't want any part of that sh!t sandwich!"
@PINAYJD Just read about your promotion to Music Director at FOXY 99.  Congratulations!!!  I would listen to your show at FOXY 99 back-in-th' day while toiling away at the drawing board, ma'am. Haven't connected to FOXY ever since Russ Parr left.
@michelleisawolf Would you ever consider hosting the 91st annual Oscar Awards ceremony?  I'd tune in.👀
@staceyabrams I overheard someone online predict that you'd make a very good Vice President if you stick around 'til 2020.
@MalcolmNance @SenBlumenthal 5 is a very big number.
@TaraSetmayer Very soon his M.O. will be "...he was running from prosecution, not for the presidency".
@mayawiley @MalcolmNance Loved you guys on A.M. Joy this morning! Great photo!  Great smiles! ☺️
@JRubinBlogger @politico Flakey &amp; the gop have to appear as if they have something to offer on their way out when in actuality, they have nothing to offer at this time.
@PINAYJD Wow! That's horrible!☹️I just heard him in a interview on NPR a few years ago. So unfortunate.
@michelleisawolf @GQMagazine Gulp!😍
@DrStaceyPatton Agree. Imagine what would happen if excessive flooding occurs and one has to pick up and go but are confronted by armed militants guarding territory in the U.S.A.?  Just one of the horrible consequences of climate change.
@TheRevAl @Trevornoah @GlblCtzn Should be fun to see next Sunday.
@TananariveDue Didn't see 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' so it's gonna be 'Black Panther'.
@sunny Seems suspicious...
@NancyPelosi You're a Representative?!  All this time, I mistakenly thought you were a Senator!😁
@maddow Why do these crooks always appear bloated, and gassy looking?
@JoyceWhiteVance Interesting. Didn't know that.
@michelleisawolf Good one!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿*applause*
@JoyceWhiteVance Extremely. I find myself sometime striking the wrong keys when copying, cutting &amp; paste articles from various sources or nodding off reading them. It's been a looonng 2 - 3 years. 😴
@JRubinBlogger ...and not waste any time!
@NatashaBertrand @JacksonLeeTX18 @matthewamiller This guy Whittaker puts all of his intentions out there where everyone can easily assess it.
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber ~~~The Beat, The Beat, so unique, c'mon everybody let's dance to the beat!~~~
@jaketapper Agree.
@RWPUSA @TheBeatWithAri I'll tune in!
@donnabrazile @NancyPelosi @RepMarciaFudge Okay, Okay... I yield... reluctantly!🙁
@tomwatson @joanwalsh Senator Pelosi is the woman to carry the gavel, however all I am thinking about is how she will fare at 2 important events: The State of the Union Address &amp; the 2020 US Presidential election. We need that new face to sit on that right seat during the event.
@TaraSetmayer Welcome to the conservative republican party, Ms. Setmayer.  You've been bamboozled!
@sunny Yup.🙄
@mayawiley As they[House Democrates] should.
@CNN @AprilDRyan I will not be tuning in to the 2019 event at all.   What a disappointment.
@davis_x_machina @CapehartJ @DonnaFEdwards @PostOpinions Was there a problem?🦉
@michelleisawolf @whca I wonder if anyone is aware why the white house, by which the structure isn't a house, is called 'the white house'?
@michelleisawolf @whca I couldn't agree more, Ms. Wolf. You were magnificent at last year's whca dinner!😂 I predict everyone will tune out at this year's event.
@bearmomruns @_MiaNoLove NoooOoooOOOoo-o0o way.
@sjgemini23 @_MiaNoLove NNNOOO WAY!
@adhJoe @_MiaNoLove Nooo-o-o-o way.
@Tawny2222 @_MiaNoLove NOOO WAY!
@kimscott425 @_MiaNoLove @CDNResistance Noo-o-o way!
@VaJJDentata @Patrickesque HA HAH HAHHAH!!!
@debroah10 @_MiaNoLove @DerekFriday No way.
@michaelkruse @maggieNYT @saikatc Rep-Elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is feared by the gop b/c she looks like the lil sister of the Puerto Rican dude who punched one o' them in the face when she didn't submit to their advances when they were lil kids.
@crampell ...and he is allowed to get away with causing a disturbance in a crowed theatre???🤨
@RealDLHughley The Depart of Justice should prepare for potential fraud and murder cover-up cases especially with the defrauder-in-chief currently in the Executive Mansion in D.C.
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid @staceyabrams That's what I like about Ms. Stacey Abrams... She's a fighter!  Keep fighting and we will follow.
@Yamiche @joanwalsh @chucktodd Keep the H-E-A-T  U-P!!!
@K_JeanPierre @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow @MSNBC Will tune in!
@CapehartJ @DonnaFEdwards @PostOpinions I wouldn't describe voting her out of speakership as "dumping her". As intelligent,  sweet and resourceful Senator Pelosi has been up until after the 2018 midterm elections, we need a new face to present to the world at the 'State of the Union' address event.
@TheRevAl @DrJoySpaulding Look at lil' Rev Al!
@TaraSetmayer Ms.Setmayer, in a televised interview (I think it was on CNN), you mentioned that you will run to become an elected official on the Republican platform, however, not at this time. Do you still feel confident about that after the 2018 midterm elect results?
@TaraSetmayer Agreed.
@mayawiley To renew America, I will stay in contact with every relevant elected official... weekly, if not daily.
@MeetThePress @MSNBC @LindseyGrahamSC If the South Carolina Senator's quote is right-wing and exact, then it is logical to reject any kind of Republican solution on criminal justice reform.
@sunny Meee Deee Oooo KER! That's his style.😑
@MaxBoot @soledadobrien The whole 'conservative agenda' is a lost cause. That outdated ideology simply cannot hold up in 21st Century America any longer. The conservatives today are looking like the whig party in the 19th Century.
@MSNBC @karaswisher That sounds accurate.😁
@crampell @WSJ Heh. Looking at classic Hollywood movies, it is kind of funny to re-watch them critically to see how many laws are broken by certain characters. I wonder if lawyers watch Hollywood movies the same way?🤔...😃Heh.
@mayawiley AGREED!!!
@TheBeatWithAri @MWilsonSupreme MARY WILSON!!!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 Absolute favorite Supremes album, 'TOUCH' and their last single, 'Come Into My Life'... oh my gawd!!!  The Legend!!!
@TheBeatWithAri When I want a good cry I listen to The Supremes, 'This Is The Story' Welcome to 'The Beat' Mary Wilson!!!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@TheBeatWithAri FALLBACK FRIDAY:  'TOUCH' was spectacular Supremes album and 'Come Into My Life' was (and still is) magnificent!!!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@theintercept @krystalball Not interested in ojeda.
@jaketapper @SpanbergerVA07 @TheLeadCNN Last I counted, the tally was 17.  Looks as if the numbers are growing.
@donnabrazile So Am I.☹️ I am proud.  I feel that the opposition party cheated the American people of democracy with dirty, nefarious voter suppression tactics.  Karma is woman in the future.
@TheBeatWithAri Almost appears as a live feed of MSNBC's 'The Beat'...🙂  impressive.
@JoyceWhiteVance OFF-TOPIC: Nuts! Your appearance on a earlier segment of MSNBC's 'Deadline' this afternoon was drowned out by flood warnings in South Carolina; the sound was completely muted!😡😬
@JoyceWhiteVance @NicolleDWallace Will tune in.
@Ocasio2018 @FoxNews @dcexaminer That's what I like to hear... strong, confident leaders that speak truth, and exert power.  I have a feeling it's gonna be a fun 2 years in Washington, D.C.🙂
@jaffe_johnson @MotherJones @SallySellers54 Answer: sadists
@PINAYJD I'm dark. I'm not afraid of you, Ms. Dough. 👴🏿
@wkamaubell @TuckerCarlson Try not to be frustrated, Mr. Bell. Right now, it only just seems fashionable to express unpopular (and dangerous) opinions but watch how fast Carlson's tone change when the political tug o' war pulls in his opposite direction. Watch.
@tedlieu @CNN @realDonaldTrump 'cause he's hard-headed and doesn't understand.  He must've been f_____ing hell to his parents.  Now, we gotta deal w/him! 😫
@JacksonLeeTX18 @Acosta @whca @realDonaldTrump The acting-president lost both the House of Representatives AND to CNN.👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@maddow No, no, no, Ms. Maddow... the quote goes, "For the well endowed..."😃  It's time the upcoming 116th US Congress triggers a sexual revolution, yes?
@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump @HouseDemocrats Indeed, we do, Representative Lee! 🙂
@JacksonLeeTX18 I wish you the best in all of your political endeavors.	Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule in reading this!
@JacksonLeeTX18 I will continue to forward written correspondence with suggestions, and comments for many possibilities of a political strategy going forward.
@JacksonLeeTX18 I just wanted to let you know that we are watching very closely what is happening in Washington D.C. and especially what is going with this current Administration inside the Executive Mansion.
@JacksonLeeTX18 I hear your message at today's Congressional Democratic Agenda along with Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network regarding issues such as HR40, prison reform, criminal justice reform, law enforcement reform, domestic violence, etc
@JacksonLeeTX18 How are you?  I hope my message reaches you well... Congratulations on your re-election in Texas 18th District and being an important part of the upcoming assembly of the 116th United States House of Representatives!
@K_JeanPierre Thank gawd, Shiva, Buddah and every other deity out there! I'd LOVE to see him get the ____ck  out of D.C.!
@allinwithchris Is it just me? Doesn't Senator Sherrod Brown resemble Peter Falk from 'Columbo'?🤔
@PatCunnane @AprilDRyan @jefferiesshow I'll tune in tonight!
@ELLEmagazine @abbydphillip @BrookeBCNN @jaketapper @wolfblitzer Go 'head, Ms. Phillip!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿  Classy.
@RepMcSally An honorable concession speech, Ms. McSally. Nice Labrador.👍🏿
@AprilDRyan No, thank YOU, Ms. Ryan! I admire your ability to assert yourself when treated rudely by the acting-president in a press conference.
@K_JeanPierre YASSS!!!  Now about Florida... the reason republicans are fighting desperately for Fl is because of its 29 electoral points they're going to need in 2020.  We cannot allow that to happen.
@donnabrazile Some speculate, decades.
@mikememoli @maggieNYT Not a Blue Wave. More like a rising Blue Flood.☺️
@PINAYJD JANE DOUGH from The Big Stick Foxxy!  It's still 'The Big Stick Foxxy' yes?
@TheWayWithAnoa @MariaChappelleN Why not wait until the next Congress assemble before casting doubt? The 116 Congress' success will greatly depend on how well they perform in Washington, D.C.
@RealDLHughley Real Simple Solution: a uniform code of conduct for ALL law enforcement officers and a uniform code of justice for ALL law enforcement officers.  You will see positive behavioral results practically overnight, D.L.
@SenGillibrand @allinwithchris It's a colorful, wonderfully illustrated book!   Bold &amp; Brave.☺️
@sunny I don't mean to laugh or chuckle... well... Actually, I do!😆😆😁
@JoyceWhiteVance I've eaten all of my BOOM CHICKA POPcorn…!😋
@AriMelber @Lawrence Man, those protesters in Broward County are intense, Mr. Melber.
@donnabrazile YUP!!! 😅*whew*
@kyrstensinema CONGRATULATIONS, Senator-Elect Sinema! I believe you will make a great Senator in Washington D.C.
@DrStaceyPatton @DrJasonJohnson @AfroStateOfMind @karenhunter I have never seen an episode of 'Webster'... ---ever.
@michelleisawolf Please return to the White House Correspondence Dinner next year, Ms. Wolf!🤣
@mayawiley This should be interesting...
@DrJasonJohnson @MorganStateU Didn't know you were a comicbook fan, Dr. Johnson. ☺️    Cool...👍🏿  See what effect Stan Lee had on everyone?  He could bring 2 (or more) people together who don't know each other &amp; be friendly. He had that kind of mass appeal.
@K_JeanPierre @TheLeadCNN Will tune in, Ms. J-P!☺️
@JudyWoodruff @BrookeBCNN Yep, Nurses are called, "Angels of mercy."
@levarburton Thank you, Mr. Burton!  ...and thanks to Stan 'The Man' Lee and what he left behind.
@JoyAnnReid D.L. Hughley dropped something on his afternoon radio show about this joker's lack of empathy, "If you don't want the job, talk to the F.B.I."
@DavidCornDC The United States should take a Zantac, Mr. Corn.
@SenGillibrand Great appearance on 'The View', Senator Gillibrand.  Interesting children's book. Liked the illustrations from my side of the monitor. 🙋🏿‍♂️I agree with your position. Please guide our freshmen House Representatives on the correct path. Thx, OK, BYE!
@mayawiley We have the resources. We have the intelligence. We have the tools, abilities and powers in half the Chamber. We. Can. Do. This.
@jemelehill Save your energy for communicating with the House Representatives, Ms. Hill.
@JoyAnnReid We'll get those numbers up.  We have just have to work at it.  Oh... Hi, Ms. Reid!🙋🏿‍♂️
@robreiner Would love to see another movie similar to 'The American President', Mr. Reiner.☺️
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump 4. Women
@K_JeanPierre ANSWER: Everything!
@amjoyshow @MsTaraDowdell Ms. Dowdell, careful how you use the term 'master' when referring to drumphf. That characterization raises all kinds of historical issues.  He ain't no 'master'; maybe a 'master of none'.
@maggieNYT All of his B/S is unwise, Ms. Haberman. I foresee that this acting-president is going to walk himself into a Federal prison.
@JoyceWhiteVance Agree.	The Mid-Term Election results were fruitful gaining control of the House of Representatives. We would have control of the Senate were it not for the corrupt opposition party.
@DrJasonJohnson @K_JeanPierre Doesn't have to be.
@tedlieu @HouseJudDems @HouseJudiciary @realDonaldTrump With the added abilities &amp; powers granted by the People, should be fun to try them out... Just because you can.
@staceyabrams Very inspiring speech, Governor-Elect Abrams! I am so glad that you did not concede defeat. Go get some rest.  You deserve it!👍🏿
@DrJasonJohnson Told you she will win. 👍🏿She has yet another possibility.😇
@JoyAnnReid ...followed by his charming reputation...
@ClaraJeffery Democrats should do everything in their power to offer guidance to our newly elected House members and keep them out of trouble.
@DrJasonJohnson @staceyabrams Huh?🤨
@JoeZWales2 @RonaldKlain Agreed.
@KhaledBeydoun @MalcolmNance Congratulations!
@MalcolmNance Give all of the Democratic candidates a round of applause!  We have a new yet split U.S. Congress which is a gain.
@DrJasonJohnson I hope everyone is more enlightened about what happened in Florida, Georgia and Texas, Dr. Johnson.
@ValerieJarrett @reghud @AndrewGillum It's a victory because now, everyone is more enlightened about American politics. From this day forth, we will take extreme liberties in self-governing that will far surpass anything the 115th U.S. Congress and the opposition party ever accomplished.
@ClintSmithIII @reghud Absolutely! 👍🏿
@RonaldKlain At the very least, we don't have tolerate peewee ryan's BS anymore.	...but, oh, I wanted to see cruz go back to Texas sooo-o-o-o bad.
@RonaldKlain I'll accept that.
@mayawiley Agree.  	We can learned from their loss in more ways than one.
@DrJasonJohnson You had doubts, sir?
@CapehartJ @BetoORourke No, he didn't.
@SteveKornacki You are performing an amazing job with the voting result count... county by county, State by State!  Looks like you're playing a video game and I'm the spectator!👍🏿
@wevoteforwomen @JoyAnnReid Wow.
@DrJasonJohnson She is going to win.
@crampell I wonder why? 🤔
@MHarrisPerry @AyannaPressley Congratulations!
@donnabrazile @stefcutter Much better...☺️  (*grumpy*) taking photos with chris crisco oil...!*ugh*😒
@donnabrazile @ChrisChristie Yuck!😖
@donnabrazile That sounds about right... although, I prefer to swap the wings for brie w/a Triscuit &amp; a sm glass o' Brandy after all of the returns are in.👍🏿
@sunny I'll relay the message, ma'am.  Meanwhile, mysteriously the connection to view the news channels in eastern South Carolina is cut.  I have no eyes on the election coverage!!!  The service is SPECTRUM.
@Eugene_Robinson Well... his type of 'campaign' has outlived its usefulness.  We're gonna prove it today.
@TaraSetmayer Thanks, Ms. Setmayer! 👍🏿
@mj_lee @maggieNYT Thank you, ma'am. 👍🏿
@Eugene_Robinson Longtime reader of your work, Mr. Robinson!👍🏿
@KamalaHarris Yep!👍🏿
@MarshallChessNY @STLChessClub @FabianoCaruana Echoes of Bobby Fischer, perhaps?😏
@K_JeanPierre I did!  Early!🙋🏿‍♂️
@JoyceWhiteVance I cast a ballot a few days a ago during early voting.👍🏿
@Bakari_Sellers @CNN I'll be up for that, sir!
@AriMelber That's because they believe you a poet...	---but you don't know it!
@TheoHayesWBAL THEO!!!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@BetoORourke @K_JeanPierre Good luck, Governor-Elect O'Rourke!👊🏿(fist_bump!)
@hmcghee Congratulations, Ms. McGhee! A very special baby!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿(applause!)
@thehill Your honor, the Jury renders its verdict: GUILTY.
@alexwagner Thanks, ma'am!
@tedlieu hannity… doesn't he resemble Lou Costello of the classic Abbot &amp; Costello comedy team?  ...only without any of the humor.😒
@SymoneDSanders Copy that, Ms. Sanders...👊🏿(fist_bump!)
@common Got it, sir!👊🏿(fist_bump!)
@K_JeanPierre We Can &amp; We Will, Ms. J-P!👊🏿(fist_bump!)
@jemelehill 😀 When Axel Rose will not allow you to play his music at an event, you know you're all effed up!
@TheLastWord @MSNBC All I see is smiles on the faces of your guests this evening, Mr. O'Donnell! I wonder why?😀On Election Night 2016 when the cyber attack occurred during the ballot counting, you didn't flinch or seemed unsettled. You kept that determined spirit 'til 2018.
@jamdonaldson Yeah... I can picture that, Ms. Donaldson. 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿(applause)
@Sara4Congress I agree with your position speaking on CNN moments ago, that American citizens demand accountability from their government.  I wish you the best of luck on Election night tomorrow.👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@JoyAnnReid @maddow @MSNBC I'll tune in, Ms. Reid!👍🏿
@jemelehill @reghud Good one! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿(applause)
@KamalaHarris We will deliver that power to the Democrats to take the House, Senator. You'll see!☺️The Senate is merely a bonus.
@maggieNYT The acting-president ordered those troops because when the Democrats take the House o' Reps AND the Senate, he needs an army to shield him from being physically thrown out of office.
@K_JeanPierre Ghouliani is still sleeping in his coffin.😬  Where he belongs.😇
@K_JeanPierre @Pharrell Agree, Ms. J-P.☺️
@OchioguEmeka @kerrywashington @TraceeEllisRoss It's called polite adulation.😇	Here's some useful information: Always think before you post.
@RealDLHughley Richard Pryor told a joke where he was so traumatized by those switch-whippins that when he got older, pulled on the side o' the road and broke off a branch, angrily snapped it into a thousand pieces!
@JRubinBlogger Most people the Press Secretary speaks directly to do not understand what the U.S. Constitution really is. They should pick up a copy. I hear it's a best seller!
@MalcolmNance AGREE 1 TRILLION PERCENT, Mr. Nance!👍🏿
@reghud @intelligencer Ages 18 - 29? Yep. I used to think just like that. Then, when you hit 30 and fall into financial &amp; personal hardships, start to realize that maybe you should have paid more attention to American politics.
@mj_lee @maggieNYT I agree w/Barbera Streisand.👍🏿
@RealDLHughley Couldn't afford that plate, D.L... 	Never ate one of those (I don't eat pork😖) but I bet Bill Cosby is chewing on some o' that this morning! 😛
@K_JeanPierre We'll do what we can, ma'am!
@tedlieu @CNNnewsroom @PoppyHarlowCNN @jimsciutto I foresee that you will become a senator, Representative Lieu. You seem to have all the right qualities of a honorable senator of a future Democratic Congress. 🧠
@KatrinaWDRB If you want to know the reasoning behind the hate crime law, research its legislative history to find your answer. You and I know it's murder and terrorism but the author of the bill didn't want to acknowledge it is murder &amp; terrorism.
@kerrywashington @TraceeEllisRoss I wish my mom was Diana Ross. I've heard Ms. Ross's voice in songs ever since I was a child and imagined her as a distant cousin I never knew.😀
@UlmerTanya @maggieNYT I cannot stand 0.03 seconds of drumphf's voice.
@ATACXGYM Welcome, Ras Fletcher!  Thank you for connecting with me. 😀 WAKANDA FOREVER!!!👊🏿
@allinwithchris Keep the H-E-A-T U-P!!!
@joanwalsh @digby56 Much better, ma'am.
@allinwithchris @SteveSchmidtSES Great and inspiring words, Mr. Schmidt!
@JoyceWhiteVance That's why it's called 'The Abyss'; which is why one should back away from it.
@elizabethforma See you in the 116th United States Congress in January 2019, Senator Warren!😀
@SteveSchmidtSES Thank you for your commentary on MSNBC's ALL IN hosted by Chris Hayes. Very strong and confident words said on his show regarding drumphf's misconduct.
@seungminkim @PressSec Agree.  The number don't lie.
@reghud I don't. I didn't like him when he was 'new'. I purchased his 1st album for only 2 reasons: 1. Jesus song 2. because he survived a near-fatal car accident. When the song first released &amp; regretted ever since. His was LAST Hip Hop CD I ever bought, &amp; this 2018
@joanwalsh @OutFrontCNN I'll only watch if you refer to the terror suspect as 'The maga bomber'.
@DiamondGirlL13 @realDonaldTrump Yep!
@K_JeanPierre My plus?  HEF.  Lotsa registered voters there ready to do this!🙌🏿
@MeetThePress @K_JeanPierre I agree with former President Carter, brian kemp cannot run an honest campaign in Georgia's gubernatorial race because he is manipulating the ballot box.
RT @OlSchoolMedia: ALERT!!!  SOMEONE JUST ACCESSSED MY TWITTER WHILE I WAS AWAY.
@MalcolmNance VOTE NOW!
ALERT!!!  SOMEONE JUST ACCESSSED MY TWITTER WHILE I WAS AWAY.
@jonallendc @maggieNYT He should pick up the latest edition of the U.S. Constitution... I hear it's a best seller!😒
@JoyceWhiteVance I appreciate your vast legal knowledge in your television appearances on MSNBC, Ms. White-Vance.🙂
@BetoORourke For Beto or for worse (cruz).🙂
@AndrewGillum @BarackObama Alright!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@TalbertSwan @reghud @SpectrumEntUS We'll see her registered at xHamster in a few weeks, that is, if she able a to still have a roof over her head.👆🏿
@justinjm1 @JoyAnnReid Did it ever occur to anyone else that the U.S. are (and have been) engaged in urban warfare on its own turf for a number of years?
@alexjgoldstein @jaketapper Gosh...I kept seeing this pair o' photographs on a web page cluttered with images and didn't know they were victims of a shooting. Didn't know their names until now.
@Bakari_Sellers It's plausible, Mr. Sellers. The suspect directly participated in those rallies. Should be interesting what this individual reveals to the investigators in the near future. A suggestion would be to add this investigation to Mueller Probe.
@JenniferADevon @MalcolmNance Actually, issuing visiting vehicles base windshield stickers but still... at the gate!🙂
@MalcolmNance Agree.
@TheoHayesWBAL Wait a second... THEO!!!  Right... You'd be perfect to fill that position!  Call your agent, pronto!😊
@abbydphillip Heh.😊
@Lawrence Waaa-a-a-yyy, too obvious...
@tonyhusar @NBCNews @tamronhall YES! Bring back Tamron Hall!!!
@JoyceWhiteVance Interesting...I don't believe the mailed packages was a hoax, either. That was real. However, my concern was how findings of all evidence suggests this administration is implicated and how drumphf attempts to distance himself from the evidence with cheers.
@abbydphillip Far too obvious. 🤨
@abbydphillip Staged event...  far too obvious, ma'am.
@JoyAnnReid Thank you, Ms. Reid!!! I'm relieved SOMEONE caught that. It was, and still is, a staged event.  Now, our political opponents are officially desperados.
@CNNnewsroom Staged.
@JRubinBlogger I only take issue with misconduct of any kind from *any* public uniformed or plain clothes security volunteer. I believe that is everyone's main concern.
@RealDLHughley YEP!🙂
@JRubinBlogger Law enforcement or any other uniformed security volunteer is at their best when doing their sworn duty. I only take issue is with misconduct. I believe that is everyone's main concern.
@twistedkilt @bassoonhack @nadinevdVelde @MalcolmNance @morgfair I like that.  guiliani/Ghouliani😄
@JRubinBlogger ...or the Washington Post. 🙂
@JRubinBlogger Some of your readers (myself included) are at a disadvantage when you post a link from New York Times; a subscription is required to read it.  Useful reading material but cannot access (yet). Appreciate the gesture, ma'am. 🙂
@jemelehill Anyone else noticed that the location the suspect was nabbed is called Plantation, Florida? Obviously, this experience feels like a staged event.
@abbydphillip With all due respect, future CNN starlet, we're not concerned if he's gaining or losing followers.
@K_JeanPierre @CNN @jaketapper So do I. His last press conference, when he walked off that podium, I said out loud to my mother sitting next to me, "There goes the greatest American president I've seen."
@ReaI_VinDiesel Yep... that's what I appreciate about the movie projects you appear in; You are literally competing with yourself. You have your own thing going on. Would like to see another "The Last Witch Hunter' story.🧙‍♀️👮‍♂️
@syblcat @Elvisnmore @JillWineBanks @MichaelAvenatti @megynkelly Agreed.
@JillWineBanks @MichaelAvenatti @megynkelly I was surprised. I really was. I believed he would champion for women's rights. Instead, he appears to be part of drumphf's 'con'. 😞
@Blavity @RealDLHughley @RepMaxineWaters Neither am I, ma'am.👍🏿
@RetroNewsNow @jaketapper Check out Morgan Freeman in the background and... is that Bill Cosby, too?
@spettypi @jaketapper @JenniferJJacobs Everyone knew what the motives of the shooter were and who was responsible for providing the weapon. The difference today is that we don't know who did what yet we have obvious clues that reveal how this event was triggered [read: republicans]. 🔎
@RealDLHughley I didn't see the video but I know what she suffers from: It's called 'conditioning'.  She hasn't experienced enough of the world to know what she speaks of.
@GrahamVyse @MichaelAvenatti @mollyesque @aabramson @billscher I hope... I really, really hope that the Democratic presidential nominee for 2020 is a female. That's the only reason I voted for Hillary in 2016. I want to know what that experience is like. At one time, I believed Mr. Avenatti would support the idea.
@K_JeanPierre @CNN @jaketapper Would you please make certain to mention the comparisons of a true leader of the free world [Pres. Obama] and one that wants to put the world in peril [drumphf]? The difference in mediocrity [drumphf] and high standards [Obama]?
@bassoonhack @nadinevdVelde @MalcolmNance @morgfair HA HA HA HA HA!!!!😃😃😃😃
@chrislhayes This isn't Chris Hayes of MSNBC.
@nadinevdVelde @MalcolmNance @morgfair *UGH* He resembles Nosferatu the Vampyre.😒
@chrislhayes How do you know if he'll make it to 2020? He has to make it past 2018!
@JoyceWhiteVance It would be in everyone's interest to dismiss all imaginary claims of a 'swamp' made by this questionably elected official in the Executive's Mansion. Re: Cabinet Secy, I agree that if, indeed, this person in entangled in legalities should resign immediately.
@trendchasernews So that's why airline stewards smile ALL TH' TIME! I mean, ALL THE TIME! Check out that scene in 'The Last Witch Hunter' where Kaulder kicks it to the sexy airline steward in the opening. 😃
@crampell Is Caitlyn Jenner suggesting that Donald trump lied to the American people to get elected so that he could, in turn, betray the LGBTQ community? 🤨  No way! This cannot be!😮
@RealDLHughley Go tell that to bill cosby, D.L. !👉🏿Right now, he's got more money than time... or, is it the other way around?
@K_JeanPierre @NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH I'll tune in, Ms. JP!👍🏿
@mayawiley @Scaramucci I reject scaramucci. He exudes a kind of creepiness that rivals those domestic terrorists in Charlottesville.  I agree, it's not normal for domestic terrorists to parade in our streets frightening and attacking innocent Americans.  We'll settle this.
@ChrisCuomo Heh.🙂
@K_JeanPierre *sigh* I just don't know what to believe in anymore, Ms. JP.😞
@PINAYJD @Foxy991 @SkyeTunes Go 'head, Jane D! 😃
@kerrywashington @nytimes Thank you for everything.  I appreciate your talent, and intelligence. 🙂
@ChesscomNews @STLChessClub Thanks... haven't seen a match in a couple o' years. Been busy.
@donnabrazile What a mediocre person does. Of all the ochres, he's the mediest!🙂
@crampell @JoyAnnReid The Grinch...😒
@crampell You've got to be kiddin'...😬  Get him outta da Executive Mansion, quickly ...! Seriously.😩
@JoyAnnReid That entire scenario at the Mexican border was artificially manufactured by a fox news report giving the false impression there's a crisis. Remember: fox is connected to drumphf who is connected to Defense Secretary mattis…  I'm just sayin'...
@CBSNews @maggieNYT The lastest XBOX is absolutely worthless; now if the police had offered a brand new PlayStation 4, that would be a better offer, no? 😏
@donnabrazile Oh, hell no!  First, Abrams votes were being withheld. Now, votes are being switched around to favor kemp! Ms. Brazile, is there any way to submit an official complaint overnight to the proper officials?????????????
@TVAshleigh Don't forget her reputation for permitting torture and cover-ups.
@TweetingSpeak @THR @megynkelly @FoxNews HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!!!!  Hilarious!
@MSNBC I believe he should resign this faux presidency.... give up this charade.
@MsTaraDowdell It's a full moon this evening. That's why there are so many psychos running amok today.
@NBCNews @MsTaraDowdell What one would expect from a psycho next to racist, and sociopath.
@Bakari_Sellers Always... Always... Always... tell the truth.👍🏿
@CaccioppoliMike @joanwalsh @donlemon @CNNTonight touche! 😃
@BenJealous Push, we shall.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @NYGovCuomo Because he's not a leader.  He's a professional con man.
@giselemojica I'm here! I'm here!!! 👋🏿Don't forget to vote!
@ArvellPoe @RealDLHughley Ice Cube said it best, "Get in, where you fit in!"
@mayawiley Y'know...this is the longest I've ever stayed online Twitter. Usually, I post &amp; go.  This time is different. We've got, perhaps, The. Most. Important. Election. of our Lifetime... next to President Obama's 10 years ago.
@mayawiley Racists give off all sorts of signals to me: body language, vocabulary, facial expressions, aura, attitude...I can go on and on. They're creepy people, I kid you not.
@RealDLHughley Who didn't see that coming? 😃
@AndrewGillum Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah!👍🏿
@crampell **APPLAUSE**👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@JenniferADevon @MalcolmNance That's unfortunate. April is such a welcome month for me.  I was in San Diego, California when that building was hit assigned as gatekeeper at the San Diego Naval Base.  Man, the special precautions we had taken to improvise how to re-act was unforgettable.
@keithboykin @JoyAnnReid Yep.
@JenniferADevon @MalcolmNance Yep.
@MalcolmNance Agreed.
@chrislhayes Yep. unmistakable.
@Lawrence Would you believe that the entire country is going through all this B/S just because drumphf doesn't want to go to prison??? C'mon, mr. acting-president, Federal prison is not so bad compared to State prison.
@RealDLHughley Go 'head, D.L.!😀
@MSNBC I once saw a vintage reel of a nazi rally in black &amp; white and one of the attendees looked exactly like ted cruz; could be a relative. I cannot find this footage anywhere in cyberspace but I remember seeing it CNN(I believe). Don't listen to that cretin.
@RealDLHughley *APPLAUSE*👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@SenSchumer His words always rang hollow, Senator. He always encouraged violence.
@mayawiley That IS good news, ma'am.  Thank you very much!
@RealDLHughley A shame...meghan Kelly's looks would bump up a notch or two if she behaved less like a mule.  She needs to go back to fox tv where she would fit in.
@staceyabrams Governor-Elect Abrams, I believe it is only fitting that you and your political opponent call for a national debate hosted by CNN. 🙋🏿‍♂️ We the People, outside of Georgia cannot see inside...  y'know?
@RealDLHughley Now I understand what you mean by "everybody wanna be black until the cops arrive" regarding m. Kelly's remarks about blackface.
@JoyAnnReid We were ALWAYS in 'uncharted' territory, Ms. Reid.😒
@JamilSmith @staceyabrams @BrianKempGA Agreed.
@staceyabrams Maintain your steely-eyed, confident yet determined appearance.  I didn't get a chance to see the debate (I'm in South Carolina) but would appreciate a larger platform for another debate [read: CNN].
@jamdonaldson I'm not certain where that VA is located but if there is any position of authority anywhere Down South, chances are you will find these domestic terrorists holding that post down. Black folks have to face their oppressors everyday.
@RonaldKlain JON LOVITZ!!!😄 trump: Yeah... I'm a...  nationalist...  yeah! That's right! Uhhh-h-h... a WHITE nationalist... that's it!!! A white nationalist!😆
@SenSchumer Careful, Mr. Schumer... How does anyone know if mccarthy didn't have any personal enemies OUTSIDE his political life? More questions need to be asked instead of assuming conclusions of who did what? ...and where?
@mayawiley You're such a informative and charismatic guest on MSNBC particularly 'The Beat' hosted by Ari Melber. Didn't know about President Woodrow Wilson's capitulation to the Women Rights movement in the early 20th Century.
@JamilSmith May I suggest that you relay to the proper authorities sending reinforcements [Pres. Obama's group] assisting Ms. Abrams in Georgia and a investigative team into the fray?
@ReaI_VinDiesel What would make me happy is seeing Kaulder &amp; Chloe in a another story from 'The Last Witch Hunter'; what would their romance be like?😀A supernatural enforcer in a romance with a witch...? the possibilities? ENDLESS!
@KimKardashian APOLOGY REVOKED.👎🏿
@JoyAnnReid marco is a little wanna-be dictator himself. That's why he immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba and joined the republicans! I hope to Shiva that he gets voted out office very soon.
@AndrewGillum Excellent presentation at your debate, Mayor Gillum! 👍🏿Watched the whole event! You look very gubernatorial!👊🏿
@JamilSmith @AndrewGillum @RepDeSantis Yeah, I've noticed that, too, Mr. Smith. At some point I thought Mayor Gillum was reply with, "Who gave you permission to use my first name?" but he kept his composure.  👍🏿I believe I know who's going to be Florida's next governor. 👊🏿
@JoyAnnReid Beautiful peach red dress, Ms. Reid! 👍🏿 I'd recommend to the designer to add lace on the sleeves in a variant. 👚
@HardballChris Is it possible for you to refrain from interrupting your guests when they speak? It's irritating to watch. That's the number one reason I don't enjoy watching your 'show'. 👎🏿
@AGLynch Message received on voting rights for American citizens being our birthright, Ma'am. 🤟🏿Thank you! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@UnapologeticAMC Great appearance at 'The Dr. Oz Show', Ms. Tyler! Learned a lot about _______  that I didn't know today.👌🏾
@JoyAnnReid The gop a.k.a Grand Ol' Predators are desperate, Ms. Reid.
@Tip Great Work on the video, T.I.! If anyone asks, just say "This is the correct way to troll the acting-president." Besides, she's no First Lady, she's his Third Wife! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@maddow Great show this evening, Ms. Maddow!  Always felt that whole debacle with presidential candidate Gary Hart/Donna Rice was set up, 30 years later, we find out it was true! Wasn't into politics at that time but I remember...
@JoyAnnReid Why did this happen?
@MichaelAvenatti That's what I admire about you, Mr. Avenatti… you will not allow this minor setback deter you from your goals.  Keep at it! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
@MSNBC Please... god, no...! There's only so much I can stand of katy tur prime time on MSNBC covering the political news. She helped trump get elected in 2016 and now she's helping him again in 2018. Keep tur away! Far away...
@sunny Obviously the senator from Maine was under a tremendous amount of pressure to succumb to the republican's will. Doesn't excuse her incompetence and inability to think for herself.
@DrJasonJohnson Perhaps, they should call that red cap (made in China) MAGGOT. 😀
@JillWineBanks @allinwithchris @chrislhayes Lovely pin worn on MSNBC's ALL IN hosted by Chris Hayes;  I think this is the hand that Senator Feinstein was holding all this time.😀
@TheLastWord I'm curious who should get the Last Word on your show tonight, Mr. O'Donnell... I nominate Senator Cory Booker's speech inside the Judiciary Committee today.  It's lengthy but compelling IMHO.
@sunny Everything to do with it, ma'am!  👏👏👏  I'd like to know who was that courageous woman. 🌟
@JoyAnnReid Thank goodness for the Digital Age, eh?😄
@SenatorDurbin Appreciate your participation in the Judicial Committee, sir. I agree w/everything you have said on record inside that room and during the hearing yesterday.👏👏👏
@SenBooker Beautiful, eloquently,  impassioned speech inside the Judiary Committee, sir. 👏👏👏Did anyone ever tell you that you look like Vin Diesel? 😀
@thelauracoates I cracked up over the "I speak woman." comment on CNN regarding the republicans hiring a female to question Christine Ford!😀
@crampell watching this passionate debate on Don Lemon's show... GET 'EM, GURL!!!👏👏👏
@Lawrence Love your unshakable, nerves-of-steel political commentary.  Keep going! 👏👏👏   You got 'em on the ropes!👍
@amjoyshow @DrJasonJohnson Great show, Ms. Reid! 👏👏👏 This is the Joy Reid that I remember; intensively fun and fascinating debate... not one word in support of the unqualified game show host pretending to be an American President.
@Lawrence Keep going at it, Mr. O'Donnell! You're one of my most favorite political commentators on MSNBC!👏
@DrStaceyPatton True.
@RealDLHughley Thank you, D.L. for pointing out that disgraced Dallas ex-cop was the first ever convicted of murder. Didn't know that.  Keep up the good work!👍
@RealDLHughley Careful D.L. … not a good idea to knock gamers' hustle; they enjoy gaming so much, they want to earn cash &amp; prizes competing with others who also enjoy gaming.  They're not losers... well, some of them are second bananas but beside the point 🍌
@TheBeatWithAri Regarding the ostrich skin jacket, that item banned in the United States.
@ArvellPoe Hey, this is Battle from HEF!  I like the blue in your Twitter page!👍  Please befriend me when you have time.
@UnapologeticAMC I'm not sorry for laughing at Margaret Cho's lemon slice joke for the vagina last night! 😂
@reghud Hello Mr. Hudlin! This is Marv a.k.a. Battle from HEF... is there any particular reason why I cannot log in at HEF???  I'm blocked from calling up the site.
@UnapologeticAMC @aishatyler Yet another great show Ms. Tyler!  First time you featured all Black guests!  Ms. Tamara Tunie, and Mr. Bakari Sellars!😎
@Rob_Rogers @jaketapper What happens to political cartoonists?  Easy solution: All of those political cartoonists can bring back American animation.
@KimKardashian I want to thank you for advocating for Alice Marie Johnson commuting her sentence and free her from prison. This is an important issue I've been working on with President Obama when he was in office. I apologize If I offended you in the past.
@aishatyler @UnapologeticAMC Saw 'UNAPOLOGETIC' last night with your guests, a few cast members of the new show, 'DIETLAND' by which both shows are gonna be a hit this Summer! Please keep up the great work, Ms. Taylor! You are fun to watch...
@amjoyshow @gabrielsherman If you want to defeat drumphf, you must ridicule him... ---relentlessly.  We've got until November to clown this M/Fer and anyone associated with him.  That's more than enough time develop material until the Mid-Term Elections.
@amjoyshow One more thing: It is foolish to read 'on the air' his text messages from Twitter and whining about it. That's similar to visiting the doctor, "Doc, it hurts when I do this!" and the doctor replies, "Then stop doing it."  Y'know...? 🤐
@amjoyshow Ms. Reid, with all due respect... you're not helping matters when you concede that drumphf is controlling the message (he's not). We have three networks (NBC,CNN &amp; HLN), the U.S. Constitution, Special Counsel Mueller and the truth on our side. We are winning!
@RealDLHughley @HuffPostPol Lil' Note F/GED Section: Thank you for calling out the persons committing the majority of the domestic terrorist attacks are white males, that's why the slobs in D.C. ain't doing anything about it.
@DrStaceyPatton I hope the new Duke &amp; Duchess of  Sussex makes us all proud! Makes it last Dr. Patton.

@RealDLHughley Lil Note f/GED section today was insightful regarding choices enslaved Africans made during the 'Middle Passage'.  I almost teared!😪
@amjoyshow No, Ms. Wolf did not go too far. Yes, her commentary is merely a sign of our times.
@michelleisawolf Mika should talk... the only reason Mika is marrying Joe is because she doesn't want to be deported back to Russia! 🕵️‍♀️
@TheoHayesWBAL @NBCNews Destination: 30 Rockefella Plaza
@amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross You are correct, Ms Reid!
@michelleisawolf Fuck 'spicey'! 👎
@michelleisawolf Ms. Wolf you were mesmerizingly funny last night!😂
@michelleisawolf Loved the roast! Especially jokes about MSM creating the monster in the White House just to profit AND the ones about sarah huckleberry flanders smokey eye shadow make-up! My cheek hurt from giggling so much!😊
@DLHughleyRadio Saw on MSNBC's Deadline this afternoon!  You should walk on any news show (except fox news channel) more often when you've got something to say, man!
@wkamaubell CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR 2018 EMMY AWARD, Mr. Bell!😀
@DrStaceyPatton Thank you for that!  Thank you for that!😀
@TheoHayesWBAL     DESTINATION: New York City!    It's clear as water, Ms Hayes!
@JoyAnnReid Of course American might is being deployed by an acting-president to deflect from the serial scandals surrounding him, ma'am.  Regardless, Monday cohen still has to appear inside court. :)

@TheoHayesWBAL WE MISS YOU, THEO HAYES!!! EVERYONE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AND WMBF MISSES YOU!
@RealDLHughley Actually, THANK YOU, DL for putting Dem Jones on your radio show for a whole hour. You changed the world.
@RealDLHughley @NewDay @CNN @ChrisCuomo @dpshow See you w/Chris Cuomo on CNN, DL! Go get 'em!
@DLHughleyRadio Punchline:  president.  Nice, D.L. !
@DLHughleyRadio @RealDLHughley Iz U Iz R Iz U Ain't...? could be a new ultimatum, D.L.
@DLHughleyRadio @RealDLHughley Great perspective re: NFL &amp; plantations from the bad ol' days, DL!
@DLHughleyRadio Another gem from the G.E.D. section re: bill 'blame gpd' o'reilly!
@RealDLHughley An empty suit! Go get 'em, DL!!!
@RealDLHughley Great commentary comparing what's happening in NK w/the followrs of drumpf right here in USA; the conflict is th same.
@DLHughleyRadio @RealDLHughley You scorched that religious 'leader' today, DL! Should be interesting how his congregation handles reality in th future
@RealDLHughley Heard about the unfair incident regarding your wife from lil note from GED section &amp; why you want to sue. Good move!!!
@TheLastWord Congratulations on your Emmy nomination, Mr O'Donnell! That's a total of 3: All-In, TRMS, &amp; The Last Word. Amazing! :)

@amjoyshow Congratulations on A.M. JOY's anniversary, Ms Reid!
@RealDLHughley Hehehe Hehehe!!!
@maddow Keep going Ms Maddow!!!
@maddow Damn, Ms Maddow...you're good! Your magnificent reporting influenced that 'Bama gov to resign. Would like impeachment
@RealDLHughley Loved your commentson the radio in the GED Section regarding companies behaving like pimps! Keep up the great work!
Was checking my Following list. Don't recall adding drumpf or his wife to but it was mysterious there. Deleted both.
@maddow @maddow HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Rachel!!! You're the Point Guard of American politics. :)
@michelleobama @cardozoec I'm more impressed by you and your husband. Enjoy your day!
@dlhughleyradio @realdlhughley Black woman early wig detection!  You're a funny guy, DL!
@thr @realdlhughley as if FOX needs more guidos! :)
@realdlhughley My mother went to your show this weekend at Florence Civic Cntr, SC. Said you &amp; your boys slammed!

@PoliticsNation Important detail: during the trial, the terminology changed from 'victim' to 'deceased'. Not fair.
@TheJusticeDept Good news!
@CCSCSL @GMHikaru @cnni Should be interesting to spectate.
@TheoHayes Is it just me, or are ALL of the news cast ladies dressing to compete fiercely....? :-)
@NewDay @cnni South Korea is just reacting to North Korea b/c of major changes to Starcraft2 2day :-)
@JoyAnnReid You're right, Ms Reid... trump truly is 'ratchet'!  :-)
@TheAcademy The genie earned Aladdin's last wish.

@MsTaraDowdell @MSNBC @PoliticsNation Look great in ivory! :)
@MauriceAshley Interesting...

@VinceWarren watching you on MH-P this morning, sir!  :)
@kaj33 @PoppyHarlowCNN watching you right now talkin about 'stop body shaming female athletes'
@PoliticsNation James Holmes is the #1 why I will never ever walk into a movie theater.
@PoliticsNation Too suspicious!!! I don't believe she committed suicide... She was killed.
@MichaelEDyson Sorry about hearing about your brother in prison on The Ed Show. I have a brother also victimized by CJS.
@VP @genprogress Climate change is VERY real.
@JoyAnnReid @NowWithAlex Excellent point about not flying the Japanese flag in California on NOW hosted by Alex Wagner!
@MsTaraDowdell @msnbc @PoliticsNation I watch Politics Nation ev'rday, Ms Dowdell! BTW, you look great in that red dress! :D
@TheoHayes Oh, by the way, congratulations on being recognized by the EARLY Today show! Keep up the great work!  :)
@TheoHayes @wmbfnews Somehow, I don't believe  Jesus would appreciate being put into such a precarious situation. :)
@maddow Ms Maddow, I've been up since 3:30am on ALL the news channels. Sleep? What's that...?  :)
@maddow You've expressed my exact sentiments re: Pres Obama's nuclear deal w/Iran on your show tonight, Ms Maddow!
@ProfessorCrunk Watching you on NOW hosted by Alex Wagner on MSNBC right now. Agree w/everything you said re: criminal justice
@jdbalart Happy anniversary on your show, sir! The show is quite pleasant &amp; informative in the mornings on MSNBC.
@HillaryClinton Smart follow-up speech to the Iran nuclear deal, Madam soon-to-be President!
@VP Congratulations on reaching a deal w/Iran regarding nuclear weapons. Now if you could convince this Congress to agree... :)
@MHarrisPerry Very good performance, Bilal on MH-P!
@FLOTUS Go 'head, First Lady!
@RevDrBarber Great interview on MH-P!  You really brought your A game in the discussion.
@TheoHayes the beauty of change is hearing you announce the day the confederate flag is removed. Enjoy your day!
@foreverLiberal agreed state sen Jenny Horne took the flag debate home! Tell her, "thank you!"
@PoliticsNation Maria is like, my Mom! She was my mom when my mom wasn't home. Good luck, Ms Manzana!
@edshow looks &amp; sounds good, Ed! Enjoy the July 4th weekend, virtual friend# :)
@VP @DrBiden have fun
@edshow going crazy w/the bbq ribs, eh, Ed? Gimme a piece!!!
@PoliticsNation liked the imagery of Rev Al portrait on $10 bill!  :)
@TheRevAl fascinating learning about your great grandfather and guest state sen Thurmond talk about the confederate flag removal
@TheoHayes service very reminiscent of Diana Ross &amp;Supremes 'Someday We'll Be Together'
@maddow It was one 30 sec meeting w/Keith Haring 26 yrs ago that helped me understand gay marriage. Congratulations, Ms Maddow
@DrBiden Congratulations, Dr Biden! On the Supreme Court ruling on both ACA &amp; Gay marriage I apologize for not tweeting sooner

@MichelleObama Congratulations, First Lady on the Supreme Court ruling on ACA
@POTUS Congratulations on the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act!
@Bakari_Sellers I liked Rep Grady Brown's answer on CNN: "the flag needs to be cleaned." :)
@HillaryClinton Madam Secretary, your campaign logo is a bit weak. Use the American script style from this dinner RSVP. Trust me.
@Bakari_Sellers Great interview on CNN. Thanks for everything and I agree w/you've said. Plz make certain SC House does it.
@TheoHayes so Mr Klugh is gone for good?  Btw, you look classy in canary yellow this morning!
@Eugene_Robinson great article Mr Robinson! Liked it so much, I posted it at HEF (Hudlin Entertainment Forum)
@maddow Another informative show, Ms Maddow!  The More You Know Now.	:)
@joanwalsh Heh. I've just noticed that there is a dog in place of the House Speaker in you main header! Ha!
@Eugene_Robinson just glanced at your article Mr Robinson, I, too strongly believe that attack was an assassination.
@Bakari_Sellers would that cop have uttered such a remark if equipped with a body cam?
@Bakari_Sellers you are a'diamond in the rough' what're your political ambitions?
@Bakari_Sellers Don't give up the fight! Stay the course. You need to hire me by your side.
@joanwalsh If Hillary wants to be prez, tell her to study Kate Mulgrew &amp; Katherine Hepburn. Tell her, ALL 8 seasons of Voyager
@Bakari_Sellers sorry to hear what happened to your father in Orangeburg, SC. I implore you, run again next election cycle, sir.
@HillaryClinton solid speech madam soon to be president of the United States
@HillaryClinton ...or read Kate Mulgrew's new book to study her leadership style.
@HillaryClinton pick up Star Trek: Voyager. All 8 seasons. Study Kate Mulgrew &amp; study Katherine Hepburn for strong lady leaders
@TheoHayes Agree
@TheoHayes Most certainly! Say, how come u didn't cast on WMBF this morning? Wanted to see a AA female newscaster tell SC th news
@Bakari_Sellers great interview, sir! Those other flag examples displayed by Mr Cuomo can alway be redesigned. Just a thought.
@Eugene_Robinson great showing as a guest on The Last Word. Fascinating hearing about you growing up in South Carolina
@RepRutherford Great showing on The Rachel Maddow Show regarding the removal of that confederate flag in the state Capital of SC
@TheRevAl @PoliticsNation Tara is wonderful in yello &amp; white today Mr. Sharpton!  :)
@Bakari_Sellers can't you be just a lil more optimistic? I hear what you're sayin but try remain as u say 'cautiously optimistic'
@Clyburn CONGRATULATIONS!!! ... to this historic day! Great interview on CNN!
@Bakari_Sellers Great showing on CNN! Run again next election season! I'll vote for you!
@donlemon strong point regarding "why are there 2 flags to represent 1 country?" Enjoy your day, sir!
@donlemon When using terminology there's connotation &amp; denotation; Does anyone recognize which form President Obama used?
@ChrisCuomo Very impressed with th questioning that general colonel sanders from Spartanburg SC and mayor riley from Charleston.
@MHarrisPerry Very informative show &amp; very distinguished guests this Ms Harris-Perry
@SunnyHostin it did seem as if the judge was actually berating the families of the victims. Welcome to South Carolina
@MichaelEDyson Thank you for pointing out on The Ed Show the confeferate flag is mounted in SC state
@JoyAnnReid Thank you for mentioning on the The Ed Show that South Carolina flies the confederate flag at its state Capital.
@POTUS @LorettaLynch gov haley's crocodile tears &amp; insincere comments regarding that massacre in SC is truly not welcome.
@ChrisCuomo gov jindal is full o shit mr. Cuomo
@TheoHayes truly horrible... I hope the Dept of Justice gets involved.
@TheoHayes you remind me of a superhero today. Aurora &amp; Northstar from Alpha Flight. :)
@NailTheNumbers HOW CAN I GET THAT CNBC T-SHIRT? I WANT THAT SHIRT?
@jimcramer I WANT THAT CNBC T-SHIRT!!! HOW DO I GET IT?
@SquawkCNBC How do enter th sweepstakes to get that t-shirt.
@PoliticsNation part of the surge in violence is because police are derelict in their duties; all police have to do is be there.
@NewDay @EarlyStart looks like a hate group rally against Islam to me.
@thecyclemsnbc liked your guest comment "too many MCs, not enough mics." Nice! :)
@ChrisCuomo good point regarding car safety training segment, Mr. Cuomo
@TheoHayes Looking sharp in light grey &amp; white this morning, Ms Hayes!
@rocsidiaz Love your show on HLN, Ms Diaz! Much more pleasant than BET.
@ChuckSD @TheRevAl @msnbc @PoliticsNation Is this the same Chuck D from PE??? That doesn't sound like something you'd say...
@TheRevAl @msnbc Always with you Rev Al! Thanks &amp; bless you for everything you done, sir.
@POTUS welcome Mr. President! I can't thank you enough for everything you've accomplished at White House
@TheoHayes sorry for late tweets. Mr. Klugh, of course. He kinda looks like one of the Duke boys from Dukes of Hazzard County.
@MichaelaCNN They should call Chris the 'Italian Stallion' of CNN! :)
@JohnBerman CONGRATS!  On winning prize money from Jeopardy &amp; donating to charity of your choice. :)
@ChrisCuomo @CJHerod @NTSB No question about it... PTC could theoretically have prevented that train accident. No failsafe
@TheoHayes Never thought I'd be glad to see Mr. Klugh return to cast! Btw, is Jenna related to Judy DeAngeles from WNBC 66 NY?
@ChrisCuomo @CNN Keep going... you're performing great in the mornings, Mr. Cuomo.
@TheoHayes @wmbfnews He is far more handsome than your new creepy fill-in male co-host. My poor eyes! :(
@TheoHayes re: police appreciation dinner in Conway? Too self-congratulating. Still want body cam installed.
@davidaxelrod Agreed, Mr. Axelrod.
@TheoHayes Back in black I see, Ms. Hayes! :)
@thehill HILARIOUS WITH TH ANGER TRANSLATOR!!!
@RealDLHughley @CNN @OWNTV DL is showing a tremendous amount of restraint sitting next to tara. :)
@RealDLHughley @CNN @OWNTV Always admired how you keep it real, DL!
@RealDLHughley Thanks for keeping it real, DL!
@RealDLHughley very insightful point o view on cnn coverage o WHCD!
@MichelleObama love the Shirley Temple doo at the White House Correspondents' Dinner!
Love First Lady's Shirley Temple doo at the White House Correspondent's dinner!
@TheoHayes You look pretty in pink today, Ms. Hayes!
@JoyAnnReid @MHarrisPerry That Tulsa deputy is clearly lying about killing that man, Ms Reid.
@CCSCSL Hey guys!  There should be a rule: winners take the defeated out to dinner!
@MauriceAshley Great show today, Mr. Ashley!
@DanielRensch @JenShahade @CCSCSL yeah Yassar has the most calm, cool, collected, most gentlemanly voice in the show.
@ChessClubLive @CCSCSL I didn't see Ms Krush's results... did she lose the match?
@CCSCSL @GMHikaru he he he was there any doubt that Nakamura wouldn't pull off a win?
@CCSCSL woops!   I met Tatev!  Guess I was thinking of Krush!	:)
@CCSCSL Yeah...that was amazing!  Looks like Ms. Krush is not infallible as I thought! Good game, ladies.  Next round should be interesting
@CCSCSL Great show online, Grandmasters!!!	I've noticed that you have a new female caster. Nice !	;)
@TheoHayes great show this morning Ms Hayes!
@Foxy991 ENJOY YOUR B-DAY, JANE DOUGH! LOVE YOUR SHOW ON FOXY99!
@TheoHayes looking fabulous this morning with the bangles, Ms. Hayes!
@TheReidReport Yes!!!  I love Awkward Black Girl on YouTube!   Saw the series when it first appeared.
@nick_ramsey @JoyAnnReid @IssaRae @janetmock 	Blessed!	:)
@TheRevAl  Faith, Midwin Charles, Tara Dowdell is most certainly your most attractive guests on your show, Mr. Sharpton.
@PoliticsNation @SI_Swimsuit 		She's so fine!!!   All the right curves...
@TheoHayes Why Am I getting double tweets???
@TheoHayes news cast this morning...really?  A parent disciplining their child is considered "graphic" violence that needed to be blurred?
@TheoHayes AMEN!  :)
@TheoHayes To Mr. Klugh, the reason the drinking age is 21+ is b/c alcohol is a bad combo with drinking and military service.
@TheoHayes Love the comment about triggering metal detectors in response to the story about the guy w/ metal imbedded inside arm. :)
@TheReidReport  saw a headline that read 'Reid Suffers Broken Ribs, Facial Bones After Exercising Accident' I was OMG! not JOY
@TheoHayes  Not at all, Ms. Hayes.  I just believe you are a breath of fresh air on the local news here in South Carolina.
@TheRevAl   There are 2 goals you need to accomplish when resuming police protests.1.Uniform Code of Conduct.2.Uniform Code of Justice.
@JoyAnnReid   I want to write stories &amp; news reports for 'The Reid Report' someday.  How can I go about doing that?
@TheoHayes  Do you foresee yourself inside the NBC studios in New York anytime soon?
@PoliticsNation   Reverend Al Sharpton, please don't be persuaded to halt all police protests after this unfortunate tragedy.
@TheRevAl 	Always keep it real, Reverend!   :)
@TheRevAl 		Go 'head, Rev Al!
@PoliticsNation   Rev. Chuck Nice... Hm...   Has an interesting ring to it!  :)
@PoliticsNation What's wrong with going to the Met?
@PoliticsNation  Great show today, Rev Al!  :)
@TheReidReport   Stick around... There' s more garbage coming out of the video game industry to smear!  ;)
@TheReidReport   Everything Ms. Wu and Eric Johnson said about the video gaming industry is 100% correct. Glad you covered this story Joy!
@PoliticsNation   If anyone were to ask her, "What is your ethnicity?"	I wonder what she'd say?
@PoliticsNation The skit was 'just right', in my opinion.  Sarah Silverman is, sometimes, one of my favorite celebrities.
@PoliticsNation @danajacobson @msnbc Told ya!   :)
@PoliticsNation @danajacobson @msnbc I feel Chuck Nice is about say something that causes me to spit out my drink!   :)
@jscurry44 @PoliticsNation   Agreed.
@PoliticsNation Remember what happened to Princess Diana?
@PoliticsNation 	Not necessarily a woman problem. I'd say a leadership problem and perhaps a thorough review of the entire personnel &amp; staff
Yes she is... @BetoMetroDos    Yes she is!  :)
@BrentSpiner 	No... not really... No
Rest peacefully, Mr Kershner!  You directed the best Star Wars movie in th' entire series!
My gosh...  I haven't been here in a hundred yrs!  I am surprised I still have a Twit'r account!
Missed the launch but heard the astronaughts in real-time on The Tom Joyner Morning Show today!  Hot damn!
If it wasn't for Sesame Street back in the early 70s, I'd be illiterate today!  :)
