24 Iraqi interpreters were denied in FY18, for a denial rate of 92%. This is 37 times higher than the denial rate for average refugees. This is totally unacceptable. Many of these people will be killed because of their service to the US. The time to act is now #SaveOurAllies
Specifically, we are asking the House Armed Services Committee to hold a hearing on why our allies are being left behind. The data Congress obtained in USCIS's response to the Kamran letter shows that only 2 Iraqi interpreters were admitted as refugees in FY18.
Great meeting with staff for @RepMcGovern @RepTimRyan @RepGaramendi and @RepBrianMast about the Kamran family's case and the US's shameful treatment of our foreign allies. Thank you for your support and we hope to see Congress take action to keep our promises to our interpreters!

Afghans and Iraqis targeted by terrorists for having served the US military have no choice but to flee but often cannot afford to try to get to Europe. That is why denials of their cases is effectively a death sentence. Yet USCIS denied 92% of Iraqi interpreters in FY18.
Many Afghan refugees who survived this trip still live in uncertainty in Europe or were already deported because of unfavorable policies for Afghans. Other Afghans like the Kamran family live in constant fear in hiding in Afghanistan or a neighboring country. https://t.co/quBsuXXk3W

@NateWatkins @Neoavatara Nuclear energy tech is not something I've studied a lot, but my comments were based on a energy policy seminar I took at Cornell a couple of years ago. My point was that nuclear technology has improved considerably in the last 35 years so many of the issues have been remedied.
@NateWatkins @Neoavatara For example, Cornell University scientists and engineers disagree on many environmental policy issues (like the relative merits of corn ethanol, fracking, and other controversial policies) and even on which climate change models are more reliable.
@NateWatkins @Neoavatara I think the GOP should be more concerned about environmental policy. Ignoring a problem is different than proposing a less popular solution. But some of the policies pushed by environmental groups are not necessarily the best policies scientifically.

@Ted_Howze @JeffDenham @joshharder Did Republicans get new registrations too? There were 241,000 votes cast in the Denham-Eggman 2016 race. Two positive points are that Denham is stronger in Stanislaus and that in 2016 the race didn't shift D as mail in votes were counted unlike other CA districts.
@Ted_Howze @JeffDenham @joshharder In 2014 there were 125,000 votes cast in the district and they are reporting 112,000 votes counted so far in 2018.

@mcbelz Pakistani media is reporting that #AsiaBibi and her family have made it out of the country safely. But several people have already been killed and many homes and businesses destroyed in massive anti-American and anti-Christian protests in Pakistan promoted by the Taliban.
@anghunt26 @AlanLCross For example, I have repeatedly contacted Fox News about my family's effort to save a military interpreter and they ignored me but did publish stories from Cornell/Ithaca about a fraternity sex scandal, a cancelled high school play, and a student giving a speech in her underwear.
@anghunt26 @AlanLCross Other problem is that media only talks about scandalous things. You can't make the news by trying to fix problems even if you put in an extraordinary effort. Media won't talk about pastors giving a thoughtful sermon on immigration but you can make headlines by shredding Nikes.

@Rainbird42true @JJ_Denhollander @robsak72 @GLW280 @cewgreen And this case was originally denied during the Obama Administration, but Trump's anti immigration policies are making it much harder to get it reconsidered, as I've publicly stated: https://t.co/8IqZdbqeL7
@Rainbird42true @JJ_Denhollander @robsak72 @GLW280 @cewgreen A few have been helpful/sympathetic (Blumenthal, Kaine, Rubio, Cantwell, King, Ernst, Warren) but Sen. Feinstein's staff said they believe the case was likely denied for a weak reason BUT they'd rather the family die than the humanitarian case be approved because "that's policy."
@Rainbird42true @JJ_Denhollander @robsak72 @GLW280 @cewgreen We got 38 members of the House (28 Dems and 10 Republicans) to send a letter requesting to know why the case was denied. 10 out of 10 Dems we met with and 4 out of 9 Republicans signed the letter. Most Senate offices are ignoring the case.
@Rainbird42true @JJ_Denhollander @robsak72 @GLW280 @cewgreen And Feinstein's staff was rude to me and later lied about our conversation. Our attorney said Sen. Feinstein's office has a prior reputation about not caring to help with individual cases. And Sen. Shaheen's staff is stonewalling me and Rep. Raskin's office.
@Rainbird42true @JJ_Denhollander @robsak72 @GLW280 @cewgreen They could request information on why the case was denied but they refused to help. Feinstein's attorney told me she'd rather the whole family die than the humanitarian cases be approved. And she lied to no only me but other Senate offices and told them not to help me.

@mcbelz The problem is not just the absolute value but also the composition of those who are admitted. Overall Christian refugees are down 43% but Iranian Christians are down 98% and Iraqi Christians 99.7%. US military interpreters and family are down 90 to 98% as well.

@JJ_Denhollander @robsak72 @GLW280 @cewgreen That they really care about protecting women now. Sen Feinstein's staff was the most dishonest and cold hearted out of 44 Congressional offices I have dealt with. Maybe they were trying to respect Ms. Ford's wishes here but I don't trust Feinstein's office at all
@JJ_Denhollander @robsak72 @GLW280 @cewgreen They agreed with me that the family was likely denied for a weak reason like a misspelled name on a document and agreed that they will all be murdered or trafficked if the case is not re-opened but said "that's policy" and I should stop wasting my time. So I don't trust them.
@JJ_Denhollander @robsak72 @GLW280 @cewgreen That is the official explanation of timing from Feinstein's office. But Feinstein's staff didn't care one iota about women's rights when I presented them compelling evidence that an Afghan interpreter's refugee case was wrongfully denied and his daughters could end up trafficked
@alionsheart1 @krassenstein Thanks! If you want to keep in touch my email is save.aysha@gmail.com
@robsak72 @JJ_Denhollander @GLW280 @cewgreen My comments were intended to address the timing of Sen Feinstein and her staff's handling of the allegations, which I don't trust to be motivated by genuine concern for the Ms Ford.

@JJ_Denhollander @GLW280 @cewgreen I agree with your concerns. It is possible that Sen Feinstein's motivations on timing were sincere, but given her staff's treatment of my case (albeit a very different situation) I don't trust their honesty or compassion at all.
@JJ_Denhollander @GLW280 @cewgreen Sen Feinstein's staff also repeatedly lied to me and to other Senate Offices to discourage them from assisting. While the Senator is likely not aware of the case personally, her staff was the most dishonest and cold hearted out of 25 Senate offices that I met.
@JJ_Denhollander @GLW280 @cewgreen Sen Feinstein's staff was the worst. A senior staffer in her office told me that trying to save this family is "undermining the process" and she would rather the whole family including the children die than the humanitarian cases approved because "that's policy."
@JJ_Denhollander @GLW280 @cewgreen Although I realize that respect for the victim's wishes is the official explanation for the timing, I do not trust Sen Feinstein and her staff. I met with 44 Congressional offices to ask for help with this case and am from CA. https://t.co/f1DeFw19sQ
@alionsheart1 @krassenstein Yes and I also wish international crises got more media attention than they do. I saw a few stories about the bombed bus but little attention has been paid to crises in Yemen, Nicaragua, etc.
@alionsheart1 @krassenstein Thanks and yes agreed about the countries on the list. I think Afghanistan is not officially a banned country (Iraq has been on and off the list in different iterations). But Afghan SIV arrivals are down 90% so at least unofficially the govt doesn't want Afghans.

@AlanLCross Agreed. And FYI I found two new reporters who are working on stories about the Kamran family's case that will be published in the next few days. And USCIS missed their deadline today to tell Congress why they denied the case. Maybe not sure how to spin blacklisting a toddler.
@mcbelz So it seems like the information is not classified (because they only asked for one form and would need multiple to have a classified hearing.) But regardless USCIS is defying their deadline to reply to Congress now.
@mcbelz USCIS missed their deadline today to tell Congress why they blacklisted the Kamran family. Not sure if it is intentional stonewalling or general incompetence. They told Denham's staff  last week that they needed a privacy form and we got them the form the next day.

@MatthewSoerens One of the kindest and hardest working people I knew was a Mexican immigrant who came to the US as a young man but loved America. He was a family friend of ours for decades until he passed away a few years ago. His son and grandsons served as police and military.
@MatthewSoerens Italians later lobbied to be considered white and not Latino since it was politically advantageous. But it is shameful that the idea that non-white immigrants are inherently a threat is back to being mainstream in some subsets of America.
@MatthewSoerens I learned in a freshman seminar (which was several years ago) that for a time Italians and other Southern Europeans were considered non-white because many Americans didn't want Catholic immigrants and the US government was restricting non-white immigration.
@ExGOP_IA Yes these big fires kill many animals, too. It is impossible to know how many animals are killed and even estimates are rarely reported. But tragic nonetheless.

@AlanLCross @peedeelou But there should be a better policy in place to deal with this kind of situation than deport spouses of veterans even if they neglected to obtain legal status when they could have.
@AlanLCross @peedeelou I think the article was vague about what steps she had or had not taken to obtain legal status, and at one point it said the denials of parole in place increased from 11% to 16% which is not as dramatic as it implied elsewhere.

@AlanLCross @mcbelz But anytime they use broad reasons like nationality or religion it is an illegal abuse of discretion. Problem is usually no one can ever get the information to prove they abused their discretion.
@AlanLCross @mcbelz They use it as a blanket excuse. The Iranian refugees tried to come under a special program that required USCIS to disclose to the fullest extent possible the reason for denial but they just checked a box. But these refugees had better status than most to challenge it I think.
@AlanLCross @mcbelz Aysha is probably the youngest person to be blacklisted by USCIS. I'd like to know if her mother was expecting how far alone she'd have to be before the unborn baby would be a security concern. Effectively USCIS gave a death sentence to a family that supported us for 10 yrs.
@AlanLCross @mcbelz USCIS is hiding behind "discretionary reasons" for all the refugees they want to deny for political reasons. USCIS wrote to our attorney that allowing the 3 YO daughter of a US military interpreter to live with her aunt and uncle for 1 yr is a "discretionary security concern."

@maisonbob1 @tedlieu @FLOTUS We had to file six separate cases for all family members.

@maisonbob1 @tedlieu @FLOTUS Actually everything for Aysha's case was done legally and with the support of military officers who personally worked with her father while he was an interpreter in Afghanistan for 7 yr.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yes, the US needs more humane policies for asylum seekers and other refugees. Please help with getting this case re-opened for a 2YO refugee child in critical danger.  USCIS says giving 1-yr visa to 2YO is a security concern. #SaveAysha #SaveOurAllies https://t.co/5VQROY04ec

@jmartNYT My family is trying to save an Afghan interpreter who worked 7 yrs for the US military, his wife, and 4 daughters from the Taliban with humanitarian parole. USCIS denied the whole family b/c says giving a 1-yr visa to a 2 YO girl is a security concern. https://t.co/XGhKR3DvkL

@tedlieu Sad how politics has lead to Christians re-interpreting the Bible and/or ignoring clear statements about helping people in need. Also Psalm 82:4 - Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.

@mcbelz My petition has more details on the case I'm working on, including our process with USCIS. I got involved in Jan 2017. RFR was denied in Feb 2017. We tried HP cases w no success so now trying to re-open the refugee case. https://t.co/XGhKR3DvkL
@mcbelz Abuse of discretion could be a violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, if USCIS is broadly using their nationality as the discretionary reason. But USCIS hides behind "security" and "privacy" so no one ever knows why grandmothers are a threat to security.
@mcbelz When our lawyer pressed USCIS on the reason, they refused to give her any info. She asked them to let the kids live w/ US family. USCIS said their "information" concerns the kids as well. So USCIS refused to give a 1-yr visa to a 2 YO girl b/c unstated "security concerns."
@mcbelz M Kamran was a highly trusted US military interpreter for 7 yrs &amp; the Taliban says he is a Christian so he had to flee Afghanistan. My family sponsored all 6 members of the Kamran family for Humanitarian Parole. USCIS denied the HP cases also b/c they had been denied before.
@mcbelz The case is essentially the same from a legal perspective (but no European countries involved - the family is in hiding in South Asia). Family members in the US are LPRs.  Kamrans applied on their own as refugees and were denied under "other reasons" and the RFR was also denied.
@mcbelz So all refugees in the group have been denied at least once, and 4-5 have pending RFRs but the rest of the RFRs have been denied? So legal status for most is the same as the case I am working on. And just curious is the 74 YO grandmother a principle applicant?
@JoanneLinDC My family, dozens of Congressional offices, and 47k petition signers are fighting to save an Afghan refugee family in critical danger b/c the father served the US military for 7 yrs. Trump Admin says 2YO is a security concern. #SaveAysha https://t.co/5VQROY04ec
@mcbelz Have their RFRs been denied also? This looks like the original denial for discretionary reasons but there is a different form letter for denying RFRs.
