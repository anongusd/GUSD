@JoshdelaRosa1 I was laying out all of the possible options, but prefer focusing on the citizenship question in terms of not responding to it or lying about immigration status. I included a total boycott, the nuclear option, to stress that it could make the entire Census useless for Trump.

@CortesSteve But total dodging of gun control issue and caving in to the NRA.
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov You're backing down on your promise to support a DACA fix!
@CBSNews So why make it EASIER for them to get guns! ¡Coño!
@CortesSteve But now he is backing down on fixing DACA, whose recipients are de facto American citizens.
@CortesSteve Following Trump's example, show us your birth certificate and those of your parents!
On CNBC comedian/actor Bill Murray criticizes Dems: “‘They pick out little pieces of a population and say they represent it — we represent the Hispanics, we represent the LGBT, or something, . . . It’s almost demeaning to say, ‘we’re using you, because you’re a splinter group.’”
@BrianLehrer You need to mention that colleges and universities are becoming increasingly corporate oriented and students are getting the short end.

@CortesSteve Illegal immigration is an American creation, allowed to attract cheap labor. To blame the immigrants is to misunderstand its basis and the real solution --- employer, not employee, sanctions!
@CortesSteve A better Trump message or a stronger position and history on sexual harassment? Going to the better messaging argument is a loser!
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Hasn't it been established that it was but one among other factors that the FISA court took into account?

@NydiaVelazquez @repjoecrowley @RepYvetteClarke @DHSgov @ICEgov I have started to call Trump’s policies his REIGN OF IMMIGRATION TERRORISM. The point of this is to create havoc in immigrant communities, including removing its leaders. Good luck getting a meeting with these terrorists.

How much os a Dreamerworth to Trump? According to his latest "framework", it is $13,889 each. That's a wasteful $25 billion for his "wall" on top of the $13 billion we already spend on border security. What a way to run a country!

What's your take on the political status of Puerto Rico? Should Congress grant statehood or give it is independence?
Trump wants $20 billion for his wall in exchange for DACA extension --- that's $25,000 per DACA recipient. It seems like a hostage situation with Trump as literally a mass brownmailer!
