@ewwaldo Congrats and happy birthday @ewwaldo !!
@DanCGoldberg @policywonk1 While I’m here,I’ll just close by saying the question is a good one to contemplate and there’s more we can learn by closely comparing the health and edu delivery systems and learning together instead of pretending both are terminally unique. Thank you for listening to my TED talk
@DanCGoldberg @policywonk1 Also thnx for mentioning increasing costs—tech doesn’t have the same direct impact on changes in delivery as it does in health; so why is this our cost curve in higher ed? 🧐 https://t.co/JQjkWprWVt
@DanCGoldberg @policywonk1 My point being the pitfalls of looking for costs solely in the edu tab of a spreadsheet is actually part of why it’s very hard to see the true cost. In health, much easier to point to events such as premature death and say yeah that was a bad outcome.
@DanCGoldberg @policywonk1 Counterpoint: cost of *not* investing/attaining results does go up exponentially; for those we failed to serve early on, their outcomes cost us big time. Ex: 1yr in prison ~$30-60k. Unemployment benefits in 2017 totaled $29.4 Billion (non-emergency); SSI in 2017 totaled $57.3B

@ColinReusch it's that whole "humans aren't actually rational" thing coming into play. At the end o the day, i'm just cranky about people diving into analysis before asking themselves "what will i do with this data, and therefore, what's the REAL question i'm asking"
@ColinReusch Tracts are *better*, but it all depends on the use-case for the analysis. I think too often ppl try to get "neighborhood picture" of things that don't match up to reality, i.e. people may not actually attend the school/church/hospital that is geographically closest to them
just your friendly reminder that ZIP codes were designed to deliver mail by the US Postal Service not to generate detailed analysis about what's happening in neighborhoods because neighborhoods have more nuanced boundariessss i'll be repeating this until i expire, huh?

Just tagging in my workforce dev/economic mobility friends so they can read this fantastic piece of reporting: @AchievGapBuster @jsorin721 @NYATEP @AmberLMooney @RushkaTcholakov @brittanyhorn @KalinScot @ everybody honestly
For the skeptics out there: here's our LOCAL data: 	4,273 ppl are unemployed in Albany. 	4,773 households make less than $10k a year.	3,690 make between $10-15K a year.	5,193 make between $15-25K a year.	So in sum: 13,656 households are living in poverty. Vs 4,273 unemployed.
"Cheap solutions only cheapen the problem."		Thank you so much @just_shelter for writing this piece. I work in this economic mobility field, and so many leaders can't see what the data is telling them b/c their own mental models of poverty are so far off base.
"When we shrink the problem, the solution shrinks with it; when small solutions are applied to a huge problem, they don’t work; and when weak antipoverty initiatives don’t work, many throw up their hands and argue that we should stop tossing money at the problem altogether."
"We need a new language for talking about poverty. “Nobody who works should be poor,” we say. That’s not good enough. Nobody in America should be poor, period. No single mother struggling to raise children on her own; no formerly incarcerated man who has served his time..."
2% of the poor population is nonworking. You're basically more likely to get hit by a bus than encounter one (no data to back me up there, but you get my point). So why so much focus on imposing work requirements for critical social service safety nets?
Here's how ppl in poverty break down: 33% are children;11% elderly;24% working-age adults in the labor force. Of those left: 12% are disabled;15% are students or caretakers;3% retirees. That leaves 2% of the poor not in any of these categories.
In 2016, 7.6M americans were classified as "working poor" meaning they spent &gt;50% of the year working or searching for work, most &gt;age 35.Most Americans (2/3s) believe the poor don't work; which isn't true. They work, but the pay is so bad, workers can't get out of poverty
If y'all can't set aside 10min, here's the synopsis: With a strong ntl economy &amp; millions of jobs unfilled, the ? as we think about those in poverty isn't can I find a job, but rather what jobs require little edu but pay. The answer? Not many/if at all

@AchievGapBuster Our rates are high (around 90+) but that doesn't always mean that a dev screening is done during that visit. A bunch of stuff happens at those, so part of the challenge is untangling did the screen happen? what was the result? Did the child make it to the referral?
@AchievGapBuster This is much earlier-starting at 9mo thru 30mo. It’s not a law, it’s part of clinical best practice but as you know that doesn’t always mean it’s happening day in and day out!

@mirigreenberg @educationweek ooo but it's not always that obvious! Thnx for this!
Our kids and families need our help more than we often talk about, at a scale that can be overwhelming. If you care about the kids at the border, please also care about the kids in your city. They need you and we need their talent to drive us through the next century.
I was reminded of this today acutely when a high school student who we know through some other work worked up the courage to share that her family’s electricity was shut off yesterday—in full summer heat—due to a few missed payments. There’s a 1-yr old at home too.
I guarantee you there is significant need for kids and families RIGHT NOW in your backyard. Kids in poverty are constantly being exposed to toxic stress, forever reducing their potential.
Been thinking abt this lately, but I’m finally done for the day so here goes—I’m so, so heartened💕to see so many voice their repulsion and compassion for the children being separated from their families right now. So many worried about the ramifications. But pls don’t stop now.

Next, requiring all Managed Care Organization to have a Kids Quality Agenda to develop improvement plans for kids (this might be a personal favorite of mine... you can imagine why...) #First1KDaysNY

Braided funding for early childhood mental health consultations was the highest-ranked #First1KDaysNY proposal
#First1KDays was funded in the 2018/19 budget at $1.45M, increasing to $5.8M in 19/20, with federal match totaling $12M total dollars investment.
NY Medicaid Director Donna Frescatore welcomes the group &amp; talks about why the #first1kdaysny matters so much to the Medicaid program--good experiences in the first years of life prevent lifelong health&amp;other disparities

If you’re interested to know more, join us this Friday at the New York State Oral Health Coalition where @CDHP_ED &amp; I will be talking systems redesign. We can and must do better for all our children &amp; families.
What can we learn from his story? So many systems failed this child &amp; his family. His death was avoidable, preventable. Until we rebuild systems around children and families and not around providers or payment mechanisms, we will continue to have these kinds of outcomes
By the time the appt came, her Medicaid coverage was discovered to have lapsed. The eligibility paperwork was mailed to the homeless shelter where the family was no longer staying.
They all said they were no longer providers in the network. 3 months later her son had an appointment. An oral surgeon took his referral another 6wks later. Surgery was booked for 2 months later.
His mother had just come out of a 6 month fight to get his younger brother dental care—the Medicaid helpline at first couldn’t even find him in the system. Then she called the first 26 dentists who were “approved providers” on the list.
After 2wks &amp; $250k worth of care, he’s moved to another hospital to recover with 6weeks of care. On Feb 25th, he passed away.
Complications force another emergency brain surgery &amp; removal of the abscessed tooth. Bacteria had moved from the tooth infection to his brain.
He complained of a headache Jan 11 2007 at school. Grandma took him to the hospital, where he was given pain meds &amp; no dental referral or follow up. 2 days later, he’s back in the ER for a CAT scan and spinal tap. Diagnosis is meningitis—he’s rushed into emergency brain surgery
Deamonte was 12. He loved asking questions about how things worked and math. He grew up in a low-income family headed by a working mother. They spent time in and out of family shelters around Baltimore.
In Baltimore.Just finished reading this book about the oral health crisis facing our children &amp; low-income adults in our country today. The plural of personal stories is not data, but allow me to tell you the story of Deamonte Driver of Baltimore. https://t.co/oJy7h0jTla

Housing is healthcare, but housing is also education. Without it, children become chronically absent, losing precious days/weeks of instruction. The ed sector cannot do it alone.

“We Were In Power Eight Years” by Ta-Nehisi Coates was by far the best read of 2017. Ruthlessly honest, well-researched, and prose so beautifully strung together by Coates, this book will inform and haunt you. I winced my way into better understanding issues I thought I knew well

@erichoov @jstnchsbrwn Thank you for writing these stories.
Someone very wise once said there isn't a problem we can't solve--but there are problems we lack the political will to solve (thnx @JohnBKing ) I think this is one of them. 8/8 FIN. https://t.co/8hfbWC1Am0
This isn't what our country needs. Students who are enrolling in college--esp. low-income or first-gen students--need the process to work for them. We need to radically rethink how we make students&amp;families apply for aid. We can't continue like this. 7/8 https://t.co/IhKvR67uuY
Last year's FAFSA changes included some timing changes (opening in Oct instead of Jan) and perhaps most critically, the DRT tool went down for a major filing period. The bottom line is that too many low-income students are facing TOUGHER roadblocks along the way 6/8 https://t.co/FCdY1YUTJH
This year, the # of FAFSA verifications skyrocketed, nearly doubling (read more here: https://t.co/hv8quhuDyD) and affecting low-income students more than others. This has serious consequences--low-income students are already at-risk to not enroll successfully  5/8 https://t.co/MvXubWqAqR
Of those that complete the FAFSA, nearly 1 in 3 will be flagged for what is called "FAFSA verification"--a process where students&amp;families have to submit additional documentation for review.Not completing this task results in no aid being released 4/8 https://t.co/faiz87xXhA
I once asked board members (CEO-level executives) to complete the FAFSA to understand its complexity for our kids. Most had to quit by page 2 or had run out of time. They all walked away changed. 3/8 https://t.co/YIAZr529nz
The FAFSA or Free Application for Federal Student Aid is a nearly-universal tool that students&amp;families use to access grants, scholarships, and loans. This is an overly complex process that stalls many students&amp;families from getting to the door of college 2/8 https://t.co/1OzjpiKPJ9
If you give me 4min of your time, I'd like to say a few things about FAFSA verification and its impact on low-income kids. @chronicle has a great article here in case you're interested in going deeper: https://t.co/5PfL7bJqGp

Innovation for student success needs to come from the ground--is the prob. childcare? small dollar grants? class schedules? #CLIMBConference
Smart Q by @DLeonhardt --if dual enrollment isn't quality/implemented with rigor, it's not any different and adds to the complexity of HS
.@MargaretEdu asks if our university produces 2/3rds of all NC teachers--what can we do to improve that resource? #CLIMBConference2017
"The media gives you a lot of credit for small wins" TRUTH. @MargaretEdu &amp; @JohnBKing question how we get to EdEquity as scale
We know what works--can we have the political will to take it to scale? @JohnBKing delivering strong truths at #CLIMBConference2017
“We have to own as a sector-if we deliver a bad product, our customers are going to be mad” -@JohnBKing 🙌#CLIMBConference
Great point abt the paradox of “is college worth it” coverage by journalists that would never let their kids skip the SAT #CLIMBConference
