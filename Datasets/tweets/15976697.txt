I repeat from my column 2 weeks ago on #SmollettsFolly: It's classic manufactured ‚Äúnews.‚Äù Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Blame Trump. Reap clicks. Smears first.

@DGoforth918 Same lab employee worked on another serial rape case involving Ray Mullins, sentenced to 1,015 yrs+6 consec life sentences, whose key evidence, incl rape kits, buccal swabs &amp; clothing, was DESTROYED or LOST.  Same detective &amp; crime lab analyst worked on both cases. That's news.
@DGoforth918 The same employee, a colleague of disgraced Joyce Gilchrist, admits she personally destroyed rape kits, yet was employed for nearly 20 more years. Her work in DH case was challenged by 6 internationally renowned scientists who called for a retrial.	That's news.
@DGoforth918 A crime lab employee admits under oath last month that she personally witnessed destruction of rape &amp; homicide evidence, which was buried in a hole by the river bank. That's news.
@DGoforth918 It's not mind-blowing at all unless you choose not to use your mind. You edit one of the few, truly independent publications in Oklahoma &amp; are missing a massive opportunity to expose criminal injustice that affects bona fide rape survivors &amp; wrongfully convicted people.

@PC1170 @KFAQ @ZellnerLaw KZ: "Basic testing" in Daniel's case was not done. "Unbelievably, no saliva testing done." Jury told false information about vaginal fluid. Multiple violations in collection and potential contamination of evidence.

@RobElgasABC7 @CarmineSabia @chadfelixg @SteveKrak @TMZ @BradThor Same in Colorado, actually. Especially among teens (my perpetually under-dressed kids drive me crazy.)
@RobElgasABC7 @SteveKrak @chadfelixg @TMZ If CWB Chicago's dispatch summary is accurate, "Frank" called 911 at 2:32am, at least 30mins after alleged incident; cops arrived 10mins later.

Among the red flags: 	1) Surveillance vid didn't show anything corroborative	2) She made multiple inconsistent statements to media &amp; police	3) She somehow forgot to tell cops about the phony political motive for the attack	4) Her "injuries" (backwards "B") were obviously fake

Detectives &amp; prosecutors lied. The system failed.
