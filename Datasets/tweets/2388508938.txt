RT @NBCNews: Border agents, working without pay, see large groups of migrants crossing into Arizona https://t.co/crTzXC0BQV
@blueuzi Like to run? What? You blast my spelling! 😂Still doesn’t change the fact it’s profitable. Again what do you do? I’m guessing nothing with hard work involved. Besides sitting on the couch watching the market!
@RickYaeger @greggrunberg And thanks for showing me that neat trick. I am new to using tweeter. Made the account years ago and never used it. So I haven’t figured it all out yet.
@RickYaeger @greggrunberg Haha! Love it! Thanks😜
@MrSauer2 Pelosi says she won’t won’t give a dime. That sir is a fit!
@RickYaeger @greggrunberg So your not going to foster. Hu? Figures you just want to talk but not act!
@RickYaeger @greggrunberg We will never know if we don’t build the wall. There’s no reward with out the risk.
@blueuzi Wow adhd much. I have cattle remember. Hints why I was talking about feed cost! I’ll work on my spelling if you work on your focus problem. I provide Food for Americans so they won’t go hungry. What do you do?
@RickYaeger @greggrunberg Walls are a deterrent. That’s how they work. If traffickers know they can’t get threw ports or over walls they make no money thus not doing it in the first place I would hope. I’m not certain but I think it’s worth spending that little amount of money with a huge budget.
@RickYaeger @greggrunberg In foster homes all around the country. Hey that’s how you can help. Become a foster parent. Every state is in need of them according to dhs. I can think of 2 families of the top of my head that are fostering illegal children right now. There not hard to find. Just look
@HybridPython2 America* can’t spend more money on those thing your mention if ppl flood our borders.
@HybridPython2 Quick question? Have you google earthed the whole boarder to see where there isn’t any fence? I agree we do need to spend more money for the things you have mentioned. But walls work to keep out bad things. And big ports are for allowing ppl in need to come threw! But American...
@RickYaeger @greggrunberg Sure... I think it’s under DHS court docs. in Arizona and New Mexico.
@blueuzi Thanks... I’ll work on that while I run my profitable business. Lol 😂
@RickYaeger @greggrunberg So are you helping these children that are smuggled across the border where there isn’t a wall that are raped and illegals are trafficking? Because in this meeting that’s what Trump was trying to do very passionately.
@blueuzi I have one account with money in it... we’ll say the gov has one account in this example... they trade with Mexico which was coasting the us a lot more money... I have to buy feed in bulk... I save a lot of money... with not paying that extra coast we buy cows and walls
@blueuzi You say hoodwinked... I say do you run your own business? Nope.. ok then. You owe me 57 dollars for that financial advice. 😂😂😂 AND some beer and pizza!
@blueuzi Mexico is paying. Just like when I buy feed for my cows in bulk and I get a huge discount. Well guess what... I go buy more cows. Discounts count when it comes to funding other things like walls.
@aarwheel Thanks! Need help understand it just let me know. 😘 #PelosiShutdown
#Pelosishutdown
@HybridPython2 I agree that the democratic could come to the table and negotiate the deal that he has proposed. Which includes opening the government and many other things the Dems are asking for! They just don’t want a wall and it’s the main they we need!
@MrSauer2 Parents are adults and mature adults negotiate. Trump has an offer on the table and Nacy won’t even consider it. It’s a sad day when Nacy won’t act like a mature adult! Especially when other fellow democratic will come to the table and consider it!
@blixblax1 Actually if you go to my profile you can see my nice pretty fence.
@blixblax1 Yep and a nice big fence. Thats how I keep my calves from being eaten by coyotes and bob cats when there’re first born. But I have less control when I put them out to pasture because those fence have gaps in them. Some get eaten. ☹️ 800 dollar loss!
@ScccageSteve Across the border at a place there’s no fence to be rapped and abused. I totally get why he was so passionate that day in that meeting because he don’t want that to happen any more! I would hope sir if you were President you would feel that strongly to! 🤷🏼‍♀️
@ScccageSteve So are you going to call the America families that have love one killed or have committed suicide from drugs and offer your condolences or will you go help the farmers out that’s land is being vandalized? Let’s not forget the human traffickers that bring children...
@HybridPython2 You say temperature... I say standing up for what is right. 🤷🏼‍♀️
@eslippold Trump needed 10 Dems in the senate to vote yes and they wouldn’t. He passed it in the house I do believe. But not the senate because of the 10 democratic that wouldn’t vote yes.
RT @JudgeJeanine: Ms Pelosi does not have your interest at heart. She is an obstructionist and an embarrassment.
@JohnAndrewThom3 Yes it is! Very heartbreaking!
I often listen/watch these sessions live at https://t.co/uuF3nlLv1u and I find it to be much more informative than the media. I would encourage all to listen tomorrow. I have high hopes that the few Dems we need will flip their vote! https://t.co/TYcfwunPIH

@Mr_JSheffield @HoarseWisperer @realDonaldTrump 😳 thanks!  I had no clue these existed. How did you find out about these tapes? And one more question. You seem like you’ve done some research. Why do you think Donald Trump needs to be impeached? I will not criticize. I will only listen
@OhNoSheTwitnt @CleverTitleTK @realDonaldTrump Like they think we are all white hat wearing kkk because y’all have never met a southern baptist. You’ve never been more wrong! I don’t mind that your Jews! I think it’s your right to believe what you want! On Trump we will agree to disagree though. ❤️
@irishsickboy @OhNoSheTwitnt @realDonaldTrump Sir You just made my point. Walls are logical! We need walls just as much as we need more accurate technological advancement for our border defense strategy. Thanks have a blessed day ❤️

@TGowdySC Please run for President or Vice President when Trumps time is up in 2024! I need you and America’s people need YOU!
@BarriosShelli @realDonaldTrump If you say so but it sounds like to me an excuse to blame Trump in every way you can. That’s far fetched if you ask me. But just my opinion.
@realDonaldTrump That’s great news! Your doing a great job and I believe in you! For all you haters... hate.... 🤷🏼‍♀️ but one day your great great grandchildren will read about this man being the best president the U.S. has had next to Washington! 😏😁🎉👏👍
