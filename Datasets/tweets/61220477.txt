The birth of this relatively strong Democratic election cycle came in the summer of 2017 with the Obamacare repeal effort. That's when Dems took a big generic House ballot lead and really never looked back: https://t.co/0kZLDZcz0k
44% of voters were less likely to vote GOP for Congress because of their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, to only 35% more likely to. Definitely a difference maker in some of these super tight districts that went Dem: https://t.co/0kZLDZcz0k
The bottom line is that voters don't want Republicans touching Obamacare at this point- 58% think it should stay in place to only 36% who want it repealed- and it's 64/29 with independents: https://t.co/0kZLDZcz0k
Voters in these Republican held districts also trusted Democrats more than Republicans on health care costs (48/39) and lower prescription drug pricing (45/36): https://t.co/0kZLDZcz0k
Late claims that GOP was actually the party that would help those with pre-existing conditions fell flat. Democrats were trusted more 51-34 on the issue, 56-23 with independents: https://t.co/0kZLDZcz0k
24% of voters said health care was the single most important issue to them in the election- and among those voters Democrats won 88-10. The clear primary motivating factor among those who voted Democratic yesterday: https://t.co/0kZLDZcz0k
In the 75 GOP held battlegrounds we tested, voters trusted Democrats over Republicans and President Trump on health care 52-44, including 57-35 with independents: https://t.co/0kZLDZcz0k

Only 41% of Mainers support confirming Kavanaugh, to 54% who are opposed.		And 49% say voting to confirm Kavanaugh would make them less likely to vote for Collins in the future, to 39% more likely
Collins' strength has always been her crossover appeal beyond Republicans.		We found that initially, she trailed only 53-26 with Clinton voters.		But that if she voted for Kavanaugh, she would trail 80-9 with Clinton voters.		This vote could be the end of that crossover appeal
Earlier this week we found that Susan Collins led a generic Democrat 42-34 for reelection.		But that if she voted for Kavanaugh, that dropped to a 45-45 tie.
In hypothetical 2020 re-elect she leads generic Dem by 8 points...but if she votes to confirm Kavanaugh that becomes a tie. Moves from trailing only 53-26 with Clinton voters to 80-9 based on hypothetical vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Could be career defining vote https://t.co/FysnCLSZHy

Think the massive amount of data from special elections is a lot more instructive about what's likely to happen this fall than individual generic ballot polls- and certainly that would apply to any poll from us as well as anyone else. Not a knock on CNN
But basically Dems have a 10 point advantage or so nationally and that's been the same for close to a year now. It's natural for there to be an occasional individual survey where it's 15 or 16 points or only 3 or 4 points, but there's never been a real systemic shift from ~+10
We do 30 or 40 polls a week so have tons of data to work with to assess if the political climate is really shifting.		It's not.		It's basically been the same ever since the GOP health care debacle last summer. There might occasionally be a small blip one way or the other...

And speaking to the Democratic enthusiasm edge, even though Manning was down 43-40 overall, she was up 49-39 among 'very excited' voters. That especially matters in NC this year with no Senate or Gubernatorial race at the top of the ticket
The North Carolina Congressional map was drawn to have no competitive districts, but looks like it will have several this year. We recently found Kathy Manning, who won 70% tonight in her primary in NC-13, down only 43-40 to incumbent Ted Budd
2 weeks ago we found that Republicans only had a 46-44 generic ballot lead in that district. Looking like an even better Democratic opportunity now without having to run against an incumbent, and with primary vote turnout confirming a Democratic edge in engagement this year
Worth noting besides Pittenger losing in NC-9...there were 10,000 more Democratic than Republican votes in the primary, another marker of Democratic enthusiasm

The lack of popularity of the tax plan is a big piece of why these districts are all so competitive, as outlined in this memo for @PatriotMajority https://t.co/YCe62eASr9
Democrats could probably win a majority in the House without winning any of these 12 districts. The fact that they are so close in so many of them- and leading among people 'very excited' to vote this year- speaks to some unexpected pick ups in a possible wave election
And in FL-16 Vern Buchanan won 60-40 in 2016. He only leads Democrat David Shapiro 49-37 now, and among the 58% of voters who are 'very excited' to turn out this year, his lead shrinks to 48-44

This survey was sponsored by Protect Our Care: https://t.co/WQpZfOLVKT
Tipirneni won big with independents, and the numbers on health care with them are striking. Only 26% support ACA repeal, 69% say keep it and make necessary fixes. Less likely to vote for Lesko by 35 points because of her support for GOP health care agenda: https://t.co/WQpZfOLVKT
By a 7 point spread voters said Debbie Lesko's support for the Republican health care agenda made them less likely to vote for her- 40% less likely, only 33% more likely: https://t.co/WQpZfOLVKT
AZ-8 provides more evidence of the limited appetite for repealing the Affordable Care Act at this point. Even in heavily GOP district just 41% think best path forward is repeal, 54% say keep ACA and make fixes as necessary: https://t.co/WQpZfOLVKT
Even with Lesko's narrow overall win, voters said they agreed more with Tipirneni on health care 45-43...and that grows to 57-27 with independents: https://t.co/WQpZfOLVKT
Our telephone exit poll in AZ-8 found that once again, health care was a big part of the reason for the Democratic over performance. 58% said it was a very important issue to their vote and they voted Tipirneni 62-37: https://t.co/WQpZfOLVKT

Last month we found Bruce Rauner had a 26/63 favorability rating and trailed JB Pritzker 48-35, and tonight's results suggest Rauner's standing has gotten even worse since then
One very encouraging data point for Democrats- in competitive GOP held IL-12, with 83% reporting, Dems have cast 37,339 votes for Congress compared to only 32,059 GOP votes for Congress. Good harbinger for the fall

One particularly noteworthy health care poll finding in PA-18...voters there support the Affordable Care Act 44-42. That it’s now supported even in Trump +20 districts really speaks to how much things have shifted on that since GOP repeal efforts: https://t.co/1D00GVRY5k

41% of voters said Saccone’s support for GOP health care agenda made them less likely to vote for him to only 28% who said more likely. By contrast 48% of voters said Lamb’s health care positions made them more likely to vote for him, only 27% less likely: https://t.co/1D00GVRY5k

Only 6% of Clinton voters think Trump has 'Made America Great Again,' 93% don't think he has.		75% think Trump is more corrupt than Richard Nixon was.		And 85% think he should be impeached to only 10% who are opposed.
91% of Clinton voters would still like to see Trump's tax returns.		87% think Trump is mentally unbalanced.		By a 93-4 margin they wish Barack Obama was still President
Only 4% of Clinton voters think Trump is honest, 95% don't think he is.		92% outright characterize him as a liar
91% of Clinton voters trust the New York Times, Washington Post, and NBC more than Donald Trump.		90% trust ABC and CBS more than Trump.		88% trust CNN more than Trump
Only 7% of Clinton voters want a wall with Mexico, 91% are opposed.		What 86% of Clinton voters do want is the Dream Act, just 8% are against it
Paul Ryan has an 8/79 approval with Clinton voters.		Mitch McConnell's is 6/77.		Democrats lead 90-5 on the generic House ballot with them
Only 4% of Clinton voters support the GOP tax plan, 82% are opposed.		90% think it will mostly benefit the wealthy and large corporations, just 5% think it will mostly benefit the middle class and small businesses.

So the generic ballot polling on a national level is good for Democrats. And so is all of the district specific polling we're doing. If you're interested in looking at any other districts or checking back on any of these early in 2018: https://t.co/PIFZPFXKFj
And finally in AZ-2 the attempting to move up Martha McSally won 57-43 last year. In various polls before she changed races she was struggling against both Ann Kirkpatrick and Matt Heinz. Even tougher road for GOP in open seat race
In MN-2 Jason Lewis won 47-45 last year. He leads Democratic opponent Angie Craig on a poll we did for Patriot Majority October 4-7
In PA-6 Ryan Costello won 57-43 last year. He leads Democratic opponent Chrissy Houlahan just 45-37 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority October 6-8
In IA-3 David Young won 53-40 last year. He leads a generic Democrat just 44-43 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority October 6-8
These last few polls we'll tweet were done in early October and I think the climate has improved for Democrats since then. It was already pretty good but tax reform has made it even rosier so it may be better for Dems in these places now
Last year in MI-11 the retiring Dave Trott won 53-40. In the race to replace him a generic Democrat ties a generic Republican 42-42 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority October 5-8
Last year in MI-6 Fred Upton won 59-36. He leads a generic Democrat just 42-41 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority November 8-9
Last year in WI-1 Paul Ryan won 65-30. He leads Democratic opponent Randy Bryce just 46-39 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority November 9-10
Last year in TX-31 John Carter won 58-37. He leads Democratic foe MJ Hegar only 46-40 on a poll we did for her campaign November 28-29
Last year in NY-1 Lee Zeldin won 58-42. He leads a generic Democrat only 46-42 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority December 12-13

Last year in FL-18 Brian Mast won 54-43. He leads a generic Democrat only 45-44 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority December 12-13
So that's 25 GOP held districts we've polled where the client chose to release the poll and a Democrat's been ahead. And of course we haven't polled everywhere. 11 other GOP districts we've polled it's close
Last year in WA-8 Dave Reichert who is now retiring won 60-40. In the race to replace him we found a generic Democrat would lead Republican Dino Rossi 43-42 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority October 6-8
Last year in PA-15 Charlie Dent who is now retiring won 58-38. In the race to replace him a generic Democrat leads a generic Republican 44-43 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority October 5-8

Last year in TX-32 Pete Sessions didn't even have a Democratic opponent. He trails a generic Democrat 48-43 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority November 8-9
Last year in TX-7 John Culberson won 56-44. He trails a generic Democrat 49-39 on a poll we did for Patriot Majority November 8-10

Donald Trump might not like what he wakes up to Christmas morning- only 30% of voters think he's on Santa's 'Nice List,' 57% think he's on the 'Naughty List' https://t.co/IhWejPMDBc

Kwanzaa...not so unifying. Clinton voters see it positively 59/7, but Trump voters only do 35/26.		The big divide among Trump voters for Hanukkah versus Kwanzaa sentiments makes it clear what group is really causing the 'economic anxiety'		https://t.co/IhWejPMDBc
Voters are pretty on board with Hanukkah too. 66/9 favorability overall, seen favorably by 67% of Clinton voters and 63% of Trump voters: https://t.co/IhWejPMDBc
Christmas is one of the things that truly unites us. 83% favorable, 9% unfavorable overall, 86% favorable with Trump voters and 81% favorable with Clinton voters: https://t.co/IhWejPMDBc
The last couple years have destroyed our spirit. In 2012 52% of voters said they believed in Santa Claus, only 45% said they didn't. Now only 22% believe in Santa Claus, and 69% say they don't: https://t.co/IhWejPMDBc
A slight plurality of Trump voters though- 42/38- do still think there's a 'War on Christmas' so he will have to fight the war harder in year 2 to keep the base totally happy: https://t.co/IhWejPMDBc
Only 25% of voters now think there's a 'War on Christmas' to 52% who don't think there is. In 2012 47% thought there was a 'War on Christmas' and only 40% didn't. Signature accomplishment of Trump Year One: https://t.co/IhWejPMDBc
So it's clear on the holiday nomenclature issues who the real ❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️ are
70% of Clinton voters don't care whether you say Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays. 23-7 preference for 'Merry Christmas'		Only 25% of Trump voters don't care whether you say Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays. 66-9 preference for 'Merry Christmas' 		https://t.co/IhWejPMDBc

Only 37% think Trump has delivered on his core promise to 'Make America Great Again,' 57% say he hasn't.		And for the first time we find a majority of voters in favor of impeachment- 51% support it, to 42% who are opposed: https://t.co/jAi9td8KkJ

Voters wish Barack Obama was still President instead of Donald Trump 56/39: https://t.co/jAi9td8KkJ
Voters even trust Fox News more than Trump 33/28 because if you make Clinton voters choose between the two, they pick Fox over Trump by 33 points: https://t.co/jAi9td8KkJ

The tax bill is making things even worse for Congressional Republicans- 29% support it, 49% are opposed. Voters are less likely to vote for someone who supports it next year by 23 points: https://t.co/jAi9tdqlch
Democrats continue to have a double digit lead on the generic Congressional ballot- 51/40 this month. Republican leadership is incredibly unpopular- Paul Ryan approval is 23/58, Mitch McConnell approval is 13/61: https://t.co/jAi9td8KkJ

Only 45% of Trump voters say they would disapprove of him sexually harassing women. 22% say they would approve of him doing so and 32% have no opinion. Reminiscent of his shooting someone on 5th Avenue comment in regards to base: https://t.co/jAi9td8KkJ
Trump voters (71/14) and Clinton voters (57/29) agree that Franken needed to resign. But Trump voters (12/83) don't think Trump needs to resign. Clinton voters think he needs to 86/10: https://t.co/jAi9td8KkJ

In Apex, North Carolina, a historically GOP leaning suburb, Pat McCrory's former Press Secretary was a candidate for Town Council. He finished last in a progressive sweep in the kind of place Dems never would have won a decade ago
Almost everything reported in Charlotte, NC. Democrat Vi Lyles leads 58-42, will be first African American female Mayor. Dems only won Mayoral race by 6 points in 2013, 4 points in 2015.
This was a good thread
Fayetteville, North Carolina is largest city in state with GOP Mayor. He is down 59-41 with 95% of precincts reporting to African American Democratic City Councilman Mitch Colvin. Another big win for Team Blue tonight. Good job @NCDemParty
A quarter of election day vote in in Charlotte, Lyles still up 62-38. Winning election day vote by double digits in addition to massive early vote lead. Over
Democrat Colvin now leads 60-40 with 2/3rds of precincts reporting in this race. This office will be a flip from GOP to Dems. Biggest city in NC with GOP Mayor
We found Comstock down 48-39 to a generic Democrat last month https://t.co/eM85ABdKYW
Democrat Lyles up 62-38 in Charlotte with about 10% of precincts reporting. Winning election day modestly to go with huge early vote advantage. https://t.co/ReLeUzkjAZ
Shout to everyone who played the week before the election Ralph Northam is the worst candidate in history Democrats will suck forever blame game. Have a blessed day
In Fayetteville NC Dem Mitch Colvin leads GOP incumbent Nat Robertson 67-32 in early vote. Biggest NC city with GOP Mayor
Vi Lyles (D) leads Charlotte early vote 64-35. We did several private polls on race and found her up double digits- don't think it will be close

We haven't polled VA statewide in a month but based on all that, think Northam is more likely to over perform than under perform tomorrow
We've already seen evidence from primary that Ds in VA are more excited this year, and @ElectProject has seen signs of that in early vote
In these hyper partisan times there aren't going to be *that* many Clinton/Gillespie or Trump/Northam voters so enthusiasm to vote is big
But in the primaries for Governor in June, 543,000 Democrats voted and only 366,000 Republicans voted. Very unusual
Last year 1,025,617 voted in GOP primary for President, 785,190 voted in Democratic primary even in year where Dems in VA did fine in fall
Republicans almost always turn out at a much higher rate in primaries than Democrats in VA.
Continue to think the most underrated data point on Virginia is what the primary said about comparative enthusiasm...

So Dems want someone young and new, but right now who they know and like are old and old. Plenty of time for this to sort itself out 😜
Warren fav 59/13, Franken 44/15. Booker, Cuomo, Castro, Brown, Gillibrand all have less than 50% name rec even with core Dem voters

So in general Democrats want a 2020 candidate who is a younger, fresher face. But...
Only 25% of Dems want a candidate in 2020 who has run for President before, 41% want someone who has never run before, 34% not sure
Dems want a younger candidate in 2020- 57% want one under 60, 77% want one under 70. Only 8% want one in 70s, 15% not sure

@bepryor awesome! Been quite an eventful first fall for you there
@bepryor does that mean you get to go
Keep Pounding
The Moral Monday movement didn't let voters forget what McCrory had done. It was a long game. For us in NC a very long game. But it paid off
And I think the lesson for progressives in Trump's America is push back hard. Stay visible. Capture the public's attention.
HB2 might have been final straw that killed McCrory's reelection chances, but he was already very 'sick.' And that started almost from day 1
The Moral Monday protesters were getting arrested...and they were popular! 49/35 favorability rating in August 2013. Public appreciated it
By July McCrory was no longer seen as a 'different kind of Republican.' 40/49 approval. By September it was down to 35/53.
Moral Monday movement forced all these issues to stay in the headlines. Gave media no choice but to keep covering it, make sure voters knew
Only 33% of voters in state wanted to reduce early voting, only 21% wanted to get rid of straight ticket voting. McCrory went along with it
Only 29% of voters in the state wanted to cut off unemployment benefits for tens of thousands in the state. McCrory went along with it.
Only 30% of voters in the state wanted to get rid of the Earned Income Tax Credit. McCrory went along with it
73% of voters opposed guns in bars. 69% opposed guns on college campuses. 65% opposed guns in parks. McCrory went along with it
80% of voters opposed sneaking in abortion legislation by combining it with motorcycle safety. McCrory went along with it
56% of voters wanted Medicaid Expansion to move forward, only 26% opposed it. McCrory opposed it
McCrory let himself be defined by a wide variety of unpopular legislation, and the Moral Monday movement made sure everyone knew about it
But by July of 2013, 6 months after taking office, McCrory had a negative approval rating, and he never really recovered. What happened?
McCrory won by 12 points in 2012, even as Romney won by only 2 statewide. Won independents 2:1, 25% of Dems. Really could claim a mandate
But the seeds of McCrory's defeat really were planted by the Moral Monday Movement all the way back in summer of 2013. It was a long game
Only 30% of voters in NC supported HB2 and voters said by 12 points it made them less likely to vote for him. Veto it, maybe get reelected
There will be temptation to largely blame McCrory's loss on HB2 and certainly that's a big piece of it.
The long view of why Pat McCrory lost, and what it means for progressives in Trump's America: https://t.co/sX72gfHCUO

So calm down, don't let polls drive you crazy, and GOTV have a blessed day
But this was never a double digit race. This was also never a tied race. It's been a lean Hillary race and it still is today
There are some states- FL, NC, NH- where she's maybe doing a little better and some- OH, IA- where she's doing a little worse
Our polling all year has found a race pretty similar to 2012- Hillary up by similar margin to Obama's win, maybe a little better
@BillDavisNYC think you're at the mercy of our clients deciding to release stuff we do for them the rest of the way. Sure there will be some
