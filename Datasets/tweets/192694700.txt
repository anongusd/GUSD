So lucky. You will rarely ever get a second chance to salvage a season. Please take advantage Rockets.
All armchair coaching aside, Howard is actually killing it. This is how you want your star player to play in crunch time.
Holy crap! Baseline drop step and a foul! Howard probably checked twitter during a break from the action.
At least he got to the line.
Oh Howard takes the inside again? I guess he just doesn't have a left hand?
I'm not an expert basketball analyst. I just play one on twitter.
RT @JasonCFriedman: And from the role players perform better at home files, I submit the name Thomas Robinson.
Even if help side D comes, Howard has Lopez on his back and is a foot away from the basket. Go up strong and get fouled.
Lopez definitely cheating middle every time. Dwight has baseline drop step if he wants it. Don't really understand why he doesn't take it.
RT @getnickwright: Howard block, Harden layup sequence,,, go ahead and book mark that.

The weird thing about college running is that, just when you start to get good, you also get a degree and are expected to get a "real job."
@saymybehm Kolaches are just a bread roll with some kind of meat. Just like every food ever is just made up of its component ingredients.
