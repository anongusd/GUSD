@MLGACE @Pistola_nV doesn't even matter how good the game is. Could be shitty
@MLGACE @Pistola_nV there's not enough people around to be popular you have to get the casuals into competitive that's why 1-50 h3 worked
@MLGACE @Pistola_nV no same concept as when reach changed at the end. No 1-50 no success simple as that. That's what keeps ppl coming back
Is there still competitive halo?
@xSaLoT H6 was incredible.. They had their last chance withH5
@xSaLoT they see what happens when you don't do those things. Halo is dead forever. I don't think it's possible to come back now even if
@xSaLoT they had their last chance on h5. They heard what people wanted (ranks like h2/3, no sprint, etc.) and they didn't do it and now
@xSaLoT sounds good
@xSaLoT I have work at 4 but can play before that or after 11

@FisForFurby more followers than Brett Favre @Favre4Official @OpTic_NaDeSHoT
@FisForFurby because twitter they follow simply because they know the person.. YouTube they subscribe sometimes because of the videos
@FisForFurby ok YouTube is different I meant twitter
@FisForFurby I'm just sayin there are like pro nfl players that are extremely well known that have less followers than nadeshot
@FisForFurby ya there followers are probably high because they know how to use twitter right and tweet a lot and get tons of retweets n stuf
@FisForFurby ya.. He has over 400,00 followers and a million youtube subscribes.. That's more than a lot of famous people
Nadeshot is entering the danger zones of being like legit famous
@CrsKiLLa @akaTrojan dawg? U really gonna suck up to that fag

@barbaraok choices*
@barbaraok then we should just let them kill them because they stole from them and they feel like killing them
@barbaraok if we go by the logic only people affected get to make the voices then when someone wants to kill someone for stealing from them
@barbaraok @LourdesIsBack  not feelings, not where the baby is gonna go. All that simply matters first and foremost is being alive
@barbaraok @LourdesIsBack @RiskyLiberal no but the baby is and that's what matters.. Nothing is more important than life
@barbaraok @LourdesIsBack @RiskyLiberal I agree the goal is to get more of them adopted
@LourdesIsBack @barbaraok @RiskyLiberal it's funny because u were born and I'm sure u wouldn't say I should have been murdered at birth
@LourdesIsBack @barbaraok @RiskyLiberal exactly it's their choice but u don't give them a choice if u murder them..
@LourdesIsBack sorry but not even u get to choose for the babies life, that's their choice whether they wanna live or not.
@LourdesIsBack it is my buissness when babies are being killed because there is a fault and we can't figure out what to do with babies
@barbaraok @LourdesIsBack @RiskyLiberal so I guess when we have trouble with stuff the best option is just to kill people..

People don't like halo 4 but they still stick with it.. Halo 3 is different there is no reason to stay if it gets boring
The second people lose interest in halo 3 is the second halo officially dies, that's why it was a bad move to go to halo 3.

@Scarface_Nj awk adambark
@Scarface_Nj meeee I got a fresh one also but I'm a 22
@PolarisShines it's like 20 cents
Maybe there will be more h4 tourneys and no one will go so I will go and take home the 10k due to no show. Hopefull
Mark my words, switching to halo 3 for agl is what will make halo go flatline until halo 5
@TasinTwiTcH we need 1 we got 7
Anyone wanna do h3 customs msg adambark
@BrandonDefy uh... We are screwed and I thought we were friends
A little curious as to what people will complain about now that the game is good
Does anyone wanna play halo 3 dubs with me and is a somewhat low rank? It's impossible to get someone that's not an idiot on ur team
Can anyone confirm to me that 343 is making halo 5 and not bungie
@Insanityy_X I don't think so. 343 announced halo for Xbox one at e3.. If bungie is though that would be good
@Insanityy_X ???
@Insanityy_X I know but they r just stratum and not supporting them won't help halo 5.. But I agree I would rather play halo 3
It doesn't feel right leaving 343 (our future only hope) hanging to dry with h4 after all they have done to improve the game and learn
@FisForFurby ya a bunch of people r mad but majority want it
@FisForFurby they basically said by votes and everyone wants halo 3
@FisForFurby crazy. I'm In love with halo again

@ArenaGaming_ sounds like u just want money.. So much for saving halo and tryin to help halo 4.. I thought that's what u guys were about
@ArenaGaming_ I want league of legends for agl10k
@FisForFurby eh
@Dashboarrd lol
@FisForFurby if I find money to buy it maybe but it's not worth it to me to start over and learn everything from strath screw that
@FisForFurby I don't even own a single cod and haven't played bops 2 other than at a friends house, I probably wouldn't switch Id just b don
@FisForFurby ya I am the last person in the world to switch but if this happens I'm done probably.. That's so messed up
@ArenaGaming_ u need to do do a RT for h4 and fav for h3 then also to make it fair
@ArenaGaming_ not gonna ever succeed if you keep acting like a 2 year olds.. Mlg would never do that
@ArenaGaming_ can't just keep changing shit.. If u say agl 10k will be h4 then do it.. U will never be successful if ur not professional
Where is this voting for agl10k I want to vote for h4
@Dashboarrd ur playing with throw down?
H3 better not be at agl10k I will be mad lol. I ain't about to just give up h4 I didn't play allthis time for nothin

@MetalTune how do I restore from backup on iTunes lol
@MetalTune what do u mean never even changed it! And I didn't steal it it was an accident and it was on my friends iPod lol
@MetalTune and sold my iPod
@MetalTune got an iPhone
@MetalTune oh.. And I want adambark and sky back.. They are both gone now
@Venom121LB what is the site for fltron?
@MetalTune also I need to get in touch with someone from @pankaku who do u know who works for them?
@MetalTune yes, we need to get a match in sometime soon
@MetalTune u wanna match up sometime today to see if u still got it:)
@MetalTune @Venom121LB maybe
@MetalTune it was def someone from the normal top 20
@MetalTune I should have won most games if I would have been trying harder but he was really good, so I thought maybe it was u lol
@MetalTune his name was Vernom, he was beating me a lot.. I should have been winning most games but I was playin dumb cause I don't care lol
@MetalTune did I just play u in light bike on another account?
Just waited like 5 min of my life cause I wouldn't leave my car to the end of the song.. I hate free bird
@joshua_menke hey an idea for a rank system could be similar to a game called light bike online on the App Store.. U should try it out
@eSportsHaloNews @SpartanTheDogg ehh
@SpartanTheDogg def would be.. And I still think there is a skill gap, just not a ridiculous one like h3
@SpartanTheDogg @puskab @eSportsHaloNews @ArenaGaming_ agreed but it's not half as bad as reach and ppl still played reach #money #mlg
@puskab @eSportsHaloNews @SpartanTheDogg @ArenaGaming_ I haven't heard ppl complain about sprint hardly ever it's always describe and ranks
@TasinTwiTcH me too

@HaloScrimsRT then I would say what tournament website
Not gettin enough sleep does affect how u play halo.. Anyone says otherwise they r wrong.. At least for me it's that way
Can't hold my controller right and it bugs the crap outa me
@ArenaGaming_ @SmiteGame @HiRezStudios here is a question what happened to inside agl and the 50 links posted
@ArenaGaming_ what is on the channel right now?
@Scarface_Nj playing halo and skippin out hangin with friends all the time just to play halo.. Super frustrating
@Scarface_Nj if h5 isn't good I literally don't know what I will do.. I'm not about to be ok with wasting my entire high school career
I'm literally so mad with the state of halo and stuff that I'm contemplating starting my own halo league..
Does ANYONE know if ther will be agl events after the one after Indy.@Ninjashyper @ArenaGaming_ @MrBillyLutz @812hzgaminggum @iGotUrPistola

What's the competitors twitters for this lol thing
Popular people with a soft heart/respect for others says a lot.. Totally goes against society
@TasinTwiTcH dang that's insane
@TasinTwiTcH 1 million first place?? Is it being streamed?
@TasinTwiTcH for what? A big tourney?
@Dashboarrd @HaloScrimsRT @masoncobb lmao neighbor?? Out of all the pros they hired neighbor lol.. We r gonna see like naked girls in h5
@HaloScrimsRT @masoncobb what happened? I keep hearing bout it
@Rey_Side @GoBeyondEnt @masoncobb @HaloWaypoint go beyond tweets don't usually troll I don't think
I actually think h5 will be really good. 343 learned alot of mistakes an r obv willing to change and have put a lot of good ppl in place
@joshua_menke I really will pay u that though, swear lol
@joshua_menke sry I just wanted u to hear that so bad, I want the right ppl to know what the glories of h2/h3 were an why they were tht way
Everyone should tweet the multiplayer halo waypoint team members and tell them we want ranks like h3 for h5...That would be cool
@joshua_menke also sorry for spamming but h3s was good cause even though u could rank down it still showed overall best rank achieved.
@joshua_menke I will literally pay u 200 dollars from my checking if u remake an identical or very close h3 rank 1-50 for h5, swear

@Gamers4Christ not saying your wrong, I'm just questioning it
@Gamers4Christ ya, but shouldn't it be you ask, believing, then you will receive it, not command it because u have confidence?

@RNX_IntaKe U go to eiu? I live in charleston
Halo is pointless unless u r able to get on late at night.. No one ever plays customs throughout the day or morning
@IMiKWeN most people won't stand up and admit this cause some people think different. But it's 100 percent true

@StrykersFADED @ArenaGaming_ they should have thougt of that in advance. Gotta think everything trough before u plan something big like that
anyone from IL know if @theRoyBorg played soccer for Urbana? I may have played against him/my friends. I think he played soccer atleast.
@ArenaGaming_ if u announce an event in a location you need to keep it.. Very unprofessional to change it and ask people what they think
@Scarface_Nj what??? U done gaming?
@DiaBROlical @Scarface_Nj @GH057ayame @Psylincee I don't understand how that makes sense but oh well

@MrLuLuFOURs still.. 2 people don't make a lobby
There is never anyone on for customs anymore
@DiaBROlical @Scarface_Nj @GH057ayame @Psylincee and that is push the hallways.. Those r the only options or u get screwed. No diversity
@DiaBROlical @Scarface_Nj @GH057ayame @Psylincee yep.. And also on serious note there are not more than like 1 option to do when u spawn
@Psylincee @Scarface_Nj @GH057ayame ya but I suck at dispatch so dispatch is worse

@WernerWolffy makes sense. I suck at ffa anyway
@TAPROVENFACT that's what it usually turns into later in the day after I'm pissed at gettin raped lol
There is no drive to play when u get on every time and get raped
Only time I ever get good at halo seems to be right before I leave for a trip, all other time I suck big ones
@Psylincee @PGN_Suspector MSg adambark.. Friends list is full

@KidPham_ because that was a crazy series and competitive halo is ridiculously fun to watch
Holy **** agl8 is trending worldwide
Starting to wonder how many top players actually use adderal and if it really helps.
That was a good interview
@TAPROVENFACT ryanoob is always someone good to interview cause when u ask him a question how did u push outa the base he will explain
@TAPROVENFACT I know that's how he is and I think someone who can take an interview 100 percent serious makes it look more professional
RT @F0RMAL: An angry Ambush is not what ya want. See you all tomorrow
Should've interviewed someone better. Kid is crazy and not serious
RT @AnthonyMagNetiC: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.
RT @TomRyanOGRE2: .@LxthuL are you the goat?!
@F0RMAL good sportsmanship unlike most
RT @F0RMAL: Great games, they played amazing. They deserve it
Omfg I'm not joking everyone get on the stream this is the most exciting series I've ever seen.. That comeback

It's more difficult to get a custom than it is to get better

@aNoobNextdoor I can get on anytime lemme know when your on

#Halo4GC
So what is this rtx crap and what am I hearing about the finals? Is this the 500k finals already? I just heard about it and now it's over?
Think goodness for @quinndelhoyo and a couple others @HaloWaypoint for listening to the community or we would be utterly screwed right now
@Chiig in place of skyline and dispatch
@SaUcEySOARS to be honest who cares about one event that's an FFA in which a couple pros r gonna win.
@TylerHoyt no
RT @F0RMAL: RT if you want to see Halo 4 at @MLG Columbus in November! @MrAdamAp @MLGSundance

@_Nintage @YouTube when
@_Nintage @YouTube still gonna make me a montage?
@ZacTheRev @suddoth1 mighty confidence
@Cahlibur @UMGGAMING @ArenaGaming_ it was not meant to be taken that seriously..
@Swainoo @UMGGAMING @ArenaGaming_ was a joke lol
@josh_par @UMGGAMING @ArenaGaming_ was a joke dude
@UMGGAMING @ArenaGaming_ I understand and it's better for halo but it's in my blood for cod and halo to not get along
@ArenaGaming_ @UMGGAMING screw cod
Someone inv me not lookin to play mini slayer the entire night
RT @HaloScrimsRT: 3 months ago we were begging for developer support and Halo tournaments. Now we have both. Be appreciative. #Halo
@Scarface_Nj u r too good to quit
RT @AnthonyMagNetiC: Of course Virgin Gaming is running the FFA tournament. Of course the qualifying system is shit. Why does VG have right…
No sprint and no adrift and dispatch sounds like the greatest thing imaginable..takin out the two worse maps and back to the old feel
The fact that sprint is being considered taken out is scary.. This game could actually be good maybe
@Scarface_Nj gotcha
@Scarface_Nj @HK_JuicyFruit noooooooooo u have to stay with halo
@MLGSundance I love you.. Thanks for the hope
@MLGSundance @RyRyReflex joking or not there is hope lol
@eBash_Tourneys could u dm?
@eBash_Tourneys ok I was jw because if there were already 4 I wouldnt stress out and try to put together a quick team so u can still have it
@eBash_Tourneys How many signed up so far? Gonna get enough for the halo this Saturday?
@WernerWolffy @cizzzatskazizam cizzats didn't want to go before cause distance or something but if he does I will go with u 2
@WernerWolffy maybe if I get a team I don't have a team so probably not
It is tremendously better but it doesn't remind me of h2 or 3 in any way shape or form.. But I still like h4 and like the direction its goin
Don't wanna be Debby downer but I don't agree with people who say h4 is so much better and feels like halo again..I don't think so
RT @TreyTri: @SaUcEySOARS @TylerHoyt Idc what maps we play on. Get sprint out.

@UGC_pro will there be another micro event soon? If so when?
Someone stream don't make me go watch cod @NinjaRTB @NTN_RyaNoob
That use to be halo.......
RT @GGoofy: RT for Scarlett Johansson. Fav for Jessica Alba		:-D
Doesn't like watching film for some reason @FisForFurby
Now accepting applications for a halo buddy. Some1 to play with me every day, go over film with, almost like a teammate. Since @FisForFurby
What's the cod stream?
@HK_JuicyFruit halo 5 needs to be good on release
Even though I'm prolly not good enough to place what I want... I will be in the future and still would like to chance to compete at mlg
@HK_JuicyFruit so dumb... Probably never gonna get the opportunity to be at one and compete like a lot of people
And probably will never pick it back up if the chance comes cause the game is crap right now
Crap just has to happen in my time before I get to go compete at events.. Mlg drops halo.. Shortly after I can start attending events.
RT @AhMazeIn: . @VG_Carl Not have a company buy the rights to the game and let it sit and do nothing with it.
RT @DrPepperGaming: @fatalc3p @EDWSnip3down @GH057ayame @Scandhi @theRoyBorg Maybe we can start a movement to get #HALO back in #MLG for 20…
How many team passes sold for cod aneheim
@FoxyControllers How much do custom controllers cost?
@Stephh32409 I hope
Do you think halo will ever be back on the circuit? Idk with the way cod is elevating in numbers even if virgin doesn't have rights anymore
I would just like to say mlg has been trending all day..And mlg is taking things to the next level.. I really wish halo was still on circuit
@Cahlibur lol that would not be fun
@Livlikegod lol nooooo
Just lost 4 followers nice
If I'm not fully focused I suck bad at this game
Holy crap nadeshot has 200k followers.......
Mlg trendin in twitter
@SQ_BoomDigital @SaUcEySOARS whatev
New schedule- wake up at 2, 2-4 swimming at pool, 4-10 halo, 10-4in morning lookin up stuff on Internet/twitter. The Best
Never understood why people with like 50 friends wouldn't accept a friend request.. Doesn't mean u have to play with em all the time
@SaUcEySOARS nope.. Should never be compared to h3... No ranks for a start
@The_WOAT @Impact_DKarma true
@Impact_DKarma u already spent 30k?
@Livlikegod I try to.. Spawning I only think about when I'm in certain spots on map so u can't count that.. For example if They r 3 dead
@Livlikegod lol
If I could sit down 1 day with pro and see what they r thinkin every step of the game.. Guarantee I could figure this crap out easy
@Livlikegod and rest just sittin in a spot thinking wtf do I do now and where do I push/when lol
@Livlikegod ya usually bout 50 percent my brain power in game is thinking where teammates r to push/help out. 15 callouts, 15 where spawnin,
@Livlikegod gonna try a lot of new stuff
Bout to go ham soon.. Gettin a strict schedule
@Livlikegod thx.. Got a lot of work to do still though
@Livlikegod I feel like I just keep doing the same crap though and not changing anything in the way I play
What's best way to get better in your opinion? Film? Constantly playing? Watching streams?
Is str8 rippin came back&gt; just the name would be cool to hear again.. Would also like to hear triggers down at tourneys
All this talk of @TsquaredMLG comin back.. If he is back.. Things r startin to get good for halo
RT @F0RMAL: I don't care which teams form, I'm just glad old pros are coming back to play.
RT @F0RMAL: Whether or not we win or lose, Halo is showing signs of life, which is always a positive.
If it weren't for a couple thousand.. There are almost as many people on halo reach as there are halo 4..... That's a sad thing
@SQ_BoomDigital I enjoy lobby warrioring and listening to music more than anything lol

@EDWSnip3down is on a totally different level with snipe
Insane @EDWSnip3down

@HaloWaypoint thank you for listening to the community an making so many improvements since halo 4 first came out. Excited for the next halo
I would miss this game.. Sounds insane
If anyone needs a last minute 4th for umg lemme know
@My_Tail np lol
@My_Tail def. get what u sayin now... Makes sense
@TwinSavioR Come back to halo
@My_Tail and spreading the word separate from implementing it into stuff.. But rather doing it 1 on 1 in just a personal conversation
@My_Tail ya I think I know what your saying and think I agree. They should be gamers who are Christians not christian gamers and
Sorry for all the tweets lolz
@My_Tail who ruin it for everyone
@My_Tail Christians are people which means they are all different... I would never force anyone to my religion.. It's just certain people
@My_Tail  and u can't judge ALL christians saying they shove their religion down people throats
@My_Tail some things u just have to deal with.. If it bugs u that much to see a post or two on twitter or something then u get annoyed easy
@My_Tail ok well it bothers me hearing about all the gay stuff but u don't hear me complaining
@My_Tail there so u can't say it has no business there
@My_Tail it's an opinion dying it has no business with people playing video games.. Obviously Christians believe that it does have business
@My_Tail again, it doesn't affect u at all idk why u keep saying that.. U don't have to join if u don't want an that's an opinion saying
@My_Tail and it doesn't count as murdering people because they come back to life lol
@My_Tail they arent forcing people into their lobbies its peoples option. Just the same as me telling u my opinion on gay rights or somethin
(2/2) supposed to love everyone, so there is no need for all the hate on gays... #commonmisconceptionchristiansmake
(1/2)If a Christian tells you they hate someone cause they are gay, ignore em cause they don't know their own religion, Christians are
@My_Tail how is that too far? They can do what they want. Doesn't affect you in any way
People that play halo have such big egos for some reason.. Everyone thinks their hot stuff
@SerSpenny @HK_JuicyFruit @FisForFurby @Chiig what's funny?
@SerSpenny when?
@HK_JuicyFruit @eBash_Tourneys @BravoMLG ya skyline sucks
@eBash_Tourneys @BravoMLG don't need it for onyx

Most Christians that speak out are crazy or seem crazy so everyone just takes what they say as a joke
Most religious leaders today are hypocrites.. Search the scriptures yourself if you want to know the truth.
The reason people take religion as a joke is cause society makes it a joke. Don't be like everyone else find the truth yourself.

@_Nintage you should look up bible prophecy sometime.. It's very interesting.. Dave hunt has some good stuff on YouTube
Christian, Muslim, atheist, or whatever, you should have an open mind to listen to others and make your decision with reason.. My opinion
So many ignorant atheist who think they are the greatest minds on earth.. Have an open mind please

@CptAnarchy @MLG I understand
@CptAnarchy @MLG it's not about the money
@CptAnarchy that includes you
RT @CptAnarchy: Halo 4 competitions would be 100x better if all the pro's came out the wood works. So many peeps hiding o_0
Super annoying playing a week straight and good. Then one day u just start playin bad and it's like u lost it again
In desperate need of a personal trainer. Can't keep playing this game doing the same thing and feeling like I'm not getting any better

@_Nintage yep, it's a small event so it's 2 days
@_Nintage tommorow
@StrykersFADED that just ruined my day.. Nothing to do now
@StrykersFADED oh duh, forgot the smaller ones r only 2 days
Anyone know what time the stream is up?

@StrykersFADED eu settings is what I'm gomna play
@StrykersFADED ya, I haven't played it yet though
Can't wait to try 4sk when I get off work
@_Dashb0ard didn't say adding maps would be bad but oh well.
@_Dashb0ard no way dude, I could still play h3 all day if people still played
@StrykersFADED @_Dashb0ard I do enjoy it but we got a long way to go for halo 5 if we want it to be big. Got to get the changes now

@_Dashb0ard I like it also but I'm not addicted to it like I was h3 and playing 8 hours a day lol
@_Dashb0ard 4sk, no sprint, good maps
@_Dashb0ard with small changes and stuff.. As the long as the actuall game is different and some of the features stay the same- 1-50 in game
@_Dashb0ard Different than the other games hasn't worked.. I don't think anyone would complain with a good game similar to h2/h3 with small
4sk won't change hardly anything to the game, it's still gonna be a bad game, it needs completely redone to be like the other halos
@ArenaGaming_ now do a RT for 5sk
There is no way agl7 passes will sell out
Anyone know what the last event saucy soars competed at?
Gettin a laptop for graduation, gonma start streaming this summer hopefully
