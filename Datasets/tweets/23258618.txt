The Congressional #Diabetes Caucus is circulating a letter that demonstrates support for the Special Diabetes Program (SDP), which funds critical #T1D research. Renewing the SDP is one of @JDRF’s top legislative priorities &amp; this letter is an important first step.
Last year, the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor system was cleared as the first iCGM, and @JDRF is currently funding @Tidepool_org to develop the first FDA-regulated #insulin delivery app: https://t.co/hpLqvWnZLr
The FDA’s clearance of a new type of insulin pump is another step forward in @JDRF's Open Protocol Initiative to give people with #T1D greater control over their insulin devices, and more freedom to choose the diabetes technologies that work best for them.
The @US_FDA has cleared the first interoperable insulin pump! Congrats to @TandemDiabetes on this #iPump classification, which means people with #T1D can tailor their diabetes management to individual device preferences. Thank you to @US_FDA.	https://t.co/C4RXk92A9i

In May, @JDRFadvocacy went to the White House to advocate for access to affordable #insulin. The mtg. was featured in a PBS @NewsHour story regarding pharmacy benefit managers &amp; prescription drug costs, including the role of PBMs in sharing drug rebates: https://t.co/8L1iSZMtf2
.@JDRF continues to advocate for affordable insulin - you can too by telling your health insurance company to pass on the drug rebates they receive to their members: https://t.co/RbVe53xPPP #Coverage2Control https://t.co/JY4HuLIPQA
Artificial pancreas (AP) systems help people with #T1D manage the disease &amp; avoid complications that lead to higher healthcare costs. Help us tell Congress that all people with T1D deserve access to the latest devices, including #APsystems ACT NOW: https://t.co/yLIv0nxQ7R

Did you see our #livetweeting of the #Diabetes 101 briefing hosted by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus this AM? Catch up: read our feed
Q: What can people do to fight #diabetes?		A: Public awareness, get involved in research and volunteer.
Dr. Ratner: Most importantly, #insulin is not a cure. We must develop new and better treatments on the way to a #T1D cure
Follow up on last question: There has been an increase across the board in autoimmune responses; peanut allergies, etc., not just in #T1D
Q: Why is there an increase in #T1D?		A: Unknown. Likely something in the environment that triggers autoimmune attack
On to the Q&amp;A portion of the #Diabetes 101 Briefing hosted by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus
Dr Judy Regensteiner: #Diabetes costs the US $245 billion annually
Dr. Robert Ratner-There's a reason the #diabetes caucus is the biggest caucus on the Hill: so many people are personally touched by diabetes
Dr. Kowalski: The SDP is resulting in research outcomes and will keep fueling the work towards curing, treating and preventing #T1D
Dr. Kowalski: Thanks to #Congress and the #Diabetes Caucus, the SDP has been able to fund the #NIH and further #T1D research and treatments
Dr. Kowalski: 'The artificial pancreas #APP is the next step in #diabetes care'
Dr. Kowalski: '#Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, kidney disease and is a serious burden on people with the disease &amp; their family'
Dr. Kowalski: #T1D has long term consequences of high blood sugars, but short term consequences of low blood sugars #JDRF
Dr Kowalski : 'There is an increasing incidence of #T1D in people under the age of 5 and over 30'
Dr Aaron Kowalski is currently presenting at the #Diabetes 101 briefing hosted by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus #UpdatingOurLegislators
