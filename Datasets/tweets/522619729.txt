@RandPaul This stand seems admirable on its face but it is an example If why Republicans don‚Äôt know how to win. It‚Äôs why Democrats have gained a huge foothold on power over the last 40 years.
@RandPaul Look at the content of the EO vs the process to see the difference. Is it abusive, worthless or meaningful. Are we looking out for what is in the best interest of the country and its citizens or is it frivolous.
@SimonSwagg316 @RandPaul There are many other reasons but here‚Äôs another. Nothing will stop Dems from from using EO and it will have nothing to do with what Republicans did while in power.
@SimonSwagg316 @RandPaul Additionally if we had a wall we would reduce drug, trafficking and illegal guns in illegal hands reducing crimes that are preventable.
@SimonSwagg316 @RandPaul Not the same comparison. We have the 2nd Amendment to our Constitution. We must allow law abiding citizens the God given right to protect themselves. If EXISTING background check laws were inforcex by bureaucrats we would reduce bad guy gun violence.

@PatBerWA @JudicialWatch No thank you. That‚Äôs up to you to do your own research. I‚Äôm not here to convince you. I‚Äôm here to voice my own opinion.
@PatBerWA @JudicialWatch Essentially open border advocates think or want the US to be a free for all. We have laws, we are a sovereign country. We have the right to decide who, how many &amp; when our country can safely allow illegal aliens to immigrate here.
@PatBerWA @JudicialWatch Yes the founding fathers refer to foreigners of a different country to be ‚Äúillegal aliens‚Äù specifically. They are not necessarily classified as immigrants even if they refer to themselves as such.
@LanceEdwardsChr @JudicialWatch If you are from another country you are assumed to be a citizen of that country of origin. Therefore what I‚Äôm saying is one would be both a foreigner and a citizen of their country of origin.
@PatBerWA @JudicialWatch For any foreigner to enter  the US uninvited and ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù as under US jurisdiction is the question. I suspect the Constitution founders didn‚Äôt intend for aliens to invade our country without acceptance under our laws or jurisdiction our responsibility without permission.

@garycp70 @hughhewitt @SebGorka @Hillsdale And why would Republican tax payers want their tax dollars going to Democrats or to find abortions they don‚Äôt believe in? Funds are likely commingled together. So who knows if the donations come from profits or tax payer subsidizes unless they are audited.
@garycp70 @hughhewitt @SebGorka @Hillsdale No one said PP is using the exact tax payer dollars to fund campaigns! But why are we subsidizing PP if the organization can afford to donate millions to democratic candidates? What part of that do you not understand?
