@klingensmith_j @debsaok @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump They didn‚Äôt insult you and make assumptions based on your political affiliation. This is my last comment.
@klingensmith_j @debsaok @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump Please remember I‚Äôm not the one who resorted to insults.
@klingensmith_j @debsaok @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump I never said I was smarter. I just said talk to someone who is uninformed and maybe they‚Äôll fold when they‚Äôre insulted. I won‚Äôt, because I have facts.
@klingensmith_j @debsaok @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump Forced charity is not charity.
@klingensmith_j @debsaok @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump So much for trying to have a serious discussion. I had to block him/her. I don‚Äôt deal with insults.
@debsaok @klingensmith_j @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump In that case you can keep deflecting somewhere else. Talk to someone who knows less than I do, maybe you‚Äôll win.
@debsaok @klingensmith_j @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump Oh ok so now we‚Äôre just being rude. Here I thought we were having an intelligent conversation.
@debsaok @klingensmith_j @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs the entire philosophy behind Conservatism. I honestly don‚Äôt have time to give you all of it but think business - they do better with less burden and regulations, right?
@debsaok @klingensmith_j @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump I was responding to her comment about resources and homeless.
@klingensmith_j @debsaok @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump All of hers other problems will be helped with government restrictions being lifted.
@klingensmith_j @debsaok @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump Unemployment is at its lowest in years. The economy is booming!
@klingensmith_j @debsaok @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump Absolutely. And in the meantime we shouldn‚Äôt be subject to the arbitrary restrictions based on an arbitrary solution!
@debsaok @klingensmith_j @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump When you see the data which I kindly provided earlier in this thread, you can see that more government intervention and restricting the amount of opioids prescribed is not helping.
@debsaok @klingensmith_j @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump The government does NOT belong in my doctors office. My quality of care and life have been significantly reduced because of these new guidelines for a manufactured opioid ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù
@debsaok @klingensmith_j @ThomasKlineMD @Medium @realDonaldTrump That is not true. None of the restrictions on opioids so far have caused less people to become addicted. None of them. They‚Äôre only hurting those who are disabled, sick, and in pain.
