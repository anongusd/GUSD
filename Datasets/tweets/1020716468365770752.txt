@siano2020 Water soluble.  So you can lay off it for two days and have a negative screen.  Unless they test your hair. Which they don‚Äôt routinely.
@siano2020 also right. Not all jobs it is as critical.  But the cutoff they use is very lenient.  You have to be a heavy user to show up positive.  Depending on the test used.  Also THc is fat soluble.  So it stays in your system much longer than most other drugs.  Like heroin, which is
@siano2020 But yes we should stop holding out wkedtres officials to a lower standard than the rest.  They should be drug tested and we should stop allowing them lie at will.  The rest of us, excluding lawyers, can‚Äôt lie at work on a daily basis.
@siano2020 Disagree.  Just because it‚Äôs legal doesn‚Äôt mean you can go to work high.   Alcohol is legal, but you can‚Äôt show up to work drunk.  Lots of things are legal, but doesn‚Äôt mean that employers have to hire you if you engage in a legal activity. eg you organize KKK marches on weekends

@therrienv @mjhvn_miguel @AdamParkhomenko Exactly.  I hahte that rationale.  Well people will just find away. So why have any laws then?!? I hate when people use that argument.
@mjhvn_miguel @AdamParkhomenko @therrienv And even if I‚Äôm wrong. At least allow studies to show whether it helps or not. Why won‚Äôt you guys even allow studies and debate the merits of the results.  There are some out now that back up my point. Go to google scholar.  Then we can debate the facts. Not your opinion.
@mjhvn_miguel @AdamParkhomenko @therrienv No one said anything about penalizing responsible gun owners. You guys are the ones I want having guns.  And I‚Äôm not gonna debate you on your other arguments. Any changes made saves lives.  Not every life. But saves lives.  To argue otherwise goes against the laws of probability.

@JB_Ruble @TimBrando The saints were ahead.  And still lost.  After the bad call they still had a lead.  And did nothing.  True. 90% of the time first and goal.  You score. But not always a TD. And anything could have happened. Or missed the fg if it came to that.  A champion would have stopped LA
@JB_Ruble @TimBrando It‚Äôs not a simple concept.  That‚Äôs loser talk.  The saints had many chances after the bad call to take home the victory. But they didn‚Äôt. Which means the rams were the better team that day.  They could have taken a loss.  Fumbled. Int. Sack.  Missed fg.  Lots. It‚Äôs not a given.
@TimBrando The thing with the Saints is, yes it was a bad call, but they still had the lead after they kicked the field goal. And there were three more possessions That the saints could have won the game on after. And they didn‚Äôt get it done on any of them. That‚Äôs not winning ball there.

@LauraMiers @DeFeliceJanette It‚Äôs because folks keep electing republican who keep steering more money to the very rich and very sociopathic and very greedy.

@DeFeliceJanette @LauraMiers I agree. Why we should adopt some of the strategies and initiative I mentioned.  There‚Äôs a way all can come out ahead.
@LauraMiers @DeFeliceJanette Because they don‚Äôt contribute to that states taxes to fund public education.  Private receives no such funds. So every student pays the same.
@LauraMiers @DeFeliceJanette The cost aren‚Äôt the same either. Tuition alone is almost $50,000 per semester at tcu and $10,000 at Texas Austin.  I don‚Äôt know if any private school that offers the same tuition as public for in state students. It if state students at public universities pay private rates.
@LauraMiers @DeFeliceJanette As long as people can pay it will continue. We do need to make it more affordable. And steer students to certain professions and areas and offer assistance that way. No one should be denied an opportunity for an education.
@LauraMiers @DeFeliceJanette Hell of it.  More options to pay back loans.  Working in certain careers.  Areas.  Etc.  there‚Äôs a win win scenario for this problem. Not just giving everyone a free ride.  Incentives to employers to offer tuition reimbursement.  There‚Äôs lots of ways that no one is discussing.
@LauraMiers @DeFeliceJanette That‚Äôs a private school.  That means you pay the full cost of education.  Public schools are much less.  So you could say students are getting a bargain.  However I feel gov assistance should go to all student that meet performance requirements.  ie not just taking classes for th

@Candythesmolboo @ChasingOzPhotog And there is absolutely no case of a pregnancy not involving significant risk to the mother. Never have and never will be.
@ChasingOzPhotog @Candythesmolboo Right. If this country truly cared it would address the other issues where life is lost that are preventable.  Our recorded compares to Europe and Canada is atrocious.  We only take care of the most wealthy.  Or who can pay.
@Candythesmolboo @ChasingOzPhotog There is always danger.  Even in a healthy mother with no pre existing.  Things go wrong. Medically and during delivery.  And by the providers.  And her life is affected.  Her career. Her body.  Her mental state.  Etc.
@Candythesmolboo @ChasingOzPhotog Ok. Give me a proposal where the father has a say and how to reconcile that when the female doesn‚Äôt want to carry the child. I agree it‚Äôs valid. But I can‚Äôt think of a way to reconcile it where both parties are treated fairly.  In that case you have to defer to the one at risk
@ChasingOzPhotog @Candythesmolboo Mississippi has the most restrictive abortion laws yet the highest maternal mortality rate.  Shows their argument is disingenuous.  They don‚Äôt give a duck about the sacredness oif life.  They only care about what resonates with potential voters.  For the gop.
@Candythesmolboo @ChasingOzPhotog Argument where the burden can be shifted to the male.  It‚Äôs not a perfect world and not perfect solutions. The female has to be the one to decide.  She‚Äôs the one who has to carry the child and risk her life and so on. Things no male will ever have to do.
@Candythesmolboo @ChasingOzPhotog Tests using Fetal dna in material circulation are being developed which may lead to establishing paternity early in the pregnancy. But even then.  The choice still defaults to the party with the most risk and burden.  The female. Not to discount the argument, but it‚Äôs not an ...
@Candythesmolboo @ChasingOzPhotog This is a valid point. However, since the female is the one risking her life, and other factors,  the choice should be hers.

@thewisechoice17 @ESPNCFB @drpepper That is; invite the team that may or may not be better than UGA; but has a better record and hasn‚Äôt already played and lost to another member of top four. We know UGA isn‚Äôt the best and the playoffs are to decide who is the best. Right now we have 4 other teams that can make the
@thewisechoice17 @ESPNCFB @drpepper You resolve arguments of this case as folkows. When one decision, invite UGA, is known. They have lost to one of the four best and have 2 losses.  And the other choice is unknown, 1 loss(or no losses). None to another top 4. Then you make the decision that isn‚Äôt known.
@thewisechoice17 @ESPNCFB @drpepper I don‚Äôt understand your logic as to how they are 4 best.  A loss is a loss.  They have 2 of those now. One to a team they may face again and lose to again. What would be the point in inviting them?  Another 1-loss team has a better case for 4 best.

Let them be a pseudo first round.  Eliminate divisions and that would go a long way toward that goal. Divisions serve no purpose than to muddy the argument.

@irishdodger @pd3244 @davidpollack47 @CollegeGameDay @CFBPlayoff They get credit for greatness simply by going undefeated.  For the last 20 years it hasn‚Äôt been proven out.  A few years ago the title game wasn‚Äôt close.  This year remains to be seen.  But if they go 2-9. The next season they‚Äôre 4-0 and they get ranked in Top 10.  Everyone else

@pd3244 @davidpollack47 @CollegeGameDay @CFBPlayoff Every single year.  And you lose that game then no. You don‚Äôt win the championship then you don‚Äôt deserve to go. Under the current system it‚Äôs not so black and white. Eliminate divisions. They serve no purpose.  Look at the matchups this year.  They also provide boring schedules
@pd3244 @davidpollack47 @CollegeGameDay @CFBPlayoff I disagree.  What if one division of a conference has the two best teams in the nation?  They won‚Äôt play in the conference championship.  The fly in the ointment is division in conferences. Eliminate decisions and problem solved.  The top two in each conference face on the field.

@OliveTrouble @JCrongeyer @DesireeResists @SuperCopyCat @Multijo1 So if we lost Arizona. Instead of a net loss of 12 electoral votes. We‚Äôd only lose a net of 4. Much more fair.  And takes into consideration states and population. But gives a bigger say to people than states.  But doesn‚Äôt discount totally a State‚Äôs voice in matters.
@OliveTrouble @JCrongeyer @DesireeResists @SuperCopyCat @Multijo1 For example, if a person gets 60% of a vote in a state. And that state has ten representatives.  The winner gets 2 for wining the states and then 6 for winning 60% of the vote and therefor 6 of 10. The loser gets 4.  Much better than 12-0.  The winner would win 8-4.
@JCrongeyer @OliveTrouble @Multijo1 People would get the biggest say in elections.  Much as the power is dispersed in the two houses. The problem with the houses is the uneven dispersal of power.  That need to be addressed as well.
@JCrongeyer @OliveTrouble @Multijo1 Much more fair.  Instead of a net loss of 12 electoral votes for losing a state then it‚Äôs only a net loss of 4 electoral votes.  This proposed system would Honor both states and population. Without giving you much power to rural states. But they still get a bigger say. But the
@JCrongeyer @OliveTrouble @Multijo1 Such as: If a person gets 60% of a vote in a state. And that state has ten representatives. The winner gets 2 for wining the states and then 6 for winning 60% of the vote and therefor 6 of 10. The loser gets 4.  Then instead of the winner having a 12-0 gain. They only get 8-4.
@OliveTrouble @JCrongeyer @DesireeResists @SuperCopyCat @Multijo1 I agree.  That‚Äôs why I feel that winners of each state should get 2 votes and then split the rest based on percentage of votes they received.  But then you‚Äôre aware Cali wouldn‚Äôt have all 55 go to the democrat winner.  But it is a more fair system proposal. Winner takes all isnt.
@coleyworld How could there be any debate?
@orange_parrot19 @OliveTrouble @JCrongeyer @Multijo1 And in making laws.  It‚Äôs fair and consistent with the founders and framers intent.  To base it solely on population is in short un American.
@orange_parrot19 @OliveTrouble @JCrongeyer @Multijo1 The reason why we are unique is we are a nation of states.  I don‚Äôt know how many times I have to repeat this.  Other countries have a different system and either don‚Äôt have states or don‚Äôt give them such weight.  We do! And sense we do we have to give them a voice in elections
@orange_parrot19 @OliveTrouble @JCrongeyer @Multijo1 Under the current the winner gets all 12.  Now the loser would lose 8-4.  So only a net loss of 4 votes.  Not 12. More fair.  Of course different for each state. I used a simplified example.
@orange_parrot19 @OliveTrouble @JCrongeyer @Multijo1 Because states count to in our nation. States and people.  So if a person gets 60% of a vote in a state. And that state has ten representative.  The winner gets 2 for wining the states and then 6 for winning 60% of the vote and therefor 6 of 10. The loser gets 4
@JCrongeyer @DesireeResists @SuperCopyCat @OliveTrouble @Multijo1 Do you not get the rationale behind two houses ?  Of a nation of states and people?  The fundamental basis of our nation is states rights and representation of the people and states.  I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it. Seems simple to me.
