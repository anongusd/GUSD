@Flap Not true, primary elections are relatively new and started in the progressive era. So you can't say it's been that way since founding.

@Flap I just feel it's been that kind of thinking for years that got us where we are. It's a game of politics instead of values.
@Flap So your stand would be to vote for the most electable even if they're not the best candidate. Valid point & there's no good answer.
@jserb I love Cavuto, the man has a backbone and never fails to flub up the liberals with plain old common sense!
@Flap Agreed. I guess my question is should people vote for who they think would do the best job or who's the best of the most electable?
