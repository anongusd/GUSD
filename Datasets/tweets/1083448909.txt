@POTUS He seems to forget that his own mother came into this country from Scotland as a domestic worker w/ only $50 in her pocket
@POTUS The idea that poor immigrants are a drag on society is simply not true.
@POTUS' endorsement of policies that rip families apart and slash legal migration to the US is stupid and shortsighted.

This is an ominous sign for the future of the American Presidency and the United States of America.
However, Mr. Trump has turned a blind eye to overt racism. Indeed, in many instances, Mr. Trump himself has stirred the seeds of bigotry.
One would think that an American President in the 21st Century would be dedicated to eradicating racism once and for all.
