@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Get help. Seriously, this tweet is psychotic.
@NatsGal @GOP @Liz_Cheney They actually try to sell the notion that a pediatrician advocates infanticide. Insane.
@GOP @Liz_Cheney You’re a vile liar. Look up anencephaly. Dr. Northam has been in company of grieving parents. Your father caused thousands to die with his illegal war in Iraq. Liz, STFU.
@StelliniTweets No strike please!
@SenRickScott Could you be any more embarrassing?
@RealCandaceO What was this you said about Hitler maybe should have just stayed in Germany? DaFuq?
@Acosta Sure, Jan.
@kevin_reiss Do both.

@KeyProTrump @MikevWUSA @lookner @wusa9 Calling on him to resign.
@MikevWUSA @wusa9 I’ve met his family, his Mother. I am heartbroken. He needs to resign.
@MaryDofVA @notlarrysabato Depends on how they lived their life &amp; the severity of the crime. Fairfax should resign.
@rogersliam @TennS4Ever @Bencjacobs He bragged about it. #accessHollywood
@SportingGreenSF @susanslusser No, he’s staying in DC 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
@MaryDofVA @notlarrysabato Those were terrible racist acts. Now they can use their time in office seeking to make amends. GOP would seek to undo their accomplishments. Herring fought Trump on Muslim travel ban &amp; has been strong on gay rights. He was re-elected with that record. GOP put a racist in WH.
@MaryDofVA @notlarrysabato No Republican would resign over past racists acts.  Northam &amp; especially Herring have a progressive track record. Herring won re-election based on it.
@RealCandaceO Were you the chick apologizing for Hitler earlier today?
@MaryDofVA @notlarrysabato No, Dems should not cede power to GOP. Fairfax should go.
@cFidd Nah, do not cede power to Va. GOP. Not one GOP office holder would resign over past racist act. Northam &amp; especially Herring have a progressive record. Herring won re-election based on fighting Trump’s Muslim travel ban &amp; promoting gay rights. Investigate Fairfax.

@jonathanchait @MaxBoot He definitely wasn’t acting when he played a virulent racist in “Ghosts of Mississippi”
@HallieJackson @albamonica @SecretaryRoss @senatemajldr &amp; @GOPLeader aren’t moved by these stories. They know Democrats are. They’re hoping media will push both sides BS &amp; Democrats will falter. Do not fall into that trap. #TrumpMcConnellShutdownDay34 #McConnellSociopath

@GeraldoRivera @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump Trump violated security protocols by revealing details of Pelosi’s trip to Afghanistan &amp; threatened a family member of a witness (Cohen’s father-in-law) That was just since yesterday. #TakeASeat
@GOP @trumps_feed Idiots, now Capitol mailroom will have to deal with your ****. You may not care about Speaker Pelosi or Sen. Schumer, but could you give a thought to mail handlers for 1 GD min. Especially since 1 of your MAGAts was caught sending pipe bombs to politicians &amp; journalists. #Thugs
@TVDArlingtonVA @NatsAndCats 72, voted for McGovern. 🤷🏻‍♀️

@NatsAndCats @TVDArlingtonVA Useless knowledge Dept! 😂😂😂
@NatsAndCats @TVDArlingtonVA 2 were Senators, Jones was MOC, Budget committee chair if memory serves. Fred’s wife, LaDonna ran for something. LOL, I hadn’t thought about any of these folks in decades.
@NatsAndCats @TVDArlingtonVA Off the top of my head: David Boren, Fred Harris, James Jones...

@VP @March_for_Life @WhiteHouse @StudentsforLife @HeartbeatIntl @POTUS Tell Trump &amp; McConnell to open the govt. You’re causing suffering &amp; stress. NOW, VP Lickspittle
@VCUPav Due to McConnell &amp; Trump.
@VCUPav Disagree. She’s did her part.
@igorbobic JFC, Mitch is a sociopath. @senatemajldr
@VCUPav No. She’s now 2nd in line to be POTUS &amp; needs to see &amp; be seen by NATO allies &amp; troops in Afghanistan. House has passed bills to end shutdown. It’s up to McConnell. Who, BTW, is a sociopath who hates democracy.

@jbarro Singing it is a good way to calm down a rowdy group of 26 kindergarten students. #retiredKteacher
@Empowerment2U @AshilyTweet @SecNielsen Nancy, it was a charity event. Since Trump neglected Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. BTW, many Puerto Rican citizens serve in the military. Happy to have been of help.
@SecNielsen Why should they put in all the extra hours when they’re not being paid? Tell Trump to open the government if you care about Secret Service so much. Go tell him right now.
@brithume Brit can’t admit that Pelosi outmaneuvered Trump. Pretends it was his idea all along.

@TrishRowley1 @BonnieBlueTK @senatorshoshana @senorrinhatch Trish, Never lost my sense of humor! DC citizens deserve a vote on 2 Senators &amp; Representatives in Congress. My niece lives there. I value my ability to vote for those office holders here in Va.

@1067theFan How brave of him. 😬🤔😉
@kylegriffin1 Hey @BenSasse Mr. High &amp; Mighty? This requires your attention! @LindseyGrahamSC  could you quit groveling for 1 min &amp; look into this injustice? @SenTomCotton could you provide housing for these vets, since you claim to care about them? 🤔
@realDonaldTrump Why are veterans being denied their GI Bill benefits because of a computer glitch? Fix immediately!
@UrbanAchievr Yes. @GOPChairwoman Great hire, Ms ROMNEY.
@MikieSherrill @creynoldsnc Thank you from this daughter of a veteran!

@ElizabethEThorp @jennycohn1 I did so this morning.
@EWErickson 🚁
@SteveScalise Believe you’ll be vacating this office in January. 🌊👋🏼🌊👋🏼
@TheJudoJoker @Lewis6Jay @dcNATSHACK LOL. Don’t think teams are allowed to trade players they’ve just signed. Something about bad faith.
@TheJudoJoker @Lewis6Jay @dcNATSHACK I think there’s a rule against that.

@ComfortablySmug Abrams was up against guy who was in charge of Georgia’s voting rolls, precincts, apparatuses. He rigged it in his favor. Nelson was entitled to a recount by state law. You’re whiny. Quit playing the victim. Boo hoo hoo.
@SmartOne8927 That’s why I believe in pitch counts.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Trump continues to insult those who got Bin Laden. Stay away from Arlington Cemetary. I don’t want Trump’s taint anywhere near my father’s final resting place.
