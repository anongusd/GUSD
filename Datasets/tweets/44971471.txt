a major scotus abortion (which I think is the central reason gop can't get traction w jews) case could always halt any momentum, but Democrats are moving left strong and there will be some voters lost for the new ones they acquire.
Republicans will do better with Jewish voters in 2020 despite the Trump messes (and I expect things will get much worse for him not better) after these Democratic primaries reveal a strong shift left on foreign policy/number of fronts. Not a big gop boost w jews, but some. https://t.co/t7Ugm3LExl

Parties that lose the WH seem to spend the next 4 years making the same case they lost with the first time only using some governing evidence and it fails more often than it works. The 2001-2004 enron pawn hillbilly idiot argument didn't really work for democrats fall 2002/4

@PeteAbe there are some guys that are going to want to go and if you're going to cover why Cora has issues w Trump only fair to cover the perspective of guys going because they like Trump. A lot of players come from places like Georgia, Mississippi etc that he won in 2016.
this is good, but @gop went looking for same thing at end of 43, and after a dance w "young guns hill leaders, sams club republicanism, autopsies etc" had 08,12,16 debates turn into "let's go back to the 80s" stuff until an aging outside the party populist blew through. https://t.co/pJ4dwvhguf

question is which electeds who will be in office post January 5, 2019 stand up in the #gop and pt finger at Trump/Miller tomorrow. Media should know better than to give Kasichs, Corkers, Flakes platforms anymore unless they're mounting serious 2020 primary challenge.

@ESPNChiCubs @GDubCub @MorrisseyCST a contending team fired him last year. What did they think was going to happen?
This happened after 9-11 and the subsequent 9-11 report, Qorvis and a few other firms took scrutiny/heat for their KSA work. Eventually blew over, but back then KSA had better leaders at home and in dc with a lot more depth+us side wasn't kushner. https://t.co/7GyGaIvjhN

@LenKasper @CarrieMuskat they had a terrible year and under performed which is why they didn't bring him back. Where is the accountability with media, fans, and members of the team? This is not 1998 where you're just glad the season didn't end in june.
Texas and California always seemed like the same story but for the different parties. In California the GOP's excuse is Pete Wilson, what is the Democrats excuse in Texas?
what's the pt of this state department briefing on #saudiarabia after the President already said "they (KSA) buy $110 billion worth of arms, we don't care"?

Jerry Falwell Jr, Sessions and a number of other guys on the right took a lot of heat and big risk going in on Trump over proven conservatives early. They should be getting more credit in conservative press moments like now and RBG looks absolutely miserable.

@catmsilverman @CraigCustance @jon_greenberg @MorrisseyCST @GDubCub they fed you a load of baloney. we hear months of stuff about teams searching every facet of nfl draft picks lives. They've had him in organization for 6 years+they don't know him? come on.

@juliebrichta @LenKasper @Cubs they don't give rings or fly flags for performance trophy seasons.
@Jason_Kraft_ @juliebrichta @LenKasper @Cubs They're 2 up with 16 to go despite adding Hamels, Murphy, Darvish, Morrow, chavez, kintzler+a breakout year from Bote. Not good enuf. This is a championship window not a 1998/2014 coming out of a rebuild year.
@BenVolin That would be a fascinating draft for you to revisit in offseason. So many interesting decisions. They took 3 guys from florida and gronk. Some interesting character and talent calls. The brady pick gets a lot of attention but they've won for 19 years because of drafts like that
@BenVolin they drafted Spikes/Cunningham that year instead of dunlap. Don't bury the lede,Ben.
@juliebrichta @LenKasper @Cubs The organization probably looked at 2018 schedule and said we want to clinch on White Sox field w our fans dominating their stadium. They'll now be lucky to do it Pitt series.
@juliebrichta @LenKasper @Cubs there are no performance trophies when you add Kintzler, Murphy, Hamels, Darvish, Morrow, Chatwood to a world series core. No one in that clubhouse, f/o or STH is happy up 2. 1998, 2011-15 maybe not now. Title windows are title or bust moments.
@LenKasper @Cubs they almost fall apart despite loading up at the deadline on top of a world series winning core and we're applauding this? I don't think fans and ppl in the org think that way who go to mesa expecting a title. Nor would announcers/fans in ny/la/sf/st louis.
@AlbertBreer they have Louisiana fans in Alabama, Bert.
Last time House GOP argued it was Iraq, WH pointed to Foley/hill scandals (abramoff). This time I think it's all Trump's erratic behavior high (low) lighted by Charlottesville, Russia-gate, NATO bashing, NAFTA-key violations of moderate GOP/independent causes of support. https://t.co/ZmWaEg1EJO

Obama got a lot of heat for his "coldness" and Bush got heat for his malapropisms+time in Texas (August 6, 2001), but they got out there into the states+sold the message. There's a limit to what social media+viral clips can do+Trump is finding that out.
I think the President would be having a lot more success w his message if he was getting out of the WH and doing events w real ppl instead of just tweeting and doing rallies where he trashes the media.

Cruz/Rubio/insert faceless Democrat senator who spends most of their time on CNN discussing Mueller don't have military backgrounds and largely came of age after US had won Cold War, but Putin didn't and McCain certainly didn't.
this reads like a first draft, you could easily spend a few thousand words right now just on what his loss in the senate means in terms of Russia. there aren't many veterans on the Hill left and fewer cold war era ppl which is key given Trump/Putin https://t.co/aKPtnqmjNu
For all the wonderful things Kristof et al are writing about McCain now, they unabashedly trashed his advocacy for neonconservatism, support for pro-life, pro NRA positions, mlk day vote and painted him as just another bush lover when he ran in 08.
Right now we're hearing from his supporters, members of left leaning press, but legacy is a lot more complicated on the right (campaign finance reform was HATED w/in party) and especially in hindsight with Iraq, Palin as major factors in rise of Trump. https://t.co/04Adzs49c3

most democrats today probably know little to zippo about their likely 2020 nominee (sorry it won't be biden) hard to see them finding a nominee, retaking congress, dealing w hill day to day AND waging all out Mueller political war w Trump.
If Mueller has the legal goods it's a problem for Trump, if not it's a political fight+dems distracted+ scrambling on 2020 w/out frontrunner are in trouble. Unless he's completely cleared it's a hindrance to hill gop facing ugly 2020 senate map+smaller house majority. https://t.co/v5Mbo32KPu

@SI_PeterKing @absolutesn the problem is that he-like many of his sportswriters turned political pundits have only been upset about the state of the nation since 1/2017 even tho many of the issues they're concerned with (race, inequality, etc) predate Trump+they didn't hold dems accountable.

the modern gop mantra is to hate gov (drown it in a bathtub) to begin with, winning power (which democrats haven't done) breeds disillusionment with unfulfilled promises or success which takes away unifying issues, and unlike dems gop base hates its 1992-2012 nominees/elctds. https://t.co/VL2IPIj2Ek

MSM reality check: Labor market is very strong, Hill is scandal free, progress on North Korea, no unpopular wars, no compelling dem retake congress narrative, senate/house maps STRONGLY favor GOP and yet constant media narrative "sky is falling, GOP doomed in fall".
the millennials call it yolo-you only live once to describe their go for it debauchery. Trump governs like YOPO-you're only president once.
@SteveKornacki @SeanTrende very good. Democrats also haven't made full on case in the north/sbrbs gop began making in 1968 in the south/rural areas+upped at the congrssnl level in the 1980s that led to 1994/2010 follow up. Like the gore recount stuff in 01/02 Mueller/Russia have distracted them.
@ltblaize to be fair half the media that cover the team either have a business relationship with it or various team personnel through books etc. He's not performing, that's the story not criticism for it from fans/media. They're not team pr.
@ltblaize it has nothing to do with mental health which is something serious and a separate issue not to be mocked. he's been in the league several years, you don't perform especially with a big contract on a contending team you're going to hear it, and it's part of being a pro.
@ltblaize this isn't the jose guzman/candy maldanado era. There's more at stake and blaming fans is beyond absurd.
@ltblaize it's a decent point but this is a team built to win now and $120 million pitchers aren't supposed to need months to get adjusted-that's what spring training is for.
@ChiSportUpdates @ChrisGimenez5 has been in the 312 about 5 minutes. Pretty ridiculous thing for veteran pro athletes to attack fans for their inability to perform.

if this guy is a disaster it virtually hands 2020 to Democrats. GOP can't afford to lose military veterans or they get wiped out a la virginia/carolinas 2008 https://t.co/RXvSSFLY5A
Part of the reason there's a market for this is because rural areas are less democratic than they used to be and the suburban/urban areas where the media lives are less republican increasing the former's suspicion of the media and desire for something that feeds into it. https://t.co/Yc97C2gKqm

media loves these #nevertrump #nolabels types but I don't see one candidate they're primarying in 2018 and @JeffFlake @SenBobCorker are quitting rather than take it to voters #azsen #tnsen https://t.co/cQkL2tzd98

@wpjenna @GlennKesslerWP @jtes is this anecdotal or do you have actual evidence because there were way more protests in the streets during Iraq War debates.
@MorrisseyCST @MarkLazerus when you're explaining you're losing. Just like Heywards $126 million bust of a deal,  justifying $55 million for a guy who doesnt play at an all star level because "he motivates the team" is a waste for pros who shouldn't need others to do that for them.

@dancurry @DickDurbin watch the first time Sinclair runs a Boris Epsteyn think piece on WGN or some non left of center commentary @RobertFeder and others will have meltdowns proclaiming a RW takeover of the station.
@dancurry @DickDurbin they care so much about race they never raise the issue about why CPD hands out 6,7,8 figure checks to victims every day, why the unions have wrecked the city schools, who's accountable for the crime, and AA's leaving. Sinclair taking over WGN will change that.

@BleacherNation @GDubCub which was an agreement ownership signed off on and which other teams have been happy to pay+still managed to win with-see LA. Ownership has pushed the spin of all those new revenues enhancing spending. Payroll was $150 when they took over+cut to $90-100 for most of rebuild.

RT @chadmkolton: Having organized press events with both a pig and with an ostrich I believe AGN has tweeted the truest words you will ever…
@MarkPotash the old Bill Walsh 49ers game plan was you script the first 15 plays of a half on offense. That's pretty terrible coaching to have that result.
Politico publishing cell phone photos of Senators boarding airplanes. People need outside interests.
Um so does the president https://t.co/xJLz1k69hP
@John_Kass Better question how do they celebrate fitzmas at fci englewood?
I think #JoeBiden wants to be the trivia answer to "First person to seek WH in 6 different decades and never was nominated or won a state"
@Eri_Barrister and who watches all those foreign rom com movies?
Solid way to blow one of the last midweek news cycles of the year. https://t.co/6JTJ2clQ0e
Ryan-4 years as leader, 4 as speaker+potentially leaving. Pelosi 14 as leader, 4 as speaker+staying. Makes sense for house democrats.
Sarah Sanders was in school in Arkansas day of Jonesboro shootings. Now a mom. Interesting spot to brush off #SandyHook questions.
If you're a black Republican who's ever wanted to work in the WH, the moment after media publishes stories on how few are working there now, would be a great time to reach out w a resume.
even for this WH, Omarosa unleashed is going to be a special episode or 7
Elaine Chao, Libby Dole, Jack Lew-you still have time! https://t.co/mXVqONTZDB
@Joelsherman1 it's not a sharp, functional organization.
@BenVolin your best one of 2017.
Fucktard isn't worth a national story. Bet campaign committees will look a lot lot harder at sexual violence backgrounds though this cycle in vetting candidates. https://t.co/oM8Uaxh7Zg
And obviously the best way all these #NeverTrump republicans feel to fight the president is as cable news pundits instead of fighting in primaries and at grassroots levels. #tnsen #azsen https://t.co/XdhbDMEm3N
"The people of middle income"
there are nearly a dozen dems in gop states or tossup states+dems haven't done well in a midterm in more than a decade, instead of playing golf, going after 3rd tier cable pundits maybe the President might want to start there instead. https://t.co/l2LeAK1W2Q
To read the press these days everything is 100percent about the press, the questions they ask, the indignities of the job, the feelings of the public and government toward them and the people they cover, issues, public are just sideshows and out of the picture. Ridiculous. https://t.co/Tk9bcARxaO
@JayZawaski670 @ReyMDiaz the KC alone should gain you a few hundred followers. Well played.
Rutnik-Gillibrand's legal mentor/political $$$ was David Boies who was a key #HarveyWeinstein cover up chief. Working OT to find a 2020 niche.
@JonHeyman @MorrisseyCST @GDubCub cobb is nice but they already have rotation full of 3s, you don't win titles with that although I'm sure the superfans in the industry media will tell us differently.
@John_Kass @dmihalopoulos @CTULocal1 You write good stuff John, but you pushed idea of Rahm for President and Treasury secretary for years.
@stoolpresidente biggest moment for #dolphins fans since Ace caught Finkle and returned Snowflake.
@thekapman he's up 10 pts. Your guys have beaten them once in 31 years.
@cnn and #whca disgraced themselves today. They think this administration is about their relationship w POTUS+instead of the work of the admin. Self Importance is big reason non partisans have lost trust in their work. https://t.co/o6MmfJ99ip

@EKANardini @stoolpresidente packaging was cool but 15 days from purchase to delivery was not.
@MorrisseyCST @MarkPotash #bengals Marvin Lewis 2 wins from tying Jim Mora sr from most rg season wins w/out a playoff win, so things could be worse in some ways. Even Rex won a game.
Silver lining for establishment #gop here is that Bannonistas finally got their chance to govern+we're seeing the failed results. In Hillary admin they'd just be fanning fake fantasies from internet/rallies. There's accountability and a real record now. https://t.co/QzAs6PQpyD
@MorrisseyCST the longer they hold onto Fox the longer there's someone else other than Pace/George to take the blame. Also would kill ratings/ticket sales for last 1/4 of season.
he's got a $25 million warchest +dozens of buildings in the state named after him. https://t.co/bEX16TJz8n
@FaceTheNation is fantastic at enabling stale guests to breeze through all of their TPs and stay on message.

The CBC has one of the most corrupt least successful orgs on hill. Story that's flown completely under radar of almost completely white hill press corps. Never had member elected a gov or senator+worked hard against obama in 2000 https://t.co/LHjrCvrJ3T
@thekapman No one who's ever said that has shown how they make the $ work w f o who's said repeatedly they won't pay the $$ tax for going over the cap.
@GlobeChadFinn They did this in 1998 won a title in 2003
@StuPolitics Many of the "moderate" #nevertrump Bush folks you see on tv now first advocated this same strategy in 2003 when W was in low 50s and they stuck w it the rest of his admin. @realDonaldTrump
@MorrisseyCST usual suspects were selling the kool aid hard this week that he was a done deal. Onto gearing up to spin winter meetings.

Rahm who many national pundits often laud as an "ace technocrat" first 3 edu chiefs-an ineffective guy fired after a strike, a convicted felon who looted system+now in jail, and this guy who lied repeatedly to cover up a bloated shady contract. https://t.co/1B2i4K8PnC
a lot of "non partisan" institutions that haven't behaved that way+got carried away during obama era-higher ed, state department  etc getting a cold dose of reality that Republicans get elected too+paying for the consequences. https://t.co/BBpwGT5YS4
Won't stop him from his next fawning Graham Thune or Ryan column. At least in 1990s some Republicans tried w RLC, Main Street, Tuesday Group etc+many like Danforth, Davis called this out more than a decade ago https://t.co/JzLfd1NySt

@stoolpresidente @EKANardini why does your stuff take 11 days to ship?
For a family that made its national reputation on bible thumping+judging others behavior that was pretty weak sauce again from @SHSanders45 defending #alsen. Doesn't matter if its her boss, not her views, but she accepted that role+his past.

He seems to like instant gratification, happy press, crowds and fans which he gets a lot more of when he gets out of the WH and seems to stay on message more, watch tv less, and irrationally tweet less. Don't know why they keep him in dc so much. https://t.co/1Ct6MoucQa

You don't see anywhere near the marches and protests of @realDonaldTrump that you did during Bush admin. Maybe the result of people choosing to vent via social media like FB now instead of physical spaces.
@emacSNY true look how many rings Phil Jackson added to his stash with @nyknicks
First chance of his administration Trump gets to really bask in a "I governed well" tweetstorm and it's overshadowed by preventable self destructive scandals. Amazing day.

@johndietzdh @MarkPotash he put up better numbers than mcdavid on the same team and after. Flutie faced the same issues and did OK.
what's been lost in this is how organized and deep the conservative movement is compared to the left. #gop controls everything and you don't see protests, a left wing teaparty or despite all that press #obama legacy change movements. https://t.co/qYsr2CWdcG
