@DrSPff @_GreatBike_ I've been an RN now for 11 yrs. This whole thing infuriates me. My job is to care for anyone walking through those doors. This could have such disastrous, far reaching affects.  We care for people. All people. How dare they do this.
@usda_nass We agree with the importance of the survey, but we also feel that proper implementation is important as well.
@usda_nass We responded faithfully until yields were compared to a county that did not directly neighbor our county. The yield differences were notable. The 3 counties that directly border us were much more comparable to yields on our farm. The county used was not.
@ILFarmBureau @RodneyDavis @realDonaldTrump @IllinoisFFA @Illinois4H They are great people... but Trumps policies won't do much to help them become great young farmers.
@Tomaskovics Absolute opposite of our industry then.....
@usda_nass My father refuses to fill out your survey due to the way the info is used i.e not using neighboring counties when looking at yields, etc.  Care to explain how this happens? Following your own rules is important when it comes to gaining trust.

@murrayjohnsonjr Same here. My profits would also be taxable.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow So would I. It is a home. It is not my income.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow but you do not make a profit on a home that you inherit and live in.
@LauricellaTom @paulkrugman I am a liberal. I am a farm owner. This is not a fake argument.
@TonyFurnari2 @BCAppelbaum haha!!!  No- i agree with you on this 100%!! It ruins family farms. See-bipartisanship!!! Lol! Can be done! :)
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow look at it this way. We pay income tax on something we have to pay inheritance tax on. You don't with your house.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow @BCAppelbaum it is simply years of work, thrown away.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow @BCAppelbaum because it is taking away from a farmers ability to earn. Most people have to sell to pay taxes.
@TonyFurnari2 I am definitely my fathers daughter!
@TonyFurnari2 @BCAppelbaum Democrat farmer, here! Lol! But there is something wrong with this!! Don't start me on taxation without rep!
@TonyFurnari2 @BCAppelbaum right?? All money "made" pays off notes and inputs, just to borrow money for the next season. My lord.
@BCAppelbaum This is not a myth. This hurts the family farmer. Talk to a regular sized farm owner and see what they have to say.
@BCAppelbaum "farming looks mighty easy when your pencil is a plow and your a thousand miles from a corn field." Come on.
@BCAppelbaum Have you ever heard of a soil test? I mean this is one of the most uneducated threads I have come across.
@BCAppelbaum Maybe avg nationwide including non-farmable land. Good black dirt is $8-14,000 easy. Check out Illinois prices.
@broodcow @murrayjohnsonjr @BCAppelbaum Exactly.
@murrayjohnsonjr that also leads us to equipment. Very few own $300k combines outright. Now you have lost half your income and have that.
@murrayjohnsonjr just because the farm is free&amp;clear for 500 acres, they may be trying to purchase another 500. The owned 500 is collateral.
@murrayjohnsonjr without the land to work, they have lost their way of life, and way to pay off debt.
@murrayjohnsonjr so, some may be forced to sell, to pay off taxes, then be left with other farm debt to pay.
@murrayjohnsonjr correct. We all pay on our net worth. But the farm is also the way we earn our living. Through generations.
@broodcow @murrayjohnsonjr @BCAppelbaum The most heartbreaking part of it all.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow @BCAppelbaum that is the only option for many families. End result- nothing left and tons of debt.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow @BCAppelbaum If they wont, we lose our way of life. And still have to pay off all of the farm bills.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow @BCAppelbaum that is the way many fams get the $. We would have to persuade a bank to lend it to us.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow @BCAppelbaum until we can't make the tax payment and are forced to sell off a chunk to keep a small part.
@murrayjohnsonjr @broodcow @BCAppelbaum I wouldn't sell it for a trillion. My entire family lives/has lived on that farm. 100 yrs of work.
@sassyjjn businesses that provide services to farms are doing quite well... by charging a fortune for services/supplies to family farms.
@paulkrugman Ours is a family farm. My great grandpa, grandpa, dad, brother and hopefully kids will farm the same fields. Heritage.
@paulkrugman We aren't hyper rich. We are asset rich and cash flow poor. We love our land and want it to stay in our families!
@broodcow @BCAppelbaum All we have are assets! Correct! The thought of my great grandpas land being sold sickens me.
