@JulieMett @leeurban Absolutely. Most orgs employ trackers when they are in the midst of a heated debate/campaign. That way they own the media/content they capture and can do with it what they please. The general rule is, any event open to the public is open to a tracker.
@leeurban This is a normal, age old practice. The trackers usually form a good working relationship with the opposing candidate in much the same way a reporter does. If that relationship and the sportsmanship has soured, then civility is lost.

@maegancarberry link didn't work!
@tweetcongress It was proposed by the Center for American Progress' Action Fund as the progressive hash tag...then it tookoff #topprog
Well #topprog tweetup. I am signing off for now.  Keep the conversation rolling and I'll summarize tomorrow at http://www.topprog.org
@jdp23 Yes. I was planning on puttng something together tomorrow on topprog.org. #topprog
@problemchylde Couldn't sum it up in 140. But, it will most likely be via a phone call to @drdigipol #topprog
@rblinne Sounds interesting, I'll have to look into that for topprog.org #topprog
@problemchylde However, I am not an offical rep in any way. Just moderating and sharing #topprog
@problemchylde I agree. Everyone was invited. they are working on a few things...then I am going to report #topprog
@rblinne What is a DK concept? #topprog
@jdp23 No. I think they are sitting back until they see what happens.
We plan2 feed in #topprog then allow topprog.org users to login with twitterinfo, &  vote & tag tweets into actions, events, talkingpoints
@problemchylde CAPAF also has a few projects that will work in tandom with topprog.org which we will cross promote #topprog
@problemchylde I have talked with Alan Rosenblatt at capaf. Open self organizing (like this) is what they want to promote #topprog
@rblinne What if we took it a step farther and voted on tweets? & tagging there of? #topprog. So its less top heavy more comm #topprog
What can we learn from #journchat # journchat.info? What should we transfer to topprog.org? #topprog
@problemchylde But sometimes even to get to that point it takes legwork, PR from the roots #topprog
@NanetteHB We are discussing #topprog in general and what we would like to see on http://www.topprog.org and other spinnoffs
@anotherpundit Agreed. But is there interest in taking the next step. Turning conversation into action? #topprog Maybe with topprog.org?
RT @anotherpundit: stop following tcot lead folks this should be a conversation open space to talk about #metamessage s, ideas, etc #topprog
@jdp23 We can do that by avoiding cross posting to tcot
RT @problemchylde:Heh much easier said than done U need coordinated PR I made some am images for #rebelleft but #topprog will be bigger
#topprog Tweetup Question:As seen by the last few posts from tcotrs. Shouldn't we utilize the RT effectivly to spread the word on imp tweets
@rblinne Gotch, just wanted to take the opportunity to clear that up. #topprog
#topprog #action Tweet media outlets and bloggers on your freinds list asking them to promote #topprog / use it on relevant posts
@jdp23 Sounds like a great plan. Are their any media outlits or bloggers who would be interested in writting a story about #topprog?
@rblinne Glad to hear it! However this is hardly 'my' hash tag rather I am just an actor within it, utilizing its tools #topprog
@jdp23 I agree that inclusiveness is key We want to stay as far away from the elitism that surrounds TCOT and open it to all progs #topprog
How do we better organize around #topprog ? What next steps do we take to ensure action? I will be working on topprog.org, you?
@matttbastard It's also a streach to say that they are civil in their means. Maybe another forum would be the proper place #topprog
@jdp23 Topprog.org is just temporary. Tonights discussion and community feedback will guide it's development #topprog
@jdp23 Not that I know of. But you can post within your account.
@problemchylde has a very good point #topprog
Who are progressive VIP's that we would like to pursuade to become active on twitter & #topprog
#topprog Would we want to open up some sort of diologue with the #tcot community?
#topprog Are we reprocating iphone twitter apps / facebook twitter apps? What would we bring to the table?
#topprog Tweetup Question: Are there other developers that would donate their time to this community project? Would you refer any?
@tweetcongress Have you looked at also posting to #topprog?
#topprog are there other services that people would like to integrate with #topprog?  Facebook page? Organizational partnerships?
I think cross posting is key though. Cooperation and coalition building only makes us stronger. #topprog
@jdp23 I think cross posting is key though. Cooperation and coalition building only makes us stronger.
Oops. I meant use hastags to take actions not just #topprog in that last tweet.
@jdp23 Others use #topprog to take action, but not with twitter, rather other tools empowerd by tweets. What tools do we need?
#topprog tweetup question: How do we use #topprog to advance the progressives goals in policy?
@maku520 do people submit those hash tags. who modeates? voting system?
From Jon via email "what other role models should we look at besides tcot?" #topprog
@maku520 Ok.  So we intigrate the message board with the social network.
@spomer32 Would you like to see those news stories organized and tagged in one place like tcot's news site? #topprog
@jdp23 Plodt is very interesting. I'll look into it.
Should the topprog.org comm be more similar to a social network like TCOT's action or based on the twitter login information. Both? #topprog
@maku520 @andrewpwitt Totally possible, what about getting feature heavy? #topprog
@jroberts5 The community.  Almost like aprogressive talking point wiki but using twitter to post talking points
@DivadNhoj1981 Lol. Nope. I think that would work well on the front page, don't you? See the temp site http://topprog.org #topprog
@jdp23 What if you could cross post those events onto topprog.org so that other progs outside of your imidiate network can see them?
@maku520 search for "#topprog #tweetup" for an example on how we can organize around dual event tweets
@DivadNhoj1981 Are there tools that you like of TCOT's that you would like to see? with #topprog ?
@myrnatheminx We can add hash tags to events& interest to #topprog #tweetup then feed them to a page / follow them example http://is.gd/iioi
@myrnatheminx CAPAF is going to build topprogtweets.org or com. And maybe a few other sites as well. Anyone should be able to subit things
@myrnatheminx I like the way you are moving. But, without overwealming the community, we need to be able to organize the info. #topprog
@myrnatheminx How would you like those actions delivered?  SMS, Emails? Should we organize them on topprog.org
#topprog tweetup Question: What good lessons can we learn from the TCOT community?
@maku520 For sure. #topprog
@maku520 So far we have had requests for geolocation, talking points, action items, events postings, twitter API usage
@jdp23 Couldn't agree more.  Let's do this our own way. Has everyone seen the tcot ning site? Very feature heavy,but nice #topprog
@jdp23 What ways would individuals work within that social network? How do we activate the community, not just inform them?
@myrnatheminx #topprog Is an social movement  sparked by the Center for American Progress that gained quick ground. Dont want to devide comm
@myrnatheminx I don't feel like I or anyone has the ability to do that. #topprog
First question to the #topprog community How do you see the role of #topprog within the general progressive community?
Let the #topprog tweetup begin. Thoughts, questions, suggestions, community organizing at http://www.topprog.org
