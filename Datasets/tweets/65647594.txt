It’s true. Three years after a #yearinspace, I’m on Earth missing space. While I don’t see as many sunrises in a day, I don’t take a single one for granted. Nor will I ever forget this one. Thankful I can share it with you all again today! https://t.co/la4lewqqqG
One of my 14 crewmates who flew with me over the course of my #yearinspace Gennady Padalka said, “When you’re in space, you miss Earth. When you’re on Earth, you miss space.” https://t.co/xS3YLDM329
There was never one more glorious than the other. But my last sunrise on my #yearinspace will always be a bittersweet memory. https://t.co/6dgE8Q5pPk
In space, I had the privilege of seeing 16 sunrises a day. On this last mission, I saw a total 5,440 sunrises. #yearinspace https://t.co/7U9m7yYNNJ
Three years ago on day 340 of my #yearinspace, I captured this sunrise before returning to Earth. https://t.co/nZVVR0W2V6

We are going around Earth so fast, that day and night come quickly and often. Every 92 minutes.  https://t.co/h2bR5GvF74
Tropical waters and deserts look pretty cool from here.  https://t.co/TQY3UzumNm
I don't know. A lot. The longer I am here, the better I am though.  https://t.co/J5B1yD99aT
Sponge bath.  https://t.co/1HvAx8mMo4
Right now, I am reading Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage. I read it the last time I was here.  https://t.co/0lo7FjqHKm
You have to be held down by bungees. And it's hard to run at your real weight by bungees.  https://t.co/XteyOzcE0a
Nikkon D4. And I use various lenses.  https://t.co/3vrsHZJBUE
Yes. As long as I could come back.  https://t.co/KEyQVKgMa1
Greenwich Mean Time. GMT https://t.co/V93ZJwzEQD
Managing garbage is a challenge. We have to load it all on a resupply vehicle and send it back into the atmosphere.  https://t.co/Ooid9XBIdB
I try not to.  https://t.co/6wuOWqw7rq
Yes, and hopefully we'll learn things on this #YearInSpace that will better position us for our #JourneytoMars.  https://t.co/E4P8FGU9wB
Earth. Earth is better. Although, it is a privilege to be here.  https://t.co/IUjX0UuFZK
No. We could play catch w a baseball. You wouldn't want to throw it hard though. The emergency room is far away.  https://t.co/mnCt0O8uSl
Being in a place you can't leave, makes you value your freedom more.  https://t.co/2Jg1RmxTWb
Granola and oatmeal for breakfast. Grilled chicken w spicy green beans on a tortilla, tropical fruit salad &amp; coffee. https://t.co/FcfTDCcBwK
We get a couple hours off in the evening and about a day 1/2 on the weekend. I'll get 5 or 6 holidays off in a year. https://t.co/a561RWQ5MS
Not yet. But I notice the #Aurora in the North is getting stronger, so I know change is coming.  https://t.co/4V9bLyk6p3
Mostly dreams that I'm on the @space_station. Some dreams on #Earth, but those are rare.  https://t.co/zzp04mLdBJ
I sleep in a sleeping bag that has one strap at the top, so my head doesn't float forward and hit the computer.  https://t.co/CfZlprN1YG
I only have one, my brother @ShuttleCDRKelly, so I guess that makes him the favorite.   https://t.co/hyP3glSWiI
No good luck charms. But I carry a radiation dosimeter in my pocket.  https://t.co/ZC9YmFuByR

I read some, talk on the phone, look at the Earth and I watch television, occasionally.  https://t.co/DD4L6Q4b9p
That's what we are going to learn when I return. But probably, yes.  https://t.co/wFkGl3XQGa
Yes. Your question is here aboard @space_station.  https://t.co/ub79ALvqR7
Pace yourself. Get enough rest. And understand a year is a long time.  https://t.co/2Tj3r1rj3N
I probably drink about a liter 1/2, and I get about a liter in our food. And it comes mostly from our urine.  https://t.co/9cWlh71vCf
We get special deliveries from Earth. But we grew and ate lettuce for veggie study to help w our #JourneytoMars.  https://t.co/Sutap8GfVY
Sure. It will be a few minutes though. Hang tight! https://t.co/r2rHJUkAo2
If we didn't exercise, we'd lose muscle. But we have good exercise equipment and nutrition studies to prevent that.  https://t.co/3S5NtGbMim
We've had to move the @space_station to avoid debris. One time it was too late, so we had to shelter in our #Soyuz.  https://t.co/8iegPF3qJR
Like dial-up. If you can remember what dial-up was. https://t.co/1yqMDPSBiR
Yes.  https://t.co/qPZzCA8PNi
We have allergens up here on @space_station just like on Earth. And when the CO2 gets high, it makes it worse.  https://t.co/obd2qY7SLQ
I was interested in it like most kids. It wasn't single-minded goal.  https://t.co/PUb5tlOYwo
We don't do laundry. We throw our clothes away after they are used.  https://t.co/hKlqJH8fEq
I'll be able to walk right away. The better question is: how long will it take for me to run without falling over.  https://t.co/P8Y5ikjZ3T
Use the toilet.  https://t.co/nYthFpjzBm
Thanks! Yes. I have taken photos of Venus and #Mars. Also satellites like #SpaceX and one that was never identified. https://t.co/CEtelgLA0u

Working out in NASA gym in the basement of one of the NASA cottages in Star City. Here's a pic. http://pic.gd/dfe7a0
@spacer01 @StationCDRKelly Let me know people. If you think I am sharing too much of the realities I can share more of the good stuff.
@spacer01 @StationCDRKelly Good point. Not complaining as this job is a privilege. Just trying to show both sides good and bad.
@spacer01 @StationCDRKelly Good point. Not complaining as this job is a privlige. Just trying to show both sides good and bad.
@lmonk232 @stationcdrkelly On your own at times.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Sokol has no helmet, no liquid cooling, is not an anti exposure suit, just to name a few. Works in Soyuz though
http://twitvid.com/5356A - Struggling into my Sokol launch and entry suit prior to my pressuized fit check at the Zvezda facility in Moscow.
@DDAY103 @stationcdrkelly You mean in the T38 or Orion? In the T38 in the back of course.
@ShuttleCDRKelly @StationCDRKelly Whining is when you shuttle guys complain about the variety of food provided in your simuator sessions!
@JimBreitinger @ShuttleCDRKelly @StationCDRKelly) My brother needs a Russian reality check!
@Patti0713 @StationCDRKelly @NASATweetup Now that it moved a few days, I might try and make it down there.
@zippyg2 @StationCDRKelly They put it in storage for several years in case you fly again. Once it expires (5yrs) they use it for trainng.
On 2hr bumpy, fume filled van ride to Zvezda. The company that makes the Sokol pressure suit for my 2hr pressurized pain and boredom eval.
@DDAY103 @stationcdrkelly DDay! Good to hear from you. I'm not sure of the cockpit layout. Been too busy with my own training.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Still here.
@EndeavourLaunch @StationCDRKelly Sure do.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly It's dark in the winter, so I guess people might describe it that way. I've actually grown fond of the place.
@thenasaman @StationCDRKelly They definetly respect the US accomplishments. No US figure rivals Yuri Gagarin however.
Just back from dinner at Cottage 3 in Star City with various expedition crewmember and support staff. Great community her in NASA Russia!
First day of training here in Star City, Russia starting with our Soyuz simulation preperation briefing for our sim tomorrow.
@Space_Flyer_ @StationCDRKelly Ground will uplink them. Getting ready to watch game now on computer from my cottage in Star City. Go Texans!
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Driving here is pretty hazardous, so we leave it to the experts.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly Perhaps. The other thing I was interested in doing was becoming the captain of a US aircraft carrier.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly We had an astronaut get an operation, but you should consult your doctor.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly Of the major airports, its the most confusing in my opinion.
Nice flights, just arrived in Moscow, breezed through passport control and customs (which normally isn't the case) and now, TRAFFIC! Argh!
@astromad @StationCDRKelly I'm the BEST pilot! Dogfighting safely however takes more time than we have to devote to it unfortunately.
London Heathrow has got to be one of the most confusing airports I've ever been to. Getting on connecting flight to Moscow soon.
@ShuttleCDRKelly Looks like that thing, "Balloon Boy," was flying around in! http://myloc.me/15ccR
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Yes. Part of the certification to put people in the new version I'll be flying is to fly changes in progress.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly We've had people have severe nosebleeds prior to flight and got it fixed. No problem.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly I'll probably see the big man. Know him well.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly I think it is snowing. Which means the ground will be covered with muddy slush to step in as I schlep to class.
@ShuttleCDRKelly Isn't that the thing, "Balloon Boy," was flying around in?
Beautiful day in Houston. Haven't seen this weather in 6 months. Unfortunately I can't take advantage of it because I'm on my way to Moscow.
@Swesda1982 @StationCDRKelly @earth A lot. Haven't been briefed yet on approximate dosage.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly Yes, but when you are dogfighting you are much more likely to crash it by accident.
@Space_Pete No. That is an urban legend that military pilots have their own jets. They have one with their names, but fly all of them.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly We fly to prepare us spaceflight. Have to be on the schedule, but can do that same day if jet is available.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly we aren't allowed to dogfight or fly low levels, but we can do aerobatics.
The goal is 15 hours per month. Since I am out of the country some of the time, my time is prorated to something less (about 100hrs/year).
@UnckyJeff Some of them are older than me (mid 1950's manufacture date), but you can't tell the difference between those and the newer ones.
Flew T38 today. Most times when I fly I fly the T38 with the advanced avionics. Here's a video.  http://twitvid.com/5E332
I was my daughters kindergarten show and tell item this morning. Something that started with the letter, "A."
@musicautographs @StationCDRKelly Bill, Mark is the other guy.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly I don't know. I've never seen Node 3.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Russians will do Russian EVAs and US/IPs will do US. Right now no us evas planned.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Quest will never support Russian EVAs even though it was planned at one time. We have two planned Orlon EVAs.
Picture from NBL today. Tried to get some video, but it didn't turn out too well. Next time.  http://pic.gd/5ad9a8
@zippyg2 @StationCDRKelly Training ISS contingency EVA tasks. PFCS and  heat exchanger replacement, and keep alive cable for MBS install.
@Tiffpink @StationCDRKelly More energy used than running a marathon and due to work/gloves/suit pressure, I come out with Quasimodo hands.
@tourmaline1973 @StationCDRKelly That was the intent.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly No real preference. Airlock maybe?  Spent lots of time in there. Node 1 was kind of dark and filled with bags.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly At times. This job isn't always  as glamorous as you might think, but wouldn't trade it for any other.
Picture from yesterday's torture session. Have torture session of another kind today- NBL run.  http://pic.gd/b1440f
Went to gym after medieval torture session. Right leg still worked. What a relief!
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly No plans for that as far as I know. They do have plans for a cargo return capability.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly We will have both an ATV and HTV, several progesses and hopefully a few shuttles.
Science data collection today. Multiple electric shocks put into my thigh muscle had to be like getting tased! As in, "Don't tase me bro."
@Swesda1982 @StationCDRKelly They are very different. Both very comfortable for the designed sitting position.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly I'm sure it would hurt!
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly I did know and yes there is a reason.
Looking at broadcast from ISS on www.onedrop.org. 7PM CST
@Harbles @StationCDRKelly Several minutes and yes, in Star City, Russia.
@flyingjenny @StationCDRKelly Our major offender is ammonia. Bad stuff, like hypergols. Bad stuff equals painful training unfortunately.
@Swesda1982 @StationCDRKelly Shuttle 3gs, Soyuz, upwards of 8 in a ballistic (contingency) entry.
Great thing about being 6yrs old is that when you give up on your half completed Lego motorcyle you can turn it upside down and have a dog.
Making a motorcycle out of Legos. Much more complicated then the ISS Fluid Quick Disconnect class I had today. 6yr old is little help.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly As an ISS crewmember you might have a little influence, but not much. Soon all Soyuz for ISS astros.
@Swesda1982 @StationCDRKelly @astromad I did not know that. Thanks.
@Swesda1982 @StationCDRKelly Good point. Training currency and repetition is important too. So having 3 weeks spread over a is good as well
Doing science base line data collection this week. Spending the next 48 hrs peeing in bottles I have to carry around in a cooler with me!
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly  Thought about it, especially after fellow second grader told me I couldn't be an astronaut because he was  ...
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Don't know. Most test pilots apply when NASA has a call out for applications.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly whichever is next. Luck of the draw.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly in a 2.5 year training flow maybe 20 to 25 weeks.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly one of the nice things about the astro job (besides flying in space) is the variety of the work.
@Swesda1982 @StationCDRKelly I have two more trips to ESA/EAC. My next trip is in a week and a half. 3 weeks in Russia and 1 in Japan.
@Space_Flyer_ @StationCDRKelly I have no idea. Sometime this weekend I think.
@astromad I don't think so, but doesn't mean knowing geography well isn't a good thing.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly Can't hurt, but ESAs working language is English.
@Swesda1982 @StationCDRKelly it was some review, more specialized systems traing, and flight specific payload training.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly We aren't given a geography test prior to becoming an astronaut however.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly We do a lot of Earth observations from low Earth orbit. So geography is essential for that.
@ralphhightower @StationCDRKelly Expedition 26.
@Space_Pete it is.
@astromad not sure what you mean by, "need?"
@astromad I speak Russian at an intermediate level. No additional language requirements to become an astro.
@nasafreak good, a little tired I guess.
@Rep_Giffords I've seen the giant hole in the ground from space!
At Frankfurt airport headed back to Houston for 2 weeks then Russia and Japan. Woo hoo! Pretty good training here this time.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly yes. Keep them coming, Pete.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly I'm happy you can be a more engaged part of the program because being from an ESA partner nation, it is yours.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Pete, There is so much to know as CDR of the space station that I'll take any help I can get.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly News to me. Thanks Space Pete! And I think it was your question if I would fly the rendezvous. Nope. Soyuz CDR.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly I would guess SM aft, but really don't know for sure. You should research that and get back to me, Pete.
Russian Soyuz recently docked to ISS. Crew performing leak checks on the interface between Soyuz and ISS. Should open hatches soon.
@astromad @StationCDRKelly Astromad, study hard, follow your dreams, and reach for the stars!
@astromad @StationCDRKelly Of course! Haven't slept at all.
@EndeavourLaunch @StationCDRKelly I would like that. Maybe the first one or the second!
Big European module test this morning then I return to Houston tomorrow.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly I have not. This week they are not here at EAC in Cologne. They are doing 4 weeks of Russian language somew ...
@Cozmo2009 @StationCDRKelly Thanks for the correction!
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly No problem Space Pete. Thanks for your interest!
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly the years of training and international travel is not appealing to some.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly you have to be medically qualified, but not necessarily have expressed an interest.
Out in Cologne with ESA colleagues where they drink beer by the yard and eat sausage by the meter.  Haven't seen any drindles though.
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly Well aware, but thanks for the reminder anyway!
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly mostly what is called systems, "Specialist," training. Some payload training, but no ATV training this time.
@LettersFrEurope @StationCDRKelly Thanks. I think I was on the A3, but distracted by many cars passing me on the left as I'm doing 100 MPH!
@Space_Pete @StationCDRKelly 1st flight of new Soyuz of the 701 design. Many changes.
Feel like I slept about 30 hours yesterday, so I should be good to go for ESA Payload Training.
Just landed in Frankfurt, Germany. Now have 2 hour drive to Cologne.  http://myloc.me/NcyJ
Headed to Germany for Columbus module training. Not looking forward to the flight!
@ShuttleCDRKelly It's your gadget filled Ford Focus Hybrid at 0 feet, Mach 0.00001, 10,000 degrees F, in Houston?
Had emergency procedures test today. How to respond to fire, depress, and toxic atmosphere. Great training! Hope I never have to use it.
Got ourselves a football game this weekend! Check out Texans and Titans. 31-31 in the fourth quarter.
@DJJASON47 that's amazing. Thanks for the info!
@EndeavourLaunch @StationCDRKelly larger. Now 3 more major modules than when I was last there. By the time I fly, even 3 more. Much bigger.
@zippyg2 @StationCDRKelly unless it was something very minor, like stiches, we would get in the Soyuz and come home. Dr Jen impressed today!
On occasion, ISS crew members will train in hospitals suturing, IV's, etc, today I'm watching my friend Dr Jennifer perform bypass surgery.
Big day at the International Space Station today. Nicole Stott will grapple the Japanese HTV cargo vehicle with the Canadian robot arm.
Flew T38 today. Great day to fly in Houston!
@i_Leslie @StationCDRKelly Nope. Normal off the shelf brand.
@ericmblog @StationCDRKelly yes. Different exercise clothes. They are long use items as well.
@zippyg2 @StationCDRKelly September 2010.
@jetforme @StationCDRKelly No clothes washing. We put them in one of the cargo vehicles to burn up. Good place for week old underwear!
Picked out my 6 month allotment of space clothes today. 1 pair of pants per month, 1 shirt and 1 pair of underwear per week!
RT @Rep_Giffords: Augustine rpt underscores need to fund NASA or risk losing our position as global leader in space http://bit.ly/17LXEU
At dinner with my daughter, space legend George Abbey, and 3 Air France 777 pilots in Houston for layover. Interesting conversation.
@ShuttleCDRKelly @StationCDRKelly You're not kidding!
Texans didn't do too well today, but there's always next week!
Getting ready to watch the Houston Texans beat up on the NY Jets. I have high hopes for the Texans this season!
Watching Notre Dame vs Michigan. Great game!
Great week in space, culminating with safe shuttle landing in California last night.
@impstrump @StationCDRKelly Both languages. Early in the ISS program the mix of Russian and English spoken on ISS was referred to as Rug ...
@Holly_Hickman @StationCDRKelly всё хорошо, but can't say my favorite phrase as its not PC.
The HTV is important to the ISS because, like the shuttle, it can deliver unpressurized cargo to the outside of the space station.
Big day in the space program yesterday. Inaugural launch of the Japanese HTV (cargo ship) and test firing of solid rocket for new us vehicle
Spending the day doing more emergency training, Russian language, and robotics. Looking forward to weekend.
@USMC_Vet Moon might be too close. But, check out the space telescope science institute website- most hubble pics are there.
New Hubble Images from new camera out today. See them at http://tinyurl.com/nrsw8h http://myloc.me/A8zN
