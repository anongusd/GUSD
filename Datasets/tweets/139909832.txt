.@Sasha_Velour: "It's not hard at all to cast the best drag show in the world and not be focused on cis white drag queens." https://t.co/w1m40T01Kd
When you're there, you'll experience drag unlike anything you could ever conceive of, thanks to its diverse cast of performers like @VanderVonOdd, Daphne Always and @NeonCalypso. https://t.co/FAndYPiT1N

Nightgowns is no ordinary drag show. Each month, Sasha Velour curates a collection of performers of all genders, sizes and artistic dispositions to perform whatever drag means to them. https://t.co/sIosSTpDq2

@aaronlmorrison @BrennanCenter "Always be prepared when you‚Äôre working as an advocate for the best interest for your community, which may not be in the interest of United States government. Always be prepared for some type of backlash."  ‚Äî Rakem Balogun	https://t.co/51mLN6onpk https://t.co/hjkvq4V5ot
RT @aaronlmorrison: Here‚Äôs a few behind the scenes shots from our shoot in Dallas for this #MicDispatch segment. Shout out to my colleagues‚Ä¶
@aaronlmorrison @BrennanCenter "You know I‚Äôve lost my job, my apartment, my car, you know, I lost the cohesiveness of my family and my children. And so, you know, every day it‚Äôs just a day of me trying to slowly regain that." ‚Äî Rakem Balogun https://t.co/EfehJLfvUp https://t.co/UoARoIjNnl
@aaronlmorrison @BrennanCenter The police arrested Balogun in a late-night raid on his home, and the event has taken a toll not just on Balogun but also on his family. https://t.co/51mLN6onpk https://t.co/BcX12PcIYI
@aaronlmorrison "The only thing the prosecution had and the FBI had to justify holding him was his political activities and his online rhetoric. And that struck me as an attempt to punish him for his political activity, rather than to protect the public." ‚Äî Michael German of @BrennanCenter https://t.co/Wd3KY2SGiu
@aaronlmorrison Ultimately, the case against Balogun fell apart, and he was released without being charged. Legal scholars are left wondering if the #BlackIdentityExtremist marker justifies racial profiling. https://t.co/KxDb96hyQh
@aaronlmorrison The FBI was worried Balogun would carry out an attack of his own. 		The thing is, they had little evidence to go on besides his social media posts and the fact that he legally owns guns. https://t.co/51mLN6onpk https://t.co/7iGM8DtFhY
@aaronlmorrison When he was arrested, officials referenced a Facebook post Balogun made in sympathy with Micah X. Johnson, who attacked and killed five Dallas police officers in 2016. https://t.co/85b4iXA4RX
@aaronlmorrison Balogun first landed on the FBI's radar when footage of his open carry group, #GuerillaMainframe, was featured on InfoWars.	https://t.co/r0IgyrlZ9w		https://t.co/51mLN6onpk
