@LeToyaLuckett Congratulations Toni and Toya for your precious addition to your family. The best is yet to come in your marriage.
@DrJMcCullough Pastor, you just pressed a bottom in my spirit.
@NeufvilleHarold hey bro what's up?
@NeufvilleHarold @HitFilmOFFICIAL My brother,  where and how did I wrong you?
@itsgabrielleu Am loving this so much. Beautiful. Where has Chris Tucker been?
@TripleH @StephMcMahon 	How often have each of us misspoke in our lives? I am seeking the return of childhood hero Hulk Hogan to the WEE please. He made a mistake that he has paid for enough. Thank you for rethinking this. This man has been my hero and many also.
@StephMcMahon , when does Triple H return to the authority at RAW? He made action really pack.
RT @NFLDraftInsider: Dabo Swinney's message on what's going on in America right now is spot on.  https://t.co/hLD0HpQ7Bk
@itsgabrielleu Lee off course
@Tashiki330 It was a rigged fight.  Manny won all round but the judges watched another bout  tonight and robbed the fans and Manny.
@taya_smith I play Hillsong all day and there has never been a bored time listening. Never have years of joy in worship not been shed. Thank
@marclamonthill Am so sorry for your loss
@ChrisCuomo , man send me that fish next time you catch one and don't want it please my friend.
@IndraPetersons @TeamRubicon @JakeWoodTR Did you leave CNN?
@LanaWWE @RusevBUL It's my first time ever seeing Rusev wear a smile. Thanks for showing a human side.

@BarackObama @MichelleObama The America you led is needful of your leadership once more. Something is openly missing.
@ChrisCuomo that's the hypocrisy of the GOP.  HRC was been hacked and leaked and they celebrated now it's haunting them. Time will tell.
@ChrisCuomo you make me wish I were a journalist.Your passion brings so much interest in every story you cover. Simply put you are the best.
@LaneCox17 @ChrisCuomo nope but I believe in CNN reporting. MSNBC is total liberal while Fox is total  onservative but CNN is neutral.
@mike_favreau @ChrisCuomo nope I don't hate Trump. I hate what Trump stands for. CNN is reliable in reporting and Trump does not like facts.
@ChrisCuomo personally I don't believe any news network other than CNN because of your balanced reporting. People hate CNN because of this
@smerconish why didn't you fact check Chris when he said Trump was opposed to the Iraq war? Trump is liar as Mitt Romney called him.
@mickpatriot @ChrisCuomo how can a man win an election ans cast doubt of fraud over the results?  Did he win a fraudulent election?
@DrJMcCullough hi Bishop McCullough. Peace of God be upon you and Beth Rapha.
@itsgabrielleu when is the next season of Being Mary Jean returning? Atleast that's something refreshing to talk about.
@ABswl16 @angela_rye I didn't accuse you of being racist Tony. I only surmise that you are not sensitive to the situation of black people.
@angela_rye @ABswl16 please don't respond to hate Angela.  Don't answer Tony. He never know what people of color have gone through.
@VanJones68 whatever happened to the show you started with Newt, SE on CNN? I haven't been following recently
@LeToyaLuckett @renees33  I asked about Single Ladies. Is the series over now?
@LeToyaLuckett @renees33 may I join in?
@finda22 hi Finda
@marclamonthill you inspire so many without knowing. Keep doing what you are doing brother.
@LeToyaLuckett Happy Valentine's to you too dear.

@LeToyaLuckett @Ciroc I don't imagine you not deserving it for your many contributions to the world and your community.  Congrats
@IyanlaVanzant I need to come on your show. This right here was for me. Oh you just touched me.
#greatnessawaits2016
God bless America because this nation has opened her arms and heart to the cries of the less fortunate and needy. America will always be ok.
@marclamonthill do people still listen to Trump? GOP today is not the same as the party of Ronald Reagan. Just bunch of haters.
Starting the day with a laugh. Nothing is better than good feeling of yourself. https://t.co/6LaeNJR5LU
@Imeegracia @ChrisCuomo @dfaithelaine @cnnbrk
@tylerperry is there another season of THAHN?
@LeToyaLuckett is there another season of Single ladies coming up?
@Nickidewbear @soledadobrien Nickidewbrar is using one platform to expound on another completely different. When police are wrong let's say.
@Nickidewbear @soledadobrien Soledad, please spend your energy doing what you do best- positive and awesome journalism.  Don't be swayed.
@LeToyaLuckett indeed Latoya He is King. How you doing this morning?
@ChrisCuomo @mzblakbeauty @CNN all Republicans want is a war when there is none to be fought. Obama is a great leader and time will prove it
@finda22 hi
@finda22 hello Finda
@BlessTheMic @LeToyaLuckett someone said once that if your dream doesn't scare you, then it's not big enough. And you just confirmed that.
https://t.co/LZNk5AELFA
@LeToyaLuckett Hi Letoya
@NancyLeeGrahn @deathspool neither do you deserve some of rhe nasty comments here. Someone is not a racist because they said something once
@NancyLeeGrahn @deathspool stop apologizing. You meant no harm. Why I disagree with the platform you used, it in no way make you you racist
@VictorCNN @CNNPolitics Democrats are happy Donald Trump is leading and might likely represent the GOP in the elections next year.
@VictorCNN @CNNPolitics They fought all his bills but offered no alternatives.  Is it that they just hate him or they have better plans?
@VictorCNN @CNNPolitics GOP only react when Obama introduces something like Healthcare, immigration, climate change etc.
@VictorCNN @CNNPolitics Donald Trump is a disaster for GOP. It shows you can't keep attacking Obama and offering no alternatives.
@cnnbrk @cnni police officers are more than servicemen and women. They are heroes and sacrifice a lot for our safety. They are the best.
@CarolCNN @Tania S. &amp; Stella, what does race or black lives matter have to do with what happened?  sheer evil and has nothing to do here.
RT @dat_sparklegal: @JordinSparks you slayed tonight! Truly amazing how you even gave glory to God during your performance! üëèüíï #beyoncewho?
@billgates_s thanks Mr. Gates for following.  I appreciate all your works towards humanity.
@DeVonFranklin thanks to you brother.  Guys like you make me proud to be black.
@DeVonFranklin @davidscottsaun @doc_jay @GoinChar @daynacaddell thanks to you brother. Guys like you make me proud to be black.
@BillGates seriously from poop? Have you tried that first? Anyways thanks for your contribution to the fight against ebola virus disease.
@KristineAz @RevJJackson @rolandsmartin before u accuse ne of spreading lies please Kristine get ur facts straight. He died without blood
@KristineAz @RevJJackson @rolandsmartin Duncan did not receive blood from Brantley.  According to hospital the blood did not match. Read
@KristineAz @RevJJackson @rolandsmartin Brantley has given his blood to the third American for treatment but a Liberian died of the same.
@KristineAz @RevJJackson @rolandsmartin how is it that Dr. Brantley could not donate his blood to the treatment of Liberian Eric Duncan?
@KristineAz @RevJJackson @rolandsmartin I don't see where me or Rev. Jackson implied that Kristine. We were all just hoping he makes it.
@KristineAz @RevJJackson @rolandsmartin Kristine we hope all of us that he survives. Am from Liberia and I know our people are dying daily
@KristineAz @RevJJackson @rolandsmartin I understand there is another experimental drug that they were deciding to use. I hope it helps him
@KristineAz @RevJJackson @rolandsmartin Kristine we are not denying he is being treated but we are just hoping we have the experimental drug
@RevJJackson @rolandsmartin duncan like any human being deserves to be treated. He deserves the right to live.
@RevJJackson @rolandsmartin thank Rev. Jackson for paying attention to a Liberian even though he is not from ur country but he's Human being
Hi Mingo.
@MeaganGood you and hubby make an amazing couple. Much love. God bless
@CarolCNN I think it's just a misstep. I doubt he intentionally did that. America has better things to be dealing with.
@cushconsulting 	I meant to say I moved to the US
@cushconsulting 	Am doing good. Was great hearing from you this morning.  U moved to the US with my family now. Am grateful to God for that
@cushconsulting Hi Wede
We pray for peace in Ferguson tonight. We don't need this. http://t.co/zWDzB0wzXl
http://t.co/8EUxpUiJAo
@tylerperry so proud of you brother. You make me love being black.
@ @BrookeBCNN: Liberia needs the help of the US and International community yo help save our nation.  People are dying daily in our country
Thank God for calm this morning in Ferguson.  In the absence of justice,  peace is an error of judgment.
