@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Sooooo obsessed with Hillary, you are. The biggest real estate deal done in your life is nothing you‚Äôve sold, but what HRC holds in your head.
@Kessol @StanCrenshawTX @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP Yes...this doesn‚Äôt account for the ratio of mass killings, however. Individual gun deaths are down (slightly) where incidents of mass killing have increased significantly.  Again, no answers...just commenting that I feel something must be done. Thanks.
@Kessol @StanCrenshawTX @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP I wish there was an answer that would allow for rights to be maintained and quell the needless violence. I don‚Äôt advocate for more laws or restrictions, but advocate for SOME sort of answers to the ever-growing issue of gun deaths. That‚Äôs about all I can say.
@Kessol @StanCrenshawTX @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP All I can say, is that I don‚Äôt have the answers. That I admit. Jumping fool-hardy in to restrictions on guns is NOT the answer, but right now, we‚Äôre not doing ANYTHING, and more people die every single day. &amp; yes...I know...guns don‚Äôt kill ppl, ppl kill ppl, but it‚Äôs semantics.
@Kessol @StanCrenshawTX @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP Even in private transactions.
@Kessol @StanCrenshawTX @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP Btw...thank you for the POLITE &amp; respectful dialog, even if we disagree.  I appreciate that. Too much name calling and insult lobbing just because ppl disagree. Cheers.
@Kessol @StanCrenshawTX @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP My apologies. I knew that. I think that‚Äôs part of my issue. RULES are tied &amp; must be followed. It‚Äôs not a free for all, willynilly right. IMO, having licensing tied to a GUN, not ownership, is the same type of thing. There are ways to make it work at POS that wouldn‚Äôt demand tax.
@Kessol @StanCrenshawTX @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP That‚Äôs a state decided issue. Depends where you live. It‚Äôs already illegal to transport firearms across state lines (I think), so if a state‚Äôs voters want certain laws, let them decide.
@StanCrenshawTX @Kessol @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP I don‚Äôt have an issue with that, but the entire NRA lobby would, thus it‚Äôll never pass. I think we need gun licenses. That‚Äôs not taxing a right, as the right to own a gun remains unchanged. Just because we add a step in the process doesn‚Äôt mean a right has been usurped.
@Kessol @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP Who said anything about a tax? I strongly support 2A. That doesn‚Äôt mean EVERYONE should own a gun (eg felons, batterers etc). BG checks are at least a step. It wouldn‚Äôt change a lick for anybody who already uses guns legally. Keeps the 2A in tact and offers a check for safety.
@StanCrenshawTX @ScrotieMcP @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP That‚Äôs a problem to me. I fully support the 2nd Am, but I don‚Äôt think 2A means ANY &amp; ALL people can own guns with zero restrictions. We need a license to drive a car, a bus, or plane, yet not to own a gun. Supporting 2A doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt at least license or do bg checks.
@realDonaldTrump says:	- ‚ÄúI believe Mr Putin re: election,‚Äù	- ‚ÄúI take KJ Un at his word Otto,‚Äù		But about U.S. Intelligence, ALL 17 AGENCIES:	- ‚ÄúNah, they‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù	- ‚ÄúAll my critics are liars &amp; fake.‚Äù		Reagan is rolling in his grave. This is the @gop leader folks. 	#GOP #Trump
@DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr So @gop says a wall is needed even if it saves JUST ONE American life, but when it comes to guns, something as simple as licensing or background checks (which wouldn‚Äôt limit anybody who SHOULD be allowed to own a gun), which would save at least ‚ÄúJUST ONE‚Äù American life is not ok?
@faseidl @cutina13 Yeh...I was being a bit hyperbolic, but you are totally right. Even if Trump‚Äôs policies were PERFECT (in some imaginary universe) he is still a despicable human being w/ no compass &amp; 100% investment in self-interest.  It‚Äôs all about the brand to him,  not America.
@faseidl @cutina13 Not all of us. Not even half of us. Just the ENTIRE CONGRESSIONAL BODY, Trump &amp; anyone on his team, his family, and about 33% of the nation. The rest of us are probably ok.
@realDonaldTrump YOU ARE A FUCKING DISGRACE!	Period. 		Article 25, Article 25...wherefore art thou, Article 25?
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs great that the U.S. and DPRK are having talks, but if you treated our allies with as much respect as you treat our enemies (ie the not-so-nice guys who KILL their countrymen), we might BE RESPECTED, and have greater international monies lining our coffers.
@realDonaldTrump Um...you DO know he has already been sentenced, right? How can a reduction in prison time be offered once sentenced, for entirely different crimes, you moron. Oh nevermind...I‚Äôll ask you when you go through it.
@RepMarkMeadows And shit...like Trump is any different. Your blind loyalty to him will be your downfall. And man...did i mention how much of a buffoon you made of yourself today?		Cohen deserves any &amp; all jail time he serves for his actions. He‚Äôs a piece of trash who the system. JUST LIKE TRUMP
@RepMarkMeadows You idiot. The contact wording is was vague, and he openly stated that was the reason. Reread that contract, so you don‚Äôt look like an even BIGGER buffoon.
@RMac18 Um, suspension implies temporary status. So, not permanently suspended, but permanently BANNED!
@Luigipalazzini @ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Beer IS nice.
@ProudResister @ALT_DOJ @realDonaldTrump You know...it‚Äôs absolutely AWFUL that I‚Äôm hoping this is true. How sad is it when anyone is rooting for anything but success for a POTUS. Sadly this man must go. If not for one reason then for another. And until that happens, I will constantly wage that dichotomic war in my head.
@u_go_grls @thistallawkgirl As is my vote. Best ever. Period.
@thistallawkgirl M*A*S*H		Period. 	End of story.	No contest.	Period.		Did I mention M*A*S*H?
@PeterLeoMartin @awoinski @TeaBrat @AOC There‚Äôs no such thing as lies, or the truth, in DC. It‚Äôs ALWAYS somebody else‚Äôs issue or problem because, well, nobody‚Äôs ever wrong in DC.
@TeaBrat @awoinski @AOC Don‚Äôt you mean ‚Äúwho?‚Äù
@techn0cratic @EddieZipperer @AOC Bravo my friend. 	Brah-vo.
@OhNoSheTwitnt @BadAstronomer Yeh...the liberal constituency is a bore. If not for the cult of Trump, what would we fight about? Eggs maybe? Who Bezos is schtupping? I dunno... anything more than remedial escapes me. You know...because some deem me an independent in libtard‚Äôs clothing.  C‚Äôest la vie.
@AOC As if this should surprise us. The @GOP, once the stalwarts of fiscal responsibility &amp; personal rights, has disintegrated in to a cult of Trump. They all (privately, &amp; some publicly) complain about Trump yet are locked in the mode of complacency for fear of a tweet.	#Disgusting
&amp; not that I support this ‚ÄúNew Green Deal,‚Äù (that‚Äôs for another time) but only my opining how out of touch the entire #Trump family is. Trump Sr has apparently derided all manner of low &amp; middle class people behind closed doors. You know, where his base can‚Äôt hear him.	#FuckTrump
Um, I‚Äôm sorry...since when did @IvankaTrump EVER know or intuit what the American people (read, majority being low &amp; middle class) want? While I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs worked hard, the mere fact she believes she understands what ‚Äústruggling‚Äù really is, speaks volumes.	#EntitledChild #Trump https://t.co/flbx6iOko1
Come on @gop. Many of u publicly decry @realDonaldTrump for this ‚Äúemergency‚Äù declaration even saying it isn‚Äôt Constitutional, but u won‚Äôt vote NO for fear of a tweet? R u kidding me? U weren‚Äôt put there to fear a Tweet but to uphold the Constitution, even if It angers Trump.	#gop
@realDonaldTrump Well if that ain‚Äôt the pot calling the kettle black.
@kwalsh120022 @sebasconsultant @Grinnyvon @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump No Kevin...the one mentioned above that has Obama and all his peeps going to jail.
@sebasconsultant @Grinnyvon @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump I think an investigation needs to start...or rather, be proposed before it can even think about its ending.
@wdunlap @ParisDaSavage @realDonaldTrump Let‚Äôs see...how long was the Benghazi investigation?
@Elljay1011 @ParisDaSavage @siano2020 @AOC Are you kidding Ann? She‚Äôs a child, obviously, running some kind of troll acct. @siano2020 must be stoked to know how obsessed this kid is with him. Then again...
@ParisDaSavage @siano2020 @AOC I believe that‚Äôs called hyperbole. You might wanna return to school for that GED.
@ParisDaSavage @siano2020 That‚Äôs the great thing about this country. He can feel the same way about you. 		What‚Äôs your source for his income? Please provide.
I don‚Äôt care about this whole Empire dude thing. While it‚Äôs terrible, and all, this tweet wins the inter webs today. And it made me laugh, so TAKE THAT you pesky internet drama box. https://t.co/sWjXn2t8Gk
@vabuda1 @USATODAY And there it is. You were right!
@eugenegu My guess is that someone took a knee (or two) in his situation too. Sooooo...yeh.
@vabuda1 @USATODAY Hadn‚Äôt heard about it ‚Äòtil I read your tweet, so I haven‚Äôt the foggiest. Do you have a source for this? I‚Äôd be curious to do some digging. Can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs true...not with the inevitable scrutiny that‚Äôs occurring. 		Hopefully Viagra was involved. Wouldn‚Äôt want Deflategate II üòâ
@kylegriffin1 To be fair, he followed that statement with something to the effect of ‚Äúit‚Äôs sad...and I‚Äôm surprised,‚Äù so it was wasn‚Äôt actually a denial. I detest Trump, but this contributes to the reasons why he bashes the media. If you‚Äôre gonna tell the story, tell the WHOLE story. Please.
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump He followed that with something to the effect of ‚Äúit‚Äôs sad,‚Äù so it wasn‚Äôt exactly an accepted denial. 		Wait...did I just defend Trump? Somebody please begin shock therapy on me, as something is drastically wrong.
@vabuda1 @USATODAY There was a list published and photographed, but his was the biggest name on it. IF the list is legit, and there WAS a bigger name involved, then it‚Äôs somebody heavy, and likely wouldn‚Äôt have to do w/ $$, considering Kraft‚Äôs wealth.
@USATODAY Whatya bet he walks with some kind of deferred service sentence, while the other accused men do jail time?
@JohnFugelsang At least Viagra helped prevent another deflategate. 		Too soon?
@TMZ Hopefully Viagra prevented another deflate gate controversy. 		Too soon?
Stolen stats but don‚Äôt remember, hey?
Robert Kraft:		- 2001 Super Bowl Ring	- 2003 Super Bowl Ring	- 2004 Super Bowl Ring	- 2014 Super Bowl Ring	- 2016 Super Bowl Ring	- 2018 Super Bowl Ring	- 2019 Prostitution Ring		I hope he didn‚Äôt use a deflated condom. 		#RobertKraft #Kraft #Busted #Prostitution #Patriots #NFL

@TeaPainUSA ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a matter of time before Fox Entertainment News praises Trump for promotin‚Äô Alex Acosta to Secretary of Labor so he can‚Äôt free any more sex traffickers.‚Äù		Fixed that for ya.
@joncoopertweets Sure seems like it to me but unless that smoking gun is found, or Mueller‚Äôs report has more info than we know, it won‚Äôt happen like you say. There‚Äôll likely be mention, but only a percentage of Americans actually believe this to be true, &amp; history is written on fact, not opinion.
@thecjpearson @Bassmark @JussieSmollett @realDonaldTrump I agree with you on much of this, but Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúvilification‚Äù took little hit from this. He is loved among his base. The Coast Guard guy plotting against Trump‚Äôs hated folks, however, puts the Smollett ‚Äúvilification‚Äù to shame. Just sayin.
@virgini36295706 @DarthSpader747 @TomSteyer Are u kidding? That‚Äôs way too pragmatic. He could LITERALLY admit he colluded w/ Russia, sold nuclear secrets to the Saudis, &amp; paid 10 porn stars hush money, &amp; his base wouldn‚Äôt blink. If looking at historical &amp; known analysis, these people are THE DEFINITION of a cult. Crazy sad
@DarthSpader747 @realDonaldTrump @FBI @CREWcrew @ACLU @splcenter @gracels @renato_mariotti @Ali_H_Soufan @Infantry0300 Which is precisely why I asked my question. It‚Äôs easy to believe what you say to be true, but I want to know the legality and/or responsibility Trump has, by legal definition...not opinion (mine or others). I just can‚Äôt fathom a country where a POTUS is untouchable like this.
@realDonaldTrump Would someone in the legal profession please describe how this is legal? Is it merely because a sitting President can not be charged here or is it a 1st Am issue? I would think if a POTUS avows an entity as an ‚ÄúENEMY OF THE PEOPLE‚Äù it moves beyond 1st Am &amp; in to larger territory.
#Trump is using this REPAIR job, which has been on the books (and funded) since the last administration, to appease his base, implying that he is responsible for the current wall being built. RETWEET so people see this snake oil salesman‚Äôs game. Credit for this goes to #Obama. https://t.co/7q0belyzBv
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett [cough] POT [cough]	[cough] CALLING [cough]	[cough] KETTLE [cough]	[cough] BLACK [cough]		I‚Äôm totally not defending that guy. It‚Äôs an awful thing to do, as mother always used to say, two wrongs don‚Äôt a make a right.
@realDonaldTrump TRUMP SUPPORTERS: This section is a repair. It‚Äôs not new wall nor did Trump have anything to do with it. The repairs &amp; funding were done by his predecessor‚Äôs administration. Don‚Äôt be fooled by this snake oil salesman. He promised a wall &amp; uses THIS to appease? @AnnCoulter said it
@kelly_breck @RPSimoneau @Andy @realDonaldTrump I fully agree with you, but to play devil‚Äôs advocate, the feelings you have are EXACTLY the ones that the right has w/ regards to government $$ going to Planned Parenthood. No issues for me...just sayin.
@realDonaldTrump Ima just leave this right here. https://t.co/AlkuKDRYH8
@realDonaldTrump You moron. There is no clause in the grant that says the deal must stay the same. It doesn‚Äôt even demand trains. As long as track is built by 2022, there‚Äôs no issue. Move on to your next panty wetter.

@marklevinshow @ELLENDIDOMENICO Well, then they‚Äôre not alone. https://t.co/kQIGRolQw7
@realDonaldTrump Um...hey troglodyte...it‚Äôs called FEDERAL COURT, which in the filing states means it is located in California. Do you need everything explained to you, or just the simple stuff? Fucking moron.
@ThreeItalians @kylegriffin1 Among other things.
It‚Äôs not often that I agree with @realDonaldTrump, but when I do it‚Äôs refreshing. So, I admit it. Hey Don...you were right! There was indeed voter fraud. You were right, I was wrong. I admit that. 	#VoterSuppressionIsReal #gop #fraud https://t.co/I6PxaZpTXU
@realDonaldTrump Uh...it‚Äôs a FEDERAL COURT dumbass. It just happens to be based here. Wow. Your ignorance knows no end. And the whole train comment makes you look even MORE idiotic, if that‚Äôs possible.
@ananavarro Not to judge, as the law is the law, but I would be curious how many of the haters did the same before they were 21? I know I sure did. A LOT! It‚Äôs just stupid partisan BS. EVERYBODY needs to just move along. Methinks there are far more important issues than a 20 y.o. drinking.
@sterlingwords1 @Lordpein3497 @EnxRob @SteveScalise @HouseGOP How is that, Lucky? I believe in 2A, but have NEVER heard a Dem say he/she wants guns taken away from law abiding citizens. This one was poorly written: ANYBODY failing a bkgrnd could be reported to authorities, which would harm the privacy &amp; rights of more Americans than aliens.
@raper_tom @SteveScalise @HouseGOP No. Actually, they blocked an amdmt that allowed for ANYBODY who failed a background check to be reported to authorities, which would harm the privacy &amp; rights of WAY more Americans than illegal immigrants. The amdmt needs to be rewritten, that‚Äôs all. Don‚Äôt fall for this spin
@SteveScalise Actually, they blocked an amdmt that allowed for ANYBODY who failed a background check to be reported to authorities, which would harm the privacy &amp; rights of WAY more Americans than illegal immigrants. The amdmt needs to be rewritten, that‚Äôs all. Don‚Äôt fall for this spin.
@aldridtl @Comey I agree, though, I‚Äôm not a Democrat. Not sure why that came in to picture, but whatever.
@WretchedTed Actually, it is emblematic. MASSIVE polarization &amp; divides, the likes of which some would do anything for what they believe is right. I‚Äôve seen it on both sides. I hope this guys goes to jail for his action, just as I would anybody who uses the current divide for personal gain.
@MRitland @POTUS By this statement you do a deservice. If I say ‚Äúyes,‚Äù then quality media orgs get belittled. If I say ‚Äúno‚Äù then the dishonest are legitimized. Do I think the media manipulates? Some do, some don‚Äôt. Most manipulate, but not all. None are perfect, yet ‚Äúmedia‚Äù is necessity.
@peony_morning It was on Breitbart earlier, and has been picked up by Fox and a couple small papers in Alabama. Here‚Äôs one of them. 		https://t.co/J1XhRrRote
@aldridtl @Comey And is now in a Montgomery paper. 	https://t.co/J1XhRrRote
@GOP @aldridtl @realDonaldTrump And yet, here we are in a Republic.
@aldridtl @Comey Not sure about that, as that dude got nailed lying. Read it on Breitbart.
@fletchjustus @HaulinAl @LibertarianBlue @suchaluckygirI Got it. Snopes is useless any more. They used to be ok, but have been disproven many times.  My ONLY point is that nobody should be spoon fed anything, yet too many people take their preferred ‚Äúnews source‚Äù as gospel, w/out their own digging, or waiting for actual corroboration.
@Comey I agree. Yet just recently an Alabama newspaper publisher called for KKK to ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù DC by lynching Dems &amp; Dem Republicans, eluding to similar desires as you, but in a completely reverse (&amp; abhorrent) way. So completely sad that we are this polarized. We may never return.
@BobbyBrimstone @arawilson @LibertarianBlue @AnnCoulter Fucking insane. As you say, ESPECIALLY in the current climate, why would anyone allow themselves to be spoon fed information? That‚Äôs rhetorical, by the way...you and I both know why. Just sayin. 	Hail.
@fletchjustus @HaulinAl @LibertarianBlue @suchaluckygirI Not picking on any of them more than another. I‚Äôm just a news junkie who reads too much. Kinda like knowing all the prices of the same foods at different grocery stores. You gotta know where to shop for individual items. Just sayin.
@fletchjustus @HaulinAl @LibertarianBlue @suchaluckygirI For every example someone gives me of CNN not going to the source, I can find the same on Breitbart, or visa versa. In fact, unless it‚Äôs a Breitbart exclusive, they almost always quote the same wire sources. I‚Äôve read nearly identicle pieces on BB &amp; CNN, just written by diff ppl.
@fletchjustus @HaulinAl @LibertarianBlue @suchaluckygirI Oh, now come on, be fair. Because I look at ALL these sites daily I see the same issues w/ conservative sites. The big guys are often worse than the indie news. Breitbart, CNN, Fox &amp; MSNBC are the worst for this (though with Fox, they‚Äôre not a news service so I get that).
@arawilson @BobbyBrimstone @LibertarianBlue @AnnCoulter No averaging. If it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm interested in I almost always keep digging until convinced I‚Äôve arrived at the truth. Admittedly, that is harder more often than not. These days, WE are the purveyors of truth &amp; it is incumbent upon all people to scrutinize what we‚Äôre fed.
@Bassmark @deepfriedmoray @RyanGirdusky I also commented how I check Breitbart, Fox, CNN, MSNBC &amp; Consevative Treehse DAILY in order to get the whole story. Rather than assuming who ‚Äúpeople like me‚Äù are, try engaging civilly. I mean shit, man, we‚Äôre all Americans &amp; all want the same thing. We just like different folks.
@Bassmark @deepfriedmoray @RyanGirdusky I just posted today on a Coulter thread, of which she ‚Äòliked,‚Äô about how folks on the right generally go straight to name calling &amp; insult, rather than involving themselves in debate or civil response. You‚Äôd be surprised how much further that would go, for you &amp; for Trump.
@PhinStubbs @kausmickey @AnnCoulter Such an apt quote. Perfectly inserted here!
@BobbyBrimstone @LibertarianBlue @AnnCoulter And THAT‚Äôs a point worth noting...	‚Äú...lines are drawn before all the facts are truly known.‚Äù
@deepfriedmoray @RyanGirdusky He‚Äôs screwed w/out them &amp; knows it. I think he knows he‚Äôs in way over his head, especially w/ major positions left empty. To fire them all would leave him alone w/ Ivanka, and lets face it...even a narcissistic egoist like Trump knows when he‚Äôs drowning. He just doesn‚Äôt admit it.
@kausmickey @AnnCoulter Sadly, BECAUSE of our ideological differences we remain too divided to actually hold the Congressional masses accountable in this way. Not to mention it opens the doors for authoritarian leaders. I suppose I‚Äôm living a utopian dream, but damn...I wish it could happen. Some day.
@kausmickey @AnnCoulter It‚Äôs really too bad that voters from the left &amp; right couldn‚Äôt set aside ideological differences for a moment &amp; come together as one mass of AMERICAN CONSCIOUSNESS, which says:	‚ÄúWe are the power not politicians. We are who matters. We want change &amp; are making it NOW! üñï‚Äù	Sad.
@kausmickey @AnnCoulter I‚Äôm sorry I missed this the first time, but I could not agree more with this entire article. Whether you bleed red or blue, the fact is, we are all Americans. Add to that factual stats which illustrate the majority of ppl feeling the same way &amp; it becomes a powerful statement.
@lemonsandcocon1 @AnnCoulter @anntensity As I reread your tweet, that might not have been your intent with the word ‚Äúreserved.‚Äù My apologies if I took your words out of context.
@lemonsandcocon1 @AnnCoulter @anntensity Certainly doesn‚Äôt nor should  it instantly demand generalization but has been my  experience on Twitter. I love polite, civil, heated debate but so often must exit a thread due to insults simply because I offer an opinion that doesn‚Äôt fall in line w/ the right; rarely on left.
@lemonsandcocon1 @AnnCoulter @anntensity I believe much of ur statement, as is evident by electoral votes of 2016. What I disagree w/ is the reserved part. More often than not I‚Äôm met with instant name calling &amp; insults from the right when I attempt debate whereas those on the left have shown me more desire for debate.
@fosterbr2013 @angusparvo @HaulinAl @LibertarianBlue @suchaluckygirI In actuality, ALL media outlets put their own spin on content. As I noted above, you could read 4 different articles on the same topic from 4 different outlets, &amp; get 4 different sets of ‚Äúfacts,‚Äù w/ each outlet claiming their info is the ‚Äúcorrect info.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just BB, but all.
@HaulinAl @LibertarianBlue @suchaluckygirI SHOULD, being the optimal word. Every media outlet has its own ‚Äúspin.‚Äù Reading articles about the same topic from 4 different outlets might yield 4 different sets of ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù I wish it was easy enough to get straight info/news with no spin, but it‚Äôs not. At least in my opinion.
@LibertarianBlue @AnnCoulter TOTALLY agree. Though I get tons of flack from the left &amp; the right, I read Breitbart, CNN, FOX, MSNBC &amp; Conservative Treehouse every day. I too believe that in order to know the entire story one must understand the rhetoric on both sides. May not be ur thing but it works for me.
@Pablo_Chihuahua @Scientology Says the CEO of a publishing company which has released exactly ONE book, with nearly half of the whopping 10 ‚Äútedious‚Äù reviews being 1‚≠êÔ∏è. You sure showed that @ChurchofSatan with your wit &amp; success. Thanks for the laugh.
@realDonaldTrump Good holy moses on a popsicle stick. You are the most childish piece of shit this world has ever seen. No president should speak like this. Think about? Sure, but he or she should be above all this petty nonsense. Then again, I suppose if you weren‚Äôt scared, you wouldn‚Äôt tweet.
@realDonaldTrump Damn...I wish you would SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!
@AolCRAFT @atrupar Wait...it‚Äôs not?
@ghollovary @StandUpRepublic @realDonaldTrump Okie dokie then...I‚Äôm done. Thought there was a chance for a bit of civil debate. Apparently not. Sad. Very sad.		...aaaaaand muted.
@ghollovary @StandUpRepublic @realDonaldTrump &amp; there is great irony when comparing ur responses to ur #MAMA hash- which I happen to fully agree with. Morality is subjective, but name calling &amp; keyboard warriorness is just petulant &amp; sad, and does NOTHING for improving this country. Whether u like it or not we are brethren.
@ghollovary @StandUpRepublic @realDonaldTrump And FWIW, as a lawyer, I can tell you that none of this is anywhere close to sedition or treason. Those words have become subjective opinions of those on both the far left and the far right. I suppose it matter not...free speech protects more than you will admit. Be well.
@ghollovary @StandUpRepublic @realDonaldTrump Why is it that any time I respond politely, Trump supporters immediately begin the name calling? I didn‚Äôt insult you, nor did I insinuate such. I posed both a question &amp; made a statement, which, again, was not retaliatory or an attack on you. Why is civil debate not ok?
@ghollovary @StandUpRepublic @realDonaldTrump Uh...you mean like how Trump pushed the narrative of his predecessor being born outside the U.S., only to say he was wrong two years later?		Freedom of speech is for everyone, not just those you side with.
@StandUpRepublic @realDonaldTrump Sadly, millions of Americans DO have a place for it.
@LynnePatton @maggieNYT @instagram Since you work in housing, it is fitting that Ms Haberman takes up so much real estate in your brain.	-	Sad, that yet ANOTHER Trump administration member represents herself so flippantly in the public realm.

@HowardNybx @DesignationSix @nytimes AWESOME quip! I lol‚Äôd!	-	But seriously, I‚Äôd like to know how CNN &amp; MSNBC (&amp; NPR/NYT) are on the right? Not trolling u nor do I have ulterior motives. I‚Äôm tying to...I mean, he‚Äôs trying to understand how ur comment is true. You know...so HE knows the ingredients in ALL Kool-AIDs.
@FaceTheNation @IvankaTrump And by ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù @IvankaTrump means ‚Äúwhatever floats daddy‚Äôs boat.‚Äù Also includes, but not limited to:	-separating kids from parents @ borders	-lying	-committing treason	-lying	-building walls	-lying	-attacking media	-lying	-hiding financials	-lying	&amp; general complicity
@powerofpain @NERVEmberProj Having gone through COUNTLESS injections, nerve implants, reconstructive surgeries &amp; more, what WOULD WORK BEST is if politicians w/ law degrees would stop legislating what dr can/can‚Äôt give me, &amp; the ‚Äúright‚Äù prescribing dose. We ALL have INDIVIDUAL CASES w/ no cookie cutter fix.
@HowardNybx @DesignationSix Curious...how do CNN &amp; MSNBC represent the right, other than being owned &amp; funded by billionaires? Their content certainly isn‚Äôt on the right, which lends to the ideology of being center-left. Asking for a friend.

@OversightDems Sooo...the million dollar question is:	WHAT WILL BE DONE AS THE RESULT? Sadly, if this is true, the answer is:	NOTHING.
@AshaRangappa_ @JoyceWhiteVance Don‚Äôt forget Clinton. It‚Äôs all her fault anyway.
@JoyceWhiteVance Not surprisingly, this won‚Äôt matter a lick to the cult of Trump.
@AuntTre @Deeenst @Katamac1967 @Surgeon_General Nah...that would be way too pragmatic.
@PhinStubbs @realDonaldTrump I just want to see our $$ spent in a smarter way. Doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt spend &amp; shouldn‚Äôt help other countries, but man...our kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids‚Äô futures will be leveraged in to poverty if we don‚Äôt get this under control. I think u &amp; I are on the same page. Cheers man.
@AuntTre @Deeenst @Katamac1967 @Surgeon_General This is what angers me the most- politicians deciding prescription dose. We don‚Äôt let surgeons make laws, so why should the reciprocal be true? Every cpp I know counts the number of pills in the container multiple times a month; WE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM, but are the ones suffering.
@TheDemCoalition It‚Äôs been deleted. Would love a screenshot.
@krassenstein Nice to know we have a president who values the contents of the Constitution... you know...like the 1st Amendment n‚Äô stuff. 	[/sarcasm]
@funder We do. I just wish he wasn‚Äôt working for the Russians.
@MYOATHASAVET You too my man. And remember...always forward, never back.
@PhinStubbs @realDonaldTrump But he‚Äôs not doing anything to counter that spending trend.
@PhinStubbs @realDonaldTrump Um...I believe you need to revisit those numbers. I won‚Äôt defend the 09 issue, as I didn‚Äôt have a better solution considering we were about to bottom out w/ the recession, but even Clinton had a surplus. It‚Äôs never ONE presidents fault, as it‚Äôs linked to decades of overspending..
@MYOATHASAVET And FWIW, as someone who battles depression &amp; lives in chronic pain after 5 spinal reconstructions, I am confident that the changes in treatment &amp; prescriptions are NOT the changes we need. I want the best for service members...AS A PRIORITY!	#WeMatter
@MYOATHASAVET I just want to see better treatment of our men &amp; women who volunteer their lives for the U.S. It is too long needed &amp; always seems to take a back seat to issues like immigration, foreign pol etc. We MUST be able to multi-task &amp; get some1 at the head of DoVA who can affect change.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse ‚ÄúReviewing the funding bill with my team of blathering idiots &amp; yes men at the @WhiteHouse!‚Äù	- -	Fixed that for you.
@realDonaldTrump Cliff Notes don‚Äôt count as reading.
@WhiteHouse How is sending BILLIONS of dollars to other countries, when our deficit is over $22Tr (the highest in history) keeping his promise of ‚ÄúAmerica First?‚Äù Or going back on his promise to never again sign a bloated bill like this? Asking for a friend.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Why did ‚Äúthe POTUS‚Äù sign this bloated bill which sends BILLIONS to other countries, when he promised an ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù ideology? Does he realize the deficit is over $22Tr, the highest in history? Asking for a friend. Would appreciate an answer, unless you‚Äôre eating a sandwich.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Um, it‚Äôs not about circumventing ‚Äúthe Election,‚Äù it‚Äôs about the identification &amp;  action taken FOR OUR COUNTRY when a ‚Äúpresident‚Äù is unfit for office. Besides, if you weren‚Äôt scared the House &amp; Senate  might actually vote ‚Äúyeh‚Äù on this, you wouldn‚Äôt tweet about it. Just sayin‚Äô.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äù rarely speaks. It‚Äôs more like a babble, a blather, or a burble.
@realDonaldTrump In 2020 I‚Äôm pretty sure the new Democratic President is going to declare a national emergency because of the YUGE rise in mass shootings we‚Äôve seen here. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right, but that little box Pandora gave you should have stayed sealed. And I do believe in 2A. Just sayin.
@realDonaldTrump You do know we have a border, right? A wall doesn‚Äôt make a border. A wall is a wall. A border is a delineating line. Then again, I‚Äôm tweeting to a man who said:	- I didn‚Äôt have sex with a porn star	-Obama was born in Africa	-Mexico will pay for the wall	-I won‚Äôt have time to golf
@realDonaldTrump Apparently not!
@realDonaldTrump And please...stop lying to the public. You know as well as I do that trade tariffs are not ‚Äúpaid to the United States,‚Äù but added to the cost of goods, right? The country (US gvt) doesn‚Äôt make a single dollar on tariffs. Asking for a friend.
@realDonaldTrump Why did you sign the bi-partisan bill on Friday, sending BILLIONS of dollars to other countries, when you said you wouldn‚Äôt sign another one, following the EPIC C/R you signed last year? You do know our national debt, over $22Tr, is the highest in history, right?
@realDonaldTrump ‚Äú...The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe.‚Äù	.	OOHHHHHHHHHH...so THAT‚ÄôS why you announced a pull-out of our troops in Syria (without consulting DOD officials). The only pull-out that SHOULD have occurred is your father‚Äôs.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Wow...2+ years out and you‚Äôre STILL hung up on Clinton. Methinks you have a crush. Ya might wanna consider therapy for that.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Man, Ihope so. But then again, it certainly wasn‚Äôt harassment when @realDonaldTrump claimed over &amp; over, FOR YEARS, that his predecessor was born in Africa, before admitting he was wrong? Man, your lack of attention to facts is stunning. And ur false equivalencies are even worse.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @nytimes That‚Äôs funny, @TomFitton, I didn‚Äôt see any reference to the word ‚Äúscamming‚Äù in the article. Isn‚Äôt it considered ‚Äúfake‚Äù if someone constructs a false narrative to already established facts? Hmm...I thought so.
@realDonaldTrump I guess I didn‚Äôt realize your golf course had such tremendous cell range.
@realDonaldTrump Just so you know, if you were to swap the word ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù with the word ‚ÄúRepublicans,‚Äù you would have a perfect description of how the @gop treated your predecessor‚Äôs nominations. 	[cough]Garland[cough] &amp; [cough]others[cough]	#TrumpIsFakeNews
@realDonaldTrump More ‚Äúalt-facts.‚Äù Though, to be fair, the source of your statistics is an alt-right news organization, so, at least you‚Äôre ALTways consistent. Consistently using fake numbers.
@realDonaldTrump And, fwiw, there‚Äôs plenty o‚Äô funny in all of it. The only UN-FUNNY thing is the despicably chasmic rift you sow between American citizens. Now THAT is what is not funny. Just sayin‚Äô.
@realDonaldTrump Um, you do know that the 1st Amendment applies to everyone, right? Not just his holiness Donny. It saddens me that an ‚ÄúAmerican President‚Äù openly says the gvt must investigate something that is so obviously a free speech issue. Even a Trump supporter should stand up to this. Sad.
@realDonaldTrump It saddens me to no end that not only do you believe this, but that your inciting of this type of thinking, to millions of uneducated Americans, is causing a chasm of polarity the likes of which this country has never seen. SOME news is fake, but not the broader media in general.
@realDonaldTrump Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever say this, but you‚Äôre right! You‚Äôre right, when you say, ‚Äúnobody‚Äôs done the job.‚Äù That ole wall of yours is nowhere &amp; looks to be going nowhere. So, I‚Äôll say it again...YOU‚ÄôRE RIGHT!		I was so excited I agreed w/ you, I had to tweet this twice!	#TreasonWeasel
@realDonaldTrump Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever say this, but you‚Äôre right!  You‚Äôre right, when you say, ‚Äúnobody‚Äôs done the job.‚Äù That ole wall of yours is nowhere &amp; looks to be going nowhere, fast. So, I‚Äôll say it again...YOU‚ÄôRE RIGHT!
@ColoradoParaMan It‚Äôs despicable to hear these stories, of any kind. Our Vets, even those w/ no physical injuries, r treated like 2nd class citizens; they do their service &amp; once discharged are thrown away as if burdens. I‚Äôm not saying they should inherit a castle, but come on #Trump.	#WeMatter
@time4kind @TheGoodGodAbove @smsg1234 Maybe the 243 is in the English hundredweight system?!?
@joncoopertweets And yet he has a 44% approval rating. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs more despicable. His actions, or those of the 44%.

@jemelehill @GoLiveLifeWell Um, settled means nothing. No terms were issued &amp; no finances will ever be known. Unless things have changed since this morning. I would have ‚Äúcolluded‚Äù too, as someone using their place of employment for political means is not someone I would hire. Regardless of talent.
@realDonaldTrump Your father should have ‚Äúpulled back‚Äù too.
@jiveDurkey @RepDonBeyer ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take cheese, ham, cheese, sausage, cheese, pepperoni, &amp; cheese. Oh, would u put some cheese on top as well? And oh, did Lolita bring u ur new green card? She told me they just finished printing another 100 of ‚Äòem. U know, just in case someone asks to see it.‚Äù
@GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos @jimmy_dore Goodness. The last thing we need is nationalization of private industry. These utilities are bloated as it is, which is liability enough. Look at PG&amp;E‚Äôs bankruptcy in CA. NOW...if the US could nationalize gvt owned sustainable energy &amp; utilities, that would be a different story.
@Orgleader @justinamash Annnnnd...that‚Äôs enough for me. I‚Äôm happy to answer questions w/ civil debate, but care not to involve myself with name calling for the single reason of disliking Trump. Sad...very sad. If u change ur mind, &amp; wish for civil discourse, I‚Äôm happy to progress. Cheers.
@Orgleader @ERahmanPhoto @msdeb903 @justinamash Again, what is both sad &amp; laughable is the amount of assumption u put behind a single tweet. I am a proud independent libertarian. I did not use the word hate nor did I mention whom I supported. Those are items u decided were true. Grow up a bit &amp; have dialog rather than hate.
@Orgleader @justinamash In case u need a refresher, this country was founded on dissent. The Constitution was written with that notion in mind- that not everyone would or SHOULD agree with one ideology. To believe otherwise is in fact the antithesis of democracy.
@Orgleader @justinamash Were you anti-Obama? If so, then following your logic, u my friend are the hypocrite. I ALMOST feel sorry for u that u feel attacks &amp; insults are the way to go. We are ALL Americans &amp; should agree to disagree, respectfully. Not attacking.
@Orgleader @justinamash Um, why in the world must one conform to a single ideology? Unless of course you‚Äôre from N Korea. Sad that people believe those who don‚Äôt agree w/ them are traitors/unpatriotic. Not liking a person has nothing to do with democracy, other than it exemplifies the ideals of America.
@justinamash If doing so turns the Constitution on its head, wouldn‚Äôt that be righting it, since Trump flipped it by making the #NationalEmergencyDeclaration? Somebody‚Äôs gotta do something. He wasn‚Äôt out there to legislate and/or appropriate.
@justinamash Wow. Absolutely perfectly stated. Now...what are you gonna do about it, ‚Äòcause the way I see it, the president has already overstepped, here.
@MichaelAvenatti I don‚Äôt understand Ebonics, but someone might also want to explain that men do not have menstrual cycles.
@mjbordeaux67 @AnnCoulter @charliekirk11 I agree.
@kryskilo @TheDemocrats Ironically, u could replace @TheDemocrats w/ @GOP &amp; more than half the country would agree. It actually sucks that we have become so polarized &amp; lost the ability to debate differences civilly. THAT will be our downfall. Not a party, not a president, but our inability to listen.
@Chango6foot8 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Sounds good to me. Hell...anything that gets that piece of garbage out of office works for me.
@TheRightMelissa @Michael2Turner @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson You‚Äôre constructing the facts to fit the narrative. The true narrative actually SUPPORTS the facts, and allows for 25 to be used in multiple means. Or did you miss that day in law school where arguments were litigated for the purpose of illustrating this very point? I didn‚Äôt.
@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Actually, as a lawyer, I can tell you it is not. Better put something on...your bias (and lack of legal knowledge) is showing.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Not when it‚Äôs a legit issue, due to a ‚Äúman‚Äù being in office who is just fucking nuts. That‚Äôs the reason 25 was created. Actually, YOU‚ÄôRE the reason why 25 was created. You‚Äôre obviously feeling doubtful of yourself, or you wouldn‚Äôt be all whiny about it. That‚Äôs kind of your thing.
@DineshDSouza @danielledsouzag @foxandfriends Really? Seems like a universal issue OUR nation has right now. The fringes of both left &amp; right resort to incivility, name calling, &amp; general disrespect. How anybody can blame it on one party is beyond me, &amp; they‚Äôre either completely moronic or so biased that nothing matters.
@AnnCoulter Why is everybody complaining, saying it‚Äôs over? It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll vote for a Dem in 2020, which means nothing has changed for him. He‚Äôll still get the votes.
@mjbordeaux67 @AnnCoulter @charliekirk11 @mjbordeaux67 like you‚Äôd vote for anybody else on the ticket. So the way I see it, it this occurs, you‚Äôre not casting a vote for Pres in 2020?
@mkraju Wait, u mean @SenToomey is upset about something the @gop has been doing since it took the House &amp; Senate (w/ the House being flipped due to the abhorrent posture of the #gop)? If this isn‚Äôt the pot calling the kettle black. Doesn‚Äôt make it right. Congress needs to WORK TOGETHER!
Boy...if I didn‚Äôt know any better, I‚Äôd say @tedcruz was at this pro-Nazi rally at MSG, even if it was 1939. Grandpa Rafael maybe? Judge for yourself, at 0:15.	#NaziPunksFuckOff #TedCruz		https://t.co/QTPluzEvaa
@funder That, or they‚Äôre with Khashoggi, for safe keeping.
@funder Do you REALLY need to ask this?
@DonaldJTrumpJr It CAN be proven, however, of ur ties to Baltic Intl Bank, which, as u know, was caught laundering $ for the Mexican cartels, &amp; has ties to Prevezon Holdings, you know, the Russian Magnitzky folks. I cannot WAIT until u become Bubba‚Äôs bitch during lock down. Don‚Äôt drop the soap!
@TheRealJohnHCox I guess u missed the days he was out talking to us Californians, in places like DMV, EEOC, &amp; others. Not to mention the urban housing boards, where he spoke about the need for affordable housing. Considering it‚Äôs been &lt; 3 months, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs doing ok, &amp; ur just sour grapes.
@Barbaradye921 Regardless, if you haven‚Äôt done so already, look up the Fl Dept of Ed website. There should be all the forms you need to help start the process the way THEY say, while you do the rest of your contacting. GO BIG GO BIG GO BIG! This is unacceptable, Dem or Rep. Good luck to you!
@Barbaradye921 ...Ed Practices Commission, State Board of Ed, &amp; u could make a case this is discrimination, in which case u can contact DOE Office of Civil Rights. Most states have a procedure for filing institutional complains, but you should GO BIG on this one, telling them u mean business.
@Barbaradye921 Oh, and the state credentialing dept, county office of education, local education governing board, Fl Dept of Ed, Bureau of Professional Practices Services, Division of Public Schools, Commission For Independent Ed, Education Practices Commission, Ethics In Education Act board...
@Barbaradye921 Not to mention setting up a meeting w/ the principal &amp; teacher (together), go to the school superintendent‚Äôs office (no phone call/email), contact state superintendent, contact the ACLU, etc. Go big! Does your district have an ethics board? Contact teacher‚Äôs union. GO BIG!
@Barbaradye921 RAISE HELL, that‚Äôs how you address this.
@TitusNation I thought this was a riddle, but the answer was clear all along.
@RepDeSaulnier So...WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? I think today‚Äôs politicians believe firing off a tweet is their action taken against specific policies. Tweets are all well and good but they mean nothing. We want actions, especially from our CA Reps. What actions are you taking in this?
@USMC Hey @AnnCoulter while you‚Äôre tweeting about rap, how about this one, from the mighty USMC?
@AnnCoulter @MarkSimoneNY Wait... no more tweets about rap? Have you run out of material already?
@BigLots That‚Äôs because we have a BIIIIIIG President.
@IGD_News @LindaKWS1 @JoeyRockstone @DavidNeiwert Opposed to fracturing together?
@PhinStubbs @the24fan @RepRoybalAllard @DanCrenshawTX To ur point, it‚Äôs a GREAT idea for MOC to travel/see high traffic areas of illegal crossing, film, &amp; show American public. Actual (unedited &amp; true) facts on film don‚Äôt lie...people do. Not calling Crenshaw a liar, but am cautious in all approaches. Equal # of folks say opposite.
@PhinStubbs @the24fan @RepRoybalAllard @DanCrenshawTX So was Gen Flynn, who admitted to lying (though I won‚Äôt debate the merits therein). My only point, &amp; one I believe I‚Äôve made abundantly clear, is that barriers in high target areas are good, in combo with tech. We still need legislation &amp; can‚Äôt bind so much debt for one band-aid.
@PhinStubbs @the24fan @RepRoybalAllard @DanCrenshawTX Sounds like one of those places that added or expanded barriers is needed...IF indeed that is what occurred. I take EVERY news report like this w/ a grain of salt until I see it with my own eyes. Especially from elected officials.		...and btw nobody from here calls it ‚ÄúCali.‚Äù  üòâ
@ParisDaSavage It saddens me that people such as @parisdasavage even exist, as the ignorance displayed is laughable at first, but turns sad, quickly. Uneducated, judgmental, biased, imbecilic, troglodytes who are keyboard warriors contribute nothing to the human race or greater good.  Just sad.
@siano2020 Why it‚Äôs even in question illustrates just how blind &amp; bigoted this country STILL is. Only when discussions of a person‚Äôs sexuality are nonexistent, will we know we have reached a place of equality. Hopefully it will happen in my lifetime.
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard Agreed. People must NEVER FORGET that disagreements are commonplace &amp; inevitable. The minute knuckleheads jump in w/ insults, the process stops. The same goes in Congress. No side will have total victory so they must LISTEN &amp; work toward best medium w/ blasting insults. Be well.
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard It is minuscule, in aggregate. Don‚Äôt get me started on ‚Äúless beds.‚Äù .  They‚Äôre going the wrong way with that. I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around what seems like a poor use (&amp; knee-jerk) of that much $$. I‚Äôd like to see a compromise that includes $$ for barriers in specific areas.
@the24fan @jontweetRVA @RepRoybalAllard Oh goodness @the24fan my truest apologies. I use ‚Äúman‚Äù in an almost constant state of colloquial addressüòâI need to tag u or something, as most of my responses are to you, other than than the two to the person I muted. You‚Äôre obviously well spoken even if we don‚Äôt share all ideas
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard Lol...you were never muted. I won‚Äôt listen to folks who have responses solely meant to insult. 		I don‚Äôt blame Trump for this either, nor do I blame Obama. This is a decades old issue, one so complex that it takes energy, analysis, &amp; bi-partisanship the likes we‚Äôve never seen.
@the24fan @jontweetRVA @RepRoybalAllard Not you, man. That was for the knucklehead who called me stupid. You‚Äôve been incredibly respectful, and well spoken. I greatly appreciate that, and would debate with you ANYTIME!!!
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard And thanks again for this debate. I respect people who offer respect, including those who ideologically disagree with me. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúfighting‚Äù you, nor do I expect you to adopt my stances, but I don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt disagree, but remain civil. WE ARE BOTH AMERICAN!!!
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard ...to determine EXACTLY how $$ should be dispersed. Some for ‚Äúsmart‚Äù tech, some for improved and/or new barriers, expanded border patrols &amp; support, etc.  my greatest fear is that we‚Äôll go further in debt for this wall, &amp; immigration reform will stop (which it will).
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard ...we MUST hold Congress‚Äô feet to the fire in finding long-needed immigration reform. Both sides need to give, which means nobody will be happy, but we can‚Äôt just build a wall with $$ we don‚Äôt have &amp; walk away. Dumping that kind of cash necessitates planning...
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard ...but we simply can‚Äôt keep spending spending spending! Raising the debt ceiling will be necessitated &amp; we just can‚Äôt do that. If the $$ is going to get offered any way, then I think we need a combination of ‚Äúband-aids‚Äù not just a $6B wall. Then...and MOST IMPORTANTLY...
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard Ideologically, I fully agree. I am MUCH more fiscally conservative, however, and this administration is spending money like we have it. I‚Äôm not the person who has answers, but a simple guy living in Southern California, so I see this daily. Yes...over time, a wall pays off...
@jontweetRVA @the24fan @RepRoybalAllard Did u read my responses? Obviously not. I love debating respectful folks, who are open for dialog, but not folks like you...who don‚Äôt ask questions but skip straight to the insults. Mute...ON.
@PNWDeplorable @falfans @RepRoybalAllard Actually, that‚Äôs far from true. There have been countless examples of actual citizens being picked up and held in lock down, only to find out that they ARE indeed law-abiding citizen immigrants. That‚Äôs why I asked for clarification.
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard So yeh...barriers in strategic areas, smart tech, new immig legislation...a combination of what Dems, Reps, &amp; Trump want, w/out our kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids being owned by the debt we are RAPIDLY ACCUMULATING! The @gop ONCE was a party of fiscal responsibility. NOT ANY MORE.
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard ...and @jontweetRVA gave a ‚Äútypical mad Repub‚Äù response w/out asking the (sensible) question u did (I thank u for that). Land sake‚Äôs John...don‚Äôt we have enough infighting in the U.S. w/out keyboard warriors like u dropping insults automatically? We ain‚Äôt fightin each other.
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard ...meaning, until we fix our Congressional system of laws surrounding immigration, it will remain broke.  Besides...do u have any idea how many ppl enter via Florida and other water ways? Spending $6B won‚Äôt touch this. We need a mix of smart tech, &amp; barriers is high traffic areas
@the24fan @RepRoybalAllard Actually, I do, but I think we need a bigger fix than spending $6B on ‚Äúthe wall,‚Äù &amp; we all know it won‚Äôt be anywhere NEAR that low. A wall is a band aid on a broken system, like taping a cracked heating hose. It might be taped, but it‚Äôs still cracked. This is systemic...
@LeighEPS @matthewjdowd Um...no. Because typical primaries get ‚Äúbloody‚Äù and OP is eluding to an attempt to not fuel any fires the incumbent will inevitable launch. Just because you‚Äôre conservative doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt understand what an opponent might do.
@GavinNewsom I am a lifelong California; nearly five decades. I oppose this, as you say, monument to himself.
@RepRoybalAllard I‚Äôm a Californian, if that matters, but it‚Äôs a serious question. There is a bit of context missing, depending on what she was speaking of, as media continually states she means ‚Äúillegal immigrants,‚Äù so I‚Äôm offering her the chance to clarify. Though I doubt I‚Äôll get a response.
@jeffbezos078 To me, adultery of any kind is abhorrent, as it hurts the other spouse in ways an adulterer can‚Äôt (or won‚Äôt) understand, but I hope u DESTROY  this trash. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business who or what a private citizen does. Political leaders? Another story but not private citz. Keep it up!
@patriotdg @butterflyrobinK Because $6B for one thing won‚Äôt fix immigration, especially when so many enter via Florida or other waters not affected by a wall. The system is broken &amp; must be fixed. Even Dems understand that. They just don‚Äôt want their kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids stuck w/ the $$ Reps r spending.
@RepRoybalAllard Please clarify. You say ‚Äú..not law-abiding immigrants who r contributing to our country....‚Äù Do u mean illegal immigrants, or immigrants who are here LEGALLY? While I abhor what‚Äôs occurring right now, &amp; don‚Äôt want a wall, if people are here illegally, they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlaw-abiding.‚Äù
@FOXLA I wish more ppl in leadership roles would do this. If you‚Äôre caught doing something you shouldn‚Äôt, then admit it...take your lumps &amp; do what is necessary, incl possible resignation. If you DIDN‚ÄôT do something, then fine...stay the course. But if you did, then take responsibility.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/CjRshkZIxj
@AdamMKaufman I despise Donal Trump	#treasonweasel		[That hashmark only counts as one word. Just sayin‚Äô.]
@PalmerReport @suzie462 I abhor Trump. I‚Äôve never despised a person as much as I despise him, &amp; think he‚Äôs harmful to the US, but THIS is a stretch, even for u. Sooo many false equivalents &amp; incongruencies it only adds to ‚Äúfake news‚Äù claims. We hate him but what do u take us 4? We‚Äôre not like his cult.
@realDonaldTrump Wow...just mind blowing. Having a strong opinion is something I respect, even if it means disliking someone. But to see a president disparage &amp; delegitimize one of the saddest &amp; most cruel events on American soil EVER, is beyond words to me. THIS is precisely why he must go.
@GOP @tedcruz What‚Äôs staggering is Cruz‚Äôs loss of his independent thought &amp; personal morality. He‚Äôs nothing more (now) than a personal spittoon for the president, as he stays silent amidst the words &amp; deeds he used to rail about. But nooooo...he would never DARE speak out about Trump‚Äôs antics.
@Dr_Woga In this particular case, I agree w/ you, but morals &amp; morality are nothing but SELECTIVE RUBRIC, often forced on those who otherwise disagree. Again, my opinion is that this lil guy knew he was provoking, but we must protect against disproportionate &amp; forced subjectivity.
@matthewjdowd The art of the impossible becomes possible if and only when creative &amp; critical examination of dreams is awoken. Dream the impossible so that it may BE possible.
@matthewjdowd Never mind Virginia, how can @gop stand for @realDonaldTrump literally WREAKING praise for the DPRK &amp; it‚Äôs leadership? I mean, come on. This is not the #gop of yesterday nor should it be the one of tomorrow. Virginia is but a pebble in a quarry compared to this -though abhorrent.
@realDonaldTrump What in hell‚Äôs fuck are you talking about? This is not a ‚Äúswitch‚Äù that can merely be turned but an entire system of oppression dating back DECADES. If you support this, then you &amp; @RealCandaceO have much more in common than I thought. The @gop should be ashamed. Reagan would cry.
@PeebsY0 @MuslimIQ Not to mention, here, @RealCandaceO would‚Äôve  fallen victim to the Aryan ideology she is so apparently supportive of. The narrative of ‚Äúnationalism‚Äù is quickly becoming the narrative of hate. I‚Äôm all for pride in one‚Äôs country, but nationalism works at the expense of others.
@PeebsY0 @MuslimIQ EXACTAMUNDO. While the word hypocrisy is overused in our modern political dialectic it is darn near laughable (actually, incredibly sad) at the  level of demonstrated hypocrisy, &amp; by many who couldn‚Äôt spell the word. Base generalizations r (often) tant amount to false, but yeesh.
@RealCandaceO @ChelseaClinton Isn‚Äôt freedom of speech great? Why in the world is she ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to comment on every issue that is important to you? Isn‚Äôt that exactly what you do? And just in case you didn‚Äôt already know, the Aryan ideology Hitler held would have put you to death. False idol much?
@PeebsY0 @MuslimIQ Sadly, for every one of us that says, &amp;  recognizes this, there is one (ok,maybe less) that belies how the left is a globalist conspiracy funded by Soros. Amazing just how gullible &amp; sheepish they‚Äôve become, yet continue thinking their thoughts r their own. Definition of a cult.
@AnnCoulter But the most typical threat to the United States remains homegrown rather than from infiltrating foreign nationals‚Äù or immigrants. The problem is, we have a problem. Ima just leave this here. https://t.co/nS4akQxG71
@SpeakingBee @ejwillingham @steph93065 Um...	‚ÄúGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.‚Äù 	I don‚Äôt see any exceptions rubric in the footnotes of this.		If ‚ÄúWE‚Äù imported them, how can they be in the wrong, &amp; thus, why should they be punished?		Asking for a friend.
@steph93065 @AnnCoulter Isn‚Äôt that called growth? 		As an aside, we‚Äôve seen the largest mass exodus from the US, of naturally born citizens, in the last two years.		The largest migration recorded in American history.
@piersmorgan @AnnCoulter The word ‚Äúsnowflakes‚Äù could be replaced with ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù and the statement would a) lose no meaning or coherence, and b) be even more apropos. Just sayin‚Äô.
@JerryFalwellJr Um... Your dad founded Lynchburg Christian Academy as a whites-only alternative to the public school system in the wake of desegregation. 	(Lifted from M.Yglesias)
@imillhiser @mjs_DC Absolutely. But I see no blame in this thread for the state, only that SCOTUS is anti-non-Christian.
@mjs_DC @imillhiser Yes...I know. State law, how I understand it, says only DOC employees can be in chamber. Not anyone who has been cleared. Not saying I agree but attempting to ensure people who haven‚Äôt read anything but this tweet are aware. The state is ultimately to blame...dog whistles &amp; all.
@JasonRylander @Tuff_Jon @mcbob @imillhiser I fully agree Jason, but Alabama law says only DOC employees are allowed in the chamber. Therefore the issue falls to the state of Alabama to catch up to the times &amp; either write addendum to the law, allow for special clearance, or employe major religions. Otherwise, it‚Äôs this.
@Halfcockedlaw @ndrew_lawrence @daveweigel @RoigFranzia Perception &amp; narrative. Like I said, it‚Äôs nitpicking, but ‚Äúaccessing‚Äù gives the perception of direct acquisition, whereas ‚Äúgetting a hold of‚Äù gives the perception of indirect acq. Semantically speaking, they each end the same way, but w/ such polarized views it‚Äôs a cogent caveat.
@Ms_Liz2 @AmberBobamber @dana_locks @Woofaraw I see more &amp; more similarities to present day &amp; Nazism than ever. But I digress....		Stupidity IS more damaging than pure evil, as while the narrative can change, the stupid still follow.  		Dostoevsky: ‚ÄúTo go wrong in one‚Äôs own way is better than to go right in someone else‚Äôs‚Äù
@mcbob @imillhiser What in the hell are you talking about? Besides being incoherent &amp; nonsensical, it‚Äôs dead wrong to say ‚ÄúLeftists‚Äù just wanna slap Christians around. You might reconsider education before further tweets.
@jolefson50 @markyquayle @MailOnline Seriously. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfake news‚Äù blathering basically began with the NE. Not that Pecker was around back then, but yeh.
@imillhiser And before anyone jumps on me, I‚Äôm not casting opinion one way or the other, but the OP neglected to mention the legal issue, giving the appearance of SCOTUS being anti-Muslim instead.
@imillhiser I thought this too until I read that only officially cleared DOC employees are allowed in execution chambers &amp; there is no Imam employed by this jurisdiction‚Äôs DOC, while there are Christian members of the cloth in their employ. Not saying it‚Äôs right but it‚Äôs in their state law.
@ndrew_lawrence @daveweigel @RoigFranzia While it‚Äôs nitpicking a bit, a gvt entity ‚Äúgetting ahold of text messages,‚Äù &amp; your statement that a gvt entity ‚Äúaccessed text messages‚Äù is disingenuous. Makes it sound like the gvt hacked or improperly obtained the info, opposed to merely ‚Äúgetting ahold‚Äù of them. Big difference.
@barbmic @PolishPatriotTM Yes...because the National Enquirer is trustworthy news.
@TheRightSideof1 @PolishPatriotTM @LizzJustLizz And credible proof of this is where?
@PolishPatriotTM @AngusJames3 Holy moses on a popsicle stick. The amount of stupid in this false equivalency is staggering.  You can‚Äôt even beGIN to compare the cases/attorneys.
@pfmusa1of3 @SaraCarterDC @AOC You could LITERALLY replace your chosen words with ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù and ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äù and more than 50% of the US would agree.
@rob_armin @kswinburne @RepAOC Says the guy who can‚Äôt even use a pluralized cliche in its conventional form. I even had to screenshot this but of irony. Thanks for the laugh...I mean the bag of laugh.
@JuddLegum Because there‚Äôs way too many incendiary &amp; fucked up statements and occurrences  by @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @gop to fit in to even a DAY‚ÄôS work, let alone including ‚Äúold stuff.‚Äù  But yeh...I feel ya.
@jolefson50 @markyquayle @MailOnline If you‚Äôve gotta wonder that now, then you haven‚Äôt paid attention over the last many decades.
@markyquayle @MailOnline You call it a coup. I call it slimeball journalism...even if I‚Äôm not his biggest fan.
@BOSG12 @broucherbabes The amount of ignorance in this statement is staggering. Driving by someone w/ a sign cannot be unchanged; being on Twitter can. Sad that ppl of this intelligence level are the ‚Äúadults‚Äù of tomorrow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on a FREE social media platform by choice, reading threads. It‚Äôs ur fault.‚Äù
If there‚Äôs 1 THING @VP  &amp; @realDonaldTrump cannot take away from u, it‚Äôs ur voice - though #Trump &amp; his cult might call u unpatriotic or a fascist communist. @EllenPage NAILED IT in this heartfelt monologue. They don‚Äôt want their guns taken away, but want u to give up who u are. https://t.co/5hzxRNcoCj
@DanCrenshawTX @juliettekayyem Are you serious? The POTUS has linked them at every turn. And to think...there was a time I respected you. Now that you‚Äôre no longer a free &amp; independent think, and fall in line with whatever #Trump says, you‚Äôre already useless. THINK FOR YOURSELF and don‚Äôt distort truth. PLEASE.
@realDonaldTrump Fake news! Drudge is even worse than the @PalmerReport.
@realDonaldTrump Wow. Only 48% of Republicans? That‚Äôs even lower than I thought. Sad.
@realDonaldTrump Yeh...you just never get enough of yourself. Sad.
Trump‚Äôs First Two Years, charted. The next time a #Trump cultist tells you how great things are &amp; spouts ridiculous numbers, here are the facts. There are a couple good ones but on the whole, these metrics paint a gloomy picture for the #StateOfTheUnion  https://t.co/uBspWAn5WS
@coleyworld You have THEE BEST quote, on Twitter, in your profile description. Apt, and funny as all get out. Cheers random white guy!	#NeverTrump
@mjfree @IvankaTrump Hypocrisy at its finest. @IvankaTrump complicit barely begins to describe how despicable your acts are, whether through silence or otherwise. Shame on you.
@usmint A terrible act. Period.
@USASOCNews @DeptofDefense THIS is how ‚Äòhero‚Äô is defined. Shouldn‚Äôt matter what race, color, creed, or gender ID a soldier is. Acts of such a selfless nature as this are heroic &amp; should be celebrated without question. Thank goodness for our service members, past, present, &amp; future.
@LGBTEqCaucus Sadly, this will not happen, especially in light of recent #SCOTUS ruling. Service  should be defined with one word (inside current rules &amp; regs), WILL! Not religioun, creed, race, color, gender, or sexual identity. What makes a TG person with a will to serve, less capable? NADA!
@RepRaulGrijalva I appreciate this statement, as I am ‚Äúin the majority,‚Äù but DO MORE THAN TWEET! Fight back; denounce @gop speaking points that are false &amp; provide evidence; work for ur constituency but be as moderate as possible so that u represent ALL. Don‚Äôt move further left or we‚Äôre dead 2020
@realDonaldTrump Just curious, how much did taxpayers spend to have military members twiddle their thumbs behind the scenes during then November caravan, and how many people actually crossed the border illegally from said caravan? Answers: A LOT, and NONE. All show, no substance. 	#BeBetter
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump I wish you were correct but after reading your blog for more than a year, almost none of what you‚Äôve said - other than some widely available info - has come to fruition. Your online opinions and prognostications represent, at best, a poorly constructed ‚Äúwish list.‚Äù Sad but true.
@realDonaldTrump [Quickly Googles Vegas oddsmakers prognostications on Bernhardt length of service] 		Cool bro.
@realDonaldTrump Nah...he just knows that a leopard‚Äôs spots don‚Äôt change.
@Coletteroseharm @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS So, none of the 3 affairs he admitted to count in ur opinion? This doesn‚Äôt include those alleged since he announced his candidacy. The affairs are the least of my concern, at that list. Supporters defend even his most egregious acts. If it were a Dem you‚Äôd likely be screaming.
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Ok...I‚Äôm out. I should have illustrated my ‚Äúindependence of thought‚Äù via my words, but telling me to ‚Äúget over my emotions‚Äù tells me you have no desire to actually debate or LISTEN - I live in SoCal, so Rush is a mainstay here, but I don‚Äôt need anyone preeching. I‚Äôm done.
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS That‚Äôs where we diverge. ALL have their opinion pieces, which I take with a grain of salt, but there is valuable news from all. Google ‚ÄúConservative Treehouse,‚Äù you will appreciate it. 		https://t.co/dkY4Dkya7P
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Btw...I appreciate your dialog, rather than launching in to assaulting and name calling. Too much of that, not enough LISTENING.
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Um...I DO get it. And I support any movement (to use your word) that gives more power to ‚Äúthe people.‚Äù I simply cannot rationalize usurping honesty, integrity, and one‚Äôs personal morality for policy.
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS ...Fox, CNN, Breitbart, Treehouse, MSNBC. Nobody can truly understand a subject w/out being educated with all sides &amp; opinion. Too many people simply digest what they‚Äôre told w/out forming educated opinions OF THEIR OWN. I see this more from his supporters than from the left.
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS ...I look at practice, policy, integrity, &amp; actions of a POTUS. He has done many good things, but he has also done many bad &amp; some abhorrent things, especially via Twitter, &amp; I have yet to see a supporter recognize that. I pride myself on receiving a balance of news..
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS I understand ur sentiments &amp; thank you. I‚Äôm still trying to find a balance, however, with his actions &amp; the fact that his supporters NEVER chastise a thing he says or does. No president is perfect, yet so many of his supporters act as if he makes NO mistakes. Not a Dem but...
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Keep drinking the kool-aid, man. Trump has you brainwashed in to thinking everything is a conspiracy. Sadly, there‚Äôs no debating you people, as no matter what is said, the response is the same: ‚ÄúHillary...fake news...witch-hunt.‚Äù Truly sad.
@jenn14605953 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Just because someone holds ONE particular opinion doesn‚Äôt mean s/he would sacrifice morals, honesty, &amp; integrity for policy. THAT is the epitome of hypocrisy.
@anthonydepalma @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS You‚Äôre right. Even though a judge signed off on the arrest process due to threatening (public &amp; private) comments Stone made, &amp; referenced gangster movies (you know...the ones with lots of guns). You‚Äôre totally right. He‚Äôs in big trouble.	[/rolling eyes]
@Coletteroseharm @eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS By evil, you mean because he doesn‚Äôt like a hypocritical ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù POTUS who lies, has affairs (throughout his life), belittles public &amp; private citizens, sides w/ FOX News over the career intel officials he appts, &amp; intentionally sows division? If that‚Äôs evil, sign me up.
@eugenegu @joepabike @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS The more you Tweet, the more I like you &amp; your (not always so subtle) dark yumor. The only knee he wants to take is the one he does in front of Putin, doc.
@SComebackaround @treasonstickers @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Don‚Äôt you mean ‚Äútaking the tip‚Äù from Putin?
@realDonaldTrump I deplore what he did, but how is his flip-flopping any different than the countless times you have done the same, or flat-out contradicted your own statements by saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that...FAKE NEWS.‚Äù
@crazennnn @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs actually a freakin child, in so many of his actions. Glad I got inside your head long enough for you to seek this out. No matter how you respond, THAT is without doubt. Besides...calling someone a child is neither insensitive nor offensive. Calling someone a ‚Äúretard‚Äù is.
@crazennnn @poisontbh Is he actually mentally handicapped or did you just choose a completely insensitive and offensive name to call him? Not cool, regardless of the situation.
@GypsyGentry @seanmdav Touch√©. My hyperbole was a bit misplaced. My sentiment should have mentioned something about moral subjectivity (combined w/ speed of info spreading) not bringing the same forays as illustrated today.  But touch√©.
@BobbyBrimstone @jonfavs @BobbyBrimstone methinks you and I are on the same page about a bunch of this (absolute) crap. Hails.
@SWBurbs @LGRooney @wslayher @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Yeh...I know. I botched my tweet (totally) while driving (actually pulled over to participate in the discussion). I‚Äôm a knucklehead.
@LGRooney @wslayher @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Thanks @LGRooney. I had totally forgotten about that. PHEW!!!
@HacimMb @TrishLaird @seanmdav &amp; the example u give highlights a big part of the problem. BOTH SIDES take every opportunity to demonize the other at every turn. It is sickening &amp; does nothing but sow further divide. Similar to my last post, I will not sacrifice morality for policy or party. We need common grd.
@HacimMb @TrishLaird @seanmdav No no...not at all. My grandfather was a minister &amp; I was raised in a Christian home. While slightly off topic (ur right), I am just shocked that the religious RIGHT supports Trump, replacing morals for policy. I can‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm not a Democrat, but I won‚Äôt compromise morality.
@AshLMcC @TrishLaird @seanmdav To be clear, turning 18 doesn‚Äôt mean one isn‚Äôt ‚Äúa kid,‚Äù unless you‚Äôre telling me that at 18 you stopped making stupid, childish decisions. I know I sure didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not defending him, as I don‚Äôt even know the guy (other than via media)...just sayin‚Äô.
@TrishLaird @HacimMb @seanmdav UR comparing apples n oranges &amp; making false equivalencies. While his act was tasteless &amp; hurtful, he was a ‚Äúkid‚Äù (who many are even in their 20‚Äôs). The left (&amp; right) are BOTH inconsistent, but the religious right is the most hypocritical &amp; has sacrificed morals for policy. Sad.
@TrishLaird @seanmdav Your argument is a non-starter. In 1984 we had not yet awakened to how offensive this kind of act is, especially since it would‚Äôve been viewed as little more than a costume. Sexual assault has NEVER BEEN ACCEPTABLE (in the modern era). Well, except (apparently) in Hollywood.
@MJKrause @seanmdav These two acts don‚Äôt compare. In ‚Äò84 we had not yet awakened to how offensive this is, especially since he was a kid. Not defending it, just sayin‚Äô. Sex assault has never been acceptable in the modern era (except, apparently, in Hollywood). Sadly the @gop will say they‚Äôre equal.
@CNNPolitics How ‚Äòbout just a gag? Then again, he might like that.
IMO if liberal-leaning media was smart they would‚Äôve applauded #Trump for ending the shutdown, giving him his obviously-needed strokes. This would‚Äôve cast the @gop as the only party piling doubt on re-opening the gvt. Come on folks, PLAY THE LONG GAME. Don‚Äôt feed the fire.	@CNN
@JeffreyGuterman And that should have read, ‚Äú...that educated ppl....‚Äù 	#damnautocorrect
@Newsweek No. Her ‚Äúbeating‚Äù him would mean no wall. That result is far from determined. Now...did she ‚Äúschool‚Äù him? Yes she did.
@wslayher @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump In my opinion, which matters ZILCH, I‚Äôve wondered the same. True emergencies require swift action. This question will obviously be broached when litigation begins. Sadly it is his right as POTUS &amp; I don‚Äôt believe there is a way to usurp or ?? an EO like that &amp; Congress won‚Äôt act.
@JeffreyGuterman It‚Äôs certainly not ‚Äúall,‚Äù as I know several highly educated Trump supporters. If that‚Äôs not an oxymoron I don‚Äôt know what is. 		It astounds me that educates ppl could support him. The ONLY answer is that they are happy supplanting integrity w/ policy, which is incredibly sad.
@chrislhayes @Trumpnado2016 Why not? He did it a year ago, and again today. Third time‚Äôs a charm, right?
@jonfavs Sadly too many ppl replace integrity for policy (see Evangelicas). It‚Äôs also the Dem‚Äôs fault as the party appears to be moving further left. The only way to beat Trump will be with a more moderate Dem/Ind. Please take heed of this or we will be stuck with a liar for 6 more years.
@RepAdamSchiff Sadly too many ppl replace integrity for policy (see Evangelicas). It‚Äôs also the Dem‚Äôs fault as the party appears to be moving further left. The only way to beat Trump will be with a more moderate Dem/Ind. Please take heed of this or we will be stuck with a liar for 6 more years.
@RepMaxineWaters Sadly too many ppl replace integrity for policy (see Evangelicas). It‚Äôs also the Dem‚Äôs fault as the party appears to be moving further left. The only way to beat Trump will be with a more moderate Dem/Ind. Please take heed of this or we will be stuck with a liar for 6 more years.
@DavidWohl Your troll status is growing on the daily.
@BernardKerik @DavidWohl @AndrewGillum I haven‚Äôt seen any tweets disparaging Trump for having a doctor fraudulently diagnose bone spurs to avoid serving. Though, it doesn‚Äôt surprise me.
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump But it‚Äôs not like you have any real credibility. What was it you were barred from ever doing again?
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump Here is the problem...two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. PERIOD.
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Not to mention regulations he roles back that HURTS workers in workplaces...where a good chunk of his base is employed. It‚Äôs a cult, I tell you. A CULT.
@realDonaldTrump U are the LEAST qualified politician to reject findings from people, departments, &amp; organizations who have spent a lifetime studying these concepts. U MUST listen to these people. U talk about U.S. safety &amp; security via ‚Äúthe wall,‚Äù but categorically deny these issues? Come on.
@Patriot_Nurse @RyanAFournier @AnnCoulter This, I have no doubt of. LOADS of money leaving the U.S.  It still doesn‚Äôt supplant the aggregate $$ I mention. Definitely not defending illegal immigration, as we MUST know who enters/stays/leaves the country, but stating some facts that OP left out in order to fit narrative.
@RyanAFournier @AnnCoulter We NEED immigration reform, badly. But what you are NOT stating is the aggregate $$.  In CA last year, illegals spent over $15B in taxes alone &amp; another $8B in services. That‚Äôs over $23B spent (ie put back into economy) w/ estimates of another $8-12B spent on goods. Positive net.
@kausmickey @AnnCoulter Like father-in-law, like son-in-law.
As a kid I used to enjoy the #ProBowl as it truly felt like the ‚Äúbest of the best‚Äù pitted against each other. Now, 35 years later, it‚Äôs just the pits. I could find clowning on YouTube if I so desired. Come on @NFL give us a better product.	#Sad 	#Laughingstock #AttendanceProvesIt
@RepSwalwell If that‚Äôs what you truly believe, then PUSH FOR LEGISLATION!!! 2Amd is a right, but it doesn‚Äôt imply people can‚Äôt sacrifice rights for abhorrent actions. MAKE THE CHANGE. Don‚Äôt just tweet.  Work hard for the people u represent &amp; produce thoughtful legislation for the better.
@RepAdamSchiff Thank you for this thought, without immediately bashing or presuming guilt on others. Doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúothers‚Äù (ie Ind 1) is not guilty, but rather, let the dice land where they are rolled and (hopefully) the truth is unveiled. Sadly, the right will claim bias or deep state. Sad.
@WOxiner @rafikiflash @Elex_Michaelson @AnnCoulter @LisaBloom ‚ÄúKeep them listening‚Äù is one of the simplest yet deepest 3 word phrases I‚Äôve seen in a while. Well put. It‚Äôs not always about forcing the hand, but nudging it, and by continuing a narrative or at minimum, keeping it top of mind, change just might occur.
@estheramma @realDonaldTrump Yes...‚Äùacting‚Äù like POTUS...not doing.
@Elex_Michaelson @AnnCoulter @LisaBloom If we absolutely must spend that $$, it makes more sense to do it in ways that address the overall problem, and not putting a band-aid on one small issue (ie the problem is still there)? The argument can not be this difficult to understand, unless ppl are just fixated on an idea.
@Elex_Michaelson @AnnCoulter @LisaBloom I‚Äôm not against a wall, per se, but to pile on our  kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids debt for something that doesn‚Äôt fix a problem is like burning $. Why is everybody so fixated on a wall, when is addresses nothing systemic &amp; nothing about the those coming in through other places (the majority)?
@Elex_Michaelson @AnnCoulter @LisaBloom What is @AnnCoulter proposal for the non-southern border illegals (nSBI)? nSBI‚Äôs make up the majority of illegals in the US. NO terrorist attack has taken place by an illegal who crossed the SB. Over 90% of all drugs seized enter legal ports, not places where a wall would go.
@Elex_Michaelson @AnnCoulter @LisaBloom What about the thousands who enter via Florida/Cuba, or those overstaying visas (largest part), or other places? If 5.7B actually fixed the entire issue I wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye, but it only prevents a tiny fraction of illegals who shouldn‚Äôt be here &amp; doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù immigration?
@Elex_Michaelson @AnnCoulter @LisaBloom Why does right think a wall would fix illegal immig. when a) only a fraction of illegal immig takes place from the southern border &amp; b) it doesn‚Äôt address the systematic problem of illegal entry, only addresses one TINY tactic used? Is that worth billions? No. Address the system!
@SenatorBennet @SenateGOP @POTUS You rule! Thank you for your passion, (appropriate) fire, and zeal.
@SteveDaines @SenateGOP @POTUS So...you stood with the POTUS on the shutdown, by his not signing the SAME CR he signed today. You will not be a happy camper when you‚Äôre up for re-election.
@SenJohnHoeven @SenateGOP You mean...the SAME ‚Äúdeal‚Äù he rejected a month ago, as you agreed with him? You are a sheep, with no moral compass or individual thoughts. You‚Äôre either scared of Trump or a true bozo who can‚Äôt think for himself. You were elected to serve the people, not Trump. CHANGE NOW!
@RealJamesWoods @KK478649174 We have still seen no actual proof of this. Only conspiracy stories about illegals being paid and bussed to vote. Nothing more.
@TPM ‚ÄúIn 1989 Donald Trump took out full-page advertisements in all 4 of NYC‚Äôs major newspapers calling for five boys from Harlem, who were all 16 or under, to get the death penalty for a crime they didn‚Äôt commit. The boys spent from 6 to 13 years in jail before they were exonerated.‚Äù
@qanon76 @realDonaldTrump Because he‚Äôs a narcissistic egomaniac who must be front &amp; center of the media. Have you read ‚Äúhis‚Äù books? The answer is stated in print- ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to be hated &amp; never admit ur wrong than to be irrelevant.‚Äù THAT is why he does it. He was irrelevant, but found a way not to be.
@realDonaldTrump So, it took 35 days to accept the same deal you rejected a month ago? Way to ‚Äúrepresent all Americans.‚Äù
@MattRod4good @sdshark @RyanGirdusky @AnnCoulter Exiting this conversation @mattrod4good. Calling people names is the antithesis of what many of ur tweets criticize the left for.  U may live as u see fit, but sadly, u are just another disrespectful hypocrite who refuses to live by his own rubric &amp; cannot have a civil debate.
@MattRod4good @sdshark @RyanGirdusky @AnnCoulter So, rather than get in a pissing match, which too many people in this country do (&amp; become disrespectful), I‚Äôll leave it at this- It is not my job to find u info that u would like. There are numerous, nay, countless videos of Trump discussing this. Policy or not he is the source.
@ShawnHarder1 @RyanGirdusky @AnnCoulter Nah. She‚Äôs not an idiot, as she is obviously educated. She just chooses to speak lies &amp; construct a (false) narrative that fits her hyperbole, rather than using the narrative that the facts illustrate. Remind you of anyone? Almost every Republican currently in office.
@MattRod4good @sdshark @RyanGirdusky @AnnCoulter Actually, Trump did, multiple times. Though, to be fair, he said ‚Äúcoast to coast,‚Äù which in his own hyperbolic (read, idiotic) way is equivalent.		Time to learn the facts, or at least view the numerous videos of him saying that very thing.
@RyanGirdusky @AnnCoulter Suck up much, there bud? Better wipe your nose.
@realDonaldTrump By people (and I use that term loosely), do you mean @AnnCoulter? Seems you‚Äôre almost as obsessed with her as you are Hillary Clinton. Who knew you‚Äôd be schooled by women both in and out of the WH?
@AnnCoulter I just came to read comments. My my my...there goes Ann, right back up on her soapbox. I don‚Äôt typically extol hate, but reading the comments in this thread make me think that ‚ÄòMurica Always Goads Ann! #Maga		Bush might not have been a great POTUS but a wimp he was/is not.	#URSad
@LuLuRoche @Crobb19 @KatieHill4CA @AOC @RepJahanaHayes @LaurenUnderwood Not sure it‚Äôs working any more, as it was from last week. Good on you for at least trying. Be well.
@realDonaldTrump So obsessed with Hillary, you are. Who would have known the tenant living in a Trump property with the most value, is Hillary in your head. Get over it, you freakin child.
There is one VERY BLATANT omission from this year‚Äôs #BestActor nominees: @realDonaldTrump. He is pulling of the single best acting job in history. Cast your vote by calling ur reps.	#DonTheCon #OscarNoms #AcademyAwards #Trump
@essenviews No. Then just as he has his entire life, he gets off scott free.
@maydaymindy9 Neither, as neither can beat Trump (sadly) in a national contest. The only real hope is a moderate who can withstand the far right who hate Trump but would never vote for someone of the far left. If Dems don‚Äôt realize this quickly, then we‚Äôre doomed for another 6 years.
@LaurenWern I agree he doesn‚Äôt care, but using that equivalency, MANY caring people who have owned businesses have done the same thing. Different reasons, different people, same result. Caution, with this one.
@EdKrassen Well, I‚Äôm with ya, but it‚Äôs never gonna happen. Not as long as America‚Äôs south and Midwest make up the majority of the electoral college, AND the @gop has their noses so far ups Trump‚Äôs ass that they fear his wrath.
@danpfeiffer Yet Trump is still in office, @GOP kisses his ring and refuses to address his ineptitude‚Äôs &amp; issues, and there ain‚Äôt a damn thing we can do right now to get him out. If Mueller doesn‚Äôt bring something, we are stuck, likely, for 6 more years. How in the hell can ppl support Trump?
@realDonaldTrump One of the best things you‚Äôve actually done for this country...not sending that lying windbag before television.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You are truly obsessed with this woman. Who knew the most occupied Trump real estate was Hillary, in your head?	#GetOverIt
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Blah blah blah. Your party just lifted sanctions on Kremlin cronies, right? THIS is the best you could come up with? Shame on you. 	#KremlinOverCountry
@realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs because nothing has really happened yet. If DPRK can illustrate a TRUE &amp; PROVABLE reversal in nuclear policy, then we‚Äôll talk.
@JusticeTyrwhit @reustis @nkjemisin @ktumulty As an aside, &amp; referring to my ‚Äúapple &amp; the tree‚Äù analogy, the mother of one of the boys in vid told news outlets she blames ‚Äúblack Muslims‚Äù for her son‚Äôs actions. I wish I could call this surprising but cannot. This ‚Äúreciprocal empathy‚Äù you speak of is obviously not occurring.
@JusticeTyrwhit @reustis @nkjemisin @ktumulty Indeed, and your point was taken in response, the first.  That said, so much of this is subjective in nature, and I abhor showering others with what is (thusly said) ‚Äúsubjectively right.‚Äù Personal choice, no matter how despicable is generally the only bringer of change.
@JusticeTyrwhit @reustis @nkjemisin @ktumulty I think there‚Äôs a bit of hyperbole here, at least on my end. That said, an assumption is being made that A) the tribe would agree to such an act, and B) these kids‚Äô parents would allow them to ‚Äúparticipate.‚Äù Apples don‚Äôt generally fall too far their trees.
@njaspery @WhoLeo2016 @reustis @nkjemisin @ktumulty In my opinion, you would think that if not taught at home it would be at the ‚ÄúChristian school‚Äù they attend. Outside of that, no person nor society has any responsibility to teach them anything.
@Gwatson0008 @ReaganBattalion Which is why I stated it was inappropriate, and IN MY OPINION should be a crime. Open those eyes a wee bit more big G.
@ReaganBattalion Doxing of any kind is inappropriate. A doxer, IMO, is guilty of co-conspiring for any crime committed due to said dox. But what do I know.
@mjdennison @EdKrassen I know what you mean, but it‚Äôs never as easy as ‚Äúfiring‚Äù someone. Besides, few people are willing to replace a seasoned congressional member who sucks, with a newbie who is willing to challenge. AOC is one of the few examples, which means it can happen. Just not enough.
@westland_will @DrDavidDuke Possibly in your mind, but perception is a bitch, and even conservatives are speaking out against the kids‚Äô actions.
@KremlinTrolls @GLSCHWALL Geeze...what‚Äôs the big deal? Don‚Äôt we ALWAYS send several fully grown, tactically trained men to meet a 90lb woman? 		[and yes...that is sarcasm]
@mjdennison @EdKrassen Yes, but the ‚Äúwe‚Äù you refer to is Congress, and until his Republican asses...I mean allies choose country over party, he will never hear the words ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired.‚Äù
@EdKrassen It‚Äôs not hard. It‚Äôs merely that his millions of supporters (&amp; congressional allies) have supplanted honesty, integrity, morality, &amp; the truth, for policies. Oh...and did I mention hypocrisy?
@westland_will @DrDavidDuke They weren‚Äôt ‚Äúattacked‚Äù for being who they are or because of their caps, it was for their complete disregard and blatant harassment of another human. Just sayin.
@michaelmalice One of the most uneducated &amp; unwittingly moronic tweets I‚Äôve seen in recent days. Subjectivity is not truth, just as sexual assault has no race, color, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, military service, or disability.
@IamMsTish @ResidingCynic @realDonaldTrump Yet, as sad as the day is long, he stands a decent chance of being re-elected. The only thing more sad is that those supporting him have supplanted honesty, integrity, and humanity for policies. Oh...and did I mention hypocrisy?
@NormDGuerreIndy @StephenAtHome Or, Newcastle-Eu-Pleine.
@BillKristol And by ‚Äúhard,‚Äù I mean insane.
@BillKristol It‚Äôs hard to blame another man when one, himself, reaches for &amp; grabs a scalding hot handle on the stove.
@HNHughson Well, as father used to say, ‚ÄúGod created so many perfect people...the rest he covered with hair.‚Äù Just a bit of levity, here. Cheers.
@HNHughson The answer to your question is, THEY SHOULDN‚ÄôT.		Well said.
@reustis @nkjemisin @ktumulty A truer statement has not been made, on this subject. It BEGINS with respect, not ends. Though, to be fair, if respect is achieved (in this case only) that in itself is a step toward that honor.
@BobbyBrimstone Excellent analogy. It‚Äôs one damn stupid pissing match. And since I reject both parties, as institutions, it makes it that much more infantile. The inmates are running the asylum, at the very least.
I‚Äôll never vote or support Trump, as I think he‚Äôs a despicable human. That said, it will very difficult for Dems to pass up the ‚Äúdeal‚Äù discussed in today‚Äôs speech. To many issues to discuss in one tweet &amp; still many issues of untruth in the speech, but it will be hard to pass on.
@MoralesPiko @SethAbramson Sometimes it feels like the little things are all that can be done. You, obviously, have bigger and better ideas.  For me, this was something I could do  NOW.
@AtheistRepublic Trumpism
@VP @POTUS @SecondLady It‚Äôs a paradox, I suppose, because your views ruin the lives of already born &amp; living women who need to make a choice. Your views are subjective, which doesn‚Äôt make them right for every person, yet you‚Äôve chosen to make decisions for others, which is the antithesis of ur plight.
@RyanLizza If it‚Äôs a leak it likely came from SDNY, as they are infamous for leaks. Mueller might be pissed, but I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs not freaked out. He wasn‚Äôt hired to construct a means to take down Trump. He was hired to find the truth. Hopefully he DOES take down Trump...just sayin.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS A witch-hunt...meaning the Special Council? You mean, the ONLY group who actually knows what‚Äôs going on, and stepped in to (kind of) defend Trump?
@sjkubel @TursiAndrew @AnnCoulter Riiiiiiiight.  You don‚Äôt agree with someone who offers an opinion, and all you do is call names? No wonder this country is being driven apart.
@MoPolitiks @acueto7982 @AnnCoulter Why would you assume that just because someone is a Democrat, or not a Trump fan, that s/he automatically associates and/or agrees with a trashy org like BF? That kind of thinking is why we are driven further apart. Don‚Äôt assume.
@Veltran88 @AnnCoulter Why? The President lies every day?
@BigKarma420_DET @34jhay34 @KristenL9609 @KatieHill4CA @AOC @RepJahanaHayes @LaurenUnderwood Yeh...if indeed it is used and quoted, which I wouldn‚Äôt doubt, it would be among the least scientific and ACCURATE polls utilized. But whatever...I‚Äôm only the messenger.
@kellyx340 @OrinKerr @RyanLizza It‚Äôs back up!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @seanhannity Yes...because @seanhannity is both an authority &amp; truthfully unbiased in all he says and does.
@mkraju @LindseyGrahamSC said basically the same thing, just with his spin. Many others say the same. As a citizen all I see is a pissing match. Opening gvt should not be a pre-requ for a wall &amp; visa versa. The inmates are running the asylum, &amp; it‚Äôs hurting those who aren‚Äôt in the convo.
@chelsea_janes THANK YOU! Great folks, a lot of them, but they will not carry a national vote out of Trump‚Äôs hands. Too many people are willing to sacrifice ethics, integrity, &amp; the truth in order to have policies. We need an established leader, possibly a even a moderate. It‚Äôs the only way.
@GOPLeader @HouseGOP Come on man...these are NOT proposals from the Democratic House, but a couple of folks on the far left. It‚Äôs no different than how Freedom Caucus differs from moderates, and even staunch Republicans. Don‚Äôt construct a narrative to fit your ‚Äúfacts,‚Äù but disseminate ACTUAL fact.
@HouseGOP Indeed. Though, to be fair, the comments rise nowhere near the level of @SteveKingIA ongoing &amp; consistent remarks. Methinks that both parties need to reset &amp; establish a zero tolerance policy for true hate speech. Not casual opinion, but hate speech. The problem is on both sides.

@charliekirk11 @10CodePete Your disingenuous words and false narrative must stop. Uneducated people fall for these tactics &amp; lies. At least provide CORRECT FACTS THAT LINK TO A WALL. Very sad that these tactics exist.
@charliekirk11 @10CodePete We MUST HAVE IMMIGRATION REFORM! We cannot have people entering the U.S. illegally, but spending nearly $6B &amp; adding to an already ballooning deficit will not achieve anything other than indenturing our kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids w/ debt they will suffer by.
@charliekirk11 @10CodePete These ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù are why people are mad. You use (some) correct stats but incorrect, or mysteriously missing explanations. The items you listed would not be affected by a wall. You intentionally use fear mongering tactics to construct a false narrative.
@charliekirk11 @10CodePete 3rd, illegal immigrants‚Äô combined spending &amp; taxes surpass the $135B in revenue so it‚Äôs more than offset. 4th, and again, majority of sex trafficking is done through PORTS OF ENTRY, not random border areas as you claim so a wall would do nothing to stop or diminish this.
@charliekirk11 @10CodePete A barrier might be a good plan but when do we stop adding to an already ballooning deficit? 2nd, the facts u list have already been debunked. A wall would not stop the heroine u speak of. That 90% comes through LEGAL PORTS OF ENTRY not random border areas.
@PalmerReport Fox NEWS? I‚Äôm not familiar with that.
@10CodePete @FrankDangelo23 @realDonaldTrump What bothers me the most (well almost) is that had Obama said, done, or acted even an iota of how Trump does he would have been drawn &amp; quartered by the @gop. But Trump does it &amp; it‚Äôs ok. Whether he is innocent or guilty, there were enough FACTS to at least investigate. No ‚Äúbuts‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump You just can‚Äôt help yourself, can you. That is, making a statement w/out self-posturing or nauseating braggadocio. The nation cares about more than Trump.

@mulieann @Neevie13 @krassenstein @HouseJudiciary @GOP @realDonaldTrump Sadly it‚Äôs not. Congress is the closest thing, in my mind, to sacred -as an institution. Yet partisanship has supplanted the very ideals the body was founded on- both D‚Äôs &amp; R‚Äôs. They should be ashamed of what it has become. WE SEE IT &amp; THEM yet have no real recourse. So very sad.
@Neevie13 @krassenstein Sad but true. And even if @HouseJudiciary acts the @gop will keep heads buried deep in @realDonaldTrump. THAT is the only ‚Äúdeep state.‚Äù Sad that partisanship is so blind that they won‚Äôt even discuss it, let alone act on it. Our Congress has officially reached the joke stage.

@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Thanks for helping the ratio.
@realDonaldTrump This is a POLICY difference, not a PARTISAN difference. Holding the gvt &amp; its workers hostage over a POLICY difference is political malpractice.

@realDonaldTrump So many lies, so many people hurt by them, so many years it will take to regain the ground we once stood upon. I know you have no conscience, but your legacy will stain you and your family long after you are gone. Hopefully you live long enough to see them all ruined.
Maybe part of that ‚Äúwall‚Äù will have floaties?
On @FoxNews website 2nite: "Officials say more than 36,000 Cubans currently face deportation orders. About 29,000 are convicted criminals and 7,000 non-criminal immigration violators, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement." Wonder why Trump &amp; @gop won‚Äôt address this?
@SteveScalise For someone who ‚Äúprides‚Äù himself on being a man of god, you sure don‚Äôt live by scripture.

@GILGONZA1 @Lrihendry What rules &amp; laws? US Constitution Art VI, Cl 3 says the oath of office isn't a religious test.

@g123golf @Lrihendry Damn it...are you just stupid or do you suffer from mental handicaps? It is NOT law, as mentioned, nor will it ever be.

@Lrihendry @Judydavison7 I love the fact that ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù don‚Äôt want their 2nd Amd rights taken away but they have no issue taking away someone‚Äôs 1st Amd rights.

@Basilean2420 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter If u work in law then u def understand the complexity of the probe. Benghazi took years, Clinton‚Äôs simple investigation took 4ever, Reagan had multiple that dragged 4ever. This is unlike any other, in # of ppl involved &amp; scope of discovery, ex parte, &amp; the like. Unicorns go fast.
@AnnCoulter All cultures are the same? Yet you fanned the fires of Muslim hate, and said nothing about it, when you retweeted the video of Tlaib. Not that your thought process was that she is a Muslim, rather the ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù you blew. Read the comments in your tweet. You said nothing.
@Mike30846677 @ToBellaG @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Sad that you can‚Äôt see the forest for the trees. Both sides are equally at fault, not just the ‚ÄúDems, socialists, &amp; Marxists.‚Äù If you‚Äôre going to describe HOW each party acts, racism at the heart of Rep‚Äôs should be mentioned. But rather than go there, I choose to say it‚Äôs both.
@7mo_778 @RashidaTlaib I have no idea how this relates to what I said. Regardless of how you describe the Muslim faith, I merely mentioned that a huge percentage of Trump supporters already have a target on her, as they forget that this country was founded on religious freedom. It‚Äôs wise to BE CAUTIOUS

@RashidaTlaib And while it is not fair, you are under a microscope as it is. The right has marked you as a someone promoting Sharia &amp; who will choose party over country (or worse, Islam as a violent means to political corruption). You must be aware. Doesn‚Äôt mean u shouldn‚Äôt be u, but be smart.
@RashidaTlaib I certainly wish you, and ALL new congressional members luck in trying to right the ship, but America is bigger than you, or the president. Please reconsider how you represent ALL people in your district, not just those who agree with you.
@RashidaTlaib You should be proud, but your rhetoric in the now viral video of you talking of impeachment is not how you make people proud. It might be true, but a freshman congresswoman should be more aware of the political landscape &amp; what words like that do. All it did was anger his base.
@jodell_wilder @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Yep. As lovely as Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúgrab‚Äôem by the pussy,‚Äù constantly calling people nasty names &amp;/or insult ethnicities, &amp; tweet daily w/ abhorrent content? She made 1 awful, horrible statement &amp; should apologize but it‚Äôs ironic so many trump fans have no issue w/ his constant rhetoric.
@Basilean2420 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter This is where Trump supporters r wrong. It takes time for the process to play out. Courts have already ruled that he broke the Due Process Clause, the Spending Clause, 1st Amd via free press, Equal Prot Clause, &amp; they‚Äôre trying Emol Clause. Not to mention potential Mueller stuff.
@dandtonthheroad @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter That is 100% untrue &amp; archives prove it. Everything from ‚Äúgrab‚Äôem by the pussy &amp; moving on that bitch‚Äù to insulting congressional members‚Äô ethnicities, to continuous name calling of people who disagree with him. Her comment was abhorrent but u cannot FACTUALLY make that claim.
@Catmeister @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter That‚Äôs all well &amp; good, &amp; you have every right to be proud, but why should every person do exactly as you? What you‚Äôre applying here is a subjective morality, if you will. While her comments are abhorrent, it doesn‚Äôt make her any less or an American citizen than you or me.
@debbym1111 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter But I appreciate the respectful reply. Thank you, and happy holidays.
@debbym1111 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Don‚Äôt need to. I choose to tune out  unverified sources or opinions &amp; look for fact. No offense, but most of what u mention is (IMO) in the realm of opinion or conspiracy alt-facts w/ a narrative constructed to suit a purpose, not facts leading to a narrative as an explanation.
@Mike30846677 @ToBellaG @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter I don‚Äôt disagree. Turmoil is abound &amp;  only getting worse, both sides. I just find it ironic so many Trump supporters don‚Äôt equate his rhetoric to that of others (ie he gets a pass). If we continue down this road it will turn deadly, &amp; I choose to look to a POTUS AS AN EXAMPLE.
@ltlopez4life @JIMBROW73512907 @DougMcDougal @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Emoluments Clause, 1st Amd issues via press, Establishment Clause, 5th &amp; 14th Amd in Due Process &amp; Equal Protection Clauses, Spending Clause- should I go on? The Emol CL is still working through courts, all others have been stayed in courts. These are facts not my opinion.
@NylaNorris @penelope7usa @blupony3 And while I don‚Äôt support her, she has EVERY right to be in office. Not sure how you can make such a claim.
@NylaNorris @penelope7usa @blupony3 But it‚Äôs ok for trump to ‚Äúgrab‚Äôem by the pussy,‚Äù constantly call people nasty names &amp;/or insult ethnicities, &amp; tweet daily w/ abhorrent content?

@Jason43800365 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Just curious... this woman made ONE abhorrent statement &amp; she should be ashamed. But how can u say this &amp; not feel even more strong about a president who ‚Äúgrabs‚Äôem by the pussy,‚Äù or calls people names nearly every day, makes fun of people‚Äôs‚Äô ethnicity, or any other # of things?
@USAdvocate1976 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Uh...for what? What she said is disgusting but how would that be anywhere near a crime? It amazes me to see the vitriol over this when Trump says far worse daily. People talk about having their 2nd Amd rights impeded, but you want to take away their 1st Amd rights? Just sayin.
@jfittsie @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Just curious... this woman made ONE abhorrent statement &amp; she should be ashamed. But how can u say this &amp; not feel even more strong about a president who ‚Äúgrabs‚Äôem by the pussy,‚Äù or calls people names nearly every day, makes fun of people‚Äôs‚Äô ethnicity, or any other # of things?
@JJBurns19 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter BWAHHHHH!!!! You‚Äôre an idiot man. I generally don‚Äôt call people names, or stoop to anything other than tangible, rational debate, but you...your pansy-ass goes after a woman for ONE comment when the POTUS does it nearly daily and it‚Äôs totally fine. LOL. A double standaes if ever.
@gatewaypundit @sebastiano1717 I‚Äôm sorry. Why does it matter what she did in high school? Trump brags about ‚Äúgrabbin‚Äôem by the pussy at 70,‚Äù but she gets attached for teenage hijinks? Sad.
@DrDeplorable23 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Just like Trump...and she only made ONE disgusting remark. Him? Yeesh. Countless.
@debbym1111 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Just curious... this woman made ONE abhorrent statement &amp; she should be ashamed.

@debbiescott56 @penelope7usa So, what is your opinion on Trump ‚Äúgrabbin‚Äôem by the pussy,‚Äù or calling people horrible names over &amp; over again (even making fun of ethnicity), or any other number of things. This woman should be ashamed, even though it was ONE statement, but Trump has done worse countless times.
@JJBurns19 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Well, it certainly isn‚Äôt, considering Trump has said, and continues saying equally as disturbing things, calling people names, ‚Äúgrabbin‚Äôem by the pussy,‚Äù and the likes. She should be ashamed of herself, but don‚Äôt pretend Trump is any better, and he‚Äôs the POTUS!
@Cynthia_Jeanne3 @penelope7usa @Ken200960 @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Yeh, kinda like Trump‚Äôs examples to Baron to ‚Äúgrab‚Äôem by the pussy,‚Äù or calling people names in public &amp; on Twitter, or bullying his way in to anything that doesn‚Äôt go his way, or by never apologizing for ANYTHING. 2 wrongs don‚Äôt make a right &amp; this is awful but Trump‚Äôs far worse
@blupony3 @penelope7usa @Ken200960 I have a problem with people who get excited while chanting ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù or vote for someone who enjoys ‚Äúgrabbin‚Äôem by the pussy.‚Äù
@ToBellaG @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Nope. Her ONE statement is definitely not a civil one, &amp; is abhorrent, but do u question Trump every single (read, HUNDREDS) time he has been caught saying or tweeting similarly despicable things? Pot = kettle. We must ALL return to a bit more civility if we r to move ahead.
@deensr1 @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter This is awful, but Trump has said, and continues saying FAAAAAAR worse. This person does not speak for Democratic leadership either. While there will be some attempts to impeach, if the D‚Äôs know what‚Äôs good for them, they‚Äôll hold off (as Pelosi said today).
@Joe_Nye The difficulty is the sociopolitical paradigm between the two countries, more than just ‚Äúcompetition.‚Äù It‚Äôs not as easy as cooperation &amp; competition when issues such as human rights, military &amp; land/sea ownership, &amp; cyber issues are as prevalent as today. We can hope, though.
@RebeccaShabad Oh, @HBO ...please do something.
@SamuelLewis00 @ReaganBattalion @RashidaTlaib I don‚Äôt like Trump, but this type of rhetoric only fans the flames of his base. Besides...Dems have long criticized him for pandering ONLY to his base. This is no different.
@RepKathleenRice @HouseGOP Actually, Congresswoman, I encourage u &amp;  ALL other @HouseFloor members to push back on @realDonaldTrump. A wall is fine as long as he follows through on his promise that Mexico pay for it. W/ the nat‚Äôl debt at an all time high, we cannot tie more debt to future generations.
@RepDonBeyer Thank you, from a guy in California!
@RepKathleenRice Thank you, from a guy in California!
@RepLoisFrankel Thank you, from someone in California.
@RepLipinski @realDonaldTrump THIS is the kind of tweet we enjoy seeing. Factual, with a message that speaks directly to constituents. Not devisive, nor pandering to a base. I encourage you to join Rep Lipinski in this kind of communication.
@RepBobbyRush Way to go Congressman. At least a few people don‚Äôt want the shutdown continuing.
@QuancyClayborne Two words? Gotta be careful or Twitter will throw me in jail. How‚Äôs about...	SEWER DEMAGOGUE 		What‚Äôya think @AnnCoulter? I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôre only aware of the trendy colloquial interpretation of the word. I encourage you to look up its actual definition. 	#SewerDemagogue
@realDonaldTrump @GOP Never been stronger? BWAHHHHHHHHH!
@LisaBrault @marcorubio ‚ÄòCause this was the easy PR move. Commenting on the gun story would imply standing up to the NRA, which would demand him having a spine. Alas...methinks there‚Äôs something rotten in Rubio‚Äôs state.
@Buehlmeister @marcorubio I like the way you think @Buehlmeister
@marcorubio Way to go for the PR tweet there, homie.
@realDonaldTrump Not according to YOU. Uv tweeted ad nauseum how it only gets done if u get $5.6B, which we don‚Äôt have. How is that ‚Äúwilling to work?‚Äù This would imply that both sides compromise, &amp; not allow one side to bully a decision in to creation. Each side must give! This mean u too Donald.
@realDonaldTrump If you believe that‚Äôs true, then you‚Äôre not thinking either pragmatically or creatively. If you can get ‚ÄúMexico to pay for the wall,‚Äù as you promised, &amp; not through some backdoor hyperbole, then GREAT! Stick to the promise of payment, and your issues go away. Well, some of them.
@realDonaldTrump Way to start your day with a truly DEVISIVE tweet. Asshole.
@Kris_Sacrebleu Ur just not looking hard enough. Tons of non main stream stuff. Hell, entire releases dedicated to the ‚Äúfuck Trump‚Äù movement. If u want mainstream u won‚Äôt find them- no sales 4 record companies. We r  not united about a cause the way we were toward ‚ÄòNam. NOBODY wanted us there.
@danielledsouzag @Someweirdid You‚Äôre right. Thank goodness his supporters wouldn‚Äôt be the ones fighting. The military would. Yeesh.
@Someweirdid @MittRomney @GOP U obviously have no true desire to discuss or debate as the insults &amp; name calling is ur go to card. NOT discussion &amp; debate in order to move forward. &amp; you call me uneducated? Enjoy ur time w/ Trump in office. It will end in ‚Äò20 or ‚Äò24 &amp; where will u be then? Only mad. I‚Äôm done.
@Someweirdid @MittRomney @GOP ...administration now doing &amp; saying EXACTLY what they said NOT to do.  The only way it will work, in the long run, is to attempt finding common ground.  Otherwise, everything you love about Trump will be undone the minute he is gone. How is that good? It only breeds more hate.
@Someweirdid @MittRomney @GOP ...than me, but I voted for Reagan, who worked very well for me.  Again, u know nothing about me, and even more obvious is your hate for fellow Americans who disagree that Trump is right for America. Sad to see the people who hated the way they were treated during the last...
@Someweirdid @MittRomney @GOP We are ALL Americans, yet u choose to abhor anyone not aligned with u. How is that American? Just because I do not support this President does not make me any less American than you. I just choose not to hate the people staring across the isle at me. I‚Äôm guessing ur younger...
@Someweirdid @MittRomney @GOP Once again, your inability to see past anything is irrational. You nothing about me, yet assume everything. As a Libertarian, take great pride in being fully educated on all issues. I don‚Äôt vote by party but by policy &amp; person.  Your hate for anyone different is the problem.
@TrumpOrFalse Yep. Take some time &amp; go through his followers that have no picture in their avatar. It is easy to see that they are bots of some kind. I spent 2 hours last night (when I couldn‚Äôt sleep) simply reporting them as ‚Äúsuspicious accounts.‚Äù If we all did it for 30min, he‚Äôd lose 1000‚Äôs.
@DarthSpader747 @MittRomney So incredible true, it hurts. It‚Äôs not just Republicans either. Both sides are so entrenched in this constant pissing match that they forget that 99% of us just want to live.  Well said man.
@Someweirdid @MittRomney @GOP It‚Äôs good to disagree. It always has been. This country was founded on dissent. We have passed that, though, and now it‚Äôs just hate. No skin off my back to be called a name, it‚Äôs just incredibly sad that BOTH SIDES feel that actually accomplishes something. Never has, never will.
@Someweirdid @MittRomney @GOP Typical. Just because someone doesn‚Äôt agree w/ Trump, his supporters resort to name calling. No debate, no rational intelligent conversation, just name calling. Sad that so many in the U.S. have fallen in to disrespect. All it does is make u look uneducated &amp; trite.
@MittRomney Nicely written, but I will believe it when I see it. If you, as a member of the @gop, actually stay true to your words, you could almost single handedly save the nation, and the world, from even more than the nearly undoable damage Trump has done. Someone in the @gop MUST stand!
‚ÄúBut I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive....‚Äù @MittRomney I will appreciate these words when I see ur actions. If ur true u will be speaking out a lot.  HELP! CHOOSE PPL OVER PARTY! https://t.co/1VA2O2BKCH
@theBicyKyle I am Pete Rose‚Äôs 2000th hit, years old. 		Cool ‚Äúgame.‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump The only thing ‚Äúproven‚Äù is that Dems are being more fiscally responsible. U said we didn‚Äôt have $3.4B to fund medical appropriations...so how do we suddenly have &gt;$5B? We ALL agree immigration reform is needed but not at expense of tying our kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids to debt. COMPROMISE!!
@realDonaldTrump Your obsession with Hillary is not rational. Methinks you have a crush.  Though, with the unhinged tweets of recent days, it looks more like you‚Äôve lost your mind. I simply cannot believe you are president. Despicable.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with this.
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs something.  At least they‚Äôre trying to get things back on track for the American people. You know...the ones you supposedly represent? Just because someone is not a supporter of you doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt represent him/her. But you wouldn‚Äôt know anything about that.
@msilver @jayholler @igb To each his own. IMO, it is among Lynch‚Äôs most glorious episodes of pure insanity. I‚Äôve read the entire series, even those finished posthumously, and continue rereading. Just as I rewatch the film.  Both are amazing in their own rights.
@igb @The_Artifact You won the inter webs with this one.	#InyukChuk
@ChristyBRLTWP @reefruler @Paisano @RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror Let it go @reefruler. This one‚Äôs a nut job. Omar got less than 15% of the vote &amp; is a convicted criminal. There‚Äôs a reason he lost  so incredibly in 2018, &amp; it‚Äôs not because he had a good opponent. He is just a bad one. That‚Äôs not an opinion, but a fact based on his support.
@ktumulty Come on...out this genius. Nothing wrong with that.
-$5 billion could give clean water to Flint, MI.	-$5 billion could provide universal pre-K to every child in America.	-$5 billion could house every homeless veteran on the street.		There are a lot of useful ways to spend $5 billion. Building a wall isn‚Äôt one of them.	#TrumpResign
Let‚Äôs see...that means there‚Äôs a tweet coming, from @realDonaldTrump, inexplicably deriding Goodlatte &amp; Gowdy for being weak, that the witch hunt continues, or something re: FBI bias. Anybody wanna put a wager on it?	#TrumpResignNOW #BadLeader #TreasonWeasel https://t.co/jh1BkA2OKn
@JimmyS96566737 @NancyPelosi You do know that BOTH Rep and Dem Congressional members jetted off for vacations, right? Silly, IMHO, that people use 50% of facts for their own narrative. If u want to blame people for leaving, blame everyone. And it‚Äôs not like they (R‚Äôs &amp; D‚Äôs) have anything to do. Sadly.
@realDonaldTrump And to think...until this tweet I thought u couldn‚Äôt be any more despicable. Using a child‚Äôs death as a political chess piece is so heinous that I have now words to describe u, which is a first. I bet this single tweet loses u actual votes &amp; changes some opinions of u. Truly sad.
@d1hoops @harleybailey1 @RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror Ok. I can accept that.  Nice to know you‚Äôre 100% supportive of Trump‚Äôs tax returns being subpoenaed by the new Congress. Cheers.
@ChristyBRLTWP @reefruler @Paisano @RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror Yup. Just like his gameplay in 2018, which garnered barely 14% of the vote. Everybody has the right to support whomever they wish. I will never support a proven criminal.
@HillReporter Good lord...what a dolt. Talk about out of touch with reality.
@Paisano @RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror No. Voted against Omar. I live here and can‚Äôt STAND Waters but the thought of Omar in office (which barely 25% approved) would be worse. That‚Äôs why we vote ‚Äúnone of the above.‚Äù
@mikedloschiavo @RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror @realDonaldTrump Yet there is still no evidence of such ‚Äúcrookery.‚Äù Not even enough to make a prosecutor THINK about an investigation. I can‚Äôt stand her (and I live here) but asinine investigations like this are what the right has been screaming about since Trump won. Yeesh.
@BonnieHsm321 @RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror Um...have you not seen Trump‚Äôs gold interiors at any of his numerous ‚Äúestates?‚Äù I‚Äôm therefore assuming you don‚Äôt take issue w/ the R‚Äôs who travelled to Puerto Vallarta, Cuba, and Cabo last week for vacation. These attacks (from both sides) are asinine. Most of these folks have $$
@harleybailey1 @RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror You do know the Dems tried to change this rule some time ago, but the the Reps voted against it, right? Look up the stats...there are far more wealthy Rep folks in Congress than Dems. I love how pithy attacks have gotten. Someone has $$ (D or R) &amp; the other side cries foul play.
@LindseyGrahamSC You had countless opportunities to ensure our nation had proper leadership at the exec branch head, but your choices have finally backfired on you, and the rest of us. Merry fucking Christmas.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Man...the entire contingent of Trump men is obsessed with Hillary. Methinks you ALL have crushes. Get on with your life already, before you‚Äôre relegated to dropping the soap next to Bubba. 	#TrumpCrimeFamily
@GOP This, coming from the party who blocked the $3.4b spend for the ACA because we couldn‚Äôt afford it, but wants to spend more than $5b for a stupid wall. We need immigration reform and stricter laws, but a wall doesn‚Äôt do this. You guys look like clowns for pushing this on Dems.
@RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror Sounds like jealousy to me. Can‚Äôt stand her, but dislike you even more. Happy holidays.

@BEighteenstone Don‚Äôt get too excited. He‚Äôs an outgoing Senator who has had issues w/ Trump (haven‚Äôt we all).  Seems that none but the ones retiring will open their mouths. The rest r either totally complicit or scared of falling victim to a Tweet. Now if even a handful would do the same...
@JackPosobiec Good.
@JackPosobiec @RaceWarMachine Solely for the purpose of making gajillions on a book. Then again, what do I know. I‚Äôm just a ‚Äúprivileged white 45 y.o. male.‚Äù And I‚Äôm a happy cat person...not a mad dog dude. Nice post though. Cheers.
@JackPosobiec @RaceWarMachine Age? I dunno. Conviction? Maybe. But no matter the true cause for his resignation, he exited of his own accord which makes direct parallels to current situation untenable. I doubt we‚Äôll ever know the complete story, but Mattis doesn‚Äôt strike me as a guy who‚Äôll write a tell-all(4)
@JackPosobiec @RaceWarMachine While I believe this has always been so, I don‚Äôt think any POTUS has so blatantly built a cabinet of ‚Äúyes men/women‚Äù as we see in the current admin. Again, rightly or not, this time around the block, Mattis refused to (continue) be the ‚Äúyes man.‚Äù (3)
@JackPosobiec @RaceWarMachine I also would guarantee that fewer people were as engaged in the politics of military leadership as they are today (rightly or not). One phrase that strikes me in the gut, however, commented on the politicization of military leaders during the Obama years. (2)
@JackPosobiec @RaceWarMachine I actually read this article when was first published, and didn‚Äôt, necessarily, disagree with it, except on opinions of how military command ‚Äútreats‚Äù civilian supervisors. It‚Äôs difficult, however, to draw a big comparison, as this time, Mattis left of his own accord. (1)

@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan So, you‚Äôre discussing ‚ÄúTrade‚Äù with Turkey, while our government is closed? What happened to (white) nationalist Donald?
@realDonaldTrump Does Mr. Shanahan KNOW he is committing suicide?	#TrumpResign
@Runningnothy @realDonaldTrump Indeed. Either his ‚Äúbase‚Äù isn‚Äôt on Twitter or they‚Äôre scared. There is virtually no support in his Tweets. Let‚Äôs hope this is a sign for 2020.
I despise retweeting, but this is worthy.		Oh yeh, to my @gop friends, ur not gonna want to watch this. It pretty much sums up why I left the Rep Party. One can be a fiscal conservative yet a social liberal, and STILL be human. Sadly, the current Rep Congress can‚Äôt say the same. https://t.co/FpKH0dKuQq
@RepTimRyan I don‚Äôt know you, but this is a righteous rant, man. Can‚Äôt say I disagree with a damn thing you said.
Ima leave this right here. @realDonaldTrump what happened to draining the swamp? Did it go out the window like Mexico paying for the wall? Or has ur infatuation/crush on  @HillaryClinton &amp; obsession w/ @BarackObama thrown you off course? I‚Äôll take my answer on-air. 	#Trump #Davos https://t.co/0joFzq9MTL
I recently posted an obscure article about the striking similarities of the birth of Naziism‚Äôs power under Hitler, and the rise of @realDonaldTrump &amp; the perpetuation of narcissism as a ‚Äúmain ingredient.‚Äù  Interesting to now see this (very well written) piece. 	#Trump #Narcissist https://t.co/mtV9iYb8Bj
@yourauntemma Excellent. Sad, but excellent.
@NYTScience By immediately putting tariffs on them after vetting, of course. 	ü§≠
@Newsweek While this is sad, it is also best Xmas present I‚Äôve received yet! Now...if he would just resign, the world would be a better place.
@realDonaldTrump Actually, we‚Äôre just fighting for you. Had you not been such an asshat, treating enemies like friends and friends like enemies, maybe we‚Äôd be working WITH YOU!	#NeverTrump #Asshole #MeanGirl #PornStarLaughRiot
@realDonaldTrump How is it fake that they‚Äôve reported exactly what you just stated? Your desperation is incredibly, and happily, beaming!
@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not fake news but I hit hard. Look @ ur Tweets u ingrate. You‚Äôll see how UNFAKE the vitriol is for u. At least Obama takes up more real estate in that tiny little mind of ur than all ur properties combined. Besides,u put the world @ risk by HOW u withdrew. I call that CRAZY!
@realDonaldTrump Btw...it just occurred to me after skimming pages &amp; pages of comments that of the  ‚Äúmillions of followers‚Äù you‚Äôve oft bragged about, nearly 100% of the comments here illustrate true disgust in what u do, what u stand for, and most importantly... WHO U ARE! Excited for 2020? I am.
@realDonaldTrump Somebody call the freakin WAMBULANCE! So you spend a couple of days away from your family, turning to Twitter in an act of butthurtedness. All the while, how many children are still separated from their families? You wanna get back to me on that? Sounds good.
@FYMYGIRLS @diamond_cbd You got it Barb. It‚Äôs EXTREMELY important, especially this is likely done with intent. Happy holidays.
@RepJoeKennedy @_Ben_Franklin1 I applause you for doing this within the confines of Twitter. It coulda/shoulda been a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG list.
@_SJPeace_ This is was TRUE WINNING is about.
@carolynporco It‚Äôs hard to wrap my brain around how individuals can interpret the Constitution in such starkly variant ways, which makes it difficult to say one interp is wrong vs another. All we can ever have is hope, that both precedent &amp; what‚Äôs right, is preserved &amp; perpetuated. Happy Xmas.
Mr @realDonaldTrump, this is how true leaders speak. Opposition is natural...derision and bullying is not. https://t.co/FdwMPtyire
@Saintsfan5348 @Bornabrit1 Ditto. My two kids are 50% Hispanic from their mom. It offends me to my core when I think of family in the Midwest who support Trump. Sadly- oh so sadly- I have had to rethink personal relationships because of Trump. I‚Äôm 45 years old. I would have NEVER thought this could happen.
@ManInTheHoody You won the inter webs today.
@carolynporco I hate the thought of a party-based SCOTUS, but the fact is that individual Constitutional  interpretation seems to run along party affiliation. With Trump‚Äôs nominees, Ginsburg LITERALLY changed the course of action on this vote (among others).
@AnnCoulter Otherwise he would have done all the things ur drivel of a column stated. You and all your racist friends have been hoodwinked. Trump cares ONLY for himself, and a little bit about his family. He couldn‚Äôt give two shits about u or your ilk, as long he gets big fanfares at rallies
@AnnCoulter U give Trump way too much credit. For someone as smart as u I t‚Äôs surprising. Though, knowing he cares so much of fame, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs ur ploy. Face it... Trump is in way over his head &amp; until everyone ADMITS that u will continue facing disappointment. He never cared about a wall.
@AnnCoulter Sooo...because he resigned due to philosophical differences, you automatically turn on your hatin‚Äô squack box? He‚Äôs a good man, with honor, who could have left w/out staying on for transition time. Happens every day in life, yet your corrosive attitude derides him. What a bitch.
@moderndadpages @Brimshack @realDonaldTrump Really? You can‚Äôt believe it? There is an egomaniacal narcissist in the WH, but you can‚Äôt believe it? Only thing I can‚Äôt believe is that Republicans still support this ‚Äúman.‚Äù
@RubenDelWell @realDonaldTrump Laughable. And you don‚Äôt even speak proper English. Don‚Äôt forget the bipartisan bill that the Senate approved, that he wouldn‚Äôt. This is on no Reps or Dems, this is squarely on him. Nobody with an ounce of intelligence sees it any differently. Not even Trump.
@EyezWideOpen46 @realDonaldTrump I get your point, but that assumes said President is a man of integrity &amp; country.
@moderndadpages @Brimshack @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre totally wrong. It‚Äôs not nagging. It‚Äôs YUGE!
@cynsha @NBCNews BINGO! You won the inter webs today.
@NBCNews This is just bullying on Trump‚Äôs part. For those slamming Dems, look at it like this: Republicans don‚Äôt want centralized medicine due to taxpayer cost &amp; ask why they should pay, yet they are fine telling Dems, who embrace diversity, that they must pay for a wall. Pot=kettle. Sad.
@KamalaHarris How this has taken so long to pass legislation is beyond me. What appropriate rationale could lead to it NOT passing? Seriously, this is almost as despicable as everything Trump does. OK...maybe not THAT bad, but it is still abhorrent. When will this end?
Hey @diamond_cbd , u just lost a long-time customer. Even though I don‚Äôt take particular issue w/ the specific additives I DO take issue w/ ur misleading ingredient sheets &amp; quantities. This is blatant abuse of customer trust for $$. U should b ashamed. 	#cbd #diamondcbd #cbdoil https://t.co/GvKwqnZT0H
@NuclearAnthro That‚Äôs awesome phraseology, there. Like mother used to say: ‚Äúyou can have trust without love, but you can‚Äôt have love without trust.‚Äù Keep up the good work, both you &amp; @MuckRock. Happy holidays.
@ASlavitt Mueller? R u freakin serious? Mueller? How in the world can Meuller‚Äôs ‚Äútaking Manafort away from his 2  beautiful children‚Äù be equated to family separation at the border? I won‚Äôt discuss the border policy here, but I believe the quote ur looking for is ‚Äústupid is as stupid does.‚Äù
@CillizzaCNN Ahhh...counting exercises. Who said that ends after grade school? Trump is certainly not counting.
Incredible to see how much we knew multiple centuries ago. https://t.co/HgllIojsdt

@realDonaldTrump No...they‚Äôre voting for NOT BEING BULLIED, &amp; joining your ‚Äú@gop colleagues‚Äù in saying that this is not the right way to do things. Same way u passed on DACA. I believe this is what mama meant when she used the phrase ‚Äúthe pot calling the kettle black.‚Äù Sad that ur such a douche.
@realDonaldTrump Well...that‚Äôs ONE ‚Äúperson.‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump Um...no. That is all.
@realDonaldTrump Um...no. Heroes &amp; success stories don‚Äôt need to brag. They let their actions speak for them. You are a disgrace to the office &amp; the people u serve, and are a cancer on society. 	#Trump #Cancer #BeBetter #Sad
@Ron_Clements @realDonaldTrump Which has likely happened more than once.
@realDonaldTrump There has never been a president who has been dirtier, more CROOKED, &amp; sided with non-allies, than you. Heroes and success stories NEVER need to brag...they let their accomplishments speak for them. You are a disgrace to the office, and a cancer on society. 	#BeBetter #Trump #Sad
@michaeldweiss Gee...how is this not a surprise?
@MSNBC Come on.  There are bigger, more influential whoppers than this. I will NEVER defend this rat, but #5 is typical political hyperbole. All politicians make promises like this, especially on the trail. At lease choose lies that are detrimental to our country. There are 1000‚Äôs of‚Äôem
@TIME Nope. Have you read their cash-flow reports? No way.
@gtconway3d @karaswisher Nobody. Not a damn one of them.
@CREWcrew Yes. Now, ask me how comfortable I am that this will actually occur.
@altclassic Phew...I thought this was another Trump meme. Alas...it‚Äôs not. Just one of the best tunes to come out...EVER.
@AnalysisFact Such a joy to wake up to something real. You know what else a M√∂bius function has? No political affiliation!
@WhipHoyer @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump Come @gop...for once...at least once for this Congress, choose country &amp; YOUR OATH over Trump to do the right thing. How many of your constituents will suffer from this? Just once, decry the bullying tactics. If ur gonna do the wall, do it the right way. JUST ONCE!	#JustOnce
@realDonaldTrump Wait...you‚Äôre calling someone out for ‚Äúranting &amp; raving?‚Äù I believe that‚Äôs what mama meant when she used the phrase ‚Äúpot calling the kettle black.‚Äù And ur infatuation w/ Hillary borders on psychotic. Methinks there‚Äôs a crush here. Since on the topic of cliche quips, u are a POS!
@amandacarpenter Actually, unless I‚Äôm wrong, no sanctions have been lifted. The Treasury made a recommendation which was followed by saying the new congress would need to examine it. Let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves &amp; spread ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù Good lord...I hope that doesn‚Äôt sound like a Trump defense.
@octoberskeye @mkraju As if he‚Äôs different than any other current Republican Congressional member. They‚Äôre all fucking cowards.
@sarahkendzior What a shock. Congress punting on a (nother) Trump/Russia issue. Fucking cowards.
@dillonliam You‚Äôre wrong. 		Professor guy: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not all THAT politically correct.‚Äù		üòâ		What a total blight Mr Professor Guy is.
I don‚Äôt want to say this, but the increased # of decisions made of this nature, sadly, the more I fear the comparisons of Trump to Hitler being true. Ugh. No, I don‚Äôt believe it (yet), but this type of action is contrary to how our country was founded. 		https://t.co/MlEjEdS38i https://t.co/4AjHyE0kdS
@Chris_Meloni Yep. And surrounded by ‚Äúonly the best and brightest people in the world.‚Äù
@mkraju Par for the course. But @marcorubio won‚Äôt actually DO anything, about ANYTHING Trump does. Well, except whine about it. What ever happened to Congressional checks on the executive branch? Guessing they went out the window w/ ethics &amp; integrity. In other words, words mean nothing.
@smilon713 @PrincessBravato I‚Äôm pretty sure ‚Äúethics &amp; integrity,‚Äù as we have defined them over the years, are now antiquated ideals &amp; do nothing but illustrate weakness in strategy. Read a different way, they are nonexistent in these monolithic companies, and governmental &amp; congressional leadership. So sad.
@CarolBe65050353 @StevenTDennis Nope.
@HamillHimself Thanks, man. For everything.
@marcorubio @stuffnsew Then fucking DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL, and stop being a mouthpiece for Trump. Put the country first, for once in your life, and call for immediate sanctions. Severe ones. Prosperity is no substitute for integrity. How would you explain ur lack of actions to ur kids if they asked?
It is beyond me how @realDonaldTrump has even the (dismal) 38% approval rating that he does. Lie after lie continually surface, yet the @gop stands behind him &amp; his (fucked up) base stands behind him. This country has changed so much in my 45 years on earth. Sad	#Trump #liar #sad https://t.co/zVdmIlq3bY
@Xynyx2001 Of course it is. Legally, politically, economically, and socially. Thankfully, the social aspect of control has dwindled, largely due to the internet, but the others are still blatantly so.
@realDonaldTrump Your infatuation with Hillary, nearly 2 years later, sure appears to be more than about Mueller. Methinks there‚Äôs a crush here, considering how much real estate she owns in that tiny little head of yours.
@brandoinsac @realDonaldTrump So, because I disagree w/ your ideology, I‚Äôm a ‚Äútool?‚Äù It astounds me to see average citizens hating &amp; leveling name-calling to other avg citizens, because beliefs r  different. So much hate...not enough tolerance. Disagreements don‚Äôt mean one must resort to 3rd grade antics. Sad
@brandoinsac @realDonaldTrump Totally agree. Trump is indeed a ‚Äúdumb tool.‚Äù Thanks for posting!
@2blrose @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm sorry...did I mention anything about the deficit? I love how you assume I‚Äôm a Clinton fan...typical. Ur blind assumptions r part of a big problem in this country. Just because I made a statement, u automatically write a narrative u know nothing about. Both sad, and funny.
@mflynnJR Why don‚Äôt you ask the same thing about the myriad of allegations @realDonaldTrump makes? So, because Hogg has an opinion (albeit hyperbole) he should add specifics, but when your god-President does the same, he‚Äôs ok for unsubstantiated claims? Hypocrite.
@mflynnJR YES! I agree with all three points. Now live by your words and accept that just today, your father admitted to lies and knowingly breaking the law. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break the law‚Äù is indeed a truism that unfortunately never saturated GF‚Äôs thoughts. Even war heroes can break laws &amp; be held.
@mflynnJR Such hypocrisy. Isn‚Äôt that just like you, hating the ‚Äúd-bag lefties‚Äù because they believe differently than you? Free speech is not an entitlement on a FREE social media platform. Your undeniable hatred of ‚Äúlefties‚Äù is EXACTLY the same thing you admonish here. Come on man...
@mflynnJR I cannot believe this guy is still on Trump‚Äôs radar, for ANYTHING! ‚ÄúLoud mouth disaster‚Äù is putting it lightly. What ever happened to Trump bringing in ‚Äúthe best people...only the best &amp; brightest?‚Äù Even your can-do-no-wrong ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù has no clue what is going on.
@mflynnJR That ‚Äúdesecration‚Äù you speak of is the result of what Gen Flynn admitted today...that ‚ÄúI lied...I‚Äôm guilty &amp; I knew it was wrong to lie. No disputes.‚Äù His war heroics cannot be taken from him, but even heroes must be held accountable for their ADMITTED actions.
@mflynnJR Well, he had the opportunity to speak today, &amp; did. I believe it went something like, ‚ÄúYes...I lied...I‚Äôm guilty, &amp; I knew lying was wrong.‚Äù Even heroes w/ stellar resumes must be held accountable for their actions. He will always be a war hero in my mind, but now a guilty one.
@BuckSexton I believe this is called ‚Äústandard investigational tactics.‚Äù Nice try.
@paulsperry_ @mflynnJR Even heroes should be held accountable for lying to FBI.  His misdealings don‚Äôt erase wartime heroics but they tarnish what would have been an incredible legacy. Nobody is above law. How many times did Trump say he was the ‚Äúlaw &amp; order cand/president? Guilty is as guilty does.
@WSJPolitics Gee...that‚Äôs nice...only a year later.
@marcorubio @CACoreyU Then fucking DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Stop being a mouthpiece for @realDonaldTrump &amp; act, as a senator for the United States of America...not some ‚Äúparty-first‚Äù loyalist who allows this abominable act to go without severe punishment &amp; sanctions.
@realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúInteresting?‚Äù Don‚Äôt you mean, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared AF this asshat has sung, and I‚Äôm nervous to have the American people find out how all my lying &amp; dealings with Russia influenced me to win the election. ‚ÄòCause I know I‚Äôll be going to jail once all the facts are realized.‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump If that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôd hate to know how much YOU cost the U.S. a year. The damage u have done will likely take decades to repair, &amp; even more $$. Please oh please...let old age take you soon.
@realDonaldTrump Good holy moses on a popsicle stick. You are a (sad lil) broken record these days. I‚Äôm glad u don‚Äôt realize how all this whining, &amp; the misleading Tweets, illustrate how scared u are. I can‚Äôt wait until the stain that u are is wiped from the earth. Hopefully soon. Oh yeh, FUCK U!
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/MxgIkqIWnm
@realDonaldTrump Wait...PLEASE NOTE: 	A sitting ‚Äúpresident‚Äù is advocating committing the crime of breaking and entering? Did I read this correctly? Good holy moses on a popsicle stick...the circus never ends.
@mjfree Sadly, it‚Äôs not funny.
@TheDogs92363437 @AmbJohnBolton Indeed. Welcome to Trump‚Äôs world order.
@AmbJohnBolton Yep. Killing journalists is tolerated, as long as we further U.S. priorities in the region.

@ToomeyMemes @SenBobCasey @GOP Only in your head. Makes sense to me, having been advocating &amp; fighting from many strange avenues, for years. We‚Äôre done here.
@ToomeyMemes @SenBobCasey It does indeed as it goes directly to the @gop &amp; their ongoing battle to usurp the rights of patients. While unrelated on  surface, it goes directly to the ongoing stigma &amp; war the @gop has launched on chronic pain patients. You gotta think outside the box here. They‚Äôre complicit
@ToomeyMemes @SenBobCasey It‚Äôs a matter of how individual Senators r  casting votes to regulate medication, w/out any medical training.  My meds have been reduced due to Congressional pressures (as have millions of patients). I‚Äôd like to know who is thinking of BOTH the epidemic, as well as those in need.
@TheInfo29414138 @badmf07 @HandOfGod82 @Kenan_Santiago @seanhannity Yes. By covering up his affairs for fear of blowing his campaign, he did exactly that, by suppressing 15, 19, &amp; 26th amendments. His attempted bans also suppress 4th Amdm rights, which is why he lost in court. I could go on, but I‚Äôm running out of room.
@seanhannity I don‚Äôt recall you having the same fervor when a nearly identical comment was made by a Republican, stating that liberals and/or Democrats should not be able to vote. Selective outrage. You‚Äôre as bad as a bot, man.
@joncoopertweets @Marmel Mr Rudy Giuliani should be on that list.
@realDonaldTrump Each day that passes, each tweet you send, &amp; and every moment of every day, I am still in awe of how little respect you have for the office you hold. It is beyond me, and I cannot wait until you are dead and gone.
@realDonaldTrump Um...you do know that negligence is no excuse for breaking the law, right? Oh...sorry. For a minute, I treated you as if u actually respected the law. My bad.
@realDonaldTrump ASS HOLE!!!
@SenBobCasey I appreciate ur message, but what are u doing to protect those of us who live in chronic pain, due to legit medical issues? From here, all it looks like is that you‚Äôre trying to make it more difficult to obtain the meds I need, &amp; have been on for years, of which Fentanyl is one.
@SenatorIsakson @GOPSenFinance @senorrinhatch So, by saying this, are you also saying that you agree with his comments re: Trump &amp; ‚Äúnot caring?‚Äù This is a serious question for you Senator. I would like to know if you agree with @senorrinhatch. Thank you in advance for clarifying your message.
@joncoopertweets Being a conservative is a choice, being gay is not. Therefore, cry me a river, Chad, ‚Äòcause I have zero fucks for how scorned you feel.
I love that it‚Äôs the less obvious players who are holding the nails that are (hopefully) going to be driven in to the coffin of @realDonaldTrump.  I bet Trump never considered that having a Pecker in his back pocket would be  anything but pleasurable for him. 	#Trump #TrumpFamily https://t.co/CKpniJYUR2

@MittRomney Man of vision? What...selective blindness?
@realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs a pretty good record, if judging against your 5000+ lies you‚Äôve told (as tallied and reported this week) to the WORLD.  Soooooo....
@realDonaldTrump Why? Your answer is in the WH bathroom mirror.
@funder Hummina hummina hummina.
@SenBennetCO As usual, the only thing he truly cares about is his narcissistic ability to control everything around him. He couldn‚Äôt give two squirts about what is going on, only that he controls it.
@GavinNewsom Apparently, this is only true if one is a supporter of Trump. The rest of us should, obviously, be silenced. [rolls eyes - sarcasm].
@CBCWorldNews Hey @Keysdisease41, one of your brothers in arms just got taken down. So much for racists always winning. You guys will inevitably be silenced, as there is no room for hate in this world...at least not toward people who don‚Äôt deserve it.
@Keysdisease41 I think it has more to do with filtering out (any of) the 5000+ (tallied &amp; counted by WA ethics group) blatant lies the POSPOTUS tells.  They‚Äôre not meant for the public at large, just the minority of imbeciles (like yourself) who will believe anything they‚Äôre told.
@Keysdisease41 @newsmax Odd. I didn‚Äôt see any mention of North Carolina on your page. Another brainless, spoon fed troglodyte. Though, I greatly appreciate your page. It is, at once, hilarious, and a reason why finishing elementary school is so important. Keep up the good work!
@Keysdisease41 You just described Trump‚Äôs entire employment history.
@Keysdisease41 Um...our military didn‚Äôt even touch the border. Time to click off of Breitbart and stop being spoon fed information.
@Keysdisease41 YOU‚ÄôRE.  It‚Äôs YOU‚ÄôRE, damn it.
@Keysdisease41 Good holy moses...you are one MASSIVE moron, as well as a racist. There‚Äôs not even a SEMI logical link here. Yeesh. No wonder people bash on Trump supporters for their lack of intelligence. You‚Äôre living proof of such opinion.
@EdKrassen Did I miss it, or has it not gone live yet? Curious to read.
I won‚Äôt cast my opinion on taxation here, nor will I comment on the wall. What I WILL comment on is the elegant simplicity of @EdKrassen. Occam‚Äôs razor is sharp, and shows no signs of dulling. Especially for @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/09uoGtyvOz
@krassenstein @suechef828 I believe the correct emotion for this is, ‚Äúabsolutely no fucks given.‚Äù  They‚Äôre not worth the real estate in your head.
@NRO Such an inane teeet. The right demonizes PP for caring as well as the abortion issue, as if it‚Äôs their exclusive service. What percentage of PP are related to abortion? Less than 3%. The other 97% goes to helping those ‚Äúpoor‚Äù folks you speak of. They‚Äôre a great organization.
@krassenstein @BardGroupie Oh please please PLEASE let this be true. Hopefully he will be the first Trump to fall in the line of many.  I‚Äôm not a hateful person, but this family has become a smear on all that is good &amp; just. @realDonaldTrump might like to sell sell sell, but shortly it‚Äôll be CELL CELL CELL
@Keysdisease41 @krassenstein ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre.‚Äù  It‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre,‚Äù damn it.
@krassenstein And he‚Äôs complaining about the costs associated with Mueller. Humph. It‚Äôs all one big dog &amp; pony show. He has not a care about anything but his egoist tendencies, whatever he thinks makes him look good. Or a donkey, if Melania‚Äôs involved. 		[Did I say that out loud?]
@KymShimmin Hmmm...ok. It didn‚Äôt seem completely correct to me, so I looked up the transcripts only to find it was indeed incorrect. If I‚Äôm incorrect, my apologies, but it appears to be a collection, pieces together. Oh well.  No skin off my back. Cheers.
@ObeyChurchMouth @_PhilGardner @StormyDaniels Absolutely. Often, a shaman utilized sex techniques in various healing or cleansing ceremonies, to name but one example. I get it. Twitter just doesn‚Äôt allow for much intellectual development in one post ;)
@ObeyChurchMouth @_PhilGardner Actually, no we don‚Äôt. Morality is subjective. One person‚Äôs morality might not be mine. As it pertains to men/women in the sex industry, it matters not, to me. I‚Äôve never felt it was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or morally counterintuitive. It just ‚Äúis.‚Äù I explained it in more detail further up.
@ObeyChurchMouth @_PhilGardner @StormyDaniels Yes. My point exactly. Morality is subjective, and should not be defined by anyone other than one‚Äôs self. In other words, zero fucks should be given toward someone who holds a negative opinion of anything I choose to do, especially if they imply it is morally wrong or bankrupt.
@KymShimmin I love having his words documented, but just a friendly FYI (or maybe it‚Äôs intentional), the words in the meme are not correct. While the real one is abhorrent, this one adds some intentional ‚Äústuff‚Äù to make it look worse. Do with this as you will.
@JaimeBrazilXXX2 Man...no worries.  I would react the same way if I thought someone likened me to most despicable human in this country.  My apologies for the mixup. Cheers.

@lawlessirish @Hili75303704 @KellanMartz @StormyDaniels Brah-vo!!! @lawlessirish. Exactly. But I‚Äôm pretty sure there is no convincing Hili.  Not even the LGBTQ+ takes issue with this. I‚Äôm so off topic. I need to exit...stage left.
@JaimeBrazilXXX2 @Hili75303704 @StormyDaniels In other words...I was agreeing with Jaime. Twitter put the comments in a different order. NOBODY is as bad as that piece of shit.
@JaimeBrazilXXX2 @Hili75303704 @StormyDaniels And to be clear...the ‚Äú^^^‚Äù was meant for @JaimeBrazilXXX2 not @Hili75303704.
@Hili75303704 @Sirenz5 @theonlyElDiablo @StormyDaniels While there is SOME truth to this, when a person speaks he/she chooses words. When he/she QUOTES another person he/she uses someone else‚Äôs words. By ur logic the entire British culture is wrong for deeming a bundle of sticks, a faggot. CONTEXT CONTEXT! I bet ur sis would agree.
@Hili75303704 @JaimeBrazilXXX2 @StormyDaniels ^^^ this. She did not ‚Äúuse‚Äù the word. Someone else did, so she called it out. On a similar but tangential point, is it ok for one person to call the rest of the world wrong when said person‚Äôs subjective morality is not met? Apparently only for Trump and you. That‚Äôs what ur doing.
@Hili75303704 @KellanMartz @StormyDaniels You are part of the problem. Normalization is a societal process. Specifically quoting someone is hardly that, especially if you look at her long history of supporting LGBTQ+ causes. Following your logic means subscribing to YOUR morality, which in itself contradicts your words.
@Hili75303704 @KellanMartz @StormyDaniels ‚ÄúFucking f(reak)?	‚ÄúFucking f(op)?	‚ÄúFucking f(emenist)?	‚ÄúFucking f(ucker)?	‚ÄúFucking f(leabag)?		Context is important when reporting truth, &amp; thank goodness she can do whatever the f(uck) she wants, and pay you &amp; your small-minded ways no matter. Not even the LGBTQ comm took issue.
@Hili75303704 @KellanMartz @StormyDaniels Yes. @StormyDaniels did EXACTLY what u were doing- speaking out against this. The only way to speak out, &amp; let people know how abhorrent it is, is to QUOTE what was said. Had she said ‚Äúhe said a bad word,‚Äù she wouldn‚Äôt have been speaking out, just complaining. She stood 4 ur sis.
@nytimes Not a bad list. The Byron book is a very well written tome, weaving the frayed story, not often told, as if having first hand knowledge. Think not...it is what it appears ;)
@_PhilGardner @StormyDaniels Yes...indeed it is.
@_PhilGardner @StormyDaniels The rest of you is right. The part of you needs to beat that part out of you so that the rest of you never thinks about that part of you...or even has is pop in to your brain. 	Nice post man (and this is, of course, all in fun)üòÄ
@realDonaldTrump Wait...so a future POTUS shouldn‚Äôt be investigated if suspected of improprieties? Sounds like a dictatorship to me. Nobody is above investigation...not even a president.
@StormyDaniels Good for you. Stand by the people who treat you well, and forget the others. There‚Äôs enough deceit and name calling from Individual-1 to last a lifetime.
@DrDenaGrayson Excellent work. We‚Äôll see if it aligns, in days to come. I hate to root for collusion/conspiracy/illegal acts committed by a sitting president, but in this case, it appears to be the only recourse we have, since Individual 1 (and I use that term loosely) will never admit fault.
@VLNunn @grinch1967 And I absolutely was not referring to u.  Your statement, though not true, was incredibly supportive and nice. Cheers, and happy holidays.
@VLNunn @grinch1967 Totally agree @VLNunn! It was another thread.  All people own the right to their point of view. Twitter sees little respect, espec since keyboard warriors judge those they don‚Äôt know. 1st Amd will never apply here. Unprovoked attacks r not view points, &amp; are met w/ scrutiny.
@grinch1967 So being a ‚Äúcivilized adult‚Äù is exemplified by calling someone on Twitter whom you don‚Äôt know, an ‚Äúuneducated moron?‚Äù  I believe this is what mother meant when she used the expression ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the pot calling the kettle black.‚Äù Your words are smart. Might I suggest living by them?
@grinch1967 PRECISELY!!! All the more reason NOT to be a keyboard warrior, texting out insults &amp; attacks.  Happy holidays.
@grinch1967 So, you call someone who has differing views than u, &amp; whom you don‚Äôt know, an ‚Äúuneducated moron‚Äù (which couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth)...the same term you used for someone (a TRUE moron) who robbed you? It appears you have anger issues. True or not, that is how u appear.
@grinch1967 Not he...she. Apologies.
@VLNunn @grinch1967 Freedom of speech does not apply to free web apps, especially since we all agree to the rules (no matter how archaic they are) when we sign up. Sticking up is one thing, but considering he attacked me 2nite for disagreeing, I‚Äôd guess Twitter was right in shutting him down.
@JustinTHaskins @Ocasio2018 @grinch1967 so because I disagree w/ you I‚Äôm an ‚Äúuneducated moron?‚Äù Methinks you‚Äôre projecting. Besides, I would never personally insult someone I don‚Äôt know (espec. over a tweet) as it would only illustrate ignorance, intolerance, and hate. Only ‚Äúuneducated morons‚Äù do that.
@JustinTHaskins Yet another narrative skewed to suit a purpose. I‚Äôm no socialist, &amp; don‚Äôt subscribe to the ideology, but the antiquated view conservatives refer to when using the word is NOT what modern politicians consider. No torture, no killing. Unlike Trump, who is nearing dictator status.
@JustinTHaskins @Ocasio2018 Actually, we do...every time Trump threatens and/or ‚Äúveils his theats.‚Äù  Do you need actually tweets that illustrate this? Likely not, since it appears your outrage is selective.
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr Um...have you read any of the ‚Äúpresident‚Äôs‚Äù tweets? At least she‚Äôs not in office yet. What‚Äôs your excuse for @realDonaldTrump? Or are you selectively outraged?
@charliekirk11 @Ocasio2018 @DonaldJTrumpJr All your insults and attacks are very un-Christian. Do you realize your own hypocrisy? And people wonder why so many of us are not drawn to organized religion. 	#NotToBeTrusted #NoCredibility #ChristianHypocrisy #HideBehindReligion #ActAsYouSay #SayAsYouDo #Hypocrite #GoingToHell
@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôve insulted you, derided you, &amp; distrusted you for your actions. You have not only NOT changed, but you‚Äôve become even more grotesque. Now I‚Äôm BEGGING &amp; PLEADING...please stop this. Stop dividing, stop insulting, stop being mean. Ur the POTUS for goodness sake. PLEASE #BeBetter
@realDonaldTrump What does that say about you, who hired him to be among your ‚Äúbest and brightest minds in the world?‚Äù  Then again, if YOU feel this way, imagine how the majority of Americans feel about you? Yeesh...that‚Äôs an NC-17 thought just WAITING to be birthered. I mean birthed.
@ida_skibenes @PrincessBravato So are we.
@CREWcrew This article is from April 2018. Old news.
@CillizzaCNN Ohhhh...my popcorn is ready.
@donlemon I get ur point but can u imagine if Obamas acted the way u suggest (even though Trumps deserve it)? The cons media would say ‚ÄúSee? We‚Äôre right‚Äù and Trump‚Äôs base would have eaten it up.		Lemon shows how he thinks Obama should've greeted Trump @CNN https://t.co/pW7XuMFTlQ
@EdKrassen Old news man. Old news. We‚Äôve known this for decades.
@Jenwunder @TheRickWilson I hope Trump dissipates in xx20.
@TomiLahren The truth doesn‚Äôt hurt me. You‚Äôre the one butthurt &amp; snarky, citing facts that are manipulated w/out context to fit ur narrative. More sickness &amp; disease, both numeric &amp; as a percentage, are present in the U.S. than on your hated caravan. Methinks you need to finish high school.
@TheRickWilson That‚Äôs why all his asshat tweets go from his personal acct and not the potus acct.  He can still block on that acct.
@RealOmarNavarro @RNC @GOP As a life-long Republican, who left the party, the @gop has completely lost its way &amp; has ZERO identity other than a mouthpiece for Trump. They are purely reactionary at this point, w/  nothing more than a muddled, chaotic message. Until that changes, there is NO HOPE for them.
@RealOmarNavarro You do realize Twitter is free, right? It astounds me that people use the 1st Amendment when it comes to this. If you don‚Äôt like it, leave. Actually, just leave all together. The referendum on YOU ended weeks ago when you were destroyed in the polls. Yeh!
@RealOmarNavarro You do realize that the large majority of terrorists do not enter where the wall would be, right? Though, I suppose that‚Äôs giving your intelligence too much credit. You should take Trump‚Äôs dick out of your mouth before you speak.
@briantylercohen @OccupyDemocrats Seriously. Hypocrisy knows no bounds. The entire ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù constituency is a fraud after with their continuing support of @gop &amp; @realDonaldTrump
@dprite1 This is TRULY a pinned Tweet. Not to mention its truth. Bravo sir. Brah-vo.
@NewYorkStateAG @Kokomothegreat Yet, NY looks the other way when it comes to Trump issues, as illustrated in their refusal to charge @IvankaTrump &amp; family with knowledge (even with paper proof) of illegally inflating values of condo/hotel prices. So...it‚Äôs obviously SELECTIVE ‚Äúnot standing for.‚Äù
@RepStevenSmith Totally agree. Trump is insanely jealous of Obama, as is illustrated by his near-constant thoughts and tweets about the man. Gay, maybe? Man crush? Had to settle for a Slovenian model, but really wants the ‚ÄúKenyan.‚Äù Yeh...many forms.
@RepStevenSmith Why are you so damn divisive? Wouldn‚Äôt your feed better serve you with messages of policy issues, rather than ripping on people? You do realize you represent both Rs &amp; Ds, right? Come on man. Have some respect.
@RepStevenSmith Well...looks like @IvankaTrump deserves similar scrutiny. Where is your fucking outrage on this? And don‚Äôt say ‚Äúapples &amp; oranges.‚Äù
@RudyGiuliani You obviously didn‚Äôt learn enough.
@RudyGiuliani Twitter is free homie. If you don‚Äôt like it, then leave. Actually, just leave...all together. There‚Äôs an island in Denmark, I hear, that will be up and running soon. Jagoff.
An absolutely heart warming, tear invoking, laugh inducing &amp; incredible funeral for George H. W. Bush. No matter your political affiliation, we lost a President, and he was honored in a truly wonderful manner today. 	#GeorgeHWBush #funeral #president #41stpresident
Perceived or real, the Trump family continues illustrating practices that are abhorrent &amp; predatory. @IvankaTrump is as guilty as her father, but gets a pass on nearly everything.  It‚Äôs time she be introduced to the criminal justice system. Where‚Äôs comeuppance when its needed? https://t.co/Ud9s0zrmY5
@andreathekline @JeffreyGuterman You won the interwebs with this one.
@JeffreyGuterman Good. He‚Äôs tarnished everything he supposedly stands for, rightly or wrongly. Political operatives &amp; their tactics would use Avenatti‚Äôs (perceived or real) indiscretions against him, &amp; serve as strong motivation for moderates &amp; R‚Äôs to vote R. I‚Äôm not assuming guilt...just sayin.
@godgunsglory78 @chelseahandler @CNN Totally agree. Trump is an idiot.
@chelseahandler Big article @cnn yesterday about this very thing- no revisiting of identity &amp; strategy following midterms. Why? They are more scared of Tweets from a maniacal President than their constituencies. It‚Äôs a sad state in American politics, mirroring the infancy of a dictatorship.
@3rd_Infantry Right on! What‚Äôs the difference between the white belts and the neon belt colors? Just curious. Thanks to all of y‚Äôall for keepin us safe, and for all your sacrifices. We do not forget.
@TeamTram @TheDLCC This video is perfect. Humility, pride, &amp; passionate humanism at its finest. We need more representatives like you, who care more about their communities than they do about political power &amp; perks. Congrats from a random guy in California. Well wishes, as u bring change.
@TheRickWilson Uh oh...Trump just touched the leader of Argentina. According to @TheRickWilson he‚Äôs now dead!

@realDonaldTrump Absolutely despicable to outright lie like this. Your narcissistic, egoist approach to everything has damaged all things good &amp; noble. No matter ur policies, u have soiled the office of POTUS 4ever. It‚Äôs ok to be wrong. It‚Äôs not ok to hide behind cont‚Äôd lies only to stroke ur ego
@krassenstein That has yet to b proven. I despise Trump &amp; his actions r abhorrent but there is no precedent-setting case to associate w/ a president‚Äôs ability to restrict press in this way. If this goes to litigation it will reach SupCt &amp; be a landmark case. Don‚Äôt let ur opinions cloud facts.
@realDonaldTrump Good. Stay there.
@JeffFlake Come on man. It‚Äôs obvious potus is indirectly attacking you. Not to mention making a continued mockery of the office. THIS is all you‚Äôve got?
@EdwinMi81698176 @RealOmarNavarro Thanks for providing laughs beyond laughs. The entertainment value of your prophetic ramblings is only surpassed by your (illustrated) closed-mindedness and reliance on assumption. Ahhhh...I needed that. Obsess much?
@darkstarxxxx1 @RealOmarNavarro That‚Äôs the fault of those who wrote the ballot measure. I was shocked it didn‚Äôt get repealed, but the way Prop 6 was written made it doomed from the start. We need to speak up about the PROCESS...not just the end resulting issues.
@EdwinMi81698176 @RealOmarNavarro No we don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the lie that is continually told...and people like you believe it. USE YOUR OWN MIND, not the media‚Äôs agenda. Just because we live here doesn‚Äôt mean we r all evil and want illegals to overtake us. We bleed, just like you. Assumption divides us...THINK 4 URSELF
@PressSec You‚Äôve crossed a MAJOR line with this. Your career legacy just hit an all time low in the annals of Press Secretary actions. For someone who CLAIMS to not lie, your actions just debunked your words, for the world to see. Shame on you, and I hope you get your just deserts.
Despicable. If your government does THIS, it‚Äôs time for a new government. 	@PressSec #Trump #SarahSanders #Lies #Deceit #EnemyOfThePeople https://t.co/xlNkPTJDgN
@BlkWaterDivers @RealOmarNavarro Twitter police alert! Despising Trump as well as @RealOmarNavarro does not imply any such notion, &amp; assuming you know my morality only makes you appear inept. Being a Libertarian (to me) means I DON‚ÄôT ASSUME based on party. Ur a hypocrite for doing what u called me out 4. Cheers.
@JohnDou01995952 @RealOmarNavarro Makes a bit more sense.
@RealOmarNavarro Barely 28%? That‚Äôs pitiful for someone who a) swore up &amp; down he‚Äôd win, b) swore by the Trump agenda, &amp; c) just swore. Never a Waters vote have i casted, only a vote against you. You might have had more than 28% if you‚Äôd stuck to issues &amp; not started the insults. Laughable.
Ugh...WEIGHT...not WAIT. But seriously...the packet stated 2 stamps. I don‚Äôt care about the extra $ but I am concerned about ALL BALLOTS being post marked and delivered at the correct time. This seems problematic to me.
I live in CA. As per my mail-in vote packet it stated 2 stamps should be affixed. I always hand deliver ballots to P.O. &amp; when I got there a line of people were told the mailing fees would be an additional $0.21 due to wait. What happens to ballots people dropped off? @CNN #vote
@GOP @GOPChairwoman But please...keep up these Tweets. You‚Äôre only burying GOP candidates. This might garner the votes of a few TODAY, but you‚Äôre turning the voters of tomorrow in to Democrats. Soooooo...thank you!
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Really? For 2 years? I‚Äôm not a Pelosi fan &amp; personally I think she needs to go, but this is the most laughably ridiculous thing I‚Äôve heard since Trump claimed to have 40% approval of blacks. STOP being a Trump propaganda account &amp; START acting w/ the best interest of the country.
@RealOmarNavarro @RNC @realDonaldTrump Ok...so 1st off, it‚Äôs ‚Äú...office THAN out.‚Äù 2nd, your own party echoes what I‚Äôve been saying all along - you‚Äôre not worth your weight in salt. Take a hint homie...you have nothing other than the ‚Äúcult,‚Äù which is good for nothing more than coordinated thinking. 	#TakeTheHint #HaHa
Not that folks need any further proof of @realDonaldTrump lies, but the irony here is priceless. Either way, it‚Äôs sad- sad that this man walked free, sad that the POTUS is such a narcissistic liar. Political hyperbole is one thing, he‚Äôs just a fucking liar. 	#Trump #TreasonWeasel https://t.co/m2yH4Vt2Nl
@Redistrict @CookPolitical We need to be careful about all these ‚Äúhell yeh...Blue Wave‚Äù remarks or it‚Äôs gonna scare the Republican base in to getting off their couches and out to the voting booths. Not that‚Äôs NOT a good thing. 	#JustSayin
@Kvelez7 @RealOmarNavarro Yup. I had the same experience. Started out w/ typical hyperbole then quickly went south. I thought we had a good candidate. That quickly changed &amp; was turned off. I can‚Äôt stand Waters, but I would NEVER vote for @RealOmarNavarro. I almost did. No R‚Äôs in my circle r voting 4 him.
@Temo100888 Sure would be nice if you could offer any educated thoughts IN COMPREHENDIBLE ENGLISH! You‚Äôre a fucking troll idiot who really has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about. But I thank you for the laughs!! Please, keep posting...everything you say is GOLD, &amp; is hilarious. Have a nice day.
@Kvelez7 @RealOmarNavarro No...he‚Äôs really not. His campaign told me OUTRIGHT that he only uses Twitter to bash, insult, &amp; belittle people...nothing more. Is THAT the kind of person we need in Congress? Not in the slightest. It‚Äôs not about majority rule, but about common issues that matter in the district
My response to @RealOmarNavarro who continuously uses disparaging rhetoric to belittle &amp; insult a large portion of the people in his district. Then again, his campaign stated he does not use Twitter to discuss issues, only to bash the citizens he wants to work for. What a dolt. https://t.co/xMDD1VLWIx
@RealOmarNavarro You do realize that the district you are running in has many of those ‚Äútypical leftists,‚Äù right? Why would anyone want someone in Congress who DOESN‚ÄôT want to represent a large portion of his/her district? I will be sooooo glad when you lose, and must crawl back to your hole.
@JYSexton @PrincessBravato You are TOTALLY wrong. Dems have taken it for granted that the public is on their side, for too long. We‚Äôre only now just finding out how racism &amp; fear of minorities is still alive and healthy in America. They‚Äôre not smarter...Dems have the same tech, and use it. Folks just suck.
@CREWcrew Not that this will actually bring repercussions. It takes a government NOT invested in partisanship to recognize issues such as this.
@ProudResister You tweet as if you‚Äôre surprised. Come on man...
@rickjnewman @Lawrence I get your sarcasm, but it‚Äôs come on man.  Respect the situation. Making light the way you have is the same reason Trump has been bashed for his actions in the last couple of days. Of course, ull say ur serious &amp; not making light...but you are.
@LisaM3732 @SteveSchmidtSES Never gonna happen. I‚Äôve learned that we are damn near the minority. So much of middle America and the south (ie MILLIONS of people) are not progressive.  In other words, they‚Äôre afraid.  It used to be that Republicans were just stingy (simplified).  Now...who the fuck knows.
@SteveSchmidtSES Though, in this case, @LouDobbs is a total and complete moron &amp; deserves anything he gets. So, in that case...carry on. Carry on.
@SteveSchmidtSES Ugh. both sides, Dem &amp; Rep have these crazy conspiracies about organized ‚Äúmachines‚Äù in motion. Most ‚Äúconnected‚Äù folks r just idiotic, not involved in bigger schemes. It‚Äôs the quiet, unknown folks (D &amp; R) we need to worry about. You‚Äôre perpetuating problems, just like the right.
@thomaskaine5 Sounds as if she‚Äôs just like Trump then. Money is what drives her politics. Sad.
Aaaaand the @LADodgersHQ win Game 4! Oh wait...
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump But it‚Äôs not ONE nutjob @LindseyGrahamSC. Have u not seen the MASSIVE increase in racist rhetoric and profiling since your buddy Trump took office? It‚Äôs one ‚Äúpipe bomber‚Äù nutjob down, but does nothing to the growing #‚Äôs of white power groups. At some point even u must admit this.
@TuckerCarlson @TuckerCarlson then LEAD BY FUCKING EXAMPLE!  Political insults are as old as this country. This is the first time in history, however, that a sitting president continually attacks citizens, past presidents, &amp; world leaders. It won‚Äôt stop til it does at the top.

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Well...you just lost my vote the next time you are up for re-election. Forgiving him because he pays legal fees is a joke. We DO need healing &amp; unity, but that won‚Äôt occur until he CHANGES HIS ACTIONS. You‚Äôre a putz for suggesting he can buy his way out of his misdeeds. 	#BuhBye
@realDonaldTrump Yup.  @CNN isn‚Äôt in the Oval Office so they are not held to the same standards as the leader of the free world.  Then again, Merkel is a pretty nice lady, from what I hear.
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre a son of a bitch. What‚Äôs going on is that people have their minds on something way more serious than your ‚Äúpartisan politics first‚Äù motto. Pull that orange head out of Putin‚Äôs ass and think about something beyond yourself. Reading scripts from your writers doesn‚Äôt count.
@oputa77 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump You disqualified yourself from any debate, by ASSUMING who I was, how I affiliate, and (laughably) what news I watch. That‚Äôs the problem with the Trump cult. You think anyone who doesn‚Äôt like him must be a ‚Äúcommunist libby snowflake.‚Äù  Assumption gets u nowhere but laughed at.
@ConnellStan @missjedahdyah @muhamadkhurshid @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Nah...I‚Äôm not a fan of inviting people to tell me MY OPINIONS  are wrong. I despise the man &amp; truly wish he was dead, but there have been some positive things occur. I‚Äôll give you one, though:	-He has pulled the cover from the @gop, which has allowed them to be seen as they are.
@TRILLIONAIREPR1 @POTUS @FLOTUS Obsessed with me much?
@TRILLIONAIREPR1 Obsessed with me much?
Obsessed with me much?
@TRILLIONAIREPR1 Nah...I‚Äôll stick to things that actually don‚Äôt come from the sewer below your nose. Why are u suddenly so obsessed w/ me? If u need help coming out of the closet, I‚Äôm not your man, so I suggest u move along to chasing another guy in to your bedroom.  Nice to know I got in ur head
@TRILLIONAIREPR1 @KellyannePolls @POTUS @FLOTUS You have made my night! I didn‚Äôt think this level of stupid really existed, but uv proven it does!  U have no clue what ur talking about, nor do u have an inkling of comprehension of what the word ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù means. Personally, I think your new obsession w/ me is cute. Gay much?
@TRILLIONAIREPR1 @POTUS @FLOTUS BWAHHH...because I disagree with you? Actually, that‚Äôs what MAKES me American - the ability to call out blindness when I see it, or feel any old way I choose. If your definition of a bad American is this, then you are indeed a communist at heart. I suggest educating yourself.
@oputa77 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Another sheep bowing at the feet of Trump. The media is not the enemy of the people. In fact, a free press is fundamental to the democracy u thought u understood. Without free press, we are China, Russia, N Korea.  Trump gets what he deserves and sadly, people like u need it too
@TRILLIONAIREPR1 @muhamadkhurshid Umm...you are as dumb as your comment. Please look up the definition of terrorism. Once you‚Äôve done that, stop laying the blame in one place. This isn‚Äôt because liberals or conservatives caused it. It is a round-robin that Trump has made worse every day.
@Lermont @muhamadkhurshid @ShutUpPabs @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Good holy moses on a popsicle stick are you clueless. These liberals you speak of are likely your friends &amp; neighbors that ur pejorative picks on. Since you obviously don‚Äôt know them, how in the world can u speak about their future actions? You truly have no clue.
@missjedahdyah @muhamadkhurshid @ConnellStan @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump No president has ever lied so deliberately, blatantly divided us, disgraced private citizens &amp; other world leaders, or encouraged violence. He gets what he gives. He‚Äôs accomplished some really good things, but they are overshadowed by his lack of respect &amp; dignity. He‚Äôs a bully.
@muhamadkhurshid @TRILLIONAIREPR1 @realDonaldTrump U have no idea what ur talking about. Living in Pakistan is definitely a challenge, but it is impossible for a non-American to understand the levels of discord, hate, &amp; deceit this president has stooped to. If you lived here for any length of time prior to him, u would understand
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Sake of unity? We have a ‚Äúpresident‚Äù who blatantly lies, encourages &amp; incites violence, &amp; is a disgrace in his treatment of countless private citizens &amp; world leaders alike. This doesn‚Äôt touch the potential legal issues he faces.  I‚Äôm not an MSM guy, but he gets what he gives.
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre a fucking disgrace.
@mjfree Ummm...you seem shocked. Nothing Trump does is shocking. Don‚Äôt stop (ie normalize) the anger in response to his rhetoric, but don‚Äôt be shocked either. This man has no true conscience.

@brhodes What‚Äôs your point? Anyone who hasn‚Äôt already realized the hypocrisy of Hill Republicans is either lying or complicit. Republicans have done some good things, but with Trump at the helm, the (lasting) damage done far outweighs the good &amp; could take decades to recover from. Sad.

@RDemore @maltman613 @FrankLuntz @MichaelAvenatti You can do whatever the hell you want. My opinion is my own, and comes with zero fucks given to anyone else‚Äôs.
@TheSun [Rolls eyes] When will the public stop trying to enforce individual morality mandates on others? Why would I care what others believe immoral, if I don‚Äôt take issue with my own actions? Morality is highly subjective &amp; as long as it‚Äôs not illegal, who TF cares...
@TWlTTERBouncer @FrankLuntz @MichaelAvenatti No, but that is merely ONE case he has taken. He has oversaturated his appeal, IMO. He needs to dial back the rhetoric a bit &amp; stay on task, while making good on every commitment made. He should know that EVERY move he makes is scrutinized, including personal &amp; business matters.
@maltman613 @FrankLuntz @MichaelAvenatti As u should be. In this case however, as well as his countless on-camera monologues, perception is growing that lends itself to Avenatti having ‚Äúlost his way‚Äù &amp; indeed fits your noted ‚Äúpejorative.‚Äù He‚Äôs over-saturated his public appeal by wasting words. He needs to dial it back.
@samsondenver This gave me a happy feeling in my belly. Really, it did.

@pthompson1509 @RealOmarNavarro Coach, u obviously have not read his bio. He uses his Twitter acct for the sole purpose of bashing.

Or the Springfield, MA church that was burned to the ground. Should I go on?	#ViolenceIsNothingNew #FuckTheGOP
@RealOmarNavarro @foxandfriends Or you could pick a neutral channel, rather than hiding behind Faux News and their racist, mysoginist, blatantly untruthful people. Your desperation wreaks of falling poll numbers. I have never voted for Waters, but there is always a first for everything...just to keep you out.
@JamesLiamCook You know...because this administration accepts such treatment of women.
@JamesLiamCook Personally, I prefer the look from the lady in  magenta, standing behind Con-yay - she be tryin not to get ‚Äúear-humped‚Äù by one of his crew.
@Texan_21C @SharedFreedom @davidmweissman @WSJ David...you just described me. Thank you.
Love it! https://t.co/JifzNISRav
@mcspocky @RawStory And to think that there was a tiny piece inside me that felt sorry for her. Whelp...that just flew out the window.
@JessicaLandi3 @mike_Zollo Delivering on SOME promises while isolating us &amp; insulting everyone along the way in far worse rhetoric than anything I said. So you get worked up ‚Äòcause a random twitter person says ‚Äúfuck‚Äù but POTUS gets a free pass. Hypocrite.! You are a fucking sheep Jessica. Too bad. Block me
@JessicaLandi3 @mike_Zollo Your hypocrisy knows no bounds. Since you refuse to answer many of my questions, this will be my last response. You threatened to block me, yet support a President who talks about grabbing women by the pussy. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me what he does as long as he makes us look so bad
@JessicaLandi3 @NickDaigneault1 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. The right has become emboldened by the rhetoric of the maniac in office. He is a direct reason for the HORRIBLE rise of ANTIFA. I would never defend their actions, but there is a clear reason (eg PERSON) for the rise. They‚Äôre no better than the right.
@JessicaLandi3 @NickDaigneault1 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 Seriously? Did you NOT read about the Vegas shooter? Or the Charottesville killing? It‚Äôs not isolated to only far right (a la the Sen Scalise) but going back as far as the mock hangings &amp; burning crosses following the Obama election, the right has historically been more violent.
@JessicaLandi3 @NickDaigneault1 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 Unhinged? You‚Äôre right! Have you called Trump out for the same? Based on your page, I would say ‚Äúno.‚Äù As you asked politely, it is not an issue to refrain, but hypocrisy is one the ugliest of qualities...one I (personally) find far more appalling than profanity.
@JessicaLandi3 @mike_Zollo And as I said in an earlier response, those who judge based on anything other than knowledge &amp; experience, such as yourself, are a huge part of the problems in current societal &amp; politics frameworks.
@JessicaLandi3 @mike_Zollo No anger issues whatsoever. I just take issue with folks who claim one thing follow with actions on the contrary.  Now days this is more prevalent than I remember in my 50 years &amp; it truly sickens me. I don‚Äôt go out of my way to find hypocrites, only those in common threads.
@SteveScalise @JessicaLandi3 Again @JessicaLandi3 your support of this is asinine. How many times has Trump used similar/more vitriolic rhetoric, being cruel, BLATANTLY LYING, &amp; blowing his dog whistle? I can‚Äôt stand HRC but come on...are U really this fucking stupid? Ur page shows who u are- not independent
@mike_Zollo @JessicaLandi3 Perfect example @JessicaLandi3. Not all ‚Äúthe left‚Äù thinks this, but you‚Äôre too fucking blind to search out the truth as you see fit. You support ALL liberals being categorized in to one boat, so don‚Äôt try to wiggle out of your words by eschewing with new ones when called out.
@JessicaLandi3 @NickDaigneault1 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 Just for kicks, google ‚Äúkill liberals memes‚Äù and ‚Äúkill conservatives memes.‚Äù It‚Äôs totally not a scientific response, but you‚Äôll get the idea...hopefully. The extreme right (now seeped in to establishment right) is much more hairtriggered. 	Open UR fucking eyes. It‚Äôs BOTH PARTIES!
@JessicaLandi3 @NickDaigneault1 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 I said libs r the violent ones. Did u forget about Charlottesville or Vegas? Did u forget about the burning crosses &amp; mock hangings when Obama was elected? It swings both ways &amp; is ONLY on the extremes of both. I didn‚Äôt judge you, I commented on YOUR WORDS. I made no assumption.
@dannymilner1970 You are such an idiot! Why? Because you straight-up ASSUME! I‚Äôm a #ProudLibertarian seeing this country ripped apart by partisan fuckheads like u who stand a party line rather than compromise. U ASSUME who I support &amp; ur wrong. I don‚Äôt tow party line. U? Yup, still a fuckhead.
@NickDaigneault1 @JessicaLandi3 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 And your comment is false, but believe what you will.  She said she would not do that, the same way Kavanaugh says he won‚Äôt abolish Roe vs Wade. And why are Reps STILL hung up on HRC? It‚Äôs been nearly 2 years! Fuck! Get on with your life &amp;  ENJOY what you have. 	#ProudLibertarian
@JessicaLandi3 @NickDaigneault1 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 You lump all Dems in, but forget about the mock hangings &amp; burning crosses when Obama was elected. Don‚Äôt fool yourself...it‚Äôs BOTH sides on their extremes. This is nothing new it‚Äôs just that Trump is so hated in many parts that it outshines any accomplishments.	#ProudLibertarian
@JessicaLandi3 @NickDaigneault1 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 Then you are obviously not following any FOX ‚Äúnews‚Äù personality &amp; have a very small number of conservatives u follow. I see these comments daily,  sadly. Same with ‚Äúliberalism is a disease.‚Äù Really? A disease? Most libs I know, u wouldn‚Äôt know their political bent unless asked.
@NickDaigneault1 @JessicaLandi3 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 Fuck Hillary. Why does everyone think just because someone doesn‚Äôt like #Trump, how he acts, treats people, or otherwise, immediately thinks that person loves Hillary? THAT is the problem with both liberals &amp; conservatives...closed minds. You illustrate that.	#ProudLibertarian
@lindar69471825 @JessicaLandi3 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 Trump is the swamp.
@NickDaigneault1 @JessicaLandi3 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 I wish it could be. I‚Äôve never been more embarrassed at our system than I am now. Conservatives truly hate liberals and constantly wish death upon them. This is only going to get worse before it gets better &amp; no utopian wishes sadly will not come true until the hate stops.
@JessicaLandi3 @charliekirk11 @USATrump45 Good holy moses on a popsicle stick. You truly are a moron. I‚Äôm not an Obama fan, but this will never happen. Please return to your cult and don‚Äôt open your mouth until you have some factual info to offer. Signed, EVERYBODY.
@Mike_InIllinois @tearsonurcheek @samfraulino @VdubTDI @dfalls38 @RhondaBrami @charliekirk11 That would be 8 years. What will Trump‚Äôs avg be when he‚Äôs out of office? Likely astronomical. Just saying. Don‚Äôt skew the math to fit your narrative. Numbers don‚Äôt lie.
@charliekirk11 @NavaNavaallard This is an asinine comparison.  Every single president except trump took a full salary and pension, and carries full service detail. While I‚Äôm not an Obama fan, his wife was more active in both the country &amp; world than any First Lady.  Trying to bag on Obama for this doesn‚Äôt work
@dannymilner1970 Oh...Trump won indeed, but you‚Äôre still fucked in the head.
@patmiletich @Charlie75798432 @DylanByers @MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr It‚Äôs probably ‚Äòcause context on the inter webs is non-existent &amp; a majority of the American public despises what the #Trump family is &amp; stands for. Such a sensitive subject in today‚Äôs world will definitely bring people out of the woodwork, espec when a respected person supports.
@Hugh2D2 @PensiveTM @patmiletich You won the inter webs today, @Hugh2D2
@stipemiocic ‚ÄòCause @danawhite is a punk &amp; lives by $$ not integrity. Used to really dig him &amp; his ‚Äúfuck‚Äôem‚Äù attitude but after not standing up to the religious/cultural hate spewed to @TeamKhabib by the McGregor camp, he has shown us his true colors. And Stipe should get call.	#FuckDanaWhite
@JonnyBones Hardly man. You‚Äôve proved over and over that you do not belong in the @ufc, based on YOUR ACTIONS.  Whether he got the belt through a win or because your lame ass couldn‚Äôt follow simple rules and regs is irrelevant. U got tons of chances &amp; wasted them all. 	#DeadBeatDaddy
Lastly @danawhite &amp; again, not that u‚Äôll care but I have always admired you &amp; @ufc BUT unless the McGregor camp faces major penalties, you have lost my $$ &amp; I will do what I can to have others follow. AND IM A CONOR FAN (but no longer).	#McGregor #mma #ufc #DanaWhite #ufc229
Not that you care about my viewership @danawhite but I can‚Äôt be the only one. @TeamKhabib deserves a fine &amp; likely a suspension, but #ConorMcGregor camp deserves expulsion. Please do the right thing here, though I‚Äôm doubtful u will.	#UFC #DanaWhite #NoIntegrity #BanMcGregorCamp
I have watched every UFC since they were televised @danawhite and love the shit talk. If you do not stand against the hate &amp; religious/cultural attacks &amp; expel these Islamaphobes then the @ufc proves it stands with the hate against @TeamKhabib	#KhabibMcGregor #ufc #ConorMcGregor
How can u @danawhite allow this in the UFC? The only black eye will be on u &amp; the UFC if u allow McGregor &amp; corner to remain in the sport. How can u blame @TeamKhabib for being enraged? He definitely shouldn‚Äôt have done it, but I would have done the same. 	#ufc229 #KhabibMcGregor
Seriously @danawhite this is bigger than UFC or ALL THE $$ in the world. You cannot allow this to go unpunished &amp; more than has been done. Conor‚Äôs ‚Äúchilling in Jahanum‚Äù is nearly as bad. Shit talk is fun. This is not shit talk, it‚Äôs a cultural &amp; religious attack under ur watch.
@danawhite how can you NOT fine &amp; expel McGregor‚Äôs corner for calling @TeamKhabib a ‚Äúdirty fucking Muslim rat?‚Äù There is no place IN THE WORLD that this is acceptable &amp; if you don‚Äôt take major action, then it illustrates your support of the words. #BanMcGregor #KhabibMcGregor
@danawhite how can you NOT fine &amp; expel McGregor‚Äôs corner man for calling @TeamKhabib a ‚Äúdirty fucking Muslim rat?‚Äù Not to mention McGregor‚Äôs ‚Äúchilling in Jahanum‚Äù remark. Shit talk is fine, but there is no place in THE WORLD for this. If you don‚Äôt boot him, you support him.
I‚Äôm continually embarrassed by the state of American politics. Yet, @realDonaldTrump et al have called Dems weak, no gumption, non-fighters who sow us in to kowtowing to everything. NOW Dems are fighting &amp; they change their narrative, as usual. Sadly his vase follows blindly. Ugh
@bpolitics Guys...you need to police your headlines. Every single day is a new ‚ÄúTHIS is the race to decide the House.‚Äù Purely click bait, even if the article provides good coverage of a race.
@LaMonica @_Joy_R @krassenstein @carnmcgrath Most sad is that u lump all white women in to 1 category.  We r fighting to break this perception as well as racism that DOES exist, but ur categorization is wrong the same way calling all black men criminals is wrong. It works both ways. Judge independently, not on the few.
@LaMonica @krassenstein @carnmcgrath While there MIGHT be someone who would do this, I believe most states have already moved past this, as is evident by the people of color they have elected. Sadly, some of our southern states are the ones lagging behind. I wish u well &amp; hope we can prove u wrong by future actions.
@krassenstein While I applaud women in ANY job (including combat), the answer is not to blindly elect based on gender, but to elect the BEST &amp; MOST QUALIFIED to carry the fight. If that‚Äôs a woman...great; if that‚Äôs a man...great.  As long as he/she is THE BEST FIT.
@MichaelAvenatti You are flat out wrong. You‚Äôve politicized something that should not be. This is not a Republican problem, or a ‚ÄúDem‚Äôs that don‚Äôt....‚Äù ALL of those descriptors should be replaced with the word ‚ÄúPEOPLE.‚Äù  Don‚Äôt make the partisan problem worse than it is. This is a SOCIETAL issue.
@EllenTrailerDog @Lawrence @Jeopardy @TheLastWord @MSNBC You just won the inter webs, Ellen!
@CaliforniaLabor Yeh...but we barely need it in California, but for a few (very) select districts - um...@DevinNunes.  Now, if it carries over nationally, we‚Äôll be set. Let‚Äôs hope.
@GaryandShannon craziest booze sneak? I used to walk with a hollowed out cane, which was also a vessel for libations. I stood in the middle of a consulate building entry (in L.A.) refreshing myself and those with me. 	Nothin to see there...nothin to see. 	#SneakyBooze
@BruceBartlett @louwho27 Don‚Äôt understand? It has nothing to do with Kavanaugh. It‚Äôs just one big pissing contest...neither side wants to lose to the other. If Kavanaugh was a three-eyed, blue, talking pig, the right would still swear he is the best ever! That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre broken - neither side gives.
@Lo_G_72 @kerrijacobi @atensnut @Alyssa_Milano Ahhh...another hypocritical fake Christian. Now I get it. No true christian would be so hate filled &amp; just flat out mean, derogatory, or judgemental.  I‚Äôd feel sorry for you but it‚Äôs easier to laugh at you for being convinced you‚Äôre a person of HONEST faith. Such a piece of shit.
@SaRaAshcraft @kerrijacobi @Jim_Jordan @BillEagle1951 Good holy moses on a popsicle stick. Now I get it. Ur just a fucking loon. Slinging lies so far out of the realm of reality that only those w/ similar brain deficiencies could agree. Same with people who think Trump peed on hookers...asinine. Don‚Äôt believe what you‚Äôre spoon fed.
@SaRaAshcraft @kerrijacobi That is so laughably imbecilic I had to chuckle. Why so filled w/ hate? And why would u make such an abhorrent comment? If you‚Äôre joking then you should be ashamed; if you ACTUALLY believe this then you need to seek immediate help. Most Dems &amp; Reps are not bad, just those like u.
@Lo_G_72 @kerrijacobi @atensnut @Alyssa_Milano Um, if you truly believe that, then you are a sick individual. Why would u even make such a remark? Percentages &amp; statistics have PROVEN that someone u care about has been assaulted yet has not told her story. What if that‚Äôs your mom? Your hateful rhetoric is part of the problem.
@kerrijacobi @Sally_S @SenJeffMerkley You do know the absence of mention is proof of absolutely nothing, right? Whether it‚Äôs flying, or sexual allegations. Do you truly lack the ability to understand that? Besides, if he is ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty‚Äù then Ford‚Äôs is innocent (&amp; truthful) until proven a liar. Yeesh
@StevenBeschloss That‚Äôs because @JeffFlake is a coward. He‚Äôs still going to vote to confirm Kavanaught, and isn‚Äôt doing anything other than trying to salvage some sort of (perceived) legacy (in his own mind).
@thomaskaine5 @LindseyGrahamSC @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @DNC @TheDemCoalition @ChuckGrassley @HouseJudiciary @maddow Oh lordie. Not that I don‚Äôt think all these dudes are corrupt, but that seems about as conspiracy theorist as it gets. Prognostication of this sort does nothing but hurt the cause.  Focus on facts, and let the @goo hang themselves.
@tribelaw @mrbromwich Forget that...how can he continually interfere? You‚Äôre a lawyer...explain that, please. The checks and balances for each of the three branches unequivocally state that the executive cannot interfere with SCOTUS confirmations, yet, it seems all Trump has done is interfere.
@PalmerReport @JanieMom @Fleacatt @FinFox2 @ItsMeCathi @SenFeinstein @senatemajldr That‚Äôs what you‚Äôve become.
@PalmerReport @JanieMom @Fleacatt @FinFox2 @ItsMeCathi @SenFeinstein @senatemajldr You can push back, calling members of the public ‚Äúmalicious liars,‚Äù - hmmmm...just like Kavanaugh did - but in the end, your readers (or ex readers) have grown tired of you being wrong yet still swearing everything you say is shrouded in fact. Trump does the same thing.
@PalmerReport @JanieMom @Fleacatt @FinFox2 @ItsMeCathi @SenFeinstein @senatemajldr And those are hard numbers.  Not opinion or wish but fact. After that number, I sent you a note explaining the results but never saw word-one of a response. Since I did it myself it proved to me that u, a once good source of info, have become the malicious liar, &amp; I unfollowed u.
@PalmerReport @JanieMom @Fleacatt @FinFox2 @ItsMeCathi @SenFeinstein @senatemajldr No. I‚Äôve sent you several messages and notes illustrating how your prognostications and ‚Äúfacts‚Äù were either proven wrong or never came to fruition, which is a drag, as I used to really appreciate you.  I tracked your stuff for a month - 85% was either wrong or never occurred.
@Fleacatt @FinFox2 @ItsMeCathi @SenFeinstein @PalmerReport @SenateMajLdr I used to read Palmer Report, but 85% of his stories, which I tracked, were either completely false or didn‚Äôt come to fruition as he said they would. He‚Äôs become a hack, which is a drag, as I used to appreciate his stuff. Too bad.
@AriFleischer Um...are you blind, or just so jaded that you are blind to the truth? What‚Äôs with the whole ‚Äúone beer‚Äù thing? That, along with just about every other word is complete fabrication for his own narrative. If that‚Äôs not mocking, or at the very least, trolling, what would you call it?
@NYinLA2121 Wait...what did I miss?
@nytimesworld That‚Äôs too bad. She‚Äôs  in some of my favorite recent Chinese films. WTF is up with the richest of the rich always trying to skate these laws? Uh ummm...#Trump...[cough]...
@realDonaldTrump You are such an unbelievable tool, that you make the word tool look good. In fact, not only are you a tool, but a broken tool. Stop your harmful rhetoric and focus on bringing people TOGETHER! Can‚Äôt wait til you are out of office or dead. Not wishing harm, just natural passing.
@PressSec @LindseyGrahamSC You‚Äôre a partisan hack &amp; nothing more than a pawn &amp; mouthpiece. If his undignified tantrum is what gets u off then you‚Äôre an even bigger loser than I could have imagined. I can‚Äôt wait until comeuppance is before you, as you have lost the respect of anyone seeking truth.	#Sanders
@subpop @RollingStone @_Mudhoney It‚Äôs so damn good. @mudhoney you‚Äôre my heroes.
@ReaganBattalion BOTH SIDES have made a mockery of the Constitution.  Each has attempted to weaponize &amp;/or skate the finest lines of legality by egoist, partisan scofflawing.  It makes me sick to watch it all, as the entire world either cringes or laughs at us. So incredibly sad. 	#VoteThemAllOut
Enough is enough. These swamp rats have been around too long, and are obviously a BIG part of the problem from the right. The left is just as guilty.  They all need to go. 	#VoteThemAllOut #Corrupt #Sad #Vote https://t.co/ZbmMJ0V3fr
@mgallagher822 @JeffFlake @AnaMariaArchil2 Incredibly powerful video, and while you were both confrontations, you did not fall victim to baseless name calling and other Trumpian tactics. You are both to be commended.
@BryanDeanWright @brian_holan The ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù needs to form a new, independent party where there are no aisles to cross but what‚Äôs best for Americans, not senatorial egos. I left both major parties, as they all need to go. Revolution is right but leave the true fighting to the asshats, while we work together
@ryanjreilly @oliverdarcy @GOP @DNC @BenjaminG302 I‚Äôm sorry...do you know me? You‚Äôre as bad as anyone else who castigates and passes judgement, sowing greater division in our country. So much hate and vitriol, you‚Äôd think at least the public could be civil, when the entire gvt is basically one big clusterfuck.
@ryanjreilly @oliverdarcy This is asinine. Putting a cap of a week is tant amount to nothingness. How can any ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù be legit when under a gun?  What if it would take 8 days to complete? I have never been more ashamed of our gvt than I am today.	#Insanity @gop @DNC #VoteThemAllOut #JudgeKavanaugh
@JeffFlake My guess is that a majority of Americans only want the chance to see a thorough investigation conducted. Whether you vote to confirm or not, asking for a delay until a completed investigation was the right thing to do. Thank you very much.
@LindseyGrahamSC while I have always admired you, u have proven me a poor judge of character. You showed the nation who u are. Ur place is the 8th Circle, in the Fifth Ditch. Make no bones about it...that is your eternity. In my opinion, it‚Äôs too good for you AND ur family. 	#sad
@JeffFlake I saw ur actions in the elevator. U are a piece of shit coward. No matter who is believed, rushing this is wrong. 		This breaks no Twitter rules -I will celebrate your death, as you have proven to be someone this earth need not have. I wish you no harm but will celebrate that day
@SenPatRoberts You fucking coward! Whether you believe him or her, the RIGHT thing to do is to NOT rush it through. The one good thing about this? You will be voted out come your next election cycle. I‚Äôm disgusted to have ever supported you and so are many in Bon voyage you filthy piece of shit
@SenFeinstein You failed. You failed Dr Ford; you failed your constituents (eg ME); you failed the American people. Having voted for you in as many elections as I can remember, I assure you...you will never receive my vote again.
I truly didn‚Äôt believe that I could be more disgusted in our gvt than I have from 2016 to July ‚Äò18...largely due to the spectacle our ‚Äúleadership‚Äù has made of itself. Sadly I was wrong. Personal thoughts on Kav aside, I‚Äôm sick to myself at the partisanship played by both sides.
@JeffFlake Ur presumption of innocence is indeed Constitutionally correct but please explain to your constituency why it is more important to vote ‚ÄòY‚Äô than to merely DELAY the vote? I thought law guaranteed against cruel &amp; unusual punishment? If no delay is afforded, Ford is being punished.
@paulsperry_ @DonaldJTrumpJr And?
I don‚Äôt know who to believe in the #Kavanaugh issues, but listening to him talk, angrily, about how this is a Clinton-driven, liberal, revenge attack makes me think he can NEVER be impartial. 	#KavanaughHearings #Sad #CongressIsBroken #VoteThemAllOut
@DonaldJTrumpJr You‚Äôre a fucking tool.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @MorriseyWV STOP BEING SUCH A MOUTHPIECE!!! We don‚Äôt need more propaganda, but to hear about issues the GOP is concerned with and working toward.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @MattForMontana More @realDonaldTrump propaganda from the machine. You guys used to tweet policy &amp; gvt issues.  Now it‚Äôs all about attempting to fool the American public by constantly being a mouthpiece for Trump. Congress is there to (also) put checks on Pres., but u only check the other way.
@krassenstein Nto defend ANYTHING the @gop is doing these days but there‚Äôs more than one way to handle allegations, if supposedly false.  Fighting back is a common course of action, though ur so anti-republican that ur way is likely ‚Äúthe only right way.‚Äù  I think he‚Äôs guilty, but come on man.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller was not hired to find u guilty nor was he hired to hunt witches. He was HIRED by ur admin to do a job...just like a McDonald‚Äôs employee. He has A JOB, that‚Äôs it. If u have an issue then man up &amp; give order to fire him. See where that leaves u, or SHUT UP!
@Comey The saddest part of this statement? ‚Äú...divided government....‚Äù I can‚Äôt remember a time in my nearly 50 years when partisanship so blatantly usurps country and service. Sad to see good people attacked with such hate &amp; vitriol while those who lack honesty &amp; integrity run the gvt.
@Just_James_65 Unless she sold it and paid taxes on the sale, then...of course...the @GOP puts its blinders back on.
Have you ever read comments in @realDonaldTrump Twitter feed?  It reads like a B-movie critic‚Äôs review, but coming from the hand of an art-film critic - ie Trump gets trashed! For every one ‚Äúmaga‚Äù response there‚Äôs no less than 50 vitriol-filled remarks. Just sayin.	#LiarInChief
@realDonaldTrump I love that this is eating you up. I absolutely just love it. As the sitting president of the United States of America, you will be more beneficial to the planet when you are dead.  That is not me breaking twitter rules, as I do not wish harm...only that your death will be üëçüëç!
@BobsBurgersJon @DonaldJTrumpJr I like it.  No punches pulled or words wasted. Did ya see that Dick-waving Don? Honesty, straightforwardness, and no spin. You could learn something here if you weren‚Äôt such a fop...among other things.
@DonaldJTrumpJr The hypocrisy in Trump veins is hysterical. THIS gets ur goat but the countless disgusting insults &amp; childish whining ur dad does is ok? You‚Äôre a piece of shit &amp; it is my personal wish that you were dead. Not killed or hurt in a twitter-rule-break way, just dead, gone, &amp; silent.
@RealOmarNavarro @RepMaxineWaters Building the wall? Man, are you a laugh. This is state-level politics. There are much more pressing issues than for you to continue shoving ur nose that far up Trump‚Äôs ass. I can‚Äôt WAIT for November...to watch you walk away with your tail tucked between your legs. It‚Äôll happen.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Don‚Äôt fall victim to his goading. He‚Äôs going to throw everything he has at you, attempting to rile you up &amp; ‚Äúprove‚Äù you‚Äôre not a good guy. Fuck him up man...no quarter. Don‚Äôt lose your cool...use your head &amp; wordsmith this guy back to his hypocritical head-hangin home.
Janz is a good man, but even if he was not who he is today, he would still be an upgrade from Dishonest Devin Nu√±es, who is as swampy as they come.  We need him OUT. https://t.co/MyabbuQf5S
@TheRoseWaterFDN @RyanMead78 @ChurchofSatan People don‚Äôt get free passes, especially those who practice such random acts of idiocy.
@MichaelAvenatti Um... that‚Äôs gotta be one of the dumbest, and least constitutional things I‚Äôve heard recently. The people decide who is both a candidate and chief exec. Not pundits, not media. The people. Doesn‚Äôt mean there shouldn‚Äôt be some safeguards, but constitutionally speaking, NO NO NO.
@VP @POTUS Kiss-ass. Think for yourself man. Had a president acted like Trump while you served your state, you would have lost your mind. Your hypocrisy knows no bounds.
@realDonaldTrump Damn, if you just aren‚Äôt the biggest tool in the box. Obsessed w/ the past w/ out a clue of the future. If you practiced unification without deriding more than 1/2 the US public, you might be able to win again. As it stands you will claim election interference &amp; whine until death
@realDonaldTrump This is flat out wrong.  You‚Äôre stupid, or lying, either of which should be enough to disqualify you from your position. It has happened more than 70 times...not the ‚Äúonce‚Äù you claim. Why do you continually lie? Is it because your brain-dead cultists believe whatever you say? Sad
@trueamerica1st @realDonaldTrump Then do it! As it stands, with the amount of hate &amp; vitriol you constantly spew, it is evident that you DO NOT represent a majority of America. You constantly attack more than 1/2 of U.S. citizens. Representing America means ALL OF US, not just your supporters.	#nevermypresident
@realDonaldTrump Are you serious? Man...you are so fucking delusional, it‚Äôs a wonder you can even put a sentence together. Then again, reading transcripts of any speech you gives illustrates how delusional you really are.  Soooo much hate &amp; vitriol. Why? Why must you attack, rather than unify?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Well, given @realDonaldTrump ‚Äúonly the best and brightest‚Äù other hires, it‚Äôs a foregone conclusion that this nominee is bad for the country.
@IvinsJeff @BurnsDuwayne For the win.
@jencraneNYC Still not fully convinced. Now if utilized? Consider me a believer. One can hope.
@realDonaldTrump Isn‚Äôt it a shame that a person holding the office of President of the United States can walk around blatantly making up a narrative of lies, and refuse to admit that he might have made a mistake?
@jencraneNYC It is an AMAZING sign. @BetoORourke is a fresh face. 48-48 in Texas is a win in its own right.
@realDonaldTrump Please note that all of this hatred u assign &amp; spew at and about ‚ÄúDems‚Äù means you‚Äôre trashing 1/2 of the American public. You whine when someone says ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not my President,‚Äù yet this is how you appeal to these people? You man be in office, but until you stop, you don‚Äôt rep me.
@SassyKadiK Someone needs to tell Melania it ain‚Äôt working. @FLOTUS needs to be better.
@bridget_joy_ Yeh, I truly hope @AnnCoulter does not die an excruciating death, during which she is kept alive only to prolong the pain. I REALLY hope someone does not take her out and shoot her. That would be a terrible thing. Please, I beg of you people, DO NOT ASSASSINATE HER. PLEASE.
@marcorubio I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt actually read comments left for you here, which means you‚Äôre either such an egoist and only likes to see his own words, or you merely ignore your constituents. Which is it?
@James_D_Rath @AustinVanl @CBSBigBrother Uh...if this isn‚Äôt the pot calling the kettle black. 		Who‚Äôs this Lefay guy.  Sounds like a kook. 		There was an atheist named Anton LaVey who developed a religion/philosophy called Satanism. There is no god or devil, only you. He abhorred (and forbade) killing. 		EXTREME idiot
@Imelchisedek @Yaeger_Kurome @ballsacksVG @hairy_milk @ChurchofSatan @accioli_gabriel Thank you. This must be one of most asinine thing I‚Äôve read in days, but just in time. I desperately needed a laugh today.
@VP Yeh...a more respectful time. You DO realize who you work for, don‚Äôt you? Besides the American people. You‚Äôre a fucking coward.
@SethAbramson Coward.
@CoreyStewartVA @realDonaldTrump How can he have ‚Äúall our backs‚Äù when nearly every tweet from him is insulting or hating on an entire (and majority) segment of the American public? Serious question.
@realDonaldTrump Is @FLOTUS jealous that you think about and say ‚ÄúHillary‚Äù considerably more than you do her? This obsession is manic, and reminds me of elementary school when a little boy scorned turns to whining, crying, &amp; exclaiming to cover his dejection. Get over it man. 	#TreasonWeasel
@realDonaldTrump I will always respect the office, but winning a vote doesn‚Äôt = winning respect.  Respect must be earned by more than mere positive numbers. Respect is humility, integrity, &amp; honesty. You have NONE of these &amp; while you MIGHT deserve props you certainly don‚Äôt deserve respect. 	#Sad
@realDonaldTrump Man...you‚Äôre on a tear this morning. Seeing you obsess over this, while gratifying, illustrates your inability to focus on WAY more pressing issues. Work on what will improves this ALREADY GREAT country instead of whining about the past, ya damn idiot.
@realDonaldTrump You STILL don‚Äôt understand how gvt works. 3 BRANCHES, all equally as important. IF Congress (ie MANY people) determines they must interfere then it‚Äôs because there is an issue they find harmful; they‚Äôre there to ‚Äúcheck‚Äù the Exec Branch...to PROTECT US from authoritarians like u.
@jencraneNYC End of not only an era, but an institution synonymous with so many extraordinary stories and socially relevant commentary that shaped countless opinions and changed lives of millions. Sad.
@SenJohnMcCain @USTreasury Good bye, sir. You inspired me to be more, yesterday, and today I work toward something ‚Äúbigger than me.‚Äù  Thank you.
@cindymccain You, your family, and your husband have inspired me to do and be more. 		That is all, and thank you.
@ChurchofSatan Nice...but it won‚Äôt compare to the awesomeness that is the CoS Twitter acct.
@tlbauer3617 @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN You need to associate with a better class of people.  If that‚Äôs really the barometer, you‚Äôre not painting yourself in a flattering light. Then again, any supporter of a racist, mean-spirited, boorish, crude liar like Trump deserves scrutiny. We all love the U.S., not just ur cult
@DonaldJTrumpJr Odd. Considering the Trump ‚Äúfamily‚Äù is CONSUMED by CNN, maybe @CNN IS actually the one winning?  Sooooo consumer with ‚Äúfake‚Äù things, just look in the mirror you egoist, racist POS.  See this today?		https://t.co/KXkQwTCW8M
@RealOmarNavarro Seems like the right person is being investigated you immoral twit. I can‚Äôt stand Waters, but I will CELEBRATE your loss. And gee...I truly hope someone doesn‚Äôt do harm to you after this stunt. That would suck. Be safe out there.  One just never knows how fleeting life is.
Listening to @KellyannePolls talk gives me such a body-grounding headache that if she talked any louder, I‚Äôd rather reach for spoons and carve out my ear drums. This woman is so despicable I can‚Äôt even find the proper adjective to describe her. I hope she is not assaulted.
@TheresePicard @TIME Wow. Just wow. You have been sucked in. Even the most ardent supporters should be looking at the office, not the man. You‚Äôre parroting Trump, which immediately upends credibility. Think for yourself. Be a supporter, and fight for what you believe, but humans fuck up. Even Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Well, there is the errant ‚ÄúBorder‚Äù usage, opposed to ‚Äúborder,‚Äù but it must‚Äôve been done intentionally...just to throw us off.
@realDonaldTrump This is OBVIOUSLY not the idiot president, as there are no spelling, grammar, punctuation, or similar errors. That, and it‚Äôs a straight up message, WITH AN ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM SORRY!‚Äù That‚Äôs the dead giveaway. Trump wouldn‚Äôt apologize to his mother for causing pain during birth.
@djwilliams35 Because the @GOP says so.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You DO know that ‚Äúactual Americans‚Äù disagree with your family politics, right? And that they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfake Americans‚Äù or otherwise? Your narratives become more helium-esque every day...light and with no point. Just because we disagree doesn‚Äôt change how American we are.
Ima just leave this here.  Folks are pulling for you all around this country, @BetoORourke. If it doesn‚Äôt happen now, it WILL. The U.S. needs more political representatives like you. https://t.co/q6BQDrJ5il
@realDonaldTrump @NWSHonolulu Well, Trump says it, so it MUST be true. Yeesh.
@KFIAM640 As if anyone needs an excuse to do this at all! Psht.
@Bajiour @rosemcgowan So, the math is pissing you off? HW raped &amp;/or sexually assaulted MORE people than AA (each, &gt;0) &amp; that is your agreement? You do realize this has kinda been the GOP‚Äôs mantra recently, right? 		Doing MORE reprehensible things than someone else still makes both ppl reprehensible.
@rosemcgowan Uh, to me the inclusion of ‚Äúbe gentle‚Äù paints u as a disingenuous hypocrite. 		U have been one of my longest teen crushes! Smitten for years, as a fan w/ ZERO fucks given about ur personal escapades. U‚Äôve always been the ‚Äúit girl‚Äù to me. Until now. 		Integrity &amp; character matter.
@EricTrump So do your wives.
@stevenstrogatz My favorite all time comedic mind. As someone with degrees in both Abstract Mathematics and Systematic Musicology, I feel uniquely ‚Äúqualified‚Äù when listening to his stuff. Had I been Catholic it would have been the Equalatrinity.
@BRFS8 I have heard and practiced this my entire life. One thing I‚Äôve always been curious of, is how far away must a ‚Äúdifferent area‚Äù be? Same box, but several feet away? Different box altogether? Would dig if you could offer insight (pun intended).
@kylegriffin1 Of course you can. If Trump tells the truth, but Mueller chooses to believe someone else (eg Cohen, Flynn, Comey, etc), then he is considered a liar and thus a perjurist.
@sam_vinograd Yes, but lost the view after leaving the rear lavatory.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Please, take your time. And gee...I truly hope your plane does NOT burst in to a fiery ball of excruciating death. It would be awful if that happened to you. I‚Äôll keep good thoughts that you are NOT burned alive as the plane loses engines &amp; plummets, as all you can do is scream.
@TSearcaigh @realDonaldTrump Impeachment means nothing...so, I‚Äôll do nothing. Now, if he is impeached and the Senate upholds it (which will never happen), then we‚Äôll talk.
@Millie__Weaver That is one of funniest, patently false statements made today- give Trump time. Do you have any idea how 1A works? Apparently not, as you‚Äôve just provided the null set of whiny incorrectness. All under a veiled insult. Thanks for illustrating the education gap of MAGA-ites. Sad.
@realDonaldTrump I am proud to be able to say FUCK YOU to one of the biggest pieces of shit the world has ever known...YOU.
@BillOReilly Why SHOULD he do ANYTHING? He does more than enough, and as a private citizen has given more $$ than any other athlete in recent history. He has no ties to Chicago. He is not some savior who gets rolled out to various hotspots...he‚Äôs a private citizen. Don‚Äôt project, you asshole.
@HippiemansPlan Hey, one of the first things I told my wife when we met was, ‚ÄúI like to fart, it makes me happy, &amp; sometimes even chuckle.‚Äù She was mildly confused why an educated man whom she just met, would say such a thing.  Her confusion was replaced by repulsion very quickly but I was happy
@GOP @EricTrump So the Trump propaganda machine is now so incredibly inflated that during a time when Congress should be legislating and helping the American people deal with all that we face, it quotes ERIC FUCKING TRUMP? Truly laughable. Sad, but laughable.
@AtheistRepublic ‚ÄúThe Asian Blue Man Group‚Äôs entourage travels to its next gig.‚Äù
@TheRickWilson An accomplishment who‚Äôs task was as monumental as any other current work. Excited to read this, and congrats! Almost time for a vacation?
@ThomasKlineMD If CPP get cutoff, many will die, but all will suffer. It is extremely difficult to ‚Äúlive‚Äù in such debilitating pain, but reducing/capping meds will bring many of us to ruin, myself included.
@charles_gaba Reagan is ‚Äúturning in his grave.‚Äù This is wrong...and sad. The incredibly divided alt-right populous, to they‚Äôre near-violent delusion &amp; hate, truly saddens me to no end. I appreciate debate &amp; opposition, but this is pure hate. I wish we could progress as a country &amp; as a people.
@DogginTrump @22aspen36 Can you site a source on that committee comment? If enough public pressure is paid to its removal, it might make a difference.
@jencraneNYC I watched them as well, though I never saw 2 air last week so missed that. Some classic lines in film history throughout the series.
@GOP Oh I will be. I‚Äôm doing everything possible to rally voters in my community against anything the @gop touches. You lost a golden opportunity and will only sink further. Mark my words.
@realDonaldTrump Forget the fact that out my back window i see a 20000‚Äô smoke plume. It‚Äôs all a political opp for you. Nvm the loss of life and land. But you‚Äôre right...talk about regulations and policy, not those who have lost everything. I can‚Äôt wait until you are gone from this world.
@marcorubio If you believe this blasphemic hypocrisy you spew is believed by your constituents then you‚Äôre not firing on all cylinders. You can‚Äôt spout scripture in one tweet and act the way you do outside in the real world.  Complete hypocrisy.
@marcorubio That‚Äôs, hippocrate...HYPOCRITE!!

@HowardA_Esq @22aspen36 @realDonaldTrump Brilliant. Pure brilliance. Took a second try or two, but immediately knew its direction.
@SInow He‚Äôs toast.
@pattonoswalt @ThatKevinSmith Way to help out a dude in need, Patton. Very cool of you.
@JoeConchaTV Joe, you‚Äôre so incredibly far off that you don‚Äôt recognize how buffoonish this makes you look. Yeesh...and people watch you?
@ShaunKing Stay strong, call your lawyer, and protect your family. Whatever road that leads you down - hopefully the most conspicuous way possible from your kids. Oh what a sad lesson must be bestowed upon your children.
@RealOmarNavarro @FoxNews @RepMaxineWaters You? Telling people to lay off Waters? You‚Äôre an attn whore of the highest magnitude. She‚Äôs pitiful, at best, but you are just a straight up buffoon. When was the last time you tweeted policy or ideas? What % of your tweets are anything other than insults &amp; tirades? Just sayin
@jules0516 @RealOmarNavarro @RepMaxineWaters @MaxineWaters Waters is horrible, but if you lived here, you might feel differently. I‚Äôve been a California Republican for nearly 45 years, and will not be voting for Navarro.  His anemic &amp; blasphemous, god hating dialog is on full display here. AND, that‚Äôs the good stuff. Both choices suck.
@Mercede98035265 @RealOmarNavarro You‚Äôre even less intellectually stable than Cuckomar.  You do understand what impeachment means and how it works, don‚Äôt you? Psht...apparently not. Asshat.
@RealOmarNavarro @eveolve1121 @RepMaxineWaters @MaxineWaters Pathetic. Your mirroring of Trump‚Äôs divisive rhetoric will fail. Trump spent his life like this &amp; built his name. Simply trying to hitch your wagon to him via being a complete douche will only distance you from the field. Keep it up! You‚Äôre your own worst enemy, and I LOVE IT!
@RealOmarNavarro @FrancoisMarc @RepMaxineWaters @MaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Nah, we just demand LITERATE, well-spoken/typed candidates. In this thread alone you‚Äôve misspelled 6 words. If u can‚Äôt get a tweet right when calling out an opponent, how can we expect you to anything different w/ legislation? And to be sure, U r not even in the ballpark of Trump
@RealOmarNavarro @RepMaxineWaters @MaxineWaters Calling out a candidate, by a candidate, should be met with proper spelling, to say the least. I can‚Äôt stand the woman, but maybe she just doesn‚Äôt see you as worth her time - I sure wouldn‚Äôt. After all, you‚Äôre a strong brown man, in your eyes.  I‚Äôve flushed stronger brown things.
@USSCobblerguy @NathanHRubin It‚Äôs not about doing what DIDN‚ÄôT work, but taking the pieces that DO work and building on that. The only failure would be to indeed do what we know doesn‚Äôt work.
@NathanHRubin Fuck off man. Don‚Äôt lump me in with whomever you‚Äôre referring to. The fact that anyone would lump ANY culture together is in itself racist.  If you‚Äôre feeling some sort of guilt, that‚Äôs you‚Äôre issue. Stop generalizing, even if you think it helps. Make change through daily action.
@realDonaldTrump And you should realize once and for all, it‚Äôs not Meuller‚Äôs investigation. It‚Äôs the American peoples‚Äô investigation, which a Republic administration chosen #Meuller to lead. 		Keep tweetin‚Äô you fucking #treasonweasel. It only shows you‚Äôre getting more scared. 		#TrumpTreason #Sad
@realDonaldTrump It is a philosophical crime that u r President, as u do not represent the vast majority of the American peoples‚Äô respect for integrity. You are STILL acting like a child &amp; I hope that the crimes I speak of become actual legal ones.
@HarleyRouda Keep up the good fight! Stay moral, and don‚Äôt fall prey to the new #trump model of ripping people to shreds, without an ounce of integrity.
@CillizzaCNN So it gives his dumb as an ‚Äúout.‚Äù (In his head only).
@ZanyCountryGeek @funder Not sure what this is, other than an article. Meeting some Russians is different than colluding with them (which I think he did, just not in this pic). I just don‚Äôt happen to believe that even a narcissistic egoist like him would ‚Äúcollude‚Äù at his freakin golf club.
@funder Sorry man. I want the dude out too, and while he is definitely tied up w/ Putin, your post proves absolutely nothing. THIS is the type of material he calls ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù and for this one, I‚Äôd have to agee.
@ida_skibenes ...and NEVER find negative energy because of these holier than thou keyboard warriors. You‚Äôre passionate, and well spoken. Fuck‚Äôem if they don‚Äôt agree with you.
@ida_skibenes Why in the world would you care what some random person thinks of you? Are you so insecure that you dwell, and feel enough emotion to find validation in a digital world? Just because someone says #Resist, doesn‚Äôt make them a ‚Äúbro‚Äù or ‚Äúsis.‚Äù Do what you love, with reckless abandon
@politico It‚Äôs ‚Äòcause Putin said he didn‚Äôt do it.
@RudyGiuliani Wow...you make a comment, &amp; less than 1% of responses are positive, with the other MASSIVE 99% apparently hating you, some urging you to commit suicide, others hoping you die a slow painful death. Do you realize what people post on your comments &amp; just how hated you are?	U R sad.
@HillaryWarnedUs @Marmel Nah...the Clintons have a loooooong history w/ the McCains, &amp; while we‚Äôve never heard public dirty laundry from either (outside of normal horrendous campaign rhetoric) &amp; heard many respectful things said by both families, the vitriol is much older than the last 2 years or so.
@RanttMedia @JenLuvsMonkeys THIS is the list u culled? There are hundreds more bluntly damning tweets than ur few examples. Sure, they work, but this could have been a REALLY cool article had it not been rushed, which is how it reads. These are top-level, easy to locate tweets. Great idea, poorly executed.
@WeirdCrimeFacts @StoriesOfPeopIe Actually...no.  Talk about click bait. He was merely one of the largest contributors of quotes, which is in itself only a portion of the OD.  TERRIBLE storyline.
@nytimes Actually, the analogy isn‚Äôt far off, it‚Äôs the comparisons I have issue w/.  My opinion is that you sugar-coated Trump‚Äôs byline by only listing off things he‚Äôs done, rather than discussing the true impetus behind them - ie, you made him look way too nice. Even in the critique.
FAB legal article from the Clinton impeachment. While all details are written for THAT case I could easily slide #Trump in &amp; a) read &amp; intuit easily, &amp; b) believe it- #TrumpJr too. Fascinating details behind the 4 elements of perjury.	#TrumpPerjury #Liar		https://t.co/h677qZdIPb
@krassenstein @NRA Why is Donald Trump Sr not on your list? Just curious if your opinion is that he should NOT be on the list, or if he is an assumed prison rat?
@NathanHRubin Such a good point &amp; while I haven‚Äôt thought of it quite like that, I have noticed the growth &amp; ACCEPTANCE of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù socialist movement (a la Ocasio-Cortez). I‚Äôm almost 45 &amp; ur exactly right. When I think ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù I have pictures of USSR, Reagan, &amp; yellow sickles in my head.

@SaysHummingbird Sadly - and damn me if it sounds like I‚Äôm defending ANYONE in this admin - this term has been used for as long as I can remember, &amp; I‚Äôm approaching 50.
@TomSisk72 @thedailybeast Been there, done that. https://t.co/U5Hw9JBfgj
@Svanzante @GOP @MarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @Svanzante you‚Äôll have to excuse the  @GOP as it died a while back only to arise as the propaganda arm for the @POTUS proletariat. It used to be party of policy &amp; conservative $$  oversight- a party I once believed in. Now, the members are cowardly, sheepish, &amp; have no future.
@MeccaStarr7 What‚Äôs there to offer thoughts on? Unless a person ‚Äúreceives permission‚Äù for sexual contact, it‚Äôs wrong.  Period...end of story.  This is the type of defense we have invited, by having a depraved sexual egoist in the White House.
@realDonaldTrump It is crazy how obsessed you are with Hillary. I‚Äôm convinced you‚Äôre secretly in love with her, OR you‚Äôre just flat out mad that she is liked far more than you. I hate you, and cannot wait for you to be gone from them world. It will be a better place.
@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Ahh...such hypocrisy from the ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù right. The hypocrisy of your time is why institutionalized religion is going away.
@PrincessBravato Got it. Not sure how this escaped me. Thanks.
@PrincessBravato Where are you getting this info?
@GOP @sendavidperdue Don‚Äôt think we don‚Äôt see it.
@GOP @sendavidperdue Despicable. You blocked the last the SCOTUS, who had bipartisan clearance.  This the is epitome of hypocrisy.
@GOP @sendavidperdue The @gop fucking sucks. Making this a big deal, when you did the same thing to the last SCOTUS nominee. FUCK YOU!!!!!!!
@politvidchannel I haven‚Äôt read any details on this, but how this doesn‚Äôt pass is beyond me. We should have had this legislation immediately after ‚Äò16 election. Why the hell is this NOT near a top priority? Sadly, Trump will see it as attack, Schumer will bend over (w/ no Crisco), and it‚Äôll die.
@TheSun In the U. S., boy‚Äôs have been getting them for 10 to 15 years. Nothing news to us. But it‚Äôs a good thing if more boys receive it, so, carry on.
@CatsofVelvet After one heck of a day it is with delight &amp; a hearty chortle -upon reading such incredulously blithe incoherence- that I lay here rejuvenated! I needed a good laugh, &amp; it‚Äôs always ducky to be reminded how appreciable Darwinism is.  Ahhhhhh... good times.
@GOP Dangerous &amp; reckless? Ooohhhhhh...you mean, like Trump embracing Putin? Not Russia, but Putin. Please someone...read this &amp; let it sink in:		Trump RECKLESSLY set up a 1 on 1 w/ one of the most DANGEROUS men on the planet, then lied about it to (likely) protect his own interests.
@Popeofscience97 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Two. I left the party in May, after being a lifelong party member.  My beliefs won‚Äôt change, just where I put my support, and support this sham of a presidency is not what being conservative means. Let people do what they want.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Um...does the treasonweasel realize that all those he insults, trashes, and speaks down to - including those on the left - are part of that collective ‚Äúpeople‚Äù he‚Äôs supposedly talking about? Not just those who deify him?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Hardly. He stands with whatever Putin tells him to stand for.
@marcorubio I am also reminded of what you said about Trump in 2015-16, but as you know, that didn‚Äôt last long. Why should we take this seriously?
@AtheistRepublic Denial. My weapon of choice.
@RealOmarNavarro Omar...if you REALLY want intelligent folks to take you seriously, you might wanna brush up on elementary grammar. Then again, if you‚Äôre going for Trump cult troglodytes, then carry on.
@Frankie_da_pug @RealOmarNavarro Far from true. Faaaaaaar from true. A small handful of Trump-cult troglodytes are sheepishly following a man who thrives on division &amp; anger. Omar‚Äôs own campaign admitted he only uses Twitter to attack...no agenda or policies.  He‚Äôll be back in his hypocritical sadness very soon.
@MichaelAvenatti I don‚Äôt care what anybody says, do your thing man. Few others will stray as far as you in rhetoric &amp; fire.  You don‚Äôt answer to anybody, nor do you need approval. Please keep pressuring until Trump cracks, or digs his own hole so far that he upends in Russia, where he belongs.
@infowars Oh good lord! Best comedy channel on the inter webs. Ahhhhh....phew...thanks for the laugh.
@BobCanne @tb_terry @FelineFancy @MEMLiberal @cgagin Well, while you have few options, not all Americans feel this way. In fact I bet even most Trump voters don‚Äôt feel this way, only that they follow him blindly - Trump tends to attract less educated folks. We‚Äôre still friends...Trump is just a jackass treasonweasel. Sorry.
@cgagin Good for you.  I left the @gop 10 weeks ago for similar reasons but the Russia missteps were the straw...camel. This has nothing to do with YOUR views but the views of a man carving the party in his image, not working to bring Americans together especially when he prefers Russia.
@ChurchofSatan Opposed to Amazon Prime Day being dead?
@CynthiaVA757 @Camilla317 Thank you Cynthia, for trying but it doesn‚Äôt help.  I know the difference both etymologically &amp; ethnogeographically.  I‚Äôm asking how a non-POC should refer to POC, as it seems we get chastised no matter which descriptor we use.  While not the point of Camilla‚Äôs thread it came up
@PainPlayhouse @NatPainReport Sad, that this mirrors by own personal story, almost to the letter. 5 spinal reconstructions, ankylosing spondylitis, and the excruciating pain. All my docs are bringing meds down 50% and nobody will help, or listen to me. Suicide is becoming a CPP reality.
@CholaChihuahua @PrincessBravato Why, an orange mullet of course.
@Camilla317 This man turned &amp; said ‚ÄúBitch, I‚Äôm African American, I ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù  This is the only ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù part of your video. Nowadays, it‚Äôs hard to know anymore. How do we respectfully refer to people of color? If black IS CONSIDERED bad to some, but not to you, what do we say? Thanks.
@Camilla317 Third...cell phones are the new tattle tales, and NOBODY can hide from them. Props for keeping cool and getting it on video. 		BUT...I need to ask a serious question. Last week I saw a black man curse out an older white woman who (respectfully) referred to him as ‚Äúblack.‚Äù
@Camilla317 Hi Camilla. First, this is abhorrent behavior by manager. Had you been white, I doubt the authorities would have been called OR that this tool would have been shaking this way. Second, good for you for not acting out/cursing/other poor behavior- it would distill your message.
@CBSNews Yes, this is despicable. I‚Äôve tweeted it out several times, as it‚Äôs gotten nowhere near the press it needs. @PaulMosleyAZ is a lying, cheating, lawless hypocrite of a Christian. He needs to resign, &amp; I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúbandwagon resigner‚Äù guy. Lawmakers must be held to highest standards.
@Newsweek ...and all those etiquette questions are answered on the Royal webpage if anyone is curious.
@Newsweek No he didn‚Äôt. Foreigners, either common or dignitary have no required etiquette when meeting the Queen. There r tons of recommended practices &amp; nearly EVERY person in the free world follows them, but no, he didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs just an oblivious tool w/ narcissistic egoism up to his ears
@ThomasKlineMD @PainPtFightBack They won‚Äôt care. Our plight is almost useless. I‚Äôm a CPP after 5 spinal reconstructions &amp; a severed lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, with obvious need for strong medications.  Yet, the process of ‚Äúweening‚Äù has begun at nearly every Pain Mgmt clinic in the land. Only MD‚Äôs can fix!
@SparkPoster @livefree523 Almost? 		That, and I believe they were overheard saying to Trump, ‚ÄúWe could stand in the middle of Mt Zion and shoot bombs at people, and wouldn‚Äôt lose any of your voters.‚Äù
@NaderDIssa @RedTRaccoon Cell phones are the new tattle-tales, and NOBODY can hide. Not even the cops. Sorry you had to deal with that man. Hope you press charges.
@LATlands @lrozen Not a shocker at all. With the number of millennials here, a majority of which are new blood progressive, the CA Dem party has to get younger.  It‚Äôs also likely a bit of a long play, as many in the party see him as someone to reckon with in the future &amp; this is a nat‚Äôl spotlight.
@TheChickLivesOn @realDonaldTrump While I agree, I got thrown in Twitter jail for saying THE EXACT SAME THING, but my ending said ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be upset.‚Äù Twitter told me I was advocating violence. And, like, HOW many people has that orange turd spoken violence toward? Pitiful.
@Itsonlyreal I agree with some of the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù issue, but to say the Cruz‚Äôs would have been arrested is also blind. Not all cops are bad folks, and many actually take the time to investigate what occurs. Be cautious with adding this extra layer, unless you truly have ZERO trust in police.
@Itsonlyreal @rebeinstein Weaponize it? Maybe. But with video of these incidents becoming more prevalent, it‚Äôs the best approach the ‚Äúcommon man‚Äù has of de-weaponizing these horrible, useless excuses for human beings. No other animal feels this kind of hate...only humans. Let that rattle around for a sec.
@peterdaou Hillary running again would be the biggest mistake the Democratic Party could make. Not just because the party has moved past her, but she‚Äôs got too much of her own ‚Äúpolitical baggage‚Äù to make anything happen. While I‚Äôm not a Trump fan (AT ALL), Hillary‚Äôs time is past.
@PressSec @CNN @POTUS Holy moses on a popsicle stick. If this example is how u measure disrespect, then why can‚Äôt you have an honest dialog with the American public when it comes to Trump disrespecting ANY &amp; EVERY person he feels threatened by? Until u make the playing field even then it‚Äôs all lies.
@BradMossEsq THIS is what stains her career record? Are you kidding? This is barely a stain on the stain on the stain of her career. There‚Äôs a mile-long list of more malevolent items she‚Äôs cast from the sewer under her nose. She should be ostracized by members of the media for she is...a liar
@ABC Thank you for posting something feel-good! With Trump destroying basically everything he touches, we tend to forget how beautiful life truly is, and to laugh whenever possible. We could use more of this in life. 		Now, back to seeing ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù everywhere.
@NelsonRussellM @PaulMosleyAZ UR the epitome of a Christian hypocrite. Hiding behind your god only to use the earth, its people, &amp; your position to enhance ur lawless life. UR blatant contempt &amp; disrespect for rule of law is abhorrent &amp; demands U RESIGN!	Breaking laws only to laugh at them is sad.	#PaulMosley
@PaulMosleyAZ FYI, my best friend in college was hit &amp; killed by a speeding car. The driver‚Äôs excuse? He was trying to get home for a show.		Leaders must be held to high standards, &amp; you demonstrated your contempt, disgust, &amp; careless attitude toward the law.		PLEASE RESIGN!		#PaulMosley #Lies
@PaulMosleyAZ please delete this from your page, as their endorsement has been pulled following your criminal issues, blatant lies, &amp; complete disrespect for the law.

@PaulMosleyAZ Not any more. PLEASE DELETE THIS TWEET! You no longer hold this endorsement. After you delete this, please resign, as your contempt &amp; disrespect for the law should disqualify you from serving. 	#PaulMosley #Resign #Liar #Hypocrite #FakeChristian #SwampRat #GOP		@GOP really sucks!
@PaulMosleyAZ While this is an admirable cause, it‚Äôs hard to take anything you say seriously.

@MikeLevinCA Not until the next Dem is in the WH.
@joshtpm @chrislhayes That‚Äôs not news man. Trump took the first quarter of his presidency for personal attacks, w/out much in the way of racist comments. Right about Charlottesville, the parroting began. The NEWS should be that  his use of such language is steadily increasing. THAT‚ÄôS what needs saying
@JoyAnnReid Lots? Looks like a normal day in Trumpville to me. Maybe add a hooker or two if time permits. Oh...please and thank you.
@ChronicallyKoa Yes. Let‚Äôs make a point to connect. I‚Äôll message you next week. Nights are tough for me too.  Definitely be interested in sharing thoughts and ideas. Cheers!	Mike
Thank u for retweeting this message about @PaulMosleyAZ. He must resign immediately after showing no respect for rule of law, admitted to consistently breaking laws, &amp; uses religion as a crutch. 	#paulmosley #paulmosleyresign #swamprat #liar #draintheswamp #nointegrity #gop @gop
@ChronicallyKoa Yes yes, and yes. I‚Äôm here, rowing right to you, &amp; there are countless others WITH US.  You are not alone, no matter how often you feel it. If ever needed, my mail box is always open for ideas, thoughts, tirades, or if you just have questions or need to vent. WE MUST BE RESOLUTE
@AZNeighborAZ They are constructing a narrative to fit the story opposed to root cause analysis to better combat ACTUAL issues, like inflow of illegal fentanyl or other opioids into the country or the backyard labs in the US that produce something they CALL fentanyl but is far from. Backwards.
@ChronicallyKoa I wish you luck with your process. The emotional toll this is taking on me almost outweighs the pain I live in, and it breaks my heart that others undergo the same meaningless stigma &amp; trials that I do. The gvt needs to stay away from prescription writing. PERIOD.
@ChronicallyKoa THAT is biggest problem. The access, or lack thereof, to medication for patients who have been told for years that these are the meds they need. I‚Äôm looking in to a malpractice suit against my PM doc. By telling me I must reduce RX they admit over-prescribing for the last decade.
@ChronicallyKoa Few actually care about CPP‚Äôs &amp; the need for access to meds WITHOUT being treated like ‚Äúany other patient.‚Äù The approach being taken is BACKWARD! They are not attacking the problem, only one branch that is far up the tree. CPP suicide will increase, as will overdoses. I‚Äôm broken.
This is not getting enough coverage! While not as bad as Trump, @PaulMosleyAZ lack of respect for the law &amp; brazen lies are NOT qualities conducive of a member of Congress. We must hold him accountable now!	#paulmosleyresign #PaulMosley 		*PLEASE RETWEET*		https://t.co/P8CviCK4Wk
@J_GallagherAD3 That‚Äôs pretty smug. In the spirit of holding our representatives to high standards, your statement is divisive  &amp; lacks empathy for constituents who might feel differently. Your ideologies are yours, but u represent US. You should work to bring us together, not separating us.
@RealJamesWoods Today? Ohhh....I‚Äôm no liberal but it is rather amusing to watch you fumble around on Twitter whining as much as the most bleeding heart never-Trumper. How the mighty have fallen. I have no issue with ur ideologies...but come on man. Nut up, and shut up. It only makes u look weak.
@ChronicallyKoa It is so sad, yet I find myself now battling pain docs EVERY MONTH to get the same prescriptions I‚Äôve gotten for 10+ years. Only now, w/ government regs, those same doses are deemed too high. CPP‚Äôs are suffering yet overdoses continue. This is backwards &amp; must stop.	#OpioidCrisis
@HarleyRouda @DanaRohrabacher @FBI Yes... @DanaRohrabacher as a constituent of yours, I would like an HONEST response about this. Forget Trump, forget politics or optics...do what is right, which is tell the truth - something you‚Äôve strayed from in recent years. We are watching you. Don‚Äôt be like #PaulMosley. Sad.
@RadioFreeTom @DavidWohl how did you feel about the Russians during the last administration? Shall I retweet some of those references, or would you like to? If you want to support Trump that is your choice, but don‚Äôt do it blindly. How can you think that letting Russia off the hook is good?
@RadioFreeTom This is beyond madness. I‚Äôm not a Dem or Rep, so don‚Äôt feel indemnified by a specific political ideology, but less than 24 months ago the Rep party had NO trust or love loss w/ Russia. Then, they attack our elections. Trump continues denying, and all of a sudden Reps love Russia?
@PaulMosleyAZ I DISRESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU RESIGN, as your brazen disrespect &amp; dishonesty illustrates that you operate above any Constitutional &amp; legal morality. You have embarrassed yourself, yet use your god as a crutch &amp; rationale. 	#PaulMosley must be held accountable. Swamp rat!!!
@icluroe @PaulMosleyAZ Thank you Ian! Please plaster the #paulmosley hash, &amp; get this hypocritical swamp rat out of Congress. MoC must be held to a high standard &amp; #paulmosley has demonstrated he has no appreciation or respect for the law. Imagine what else he has ‚Äúgotten away with?‚Äù	#liar #PaulMosley
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump YES! When did Russians &amp; N Koreans become our bedfellows whilst the UK, Germany, Canada, Mexico, &amp; Japan are being cast aside as villainous capitalists for their own causes? And even worse...when did the @GOP become Russia-centric, amidst the most brazen attack since Cold War?
@BobbyBrimstone @PaulMosleyAZ Exactly. Above the law, in his own head, LYING ABOUT IT then laughing it off. The officer did no favors by clocking him at 97 MILES PER HOUR, and letting him off w/out checking the laws. Abhorrent, and he should resign. We MUST hold Congress members to a higher standard. Pls rtwt
Despicable. AZ lawmaker (in Havasu) must be voted out! Conservative hypocrite who lies, and hides behind religion. PLEASE READ &amp; RETWEET @PaulMosleyAZ is the SWAMP &amp; a hypocritical troglodyte via the cult of Trump. He must go. 		#PaulMosley #Liar #GOPlies		https://t.co/smir2iec4w
@PaulMosleyAZ https://t.co/smir2iec4w		Gives the statements from two organizations who pulled endorsements.
@icluroe @PaulMosleyAZ No. They‚Äôve pulled the endorsement. He is despicable. These hypocritical ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù hide behind religion, only to use and abuse their positions. 		I‚Äôm going to do whatever I can to screw your run in November. You are a massive piece of shit, Mosley, &amp; should delete endrsmnt
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More Trump propaganda from what used to be a relative source of info, party updates, floor discussions, bill updates, etc. Now it is almost all Trump all the time. Sad.
@billmaher @LCunninghamII2 @GOP @PressSec @FoxNews But what scares me more than Trump himself is that nearly half the voting public supports him. He won, when we all knew exactly what he was &amp; is. Now, the sycophants in Congress fear for their political (and actual) lives if they cross him. THAT is the saddest thing. Lee Harvey?
@DKFMTracks This was one of my favorite records of 2013, and STILL finds itself in regular rotation. Not a single bad song on either side. Hell...not even a ‚Äúso-so‚Äù song...as every song is as good as the one before and the one after. And on one of the best shoegaze labels out there.
@Emeraldluxury @LindseyGrahamSC @TheJusticeDept Not that it changes your point, but Lindsey Graham is not up for re-election in November. Just sayin.
@AtheistRepublic ‚ÄúYou will accept me as your clean-cut Jesus...your lord and shaver.‚Äù - Jesus
@johnkrasinski my apologies if this is common knowledge, but several of The Office episodes show Jim‚Äôs character dancing. I have sworn to my son that you were intentionally doing the ‚ÄúSchroeder‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know name) dance from the Peanuts specials we watched as kids.  Any insight?
@RealOmarNavarro @Twitter Seriously? Going full blown Trump &amp; fabricating a complete set of statements in hopes of imposing harm to many of your constituents. In other words, MAKING UP A LIE WITH ZERO INTENT OF PROVIDING EVIDENCE to the fact. This is the coward‚Äôs way of life. Twitter is not conspiring
@jencraneNYC This was absolutely incredible to watch. Once again, Congress looks the part of a monkey.
@RepThomasMassie Well...Keep tweeting.  Your constituents are speaking, and we are done with you. Stand up to Trump Or we‚Äôll vote you out.
@RealDonaldTrFan Good lord you‚Äôre an idiot. Absolutely crazy that you are the president.
@Stonekettle Actually, Twitter is nothing, if not a construct based on your choosing,  so, technically, it‚Äôs your fault. Don‚Äôt blame a non-sentient platform for your personal choices. Just sayin. Have a nice day.
@ModernCSA @TitusNation Are you fucking serious? The @potus illustrates harsher hatred toward numerous private citizens on a daily basis, and you call THIS out? You‚Äôre a hypocritical  sycophant caught in the haze of a cult milieu.  And I‚Äôm not a liberal, so you can‚Äôt pull that with me. #SadAssholesUnite
@RepDeSantis Just...	Like...	Trump.
@mflynnJR @LouiseMensch @SethAbramson Nut job? [cough]...pot...[cough]...kettle...		Asshole.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls More Trump propaganda. This acct used to post meaningful info: floor debates, member announcements, policy info. Now it‚Äôs 90% Trump propaganda to his proletariat. Sad.
@LCHWS @kato3000 @IndependentWeen @remotecontroll @dale_callihan @FusseGal @MsAnthropist999 Lydia, I‚Äôm curious, &amp; I ask this of all on the thread...honest question: do you want Congressional representatives who treat ppl the same way Trump treats ppl? Is that what ‚Äúfighting‚Äù means now? I want the fight, as I am socially liberal but $ conservative, but demand decorum.
@marcorubio Toxic leadership...from the Army Field Manual. @realDonaldTrump is leading the charge of incivility &amp; hate. At one time, you said the same thing, as you knew it to be true. Since then, you chose to put party over country, and fall in line with the most toxic admin in history. Sad https://t.co/0ocEUL6Rdm
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Holy moses on a popsicle stick. Every freakin day...85% or more of the tweets from @gop are pure Trump propaganda delivering to his proletariat. What happened? You used to tweet policy, floor bills, member interests...now it‚Äôs nearly ALL propaganda, ALL the time! Stop!!!
@AtheistRepublic Though shalt not blaspheme the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Or, thou shall. Either way.  I don‚Äôt really care that much. Yup...either way.
@infowars Dude...it ain‚Äôt just the left. Both parties are out of control right now and show no signs of slowing.  Both parties‚Äô leadership is as lame as lame can be, and nearly the entire Comgressional contingent, their aides, &amp; pundits need to be put in a bus &amp; rolled off a cliff.
@PrisonPlanet @infowars I think if u met 100 ‚Äúleftists‚Äù in a room but didn‚Äôt know their political officiation, &amp; politics was a forbidden topic, u might find that we have more in common than you think. I am socially liberal, yet love this country, its customs, &amp; what we‚Äôve accomplished w/ all my heart.
@TeaPainUSA I agree, although I truly don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll be impeached. The Dems can‚Äôt get their act together enough to pull this off, and the fact that almost half the nation seemingly cares not that Trump is ruining this country, as the world laughs at us. Rather, they love. Gonna be hard.
@joshscampbell @lrozen A lesson soooo many could use right about now.
@FOXSports @FOXSoccer The only thing I‚Äôll ever watch on Fox.  Well, sports in general. Can‚Äôt wait!
@MichaelAvenatti I support what you‚Äôre currently doing, Michael, but the last thing this country needs is the type of ‚Äúno holds barred‚Äù election you refer to. Trump has destroyed civility &amp; the office he serves, but adding more to that equation will only separate the nation more. We need decorum.
@MaxBoot @PostOpinions Yup. I left the party over this bullshit. Then again, because socially I am very liberal (ie do whatever you want...just don‚Äôt force it on me) I suppose I‚Äôm already half Dem. I still love this country, I just detest the (very toxic) leadership &amp; how they destroy trust &amp; integrity
@SenShelby Annnnd...we celebrate by cozying up to an enemy of our nation, who influenced &amp; attacked our voting system, &amp; continually launches cyberattacks? How is it that not too long ago, you SCREAMED about how tough we needed to be in Russia? Maybe YOU‚ÄôRE one who Russia has the goods on
@JerryMoran Annnnd...we celebrate by cozying up to an enemy of our nation, who influenced &amp; attacked our voting system, &amp; continually launches cyberattacks?

@DeanObeidallah Of course. ‚ÄòCause, yeh know...when an enemy of our nation continually launches cyberattacks &amp; successfully ‚Äúattacks‚Äù millions to swing an election, we should attempt to have a better relationship &amp; bend a knee to their needs; we should work to give them more. NOT SANCTIONS.	Duh.
@HobackSara @gofundme Congrats on reaching your goal. There are still some (many) truly good folks out there. I wish you health and renewed happiness in your journey.
@HobackSara @MichaelAvenatti Well said Sara. Well said.
@themichaelnero Spoken like a true Satanist.
@Kemical703 @DonaldJTrumpJr @kimguilfoyle @realDonaldTrump I love you @Kemical703
@DonaldJTrumpJr @kimguilfoyle @realDonaldTrump No...your family‚Äôs narcissistic egoism has driven a deep wedge into the public. How can that be anything but devastatingly BAD? Regardless of whether policies are good or bad, the divisive nature of this toxic leadership is killing what semblance of unity we had. Fuck the Trumps!
@DogginTrump And if you didn‚Äôt speak up, then you‚Äôre part of the problem.
@thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump What in the holy fuck are you talking about? You‚Äôbe either just committed the BEST troll in recent history, or you‚Äôre incredibly stupid.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More Trump propaganda. This acct used to post meaningful insight on policy, practice, and GOP goings-ons.  Now it‚Äôs nothing more than the Trump propaganda machine for his proletariat. Sad. Very sad.
@realDonaldTrump Just like you did yesterday when you stated the ‚Äúsome people think Maxine Waters is the most corrupt person in DC.‚Äù  		It is my opinion that this country will be better off when you are dead. Without advocating harm, I definitely wish you were dead.
@realDonaldTrump Who says she is one of the most corrupt? I don‚Äôt like her antics, but WHO says this? It sounds more like Trump prognostication rather than fact. You‚Äôre a despicable human, and I am excited for the day that you are no longer on this earth. My opinion only, not advocating harm.
@Educate_Explore Mine is going crazy! Corn is already taller than me! https://t.co/cyyaQy2OQc
@BRFS8 Great acct. Loads of tips, and while some are common ones they serve as good reminders. Cheers.
@ReaganBattalion You obviously haven‚Äôt read any conservative websites‚Äô comment sections then ;)
@tedlieu @EPAScottPruitt @FBI @TheJusticeDept The DOJ would never press charges against him. NEVER.

@windyday2311 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA They‚Äôve changed in the last 5-6 years. They once were a bastion of Constitutional protections under 2A, with no exclusions. Now, they are political machine. Non-profits, under their specific filing status cannot claim tax exempt. It‚Äôs already in the courts. So...they WERE good.

@BillPalmer @LCunninghamII2 Everything you put out these days is wrong.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Wtf!!!! Stop posting ONLY Trump propaganda. Go back to policy posts, party info etc. 9 out of 10 tweets are about Trump. It is pure propaganda in the way to his brain dead proletariat. Sickening.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More @realDonaldTrump propaganda. This acct used to post info on bills, party priorities, member projects, and more. Now it is nothing more than 90% Trump pro panda, being passed to his brain dead proletariat.  Sickening.

@krassenstein @CollinJRae Are you kidding? The @gop has become nothing more than the propaganda arm for the Trump proletariat. They will not release anything that doesn‚Äôt fit their narrative of the non-existent ‚ÄúDeep State.‚Äù Look at the daily tweets from @gop...no policy, no info, just Trump propaganda.
@dsayed1 @PainNewsNetwork @CDCDirector But because a Twitter doc says it‚Äôs a good thing, without reading my case, it must be right. 		Be careful. People actually read your comments. Not all of them are intelligent enough to know that one size does not always fit. Be responsible, and remember 	DO NO HARM.
@dsayed1 @PainNewsNetwork @CDCDirector This doesn‚Äôt even discuss the 2+ years of neuropsych therapy &amp; countless rounds of multi-disciplinary functional &amp; pain control analysis &amp; restoration. Every doc in both Stanford &amp; Lima Linda programs (over 30, since I present before a board of PAIN MGMT &amp; Neuros) agree w/ meds.
@dsayed1 @PainNewsNetwork @CDCDirector I‚Äôve gone through spinal stim trials, upper and mid neuromod, over 20 nerve blocks, upper motor neur therapies, discographies (3),  maxed out non-opiates including both gabapentin and Lyrica ABOVE max dose, 3 different Standford conducted spinal pain group trials, and many more.
@dsayed1 @PainNewsNetwork @CDCDirector Then there are those of us w/ such complex issues who have tried ALL other options. Just because you are an MD doesn‚Äôt mean you know what is proper/right for my issues. 5 spinal reconstructions, w/ severed lat fem cutan nerve &amp; fully fused from T10-S1 after trauma &amp; ankylosingsp.
How can ‚Äúone size fit all‚Äù when it comes to pain? This is the epitome of irony, as pain is by definition, subjective. Every single CPP is different, &amp; placing an arbitrary limit will not stop deaths. Deaths are not caused by legally obtained RX. THIS WILL AFFECT SOMEONE U LOVE. https://t.co/OfU8PbtvKS
@RWPUSA Sir, I‚Äôm a fan of yours, but how does the Constitution come in to play here...without proof? This is a serious question for you. I despise Trump, but what you‚Äôre suggesting doesn‚Äôt sound a) like a sound legal argument for investigation, and b) sounds like pure speculation.
@Rleuthold2 Oh it does. I blinked, and bam...40‚Äôs were half over.
@marcorubio Hypocrisy.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Trump propaganda. Please go back to posting meaningful info. Not pure Trump propaganda.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More propaganda. This acct used to post meaningful info - policy updates, support reminders, etc.  Now it‚Äôs Trump Trump Trump. Pure propaganda. Sad.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More Trump propaganda. This acct used to post important updates on policy, Congressional initiatives, &amp; member support. Now it‚Äôs TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP. Pure state propaganda.  Like you‚Äôre still trying to convince us about something. Sad.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump More Trump propaganda. This account used to Tweet meaningful policy &amp; activity by half of our nation‚Äôs Congress. Now it is nothing more than state propaganda &amp; whining about a narcissistic egoist of a ‚Äúpresident.‚Äù
@ManInTheHoody At this stage, I truly need it, as the constant almost-mechanized daily occurrences &amp; blunders are exasperating, yet sadly demand that much attention. It is a good reminder, however, as it‚Äôs simply not healthy to see so much negativity day in and day out w/ #treasonweasel #Trump.
@TitusNation @danaloesch She blocked me for something far less.
@AndyFilm1 @dale_callihan @MsAnthropist999 If you‚Äôre calling me a racist, please do it directly so that I don‚Äôt misinterpret your words, and can adequately prepare to flame you.
ICE whistleblower discusses why he resigned- BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMIN TOLD HIM TO LIE re: factual statistics. I get that PR folks ‚Äúspin‚Äù things, but @potus &amp; @jeffsessions DIRECTED HIM TO LIE! Why don‚Äôt Republicans care about truth &amp; integrity?		#GOPLies 		https://t.co/5tlDBwm1VW
@tedlieu @EPAScottPruitt As always - though I have yet to get a response from you - what are you DOING about it? Rather than tweeting this whiny Trumpian dribble, tell us what you are actively doing to get this man out of his position. 		Why is it that you don‚Äôt answer these questions when asked?
@realDonaldTrump The only thing disgraceful here is you, and your total lack of respect for, well... everyone &amp; everything you touch. It‚Äôs like, you‚Äôre the King Midas of asshattery &amp; dishonesty. 	#treasonweasel
@Stiffs74 @wahida_alom @YourAnonCentral Sad that someone makes a public post, then another person, who takes much away from the post, offers a different take. A yet-then THIRD PERSON (this would be you if ur following) makes a childish response in protest. The dialogue was fine. Tense but fine. Then you whined. Sad.

@ReaganBattalion Neither party will ever be ‚Äúhappy‚Äù w/ the opposing party president, but neither of the two you mentioned would have purposely driven a spike in to the integrity, global trust, or world leadership the way @realDonaldTrump has. He has ruined the perception of America.
@glitteringaaand @RollingHillPark @dale_callihan @MsAnthropist999 Absolutely! Especially since it‚Äôs apparently gotten your goat.
I had totally forgotten this. Sadly, I‚Äôm not surprised to see either political party display such hypocrisy. In this case, it just happens to be Republicans. Don‚Äôt like that the Red Hen expelled @PressSec? Well, what‚Äôs good for the goose...	@gop #Republicans #Hypocrisy #BlueWave https://t.co/euRAQbrI9K
@glitteringaaand @RollingHillPark @dale_callihan @MsAnthropist999 Why would u make the assumption that I wish to push my ideology on you, or have it as the majority? Your assumptions are childish &amp; naive, and offer no constructive value to this thread. If you disagree, then be an adult &amp; use your words. Though, I won‚Äôt assume ur capable of that
This not good. More usurpation of patient rights by someone other than a pharmacologist or pharmacist. What we are witnessing is the evolution of the U.S. government in to an authoritarian regime. **CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS TAKE NOTE** https://t.co/eVfRlBoBuY
@KatrinaPierson And just so you know the source, this is straight out of my Army manual.
@KatrinaPierson America has been great since its early days. Our greatness, however, is being chipped away due to an authoritarian President who lies, bullies, cheats, derided, and feeds on separatism. He has never stood for unity, rather only those who follow him. THAT is toxic leadership. https://t.co/1XJq1dCCT1
@waltshaub Um, yuh think? Sadly, marches &amp; protests happen so frequently that they‚Äôre diluting  the message. I‚Äôm not advocating NOT walking, but the time has come for greater acts of protest. I don‚Äôt know what they are, but I no longer trust the gvt to do the right thing. I used to...sad.
This should also be a rallying pt &amp; demands LASER focus from @TheDemocrats. They must be united so that our next Supreme Court justice is the right person. Use @SenateMajLdr word‚Äôs against him re: WHEN a nomination should be made. DO NOT BACK DOWN! This is a fight for our lives. https://t.co/WCK66QFXdE
@Ocasio2018 @SenSanders Congrats on a great campaign. Now do something real, for all of us.  Don‚Äôt fall prey to the Trump machine &amp; become an uncivil troglodyte like so many in Congress.  BUT, don‚Äôt be walked over; have a spine; fight an honorable, but bloody fight. We must embrace unity not separatism.
@foxandfriends @GOP @KellyannePolls What in the holy fuck? Why is everything about Trump? Never before has there been such great focus on the PERSON, w/ so much propaganda. He‚Äôs president already.  Focus on THE FUCKING ISSUES!
@DonaldJTrumpJr What in the holy fuck are you talking about?
Just a reminder. Please retweet. https://t.co/r2T1FLbxSS
@wahida_alom @YourAnonCentral You put this out there, &amp; because someone suggests, in this sad situation, that you could have done more, you exclaim that because I am not a woman I don‚Äôt understand. Don‚Äôt pretend to know who I am &amp; what I‚Äôve witnessed as a lifelong advocate for batteres, abused women. Do more!
@wahida_alom @YourAnonCentral I‚Äôve watched my mother put herself in dozens of positions that advocate &amp; stop this kind of treatment, if by no other way than yelling for help, or screaming. She has saved countless other women from ‚Äúsomething bad‚Äù by AFFECTING CHANGE BY SIMPLY BEING A VOICE!
@wahida_alom @YourAnonCentral And while I absolutely empathize w/ the sadness in this story, it is up to us to affect change, whether man or woman. There are always options to help, which don‚Äôt involve physical altercation, yet u criticize me for not understanding?
@wahida_alom @YourAnonCentral You ALL miss the point, &amp; you‚Äôre acting like victims. I grew up in a battered women‚Äôs shelter, watching bloody, beaten women come through &amp; you know what most said? ‚ÄúI should have said something sooner.‚Äù Even as a woman, she could have yelled for help, screamed injustice etc.
@wahida_alom @YourAnonCentral No you didn‚Äôt. You said it yourself. YOU WATCHED, and only when it got beyond the point of no return, you ‚Äúinterjected.‚Äù If you want real change, you need to involve urself, with real issues. I got the point...maybe you missed a bigger one: that we need to HELP each other often.
@eugenegu I agree, and I‚Äôm behind you 100%. Please let me know if I can help in any way - busywork, paperwork, data entry, etc.
@alexvet2017 Thank you!
@wahida_alom @YourAnonCentral Well, unless I missed it, you didn‚Äôt intervene when the 3 harassed the woman.  Waiting until it‚Äôs too late to speak up can lead to situations getting out of control quickly.
@JamesKosur @_Ben_Franklin1 Yet his approval rating continues rising, albeit with a minor hiccup this week. Sad.  Very sad.
CHRONIC PAIN followers, you must read this. For the rest, please know that while I agree there is a drug overdose problem in the U.S., big pharma is corrupt. Things aren‚Äôt as bad as you‚Äôre told, at least as it pertains to legit RXers. Don‚Äôt let politic/beaurocrts set pill limits. https://t.co/PR4fhCYicz
@peterdaou Are you kidding? Maxine Waters does NOT represent the broader Dem constituency or even the body of Congress she serves. While we need folks w/ spines, we cannot stoop to Trump‚Äôs level of incivility or assault. It makes us no better &amp; will only drive a wedge further in to the US.
@RWPUSA @TinaSmithMN Pulling for you sir! I only wish I could vote for you. You are the type of person we need in Congress. Educated, but not a far left or far right association to aggregate issues.

@nsitton @Deeenst @1966Novadreamca @GOPLeader @POTUS You bastards are completely missing the crux of the epidemic. All the misinformation coming out about the opioid ep is staggering, &amp; is harming those of us with chronic conditions &amp; cancer - I am one being affected. Please do not limit meds.  Leave that decision to doctors.
@CillizzaCNN Methinks you could have found a better adjective to use in that sentence. I‚Äôm sure your followers could come up with a few.

@LilLegsCT @realDonaldTrump Actually, while New York, California, and SMALL handful of states have grown more liberal, the fact is that there are many more states that are characterized as conservative (red, for those keeping score). While I wish your statement was true, it ain‚Äôt.
@realDonaldTrump Fuck that! You‚Äôre a complete piece of shit, liar, &amp; the nation‚Äôs biggest bully, whiner, and source of division. Why would anybody be nice or offer respect to a PERSON like you, let alone as @POTUS? You are a disgrace to civility, and don‚Äôt deserve to be in office. 	#treasonweasel
@TrueFactsStated Pockets.
@TrueFactsStated I‚Äôm not an east coaster, so know very little of him. Why is this such a shocker, when public opinion of Congress so low? Gotta get these sons of bitches out, and make room for new blood, who will actually TRY to make a difference without lining their p
@dale_callihan @FusseGal @MsAnthropist999 ‚ÄúKnow‚Äù	Just giving you a hard time. It‚Äôs no worse than that treason weasel‚Äôs tweets.
@dale_callihan @FusseGal @MsAnthropist999 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Äù
@VA_GOP Really? Like when Trump attacks ALL Muslims, or when Trump says NFL players should be banned from country, or like when he, daily, tells people to boycott everything from The NY Times to any other # of companies. So...if Trump does it, it‚Äôs ok, but when a Dem does, it‚Äôs not. Sad.
@dale_callihan @MsAnthropist999 Are you kidding? She does not represent the broader values &amp; policies of the Dem party. If you want bigger divides in the nation, she will bring that. We need a speaker with a spine, but also decorum, if we want to win in the long term. Leaders of tmrw are watching &amp; learning.
@RepCarbajal @HRC By standing up to Trump!!!!  What are actually DOING other than Tweeting to help this? Until Trump is put in his place, tweets like this is nothing more than token outrage. DO SOMETHING! Not just tweet.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Once again, more propaganda from this Twitter acct. No policy tweets, informational tweets, November election tweets, congressional activity tweets, just Trump propaganda every day. It‚Äôs as if they are worried about his credibility. Hahahaha...
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More Trump propaganda from this account. Not policy, not candidate backing for November, not initiative introduction, but more propaganda about the already-President.
@counterchekist Proof please. They are not helping. That is patently false and irresponsible. They are destroying America by not checking the @potus
@marcorubio From the mouth of a ‚Äúman‚Äù who called Trump the biggest con man to con the US people.
@RealOmarNavarro @RepMaxineWaters Omg...you are such a leach.
@tsbrewers @NRA @shannonrwatts @BillyNRA Exactly! You get it! Short term gain, long term death spiral. Thanks for gettin it.
@JoeNBC Are you kidding? They‚Äôll love it. Not unlike Kelly Anne Conway, they will avoid directly answering questions, rave about yet another victory &amp; campaign promise being kept, and basically begin quoting their own ‚Äúalternate facts‚Äù in order go avoid direct confrontation.
@michaelmalice Oh phew...I thought it was a sleestak.
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Indeed. And not to be clich√© but his dog whistle ‚Äúcampaign events‚Äù and rhetoric are the rallying cries immigration hardliners and racists (not the same thing). He‚Äôs ramping up, and this is THE ONE thing the base wants ‚Äúcleaned up.‚Äù
@virtualouija Oh...you can...yoooooou can.
@ambiej @KateNocera What‚Äôs behind THAT door?	...and THAT one?	...and THAT one?		You get the idea.
@JohnJHarwood So, first off, nobody will ever be successful in prosecuting Trump for these issues. This administration would use every tool in the bag, &amp; w/ a completely orchiectomized @GOP carrying him on their shoulders, that makes for quite a hurdle. 		Second, and last, this surprises you?
@Nubia63802943 If that were truly the case, we might be able to BEGIN some forward movement. Sadly, while I know that personally, I have had several POC tell me that they don‚Äôt like ANY ‚Äúwhite ppl,‚Äù including me, due to historical atrocities. That‚Äôs not an opinion I can change, for them.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Maxine Waters is not the left. She is the alt-left. The extremes of each party have some really shitty people. We ALL need to remember that they are the fringe...the few- again, on both sides. But...you‚Äôll never take a leadership role in working to unite people. Only demonizing.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More propaganda. If it‚Äôs not Trump related, this Twitter feed barely takes notice.
@realDonaldTrump How is it even remotely possible to believe a word out of that sewer below your nose? Constant lies and disinformation for the sole purpose of furthering your ‚Äúagenda‚Äù is abhorrent and while some of your policies are good, your lack of integrity &amp; dishonesty has ruined America.
@marklevinshow Mark...you do know this was not instigated by @Sethrogen, right? Ryan and his kids approached Rogan, begging for pictures and autographs at a Republican sponsored event. How can one be a ‚Äúdrama clown‚Äù when keeping to himself? You‚Äôre a fucking idiot.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More Trump propaganda from the @gop account. This is like state supported media. You could at least pretend to have other non-Trump irons in the fire &amp; provide info that the American public can actually use, opposed to this type of garbage. I left the GOP party 2 months ago. Glad
@RyanAFournier @seanspicer Fuck both of you.
@ReaganBattalion @TheRickWilson I like @TheRickWilson but he says this, in one way or another, on a regular basis. To that end he‚Äôs either wrong, or he is correct &amp; the public does‚Äôt care. His poll numbers continue improving, meaning more &amp; more of the country tolerates/enforces all the bad coming from him. Sad
@AtheistRepublic All drugs
@PikachuSerena Pure distraction. Keep the masses zombified so they have less time to open their eyes and question him.
Folks this is @Leigh_Valentine. She is a truly despicable person, as she leans on her God, as a crutch, in order to rationalize the lies she conjures of 10 year old children having sex &amp; raping en mas≈õe. I have no words for this. Please RETWEET this. I want her outed.  @funder https://t.co/EVDxCevt4A
@Leigh_Valentine You are despicable. How can use the name of God as a crutch, in order to openly lie about immigrant children? Your God sees you, @Leigh_Valentine, and knows how your heart feels. In other words, YOU‚ÄôRE TOTALLY FUCKED! You can hide behind words on TV, but not when you‚Äôre penatent.
@senorrinhatch I find it abhorrent that you make light of this. You praised the SCOTUS decision that favored allowing restaurant owners to NOT serve gays, so why is it any different if someone chooses not to support Reoublikkkans? Oh wait...gays are a protected class...that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs different
@SaysHummingbird And yet millions of people continue supporting this administration...and approval is rising.
@GovMikeHuckabee Don‚Äôt wanna serve gay customers? No problem. You just opened the door for AN INCREDIBLE number of people to NOT serve Republikkkans.
@sullydish True, but the policy and practice portion of the administration‚Äôs enforcement is what is abhorrent. Not the stemming of immigration.
@MichaelAvenatti Release the kraken. https://t.co/DsH4dYhLpA
@Greg_NJ @LCunninghamII2 @ImJohnnyApollo @LittleFonzie920 @redsnoopystock @teamkimlisa @BitterMeg @GovMikeHuckabee I‚Äôve heard of white washed fences, but I‚Äôve never seen white washed cabinets before.
@lauferlaw Yet, his polls continue rising, and - aside from the this last misstep on immigration - Congress apparently has no desire to challenge him. We‚Äôre screwed until, at minimum, 2020.
@lady_cybele @SenTinaSmith @22aspen36 No. I don‚Äôt buy it. Too many of these folks stop short if it means they don‚Äôt get enough personal buy-in. More pressure needs to be exerted behind closed doors.
@SenTinaSmith @22aspen36 Do more than Tweet! Too many of you have become nothing more than keyboard warriors, with a BIG BARK but no bite. This demands action. You must put individual pressure on individual GOP, behind closed doors. Don‚Äôt follow the same old path. Do it differently.
@RobertsforCD2 Yes...but the current admin‚Äôs policies have already affected chronic pain and cancer patients like myself. The gvt is pressuring drs to reduce all opiate use, which basically those of us who need these meds. So yeh...are drug problem does indeed touch big pharma and medicos.
@VP @POTUS @WhiteHouse What we must never forget is you &amp; your racist, intolerant, hateful, and hypocritical Christian ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù which you use as rationalization for ur xenophobic fantasies. THESE THINGS, we will not forget. You, sir, are a fucked up, fearful man &amp; I hope you get what‚Äôs coming to you.
@thejimjams Washed up? What does that make you, for taking your time to comment on them? Irrelevant, perhaps? Either way, you lose, moron.
@TeamPelosi Yeh, but Dem‚Äôs are doing nothing but Tweeting big talk. NO MORE TALK! Find a way to make something change. Put more individual pressure on individual Repubs, behind closed doors. This is the time to dig deep in the playbook, or make something of nothing. Less words, more actions.
Well, he‚Äôs some kinda crazy, but at this stage of the game, I‚Äôll support any nut who could play a role in removing or taking Trump out. 	#Life #Liberty #Truth https://t.co/FwBH6Lnwoy
@StephGrisham45 @FLOTUS Because that wardrobe deserved it.

@realDonaldTrump Um...isn‚Äôt that the point of a Constitutional Republic? Asshole.
@IvankaTrump @POTUS Really? 	#Complicit
@SecAzar @POTUS @ACFHHS Are you serious? You‚Äôve become part of the authoritarian cult of Trump. Some of his ideas are ok, but your statement is categorically false. Like, remember when Reps stymied immigration in the last admin? Or when Dems did it to Bush? It‚Äôs systemic &amp; Trump doesn‚Äôt have the answer.
@BeNicetoVegans I bought one online from Truth Belts. The dude who runs it has a great story, as a true vegan, who got tired of not being able to find nice looking clothing that followed Animal Free designations, as well as not being associated w/ companies who also don‚Äôt. Pricey, but worth it.
THIS	IS	FUCKING	SCARY	!!!	#Trump #ChangeThePresident #Dictatorship #Resistence		Trump‚Äôs Lawyers Argue That He Cannot Be Impeached Because He Was Never Actually Elected https://t.co/whzo1YamcU
From a Republikkkan even. At least SOMEBODY tells it like it is, even if it‚Äôs just once. Thank you @justinamash for holding your values, while speaking truth with no spin or alternative rationalization. https://t.co/sN3C3eoT6R
@MauriceChammah @samueloakford At least he won‚Äôt sit on death row for decades, costing taxpayers millions. Scary, though.  As a chronic pain patient who wears a 100mcg fentanyl patch, the thought of the same drug being used for execution is...ironic.
@SteveSchmidtSES I did the exact same thing three weeks ago. The @gop has become a propaganda machine for Trump, w/ the exception of those who are retiring, who speak out. Doesn‚Äôt change my own beliefs, nor did I register as a Dem. I just can‚Äôt support a Trump party, &amp; none of Congress has balls.
@DixieCaronAdam1 @IamGilligan8 @JDugudichi I took screen shots just so I could be reminded of the existential stupidity that exists within fake Christian circles. Reposting them will brighten my days when hypocritical proselytizers need to be knocked down a wrung.
@DixieCaronAdam1 @IamGilligan8 @JDugudichi Still laughing. I wish I could give you a trophy for how incredibly well this represents hypocrisy on the religious right. Fake Christianity...the fad of the 2000‚Äôs. But you definitely take the cake with such a perfect illustration of stupidity, irony, &amp; hypocrisy.
@DixieCaronAdam1 @IamGilligan8 @JDugudichi THIS POST is exactly why so many ppl have problems w/ religious right. THIS POST completely exemplifies the hypocrisy in so-called Christians who use religion as a crutch to advance politics. True belief in something keeps u on the right. U obviously don‚Äôt have true xtian ideals
@DixieCaronAdam1 @IamGilligan8 @JDugudichi Seriously...this is likely one of the most hypocritical posts I‚Äôve read in a long time. Lip service? Trump is NOTHING like you listed in your completely blind tweet. You‚Äôre so enamored w/ Trump you‚Äôve let your decisions allow those sins to go unrepented. God sees your hypocrisy.
@DixieCaronAdam1 @IamGilligan8 @JDugudichi How can you go on a rant like this, about everything being Godly, yet support one of the most Godless, egoist humans ever on this earth? You are a true fucking hypocrite @dixiecaronadam1. A true fucking hypocrite-rationalizing hate, bullying, adultery, racism to advance politics.
@watspn1013 @IamGilligan8 @SiddonsDan @_annapaulina_ You do realize that every major station says that about Fox, right? Even their own current &amp; past employees admit. Fox lies &amp; you‚Äôre too stupid to believe truth, even when witnessing it. Seriously? You‚Äôre a fucking brainwashed sheep who rationalizes based on party. UR the problem
@freedom_moates @IamGilligan8 You, are a fucking idiot. Period.
@IamGilligan8 You don‚Äôt get to choose when to agree with your religion, only to then use it as a crutch for something else. When every major denom rebukes, you still are pissed folks are attacking it? You‚Äôre a fucking coward hypocrite &amp; blasphemer who conveniently hides behind a cross. Sinner.
@IamGilligan8 You do realize that the United Methodist Church is considering expelling Sessions for this decision...right? Every major Christian denom has rebuked this move, yet you‚Äôre pissed because ppl are bashing the politics? ‚ÄúConservative xtians‚Äù don‚Äôt get to pick when morality is owed.
@IamGilligan8 @DanaCav @RepLeeZeldin You idiot...these can‚Äôt be compared. You can‚Äôt construct the narrative to fit your own dialogue. It doesn‚Äôt work that way &amp; makes you look incredibly ignorant. The uproar isn‚Äôt over illegals, it‚Äôs about an implementation that is unnecessarily cruel when other options exist. Moron
@billm45s @RepLeeZeldin I can‚Äôt wait for you to vote him out either!
Republicans say it‚Äôs ‚Äúa policy‚Äù yet keep blaming the previous administration for said ‚Äúpolicy.‚Äù Remind me again how blame can be assigned to the prev admin when it‚Äôs a policy of the current one? Oh yeh... they‚Äôre all fucking liars. 		#gop #IllegalAliens #TrumpLies #TreasonWeasel https://t.co/vHXua0ZaFD
@RepLeeZeldin You fucking idiot. How did you get elected? Did you READ the article? It‚Äôs about standard immigration enforcement from inside the country, deporting people who lived here...not snatching children from the arms of ppl at the border. READ THE STATS you hypocrite. Apples &amp; oranges.

@mikelpumps @Imjp2PLONSKI @desert1957 @KamalaHarris Actually Mike you‚Äôre very poorly educated in the politics of your own party. The Republicans stymied Obama‚Äôs attempts at DACA &amp; N Korea, &amp; called him a loser for the same thing they praise Trump for. Close the sewer beneath your nose until you understand historical fact. Idiot.
@KamalaHarris How do you keep families together but still prosecute adults who cross the border? I don‚Äôt see how both can be done simultaneously. Trumps ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy cannot function without a) MASSIVE cost to the taxpayer, or b) stops prosecuting. We‚Äôre screwed either way.
@z10SGuy414 @dadeepspit @HMAesq @AtreiyaN7 You miss the point. It‚Äôs not immigration that has people in THIS uproar but the mistreatment of children &amp; lying to parents (&amp; public) about it. THAT is not legal...undocumented or citizen, it doesn‚Äôt matter. How in the world you segue to abortion, is moronic &amp; feeble. Damn idiot

@tedlieu @SecNielsen Dear @tedlieu. What are you ACTUALLY DOING, beyond tweeting, to combat this? NOTHING! You‚Äôve become nothing more than a whiner who talks loud and acts quietly. Tweeting against policy doesn‚Äôt make you a fighter.  DO SOMETHING. CA is getting tired of no actions.
@dennyg2 @JoeNBC Just like every member of the current administration. Idiot. At least Joe can be turned off (or never watched in my case). The current admin is using religion as a crutch. Big diff.
@FurTrump @autumnsgrammy @hlayfield @PikachuSerena Yes, but just because YOU choose to follow that philosophy doesn‚Äôt mean others must. Why do we lay expectations of our own, on others? That‚Äôs what Trump is doing.
@fudgewart @autumnsgrammy @FurTrump @hlayfield @PikachuSerena Yeh...‚Äôcause that shows them you‚Äôre a better person. They may not know you did it, you do. If the tables were turned, you‚Äôd be pissed. Beating Trump will not happen with keys and eggs. It will happen by sticking together &amp; moving forward. All you‚Äôre doing is moving backward.
@doc_no75 @autumnsgrammy @FurTrump @hlayfield @PikachuSerena Well, there are apparently a whole lot of Mexicans who think he‚Äôs great, so there‚Äôs obviously an ethnic disconnect with Trump hating. For me? No disconnect...and I‚Äôm not even Mexican ;)
@autumnsgrammy @FurTrump @hlayfield @PikachuSerena Yes...because THAT proves you‚Äôre a better person.  Right?
@PikachuSerena No, not harsh, but accomplishes nothing more than confirming what they think they know. Well...that, and it feels damn good.
@Cabelas Called your office today to inform them I will no longer be supporting your stores or brand nor will my family (18 ppl). You tied your horse to a broke-down wagon &amp; the only way for him/her to stay healthy is to unhitch. In this case, that‚Äôs @IngrahamAngle. 	#sociallyconscious

@KatrinaPierson Are you fucking kidding me? You work for the biggest swamp rat out there. You are a true whore of the earth without a soul. It‚Äôs astonishing that people are so blind.  You‚Äôre a cunt of a hypocrite and have blood on your hands with this administration.
@ledermanu @AltUSPressSec @marcorubio @SenateDems What in holy hell does this mean? You need to educate yourself Uri, as your response is almost unintelligible. Being as dumb as a bag of hammers is not a good look.
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs truly embarrassing how many grammatical &amp; spelling errors your tweets contain.
@JesseRodriguez What a douchebag - if true. He‚Äôs remained silent silENT SILENT, until public outcry, which threatens midterms. Pure optics...no real substance. The @gop has lost its way, with no central message or leadership. The left is just as bad. Come on people...get something done.

@TheRealJohnHCox What I appreciate is that you‚Äôre not following Trump‚Äôs lead &amp; filling your Twitter feed w/ attacks &amp; insults.  You talk about issues.

@AtheistRepublic What‚Äôs to think about? It‚Äôs rubbish. All morality is subject to skepticism, as most cases of ‚Äúmoral turpitude‚Äù are dictated by stigmatized judgement from people who are typically the ones defining said morality.  In other words, a pejorative is only so when someone says it is.
@OrinKerr @JusticeWillett I whole heartedly agree, but see the agreement and raise you with the fact that the decision is so poorly written I nearly carved my eyes out with soup spoons.
@CommercialAlert @Public_Citizen @Snapchat @Budweiser Come on...all this ‚Äúneed‚Äù to shield kids from every little pressure does nothing but drive curiosity (in many).  My parents, mid 70‚Äôs, turned out great, during an era of cigarette &amp; booze ads. Haven‚Äôt we learned our lessons? Education, not isolation.
@AnnCoulter @nytimes I‚Äôm curious @AnnCoulter, why are you such a nasty person? U are obviously intelligent, &amp; while I respect differing opinions, nearly your entire Twitter feed is whining &amp; insults of some sort. I thought u called urself a journalist? You could be bigger &amp; better w/ more substance.
@BradMossEsq The stymieing of legislation due to partisan pissing matches is out of control &amp; has been for decades. Sadly, Trump is not a true leader but a toxic executive &amp; will only make this worse before it improves. Obama couldn‚Äôt do it, Bush(s) &amp; Clinton either. No way Trump can/will.
@JeffFlake @SenatorCollins You started a war of words, but thus far the only actions are from Trump. What are you going to do about this? What ACTIONS will you take to confront &amp; fix the issue? Stop TALKING and DO SOMETHING. If not, you truly are a lame duck w/ nothing more than a bark...no bite. Coward.
@20committee @DrDenaGrayson Obama doesn‚Äôt have a stamp on this, so he‚Äôs full hog.
@NORML I‚Äôm a long time disabled man w/ multiple issues following 5 spinal reconstructions. While my pain is bad enough to warrant 24/7 opioids, the amount I take now is 50% of what it was 3 years ago due to marijuana. I‚Äôm alive due to marijuana‚Äôs healing props &amp; my story is complex.
@CillizzaCNN Well, it is, and based on his approval ratings, Trump won‚Äôt rescind this any time soon. This is EXACTLY what his base wants, and he knows it.
@MotherJones Cowards. I know the SCOTUS schedule is pretty packed, but my opinion is that they need to re-evaluate how they select cases for hearing. Gerrymandering has been an issue for MANY years &amp; will be so until precedent is set by a SCOTUS ruling. It ain‚Äôt going away.
@Scaramucci @TheDemocrats @POTUS FINALLY! A statement by a Trump shill that I can agree with. Now if we could just sew the sewer under @KellyannePolls‚Äô nose shut, we‚Äôd be a little closer to ending this nonsensical inability to tell the truth.
@RepKinzinger @HouseGOP @HouseCommerce All you‚Äôre doing thus far is making it harder for chronic pain &amp; cancer patients, like myself, to get medications. I agree there‚Äôs an issue, but to legislate something that should be decided by physicians is attacking the wrong end of the problem. Please LISTEN before acting.
@thomaskaine5 @TheDemocrats @DNC Yeh know...for the longest time I left everyone I followed alone, regardless of political bent. As Trump has played out, I had to begin blocking racists &amp; people making hate filled posts. The climate fucking sucks, and I don‚Äôt see a return to civility, EVER. THAT is sad to me.
@foxandfriends @AlanDersh Um...he violated the terms of his parole WHICH HE AGREED TO. I have no knowledge as to his guilt in any other litigation, but when you break parole in a high profile case you get hit with a high level punishment.

Their brand cap has taken a hit &amp; while there might have been SHORT-TERM gain for them the long-game signals death, as tone-deafness doesn‚Äôt grow your brand. It isolates it.

I see very little meaningful actions coming from you, though your rhetoric has grown more toxic. If you‚Äôre going to speak that loud, you better ALSO carry a big stick - something you DEFINITELY ain‚Äôt doin‚Äô.
@Tristan4Maga @BillClinton Actually, they BOTH tried, and were stymied by the Republican Congress. Multiple times. Please educate yourself prior to opening the sewer under your nose.
@SethMacFarlane The propaganda machine is growing.
@MoElleithee Indeed it is. Sadly, to simply go dark gives 100% of the voice to the lunatics running the asylum. It ain‚Äôt pretty, and I wish civility would return as king, but that‚Äôs just not who are as long as trump is in office. Sadly, we might never return to a civil time.
@johncusack Too many people, apparently, give no fucks &amp; the propaganda machine known as @gop twitter acct keeps pumping out topical authoritarian notes. @realDonaldTrump will ruin this country &amp; at least 1/2 of it applauds him. THAT is the travesty here. We live w/ shitty ppl like it or not
@SenatorHeitkamp Considering there is no way the @gop will support even an ounce of this, it is not more than wordspeak. What then will you DO...ACTUALLY DO...beyond wasted &amp; token words?
@GOP Wow...pouring on the Trump propaganda today, huh? You guys must REALLY be worried.
@marcorubio Funny...none of your ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù support the previous administration‚Äôs attempt at the exact same thing. I believe that to be the epitome of hypocrisy.
@JeffSurfsOregon Damn dude. You look almost the same.  Though, your forehead has outgrown your hairline these days ;)
@GOP Starting the daily Trump propaganda machine early today, I see.
@SaysHummingbird The headline is written as if this is a surprise. There is not a shred of courage in any of the Congressional body. Doesn‚Äôt matter which side of the aisle. They‚Äôve all lost sight of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and look but to only win pissing matches.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Heeeyyy...it‚Äôs the daily Trump propaganda Tweet from this account. Do you a) fear him so much that you omit DAILY info which would be beneficial, b) feel he is doing so poorly that he must receive this daily pandering, or c) TRULY believe that EVERYTHING he does is right? Sad.
@AtheistRepublic I‚Äôm not sure why this tired argument is still being used, especially by people who claim intelligence.  Morality is, at once, both subjective, &amp; defined by man. This was ‚Äúmoral‚Äù then not to mention being practiced in the ‚Äúname of god,‚Äù which tells you everything you need to know.
@AtheistRepublic Just say no to drugs.
@PattyMurray So WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? To now, Dems have nothing but talk &amp; Tweet big words. What will you ACTUALLY DO? Tell us, please.  What ACTIONS are you taking? What pushback DIRECTLY to the president? Stop talking, stop Tweeting &amp; DO SOMETHING.
@Janis67381570 @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs what Putin, Duterte, &amp; now Kim keep saying. Sad that Republicans quashed Obama‚Äôs ideas of doing the same thing they are now congratulating Trump for. It only shows the hypocrisy.
@RuffCkaudia @realDonaldTrump @TraciLbertyBell Speak for only you, you self-deluded idiot. Your tweet is proof of how moronic you are. 70M? Nobody got 70M, though HC came closest while millions have left the R party since then. No math, not even Trumpian mathematical lies, gets that. Educate yourself, idiocy is not becoming.
@realDonaldTrump Good holy moses on a popsicle stick. Your lies have now reached the level of pandering &amp; comedy. YOUR people? Most of your supporters are of below avg intelligence &amp; are sheep. I truly hope you don‚Äôt practice self harm or suicide. That would be TRULY awful. Really. Don‚Äôt do it.
I really don‚Äôt like retweeting, but this must be seen. The @potus is directly responsible for this. He didn‚Äôt push the gas, but his policies did. He has the power to stop this, by railing against hate &amp; racism, but will never change his stripes. He is a racist, hate filled man. https://t.co/mFsdZJLNXS
@Indivisible_TO This isn‚Äôt JUST because of BP. The current administration has emboldened this behavior, &amp; until the WH is held accountable, it will continue.  All non-white people are at risk under this divisive President, and the rights of ALL people are being trampled more than in recent time.
@realDonaldTrump Kind like when Ted Nugent used the same pejorative, but you invited him to the WH.
@MeghanMcCain Disgusted? Yes. Shocked? No. Anyone connected with this administration is classless, dishonest, and lacks even an iota of integrity. We won‚Äôt even mention things like empathy, respect, &amp; accountability. They will destroy much of what has been built since WWII.
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs called hyperbole asshole. Something you‚Äôre VERY familiar with. Idiot.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Behold, the daily piece of Trump propaganda from the GOP acct. This Twitter acct has the potential to pass along countless informational Tweets that could be of national interest, but keeps trying to sell us swamp land in Siberia. Sad.
@KFIAM640 Thank goodness. It‚Äôs outdated.
@SpeakerRyan @PatrickMcHenry A good joke? How about the reflection you see in front of you? Oh that‚Äôs right...you‚Äôre blind to what is around you. Ok then...another joke. How about your political career? Ooh, ooh...I know...you political legacy?!? Yes...that. 	#PaulRyan #NoBalls #Hypocrite #Sad #hypocrisy
@RealOmarNavarro @CTGOP @CAGOP How does your head fit through doorways? It‚Äôs certainly not because it‚Äôs filled with knowledge, thoughts of unity, peace, &amp; good will. You are a disgrace to what America stands for, with your constant bitching &amp; attacks...not to mention narcissism, only surpassed by Trump. Sad.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Fuck Trump &amp; the (now) Trump propaganda MACHINE known as the GOP. Every single thing he does, which you pat him on the back for, was something you resisted during the last admin. Korea? Resisted. Nominations? Resisted. Immigration? Resisted. How does RESISTANCE feel now bitches?
@WrathOfKhan2016 Yes...it‚Äôs wrong. Actually, not only is it wrong, it DEFINES racism. We are going backwards more than any time in history. And with your statement, you are officially part of the problem.
@realDonaldTrump Oh...you mean like the entire Republican Party did with your predescessor?
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs what you said a year ago
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Fuck @realDonaldTrump and fuck you. You‚Äôve become a propaganda  for that bastard.
@JeffFlake No more talk! Action is the only defense. 	#lameduck
Open the dictionary to ‚ÄúFreudian slip,‚Äù and, well, there it is. 		Fox &amp; Friends host slips: Trump's North Korea summit is a 'historic meeting between two dictators' https://t.co/HbSHRYZuie
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Who in the hell runs the @gop twitter account? Pure Trump propaganda, any more.
@LindseyGrahamSC what‚Äôs w/ all the N Korea talk? It‚Äôs big news but so is the fact that you‚Äôve been silent about @POTUS &amp; his cozying up to Russia/China while isolating allies. Russia/China continually try harming us but u remain silent &amp; continue allowing it to happen. NOT GOOD!!
@ryan4sman @BellaSAnthony1 @SenJohnMcCain Doesn‚Äôt mince words? He tells boldface lies to the world‚Äôs leader...all except Putin. Sticking up for America is one thing, but lies allies &amp; posturing to the likes of Russia, China &amp; the Philippines is fucking crazy talk. If that‚Äôs not ‚Äúmincing words‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what is.
@DawneSurley @SenJohnMcCain Statements do nothing. ACTIONS matter.
@ezlusztig @JohnAllenPaulos It is with the heaviest of hearts &amp; greatest sadness that I say, it has. While we will never stop fighting, the @gop is now a Trump propaganda arm, and there are fewer &amp; fewer ppl in gvt who will/CAN stand up for truth &amp; integrity. Again, the fight will not end...just sayin‚Äô.
@lovelostgrl @mog7546 @PrincessBravato @PalmerReport I just happen to disagree. Time will tell, of course, whether possible poor health is a reason. Personally I think he was ‚Äútantruming,‚Äù as it‚Äôs obvious he wanted nothing to do with the G7, especially since Obama was well liked in that circle. Now, DPRK? Rus? Chi? He‚Äôd be all good
@trumpsharted @JenLuvsMonkeys First, I‚Äôm sorry both you &amp; your wife must experience this. 	Second, time to find a lawyer with balls.	Lastly, reread the first sentence.
@mog7546 @PrincessBravato @PalmerReport Whoops... 	The only way to beat Trump is by using truth, knowledge &amp; integrity. As much as I used to like @PalmerReport &amp; hoped beyond hope his articles would ring true, they became akin to what that bastard calls ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù &amp; I don‚Äôt wish to source my own opinions from them.
@mog7546 @PrincessBravato This is from @PalmerReport so be skeptical. I followed him for a LOOONG time, but when too much of his opinion writing turned out false, it became a poor source of ACTUAL news. The
@christoq @PrincessBravato I hate to defend anyone with the name Trump, but the only way to beat him is truth, knowledge &amp; integrity. 		https://t.co/fNKU8nn3Xj
@LouiseMensch @911CORLEBRA777 @Imwastntym @FelisDave @thespybrief @LouiseBagshawe @ericgarland @DrDenaGrayson @lauferlaw I‚Äôll believe it when I see it. 	But all aquiver with anticipation.
@PrincessBravato @PressSec I hate ANYTHING that remotely seems like I‚Äôm defending someone with the name Trump, but honesty &amp; knowledge are what will beat him, not exaggerations. 		https://t.co/fNKU8nn3Xj
This is great news! I know he is not personally against it, so I wonder if this more posturing AGAINST Sessions, or an honest assessment? I‚Äôll take it either way.	#stayoutofmylife #Liberty 		Trump hints at supporting pro-medical marijuana bill https://t.co/UqzFEz8d2q via @newsok
@dandrezner If I‚Äôm reading you correctly you‚Äôre assuming that @dmarusic looks up to Trump, or likes him, based on the quote u gave. I don‚Äôt believe this true- quite opposite. Personally I greatly appreciate, &amp; tend to agree w/ his sentiments, as his opinion is from a Euro view, not American.
@realDonaldTrump Good luck. The world needs more peace. Now, if only you weren‚Äôt such a fucking asshole...
@joerogan on the @ufc prelims:	‚ÄúBOOM...BOOM...BOOOOM! 	He opened him up like a can o‚Äô tuna!‚Äù		You win the inter webs today, Joe. 	Bravo. Brah-voe.
@PolitiBunny Um...rather than speaking hyperbole, or w/ straight-up incorrect facts, @ChurchofSatan FAQ- easily available - tells you that it is an atheists religion/philosophy. In other words, no satan...no god. Educate yourself.
@ExecTap @RealOmarNavarro You‚Äôre using an op-ed to ‚Äúprove‚Äù suppression? Laughable. Try again.
A question I have been asking myself for a very long time. @GOP, in its entirety, but these folks have stayed unusually quiet, or flat-out changed their tunes. https://t.co/Go9dI3XnLM
@SarahKSilverman This man formed so many dreams for even so many more children...myself included. I feel sad that the children of today have no (near) equal of his. We need him now more than ever.
@RealMuckmaker @22aspen36 The saddest thing for America is that we are ROOTING for treason to be proved, as committed by the President of the United States. In the saddest of ways, however, it must be done.
@NRO @RichLowry Thank you for a well written op-ed.  A part of me believes every word written, as it is purely &amp; admittedly speculative, but the HUMAN in me hopes beyond highest hopes for a quick end to his presidency, as the normalization of disrespect &amp; bullying is heartbreaking.
@DearAuntCrabby @LCunninghamII2 Regardless of the article‚Äôs content, it is one of the worst written pieces I‚Äôve laid eyes on in a dog‚Äôs age. If you have an email to PoliticoUSA, please forward, as I would like to submit a resume for an editor position - which they apparently don‚Äôt know they need.
@tribelaw 100% truth. 	That is all.
@SenJohnMcCain Amazing to see you on here. Maintain your true path. I wish you health, and thank you for your lifetime of service to America, and freedom the globe over.
@johncusack That‚Äôs a BIG ditto from SoCal too. I grew up with you, and never missed one of your pieces. Your acting &amp; storytelling has been a cool influence for me. Always hoped to meet you, wondering who you ACTUALLY are, after seeing so many characters brought to life. Keep it up man.
@VP @krauthammer How come you didn‚Äôt speak out when a White House staffer dragged @SenJohnMcCain through the mud, even after @MeghanMcCain called it out?
@PrincessBravato Agreed. We‚Äôve only begun to learn how sneaky they‚Äôve been, and the millions upon millions ‚Äúearned‚Äù from our info. Ditched it months ago.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @gop =Trump propaganda machine		The GOP has done many things TOGETHER &amp; made strides including standing up to him when needed. 		Stop the propaganda &amp; stay the course. Stop spending, forget propaganda, &amp; start listening. 		#GOP #Propaganda #Midterms2018 	#Integrity #OrLackOf #Sad
@RealMuckmaker She blocked me...I‚Äôm such a cunt.
@SenatorCardin GROW complacent? That implies we‚Äôve been doing something. You need to call out @POTUS for his inaction. The people of Puerto Rico deserve better.
@LaurenWern I think I love you. 	That is all.
@SenKamalaHarris So what is your strategy to prevent it? I don‚Äôt mean just Tweeting, but what are you going to DO?		Please respond @SenKamalaHarris
@BreeNewsome @Russian_Starr So, where, then, does an ‚Äúaverage white guy‚Äù like me fall in to your picture? Am I to blame? Am I complicit? I grew up in a family with black &amp; white, &amp; was raised colorblind. Isn‚Äôt generalizing all white men racist? Correct me needed. Not hatin...just tired of being generalized.
@stinchfield1776 @Alyssa_Milano You fop. When did the NRA turn in to an insult machine, replete with lies and spin? I have NEVER heard @Alyssa_Milano say anything about guns EXCEPT sensible control. Not taking anything way, not stripping women of anything. She is a tireless advocate for equality. Unlike you.
@Alyssa_Milano @BMatteau @stinchfield1776 I didn‚Äôt think it was possible for my childhood to return.  Then I read this.
@DavidKris Well twitten.
@Philip_Elliott Um...somebody turned the crazy up to 11 today. Yeesh.
@DavidPriess That‚Äôs called life, homie. I‚Äôm 45 &amp; mom still tells me wipe the seat.  Yeesh...I stopped dribbling, &amp; started lifting the seat years ago.
@HowardA_Esq You won the inter webs today, good sir.
@USNationalGuard @140thWing Actually, a BETTER way to build (and retain) allies is to NOT lay tariffs on them. Hell...Trump cut a deal with ZTE, but levies tariffs on Canada &amp; Mexico because of national security concerns?  I respect all our service members, but come on...be real on what it takes.
@nprpolitics It is truly a worthy &amp; needed cause, but the Bully in Chief‚Äôs wife is not the right person to lead, until she draws a line with integrity. 	#bebetter #domore #bully #hypocrisy #MelaniaTrump #treasonweasel
@thehill And?
@HouseAppropsGOP @USRepRodney Right! So, let‚Äôs keep paying for @EPAScottPruitt &amp; his antics, as well a ‚Äúcelebration of America‚Äù or a parade. Ooh...how about another MASSIVE omnibus that miscalculates debt? Maybe more gold trips for a ‚Äúpresident‚Äù who once quipped he‚Äôd be too busy to golf? Yeh...spending sucks.
@SenatorLankford No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs only your rationale for the continued attacks on @PPFA @PPact. These excuses are the right‚Äôs way of adding pressure to the laundry list of highly misrepresented data which you construct to fit your narrative. Do you realize the GOOD this org does?	#fuckthegop
@GOP @VP How about I leave him a message instead:		You‚Äôre a bigot, xenophobic, racially insensitive hypocrite who hides behind religion as a rationale for your boss &amp; his hate, lack of integrity, &amp; authoritarian whimsy. If you were true to who you say you are, you would have jumped ship.
@Rleuthold2 Hell yeh man. Finding more ways to power. ü§ôüèª
@MrDane1982 @debette_goldry Careful of those racial generalizations. I understand why, &amp; what you feel, but w/ divisive messages coming from the Racist in Chief, isn‚Äôt it even MORE important not to make sweeping generalizations? Isn‚Äôt that EXACTLY what racism is made from? I hate to say this but be better.
@HouseJudDems @realDonaldTrump Yeh? What the hell are you doing about it? I see no action against him re: emoluments violations. You‚Äôre guilty too, if you don‚Äôt find a legal way to take him down.
@lynnv378 @peterdaou I grew up in a family of both white and black ppl &amp; was taught color blindness at an early age. You‚Äôre right...Caucasian ppl can‚Äôt RELATE, but don‚Äôt you DARE tell me we don‚Äôt KNOW what you‚Äôre up against. Your statement is more derisive than uniting. Practice unity, not derision.
@TomiLahren You are absolutely incorrect. Some have lost more than others, but the losses - as sad as they are- are what preserve the 1st Amnd. EVERY person who has kneeled has given their reason for kneeling. If you choose not to hear that &amp; impose YOUR sense of ‚Äúmorality,‚Äù that‚Äôs ur fault.

@RepSwalwell @FBI @TheAtlantic Excellent legislation. @POTUS THIS is what legislation for national security looks like.
@VanJones68 Sadly, the nation has normalized his behavior and continues to allow it since economy #‚Äôs are growing. We CANNOT allow that to be the sole barometer by which we measure him. We cannot allow bullying and lies to escape w/ the rationale of national security. Lies &amp; insults= no win.
@realDonaldTrump - Don‚Äôt need multi-million $ ‚Äúcelebration of America‚Äù for your ego	- Don‚Äôt need your plethora of multi-million $ golf outings (which u said ud be too busy for)	- Don‚Äôt need multi-million $ publicity stunts like Pence walking out of NFL game	- Don‚Äôt need multi-mil $ Cabinet swamp
@realDonaldTrump Uh um...POT...uh um...KETTLE.
@realDonaldTrump Do your job please. Be the leader of the free world &amp; stop acting like a whining child. You‚Äôre a disgrace to this country &amp; the human race; disgusting &amp; vile, w/ ZERO morality &amp; integrity. Bullying our closest allies is not how to make progress.  This is America, not Trump Inc.
@ChurchofSatan A more true statement these eyes have not seen in days.
@marcorubio @CommerceGov Hey...you‚Äôre the one blowing the President. Time for you to go too.
@NewsHour And how much will this cost us?
@newtgingrich @facebook @Nasdaq - Why does Trump refuse to tell the truth?	- Why does he deride and defame so many people, when it is so counterproductive?	- Why won‚Äôt Congress stand up to him and say ‚Äúenough lies?‚Äù		Start with those.
@realDonaldTrump Neither are your comments and tweets but they go on ad nauseum.
@RealOmarNavarro Good holy moses on a popsicle stick. It‚Äôs despicable that you think yourself qualified for office with such decisive rhetoric. You truly are a tool...laughingly so. Maxine Waters must be voted out, but not to the likes of a bigoted Trumpkin as you. I can‚Äôt wait for u to lose!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why is every message from @gop sucking up to Trump? The Republican Party is far more than Trump. Actually...that‚Äôs not true. With but a couple of exceptions, you‚Äôre ALL scared of the orange menace &amp; have allowed your party to be taken from you. You all better beware of midterms.
@charliekirk11 Good lord. You people STILL don‚Äôt get it. Charlie, your mom didn‚Äôt protest what I did to her last night.

@RealOmarNavarro You‚Äôre a loser Omar. Your whiny wanna-be-Trump attitude just won‚Äôt work in California...no matter how bad the incumbent is, you would be worse, &amp; the votes will tell you just that: YOU ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THE SHITTY MAXINE WATERS. Hope your fragile ego won‚Äôt put u in denial.
@LouiseBagshawe Oh yes. Absolutely quaking. So much so that he‚Äôs likely down to 8 hours of sleep each night, has a continual feed of witnesses lining up to talk with him, &amp; has a report that will write itself. Yup. Absolutely quaking.
@apowerblackout @thomaskaine5 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Nailed it, with the exception that it‚Äôs not commemorative coins she‚Äôs buried under, but a gaggle of trashy red MAGA trucker hats &amp; McDonald‚Äôs wrappers.
@TitusNation I simply cannot fathom how out of control the @gop has become. They‚Äôre all complicit in allowing him to denegrate the office he holds, &amp; run scared, for fear of decisive &amp; defamatory conduct. He‚Äôll spin it, claiming leaks by Dem investigators. I can‚Äôt understand any of this.
@RichardBSpencer Hold up there.  If there‚Äôs anything we‚Äôve learned from Trump, it‚Äôs that he is completely unpredictable and often flat-out illogical. And no matter what occurs, he will spin it by saying the Dens are responsible. He‚Äôs a fucking hack who is fumbling with his own tiny hands.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Well, my belief is that once you‚Äôre dead, one problem will be solved. You‚Äôre a useless human being w/ more contradictions than your wife has current sex partners. People w/ a style of denial &amp; blaming are definitely on the list of unsafe people to avoid. That would be you, CUNT.
@WalshFreedom The GOP I knew is gone. Usurpation of truth w/ propaganda, rampant defamation &amp; disrespect, total fear of Trump &amp; allies, out of control spending, more infighting than ever, &amp;  complete international ridicule &amp; consternation. It must be fixed, but I have no confidence it will.
@realAliTweets Come on man. You should know there is no logic behind these faux christians who hind behind their bible as a means to get what they want, not based on consistency in message or ideology. The @GOP is dead &amp; is the party of Trump...which is based on dishonesty, smoke, &amp; mirrors.
@SenBobCorker Wait, THAT‚ÄôS the red line you draw? Tariffs? Not his outright attack on the DOJ or private citizens? Not the blatant lies &amp; propaganda? Not the continued denigration of his office? Not the racist, separatist crutch he offers? Not the defamation &amp; slander? But TARIFFS? 	NOT ENOUGH
@TitusNation Never apologize for truth.
@RealOmarNavarro @chargergreg Can‚Äôt wait to watch you go down in flames. I don‚Äôt mind your ideolog, but you pander to deceit &amp; spin, not values.		ADMITTED by his campaign, he uses this account largely to blast lies &amp; mount separatist attacks that spread us further apart, not uniting. That‚Äôs not what we need.
@GOP Blah blah blah...the @GOP is rank with misconduct, just as much as the Democratic Party. The difference is that you pander in boldface propaganda now, and have abandoned your core values. You should be concerned w/ the truth AT ALL COSTS! No spin, no deceit. You‚Äôre failing. STOP!
@PalmerReport Palmer, you‚Äôre useless. I was a fan for some time, but you haven‚Äôt been right in a very long time. ‚ÄòUnfollow‚Äô
@NormEisen @joncoopertweets @tribelaw @RWPUSA @washingtonpost Yeh, but for every one of you who says that‚Äôs not possible, there is one who says it is. The ACTUAL truth is that nobody knows, as it‚Äôs not been tested. I hope you‚Äôre right, as he is ruining my hope in this country.
@joncoopertweets Why is it that countless ACTUAL constitutional scholars have no idea about this? Don‚Äôt pedal a false narrative, even if I wish it were true. At least pedal it as opinion...or a wish. Just don‚Äôt fucking mislead or lie like the embarrassment in the WH.
@jedshug Bah. Do you have any fucking clue how many times those words have been uttered? Too many. It makes no dif. Even IF they were impeachable, he would have been impeached. And even if impeached, it‚Äôd never get anywhere. All Dems &amp; 18 Reps would have to vote in Senate.	#Screwed
@ChurchofSatan Good holy moses on a popsicle stick. That is staggering.
@BrianStell1 @NitroRad Dumbass. That‚Äôs the Satanic Temple.  The Church of Satan, a religious organization dedicated to Satanism as codified in The Satanic Bible, is atheistic &amp; does not practice illegality, and rarely issue political statements, as there is no one core ideology.
@GmgGz @therealroseanne @ChelseaClinton I love seeing people who are LITERALLY hoodwinked before their eyes, believing debunked stories just because you are told to believe by lies.

@Cernovich @AmyMek Oh yeh...I hear ya on that one. Kinda like how her words have unsighted the same kind of thing. Yeesh. You‚Äôre almost as big a tool as @realDonaldTrump. Almost.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt know who is running this page, but it‚Äôs turned in to nothing more than a propaganda page for @realDonaldTrump, and that‚Äôs not a good thing. Think twice about these disingenuous posts, as they only harm the country.
@AmyMek @HuffPost Kudos to @HuffPost for this story. All the same rights you hide behind are the same rights the media has to (legally) dig up dirt. Don‚Äôt dish it out if you can‚Äôt take it. Personally, I hope this story drives you in to seclusion. Your opinion is driven on hate &amp; therefore useless.
@AmyMek @HuffPost Great story. I applaud @HuffPost for shedding light
@iamsambee You‚Äôre a coward. Nobody says something like that without meaning it.  Stick to your guns...it seems the only way to be heard any more is by making boundary-shattering tasteless, but true, remarks.
@RealOmarNavarro, a Trump ass kisser, is running for office in California. The fact that he rationalizes @therealroseanne and paints her as the victim is why he should not be elected.

@RealOmarNavarro @therealroseanne Freedom of speech is indeed protected, but come on you moron...no employer would allow this kind of talk. Hence, why she was essentially ‚Äúfired.‚Äù  And that you have no issues w/ what she said is why you will not be elected in California.
@AntonioSabatoJr @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hence the reason I am not voting for you.

@Broken_Marine37 @mchooyah @davidhogg111 Nope.
@mchooyah @davidhogg111 Such a useless thread, and even more useless comments. Just utterly useless.  All your conspiracy theory BS makes the entire right look foolish. But carry on. Those of us conservatives who still think logically will laugh, as a majority of the right laughs &amp; chastises you.
@ColoLibertarian @SenCoryGardner Tell me about it. It‚Äôs like these dudes just wanna spend spend spend.
@MrFilmkritik You should delete this. It‚Äôs incorrect and only adds fuel to the Republican fire, who say that folks who want gun control always lie about facts. If you feel so strong about posting the list and making a point, then it should at least be a truthful list.
@TomNamako That‚Äôs a logical thought, but what about a school like my son‚Äôs, which has 3000 students? The first major fire or dangerous evacuation would result in numerous deaths.

@ChurchofSatan ALWAYS, is the bosom of life suckled.
@Shann_Q0 Your sentence construct implies ‚ÄúAtheist‚Äù as a pejorative.  You might not have intended it as so, but that‚Äôs how it reads.
@Shann_Q0 Nothing like a generalized statement to make atheists look bad. Just sayin.
@RealOmarNavarro Ug. Now there‚Äôs some facts. Here‚Äôs more:	-according to a response on another thread, Omar relies on his web page for stated policies &amp; uses Twitter only to bash. This is admitted by campaign. 	-Waters is bad but CA does not need another politician on a bully pulpit.	#BeBetter
@ChurchofSatan Um...I‚Äôll play. 	What is, hypocrisy?
@PressGop @RealOmarNavarro Not to mention admitting that policy info won‚Äôt be found here, rather Twitter will be used to whine, complain, &amp; defame other Americans is sad. I can‚Äôt stand Maxine, and had high hopes for Omar. He has proven himself substanceless &amp; someone who whines when he wants something.
@PressGop @RealOmarNavarro So...no response to the real meat of the matter...why won‚Äôt he answer to constituents for his abhorrent behavior on Twitter? I can‚Äôt stand Maxine, and had hoped to see her unseated. I cannot vote for someone who focuses on attacks &amp; not issues. Oh...website notwithstanding.
@RealOmarNavarro Just like you. All I see from you is Maxine this, Maxine that. If we didn‚Äôt know it was an election year we‚Äôd think you were obsessed. Focus on the issues &amp; what you can do BETTER .  All the whining does is make you look like a child.
@SenFeinstein How do you square this decision, after she unequivocally stated that she would not restart any form of advanced interrogation? If that‚Äôs the only concern, she answered that. From a constituent.
@markkitching @BMatteau @NRATV @ItsBrunchOclock @stinchfield1776 @Alyssa_Milano If by failed you mean, the dreams and desire of EVERY boy in America, and probably some girls, then yeh...you nailed it. Hell...she still my dream woman.
@Novartis Your downfall is coming. Be warned. It‚Äôs going to be painful.
@PalmerReport Hold on man. I read you every day, and while I know your MO, lets be truthful. Trump was NOT caught taking bribes. Cohen has more shadiness attached to him, but nothing concrete yet. Don‚Äôt spread fake news until it‚Äôs real.
@Lisap795 Why should I spoonfeed you? If you‚Äôre not aware of info, look it up yourself.  I‚Äôve taken the time to educate myself on this...something your now-illustrated laziness has obviously precluded you from doing.
@Lisap795 Lol. That‚Äôs not true. If you had any understanding of law, contracts may be entered w/out signatory.  I‚Äôll spare you the details though, as you‚Äôre obviously not interested in anything #Trump doesn‚Äôt spoonfeed you. Cheers.	#Moron #Sheep #DeplorablyUneducated
@SenTedCruz @Heritage Nah, I‚Äôll pass. If I want to hear and see garbage spewn, I‚Äôll watch the sanitation workers on Wednesday morning.
@Lisap795 Uh, signed or not, the U.S. along w/ ally nations had the deal in place, as agreed to w/ Iran. Only has Israel stated Iran is not compliant. Should have reneg new deal while this was in place.		So, speaking of not signing, ur logic my cross over to the NDA Dennis didn‚Äôt sign. Hmm
@dRwOOD73 @LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories And thank you for the polite exchange.
@dRwOOD73 @LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories 100% agreed. I understand why the alt-right doesn‚Äôt like him, but most of those folks are sheep (not all) and consume whatever they‚Äôre spoon fed. Bernie is an example of someone not afraid not to break ‚Äúparty lines‚Äù if beneficial for his constituents. I wish more politicians did.
@SenBobCasey Well, IMO, Congress did not do enough to prevent this. There was nowhere near the amount of time spent on the floor that this demanded. Congress should have made it clear that this was not acceptable.  What EXTRA measures did you take to prevent this?
@dRwOOD73 @LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories And NONE of what I responded with is meant to offend or detract from your message.  The opinion is solely mine.
@dRwOOD73 @LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories I‚Äôm not prepared to debate Lamb‚Äôs personal win.  I was only making the statement that sometimes the middle road, with someone who listens to his/her voters, is not a bad place to be. The super progressives won‚Äôt like it, nor will the far right, but it‚Äôs just my opinion.
@dRwOOD73 @LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories This is not always true, but I was eluding to Conor Lamb‚Äôs victory. I can‚Äôt speak to PA politics, as I‚Äôm on the west coast, but Lamb is a moderate who is not afraid to vote yay on issues that would typically be considered Repub ideologies.
@dRwOOD73 @LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories IMHO, it‚Äôs OK to have a moderate (R or D), as someone too far left or too far right immediately excludes a large part of his/her constituency. Having a moderate who will do what‚Äôs best for his/her voters &amp; NOT just tow the party line CAN be a positive force.
Holy Moses on a popsicle stick...Alex Jones has transcended media entertainer &amp; graduated to a full fledged lunatic. I can‚Äôt WAIT for him to be convicted as a co-conspirator the next time someone kills due to his abhorrent rhetoric. 	#AlexJones #Traitor #Lunatic https://t.co/NnjGI7NqyD
@TheJusticeDept Look, I‚Äôm merely a lay person, and while I appreciate that he was caught &amp; sentenced, 5 years is nothing. If we want to make a dent in child porn distribution then the punishment must be no less than 20 years to life. Period. End of story.
@gelles @CNNPolitics Consider the source. 	‚ÄòNuff said.
@MortuaryReport If it makes you feel any better, I can‚Äôt pull‚Äôem off either. Just sayin.
@samstein Actually, I looked, and she‚Äôs under ‚Äúenabler‚Äù as well. Whoda thunk.
@samstein Sorry. I can‚Äôt give her any props when she is married to one of the planet‚Äôs biggest bullies. I believe when one looks up the word ‚Äúhypocrite‚Äù in Webster‚Äôs, Melania is pictured, silently waving.
@LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories Nah, not mad at facts. Mad that FUCKING MORONS like u construct causes to fit narratives rather than the reciprocal. How you claim to be right, when there is ample evidence that the man ran as a moderate (opposed to true blue), illustrates your inability to see truth. Like Trump.
@carccbiggsc @LeftwardSwing @grannysidney @HillaryGuess You are both ignorant &amp; an idiot. Since when is medicine one size fits all? If MJ works for you, then fab. I live in CA &amp; have ample access to both, as a disabled person. MJ does not come close to the pain relief that opioids do. You are part of the problem but don‚Äôt know it.
@LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories You‚Äôre a fucking idiot. Where was there ANY mention of any of this? Pull your head out of your ass &amp; stop trying to make him out to be someone he never represented himself as. You are why people like #Trump, as your narrative is equal to that of ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù  DJ ran as a moderate
@charliekirk11 I have not seen that poll but have seen the numbers offered. If is true, give it a week. What might be more concerning is how the Millennial &amp; 1at time voters  absolutely despise Trump, as well as females (ed &amp; uned all age groups) and total minorities. #Trump is on his way out.
@charliekirk11 Oversaw? Oh dude...the trash you spew is priceless! Overseeing implies active supervision. Terrorist groups always form in a vacuum. There was no (U.S.) oversight of ISIL &amp; u should be charged w/ defamation. Such a fucking idiot. It‚Äôs hard to believe you can breathe w/out help.
@charliekirk11 Boy, this is one of your  least original, least sensible things you‚Äôve said in a while. Well, the last two days. There is a plethora of op-eds written about this, as well as in academia. Your command of fact &amp; ability to relatable evidence is almost nil. 		https://t.co/4bEPyOpeaa
@charliekirk11 I can‚Äôt speak for liberals, but I don‚Äôt mind foreigners who follow the process correctly. Besides - although I‚Äôm sure you missed this one too - the number of crimes you mention, committed in the US, are overwhelmingly committed by citizens. Wouldn‚Äôt expect u to have resrchd that
@charliekirk11 Why? They‚Äôre STILL rights. If I choose NOT to an exercise a right it doesn‚Äôt mean it disappears. I missed a vote in 1992 due to health issues, but casted 2 yrs later; decided not to publish an op-ed in 1987, but had no issue w/ 1A the next year; the list goes on.	#ScareTactics
@marlonoreilly @charliekirk11 @POTUS Uh...do you have even the slightest idea what treason is, how it‚Äôs defined, and how it is prosecuted? Oh wait. You don‚Äôt.
@charliekirk11 Dude...you‚Äôre killing me here! It wasn‚Äôt the hat, moron, it was the whole ‚Äúslavery is a choice‚Äù bit of ‚Äúfree thought‚Äù that outraged a chunk of the planet. But I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt read the Euro conversations about barring him, or the multiple generalizations he put on blacks. Yep.
@charliekirk11 You do know this has been an annual caravan for many years...right? &amp; has been met with compassion by presidents going back long before you were even a thought in your daddys‚Äô pants. They don‚Äôt all get in &amp; bipartisan legisltrs outlined who would &amp; wouldn‚Äôt, via DHS or other dept
@charliekirk11 @jimmykimmel Last I checked, JK was not anointed the arbiter of healthcare reform. He used his platform to speak about a personal issue. If we follow your logic then based on your obsession with #Trump you should be the ambassador for all things mancrush w/ love of tiny peckers-n-orange hair.
@charliekirk11 Uh...Charlie Charlie Charlie. I‚Äôm literally laughing out loud at your lack of any tie to sanity. You do realize that statistics for ethnicities exist as a damn good barometer for drawing quantified conclusions of political party &amp; race...right? It‚Äôs not 100%, but it‚Äôs a barometer
@charliekirk11 @JoyAnnReid Not true. #TreasonWeasel #Trump has been doing ALL OF THE ABOVE for over two years, has been caught multiple times, annnnnnd...
@charliekirk11 Gunpoint? What? Facts please. 		With all that you spout about constitutionality &amp; the framers, did you miss one of their biggest goals? 		‚ÄúNo taxation without representation.‚Äù		The comedy gold of your half-whit brain just OOZES in to the crevices of your stupidity &amp; hypocrisy.
@charliekirk11 HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAH!!!! Man...if I would have realized the amount of comedy posted on your acct I would have checked in more often!
@charliekirk11 Indeed! A perfect tweet illustrating the definition of hypocrisy. Thanks man!
@charliekirk11 They‚Äôre not. Trump‚Äôs own people concluded it was not true. Or did you miss that lil tidbit too? Man...you‚Äôre just not the sharpest cookie out there are ya, Nancy? 		(That was rhetorical, in case you missed it).
@charliekirk11 Absolutely, patently untrue. Hence the word AMENDment. The framers knew this.  I don‚Äôt blame you...you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to comprehend such dynamic ideologies.
@charliekirk11 You are correct. There are many gender identities. Big difference you troglodyte.
@charliekirk11 @tedlieu ZERO evidence? The evidence is plain as day. When the President lies, we‚Äôre not fucking stupid enough to rationalize his ‚Äúalt facts.‚Äù  We see them exactly as they are. Lies. It‚Äôs easy to prove most of them. How is THAT not corrosive to our country? Please explain.
@charliekirk11 @DineshDSouza SHE broke no laws. The campaign did, if $$ was not returned. Private citizens are never fined by the FEC you tool.
@Digidiva2018 @charliekirk11 @gal_deplorable That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not true. Reread the article &amp; you‚Äôll find the number of people arrested was 7, on 28 counts. Still despicable, but don‚Äôt be spoonfed lies. Do your own research. One of those people was added to the total to increase it from 6 to 7, if u read carefully. Sheep.
@laurahartner @charliekirk11 That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not true. Even within the article he sites, it‚Äôs 7 people for 28 counts, one of whom has been doing it for years, but was lumped in to this stat to increase it. Don‚Äôt believe everything you‚Äôre fed...sheep.
@Nunya96693453 @HoffmanHopes @charliekirk11 Um...no. You are completely devoid of fact. Pull your fingers out, reread, &amp; count. The utter stupidity of some &amp; the willingness to believe whatever they‚Äôre fed is incredible! You‚Äôre a sheep, &amp; pandering fake news. Oops...I mean alt facts.
@charliekirk11 No, it doesn‚Äôt. Being a Republican doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically like &amp; respect all other R‚Äôs. BTW...why would he want someone there who personally slandered &amp; belittled his military service (among other things) on a day when his family is at their lowest? You, sir, are an idiot
@DKFMTracks Excellent band, excellent cut.
@ReaganBattalion @marklevinshow The more tweets I read of yours, the more I like you.
Not really a ‚Äúlife hack,‚Äù but for my fellow weary travelers, it might feel like one. You‚Äôre welcome. https://t.co/LfpUl6wBeu
@djchillsnyc @SarahPalinUSA Silent coup? You‚Äôre an idiot. A YUGE one. Good lord.
@ovalheaded @BillBeaman2 @SarahPalinUSA So...you obviously know more than the House, the Senate, &amp; the entirety of the legal community in order to make those claims. Your subjectivity &amp; sheepishness is showing. Time to head back to mom‚Äôs basement.
@alt_labor While the rest of the country appears to pity her, I have ZERO empathy. She‚Äôs a party to much of his abhorrent behavior, &amp; while she can‚Äôt change him, staying with him only enables his fetid nature. 	#TrumpCrimeFamily #NoScrubs
@LeftwardSwing @Sea_Stories Actually, Jones never claimed himself a dyed in the wool progressive, nor did he claim outright war against Trump. He‚Äôs representing a constituency. Don‚Äôt put party before politics, as he‚Äôs obviously listening to his voters. It‚Äôs early on yet so be patient. Moderates = üëç. Ask PA
@krassenstein @imthe420nerd Heaven forbid I say anything remotely related to an excuse for the #TreasonWeasel, but when did it become a bisexual threesome?
@blackvoices @shannonrwatts I don‚Äôt mind the permit issue or the safety class. To drive a car one must take multiple days of driver‚Äôs ed, get a permit, THEN get licensed. The character reference piece, however, is HIGHLY subjective and approaches discrimination. This part will def be overturned if litigated
@jbarro That‚Äôs just the awesome. Birchbox for crypto...any other single dads get this, or am I in an island, alone?
@mcspocky It‚Äôs called hypocrisy.
@alt_labor @RealMuckmaker Hey #Trump! We found the village that‚Äôs missing you.
@JeffreyGuterman ‚Äú...focused on the law not the facts.‚Äù  I think what some say is early-stage dementia might not be so early stage. Either that, or it‚Äôs ‚Äúalternative law.‚Äù
@CREWcrew Come on. Give the guy a break. It‚Äôs only been a year and a half.
@FoxNews @dbongino Fucking idiots. He is doing nothing more than he was appointed to do by other Republicans. Besides, if he truly (metaphorically) lacks constitutionality in his approach then indictments will be tossed &amp; folks will go free. Seems that would be preferable, unclear you‚Äôre scared.
@thehill That‚Äôs entirely too logical.
@TeaPainUSA @LCunninghamII2 ‚ÄúHad‚Äù not ‚Äúhas‚Äù
@TeaPainUSA @LCunninghamII2 What? Nixon has no respect for democracy. He tried to stifle everything until he couldn‚Äôt escape. That‚Äôs not respecting democracy, that‚Äôs getting caught and running out of options. They‚Äôre both crooked as they come.
@denise_read @Rosie @nypost Precisely. That is why the FEC doesn‚Äôt fine citizens for these infractions. But hey...if this is the best the @gop can do then it is painfully obvious they are going down in flames.
@peterdaou I‚Äôve been saying this since the campaign. The ‚Äúchristian‚Äù right has chosen the path of hypocrisy over their own self-proclaimed piousness.  There is so much irony in what they do it‚Äôs hard to believe they can walk upright. Sadly, and not to be cliche, but they are complicit AF.
@TrueFactsStated @gregg_schneider Sure he could Claude. It‚Äôd just be a Cliff Notes version or an animated take (with Hentai).
@DrDenaGrayson @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Would believe? No. Already believe? Yes.
@superwuster I would also add that considering the upcoming construction of at least one MASSIVE new complex, I‚Äôd call that a cost increase on the grandest scale.
@superwuster Try reading the price increase verbiage again. There are changes (ie increases) in services &amp; products (digital).  I ain‚Äôt happy about it, but it‚Äôs not as blasphemous as you make it out to be. For those who don‚Äôt like it, they can cancel.
@ReneeLTorres @peterdaou No prob Renee. You made your points, respectfully. Thank you.
@linmp1031 @CollinJRae @DevinNunes @DevinNunesMom @DevinNunesMom 	I was being tongue &amp; cheek by tagging ‚Äúher.‚Äù	;)
@thehill Is it just me or has the @gop become such an inbred barrel of monkeys that they‚Äôll stop at no level of depravity to win? Granted, his opponent appears to be a pretty sizable douchebag, but still.  The normalization of such fetid conduct is reprehensible &amp; it‚Äôs not just the right.
@Mike121948 @YossiGestetner @ClassJzMusician They didn‚Äôt threaten...they merely followed the breadcrumbs to where they lead. Since Jr appears to have been involved with said crumbs, Sr caved in order to save him. That‚Äôs not a threat...that‚Äôs called gettin caught with a hand in the cookie jar.
@YossiGestetner @SaraCarterDC @RealSaavedra @RyanAFournier @ChuckRossDC @RepMarkMeadows @RepDeSantis @RepLeeZeldin @JesseRodriguez @Scaramucci @DevinNunes Not to mention that when reporters question Trump about his own blatant lies &amp; conduct - you know...because there are such major discrepancies in his stories of just about anything - you blow a fuse. Hypocrisy has made you her bitch &amp; it is ridiculously obvious. ZERO CREDIBILITY
@YossiGestetner @SaraCarterDC @RealSaavedra @RyanAFournier @ChuckRossDC @RepMarkMeadows @RepDeSantis @RepLeeZeldin @JesseRodriguez @Scaramucci @DevinNunes It‚Äôs an ongoing investigation so of course redactions were made. Transparency is indeed needed, but you seem to only cry foul when it involves someone close to Trump. You‚Äôre laughably hypocritical &amp; your logical  arguments wouldn‚Äôt hold water if they were submerged in a pool.
@YossiGestetner Come on man. That‚Äôs because Flynn‚Äôs level of disparity &amp;  sacrilege FAR outweigh Kerry‚Äôs (whom I believe to also be a lying sack of excitement). You will cry ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù when in reality he‚Äôs merely gotten what he deserves. Apples &amp; oranges man. Apples &amp; oranges. Idiot.
@CollinJRae @linmp1031 @DevinNunes Hell...even @DevinNunesMom knows this! She warned him to play nice. Especially in Fresno &amp; Tulare counties where the Hispanic population is so large. His country-bumpkin ass will be bent over sans Crisco, only to (hopefully) be voted out.
@CollinJRae @linmp1031 @DevinNunes Truer words have not been spoken. His fight to be relevant is about as transparent as Trump‚Äôs hands are small. Ironically, when Trump is finally ousted, Nu√±es will return to the rock he was hiding under, &amp; face a constituency who is tired of his racial bias &amp; lies. He‚Äôs done.
@YossiGestetner Innocent people of his stature do not admit to something they didn‚Äôt do in order to ‚Äúmake the pain stop.‚Äù They fight.  He‚Äôs a career military man who rose to the rank of general, but he can‚Äôt stomach  inquiries in to what has already been proven as true? This ‚Äúlogic‚Äù is asinine.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @juliaioffe Holy Moses on a popsicle stick. If that‚Äôs not insulting &amp; racially biased I don‚Äôt know what is.  How does liking tacos translate to ‚ÄúI love Hispanics?‚Äù I wonder if Gonzalo Curiel believes this? 		#Trump #TreasonWeasel #RacistPresident #Sad #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpCrimeFamily #Idiot
@linmp1031 @CollinJRae Um...fucking yay?	@DevinNunes is a tool who hides behind his ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù hypocrisy &amp; continually places partisan politics &amp; person BEFORE patriotism &amp; true leadership. The only thing he ‚Äúleads‚Äù is the race to #Trump &amp; his tiny orange pecker. He is the poster child for the Swamp.
@ReneeLTorres @peterdaou This i do agree with, although I have yet to see evidence that Amazon employees are a) underpaid, or b) need more protection than any other US employee.  Amazon was continually voted, by its employees, as one of the best places to work so I‚Äôm struggling w/ some of ur claims.
@TycoTheMighty And you may certainly choose to believe whatever you desire. Just as I am ‚Äústuck‚Äù with the facts of who has (seemingly often) attacked me. To each his/her own. Hopefully, hate on EVERY level is quelled, though I have little confidence until Trump is gone.
@TycoTheMighty I‚Äôm not interested in other people or what Google says about protected class harassment. I‚Äôm talking about ME.  My family has blacks, whites, Hispanics, &amp; Asians, &amp; I have worked my entire life to advance equality. Sadly, my experiences tell me that hate flows from all races.
@EdKrassen @TycoTheMighty None of our complaining &amp; callouts will matter until the @gop is voted out, as they‚Äôve chosen to align themselves on the side of hate, &amp; his ‚Äúbase‚Äù seems to operate on hypocrisy level 10. Until that time comes, or Dems retake the House (ie Impeach), he appears to be Teflon. Sad.
@DebraMessing @TycoTheMighty @PressSec @ananavarro @NicolleDWallace @AprilDRyan Debra, as if I didn‚Äôt love you enough, then you wrap a response to @PressSec in a YUGE shroud of eloquence that now I‚Äôm just straight up smitten.		And yes...you are ‚Äúthe most beautiful woman.‚Äù
@TycoTheMighty Uh...when &amp; where did I suggest any person sit idly as slurs are elicited? I merely point out that there is context we are not aware of, &amp; I hear two people in a heated exchange. His words were abhorrent &amp; flat out wrong &amp; I make no rationale or excuses.
@ReneeLTorres @peterdaou Thank you for a polite &amp; respectful exchange.
@ReneeLTorres @peterdaou Would it be ‚Äúnice‚Äù? Sure. But I can‚Äôt get behind any argument that demands redistribution of wealth in the way you imply. That‚Äôs called communism. And FWIW, the fact is that YES...the wealthier get moreso while the poor get poorer. It is not, however, on Bezos to solve the issue.
@ReneeLTorres @peterdaou Oh no...I understand your thinking, but you‚Äôve still set a level of reciprocity that is neither demanded nor legally binding. I would be curious about your food stamps comment &amp; what factual evidence yields any % base of employees that exceeds any other business.
@krassenstein @JCTRamblerINC Sadly, his followers are beyond any kind of moral compass, &amp; what would have been damning for ANYBODY ELSE is excused in order to advance a fetid agenda w/ no integrity or truth. I pity our children, who will pay for his lies and deception. Not to mention our intl relationships.
@QuantaMagazine Good holy Moses on a popsicle stick. Numbers are so damn eloquent it hurts.
@Natasha_Rossiya @LouiseMensch @Yaro_RT Oh that‚Äôs right...Putin. Carry on.
@Natasha_Rossiya @LouiseMensch @Yaro_RT Good holy Moses on a popsicle stick. Who appointed you the arbiter of what is normal, usual, &amp; true? Your own indignities are showing...you might try less irony &amp; more fiber, seeing that the stick up your poop shoot appears to be fighting back.
@JeffreyGuterman Wait...did I just write this?	I‚Äôm doing ALL OF THE ABOVE, with ALL OF THE ABOVE.
@mrbromwich This feeling is true for many who‚Äôve never even met the man. He was ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Mayor‚Äù following 9/11, but quickly faded. His fetid need for relevance has rendered him without integrity, and continues down a path that could ruin what little time he has left on the earth.
@Capitol_Weekly It will be difficult, but not impossible. As a life-long Californian, I can speak to the fact that there is some serious frustration here. That said, while change is needed, I have a hard time believing any person beyond a centrist, moderate Republican could win. I welcome that.
@mitchellvii Mueller has ZERO ‚Äúopenly corrupt‚Äù behavior. He has played everything close to the vest &amp; has kept everybody guessing. There is nothing he is doing (that we know of) that is illegal or w/out reason.  You‚Äôre just upset because he keeps finding things. Direct your anger to the DAG.
And yet the response from DC is tantamount to the 80‚Äôs war on drugs, which failed miserably. I am disabled, and utilize prescribed opiates, yet am constantly met w/ issues because politicians believe they know what is right for me, or pressure dr‚Äôs to the same. War on drugs = BAD https://t.co/StAXLxyyvr
@RepAdamSchiff @Aaron_Fernandes That, and the fact that the @gop is now fully supportive of the most dishonest &amp; integrity-lacking president in the history of the U.S. and that polls for support are RISING! WTF has become of this country?
@rubycramer While every journey begins with a step, quantity is nowhere near as important as quality. Personally, I vote for the best candidate regardless of what hides between the legs. It is important to see more women run, but it will take time for experience to catch up (sadly).
@Jackie2712 @peterdaou Yes, there is a dynamic gap between the wealthy &amp; poor. But it is not for you (or me) to decide what is morally appropriate. Morality is a social construct (usually) &amp; cannot be defined in a one-size-fits-all way. What I wouldn‚Äôt do, you may have good reason TO do. Same w/ wealth
@ReneeLTorres @peterdaou But you‚Äôre deciding what deems such a thing &amp; essentially defining morality for all. While extremely admirable for the wealthiest to share, they should not be compelled based on what others believe is moral. You imply that all people emote or consider morality similarly. Not true
@JessicaValenti @adamcbest Eloquently stated &amp; equally true. Though in all fairness, nobody blasted Michelle Obama for essentially saying the same thing. Nor Hillary for a similar comment in ‚Äò16.  I despise the lying @PressSec , but it‚Äôs important to be fair or u look like a whiner		https://t.co/9gBCvHT9L3
@TomSteyer @GLSCHWALL Sadly Tom, he is rising in polls. Those who voted for him have no moral compass &amp; care only for his ‚Äúpolitics.‚Äù To me, that is more sad than the fact that he was elected in the first place. When 1/3 of our country, including an entire political party, is behind Trump, that‚Äôs sad.
@peterdaou I understand your thoughts, but Bezos gives a lot of $$.  No person should be compelled to provide for others simply due to wealth, not that u suggested such. People are demonized for extreme wealth, no matter how much they give. Your statement is true, but the connotation isn‚Äôt.
@nancysnegron @EveHammond13 Thank you for the polite exchange.
@nancysnegron @EveHammond13 Perfectly said, w/ the exception of a bit of condescension at the end.  		To each his/her own. 		I‚Äôll continue calling out what I see as reverse discrimination so that greater equality might be achieved in the future; not token apologies &amp; excuses for a past I was not part of
@jaketapper @KellyannePolls Um...so says the troll from INSIDE the WH. 		@KellyannePolls if there lived a person with less credibility than #Trump, it would be you.
@nancysnegron @EveHammond13 Sorry. I‚Äôm fighting back. I‚Äôm tired of paying for the sins of others. I have lived a life of respect, tolerance, &amp; acceptance but will not be bullied by anyone- white, black, etc. &amp; that will inevitably end in someone calling me racist. I‚Äôm not...I‚Äôm ‚Äúchecking‚Äù them, as you say.
@MtnMD @RepSwalwell Wow. Quite the wordsmith you are.  And what whit. Yeesh. Bernie can go too. It‚Äôs time the old guard move aside.  Besides...it‚Äôs Twitter.  You clearly aren‚Äôt as intelligent as you think you are.
@themichaelnero I see what you did there.
@nancysnegron @EveHammond13 They are at times violent, though not to me, and I watch the hatred flow from the young black community. I have done nothing but embrace a colorless society, yet this is what I‚Äôm met with. Violence &amp; hate for things I have no control over. 		THAT could explain this man‚Äôs hate.
@nancysnegron @EveHammond13 I can tell you from experience.  I was raised in a ministers family with black, brown &amp; Asian relatives - a meltin pot to which I was colorblind. 		Now, after years being picked on by young blacks (because I‚Äôm handicapped) I have learned why. I deal w/ reverse racism daily.
@nancysnegron @EveHammond13 He may be racist but this makes no mention of the yelling &amp; reverse slurs from the woman. Don‚Äôt promote differences w/out providing context. It doesn‚Äôt make either person in the right &amp; racial slurs are despicable, but many young minorities today are SUPER rude &amp; provocative.
@DonnaRu31144721 @cal_gal53 @Alyssa_Milano Donna w/ her whopping 17 followers opposed to AM, who u say does not care. Your ignorance must be painful. Ms Milano is a constant voice &amp; has involved herself deeply in multiple causes. If that‚Äôs not the antithesis to your useless rants then nothing is. You‚Äôre a waste &amp; a liar.
@cal_gal53 @MadVickie @Alyssa_Milano @cal_gal53 you‚Äôre a fucking hypocrite.
@BlackSheep427 @Actual_Demons @Alyssa_Milano Cool.  So u agree that abortion should not be illegal &amp; that the pro-life movement infringes on her rights as a woman. It‚Äôs been settled by @Scotus so it‚Äôs just as good as a constitutional amendment w/ precedent. You‚Äôre not forced to like, pay for, or participate in her life.
@kdeleon Yes but allowing criminal immigrants to hide in sanctuary cities is not ok either. I support legal immigration but if u want to win, u need to stop the big influx of undocumented and reign in spending, focusing on rebuilding where the state has fallen short, not on non-citizens.
@CAGOP So...now that you‚Äôve put together some stats that are not completely accurate, why don‚Äôt you tell us why the Dems have been in office so long? It‚Äôs because that is who was voted in by Californians. Nobody held at gunpoint. They freely chose not to allow an even worse party to win
@brithume That‚Äôs because god and/or a ‚Äúsavior‚Äù or Jesus has absolutely ZERO to do with anything. Not the day, not the horse.
I‚Äôve been sick to death over continued @gop railing against the Steele dossier. If this doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúeven things out‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what does. 	#Trump #TreasonWeasel #Hypocrite #ImpeachTrumpNow https://t.co/1gmYiZAZyq
@RepSwalwell Ugh. She needs to go away. She is no longer relevant, and poses nothing more than harm to any progressive agenda. Yet, she keeps inserting herself anywhere she can.
@RepMarkMeadows You are such an idiot, and a scumbag. Of course info would be protected &amp;/or redacted...it‚Äôs an active investigation. This is called a ‚Äúduh‚Äù moment. It‚Äôll be great when you are beaten out, which will be at the next applicable election. You‚Äôve put party before country.
@SenFeinstein @RonWyden @SenJeffMerkley Know what else hasn‚Äôt happened in modern history U.S. history? Having a @potus who truly cannot decipher truth from fiction, yet you have let him slide numerous times. Guess who I will NOT be voting for this year?!? Yup...you.  You‚Äôve failed your constituency and need to go.
@PressSec Good holy Moses on a popsicle stick. Not only have you lost all credibility but you have transcended in to a total lying bitch. Just like yer daddy.
@rulajebreal Please...anybody who is tired of hearing about Hillary/DNC funding the Steele dossier, this is identical. Call out anybody who won‚Äôt either condemn both or let them each skate.
Credit given where credit is due. She nailed this...and in such a 90‚Äôs kinda way.  Absolutely great parody. Weird Al would be proud. Or jealous.  Trump should‚Äôve paid more attention in school &amp; less out of pocket to cover unscrupulous deals. 	#Trump #TreasonWeasel https://t.co/ZRwXImVutE
@AndTheBandAides @TraceyTroutle @realDonaldTrump Absolutely, unequivocally, fucking brilliant. The video...not #Trump.
@nikky_onthemoon Would you please send this to the idiot in the Presidency?
@JimKuther @realDonaldTrump Spoken like a true Christian hypocrite - looks the other way as long as your politics are met. You‚Äôre a true hypocrite.
@Trumptweets2020 @JimKuther @JimKuther what about Codeofvets? Why would you allow anybody, regardless of position, to denigrate a vet, especially one of McCain‚Äôs character? You‚Äôre a fucking hypocrite sheep who hides behind the mantle of a ‚ÄúChristian.‚Äù Laughable. You a truly despicable hypocrite of a person.
@JimKuther @YouTube Hardly. It has long been true that special counsels do not release ongoing info. Though I‚Äôm sure you were ok when the exact opposite happened during Clinton, soooo...your partisanship over law is perilously obvious. You‚Äôre another fucking alt right lunatic sheep.
@JimKuther @17Storm_ @FBI You truly are a moron. Knowing that a) many of the items on the list have been debunked, b) others are completely out of context, &amp; c) the FBI &amp; ISIS? Um...you‚Äôre just fucking nutted in the head. Stop being spoonfed what you WANT to hear &amp; open your eyes. You‚Äôre a sheep.
@imthe420nerd @realDonaldTrump Please see a recent @GOP tweet.
@chuckwoolery It‚Äôs because people no longer think you‚Äôre relevant, and they‚Äôre tired of your conspiracy theories &amp; crazy talk. Please go live under a rock. That might be more interesting that what you discuss now.
@NRA @AnnualMeetings Good lord...the NRA‚Äôs day‚Äôs are numbered, and their ‚Äúleadership‚Äù sees it. Fuck You NRA...FUCK YOU. And I‚Äôm a total 2A supporter.
@seanspicer You‚Äôre an idiot with no credibility. You‚Äôve sowed your seeds on this one you lying piece of shit. Spineless, zero-integrity, suck-up, &amp; purveyor of lies. Go to hell.
@LyndaCulver Please tell me why you have refused to push for further action against Nick Miccarelli. Or are you putting party before what is right, by protecting a rapists.
@Meuser4Congress @joinkurtmasser @realScottWagner @RepScottPerry @SenatorFolmer @FrankRyanCPA Please tell me why you refuse to discipline Nick Miccarelli, or are you just that hard up to protect a rapist in the state House?  You owe the people an answer.
@augieray @JackPosobiec @JeffBezos You‚Äôre an idiot, @augieray. What CEO wouldn‚Äôt do what‚Äôs best for his company? He has rolled out more aid &amp; assistance based philanthropy than most could ever dream of. You‚Äôre out of line, w/ no context, or just have a distaste for big business. Either way, you haven‚Äôt a clue.
@JackPosobiec That is as dumb a statement as you‚Äôve made. Idiot.
@JackPosobiec Uh...this ain‚Äôt news, friend. She openly discussed this when first going public, as did Avenatti.
@CurtisCBallII1 @Batcrab8818 @MamaBear64 @Tombosley187 @ladyred1956 @Brasilmagic Once again...of which YOU are the one deciding what is ‚Äúcool‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúopen-minded.‚Äù  That‚Äôs pretty egotistical &amp; actually is antithetical to what you think you‚Äôre saying.  The more you write, the less you say.
@Batcrab8818 @Tombosley187 @CurtisCBallII1 @ChurchofSatan @MamaBear64 @ladyred1956 @Brasilmagic No...he needs to stay out of other peoples‚Äô ‚Äúmorality‚Äù &amp; stop deciding what anyone other than himself should project. It is not for him to say how I or anyone should act, feel, or interpret. THAT is where he crossed the line...deciding that he is the arbiter of interpretation.
@CurtisCBallII1 @MamaBear64 @Tombosley187 @ladyred1956 @Brasilmagic Wait...what happened to ‚ÄúIntolerant of Intolerance?‚Äù Do you have any clue what Satanism is? And let me get this straight...you put condition on freedom? That all is fine EXCEPT Satanism? You‚Äôre the textbook definition of religious hypocrisy @curtiscballll1. 	#ChristianHypocrisy
@Janice_Resist @CurtisCBallII1 As well as other black people. If you‚Äôre gonna tell history, tell it properly. It wasn‚Äôt a grand white vs black conspiracy.  Blacks also enslaved blacks. Whites and blacks then enslaved Latinos &amp; South Americans. Lots of ugliness, but tell it like it was, not how you perceive.
@RealJamesWoods You‚Äôve got to me kidding. The EXACT same tactics you call out Democrats for, were hallmarks of the GOP for the previous administration. Both sides are crooked, you‚Äôre just too fucking boot-licked to see it.
@caramastrey @Hippenstiel28 @ChurchofSatan @HeatherHeight @davescustomxxx NO Satanist is a pedophile. Not if he/she abides.
@Hippenstiel28 @ChurchofSatan @HeatherHeight @davescustomxxx @Rleuthold2 Sure. I‚Äôm down! 	Appreciate the interview and there is not ‚Äúmad/upset/etc‚Äù on my end. Merely pointing out an inaccuracy.
@Kris_Sacrebleu Yes, but the same can be said for the looney bin on the far right. Sadly.
@MEPFuller ‚ÄúSuppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself.‚Äù - Mark Twain
@OfficialJonZal Are you kidding? Most of the alt-right and far right despise her. Any Britebart article‚Äôs comment section yields the hate for ‚ÄúJavanka,‚Äù as they espouse. Nobody is turning on Mueller for this. I‚Äôm surprised anybody takes her seriously.
@Hippenstiel28 @ChurchofSatan @HeatherHeight @davescustomxxx I appreciate the interview but I must correct you. You comment that ‚Äúand people with disabilities can‚Äôt consent,‚Äù which is patently untrue. I am disabled, as is Warlock @Rleuthold2 but each of us, as well as many disabled people, can DEFINITELY consent. Hell, I consent now!
@ChurchofSatan And just to be clear, what in the actual fuck?
@ChurchofSatan Wait...I‚Äôm confused...@realDonaldTrump is a people?
@lauferlaw You won the interwebs today, sir.  	#BestestComment
@LaurenWern Oh...I‚Äôm sure in his own twisted head, he is in the right. I call it gaslighting. Hmmm...remind you of any other (horrid) person currently in office?
@pattonoswalt @NBCAPBio Best new show on the tube, yo. 	#APBio
@SenBillNelson @RepRichmond @RepDarrenSoto I haven‚Äôt read the proposal, but I hope it includes satisfactory completion of parole and/or probation, and includes lifetime bans for sexual offenders on the registry.
@krassenstein Not a truer statement exists on Twitter. He, once, was ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Mayor,‚Äù during that dark time, but has transcended in to as much of a ‚Äúlying swamp monster‚Äù as any in DC. His mere presence, now, means dishonesty is afoot...and more than ever. Scary.
@KamalaHarris Money? What money? We are in debt up to our kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids‚Äô eyeballs. Those might seem like nobel goals, but we MUST reign in spending!

@SanDiegoGoth @FoxNews @POTUS It‚Äôs likely he would not take the advice of someone who can‚Äôt spell. Just sayin.
@FoxNews @POTUS Ya. Senility will do that.
@TheRickWilson I wondered the same thing.
@KYEducator2018 @adamgoldmanNYT @NatashaBertrand Impeachment is no biggy if the Senate won‚Äôt do their job, which I have no confidence for.
@CNN Then why is every single one different, while claiming to be the most accurate? THAT‚ÄôS why we don‚Äôt trust polls. That, and the juxtaposition of each of you calling out the others as inaccurate. Just sayin.
@SaysHummingbird GOOD!!! Excellent vid on YouTube about him and his family, &amp; the radicalization of the right. I hope he gets the max. 		https://t.co/DP65ZLaApb
@SebGorka @JohnBrennan You are such a fucking tool, it is incredible.
@MortuaryReport @BlueShieldCA Such bullshit. I was told a couple of months back, by my pain mgmt doc, that they would be decreasing all their patients‚Äô pain meds. That, like your situation, is like admitted malpractice - ie...‚Äùwe‚Äôve been overprescribing these for years &amp; we‚Äôre gonna fix it by taking them.‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump Dude...your use of tenses is abhorrent. 	JUST	LIKE	YOU!
@AC360 You handled that tool like a three-handed mechanic.
@megelison @outseide Gosh, if it‚Äôs anything like shoegaze, I‚Äôm down!		Carry on ladies...carry on. 	;)
@BilMitchellvii @TeaPainUSA @DineshDSouza Hardly. I‚Äôm a conservative, yet even I can admit Trump is over his head on this one. I have no facts to support an opinion either way as to whether he ‚Äúcolluded,‚Äù but he has definitely obstructed. AND...both Jared &amp; Ivanka will be inducted. Maybe not by Mueller but mark my words.
@LouiseBagshawe @911CORLEBRA777 @karmaatwrk @adamgoldmanNYT @EricLiptonNYT @deanbaquet @KellyannePolls What I want to know is, how can Trump‚Äôs tweets NOT be used as part of an obstruction case?
@alanalda Me.  5 spinal reconstructions, single dad who raised two kids alone, math &amp; music educated, and leader of the pack through the darkest hours of despair.
@benjaminwittes @steve_vladeck Precedent appears more than substantiated. Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224, w/ support by Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681.		Trump will, as usual, fight it until he is dead or cornered. Eventually, he will be forced to talk &amp; he‚Äôll spin it as if he had intended to all along.
@CarolForden @SLSmith000 @benjaminwittes @steve_vladeck Ohhhhhh...one can only hope.
@nategowdy What a complete moron. If that‚Äôs not irony, I don‚Äôt know what is.
@DKFMTracks A true classic, which never gets old, and still holds up.
@BuzzFeedNews It was Lebron.
Seriously? If this is actually being used, then it is tantamount to fraud (that‚Äôs likely not the correct term). This is EXACTLY why I left the @GOP.  I have zero confidence that any politician is truly working in the best interest of his/her constituents. https://t.co/12QY2G6IKt
@MollyJongFast Wouldn‚Äôt getting the NPP I fer that someone aided in the peace process AND did it in a peaceful way? I.e. not bullying &amp; name calling. Personally, I believe Moon Jae-in is the one to be commended &amp; recognized.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Hardly. It‚Äôs all spelled out clearly in Rosenstein‚Äôs orders. You are clearly taking a partisan approach, as so many are, and yet you have ZERO idea what Mueller actually has or does not have. You‚Äôre looking desperate, man.
I think I love you, @batlaw5502.		Yup...definitely smitten. https://t.co/3QpQIbeWqU
@AnnieLinskey @benpershing Ugh. A Warren nomination is a sure-fire loss to Trump. He‚Äôs a maniac &amp; a menace to democracy, but Warren is not strong enough, nor will she garner any (well, not enough) of the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù to overtake Trump. And that is sad as fuck.
@benpershing @EricLiptonNYT Of course it is. The lobbying laws have never been about anything other than finding ways for folks to get around them. There is NOTHING about them that benefits the whole of the American public. All lobbying should be prohibited. Period. It‚Äôs the only way to be consistent.
@stephenasmith @Raptors They collapsed in the 4th, that‚Äôs what happened. Not due to talent, but inexperience. They stopped BALLIN‚Äô &amp; gave Lebron just enough wiggle room to keep the Cavs focused. Definitely inexperience.
@chloebennet @VanLathan @people Man...all I can do is applaud you, @VanLathan. As Americans it is our inalienable right to speak our mind, as @kanyewest did. That said, you NAILED it w/ eloquence (&amp; respect). I can‚Äôt say anything more than that, as you did us ALL, white/black/brown/etc, proud.		Thank you!
@TeaPainUSA So much irony to this, it hurts.
@OrinKerr I suppose, as private companies, they can write their contracts &amp; terms of service however they wish, as long as all privacy terms are spelled out in agreements. I think it‚Äôs a bit shady, but folks need to read these terms &amp; choose to use, or not. Puts the onus on the customer.
@HuffPost Fucking ludicrous. Judging all men as identical in nature is no less egregious than the years of screaming I‚Äôve heard from women about the exact thing. Can‚Äôt have the cake and eat it too.
@Tom_Antonov @Mikeknightsiraq @EtatMajorFR @CJTFOIR Man...I wonder what the decibels are when those suckers launch payload ordinance.  Bet it ain‚Äôt a small number.
When will we learn? If gvt wasn‚Äôt so big, maybe we wouldn‚Äôt need this kind of reliance from others...&amp; how many millions are spent on aid to other countries? I‚Äôm ALWAYS down to help those in need, but not at the expense of our own citizens. https://t.co/22SBONI5Rq
@DavidShuster @David4SenateCA @BernieSanders @i24NEWS_EN Why do I have a hard time believing those ‚Äúpolls‚Äù...
@brettbjj_brett @ThomasEWoods Yeh...classic of the leftists...current on the right.
@vinyljunkiesco Could not agree more. We have entered the age of narcissism.
@dbongino The possible/alleged crimes, in some cases, specifically involve Trump, so they are synonymous. The latitude then granted by Rosenstein allows for an even WIDER net to be cast after the direct allegations against Trump are investigated. He‚Äôs toast.
@HamillHimself I can‚Äôt tell you how excited I am about your excitement over this!	#HeStartedIt
I detest what looks like a ‚Äúleak‚Äù of documents &amp; supposed questions Mueller wishes to ask Trump, but to see the right come out &amp; make assumptions as to Mueller‚Äôs path &amp; assume they know how he is interested in Trump is simply asinine.  Something is coming, nobody knows what. https://t.co/t5DdyAYc5U
@MAGA_butterfly @RealOmarNavarro @GOP Fool? Hardly. I educate from the left &amp; from the right. Any good conservative has full understanding of why he/she has his/her views. Education &amp; knowledge allow for only those without, to be noted as a fool...the category for which you represent well. Bye now.
@MAGA_butterfly @RealOmarNavarro @GOP I agree. So why are you? I‚Äôve been a conservative dissenter for many years. Never taken a dime from the left, never met anyone, never had an offer. Most of us are just regular folk who are fed up with lies and disinformation.  Kinda like what you‚Äôre spewing.
@nytmike It bothers me that these questions leaked. More bothersome is that since sources are protected, the only thing public can do is speculate, which means more divisive (and separatist) assumptions. PLEASE shed light so the far left &amp; far right‚Äôs speculation will be quashed.
@MAGA_butterfly @RealOmarNavarro Good holy Moses on a popsicle stick. Why is it that any time someone disagrees with a @gop candidate, the rights believes they are Soros-paid?  If this is truly believed, then the idiocy in America has exponentially grown in recent years. Truly moronic.
@mycarebear1 @RealOmarNavarro Just like the right. They‚Äôre ALL crooked. Nobody takes political representation seriously anymore. We see through ALL the lies &amp; hate. No more derision, no more lies, no more slander. Elected officials represent their ENTIRE district, not just those who voted yes. 	#BeBetter
@HBErica @RealOmarNavarro See? You‚Äôre getting the same message from others. PROFESSIONALISM not DERISION. California will not vote in a mini Trump. You need to change your stripes, Tiger, or you will walk away empty handed.
@RealOmarNavarro One last thing...is the article that meathead posted true? Are/were you ever convicted for ANYTHING related to said article? I will assume silence = guilt (in this case only), as I‚Äôm addressing you respectfully and as a Californian. 	#BeBetter
@RealOmarNavarro Be better. 	Be a better politician. 	Be a better representative. 	Be a better human. 		Forget the haters &amp; focus on the issues, and damn it man...stop obsessing over #MaxineWaters. She‚Äôs not worth it. Then again, from what we‚Äôre learning daily, your campaign is DOA. 	#BeBetter
@RealOmarNavarro California deserves a ‚Äútougher‚Äù sort of leadership, but we will not elect anybody who derides a majority of his constituents. 		And FWIW, we are conservatives...not liberals. We want tougher laws &amp; better accountability, but not at the expense of tolerance &amp; professionalism.
@RealOmarNavarro So far, I‚Äôve recruited a (growing) team of people from 3 counties who feel as I do. While some (also) agree w/ your ideologies, they have grown tired of this non-representative behavior. We are reaching over 1200 NEW voters every day and speaking about your conduct.
@RealOmarNavarro ...and are obsessed with what what someone else says &amp; does, opposed to talking about YOU, the issues, &amp; how you will fix them. 		I am ACTIVELY working in my community as a voice against you, due to your lack of ability to take the high road &amp; act as a representative for all CA.
@RealOmarNavarro Man...you are truly NOT what CA needs. I actually agree with many of your policies &amp; ideas, but you lost my vote because of all this horrible rhetoric. Who the fuck cares what some no-name meathead thinks? Talk less about Maxine &amp; more about YOU!  But you failed that, and...
@RealJamesWoods Well, if you‚Äôve not yet sold all your CA properties, leave. It‚Äôs pretty simple.
@RealJamesWoods Kinda like you being ‚Äúsmart.‚Äù	Cheers.
@RepMimiWalters Sooo...apparently u haven‚Äôt seen the new issue of Newsweek.  You know...the one where @marcorubio trashes the tax bill &amp; says it is only beneficial for corporations, not avg Americans &amp; small biz?  Yeh...that one. You might wanna rethink your rhetoric- you can‚Äôt fool us anymore.
@RealJamesWoods Wow. I‚Äôm thinking this may be more about a crush, considering you can‚Äôt get Obama out of your head. He‚Äôs been gone almost a year and a half. MOVE FORWARD!
@RealJamesWoods Dude...why is it that you‚Äôre are so obsessed with Obama? He‚Äôs GONE! And for almost 18 months. It‚Äôs loooong time to move FORWARD!
@GovMikeHuckabee @IsraeliPM Dude...now almost two years in the past. Wake up you idiot.
@RWPMinnesota So glad to hear you are running. I wish I lived in your boundaries. Best of luck.
@MaryLouBolger @joncoopertweets Ya think?	üëç
@satanicpsalms SCOTUS already ruled on gay marriage. Unless it‚Äôs going to be reverted, this law will be overturned, IF it passes.

@joncoopertweets This is good news. He‚Äôs an odd bird, but anybody who bucks Trump is good for me. Well, not anybody, but Painter is one smart cookie, and serves Americans. Not just a President.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Oh yeh...don‚Äôt forget the nomination for SCOTUS prior to Gorsuch...almost A YEAR! 	Oh wait...
@themichaelnero Indeed.
@Scaramucci You‚Äôre a tool. How could escalating any domestic ‚Äúwar‚Äù be good for the country? Division only makes us weak. That‚Äôs a strategy as old as time. If Trump was a true leader, he would be working to bring us together, not divide us further. Idiot.
@mflynnJR Nothing‚Äôs even happened yet, you Tool.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre a tool.
@ReaganBattalion Yup. I HATE Trump‚Äôs rhetoric, but anyone who shares my view, yet indulges in the same rhetoric, but against Trump, is a hypocrite. I hate it all. I wish we could return to civility in gvt. At least then we could hate them ONLY for their actions, not their words.
@MortuaryReport @DerekTheVet Great photos of each of you! Cheers!
@mflynnJR Idiot? Um...I‚Äôm not a Catholic, and I believe the Catholic Church is one of the biggest rackets in history, but the Pope is no more an idiot than you.  Actually, you‚Äôre a YUGE one. He‚Äôs still the Pope. Just because he doesn‚Äôt advocate war, doesn‚Äôt make him anything, but the Pope.
@GOP Having officiall resigned from the @gop last week, I am a testimony that not only will I not forget the last almost 30 years as a conservative voter, I will DEFINITELY not forget that come November. If you think this story makes Dems look bad, you need to look in the mirror.
@AmbientAirwaves Very cool. Reminds me, a slight bit, like Stupid Cosmonaut. Thanks.
@LaurenWern Of all his cabinet members, she is the least qualified, and needs to go...FAST.
@SebGorka @JohnBrennan Give it a rest man. There was no threat or even the hint of one. But I sure wish there would have been. Stay tuned...
@RealJamesWoods At least the current interim mayor is pissing off a lot of people, spending some $$, and cleaning these areas up. He might not last in office, but there‚Äôll be fewer junkies shooting up on the streets.

@Rleuthold2 @nearsiighted @PrincessMirror7 @AlexisBlazeXXX Yeeees?
@amychozick I had been curious about this take on the Clinton machine, but after reading the number of factual errors, albeit small(ish) ones, I will NOT purchase the book. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúboycott,‚Äù per se, especially in the ‚Äúboycott everything‚Äù era, but a choice not to spend $ on SOME truths.
@RameshPonnuru IF? Um...sir...the @gop IS ALREADY the party of Trump.	Kinda like a kindergarten party for the class bully...only the most scared show up. Impeachment wouldn‚Äôt elicit a circling of the wagons...they‚Äôre already there, some just quieter than others.
@crazygirl13 @ImGrammaBamma @MikeScarcella I choose myself, and want Trump out.
@SaysHummingbird @JenLuvsMonkeys I obviously have no proof of Kush‚Äôs biz dealings, as I‚Äôm just a dude, but every ounce of my gut tells me he‚Äôs up to his armpits in illegality &amp; shady deals.
@jk_rowling Divided in half? Welcome to America.
@ImGrammaBamma @MikeScarcella It‚Äôs bad news, as he keeps letting small pieces of info out. Everything he says &amp; does can be used against him. These little tidbits contradict past statements, even ones told to the FBI.
@thrumpenblitzen @MikeScarcella Come on. I can‚Äôt stand the guy, and wish he was 6 ft under, but with that much wealth &amp; business I‚Äôm sure he has many lawyers: loads of Biz guys from various areas, personal, divorce, &amp; who knows how many speciality lawyers. Only mid class &amp; below has ONE LAWYER (well, you know).
@Karenkn7 @MikeScarcella Um, she already did. And appointed a Special Master.
Absolutely incredible. Bummer, only this snippet exists. When I was a child, I was ‚Äúthat kid‚Äù who wished to become an astronaut.

@nycDSA And contrary to what MS states, there was ZERO violence and every person in the video remained seated. It‚Äôs sad when people don‚Äôt own up to their own faults, and then lie on top of it. Oh that‚Äôs right...he‚Äôs on the far right. They don‚Äôt do that. [rolls eyes]
@SuperKamiDenday @nycDSA @timtakestime Tolerance for Nazi rhetoric is not heroic, but the antithesis of such.  Tolerance for a man with admitted hatred toward large swaths of ppl is not acceptable. 		Asking for tolerance for a man who openly has no tolerance is abhorrent. You are truly a moron.
@JeffreyGuterman @PressSec Well...at least 58 people disagree with you, and since the 58th is @potus, and people seem to want him in office, there is zero to be done. Trump‚Äôs brain dead followers aren‚Äôt going anywhere, which means nothing you can say will change that.
@PattyMurray Never gonna happen. @SenMajLdr has lost his understanding of ‚Äúcountry over party,‚Äù is too afraid of irking Trump in anything but a petty way, and generally has zero chutzpah. Just look at the number of votes this session. He‚Äôs a coward and someone has dirt on him.
@RepSusanDavis Never gonna happen.  @SenMajLdr has his head so far in to Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúparty over country‚Äù philosophy that he doesn‚Äôt have the xutzpah to do something that would irk Trump too much. He needs to be voted out. Look at this Senate‚Äôs vote count. Abhorrent.

@RealMuckmaker Good holy Moses on a popsicle stick, I cannot stand this woman. Even looking at her makes my stomach crawl.

@SenTomCotton ...you should be ashamed.

@SenFeinstein As Ranking Member of the @senjudiciary I would hope so. Don‚Äôt back down on this one.

@MichaelAvenatti I didn‚Äôt know you were also a composer. 15 minuets, eh?

@Boxerworks @NRATV @JoyAnnReid @DLoesch Reported.		Have a day, douchebag. 	And for the love of everything, please learn the difference beyond  ‚Äúyour‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre.‚Äù	Fucking idiot.
@NRATV @JoyAnnReid @DLoesch Good lord you‚Äôre an awful cunt &amp; a terrible orator. I don‚Äôt care for Reid but THIS IS WHY people think the NRA has stopped acting in its capacity as an educational organization &amp; overstepped 501(c)3.  Please tell me how this supports the NRA‚Äôs mission, gun ed, &amp; tax exempt status
@nprmusic Yet another problem for those in medical needs of opiates. I have long contended that pharmacists, while educated properly, become lax as ‚Äúpill fillers‚Äù &amp; forget their diagnostic duties as well as contraindication education. They (some) are a part of the problem as well.
@DanielLaw1998 Are you fucking kidding me? Are you truly that out of touch or just such an egoist that YOUR reality is the only acceptable one? I‚Äôm guessing that due to your immaturity (ie age) you just haven‚Äôt learned to think beyond your own needs. You truly are troglodytic scum.
@starcrosswolf @krissyistormy Have you ever considered that a Russian national has no legal obligation to talk to Mueller? Typical blind follower...not even intelligent enough to understand beyond his own egoist needs &amp; red sight. Idiot. I hate Hillarty as much as the next conservative, but come on man.
@RealJamesWoods Asshole
@GOP @gop- as of now, I officially quit the party. I don‚Äôt care how much of the policy wing I believe in, but you have become the party of Trump &amp; lost your core values. 		Consider this my resignation, &amp; know that for the first time in years, I will not vote for GOP members. Fuck You!
@Erics481969 @YETICoolers Actually, even if every single NRA member stopped supporting Yeti, that derivative quantity of Yeti sales would be extremely small. Now, the broader integrated residual of non-NRA members‚Äô Yeti purchases would be much much higher. Bottom line, they don‚Äôt need the NRA.

@LanieLou5 @ElderLansing @michellmybell1 @POTUS She‚Äôs white, and didn‚Äôt choose to ‚Äúsell baby parts.‚Äù  You can‚Äôt lump all people in one boat, for ANY issue.
@LanieLou5 @ElderLansing @michellmybell1 @POTUS Um...statistics. Whether you‚Äôre pro-choice or pro-life statistics tell why clinics are where they are. My relative was brutally raped for hours, only to find she was pregnant. She couldn‚Äôt carry to term, by emotional choice. I stand by her right to choose. &amp; she ain‚Äôt poor.
@Rleuthold2 @virtualouija @AlexisBlazeXXX @OpheliaRainXXX @nearsiighted @RamAbbalah19 Woohoo. I mean...hail Satan and all that stuff.
@ElderLansing This is so over-the-top untrue. I‚Äôm a conservative, yet find this rhetoric abhorrent.  Not a single ad, marketing ploy, or other voice has ENCOURAGED killing of anyone. Being pro-choice is not ‚Äúencouraging someone to kill‚Äù. Please provide proof of the ‚Äúencouraged killings.‚Äù

@ARmastrangelo I‚Äôm sure a good chunk of @NRA members can‚Äôt afford a Yeti cooler, so it‚Äôll all be fine. Carry on.
@ChurchofSatan It IS hilarity at its finest. The irony is that the CoS has one of the best FAQ pages of any similar organization.

@RepDeSantis And you don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre not watching the @GOP complicity in Trump‚Äôs systematic destruction of the office of POTUS? We are watching you &amp; your colleagues, &amp; as a frustrated conservative I can tell you that I‚Äôm sick of party before country. You should be very worried.

@Trumpnado2016 @nedprice @lilyhnewman That we might never know. The only thing I know for sure is that IT APPEARS he did nothing to fix the incorrect claims. I detest Trump, but I do NOT want to make assumptions. They need to fry ‚Äúby the book‚Äù not by contrived issue.

@JHazlette @thehill He wasn‚Äôt president for 29 of those years. It‚Äôs a well-known fact he didn‚Äôt coin the term. I detest the man, but these are the type of fake stories that destroy the cause.

@Trumpnado2016 @nedprice Yes...but it‚Äôs not as if he maintains his Wiki page.
@CharlieDaniels @jillibeenz1 You could replace ‚ÄúHillary‚Äù with ‚ÄúDonald‚Äù and the sentence actually makes more sense. Yeesh...I detest them both.
@jillibeenz1 @thehill @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @RealJamesWoods Yes...because tagging the biggest bullies on the web makes you look tough. Actually, knowing that they likely didn‚Äôt even notice the tag makes it all worth it. Carry on troll. Carry on.
@LIMPHY @thehill Um...hardly. The term ‚Äúwinter/southern White House‚Äù was coined by Marjorie Post (ie Post Cereal) in the 50/60‚Äôs when she owned it. She actually tried to have it officially coined as such, prior to her death. She ‚Äúwilled‚Äù Mar-A-Lago to the U.S. in the 70‚Äôs &amp; Trump bought it next.

@DrDenaGrayson @lauferlaw @counterchekist With all the talk about opioids one thing i hear nothing of is how good they are for those who need them. I‚Äôve had many spinal reconstructions, leaving me with massive pain &amp; only 40% nerve function. Without opioids I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move &amp; all I hear abt is taking them away.
@NWPinPDX Then why is the GOP circling the wagons - as stumps &amp; financially - having spent tons of dough on commercials, videos, &amp; websites devoted to discrediting Comey? Seems like they‚Äôre fighting harder than ever for the #TreasonWeasel.
@SKIbumfromAL @tedlieu @NRA What in hells fuck are you blabbering on about? This is pitiful at best. Crawl back to your mom‚Äôs basement and warm up the bed until she can join you.
@FoxNews @KimStrassel @Comey Wait...you mean like...being a little skeptical of someone so ingermane as Trump, after a lifetime of legal work, should NOT raise red flags? Guilt or no guilt, it is likely any career law person would have done exactly as Comey did &amp; recount words in documents. I do that daily.
@GOP It is a sad, sad day when the official Twitter account of the Republican Party, of which I am registered, takes the time and energy to send this, instead of...say...policy issues? This is not the Republican Party I used to know.
@FoxNews I find this extremely difficult to believe. You do mean TEXAS Texas...the state, right? Not the name of another Trump mistress?
@JuliaLOwens @coyle_marshall @DonaldJTrumpJr When someone as public as he is loathed by so many tens of millions of people, what can you expect? BTW, did you chastise him for going after the families and children he has? I‚Äôm gonna guess that‚Äôs a ‚ÄòNo‚Äô.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ironic...that‚Äôs EXACTLY what voters will tell the @gop come November. That, and what‚Äôs written in your divorce papers.
@AviAhvee @7718_Rutherford I hate the guy, but deduction by using Tweets is all circumstantial. Have you never posted a photo a few hours after something occurred or ingratiated anything to make it look bigger &amp; better than it actually was (ie Trump‚Äôs MO)? Just sayin.
@FoxNews @AriFleischer Right...because you‚Äôre a fly on Mueller‚Äôs wall.
@Jamesbeauparla2 Uh...I have far less than 500, and I‚Äôm fairly certain I‚Äôm not a bot.

There is so much info being propositioned from the WH that it is hard to keep up with the constant evolution of stories &amp; scandals.

@MichaelAvenatti It‚Äôs actually quite silly at this point. Nobody seems to care that he had sex w/ your client, &amp; based on stats it appears a majority believe he DID do it. What IS important is any criminality &amp; at this point the only way to do that is by due process &amp; a speedy trial, not lies.
@Eddie69G Yes, and yes. There is not a shred of integrity in the administration, &amp; even those who were once looked upon as Patriots (eg Mattis, Kelley, et al) are nothing but sycophants and loyalists who put party above country. It‚Äôs sickening.
@rbdoeker @PrincessBravato @ryangrim @AlexEmmons How is this not conspiracy and/or treason? Serious question.
@MSNBC @mitchellreports @PeteWilliamsNBC This seems EXTREMELY soon for action so steep. Not saying it‚Äôs not called for, but with so many diff independent investigations going on I can‚Äôt understand why they wouldn‚Äôt wait until more info is substantiated.
@aliasvaughn @lawrewnce Um...YEAAAAHHH!!!!
@OutnumberedFNC @TomiLahren Ohhhh...I sure do. #Trump SCREAMS ‚ÄúNo collusion,‚Äù &amp; while he might have had no direct connection to Russia, #Mueller has definitely uncovered some odious crimes connecting Trump‚Äôs people to illegal acts. The investigation must finish, no matter the outcome.

Second, it‚Äôs a subjective matter, so your opinion matters not in an opinion I shared. 	Lastly, I made no generalized or blanket statement. 	#GoHome

@KirbyYork5 @Comey @GOP First, I never claimed otherwise. 	Second, are you saying that ZERO of the #Trump constituency has less than a high school ed? I made observations that are factual, saying nothing about me (or any damn security clearance...random). AND...I thanked a man for a lifetime of service.
@FunArtAndDesign @Comey You just won the interwebs for the most completely idiotic, troglodytic statement that was EVER stated. Then again, it was a little hard to follow the 1st grade scratchings, but I got it. 	üèÜüèÜüèÜ
@Comey Good for you, @Comey. Regardless of unceremonial conspiracy theorists (and hand-to-mouth @GOP ) and haters, many of whom likely have less than a high school education, keep doing what you feel is right. Few people w/ influence stand up to #Trump, &amp; you did. Thank you &amp; good luck.
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper What? #Trump mixing &amp; conflating his Russia statements? Golly...he wouldn‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm sooooo surprised. Gee willickers...I can hardly believe this.

@NYDailyNews @secupp @seanhannity This article is part of why people on the right are pissed. While I DESPISE @seanhannity, he has yet to be found guilty of anything. I admit, the optics of him being tied to @MichaelCohen212 are bad, but come on...he hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong (that we know of...or, yet).
@DLoesch Boy...it‚Äôs as if you wait for unfortunate fatalities in order to add your ‚Äúquip‚Äù. No less than 4 recent instances of such, &amp; your first response is to add something snarky rather than adding something re: the fact that someone‚Äôs daughter or son was lost. You truly are depraved.

@seanhannity As if... https://t.co/rPkuHTprWr
@TomFitton Mueller is much smarter than to hinge an entire case on one person‚Äôs testimony. He was appointed to do a job &amp; cannot be faulted for that. If his evidence is bogus then he‚Äôll be held accountable. That said, it doesn‚Äôt look like Yates was investigated thoroughly enough.

3] The longer these controversies swirl, he feels in control, but once they cease (if ever) his lack of agenda (esp foreign pol) will be sorely on display. This man needs to be voted out &amp; held accountable for his divisive words &amp; actions. 		#TreasonWeasel #Trump #Russia #Syria
2] Hiding behind the chaos allows him an ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù that he is being hindered from doing what he wants; it allows him an (perceived) out; it gives him a feeling that laying blame on others is acceptable, all while refusing to take responsibility for his words &amp; actions.
1] It simply boggles the mind that so much chaos exists &amp; continually arises in the #Trump admin. My opinion is that he doesn‚Äôt want any of this to go away.  If there was no chaos, EVERY American would see that he has ZERO strategy for the long term. He hides behind the chaos.
@JohnnyPummel @dbongino Yeh...being a life-long Republican in high profile jobs definitely introduced him to a number of liars: Trump, McCabe, Sessions, Nu√±es, Clinton(s), any Trump campaign manager, and a host of other D‚Äôs &amp; R‚Äôs.  Washington IS the swamp...both sides. And STILL IS.

@Free_Our_Net So, a private company can‚Äôt do what it wishes, even if risking lawsuit? I don‚Äôt use FB, but it‚Äôs a free service.  They can edit how they choose. If they‚Äôve done something illegal, they‚Äôll pay for it; if immoral but not illegal, then people may choose to discontinue use.
@StayWoke_____ @lulu_says2 @PPVSRB Best tweet of the day. Wish it were so.
@PPVSRB I‚Äôm no lawyer, nor a fan of Trump (or his slimeball Cohen) but how is it legal for an uninvolved client of an attorney to be outed? The only possible explanation I reach is that the party must be involved. Otherwise I cannot see how this is legal. People pay lawyers for privacy.
@StefanMolyneux I‚Äôve been SCREAMING this since day one. Many Trump fans find him above fault &amp; skew rhetoric, values, &amp; even religious rites in support of him, as if admitting he made a mistake would mean he must be fired. We ALL make mistakes &amp; deserve criticism. Trump thrives on this process.
@EmpireExp @OANN @YouTube I care not about 2013. I care about now, &amp; THIS bombing (which I disagreed with).  As I noted, I will wait for facts from an independent investigation. I am not a political figure so need not worry about expediency forming my opinion. Be well &amp; let‚Äôs all hope 4 a better tomorrow.
@EmpireExp @OANN @YouTube Hey man...you have both my sympathy &amp; empathy, as it‚Äôs obvious you care about the situation. More my part, we merely must agree to disagree (in part). I will wait for independent verification before I form an opinion. Too soon &amp; too many people saying contrary things.
@jheustace @Telegraph Of fuck! I missed that lil ole ‚Äòk‚Äô... thanks @jheustace!!!	#ImANumbSkull
@TKOEd @sandy41253 This is TEH AWESOME! In a time of such pervasive negativity and abhorrent rhetoric &amp; division, it is truly wonderful to see a love of the game &amp; purity of sport.  Now if we could only pass this ideology &amp; passion to our political leaders, we might actually make progress.
@Johnny5024 @OANN @YouTube I wholeheartedly agree. It is TRULY hard to know who/what to believe any more. 		While I‚Äôm against increased gvt oversight &amp; regs, appointing truly independent investigators appears as something we will need more &amp; more as time passes. 		For Syria we need Intl indep investigation
@Telegraph ¬£86??? In the U.S. a drunk driver typically doesn‚Äôt get off with less than $5000 in costs. I‚Äôm DEFINITELY not saying we have all the answers, especially with an ethical mess of a President, but damn...¬£86?
@TitusNation I forgot how big of a @TitusNation fan I am.		Thank you Easter Bunny!	Bhack bhack!
@EmpireExp @OANN @YouTube And AGAIN, my ‚Äúlogic‚Äù bares no statement toward how the US should or shouldn‚Äôt handle it. Only that an article titled ‚Äú Evidence of no chemical attack‚Äù cannot be quantified by speaking w/ &lt;50 people. Every statement you‚Äôve made is followed by assumptions...a dangerous action
@EmpireExp @OANN @YouTube I‚Äôm not qualified to make an assessment especially w/ both MSM &amp; nMSM reporting that chemicals were both used &amp; not used.		AGAIN, let me spell it out for you w/ no insults (unless your use of them is necessity), my SOLE point is 50ppl is no proof either way. 		Further inv needed
@JeffreyGuterman And yes...I know it‚Äôs OW.
@JeffreyGuterman Don‚Äôt you mean - ‚ÄúWilly Wonka‚Äù?
@NoahCRothman That red phone must‚Äôve rang, with instructions coming from the other end.
@KenDilanianNBC @MaxBoot In all fairness, which @MaxBoot doesn‚Äôt do, @comey has no reason to act in a bipartisan way now that he is a private citizen. Just because Trump is POTUS doesn‚Äôt mean other leaders should look the other way when they believe issues are in play. JC handled it poorly and got fired.
@CharlesdeCharle @Betramobet @chuckwoolery 100% agree. On both sides. Your statement reminds me of the House Intel Committee ‚Äúfindings,‚Äù or should I say, a PORTION of the (partisan) Republican report. As a Republican, I‚Äôm embarrassed by that display of partisanship when such a demand for bipartisanship was needed.
@Johnny5024 @OANN @YouTube Please also note the title of the article.
@Johnny5024 @OANN @YouTube Of course it does, and I agree w/ your thinking. But to categorically assume someone‚Äôs political bent because of sad stupidity and being in 5th grade math is not a way to debate. Name calling &amp; divisiveness does nothing but muddy (or invalidate) a message.
@EmpireExp @OANN @YouTube Who is saying anything about belief or disbelief? I‚Äôve made ZERO assumptions of either only that quantifiable evidence is not found by interviewing &lt;50 people. 		You better head back to class. I can hear the 5th grade math bell ringing now! 		Better come at me w/ more than that
@jlmuhn41 @Comey Really? A lifelong Republican who served his state and county for most of his entire adulthood? He might have made fireable offenses but not out moral or ethical concerns, rather, poor handling of a nearly impossible situation.
@CLewandowski_ @HowieCarrShow Criticizing @Comey for not protecting the Boston Marathon? Ugh...he wasn‚Äôt in the job yet. This is truly laughable man. Truly laughable.
@EmpireExp @OANN @YouTube And if you truly believe that speaking to &lt;50 people qualifies as proof, you‚Äôre calling the wrong person an idiot, brainwashed moron. I‚Äôm a proud Conservative &amp; see this as poor reporting and holds up to no scientific, mathematical, or logical basis for proof. Wanna buy a duck?
@EmpireExp @OANN @YouTube Awesome. You have a good day in yours as well.
@ed_hooley @washtee @realDonaldTrump If that‚Äôs not a doctored video, I don‚Äôt know what is.
@RealCandaceO @washtee I don‚Äôt like these folks, but there is nothing in this video to illustrate any sort of thug or thuggishness.
@chuckwoolery While so many of the others, even conservative sites, have him much lower.		You know Chuck, it‚Äôs ok to support someone &amp; appreciate what they are doing &amp; still tell them to be better, especially as it pertains to rhetoric. Some policies are good, but he‚Äôs losing votes as a result
@washtee @BillOReilly And thank you for polite and respectful dialog. It goes a long way when people can peacefully &amp; respectfully disagree. No extra division, no name calling, just civil debate. Thank you.
@washtee @BillOReilly I FULLY agree w/ that.  I‚Äôm a libertarian, if you need a label, so my only dog in the fight is the one that makes our country stronger &amp; positions us for a future of success. 		That said, anybody who believes Trump‚Äôs mean &amp; nasty attacks on our own citizens is good might rethink.
@keeper_of_inns @SenCoryGardner @SenatorTimScott And our kids‚Äô kids‚Äô kids.
@brycetache WTF? Finally? Pundits, legislators, world leaders, educators, academics, law enforcement, medical practitioners, scientists, and US citizens have been saying THIS EXACT THING, &amp; as simply, since before the election.
@washtee @BillOReilly DISSENT is positive, as it is both constructive &amp;, as you say, brings issues to the forefront. Devisiveness is intended for hostility not progress. I agree w/ where I think you were going, but can no longer agree w/ such hateful &amp; flat-out mean &amp; embarrassing behavior from potus.
@MotherJones @kdrum Reachin a bit on this one guys.
@OANN @YouTube No no no.  Speaking to a handful of people, less than 50, is NOT evidence of NO chemical attack. Yeesh. Yeesh...talk about click bate and fake news.
@StandingBear122 @BillOReilly Well here‚Äôs one, &amp; the conservative area I live in seems to agree with me. May not be everyone, but he‚Äôs definitely lost some luster. Childish degradation, tariffs, spending our children‚Äôs children‚Äôs $$ in to lifelong national debt...these are all things Reps abhor &amp; he‚Äôs done
@CNNPolitics I can walk to the end of my driveway once...that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm (still) not disabled. He‚Äôs as immoral as they come.
@washtee @BillOReilly It‚Äôs not only Dems who are pissed. His policies are fine, his rhetoric and decisiveness are not.
@StandingBear122 @BillOReilly That, maybe, but there sure is a fuckload of Trump voters who would change their vote in a minute...even if only to ‚Äúnone of the above.‚Äù
@BillOReilly Um...hey Bill...there‚Äôs a reason for the defensive posture. It‚Äôs called guilt.
@RealJamesWoods Nope
@SebGorka @Comey Trump has long bullied people and either crushed them, paid them off, or had them in NDA‚Äôs. Government doesn‚Äôt run like that so he‚Äôs getting called out by more &amp; more people for his ways. Personally, I‚Äôm happy to see it. I wish more people would speak out.
@Emeraldluxury @realDonaldTrump Well said. Bravo my friend. 	Brah-voe.
@LarrySabato Unfortunately, either decision he made would have been the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù one. Knowingly NOT dispelling the information would have been just as damning for him, from across partisan lines, had Hillary won. He was fooked either way.
@axios Damn...that‚Äôs meaner than curb-stomping Mickey Mouse. Sadly, it‚Äôs as mean as it is true. Sorry Mickey...open up. 		#Trump #TreasonWeasel #VoteOutTrump #MickeyMouse #TrumpRussia #TrumpLies #MuellerTime #Comey #60Minutes
@ReaganBattalion @tedlieu Considering he represents a state that fully legalized marijuana, &amp; decriminalized it, he‚Äôs doing what is right for the state. There is no reliable evidence in existence saying marijuana does what YOU think it does. If you don‚Äôt like the science behind it, then that‚Äôs your prob.
@davidfrum @PrincessBravato That‚Äôs too heavy a comparison. Beer $$ &amp; its sworn protector are not lightly endowed. Let‚Äôs think of something less important...like billions being sucked from needed programs in order to overfund other less important programs...like, oh, I dunno...a multi-B tax cut for the rich.
@ChristianInst @KJVBaptist193 @realDonaldTrump Oh, I know. Too many folks, however, don‚Äôt think about the faults of humanity, &amp; hide behind Christianity. My gpa was a minister so I‚Äôve seen it all. Just like most politicians who live a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù life in front of the camera, only to hide behind it when tough times occur.
@d0td0tcircle @apexnerd @realDonaldTrump Sadly...REALLY sadly...if people don‚Äôt punch back, #Trump takes the silence as credence to his nihilist, egotistical, &amp; abhorrent rhetoric. He has forever marred the office of POTUS. 	#TreasonWeasel #ImpeachTrump
@KJVBaptist193 @ChristianInst @realDonaldTrump Christianity and ‚Äúthe lord‚Äù is responsible for more killing and death than any other religion in history. Trusting in ‚Äúthe lord,‚Äù if following your implication, means more killing &amp; more death will follow.
@TomthunkitsMind @GLSCHWALL New? How new?
@waltshaub @ezlusztig While I understand the premise, the logic doesn‚Äôt hold up. Breaching the norm is one of the most progressive ideologies known. Striving for more, for something better. SETTLING for a norm brings complacency. That said, #Trump is not now, &amp; will never be the norm. 	#TreasonWeasel
@funder explains his take. https://t.co/dAyHzmqjLJ
@realDonaldTrump Only in your book of lies &amp; narcism. Why can‚Äôt somebody stand up to you? You‚Äôre living in the past more &amp; more every single day. Real leaders learn from what becomes the past, they do not dwell. They look FORWARD at potential, &amp; position entities for growth, not pats on the back.
@chuckwoolery Why are you talking about the Clinton‚Äôs 18 months after the election? You‚Äôre helping keep the dialog alive. If #Trump, and people like you, would stop talkin about them, they would go away. None are in office, and the past keeps getting clearer every day.
@FoxNews Tell her to mail her cards to the White House, where the biggest bully in the world lives.

@EndDeportations @_Ben_Franklin1 Lame lame lame. There isn‚Äôt a pattern of Starbucks mistreating POC.  Not everything deserves diluting the ‚Äúboycott‚Äù message any further.

@ChuckE99 @Lew_Shepherd @NPR @NRA Nope...just yours.
@ChuckE99 @Lew_Shepherd @NPR Oh...I despise the @nra especially what they‚Äôve become, and I‚Äôve never owned a gun in my 45 years. I was just picking on your over the top egoism as you tried bashing some folks, so decided to chime in, especially since your statement was so unabashedly moronic.
@ChuckE99 @Lew_Shepherd @NPR Responsible [or irresponsible] and irrational are unrelated. Your sentence makes to sense. Besides, since these are defined by subjective means in individual people, your opinion matters NIL!
@mathematicsprof ...and computers can‚Äôt dream about finding ways to make the impossible become possible.

@MichaelAvenatti While I certainly have no proof of any wrongdoing on the part of @MichaelCohen212, much of the public perception is that he is a sleezebag who used his clients‚Äô ‚Äúpower‚Äù to muscle his way around the law &amp; intimidate people. Hopefully the jig is up &amp; he will be held responsible.
Ugh...the attorney for the POS @POTUS  will take the 5th Amend if/when questioned by @MichaelAvenatti. 		Is it me, or is the perception of this guy being a total &amp; complete scumbag slime ball true?		Personally, I think Cohen will be bent over, sans Crisco, and flip on #Trump. https://t.co/PNtwUkAv2B
@PoliticusSarah I despise this man w/ every fiber of my being, but come on...he didn‚Äôt ask Congressmen to change the laws. THIS is the type of tweet that only adds to his war on fake news &amp; false narratives. I want him gone as badly as anyone, but let‚Äôs do it the right way. Don‚Äôt go to his level
@JBMannix @seanmdav Yep.  All leches, leakers, and liars must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This includes #Trump.
@seanmdav ALL liars, leakers, and leches need to be punished to the maximum extent of the law. This includes #Trump.
@realDonaldTrump If true, it doesn‚Äôt come anywhere near your constant LIES LIES LIES. If McCabe lies under oath or deceived the American people in any way then he should be punished, just as YOU WILL BE when the #Mueller investigation is complete. 		#TrumpLies #TreasonWeasel #NoIntegriry #Lies
@MichaelAvenatti @MichaelAvenatti since you are not  directly involved in the #CohenFBIRaid, are you able to comment as to the legality of the raid? Trump allies say it was an illegal search &amp; seizure but for lay people, we don‚Äôt know the law surrounding the raid. 		WAS IT LEGAL, in your opinion?
@TomRtweets I was shocked to read this. It is irresponsible journalism, IMO. It‚Äôs bad enough we have a president who tweets about bombing (even though he blasted prev admin), but to discuss details is definitely a security issue.
@froomkin I don‚Äôt want it to be ‚Äúhuge‚Äù...I want it to be ‚ÄúYUGE.‚Äù
@MortuaryReport @canadiansuzanne Ditto. It was the mental steroids that I so regularly ‚Äúinjected.‚Äù  Though, I do miss the old days of $10 tickets - I‚Äôm old.
@canadiansuzanne @MortuaryReport Ditto. I went to over 1200 concerts prior to my disability, and have been to ONE since. The lack of accessible seats is pitiful (or they flat-out suck), and after so many spinal reconstructions, I can‚Äôt stand for even a fraction of an event. I feel ya sister.
@realDonaldTrump This rhetoric is abhorrent, even from a slime ball like you.  You are a complete and total piece of shit, and I am sooooo glad your past is rearing its ugly head. Honestly, I wish you were dead, but rotting in jail will suffice.

@stevesilberman If true - I have not seen it - then the statement in that message stirs a tremendous amount of fear in me. It‚Äôs the type of suggestive division that, if falling in to a perfect storm, could lead to violence.

@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump The previous strike, while domestically popular, had absolutely ZERO affect on Assad. Further strikes will yield the same.

@mcmoynihan Nicely done. I‚Äôve never been a fan of the hyper-outburst attack style, but I definitely appreciate his honesty...in THIS segment. If he‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs better, for all involved, to walk away.
@RickSmithShow @TheDemCoalition @funder Oh...I thought an angel lost its wings?!?
@JohnBrennan This. Just...this. Thank you.
@crampell Remind me never to go to Idaho. If this is type of people the state‚Äôs inhabitants elect, then fuck‚Äôem.
@chuckwoolery No worries Chuck! @RealJamesWoods is as irrelevant as you. You‚Äôre both washed up conspiracy theorists who are off your collective rockers! Have a great day!!!
@_Proud_American @RealJamesWoods @kat4sarah Wow...you are a complete fucking idiot. The biggest? I‚Äôm kinda thinking Russia, N Korea, cyberterrorism, spending billions on wars that we won‚Äôt win seem a bit more pressing than the Dems. Fucking mouthpiece idiot.

@Rleuthold2 Why yes...yes it is.
@riomedic @BreitbartNews I guess I can‚Äôt get past who she‚Äôs with, which makes her terribly unattractive, IMO.
@ProudResister @Bullshotinbutt @BernieSanders EXACTLY! We have entered a (Trumpian) era where ‚Äúwinning‚Äù is done by division &amp; being the loudest most brash/insulting person possible. We must return to a semblance of working together or ALL ‚ÄúSIDES‚Äù will lose. Bernie is a voice of the past &amp; no longer represents the time.
@alexburnsNYT Was umbrage taken? Or was umbrage given? Umbrage umbrage umbrage umbrage.		Or maybe: 	‚ÄúLike um-brage, oh-ver troubled wah-ter...‚Äù		Carry on...carry on. You may now return to your regularly scheduled @JerrySeinfeld episode.

@business 60 miles east of L.A., in Hemet, we felt it BIG TIME, complete with swinging lamps, fans, &amp; art. Just another day in SoCal. Carry on... nothin to see here.
@DailyMail @MailOnline Upgraded to 5.3. I live in Hemet (near Palm Springs) and while we get the shakes regularly, this one felt pretty heavy. Had another sizeable in two days ago. Typical SoCal. 		Carry on...nothin to see here.
@MMFlint Sadly, the same reaction would occur today. Even more sad is any (perceived) gains in social equality feel as if they‚Äôve been undone in the current climate. We have such a loooooong way to go. 		#MLK50th
@ProudResister @BernieSanders Sadly, @SenSanders is likely not much different than any other divisive politician, focusing on Trumpian rhetoric meant to separate us further, opposed to WORKING TOGETHER. WTF is wrong with these people?
@Mr_DrinksOnMe True, but those with Meniere‚Äôs want a-salt-rifles banned.
@QuantaMagazine Why WOULDN‚ÄôT it be dependent upon initial conditions? It‚Äôs non-linear, so any variance from an assumed origin could lead to drastic change. Seems totally logical. 		Very well written.
@TitusNation Bravo sir.	BRAAAHHH-VOE!	#Bravo
@RealOmarNavarro As a voter in your area I find it disingenuous to already be driving a wedge between you &amp; a segment of those you would represent. This kind of divisive separatism is no way to lead a diverse population...not successfully anyway. Just something to think about.
@ColoLibertarian I don‚Äôt think it passes constitutional muster, but it DEFINITELY breaches the HIPAA laws.  Any breach of medical records without consent is punishable by law.  Period. No consent...no use.
@Lady_Star_Gem @1Jedi_Rey Uh...you do know that both Obama and Bush did the same thing, right? The political landscape wasn‚Äôt as chaotically fractured or publicized as the current administration.
@ColoLibertarian I fail to see how that could be constitutional. Period.  And that doesn‚Äôt even address the breach of medical privacy.
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton Well, I don‚Äôt say this often, but Hillary is 100% correct. If you‚Äôre on the left, then you likely believe the right is lying; if you‚Äôre on the right, then you likely believe the left is lying. Partisan politics &amp; media are as divided as nearly any time in American history.
@thehill To be VERY CLEAR...is this separate and away from the 60 named this past week (who are then allowed to be replaced), or will this be in addition to the 60 (read, ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù).		It better be ‚Äúin addition.‚Äù @potus has been too weak on #Russia. Wonder why that is?		#TrumpColluded
@WisVoter @jmartNYT Extremely well written article w/ quantification to boot. Cheers. 		#DazzlingSignOfEnergy
@Charles__Sky @TrueFactsStated While I didn‚Äôt feel the article was particularly well written - though detailed - if indeed this is all true, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see it reach #Meuller. Then again the @GOP will continue ignoring any negative impact Russia has in our country‚Äôs safety &amp; security.
@MaggieJordanACN @funder @SpeakerRyan Did this actually make it up? I thought there were still funding issues.  If so, then ain‚Äôt it just a peach?

@ericgarland Suppose? Naaah. Convinced? Yes.  It happened days before w/ his surprise tariff party &amp; there is already speculation Amazon stock was sold by those close, who knew tweets were coming. Just sayin‚Äô.		The Hatch Act exists for a reason; the OPPOSITE of the Hatch Act should also apply
@Uncle_Jimbo @realDonaldTrump Still don‚Äôt understand all the vitriol to Mueller. Leaks have been relatively nil, he‚Äôs a lifelong Republican, and is simply doing a job he was appointed to do. Sessions &amp; Rosenstein should be where ire is directed. Mueller is just doing a job; AG &amp; DAG Made the appointment.
@SLSmith000 @CherylMarie2 I think he needs to be impeached but in THIS case (ie military on border) he is well w/ in his duties  to order it.

@chzhead85 @Toy_Breed @infowars Nobody made false statements about him this time...he got jumped on for his own statements.

@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @TheLastWord Yes...but a distinction should be clarified so as not to pass ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù #Trump is the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù of an investigation not a ‚Äútarget‚Äù of an investigation. This still does not bode well for him, as impeachment is still possible as a ‚Äúsubject.‚Äù	#GoMuellerGo #TrumpRussiaConspiracy
@dbongino That‚Äôs GREAT man. I wish this kind of respect could be recaptured across the board, as we‚Äôve become a country of loud tweets &amp; ad hominem attacks. This country will never be great or great again until a modicum of civility returns (or enters) daily life, FROM ALL PEOPLE.	#Respect
@JohnLarsonCT @SSWorks Not only does Social Security need expansion but it must happen with great speed, as the population sees the highest increases in aging ever seen.

@ericlackner @aliasvaughn No disappointment needed. You gotta ‚Äúfatten the bait‚Äù in order to catch bigger fish.‚Äù I.E., the fattening-up equates to a lighter sentence for cooperation. I‚Äôm actually encouraged. Just hope I‚Äôm right.
@CarolLeonnig @realDonaldTrump @costareports As I noted, he is not the ‚Äútarget of an investigation,‚Äù but is the ‚ÄúSUBJECT of an investigation,‚Äù which means impeachment is still possible (in lay terms).
@LaurenWern Yes indeedy! It was announced today that Trump is the ‚Äúsubject of an investigation,‚Äù by Mueller.  Mind you, not a ‚ÄúTARGET of an investigation,‚Äù but legally, being the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù does not bode well for #Trump. Fingers crossed.
@RealMuckmaker While not a Tweet maniac, @DanRather has, not surprisingly, contributed extremely clear, concise opinion pieces and thoughts throughout this (incredibly sad &amp; chaotic) time in history - for those who need it spelled out, that means ‚Äúduring Trump‚Äôs time in office.‚Äù Kudos Dan
@RealMuckmaker Unless I missed something, there was a clause in the recently signed omnibus bill that extended MMJ to all states, along with some other verbiage. What did I miss since then? 	#AskingForAFriend

@ClintEa77424490 @TWronker @chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump Once again...more derision, going immediately to the differences.  Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù isn‚Äôt exactly so, when his supporters do nothing but talk about locking people up and/or killing Democrats who believe otherwise. Way to go, man. Way to go.
@MLB @astros In a world filled with constant hate, vitriol, and classes of people getting further apart, THIS was a treat to see. So much raw emotion and love of the game. Purity. It is but a pipe dream to ever see this in political circles. Please, folks, know that we are all Americans FIRST
@SaltyOldBroad @marklevinshow I‚Äôm right there w/ you. The far sides of the political spectrum have forgotten the commonalities we share, and embrace hate and derision. I 100% agree, and sadly, don‚Äôt see it changing any time soon. Trump has done that damage, which will take many years to recover from, if ever.
@TWronker @chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump Doesn‚Äôt harm me man. I can‚Äôt stand either of them. The right just seems to forget that they burned crosses and hung black mannequins, in protest, while the GOP blocked whatever they could...yet whine about it now. People need to release the fucking hate.
@marklevinshow Sadly, the Palestinians are playing Trumps own game...smearing those they don‚Äôt agree w/ rather than finding whatever common ground might exist in order to make progress. Surprised [not] to see Trump supporters not recognize this.
@SaltyOldBroad @marklevinshow So wait, if Amazon was owned by a conservative you would have a different view? That‚Äôs an idiotic &amp; dangerous view.

@SpeakerRyan CHRISTIAN HYPOCRISY!!!		It is DEPLORABLE that you use your god as a shield from scrutiny and your antithetical attacks on human beings. You are a vile, despicable, accountability-lacking hypocrite who is so afraid of #Trump that you‚Äôve lost any semblance of morality.	#PaulRyan

@hilljobee This is what I don‚Äôt understand - Trump supporters who chastise folks who make ‚Äúpetty‚Äù or personal attacks. Trump is the absolute example of this type of bad behavior &amp; derision, separating people. I like many of his policies, but abhor this kind of mudslinging from ALL sides.
@InvestigateRU While I feel for this guy, his net worth is over $11M, which is about $11M more than the AVERAGE person‚Äôs net worth. I couldn‚Äôt care less re: how a person spends his/her $$ but his worth should be noted. If he needs extra $$ he could sell one of his homes or luxury cars, IMO.

@IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 While a good first step, apologies are hollow and meaningless without actions that illustrate remorse. Somehow I doubt you have remorse on any level, &amp; are reacting only to public backlash over who you truly are. I.e., likely too little too late. We‚Äôll see...it‚Äôs all up to u now.
@AsheSchow @SebGorka Why are you complaining? I bet you didn‚Äôt complain when folks ‚Äúboycotted‚Äù the NFL. STOP worrying about how others spend, or don‚Äôt spend their $$, and focus on your own issues. Of which there are, obviously, many.
@Nutrish @davidhogg111 So much vitriol from the right, yet these same folks had no issue boycotting the NFL or their sponsors. 		TOTAL FUCKING HYPOCRITES. 		When will folks stop demonizing people for opinions? Grow up, mind your OWN business, and focus on what you can control - YOU.

@krassenstein @Sixstring787 @krassenstein what could the penalties be if #Trump is found #guilty of the #Emoluments Clause? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be nothing more than a slap on the hand.

@Repka Agreed. @MetalBreakfast is just a loveable kinda guy.
@KimIndivisible @lauferlaw @PressSec ...and no offense, of course. You‚Äôve stated your opinion clearly &amp; respectfully. Mine just differs, as I believe @PressSec lies intentionally, as do those who oppose. It‚Äôs rampant, and difficult to wade through legal text to determine the ACTUAL truth.
@KimIndivisible @lauferlaw @PressSec Unless you‚Äôre a lawyer I find this a bit disingenuous. Even litigators don‚Äôt understand 100% of legal issues to claim clarity through this strikes me as an explanation that MIGHT have some emotion involved. I DESPISE #trump &amp; want him gone, but am also sick of ‚Äúalt facts‚Äù &amp; lies.
I‚Äôm NOT a Bush guy &amp; never have been but he is absolutely right re: calling for a return to more civilized &amp; appropriate rhetoric. The language of derision and chaos might work in private companies, but not as a nation. It only serves to highlight the differences not commonality https://t.co/2FqSopyV3b
@KimIndivisible @lauferlaw @PressSec Yeh...see, this is where it differs, depending on who is talking. Same with the Emoluments Clause violations. Talk to Repubs &amp; they say no illegality; talk to Dems &amp; they say illegal. So for the layman, it‚Äôs hard to TRULY know. Especially w/ all the lies from both sides. Sad.
@lauferlaw @KimIndivisible @PressSec Honest question. If YOU believe this, how likely is it to be reality? It seems that those on the POTUS‚Äô side believe the exact opposite. From the public side, it‚Äôs hard to know who is right.
@realDonaldTrump Service, meaning what? Fucking up the entire department?
@SenWhitehouse While the opioid issue is indeed nearing its apex please don‚Äôt forget that there are many of us who need opioids to live &amp; have NEVER abused them. Please don‚Äôt forget about us. Congress should not play  a role in dosages for patients. Focus on the illegal use- just like guns.
@SenWhitehouse Thanks for posting Senator. Why this is so difficult, for some, to understand (or rather, cling to old ways), I will never comprehend. Excellent graphic.

@DLoesch Hi Dana. There is lots of blame being cast on the shooter. For many, it‚Äôs just been ‚Äúa long time coming,‚Äù as there has been no meaningful legislation in decades, unlike just about every other facet of law in existence. Stop whining, and LISTEN!

@krassenstein Actually, that‚Äôs not necessarily true. Countries aiming for gun laws similar to the U.S. align themselves &amp; donate to causes with similar values.  This is not likely the case for all, but is a possibility. We see it all the time with other agenda lobbying.

@DLoesch ..right before your eyes. I‚Äôm not sure why all of a sudden people believe the way to ‚Äúwin‚Äù is to scream louder, deride, insult, or divide the nation further. Oh wait...I do know why.  Be a smarter voice Dana.  Not louder. Louder might work at appropriate times but smarter...
@DLoesch Stop with the whiny-bitch-under-attack schtick and use your fucking head. Otherwise, you‚Äôll be chewed up a spit out, over time, and the only people left supporting you are the ones that were there in the beginning (or fewer) while your opponents‚Äô ranks have unbalanced &amp; swelled..
@DLoesch You need not change the goals or roadmap of your fight, but for crying out loud...act like a mature adult and use what is some obvious intelligence to craft your rhetoric, not ugly divisive rhetoric that only appears disingenuous. The cause suffers with each outburst.
@DLoesch Laughably, you will blame what you call the downfall of 2A when SOME legislation is passed - oh wait, you have. Let me reiterate: many who might otherwise support at least your ideology, have already exited the convo because of how you‚Äôve conducted yourself. Yup...a true trog.
@DLoesch ...that you‚Äôre not interested in any true dialog or actually HEARING the voices of millions of people, numbers that grow daily. 		I respect the cause you ‚Äúfight‚Äù for but there are much better, more productive &amp; efficient ways to wage a battle, without looking like a whiny bitch.
@DLoesch You have gone about this incredibly immaturely &amp; continue amazing me, with what appears as a conversation that you belong in, but by refusing to even hear the other side, you‚Äôve exited before the convo began. It will ultimately be the undoing. Your tactical strategy shows...
@DLoesch ...not only are you losing credibility, the opposing voice grows exponentially &amp; all you do is whine more. I gave you props for appearing on the CNN show- took balls- but have since lost any iota of respect I had for you, as it appears a sizable &amp; growing # of the world agree.
@DLoesch Good holy Moses on a popsicle stick. You are a true piece of shit, relishing in the division among Americans. Being a bitch, antagonizing kids, &amp; giving the perception of being a mean, regretful old lady is not becoming. Don‚Äôt disagree with your fight, but the way is wrong...
@RealOmarNavarro @RepMaxineWaters I can tell you right now, as much as I detest Waters, this type of division among Californians is the microsm of what Trump is doing nationally.

@TalbertSwan @tperkins @Franklin_Graham @robertjeffress @Pontifex @POTUS It IS INDEED unequivocal denunciation, but not of one man.

@DrGPhdBS @RAEShipman @TalbertSwan Because at this stage, the catastrophic lack of respect given to the office of the President BY THE PRESIDENT is more important to illustrate than blindly offering respect to someone just because of a title. Yessuh massah...yessuh.
@TalbertSwan @tperkins @Franklin_Graham @robertjeffress @Pontifex I despise the man but the article you linked, nowhere, states a pontifical denouncement of Trump, only actions of men.

@ChrisCrocker @tonyposnanski And props for speaking up man.
@ChrisCrocker @tonyposnanski Man...I wish you could sue for this.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson Absolutely. Thanks for the dialogue man!
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson Absolutely correct, which bring me full circle. Why, then, with not only ONE ‚Äúmisjudgment/crime‚Äù but many, how has nobody (including Congress) knuckled down and taken action? Yeh...that would mean DOJ actually do something. I get it. As I said, it‚Äôs all just terribly scary.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson Ok...you DO understand. FOX is nothing but Trump-Panderer-In-Chief and have been waiting for this for years. They are not ‚Äúfair and balanced.‚Äù They‚Äôve lost a lot of credibility in the last 20 years, which is why one of their own called them ‚Äúentertainment opinion.‚Äù
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson And FWIW, I won‚Äôt touch Infowars. That‚Äôs not news, but propaganda. At least Breitbart occasionally has SOME (ie very little) substance and teeth outside of jacking #Trump off.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson Well, I do. I read ‚Äúnews‚Äù from outlets all the way from the most conservative to the most liberal &amp; everything in between. If one is saturated with ONLY what he believes, there is no way to understand what both sides are saying. I don‚Äôt digest what I don‚Äôt believe, but am aware.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson And FUCK YEA...we have the right to be angry. FURIOUS...SAD...DISGUSTED...you name it. Why, then - or maybe, how - do so many millions believe the evidence is on their side? That kind of (deluded) opinion should scare every citizen of the United States.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson I fully agree. Again, for as much we ‚Äúagree,‚Äù the point I am apparently not conveying is that TO ME, not only is it scary (what he is doing) but that a sizeable chunk of people BELIEVE there is incontrovertible evidence saying the opposite. It‚Äôs disgusting and scary.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson This doesn‚Äôt begin to explain the (so called) ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù Trump apologists and enablers - ie, HYPOCRITES. They worship a man who is essentially antithesis of their beliefs but sweep his actions under the rug in the name of ‚Äúxtian conservative values. Another point of difference.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson Examples of neglect include many in the @GOP who continually allow the @POTUS to belittle and deride both citizens &amp; (perceived) political adversaries &amp; world leaders. Read the definition &amp; study of ‚Äúhigh crimes &amp; misdemeanors‚Äù to see how unethical/immoral traits qualify as such.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson That scares the crap out of me. It‚Äôs also scary to see the @potus abuse his position and commit high crimes and misdemeanors, yet have millions of people worship him. Scary scary scary, that we can have two sides so far apart, w/ no middle ground.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson Examples are massive. Read Breitbart &amp; it‚Äôs vehemently (&amp; violently) pro-Trump w/ calls for civil war rampant through comments. On the left, it‚Äôs the opposite - impeach, hang, etc.		My point is not to iterate a side, but to note public disparity and the near violent disagreement.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson I might not have been concise enough. What I‚Äôm talking about is the PUBLIC perception, and that those on the far right believe #Trump did no wrong (and LOVE everything he does) and the far left that believe everything he does is bad (or illegal/immoral/unethical).

@ColoLibertarian This is so true. I voted for Gary Johnson &amp; was crucified by friends for ‚Äútaking a vote away‚Äù from Trump or Clinton (depending on who I spoke with).  And yes...sometimes candidates simply don‚Äôt deserve a vote...even the candidate of ‚Äúlesser evils.‚Äù	#VoteLibertarian #KnowBeforeNo
@DanaRohrabacher and fwiwI am 1 of your constituents. I voted for u in every election you were on ballot. This will change the next time you face re-election. American people deserve more respect and less divisive rhetoric. Policy can be fixed, this damage cannot. Sad to say, as a conservative.
@DanaRohrabacher This is definitely true. Unity works more effectively than division, but realize that you support a @POTUS who on a daily basis sows the seeds of division not only from outside Rep ranks but within them as well. I like many policies but can‚Äôt support admin that blatantly divides.
@Xynyx2001 @SethAbramson I get that...I suppose I‚Äôm just REALLY struggling with (what appears to be) the total usurpation of legal responsibilities and pure partisanship. It scares the living hell out me. Sadly, both the far left and the far right feel EXACTLY the same, but from opposing viewpoints.

@SethAbramson To have such tremendous division and belief in polar opposite views leaves me with a queasy feeling that the division in our country is so great, we will never overcome. No matter which way it ‚Äúends‚Äù millions of people will scream ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS &amp; CORRUPTION!‚Äù That is sad...&amp; scary.
@SethAbramson Saddest part about this entire thing -well, maybe not THEE saddest - is that if one reads posts from any conservative site/Tweet, the EXACT opposite of your post is explained &amp; the readers FULLY believe that Trump (et al) did nothing wrong &amp; that HRC is to blame. They believe it.

@JanzforCongress You have my vote! Sadly, I was a @DevinNunes constituent until @realDonaldTrump took office &amp; Nunes chose party before country.

Probably the most apt tweet I‚Äôve read about the lack of understanding my fellow conservatives. Nobody is asking guns to be banned or taken from citizens, just that we formulate common sense AMENDMENTS that guarantee our 2nd Amd rights AND prevent guns in the wrong hands. https://t.co/36wtljrn1F

@BigJBeezy @KellyannePolls How can someone who swears at children, constantly and publicly derides those who disagree with him, &amp; has does more to divide citizens than bringing them together, be the best president ever?

Had a positive hour long exchange with @BaileyForAG today &amp; while I appreciate dialog with him &amp; @CACoreyU, my point was missed.  Voters are tired of substanceless candidates on ballots. We want to hear candidate solutions not how awful their opponents are! Stop dividing ppl  1/2
@CACoreyU @BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra @calsheriffs And lastly...listen to voters in Penn spec election. Voters want good candidates who have substance &amp; solutions, not more of the same. We need solid financially conservative leadership in CA, not ‚Äúmore of the same.‚Äù  Temper, balance &amp; evolve your message. Prove WHY Judge is best.
@CACoreyU @BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra @calsheriffs We need more than ‚Äúmore of the same‚Äù and while I have respect for the Judge he has done little more than play foil thus far. Include abs embrace substance! Make change beyond partisan blame. Be who CA needs...someone to unite not deride and insult. @potus does enough insulting.
@CACoreyU @BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra @calsheriffs I understand Corey &amp; as mentioned, even as an opponent (who is still open to where his vote goes) I appreciate both your time and the Judge‚Äôs. Twitter is not an ideal platform for anything more than reaction. Hard to display substance. Soc Med is good but don‚Äôt lose the message
@CACoreyU @BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra @calsheriffs Last for the day. Until I see any change in strategy his messages are little more than passing blame. There is no personal substance or strategy outlined for change, merely ‚Äúvote for me I‚Äôll follow law, I‚Äôm better than ...‚Äù. Step outside and look in at your strategy. Shallow.
@CACoreyU @BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra @calsheriffs Thank you.  		Of course it‚Äôs important, but don‚Äôt pretend to believe voters are (all) inept and will change their views with this strategy. We are TIRED of this divisiveness.

@BaileyForAG @NancyGrace @MrsdogC @bobbybrown719 @PollyDad @AGBecerra @POTUS Well, thank you for the dialog. You have proven no different than any other politician without a strategy to exemplify him/herself. I.E., MORE OF THE SAME! Blame everyone else without presenting how YOU will fix the issues #nomoreswamp #moreofthesame #noonbailey #presidenotderide
@BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra @calsheriffs Believe me, I want ‚Äúsanctuary cities‚Äù gone.  But you have still laid no groundwork on HOW you will FIX things, rather only attacked. Substance, law, and respect are what we need. You might have the ‚Äúlaw‚Äù part but yield poorly in the others. D
@BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra @calsheriffs More word play! There is a difference between this list and choosing to weaponize &amp; attack. WHAT WILL YOU DO DIFFERENTLY TO FIX IT? You‚Äôre making my point- more of the same. Attack attack attack...forget integrity &amp; substance. We want more for conservative CA #nomorepartisanhacks
@XavierBecerra @realDonaldTrump But what are YOU doing now? I support legal immigration but we cannot continue allowing criminal migrants back on our streets. You‚Äôve done nothing to prevent this. I get the fight, but we do not want illegal criminal migrants here. DACA yes!!! Sanctuary for criminals, NO- Fix it!
@BaileyForAG @AGBecerra @XavierBecerra @CAGOP If the measure of your ‚Äúfairness‚Äù is the fork in your tongue, then I will stop worrying about you as a force. We are tired of derision, sick of being pulled apart, and want solutions.  Blind partisanship w/ no consideration to the ‚Äúunum‚Äù is what you are perceived as. No derision.
@BaileyForAG @NancyGrace @MrsdogC @bobbybrown719 @PollyDad @AGBecerra @POTUS We‚Äôre tired of empty words offered by those with the gumption to speak negatively (in public) about their opponents. It‚Äôs more of the same, and even through these exchanges (which I appreciate u taking time for) you‚Äôve done nothing to change this perception. Empty words.
@BaileyForAG @NancyGrace @MrsdogC @bobbybrown719 @PollyDad @AGBecerra @POTUS So, you‚Äôre ‚Äúmost qualified‚Äù for a single facet of a job that holds countless responsibilities? This illustrates the point I‚Äôve made in contacting you - you‚Äôre doing little beyond displays of division and attacks that offer concrete plans for conservative CA.
@BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra Work beyond the narrative of derision illustrated from Washington. Show us (CA voters) you are different &amp; not more of the same. Ripping on your opponents makes you appear weak and without substance. Follow the parh you‚Äôre on &amp; and you are destined for failure.
@BaileyForAG @JerryBrownGov @AGBecerra You asked me a question, so here is an answer. THIS tweet is exactly what I speak of - more of the same derisive, attacks. Tell us less about them &amp; more about you &amp; HOW you will fix problems. We all know the AG is who he is. Even as a conservative I will not ‚Äúswap‚Äù poor leaders.
@BaileyForAG @FCCRWF @POTUS @AGBecerra I DO agree with this, but why change your tune now? Most of your public statements say nothing about YOU beyond generic statements such as you ‚Äúwill follow law,‚Äù and are derisive to your opponents (who are no better).  To us (voters) you appear to be ‚Äúmore of the same.‚Äù
@BaileyForAG @AGBecerra @XavierBecerra @CAGOP You are skewing facts to suit your (divisive) narrative. You speak of change, less partisan roadblocks, and following the ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù yet say little about what YOU will do better. It is more of the same, and your actions illustrate that. We see through it.
@BaileyForAG @NancyGrace @MrsdogC @bobbybrown719 @PollyDad @AGBecerra Of the strings, you are but a panderer of @POTUS despicable rhetoric and are obviously a supporter of ‚Äúpolitics by derision.‚Äù  This is no change, just more of the same.
@BaileyForAG @NancyGrace @MrsdogC @bobbybrown719 @PollyDad @AGBecerra Of course it‚Äôs failing, and at both state and federal levels. JB and his AG have dug a deep hole, but you will only do the same, but from the right. As another strum
@BaileyForAG @FCCRWF @POTUS @AGBecerra If you‚Äôre serious about this run, then why are you using divisive tactics opposed to being Californians together? Your narrative is not indicative of your actions, which will be painfully obvious when voters hit the polls. STOP with untrue rhetoric and focus on YOU &amp; what you do.
@BaileyForAG @FCCRWF @POTUS @AGBecerra The current AG must go, but to replace him with someone who enters the race exhibiting partisan ideology replaces one bad politician with another. Conservatives in CA need better than BOTH of you. Your narrative is as empty as most political promises.
@BaileyForAG @AGBecerra @XavierBecerra @CAGOP Once again, @BaileyForAG doing exactly what he throws shade ar. Current court case is ONLY about the title used, not the legislation. Why are you not fighting the same issues happening in DC and within the GOP? #fakenews #defeatbailey #Liars
@BaileyForAG @NancyGrace @MrsdogC @bobbybrown719 @PollyDad @AGBecerra You are such a liar, and divisive personality. I don‚Äôt like the current AG, but he is not ‚Äúdismantling‚Äù the system. Stop lying! Fight properly- do not obfuscate facts for your benefit. Integrity is obviously not a hallmark of yours. Stop creating a false narrative; fight w/ honor
@BaileyForAG @FCCRWF Thankfully you will lose miserably.  As a conservative living in CA it is difficult to find other conservatives who share my ideology. YOU are not one of those people. As a relative unknown, it is shocking that you enter the race in such a separatist way. Stop pandering to @POTUS
@BaileyForAG Way to go in to an election being devisive. Not even a HINT that as a ‚Äúpotential‚Äù public servant you will work to bring people together in the best way possible. I will actively be protesting your campaign. #presidenotderide #nomorepartisanhacks

@JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump Moron. It‚Äôs NEVER been about taking guns away. Just updating legislation that makes it HARDER for irresponsible people from owning them. If you‚Äôre a responsible gun owner you‚Äôll be fine. How can every other law evolve w/ time, but gun laws are the same as they‚Äôve been 4 decades?
@ABOLISHWELFARE @realDonaldTrump Uh...apparently you have not listened, seen, or have chosen to IGNORE tens if not hundreds of thousands of people who DO want it. We don‚Äôt want peoples‚Äô rights to own guns taken away. Just to modify legislation that makes it harder for SICK and IRRESPONSIBLE people to own them.

@AriFleischer Agreed. The left may indeed have a fire lit but to win the general as a Dem/Ind will demand a more centrist tone. Too much ‚ÄúProgressive‚Äù will turn off too many. Left is fine, as is right. Extremes of either will be harder to vote through. The ‚ÄúTrump test‚Äù looks to be a failure.
@HunterMG__ @Wake_up666 @ChurchofSatan You are completely out of your skull crazy. The Church of Satan does not pay anybody for propaganda, nor would it ever assume the guise of children‚Äôs lit. That is completely against our principles. Beyond reading a different book, mind your own self.

@SethAbramson Quite a diatribe, but I believe the end result you hypothesize is not correct...or at least not carried out far enough. Meuller might refer 45 for impeachment, but the votes will never materialize &amp; he will skate. Trump will run his mouth that he ‚Äúwon‚Äù, ad nauseum, end of story.

oh lord. It wasn't ignored. She was fired, or did ur news station not say this? Dems are weak &amp; whiny now but ur a sheep. Reps r just as bad
@PinkLacedPoppy because Clinton is not being investigated anymore. Trump is. His lies and bullying put him in this position. Don't b a sheep

@AngryWHStaffer hardly. Your hoax is getting worse. All WH laptops connect via VPN.  Give it up.
@realDonaldTrump no...which is why #FISA exists. You should know that, you idiot.
@IsaacDovere seriously? For as many times as Trump has disparagingly called out Obama, I'm surprised it's only been x 2, as u say.
Ok...@POTUS has lost his mind. Wire taps? Ufreakin kidding? If Congress hasn't started penning Article 25 I'm shocked #Trump #Crazy #Impeach
@realDonaldTrump you have lost your god damned mind. I hear Congress penning the Article 25 declaration now.
@cervi_gina you are brainwashed. Left and right can both have Christian ideals. UR rhetoric borders on hate. Teach ur girls THAT cxstn hate?
@tedlieu @POTUS once against Dems powerless Reps scared or towing party line. WHAT WILL U REALLY DO? Actions only...tweets do nothing.
Best...EVER! Funny, but sadly poignant. I wonder if Trudeau would rush my application? https://t.co/WNJ1nMoILn
@ProgressOutlook saddest part? Those conservative "patriots" will justify everything. If tables were turned, purple twinkies would be shat.
@Easyridersf Occam's Razor didn't even make it out of the package. This is waaaay bigger and more complex. I just want it done.
RT @riotwomennn: Hey, Kellyanne say: "I'm Ruining America"        . . .       Anyone know who the prankster is?  https://t.co/ilC4i26bMZ
@MartinHeinrich @Tony3218 why RT? Tweets do nothing. WHAT R U GONNA DO ABOUT THIS? Actions are all that matter. WHAT WILL U DO?!?
@valbrady123 @Emeraldluxury @davidfrum Dems r powerless Reps r scared of tweets. They've forgotten WE THE PEOPLE &amp; R in partisan battles.
@ABC @CNN @washingtonpost @MSNBC @CBSNews @FoxNews please keep digging on Russian allegations. We need to find truth &amp; put it to bed. #Truth
@tous2005 #brainwashed #mouthpiece. Both the left and the right are wrong. You just choose to associate with the hip new wrong. #theyalllie
@Patriotic_Me @TheTylt Any one of these bastards on the left and the right could be put in federal prison....  Fixed that for ya.
@TheTylt @BernieSanders tweets mean NOTHING! What will ACTUALLY be done. Dems r powerless Reps r scared of tweets. We are screwed.
@SarahPalinUSA good for u! You know how to work FB but couldn't teach ur daughter about birth control.
@SarahPalinUSA a whopping 25 response average. Wow...you're sooo relevant. Slither back under the rock you crawled out from under.
@SarahPalinUSA I like your line of thinking @RussellRosenk1
@haasehop @tedlieu @USATODAY I'm sure you are. It is sickening, because while the legislators sling mud, WE THE PEOPLE suffer.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @USATODAY when will congress realize that while there is a need 4 investigations, the back &amp; forth only sinks them
@FrankPallone @PrincessBravato so WHAT R U GONNA DO ABOUT IT? Dems r powerless Reps scared of tweets. TAKE ACTION stop tweeting. #ACTIONONLY
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @USATODAY it's coming from ALL SIDES! I'm sick of ALL this mudslinging. The entire world is laughing &amp; crying 4 us
When will legislators get it? BOTH SIDES HAVE FUCKED UP &amp; R GUILTY OF MISTEPS,LIES. Stop it. It is WE THE PEOPLE #NoMoreLies #Preside #Sick
The absurd amount of mudslinging between Dems &amp; Reps is out of control &amp; why U.S. is divided. STOP FIGHTING, GOVERN &amp; DO UR JOBS #TRUMP

3/2 @realDonaldTrump your need to incorrectly convince urself of truisms has made u the laughing stock of the world. Oh yeh...minus deplrbls
2/2 @realDonaldTrump if u had lost due 2 popular vote (nrlt 3M) &amp; the tables were turned u'd be in a bigger hissy fit than birth certificat
1/2  @realDonaldTrump u r such an incredible loser! Actually ppl just care about the face ur admin can't be trusted. They have dug own holes
@KellyannePolls doubting u'll c this, but PLEASE leave ur job. 4 the sake of the U.S. U bring no credibility to this country &amp; r not trusted
@RepEspaillat talk is cheap. WHAT'LL U DO ABOUT IT? Ds are powerless Rs are scared of tweets. WHAT ACTIONS WILL U TAKE? #SessionsMustResign
@tedlieu definitely not defending him, but need to keep reasons for his call to resign, clear. #SessionsMustResign
@tedlieu the guy is scum &amp; never should have been confirmed, but discussing #Ukraine would've been relevant to his position @ the time yes?
"No one talked to Russia except my Campaign Manager, Nat. Security Advisor, AG &amp; like 15 other guys. NO ONE." Keeping score? 	#TrumpRussia
@IvankaTrump "I applaud my father's commitment to power over women chauffeurs as key drivers in sodomy." FIXED THAT FOR YOU #AllTrumpsSuck
@KellyannePolls @DailyCaller yet, u take no issue with @POTUS "moving on her like a bitch" &amp; "grab'em by the pussy"? Shocker.	#mouthpiece
@NancyPelosi @POTUS yes... #TrumpLies but WHAT R U GONNA DO BOUT IT? Tweets &amp; words mean nothing without HARD ACTIONS! Don't stop fighting.
@ProgressOutlook um...because he's a narcissistic egoist who can't stand sharing a spotlight? Maybe?
@Rosie 2/2 if it was a Dem issue. He would be tweeting his lying ass off, uselessly, but there is still no proof. Lying under oath? Yes.
@Rosie I can't stand the guy &amp; def think he's scum, but where is proof he colluded? It APPEARS that way &amp; Chump would b livid if tables turn
@SpeakerRyan all for not unless congressional Reps stand up 4 beliefs. Don't let @POTUS bully. PLEASE work with Dems 4 Amer ppl #bipartisan
@RepHartzler @SpeakerRyan don't be bullied by @POTUS. Do the right thing for Amer ppl. Work with Dems for a GOOD replacement #bipartisan
@NancyPelosi more talk, more tweets. WHAT WILL U DO BOUT THIS? Words mean zero unless u seek resignation. Ds R powerless Rs scared of tweets
@jencraneNYC ...and years...and...
@OrangeUanIdiot psssht...he should be at home on his porch, in the swing, sipping on iced tea...readying to call his parole officer.
If you didn't believe it before now, shit just got real. #EPA #ClimateChange #ClimateAction  #ProtectOurEarth I hope it's DOA in congress. https://t.co/DsPnCvklH4
@OrangeUanIdiot he certainly plays the "forgetful lil old man" well. For some1 supposedly so fastidious he sure does "not recall" a lot.
@StateDept @CommerceGov @WhiteHouse until 45s ACTIONS change, not a single word will be taken sriously. Start by supporting Planned Parenthd
@Alyssa_Milano @gop will sweep this under the rug and discuss it from another angle (alt facts) as always. We r truly doomed w/ this admin.
@clairecmc WHAT R U GOING 2 DO? Dems R powrlss Reps R scared of tweets. HOW FAR WILL U GO 4 TRUTH? Ur constituents want truth #SessionsLied
@Emeraldluxury @jay3738 they are hardly media, Dems, or twisting anything. They were cautious but held no bones.
@Emeraldluxury @jay3738 how is it distortion when @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; @SenJohnMcCain both said they believe investigation is necessary?
@Emeraldluxury @jay3738 yep...not sure how this can NOT be considered lying. Call it alt facts, untruth- A lie is a lie. Partisanship aside
@RepGoodlatte still believe this or will you file in to partisan line that denies he perjured himself? We constituents want investigation.
@MattAsherS @McFaul my assertion EXACTLY. This should not be a partisan issue, EVER. Sadly, the partisan fighting only brings division.
@McFaul @MattAsherS WHAT R U GONNA DO BOUT IT? Dems R powerless Reps R scared of 45s tweets. HOW WILL U FIGHT THIS? Actions matter not words
@RepSwalwell WHAT R U GONNA DO BOUT IT? Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets by 45. HOW R U GONNA FIGHT THIS? Actions not words #no lies
@EADHistory @ezlusztig @SenWarren the chickens have come home to roost. Dems R powerless &amp; Reps R scared of 45's tweets. Sad...very sad.
@TheJusticeDept incredibly outrageous that JD has become a puppet to Trump 4 fear of tweets. YOU MUST HAVE ETHICS TO LEAD!!! Stop the lies!
@TheJusticeDept yet @realDonaldTrump refuses to share his w/ the Amer ppl. Now JD head caught lying under oath. Wtf happened to the U.S.?
@Impeach_D_Trump sadly it won't happen. Dems R powerless &amp; Reps R scared of tweets &amp; already stating he did nothing wrong. More lies.
@jay3738 @Emeraldluxury this is part of the problem -degrading attacks on FELLOW AMERICANS because we disagree. Change must start EVERYWHERE
@RobertKMcCannDO @MichaelCohen212 @POTUS  his best yet, but unifying it was not. Hopefully he continues in this way &amp; stop his attacks.
@jay3738 and have been going on for as long as I can remember. Nothing new nothing more devisive than has always been. ALL BROKEN Dems &amp; Rep
@jay3738 we can agree on that - not sure what to believe. All the more reason for non-partisan inquiry. Leaks R not trans, but a dfrnt prblm
@clarychka I'm a HUGE supporter of ALL town hall gatherings, but to present this the way u have is irresponsible &amp; provocative. FACTS ONLY!!
@clarychka way too much uncertainty about the facts behind this letter. Assuming what u have IS part of the problem. FACTS ONLY no hyperbole
@jay3738 and sadly we voted these ppl in to office...Dems &amp; Reps. Hopefully next election cycle (2yrs) will see Amer ppl pay attn then in 4
@jay3738 agreed. I hated all our options. Regardless, this is where we R for next 4 yrs. I want full transparency on ALL SIDES. WE R THE PPL
@jay3738 I feel you. Sadly I believe the whole system is broken. Dems lie &amp; whine Reps lie &amp; pivot. It's a travesty ALL these ppl suck &amp; lie
@SenWarren but again WHAT R U GONNA DO ABOUT IT? Tweets do nothing Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets. WHAT ACTION WILL U TAKE 4 TRUTH
@brianschatz agreed but WHAT R U GONNA DO ABOUT IT? Dems R powerless &amp; Reps R scared of tweets. HOW FAR WILL U GO 2 make the truth come out?
@jay3738 Hillary IS horrible but that is no excuse for congress NOT to look in to potential issues. No room for partisanship on this one.
@SenWarren fine...keep tweeting. But WHAT R U GOING TO DO? Dems R powerless &amp; Reps R scared of tweets. HOW WILL U MAKE THIS HAPPEN? Fight on
@AngryWHStaffer not that I doubt it, but without proof you are just as uncredible as your boss.
@Kimmi1965 I hope so. I TRULY hope this won't get swept under the rug like everything else. Forgive me if I have no faith that won't happen.
@tariqnasheed @washingtonpost nothing'll be done. Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets &amp; already saying he did nothing wrong #Broken
@deidshaw @MalcolmNance too true. Partisanship has become a monster that displaces sovereignty. Congress is broken, but Trump can't fix it.
@TrumpNewsOrg she is scum too, but just because she is/was horrible doesn't excuse/justify congress from bringing American ppl the truth.
@RepAdamSchiff but WHAT WILL U DO ABOUT IT? Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PPL?
@Kimmi1965  haven't heard that YET, but they're already saying he did nothing wrong... It was "part of his job, wearing a Senator's hat."
So, pot=kettle? It is STILL unbelievable to me that he is POTUS, but his pivots are even harder than LeBron in the paint. #NoMoreLies #Trump https://t.co/qpmW9C7oV0
@RepTimRyan but WHAT R U REALLY GONNA DO ABOUT IT? Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets. Should B non-partisan issue but it has become 1
@Kimmi1965 @tribelaw no...just a PEOPLES' MARCH! No longer a Dems vs Reps issue. It's about major political corruption. Truth must come out!
@JohnWDean but what will ACTUALLY be done? Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets &amp; already saying Sessions did nothing bad #SessionsLied
@victimavagina @NancyPelosi regardless of political bent or what happened in the past, it must be brought to clear end and put to bed.
@IamJasnLee @Millermena proof? They are all scum, but facts, not hyperbole are all that matter. #SessionsLied
@tribelaw never gonna happen. Dems r powerless Reps are scared of tweets &amp; already saying it was ok. SHOUL be non-partisan uproar, but noooo
@kurteichenwald not gonna happen. Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets. ALL congress should be mad but @GOP will pivot and say it's OK
@OversightDems @RepCummings  WHAT WILL U DO? Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets but WHAT WILL U REALLY DO? Don't stop fighting lies.
@tedlieu WHAT WILL U DO? Tweets R not action. Dems R powerless Reps R scared of tweets. WHAT WILL YOU DO? Shouldn't be partisan issue but is
@Easyridersf fuck...and he practically wants a medal for doing his job. Yeesh. #TheResistance #ImpeachTrump #TrumpLies #SessionsLied
@NancyPelosi the ENTIRE investigation in to Russia must be done. American ppl deserve anti-partisan truth. CONGRESS WORKS FOR US #NoMoreLies
@NancyPelosi Dems need to choose battles better so when something like this occurs it is heard. UR too busy fighting everything to B heard.
@NancyPelosi WHAT WILL U DO ABOUT THIS? Dems r powerless Reps r scared of tweets so what will you REALLY do? Should not be partisan issue.
@SenWarren even if determined he did nothing wrong, American ppl deserve to know. Dems have to choose battles, this is one of them.
@SenWarren you MUST not let this go. If this does not reach clear resolution, ALL of congress fails American ppl.
@SenWarren but WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT IT? Dems are powerless Reps are scared of @POTUS tweets. Should not B partisan issue. WHAT WILL U DO?
@KeithOlbermann 	https://t.co/wGvyZC2bov
Pot...kettle...alt facts? When will administration realize that truth matters to American ppl? Not here to convict, but must B investigated https://t.co/6xvftKYWn9
@POTUS @VP @jeffsessions it should B a pretty simple count. Don't need to add Trump's continued alt facts; we know of his lies #NoMoreLies
@POTUS I mean, I know Flynn only lied to @VP and @jeffsessions only lied under oath. @KellyannePolls only gave an endorsement...no biggy.
Can someone remind me the # of @POTUS appointees who have lied? I've lost track &amp; don't want 2 B unfair. #SessionsLied #SessionsResignNOW
@CoryBooker @GOP at the very least, @jeffsessions appears to have perjured himself. WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT THIS? American ppl deserve TRUTH!
@CoryBooker this should not be partisan issue but @GOP has largely made it one. WHAT MORE WILL U DO to ensure proper outcome? #SessionsLied
@RepMikeQuigley @whatthefox so what are you going to do about it? Dems r powerless @GOP is scared of @POTUS tweets. WHAT R U GOING TO DO?
@michaeldweiss like seriously! I constantly "forget" high level conversations that are pivotal to national interest. #SessionsLied #Recuse
@MargaretHoover thank u for not being a mouthpiece &amp; speaking honestly about @jeffsessions. It is very "optically terrible." #SessionsLied
@brianstelter @seanhannity I'm sorry- what does @rosie have to do with the $$ of tea in China? You're both despicable &amp; part of da problem.
@SenJohnMcCain @CNN GREAT job both you and @LindseyGrahamSC. Thanks for honest responses &amp; for fighting a good fight- WE are who u work FOR.
@MerriamWebster gee...I wonder why? Deplorables know nothing more than what they are fed and Clinton backers are blind. Sad state of affairs
@washingtonpost it'll never happen. Dems r powerless @GOP is scared of @POTUS tweets. Shouldn't be partisan issue. All SHOULD be furious.
@stevenjay @washingtonpost it will never change. Dems r powerless Repubs fear tweets THE press is the only way to freedom sadly DONT GIVE IN
@BraddJaffy @kasie congrats on trump doing his freaking. Next, he'll want a medal for it. #presidenotderide #trump #DoYourJob #nomorelies
@SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @jeffsessions he says his communications were "not relevant." W/ Dems powerless what r u going to do? Respond
@SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris as a constituent I want 2 know what laws @jeffsessions broke &amp; why nothing is being done? Sounds like perjury
@Rosie @POTUS the public must continue raising its voice about this. I hope you stay loud about this no matter how quiet they try 2 keep it.
@Rosie @POTUS it should not be a partisan issue. All congress should be scared to death about this, yet it will be swept under the rug again
@Rosie it'll never happen. Dems r powerless Reps are scared of a tweet from @POTUS. Our only voice is a free press which is barely free now.
@RepJohnLarson @washingtonpost Dems r powerless Reps are scared to stand up 2 @potus. What'll YOU DO? Shouldn't b partisan issue, but now is
@mmpadellan @Rosie ain't gonna matter. @POTUS &amp; @GOP will sweep under rug. Dems r powerless, Repubs r scared to stand up. Press is only way!
@CNN PHEW...I didn't realize that. Thanks for reporting such an unknown issue.
@CelleighCaryn @PrincessBravato @maddow @KeithOlbermann @CharlesMBlow @DavidCornDC @Fahrenthold @FareedZakaria @kurteichenwald KEEP DIGGING
@Hadas_Gold @POTUS should not B a partisan matter. Why it has become one is sickening &amp; Trump seems uninterested in an independent inquiry
@Hadas_Gold wish ALL congress would see this as a serious matter. Repubs won't stand up to @POTUS Dems are powerless. Needs 2 B investigated
@GOP the Trump needs to stop deriding &amp; start presiding. YOU need to stand up when u don't agree w/ him. WE r America not just u legislators
@LindseyGrahamSC "my biggest fear is not losing my job but not standing up &amp; speaking out when I know it's right." ALL congress take note!!!
@AriBerman @OscarNunezLA until congressional Repubs stand up &amp; stop fearing Trump tweets, nothing'll be done. Shouldn't be a partisan issue
@SenBobCasey also NEVER gonna happen. Cong Reps will not stand up. This is not a partisan issue but is unfolding as one. Don't stop fighting
@SenBobCasey NEVER going to happen. Too many Repubs not willing to stand up to Trump. If it was still a Dem congress, Reps would be livid
@CBSNews it seems that the new administration has no desire to be across-the-board-ethical or firm, except when it suits their agenda. Sad.
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC I don't agree w/ ur politics, but I applaud ur resolve in defending freedom &amp; standing up to Trump #TownHall
@badgirl_loony @__NgiNeThemba__ sadly, it isn't illegal. Until that time, all we can do is keep digging and push.
@PostRoz @maggieNYT @washingtonpost why is this a big deal UNLESS it was illegal? Whole new admin is scum but we need FACTS of illegality.
@usairforce may all of them stay safe, fed, and with TRUTHFUL Intel.
@SarahPalinUSA only that you think you're relevant to the American people. Enjoy life, and stay out of politics...for all our sakes. Peace.
@bobtedeschi @statnews excellent piece.
@CNN negligence is no excuse for breaking a law.
@GovMikeHuckabee you're a piece of work. You aren't even pretending to be nice. I'm ashamed to be a Republican in this time. #shutup&amp;fixit
Every presser contains the exact, repeated rhetoric of the last. When will @realDonaldTrump stop talking &amp; start doing? #JointSession #facts
@KellyannePolls @POTUS saying it doesn't make it true. It's not what is said but what is done...which so far, is nothing.
@Publia1920 stop preaching. I'm a big boy, with my own views. You're welcome to ignore or crawl back to your cocoon.
@jencraneNYC oh...this is just the beginning of a long and painful exercise. Goodbye arts, goodbye socl prgrms...goodbye cow jumping over...
@POTUS @FoxNews my screenshot from tonight.  I the next press conference should be held at exclusion of #foxnews, u know...don't invite'em.
@POTUS @FoxNews Really? You're now talking about the presidential dookie? #crapping #trumpcrapping #trump #fakemedia #NOT #trumpiscrappiest https://t.co/ve0U0gFG6i
@Publia1920 well thank you...I think. Way to fi$cly conservative. Socially as left as it gets, but not w/ $$. Either way #ImpeachTrump
@GovMikeHuckabee you're a shill of a man. You would have never said this until you lost your backbone, to kiss the ring of @POTUS

@SenatorCardin then figure out a way to get Republican colleagues to stand up for freedom and not cower for fear of Tweets. It's ur job too
@StateDept @EngageState @doscareers wait...an actual SD presser? Be still my beating heart. Hopefully it will have substance, not rant/raves
@jrpsaki excellent article. Very candid, and non political. I don't like @realDonaldTrump but I don't want the Admin to fail, or we all do.
@decoartlover @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine oh good holy Moses on a Popsicle stick.  This is even more ridiculous than Trump's presser. Good laugh.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @FoxNewsInsider more fake news. Show the evidence, or move along. You're part of the problem here. NO EVIDENCE.
@SpeakerRyan it's time to rebuild your own country FIRST! Help the world, but help home first. Stop party bickering and make a change #fail
@HouseJudiciary @RepSteveChabot u worked hard on Clinton's impeachment 4 less. Please begin impeachment draft for Trump- Use Mark Painter!!!
@SenBobCasey yet the Senate still can't seem to agree that the AMERICAN PEOPLE want it investigated. Til u guys do it, it's all for not.
@StevenBogarat @mmpadellan thank god. The mere sound of her voice makes me want to carve out my eardrums with spoons. And that smile...ugh.
And by "them" I mean Trump...not  the media

@SenMarkey thank you for doing your part and fighting tonight. We appreciate you. Don't give up.
@Caitlinh24 @CNN then again, after spinal reconstructions, it's the only thing that has given me even a semblance of "normal" life.

@DevinNunes please please please launch an investigation re: the full scope of Russian communications with the new administration. Thank you
@ResistDJTrump @PrincessBravato you took the words right out of my earlier Tweet.
@latimes @realDonaldTrump and by that...I don't denounce the trouble at hand in NorCal. Be safe folks...
@latimes phew...I thought you were talking about @realDonaldTrump again. At least this is a natural storm...not a "fake" one. #fakenews
@CoryBooker @EPA @nytimes please keep up the fight. THIS nomination must not be approved. #fight #NoOnPruitt
@MortuaryReport but yea...I get it. The war has begun &amp; it's just like guns. Make them all illegal &amp; the only people who suffer, need them.

@amyklobuchar and by that, I mean "fake" news. #FightOn
@amyklobuchar thank you Senator. Beyond partisan lines Congress must voice opinions which matter to WE THE PEOPLE! Not election or fake news
@MoElleithee @JohnJHarwood @POTUS no words.
@morningmika oh no...it's a "fine-tuned machine." How dare you criticize [/sarcasm].
@Olivianuzzi my EXACT thoughts. Yet he claims the machine is fine-tuned. Yeesh.
@POTUS ur news conference was among the most despicable ever heard. The # of insults u made is not rep of WE THE PEOPLE #PresideNotDeride
@RaineyTime @jmartNYT @realDonaldTrump @pew @pewresearch 39%??? Seems awfully high, considering how little he has done.
@realDonaldTrump good holy Moses on a Popsicle stick. You're still on this? This is not making America great. #PresideNotDeride #GetToWork
@KellyannePolls @POTUS in other words, an automaton, a mouthpiece, a mindless cog. Stand up for the PEOPLE if u want to serve, not 1 man.
@realDonaldTrump while I doubt your integrity, you have unique opp to do what u claim was not done. Or do u fear findings? #kremlingate https://t.co/nmeqDqezG6
@SenJohnBarrasso you say the mess is the Dems to deal w/. You're wrong...it's EVERYBODY's. Stop bickering and laying blame. Find a solution!
@SenateRPC wait...but holding up a "qualified judge's" nomination for a year is any different? Stop bickering and govern for THE PEOPLE!
@nightmareair any tour announcements coming...or maybe even a single show in the Bay Area for a jonesin' fan?
@glennbeck ONLY way forward is with less divisive rhetoric from both sides; beliefs might b different but we are ALL Americans #togetherness

@FLOTUS good. Now shut your bully husband up and crawl back under the rock you came from #IllegitimatePresidency #IllegitimateFirstFamily

@deweylasv so...your blackened Islamic Xtian heart says that because I live in SJ I am responsible for this? Ur dumber than I thought! #haha
@deweylasv literally u r a sorry excuse for a Christian. Threatening a disabled man - and people wonder why we have a devide. #IslamicXtian
@rarle61188 I don't back people just by party. I have a conscience. #Trump has proven his worth, with is zilch. I hope he dies.
@deweylasv I think you need to see a therapist. Ur ignorance &amp; self-delusion is stunning. Fear not they make meds for people like u- suicide
@deweylasv ah there u go again w/ threats of violence. Not sure what rally u speak. I live in CA am disabled &amp; haven't left my house in days
@karolynprg @MortuaryReport @MsPackyetti @staywoke #CripTheVote. This has now made its way in to my lexicon. 	#CripsUnite - oh wait...
@deweylasv it is, and I will.
@MeetThePress -@KellyannePolls u are despicable. Pivot pivot pivot. I agree press is not always fair, but uv done ZERO &amp; cntnu spouting lies
@KellyannePolls @POTUS @VP @realDonaldTrump then you need to begin LISTENING &amp; speaking truths, not distorting for self-enhancement #NoLies
@bethrajohnston preach!
@deweylasv oh...but it's so much more fun schooling you and hanging out with your Islamic Christian Jihad.
What was it u said 2 weeks ago about lying &amp; resignation?	@seanspicer @PressSec #spicershouldresign #spicerlies #realtruth #numbersdontlie https://t.co/O8EJvD4hxW
@seanspicer @chayesmatthew @pfeiffer44 @BarackObama 	Um... POT = KETTLE. #spicershouldresign #spicerlies #nointegrity #liar #BeBetter
@deweylasv @MortuaryReport there's that Christian attitude again! Read ur threats above and stop using #christianityasacrutch like Islamists
@deweylasv @MortuaryReport Never said anything about my religion, nor claim to know u. Judging u only by ur actions. Or is that an #altfact?
@FyneLynn @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS uh...the MAJORITY, by nearly 3M votes, voted for someone else. The Electorate voted him in.
According to media, the Stealers aren't actually losing. More points have been scored than ever before, at least online . #alternatefacts
@Twitter curious to know if Twitter accounts has jumped significantly in last 2 weeks? #PresideDontDeride
@MortuaryReport indeed. My father helped craft it, and i am proud as fuck about it. It has helped, but we have a long way to go.
@deweylasv @MortuaryReport using "Christianity" as an excuse to hate is not repentance. UR God doesnt accept false confession. #xstiancrutch
@deweylasv @MortuaryReport wow. You showed us. You're as bad as Islamic Jihadists - "if they don't think like me, kill them."  #praisedalord
@rarle61188 Like I said...your educational lack is showing.  I'm a Republican, pissed that Trump spends his time whining. #PresideNotDeride
@rarle61188 my feelings won't be hurt. Just angry that President of the free world whines, complains &amp; is butthurt. #PresideNotDeride

@Reince it's no conspiracy to delegitimize this President. It's VERY out in open &amp; real. Are U feeling insecure too? #IllegitimatePOTUS https://t.co/0anYJVjG86
@realDonaldTrump why do you feel you have something (more) to prove? Illegitimate presidency is still presidency (for now) #PresideNotDeride
