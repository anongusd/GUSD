Addendum: @observer reporter @johnbonazzo has reached out to other media outlets to see how they're handling Nassar style. Stay tuned. https://t.co/KUabp6JdME
@rschallom @WSJSports I believe this is a matter of print story placement. If it runs in Sports, the honorifics-free Sports style prevails. If it's in News (as this story was), then athletes get honorifics (e.g. this @bzcohen a-hed): https://t.co/rSAOerZ8p9
@page88 I believe he remains ‚ÄúDr. Wakefield,‚Äù but looping @JeanneWhalen here.
It's a high bar of notoriety, but I think our coverage over the past year has shown that the change was merited. cc: @louiseradnofsky @BruceOrwall @melissakorn @Bachscore @jonesashby @TammyAudi @jasongay
In any case, as we neared publication last week, our editors decided that Nassar's crimes had been sufficiently horrific - affecting more than 200 women and girls, and their families - to merit dropping the "Dr."
(I should note that @WSJSports doesn't use honorifics, in keeping with sports style generally. It would be sort of weird to read a game story in which we say "Ms. O'Brien stole the ball from Mr. James." Not just because that's an unlikely occurrence.)
Losing an honorific is a big deal, a dishonor typically reserved for terrorists and mass murderers (bin Laden, McVeigh, Manson).
For months, we wavered between "Dr." and "Mr." As explained in this @WSJ Style and Substance blog post from February, some argued that keeping "Dr." was a "reminder of the trusted position he once held, and abused."  https://t.co/iMJiCVW3bH
Under @WSJ rules, medical doctors typically remain "Dr." on second reference, unless their actual academic degree is revoked. (Nassar's medical license was revoked earlier this year.)
A brief @WSJ style thread. Readers may have noticed a change in our story this weekend on McKayla Maroney and gymnastics sex abuse: Larry Nassar lost his honorific. He is no longer "Dr. Nassar," but "Nassar," on second reference.  https://t.co/9zg4Fd26Ss

AUSA Jacqueline Kasulis says of Shkreli: "What motivates Martin Shkreli is his own image...He can't just be an average person who fails, like the rest of us...He needs to be mythical, he needs to be larger than life. That image is his mansion, his Maserati."

Local papers don't just matter when they help break national news - Bridgegate, heroin, Penn State. They matter for the little stories.
The White House matters. But there are thousands of public officials across the US who may never have to answer to a single reporter.
