We agree. The Trump Administration hurts regular Americans and irreparably damages our publicly owned natural resources at Big Oil's request. @BOEM_DOI says it needs to continue this work for "Energy Dominance" but has stopped work on offshore wind. Oil clearly holds the reins.
Led by @SenMarkey &amp; @SenatorMenendez, they wrote, "While the oil industry might view a delay in the approval of new offshore drilling as an emergency, the American people deserve regulators who prioritize safety and environmental protection over the wishes of special interests."
14 U.S. Senators wrote to @BOEM_DOI demanding accountability for putting Big Oil's interests above those of the nation by fast tracking offshore drilling plans during the shutdown, harming federal workers, coastal communities, ocean life and the climate. https://t.co/iDqs3voKbw

.@EPAScottPruitt and @realdonaldtrump want to gut safety and quality standards for federal infrastructure to benefit big polluters. Unacceptable. #InfrastructureScam
The fate of 300+ at-risk wildlife and iconic species could hang in the balance under a #DirtyBudget that cuts 47% of funding for the endangered species listing program.
The #TrumpBudget cuts $273 million from NOAA’s program that studies sea-level rises, eliminates the Global Climate Initiative, and ends funding for NASA’s program that monitored the Earth via satellite - putting our communities at greater risk from the effects of climate change.
A budget that guts conservation programs puts the future of America’s public lands, parks, &amp; waters at risk. The #TrumpBudget would put Interior and National Park Service on the chopping block selling out our public lands and giving a free pass to corporate polluters.
Our simplest job in Congress is to keep American families safe. Passing a #DirtyBudget that slashes the EPA budget by 34%, gutting funding for clean water and air programs, betrays that promise. We must defend people, not polluters.
Americans cannot afford a budget that ignores the realities of our changing climate and guts any programs that protect our communities. The #TrumpBudget endangers the health of our families and our environment.
The health of our families is not something we should compromise on. And yet, the #DirtyBudget reveals who the White House is really trying to protect by funding for the Environmental Protection Agency after giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy.

President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement overwhelmingly harms the American people
It's our responsibility to ensure our children have a clean planet and the opportunity for a clean future
US withdrawal from the #ParisAgreement adversely impacts the lives and health of the 321 million people living in the country
Help preserve this breathtaking canyon system - Tell @Interior @SecretaryZinke to uphold protections for #BearsEars https://t.co/a8Fq8kXbey https://t.co/1KHrrVylnd
“Risk to Americans Act” would emphasize costs to industry over benefits to Americans, setting up a system designed to shortchange the public

Tell your Reps to vote NO on #CRA to overturn a rule to conserve &amp; protect wolves, grizzlies &amp; other wildlife on wildlife refuges in #Alaska
