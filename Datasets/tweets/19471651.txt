To understand the significance of Harris County (Houston) going undeniably blue for the second straight cycle, we are the largest county population wise in TX and the third largest in the nation with 5 million people
@greendoondoon @elonjames Precisely.....
Beto's loss had down ballot effects that will set the table for Texas Dems to make more gains in 2020.   But it can't be just Texas Black women leading the charge to flip Texas blue.  We voted 95% for Beto....White women?  59% for Cruz
And in my home county of Harris County, we had a blue tsunami that continued the blue wave started in 2016.  We won all 59 judicial races in Harris County.   A Latina in Lina Hidalgo is now our county's leader.   We got rid of our GOP vote suppressor.
Y'all need to chill with the Texas bashing because Beto lost.  Texas gained so much more.  Dems picked up 12 Texas House seats and 2 Texas Senate seats.  We flipped three US House seats....
@AshleeMPreston Ashlee...We flipped 12 Texas House seats an two Texas Senate seats.  We flipped three US House seats.  In Harris County (Houston), the third largest in the nation, 19 Black women got elected to judicial benches.  We got rid of our Republican vote suppressor.
@docrocktex26 @thegaf @angela_rye @rolandsmartin @BravenakBlog @lkherman @a_lwilliams We also got rid of Stan Stanart, our local GOP vote suppressor, installed Lina Hidalgo as our new Harris County judge, and flipped a US House seat that had been GOP held since the 70's
