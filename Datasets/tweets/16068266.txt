For purposes of congressional and Senate representation only, add DC to Maryland. Require all of DC be kept in one district, unless its population exceeds one CD, then there must be one 100% DC district, and the leftover all in one district.

@chrislhayes Welcome!!!!
Yes the culture warriors would have bucked, crying “how can this happen in America?,” but I bet the average social liberal doesn’t have that thirst to stamp out all dissent.
If the Dems had put up someone who could convincingly tell Christians “my party will not try to outlaw your way of life and code of conduct” Trump would have lost badly.
The perception, back in 2016, that the Dems would try to stamp out Christian schools that didn’t adopt to elite mores, drove millions to Trump.

...One class of assets the elites have is skills and intelligence. If you dedicate all your intelligence to helping JP Morgan make more money, you aren't sharing what God gave you...

Thank God Gsellman got the save. A win for DeGrom, who deserves at least 10 more Ws than the Mets have given him.
DeGrom completed 7 innings. 3 hits and 1 walk. 1 earned run. 28th straight start allowing 3 runs or fewer. What a hoss.
The broader moral was taught me by a friend in Sept 2015 when I was sure the Mets would tank. He explained that the only way to enjoy baseball was to enjoy the moment, never to worry about the future or the big picture.
Jacob DeGrom this year has been such a pleasure to follow. By Mid-May I had given up on the season, so I just followed the highlights, Syndergaard, Wheeler, Nimmo, but mostly the calm mastery of DeGrom. What a stud.
Anthony Rendon is 2-for-23 against DeGrom.

@forewit I seriously doubt that applies to Lake Michigan.
This map, for instance, suggests that the 100-mile border zone only covers 100 miles from the actual US border, and thus doesn't cover Chicago as the ACLU &amp; friends assert. https://t.co/Iodj85CyF0 https://t.co/Oy5y41l0jp

@WretchedEsq Then it wld be 100 miles from every intl airport, which no one is claiming.

@TheStalwart Though I guess Trump has proven better at tapping into that Strongman-to-Fill-the-Void sentiment than any Democrat has.
@TheStalwart The growth of the central government erodes community ties and sows distrust, thus leading to calls for more government, and so on. Thus weakens the appeal of politicians promising less government.

@dmozenne @JeffMfromSC On a Mercator projection, I think it would look like a sine curve, starting flattish, getting steepest at the equator, and flattening out and turning up at the antipode.
I say "would," because there are anomalies in Colorado's border https://t.co/zVRBf41rze
So it's northern and southern borders would really be curves--circle segments. And it's northern border would be shorter than its southern border.

@binarybits I think my straight line vehicle works by a force-field tether to the center of the earth.
To go "due east," that is, to stay at the same latitude, is really to keep a steady distance from the North Pole. You'd have to steadily curve to the left.
You'd cross the equator off the coast of Liberia, cross Australia, and then come back up to the monument....
If you stood at the Wash. Monument &amp; faced yourself due East and managed to go perfectly straight (say you had a vehicle that could reckon this), you would find yourself eventually kind of going southeast.
On Earth, going "due East" or "due West" is never going in a straight line unless you're on the equator...

The solstice just happened. The sun turned the corner. It's now coming back north towards us.
Trepo is a Greek verb meaning to turn, like turning a corner, or a chariot turning around a post. What happens today at 1:38 local time in Chile--the solstice--is the trepo that gives the tropics their name.
It's got to do with the solstice. The tropics are where that point-of-direct sunlight in its yearlong spiral up and down the middle of the planet, *turns* around...
...but he word's roots have nothing to do with climate. Tropical, literally, of course, means between the Tropic of Capricorn and Tropic of Cancer. Why are they called "tropics"?
A lexical note, minutes from the solstice: It's hard not to think of "tropical" as meaning "warm, beaches, colorful birds, citrus...."
Footnote for east coasters: The solstice’s proximity to noon today is a coincidence. We happen to be nearly due north of the solstice point this year.
So not only does the Solstice have a date, it has a time and a precise location, too.
Today at 11:28 eastern, that spot will hit its southernmost point—right around Antofagasta, Chile.
But it slowly moves north or south, too. In a spiral. For 6 months it has been spiraling down.
...that is, a plumb, vertical pole at that point would cast no shadow at all. That dot obviously goes east to west over the course of a day....
One way to think of the solstice is to imagine a dot traveling around the earth at the point where the sun shines directly.
Seattle today will have 8:25:28 of daylight	NYC: 9:15:16 of daylight	DC: 9:26:21	Miami: 10:31:49		This is (by a second or two) the least daylight of the year. Tomorrow, you will have (a second or two) more daylight than today.

...instead of a mere personal promise, make this loving commitment (that is the context for sex) a public thing—a promise to the community.
...now you’re thinking “men suck. How could you trust their commitment?” Fair. There’s no magic fix. But some things could help. ...

@MTMehan I think this is the theme of the Weinstein/Etc stuff too. Do you see power as license or actually as a constraint?
@MTMehan So most people (even barely religious) trust religious people more. One needs to see that trust as a burden more than a license.

@economistified @mattdpearce @SopanDeb Yes. I believe Trump happened because of the dissolution of civil society. The American Dream is there where social capital is high.
@mattdpearce Largely, but maybe not mostly. Occupy Wall Street was a flare-up of a deep desire for political action, but focussed overly on natl issues.
@mattdpearce @SopanDeb Even that is very narrow in a harmful way if he means lobbying Congress. The centralization of our civic attention is very harmful.
@mattdpearce @SopanDeb It's pretty obnoxious. But also kind of close to something true. If he takes a broader definition of "political action" I'd agree.

Boom. Obama nails it: "... People don't have some of the same habits of being together on a common project that they used to..."
Obama now bringing up the decline mediating institutions and voluntary organizations. Channelling Robert Putnam now...
When Obama talks about civic engagement, he goes immediately to "voice." That's important, but it's not the POINT of of community engagement
This panel discusses civic engagement, but so far there's a hole. For most of America, the local church is the nexus of civic engagement.
@RWBhandari I don't really think there are national solutions to this promise.
Tiffany Brown, now a pharmacist, points out that a job as a youth provides not only money, but "different experiences."
Ayanna Watkins: "The youth feel like they don't have a voice." Man is a political animal. Erosion of civil society is the reason.
Obama is talking about falling civic disengagement. I think this is the central story of America in 2017. It explains Trump.
