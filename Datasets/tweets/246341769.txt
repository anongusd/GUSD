(1/3) Today, #Idaho and America remember the 3,000 innocent men and women who lost their lives 17 years ago. We must never forget the first responders who rushed into the burning buildings to save others but were never able to come home.

Last night’s horrendous attack in Boise was pure evil. I encourage Idahoans to come together in prayer for the victims’ recovery and in support of their families and loved ones.
Images of children separated from parents are heartbreaking. What I find more heartbreaking is the entire humanitarian crisis at the border. The root of the crisis is lax enforcement of our immigration laws. More in my op-ed @IdahoStatesman: https://t.co/QxvZ5DDMdN

(2/2) Everything that’s happened since then has proven that to be true. @realDonaldTrump is putting together a smart strategy to make America and the world safer, and I fully support him. #Iran
(1/2) @realDonaldTrump is absolutely right to withdraw from the #Iran nuclear deal. I opposed the deal when President Obama submitted it to Congress in 2015 because I believed it would empower the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism to acquire the world’s deadliest weapon.

#FISAMemo shows real collusion between Dem operatives &amp; key officials at the FBI &amp; DOJ to spy on the #Trump campaign &amp; interfere in the 2016 election. The politicization of our intelligence &amp; law enforcement agencies should concern every American. More: https://t.co/ajJzczgB78
@TheJohnsonPost @AngryNIdaho Nothing you could ever say would hurt my feelings. However, I did not suggest I was his successor, just that he and I agreed on the issue. I have enjoyed very good relationships in Congress with Democrats who fight for civil liberties and privacy.
@AlanPartridgeII @AngryNIdaho @TheJohnsonPost Look at the previous article about Nikki Hailey from Newsweek. If you are going to jump in a conversation, at least follow the thread.
@MikeJinID That’s funny, you’re trying to help me. I guess I missed that angle.
@AlanPartridgeII @AngryNIdaho @TheJohnsonPost I did.
@AngryNIdaho @TheJohnsonPost Read the article, it explains everything we have done. And here’s another one that says what the administration is planning to do. You really need to start doing your own research. I can’t do it all for you. https://t.co/M7O9S3XUPW
@AngryNIdaho @TheJohnsonPost Obama didn’t think they were much of a geopolitical threat. Our party does and has done something about it unlike the last administration. Stop just listening to MSNBC. https://t.co/D3BY99Knpz
@MikeJinID You keep trotting out the Russian bot nonsense. It’s been discredited. Just because you keep repeating it doesn’t make it true.
@AngryNIdaho @TheJohnsonPost It was a bipartisan vote for reauthorization. I strongly opposed it in committee and on the floor. It is sad that the party of Frank Church is defending the weaponization of the FBI’s intelligence gathering apparatus against political opponents.
@AngryNIdaho @TheJohnsonPost I voted against it. I wanted reform and have been consistently on the side of Frank Church on these issues.
@TheJohnsonPost Thank you, you are condescending as always. In the mean time, I will leave this article here to remind you that your party once had a proud history of questioning the FBI and worrying about FISA abuses. https://t.co/3y4jeVkdrY

@erpforidaho @KevinRichert I thought this was an issue I could work on with you and your party.  So not clear why you would have a negative reaction to it.
@erpforidaho @KevinRichert I did watch it. I enjoyed it. It seems like you might be the one politicking.
@clamberson I have always been frank and direct with my constituents and with the press.
@MikeJinID You are not very bright are you. Maybe your obsession with Russia is messing with your brain cells. You really should read the article because I don’t think it means what you think it means.
@MikeJinID What faux pas? Maybe you should read the article before you comment. All legislators voted for the bill because they were promised that it would have no cost. I didn’t take a position against the system just against the insider deal that lead to the contract.
@inkedtater You mean, Mark Penn, the democratic pollster. He usually pushes in your direction so this is doubly bad for your position.
Read the full Harvard-Harris poll here: https://t.co/tkutSqjXCs  Congress should vote on the Securing America’s Future Act. #PassSAF
79% want secure borders rather than open borders (the Securing America's Future Act strengthens our borders &amp; makes America safer)
60% say #DACA beneficiaries should NOT be given preference to bring their relatives to the US (the Securing America's Future Act won’t give them preference)
79% think #immigration should be based on skills rather than family ties (the Securing America's Future Act transitions to a merit-based system &amp; ENDS chain migration)
68% oppose the Visa Lottery (the Securing America's Future Act gets rid of it)
More from poll: 65% of Americans support a deal 4 #DACA that ENDS Chain Migration, ELIMINATES the Visa Lottery, &amp; SECURES the border with a wall. My bill, the Securing America's Future Act, does ALL those things. In fact, it's the ONLY bill in Congress that does ALL those things.
58% of Americans opposed Dems' decision to shut down govt over #DACA, says Harvard-Harris poll. Their poll shows Americans want strong, fair #immigration reform &amp; the concepts contained in my bill, the Securing America's Future Act. Bill Summary here: https://t.co/UqwsX670NF
@Grwiggy01 @TheJohnsonPost @politico I am as sympathetic as my constituents. That’s why I want to fix the issue and also prevent it from happening again. That is the majority position in the United States and overwhelming majority in Idaho. Enforcement + Compassion is what I support.
@EricDahlinger Very persuasive!
@AngryNIdaho @BetterIdaho That’s not true but keep telling yourself that.
@BetterIdaho 60 votes needed in the Senate, but you knew that. Even the liberal media has corrected Democrats on this point. And I did misspell it, though, so I will correct it. #SchumerShutdown
@FCodeley @TheJohnsonPost @politico I do - so far, no evidence of collusion. But nice try changing the subject.
@TheJohnsonPost @politico According to you, a person is only a legislator if they vote according to your wishes. We are willing to deal with the DACA population which many Republicans were unwilling to do just 2 years ago.  We have moved, it’s time your side move as well.
@TheJohnsonPost @politico Apparently restating the law makes you a nativist. It’s a simple statement of the law. All people in the United States without documentation accrue unlawful presence from the moment they turn 18.  I know Democrats don’t like the law, but that is the law.
@WhipHoyer Schumer offered authorizing, not funding the wall. There was no deal reached. Stop lying to the American people.  #SchumerShutdown
@steve_rostron Not really a party issue. Support for the 60 vote rule is strong among the longer serving members of both parties. Seems like the more traditionalist members of both parties want to keep the rule and the less traditionalist members want to change it.
@AsshatDrumpf @AngryNIdaho @craighdurham @GOP @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Yes, I would be. I have advocated for it the whole time I have been in Congress, even when Reid was the majority leader.
@steve_rostron I have always said this
@AngryNIdaho @craighdurham LOL if you think that it wouldn’t be much easier to get 50 votes than 60 votes.
@Kluskee @craighdurham Funny - I didn’t call for a partisan solution. I called for a solution that requires 50 votes. It seems that you are calling for partisan solutions. Think about the logical conclusions of your comments before you call people names.
@craighdurham 50-49, with McCain not voting and McConnell voting no for procedural reasons. Try doing research before you comment. Google is easy to use.
It’s time to change the rules in the Senate (go nuclear) or to force Senators to speak on the floor to sustain a filibuster. The filibuster is not a veto. Senate disfunction must end.  The Constitution does not require 60 votes in the Senate. #makethemspeak https://t.co/qsZ6eTfvKF

@RedState This is not true. Freedom Caucus previously opposed the bill. We took no new position tonight. Our position has not changed.
@RonJohnIdaho Phase three requires 60 votes in the senate. If that is possible, why not do it now?
@RonJohnIdaho The bill does not include allowing purchasing across state lines. It's one of the reasons I oppose it.
@GlenBennett12 I did. We have introduced a plan that would help the President keep the promises he made.
@Sir_napsalot @c5hardtop1999 Since we are not fully repealing, regulatory changes will be limited by the mandates in Obamacare.
LABRADOR: Our goal is to reduce the costs of healthcare for every American. This bill doesn’t do that. #CWC115
LABRADOR: If we truly believe our ideas will make America better, we need to get behind them 100% instead of playing defense. #CWC115
LABRADOR: Conservatives should scrutinize military spending as closely as we scrutinize other spending. #CWC115
LABRADOR: The President’s first offer shows he’s serious about balancing the budget.
LABRADOR: The first question of budgeting is: If you’re going to increase spending in one area, where will you cut?
LABRADOR: In 2010, members won on our promise to repeal Obamacare. When the Republican Party forgets what they campaigned on, we lose seats.
LABRADOR: We’re 100% behind @POTUS, but steps 2 &amp; 3 of the 3 step process won’t work. The only chance is step 1.
LABRADOR: There’s no natural constituency for the #AHCA except for Washington insiders, but I believe it can be fixed w/ fundamental changes

@ursus_marit It's not, that was not prohibited by the EO.
@MikeJinID You haven't tweeted a single thought espoused by the Republican Party ever. But congrats on being a registered Republican.
My advice to #POTUS - attack the decision (it's weak) not the judge. Liberals are imploding, don't make personal attacks the story.
Read Judge Robart's order. Zero analysis showing how plaintiffs would prevail on merits. Just analysis of irreparable harm. Pretty weak!
