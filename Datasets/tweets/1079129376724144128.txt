@TomiLahren @moretrash4me He is talking about the thousands of sex trafficked children that run though his state. Instead of saving them, he is inspiring them to work harder. The problem starts at the top and his donations probably come from those proceeds.
@SpeakerPelosi @TylerFlorence @paulaleduc @WCKitchen BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL. Stop the trafficking of 10,00 children every year that cross our borders and flood our state.

@CalebJHull No way. Any real Trump supporter knows that It‚Äôs never been about a wall. It‚Äôs about American citizenship meaning something and once a for all ending the human trafficking, drugs, crime and the senseless deaths of migrants. You can call the wall anything you want!
@SenKamalaHarris It‚Äôs a disgrace how our congress can‚Äôt pass a budget on time but still collects a paycheck when 800 people they represent can‚Äôt. You should pass laws to better govern the senate and mandate that a budget has to be done in September and then follow the law!

You people need to stop getting paid and an investigation needs to be open to fix your inability to pass budgets!
@SenatorBennet You should have passed a budget back in September of last year. Now you want to open the government for three weeks? Google have another trip planned for you? Do your job and pass the budget. Only 7 months left in this year and your still working on last year! Shame on you!
@PattyMurray The country has been shut down for 34 days, why didn‚Äôt you use that time to have conversations? Stop going on trips! Do your job!
