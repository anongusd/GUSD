@kkondik the exit poll was approve 53/46 in ohio!
@kkondik but i think iowa's a weird case. i think i can imagine someone justifying calling iowa a tossup, lean R, or likely R! there's a big spread in the evidence. but ohio? what's a positive indicator for dems there?
@kkondik idk there's plenty of evidence that trump's approval is underwater in iowa, perhaps even significantly, and not really much of a case that it's above water. there's plenty of evidence that trump's approval is above water in ohio, and not much to show it's significantly below

That's logical given the conditions you'd need for a third party win (can't do it with anything lower than appx. 34-33-32 in the national vote, after all), and it lines up with the one time we've seen a third party bid tied or ahead
Of course, we haven't had many vigorous third party bids. 	But it makes sense to me that you'd want to see *both* Trump approval and likely Dem nominee favorability under at least 35, and probably lower, before there was a real opening
(I would also argue that Schultz is not as well positioned to take advantage of whatever opening exists as Perot was, but that's a separate question)
We got a glimpse of conditions that yield a viable third party bid in 1992, when Perot was tied or even ahead in polls ahead of the DNC.	Here, CBS/NYT in 6/92: B32, P30, C24	Bush app: 34%	Clinton fav/unfav: 16/40	Perot fav/unfav: 26/20 	By all measures, status quo less conducive

Same story, but for those following at home the most recent counties to wrap up have been a bit better for Espy, but he's basically still looking at mid-single digits at best, if Jackson/Delta turnout proves stronger than what we've seen from majority black areas so far https://t.co/4f3CazpWo2
And here's a quick look of what we've seen RE: turnout so far. Not much out of majority black counties, but none of it is keeping up with the more robust returns from white areas https://t.co/el38jeGb7t
And as the turnout picture shapes up, Espy appears to run even farther behind his 'true' targets than the ALSEN based targets we started with. Mid-single digits with an ALSEN-like turnout can quickly turn into an 8 point defeat or worse if the turnout picture isn't so favorable
In general, CHS enjoying a stronger turnout in white areas than Roy Moore did, but Espy not as obviously getting a higher turnout than Jones in black areas (though fewer black counties completed).	Probably relatedly, CHS also running ahead of an ALSEN baseline in white areas
And looking at the big picture, you get the same thing. Espy just generally not quite hitting what he'd need to get over the top https://t.co/DZWeB74A6m
Now we're up to 7 completed counties. Generally representative. 	Take them together: Espy at 46% there v. a target of 49%. 	Over all: lean CHS, mid-single digit advantage
We have two more completed counties--polar opposites: Tishmingo (white, Appalachia) and Coahoma (Delta, 70% black). 	A decent pair of results for CHS.	Coahoma is right in line with a ALSEN-based est for a tie, but Tishmingo stronger for CHS both in terms of turnout and support
We do have two completed counties now, though: Benton and Amite. 	Very small counties, but collectively the result there is right on line with the target for a tied race, though I'll note that elsewhere in the state CHS is generally running ahead of the target https://t.co/IOq9tVQfr5
Deleted a tweet about Hancock county which erroneously said the vote was done there. It's not, which is not a minor issue here especially when it comes to turnout
Still nothing at 100%, but updating this chart it does seem pretty hard to find anywhere far along in the county where Espy is really beating the 'target' 	The catch, though, is it's mainly GOP-tilting areas and this doesn't account for turnout, which could be more favorable https://t.co/lps0bgEO8t
We're 95% of the way to the ALSEN based est in DeSoto with 92% reporting it, and we're already over it in Warren w/91% reporting
It does seem to me, for what it's worth, that we're on track for turnout to exceed these AL-SEN based estimates (though again you really can't say until counties finish)
The other thing I'd note, though, is that the 'target' I'm using here is mainly based on the Alabama Senate race. Can certainly imagine an Espy road that involves even higher black turnout than in AL (which was very very good), and weaker performance in white rural areas
Taking the broader view besides Warren/Desoto, I'd still argue that Espy is running a few points behind his targets. But again, who knows what a Dem win looks like here, turnout is quite uncertain, and the picture within county is pretty tough due to racial segregation https://t.co/ZGXgjMJ8mS
As far as I'm concerned, we're basically in wait and see mode until we get a handful of completed counties. 	In the mean time, the enlarged CHS margin in DeSoto and narrow Espy lead in Warren are cause for cautious GOP optimism. But you can't say much until you're at 100% here
Two caveats for this and for the whole evening tbh: 1) who knows what a MS D win looks like anymore; 2) it's hard to interpret early MS results within a county bc of racial polarization.	But I'd put the magic number for Epsy in DeSoto at 43-44. So it's an interesting first result
We've got some early results out of DeSoto--Memphis exurbs/burbs--and it's interesting. Epsy at 47% of the vote with 10/39 precincts counted.

critical macomb county https://t.co/8FYlDK8mPB
Basically, I think it would have been nice (strictly for this purpose) if we had polled Indiana at the end. We didn't in part because our reporting indicated Braun was ahead, which meant that the Senate wasn't interesting. Then Marist/Fox had late polls showing Donnelly up
To take one high-profile example: we're basically the only public poll that had Blackburn ahead (+14) by more than her eventual margin of victory (+12). One of our least accurate polls was a GOP-biased poll in MN08. Overall, no bias in polls of states where polls were D in '16
It's a little hard for me to look at this in our own polls, mainly because they're CD level. But tbh I don't really see much evidence of the same pattern in the upper-right (we did underestimate Dems in the southwest, tho)

Still strikes me as a 'floor,' though given the 395 voters in the 'insufficient oath information' which was previously (perhaps erroneously) reported to include YOB cases
I can get down from 480 to 400 with voters who successfully cured their ballot in-person in early voting; presumably the rest would need to be on election day.
The only basis for the difference, that I can think of, is that 40% of these people successfully cured their ballots in-person and on election day, which seems possible I guess
@ByTylerEstep @bluestein @conorsen still don't understand where the estimate comes from. difficult to reconcile with the publicly available absentee data on rejected ballots there in GA7/Gwinnett.
@bluestein @conorsen none of these figures involve the yob mail ballots?
@bluestein @conorsen where does that number come from
With Woodall's lead down to around 500, and these ballots expected to break overwhelmingly to Dems, the difference between 400 and 800 ballots in this category is pretty significant
I don't really see support for the estimate in the absentee file, which, as I interpret it, implies there are no fewer than 480 ballots in this category and potentially hundreds more. But I could be wrong
Is there anyone out there who understands the origin of the estimate that there are only ~400 absentee ballots to be reconsidered in Gwinnett in GA-7?  @conorsen @bluestein

@achambersgop where do you get 411
looks like those tallies ticked up to 1181 and 329 in the final absentee update
@thejimhobart link?
By our estimates, these 1048 voters were likely to be &gt;70% for Democrats, based on their demographic characteristics. And it's possible/likely that the absentee vote was stronger for Democrats than their demographic characteristics (common feature of early voting)
Should note that I last pulled the absentee file the day before the election. So there's a chance it's a bit higher now.
There were 1048 rejected absentee ballots in GA7. 	Hard to tell how many due to birth year. About half are 'insufficient oath information,' which could include birth year. 285 are explicitly 'yob missing'
The absentee ballot birthdate decision in Gwinnett + remaining provisional ballots keep GA07 very interesting. Best Dem shot at a 40th seat

Also GOP erosion in south-central PA (york/dauphin/lancaster/cumberland) is easy to overlook, but it's part of a long term trend and it could be a real issue the GOP going forward
Dems came closest to putting it all together in PA. They got their suburban margins. Western Pennsylvania was great for Dems in gov/sen/pa16 house. NE PA was ok for GOP, but not great like IL12/MN8/northern Ohio/rural mich
Dems had some decent showings in farm-belty parts of the Midwest (IA, KS, SD, nw OH), but had mediocre to outright bad showings in traditionally Dem, old industrial/union parts of the Midwest. Metro areas pretty bad for GOP across region, of course
Top me, this is pretty scary for Democrats. If you assume it's similar in CD25, you could be talking about a 10 pt shift among 10% of the state electorate. And that happens to roughly line up with the GOP overperformance, compared to Trump, in Miami-Dade
In our polls:	FL26, Clinton+16: Trump -5, Mucarsel-Powell+1 (result, DMP+2)	FL27, Clinton+20: Trump -11, Shalala+7 (result, Shalala+6)
Anyway, we'll need to get back the voter file data to untangle the turnout question. If it's not turnout, it's a real 2020 challenge for Dems. Florida was only so close bc of Dem strength in Miami-Dade. If it's going to be tough for Dems to match Clinton, FL will be tougher
There was quite a bit of polling this cycle showing Trump/Fla. GOP doing better among Florida Hispanics than expected. Our own polls in FL-26/FL-27 showed Trump approval looking strong, compared to 2016, and basically nailed the congressional race
It's possible that when we get the voter file back that we'll conclude that the Democratic turnout here was weak, despite the high overall turnout. 	It is also possible that we'll conclude that the GOP is looking better among Cuban voters, and maybe Fla. Hispanics more generally
In a lot of ways, Democrats did what they needed to do to win Florida. That Pinellas margin should be good enough. The Seminole/Duval wins are really impressive.	Orange/Osceloa were bound to be bad for Dems in a midterm, I'd say.	But I wouldn't say Miami-Dade was inevitable
Clinton win Miami-Dade by 29; Obama won it by 23; in 2014, an overall bad year for Democrats, Crist won it by 19 with a turnout of just 521k.	At the moment, Nelson and Gillum are up just 21 points with turnout at 800k
I think one of the most important, outstanding questions about this election, with big implications for 2020, is what went wrong for Democrats in Miami-Dade County

It is possible, of course, that this will turn out to be a machine error, and the votes are recovered in a recount. We'll see!

@nickgourevitch doubt they do it because it would involve acknowledging how off the old data was, but it would be a real service
These biases should be significantly lower now. But if you compare this year's numbers to 2016, you see a huge surge in Dem support among col+ voters. This is a phantom shift. The old exits were underestimating Clinton in '16, and now they're not   	https://t.co/rfxdigcTri
So take 2016. They had too many college educated voters, but they had to match the reality of Clinton+2. So what happened? A severe underestimation of Clinton's strength among col+ voters to cancel out the overrepresentation of col+ voters
The overrepresentation of college educated voters in the pre-18 exit poll (including 16) basically skewed all of their demographic numbers, since the exits were weighted to match the result, even though the underlying demographics were off
As a result of the methodological change, the college educated share of the electorate in the exit poll is 10 pts lower than 2014. In reality, this was a better educated electorate, but the exit polls were just that biased by this measure before.
As I've said a million times, the exit polls have long been biased towards having too many well-educated and young voters. This year, they've made changes to try and fix this.
Caution to analysts who use exit polls: many big shifts in this year's exit polls are due to methodological changes, not just actual changes among voters

Catching up on last night's vote count. The late mail ballot margins put Democrats on track for victory in all of CA39, CA45, and CA10, supposing those margins continue, as expected. 	Won't be called for a while, but might not even be all that close in some of these races
On top of that, there are a lot of late ballots in California that are probably going to be really good for Democrats. Maine ranked choice promises to be decent for Democrats. Very easy to imagine ending at D+38/39 in the House at this point
Neither of these races are over. Got to keep counting the vote in Arizona. We'll see whether the Broward undervote turns out to be a machine error. 	But no matter how it shakes out, it does seem like a better Senate finish for Dems than the immediate post-election hot take
Meanwhile, if Scott (R) holds on in Florida it seems like there's an increasing chance that it will be by the margin of Broward County's incompetent ballot design (even as Broward County's incomptent vote count gives the impression of helping Dems, by being slow)

Based on my replies, it seems like I'm only confusing people. Two points:	--I know literally nothing about how much vote is left	--However, I am not surprised more votes were counted, and you can tell because it's what we projected at the time we unplugged the needle, yesterday
It was entirely possible that there were no ballots left. There could also be even more. I know nothing.	What I'm saying: these new ballots are mainly bringing turnout in south Florida into alignment with expectations
It should be noted that the '100k' was an extremely rough guess. We had/have no special knowledge. What we know is that, historically, a county will seem done but there's really a lot left to come. We try and guess when there's more, based on turnout to that point v. expected
To be clearer: as of 2pm yesterday, we thought there were still 100k ballots left in South Florida, because the reported vote to that point didn't seem high enough (given the turnout elsewhere in the state/country)
I understand why the late ballots in Florida seem like a surprise. But when we turned off the needle yesterday, it seemed like there just wasn't enough counted in south Florida; turned it off w/Scott having virtually no edge at all https://t.co/zpBcwqOels
New Orange County ballots quickly drop Walters (CA-45) lead down to 2, from 3.2 this morning. Given how many ballots are left, this might not be close in the end.

And since the turnout was higher, I'd guess the late vote will be even better for Democrats than it was in the primary. Our poll supported that too. But I don't know that for sure; we'll just have to wait and see
This is, of course, the classic pattern in CA mail returns, as it was in the primary. In the primary, final result was a net-3.2 points to the left of the initial returns. 	Today, Walters leads by 3.2 points.
In CA45, for instance. Walters leads first 107k mail votes counted by 5 pts. But there might be a solid 100k left or maybe more and it's very clear that the late ballots were rapidly trending to the left. DK if it's enough for Porter, but it'll get very, very close at least https://t.co/jNmXq6ww4a
For what it's worth, I personally would bet on Democrats to dominate the remaining CA vote, given what our polls said about the late vote there, the voter file data on the early v. late VBM, and the fact that the GOP did terribly in well-educated Sun Belt CDs everywhere
We actually did have plans to avoid this in Orange County with precinct returns that disaggregated vote by method. We had similar plans in VA/KY/GA/NC/FL/MN. Unfortunately, none of our precinct feeds materialized (part of our initial technical delays)
In the mail ballot states, like AZ/CA, the needle has no special knowledge of the potential biases in the outstanding vote v. reported.
I will note, though, that the needle closed believing that Scott only had a 53% chance of winning, by a margin of &lt; .1 points. It believed there were a lot of votes left in Broward/Miami-Dade, and that seems to be materializing
At this stage, the needle is not much smarter than anything else. It has some rough guesses about outstanding vote, mainly by looking at where it looks like there's not enough vote. But at this point, you really just want some reporting on where the vote is left
The needle is off, and it's not going back on https://t.co/p0n0hbT4Iz

Seems like there are conflicting vote counts in TX-23, with AP/TX SOS differing from at least Edison, which still has Hurd ahead slightly.	No matter how you cut it though, there's no basis for a projection
Texas 23 uncalled; with 100% reporting, Gina Ortiz Jones has a nominal lead over Will Hurd. Would be a major upset	https://t.co/vsRrFZRrtu
We also automatically peg the needle to 100% at an AP call. But if it looks like it wouldn't have ever supported a call
For those curious, we automatically take AP calls in most cases. But obviously we're uncalling this
Now 100% reported and Ortiz Jones retains the lead. Obviously merits a retraction https://t.co/vsRrFZRrtu
Oh, nope! I take it back: AP had that county as 1/8 precincts reporting; in fact, 7/8. 	So with 99% reporting and only 1 precinct in a heavily Republican county left, Ortiz Jones still ahead
Looks to me like Hurd will still eek it out though, thanks to Medina County

a lot of debugging later... i think we're ready
Basically, the pattern so far--greater polarization--was the GOPs ticket to a good night in the Senate and close race for the House, as I wrote on Monday. 	But this gets GOP to a closer race, not to a majority without *more* strength than they have so far 	https://t.co/Qfq7xOSfQn
That said, these early results in the Northeast/Midwest don't look horrible for Democratic chances in those districts. And Dem strength in VA2/7/FL26 all should make Dems feel ok about the suburban districts that represent the key to their path
But now we're coming up to the Midwest/Northeast. Here's where there were *a lot* of races where Dems were clearly favored.	So if GOP outperforms now, it's a lot more threatening to the Democrats
So, as I look at the southeast in isolation, I would still see the Dems on track to take the House. Not D+40. But more like our polls, which added up to D+32 with a ton of super close races.
VA2 and VA7 may also be big trouble for the Republicans, but hard to tell without precinct data.
That isn't to say that, overall, things are in line. I'm not sure about that--flying blind w/technical issues. But in the tossups of the southeast--which I'd say are somewhere between like 27 and 40 on the Dem pickup list--it's not that different and Curbelo seems in big trouble
The southeastern US included *very* few of the races where the Dems really were clear favorites. There was VA10/FL27, but after FL26/VA02/VA07/KY06 were sort of on the back half of the tossups. At the moment, all of those districts look close and basically in line w/forecasts
Instead, we get the piece-meal, district by district battle where the GOP basically has to run the table in a lot of districts.
What's the consequence of this? Well, the "big" dem map always supposed being able to breakthrough in a long list of red districts. That may yet happen, but so far it's tough to see
Well, technical difficulties persist on the needle. But the basic outline of the night seems to be clear: A rehash of the 2016 election, but with more Democratic strength.
Spanberger down in VA-7, but almost all the remaining vote is from Democratic-leaning *counties.* Don't know from where, though https://t.co/nI3Vablpto
Kind of flying blind a bit right now, but I basically see the Democrats hitting expectations well-educated suburbs but the GOP outperforming expectations in more conservative areas
Well. We have issues over here. Don't know when we'll have something.
Another strong GOP election day in Florida gets Scott pretty near where he wants to be in most of the Florida peninsula, but not in a lot of urban areas. Urban areas, though, mainly early vote. To what extent Dems keep up urban strength in the Election Day vote = key.
I don't see anything that indicates a systematic forecasting error. From here, the GOP just needs a ton of luck. Scratch out 1, 2, 3 point wins, over and over.
We've got a lot of early vote so far. Need to see some more electon day vote. But I don't have any good news for Republicans hoping for a big polling error or to hold the House
On the other hand, Scott pulling off some decent numbers in basically every other county. Perhaps the urban-rural split is just going to keep getting a bit deeper.
Nelson's 7 point margin in Pinellas County, Fla. early/abs vote is not a good sign for Scott.
So far, Braun faring quite well in rural areas. If Donnelly is going to win this, and obviously he totally could given the way I'm about to describe it: he might have to do it t supercharged suburban margins way beyond what he's pulled off before
At the moment, the over all GOP registration edge is down to about 1.4 points, which is a bit better for the Dems than the voters who voted in '16 and remain registered here, and it's about what polls would have put it out (though i admittedly haven't checked what our own est)
(this is also about Pinellas County)
The Election Day vote is still good for the GOP. It's at R+5.6 at this point, v. a slight Dem edge in early voting. 	But Democrats have been steadily narrowing the GOP election day edge throughout the day, and the Dems have been winning the last hour or so
One thing is clear. The turnout is way higher than anyone could expect. 	Take one example: Pinellas County--St. Petersburg, Fla., a battleground state where presidential turnout is quite high.	The turnout with some time still to go is up to 87% of the 2016 election
In a lot of these contests with only a handful of counties, it doesn't have the ability to learn as much about what's outstanding based on what's already reported as we would in other settings
Before we get going, I want to note that the individual House needles are, in general, not so smart. This is not like a Senate/presidential race, when we can draw on a bunch of data from nearly finished or completed counties elsewhere in the contest
The polls are closed in Kentucky 6. 	The overall House needle will rise when it has enough information to make a characterization https://t.co/fzVPDfgOEq
not fair https://t.co/8Li62Kp1cu
(though he might be...)
Well, congrats folks. Until this, there had only been one prior poll with Beto within 2 since mid-Sept.  He's closing!
lol i clearly need to weight this poll by... something
a Beto win is included in Cruz&lt;2
There haven't been many Texas polls recently. So here's one:	What's the final result in Texas Senate?
This doesn't guarantee our polls are right. Turnout is only one source of error.
In the end, anything can still happen on Election Day. But in terms of where I'd want the numbers to be today, I wouldn't for much more on the party reg breakdown.
This depends, of course, on whether election day patterns hold. For instance, in FL we're ~R+1 and the EV is D+.5, but the GOP usually wins election day. In CO06, we're even and the EV is R+1, but the Dems usually win election day, and so on.
I do have to say I feel good about the partisan makeup of our projected electorate at the moment in the major states/CDs where we're far enough to really tell, like the OC, FL, NV, AZ, WA8, CO06, etc. In these spots, we've got a real shot to be &lt;1 pt on the avg party split
It's worth noting that getting partisan balance right is more important. But depending on the area, there's upside for either side in higher turnout. In general, Dems benefit more in the Sun Belt; GOP more in the north
Catching up on the early vote today. As I said a week or so ago, you can slowly rule out different turnout scenarios as the early vote ticks up. In general, I'd say that we're looking very good on the overall partisan makeup of the electorate, but we're too low on overall turnout
The bottom-line, though, is that there are so many close race that it wouldn't take much of a nudge, either way, for thinks to look *very* different from the conventional wisdom of say D+35
But it would be a stretch for me to argue that it's consistent with our final polls. Our final polls could be off, to be fair. And I hope watching it live helps you understand why. But I can't fairly represent these final polls as anything other than very good for Dems
That said, for most of the last month, we've focused more on the outcome where the GOP keeps it really close. Up until 96 hours ago, I would say our polls were 100% consistent with that possibility. That could still happen, and it's still consistent with our polling in totality
@PatrickRuffini colorado turnout was one of the highest in '14 though, that's consistent w/a reall yhigh turnout
There will be a poll of ~7 million Texans tomorrow night https://t.co/Iiwv4ERDD8
Should also be noted that our polls had pretty strong evidence of a Kavanaugh effect (which you can see in the Ruffini analysis), so we're talking about an even more substantial shift since early-mid October
Democrats gained by more than 3 pts in our final polls over our initial ones, and this individual-level analysis indicates that's not merely because of identifiable changes in the composition of the sample, like more Dems   https://t.co/zv2PSu8neT

It was basically the first of our 'final' polls, and we had Taylor+3, 45-42 with Luria favs skyrocketing from our first poll. Two people indicated it might be worth doing it again (which we weren't going to do), so that's interesting to me

I don‚Äôt have a contemporaneous voter file exactly, but looks like black share of early vote is up 3-4 pt! And white Dem turnout is somewhat weaker
GA6 early vote so far: 163k, up from 143k in the special
And it wouldn't take much of a nudge in either direction to topple a lot of districts. 9 of the 28 were within less than 1 point; 23 were within 3 points
Across our 28 polls in districts rated as "tossups' by the Cook Political Report, we have the Democrats leading by a little under 1 point 	Democrats only need about one-third of these districts to take the House, but there are a lot of close races out there
Occasionally, I like imagining that our polls were *exactly* right. They're not, obviously. But it's fun	Overall, Dems would gain 32, supposing everyone else won where favored.	And you'd have 4 races within 1000 votes: NM-2, UT-4, KY-06, ME-02, including a 130 vote margin in NM-2
Also incredible, Dems led in final polls of CA48, GA06, TX32 and IL14 where GOP had a party ID advantage of 8, 6, 3 and 8 points, respectively
The incredible thing about this poll: Trump approval and GOP party ID are unchanged.	But Underwood is now better known and better liked than the incumbent	Underwood fav: 31/14 --&gt; 50/29	Hultgren fav: 31/27 --&gt; 41/36	https://t.co/ygky6q0K43

Anyway, still early and self-reported turnout can be a little noisy since basically everyone says they're going to vote. We'll see how it ends up.	But on the other hand, high turnout in a place like KY-6 may mean more white, working class Trump vote
Interestingly, and genuinely to my surprise, Amy McGrath is getting hurt more by self-reported turnout being blended into our esitmates than any other Democrats. A 2pt penalty right now, and I guess it's not too hard to see why https://t.co/E9IiNMiQIj
@nickgourevitch to be fair, the polls in the mystery box probably wouldn't be live so i don't see how you could choose them

From a 'who will win the House' standpoint, there's a fine case that this is the best run of polls we've had for the Democrats
Dems faring very well heading into our final day of polling. 	https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
Tenney (R, inc) has led in our poll of this Trump+16 district basically the whole time, but it's now even as we hit 420  https://t.co/61Q0mgKQDF
We're also over 300 in Michigan 8, where Elissa Slotkin (D) has opened up a 5 point lead over Mike Bishop (R, inc) 	  https://t.co/K4POkLpNCa
In Kentucky 6, Andy Barr's lead over Amy McGrath continues to narrow, now to just under 1 point, with nearly 300 responses. Still a ways to go   https://t.co/ktFmp2ZiFw
Steve King (R, inc) has a 4 point lead in Iowa 4 with about 250 respondents in. Still a long ways to go, but seems like a race https://t.co/FTNg7kH1Gy
Maybe our biggest surprise of the final stretch is that Lucy McBath is still up 3 over Karen Handel in GA-6, which would really be something if it held https://t.co/6RKLQYreyR
Texas 32 has been bouncing between dead-even and Allred (D) +1 for a while now, and that's where it remains as we approach 400 https://t.co/LGAAOKB3aj
We're also at 400 in NY-19, where Antonio Delgado (D) has a 3 pt lead over John Faso (R, inc). Basically done calling Democrats here, though https://t.co/dNdrqY2jDy
We're also over 400 in New York 22, where Claudia Tenney holds a 2 point lead in a Trump+16 district. https://t.co/61Q0mgtfM7
Dana Rohrabacher trailing by 3 in California 48 over the 400-mark. This is a lot better for Dems than some other recent polls here  https://t.co/Rg8H3PdAYw
We're over 400 in Washington 8, America's greatest district, where Kim Schrier (D) has stretched out a modest 3 point lead over Dino Rossi (R) in one of the most expensive races in the country https://t.co/H16lzRWHL3
With Hultgren name ID starting so low, this seems like it's played out more like an open race, but in a CD more Dem than last year's special elections, and without the GOP spending millions to bring down the Dem like they did in GA06, etc.
Still a long way to go, but remarkable changes in the last three weeks in IL-14. 	Fundamentals similar	Trump -3 --&gt; -5	Party ID R+9 --&gt; R+10		But...	D fav 31/14/55 --&gt; 52/27/21	R fav 31/27/42 --&gt; 39/37/24	Horse race R+4 --&gt; D+6	Still a ways to go.	https://t.co/ygky6q0K43
Randy Hultgren (R, inc) in serious trouble in IL-14, a bastion of 20th century conservatism, as we cross 250. 	Still a ways to go, but Underwood (D) has been dominating the air waves, and @jmartNYT @alexburnsNYT report private polls show her gaining.  	https://t.co/ygky6q0K43

At the moment, the only decent news for the GOP in our polling is in ultra-hyped KY-06 and VA-07, which may not be a coincidence https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
Still a long ways to go and a lot of Republicans left to call here, but Underwood currently running far ahead of Trump approval and the generic ballot with an R+9 party ID sample
We're nearing 250 in IL-14, and...  	&lt;&lt;&lt;insert eyes emjoi idk how on desktop&gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/ygky6q0K43
This could be kind of the reverse of VA-07, though.	At the moment, JD Scholten is winning 100% of self-identified Democrats.
That said, Tenney may soon have a rival for that distinction: Steve King, who is only up 3 points in Iowa 4 at 220	A long way to go, but this poll may only to 400/425, so it's farther along than usual at this point 	https://t.co/FTNg7kH1Gy
Pretty sure Claudia Tenney (NY-22) is the weakest Republican incumbent we've polled. Trump approval +15 in this Trump+16 CD with an R+12 party ID sample. 	Yet it's a dead-heat as we approach 400 https://t.co/61Q0mgtfM7
Which is to say: this is a poll where you'd guess that Spanberger would entirely close the gap if you allocated undecided/refusal voters by party/primary vote history/demographics. That's generally not true in our polls right now
That said, this VA07 poll is pretty unique among our final polls for having virtually only non-Republican voters among the undecideds. Hard to know if that's real or just inevitable noise on who is undecided/refuses in any given survey, but not sure it matters either way
In general, the results are pretty good for Democrats, though Republicans can feel good that Dave Brat went on a nice run among voters without a primary history this morning to stretch out his lead a bit
This is probably our second to last day of polling. We're in the field in 11 of the House races likeliest to decide control, including nine tossups: VA07, TX32, WA08, KY06, CA48, NY22, NY19, IL14;	and two lean Republican seats: GA06, IA04 	 https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
Confession: I do kind of wish we were polling Texas right now
There are some places where I think it could work out well for the GOP--mainly in white working class areas. But for the most part, we don't have a good trendline in those spots (IA04, NY22, NY19). Still early in KY06, and that's pretty unique tbh
I haven't been able to investigate this (and honestly i'm just not going to be able to until well after the election, given the work to do for tuesday), but I would suspect that this is driving Democratic gains in a lot of these districts, especially in the Sun Belt seats
In general, poll respondents are likelier to vote than non-respondents. But this still influences our estimates, and in general it's nudging up the youth, diversity, and non-primary vote history share of the electorate
There's also been a notable increase in the self-reported turnout intention of voters. Across these polls, the share saying they're almost certain to vote (or already voted) is up 13 points, from 68 to 81 percent
At the moment, Dems are running better than in our prior poll of all of these races, except NY22 (counting last Siena), which hasn't been consistently true over the final stretch
We're done for the night. A lot of these polls are close and there's a long way to go in many of them. But there's a lot of blue.	https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9

@paulmitche11 @Political_Data @DanaRohrabacher what pct do you expect to be av this year? 2/3?
And in my home district of Washington 8, it's dead-even between Rossi and Schrier at about n=357. It was basically dead-even in our first poll, too	This race hasn't gotten much national media play, but it's been one of the most expensive in the country	https://t.co/H16lzRWHL3
Dana Rohrabacher trailing by 3 at the moment in CA-48, now at N=330 or so. 	A long way to go there, including another hour or so of calls tonight 	https://t.co/Rg8H3PdAYw
We're done for the night in TX-32, where it's all even at 43 at about 350 respondents.	Beto+4 at the moment, which probably wouldn't get it done if it you tried to extrapolate statewide, though that's a messy task. 	Still a long ways to go 	https://t.co/LGAAOKB3aj
FWIW the 'gerrymandering nbd' takes were largely in response to the view Dems would have won 2012 w/o gerrymandering, which remains debated	I don't think there was ever an argument that the GOP had a ~wave-proof advantage without gerrymandering https://t.co/tiSKI0F3bY
An under-appreciated part of this cycle: the fight for the House would be something like a true tossup without the litigation that eroded GOP gerrymanders in NC/FL/PA/VA since 14, let alone without the Republican retirements on top of that
And we're just under 250 in Kentucky 6, but why not look and note that Andy Barr (R, inc) has a 3 pt lead over Amy McGrath (D) in perhaps the most hotly contested race of the cycle. 	A very long way to go here
And we're just over 250 in Michigan 8, where Elissa Slotkin (D) is starting out with a 2 point lead over Mike Bishop (R, inc). Would be a pretty unsurprising result if it held, but a long way to go https://t.co/K4POkLpNCa
We're at a similar spot in Georgia 6, where Lucy McBath (D) has a 3 point lead over Karen Handel (R) in the district that started it all this cycle. 	A long way to go and a lot of Republicans left. But this would be something if it held on Election Night	https://t.co/6RKLQYreyR
We're also near 320 in New York 22, wjere Claudia Tenney (R, inc) has seen her lead shrink to 2 points over Anthony Brindisi.	This is a strong Trump CD. Great approvals, too. Last two Siena polls, though, had Brindisi+1. Still a long way to go.	https://t.co/61Q0mgtfM7
We have a lot more interviews with Republicans left here, like most contests right now. So opportunity for GOP to tighten.
In New York 19, Delgado (D, Rhodes Scholar/Big City Rapper, per GOP ads) has a 3 pt lead over John Faso at the 330 mark. 	A long way to go, but Siena had Faso+5 in August, Faso+1 a few weeks ago.	https://t.co/dNdrqY2jDy
I should note that I don't know whether we're going to make it to 500 here, or in many races. We'll see how productive we are over the next few days. But if we fall short, feel free to wonder what our final interviews would have looked like--and what that means for *all* polls
We're well over 400 respondents in Virginia 7, where Dave Brat's (R, inc) lead has dwindled to a point. Undecided voters are highly favorable to the Democrats, as well.	https://t.co/LVbWRuPqLa
We're done for the night in the east (with only minimal lag in reporting!), and we have a lot of close races in many of the more compelling candidate match ups of the year https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
One exception is Karen Handel in Georgia 6, who is favored and is trailing but has not yet worked her way back.	On the other hand, we don't have many Democrats left to call and we all know that Georgia 6 is bound to disappoint Democrats
I've got a lot of work to do but it's kind of hard to look away from some of these polls we have right now. 	Several 'favored' candidates trailing in our polls so far, but working their way back  https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
We're nearing 400 in VA-7, where Dave Brat (R, inc) currently has a 2 point lead over Abagail Spanberger (D).	Under the hood, one bit of tough news for Brat: virtually all of our GOP respondents are decided 	  https://t.co/LVbWRuPqLa
We're also finally beginning to roll in Steve King's district, where we're asking we're also voters about their attitudes on immigration. Still extremely early  https://t.co/FTNg7kH1Gy
Among the districts we're polling: four majority to overwhelmingly white, Republican-leaning districts where black Democrats are running very competitively: NY-19, IL-14, GA-06, TX-32  https://t.co/LGAAOKB3aj
i'm tired enough that this joke scared me for a split second https://t.co/bebdsuc6Tt
the difference we're talking about, is, say, whether we weight by white/nonwhite or white/nonwhite/black in a CD, where appropriate. party is the same in all of them
to be clear, all of these polls are still weighted and i suspect the changes will be imperceptible, and if they are perceptible it will probably be by the margin of rounding (44.4 to 44.6) or something
just to give you an inside look, i specify the weights in a google sheet that looks like this. the ID for each CD corresponds to the URL. i copied a few CDs from our initial poll "-1" and neglected to flip to a "-3." https://t.co/Gs6nPgPmPL
2) i'm personally lagging a bit, and i entered the weights in a way that meant we defaulted to our generic categories (say, rather than slightly different categories for each CD)
Two programming notes, folks, as we head into the final stretch. 	1) we're lagging projected productivity a bit, so there's a possibility that several of these polls will wind up well beneath 500. IA04/GA06/IL14 are cautiously targeted at 425; rest at 475. Hope to go higher
We've got a lot of close races heading into the last weekend, including one-third of the tossups likeliest to decide control of the House: CA48, WA08, VA07, TX32, MI08, KY06, NY19, NY22, IL14, and two prominent lean Republican races: GA-06 and IA-04 	https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9

@NateSilver538 i don't know if i've unintentionally implied something here, but this isn't really trying to be more than it is: a chart of our poll results in one spot
@NateSilver538 similarly, we're polling IL14 over the great pleas for CO03 because there's reason to think that we might find a more interesting result there
@NateSilver538 there are selection bias issues, though. the decision to poll FL15, NM02, PA10, NY11, for instance, were all informed by reporting on the state of those contests
I also have to point out that the distribution of our results in the tossups is remarkably close to being normally distributed around zero, with all in the margin of error too
Of course, they won't be exactly right. Not really analytically useful. Mainly useful to remember to help you remember that there's only a sliver of a difference between a very close election night and +40 dem seats. So many super close races
If you want to imagine a long, close for House control, all you need to do is imagine that these polls are *exactly* right. Could take weeks to decide.

@paulmitche11 i just mean the relationship between the margin in registration (r+15) and the vote, which is all my 'interactions' are full of right now
You just can't look at the party reg. margins and see the outcome in either of these places. There are some places where it's at least in the ballpark, but even there it's *not* the same as knowing the vote margin
@ComfortablySmug @guypbenson @ForecasterEnten if fox news won't poll texas to own the libs, who will?
This is a very simple point, but apparently one forgotten during early voting: party registration is not as vote choice. That's why Amy McGrath and Ojeda aren't going to win by double digits in KY6 and WV03, and why Walters and Rohrabacher aren't going to win by 10+ in CA45/48
I do think, though, that anything like a '14 turnout has been ruled out. To cherry pick one recent example from a really great pollster: Monmouth's recent CA-48 poll is like R+17 by registration with their standard model. That's just not going to happen at this point
Anyway, our polls could easily prove to be off on turnout anyway. I'm just saying that in general there's nothing about the early vote that leads me to think they will be by a lot. 	And, of course, even if our polls are right on turnout, they can be wrong for many other reasons
Not so sure whether that's the case in the competitive suburban CDs, like 7/32, where our turnout model is most aggressive
The biggest question-mark, it seems to be Texas. It's hard to know where this ends,  because we're in uncharted territory, but I would say statewide turnout should easily breakthrough our estimate.
I'd say we're tracking right on the line in Colorado as well, though GOP could beat our model by a point there
In terms of aggregate partisan breakdown, I feel very good about how the vote is tracking towards our projections. If you made me guess, I'd say we're right on track in Arizona/Florida, maybe Ds could beat our model by a point in Nevada
We're at the point in the early vote in some places where we can basically rule out certain turnout scenarios, and being to see whether the turnout is consistent or inconsistent with our polling

@RandySF45 The easiest way to see it is that as turnout increases the GOP edge drops. Another way to think about it is that the GOP edge is unsustainable; the pool of remaining votes gets too young and dem for turnout to keep Increasing without them
Our model is like R+9 or something, which strikes me as pretty reasonable given where we're at so fa and assuming we're heading for a big overall turnout, as i think the volume of returns to this point plainly implies
And we're down to R+14 with total vote up to 75k, and it will keep falling as turnout grows turns towards younger and more irregular voters.
I know a lot of people didn't really follow this thread, but this is it playing out: https://t.co/a9YnYNQOqW
RT @CA_120: If you're looking for first signs of turnout by young voters, check the "timelines by subgroup" just added to the @Political_Da‚Ä¶
that said, if you want to be surprised, check out the composition of the electorate in the siena v. nyt/siena polls of NY27. in all of our testing, we wind up with about the same result, despite very different ways of approaching weighting/turnout
but looking at a crosstab probably not so useful
i actually do think it's valid to look at the composition of the electorate in polls, on the one condition that you're familiar with the district/state's voter file and vote history https://t.co/0crBtOQRIx
But if you look at the tabs, you'll see that 80% of the likely electorate is in the 'almost certain' or 'already voted' category. In our first poll, just 64% were 'almost certain.' And in a district like this, that's means more irregular voters which lean Democratic
On the other hand, probably wouldn't be wise for anyone to be too confident about what a high turnout, pro-dem midterm electorate looks like in Orange County (and in Texas, Tennessee, other places that haven't had competitive elections in a while)
And I've got to say, this feels like an overly favorable electorate for Porter, with self-reported turnout narrowing the GOP party registration edge down to 8. A borderline too good to be true number for Dems, as far as I'm concerned
@PatrickRuffini does it look much different if you exclude open seats
Porter lead down to 2 points in CA-45, a seat most put somewhere on the edge between lean Dem and tossup, with over 400 interviews in   https://t.co/Vu2OS8cT4l

We've got a longer ways to go in CA-45, but nothing to disrupt the conventional wisdom that Mimi Walters is an underdog so far https://t.co/Vu2OS8cT4l
A close race in NC-9 is also pretty notable, given that this is a Trump+12 CD where we have Trump approval rating holding at +11 and GOP+9 on the generic ballot

But this has always been a House-focused project, and I don't really think there's enough evidence of a super competitive Senate in the final stretch to merit a flip

@WTPDavid but that's not a bold claim, again stipulating that the half done poll is 'right.' turnout won't save you from an 8 point deficit
@WTPDavid i do think that's a fair characterization, actually: if this half-done poll were right about the NPP margin--and it's only half done, so maybe let's not go overboard on the subsample of the halfway done poll lol--there's no republican turnout that can save walters
@stranter the map doesn't show the location of the actual people we respond to
Largest minor candidate vote in any of our polls. But an L did get 6.5 here in '18, and plenty of reason for Republican defection here, so maybe it's not completely insane.
We're nearly through in KS-2, where Paul Davis (D) is up 41 to 37 percent over Steve Watkins (R), with Sandley (L) at 7 percent, in a Trump+18 CD 	https://t.co/R6Ga24WKnt

this is my compromise

That's why you really have to focus on the *level* of the turnout in the mail voting states. The pace of early returns is so high that the GOP actually needs to bank on what's happening *stopping,* not continuing
Overall, this is an R+6 district by registration. You can't lift the turnout to like 200k+ or whatever and stay at R+15. That would actually imply that the GOP turnout, from here, is vastly better than what they have so far
Early vote hawks will note that the current early vote is already something like R+15, even though total vote is 65k. Given how *old* the early vote is so far, this is really not good at all for the GOP.
The main thing I'd point out is that party registration doesn't tell you much. Our turnout model is like R+9; we'd be something like R+15 in a '14 turnout. But even '14 model isn't getting it done for Walters right now, due to GOP defections and and unaffiliated vt breaks Dems
We're over 250 in Calif. 45, and Porter starts with a fairly comfortable lead. It's still early, so I'm not going to focus on the topline at this point. But I will take it as an opportunity to talk about the early vote	https://t.co/Vu2OS8cT4l
More seriously, though:	--great examples of being tempted to herd. it'd be so easy to get these polls back and make the tiniest tweak to be 'even'	--i've said over and over that n=500 polls are noisy, and these are great examples
As an aside, our polls of PA-1 and NJ-3 both went from being big Dem outlier-ish results to &lt;1 pt GOP leads. 	If the Dems win, I fully intend to say you should have taken the average.

All answers rank GA-7 in the top 2 though, tho
On the other hand, I'd probably rank SC-1 #1, but only one other person has it ranked above the bottom 2
Colo. 3 is dead last, on average, among the people i've asked
@NateSilver538 what's your rank preference among the 4
The Colo. 3 twitter/538 v. raters/reporter/campaign split is pretty amazing
Where would you want a poll?
I take this back since WI06 isn't apparently a real buy. WI06 is a fringy case; SC01 on paper should be a real race, like other open seats in Trump+10 sort of areas (FL15, NM02, VA05, etc.), and was hurt by association. Probably real.
This is referring to new NRCC IEs in some, on paper, fringy CDs like WI06 or SC01
I think it's pretty hard to read much into the late expenditures btw. One possibility is that late polling shows it closing. The other is that the GOP planned to cover its bases at the end in some lean/likely R seats, even if they weren't worth continuous air war

We're also nearly done in NY-27, where the indicted Chris Collins (R, inc) has a 44-40 lead. About the same as the Siena poll there a couple weeks ago, which was Collins+3  https://t.co/CkT70FP0PL
The underlying numbers, at least at the moment, seem decent for Davis holding on to this. Fav/unfav at 47/32; Watkins at 39/42. GOP+2 on generic ballot / Trump approval at +5 aren't huge 'fundamentals' deficits to overcome, if true
And btw, we're asking the full ballot in our final polls. I think there are trade-offs in asking about third party candidates, especially early on, This poll may be an example of the downside playing out, even at the end.	In any case, third party tally is in the footnote
Libertarian vote here was &gt;6% in '16, and lots of GOP dissatisfaction in KS right now. So maybe it's not insane. Weirder yet is Standley is a fmr Dem party county leader.
So, we have our highest minor party vote yet and one of our highest undecided tallies, at least for now. 	Not really sure what to make of it, all considered.
We're over the 400-mark in Kansas 2, which is playing out as one of our weirder polls in a while. 	It's Davis 39 (D), Watkins 36 (R), Standley 8 (L), Undec. 16 	https://t.co/R6Ga24WKnt

But, remember, they're all weighted. So, there's no guarantee that, say, more suburbs will mean a McCreedy surge in NC09 or something
Interestingly, the reason varies quite a bit by poll. KS02 came out with way too many Republicans (though I have to say, these Republicans look horrible for Watkins); PA01 apparently is ahead on landlines and behind on cells; NC09 has a bunch of rural, and behind on CLT burbs
We're over 250 mark in all of PA01, NC09 and KS02, and all the results are facially plausible--essentially even, +/- a few points. But all of the samples are pretty unbalanced after the first pass, with a lot of weighting. A long way to go https://t.co/DFxwJRJXtm
Interesting. We had Hurd up big when we last polled, but Ortiz-Jones has now spent... 4.5 million and had a 2:1 cash-on-hand advantage at last report  https://t.co/ivaBEWijif
Finally, a lot of the people who think the numbers are great for Republicans in FL/CA are focusing on GOP registration advantages. But that's not the same as vote choice; Dems have wide advantages among 'other' voters, per our data, and in Orange County they have significant R vt
It's still fairly early, but the high volume of early voting in these mail states, like CA/FL, and higher Dem turnout v. this point in '14, is fundamentally consistent with our turnout model's assumption about higher and more Dem turnout. It doesn't say much more, from my pov
In those states, the *volume* of early voting is the compelling factor, since high turnout will invariably wind up drawing from younger voters in time. Alternately,  turnout by party controlling for age is potentially indicative.
2) Every state's early vote has its own pattern. The mail absentee states basically go from old to young, and so states with big generation gaps will trend from R to D, as well
So, our poll doesn't really change a *ton* as voters (presumably) shift from telling us they're going to vote to actually voting. But there is an effect.
1) It's somewhat incorporated. Voters who tell us they've already voted get more weight, particularly if we initially thought they were unlikely to vote. But that's also true, to a slightly lesser degree, for people who were almost certain.
I've gotten a lot of questions about the early vote in recent days. Two main genres: 1) is it incorporated; 2) don't great GOP numbers in FL/CA contradict it?

Anyway, I would obviously like to horde the extra completes and turn them into an extra poll. But I do think there's been a fun, extra and unintended lesson in these post-500 runs
Oh, my boss just reminded me of another concrete example: in PA07, we went over because the person running the call center was donating blood lol
That makes sense to me for like a, 506 hypothetically. But there are occasions (like NM02) where we've kept calling beyond that and I just don't know why. I've never run a call center though, so I don't know the mechanics of how stopping actually works
I've been given one concrete examples in the past: if, hypothetically, we reach 500 interviews, but several interviews are already under way when the 500th is completes
Some people have asked when/why we go over 500 respondents.	Honestly, I have no idea. I assume it's just some of the quirks of managing call centers, but I'm several steps removed from it unless it's a deliberate decision to deal with high design effects or something
@ElectProject they also help people understand that first sentence in a much more visceral way than telling them what the stats mean

Also something to think about in terms of the consistent underestimation of Dems in Hispanic areas. Hispanic vote might just get activated later in the game, and both flip from undecided to Dem and from unlikely to likely to vote.
Though FWIW, our TX07 poll, just finishing up now, also had a much stronger Dem Latino performance than last month. 	Went from 12 to 14% of electorate, and Dem margin increased from 10 to 20. Probably just noise. But there may be a trend.	https://t.co/POIcMqciZc

California 39, final. Cisneros 48 (D), Kim 47 (R)	Turnout an outsized factor in this in this rapidly changing district https://t.co/UIc4iXtKmO
We're over 250 in CA-10 but we're in weighting purgatory because of education weighting.	Interestingly, and so far, it's Dems who are benefiting from education weighting in this poll. 	Hispanics with HS or less educ. unanimously support Harder (so far)   https://t.co/qCa8QvBgpW
We're nearing 450 respondents in CA-49, where Levin (D) is up... 54-39.	Basically only Republicans left from here on out, but crazy to think this district elected Issa just 2 years ago	https://t.co/kU5TraJQVf
@imthewalruz it does. i'm just tired
@maestro876 A) This is a small sample and it's really not worth looking at it like this;	B) By party registration, our "already voted" respondents are R 47, D 30
By weighted respondent, our NM-02 result is 232.1 to 232.3. But it rounds to Herrell+1, 45 (45.51) to 44 (45.45)
New Mexico 2, final: Herrell 44.5 (R), Torres Small 44.5 (D)	Our closest result yet 	https://t.co/vBDQyjyw8Y
@PatrickRuffini i haven't paid as much attention to other polls as i usually do, but fwiw fivethirtyeight currently assigns us a house effect of R+0.1
We're done for the night in Florida Senate and Governor. 	We'll be heading for N=800, but here at a mere 119 we could just stop, pat ourselves on the back and match the poll averages with Nelson+4 and Gillium+5 	(this is mainly luck/noise/a coincidence) https://t.co/2M39lOeHjO
The things I thought could be outliers though were often at least partially confirmed by subsequent polling or reporting. 	The clearest exception: NJ-3. And indeed, we have the race essentially even right now after showing Kim up 10 in round one  https://t.co/pOKfIGIM9V
At the same time though, it's still pretty hard to tell where there's an outlier. In our first round of polls, I was concerned we had plausible outliers in a lot of races, at one point or another: CO06, KS03, MN03, CA45, VA02, OH12, NJ03, WV03, at least.
So if you wanted to argue IL-6 is an outlier, you'd have an easier time making the case by comparing it to the balance of IL12/13/14 data than by digging through tabs or the normally weak stuff that people usually resort to
We're also in many districts of the same state, where have the same data, often at the same time, which is a real frame for comparison.
One thing I'll note, btw, is that we're in like 12 or so contests at a time right now.	So, the chance that there's a true outlier--like, the 1/20 outside of the MoE, which is already large on an N=500 poll--among our polls at any given point is getting pretty high
We're also nearing 350 in Ill. 6, where Roskam (R, inc) is still up 3.	Obviously a long way to go, and perhaps the poll is just an outlier, but this is a solid result for the GOP if it were to hold https://t.co/5zaM30isB7
We're down to the last 20 or 25 respondents in FL-26, CA-39 and NM-2.	Dems ahead by 1 pt in these three highly diverse tossups where non-white voter represent &gt; ~40% of the vote. 	Republicans lead by 2 to 4 points in the 2014 turnout	https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
My interpretation is that this is a clear case where the ad wars in an expensive market have materially moved the race from where it was over the summer
@dmode123 they're both D+3?
Now, it's all different. The final result seems sure to be better for Dems in the horse race, whether Ds lead or not. 	But it's a R+1 party ID, Trump approval only -6 and D+6 on the generic ballot.	Cutting the other way: Curbelo fav down +8 and only 34% don't know Mucarsel-Powell
Our Sept. poll was Curbelo+4 with a D+3 sample by party ID, Trump approval at -15 and D+7 on the gen ballot.	But Curbelo fav was +25 and 68% didn't know who Mucarsel-Powell was 	https://t.co/CfTQOiDVMs
We're over 470 in FL-26, where the lead has been going back and forth between Curbelo (R) and Mucarsel-Powell for a long time.	Whoever ultimately 'wins' the poll, what's interesting to me is that the underlying numbers look a lot different  https://t.co/ji5QBRLDYJ
We've had 5 lead changes in FL26 in the last like 30 respondents.	Nice illustration of the sort of thing we want you take out of live polling. D+1 / R+1 will get a very different reaction on Twitter, but it's just not much of a difference in an N=500 poll 	https://t.co/ji5QBRLDYJ
FL-26, CA-39 and NM-2 are all 1 point races with well over 400 respondents https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
We're heading into the final stretch in FL-26, where Curbelo (R) and Mucarsel-Powell (D) have been trading the lead back and forth in a toss-up district that's basically a must-hold for the GOP https://t.co/ji5QBRLDYJ
Black turnout was pretty mediocre in the special https://t.co/tyruw5tXNj
You know, if you take the GA06 special electorate and boost black turnout up and I'm not sure how much Handel lead is left
Why does everyone want a Colorado 3 poll suddenly? Did something happen?

Rohrabacher hanging in there in the Monmouth poll.   https://t.co/mxTH1fzioE
On paper, they're all basically better Democratic opportunities than the last year's special elections. GOP spent millions to knock back Dems in those races.	But unlike those contests, these races have flown under the radar and haven't received as much attention
I'd say our three best results for Democrats in GOP territory have been VA-05, NM-2, and FL-15	One thing they all have in common: open races
Virginia 5, final: Cockburn 46 (D), Riggleman 45 (R)	This open race is our first Dem lead in a 'lean Rep' district in a month. 	Might be hard for Dems to really get over the top here, with positive Trump approval and GOP lead on generic ballot https://t.co/YNbYdRHc5T
Virginia 2, final: Taylor 45 (R, inc) , Luria 42 (D)	This will be an interesting test early on election night. 	https://t.co/AAR6Zv1gIG
Illinois 12, final. Bost 48 (R, inc), Kelly 39	A lot of undecided young, Dem, St.L burb voters, but this doesn't seem like a top-tier opportunity for Democrats anymore 	https://t.co/zjZVw5GvoG
And we've just crossed 350 in NM-2, where Xochtil Torres Small (D) is up by 1 still.	Voters approve of Trump by 5. They want a GOP Congress by 5. But Torres Small favs are great and Dems do still have a reg advantage here  	https://t.co/vBDQyjyw8Y
We're also near 400 in CA-39, where Cisernos is up 2 points over Young Kim. 	Wouldn't have called this a good result for the Democrats in May, but if it holds I'd say it would be now https://t.co/UIc4iXtKmO
FL-26 is near the 400 mark, but it remains in weighting purgatory w/a design effect near 2. Getting tired of south Florida tbh	The race is even, but who knows what it'll look like in the end. Lots of Hispanic voters left.	https://t.co/ji5QBRLDYJ
We're also nearly done in VA-5, a "lean Rep" race which remains even at 45 each.	Unlike VA2, though, voters here approve of Trump by 4. Hard to know which race is a bigger risk for GOP, IMO  https://t.co/YNbYdRHc5T
Put it all together, and this race is going to be a solid early test on Election Night
We're near the end in VA-2 as well, where Scott Taylor (R, inc) has a 3 point lead, 45 to 42 percent. 	Luria favorability rating is way better than it was last month, and Trump's approval isn't hot. A non-white/Dem-tilting group of undecided voters.	https://t.co/AAR6Zv1gIG
We're in the final stretch in Illinois 12, where Mike Bost (R, inc) is up 7 points, 47-40. 	Most undecided voters are Democratic-leaners, StL Burbs and young, so there's Dem upside. But voters approve of president and want a GOP congress	https://t.co/zjZVw5GvoG
We should get very near the end in VA-5 tonight, which should be an interesting finish. The Democrat still leads by 1 point heading into the final stretch, and it would be our first Dem "lead" in a "lean Rep" district since NM-2 about a month ago
Tonight, we'll be in the field in a long list of top-tier battleground districts with the potential to determine control:	IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, NM-2, VA-5, VA-2, OH-1, NJ-3, CA-10, CA-49, CA-39, FL-26, TX-7	https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9

@jon_m_rob @ForecasterEnten at least this is a state where it probably doesn't matte rmuch
@jon_m_rob well you'll get a lot more opportunities to add data in the next 2 weeks
And CA-39 keeps getting tighter, with Cisernos now up by just 2 points at n&gt;375.	I almost feel bad for these Orange County voters. GOP+10 by party ID, but Trump approval -8 in a Romney-Clinton district. 	Turnout a challenge for Dems. https://t.co/UIc4iXtKmO
VA-5 remains totally even as we approach the 400-mark. 	This is generally considered a lean Rep race, and voters here approve of Trump and want a GOP congress. But VA is a scary state for the GOP right now, and this is a... peculiar GOP candidate 	https://t.co/YNbYdRHc5T
Scott Taylor (R, inc) has opened up a slight, 2pt lead in VA-2 at N&gt;400. 	We had Taylor up 8 in the immediate aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearing, so this would be a pretty decent result for Dems. Luria (D) favorability ratings are much, much higher	https://t.co/AAR6Zv1gIG
We're nearing the final stretch in IL-12, where Mike Bost (R, inc) has an 8 pt lead	&gt;90% of remaining calls go to the St. Louis suburbs, so it'll be interesting to see how much this tightens up https://t.co/zjZVw5GvoG
We're about to hit 250 in FL-26, but it's going to be in weighting purgatory--or, really weighting hell--for a while. Design effect over 2, for now  https://t.co/ji5QBRLDYJ
Still very early in NM-2, but we have Xochtil Torres Small (D) at least highly competitive at n&gt;250.	This is a Trump+10 CD, and Trump approve+6, GOP+3 on the gen ballot. But Torres Small favs are +17.  	A very long way to go here. 	https://t.co/vBDQyjyw8Y
@jon_m_rob stands out that your right-hand outliers on the no-party reg states are MN08, where there's no party period, and VA02/OH01 which were immediately following the Kavanaugh hearing
What's the turnout going to be in KY-06? Is it basically like there's a hotly contested Senate race, even though there isn't a Senator or Governors race at all?
Florida 27 is obviously a really, really tough district to poll, so I suspect this is true for just about everyone. But still worth noting
Since transparency is really the big theme of this project I feel compelled to note that, by the measures I look at, this is objectively one of our least representative samples. The education skew here, in particular, is absurd  https://t.co/IGR5WcjMEl
Florida 27, final: Shalala 44 (D), Salazar 37 (R)	Shalala's favorability rating better than I thought it would be tbh 	https://t.co/JfD6cGKkTI
@jon_m_rob @b_schaffner (also possible that we're polling a disproportionately older set of districts)
@jon_m_rob @b_schaffner it is possible that our voter files are too old, or our use of contemporaneous files for modeling skews our models old, but it does not seem to me that a '14 turnout would be 9% 18-29% today
@jon_m_rob @b_schaffner before I answer, here's something I'd like to see from the Catalist data: how much older is the RV pool today than it was in 2014, both in terms of youth pct of RV and pct over 65?
Today we're in the field in 11 of the tossups that will decide control of the House. 	We're also getting far into VA-5, a lean Republican race that's dead even so far https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9

We're over 2,000,000 calls placed with just over two weeks to go https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
Riggleman, who has been accused of campaigning with white supremacists, is currently earning 0% from black voters https://t.co/YNbYdRHc5T
It might also be a tougher Dem win than it looks, given GOP edge on generic ballot and Trump+3 approval. Riggleman favorability rating isn't terrible, like you might guess
We're over 350 in VA-5, where Cockburn (D) has a narrow edge over Riggleman, of bigfoot erotica fame	Still a long ways to go, but it could be our first Dem win in a 'lean Rep' race since NM02 in Sept. 	https://t.co/YNbYdRHc5T
One thing I'll be watching: Asian voters, a major reason why Kim thought to be so competitive. Still a very small sample, but Cisernos doing just fine to this point, and 37% of Asian voters say they have no opinion of Kim--higher than any other racial group.
Still a very long way to go in CA-39, but Cisernos (D) has a 5 pt lead over Young Kim at the moment. R+9 sample by party ID, which is fun to see in these quickly changing areas
On 9/30, when we were finishing our last poll, Luria had 1.3m COH to .5 for Taylor. Have to wonder whether we're starting to see the 'green wave' effect here  https://t.co/VeJrhjeuPI
So far, a main shift is Luria favs. 	Before:	Taylor 52/33	Luria 36/31	So far:	Taylor 51/32	Luria 46/28	Should be noted that this electorate got a bit more Democratic with data from the primary, when there was a strong Dem turnout, but I think that's maybe 2 pts not 8
On the other hand, we're at 350 in VA-2 where the Democrat Elaine Luria is neck and neck with Scott Taylor. Still a ways to go, but anything like it would be a notable turnaround from our last poll (R+8) right after the Kavanaugh hearing  https://t.co/AAR6Zv1gIG
We're nearing the 400 mark in Illinois 12, where Mike Bost (R, inc) has a 9 point lead. 	Most of our remaining calls will go to the Democratic parts of this district, so Kelly could close. But anything like it would be good for the GOP   https://t.co/zjZVw5GvoG

Washington 3, probably final: Herrera Beutler 48 (R, inc), Long 41 (D)	This race leans Republican, so not a big surprise. A lot of Trump disapprovers, young voters and Democrats among the undecided	https://t.co/coseKZA1BT
@ForecasterEnten Yeah
Heading into the final stretch, this is what the big picture looks like if you just take our polls at face value and assume they're dead-on 	(they're not; they're fairly noisy at n=500, let alone all other challenges in polling) https://t.co/G68QEQCiUv

Didn't realize this, but Democrats now have the registration advantage in California 39, at least in the L2 data

With our design effect still resting over the warning threshold in FL-27, which looks increasingly important to the House map, we're going to do another round of interviews to make sure we get to a good spot for a final poll   https://t.co/JfD6cGKkTI
It's crazy that this is probably a good idea https://t.co/eTor4REzC6
If someone wants to make me happy and get a RT, they'll compare the early vote in GA6 so far with the early vote in GA6 special
We're back in the field in FL-15, which remains surprisingly close here heading into the final stretch. SurveyUSA had this tied yesterday.	If Carlson hangs on, it will be the first Dem lead in a "lean Rep" CD in our polling since NM-02 a month ago https://t.co/T4x8Hsyg0i

The big shift among well-educated voters, in other words, has done a fair amount to attenuate the traditional Democratic turnout disadvantage, at least in the places where Dems actually *win* well-educated white voters (IE, a VA10, but maybe not similarly diverse TX07)
We have a much more robust turnout across the board than in 2014, including among young and nonwhite voters. But the electorate is still much older and whiter than a presidential electorate.	On the other hand, the electorate is also much better educated https://t.co/woBnIrRASR
Under the hood, though, we have Republicans holding a 3 point LV-RV advantage in diverse, Sun Belt districts. The Democrats have nearly a 1 pt edge where white voters are more than 85% of the electorate
In our polling, Democrats have eliminated the turnout deficit that hobbled them during the Obama era.	https://t.co/XffXFdsv6C
We're going to N=600 here, like TN and NV, btw.
I'd say we basically have good poll results for the Democrats everywhere right now, except in one very important race: Arizona Senate, where McSally is up 3.	Sinema favs are underwater, and I'll note she's had a tough couple weeks of coverage  https://t.co/VHGHzDed52
Texas 23, final: Hurd 53 (R, inc), Ortiz-Jones 38 (D)	A lot of Democratic-leaning undecided voters, but Hurd has a 58/26 fav/unfav rating and he might just hold this traditional battleground district by a wide margin.  	https://t.co/KTBF4dnZPG
West Virginia 3, final: Miller 46 (R), Ojeda (D) 41	Pretty astonishing for a Democrat to be so competitive here. Wouldn't rule out an Ojeda win. Not at all. 	https://t.co/RcP2XEkM1M
Maine 2, final: Golden 41 (D), Poliquin 41 (R, inc)	Voters approve of Susan Collins by 34 points and approve of her Kavanaugh vote by 17 points	https://t.co/Vl4usOQMer
You may recall, way back during TX32, that we decided to collapse down to 3 categories of education weights in well-educated CDs. 	I drew the line basically just about FL27, which is ~50% BA+ in the likely electorate. If the weight warning is still there at 500, we might go to 3
Check out the difference between the unweighted N and weighted pct in FL27 right now. https://t.co/tNqXy48XR3
We're actually back in weighting purgatory in FL-27, though not due to underrepresentation of Hispanic voters. It's education weighting https://t.co/JfD6cGKkTI
We're nearing 400 respondents in PA-8 (Scranton!), where Matt Cartwright (D, inc) is still up by 14 points. 	Felt like we needed to poll here after our MN-08 poll, but this basically backs the conventional wisdom that Cartwright is going to make it. https://t.co/G4ojKVzpZA
WV-3, on the other hand, is a lean Rep open race where will not show a lead. We have Miller+5 at the moment with only a handful of interviews left.	Wouldn't rule out an Ojeda victory though, not at all.    https://t.co/RcP2XEkM1M
We also have a slight Dem edge in VA-05, with around 300 respondents in.	Another open, lean GOP race that's under the radar, bigfoot erotica thing notwithstanding	VA-05 and FL-15 would be our first Dem lead in a lean Rep race since NM-02, another open race	https://t.co/YNbYdRHc5T
One thing that's kind of annoying me, given the way tie v. D+1 is perceived, is that we have Dem+35 among self-reported early voters, which seems probably wrong, and that makes the difference between a tied and D+1 race right now
We're over 400 respondents and we still have the Democrat up a point in Florida 15.	Earlier today, SurveyUSA put FL-15 as a tied race. This is an open, lean Republican, under the radar race with relatively little spending. Both candidates largely unknown.	https://t.co/T4x8Hsyg0i
@SeanTrende @sethdmichaels @xenocryptsite any reason in particular
We're in the field in a lot of races, and almost all of them would be strong results for Democrats after several weeks of GOP strength in our polling https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
@ChazNuttycombe it includes presidential primaries, 2017 primaries, 2014, etc
In a lot of other states--where we already had a post-primary file and where there's no party registration, like TX/IL--it's harder to tell whether there's similar movement
The Orange County Calif. electorates have also drifted left but we get updates there pretty often and we've been keeping up. Maybe CA48 is an exception, since it was our first race basically, but I haven't checked
Looking through updated voter files, I'd say IA-3, KY-6, VA-7 and WA-8 and four important races where our electorate could look notably more Democratic--like a pt or two to the left--than before, thanks to updated registration or primary vote history
@TylerDinucci KY-6 too.
I think this is exactly the sort of race that's easy to imagine slipping in a wave. Open seat, on paper farther left than all of the post-Trump specials. Not much spending and certainly no effort to nuke the Democrat.
@TylerDinucci no we get CA updates pretty often. IA, MI, WA-8 have been stragglers and I'd guess there's potential for real movement there
Somewhat complicating the easy comparison is that this is one of the last states where we got updated vote history from the primary, and that's pushed the electorate a bit to the left since our first poll. Not that much; maybe a pt or something, I'd guess. But keep it in mind
We're in the field in VA-2. 	I put this higher on the schedule than I would have otherwise because we polled it immediately post-Kavanaugh hearing, and it was a very strong result for GOP. 	A decent test to see if there's a snap back	https://t.co/AAR6Zv1gIG
@jbview we'll see how it shakes out, but i agree. we haven't had a good dem result in a lean rep district, or really a trump/romney cd, since the kavanaugh fight. now suddenly it seems like it's rolling
SurveyUSA has FL-15 tied. We have a long ways to go there, but it seems poised to be quite competitive in our data s well  https://t.co/ltLKWwiVUt

@jon_m_rob the party ID weighting parameter is what caught my eye
New Jersey 11, probably final: Sherrill 49, Webber 38	This is a pretty fantastic Dem turnout, but Sherrill is still up 5 in the 2014 electorate. Her fav rating is fantastic, and she's running far ahead of the generic ballot / Trump disapproval 	 https://t.co/KLk9wVGSmM
Kansas 3, final: Davids 48 (D), Yoder 39 (R, inc)	We had this as Davids+8 back in September, which I thought was a little hard to believe. Like CO06, easy to see why this is considered "lean Dem" and a feature of various GOP triage candidate lists 	https://t.co/0VDYrcpr5y
We're also nearly done in WV-3, where Miller (R) leads Ojeda (D) by 4 points. 	Quite reminiscent of the Monmouth poll just released there	Ojeda name ID up to 84% from 56% in September 	https://t.co/RcP2XEkM1M

Jamie Herrera Beutler (R, inc) up by 5 points, 47-42 over Carolyn Long in WA-03. With a ways to go, you can easily imagine this finishing as a good poll for either side, but I wouldn't find R+5 here to be compelling result for her or the GOP https://t.co/coseKZA1BT

@jon_m_rob @PredictIt you should do it again
@jon_m_rob @PredictIt didn't you do a poll of your followers about high turnout would be and how it would change that proved to be reasonably prescient
@jon_m_rob @stevesingiser @tbonier @Redistrict i feel like the lack of a presidential registration surge has probably already told us what we need to know about what to expect in this respect
Now, being totally dead-on when it comes to turnout does not mean the polls are assured to be right. But it would rule out (or alert us to) *one* category of possible error
We're basically going to know, ahead of the election, whether our polls are going to be wrong bc of turnout. To take a few recent ones: the electorate in Colo. 6, NV/AZ Senate is more or less going to be baked by 11/6, and if we're fundamentally off we'll know
In general, the 'x party leads in early voting they're going to win' take is bad.	But turnout in this election is uncertain in some important ways, and we're going to know a lot about the electorate by Election Day
We're over 300 in FL-27, which is in weighting/design effect purgatory at the moment 	Shalala's lead was cut in half today as we worked through Hispanic Republicans, but we're still well, well behind in that strata. Late movement very possible here 	https://t.co/JfD6cGKkTI
Not too far behind is NJ-11, where Sherrill is up by a sort of surprising 13 points at the moment	This is the last GOP-held Cook "lean Dem" race to poll, and the Dem led/leads by at least 7 points in all of them. 	https://t.co/KLk9wVGSmM
We're also near 400 in Maine 2, and at the moment we have Golden (D) up by 3. 	If it holds, this would be our first piece of plainly good news for Democrats in a GOP-held, Trump CD in since the Kavanaugh hearing 	https://t.co/Vl4usOQMer
I guess that became 7 and 9 by the time I tweeted it

@PatrickRuffini @LPDonovan @Peter_Hurley_ and based on the data that we have in MT, that would basically just amount to weighting on precinct vote share, which isn't a particularly strong correlate of vote choice either
On night one in FL27, we completed 43% of our target interviews with white Democrats and 19% of our target among Hispanic Republicans. Long way to go
@PatrickRuffini @LPDonovan @Peter_Hurley_ we get primary vote history in TX, and while Hispanic vote is a variable, race is at least a variable correlated with vote choice that we can weight on, which is effectively useless in MT
It could even accelerate   https://t.co/Bpr8iffz42

@TwardowskiDC no; voters from duluth represent the proper share of the weighted sample. the real question is whether the voters we would have called back in duluth--the harder to reach voters--would have been more or less dem than the easy ones we filled up on
Also, pro-tip: our map displays calls in chronological order, so you can see our spasmodic effort to fail at Erie County (much of the time we're *not* polling Erie we're actually trying to)  https://t.co/Y7B2gliSHD
this is supposed to say region x party or race x party
Based on my cursory look, I am not of the view that this explains the fairly surprising results in PA01 and MN08. But I wouldn't discount the notion that, at the margins, it's a contributing factor.
But that doesn't mean there aren't some modest adverse consequences here. For instance, because we quickly called through Duluth or Dems in PA01, we (probably) didn't do as many callbacks there.
We're going to dig in to see whether this merits a full re-poll or not down the stretch. Remember that the polls are still weighted, so even if we had too many respondents in Duluth, Duluth still represented the proper share of the electorate
In PA16/MN08/PA16, this wasn't properly programmed. So in MN08 for instance, we were callng Duluth way out of proportion, and so on. We realized this late in PA01/PA16, and fairly early in MN08. Hence, we went way over 500 in PA01/PA16  to undo some of the damage
For us, the exact approach varies from poll to poll but we mainly focus on region x party or party x region, depending on the district.
Most polls, certainly most off of the voter file, use some kind of system of quotas or stratification to ensure a representative sample. So, for instance, if your target of 27% of Fla. is in southeast Florida, you can make sure that southeast Fla. is 27% of your actual sample
So, we haven't talked very much about the actual mechanics of field surveys. But some odd things happened in this PA-01 poll, along with PA-16 and MN-08, which are now fixed but are worth talking about in the category of 'murphy's law of polling' https://t.co/Tv7a3FSbz1

At the very least, it's crazy that this data, collected at ridiculous expense, essentially goes to die after 1.5 generic stories, when it could combined with the essentially identical data from other organizations to answer questions their journalists actually care about
I like national polls. But the major political stories of our time are subnational, whether playing out in states, districts, or in demographic groups. TBH, I'd love to see new orgs get together and start pooling on some N=5000+ national polls instead of their own n=1500

@TylerDinucci it's a CD where reg Dems are 43% of RVs, and this is a moderate GOP incumbent who is thought to be favored on personal brand. he should have real inroads there. pretty typical for Rs to bleed some reg. GOP voters in the Northeast
Maybe it's just easier in a federal contest. But it's interesting
One thing I had forgotten was how many undecided voters we had in our final VA-GOV poll in 2017. It was 43-40, Northam. Basically none of our polls have so many undecided voters now, though they're essentially identical.
@neeratanden @jmartNYT @GregoryBTrotte1 @CharlesPPierce @BetoORourke @geoffgarin @DemGovs you said 'polls had northam down.' jmart's point was that polls had him up 3 to 4. this seems like an example of that
@neeratanden @jmartNYT @GregoryBTrotte1 @CharlesPPierce @BetoORourke @geoffgarin @DemGovs our baseline is based on the post-trump elections. basically, better than '16 for dems among white voters. something halfway in between 14/16 for nonwhite voters, which in texas is a real problem. the poll is then adjusted based on who tells us they'll vote
@neeratanden @jmartNYT @GregoryBTrotte1 @CharlesPPierce @BetoORourke @geoffgarin @DemGovs seems like jmart's point, but i forgot how many more undecideds there were then (and in '16) than in our current polls
@TylerDinucci i think the 5% under the Rep w/Dems is the more telling number
Obviously, minor candidates can fade down the stretch, esp in a race like this when major candidates aren't known and the campaign breaks fairly late for a lot of voters. But this is an area with a pretty decent history of supporting independent candidates.
A little more specifically on Sandman: he has 10% of Trump disapprovers, v. 2% of those who approve; 10% in Duluth, 5% in Iron Range/Rural, 2% in Minn. Exurbs.
Why didn't we ask third party in wave 1? IMO, it's kind of a waste to ask about third party cands when people don't know mjr cands, though MN8 was an arguable case.	To that point, I'll note that the "no opinion" numbers on Stauber/Radinovich have fallen to 33/32 from 45/51
@electionsmith in footnote
That said, we are now asking minor party candidates in our final (as you may have seen in our Senate polls) and Ray Sandman is a big factor so far. He's at 5 percent, and plainly taking from Trump disapprovers/Radinovich almost exclusively in Duluth/Iron Range.
We're at 288 in MN-08, where the Republican Pete Stauber is out to a surprising 20 point lead so far. 	This sample is pretty unbalanced under the hood. Heavily weighted. Stauber only up 10 in the unweighted sample, and I'd guess this closes up quite a bit https://t.co/EdOzHkE9dv
We're over the 400 mark in PA-01, where the Scott Wallace (D) is out to a surprising lead over Brian Fitzpatrick (R, inc). OTOH, most of our remaining calls will probably go to registered GOP, which often predicts who makes late gains in our polling   https://t.co/8vGP3c7TjM
But you wouldn't see the Democrats winning a lot of the even more conservative places that they've put into play.	Again, not saying it's going to happen, but this strikes me as a possibility
In fact, if you model the country based on Virginia, places like Iowa would be among the places where Dems gained the most over Trump
I'd also note, by the way, that there's nothing inconsistent with a more polarized electorate and Dem strength in a CD like IA01 or IA03, or statewide throughout the Midwest. In VAGOV, Northam actually outperformed Clinton the most in white, rural areas  https://t.co/61wxDoxEZk
I'm one of the few people who thinks that Virginia was a great model for the GOP in 2018. It probably isn't a "winning" model anymore. Too many Republicans retired. But it is a way to keep it close in the House and maybe even gain in the Senate
And I'd note that we do have a recent precedent for this happening: the Virginia general. It was a great night for Democrats in Clinton country. But Gillespie and Republicans held up elsewhere, in no small part by polarizing the electorate along Trumpy issues
There is some other evidence to support it, like the Fox Senate polls. But in general, there's been a gap between where we've been polling (Trump Country) and everyone else (purple states and blue districts). I'd like to see more overlap
I feel like that has abruptly come to an end in our data. I'd like to see some others show it before I went too far with it, especially since this has been an emotional period where non-response seems like it could be a real factor.
One of the key features of this year's special elections (though not VA/NJ generals) + pre-Kavanaugh House/Senate polls was the extent that Democrats were really able to do well in red states/districts
@PhillyDemMPA struck
I don't think there's a ton of evidence to support this yet, but I am starting to wonder whether we're going to be really struck by the extent that the electorate became more polarized along the lines of the 2016 presidential election during the Kavanaugh nomination fight

@xenocryptsite we have NV registered voters at 60/19 in our poll, weighting to voter file race and here using self-report
It is possible, of course, that there is just no way he's going to get in striking distance, let alone over the top, in a state as polarized as Texas. But that's not something you can learn from the polls
I actually agree with this, though I'm not sure it's because of the Reuters poll. I just don't think it would take much for Beto to be in striking distance       https://t.co/ebqZxa4Ftm
Illinois 6 was one of the first races we polled. Roskam (R, inc) led by &lt;1 pt, but the underlying challenge was clear: Trump -21 approval, D+7 gen ballot, a -2 favorability rating. 	Today, it's now a "Lean Dem" CD, per Cook. Will be a fun repoll
I will say this: in a close national House election, I can easily imagine Beto coat-tails getting Dems over in TX07, TX32

Wow that‚Äôs enough for an Ossoff campaign https://t.co/rREXIwbMiA
@Redistrict The period between 50 and 150 is a little weird because we‚Äôre gradually blending in the weights. If a sample, hypothetically, were too D, every new unaffiliated, undecided vote would still yield increased R vote share during this period as R voters got more weight w each response
The bottom-line is: I don't feel like I can do a very good job of predicting when our results are probably "right" or "wrong." Not based on crosstabs. Not based on other indicators. And that's even though I have a lot more data than everyone else does to assess it.
Personally, I expected better Dem results in NV/TEX when we started. But since we started, Marist/Quinnipiac have posted nearly exactly the same results. We don't usually get that luxury in House races.
We've had several polls that felt like they were probably off, that have been subsequently confirmed by reporting or other data. That's not to say we don't/won't have outliers. I'm just saying it's very hard to know when they happen in these underpolled contests.
All of this said, polls are going to be noisy. The margin of error is real, and you get to see that. But in all seriousness, if you're dismissing polls that don't fit your prior, you're making a big mistake.
Many of my Dem followers, I'll point out, note when nonwhite/women/young voters are a little too Republican, but rarely notice (or if they do, certainly don't complain) when white/men/older voters are too Dem. Often times, thanks to party weighting, those things can be linked
During this TX poll, early on there were tabs that showed Beto losing big among young voters. All, like, 15 of them. My feed was full people complaining. In the end, Beto won 58-32 or but the topline barely budged, because *older* Dem voters had been upweighted to compensate.
And I am surprised that this lesson hasn't seeped in. You've seen results shift *dramatically* from n=25 or n=50 to 150 let alone 400. So why are you expecting precision out of crosstabs of similar size?
In all seriousness, I think that if you *really* pay attention to these polls and how the results evolve over real time, I think you're forced to conclude that these ways of looking at polls are often pretty useless
Another type sees a result that doesn't match their prior and then dismisses a result out of hand. I can go on. You know all the things
I can find myself in this category myself sometimes. One common type sees a topline that doesn't feel right and then goes into the crosstabs and finds something that's off and then dismisses the whole thing
In general, I think live polling has generally been a success in the ways we hoped it would be, in terms of helping people understand polling, etc.	But there's one group who has been particularly hard to crack: political types who know a little too much for their own good

@nealdikeman @UpshotNYT @nytimes @LarrySharpe you're in the poll. do you want to know your vote share?
NY-1, final. Zeldin (R, inc) 49, Gershon (D) 41	Like the other lean/likely R races in Trump Country we're wrapping up, this isn't a great result really for either side. GOP would like to be farther ahead here; Dems not exactly positioned to win, either.  https://t.co/iKO9JRVPek
PA-16, final. Kelly (R, inc) 50, DiNicola 42	Not a real surprise in a lean/likely GOP race. Kind of something for everyone to be pleased with: yes, Dems showing strength in a tough CD; no, probably not a Dem breakthrough  https://t.co/Y7B2gliSHD

We have our first respondent in Texas. 799 to go. 	Pace will be pretty slow until 6 or 7 ET. https://t.co/yQ9xD1EysO
Our turnout estimate for Texas is maybe a hair higher than I would have guessed it would be, at 6.3 million people. That number will probably increase with final voter registrations. 2014 turnout was 4.6 million.
Interestingly, Nevada is the first place I've noticed in a while where our prior isn't for white Democratic turnout to be notably higher than white Republican turnout
What do you know. FiveThirtyEight has TX/TN/NV as the three likeliest Senate tipping-point states right now. https://t.co/utmloZawT7
I'm surprised by the number of people who don't think TX-SEN is important. I understand being tired of the amount of coverage it gets, but at this point it's arguably the Senate tipping-point state...
I also feel like we can afford the detour because we've polled a few races that I don't think will necessarily require a re-poll (IA1, MN2, TX31 etc). It is also possible that these Senate races won't merit a repoll, if Blackburn is up like 10 or whatever (which seems possible)
NV/TN/TX, OTOH, seem uncertain enough that 1 poll, right now, would meaningfully shape my view. Not much public polling in last month. And while one poll in MO wouldn't shake me, another R+8 v. R+2 in TN/TX, or tie v. D+4 in NV, is really important for overall control
The context seems clear. AZ tilt D. MO/FL are very close. IN/WV/MT tilt/lean D. Nothing we'd poll would merit a reassessment of those races. An ND poll would be important enough, but we're not prepared to poll it on the fly (no voter registration there)
We're taking a quick detour to the Senate, specifically to NV/TN/TX. I think the race for House/Senate evolved in a few ways that make it feel worth it.

Based on replies, it sound like this has been happening *a lot* this year.

I don't know that I've ever seen a state political ad on national TV? I'm sure it's happened but I just don't think I've seen it myself
Wow, got a GA-GOV ad during the Braves game (for Abrams)
Partially. The GOP has other geographic advantages as well. But I do think the race for the House would essentially be over without gerrymandering, and it would be something more like a true tossup on the 2014 map, before VA/PA/NC/FL were redrawn. https://t.co/dCdQTtLdNT
Today we're back in the field in NY01, IL14, NC13 and PA16. 	Four Trump CDs with GOP incumbents, only up single digits. 	Dems don't need any of these four districts. But they need breakthroughs, somewhere, by/on Election Night.	A long month to go.   	https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
This has always been the danger for the Democrats. The GOP's one big, potential advantage in this election is the House's political geography. If they could take advantage of it, by driving House results towards pres results, it's a very long night, even in a 06/10-type wave.
Probably relatedly, this is also the pattern in our polls. Dems have comfortably led enough of our polls to be at +18. There are then another ~20 races within 5 points. Dems wouldn't  need many. But they haven't actually led in most of them. There's a lot of GOP &lt; +3/4.
Maybe the easiest way to summarize this fact: the FiveThirtyEight forecast, last I looked, had Democrats favored to win +33 seats, well over the 23 they need. 	But FiveThirtyEight only had them favored in 218 individual contests, precisely the number needed for a majority
The Democrats have put a long list of Republican-leaning districts into play. But it's not clear whether they actually lead in a lot of them.	That means there's still a wide range of possible outcomes in the fight for control of the House 	https://t.co/4Eon15pI6g
Michigan 11, final. Stevens (D) 45, Epstein (R) 37	More undecided voters than any we've conducted so far. Both candidates name ID &lt; 50% in this open race in a fairly expensive market. 	https://t.co/MaITUfWUn0
@DCclone no, it's 25 people
I like using the raw weighted Ns like this. I think it makes the margin of error more intuitive to people than "45-42"  https://t.co/eVa5mkpUPw
In IL-14 right now, for instance, we have R+12 by primary vote, R+10 on the generic ballot, R+8 party ID, yet Trump-4 approval and R+3 on horse race
I have also been surprised by the extent that the generic ballot lines up a lot more with party registration than the other indicators, including house vote
I have to say, one of my favorite things about jumping into so many states is seeing the varying relationship between party ID, party reg, vote choice/pres approval	https://t.co/yK3VhRGUaI
We're at 299 respondents in IL-14, where Hultgren (R, inc) has a 3 point lead over Underwood, 45 to 42 (D) in a Trump CD.	A very long way to go, but Hultgren fav/name ID is quite weak and there are a lot of conflicted voters (Trump disapprove v. R gballot)	https://t.co/cKuyltLeit

@steveschale while i have you, what's your best guess on statewide florida turnout right now
We're at around N=447 in Michigan 11, where Stevens (D) has a 45 to 37 lead. I don't know how much more we're going to get here, and could wind up calling it well before N=500.   https://t.co/MaITUfWUn0
Texas 31, final. Carter (R) 53, Hegar (D) 38	Hegar, despite being a national phenom, still has extremely low name-ID (but highly positive among those who know her) so some upside for her 	Cruz lead here consistent with about Cruz+4 or 5 statewide	https://t.co/1QN0QsRfG6
One change from the prior iterations of this chart. I've dropped the presidential approval control from the model, because it seems like the president's approval rating simultaneous ticked up during the period.
It should be noted, though, that he basically just fell to a few points above the president's approval rating.
We've been tracking Kavanaugh support since the allegations broke a few weeks ago. His support fell a lot after the hearing. 	At the beginning, he ran well ahead of the president's approval rating. By the end, all about the same. https://t.co/EuWvNIiQ6k
I'll point out that there's a case that polls tend to underestimate Democrats in the Sun Belt and underestimate Republicans in white working class areas. Could be a contributing factor.
(this was published during the kavanaugh hearing and I just realized I never tweeted it)
Who's undecided? Less educated voters, which might mean upside for the Republicans in the north and upside for Democrats in the Sun Belt... if they can take advantage of it  https://t.co/KDkmENaAoj
We're over 60,000 calls made in Michigan 11, the most of any district yet,  for a mere 415 respondents. 	Haley Stevens (D) leads by 8 at the moment, 46 to 38 percent  https://t.co/MaITUfWUn0
North Carolina 9, final. Harris (R) 47, McCready (D) 42	Again, feels like part of a pattern of GOP consolidating a bit in Trump/Romney-type conservative districts https://t.co/8G0BHhmQLz

Tonight, Pennsylvania 16 https://t.co/Y7B2gliSHD
Another possibility--that I think I could defend, but probably shoudn't/wont'--is that Democrats are really killing it in suburbs, but not exurbs. I do think that's a pattern in our polling. But I'm concerned I'm just trying to read a pattern into noise
I think the likeliest answer is that it's just noise. These are small samples. The margin of error is real. Part of the reason we do this live is so you can see that for yourself. You saw, for instance, that Slotkin led our poll at N=400. And we'll see how much MI11 changes.
It's a good question. 	Methodologically, the two polls are identical. The districts are adjacent. The demographics aren't identical, but similar enough. Yeah, Bishop's an incumbent but that doesn't explain the whole thing. 	https://t.co/4d2AhQBWol
@Redistrict @dccc That may be a good thing on this particular scandal
Michigan 11 is a true slog. Our lowest response rate yet, beating out neighboring MI 8. On the other hand, the Democratic margin is large enough that, if it holds, we probably just won't poll it again https://t.co/MaITUfWUn0
Some surprise that we'd poll NY01, it seems. 	I think it's interesting. Dems held this district recently. It's anObama/Trump CD. It's suburban. GSG (D) just had a poll with Zeldin+3. This is the kind of "likely Rep" CD worth checking in on, IMO. 	https://t.co/iKO9JRVPek

@jpodhoretz there is, it's just a regression of whether republicans have been likelier to say they're going to vote post v. pre-kavanaugh
@jpodhoretz *than they were before
@jpodhoretz i'm just talking about whether they say they're likelier to vote when they were before. whether they'll actually do so is obviously another question
And by 0, i mean a coefficient of .00125 over several thousand interviews
One thing that is easier for us to judge is whether the GOP is likelier to turnout. We have absolutely zero increase in GOP intention to turnout, relative to Dems, since the hearing	We do have a slight overall uptick though
It's harder to judge our polls because there isn't as much context from other public surveys, but it does seem to me that we've also had the GOP suddenly doing very well lean-Republican, Trump CDs since Kav (va02, oh01, tx31, mi08, maybe nc09 next) https://t.co/qKjDjKjiE5

@CalyxxT @ForecasterEnten thank you, caly
Anyway, it's a few days of polls in a unique news environment that could easily fade, reverse or continue. In general, I'm pretty circumspect about modest shifts of this sort and I'll be more interested if it lasts
It might seem contradictory, but Kavanaugh's numbers started *much* better than Trump/generic ballot, etc. Possible that polarizing the electorate along Kavanaugh is pretty decent for the GOP, esp in red areas, even if he's less popular than he was
There's a pretty decent amount of evidence at this point that both	A) Kavanugh's popularity has dropped	B) The GOP has gained 	since the Kavanaugh hearing.	Obviously, doesn't matter if it doesn't last. But it's interesting. 	https://t.co/H9V5MIpiJb

Poller coaster ride in MI-08. We could easily stop at N=400, or 420 or wherever. Poll's fine. But many would, wrongly, feel very differently about this poll at Slotkin+2 or Bishop+1 (or wherever it ends). Polls are fuzzy and that's ok https://t.co/DRKnWH5d81 https://t.co/wW9k9Rh8JS
@JustCameron__ i misread your bio to mean that you were a professor and was holding to a higher standard, so i apologize. that said, i really do think that crosstab diving is often a bad way to look at polling. and discounting a poll because it doesn't meet your prior is problematic, too
@JustCameron__ --The gender point is bad. I could just as easily say that I don't buy Bishop up just 1 with men.	--The poll isn't even done!	--Even a perfect poll isn't going to nail the result/ If you want to 'buy' our polls as such, please go elsewhere and don't bother me
@JustCameron__ Well, 	--Dems released an internal that has them up 4, so split the difference	--Internals usually give a boost bc of selective release. Certainly true here, but proximate cause (CLF) is external	--Education is a huge factor here. Many partisan pollsters still don't do it.
@JustCameron__ bad take, through and through
NC09 is going to be a long and potentially rocky road. We'll need to work hard for responses from Mecklenburg/Union Counties, and results *could* swing fast once we start to get them given current heavy weights  https://t.co/8G0BHhmQLz

We're over the 400 mark in MN02 where Angie Craig (D) has a wide lead over Jason Lewis (R, inc). Poll feels a little hot for the Dems (and we can't weight by party in MN), but it certainly cements the view that Craig is a clear favoreite https://t.co/dJKDdvfDZY

So why is NC09 in weighting purgatory? The design effect there is at 1.7, about as high as FL26 at its worst.	The reason: a huge gap in response by region. Eastern part of CD = 65% of the sample, 2x its share of the final electorate. Will take a while  https://t.co/8G0BHhmQLz

@ForecasterEnten wait. that's not what your screenshots usually look like. when did you make the flip?
One thing they do have in common: a well-above average number of black voters, who at least in our data aren't particularly unified behind the Democratic candidate despite all but unanimous opposition to the president. And GOP resilience in diverse areas has been a trend
OH1 doesn't surprise me a ton tbh, given the district and the attacks on Pureval. VA-02 is a real surprise. Taylor seemed quite vulnerable. Or could be an outlier; n=500 house polls are noisy, and Taylor really owned the last two days of interviews. Or maybe not.
Meanwhile, everything else we're polling right now just feels a little bit... weird. We can't get anyone to pickup the phone in MI08, which is in weighting purgatory. Dems are running wild in MN02, and well in AZ02. But GOP is posting maybe it's two best results yet in OH01/VA02

Our poll could certainly prove to be an outlier, but the dramatic increase in Luria name rec and unfavs, and the rebound in Taylor favs is interesting and plausible to me given the timing involved
On the GOP side, the June Dem poll had Taylor at 41/27 and the early Sept one had it 33/33, right after the big scandal broke/special prosecutor.	Now, our poll is 40/25.
In VA2, we have Taylor up 8--a great result for the GOP. The last poll, in early Sept., was Luria+8. A total reversal.	Was there a change? Maybe.	Luria (D) favs in our poll: 35/31	In the early Sept. Dem poll: 34/8
My computer is working right now, so I thought I'd pass the time by looking at some of the other polls out there in the races where we're in the field, and the differences are interesting
RT @npfandos: Here's the letter: https://t.co/kUSIJA0eh0
Also, in general, our productivity was incredible on Thursday night (day of Senate hearings) and it's just been terrible since then. Some could just be going from worknight to weekend. But still, extremely pronounced dropoff
Michigan 8 is the hardest district we've polled yet. At the moment, we're on track to need more than 60k calls. 	Not surprisingly, such low response rate = a messy sample. Way too educated. Will take a while before this sorts out  https://t.co/DRKnWH5d81
Taking our VA02 and OH01 polls together right now (n=131):	Trump approval: 3/90	Gen ballot: 86D-8R	GOP incumbent favorability: 20/42	House horse race: 76D-R18
McGrath raising $3 million is one thing.	I'm talking about non-celebrity House Dem cands raising $1/2 million so often you're going to get bored of it https://t.co/iayMq2Ha6w
@keith_d_m_g Cincinatti is 26% of the sample v. 23% of the likely electorate
This is a pattern in our polls so far, including our poll in VA02 which also has a pretty large black vote. GOP incumbents are, in general, doing much better than the national party among nonwhite voters. A challenge for Dems, but also an opportunity down the stretch
Another thing that's interesting is that Chabot is doing well among black voters. He has a 15/79 deficit, even though Trump approval among black voters here is 2/95 and the generic ballot is D88, R5
One thing that's interesting is that the favorables are pretty close. Chabot 42/38; Pureval 39/36. But Chabot is holding strong with Republicans in this poll, particularly white no-degree Republicans, and this is a pretty conservative district.
We're nearing the 400 respondent mark in Ohio 1, where Steve Chabot (R, inc) has a pretty surprising 10 point lead over Aftab Pureval (D). If it holds, it's a very good result for the GOP 	https://t.co/UnBfT2BPKC
@svbremner they do their own polls and they‚Äôd be insane to do it on one of our pollls alone
I will say, though, that you can‚Äôt triage this many folks (add MI08 too) and still really be trying to hold the majority
We‚Äôve had a few polls with surprising Dem leads that kind of seemed crazy to me. Paulson, then Coffman, then Yoder, then MacArthur. The first three all seem like they‚Äôre being triaged. Definitely wondering whether that pattern is going to continue in NJ03
We had Davids up 8 and thought it seemed a little crazy at the time. Maybe not. https://t.co/jBRGYn7U1M
And I‚Äôm not just talking about the Betos of the world. I mean deep into the House battleground
I think we‚Äôre going to see some shattering Dem fundraising numbers this quarter.
I do think it's interesting that Michigan response rates are low so far. I don't know if it's representative; it's our first time here. Would be interested to hear from other pollsters. And it seems noteworthy given the high-profile misses there in recent years
Meanwhile, in Minnesota 2, we have a sample that's 2 to 1 women at about the 100-mark. We can just call more men if it comes to it, but that result might one might also look weird for a while. Odd polling day, that's for sure
It also has me wondering, by the way, whether the folks triaging Bishop are weighting by education
We're way too educated so far (40% postgrad). At this early stage, it's basically impossible for the poll to have the right number of Dems and postgrads. So right now, sample is *both* too educated and too GOP. That will change over time, but could be messy in interim
MI08 is our lowest response rate district yet, and as a result I think it's going to be a surprising addition to the FL26/TX32 weighting/design effect/volatility purgatory for a while.
*Marquez Peterson	*Tucson. i'm tired
To be fair, I can see why the NRCC would be intrigued here. Kirkpatrick does not seem well-liked. And Peterson seems relatively strong w/Hispanic voters and Hispanic turnout in the poll is low. But the white vote in Tuscan does not seem like it's in any mood to vote Republican
We're also nearing the 400 respondent mark in Arizona 2, where Ann Kirkpatrick (D) has an 11 point lead in an open seat that was already thought to lean Democratic. NRCC still spending money here though, to my understanding https://t.co/SsjFn0lAbv
We're nearing the 400 respondent mark in Iowa 3, where Cindy Axne (D) and David Young (R, inc) have been trading the lead back and forth around 43% each.	Still time, but not a good result for the GOP if it finishes around here, regardless of who's ahead	https://t.co/0eyDxQXjYC

Upon closer examination, it seems to me that this *is* actually a poll of ALL voters, despite the article saying that it's a poll of voters over 50. I think they did the horse race for all, and the issue questions for 50+. But I'm open to another interpretation.

@clonedbefore no single day N value would give me too much confidence, no
On the other hand, do note the N. We have more than 6000 interviews, including 800 today, and we have a lot we can control for between interview responses and data on the voter file.
Also the y-axis probably makes this look bigger than it is, both by using 'net' support. So please note the scale.

A long way to go in VA-2, but one thing that's important here is the African American vote, the unsung base of Dems in VA. 	This is one of the few battlegrounds with a large black vt, and so far it's interesting. Trump is at 3/88. Dem gb lead is 88/4. But Luria is only up 76/17

Washington 8, final. Schrier (D) 46, Rossi (R) 45	America's greatest district posts our second closest result yet, trailing only Kentucky 6	https://t.co/GI69m66WxI
501 gives Schrier a proper 1 pt lead, after rounding. Still up 46-45 on the rounded topline
Based on twitter comments on this race, I'm not sure people appreciate that:	--Rossi is like an incumbent. 3 statewide races, winning this CD each time. Fav/ID better than most inc. we've polled.	--WA8 is *not* mainly affluent eastside burbs. Not a particularly well-educated CD
500 is undecided and the race is still tied, but yet it still gets Schrier back to 46-45, thanks to rounding and maybe some downstream effects on weighting
Ooh condition one might be met. Rossi gets it back to a tie at n=499. Though I have no idea whether this will be one of those polls where we keep going past 500
At this rate, Rossi's going to retake the lead and tomorrow I'm going to wake-up finding 20 more respondents from King County
Wow, 4 in a row makes it Schrier 46, Rossi 45 at N=497. 	Rossi has seen this before amirite
Wow Schrier claiming 3 in a row to take a nominal lead, though tied still at 46-46. 	...now wait for this to play out over 3 weeks of mail ballots

Democrats have enjoyed some really really big advantages in turnout intention in some of these polls. Some of these electorates (R+7 in CA45, R+4 in CA49) strike me as really tough on the GOP. But maybe not. (More importantly, Dems generally still lead w/worse turnout)

I don't think it's hard to see why this is a tough area for the GOP. Lots of well-educated Democrats and not very diverse, so not much holding Dems back on turnout. Tarrifs probably play worse here than anywhere. It's always been a counter-cyclical region in politics, too

Doesn't necessarily lend credibility to any given poll, but it does mean that I'm not sitting here stressing about whether there's something odd on the methodology side. And doesn't mean this won't prove to be an outlier. N=500 house polls are going to be noisy, and that's ok
One fun thing about this project is that, at this point, we've done multiple polls in several state. So this KS03 poll is truly identical, across the board, to a KS02 poll we did a week ago. CA49 is the same as CA48, etc.

Anyway, we're going to push these changes in TX32. The results will move.	The main thing I'm watching: the design effect. We're at ~1.6. The goal is to be less than 1.4, which is the 'warning' criteria	How much closer will we get by going from 4 to 3 categories of edu and age?
@DrewSutton20 @alltimehighdebt dems have like a 20 pt lead among young voters in our polls so far. you just don't notice in TX07 or something when it's 78-10 with a similarly small sample the other way. they're small samples. you get weird things at n=10.
@tub_e_o yes, basically. so in TX32, at some point, we're going to hit our target for white voters and keep calling nonwhite voters
We're not going to change anything about the display. Even if we weight by 18-39 year olds, we'll still show you our terrible response among 18-29 year olds in these districts.
Anyway, these changes were already planned based on prior tough Sun Belt CDs. They're good moves, based on the underlying data not effect on the results (which I didn't even simulate in our prior CDs bc I don't want my judgment about method to be effected by this)
In our summer testing, we found that &gt;98% of our respondents are the people who we want.	But if we get a response rate of 1/250 among young people, that 2% measurement error starts to be a significant portion of the category
We're also redefining the way we calculate age, by taking the self-reported age of our respondents, not voter file age. 	Basically: our response rate among young voters is so bad in these few CDs that our young voters are contaminated by parents taking polls for their kids
All of this is really quite minor stuff. But we're going to implement these changes in TX32 today, midstream, in part because it's been the toughest district yet of these polls. We're dropping from 4 categories of age to 3 categories of age, and 4 categories of education to 3
The changes announced yesterday deal with this problem. We're going to weight by just slightly broader categories of age and education. We're also moving to stratify the sample by more categories than we have in the past.
In TX07/FL26, we spent a lot of time with a design effect far over 1.4 and ultimately got back under 1.4 in the end. In TX32, we're stuck at an atrocious 1.56 at n=406, and more sampling probably won't fix it as easily
If you've been following closely over the last few weeks, you might have noticed something called our "design effect," a measure of how much we're weighting. We average about a 1.2. Over 1.4 is bad, and generates warnings on the page.
Basically, most of our polls are weighted pretty heavily by fairly granular categories. 	In the Sun Belt, that's been an issue.	The added diversity of those CDs = more categories.	The samples have been particularly tough, so more weighting needed too
Well now that I'll have everyone's attention, this is the right time to talk about some slight weighting changes we'll be making in (primarily) Sun Belt districts, which were announced yesterday in this piece and will be implemented today https://t.co/SjaDdmsI07
RT @nytmike: EXCLUSIVE: Rosenstein discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to oust Trump in the days after Comey was fired in May 2017. Rosen‚Ä¶
C) These aren't substantive changes. We're not weighting by new categories. We're not changing our likely voter model. We're simplifying the same targets.	And I think it'll be informative to show how even this minor tweak (3 cats of age v. 4, etc.) can make a difference
B) You can see why for yourself. Unlike our prior polls, we're over N=400 and our design effect is still over 1.56. You can see that's never happened in our prior tough districts, including TX7 and FL26. And it's unlikely to just sort itself out through more sampling.
A) These are changes we were already intending to make, and already said as much yesterday. They just weren't implemented before the start of TX32. 	So this isn't a one time thing, this reflects a considered assessment of all of our prior Sun Belt polls. 	https://t.co/SjaDdmsI07
Slept on it. We're going to make the changes midstream in TX32. 	Wasn't my initial instinct. But, there are three main reasons why I'm comfortable doing it.
@tatchity i think it's right?

Anyway, going to sleep on it. The move would be fairly simple: go from 4 to 3 categories of age, 4 to 3 categories of race, 4 to 3 categories of education. We'll do it going forward in these tough CDs. Question is whether to do it midstream in TX32
@alltimehighdebt lol the real problem is that it's 10 people
@Will_Hanc it says so explicitly https://t.co/mxkHa7Hl60
RT @Will_Hanc: @Nate_Cohn So you are saying that you don't think you TX32 poll is overly reliable?
@terryscanlon for instance, making sure we have the right number of people who have a HS/Some College/BA/Postgrad v. College/No College, or 1829/3044/4564/65+ v. 1844/4564/65
The combination of both lower quality samples on the front end *and* more diverse districts with more categories for weighting is just a little too much at N=500
Well, I don't know if we're going to make a move mid-poll in TX32. I'd guess we don't.	But I do think it's safe to say that the fairly elaborate weights we've used in the past are just a little bit too much for these Sun Belt CDs, like FL26, TX07, TX32.

Right now, our most heavily weighted responses are both Dems and Reps. But it would take only a couple responses from the right/wrong categories for that to take a turn

Now, in a lower turnout midterm electorate, this is a tricky proposition.	We know *lots* of low turnout Dems will vote.	But what if the low turnout Dems who vote, this time, are the ones who actually support Democrats, while the conflicted ones stay home?
This, I should note, is the major reason why our final polls i NC/FL were better for Trump than other polls (or, at least, better than they would have been). There were a lot of lower turnout, white, registered Dems in those states who voted Trump, and we picked that up
greater than 85% chance of voting
Take WV03. Among reg Democratic voters who, based on their vote history, have a &gt;85% of chance of winning, we think Ojeda leads 70-21. Among less regular Dem voters, it's 51-40. 	So if you don't work for those low turnout Dems, you're going to show Ojeda ahead
Keep in mind, though, that when I refer to 'high turnout' here I'm referring to fixed characteristics like whether you've voted in a primary before. So, if your "Democrats" only include primary voters, your poll is going to be too good for Democrats
Well, I can tell you is that:	a) Response is correlated with high turnout	b) Democratic response rates are really high, especially among high turnout Dems	c) High turnout Dems are *wayyy* more supportive of Dem candidates than low turnout Dems 	https://t.co/v0xtGbodtd

But in the more traditionally GOP Sun Belt CDs--like Orange County, TX23, TX07, CA25--the Dems are basically tied with or in some cases behind the GOP among well-educated whites.
The key factor in these diverse CDs, it seems to me, is whether the Democrats actually have a big lead among well-educated white voters. In those places, like CO06 or VA10, they can make-up for lower nonwhite turnout with higher well-educated white turnout.
On paper, CA25 and CA39 (where Monmouth found the GOP ahead earlier today) seem like they ought to be drifting into the lean Democratic category. Maybe in time, but not quite yet.
It's late here on the East Coast, but Steve Knight (R, inc) is still very much in the race in CA25 at N=423, keeping up a pattern of Democrats getting hobbled a bit by weak Hispanic turnout in the Sun Belt 	https://t.co/sevovKLS11

And it looks like we're going into the field early in our next district, which I suspect we'll publish in the morning
Interestingly, NM02 is also the only district we've polled that opposes an assault gun ban.
But I don't think our electorate here is crazy. RVs are 41% hispanic on the L2 voter file, and this is a 32.7% hispanic likely electorate by same measure. 2016 was 36.3%, 2014 turnout is 31
Under the hood, Hispanic engagement is pretty low. Disproportionately likely to be undecided and less likely to be 'almost certain to vote.'	The upside for Ds: decent chance w/undecideds, despite GOP CD	The upside for Rs: maybe we're overestimating Hispanic turnout by a bit

We're starting to poll on taxes and tarrifs this week, then health care. I'd guess this immigration question will be a better one for the GOP than anything else. But we'll see!
I will say, though, that a GOP immigration bill that a) builds a wall; b) reduces legal immigration is a little more popular than I would have guessed. It is unpopular, to be clear. It's opposed 42-53. But that's honestly pretty good as far as GOP issues go right now
On the assault weapons/high-capacity magazine ban, in contrast, the Dem position looks a lot better. 	58-38 support overall, including in a lead in all 10 of the 11 CDs we polled it in. NM02, which isn't done yet, being the exception
So far in our polls, "abolish ICE" is opposed by a 29-62 margin, including by a majority of registered Democrats/prior Dem primary voters, Hispanic voters, and 18-29 year olds	To be clear, it's not a nationally representative sample. It's 7 CDs. But it doesn't lead w/any group

@KolYisrael @Redistrict yeah, we're giving it less attention. FL26/TX07 are two of the hardest districts in the country
One interesting thing in FL26 is that our final turnout estimate, at least at the moment, is more bullish on Democratic turnout than anything else https://t.co/39D56zsqDw

@KolYisrael @Redistrict i think it's that good. one of the oldest electorates in the country
One live-poll pro-tip: the candidate on the left is the candidate in the 'lead,' even if only by a couple tenths of a point
On NM02, though. As I said at the beginning, this is one of my favorite open races and I think it's a big risk to the GOP. 	Still a ways to go, but I'll point out that Torres-Small has great favorability ratings and is running 10 points ahead of the generic ballot in NM02

And another highly valued voter or two gets Culberson's lead down to 6 and, for those following on expert model, also has our design effect down to 1.37, which isn't great but it's out of the 'unacceptable' range https://t.co/pEAaAJOrvk
I can't really tell whether it's working or not tbh. But that is the goal here and I think if it succeeds for even a modest number of people that it's worth it, given just how much polling shapes political discourse   https://t.co/WGq799jWxe
For instance: I believe a 'don't know' respondent managed to knock a point off of Culberson's margin, simply by reducing the weight of an up-weighted Culberson voter
We've avoided this in FL26 so far. We've had 4 or 5 &gt;age 65 Hispanic voters who are supporting the Democrat running the show w4x weight for a while. But as we run through call backs, things could (though won't necessarily) change quite quickly
One thing about these unrepresentative Sun Belt samples is that they're pretty volatile if the 'right' respondent from an underrepresented cell comes in. So you can get a lurch like this in TX07 from just a couple folks, while others from overrepresented groups barely matter https://t.co/B6seZBalmt
Gotta say, these Sun Belt metro districts are really hard. Harder than we would have guessed just based on our pooled national data. 	One measure is our design effect, or how much we're weighting. I'd say &lt;1.4 is tolerable, and we've never been that high (including prior yrs) https://t.co/AEcGP26CxT
Kansas 2, final: Davis (D) 45, Watkins (R) 44	A fairly clear story in this Trump+18 CD:	Davis fav: 37/27	Watkins fav: 21/26	Generic ballot: GOP+8	https://t.co/SqgxE7Yrjm
Wow, speaking of: Davis goes on a 4 blue dot run to take a 1 pt lead.   https://t.co/SqgxE7Yrjm
And in the end, the goal of this project is for you to kind of keep that in mind with *every* poll you see. 	If this were a final poll, this poll is just as 'good' or 'bad' regardless of whether the final 20 blue/red dots push us to the side that ultimately won
We're back in the field for our final few interviews in KS02, where the race is tied at N=482. Will be fun to see whether anyone claims a lead.	And, regardless of what happens, remember how easily it could go either way, just by chance	https://t.co/SqgxE7Yrjm

No, I'm unhappy about the design effect, which is basically a measure of how much statistical power we've lost due to weighting. If you want to follow along, it's in the footnote 	1.2 is our average, which is fine. i'm not happy at 1.4. 1.7 is horrendous. 	https://t.co/Q6UGxC60SI

In the House, it's more important to get a broad sense of the battleground than to nail down any particular district. In the Senate, we'd do more https://t.co/2zCfEua7eE
In contrast, there's all sorts of stuff that's weird and/or problematic about our FL-26 sample. We'll see how that one shakes out. There's still time. But if the underlying numbers finish as they do now, I can safely say that there's plenty to improve/fix before our final poll
So, look, I wouldn't take any of our polls to the bank. You just can't do that at N=500. But, I don't see anything that's weird here
I'd also note that we have a similar result in MN03, another Clinton+9 well-educated suburb without a strong GOP tradition (unlike, say, Orange County or something, it voted for Obama).
It's important to remember that these are N=500 House polls. They're noisy. The margin of error is real, which we hope you see for yourself. 	That said, this is outside of the MoE  and party reg (even), Trump approval (37), genballot (D+14) are all reasonable for a Clinton+9 CD
And maybe the biggest surprise we have yet is Mike Coffman (R, inc) trailing by 10 points in CO-06. If that's even in the ballpark, it's a pretty devastating result   https://t.co/3TZcSvdVWm

@ElectProject in all cds where &gt;10% hispanic
Nope. TBH this FL-26 sample is way, way short on Hispanic voters. Not even close. https://t.co/h5Qqc5aRRm
A lot of polls don't account for their design effect at all when they calculate their margin of error, which tbh kind of upsets me. Under the circumstances we have in FL26 right now, the effect can be huge: https://t.co/OamHIAEDBK
We're at N=161 right now, but with so much weighting our effective sample size is a mere 95. Should probably adjust our 'start to care' threshold to account for this
In FL26 right now though, woof. We're at 1.6, the highest we've ever had at any point of any Upshot/Siena poll. 	We don't have nearly enough nonwhite voters. More weighting = higher margin of error, and a more volatile estimate as respondents from key categories come in
If you want to follow our polls on expert mode, scroll down to the bottom and see our design effect. Basically, it's a measure of how much statistical power we've lost due to weighting. Usually, our design effect cruises up to about 1.3 and then drifts back down 1.2. Healthy
(not in TX07, changes would pbly be implemented next week)
Something to watch in TX7: how do we do with young voters. 	If I understand the mechanism explaining variance in youth productivity in our prior polls, then I think we're going to do very poorly. If true, we have a few tweaks to deal with it

@PatrickRuffini makes sense. not workin.
And Trump approval at 39 and generic ballot of D+14 feels quite reasonable (even low?) in this Clinton+9 district.
Mike Coffman (R) still trailing by 9 points with with nearly 300 respondents in CO-06. Still a ways to go, but so far it's reminiscent of our result in MN-03, another relatively white, well-educated Clinton+9 suburban district 	https://t.co/3TZcSvdVWm
@PatrickRuffini (for early cells)
@PatrickRuffini what does age look like?
It's early in CO-06, but it's definitely catching my eye that Mike Coffman is struggling to run ahead of president's approval with an R+2 sample and a relatively healthy Trump approval of 40% (he lost by 9). 	Will be interesting to see how this goes...	https://t.co/3TZcSvdVWm

If you're like @Redistrict and following every respondent in VA07, note that our results are right around 47.5-43.5, so we can bounce pretty quickly from R+5 (48-43) to R+3 (47-44). Some young voters, on the other hand, could move things more quickly, given the weight they'd get.

One subtle difference that I wonder about: question order.	Siena asks candidate favs, then horse race.	Monmouth is horse race, then favs.	Very similar favs: 	Monmouth: Faso 34/33, Delgado 36/21	Siena: Faso 37/38, Delgado 34/22	But does putting ballot test 2nd hurt unknown Dem?
Monmouth has Delgado+3 in NY19, which would be a pretty fantastic result for Dems.	Siena had Faso+5 last month.	Interestingly, Siena had Trump approval at-2 while Monmouth has Trump+2, but the horse race is flipped.	Both have Delgado strongest among older voters
TX-23, final: Hurd 51, Ortiz Jones 43.   sort of the reverse of MN3: a Clinton district, but diverse, few college grads, low turnout, and an incumbent who worked hard to distinguish himself from the party. Will be interesting to see this race in a month	https://t.co/8T0yD7ECNh

@trowaman @Redistrict i mean, you can't really do that. the sample is weighted overall. if you reverse the toplines, and hypothetically increase the hispanic/dem share of youth vote for instance, you have to downweight the hispanic/dem share of &gt;34 voters compared to how it is now
@trowaman @Redistrict overall, young voters have favored dems in our polls. what's curious is that in the handful of districts where we've really really struggled with young voters, the handful respondents we have had are gop-leaning.	not sure whether to make much of it yet. we'll see
@Redistrict i'd totally agree if this were a final poll. for september though, i could argue that i've seen what i've needed to see and that there's more value in seeing what's next
Interesting theory, though my recollection is that school would have already started? 	Either way, our response models were fit using data collected over the summer and it would be an intriguing explanation for a shift, if it lasts 	Something to watch.	https://t.co/s7SguvkpKh
One thing that I am sure about: it's been a really rough three days for us with 18 to 29 year old respondents. Not sure if that's a reflection of varying voter file quality or something else. Young people were relatively easy last week
We're at R+3 in VA-7, Brat 47 to Spanberger 44. 	Not sure whether we'll keep working the sample through an extra round of callbacks. The low response on 18-29 year olds could justify it. 	OTOH, could move on: Breadth counts in the House.	https://t.co/L4en36JBbm

@Redistrict well you did better than my personal guess, which may or may not be incredible depending on your point of view
@ForecasterEnten @Redistrict cheater
I was pretty taken aback by his TX23 guess. But here we are.
Here's something pretty incredible. 	I asked @Redistrict for his expected results in these districts *before* we went into the field. 	On average, 0 difference between D/R, average absolute difference of just 3 pts on *margin* 	If you exclude WV3, which is weird, tilt a little D https://t.co/RS0K4vQTuH

And now we're rolling in Wisconsin 1, too https://t.co/aXtClCnYph
@jon_m_rob i can't ever imagine trying such a thing with all of this data that's just piling up
It's not that simple. 	We weight by things like party registration and race, for instance.	Suppose these 18-34 year olds are all white, no col gop primary voters.	If true, the non white, college educated, D from 35+ are being *upweighted* to compensate 	https://t.co/9uChkJZ99f
It's like 20 people, folks. You've seen the crazy numbers you get on the overall result at n=20, right? That applies to the crosstabs for small groups as well. That's what you get w/random sampling  https://t.co/UJGfywDsGS
But this is the sort of thing that happens in polling and will happen again. It's part of why you should think of polls as fairly fuzzy. If you had kept interviewing, you could easily get a different result.
Hasn't really been an issue so far. Overall, including VA07, young voters are 12% of the sample v. 13% of the likely electorate; mean weight 1.08	Could easily work itself out with more interviews? Or maybe we'll be stuck upweighting a small and fairly unrepresentative group
One interesting thing to watch over the final 250 interviews of VA7 = young voters. 	We haven't gotten many so far. Just 25. So we're weighting them up quite a bit (mean weight for 18-34 = 1.5)	The catch: they support Brat 64-28 so far (that's 16 to 7 in people)
We're back in the field in VA7 and TX23. WI01 to start later https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
8) You don't have as many respondents as your 'goal', wtf?	When we fall short of our goals--and we will--we weight our sample to match our targets. So groups always make up their needed share of our estimate	You can see the weighted electorate in the crosstabs.
7) Something something something about the crosstabs	One key lesson from this project, I would think, is that small sample sizes are really unreliable.	That applies to like, almost all of our crosstabs. It's a mistake to read much into them
6) Is this the same as a typical Siena poll? 	I'd say it's fundamentally similar: both are listed samples, weighted to a likely electorate.	But for what it's worth, our weights and likely voter models are somewhat different
5) Isn't a sample size of 500 small?	Well, it's smaller than a typical national poll. But normal for House	Why? It's more important to get a broad sweep of districts than to nail down specific contests in the House	So, yes, they're noisy. You can see that for yourself, live
4) Are you sampling new voters, or just prior voters like those from 2014?	Yes, we sample lots of new voters in proportion to their expected share of electorate	Overall, about 1/3 of our respondents didn't vote in '14
3) Do we text people first?	No, unfortunately texting w/o consent is barred by federal regulations	If it was legal... just imagine what your text messages would be like btw
2) How do you know you're not getting trolled?	We ask for a specific person, and we don't complete the interview with anyone else.	We ask for age, too. It's an exact match between self-report and voter file age for &gt;95% of respondents, and we shouldn't expect either to be perfect
1) Do you call cell phones?	Yes, we do. About 2/3 of our calls are to cell phones.

@TylerDinucci Shouldn‚Äôt have that effect. Backward possible later due to weighting, but not yet...	Lmk if it happens again
@TylerDinucci Not at comp; how many respondents?
All of which is to say: I think it's going to be hard to draw a clear inference about the statewide contest from CD23. I'm just not sure what I'd expect in a hypothetical tied race here. I can imagine how Cruz could hold up relatively well. But I wouldn't assume it either
For good measure, TX23 has a really poor Democratic turnout and low pct college grad. I think it's easy to imagine the Dem surge landing in a lot of places and totally missing here.
What about Beto? My initial thought was that this would be a good district for him, since he's from El Paso.	But then I remembered that he kind of struggled here in the primary https://t.co/fjEadhXawD
In 2012, Cruz did well in TX23, and quite a bit better than Romney. He won TX23 by 7 points (Romney won by 3), even though he fared about the same statewide. Maybe helped a bit by being Hispanic himself? Not sure, maybe someone can chime in.	Either way, maybe a different baseline
While we wait on more interviews from TX23--and there's a lot more to calls going there tonight than you'd guess by the slow start--I'm going to speculate a little bit about what to expect on the Cruz v. Beto number.	A little torn here.
@DanSHopkins besides sample size, the margin of error is also affected by the survey's design effect, which is basically a penalty for the amount we had to weight
We do. At one point today there was a question about whether we would do TX23 today because it wasn't clear whether the questionnaire had been translated to Spanish  https://t.co/6JPC2dxSpy
@Jim_Brunner did you have to ask
@Redistrict you didn't even want a tx23 poll
@dcastillo82 it's 16 people
We're in the field in TX23, and back in VA07 and WV03	https://t.co/In7dbtEnQ9
Got curious, so some bonus tabs on this:	Gender: M 49/46; F: 34/59	Race/Edu: White col 35/60; White no col 52/44, Nonwhite 28/63	Age: 1829 34/62; 3044 36/59; 4564 45/49; 65+ 42/53	Again, keep in mind that these mostly suburban/rural/lean R CDs aren't representative of US
Trump approval is at 41-53 in our first six completed polls, or about 3000 interviews. 	The districts voted for Trump by 5 points, with 49% of the vote. So his approval rating here is about 8 points behind his 2016 vote share, which one could roughly extrapolate to 38% nationally
@kwcollins @SolomonMg @ylelkes @seanjwestwood i think the potential exists. we're prepared to raise additional barriers if we think its an issue. but i think we've done a fair amount to prevent it, people understand it intuitively, and i don't see much evidence that it's happening
@kwcollins i think *jitter* on the needle had a similar objective, and i think we're not sure whether it worked.	what we're pretty convinced of is that +/- 5 or 85% is not effective, and we were convinced of that before 11/8/16
So, honestly, I'm ok if people get a little freaked out if they see Ojeda down or whatever and he comes back. I think experiencing that is the point of the project. 	But I don't see people being *misled.* They get that it's not done. They're being warned. They see it change.
In my view, the public doesn't really get polling. They see these numbers. They see an MoE and tbh they have no idea what it means. 	I think you have to really experience it to see what it is, why it's wrong, and, frankly, how amazing it is that they work pretty well in the end
Experiencing this really changed my perspective on polls.	They went from 'data' to being inexact, fuzzy things that might have changed if we had done 25 more interviews, or if we had rounded by margin instead of topline, or done 1000 more interviews or done a whole new sample!
That data isn't weighted. And I know my sample-size to MoE conversion formula.	But when I saw Clinton 58, Trump 38 at N=75 or whatever in FL. I was a little freaked out. In the end... Clinton+1, 41-40.	I *know* the MoE. I *know* I shouldn't care. But it was hard not to
I had never really been part of actually producing a poll until we started doing our 2016 polls with Siena. As part of it, they let me see their internal interface which tracks completes at any given time
Let me tell you a story 	https://t.co/wFzyeKHuKO
If it gets to the point where people are being mislead, we already have our easy mechanism to deal with it in place: increase the threshold on our 'don't take this poll seriously' warning. But it's just not happening
More generally, the point of letting you see the uncertainty at N &lt; 500 is to help people understand the uncertainty that remains at N=500.	Just because a poll is done doesn't mean sampling error went away.
The problem with this argument: no one is being misled. 	In all seriousness, look around? I see startlingly few tweets based on pre-mature analysis of the data. Maybe none. People get it.	And they're learning a lot, which is the major goal of the project 	https://t.co/Hj9lm1YMCO

@JasonMMcGrath partisan primary vote
@jptres92 it is if you weight on party registration or partisan primary vote history or a model of partisanship based on fixed variables on the file
Dem response rates have been high in the states where we do have such data. We can't correct as much for it in MN, if it's true there (as it seems to be, based on weaker data). Still, hard to think it would put Paulson in the lead or something.
One interesting thing is that, in general, I think our polls have basically gone as expected, except in MN where Dems are running strong. 	However, Minnesota is one of the few states where we don't have a good indicator of partisanship for weighting.
MN-08, final: Radinovich 44, Stauber 43	All five of our first polls finish within 1 point, though I don't think that will survive our next finish in MN-03	This is a Dem-held open seat, but I think the GOP might have hoped to start with a lead here 	https://t.co/uBVM0pkF9g

I misread this from the start. We're just trimming the weights still (note that it says 'only beginning to weight,' not 'we're not weighting'). Max weight = 2% of sample, so weighting gradually phases in between 50 150
@sayhar @zammy671 say they'll vote for ojeda
One thing you may not have noticed is that we warn you when we're not weighting the poll yet. Usually, we start gradually at n=50, but we wait until we have someone from all categories. We don't have one yet. Depending on when it happens, there could be jump in the numbers https://t.co/yBvv8QWEOm

@JeffreyASachs @nytimes I think we're unprecedentedly responsive to this criticism of the traditional 'margin of error,' which is a deeply flawed statistic but the industry standard.

KY-06, final: Barr 47, McGrath 46. 	All four of our first polls finish within 1 point. 	And three of the four are 'even' if you round by exact vote share, not each candidate. (ie: 47.6 to 47.4 = rounded to 47 to 46 = +1, not tie)	I guess the toss-ups are toss-ups. https://t.co/NukoUi5Nmf

@Ricksta6 yup, trump's approval there was 36/57 in our poll!
@abaumania i'm already well on my way to being excommunicated from the polling church
FWIW, those Siena/Optimum polls of NY19/22/24/25 should confirm that it's not always a tie!	(those polls differed on weighting/LV screen from ours, but the rest of the procedure was identical and the results w our weights/LV = not materially different) 	https://t.co/cT03qIHRI8
And by the way, seeing how many of our polls so far (going back to 2016) have been moved by the 'margin of rounding' has led me to feel a little differently about whether we ought to use decimal points or not.
At the moment, KY6 is poised to become our second poll that's even, but where the GOP leads by the margin of rounding (IL6 is the other)	IE: 47.7 Barr rounds to 48, 47.45 McGrath rounds to 47 = Barr+1
One interesting thing buried in the MN08 data: Radinovich seems pretty well known and well-liked in the Iron Range (where he represented), and he has a big lead there   	Will be interesting to see if this holds in the end. Still a long way to go https://t.co/o383hNXJuf

@NateSilver538 yeah, our MoE/design effect on the RV figure = very large. it's the proper way to calculate it and it will pay off in the aggregate but it may make sense to trim the weights on the individual poll page
Yeah, so far we have undecided voters tilting GOP on a number of metrics (compared to likely electorate). But this is also going to be fun in 10 days with more data. Right now, 216 undecided voters in total = not that much	https://t.co/n4WMM0nncL
Anyway, it's going to be very interesting to look at this in another 5 or 10 days. Hopefully we'll be able to say some very cool stuff at that point
Taking all of our polls together, Dems running 2 pts better on LV than RV. 	In terms of approval, though, Trump approval is 2 pts better with LV than RV. 	Maybe noise? (at n=1744, it's big but not so big that i'd rule out weirdness, esp since our RV design effect is huge)

@ForecasterEnten @xenocryptsite tbh, the results line up with what @Redistrict tells me they're going to be in emails before we do them. it's pretty remarkable
@xenocryptsite also--exclusive twitter coverage--we did a brief n=250 whatever "live" test in PA17 in early Aug and had lamb up 12 or something
@xenocryptsite i'm just saying, i believe these races are close and i believe NY24 is not close lol
@xenocryptsite fwiw we shadow polled the Siena NY25/NY19/NY21/NY24 polls from Aug. to test out "live." No material differences between our results, despite different weighting/LV (interview proedure/sample selection identical). Pt out bc of the double digit Katko lead / 20+ pt Dem in NY25
Final in IL-06 and IL-12: both GOP incumbents lead by 1 in two toss-up districts.	https://t.co/lGvjm9ctRT https://t.co/uu4flcBAvB
I think this was a pretty terrible poll for Roskam (R) in IL06, tbh.	He's up 1, but...	Fav rating is underwater, 36/38	Trump approval minus-21, 	D+7 gb	He has district's GOP lean: R+3 party ID, R+7 by primary vote hist	Is that really going to hold?	https://t.co/NFaDtkuki1
And, similarly, this poll didn't go from being "good" or "bad" to right or wrong over the last 15 interviews or whatever, depending on which side ultimately won this thing
(this is IL-6 btw)
At the moment, we have Roskam+1, 45-44 w/ rounded figures.	When I left work, it was Casten+1 by rounded figures	a) It was even the whole time. 	b) If this were the final poll, imagine how differently you'd react to...just a few interviews and rounding https://t.co/9uKTH7hL3M
@PollsterPatrick we're weighting by 18-34, and we have 7 of them. also max weight = 2% of sample, so no one is &gt;3 or so right now

One of the reasons we chose to do this is because me/some of my colleagues feel like we know sampling error well. But it's totally different to experience it, as we did looking at the internal interface in prior projects.
One of the big lessons here, we think, is about sampling error and the level of precision you expect about surprising polls and crosstabs. 	As we call more and more people, we think we're inching towards the truth. 	These are N=500 polls. What if we had done 1000? https://t.co/CaoscuQsTQ

I'm doing the part of this (drawing sample, weighting a poll, modeling electorate etc) that's been done thousands of times.	The extraordinary thing is doing it live. Nothing we're working with is set-up to do it
Over the next few months, we will have a long time to talk about polling, methodology, and the lessons we hope you take from this. 	But right now, I want to acknowledged the dozens of people at the Times, Siena and participating call centers who have worked to make this happen
@AshleyKirzinger the poll is weighted exactly as we would weight a completed survey. max weight = 2% of the sample, so it gradually begins at N=50

@AllanBoone5 @cwgNAS ...what do you mean by 'than they are actually in?'
@ForecasterEnten too tired to have any advice
@cwgNAS what does that even mean?
Obviously, the 3 GOP-held districts are more important. OTOH, my prior in any given district is pretty weak at this stage of a race. Challengers not well yet known, etc.
Taken together, I think these NY Siena polls are basically in-line with expectations. If you had made me guess each poll, I would have guessed about 2 points better for the Dems in the 3 GOP-held districts. Would have guessed notably better for GOP in NY25.

On balance, I'd say this tidbit is good news for the GOP, at least compared to the facially catastrophic early results. Let's see where we land when all the votes are counted.
This kind of cuts both ways. Obviously, Dems like having a turnout edge. But historically this kind of Democratic turnout advantage typically isn't sustainable at higher turnout levels. Late ballots likelier to tilt GOP, too.
Democrats enjoyed a turnout in WA-3/5/8 returns received by 8/6, per L2 data.	Overall, 50.1% of returned ballots from voters who cast ballots in '16 pres preference were Dem '16 primary vts, v. 47.6% among all reg. 	Dem edge was greatest in WA3 (53 v. 49.4) and WA5 (47.4, 44.3)

I'm not there yet on WA-5. The idea of that CD, with an incumbent, as a toss-up is just too far for me. But I'll concede that there's evidence to support the characterization https://t.co/AM55OsMUIV
If WA3, CA48, and CA49 flipped, the entire lower-48 Pacific Coast from border to border would be held by the Democrats
@AliLapp oh cool, from where??
Dems narrowly won the primary ballot count in MI8 and MI11, two toss-up CDs where GOP usually has a big edge in the primary vote count. Very robust turnout, too
I think I'm going to wait to see some final numbers and maybe even get the partisan composition of early returns before I write something up here. But yeah, +1 on the Enten assessment here. At first glance, looks chillingly bleak for GOP and it's not any better downballot
I'm from WA8 and I thought the GOP would have the edge there too  https://t.co/ZnId8zPknk
Will elaborate later (on train), but these early numbers in WA do not look good for the GOP. True generally but WA3...
The polls are closed in Washington, where we‚Äôll get another nice preview of the national environment thanks to the state‚Äôs top two primary system
Yup. Every election we get is going to help  https://t.co/2Qj6fysJ63
As an aside, Franklin County currently at a wild 35.7% of the electorate, up from 31% of registered voters. A VA/PA18 style Dem turnout surge might have put Franklin around 34%.
And, I should note of course that this fantastic needle art does not constitute a projection, which should never be made in a race of &lt;1 pt or so without an exct account of how many ballots are left. Needle fans will know that "on track for victory" = &gt;95%, but not a call.
Balderson up by nearly a point with 6 precincts left https://t.co/kCwGB9KKNR
A few have asked about provisional ballots. Again, didn't do the research here bc no needle, but Ohio actually is a state where they can have some pretty meaningful provisional voting. So I wouldn't totally rule that out yet. But Delaware could be R enough for it not to matter.
O'Connor barely retakes the lead, probably for the last time. Franklin County now has just one precinct left. Delaware has 54, and it's been Balderson+15 or so on Election Day so far
Balderson takes his first lead of the night. Still plenty of vote left in Delaware County, which leans GOP
Unfortunately, I didn't take the time to join up the precinct results w/some prior elections or other estimates (sort of thing we do for needle-ing). So I'm inferring what's left based on early vote results instead.
Non-Delaware/Franklin counties now done. O'Connor up by just 155 votes, with a larger number of Delaware County (GOP) left to count than Franklin (Dem). O'Connor needs to do better in what's left of Delaware than he has so far, but what's left was a bit more R in the early vote.
So close, but here's the simplest way to explain it right now. Delaware is 50% in, Rs are +2500 on eday there. D+1400 overall, so if Rs doubles up in Delaware they'd just slightly pull ahead. Obviously, Ds could do better in Del. Or kill it in Franklin. Still soooo close
O'Connor did quite a bit better in the latest batch of election day votes from Delaware, so he didn't lose any ground. Seems to me, though, that what's left in Delaware is now somewhat worse for O'Connor than what's in, based on the early vote tallies
On the other hand, there's also still stuff in Licking County and elsewhere in the CD that might be better for Balderson. So that would tend to cement his edge here.
My back of the envelope calculation using the precinct data in Franklin/Delaware is that Balderson is on track to net 3000 votes out of those two counties, which would be enough to give him a *very small* lead. And still early in Delaware
And to be clear, this remains a real toss-up. Just my 'if i had to choose now' instinct. At risk of stating the obvious, in the end Delaware will either come in good enough for one side or the other
Delaware is really the big question. Historically, this is a very GOP county. The early vote was also really strong for O'Connor. One possibility, a ton of GOP left. The other: O'Connor will outperform in a well-educated area. Just can't say yet.
Hard for me to properly sort this out without the help of a preprogrammed model to do it for me, but right now I'd rather be Balderson. Still hard to say, given the huge eday-early gap, big turnout questions and the absence of data from Del. Co
At the moment, Franklin County completed precinct vote is 81% election day, 19% early.  If it held, it would put us on track for a turnout of just 58k, which isn't as high as it looked early on. At same time, O'Connor now at 62% of the election day vote in Franklin--also weaker.
Turnout generally looking lighter than it did in the first few precincts. Based strictly on what we have, might not put us on track for 200k anymore. Delaware County looking like the big question-mark, with everyone near targets in rest of CD.
Starting to get a little more out of Franklin. Turnout gradually looking a hair weaker, but O'Connor hitting his vote share targets. Over all, looks like we're heading for a tight race. Relative urban v. rural turnout a big unanswered question
Tough to get a hold on the Election Day vote so far. Balderson up 10 so far, but it's disproportionately rural and we can't disaggregate the election day - absentee vote in any of those counties until they're done. We can in Franklin/Delaware, but little from those jurisdictions
The first 6 precincts in Franklin County, Ohio are consistent with a districtwide turnout of approximately 220k, early vote would be 16% of final vote
@DaNumbersGuy i don't see any early vote results by precinct, though
Unfortunately, it seems that we don't have precinct-level data on the early vote, just the combined vote. That will make harder to untangle the two.
The big picture: the early vote is as expected. 	Why was it expected? Because we knew the geographic/partisan composition of the early vote and it was highly unrepresentative.	Now we need some Election Day data. How big is the turnout and how good is it for Balderson?
Early vote goes to O'Connor by 26.5 points. No surprise here (was expecting something near 30, see below from Sunday) https://t.co/82fIHZ9v0W
After careful analysis of the early vote, the needle is not budging https://t.co/epUu5Vbs10
O'Connor wins the Franklin County early vote, 80 to 19 percent. Again: this is not a surprise, can't read much into it
The polls are closed in OH-12.	Warnings: the early vote is going be really good for O'Connor. Don't read much into it. We know this is a highly unrepresentative vote, and there really isn't any result--no matter how good for O'Connor--that you can read into

And most importantly: don't forget the WA top-two primary! Like Calif., it's a pretty good indicator of the general election if slightly GOP tilting (and it'll take forever to count). It'll be interesting to see how close the partisan vote is in WA08/05/03 .
--Don't even think about the OH12 early vote tonight. It's going to be wild for O'Connor, and it's not remotely representative 	--A benchmark: if this is like prior specials, turnout would be appx 220k and Franklin Co. will be appx 34% of the electorate. Will be fun to compare

The early vote is small enough and the total turnout uncertain enough that I would say there is no number, not even D+50, that would persuade me that O'Connor had won, given the unrepresentativeness of the party/geographic composition of the early vote https://t.co/uL3KrhDwBj
Turnout is always 'key,' but it may be particularly important in OH-12:	--I am not aware of a poll that shows O'Connor in the lead in OH-12.	--But I am aware of three polls that show O'Connor leading among those who have already voted or say they definitely will vote
Warning (which I will repeat on Tuesday): O'Connor could win the early vote in OH-12 by like 30 points. Don't overreact

@PatrickRuffini selection bias makes that a tough issue. maybe no one polls ca21, which looks you'd model as a decent dem shot, but there's a reason why no one's polling it! you can account for that w ratings, but that gets back to your initial problem
@markles the faint, flat lines w/63/31/21 on the y-axis that say 'gop gain in 2010' etc
@markles those are the lines!
This got cut from the article, but tbh: I'm not sure we're ever really going to have a very confident view. It's not like a Senate/Pres race, with a robust polling avg in key states, even if the avg can be wrong. This time, we won't even know that much
But we do live in a more polarized era, and the president could be pretty good at polarizing things. So I'd be pretty open minded about where the race will head from here, esp since there are so few House polls, there's so long to go, and House polls are often meh
Strictly from a forecasting stand-point, individual House polls are generally a much better indicator of the map than the fundamentals-based analysis. You can be really really wrong if you stick w/the funds-focused approach. '06, in particular, would be embarrassingly bad
The GOP stands to gain the most from returning to a more polarized electorate, which would narrow the battleground and confine Dem strength to urban areas. This could prevent a blowout, but alone wouldn't make them favored and could hurt in Clinton CDs where look kinda ok
It's also a pretty interesting reversal of recent electoral trends, where we've had a growing relationship between congressional and presidential voting. Maybe that will return over the final few months, but for now the national trend towards greater polarization isn't showing up
It's a fun reversal of the analytical issue of '06, when the national polls/a simple model would say Dem landslide, but the districts didn't seem to be there. In the end, Dems found the seats but with many GOP survivors and strange, unpredictable Dem gains (sometimes bc scandal)
It's also opened up a bit of a gap between the tight race implied by generic ballot polls / fairly simple models based on recent district voting, and the clearer Dem edge implied by individual district polls, special election results and ratings

@PatrickRuffini i drove to the iowa-missouri border for this reason a couple of years ago. hit a deer on the way. there are some salient demographic/cultural differences fwiw https://t.co/PSZEeETj1d
But despite all of that, I have to wave a red flag on polls that don't weight for education and show a striking Dem lead in Wisconsin (or other white Midwestern states). 	It could be right! It could be sampling error! But there's a serious, plausible mechanism for bias too
And many pollsters will take steps to address some of the issues that were most obviously problematic in 2016, like education
And remember, even in '16, the state-level polling error wasn't *that* big outside of predominantly white, working class states. Maybe NC is an exception, but on average it was pretty concentrated in the Midwest
The midterm electorate is better educated. The closest districts aren't disproportionately working class. Dem LV disadvantage may not be as big as '14 . or '16, which is tough to detect in generally high-turnout poll samples. Undecided voters don't seem so likely to break big GOP
In general, there are a lot of good reasons to think that the factors that (we think) drove '16 polling error won't be quite as acute in '18

@RachelBitecofer @SeanTrende idk that it doesn't tbh? in our VA poll, if we get the electorate right (which we did not, but can reweight w/benefit of post-election file) and weight to a CPS 14 based estimate for education we do fine in '17
@SeanTrende @RachelBitecofer i mean, you'll definitely have helped things. it's not like the polls aren't showing a big white x college gap. but it is possible it's insufficient.
@SeanTrende @RachelBitecofer yeah, white x education is what really matters
@RachelBitecofer @SeanTrende This is basically new https://t.co/9aC88w0ZLE
@RachelBitecofer @SeanTrende I mean, basically all national RDD telephone polls weight by education to census targets. Marist is the only exception afaik, though they still had Clinton+1. National polls were pretty dependent on this decision https://t.co/X6V1aYQ8ZL
@SeanTrende also i ran over a deer in iowa once and tbh it's been all downhill since
@SeanTrende i'd get over it if they weighted by education
That doesn't mean the polls are wrong, to be clear. But I expected some reflexive skepticism towards great Dem numbers in the Midwest, whether said skepticism is merited or not
It is interesting to me that everyone is apparently content to trumpet favorable Democratic numbers in the states where the polls overestimated Clinton by the most, and in a poll that hasn't made any post-'16 adjustments on education or anything else, to my knowledge

It's an interesting methodological challenge, too. We're polling off the voter file, but these states have very different files and the productivity by state/district will probably vary a lot. So I'm definitely curious about what this is going to look like at the end
We'll see how it goes. It really is a test, both of this specific idea and for our polling more generally. The upside: between focusing on an evenly distributed set of districts + polling a named ballot, it ought be a pretty decent, at-a-glance measure of the race.
It's kind of different than what we've done before. 60 CDs. 53 GOP-7 Dem. The logic is that whoever wins half would be favored to win the House, since Dems need 23 + hold their 7 seats.

There don't appear to be any ballots left to count in California. 	Semi-final turnout: 7.14 million votes cast, or 37.5% of registered voters.	That's a 60% increase from 2014, when turnout was 4.46 million.	It nearly matches the 7.5 million votes cast in the 2014 general election

Self-reported likely voter screen was pretty heavily biased towards Clinton in '16, at least in our data. So, so far, it's not helping. 	https://t.co/4WKzbkQBZl
Should note that the validated vote figures are quite consistent with the theory that Dems could have a better turnout among LV than RV in '18

@WTPDavid it's major party vote share, which it explains the ca45 stuff elegantly. it explains part of ca48 but that's not the tally i had for it after the election (ap data fwiw)
(These are changes since Wed. 6/6 at 9am pacific)
Still more than 2 million ballots left in Calif., per state estimates. Changes so far in the 1-county districts (easiest to track):	CA-45, GOP vote share down to 53.8% from 54.5%	CA-48, GOP vote share basically unchanged, up to 53.7% from 53.6

@PatrickRuffini i mean, in the end we'll be able to see the party turnout rates and see whether they look like the specials (~even or even d edge, controlling for race) or the mail ballots on political data (clear gop edge)
@PatrickRuffini yes, from a lower turnout special electorate (and similarly i'd guess 18 turnout will be worse for gop in the middle turnout special like pa18/az8) . but maybe not from a primary electorate
@PatrickRuffini (which i do fwiw)
@PatrickRuffini what if you believe '18 turnout is going to smash 2014, ala ga6/vagov?
@annedeuceofcups Now add 2.6m votes
For some context, puts on track for 6.8 million votes. 7.3m votes in 14 general election for governor
The numbers are out: at least 2.6 million ballots left to count in California. Huge turnout  https://t.co/WR7FVhGAwD
Wouldn't be hard to conduct the analysis though, if anyone is looking for a free piece idea
My instinct, based on no real analysis, is that the generic ballot would have higher undecideds and perhaps be better for the GOP at this early stage. 	OTOH, maybe the 'control' question is a better indicator of the national environment.
And no, I don't have an incisive and definitive conclusion from it. I'll just say that, in general, the latter formulation is what I think of when I refer to a 'generic ballot' question. But to my knowledge, all models/historic datasets include both without distinction
One subtle thing CBS, NBC/WSJ and Quinnipiac all have in common, besides being RDD live interview pollsters, is that they asked 'which party would you like to control congress,' not 'will you vote for the republican or democratic candidate for congress' (like yougov/mc/ipso)
Somehow, I'm surprised every year by how many votes are left in California. Appx. 1/3 left in Orange and San Diego Counties, per county estimates.
IMO, the results are consistent with shifting CA-21 to the 'likely Republican' column. But otherwise, everything was as expected.
California take-away: the race is going as expected, with the noted and discussed exception of CA-21 https://t.co/fazs4ar1SC
@ForecasterEnten yeah i mean i can imagine exceptions to that (like a narrow pop vote win but a big pop vote shift would still count for me, potentially, and esp if it led to a shift in control)
@dgalvin29 the line is y=x
@jpodhoretz @ForecasterEnten i guess we disagree on the definition of a wave, then
I'm getting reluctant to use the word 'wave.' I feel like a lot of readers now associate it with these wild special election results, 15 pt dem swings, etc. rather than how I mean it--an election like 94/06/10.
Actually, that's not true. It's not baffling at all. It's because it was a very good result for the Democrats.
The attention that race got last night while like 3+ million votes were being counted in federal races in CA is baffling to me
One thing I *won't* be writing about is the result of an extremely low turnout special legislative election in, of all states right now, Missouri
I'm getting into writing about the results last night. If you want to guess what I'm going to say, you can just read what I wrote yesterday https://t.co/QIrHek1iFA https://t.co/aSxCqGDbAj
Rouda moves into second in CA-48. I'd guess the late mail ballots will pad his tenuous edge https://t.co/JofDkry4m6
In the end, Democrats look like they'll avoid the GOP close out everywhere in California. Not a huge surprise, but the risk was real and there were some close calls
Baugh now well in fourth place in the CA-48 count https://t.co/LiHXjBWAgi
The upshot: we'll see what the LA/SB part of CA-39 looks like, but the big question-mark looks like CA-48. Dems hold a second-place slot heading into Election Day, but it's very close and the late dynamics there might not help the Dems consolidate their edge
And while the OC is just a hair of CA39, Dems probably feeling ok about this to start with. A mess on the non-Young Kim part of the GOP https://t.co/xpQY2WQQCy
Dems look totally fine in CA-49, based on the OC (more GOP) part of the district. Total Chavez collapse https://t.co/UTQM5rOS1Y
Not quite the early vote that Democrats were hoping for in CA-48. A Dem is in second, yes, but barely and not the DCCC preferred candidate. What if late ballots break the other way? https://t.co/TA4wnAj0wj
My main disclaimer: CA-39 absentee vote looked pretty good for GOP. 48/49 looked great for Dems. 	So if things look meh for Dems in 48/49, I wouldn't count on election day/late mail to bail them out. But Dems can realistically hope for more gains in CA-39 as the count goes on
Alright, the polls about about to close in California. I'm about to open a new bottle of wine. And I think we should get a pretty decent picture of what's going on in California pretty quickly with the early absentee numbers
MT-AL seems like a particularly strong data point for the narrative. Williams was a distant third in fundraising (probably have to disclose long-time friendship w/Williams campaign manager @andrewmarkoff )
More strength for female candidates in some of the more interesting Dem contests of the night. Cindy Axne claiming an unexpectedly large (to me, at least) 57% of the vote in IA-3 so far. MT-AL close, with Kathleen Williams seeming to have the edge in the early vote
No AP call in NJ-2 (R-Open) yet, but Jeff Van Drew (D) v. Seth Grossman (R) looks pretty close to a done deal. Van Drew starts as a big favorite in a district carried by Trump.
NJ-11 (Open, r-held) is set: Mickie Sherrill (D) v. Jay Webber (R). Toss-up by most accounts, but Sherrill starts with the edge
And, I'll concede to a few of my replies that the NM-1 Dem primary is somewhat interesting. I'm just not so interested bc it isn't a competitive general election
The GOP, OTOH, has had several interesting elections but they've basically gone as expected. AL-2 (Roby-inc) looks like it will go to a run-off, as expected. Herrell looks favored early on in NM-2, as does Weber in NJ-11, which aren't surprising either.
The first half of tonight has been exactly as boring as expected on the Democratic side, but now we're coming up on the first somewhat interesting Dem elections of the night: the MT-AL and IA-3 Dem primaries, where polls close in 4 minutes.

@kkondik well, persuasion matters a lot. but unlike az8, gop voters have returned ballots at a much higher rate than dems. turnout will be a burden in the early vote at least, even if it can be overcome by persuasion
@kkondik yeah, it was a pretty standard turnout. but if there are polls showing a close race based on a normal turnout and then you have a normal turnout then you probably shouldn't be moving your view of the race!
@kkondik there was nothing about the early voting that was unfavorable to dems there
@kkondik well, to be clear, the early voting democrats did not suggest trouble. people suggested the early voting suggested trouble.
@k_hahn97 yeah i guess so. will fix
@paulmitche11 an invaluable resource, as always!
@Wertwhile @Political_Data no way. i'm guessing that if i can lock out the GOP in ca49 that i'm going to roll in the general election there, anyway
RT @paulmitche11: @Nate_Cohn Posting the ballot return rate, make sure to let people know where you got that! 		See the ballots coming in w‚Ä¶
Just 21% of Dems have returned in CA39, per @Political_Data, v. 30% and 39% in 48/49. It's much more like the 22% statewide. 	GOP, OTOH, at 27% return in CA39 v. 28% and 34% in 48/49 and 28% statewide.
The Dem ballot return rate in CA39, probably their biggest close out risk, has been fairly weak and looks much more like the statewide turnout than 48/49. Wouldn't surprise me if the earliest ballots there look pretty decent for the Republicans
The biggest story still is probably the Dem close-out risk in CA39/48/49, probably in that order. My guess is Dems dodge the bullet on this, but maybe not without some drama first.
Happy Election Day! Pretty big night tonight, certainly as far as primaries go.

Looks about right  https://t.co/TqhOx5YENO
Similarly, I feel like people have some weird expectations for individual House races. In general, incumbents of the president's party are still favored in districts that tilt even a little bit towards their party (by, say, PVI) in 94/06/10 waves
But in general, there's no reason to look at... hypothetically... a D+26 gain and say 'oh my the Dems are having a terrible election"
Now the '18 wave could be different in ways that undermine that analysis. Incumbency could be much less valuable, for instance. So in certain cases, a close national House race could be possible without a great D national environment.
Since '14 or so, I've written like 100x that a '10/06 type wave wouldn't clearly get the Dems the House. That's less true now, bc GOP retirements, but you'd still only expect the Dems to have a small majority in a 06/10 type wave
Folks, a close race for the House = a Dem wave, given the GOP's structural advantage in the chamber.
@PatrickRuffini texas too
Maybe that's what happens when you get told your district is the number one Dem pick-up target for appx. 1 year
Some actual data there. The white Dem CA49 turnout, in particular, is just on a different planet https://t.co/5kF0ZApwXg
@richardmskinner holds among white voters, too https://t.co/4HGUijNgyr
And Dem turnout isn't lit af in 39 like it is in 48/49 https://t.co/revmVbVAkv
You'll recall, of course, that GA-6 is a place where the GOP traditionally has a huge party primary advantage. Overall, 14% of past GOP primary voters voted in the Dem primary this time, while the breakdown among those without prior primary primary vote history was 70-30 D.
And among those who voted in the GA-6 run-offf? D 48.1, R 51.9.
I meant D 48.6, R 51.4; I apologize
GA vote history is updated, for anyone who has a recent GA state file laying around. I only have GA-6 post-16, and the turnout there among those registered last June will be quite familiar: D 48.3, R 51.7
@HotlineJosh @amyewalter in our estimates, which are like &gt;80% last pres election, tx07 comes out as r+5 (with a large MoE) in a d+7 environment, accounting for recruiting/fundraising/last congressional results, etc.
@HotlineJosh @amyewalter and fwiw, if you give even a *little* weight to '12/party reg in your view of the cd's partisanship, than you would not expect this to be a dem tilting CD, even in a wave.
@HotlineJosh @amyewalter no doubt. but i guess for me that just means i'm going to shrug my shoulders rather than get out a magnifying glass and try to extrapolate
@HotlineJosh @amyewalter and in general, individual house races are noisy! going from 1 result to overall control = a total mess, particularly in a district like this
@HotlineJosh @amyewalter it seems to me that these districts with a huge romney-&gt;clinton/obama-&gt;trump swing are very hard to interpret. possible to imagine that this is a great or meh poll for dems, depending on your assumptions about the overall battleground

Dem turnout might just bail the party out in CA49/48. 	Dem turnout edge in CA49, in particular, is a little ridiculous. Risk that Dems lock the GOP out there is pbly underrated (though to be clear, GOP could still close out).	CA39 looks more typical for this stage (GOP edge)

Democrats have a well-funded challenger in Dan McCready, who won w/82% or something tonight. I'd guess some or all of the ratings folks move this race a toss-up if Pittenger goes down.
Of those 14, only 9 are in populous Meckenberg County. The remaining 5 are in Robeson; Pittenger would be thrilled--thrilled--to even net-50 votes out of there.
At this point, it is fair to say that Robert Pittenger, incumbent Rep from NC-9, is on track for defeat. He's down by 810 votes with 14 precincts left. Barring tabulation errors, etc., the votes aren't there.
We're getting near the point where a Pittenger comeback is getting tough to imagine. Now with 37/50 in Mecklenberg, and still down by 878. Pittenger now might need a 30 or 40 pt lead over the remaining vote.
Pittenger, incumbent Republican, in huge trouble. Now at 33/50 in Mecklenberg. Harris lead just under 1000; Pittenger netted just 464 in the Mecklenberg eday vote over the first 2/3. Elsewhere, only a handful fo precincts left.
@_DarrenCohen so good
In more important news, James Paxton throws a no hitter!
It's going to be interesting in NC-9. Harris is up by 3.9, but his counties are basically all done. Half the precincts are left in Mecklenberg, NC (CLT, burbs), but Pittenger only netted-375 votes on the first half. Still down by 1100. Wouldn't cover the gap, but dk what's out.
I'm also not quite ready to write off a close finish in the OH-12 GOP primary. Balderson, the preferred estab candidate, has built a 3k vote lead. But it's basically tied outside of Muskegum County, Balderson's home/base, which is 80% counted.
It sure looks like Blankenship will fall short in WV-SEN. The highest drama right now might be NC-9, where Robert Pittenger, a vulnerable GOP rep, is trailing. He needs a big election day vote out of his base, the CLT burbs.
and to clear up another point of confusion: absentee voters are generally better educated than the overall electorate.
(to clear up confusion: the core thing i'm saying is that if blankenship really had a late surge, you wouldn't see much or any of it in the absentee vote)
The absentee vote in WV (currently heavily against Blankenship) is a nice window into what this election would look have looked like if it were held a few weeks ago and with a particularly well-educated/reliable electorate
i am not usually proud to say that i read 0 words about a race, but i'm pretty close on this one   https://t.co/a0JLtRDWkK
*Pittenger
Robert Pittinger, the already endangered GOP incumbent in NC-9, is *losing* by 6 points in the NC early vote. Pittinger's base (Mecklenberg) appears to be included.

A pre-12 incumbency bonus and weaker pvi-congressional vote relationship would also make it much easier to imagine Democratic holds in WV/IN/MO-SEN, etc.
In fact, in '06 Dems did just as well in GOP-held open seats as Dems have in specials in '18 (14 pts ahead of partisanship), but won the PV by 8 points and only flipped 31 seats. So there's potentially no contradiction at all
House elections before 2012 had a much larger incumbency bonus and a weaker relationship w/pres vote. If '17 is more like that, it would reconcile much of the apparent genballot v. special election gap
On the other hand, it happened 31 times in 06/08	And in a way, that's really the big question right now: is this an Obama-era election year, with a very strong relationship between congressional and presidential vote choice? Or is it more like a pre-Obama election?
Over the 1000+ special/general House elections in Dem-held seats in the Obama era, Republicans ran &gt;20 pts ahead of district partisanship in a Dem-held seat just 4 times.	Democrats have pulled it off 3 times in 7 shots in '17/18

@JohnDBain if or-2 has the potential to be a single digit contest (and i don't see how it does tbh) then i can just spend the next six months in the wallowas and not worry about this election year, bc it's over
At this point, I need to persuaded that these races *won't* mostly become single digit contests where the RNC races in w/a million bucks to try and save it at the end
In some of these races, the candidates aren't quite all there yet. In others, you can make an argument about minority turnout or something. But that doesn't hold in all of them (TX-2, FL-6, in particular), and, for me, the burden proof goes the other way at this point
There are a bunch of open districts that aren't considered top-tier races by most analysts--TX-2, TX-6, FL-6, OH-16, TX-21, FL-15--that, by the numbers, look plausibly competitive in a wave election. On paper, they're better Dem targets than, say, AZ-8/KS-4/PA-18
And with that, I'm going to bed
@thinkkaz which i can
New round of ballots aren't so good for Tipirnei. She's now just 6 points ahead of her early vote tallies. No reason to hold off on calling it now.
Or put differently, she's ahead by 10 points in the Election Day vote so far, but those are precincts that voted for Lesko by 3.5 points, somewhat less than her 5.8 point lead in the early vote.
Tipirneni running 13 points ahead of her early voting tallies in the 18 precincts where election day votes have been tabulated so far. Would be consistent with a 7 or 8 point edge or so, which would not be enough to prevail.
@stephenatap @ElectProject does that include absentee ballots turned in today?
There just aren't any excuses. The Republican wasn't Roy Moore. The Democrat wasn't Conor Lamb. The turnout wasn't low. The district doesn't have, say, a latent Democratic tradition. It oddly has the effect of making all the prior excuses seem less relevant, too.
It probably won't get covered this way, but this is arguably the worst special congressional election result yet for the GOP
@danielchaplik @kyrstensinema by double digits probably
(and fwiw this is why there's no needle tonight. It would just be saying 99 right now with no real ability to add knowledge to the world)
Regardless of the exact outcome though, this is just another terrible special election result for the Republicans. Zero excuse, given the permanent absentee list. 	And you're feeling great if you're, say, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Arizona
And, yes, the threshold for a 'call' is that high
Bu fwiw, I don't have an exact enough figure on the amount of outstanding vote to make that determination with 99.99% confidence myself
Debbie Lesko is the projected winner in AZ-8, according to the AP. That's basically just a mathematical call, on the assumption that the final 15-25% of votes can't break overwhelmingly enough to overcome a 5.8 pt deficit (which is right if you're sure on how much is left)
Anyway, you can see why idgaf about that GOP+21 registration edge in the early vote. It doesn't really tell you much if it's roughly in line with district registration tallies
Lesko (R) claims a mere 5.8 point lead in the early vote. That will probably be enough. Tipirneni would need a very big lead in late absentees/Election Day votes. There could be around 25k left or perhaps even less, and Tipirneni has a 9k vote deficit.   https://t.co/RejFzyb7vQ https://t.co/3D6dGRD7Bg
With so much vote by mail absentee, it'll be hard for the Election Day vote to overcome a big deficit, even if either side wins those voters by a wide margin.

Anyway, we'll find out tonight. We have a lovely precinct map. https://t.co/RejFzyb7vQ
The mere fact that it's a mail election, however, does cut against the possibility of a particularly strong Democratic performance in my view. Not bc of the party registration numbers, but because it's probably locking in a more 'normal' electorate
Do I think the Dems is going to win tonight? No, but the party registration figures in the early voting don't really have all that much to do with that view
It's a similar story elsewhere. GA-6 doesn't have party registration, but if it did it probably would have been like an R+20 electorate.	PA-18 does have party registration, and the turnout was basically equal between Dems and Reps, yet it swung like 20 pts or whatever to Dems
How? Persuasion. And probably that these voters are quite well educated, and that the independents are Dem-leaning compared to the overall pool of independents.
Take KS-4, for example. GOP had an R+28 advantage, compared to an R+23 edge among RVs. The median age was 62. 	Yet the Dem came within 7 points of winning.
But I do disagree with the take that just thinks the GOP is having a great turnout because of their R+21 turnout edge or whatever. In a high turnout election, there basically aren't any scenarios where Dems narrow that number. But they can still do well
The catch, though, is that the pace of voting has tapered off considerably, indicating that there probably isn't going to be some huge flood of young voters to... move the needle... vastly in the Democratic direction
As a result, the most recent ballots have somewhat trended towards the Democrats. Over the first two weeks, the median age of voters was 68 and the GOP had a 48.8-27.6 edge; over the last week, the Republican edge was 46.7 to 29; the median age was 59.
That's not too surprising given that older votes typically pour in first and that old voters heavily back the GOP here. Among voters on the permanent absentee list, the GOP has a 7 point registration edge among voters under 40, but a 22 point edge among voters over age 50.
So far, Republicans have a 48.5-27.8% advantage in AZ-8 returned ballots through Friday. That's a hair better for the GOP than their 44-26 percent advantage on the permanent absentee list.
As a result, Democrats are not going to benefit from the same lopsided turnout edge that they've enjoyed in the low turnout specials. They will also find it harder to match their more modest turnout edge from the higher turnout specials, as well.
The main reason this matters: a permanent absentee list cuts against big partisan turnout edge. It's probably not a coincidence that Dems have struggled in low turnout specials where a majority of the votes have been cast by mail, like in Florida and Washington State.
Ok maybe not 342. But this special is fairly unique in that most of the vote will be cast by mail. AZ has a large permanent absentee list; about two-thirds of registered voters, and a higher share of likely voters, simply get their ballots mailed to them.
Median age 59
PA-18 special vote history data is in. Some preliminary cuts:	The electorate was D+4 by party registration, 48 to 44, appx the same as RVs. 	Turnout was 52.3% among reg. Dems, 51.7% among Reps, 32% w/other.	18-29 year olds represented just 6% of the electorate
Happy special election day! 	Let's talk about about AZ-8 early voting and the effect of voting methods on differential partisan turnout rates in special elections so far. 	1/342

@RyanDEnos @realMABarreto @b_schaffner @GarySegura (i should note that those turnout rates were just deduced using the % of electorate and total votes; it's not the % of any given sample)
@RyanDEnos @realMABarreto @b_schaffner @GarySegura I think we can make some reasonable bounded assumptions. The exit poll is impossible. The CCES is highly improbable and goes against decades of research. Other estimates both make sense and are pretty close https://t.co/Pfont4xJjY

@b_schaffner @jon_m_rob @blfraga and, again, i'd wager a lot of money that all the rbs-frame polling w/validation out there is going to show white col :&gt; white no col
@b_schaffner @jon_m_rob @blfraga you're 15 points *high* on the white no col turnout and 20 points low on white col, v. the CPS. it's clearly not about self-report v. validation; it's about potential bias in a non-prob frame.
@b_schaffner @jon_m_rob @blfraga and it's 20 pts *nationally* not in some state x race subsample of n=whatever small number
@b_schaffner @jon_m_rob @blfraga i'm very familiar tbh; but the gap between you and the cps is like 20 pts on white college educated voters
@jon_m_rob @b_schaffner also true.
@b_schaffner the cps isn't perfect but it probably isn't off by an order of magnitude, which is what the cces figure would be implying
@b_schaffner b) there's a whole world of polling off the file, with the most straightforward validation method at all. in our polling, white col turnout is highest of all and i'd wager we're not going to be alone on that
@b_schaffner a) the prior on education -&gt; higher turnout is extremely strong, I'm sorry. And in this case, the issue would be the frame not the validation method
@b_schaffner the acs16 1yr non-institutional group quarter cvap is 46% no col white, 23% col white. so you're talking something like a 71% white no col turnout rate, and 62% white col
@b_schaffner well, for starters, it's not credible to argue that the white no col turnout rate was notably higher than the white col turnout rate
It's striking that the 'omg exit polls get the demographics wrong!' takes are hitting... after the 2016 election, and often from folks who uncritically used the old exit poll numbers to advance some version of the emerging dem majority/coalition ascendent theory

@cwarshaw @YouGovUS @MorningConsult i'd guess any effects are going to be too small
And while traditionally Democratic 'rust belt' towns have a lot of clout in the Electoral College right now, they aren't especially well-represented among the top battleground districts. 	On the other hand, there are a lot of interesting districts in more rural/agricultural areas
But given the odd fit between Trump/Farm Belt areas, I do wonder whether he's modestly more vulnerable to losing ground there, particularly if his policies have adverse consequences there. So I'll be interested to see whether we see any evidence of it.
His pitch never made a ton of sense in the Farm Belt. Trade, of course. But low levels of racial resentment, as well. And he was weak there in the primary. 	In the end, white educational attainment was dominant: he gained among wwc, wherever/whatever their economic circumstances
For all of the focus on Trump's huge gains in Rust Belt areas, he often made similar or even larger gains in the Farm Belt (IA/ND).	That's always been interesting, since the Farm Belt doesn't really fit the caricature of Trump's America as a post-industrial wasteland
I'm not sure we're going to get the data to figure out how the tariff issue is playing out in the Rust Belt v. the Farm Belt, and whether it moves the needle on POTUS approval there. But I hope we do. I think it's a very interesting question.

@NateSilver538 @Redistrict @SeanTrende @Barnes_Law @henryolsenEPPC @ForecasterEnten @djjohnso @Peoples_Pundit @gelliottmorris My bosses insist that any further discussion on the matter will have to occur over a drink, and I'm inclined to agree
@NateSilver538 @Redistrict @SeanTrende @Barnes_Law @henryolsenEPPC @ForecasterEnten @djjohnso @Peoples_Pundit @gelliottmorris If you give any weight to VA, or have any doubts about replicability of PA/AL--as many smart ppl in this thread do--then the topline results are plausibly consistent w/that possibility, esp w/GA6. (although given small n and noisy special results, it's not so important to me)
@NateSilver538 @Redistrict @SeanTrende @Barnes_Law @henryolsenEPPC @ForecasterEnten @djjohnso @Peoples_Pundit @gelliottmorris The point remains: if the Dem turnout edge slips w/higher turnout--and seems to--there's a real question of whether avg D performance would slip too.

@NateSilver538 @Redistrict @SeanTrende @Barnes_Law @henryolsenEPPC @ForecasterEnten @djjohnso @Peoples_Pundit @gelliottmorris not sure what you're looking at, but when building the PA-18 turnout model--which nailed the total composition of the electorate and vote share by county etc--we exclusively used VA data and dropped the low turnout cong specials bc the numbers were plainly unsustainable
@Redistrict @NateSilver538 @SeanTrende @Barnes_Law @henryolsenEPPC @ForecasterEnten @djjohnso @Peoples_Pundit @gelliottmorris my only contention: it is a question-mark.
@Redistrict @NateSilver538 @SeanTrende @Barnes_Law @henryolsenEPPC @ForecasterEnten @djjohnso @Peoples_Pundit @gelliottmorris it is just a fact that the democratic turnout edge has generally narrowed w/higher turnout. the question is whether the dems will still overperform by a wide margin w/high turnout, as they did in pa-18/al-sen. we're not going to get enough data to resolve the question w/specials

@NateSilver538 afaik, you have not contested that argument except to reiterate a theoretical point about ticket splitting that plainly doesn't apply here. you're welcome to resolve the question differently, but if your case is that there's *no* case in which gov &gt; cong special, i disagree
@NateSilver538 look, i don't want to repeat myself all day. but, you've made an argument for why, in general, gubernatorial contests are less predictive. i've argued that this specific gubernatorial contest was more reminiscent of a midterm across most relevant criteria
@NateSilver538 yes; my argument is that the actual election in question exhibited none of those characteristics. there was little ticket splitting. at the same time, it had other features more typical of a midterm than many specials, re: turnout, competitiveness, generic candidates, etc

@NateSilver538 haven't looked, but it wouldn't affect my view of whether the actual VA gov race was most analogous to the midterms across a fairly wide spectrum of criteria
@NateSilver538 (of a midterm congressional race)
@NateSilver538 thinking about individual contests in 2017, though, the VA gubernatorial contest exhibited more characteristics of a midterm--in terms of turnout, regular schedule, generic national candidates, battleground state status, and result~presvt by precinct--than the other contests
@NateSilver538 i can understand an argument for only looking at special congressional elections. i can't understand an argument for looking at all special elections, including legislative contests, and including regularly scheduled gubernatorial/state leg elections
@NateSilver538 over all, i'd probably rank the VA-GOV race as the single contest that's most analogous to the midterms
@NateSilver538 otoh, these gubernatorial elections--and particularly VA--were as or more correlated with partisan trends than the congressional elections	more importantly though, the same argument applies to the scores of special state legislative elections that 1000s of RTs every tuesday

This is a lean D race after redistricting as far as I'm concerned, so this decision would be fairly understandable from my POV  https://t.co/CQTdCdXCuv
That's all for now. I'll look more later to see whether the Dems had other advantages beyond what's evident from past d/r primary voters. Precinct/census data and our poll will be helpful
(and, that's basically exactly how we arrived at our precinct turnout estimates for last night)
I should also note, btw, that the geography of the turnout in PA-18 (ie: the big turnout in well-educated areas) was almost exactly like VA, except quite a bit lower.
Here's a quick comparison of our pre-election estimate and the actual turnout. Dem edge clear, but modest in a high turnout election like this https://t.co/IXycNEjtll
The Dem turnout was also better than the Upshot/Siena poll, which was modeled at R+5.5. That was expected from the big turnout in NoVA, other D precincts.	OTOH, the age/racial composition of the electorate, OTOH, was exactly in-line with expectations for a midterm electorate.
Past GOP primary voters outnumbered Democrats by a 34 to 30% margin. That's much better than R+8 in 2014, and a bit better than R+4.5 in 2016 (with more no primary voters).	Over all, 84% of Democratic primary voters turned out, v. 80% of past GOP primary voters.
It's taken a long time, but we finally have vote history data from Virginia. Over all, very good numbers for the Democrats, except by the standard of these wild low turnout special elections.
Returning to this question:	Last night, 94% of results explained by giving 85% weight to Clinton's vote and 15% weight to party registration, plus broad Lamb overperformance.
Probably would have been a very good night for the needle if we didn't have to turn it off. Had Lamb+.6 at the time we pulled the plug   https://t.co/ognVSwJnGV
The bottom line: it is not really realistic to see how Saccone ends up with a lead in the initial tabulated count. Haven't read up on recount rules, etc., or double checked for potential errors, but that's Saccone's path at this point.
It's also being pointed out to me that CNN was reporting the number of absentee ballots *sent out*, not returned. So that would raise the bar all that much higher for Saccone
And Lamb won 62% of the Allegheny absentee vote. That's 5% higher than on Election Day. So it seems quite reasonable to make Lamb a clear favorite, assuming he can be expected to run ahead of his Election Day count by a similar margin elsewhere	But would still be soooo close
.@DecisionDeskHQ says last two Westmoreland precincts are Latrobe2 and NLigonier. Saccone could reasonably hope for net-200 there, brings race down to D+650	CNN says there are 3206 absentees outstanding in GOP counties. Saccone would need to win those by 20. He didn't on eday.
We have zero data on the absentee votes here, as well (in GA-6, for instance, we knew exactly who voted by mail absentee, and made very precise and successful estimates on that basis). I'd *guess* these absentees lean Lamb, based on prior elections, but that's it
Lamb held up a bit better in those precincts than expected, giving him a 95 vote lead with two precincts in Westmoreland (which we don't know anything about) and the absentees left to go
(and Westmoreland)
And obviously it should go without staying that there's an MoE on that, especially when you're looking at individual precincts, which can be quite noisy. And then of course are the absentee ballots.
We think Saccone will pick up a net-541 votes in the remaining Election Day vote from Wash/Allegheny County (so, excluding Westmoreland). 	Lamb is up by 585
and yes, that's 784 votes. This is going to be real close.
Assuming we're recreating this right, the current estimate for the *non-Westmoreland* remaining vote, excluding possible late absentee dumps (which we're not tracking rn): Saccone+784
Well I really wish we had the needle right now, but this is exactly the scenario where we're very glad it's off. Can't play this game in such a close race without knowing what's out.
Greene County is done. Lamb ran a point ahead of our estimate for his performance in the event of a districtwide tie, turnout at 98% of expectations
Over all, the results do make Lamb a favorite, but it sure looks close.	The state of the race in the non-Westmoreland precincts:	Expected vote in a tie: Lamb 55.7%; 	Actual vote, Lamb 56.3% percent 	Turnout at 97.7% of expectations
If Westmoreland finishes its count, and the race is still uncalled, we'll try and turn it back on.
Alright folks, we've shut the needle down. As mentioned earlier, Westmoreland County isn't going to produce precinct results, as we believed they would. It's the GOP base of the district. We can't responsibly make a forecast without data from there.
We're still arguing over what to do about this, but it is a distinct possibility that we will turn it off. We can't responsibly model the result without data from the most GOP 1/3 of the district. And, well, we did make sure to write this in advance, in case we had to https://t.co/bpZmMVqbUR
Well folks, we have some bad news. Westmoreland County has told us that they aren't going to report results by precinct tonight (though they had previously told us they would). The model runs on precinct results so, this is a problem.
Map view, if you prefer. https://t.co/JD8aN6o4zw
That's also the least educated part of Allegheny county, so the needle was reading into that for the whole rest of the district. Should be fixed now
Looking at it for myself, Saccone running about 3 pts ahead (6pts of margin) in his own LD, after controlling for partisanship/education. https://t.co/NqfL3TzAiy
One possibility I'll raise here, looking at this map of where the results are better/worse for d/r than expected, is that Saccone is beating expectations in his own state legislative district (southern allegheny county), which the needle isn't considering. https://t.co/EMuugZulVp
Still quite early, but you can see the pattern on the bottom end of the chart. That shows that, in GOP areas, Saccone doing a bit better than we thought he would. But we don't have many GOP areas in so far. I'm a little concerned the needle is overreacting here, but we'll see https://t.co/f4VMUQsKvs
I think we've seen enough from Allegheny county to say that Lamb is basically getting a point or two more out of Allegheny county than we thought he would. But he may be doing a point worse than we thought he would everywhere else. We don't have much data from the rest of the CD
Overall, things are looking a lot like we thought a tied race would look, if a hair better for Lamb. It's going to be a while. https://t.co/Bspgue32GU
Our expectations supposed a very strong Dem turnout in the well-educated suburbs around Pittsburgh, weaker in working class areas. That's being materializing.
Over all, turnout is right in line with our expectations, currently running at 99% of our forecast (which projected to 229k districtwide)
Still early, but Lamb is getting decent news. On average, Lamb running 3 pts ahead of our estimates in fragmentary returns. https://t.co/TitBqM4RCC
Good news for Lamb: He appears to be running ahead of expectations in fragmentary returns white, working class, traditionally Dem Greene County. He inches ahead in our estimate.
We have our first results, and it's right on the line. Turnout at 98.8% of expectations; Lamb ran just over a pt ahead of the baseline for a tied race
we believe that all of the votes remain to be counted https://t.co/CBxCmBZi1S

FWIW, the polling would seem to imply that 2016 pres vote is going to be more important than it was down-ballot in '16, despite Lamb's appeal to traditional Dems. The Monmouth polls had Lamb at 57/63% of the major party vote in Allegheny County.
So far this year, the importance of the 2016 vote has basically always gone up in federal elections, compared to a prior comparable contrast, even when the Dem would seem to have a shot to defy the trend (like Quist in MT-AL)
In the 2016 senate race, 96% of precinct-level results could be explained by just giving 60% weight to Clinton's vote and 39% weight to party reg. 	The case for it to tick-higher: Trump is now president.	The case against: Lamb has run a campaign to appeal to traditional dems

@xenocryptsite when they had great turnout in well-educated areas, ok in hispanic areas, poor turnout w black/wwc voters?
@xenocryptsite like 2016?
@xenocryptsite they don't move the same way within coalitions. the real tension is wwc v. young/nonwhite
@RyanDEnos @SeanTrende @b_schaffner @blfraga @IChotiner liberal/neoliberal whites = the easy part. imo, obama's strength with northern white working class voters has been dramatically underestimated, let alone compared to an average black presidential candidate. and dems still have a lot to lose.
@RyanDEnos @b_schaffner @blfraga @IChotiner well, it might be! i'm honestly not sure. dems still extremely vulnerable to additional wwc loses.
@b_schaffner @blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner it's a huge one, except that it's harder for me to see why they're easy to lure back to the polls (absent nominating a black candidate, which may be a very good option for dems, as i've said)
@b_schaffner @blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner they could be! certainly, i think they would be if we rerun the 2016 election a few more times
@blfraga @b_schaffner @RyanDEnos @IChotiner i thought that data supported the persuasion view tbh. if 1/3 are voting dem downballot in '16 and 37% are dems, that's a ton of vote to work with given that persuasion is more powerful than turnout and wwc is overrepresented in battleground states
@RyanDEnos @b_schaffner @blfraga @IChotiner that very well might be a good move!   https://t.co/7jndMCBes1
@b_schaffner @blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner you could totally be right. and i am very open to being persuaded on that. but tbh, the only thing you showed is that they are less likely to support the next dem than obama-dropoff voters (should they vote in 20), not they're gone for good (and maybe they are!)
@blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner that's one approach, but i think most would say they should reduce the salience of those issues more than compromise on them
@blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner i think you're very familiar with the wide range of means by which dems could try and have more appeal with those voters short of putting an (R) next to their name
@blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner that does not seem very plausible to me tbh
@blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner come on lol
@b_schaffner @blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner but tbh i felt the same way about your argument and turnout. what exactly are you saying the dems should do?
@b_schaffner @blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner there are lots of possibilities. some say the dems should be more populist, downplay cultural stuff. some say nominate a white dude. some say move a little right on guns or something.
@blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner i think that the sort of plausible dem message aimed obama/trump voters would also solidify their support among wwc clinton dems who nonetheless have reservations about the direction of the party
@blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner well, they might not *have* to do anything. but when in conflict w mobilization, the democrats maximize their win prob in pres/senate by choosing an approach/candidate/message aimed at luring back WWC.
@blfraga @RyanDEnos @IChotiner in a presidential race, i think parties basically have the resources to mobilize their voters. i think turnout v. persuasion plays out more in messaging/candidate selection. but in either case, i think that, when in conflict, the dems will generally have to choose persuasion
@RyanDEnos @IChotiner @davidlazer it's definitely not mutually exclusive, though it is easy to imagine tension in mobilizing young/nonwhite v. persuading old/white working class
@RyanDEnos @IChotiner but if the implication is that doing something on messaging/candidate for turnout would be better for dems than something similar on persuasion, which is how i took it, i don't really see the case here (though it could be true)
@RyanDEnos @IChotiner i think the implication was that democrats should *do* something to mobilize additional voters (ie: why it matters that they're being ignored), not *do* something to persuade. i definitely agree that if they do nothing, that they'll get better turnout
4) IF the point is just that it will be easier for Democrats to turnout more voters, then I agree. They'll probably do that even if they do nothing! But that doesn't mean it should be their focus when they select candidates or craft a message, it may mean the opposite.
3) The burden of proof for turnout&gt;persuasion is extremely high. Persuasion/white working class voters would just pay off a lot more for democrats https://t.co/XmU522SIGG
2) I'm still not clear on why it's easy for them to do it? It's easy to say that a party should boost turnout. It's hard to do it. https://t.co/mjgvsyT42X
1) I don't think there's evidence that dem/youth/non-black turnout was weak in '16 https://t.co/aYbvJrBUZx

A question to consider if you're as cool as I am: what county has come closest to voting how you would have voted (or like to think you would have voted) in presidential elections since, say, 1856
@EsotericCD @ForecasterEnten @jbarro this doesn't sound generic at all tbh
It does seem weird to me that everyone's acting like the GOP has already lost PA-18  (maybe they have, they're acting like it, after all!) https://t.co/ENAO0PRTBF
@chupacerveza the right question is 'from'
@jbarro he might be the only battleground state senator who i can't picture in my head
@jbarro that's about as generic as it gets.
Just amazing how the Dems/Reps always fail to recruit Generic Candidate
It's been a month since the GOP pulled to within 5 or 6 points of the Democrats on the generic ballot. 	Now, we're back to where we were before the tax debate began https://t.co/2gOD5Yowff https://t.co/Ei1ZSY01Hu
Dems back to a 9 point edge in the generic ballot, per Monmouth. Their last poll had it at just D+2, which set off a wave of pieces about GOP surging post-taxes  https://t.co/N8RT6USsNY
@stevesingiser among people who remain registered to vote in TX23, the '14 primary vote was 60d/40r, per L2 data
@stevesingiser pretty similar in 14 iirc
@stevesingiser D&gt;R turnout in TX23 is normal
One place where Dems can feel pleased: TX-32, Pete Session's district. The primary vote was 50.8 R to 49.2 D. From any standpoint other than the pre-primary hype, that's a pretty incredible figure in a such a staunchly Republican area.
With the count essentially completed, the GOP primary ballot edge in Texas stands at about 59.8 to 40.2%. That's a lot narrower than any recent primary there, but I would say it fell short of the Democratic hype there.
Mary Wilson has overtaken Joseph Kosper in the TX-21 Dem primary, which is something of a surprise to me, at least. They'll both make the run-off, but it's no show of strength for the DCCC/establishment preferred candidate, even if he does retake the lead.
@davidkaczyn üëç
Over all, it hasn't been a great night for those who argue that money buys election results https://t.co/bn0XRGMfUb
For the handful of you who care, TX CD-level partisan primary tallies are easily predicted with '16 primary tallies and '16 presidential results + intercept shift towards Dems. https://t.co/C7DX1U05TZ
GOP edge now at about 22 points, 61 to 39 percent. Dems should gain back some ground, but I suspect this won't prove to be the night they were imagining. None of their top candidates are posting great numbers. And this doesn't look like the vote of a 'blue' Texas
We'll see what the final tallies are, but I would be https://t.co/C6gYS31UDi
Really stunning. There were definitely indications that the wheels had come off, but still https://t.co/qUtAvay9GH
Correction: it's nearly a 20 point GOP lead in the Texas primary vote ( I thought I had refreshed that figure; I did not and so it was very out of date), though Democratic areas are still disproportionately left to report
Republicans now ahead by 12 points. Big question now is how well the Democrats held up in the Election Day vote
It's still early, and there's reason to think the results aren't yet representative, but so far the primary vote tallies are a lot more reassuring for the GOP in TX 2/6 than 21. 	GOP still holding a ~20 pt edge in 2/6, but just a 6 pt edge in TX 21. 	All 3 were ~T+10 in '16
@Redistrict @SeanTrende lol you're on the list but not at the top, that's for sure
@SeanTrende great for RTs tho
(...and why I never tweeted that figure)
@marywitha4 it was
In fairness to the Democrats, this is a lot better than 2016 (was nearly 2:1 GOP). But OTOH, all of the early voting tallies showing Dems ahead in the 15 largest (IE: most Dem) counties painted a fairly unrepresentative picture of the state
Republicans now up to a nearly 5 point lead statewide in Texas primary vote, with a lot of GOP leaning areas (and probably GOP-leaning election day vote) still to come.
Tiny is in comparison to their prior standing, to be clear. 8 pts obviously not so small in other contexts.
Republicans with a tiny 54-46 edge in the TX-7 early vote, where John Culberson is running in another traditionally GOP/Clinton district. 2016 primary split was R71, D29.
Democrats narrowly outrunning Republicans in the TX-32 early vote, where Pete Sessions is running for reelection in a traditionally GOP district that voted narrowly for Clinton. In 2016, the primary vote was R68%-D32%.
Laura Moser, who earned a DCCC attack recently, is in second place in the first batch of early votes in TX-07. Fletcher at 31%, Moser at 22%, Westin at 20%.  Top two go to a run-off

(TX7/32 are less interesting because they're very competitive no matter the result tonight. OTOH, Trump won 2/6/21 fairly comfortably, even if he was weak. I'd like to see more evidence that 16 is the new normal there, or even more Dem, before jumping on train in those CDs)
The biggest thing I'm curious about tonight: the Dem v. Rep primary vote tallies in TX-2, 6 and 21. 7 and 32 to a lesser extent.	GOP might feel ok about these seats bc of strong GOP tradition. If Dems are coming close/leading, I don't think that argument remains very persuasive
@BrownTristanh a democratic presidential primary
I wouldn't go overboard here, fwiw. I just don't have this data going very far back. But it makes sense to me that it should mean something, if in no other way than as a measure for base engagement, which matters a lot in midterms

PA-18, lean Rep --&gt; likely Rep. until more info known on post-special world	PA-4, solid Rep --&gt; likely Rep.	PA-3, solid Rep. --&gt; likely Rep. (if there's a viable challenger)
If I were rating these districts, I'd probably say (using old IDs)	PA-7, lean Dem --&gt; solid Dem, off the board.	PA-6, lean Rep/toss-up --&gt; lean Dem. 	PA-8, lean Rep --&gt; toss-up	PA-15, lean Rep/toss-up --&gt; lean Dem	PA-12, Solid Rep --&gt; lean Rep./toss-up (pending Wolf run)	1/2
@Handende iirc saccone wins the special, he'll be in the district. if not it's open
Same thing for Rothfus too, who has the added challenge of a district that votes for Democrats downballot with some regularity. He's in a really tough spot, and that's before considering a possible showdown with Lamb
And remember: redistricting doesn't just move the underlying partisanship of a district. It also erodes the advantage of incumbency. "Clinton+9" is bad enough, but it understates the blow that Costello just took
(I don't think I'd be ready to say that without the challenge against Rothfus/Fitzpatrick becoming a tad stronger, but it's close)

It is fair to say that this map was drawn with the goal of achieving partisan balance, even though that was not a stated goal of the order.
If true, Democrats get everything they could want. The new versions of the old PA7/15/6/8 are near optimal for them. Conor Lamb would have a high-profile contest in a competitive race with Keith Rotfhus in the old PA-12 (new 17). PA-10 is a brand new race.

I think it's important to look at the actual simulations on occasion, and not just the summary statistics. And IMO, if the simulations aren't good enough to be used for the remedy then they may not be especially useful to judge gerrymandering more generally
And hey, maybe there's a future where we get generate 500 simulations and then the two parties eliminate options 1 by 1 until we have a map!
According to the brief, these plans were selected from Chen's simulations. The brief claims great compactness scores, etc. 	And the plan generates partisan balance by splitting Pittsburgh into multiple Democratic districts and having a Dem outcome in PA-16 (Chester-Lancaster)

@gabesmall splitting berks like that achieves a political purpose--in this case, carving out Democratic Reading and putting it in GOP PA-16, therefore making PA-6 pretty conservative.

@ElectProject @PoliticsWolf I would guess the Democratic map? But in terms of the partisan advantage with respect to a likely court map--which we'll find out soon enough--I'd guess it's relatively comparable
@BrianAmos where did you get the .shp btw
@PoliticsWolf I would argue, in fact, that it's about as good for Democrats as the GOP map was good for Republicans. In fact, it usually just makes the exact reverse of the GOP's choice.
@PoliticsWolf There's a great case to wish for a different set of criteria. But in the mean time, I'm going to judge maps by the criteria that we have, and by the criteria that the court has outlined. And by that standard, this is a great map for Democrats
@PoliticsWolf I'm talking about a Dem advantage compared to a map that adheres strives to maximize partisan-blind redistricting criteria, which has been your standard for years
Turns out it's a 7D-11R map--which is a tactful way to obscure the big Dem advantages here (much as it was tactful for GOP to flip PA08 to keep it 6/6) https://t.co/n8yP2wzImS
And it's a good district for Lamb, should he win or want to run again in November
(that's 9/9 in the '16 presidential election, to be clear)
Don't have the shapefile needed to calculate the results here, but it looks like a 9-9 split to my eye, thanks to a truly inspired PA-11. Could be 8D/10R though.

@dwbeard well what is 'as one would think'? i'd say, not as well as you'd think based on the special election results alone. they might do very well by other standards, based on all of the other evidence of dem strength
i meant KS-4; MT-AL turnout data is bad
And we do have the data back from higher turnout specials like GA-6 and MT-AL, and the Democratic turnout advantage was nothing compared to these low turnout (though very impressive by any other standard!)
We don't have the data back from there yet, but in all likelihood the Democratic turnout advantage in Virginia was nothing compared to their turnout advantage in these specials https://t.co/gaDw2RcF49
@mcimaps i didn't say there wasn't. i'm just saying that this is an exceptionally favorable and probably unsustainable turnout pattern. also remember that likely holds within party voters, as well
@mcimaps a 5pt gap in favor of the democrats is *massive* by the standards of a general election. the dems basically never even have a turnout edge at all
@alex_patton exactly
It's important to remember that the Dems are doing so well in special elections in no small part because of a turnout advantage that will be very difficult to sustain in a higher turnout/general election.
@yeselson @UpshotNYT i think it's more like 1 with some somewhat better opportunities elsewhere
lol https://t.co/yEi7BmC6Wx
But the bottom line is that there are a lot of different ways to handle it, with big partisan implications
But there are other interesting possibilities that I haven't seen represented on many maps (which may just mean they're unlikely) including a version of the 16th that takes in all of non-PA7 Chester County + eastern Lancaster and pushes PA-6 into Schuylkill or Lebanon Co.
Personally, I think the map that @Redistrict has floated is most realistic here. I think the maps that want to carve out Reading and put it with either Lancaster or Chester Co., depending on the partisanship of the map drawer, are tough sells
probably *not much on PA-8
PA-6, OTOH, can break in any number of ways, and without much of a trade-off. There's also a very real possibility that Chrissy Houlahan--a strong Dem recruit--gets drawn out of the district.
The new PA-7 and PA-15 will be significantly more Democratic. It'll be interesting to see by how much, but I doubt the Dems will complain with what they get. PA-8 will get a little more Democratic, but probably much. PA18/12/3 will be interesting, but they largely trade-off.
With the Pennsylvania map now to be drawn by the court, I think there's really only one truly *big* question left: what will happen to PA-6?
If true, a big recruiting turnaround for the Republicans  https://t.co/WkGPwSus9L

Correction: the proposed GOP map in Pennsylvania has 12 Trump districts and 6 Clinton districts, not 5/13.	PA-08 voted for Clinton by .7, not Trump by 0.1	The error was mine. I'm sorry, and thanks to @BrianAmos for figuring it out. I'm deleting the initial tweet. https://t.co/4PrCFd04SD

@NathanWurtzel you can do 8-10 pretty easily
I should note that given said MoE that there is a possibility that Clinton would have won this PA-08, which here is estimated at Trump +0.1. One commenter has suggested as much.
@RecoveringPolAd possible; there is a margin of error of sorts on these estimates and it is the slimmest of margins.
@davidshor @hezaproject @PoliticsWolf you don't care whether texas fails a mean/median test?
@hezaproject @davidshor @PoliticsWolf the latter is my biggest issue with it
@PoliticsWolf @davidshor idk if the challenge would succeed. all i said was that there was an argument. and it's not a bad argument. order says you can only split for pop balance. you wouldn't have a tough time arguing that the main purpose of this split is to change a partisan outcome
@davidshor @PoliticsWolf i'd take the EG over mean/median tbh
@PoliticsWolf @davidshor i'm not trying to imply that you're arguing in bad faith. i do think that looking at it from the other POV clarifies that splitting PIT to produce an additional district for party X that couldn't be produced otherwise would likely face a legal challenge
@davidshor @PoliticsWolf though if i had a magic wand to achieve partisan balance, as i think you've asked before, i'm not really sure how i would do it
@davidshor @PoliticsWolf absolutely. dems won't get 'fair' maps without changing the criteria for a nonpartisan map, imo, and legislation is definitely the clearest way to do it
@jongeeting @PoliticsWolf @davidshor yes, over 08/10 data
@PoliticsWolf @davidshor i think you'd make a different argument if it worked to the disdvantage of the democrats
@PoliticsWolf @davidshor yeah, you can get to 9-9 if you split pittsburgh, though an unnecessary pittsburgh split arguably violates the order
@kkondik esp in this environment. but tbh i don't think that it's a favor to the democrats or something. the alternatives also involve a competitive 12 (or 3), and often draw rothfus/kelly together
@davidshor no tbh
@cwgNAS @conorsen nope, this is at target
@conorsen something like this preserves the core idea but undoes some of the flagrantly gop friendly choices. maybe it's the end game https://t.co/MxbiAuCLo8
@EastNash10 @conorsen they could also demand that 17 has more of luzurne county, drops wyoming/susquehanna. point is, they're a handful of tweaks away from an acceptable map--if they wanted to pursue it
@EastNash10 @conorsen well cd8/15 are ~tied, and basically acceptable as they are. if you're the dems you demand that reading ends up in pa-6, lower merion township in 7. reorient 14/18 in a way that helps Lamb. and then i think you have a map that dems could at least consider
@conorsen it's actually not *that* far from where the Dems could accept it. There are a ton of GOP friendly choices but they're small choices, not fundamental ones
@conorsen i assume you try and negotiate from here
There are some other fun choices too. Pretty sure it draws Conor Lamb and Chrissy Houlahan out of PA18/6 (in addition to making PA6 notably more conservative). Dems are better positioned in PA7/15, but that's inevitable.
These estimates are based on precinct data from @rarohla and in my experience they do tend to have a small MoE (like &lt;1 pt) for various reasons
And, again, there‚Äôs no incentive for GOP to draw a map as bad for them as a ct drawn map, so not surprising that there are GOP friendly choices. But probably too many to have a realistic shot here
That said I‚Äôd be surprised if this was accepted by Wolf

@Wertwhile but, remember, even if the most recent election is more predictive you would still expect the dems to outrun Clinton most in areas where she did poorly, so long as the penultimate contest has any weight at all
@Wertwhile i think 2010 is probably the most salient recent example and it certainly holds there
@Wertwhile i'm not sure what you're asking if you're not asking whether the most recent/penultimate pres election is most predictive
@Wertwhile history on what--whether the most recent or penultimate presidential election is more predictive? most recent is traditionally dominant, but penultimate has sway too (though that may only be a proxy for latent partisanship, better measured by national party reg if it existed)
@Wertwhile I think you would expect Dems to make larger gains over C in areas where she did poorly, but I wouldn't read too much into the geography of ultra-low interest, non-nationalized state races
@DKElections @Redistrict i want no part of this argument, but there's clearly at least *evidence* that 'targeting' wasn't the Dem problem in Trumpy VA, and that they've had bigger turnout advantages in lower turnout races https://t.co/sQfHtWIyw0
Two other ways to think about what I'm saying:	--these ratings imply a toss-up for House control, which is how most people think about a D+7 environment  	--a fancy model accounting for the environment, recruitment, etc., would produce very similar ratings under a D+7 environment
With generic ballot slipping, one might think that Dem gains on Cook Ratings seem a little odd.	But these changes make the ratings consistent with a D+6-D+8 environment. 	In general--and this is not a criticism--ratings have lagged the environment all year. Not so true now.

@Redistrict Though on that point, it is not obvious to me whether PA Dems would rather make PA15 or 17 more blue, given the choice on where to put southern Monroe County
@Redistrict There's clearly risk--both upside and downside--for Dems in PA17. But given who is drawing the map and the availability of reasonable PA17 options, I think Dems would take the risk over cementing 3/4 GOP philly suburban districts (esp since more R PA17s usually --&gt; more D PA15)

@DemocraticLuntz it's possible. there's definitely upside for Dems there, but there are lots of reasonable options that leave PA-12 pretty safely Republican (like a Butler+north Allegheny CD)
(that's hardly assured, to be clear)
A Pennsylvania map won't effect the PA-18 special election	But it might make it less important	Possible that the new PA-18 would be more conservative, and it might not even include Allegheny County at all anymore (Lamb home). If that happened, even a D win could be short-lived
If I were the GOP, I might let PA-15 be a Clinton district if I could keep Costello/Smucker and Rothfus/Kelly apart, and I could keep PA-8 out of Philly. IDK if Wolf would take it. But he might, esp since Boyle would probably rather keep something like his current CD
Obviously, a string GOP on GOP primaries + additional open seats = bad news for GOP. One of their biggest incentives, I would think, to try and produce a viable map in the leg.
Candidates, of course, can run outside of their district. But they'll be deprived of their home base and far more vulnerable in primaries. In some cases, it's hard to imagine they'd venture as far as needed (like Costello running in a Berks Co. CD)
On a 'nonpartisan map', very possible that Boyle (D)/Fitzpatrick are drawn into PA-8; Brady(D)/Meehan/Costello all drawn into PA-7; if Costello not in PA-7, highly likely he's in same district as Smucker (whether 6 or 16). Kelly/Rothfus also in big danger of drawn into same CD
One of the most interesting things to watch in PA is residency. It's one way that the new map could help Dems the most, and one of the better reasons why the GOP might seriously try to get a viable map out of state leg.

@henryolsenEPPC yes, i admit that i didn't give any thought to how to draw among the heavily dem districts. was just trying to skip ahead to the more competitive areas
@DKElections i think that saying that the dems could pick up like 6 seats as a result of this decision is misleading and exaggerates the net-effect of a new map
@Brian_Chovanec some of them. but some people are counting seats that are basically just as competitive either way, or only move somewhat towards the dems, or where reps would still be heavily favored
@DKElections that is not a controversial point
@KeystoneObsrvr @HotlineJosh no way the dems accept that imo. need either 6 or 16 to still be somewhat competitive for dems to even consider it
It's not useful to point out that the new PA map could elect up to six new Dems. So could the current map
@mrpaweska it might
@k_hahn97 it's going to be a vote sink no matter what tbh
Maybe Wolf would veto this. But I don't think the court drawn map would be vastly worse for GOP (though given the partisan breakdown, maybe it would be). Worth the shot
Boyle* not Brady
If I'm the PA GOP, I try and do something like this with eastern PA. Use Brady's NE PHI residency to compel Dems to keep PA-13/PA-8 in ~same configuration. Make PA-7 into a Dem sink. Stay in the game in both 16/6, be safe in the other. Unify Lehigh Valley, but keep it Trump https://t.co/A966iPGJl2

@kkondik it's clearly important! but i see people talking about 4 or 5 seats and that's just not a useful way to look at it
Outside of PA-15/7, the new map is probably a wash in SEPA. PA-8 won't a ton. D gains in 6 or 16 will largely trade-off with the other.	Won't be any *great* Dem opportunity elsewhere. Will be some option for Ds in 11/3 on a new map. But nothing great
That's especially true if you think, as I do, that the two seats where the Dems get the biggest immediate benefit are PA-15 and 7. GOP already in big trouble in both spots.
To start with, the Dems are probably favored to win two seats now. They could win even more--there are 6 PA GOP seats on the battleground list right now. That diminishes the net-effect of the ruling.
Kind of feel like Twitter is overrating how many seats the Dems are likely to get out of a new map, or they're defining Dem gains differently than I would
A huge loss for the Republicans: the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ordered a new congressional map in one of the country's most gerrymandered states. 	It's a state case, so SCOTUS appeal is unlikely.	It's likely to cost the GOP a seat, and undermine their position in others
And, as many pointed out: CHIP off the table, though I'd argue that was just a show the whole time
IMO, it was never credible to argue that the GOP would just concede on DACA. They never had an exit strategy. Getting out quickly with any concession is good for them, given that their position was mediocre
Here's one way to think about it: are Dems better positioned now than on Thursday?	I'd argue yes.	--Have a promise on DACA vote. Their GOP doesn't do it. If it passes, that's good for Ds too. 	--No loss of leverage v. Thurs., since just 3 week CR. Can go shutdown route again
I appear to be the only person who thinks the Dems played this pretty well.

@samisaguy assuming that you mean 'true mean' as in the mean we'd be reverting to, then I'd reframe to say that the true mean is D+9 and that the polls are distributed around D+9 if you take a longer term view of the polls than most poll estimators (RCP, 538, Twitter, etc.)
@samisaguy Maybe the easier way to think about it is in terms of short-term averages (RCP/538 tracker/this week's polls) v. a longer term average. Short-term movements often ephemeral; likely to move at least partially back towards longer-term average
The difference between D+7 and D+11 is big in one way: the threshold for House control might very well be in the lower-end of that range. 	But the difference between D+7/D+11 with 10 months to go isn't big, especially if you believe polls tend to be mean-reverting (like i do)

@amyewalter i don't think they're capped at all. they could do much better than '06. but i do think the map is tougher if they have the same set of opportunities but start w/9 fewer seats
That basically means erasing half of the Dem margin of victory from '06. You go from a fairly clear Dem win on the old map to something around lean D/toss-up in an '06 type wave
This piece is right that the Dems have roughly the same *opportunities* as the Dems did in '06, but there's a catch: 	They start with fewer seats with 9 fewer seats, and that's the easy measure of how much harder the map is for Dems now.    https://t.co/KBz1q2TRHo

@ViennaCovfefe because until the court rules otherwise, precedent says gerrymandering is ok. so it was unlikely they would allow a ruling to the contrary to take effect until they weighted in

@PoliticsWolf @hezaproject @marcatracy @AlecMacGillis @cwarshaw do you have new maps? i thought you did a lower/upper split on bucks/montco, even used it as your main example of the way districts should be drawn
@cwarshaw @hezaproject @marcatracy @AlecMacGillis @UpshotNYT i'd be interested to see what the '08-10 composite looks like, but this map is 9/9 in the '12 pres. election fwiw
@hezaproject @marcatracy @AlecMacGillis @cwarshaw and while i (don't think) the chen simluations are available online, the sample map is very similar to ours: at best 8/10 clinton/trump and could easily be only 6/12
@hezaproject @marcatracy @AlecMacGillis @cwarshaw fwiw 'fair' is generally not being judged by 2016 pres results. I suspect the plan in our article today would pass fairness tests based on 08-10 data, like in the chen expert report
@LiberalVirginia @hezaproject @marcatracy @AlecMacGillis no, but it runs afoul of traditional nonpartisan districting values/criteria
@hezaproject @marcatracy @AlecMacGillis that i agree with (though i personally struggle to draw a reasonable map that gives dems an equal shot, judged strictly by pres results)
@LiberalVirginia @hezaproject @marcatracy @AlecMacGillis why does it matter if cincinnati is split? it's a big city
@hezaproject @marcatracy @AlecMacGillis (a reasonable one, of course)

If the courts rule against gerrymandering, fairer maps would give Democrats a better shot.	If there's no limit on gerrymandering, it could get a lot worse.

Got to start wondering about the flip side, too: are reluctant high-quality Dem recruits going to go for it?
@NateSilver538 @scottnotsky I don't think that's necessarily inappropriate. I think you made a similar case post-16 on 71% Clinton, and it's largely justified.	That said, there's truth there. Our categories were based on the ratings folks (for the comparison board) and I'd guess they avoid being 'wrong'
@NateSilver538 @scottnotsky otoh, i might feel misled if a certain writer said they disagreed with a certain other writer and then i made it to the last paragraph and found out they disagreed by 5%
@NateSilver538 @scottnotsky at 65/35 or 60/40, i'd expect the writer to acknowledge which side had the advantage, preferably quickly, but i wouldn't feel misled at all
@NateSilver538 @scottnotsky i doubt that's how most people think about it, but i don't think the point of these characterizations is to communicate the percentage. we have the numbers for that.
@NateSilver538 @scottnotsky i really don't think i agree with the latter point. on football, i'd guess that most fans would say that a game is a toss-up if there are two equal teams. they might give the edge to the home team, of course, and if you had a toss-up "tilt X" category, I think they'd take it
@charleyg_93 @NateSilver538 if you get a 'toss-up tilts  X" category, I definitely agree that's where it would fit. but if it's toss-up/lean/likely, I think it's right on the border between toss-up and lean
@msalgado @scottnotsky @NateSilver538 i disagree. toss-up about trying to communicate how they should feel about the level of uncertainty, not to tell them to the p(x). you have the number for that. (it's 68 if the leading team has the ball)
@scottnotsky @NateSilver538 pregame line even
@NateSilver538 idk what a poker player would call anything. otoh, i think most football fans would call a 3 pt lead at the beginning of the 4th quarter a toss-up
And similarly, the Upshot line between lean/likely is traditionally 85/15; the line between likely/solid is 95/5
@NateSilver538 needless to say i was expecting you to come in lower than 35!
@NateSilver538 i know
Upshot style is that toss-up = &lt;65/&gt;35  (though I have no strong feelings on the appropriate definition)  https://t.co/Lr8ajHb6Pt
I mean, maybe Issa was up 17 over Applegate... in the open primary (with multiple Dems)
Doesn't really seem credible, given that Issa beat Applegate by like 1/2 pt in '16 https://t.co/OXfbHuWdIe
@richardmskinner But, as things are, NY-24, CA-21, PA-7, FL-25, WA-3, NY-2, IL-13, VA-2 all high on the list.
@richardmskinner we're far enough into the cycle that it's a little harder to judge, since it requires some conditional assumptions about recruitment. ie: districts with poor dem recruitment at this stage should move up the list, but that might change/we dk whether a retirement would fix it
300 days to go until the midterm
For the first time this cycle, the number of retirements in competitive GOP districts is higher than any other party since 2006  https://t.co/K28PGGak6t https://t.co/w7qCYo6Up3
At this point, there can't be much doubt that Sun Belt districts--largely uncompetitive in 06/08--will be the core of the Dem path to a majority. 2/4 O.C. incumbents gone. IRL out. McSally Senate bid seemingly imminent. We've already seen GA-6, VA  https://t.co/pxYRZmO6Ha
@KhemlaniVinesh @SeanMcElwee NJ-2, FL-27, WA-8, PA-15, KS-2, CA-39 all more valuable. By the numbers, TX-21 could/should join the group, but not yet rated competitive enough by the ratings folks for me to push that case
@SeanMcElwee that doesn't really say much, but i'd put it at 7
@Bencjacobs sure, it's clearly helpful to them
For this same reason, though, I don't consider Issa to be one of the most valuable retirements for the Democrats. This seat was already leaning Democrat in my view, and this retirement doesn't quite put it away, either.
And the fact that Issa did so poorly in '16 is an indicator that the district's traditional GOP-lean won't do a ton to help the party in '18
Republicans do still have some cause to keep their hopes alive. The Dem field isn't great and the district does have a traditional GOP bent. Registration is R+6; Romney won by 7. But in this political environment, it's going to be really really hard to keep an Clinton+9 open seat
Another big retirement for the Democrats. Issa entered the cycle as perhaps the nation's most vulnerable incumbent. His district voted for Clinton by 9 points  https://t.co/unJf4bOsNF
@Redistrict Yeah but i bet we could draw a 3-3 split out of it if we had some geoids on these respondents
@amalietuffin nah, a fair map would still be 2
@SenhorRaposa nah, they'll manage to keep pittenger viable (he might still lose, but not strictly because of gerrymandering; indeed, he could lose now)
@LiberalVirginia nah
A redrawn map in North Carolina, if it ultimately happens, would probably be worth 2 seats to the Democrats in '18 https://t.co/I8qP8mVGrr
