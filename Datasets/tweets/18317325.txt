Exporting #natgas makes sense since we flare off excess at night because it's cheaper to burn than capture. We could weaken #Putin's hand.

RT @GOPLeader: RT if you agree: fantastic response by @cathymcmorris! #closethegap #SOTU
No to creating jobs. No to cutting spending. No to rolling back the failed health care law. No to American energy independence.
What the President didn’t say tonight is that dysfunctional Washington Democrats have become the party of no.
The same failed rhetoric from #POTUS who believes he knows best  how to grow our economy despite the ingenuity of hard working Nebraskans.
What I heard tonight was more of the same. #SOTU
Missing tonight was mention of the #KeystoneXL - a project that will create 42K #jobs.
Thank you Cory.
@FauxPelini almost done!
Until #Iran completely dismantles its nuclear weapons we should support existing sanctions &amp; move forward w/ proposals to strengthen them.
President Rouhani might say all the right things but actions are what count. This shouldn’t be a negotiation.
I do hope that you fix the health care system...cause you're right Mr. President....healthcare.gov is broken. #OpenExchanges
I've learned from #SubCMT hearings manufacturing jobs pay on avg of $77K/year. Many of those middle class jobs that aren't being filled

RT @RepLarryBucshon: #SKILLSAct is still awaiting Senate action.
The President said he will act to slash bureaucracy and streamline permitting for projects. Ok.Take your pen and sign #KeystoneXL.
@MortonOWH I'm always thinking about #KeystoneXL
@flocktard The Senate for one!
I've wrote a bipartisan bill to remove barriers for foreign direct investment. Unfortuantely, it's gathering dust in the Senate.
#Manufacturers are looking for more skilled workers Mr. President. 40 witnesses have said so. #SubCMT
#POTUS has added more than $6.5 tril to the debt. An avg of $54,412 for each person in the US
#POTUS calling for a year of action after 5 yrs of trying to decide the #KeystoneXL Pipeline. #TimetoBuild
Manufacturers have told #SUBCMT that they jobs available but can't find skilled workers to hire.  #SOTU
The lowest unemployment rate in over five years is because people stopped looking for work. #SOTU
