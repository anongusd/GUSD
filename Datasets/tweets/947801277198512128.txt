@JohnMayer I have just listened to it on your website, and I really like it. :)
@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN I haven't seen that movie yet. By the way, I'm a big fan of your work with Metal Gear Solid. I completed I think the second and third of the series a long, long time ago. Solid Snake is a really cool character.
@shaneandshane None. Could it be because I'm listening Mozart while doing vocal exercises?
@hitRECordJoe I'm a little over I think.
@ArianaGrande You're a dream.
@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN Wow! I can't wait, either.
@kiki_passo Super gorgeous
@jjabrams I'm super excited to see this. My relatives and friends here in Indonesia are huge fans of Star Wars as well. Gonna be a huge party! :D
@ashleytisdale Wow!
@ChrisEvans Happy Valentine's Day, you two!
@Kotaku So I didn't end up playing The Last of Us last weekend. Maybe next time. Lol.
@shaneandshane Counting sheep? :)
https://t.co/cEqWqlgrR5
@charlieputh I haven't seen The Notebook yet. BTW, I love your latest released album, "Voicenotes". It's so great. :D
@Kotaku The Last of Us, yet again. :D What game is that?
@AADaddario @selashiloni You definitely should make an album. I bet it'll really good.
@OfficialBWFC That is difficult for me. I have no idea.
@assassinscreed I missed it. :(
@MarkusFeehily Wah! That's 1 AM my time. I really want to be there, but not sure if I can make it. I'll try, though.
@fabiocannavaro Happy Chinese New Year!
@MarkRuffalo I don't think we get Superbowl here in Indonesia, but I just can't wait for the movie.
@hitRECordJoe And I haven't seen too many Tarantino movies, btw, including Jackie Brown. I saw Reservoir Dogs and Django Unchained, and maybe one or two more of Tarantino's. I saw Dusk till Dawn if that was Tarantino's.
@hitRECordJoe My fave Tarantino movie is probably Pulp Fiction.
@RileyKeough Well, at let you've got a little bit of tan. ;)
@RileyKeough Wow.
@NiallOfficial Yay! I'm excited about this.😃
@mriankiely I envy you. ;)
@asmrDarling I hope you have an awesone day, too.
@shaneandshane My last reading in the Bible were Psalms 43 and Proverbs 9.
@Ashtronova You look beautiful there in that picture.
@adamlambert Happy birthday!
@ArianaGrande You're mushy.
@theREALboyzone My personal favorite is "Isn't It A Wonder".
@juliamichaels It has been great. How is yours?
@MRMIKEYGRAHAM I totally agree. Boyzone being disbanded was a downer.
@kiki_passo I want to be your photographer.
@shaneandshane Lol!
@TAMU Thank you! 😀
@TAMU Gig 'em!		I loved being at Texas A&amp;M campus. I Iived there for over three years and had a blast beyond what I can explain. 😀
@Ashtronova What are your eye measurements?
@hillsongunited Salvation is Here	King of Majesty	His Love	I Surrender	With All I Am		These are off the top of my head. :D
@Ashtronova I'm sure you still look good.
@ashleytisdale Fun loving
@theREALboyzone I haven't been watching since I have been so busy. However, I would really love to see more. This one being posted is awesome. :)
@JoelOsteen Mostly it's discouragement over things that do not work out as what was prayed and/or thought.
@JoelOsteen That is very true.
@SarahKSilverman I haven't seen I Killing Eve yet, but Bodyguard seemed to be in the genres of Avenging Angelo and Guarding Tess, which are movies that I really like.

@benrector They were playing your song, "Brand New", Ben, in a wedding that me and my parents and my nephew went to in Jakarta, Indonesia. This was about 2 months ago.
I have posted another mail to John Mayer. It should have arrived by now or maybe tomorrow at the latest.
Although I had listened to most songs in that album a long time ago. It's just that I didn't realize about the album itself. https://t.co/77ijLm4Qt7
And I just recently realized about Face to Face album. https://t.co/A7ZfVtdCTS
Actually I tried listening to the albums I mentioned again recently, and it turns out that my memories failed me. So basically, I had listened to all the song in Turnaround, but in the other two albums I mentioned here, only half or more. https://t.co/A7ZfVtdCTS
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/ktC6xyaXCH
I mentioned a while ago that I only owned the first three Westlife albums. However, I had listened to all the songs in their next three albums as well, which are in Turnaround, The Love Album, and Allow Me to Be Frank. This was like about 10 years ago.

ok
I really like this Ben Rector song.		https://t.co/I0NlMRkopk
I've sent another letter to John Mayer, which most likely has arrived by now, or tomorrow at the latest.
By this time, John should have had received his letter from me, or at least it would have arrived in his mailbox.
Although not all of them; a few or some of them.
T-2
The post officer said that the letter would take a week or two to be delivered. So it should've arrived by now or at the latest another 6 days. So, T-6.
I've been mulling over it too much, but I finally sent out my third letter to John Mayer about 5 days ago. It should arrive in about 3 to 10 days from now.		T-3 to 10 days. I probably should make a countdown every few days or something.
Oh, and more importantly, they still sound the same to me as they were back then, which is very important.
When I "fall in love" with a song or songs, I'd listen to them over and over again. David's songs were very addictive back then. I couldn't even imagine that now, 16 years later, they're even more addictive.		And that's the honest truth.
Look. I love sharing these things. And this is the honest truth.		This past couple of weeks, I've been listening to David Tao songs again, and they bring me back nostalgic memories, mostly the times that I lived in Boston when I first listened to his songs in 2002.
I plan on writing another letter to John Mayer this week. He hasn't replied to the letters that I had sent out to him, so I thought he needed some space. ;P And I know that he's a very busy person, so I figured I should wait. I've also been pretty much swamped these days.

So, it looks like my phone camera cuts off the videos at around 4,193,000 KB. https://t.co/4KT0c61vnN
I can now do vocal runs and higher notes much, much better in these covers. I am now not a regular subscriber to sore throats after a lot of singings. I am also much, much more comfortable and confident with singing than ever before in my entire life. :) :) :) :) :)
I then took a break because I felt that my vocals were very lacking. What a huge improvement to my vocals I have made since I began practicing again last year! This is especially true since I practiced intensively starting a couple of months ago.
Last year, I put out about 22 song covers on YouTube, mostly 1D songs. However, I took them down after realizing that it might be an illegal thing to do.		Since the beginning of this year, I have been doing a lot 1D songs covers again.
I just completed 1D album "FOUR" + 9 other 1D songs with a duration of 2:05:24 (2 hours 5 minutes 24 seconds) non-stop. The songs qualities are solid * * and some on * * *, while only one is *.		Giving myself another pat on the back! :)
Another correction: two songs are * (close to * *). https://t.co/tDj1ugGaVh
Correction: FOUR Deluxe version (16 songs) https://t.co/2Dq7dARyLn
I just completed 1D album "FOUR" with a duration of 1:18:58 (1 hour 18 minutes 58 seconds) non-stop. The songs qualities are solid * * and some on * * *.		Givng myself a pat in the back! :)

https://t.co/cS7XLvzL3A		The first semester that I went to the University of Illinois, I went to church campus Friday night services of Illini Life (really fun times). There, I saw some people performing John Mayer's "Why Georgia" right before a service.
https://t.co/7PaFD0SWwm		I like this John Mayer's new song. It has an oldie feel to it, but it's still modern in a way.
I returned home last night.
13th May 2018
I think I did well. 😀
"I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."		Galatians 2:20 ESV
I am walking down the downtown streets of Belfast right now, and there is literally no other human being here (well, maybe one or two).
"And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world."		1 John 4:14 ESV
My time living in Toronto in end of 2013-2014 was the first time I listened to Midnight Memories. The songs in the album to me give me chills and nostalgia. I've been remembering these things. And I think the album was set to give people this feeling.
One of my guitar playing memories was that John Mayer's "Neon" was extremely difficult for me.
Just to make sure I haven't blown my vocal cords or anything along that line:		https://t.co/sLcW5WV96P https://t.co/LHqiVSsRsh

I sing "One Thing" by One Direction generally on C, since the original is sometimes too high for me. However, there were days where I can hit the original key very well. Anyway, I know "One Thing" like the back of my hand.		I plan on practicing "Little Things" again (on repeat!). https://t.co/gDgy6PghDb
So I've quit taking lessons at KBL. Superior Singing Method is much better.
Place to stay in Belfast booked.
I requested someone to mail my letter to John Mayer, and handed it over to her yesterday. She was able to have it mailed today.
Repost:		https://t.co/bpwqwDs8s8
Each. I heard that opera and classical singers do vocal exercises and/or sing for something like 5 or more hours a day. Probably the same with other high caliber singers as well. https://t.co/Mqe0Rf12Xl
I've just finished writing another letter to John Mayer. Yay! I plan on mailing it tomorrow.
I have completed Superior Singing Method yesterday (delayed two lessons last week). I am excited about learning more from the site and getting more out of the exercises.
Actually, "on the move" is more accurate than "moving". https://t.co/7TSYgGrEQw
Just a thought: singing songs is not difficult, once you master the songs. The thing is you gotta know the lyrics first. You might know the tunes, but if you don't know the lyrics, you're only part way there, I guess.
The recorded videos totaled to about an hour and a half. I took a 20-minute eating break around half time. https://t.co/bsnJMoMSrJ
11 more songs done, with a total of 23 songs. Yay! https://t.co/QZxxFkFJ0c
I've just sung 12 songs in a row straight from my own memory. All in the span of about 45 minutes. Although I have to add that a bunch of the songs are only about 70-90% complete (meaning there are some words that I forgot). However, a couple of the songs should be 100% complete.
I've just sung 12 songs in a row coming straight from my own memory. All in the span of about 45 minutes. Yay! More to go...
Now that I'm more efficient with my vocal warm ups/exercises, I can actually focus more on singing actual songs again.
I just got done with watching "One Direction: Where We Are - The Concert Film" (and the Exclusive Backstage bonus content "The Road to San Siro"). I got chills at the starts of "Little Black Dress" and "Right Now".		I remember that exciting feeling again. The lads are inspiring.
Sooner or later I was gonna watch it anyway. https://t.co/7TSYgGrEQw
Before I watch the DVD, I just wanna say something real quick.		Lately I've been in constant moving, doing, and working, with little breaks every now and then. I feel at times that I'm almost emotionally exhausted. I'm taking a break now by watching this DVD. See you soon!
https://t.co/KVxU7ApKNi
Now I'm watching it on my computer instead... Well, I've been to the real thing anyway so it's not that big of a deal.
I was just about to play the "One Direction: Where We Are - The Concert Film" DVD that I bought in the UK in our home theater but the DVD player seems to be half working. I'm pretty disappointed at that since I've been waiting to watch it on the 12-something-speakers system.
Our flight route is Jakarta - London - Belfast - London - Jakarta. https://t.co/Bi244TyFAw
Email confirmation, etc. https://t.co/bGU435aqHg
I had gotten confirmations as well. https://t.co/Q5dl2yyHfp
Also, it turns out that I can actually eat something first in the morning before any vocal warm ups. That's really awesome, because now I can actually concentrate much better during the warm ups/exercises. Lol!
On Superior Vocal Health pdf, I also just recently read that the vocal warm ups shouldn't go on longer than 30 minutes. The strange thing is that some of the exercises have some rhythm changes, which made me think that being precise was very important. https://t.co/GIqnceof0c
Different types of visas. I have been fully aware of those.
Off to see The Avengers: Infinity War!
We can, of course, still use the visas to go to Dublin within 3 months. Yay! https://t.co/0wwWrRr7qA
Tickets to Belfast purchased.
100 times per song. OK!
We've been planning for our trip, and hopefully we'll finalize it today and purchased our flights to Belfast.
We received our passports yesterday with the valid UK and Ireland visas in them.
So the visas for Dublin might be of no use then. Maybe we'll do some traveling there or something, if we have the time for it.
We will get out passports back today with the approved visas in them.		However, our destinations will be changed, to Belfast around the second week of May. Belfast, here we come again!
Matt Wertz is one of my favorite male singers of all time. His voice is just so perfect for the genre. Another one of my favorite male singers is David Tao, although so far in my life, I haven't purposely listened to anything other than pop, classicals, or any similar music.
I tried to play the guitar of "5:19" and barely managed. "Everything's Right" was even tougher, really tough, in fact. And then I kinda gave up playing the guitar not long afterwards. https://t.co/oF7S01fNhZ
The first time I heard about Matt Wertz was back in 2008 on a stranger's MySpace. I think the person was Indonesian who lived in Indonesia but might've previously lived in the US. The song was "5:19", which is also one of my favorites of his but the ones I mentioned are the best. https://t.co/q0hgjSxwRs
On Superior Singing Method (particularly Superior Vocal Health), belting is concluded as bad. But in KBL, I was taught that. Maybe I need to tell my KBL coach that. The good thing is I don't do belting that much when singing generally.
I also love his cover of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". I know it's not December yet, but hey, it's not wrong to listen to Christmas songs anytime of the year, is it? https://t.co/q0hgjSxwRs
I wrote the first page of the second letter I am sending to John Mayer. My typewriter is just not the best typewriter in the world; I made several mistakes using it. In order to get things perfect, I would have to type very slowly. Hopefully, I can get it done this afternoon.
A lot of times, when singing karaoke, you just don't want the session to stop. When I go to karaoke with my friends, a lot of times we would extend to another one or two more hours and it would get to like four hours. Singing can be addictive once you get it going. https://t.co/bJ1Gny5quI
My most favorite Matt Wertz songs are "I Just Realized", "Easier Tonight", "Christmas Just Ain't Christmas (Without You)", "Wake up, Wake Up", and "Christmas Just Does This to Me". https://t.co/aQUVNEisNB
The steaks in these restaurants are so juicy and super, super tasty.
If only we have these restaurants here in Jakarta, me and my small group friends would definitely go there a lot.
(and since when did Cheddar's change their name to Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen??)		My favorite meals in these two places are the ones with steaks in them. And Cheddar's has literally the best croissants that I have ever tasted so far in my life. Buttery croissants, though.
https://t.co/OColEmcpdO		https://t.co/jqGvd8g50J		These are two of the best places to eat in when I lived in Texas (there maybe other locations as well that have them). And in Texas there are just tons of awesome food places.	https://t.co/Y8wzwDVD9Z	https://t.co/Y8wzwDVD9Z
My agent checked with the Embassy who deals with our visas, and found out that the visas might be issued this Friday.
I've finally got a friend of mine (he lives in the US) to buy me Matt Wertz's "Unexpected Love" (the Stripped version on https://t.co/5Fp474pYJd). It is more acoustic than the original version. I can say that I like it better than the original. https://t.co/PGYtc9s5WQ
In the past, in multiple occasions I tried to find an a capella group or club that I could join, such as on Meetup, but to no avail.
He couldn't use his credit card, either, because he has a Canadian one. I guess it has to be a US credit card. https://t.co/h7OPBldZUK
I've been trying to reach out to people that I know that live in the US. Most of them I haven't contacted in a while. I know, I'm not good at keeping long distance relationships I guess. Anyway, I've been getting little responses so far...
I went to karaoke a lot when living in Boston (the place there was called Do Re Mi). Since then, I've mostly been singing on my own in my room/car. And here, my friends and I would go to karaoke sometimes. Also, my fam and I would sing at home with our own karaoke system.
Repost:		https://t.co/A509o8yF3O
(and my memories aren't that bad)
Throwback: living in Boston, I went once to what might've been the Boston Symphony Orchestra (it was near Copley Square); also once to a small piano concert in a kind of a lounge. These and the other ones I mentioned before were the only musical showing "concerts" that I went to.
Most days, I do about 4 hours of vocal exercises, incl. the 8-week course of Superior Singing Method (just finished Week 7). Some days when I had to do other things, I omitted some of the other exercises, but still totaled to ~4 hours (incl. repeating any exercise as necessary).
This past week, in one day (on Wednesday), I did a personal record breaking of 6 hours of vocal exercises, including my vocal lesson at KBL. Maybe a little too much. But anyway, I did all the vocal lessons that I mentioned in a previous post, up to Month 3 of Vocal Coaching Club.
I have decided to continue my freelance endeavors here or start a business, instead of looking for a job abroad.
https://t.co/ZqBarOuA3o
Are stir fried meals categorized as fried? Well, it's kinda hard to avoid that type of meals. Maybe it's ok to have them every once in a while.
We still haven't heard any news from the embassy about the visas. Hopefully next week we will.
Despite my average college and university records, I was a high achieving student prior to college. In Aussie, I was top of the class in my high school, although my OP was 3 (where 1 is the best).
I just tried to turn my PC on again, and it's surprisingly back on (I switched to my MacBook Pro in the interim). Not sure what the problem was. Is there such thing as a temporary power supply issue? Anyway, that was the first time this happened in the year or so I had this PC.
It turns out that I might not have to replace the tape of my brand new typewriter, but could just rotate it. However, certain letters such as 'p' and 'q' are cut off no matter how hard I pressed on the keys. This would do for now, I guess. https://t.co/SeQTLkj6Ep

I tried to apply for a job abroad this past year and got 1 interview last year, with no further response from the company. I lightly got back into applying recently and also got 1 interview with no response so far.
I have never smoked a cigarette or a cigar in my life. The only thing I have smoked was shisha and that was only once. That being said, Jakarta is a very polluted place, which hopefully has not affected my health that much.
My desktop PC hasn't been working since yesterday (Sunday) morning after a power outage. Every time I try to turn it on, it would show the blue light for like 10 seconds while making the electronic and fan noises, and then it would turn itself off. It would repeat all these.

Depending on certain things, our flights to Dublin might be rerouted. Or cancelled if they don't allow rerouting, in which case we would just purchase another set of tickets.
Much like coffee, I don't generally drink soda. I also don't usually drink alcohol. It's been a while since I drank these.
I have been cutting down on spicy foods, and sugary snacks. The foods that I eat are generally not too salty or too fatty. It seems that all proteins are fine, from reading articles, so that's good. 😁

Who misses Westlife? I wish they're still together. I was a big fan of them and owned their first three albums. However, to this day, I still somehow haven't listened to their last three albums. I've only listened to a few songs from those albums. More good stuffs to listen to!
I plan on drinking more and more of peppermint tea and other herbal teas.
In my diet for the past couple of weeks, I have been avoiding chocolate, coffee (I drank coffee very rarely to begin with), and dairy products. And this year I have been avoiding fried foods to improve my vocals and also for general health reasons.
My dad's credit card doesn't work, either, to purchase things on https://t.co/5Fp474pYJd. I verified this with the bank that issued his credit card.
I just remember another concert that I went to, which was a Don Moen one in Jakarta (a long time ago). However, that one was probably more like a Praise &amp; Worship event.		Similarly, last year, I went to a Hillsong College one.
Some of my Facebook fan pages got unliked for unknown reasons. This happened to me a couple of times. It's a bug on Facebook. Come on Mark Z.! Check out this forum:		https://t.co/9WFmyf8arf		I apologize to anyone whom pages I initially liked then got unliked.
If our UK visas (which are still valid until around July) took about three full (regular, non-working) weeks from the time our passports left our hands until we receive them back, the visas to Dublin should take half the time. UK visas 15 working days; to Dublin 8 working days.
Woke up at 6:40 AM. Yes! I can keep this up consistently.
Repost:		https://t.co/A509o8yF3O
The visa applications to go to Dublin should only take 8 days for approvals. This is because we already have UK visas.
I never had the privilege to go the concerts of John Mayer, Michael Bublé, U2, Michelle Branch, etc. They are great artists that I admire and respect a lot. They just didn't happen to visit the towns that I lived in when I was there. Hopefully, someday, I can see them perform.
I enjoyed the 1D concert a lot. Huge party. Didn't want it to end. Harry Styles and the other boys were there for us.		However, at Matt Wertz and Dave Barnes concerts, they really entertained us from the very beginning to the very end. Really great! They were just so much fun!
Concerts I went to as an audience:	1. Matt Wertz (twice; once in mid 2009 in College Station when I attended Texas A&amp;M University; another in Austin, TX, and it was in 2011 I think)	2. Dave Barnes (once in Austin; also in 2011 I think)	3. One Direction (Toronto, August 2014)
https://t.co/DaLGp8eSTn
In all of my life so far, I have only been to four concerts (apart from the one for an elementary school project, in which our own school held a concert, back in early or mid 90's; I remember that it was really cool and I was part of the team that played the "angklung").
https://t.co/byasV8CflA
The thing about thinking TOO much is that when I start thinking about complicated things, I forgot OTHER important things that are... significant. If anyone is affected adversely by this behavior of mine, I apologize.		I keep improving and improving.
Flights to Dublin purchased. Hotel in Dublin booked. Documents for our visas (to go to Dublin) to be handed out tomorrow morning (I asked the agent and the courier that). Should be no problem at all.

I have been absent-minded a lot, though, as of late. However, I have been getting better and better. I apologize to anyone whom my absent-mindedness causes any error to.
And today I woke up at 7 AM with about 8 hours of sleep. Are 8 hours and 15 minutes the optimal amount of sleep per night, or does it depend on the REM cycle for each person? Anyway, I have been waking up with pretty much no effort, and without any alarm clock.
Then, it got better to waking up at 8 or so AM, and now the past four days I have been waking up at around 7 AM, 6:50 AM, around 5-6 AM (I didn't look at the clock right after waking up), and 5:45 AM, respectively.
I have been waking really early for the past month. Last year I would wake up at around 10 AM, although at some rare times I would wake up at around 5 AM. About a month and a half ago, my severe jet lags let me sleeping at 4-5 AM and waking up at noon-1 PM.

It just doesn't seem that I can make a purchase on https://t.co/5Fp474pYJd with my current credit card. I called again the bank that issued my credit card, and the representative said that everything on my card is fine. I will call the bank that issued my dad's credit card. https://t.co/tRBuBtezf9
My vocal exercises regime looks like this (totaling about 4 hours, repeats included for accurate tones):		* Superior Singing Method Course (done with Week 5; 3 more weeks to go!)	* Superior High Notes	* Superior Mix	* Superior Vocal Agility	* Vocal Coaching Club Month 1 and 2
I have been doing Superior Vocal Agility starting from a few days ago.
I was also inaccurate with the other History class, the one at Bunker Hill Community College. The semester was Summer Session I 2002 (instead of Fall 2001 or Spring 2002). It was US History I with a B- grade. https://t.co/VsV02ZloFL
OK, I was inaccurate because my memory failed me again. I took two other classes (instead of just one other) in Spring 2006, and none of them was online.		ECE 397 was an independent research class, if I remember correctly. ECE 445 was in a lab and I had two project mates. https://t.co/1UaffnyVIS

I have been thinking about the point in time in which I became a born-again Christian. I grew up going to Sunday schools and went to Christian schools pre-college, and would learn about Jesus in school, but maybe, I became born again when I got really, really close to the Lord.
Oh, and I would need to go back to Jeremiah and Isaiah and the last few chapters of Ezekiel because I skimmed those.
In October 2015, I started reading the New Testament and finished it last year (I am a slow reader I know, but I didn't just like skim the Bible). Then, I picked up where I left off from high school, which was, of course, the book of Proverbs.
My Bible reading progress: finished the book of Amos yesterday (read the last two chapters). On to finishing the Old Testament (and thus the entire Bible). I read Genesis to Psalms (that's almost exactly half of the Bible) in high school in Australia (about 20 years ago).
Have been preparing to apply for visas to go to Dublin. Planned to have the documents given out early next week.

I forgot to mention that the History class that I took at the University of Illinois was the only class that I've ever failed at during my entire academic career.		Also, to be more accurate, that year could be called my super senior year instead of my senior year.
That was in my first or second semester at Bunker Hill Community College (Fall 2001 or Spring 2002).
Prior to the story below, I took a Modern History class (IIRC after World War II) at the community college that I transferred from (to University of Illinois), which I got a B+ IIRC. But the teacher would yell loudly at us, the students, frequently. He might've had anger issues.
Came senior year, I had a really bad senioritis. I failed my History class (IIRC Modern History, can't remember if it was before or after World War II). Not surprising because I only came to class three times that semester (Spring 2006). The only other class I took was online.
I have always remembered my alma mater, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I just miss that place so much (along with other places in North America that I've lived in, but this one is special in a different way). I enjoyed the campus a whole lot and the student life.
I'm pretty sure that holding on to the past is not a good thing. However, remembering fond places/things/people that you've encountered can be a good thing.
It could also be that the AC in my room sort of froze the tapes in the typewriter...
It may not be very apparent in this picture, but by the third draft of my letter that I sent to John Mayer (I sent him my second), the ink just faded away significantly. Maybe new typewriters need to have their tapes replaced right away. https://t.co/UuSFv3Z7wg
It turned out that my parents' credit cards didn't work, either. Called Amazon, who said they'd need a US credit card for purchases on https://t.co/5Fp474pYJd. The bank here said that they might be able to activate the cards for purchases in US sites. I'll call again for this.
Superior Mix lessons are all done.		I've also done Vocal Club Coaching exercises Month 1. Thinking about doing Month 2 after just about a week of Month 1, because Month 2 and 3 have been unlocked (similarly with Month 3).		Will repeat all these regularly.
Planning on buying this Matt Wertz's song soon:		https://t.co/Q8dWtkGnbv … …		Since I can't use my credit card to make a purchase on Amazon, I will ask my dad if he'll let me use his.
Superior High Notes lessons all done today! Will do them on a regular basis.
My vocal coach at KBL said that my vocal range is E2 to C#5, with A#4 as the note where I sing the most powerful.
Trying to make a purchase online using my credit card here, but it wouldn't let me...
It turns out that there are a bunch of Toastmasters clubs located in Jakarta (thinking about joining one...):		https://t.co/mr82GWJGaW
My checkups in Singapore around the middle of last year showed that I should be in a close to perfect health condition. I even checked for sinuses, and the X-Ray results showed that I had a very, very tiny sinus which was pretty much negligible.

Or I think my coach meant that my lowest note is E2, while my optimal note is A#4. Then I'm not sure what my highest note is. I'm gonna ask him that.
It turns out that vocal range is E2 to A#4, according to my vocal coach at KBL. However, my voice is still shaky when singing the higher notes.
Now I'm only taking 1 vocal class per week at KBL.
I just finished the middle of Week 3 of Superior Singing Method. The exercises are a lot of fun to me. I bought a bunch of their products, too, and have been thinking about getting ahead of the structured 8 week course.		I restarted Week 1 Module 1 several times, hence the delay.
BBQ. Salt Lick BBQ?
Talking about Jakarta traffic. When I said a nearby Post Office, it wasn't like a super nearby one. I think that each of the times I went there, it took me at least half an hour to get there with the traffic.
I've finally sent my letter to John Mayer. There doesn't seem to be a way to include return mails from this country. But just in case, I provided a couple of stamps from the post office. The letter should arrive in about a week.		My first celebrity fan mail! Yay!!!
To send a letter to John Mayer, I went to a nearby Post Office yesterday to get a PO Box, but it was already closed. I'm going to try again on Monday.

By the way, I should have gotten the typewriter sooner, but I have been so swamped for like the past couple of months. Also, people were telling me that it would be hard to find typewriters these days (albeit brand new ones), and indeed there weren't that many. Anyway, I got one.
I just got a typewriter today. With this, I'm going to write a letter to John Mayer. 😀 https://t.co/OQO0k9kTte
It's been a great visit so far. My visa lasts six months, so I can always visit again anytime soon.
Second day in Belfast. https://t.co/C1bFNsQm0K
Acquiring a typewriter is harder than I thought. Being an obsolete device, the stores that claim to sell them that I found online don't even answer my phone. I'm going to have to put this search on hold until I get back from my trip.

Flights to Belfast for around the middle of next month purchased!
Around the end of last year, I became a CTO (of a startup) for only about a day and two hours.
One of the biggest lessons I've learned from my mistakes these past few years is that I tended to think too much, which was not good. This past week seems to be a turning point, a breakthrough in this area for me. Here comes the new me!
I have been getting some awesome help by my vocal coach at KBL. For real life vocal coaching, ironically this one is better than the one that I had 8 years ago in Texas in which I had to pay a much higher tuition (where I had to learn nasality, which didn't suit my style at all).
My vocal coach at KBL said a couple of times that I'm best at the higher notes, at around A# (if I remember correctly). Because at around this note, my voice sounds full. This is the opposite of what I thought before; I thought I was best at deep notes.
I'm looking into getting a type writer. I really want to get one within the next day or two (if possible).
Our UK visas have been approved. Yay!!
No news on the UK visas yet. Maybe next week we'll hear about them. There shouldn't be a reason we wouldn't get approved.
One Direction is my favorite band. I just love their songs, so much fun and "otherworldly".		Here's what practicing their songs looks like given the time that I have had:		https://t.co/A509o8yF3O
Waiting for our UK visas that we submitted the applications for about 2 weeks ago. We should hear about the results next week.
I've just purchased a few packages containing a bunch of programs from https://t.co/PsHHcUa9AC   . They should help me a lot with improving my singing, along with the vocal lessons that I'm currently taking at KBL (which are 3 times a week).
First vocal lesson at KBL today! https://t.co/WKKfgfZ8lu
https://t.co/fbCd0I2hJp		It has been almost three months since I tried this particular method on a daily basis, and the result has been tremendous for me (with a couple other singing exercises).		Thinking about training with a real life vocal coach again (piano and guitar, too?).
My very first Tweet in a long time.		It just occurred to me yesterday that it'd be cool to start tweeting again.
