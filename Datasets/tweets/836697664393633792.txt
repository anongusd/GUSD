After reading and editing the post by Chef McCardle, I will admit- he has hit the nail atop the head regarding a very difficult to discuss topic: the United States’ history of broken treaties.
Like it or not, Kim Jong Un is smart enough to know the history of United States foreign policy, both with the Native Americans and with Middle Eastern dictators to know that if he gives up his nukes he is committing a fatal mistake https://t.co/GXcSDAhjdF

The German people did not accept euthanasia at first but as propaganda told them it would conserve resources and redirect them to where they could better serve the people of the country, they gradually embraced what would become the Holocaust https://t.co/vCw0OapOoW
The TV drama, ‘The Passage,’ demonstrates just how far governments are willing to go in the joint names of medical science and of conserving resources, which is why we must fight against infanticide NOW https://t.co/B7JbOFkfrU
Instead of abortion being- in Bill Clinton’s words- ‘safe, legal, and rare,’ it now seems to be the number one method of ‘birth control,’ especially among Democrats, something I simply cannot support https://t.co/A5uIitt9cH

Dictatorships take control of education and health care as in doing so, they control both the family from cradle to grave and its young through indoctrinating and instilling them with the party line https://t.co/uJ4TbKegPj
To save the country and the planet, the American people must first regain control of the educational system because teaching kids their planet is going to end in ten-twelve years is beyond the pale https://t.co/ZV9cr2O9sE
Perhaps the Democrats should fund the border wall as once their Green New Deal goes into being, they will have to fight to keep the American people IN rather than keeping illegal aliens OUT https://t.co/EvrAjDFxMm

@PPFA I sure would like to know why we shed blood as a nation defeating Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan?  Both did brutal things, crimes against humanity but somehow it is okay to butcher children not only in the womb but now on the birthing table and then sell body parts.
@kathy tran virginia - when did murdering BIRTHED children become acceptable?  When did abortions in the second and third trimesters become OK?  When Planned Parenthood discovered they could make the BIG BUCKS on the sale of fetal body parts.  Why did we fight the Nazis again?
@TheJuanWilliams Here is some food for thought, Mr. Williams: in this time of 'income inequality,' let us imagine that if employers did not have the opportunity to hire illegal aliens, well, wages would go UP, benefits would be better, &amp; people would not fear $500 bills.  Simple.

@realDonaldTrump FUND the wall by slapping taxes on all outbound remunerations of $$$ south of the border.  Tax them at 90-percent.  @AOC thinks 70% rates are good, put them to 90-95% on all outbound money to Central America &amp; Mexico.  When they sneak $ over border, confiscate!!!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, please send DHS or FBI agents to staff jails in California in sanctuary states and cities.  If laws prohibit cooperation with ICE, lets see scumbags such as @GavinNewsom pass laws prohibiting cooperation with DHS, FBI, or ATF.  Time to break backs.
Botox @SpeakerPelosi stop crying about cancellation of your excursion.  You seek to stab @realDonaldTrump in the back as you sought to do to GWB.  This is what Dems do, they undermine GOP presidents.  Here at AICP-END Blog, we NEVER forget traitorous behavior like yours. Shame. https://t.co/JDaXCelEDF
@SpeakerPelosi Botox Nancy, how about getting off your flat duff and bargaining with @realDonaldTrump so we can build the wall.  Does it require an illegal alien POS doing some horrible thing to one of your grand-babies before you open your slumbering eyes and work on behalf of American people?
So, @AOC wants to 'run train' on her left-wing, Marxist agenda, seems like maybe someone should consider 'running train' on her and her fellow far-left loony tunes losers.  @TheDemocrats think they won BIG victory in 2018; no, they won because of GOP retirements by losers.
@realDonaldTrump  Mr. President, send ICE to California en masse to force "The Smiler" @GavinNewsom to stop sanctuary cities.  Use RICO charges against all politicians in all sanctuary cities and states to break their backs &amp; to send them to prison where they belong. Liberate us!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, the best way to bring Botox @SpeakerPelosi  and Crying @SenSchumer to the bargaining table is to begin immediate round-up and deportation of ALL DREAMERS.  Deport ALL of them.  Also, to get around ICE in the jails, have DHS act as intermediaries.

@SenSchumer &amp; @SpeakerPelosi Build the wall and deport them all.  You could have saved the Dreamers but you chose not to, which means you do not care about the people you claim to love so much.

@SenGillibrand wah, wah, wah.  We hope you continue acting crazy, that you continue inciting the ignorant and the stupid to do violent and insane things because every time you flap your gums, we add more Democrats who find you and your followers appalling./  Why not shut the f up
@RealDonaldTrump- During Algerian War, the French had effective border control with Tunisia what with minefields, gun emplacements, fast reaction forces, and electrified fencing.  No one bitched about what France did, why can we not replicate some of it.  Save USA!
@RealDonaldTrump- how about pardoning Border Patrol agents Ramos and Compean who were unfairly persecuted for shooting a fleeing drug dealer in the ass and then covering up the scene.  We need to make border area a free fire zone and light up all illegals seeking to cross it.
Rod J. Rosenstein  REVENGE on Jim Jordan continues as more claim the congressman ignored their complaints.  Boohoo, you are in college and allow yourselves to be molested by a perv doctor?  Please! Anyone ever been in a locker room and seen what goes on there? Lots of grab-ass.
@JohnBrennan- it used to be when coup plotters failed in a coup d’ êtat against a leader they fell on their sword.  When are YOU going to fall on yours, you failed communist POS?  Time to account for your crimes, will Lisa Page or Peter Strzok flip on YOU?  We can only hope!
As patriotic Americans, we must demand that our elected leaders do what is right and that is if Rod J. Rosenstein will not behave in the expected way, the Congress must remove him from his post https://t.co/Lt5LabgIr5
I enumerate six steps to reclaiming our nation from the Democrats and their noncitizen allies including informing the new Mexican dictator that unless he halts his nation being a thoroughfare for illegal aliens the bombing will commence in 20 minutes https://t.co/0f00olSGov

If @DEMOCRATS want us to care about illegal alien kids, how about funding the wall?  The wall would solve problems as would cutting off all remittances to Mexico.  We must teach Mexico a BIG lesson so let us tax outgoing money by 95-percent or more? Break Mexico’s back ASAP! https://t.co/Zr8cTai6fA
The American people must stand up and support ICE so we can defend nation from barbarism.  The invaders will not assimilate so why should we care about unaccompanied minors or those with families until border wall is built.  #Buildthewallanddeportthemall!
As our numbers continue to rise, so, too, does the interference of Google Blogger, which does everything it can to shadow ban us so people cannot read the truth.  We pay for our Web addresses but the scum do everything they can to prevent us from appearing.  We will email posts!
Google Blogger ghost bans our blog. You can see it by immediately clicking on web address and doing a fast ‘save as’ onto your computer.  You might need to do this 2-3 times to freeze page because they attempt to stifle our free speech although they gladly take our money. Fight!
@POTUS most of the American people support you, the Silent Majority is live and well and God give us strength in November as we are going to mop the floor with @DEMOCRATS.  They stand for everything Un-American whereas we stand for the truth, for light.
Funny how @DEMOCRATS are always on wrong side of history.  They stood for slavery, Jim Crow, separate but equal, lynchings, the KKK, violence against blacks, Latinos, Jews, Catholics, and immigrants.  Look at them go now, standing strong for illegal aliens their modern-day slaves
In CA, @DEMOCRATS in form of @GovJerryBrown and @AGBecerra seek to defend their slave state by fighting the federal gov’t.  Sounds like the days leading up to the outbreak of the Civil War which did not go well for last slave-holding parts of the country.  Beat them in November.
@DEMOCRATS still hope for prophesied BLUE WAVE; well, a RED TIDAL WAVE is heading their way and if things go well here in California, we will have Republicans running the show.  We need all the help we can get to boot out the illegal aliens, will you help us?
At one time @DEMOCRATS stood for closed borders, the American worker, and now in the post-Age of Obama, they want to destroy the country by opening borders, giving jobs to illegals, forcing higher taxes onto the American people.  How can we allow this to continue? Stand up, fight
The time is now for the American people to declare that we, the Silent Majority, do not intend to allow the LEFT to hijack our government.  What Rod J. Rosenstein is doing to @Jim_Jordan is a crime and is something ALL patriots must fight. For evil to triumph, good must be silent
The ‘Revenge of Rod J. Rosenstein’ on Congressman Jim Jordan (and anyone else seeking to take him out) is well underway- accuse him of knowledge of sex crimes against young men and remaining silent https://t.co/SwV6SdSEWj

This Friday at the @AICP_END_BLOG we will have a post outing what is obvious to most Americans and that is Rod J. Rosenstein and his fellow conspirators in ruining those seeking answers to questions and the removal of a lawfully-elected American president.  We must stop them!
The time for Americans to stand up and say NO MORE to the Deep State denizens is now, on this July 4th, 2018.  The Founders would be appalled at how nefarious denizens of the Deep State attempt to impose control against those seeking oversight of their hidden activities.  USA!
If anyone requires proof of the Deep State and its nefarious designs against the American people, look at Rod Rosenstein and the SUDDEN appearance of allegations against @Jim_Jordan with one of two things that can destroy or silence a person- knowledge of sex crimes or activities
Friends, it would appear that the Revenge of Rod J. Rosenstein and the Deep State against Representative @Jim_Jordan is under way.  We do not believe the accusations against Mr. Jordan and funny how a week after getting slammed, this 'info' comes out in an attempt to hurt.

@chuckwoolery Ok, time to outlaw shotguns, @Democrats!  Take them away, get a registry on everyone who owns a shotgun, and do what you always do when a crazed leftist or an Islamist goes out and shoots up a bunch of people.  So pitiful, so sad.
@thehill Arrest them, lock them up, the stupid skanks.  They are too stupid to understand that the current immigration policies have been in place for more than 16 years and the Dems ONLY care because it is @POTUS in charge and not little Barack Hussein.  Until we get border wall, boohoo.
@StinkBug111 will be in Monday and he is going to lambaste the @TheDemocrats over how their OPEN BORDERS policy is going to cause more non-Latino Dems to go down in smoking defeat as numbers of illegal aliens continues to grow in blue states and sanctuary cities and states. Woe!

@NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer and begin deporting the mess you made back to whence they came as otherwise, as illegals fill up the sanctuary cities near you, when one of their own arises, you stupid white Democrats will be shown the door.  This is your Frankenstein monster, fix it
@NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer too big to fail and look at him, blown out by a political novice from socialist Puerto Rico.  If you two are smart, you will recognize your errors, help fund the border wall, demand a resumption of the 1950's era immigration plan, Operation Wetback...
@NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer, this is the law of the jungle and it will happen to you.  As more and more Third World illegals fill our towns and cities, they will cast elected Democrats aside and will go with people who resemble them.  Joe Crowley screwed up by thinking he was...

American people!  Stand up and fight the invasion of Third World garbage flowing across the southern border.  #Buildthewallanddeportthemall!  Build the wall using outbound remittances on way to Mexico.  Crush Mexican economy by seizing their money and cartel monies.  Save USA now
@POTUS we need prison camps a la what Sheriff Joe had in the desert, only on the North Slope of Alaska.  We have our own Siberia and we need to make sure all illegal aliens know they are going to the freezer of the USA once they cross the borders and are apprehended. Save USA!
@POTUS we need a round-the-clock air fleet to take back ALL illegals once they cross our borders.  This may be costly at first but how many times can illegal aliens raise the $$$ to come to the USA?  At some point, it will break their backs just as building border defenses will.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS time to tax all outbound remittances by 90-95-percent, which will cause millions of illegals to self-deport as well as deter future waves of illegals from coming.  it also will force criminal Mexico to fund the border wall and will collapse their economy.

@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, #Buildthewallanddeportthemall!  We must save our country from being overrun by people who will never assimilate and join us in the American Dream.  Instead, they rape, rob, and steal and drive wages down.  Wages will go up once the illegals vanish!

Thanks @POTUS for strong stand on the border, most of us will vote for GOP in Nov. and for you in 2020.  Time has come for USA to tell Mexico ‘you are with us or you are against us, so get your butts off the crapper and help us stop the illegals.’  Otherwise, they are YOUR prob!
@POTUS- how about taxing all money sent outside the country at 80-90-percent?  This would stop most illegals from coming or staying here.  Time to re-fire the Old Operation Wetback used by Presidents Truman and Eisenhower to deport 95-percent of ALL illegal aliens.
A little napalm dropped on the illegal alien caravan might cause them to think twice.  I would send SEALS and RANGERS south of the border to light the illegals up and make it look like the cartels or crooked Mexican cops did it.  We must fight fire with fire and do it ASAP.
We want @POTUS to do whatever is necessary, even occupying a part of northern Mexico and putting in minefields, booby traps, entrenchments, gun emplacements, and hundreds of thousands of troops.  Throw back the invaders and any who make it through, LOCK ‘EM UP on North Slope, AS
@POTUS thank you for sending US militar to southern border to stop the vanguard of the invasion force.  Our country must begin fighting back against Mexico as that criminal nation could care less about the havoc caused in our country by the people they allow to cross the border.
CA growing angrier by the day with SB 54 and the BS on sanctuary state status.  Nearly a million or more CA in growing coalition to aid FEDS in fingering and removing illegal aliens much to the chagrin of @GovJerryBrown &amp; @AGBecerra.  @POTUS send us the resources to make CA RED!
@POTUS please support GOP gubernatorial candidate John Cox in his bid to wipe the floor of CA with @THEDEMOCRATs criminals raping our state through flooding it with illegals. Use RICO against @GovJerryBrown same way feds did w/ similar criminal John Gotti.
@POTUS please send ICE agents to CA prior to June primary election and again in November so we can drive the illegals out of the polling places thus denying @GovJerryBrown &amp; @AGBecerra their win.  Deport them all build the wall &amp; lock up scumbags.
We think it is great that truth re: climate change-global warming is coming out.  Everyone knows it is the new way to redirect gullible people to democratic-communism because who can resist the urge to ‘save the planet’ and to have kids inform on parents’ disbelief in phony crap.
@THEDEMOCRATS whine that @POTUS no longer will deal with DACA, which is great.  The Dems do not care about illegal alien kids, other than that they are pawns in a game seeking the acquisition of power.  Dems care about no one other than themselves.  Sorry DACA kids.
@NPR Gotta be a Democrat.  @TheDemocrats use all sorts of chicanery to get more votes, why are they going after high schoolers like David Hogg?  They need a fresh supply of meat to do their bidding.  Well, no more, the people of the USA want to boot out ALL liberal scumbags ASAP!
So, David Hogg, the creature of George Soros won’t take apology of Laura Ingram?  Well, screw him, the little leftist punk thinks he has POWER, which he does not, he will end up like Cindy Sheehan &amp; all the rest of the leftist ‘heroes,’ true believers who end up in garbage bin.
When CA goes RED in Nov, will @POTUS hit @GovJerryBrown &amp; @AGBecerra with RICO charges &amp; put the corrupt un-dynamic duo in Leavenworth where they belong?  No more SB 54, no more cooperation w/ state authorities as we hand over illegals to ICE and Border Patrol. Make CA RED again!
The Dems think they are smart placing ballot measures on Nov. ballot in CA, thinking big Dem turnout but strategy is going to bite them on ass as this fall, MASSIVE coalition of Dems-GOP-independents joining to WIPE OUT ruling class. No more sanctuary state, no more scumbags!

@POTUS please hit @GovJerryBrown &amp; @AGBecerra with RICO lawsuits as they run a criminal conspiracy and enterprise in CA.  They pocket millions of dollars from high-speed rail, union pension funds, and wherever else the crooked schemers can enrich themselves at taxpayer expense.
Message to all illegal aliens begging for sanctuary status protections, it is not going to work, self-deportation is the best bet to keep families intact.  All known illegals in CA will be fingered to federal authorities for round up and deportation.  @POTUS liberate CA now!
Kern County CA, time for us to join in lawsuit against criminals @GovJerryBrown &amp; @AGBecerra.  Time to fight these two anti-federal government illegal-alien loving POS.  We need to flip state from BLUE to RED in November &amp; chances look better of doing every day.
@POTUS, please liberate CA from the stranglehold placed upon it by the evil Dems notably @GovJerryBrown &amp; @AGBecerra.  March these 2 scumbags into federal prison &amp; save us from illegal alien occupation force.  God bless ALL fighting @DEMOCRAT despotism.
@POTUS Illegals in CA crying, begging for more protections, something we want to deny them because we want to move them out. CA has decriminalized most felonies so now we have to fight off hordes of criminals and noncitizens robbing our mailboxes, cars, and persons. HELP!
@POTUS keep up ICE enforcement in CA, more citizens are FOR you than AGAINST you.  We want the criminals and illegals moved out so we can flip our state from BLUE to RED in November, something looking better by the day thanks to outrage over SB 54 bullshit.
Fellow Californians, we have prayed for the tide to turn and it is turning.  SB 54 is the issue that is going to motivate millions of Californians to go to the polls in June and again in November and begin voting out ALL Democrats. To them, noncitizens are more important than us!
@TheOnion Poor Mark Zuckerberg, maybe he is going to prison for selling information to highest bidder.  @POTUS, time for the AG to launch trust-busting efforts against ALL social media platforms as they cooperate with dictators, thugs, and criminal nations.  Stop the madness, jail Zuck!
Why are @AGBecerra and @GovJerryBrown so afraid of asking citizenship on 2020 census?  What do we have to hide if ALL citizens are legal?  They are afraid of fact that we have at least 10.5 million illegals in CA, which means more illegals control state than citizens. Lock ‘em up
Hey, @AGBecerra, if you &amp; your boss @GovJerryBrown want us to love illegal aliens, how about declaring CA a sanctuary from state and federal taxes and then fighting @POTUS on that one?  Oh, you won’t do it, you POS, you want to raise taxes &amp; fees to help the illegal aliens? Wow!
https://t.co/Ofozfzaay1		If Beverly were still alive, she would approve of what Chef Elvin says, he hates the Democrats in Sacramento and wants to send a tidal wave their way in November.  We must join in eradicating them like Orkin eradicates cockroaches and other pests. https://t.co/hQA9U9XlSg
@GovJerryBrown &amp; @AGBecerra are new leaders of BLUE Confederacy who want to secede from Union to protect modern-day slaves, aka illegal aliens; they raise their kids, mow their lawns, do their shopping, clean their houses &amp; most importantly go to polling place &amp; vote @DEMOCRATS. https://t.co/T59Y48e6Tq
@POTUS stand strong on 2020 Census requiring illegals to identify themselves.  In 1964 @SCOTUS ruled in Westbury v. Sanders it is illegal to dilute citizen votes using illegal aliens and others unable to vote in elections.  Time to deport ALL illegals, including DREAMERS now.
CA new slave state.  @DEMOCRATS fight to protect illegal aliens like their brethren did prior to and during Civil War to keep slaves.  They talk ‘secession,’ which sounds amazingly similar to what Jefferson Davis &amp; other Southern Dems did to keep them- liberate thru deportation. https://t.co/cQEvkLXVLF
Cesar Vargas, first illegal alien lawyer in NY State must be deported with his illegal alien family.  We must stop birthright citizenship for all brats born to illegals in the country.  @POTUS, we must find a way to make sure all illegal alien births in the USA remain illegal. https://t.co/3NHfCVDnhD
@POTUS please send ICE to arrest Cesar Vargas, first illegal alien lawyer in NY state. We are tired of seeing him on Fox New lecturing Americans on what Constitution says.  We want to see him thrown onto an ICE bus and then sent back to Mexico ASAP.  Save the country. https://t.co/cIuVNxw7S6
@POTUS build the wall &amp; deport them all.  Do it starting in CA and make @GovJerryBrown &amp; AG Xavier Becerra watch it go up, then send them to prison ASAP.  We want our state back and we want the 10.5 million illegals living here sent back to their countries.
Kern County, join Orange County in fighting back against criminal Xavier Becerra and his bullshit law.  We want illegal aliens deported, we want criminal Dem leadership sent to prison.  We will cooperate with ICE and finger every known illegal alien to them for deportation.
@POTUS time to increase heat on CA Dem criminals running state like personal fiefdom.  Hit them with RICO lawsuits, stop them from enriching themselves &amp; their friends via HSR.  We want liberation, we want @GovJerryBrown &amp; his AG Xavier Becerra in prison.  Save us!
Congrats to armed resource agent in Baltimore school who shot school shooter seeking to do harm to his fellow students.  This is how it is done, armed resources do not hide outside the school awaiting the arrival of SWAT.  They enter, do the job, save the students and all go home
GOP, do your duty, help @POTUS with his agenda.  The Stormy Daniels story is classic diversionary tactics by Trump. We think she is doing his bidding to pull attention in HER direction while @POTUS does his thing.  How stupid are the media, @DEMOCRATS and the RINOS?  Very stupid!
Oh woe, if @POTUS fires Robert Mueller III.  Look, Rod J. Rosenstein should fire Bob Mueller as there is no crime, no parameters in which to conduct the investigation and it is a witch hunt as Trump says.  If this was happening to @POTUS44, @DEMOCRATS would be wailing like whores
https://t.co/h7ekuB098D	El balancín está enojado que nuestra nación se encuentra en el desorden es y que @POTUS44 pensó que podía salirse con aparejo una elección presidencial a su sucesor en el cargo y para encubrir sus crímenes. Esto nunca puede suceder de nuevo, bloqueo de él!
So much crying about Andrew McCabe, well he picked the wrong horse in 2016 Presidential Election and participated in the ongoing, potential coup d’ êtat against @POTUS.  @DEMOCRATS expect big BLUE WAVE; ain’t gonna happen, BIG RED ONE coming instead.
Alas, @DEMOCRATS are angry with Facebook since @POTUS used their data mining for his campaign.  When Little @POTUS44 did it, everyone clapped like circus seals whereas now, it is bad, evil, and Marky Zuckerberg needs to undergo an ass-whooping.  Dems, shut the hell up and go away
@paulkrugman Well, it was never going to be you, you leftist, Marx-loving POS.  All you guys who sit on the sidelines moaning and bitching make us sick.  We want solid economic advisers untainted by Obamist politics aiding @POTUS.  Never a goon like you.
@CNNPolitics What a load of crap.  The Mueller investigation needs to end as it is an illegal investigation. No crime to seek, no parameters set, it is time for the Supreme Court to do what AG Jeff Sessions will not do and that is to restore an air of legality to all @TheJusticeDept business.
https://t.co/O99o1Cl7Rm Chilote dice la terminación del Rex Tillerson es "no big deal", que si @POTUS44 habían disparado dimwit John F. Kerry o torcidas Hillary, los medios de comunicación no habría bateó una pestaña. Dice @Los demócratas deben dejar de actuar como tuercas.
Voters of Pennsylvania, we hope you choose Rick Saccone to take the Congressional seat and not Conor Lamm.  @POTUS needs all hands on deck and as long as @NancyPelosi remains in the House, every DEM will ALWAYS vote her way if they want campaign funds.
https://t.co/B4exjaIllF El Chilote-valiente alma democrática que se dice de los Dems tienen un tablón en su plataforma, el odio para @POTUS. Esto no es suficiente para ganar a lo grande en noviembre ni en 2020, 2022, o 2024. Dice @TheDemocrats deben volver a la vieja plataforma
AG Jeff Sessions, how about a RICO suit against CA @DEMOCRATS who will not enforce the law.  We want @GovJerryBrown and the rest of his scum administration taken to federal prison.  How about liberating CA from the leftist CPUSA takeover of the nation’s best state?
What is wrong with these liberals in that they are so childish and immature?  No wonder they lost in 2016, just like @HillaryClinton whining about white folks not voting @TheDemocrats why is that?  Because the Dems have pushed them away, plain and simple.  Get help you losers.
https://t.co/YtNJRJSQPa	Just when one thinks he/she has heard it all, we hear yet another example of liberalism run amok.  Jill Abramson, former NYT bigwig must carry an Obama doll in her purse so that she can remind herself that things are ‘not as dark as they seem.’  Seek help
@CNNPolitics Is the media and @DEMOCRATS that frigging stupid not to understand that @POTUS is going to run circles around little Kim Jong Un?  Every time they doubt the Pres, they end up taking up the poop chute, so many stupid media hacks and political scum, no wonder the Pres kicking ass.
Wow, @POTUS going to meet with Kim Jong Un, that is something @POTUS44 could never have done.  He liked unimportant dictators such as Raul Castro and Hugo Chavez, what a loser, what a schmutz like his intelligence folks, Clapper and Brennan, all stupid.
@USATODAY Adam Schiff is a fucking nut.  This man is an embarrassment to the Congress and to the state of California.  Impeach @RepAdamSchiff NOW!
CA new slave state of 21st century just like the Old South. How soon before Dixie becomes favorite song of Sacramento Democrats?  Don’t want to cut their slaves lose, willing to go to war against the federal government sort of sounds like 1860 and the election of Lincoln.  HELP!
Time for California to split into TWO states- let the communists have the west side and leave the northern and east sides for the conservatives, the people who make the state work.  The Dems can have Sodom and Gomorrah of modern times- San Francisco- their illegals and their gays
@GovJerryBrown people in CA are ready to DEFY your bullshit laws and begin pointing out illegal aliens and cooperating with federal authorities.  You do not have the power to stop the people and we are sick and tired of you and scum bums such as Xavier Becerra.  Make CA RED 2018!
@POTUS please liberate CA from the communist scum running us in Sacramento.  We need liberation, so we can return to being a RED state.  Deport ALL frigging illegal aliens, we are ready to aid the federal government in pointing the POS out to ICE agents.  We are the underground.
@POTUS- time to federalize the CA Nat’l Guard to provide protection to ICE agents as they round up the illegal aliens destroying our state.  The people of CA want help from the feds because we want to round up the seditious leadership ruining our state. @GovJerryBrown needs to go
https://t.co/0aTbw4LHQK Everyone is shocked at how evil the American Left has become in its attempt to remove a president who won honestly.
Poor @maddow found her face full of feculence following the disastrous Tuesday night disclosure of @POTUS tax returns.  She wears it well!
https://t.co/33GZojiY7m Obamacare is a disaster and here is why- El Chilote, a Democrat goes after members of his own sad party.
@Newsweek God bless him, he wants to reclaim Denmark from the Muslims as we hope someone in the USA will as well as deport illegals ASAP!!!
https://t.co/8pshp5TR6e Hector says the Dems must stop drinking the Obama Kool-Aid as Obama destroyed our party and let us with nothing.
https://t.co/pOcGgaM2DZ Moderate Democrat El Chilote comes in today to do his week &amp; is curious about the crazy shit going on in the country
@KTLA Keep these people out. Liberals like lambs being led to Muslim slaughter, you cannot help these people, will treat us like dhimmis.
Time to have the waitresses go make the chefs some sandwiches and bring us some beer in the main kitchen.  God bless em for being good help.
@weneverlie @thedailybeast @MaxineWaters she is as stupid as that fool Hank Johnson who thinks Guam will capsize with more USN sailors.
@BigTexasSkyBlue @ABC @POTUS We need the prez to save CA by punishing crooked state gov, deport the illegals overflowing in the state, Help!
@BigTexasSkyBlue @ABC @POTUS Fed law says we cannot hire illegals while state law says we HAVE to hire illegals or face fines.  Bull crap.
@BigTexasSkyBlue @ABC @POTUS Only thing @JerryBrownGov won't let illegals do is to sit on juries but wait until we get Gavin Newsom in!
@BigTexasSkyBlue @ABC @POTUS because our CA governor has allowed it. They can practice law here, get in-state tuition, they vote food stamps
@CNN East Anglia University emails prove that Climate Change is what most think--a steaming pile of buffalo crap.  Enough with the claptrap!
@CNN @BernieSanders hey, sell-out, far more likely Obama tapping Trump than Russians throwing election. Complain how DNC buggered you.
@ABC Don't want replacement, want total repeal &amp; want illegal aliens removed from health insurance rolls. Keep your word, @POTUS, free us!
@RepHanabusa @WhipHoyer Sorry, we never wanted Obamacare and do not want it now. Let free market work, get rid of illegal aliens ASAP.
to all leftists- climate change is a load of crap. Read East Anglia University emails, shows how deep the scam goes. Scientists lie to get $
@strosie232 @politico Leftists believe big gov is the cure for everything. Cure is allowing each state to makes its own choices, not lefties
@strosie232 @politico sorry, environment was under repair before Nixon made EPA. EPA oversteps its original boundaries, which is not right.
Sad women got fired yesterday for not showing up to work but it is what it is. If you want to work in our restaurants, show up, no protests!
@strosie232 @politico Been alive long time. Used to be bout combating polution and conservation, now it is about control. You favor BIG GOV
@politico climate change is a big scam, no significant warming in nearly 20 years yet Leftists continue whining as they want to control us.
@CNN Nothing wrong with nationalism, especially after globalism &amp; liberalism have trashed the country. Make America Great Again NOW! No libs
@CNN why does anyone listen to this loser? He &amp; wife biggest crooks around &amp; since losing election, they have nothing to say whatsoever.
Time to begin investigations of Hillary, Obama, and all of their ilk who tried to steal the election. Obama embeds dangerous to country.
CA needs to stop HSR soon and put money to water reclamation, dam building, take money from programs for illegal aliens, start deporting!
@realDonaldTrump Please save CA, help us go RED again. Prosecute crooked state gov't officials like @JerryBrownGov &amp; others robbing us daily
@thedailybeast @MaxineWaters would be lucky if someone even considered this hag for a sex tape. The Left ALWAYS lies, that is what they do.
@POTUS needs to do something about corruption in CA. Won't fix dams, money goes to HSR boondoggle, a bigger scam no one has seen. Help CA!
We here at the AICP-END Bog suspect that @POTUS is correct when he says the @POTUS44 embeds were spying on the Trump campaign. Diabolical!
@RMConservative and yes, here in CA, illegal aliens get Obamacare and all the other goodies thanks to Dems and @JerryBrownGov, a bum.
@RMConservative No Obamacare, no Trump care, repeal the crap and toss it out, let the free market cut loose and things will work out.
@JackPosobiec ...the tourists- 'you can smell 'em so it must be summer or tourist season' or some nasty crap such as that.  Glad he's gone.
@JackPosobiec it is always great when presidents step out and greet the folks unlike nasty little Harry Reid who said hateful stuff bout the
@USATODAY Of course, because most Americans do not buy into the intolerance that the tolerant Left loves to promote. Time for butt-kicking!
@Newsweek we bet daddy must be so proud of his dimwitted son.  What other tricks do these losers have in store for the American people?
Reply to @Newsweek I bet he is so proud, most liberals are...
@Newsweek lets start sending the illegal aliens to live there, they can colonize it, we can reclaim the United States from Mexico soon!
@CNN Not about cheap labor, about the Reconquista, giving by default the SW back to Mexico. Happened to Western Roman Empire, happening 2 US
@CNN In 1970s, illegals worked the fields, a few in kitchens. Now, they frame and roof houses, plumb, do electrical work, drive trucks, STOP
@Endoracrat @CNNPolitics Usually, the ones tossing the names such as the libs are the ones who are true anti-Semites like the guy arrested..
@CNNPolitics We wonder if they made their husbands sandwiches?  Some among us believe Melania would not as wouldn't Hillary but others might
@HeigelAgnes @CNNPolitics why get him out, he is what we need to fix the country so let us let him do it. Enough with the sniveling, crying!
Watched Jorge Ramos on Tucker Carlson, what a pig, sucks having to listen to illegal alien tell us what USA MUST do. Load of crap deport him
@CNNPolitics When in God's name are we going to vote this hag out of office. Pelosi is an embarrassment to CA but we guess it could be worse
@WSJ The Russians? Naw, most likely the CIA using Umbrage to hack and crash things just to see if they can do it.  The country has problems.
@seanhannity @newtgingrich think we need a rebirth of the House Un-American Activities Committee to delve into the hidden leftists. Go Trump
@CNNPolitics liberals always oppose military spending failing to realize strong military deters the dictators the Left always seems to love.
@Newsweek saw this on History Channel, show about "High Hitler," showing how the troops used high-powered stimulants.  What else is new?
El Chilote comes in Monday and has much to say about 'women's march/day w/o women' in his own unique way.  A liberal Latino Dem, read him.
@StinkBug111 Yo, bro, love what you said.  Most at blog feel the same way, thanks libs for showing us WHO YOUR ARE so we can fire y'all.
https://t.co/BbAMPspiwL great post today by Cherry regarding unknown entities causing problems for the blog.  We suspect leftist spies....

@WSJ People have the right to read whatever they want so snivelers need to shut up and leave people alone. F**K group think and the like.
One visits CA, one sees destitution surrounding pockets of wealth. In the 1980s and before, CA was #1 state whereas now, we are ghetto state
Illegal alien invasion and promotion of promiscuity drives up VD numbers across Kern County.  Time @JerryBrownGov did right thing- deport!
Thanks to Obamacare, syphilis is UP BIG in Kern County because ACA promotes indiscriminate sex and gobs of illegals boning hos in county.
Enough w/ commercials in CA promoting ACA for illegal aliens. NO Obamacare for illegals, depot them all, reclaim the state, make CA RED 2018
if you want to see corruption, look at California @TheDemocrats because they are biggest crooks in the country. Yee, Wright, Calderon, scum!
@POTUS time to reclaim CA from @TheDemocrats &amp; their illegal alien allies.  We can go RED in 2018 if we deport the illegals, Dems will lose.
@JerryBrownGov HSR meant only to fund labor unions, labor thugs, crooks, and criminals and to bear your worthless name. Save water not union
@JerryBrownGov maybe if you hand illegal aliens over to ICE, @POTUS will give you some money to put HSR from Madeira to Bakersfield.  NO HSR
@JerryBrownGov HSR is dead, put money to water storage, to deporting illegal aliens, to making California great again instead of hellhole.
@EdWorkforce @HouseGOP Cherry put her kids out at age 18, wanted them to grow up, which they did thanks to her. Do not keep kids on til 26!
@EdWorkforce @HouseGOP hey, throw kids off their parents' insurance plans at age 18. Cuz we do not make em grow up is why Millennials suck.
@latimes Indentured Irish and British servants came here first and most of them died before they worked off their 20 years. Slaves followed.

Curious about scumbag FBI caught attacking Jewish sites.  Somehow, I suspect that this is MORE leftist probs as it smacks of their playbook.
Gotta love @TheDemocrats in meltdown mode as they try to destroy @POTUS when the Pres has 'em by the balls.  Keep it up, 2018 coming soon!
https://t.co/1lBr4hZCBx Democrats have problem of their own creation, need Night of the Long Knives to remove the heads of street thugs ASAP
https://t.co/GmEndzup8I- Dems have a Frankenstein monster, one they need to behead ASAP.  Hence a need for a Night of the Long Knives &amp; now
Just found out that illegal aliens getting WIC here in CA.  When are we going to deport the illegals? They are draining the resources fast.
The libs are out there attacking @POTUS, how pathetic is Michael Moore, Bill Maher, Rosie O'Donnell, and the rest of the flipping losers.

@TheDemocrats need to stop whining because if anyone has responsibility for @POTUS, it is YOU and your hero, @POTUS44! Trump will save us!
@ringostarrmusic Ringo, how about bringing All-Starr Band to Fox Theater in Bakersfield, CA, we would love to see you rocking it soon!
@KTLA Someone needs to begin rounding up all of the subversives living in the country.  Hate to say it but the Dems responsible for jihadis.
When will @TheDemocrats cut the head off the Frankenstein monster they created through using Soros $ to fund nuts to do their dirty work.
Thought Hollywood punks believed in Global Warming &amp; Climate Change bull crap, how phony but how true.  Losers live in their own world, sad.
Just heard the Leonardo Di Caprio and George Clooney flew Aussie eyebrow stylist 7,500 miles to Hollywood prior to Oscars to do faces...more
@realDonaldChimp @realDonaldTrump Yeah, Chimp, know that but fuck semantics.  Easier to say that than dressing down of damned Democrats.
Back in 1960s, illegals worked in fields, now they work everywhere. @JerryBrownGov lets them work everywhere, they can even practice law! NO
@latimes BIG FLIP- the Dems will rob whatever pools of money exist to fund HSR and to give resources to illegal aliens whom they love.  NO $
California can become the Golden State once again, meaning bright RED but illegals must go, quit depriving citizens of resources. Send ICE!
Seems the Dems are still frothing at the mouth over the SOTU address by @POTUS last night &amp; hope deportation of illegals begins soon in CA!
@IngrahamAngle It was a great speech, no doubt about it and a sign of good things to come.  Stay tuned for more @POTUS because it is great!
@michellemalkin Trump did one hell of a job hitting a grand slam tonight.  We have to give him all of the support that we can as he needs it
@SenSchumer Enough, Sen. Schumer, give the man a chance, we gave @POTUS44 eight years to do something for the middle class and ZERO, ZIP!
@debbiesoto69  I wouldn't brag, Debbie, you are not looking so hot either. Dems losing Senate in 2018 elections, GOP going to have 62 seats!
Merit-based immigration makes sense. We do not need impoverished ppl coming here who need the government to help them, we need geniuses.
@realDonaldChimp @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump What a speech, @POTUS hit a grand slam out of the flipping ballpark &amp; Dems KNOW it! Yeah!
@POTUS is going to fix our country and it behooves the Dems to get on board and work with him. A GREAT economy will win over 99% of the ppl.
Congrats to @POTUS for doing what @POTUS44 could not do and that is call the enemy of civilization 'radical Islamic terror.'  We cheer you!
Time to dismantle Obamacare, not because it belongs to Obama but because it sucks.  20 million love it, 310 million do not, replace not fix.
It wa hard for the @TheDemocrats NOT to stand and cheer for @POTUS tonight because the man was phenomenal.  Work w/ him &amp; not against him!
@POTUS knocked it out of the ballpark tonight with his amazing SOTU address.  The man has vision, is presidential, and most of us back him.
@POTUS easy thing to do is to legalize illegals but that won't make America great again, keep wages down, crime up, drugs on streets, deport
We hope that @POTUS is going to deport ALL illegals and Dreamers, too. Illegals keep wages depressed, once ag workers, now do everything.
@WV_TN_DEM @paulkrugman The 'ban' originally was a product of Barack Hussein Obama, good enough for him, then good enough for me. What u say
@marklevinshow Yes, and it is NOT Trumpists, it is the Democrats, the Brown Shirts, this is what they do, cannot win so use violence- scum!
@WhipHoyer what a load of crap.  Too much sniveling, what are Dems going to do for the people of the country instead of spouting bulls**t?
@paulkrugman Yeah, blame Trump for everything.  Krugman, you have not learned the error of your leftist ways but we hope you do someday...
