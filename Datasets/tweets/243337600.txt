@LindseyGrahamSC So Graham's not being inconsistent here when he now says he'd support Trump issuing a state of emergency to build the wall. All I'm saying is, he reached his conclusion in a very short amount of time.
@LindseyGrahamSC "At the end of the day, I don‚Äôt know this bears fruit statutorily. I‚Äôm a pretty hawkish guy when it comes to the powers of the commander-in-chief."
@LindseyGrahamSC ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I would do. I‚Äôm open minded to it being a crisis. The statute is pretty clear that you have to have congressional buy-in. Some people worry about he precedent you set on our side (of the aisle)."
THREAD: This is what @LindseyGrahamSC had to say earlier today on issuing a state of emergency to build the wall:
A few hours ago Graham was telling reporters he wasn't entirely sure how he'd side on Trump declaring a state of emergency to build the wall. I guess he's given it some thought.. https://t.co/g3g01xynZk

But many of you have asked me, "where's Graham in all this action?" Here's what he was doing last time: https://t.co/wTIvGjQLil END THREAD
It's not clear to me at this point whether Graham was, or is still, quietly working behind the scenes, or if this just isn't a fight he's investing a lot of time and energy in.
Graham told me today he was "talking to a lot of people" about this DACA/wall money trade-off, and he also planned to reach out to the "Freedom Caucus guys," who are "a lot more reasonable than people give them credit for."
Meanwhile, Graham has been very quiet during this shutdown debate. He's preoccupied with Trump's plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. He is battling a cold. But the last time the government lurched towards a shutdown, Graham was in the thick of the action.
It's pretty clear, though, that no one is seriously talking about DACA for border wall money at this point to avoid a shutdown. Democrats and Republicans alike feel burned that they might have had a deal on this earlier this year, and things fell apart, and THAT caused a shutdown
THREAD: Hours ago, @LindseyGrahamSC was telling me about how he was "dumbfounded" there were not more serious discussions about offering a permanent DACA fix for border wall money: "I think (Trump's) open to a DACA fix, I really do."

Most of the time, that's correct. But Scott was the deciding vote, so if he had voted against cloture, he would have just killed the Farr nomination right then and there. And Scott wasn't ready to sink it completely. https://t.co/VjYQiHUod8
These questions were not directed at me but I can answer #2: Scott had not yet decided whether he was going to vote for Farr or not. Voting "yes" on cloture bought him more time to deliberate.

After the vote was called, Graham was among the Senators to came over to speak to both women. Sadly do not know how to lip read.
Susan Collins, seated next to Murkowski, eventually leaned over to talk to her. The two shared a moment where they talked quietly and laughed. Collins will announce her decision on the final confirmation vote at 3.
Inside the Senate chamber, it's hard to overstate just how dramatic Murkowski's "no" vote was. She barely moved her mouth or made a sound. She kept her head down after she voted. The gravity of that moment did not seem lost on her.

@igorbobic Another thing to remember about Graham, which makes him all the more complex (again, not a psychoanalyst): Part of his #brand is being bipartisan, but at the end of the day he is fiercely conservative and a party loyalist on the Hill.
End of thread for now. May be more later. About to go into a metro tunnel.
I'm not in a position to psychoanalyze Graham -- or anyone. But his obsession with these two votes, and him bringing them up constantly, suggests to me he's deeply hurt that he took a risk years back and Dems won't extend the same courtesy.
So it's deeply personal for Graham. He feels he took a big risk in voting for Kagan + Sotomayor. Granted Dems might argue they're taking a bigger risk now voting for Kavanaugh given allegations but Graham still sees himself as someone who should be a model for bipartisan fairness
Andrew King, a former Graham aide, said it like this: "Here‚Äôs a guy who feels he has put himself out there on behalf of the judiciary, keeping the judiciary sacrosanct, making sure these hearings are about qualifications and not about anything more and he‚Äôs been excoriated" in SC
But it's more than that. Graham risked political blowback, as he always has, for siding with Democrats -- with the larger GOP base and most important with the base back home.
He keeps talking about how he voted for Sotomayor and Kagan, Democratic nominees for SCOTUS. For him, that Dems wouldn't consider voting for Kavanaugh prior to the allegations wasn't just a matter of fairness, ie one should be able to put aside party and vote for a qualified nom.

Here is Graham doing an interview, followed by protesters https://t.co/RavJAp3UkZ
.@LindseyGrahamSC also says he has spoken to the White House and Trump about Kavanaugh as he's gone out to defend the nominee on conservative media.
.@LindseyGrahamSC told me he will NOT be asking Ford questions at the hearing but MAY ask questions of Kavanaugh if he feels Democrats are getting political and he wants to fight back.
Pro-Ford activists hounded @LindseyGrahamSC thru the halls today on his way to the hearing, screaming in his face "shame," "you hate women," "look at my sign." Signs read "I believe Christine" and "I believe survivors, no on Kavanaugh." He ignored them as he spoke to reporters. https://t.co/c2x5FLmAhy

@SopanDeb Yes. But remember, Graham also helped manage the Clinton impeachment proceedings. He has shown in the past he's as political as they come. I'm just saying, while I agree the turn of events have been surprising and even bizarre, Graham is acting consistent with past behavior.
Also, Graham might be "moderate" on immigration and like working with Democrats but he has ALWAYS been a conservative Republican who wants to keep getting reelected. https://t.co/xqAcjOqff7

Graham: if DACA codification is Democrats' price for getting more funding for the military "I'll take it."
Interesting -- just like Graham said Trump's sudden rejection of bipartisan immigration deal was due to bad advice from staff, also calls Trump's treatment of terror suspects "a staff problem."
Why can Trump get it done? Graham says one reason is the president "has credibility with the right no one else does," so when he says the border is secure people will believe him. https://t.co/dZrvvC7Kkq

Is it unusual that the DHS Secretary would not have met with a single DACA recipient? Honestly asking here.

Nielson also suggested she was scandalized by the use of profanity in the Oval Office, in front of the president
Amy Klobuchar is calling it "s-hole," which I think sounds worse than "shithole" TBH.
