Everyone should know: 	- The FEMA inspector will show a photo ID badge.	- If you are not shown photo ID, then do not allow the inspection.	- If you suspect someone is posing as a FEMA inspector, call your local law enforcement agency.
Once homeowners register with the FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency, a FEMA housing inspector will call to schedule an inspection. Here’s what survivors need to know about the inspection process: https://t.co/XLIL2flQkt

That should get you past the error message concerning street addresses in the .@fema application process.
You will get an error page, but it's okay. There will be a "Corrected Address" and a "Submitted Address."		DO NOT CLICK "RESUBMIT" under "Corrected Address"		Rather, click "Use Submitted" under "Submitted Address" https://t.co/3mAAmU7O3T
When you start applying online at https://t.co/uPJZ2QiI0g, you will eventually get to the page where they ask about your street address. Here, you will enter:		LOT + # + street name spelled out + village name.		It is not case sensitive; all text entered is all caps. https://t.co/IlIGOK02wY
First, you must find your Lot Number. You can go to https://t.co/ORW9uSqbVl to find your lot number. Your lot number, village, and street name are what are important to retrieve here.
Many still have questions about how to enter their address when applying at https://t.co/uPJZ2QiI0g. .@FEMA requires a street address, but we have a system of lot numbers in the Marianas. So we'd like to walk you through the process in this thread.

FEMA wants to remind us to not venture outside until told that it is safe to do so by local officials.		In the current weather conditions, it isn’t safe. If you must leave your home due to a life-threatening situation, your best option is to go to your closest fire station.
As of 8pm, the storm's closest to Saipan, at about 85 miles southeast of the island and about 90 miles southeast of Tinian.		Maximum sustained winds of 165 mph. The storm is moving north-northwest at 12mph.		Stay safe, Marianas.
Typhoon Condition 1 remains in effect for Saipan, Tinian and Rota. Tropical Storm Condition 1 is in effect for Alamagan, Pagan and Agrihan.		Typhoon conditions expected to persist through the evening into late Thursday morning.
Post offices on Saipan and Rota will be closed during Super Typhoon Yutu and will remain closed until further notice.
