@brandi_love breakfast club is an all time classic for any generation approaching that coming of age timeframe. To me, it was 90s films like Clerks. Clerks was life changing for me. As was Mallrats. It spoke about home to me.

@indiewrestling hey guys. For some reason I have two subscriptions that I‚Äôm charged for but both of my accounts have inactive/canceled status. I opened a ticket over a month and a half ago. I need to get this resolved. Please help?
@SeanRossSapp hearing from ‚Äúdirt sheets‚Äù that Ambrose is being advertised for post ‚ÄòMania events. So, maybe it wasnt a ‚Äúwork‚Äù then, but is he staying now?

Since everyone swears this Ambrose thing isn‚Äôt a work, The Shield needs a proper send off. None of this brother betrayal nonsense. Those 3 have pretty much BEEN the WWE since December 2012. #SierraHotelIndiaEchoLimaDelta #BelieveThat #BurnItDown #LunaticFringe https://t.co/7WOxZsA891

. @KyleBusch and @KBMteam are the elite when it comes to @NASCAR_Trucks. 52 wins all time for Rowdy. He might not have 7 championships or 200 Wins, but he is pure talent.
@jrzgrl1963 When your attitude is ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this for 30 years...‚Äù to a group of kids...you‚Äôre part of the problem. The reason we‚Äôre in this climate mess is bc of career politicians who ‚Äúknow what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù.
