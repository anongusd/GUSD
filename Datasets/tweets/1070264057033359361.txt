And on top of that...and again, I'm sure if you used your brain you probably could've figured this out, a sex crime by a person of Latin American origin doesn't mean "90 illegal aliens committed 500 sex crimes in a month"...ya know what, nvm. You're clearly too dumb to learn.
Since @Profitigation can't use their brain, I'll just go ahead and let them know that simply because a person's name isn't "Tom Jones" or "Bob Smith" or whatever other boring ass name you think of, doesn't mean they're illegal aliens.

Sadly though, America is no better. We have no room to judge anybody. This path can be changed, but as of now, #USA is not any morale judge of the world.
The #USA has zero morale authority to wield on the geopolitical platform. Day after day we hear how "Americans are an exceptional people...we are better than the tyrants that destroy the world..."
Let's look a few years back to when we were all made aware of the @CIA torture report. How can any American still feel any form of morale superiority after reading that? The horrible and cruel things that were done...
But, let's assume that the world would be willing to forgive the USA for the past...let's look more current...
We have murdered Native Americans. We have participated in the enslavement of a vast number of people. We have destroyed the lives of millions on the other side of the planet.
The USA had morale credibility long ago. We had a heart for helping. But we lost all morale standing in the world.
Just a thought here that I see bouncing around. The general attitude seems to be "If we bail on the Kurds, we lose our morale standing".   Here's the thing...
