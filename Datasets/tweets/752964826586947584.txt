It‚Äôs even more important that Nevada take steps to protect every woman in the state and have the first positive, proactive conversation around abortion access in the states‚Äô legislative history.
As outside forces continue to try and take Nevada backward, the Trust Nevada Women Act will help keep Nevada moving forward.
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs imperative that Nevada state legislators support the ‚ÄúTrust Nevada Women Act.‚Äù This legislation removes outdated barriers and cleans up antiquated laws long blocked by the courts.
Fact: National protections under Roe v. Wade are more precarious than they have been in 45 years.
Fact: Nevada is 1 of 9 states with protections for abortion in our state law. Thanks to 64% of voters in 1990.
Now, more than ever, states are the defense to protect our repro freedom. That‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt wait to bring folks up to Carson City to talk to our legislators about how we can affirm Nevadans pro-choice values. #TNWA

.@AdamLaxalt has made restricting #reprofreedom for Nevadans his #1 priority in recent weeks. Enough is enough - that's why NARAL Nevada members are outside his Las Vegas &amp; Reno offices right now to demand he back off our bodily autonomy &amp; #reprorights. Enough is enough! https://t.co/DoAtSikwQ6
That's why we mobilized quickly to collect hundreds of letters from concerned voters. #7in10 Nevadans support a woman's right to choose. We are here to remind Laxalt just how out-of-touch he is, show that we are paying attention, and demand he STOP attacking #reprofreedom for all
Laxalt did all of this in just 3 weeks. Imagine the damage he could inflict on our #reprofreedom and #reprorights if he's elected #NVGov? It's frightening and we won't stand for it.
