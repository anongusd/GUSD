@MCBTVe If you are at an address that is a distance away from the service line, the construction work would be needed to run the line so we can provide service. We pick up the bulk of the cost rest would be up to you. We also have promos always available for you to take advantage. -Marc
@SoSillyDaddy1 Leaving us seems 'so silly.' Jokes aside, we hate hearing that you wanted to leave us in the first place! Let us know if there is anything we can do to help. -Tim

@CaraS425 That is a good standard expectation, but various factors (environmental, building construction, etc) that can change the distance a hotspot can reach. I do suggest downloading the app or checking your WiFi settings to see if you can connect. -Christine

@Jeanem1 Just a heads up while you are reevaluating, that all TV providers must engage in these types of negotiations from time to time. Losing the ability to FF through advertisements is a realistic possibility with any choice. We hope you stay a part of the family! -Gabbie
@Jeanem1 Thanks for clarifying that. We constantly work with programming partners to prevent this, but some provide content with the full commercial advertising load + customers can't FF through those commercials. Your feedback matters as we work hard to bring more of what you love. -Gab

@spacecatiper Hey Brent. While speeds are üìà, data usage remains tied to your activity. While you may find with faster speeds comes more capacity, if your activity stays the same, you shouldn't see your data usage change. -Gabbie
@oveoblu Have you chatted with any of our Digital Care Agents to help you troubleshoot? Want to make sure that you're getting the services you're paying for. -Gabbie
