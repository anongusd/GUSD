@shastavince1 If you‚Äôre insinuating that she was suspended for being a liberal than we need to file a discrimination lawsuit agains the PUSD.
Sorry your itty bitty brain doesn‚Äôt have access to an AP Government course at your itty bitty school...üò¨ https://t.co/f5UlMw1rdQ
@shastavince1 Also bud, thank you for dodging all my questions bud. Thanks bud. Bye again bud.
@shastavince1 Well bud that‚Äôs where our opinions differ. Sorry bud but don‚Äôt you have school? Buddy why don‚Äôt we just pick this up later, ok bud? Bye bud.

@shastavince1 The 9th...?
@shastavince1 Planned Parenthood offers pills for $15 to $50. But if PP is defunded the price costs $200 to $600. So no I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs affordable.
@shastavince1 Do you think that condoms work 100% of the time? Also, what if it wasn‚Äôt consensual? What if it was marital rape?
@shastavince1 It‚Äôs unfortunate that people like you in this world want to take that right away.
@shastavince1 ...because in this day and age it sure as hell isnt logical. Women have the right to have sex as they please...
@shastavince1 So you‚Äôre saying your argument that women must remain abstinent if the gov won‚Äôt supply birth control isn‚Äôt narrow minded?
@shastavince1 If you don‚Äôt like what I tweet or don‚Äôt agree with something, fuck off and block me idgaf. But don‚Äôt waste my time w your dogmatic bullshit.
All of this could have been avoided in the first point of @shastavince1 would get the fuck of my mentions w his narrow minded rhetoric. https://t.co/qWtK4FXdtZ
