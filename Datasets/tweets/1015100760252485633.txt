@bhwms @michellemalkin The night after the failed vote the Parliamentarian said that because of certain clauses it needed 60.
@bhwms @michellemalkin Sure, but voting that way is exactly what got us Obamacare in the first place. Not to mention that the bill ended up needing 60 votes anyways bc of a procedural rule.
@bhwms @michellemalkin I respect your viewpoint, but I honestly don’t see his thumbs down as some endorsement of Obamacare. It needed repeal, but McCain didn’t believe that the bill was well-thought out enough, nor that massive health reform should be done behind closed doors and w/ 50+1 majority.

@Viking_SmithV @ExDemLatina @AZGOP @kelliwardaz Eh it’s more along the lines of Ducey not wanting to change tax code retroactively &amp; make new tax policy without revenue estimates. He doesn’t want to nor has he ever wanted to raise taxes.

@chrisherstam I think we both know that Ducey, Brno victories &amp; 127 failure would’ve happened regardless of any APS contributions. Most spending for all 3 campaigns came from separate interests, party, and individuals.
@chrisherstam For instance, take a look at the ACC race in 2018. None/little APS spending.
@chrisherstam Accusing the AZ Chamber of Commerce &amp; AZ GOP of money laundering is a mighty claim. Lobbying happens, and I think it’s ridiculous to claim that any donations have somehow made APS a puppet master.

A thread on the flaws of non-interventionism. Read it ⤵️ https://t.co/DqLG0XAc1h
We are the leader of the Free World — a “City on a Shining Hill” — and we must never forget our integral role in pursuing global peace.
The goal of our deployments must be peace — for ourselves, and for everyone. We must guard ourselves from foreign interference, &amp; our allies from foreign encroachment.
This is not to say that we must intervene everywhere, nor that we must wage constant war. There is a legitimate argument over all wars and conflicts, and we must ensure a forum for public debate over our deployments.
We now live in the times which Pres. Washington predicted, ones in which ”we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by justice shall counsel.”
Non-interventionists have great intentions — peace on Earth, American strength at home. Unfortunately, ignoring conflicts abroad does not eliminate them, it allows them to spread unfettered.
Even Pres. Jefferson (not a fan of intervention) authorized US participating in the Barbary Wars, working alongside Sweden &amp; Sicily to defeat the Barbary pirates &amp; clear the Mediterranean for trade. Even in 1801, our leaders recognized the interconnected nature of our world.
Information now travels at the speed of light. It takes one or two flights for anyone on the face of the Earth to reach our nation. It’s no longer enough to defend our shores — we have to work w/ our allies to neutralize threats abroad: for our sake, and humanity’s.
But are these not just issues for other nations to deal with? Why must we step in and neutrality threats? We no longer live in a world that moves at the pace of a schooner across the Atlantic.
Withdrawing from Syria, to start, will embolden ISIS (who, despite the President’s remarks, still has ~2,000 troops in Syria), expand Russian power in the region, &amp; threaten some of our allies (the Kurds, Israelis).
We do not live in a black-and-white, mercantilist, zero-sum world. We live in a world increasingly interconnected, a world in which we can no longer afford to mire in isolation. As the world moves forward, we must fight all urges to turn inwards &amp; lead our world forth.
Beyond President Washington, let us address the current state of affairs &amp; the non-interventionist solution. They applaud Pres. Trump’s withdrawal from Syria &amp; partial withdrawal from Afghanistan — w/ out acknowledging the side effects.
Washington acknowledged America’s rising strength, saying that it would mark a change in our foreign policy: “the period is not far off when we... may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by justice shall counsel.”
... Such an attachment of a small or weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter.” His concern was foreign influence and interference, not the sole idea of participating in the global arena.
And if you don’t take my word for it, here’s an excerpt from the same document (Washington’s Farewell): “many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the arts of seduc- tion, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils!...
Additionally, his warning was predicated on the premise that foreign entanglements would result in America being the less powerful participant in alliance. Now, with our enormous military and economic might, we are often an equal if not far superior military-economic power.
This idea, that we must cultivate ourselves independent of the rest of the world, has precedent. But, it’s also important to remember that Washington led a nation 10 years into it’s independence — weak and easily corrupted.
The core of their argument, harking back to the words of President George Washington, is that we should “steer clear of entangling alliances with any portion of the foreign world”.
This group (who, for ease of writing, we will call “non-interventionists”) has a lot of historical precedent. To name a few in recent historical memory:	• “America First” (30s &amp; 40s)	• “Peace in Vietnam” (60s &amp; 70s)	• “Peace in Iraq” (00s &amp; 10s)
To preface this thread, let’s be clear: isolationists, pacifists, libertarians, &amp; the likes are not ill-intentioned. They, like all of us, are working in the best interests of our nation, our citizens, and mankind-at-large.
For the past couple decades (&amp; arguably since our nation’s inception) there has been a faction within the United States advocating withdrawal from deployments abroad, isolation from allies &amp; foes, &amp; decreased military spending.
... and here is where the true colors of Sen. Paul’s libertarianism shine through: isolationism, ignorance, and an outdated “America First” ideology that actually puts foreign despots before human rights.		Boy do I wish @SenJohnMcCain were here to set him straight! https://t.co/ShvqThk8Nx
The idea that @RandPaul knows what’s best for our nation, the ppl/ of Syria, Iraq, &amp; Afghanistan, &amp; our nation’s national security strategy moreso than our generals — who’ve dedicated their lives to military service — is laughable. https://t.co/WR8aX6NWp7

@robeganAZ @JeffFlake Ok, then that’s a totally honest difference. We’ll see how it plays out.
@robeganAZ @JeffFlake Respectable view, but I don’t think Congress should ever pass legislation knowing it will be struck down. What is the point? If any?
@robeganAZ @JeffFlake My concern is primarily Constitutionality. I agree 100% that the investigation must go on, but I’m afraid that in this rush to protect the Counsel we are abandoning the very principles we wish to uphold.
In this sense, a bill written with the intent of upholding the Constitution and our institutional integrity chips away at some of its foundations. @JeffFlake, thank you for your vigilance and willingness to stand up for our country — but this isn’t the way to do it.
I, like most Americans, fully support the probe into foreign interference into our election. I also believe that it’s imperative that we maintain the independence of the investigation. But, while I appreciate the sentiment, the bill itself is unconstitutional.
I’ve got a ton of respect for @JeffFlake, but I’ve got to disagree on this one. The bill to protect Mueller’s investigation is not only pointless (POTUS won’t dare fire him), it’s unconstitutional (since when can an appointee appeal their firing? Fantasy).	https://t.co/Cnpk1iizU0

Reverence for America’s hallowed and respected institutions does not devalue dissent &amp; query — for the uniquely incorruptible nature of this nation’s institutions is derived from constant vigilance.		That being said, vigilance =/= baseless, politically motivated fictions.
As Americans, we pride ourselves in our incorruptible, recognized electoral &amp; institutional integrity. The delegitimization of results that will inevitably come after results are called in #AZSen, #FLSen, &amp; #FLGov must be fought by both sides.		So let’s get to counting.
@JeremyR1992 @JulieaQSmith @AP I agree insofar that there is no evidence whatsoever of voter fraud. We can all agree on a recount &amp; ensuring that all counties are counting all votes.
@JulieaQSmith @JeremyR1992 @AP I understand &amp; respect your viewpoint, but I think right now both extremes have it wrong. Counting all the votes is right and just, but the inefficiency/illegal actions of the Palm Beach &amp; Broward Elections offices warrants investigation. I agree in sentiment—COUNT ALL VOTES.
@JeremyR1992 @AP No one has ever called for not counting votes. The GOP position has always been count ALL the votes, and the FL Lt. Gov. backs up this sentiment. Recount is proper course of action, however it will probably not change the outcome of the races (Gov &amp; Sen).
@Ocasio2018 I cannot believe the bunk, Marxist idea of “late-stage capitalism” now has a voice in the House of Representatives. That being said, it’s inappropriate and insensitive to criticize public officials (such as yourself, at least -elect) on their financial situation.
Weathering a horrific shooting and now the worst wild fire in its long history, California stands strong. I am praying for the people of the Golden State, and call on the federal gov’t to mobilize FEMA and other resources to fight this monstrous blaze. God bless California!

Let’s be clear: there is a concerted effort by AZ &amp; FL Democrats to suppress votes and count ballots only until they favor Dem candidates.		Stand up for our elections and tell them that every vote matters—no matter how keen they are on engaging in voter suppression.
In both Florida and Arizona, there is a disgusting effort to count votes until the Democrats get the result they desire. This is despicable, and it is un-American. God forbid we confirm that a mail-in voter voted as their ballot said when their signatures don’t match. New low.

Thousands tragically died in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Maria, and it is our duty to recognize their loss and aid in their reconstruction.		Puerto Rico is not foreign land—it’s part of America—and we do a disservice to our founding principles through our inaction.
This confirmation allows all Americans a time of reflection—on our judicial system, on our partisanship, on our values—lest we allow political noise to supersede the foundations of our City on a Shining Hill.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that modern-day Supreme Court confirmation hearings have become a "highly partisan show."		"The way it was, was right," she said, referring to her own hearings in 1993 when, as a former lawyer for the ACLU, she was confirmed 96-3.		— via @CNN
"But as long as we're looking at our interests, or scoring points, or looking cute, or being on TV, especially the legal system, how do we maintain it?  If you can't debate hard issues honestly, with honor, with integrity, how do we keep a civil society?"	—Justice Thomas via @CNN

@theminorchords @KateDaGreat1111 @ComfortablySmug @kdeleon @SenFeinstein Yeah I’d rather have something along the lines of Medicare/Medicaid negotiating with private sector than Universal.
The people of Nicaragua, Venezuela, &amp; Colombia are being stripped of their basic human rights and subjected to horrific violence. The US must recognize that South America is also America, &amp; that our futures our inevitably intertwined. Praying.

@theminorchords @KateDaGreat1111 @ComfortablySmug @kdeleon @SenFeinstein That’s where we just disagree politically 😂. There’s reform to be made, no doubt—medical fort reform (shortening farmaceutical patents’ length), expanding competition across state lines, negotiating with a public option, but we disagree here. Glad our conversation is civil.
@theminorchords @ComfortablySmug @kdeleon @SenFeinstein Yeah that’s my point, just as Obama turned many Republicans further right, Trump will drive many Democrats further left. Honestly it’s just interesting to watch, but I do think that “Medicare-for-All”, Bernie types aren’t as electable as centrists.
@theminorchords @ComfortablySmug @kdeleon @SenFeinstein I’m aware of the primary system in CA, following especially closely because of Cox making the general. My reference is to the fact that the Dems are very ideologically divided this term, and was also comedic more than anything else. Apologies if it came off differently.

@AzSkyWatcher @BennettArizona There’s no actual source/reputable report claiming this. This is all rampant speculation used to attack Ducey &amp; his accomplishments for our state as #AZGov. Bennett can’t even respond to you (can only RT) bc/ he knows it’s not true.

@FelixHybridroma @noprezzie2012 @BennettArizona @AZs_Politics @brahmresnik @SenJohnMcCain Yup.
@coachfern_ @dg4az @investinedaz But I’m glad that we can have a productive conversation, unlike many these days. I see you’ve served our nation, and I’d just also like to say thank you for your dutiful service.
@coachfern_ @dg4az @investinedaz Ducey’s #20x2020 Plan was released before the actual walk-out. I’m so happy that Gov. Ducey and our lawmakers were able to fully fund education—and even they admit that there’s still work left to do.
@coachfern_ @dg4az @investinedaz No, it is, which is why Ducey raised ed. spending by $2.7b, teacher pay by 20%, and per pupil spending by 10%. Garcia is proposing raising taxes on everyone to do exactly what Ducey did without raising taxes. AZ’s economy is booming, and we’ve had more revenue as a result.
Fun fact: According to this recent poll, there are just as many Democrats supporting this plan as there are Republicans supporting this plan.
NEW POLL: 70% of Arizonans support Ducey’s #20x2020 plan. Furthermore, support spans all generations, genders, and even party lines. Truly a pragmatic and widely supported plan.	Source: @Data_Orbital https://t.co/bwxEtwdQGs
@dg4az @investinedaz Besides education, what else do you actually campaign on? It seems like education is the only issue you address, and usually only with baseless rhetoric void of policy.
@ArtemisAphesia @dg4az @investinedaz $2.7b in new education dollars, 20% teacher pay raises, and a 10% raise in per pupil spending doesn’t sound like “consistently cut[ting] funding to it”.
FACT CHECK: Gov. Ducey never said that the individual teachers didn’t march for better education, but that “For the activists, for the government union, it was never about teacher pay.” Ducey stands with AZ education, and the results show that.	https://t.co/li0X3juNuD

@dg4az @investinedaz Ducey allocated 2.7 billion in new $$ to education, raised all teacher salaries by 20% by 2020, and increased per pupil spending by 10%—all while NOT raising taxes (because of BOOMING economy). Stop trying to use teachers for your own political gain.
Happy to have spent today calling voters all across Arizona about our upcoming gubernatorial race and @dougducey’s accomplishments as Governor. We’ve done a lot these past four years, and I can’t wait to see what we can do with another four. #SecureAZ
