@craigmatsuda I remember a Metpro gathering at a museum, and an awesome pic of a bunch of us old-timers that I will have to dig up. And swanky parties by the Washington Post etc on the water.
@craigmatsuda wasnt there a super fancy 25th anniversary metpro brunch in dc? of course that was when all the media companies were having ridic receptions and parties during convention. i dont think i paid for a meal or a drink all week :)
Read this thread. Not bc Esme says nice things about me :) But because she is entirely right about how Metpro lost its way, and how a prestigious program for young journalists became a source of cheap labor and a disservice to the very people it was supposed to support. https://t.co/jrlKNH1LNr
@craigmatsuda @SenJohnMcCain It's kind of amazing to think back to those conventions, and the parties we would throw at spectacular sites with free-flowing drinks and passed apps, etc. Those were the days :)
@andrewkerr @SenJohnMcCain It certainly did re: torture. I don't know how the rest would have turned out. I suspect we still would have had lengthy engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq.

@andrewkerr @SenJohnMcCain Honestly, I don’t know how much his foreign policy would have differed from W’s (or from Hillary’s, quite frankly). They are all hawks.
Read this thread - as someone who started at the LAT as a METPro and will be celebrating my 20-year anniversary at the paper next month, I agree wholeheartedly. https://t.co/6atZnvvqxu
On a related note, was just reminded about the speech @SenJohnMcCain gave on election night 2008 at the Biltmore in AZ once the results were clear. So humble and gracious at such an important moment in American history.
So many people have said it more eloquently than I ever can, but thinking of the McCain family tonight. 2008 was the 1st presidential race I covered &amp; @SenJohnMcCain made it memorable! (he went off script &amp; actually talked to us, a rare trait among prez candidates). Godspeed.

To clarify: When Villaraigosa spoke with press, he said he thought his team had requested at least an extra hour, but his campaign put out a release minute ago that they are asking for through Friday.
WAIT: Viillaraigosa's campaign just said they are asking LA County to keep vote centera open until Friday bc of the more than 118K voters whose names were missing from the rolls at polling places.
@sdlipton @antonio4ca i meant p.m. sorry!
Villaraigosa urges LA County to keep polls open until 9 p.m. https://t.co/YYEkmRC7CS
Team Newsom response: "absolutely terrible news, no one on any campaign wants this to happen. But...GN was beating AV 2:1 in LA in that final IGS poll. If AV gets everyone of those 100K voters, maybe it makes a difference between finishing 3rd, 4th, or 5th"
Jaye also says they are hearing anecdotal reports of people whose names weren't on the list not receiving provisional ballots, and is trying to determine how widespread that it.
Eric Jaye, advisor to Villaraigosa, said he hopes the registrar of voters keeps the polls open late to allow anyone who wasn’t provided a provisional ballot the opportunity to return to the polls and get one.	“He could hold the polls open longer and there’s precedent for that."

Allen opens his closing statement by saying he has interview at 6 a.m. and will stay to answer all questions.
Moderator just asked candidates again if they wld stay for more q's, Allen said yes, Cox said he has an interview in the morning in SD and needs to go home and go to bed. "let him go!" one man in the crowd yelled.
This debate has been going on for nearly two hours. Someone in the crowd just yelled "Dilly dilly!" in response to an answer about tax reform.
Cox has been answering many questions by speaking abt his neighborhood legislature proposal. Allen responded, "That sounds like the People's Republic of China ...  Can CA even afford the sexual harassment lawsuits from 12K legislators?"
Cox and Allen agree that Dems will pick Newsom. Allen describes him as socialist who is tall, good-looking and smooth, while Cox says he is a shape shifting panderer who is young, talented and speaks well.
Cox and Allen agree on a lot. Biggest difference is Allen likes to point out Cox didn't vote for Trump and Cox likes to point out that Allen donated to Dems. https://t.co/HYoCqFVVQt

@SouthwestAir bc if it's going to be cancelled altogether, it is last sw flight out of here today so i need to go buy ticket elsewhere. timing is critical
@SouthwestAir i am lgb-las on 6523. plane is stuck @ las bc maintenance. i want to know if plane will actually make it here or will be canceled altogether
@SouthwestAir Never heard of no interairline travel when carrier is at fault. can you at least say if plane i'm supposed to be on will actually leave LAS?
@SouthwestAir No there are no more SW flts and they won't put us on the JetBlue flt that has empty seats.
@SouthwestAir I literally could have driven there faster and it would have cost less money.
@SouthwestAir Get stranded overnight bc your plane is broken and you won't put us on another flt w/empty seats? Horrible customer service.
@SouthwestAir Of them like united and others have done in similar situations, the guys said no, I asked why, he said SW simply doesn't do that. So we 2/3
@SouthwestAir You did. My flt has been delayed multiple times, there are other airlines leaving Lyn with empty seats, I asked to be placed on 1/2

The other challengers, Hernandez &amp; Rosas, have 7% &amp; 5% respectively. Neither will be councilman but big factor if Cedillo forced into runoff
@jonleibowitz Most people here don't realize that it has turned. They will soon.
Cedillo was counting on his election day voters to bring it home for him but looks like Bray-Ali did well w/them -- now at 41% w/60% vote in
Cedillo just dipped to 47%, with 60% of the vote in -- chances of a runoff growing increasingly likely.

Red America and blue America saw two very different Trump speeches https://t.co/6fhPFam9F9
Former President George W. Bush says his recent remarks have been misconstrued as criticism of Trump https://t.co/mt37RQypk4
W: When O was prez "I got ... calls from the heartland: You need to speak out. Now I’m getting calls from the coasts: You need to speak out"
W's advice to his successors: "My advice starts with know what you don’t know and find ppl who know what you don’t know and listen to them."
W pushes back at the notion that his recent comments were critical of Trump.
Bush said post-WH he read a Churchill essay abt painting and "I basically said what the hell, this guy can paint, I can paint.”
Among the attendees at W's speech: former Ambassador Bob Tuttle, former Treasury Sect Rosario Marin, Reagan's son Michael &amp; grandson Cameron
