@NARAL I remember memorizing the preamble when I was a kid—so nice to hear it recited and presented by these strong women.

@rachaelmbade Avenatti is a breath of fresh air compared to so many other spineless dems. He didn’t try to sugarcoat his client’s horrific story because it was her story to tell. Abuse is real and disgusting. Collins was looking for a way to vote yes on Kavanuagh from day one.

@olgaNYC1211 @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @HouseGOP Courage is revealed not when the going is easy, but when it gets tough. Instead, we see hubris and cowardice.

@maddow One of the finest episodes I've seen you present! Your monologue to start show was spot on. Small suggestion: discuss term "gaslighting" and how Trump employs this tactic to distract/confuse/manipulate.

@AriMelber @feministabulous @MikeLupica Tony is right. Narcissists like Trump need attention at all times, be it positive or negative. Trolling him just feeds the beast. Let’s use that energy to organize and vote for change.

@hardball Chris, to say Trump and Stormy maybe "deserved each other" is not cool before facts emerge...supposedly Trump threatened her with violence. No excuses for that.
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe Now who actually made the threat? Cohen himself? In keeping with how he retweeted "let's gut her" about Megan Kelly pre-election and threatened Daily Beast reporters about Ivana "spousal rape" story.
RT @NBCNews: JUST IN: Stormy Daniels' lawyer tells @Morning_Joe that she has been "physically threatened." https://t.co/BtcoGMSi0h
