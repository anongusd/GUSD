These are the true stories of many of the men, women, and children who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking their legal right to safety.		But President Trump would rather scapegoat them to advance his anti-immigrant agenda.
Lucas* and Eduardo*‚Äîeight and four years old‚Äîarrived in the United States desperate to escape from their abusive father. Two weeks after their interview with the asylum officer, the boys were granted asylum. 		They celebrated by eating ice cream sundaes.
Cristian* is a gay man from El Salvador who endured years of abuse and persecution due to his sexual orientation before escaping to the United States. 		Now that he has been granted asylum, he no longer fears for his safety because of his identity. https://t.co/JmU5YDv6oD
Miranda* fled decades of domestic violence at the hands of her husband in Mexico. She complained to Mexican authorities on multiple occasions, but they failed to protect her. 		She traveled to the U.S. border with only one hope: that the United States would protect her.
üëèüëèüëè https://t.co/cmP1yoXCXg
Natalia* fled her native Honduras after testifying against the gang members who murdered a family member and narrowly escaping being killed herself. With the help of a pro bono legal team, she was recently granted asylum and can finally live in safety with her children. https://t.co/VbR9D4QwaH
Jennifer* and Carlos* are 12-year-old and 6-year-old siblings who fled El Salvador after their mother assisted law enforcement officers in the investigation of their father‚Äôs disappearance and murder.		 The asylum process was their lifeline; it was a lifesaver.
Juan* is a 15-year-old boy who escaped abuse and exploitation at the hands of his extended family in El Salvador and threats from local gang members. 		Here in the United States, he can concentrate on his studies without fearing every day for his safety. https://t.co/4nWwnJ3V36
Our client Gabriela* is a female attorney from El Salvador who escaped death threats from MS-13 after refusing to provide them with legal assistance. 		Now that she has been granted asylum, Gabriela is committed to using her legal skills to assist other survivors of violence.
He calls asylum seekers ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù‚Äîbut they often escaped criminals.	He calls them ‚Äúillegals‚Äù‚Äîbut seeking asylum is LEGAL.	He calls them ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù‚Äîbut they ask only for freedom.

The Trump Administration‚Äôs massive overuse of detention punishes vulnerable asylum seekers in a failed attempt to deter others from seeking protection. Refugee families are treated like criminals from the moment they arrive at our borders. 	https://t.co/ky6J0ibnsN
These detention centers are prisons. Detainees are subjected to unhygienic, unsanitary, and unsafe conditions. And they are often mistreated and discriminated against by facility staff. 		"It's torture, it is not life. People who ask for asylum are treated like criminals here."
LGBT individuals are 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than non-LGBT people in immigration detention. 		Alicia, a 29-year-old transgender women experienced transphobic slurs, abuse, and a complete lack of protection while detained in the male housing unit.
Detention facilities are especially unable or unsuited to provide adequate care for vulnerable populations, including pregnant women and members of the LGBT community. 		Conditions in DHS facilities put the health of pregnant women at risk‚Äîwith many suffering miscarriages.
No one deserves to be treated this way.		‚ñ™Ô∏èA hearing-impaired asylum seeker waited over six months for a working hearing aid.	‚ñ™Ô∏èA woman hemorrhaged for over two months before receiving emergency care. 	‚ñ™Ô∏èA diabetic man was forced to wait 11 days for his medication.
One tragic example:		Irena, a 50-year-old Armenian woman, experienced severe stomach pain and swelling that often caused her to vomit. Medical staff misdiagnosed her with liver problems. Upon release, a doctor discovered that she had ovarian cancer. 	https://t.co/ky6J0ibnsN
Health care in immigration detention in California is entirely insufficient. 		Long delays before being attended to by staff and health professional, insufficient medication, and a lack of appropriate mental health care for survivors of torture and trauma are all too common.
ICE continues to deny asylum seekers release on parole‚Äîdespite our lawsuit blocking the blanket denial of parole requests.		Our research shows that the LA ICE office continues to deny parole even when release is warranted, or to impose unaffordable bonds.
Many asylum seekers and immigrants in California are jailed for well-over a year. Our researchers met with one detainee who has been held in immigration detention for over FOUR years in California.		It's inhumane, unnecessary &amp; wasteful.	https://t.co/ky6J0ibnsN

Together with @NIJC and Williams &amp; Connelly, LLP, we are moving ahead in support of our clients, who came to the border seeking protection and were effectively told that the United States was closed for business. 		This asylum ban will not stand up in court.
When they arrived near the border, it was covered with police officers. He did not know that he "needed" to go to a port of entry to seek asylum.		So he crossed and looked for a CBP agent. 		Agents told him to go home because the government "was no longer helping people."
Ernesto* and his four-year-old daughter Alma* fled Honduras after members of the 18th street gang murdered two of his brothers and threatened his life. Ernesto went to the police, and the 18th street gang burned his house down.		He had no choice but to flee.
Lucy* and her son *Fernando were forced to flee from her husband's relentless violence and death threats. When they arrived at the border, they assumed it was closed when they saw the military lined up.		So they crossed. Now we're working to ensure that they can access safety.
Our client *Jesus is a 17-year-old boy. He was abused by his father and repeatedly threatened by MS-13 members for refusing to join their ranks. He knew he would be killed if he didn't flee. 		President Trump's illegal asylum ban blocks him from life-saving protection.
We will continue fighting on behalf of *Maria, who fled decades of abuse at the hands of her partner, who killed her father and sent gang members to threaten her. After crossing the border to seek asylum, she discovered that she was no longer eligible for protection.
By blocking individuals from seeking asylum, the administration acted illegally and turned its back on our nation‚Äôs ideals. We are committed to fighting for our clients and the principle that the Trump Administration is not above the law. 		https://t.co/g3Stsh7rtK

While the myriad of immigration news can be overwhelming, this simple fact is true, the Trump Administration‚Äôs policies are devastatingly cruel to innocent children who traveled to the United States in search of protection. /END
Trying to illegally bar them from seeking asylum between ports of entry, making them wait for months at the border, proposing a plan to force them to stay in Mexico, and spraying tear gas on innocent women and children are the latest heartbreaking examples.
And with President Trump‚Äôs treatment of the men, women, and children traveling to the United States as part of the caravan, it is once again remarkably clear that he wants to punish families‚Äîand children‚Äîfor seeking refuge.
The government is also allowing the facility to sidestep health care requirements‚Äîwith just 1 doctor for every 100 children, the facility is unable to provide adequate care. Our researchers have documented a similar lack of medical care at facilities across the country.
Recent reports reveal that the staff at the facility are not undergoing traditional FBI background checks, substantially increasing the risk that an individual with a criminal history could have direct access to children. https://t.co/1jnXymyNWO
The effects of this are being felt across the country, as well as in the Tornillo detention center‚Äîthe largest ‚Äútent city‚Äù built under President Trump. Some of the 2,300 teenagers detained there have been sleeping in canvas tents in the desert since June.
Because of this, family members are unable to pick up their relatives from detention, extending the periods of incarceration for children. Because of the administration‚Äôs hateful policies, children remain separated from their loved ones for months or even longer.
Officials from DHS and HHS are also using information obtained from incarcerated children to locate their parents‚Äînot to reunite them‚Äîbut to arrest and deport them. 		The U.S. government is turning children into unwilling informants, using them as bait. https://t.co/WCMQi2EofJ
Despite the end of the zero-tolerance policy, reports show that the administration is *again* separating children from their parents (or perhaps never stopped.) This time using vague or unsubstantiated allegations against parents as the justification. https://t.co/DiL81jqeak
Trump officials repeatedly compared detention facilities to ‚Äúsummer camps‚Äù while building ‚Äútent cities‚Äù for thousands of migrant teenagers, sending children to foster homes away from their families, and ripping babies from their mothers‚Äô arms.
Yet, the administration doubled-down, requesting to repeal the ‚ÄúFlores Settlement Agreement,‚Äù the court order that restricts the amount of time that families can be incarcerated. 		The administration wants to INCREASE the length of time children can remain behind bars.
The administration left children to languish behind bars, despite being briefed on the negative effects of incarceration on children. The American Academy of Pediatrics (@AmerAcadPeds) has repeatedly warned that detention results in psychological distress, PTSD, and suicidality.
The president‚Äôs ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù policy this summer resulted in the forced separation of thousands of asylum-seeking children from their families‚Äîsome for months on end. The American people saw the consequences of this policy first-hand, leading to protests across the country.
THREAD: President Trump‚Äôs immigration policies are far-reaching, sometimes difficult to understand, and rooted in hate. But one thing seems to unite them all: a blatant, absolute disregard for the rights, safety, and well-being of children. 		Let us explain.

Bottom Line: Asylum seekers should not be refused protection because of the many hurdles placed in their path to safety. In fact, U.S. law and international treaty commitments guarantee refugees an avenue to seek asylum regardless of how they entered the country.
5‚É£ Many people lack accurate information about how to seek refuge in the United States and may only hear rumors and misinformation from smugglers and other migrants. They know that they can request asylum once they step foot on U.S. soil, so they cross between POE's.
4‚É£ Some asylum-seekers face acute risks in Mexico from cartel groups and gangs, including murder, rape, kidnapping, and human trafficking. Unable to wait weeks or months in these conditions, many families are forced to cross between official border points.
3‚É£ CBP officials have‚Äîin an orchestrated manner‚Äîrestricted the number of asylum seekers processed at ports of entry daily, forcing asylum seekers to wait for extended periods in dangerous and difficult conditions.
2‚É£ Customs and Border Protection officers ‚Äúturn back‚Äù asylum seekers by outright refusal or by telling them to come back another day. After being turned away‚Äîoften multiple times‚Äîsome asylum seekers choose to cross between ports to request their legal right to asylum.
1‚É£ Mexican immigration officials often block asylum seekers from approaching U.S. border posts. Our researchers have seen this first-hand. Mexican officials‚Äîunder the request of CBP‚Äîphysically stand at the port of entry, preventing people from requesting protection.
After Trump announced his illegal decision to bar people who cross between ports of entry from asylum, a lot of people asked why asylum-seekers cross between ports of entry in the first place. Here's our fact sheet to explain why: https://t.co/OVcxuGTc7L https://t.co/lIbHiINZ8X

Seeking asylum IS NOT A CRIME, and people are entitled to seek asylum regardless of where they cross the border.
For two years this administration has systematically undermined the asylum and refugee protection systems. It has illegally turned away refugees at official border points, forcing desperate individuals to make the dangerous crossing between points.
The case, O.A. v. Trump, was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The filing can be found here: https://t.co/0kzclxGTk6
The lead plaintiff, O.A., is here with his 4-yr-old daughter. They fled Honduras after O.A. tried to help the police investigate the murder of his brother and was then targeted himself‚Äîwith death threats and an attempt to kill him by burning down his house.
The plaintiffs in today's case either entered the United States outside an official border entry point after being turned away or forced to wait in unsafe conditions near inspection points, or because they did not realize that going to a port of entry was an option.
"By blocking these brave individuals from seeking asylum, the administration acted illegally and turned its back on our nation‚Äôs ideals. We are committed to fighting for our clients and the principle that the Trump Administration is not above the law."
‚ÄúThe U.S. was built as a haven for the persecuted. Today‚Äôs refugees at our southern border‚ÄîHuman Rights First‚Äôs clients‚Äîare no different than those who have landed on our shores for generations in search of a safe and dignified life for themselves and their families." @M_Breen
The plaintiffs in O.A. v. Trump are six asylum seekers, including three children, who were illegally barred from seeking asylum because they entered the United States outside of an official border point.

The Trump administration wants people fleeing violence to apply for asylum at ports of entry, where border officials are more likely than not to tell families to come back some other time. ‚ÄúThis is a deliberate attempt to throttle families‚Äô right to asylum‚Äù‚Äî@Adam_Wola 16/
Clearly there are inconsistencies in the government‚Äôs plan. CBP is ‚Äúbreaking U.S. and international law by turning people away, at the same time their bosses in the administration are telling people to go to the ports of entry to seek asylum.‚Äù‚Äî@ShawDrake1 15/
In the past‚Äîas DHS‚Äô own Office of Inspector General reported‚Äîthese long wait times, often in very dangerous condition, forced people to cross between entry points. 14/ https://t.co/gPzy71ttyv
These people forced to wait include young children, mothers, fathers, members of the LGBT community, and Mexican citizens (who are thus forced to wait in their country of persecution, Mexico). 13/
At the Calexico, California port of entry CBP processes only 3 individual asylum seekers per day, although not every day. Over 200 asylum seekers are on the waitlist. 12/ https://t.co/ABtbLUCCxM
Many of the families currently waiting have been there since early October. One boy is about to celebrate his 8th birthday, in limbo on the bridge between the U.S. and Mexico. 11/ https://t.co/tmVoI52p6r
Our researchers found that at the San Luis port of entry in Arizona, CBP is only processing 1-2 asylum seeking families per day. Two CBP agents stand at the border crossing, physically blocking families from approaching the port. 10/ https://t.co/ervtFx4x43

Just today, our @Alyssa_IZA and @KennjiKizuka met with a man who was robbed while waiting on an international bridge. After fleeing from cartel violence, he is not sure that he can survive a months-long wait in Mexico. 8/ https://t.co/GrOLbxcjXl
We‚Äôve met people who were kidnapped, beaten, and held for ransom while waiting outside of ports of entry. In parts of Mexico, local gangs wait at the foot of the bridge for people who were turned away by border agents. 7/ https://t.co/By9tSIMEEt
While they wait, families are forced to endure incredibly difficult conditions. Traveling to and from shelters in Mexico is often dangerous, and many choose to sleep in make-shift tents on the bridge in order to ensure that they don‚Äôt miss their number being called. 6/
The United States is manufacturing bottle-necks by processing only a few asylum seekers per-day, deliberately choosing not to provide capacity to border agents to process more, or by purposefully limiting daily numbers. 5/
However, when asylum seekers arrive at ports of entry, they are forced to wait days, weeks, and even months. At many entry points, they are given a ‚Äúnumber‚Äù and told to wait until that number is called. 4/
The president‚Äôs order blocks from asylum anyone who crosses between official border entry points, thereby forcing people to come to ports of entry to access the asylum system. (FWIW: Many asylum-seeking families already do this). 3/ https://t.co/m8ZIi94U1R
The goal here is alarmingly clear: prevent people from accessing protection altogether. Full stop. 2/

Seeking asylum is a legal right. Congress specifically passed laws guaranteeing that people fleeing violence or persecution could access the asylum system, regardless of where they crossed the border. 		President Trump is not above the law. https://t.co/hsUXUItwA2
This is an asylum ban, pure and simple. 		This ban does nothing to make America safer; its only purpose is to further a bigoted agenda that seeks to demonize and dehumanize people whose only wish is to live in safety and dignity.
This morning's presidential proclamation, coupled with last night's regulation, will make it so that people who cross between ports of entry are no longer able to access the asylum system. 		That is a violation of the Constitution, the INA, and international law.

President Trump acknowledges that there are legitimate asylum seekers, and then says that "almost everyone is abusing it." 		We work with asylum seekers every day, we know that people are bravely coming here to seek protection from violence, not to exploit a "loophole."
Immigrants appear for their immigration court hearings at high rates, particularly when they have legal representation or case management support, and accurate information related to the court process.		Clearly the president has no understanding of the process or of the facts.
He claims that only 3% of asylum seekers show up to their court appearances after being released. 		AGAIN, that is absolutely 100% false. Not even a question. https://t.co/jArmpFJfiW
President Trump: "We're going to no longer release‚Äîthey're going to stay with us until the deportation or asylum hearing takes place."		He again claims that people who apply for asylum and are released do not appear for their court hearings. FALSE. https://t.co/jArmpFJfiW
Trump: "If members of the caravan were truly looking for protection, they would stay in Mexico."		FALSE. There is no legal basis for that claim. https://t.co/BhK2wD3I2S
President Trump again doubles down on rhetoric calling the caravan an "invasion."		That hateful language has consequences, President Trump.
President Trump: "We will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would violate our laws."		REMINDER: He's talking about women and children fleeing unspeakable violence to seek protection. https://t.co/RKGBq2WQt5
President Trump claims that under his leadership, "America is a welcoming country." Why then, is he trying to bar men, women, and children who are coming to the United States to seek asylum?

No matter how refugees and asylum seekers are demonized and vilified by the president and his administration, we know that refugees DEFINE America. They renew America, diversify America, and strengthen America. 		President Trump's fear-mongering won't change that. https://t.co/M2OkHM3Mdt
This country was founded as a haven for the persecuted, and we cannot let it be debased by hateful forces who seek to demonize the most vulnerable among us for political gain. We won't stand for it. /END
Or our client Emmanuel*, a political and minority rights activist who fled Ethiopia after being detained and tortured by the government. With the assistance of Human Rights First and a team of pro bono attorneys, he was recently granted asylum by the immigration court.
Refugees like our client Gabriela*, an attorney from El Salvador who escaped death threats by MS-13 after refusing to defend them in court. 		Since being granted asylum in the U.S., Gabriela is now committed to using her legal skills to assist other survivors of violence.
It‚Äôs because we know that refugees love America. They contribute to this nation in a myriad of ways, whether that be opening businesses, defending this nation in uniform, or simply being active members of their communities.
This is why the staff at Human Rights First continues to be committed to common-sense solutions, to safeguarding the refugee and asylum systems from attacks, and to the protection of brave families fleeing unspeakable violence in Central America and beyond.
And since there is no ‚Äúsafe third country‚Äù agreement in place with Mexico, refugees and migrants are not legally bound to request asylum in Mexico first. 		President Trump and Secretary Nielsen have no legal basis to tell members of the caravan that they must ‚Äúturn around.‚Äù
Why don‚Äôt they all just stop in Mexico?		Our research shows that Mexico is not safe for many refugees and asylum seekers. Certain groups‚Äîincluding the LGBTQ community, people with indigenous heritage, and many foreigners in general‚Äîface consistent persecution in Mexico.
#FactsMatter: Despite the administration‚Äôs rhetoric, a large portion of caravan members have chosen to stay in Mexico to seek asylum, while others have bravely chosen to continue their journey to ask this nation for protection.
By the time this caravan‚Äîwhich is still ~1,000 miles away‚Äîarrives at the U.S.-Mexico border, the number will have further dwindled, making it part of daily asylum requests that our nation is more than able to address.
It‚Äôs especially wasteful when we know that asylum requests from members of the caravan would not represent an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù or ‚Äúinflux.‚Äù 		During the last caravan, 400 asylum requests were made, which was entirely on par with daily and monthly trends.
Sending thousands of troops to the border is both wasteful and reckless. Dozens of national security experts have stated that further militarizing our borders is financially costly, harmful to our nation's security, and is a clear misuse of the military for political purposes.
Many of the mothers, fathers, and young children involved in the #CaravanaMigrante have bravely risked their lives to seek their LEGAL right to asylum. 		These families should not be met at out southern border with machine guns.
But our 40+ years of experience show that this is nothing more than political fear-mongering days before the midterm elections. The United States can handle asylum requests from caravan members in an orderly fashion‚Äîas we have successfully done for decades.
And daily attacks on the families and children that constitute a refugee and migrant caravan are inundating the airwaves‚Äîwith President Trump manufacturing a national emergency to further his partisan agenda.
Right now, our mission is far from easy. This administration has doubled down on some of the cruelest policies imaginable‚Äîfamily separation, family incarceration, ‚Äútent cities,‚Äù and the drastic reduction in annual refugee admissions.
THREAD: No matter how refugees and asylum seekers are demonized and vilified, Human Rights First is committed to serving our asylum-seeking clients, to fighting back against misinformation, and to ensuring that refugees can live in freedom and dignity in the United States.

Statement from our @RobBerschinski üëá	https://t.co/69WD33RCDC
As should surprise no one at this point in the Trump presidency, what the President of the United States presented to the world wasn‚Äôt so much an articulation of American values as a rejection of what has made this country both great and good.
Gone is both JFK‚Äôs pledge to ‚Äúbear any burden‚Äù and Ronald Reagan‚Äôs call to ‚Äútear down this wall.‚Äù Gone are appeals to the "better angels of our nature.‚Äù
What we heard today from President Trump at the U.N. General Assembly diverges wildly from American values and interests as expressed by a long line of previous presidents of both political parties.
What our president fails to understand is that international cooperation on migration does not sacrifice U.S. "sovereignty," it actually advances U.S. interests.
Even in praising those states, like Jordan, that are bearing the brunt of the global flow of refugees, Trump managed to hide behind the work of others to mask administration policies that are harming the most vulnerable.
President Trump's emphatic rejection of the Global Compact on Migration is yet another indication that this administration is deciding not to lead internationally when it comes to solving hard, transnational problems.
His attacks on the UN Human Rights Council and International Criminal Court amount to saying that the U.S. is no longer in the business of improving flawed international bodies, and will be seen by mass-murderers like Bashar al Assad and Burma‚Äôs military leaders as a boon.
Trump‚Äôs overly-simplistic and distorted view of ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù will be music to the ears of authoritarian leaders from Moscow to Beijing.	https://t.co/dJj1NEpF8d

@realDonaldTrump and AG Sessions are not trying to ‚Äúsecure our borders‚Äù or improve the immigration system. They are simply attempting to punish all immigrants arriving at our borders out of desperation.
Despite these successes, @realDonaldTrump axed the program in 2017 in favor of separating families and throwing them in cages. So, what exactly is the Trump Administration trying to accomplish?
In fact, a 2017 review of the DHS office found that the Family Case Management Program had a 99% success rate for families attending ICE check-ins and appointments, and a 100% success rate for families attending their court hearings.
Instead, time and time again, data has proven that programs like the Family Case Management Program are cheaper, more effective, and more humane than the incarceration of families. https://t.co/XcV7IZhN1h https://t.co/ZXseChMztW

Our data analysis has shown time and time again that families and children with legal counsel show up to their court hearings nearly 100 percent of the time. These people are not trying to evade the law: some just need help navigating the process. https://t.co/jArmpFJfiW
Another important takeaway: people with attorneys were much more likely to make their court dates. Asylum seekers with access to legal representation and case management have help in navigating the complex legal system and in communicating with the court.
If the Trump Administration is genuinely concerned about making sure asylum seekers stay in the legal process, there are solutions. The administration should devote its energy to smoothing the bureaucratic obstacles that are the real heart of the problem. https://t.co/0OykSoANgx
All of us who work in the asylum representation space know that asylum-seekers want to comply with rules set into place. It‚Äôs just that the system makes it almost impossible for them, flooding them with legal and bureaucratic obstacles that are difficult to understand.
The administration could do a better job of coordinating between agencies so that migrants only need to update their addresses once. (See below stories üëá). But instead, the administration adopted a blanket approach that assumes that all families are trying to evade the law. https://t.co/rNVRoyozjs
In order to ensure court appearances, the administration should adopt a case-management approach that acknowledges that people are trying to get through the system the right way and simply need a little help navigating it. https://t.co/tSkVT1BUI7

Many parents accept deportation because they think that they will then be reunited with their children. Others choose to be deported because they would rather be sent back to danger than face blatant mistreatment and abuse in prison-like detention centers.

This false choice narrative propelled by the administration‚Äîfamily separation or family detention‚Äîconspicuously omits migration management strategies like the Family Case Management Program that are effective, proven, and far less costly and cruel.
At Human Rights First, we provide pro bono legal representation to refugees seeking asylum. From this experience, we know that asylum seekers who are afforded accurate information and legal representation overwhelmingly appear for their immigration removal hearings.
Not only is the detention of children ‚Äúnever in their best interests,‚Äù but family detention may also ‚Äúconstitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment‚Äù in violation of the Convention Against Torture. https://t.co/D0R78uLcNX
The Family Case Management Program cost around $12 per person, per day. Family detention costs over $300 dollars per person, per day. Other alternative programs cost as low as 30 cents to $8.04 per person, per day. https://t.co/nq3xYaaGtl
Another alternative to detention program, explained by the @CatoInstitute, resulted in 99.6% compliance. And was found to be much cheaper, more humane, and more effective than incarceration programs.
DHS‚Äôs own advisory committee recommended expansion of community-based case management programs rather than family detention. Concluding that detention is ‚Äúnever in the best interest of children,‚Äù the committee recommended DHS ‚Äúdiscontinue the general use of family detention." https://t.co/mpw28v2YOS

In fact, a 2017 review of the DHS office found that the Family Case Management Program had a 99% success rate for families attending ICE check-ins and appointments, and a 100% success rate for families attending their court hearings. https://t.co/FaXLvcAD9U
Instead, time and time again, data has proven that programs like the Family Case Management Program are cheaper, more effective, and more humane than the incarceration of families. https://t.co/XcV7IZhN1h https://t.co/cZLJoZajzD

More than unsafe, these family detention centers are also unnecessary. Alternatives to detention, like the Family Case Management Program, resulted in 99.8% compliance, as reported by ICE itself. https://t.co/vaP0sNiman https://t.co/TImHvoCoN1
These facilities are not safe for children. They trigger distress, including self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, developmental regressions, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Children may suffer physical health problems, such as weight loss and frequent infections.
Children in detention don‚Äôt want to eat, they just cry. One mother stated, "my daughter is seeing a psychologist for the trauma she suffers from the death of her father. But what about the trauma she suffers from being detained?‚Äù https://t.co/dVRKJQcXeZ
A mother who was detained for six months along with her nine year old son recounted: ‚Äú[My son] would tell me, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not a criminal that should be held in this place,‚Äô‚Äù and, ‚ÄúMy son, crying, told me that if I didn‚Äôt get him out of there, he would throw himself from the roof.‚Äù
Another example: At the El Paso Processing Center, a detainee from a Muslim majority country said that guards have called him a ‚Äústupid Taliban terrorist‚Äù and that kitchen staff have called him a ‚ÄúMuslim terrorist.‚Äù Another officer said, ‚ÄúYou guys are my enemy.‚Äù
One detainee who was imprisoned with her children in Pennsylvania: "agents mock our dignity as immigrants. We came here seeking refuge. We came to this country to save our lives and the lives of our children.‚Äù https://t.co/S7s4cl43X4
Children have suffered psychological damage, and many have suffered health-wise, because of the confinement‚Äînot to mention the racist abuse and poor treatment from certain members of the staff in the detention center.
An 11-year-old girl locked in prison with her family: "A few days after I arrived here, I realized that this was going to be very hard. I try to go outside, distract myself with some activities. We are not delinquents who should be imprisoned." https://t.co/lujPNvWBU2
Trump and Sessions don't seem to care if their detention centers are filthy, inhumane, or medically unsafe. Instead, they see these conditions as measurable deterrents to any refugees desperate enough to come to our borders.
One detainee in El Paso stated: ‚ÄúIs El Paso even part of the United States? Do they follow international laws here? I thought the U.S. was one of the most recognized countries for human rights, and I come here and find the worst form of human treatment.‚Äù #EndFamilyDetention
In fact, almost everyone interviewed reported high levels of stress and anxiety stemming from a variety of factors, including: lack of sleep, poor nutrition, unhygienic conditions, isolation, and uncertainty of their legal cases. https://t.co/gpqlexV2fP
Mental health, too, is a serious concern for detainees, many of whom suffer from PTSD, depression, and anxiety. These issues generally worsen with prolonged detention, and many who need psychotherapy services never receive it.
More reports from the NJ facility claim that food is often spoiled or expired, leaving it inedible. One detainee at Hudson claimed to have lost 15 pounds during only 3 weeks of detention due to the food quality.
Many facilities themselves are unhygienic or unsanitary. Human Rights First researchers talked to several individuals held at a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey who said they found worms or maggots in the showers on multiple occasions.  https://t.co/pPzdEyYBrC
One detainee stated: ‚ÄúThis is a modern ghetto. They want to break us mentally ‚Ä¶ We haven‚Äôt committed any crime ‚Ä¶ The treatment here is very criminal. You cannot access justice here.‚Äù
We conducted interviews and research on the ground of multiple facilities and found: improper medical care; inadequate mental health services; filthy and unhealthy living conditions; and more atrocities. These detention centers are prisons. https://t.co/dNHMXi5CaH

But for children, Trump's policy of family detention means further trauma and further abuse. Mental health evaluations for detained children contain diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, which have been either perpetuated or exacerbated by detention.
Family detention violates international human rights standards, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee on the Rights of the Child states that immigration detention of children ‚Äúis never in their best interests and is not justifiable.‚Äù

Detention unnecessarily exposes families with high rates of previous trauma, physical and sexual abuse, and exploitation to additional psychological trauma, putting children and their parents at greater risk for physical and mental health problems.
Prolonged detention‚Äîeven with family members‚Äîhas serious negative consequences for children, including suicidal gestures, anxiety, sleeplessness, behavioral regressions, and lack of appetite. it's still prison like conditions for children.

These people are fleeing unimaginable violence. They arrive in the United States desperate for safety, desperate for a place free from fear. And yet, today, the U.S. is separating them from their children, placing them in detention for months, and treating them like criminals. https://t.co/k4vBPUKyuK
Our client *Sophie, a mother of two from El Salvador, was separated from her sons‚Äîone under the age of 10, the other under 5‚Äîin May and hasn‚Äôt seen them since. Sophie has been told what state her children are in, but has not been able to speak with them.
*Arlin was physically, sexually, and psychologically abused by the father of her children over a period of several years. After she was raped at gunpoint and told that she would be killed, Arlin fled Honduras to seek asylum in the United States. She was granted asylum in April.
*Emely was assaulted, extorted, robbed, and threatened by gang members. She was targeted because of her relationship to a police man, who was murdered by gang members. She fled Honduras with her two young children to save their lives. The family was granted asylum in March.
*Raj was repeatedly beaten, abducted, and sexually assaulted by Bangladeshi government agents for his involvement with an opposition party. The police interrogated and beat Raj, forcing him to flee. With the help of Human Rights First, he was granted asylum earlier this month.
*Sergei and his family faced persecution in Russia because of their identity. They fled to Azerbaijan, where Sergei's sister was raped and Sergei was attacked. Sergei escaped to the United States, where he was granted asylum this past February.
*Victoria suffered years of domestic violence and abuse in Honduras. She fled when her partner threatened to kill her then-10-year-old daughter. Victoria and her daughter were granted asylum. Victoria is now working to petition her five other children, who remain in danger.
A teenager from Tajikistan, *Ali was threatened by the government because of his father, who had spoken out and written critically about the government. In June, Ali was granted asylum. He plans to apply for a travel visa to visit his father in Canada.
*Mariam suffered severe violence at the hands of her husband in Burkina Faso. The police told her that it was her fault for "not respecting" her husband. Mariam fled to the United States for safety. She is now living in New Jersey, taking classes and learning English.
An academic from Ethiopia, *Dr. Achebe conducted research on government corruption in his country. He was arbitrarily tortured and arrested, and finally fled to the United States. With help from Human Rights First and two pro bono attorneys, he was granted asylum in June.
*Jean was held captive, beaten, and tortured by his government for his political activities. Fearing for his life, he fled Togo, leaving behind his infant son. Jean was granted asylum in 2016. This past May, he was finally reunited with his now 6-year-old son.
*Lucas and *Eduardo‚Äîeight and four years old‚Äîarrived in the United States desperate to escape from their abusive father. Two weeks after their interview with the asylum officer, the boys were granted asylum. They celebrated by eating ice cream sundaes.
*Isabel was abducted, raped, and held against her will by a drug cartel in Mexico. When she told her brother about it, the cartel murdered him. She quickly fled, traveling thousands of miles with her son. In February, Isabel and her son were granted asylum.
*Luz, a citizen of El Salvador, suffered domestic abuse for years at the hands of her husband. Police refused to protect her. She had no choice but to flee. With the help of Human Rights First, she was granted asylum in June.

On #WorldRefugeeDay, and every day, we are fighting for refugees, and we need your help. Donations help us provide refugees with the legal representation that they need to present their asylum claim and pave a way to safety and security. https://t.co/V8IsI1Gdoy
We're fighting to protect the asylum system. What's happening isn't "enforcing the law." In fact, it‚Äôs not a law at all. It's Sessions' way of using cruelty as a tool to deter any refugee from partaking in the lawful asylum system. https://t.co/L7qX2JWta6
And we fight for refugees who are illegally turned away at the border. Families like the Berudo's who were turned away and told that there was "no space" at Customs and Border Patrol stations for them. "If we go back home," they said, "they will kill us." https://t.co/suvXO29eJv
We are fighting for refugees who don‚Äôt get a shot at due process. Who are offered only dehumanizing mass ‚Äútrials,‚Äù in which large groups of refugees shout their answers to a judge in unison without the opportunity to argue their individual case. https://t.co/Mw0HuMrL1H
We are fighting for refugees fleeing domestic violence, despite Sessions‚Äô newest policy making it even harder for battered women to qualify for asylum. Refugees like our client *Mariam, who fled her abusive husband after he stabbed her twice in the back. https://t.co/5L8wndsJNi
We fight for the nearly 2,500 children who have been separated from their families. Babies, infants, kids, and teenagers, who now live scared, in inhumane conditions, unsure of when they will next see their parents. https://t.co/Q1MJF1WOEo
We're fighting for our client *Sophie, a mother of two from El Salvador, who was separated from her sons‚Äîone under the age of 10, the other under 5‚Äîin May and hasn‚Äôt seen them since. Sophie has been told what state her children are in, but has not been able to speak with them.
We fight for fathers like Eric, who fled to the border with his 3-year-old son after receiving death threats. Border officers took his son without clothes or authorization. "I don't know where he is. I don't know if he's hurt. I don't know anything." https://t.co/qa9asvRsLb
We fight for mothers like Mirian who requested asylum at the border with her infant son, only to have him taken away the next morning. She remembers his screams as officers buckled him into the car, ‚Äúwithout giving me even a moment to comfort him.‚Äù https://t.co/r9QPxfsjS1
On #WorldRefugeeDay, let's not forget who we are fighting for... https://t.co/Eo2r3OxKdL
Every minute, 20 refugees are forced to flee their homes due to violence and persecution. These refugees have a legal right to request asylum at the U.S. border. Sessions, however, is using his zero-tolerance policy to try and deter all asylum seekers from seeking protection.
After WW2, the U.S. stepped forward as a world leader in aiding refugees from across the globe. Today, Attorney General Sessions is attempting to uproot this legacy through brutal, manufactured policies that narrow and alter the ways in which refugees seek protection.

This border-wide policy is quite clearly unlawful. There is no fair access to the asylum process right now, which is a clear violation of U.S. and international law.
These are people who are trying to follow the rules and present themselves as required. Yet, agents at the bridge tell them to come back when there is capacity. Where are they expected to go until then? Mexico isn't safe for them.
In the @latimes, the story of families stuck in limbo. ‚ÄúWe heard if you cross in the river they will separate you from your family,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we came on the bridge.‚Äù https://t.co/IptEEZbTXW
Here's @nytimes with the story of a mother and her 2 children who slept on the ground for 2 weeks in their effort to seek their legal right to asylum. The Trump Administration is sending a message: wait; and when the wait becomes too long, go home. https://t.co/e71C7nJ2F2
Also from @BobMooreNews: the story of three migrants‚Äîa badly sunburned woman, her baby, and a 16-year-old girl. Despite the fact that federal law allows immigrants to step into the U.S. and claim asylum, agents are physically preventing them from doing so. https://t.co/cuhXmBSmWY
We have this administration that‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄòCome to the port of entry; we‚Äôre going to prosecute everybody who doesn‚Äôt come to the port of entry seeking asylum.‚Äô And now we have CBP agents continuously turning people away. In reality, they don‚Äôt want anybody to come.
The Trump Administration is doing the same thing to Serbando Pineda Hernandez and his 15-year-old son, Riquelmer, who waited on a bridge to request asylum for 9 days. Here's @BobMooreNews with the story. https://t.co/htrXtisC7l
So what's a family to do? They cannot go back to their home countries, where they will likely be killed. The Trump Administration is blocking access to asylum in every way it can, forcing families to make impossible choices.
A message is being broadcast across the nation that migrants should be seeking asylum through official channels. But the Trump Administration is making it impossible. People are being turned away, told that there's no room, or told that they cannot enter the bridge.
Only 10 to 15 asylum seekers show up a day at this bridge. It makes no sense why U.S. agents are saying there's no room in their station to process people who follow the law. And this is happening all over the U.S.-Mexico border. https://t.co/gt6EE9Gjjx

There are no laws that compel the United States to separate families, to criminally prosecute asylum seekers, or to send children to tent cities. Sessions is creating a false narrative to justify his criminal treatment of immigrants and refugees.
Today, Jeff Sessions stated that Americans must "obey the laws of the government." The problem is, Jeff Sessions is NOT obeying the laws. Criminally prosecuting asylum seekers and sending them back to danger violates U.S &amp; international law. https://t.co/wJznS1x6X2
"At its core, asylum is an instrument to preserve the right to life. Families are the foundational element of our society and they must be able to stay together. Separating babies from their mothers is not the answer and is immoral"‚ÄîCardinal Daniel DiNardo https://t.co/ecn13pJgrz
Thanks to Sessions's "zero-tolerance" policy that rips children away from their parents, there has been a surge in the number of refugee children held in U.S. custody. Today, there are 11,432 migrant children in custody, up from fewer than 9,000 in late May.
Reminder: this is happening in the United States in 2018.

Yet even when asylum seekers follow the Trump Administration's guidelines and arrive at official border stations‚Äîdoing exactly what they are supposed to do‚Äîthey are still being separated from their families. Here are a few stories:
