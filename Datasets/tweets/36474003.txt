Going to pull this back slightly after looking again at the results. I'd say Dems are at 56 right now, with three seats too close to call: AD 38, AD 60 and AD 74. In AD 60, Asm. Cervantes has a mere 3-vote lead over Republican Bill Essayli.
In response to what @CaWaterBoards Chair Felicia Marcus called a "historic request" from Brown and Newsom, the board votes 3-0, with two abstentions, to postpone San Joaquin River vote to Dec. 11.
For a terrific backgrounder on the water issue, read this August piece by @dakasler and @RyanSabalow. https://t.co/N4jSHr2gJI
Some @CaWaterBoards members - gubernatorial appointees - are considering voting today on the Lower San Joaquin plan despite the postponement request from Brown and Newsom.

The transition has begun. @CaWaterBoards Vice Chair Steven Moore asks, even if Brown commits to 35 days at most on Lower San Joaquin, how can you be sure Newsom won't want more time? "I can't speak for the Gov-elect, I wouldn't presume to," Brown's CDFW director says.
At @CaWaterBoards meeting, Chuck Bonham repeatedly says Brown administration will not seek another delay on Lower San Joaquin water vote. "The governor and governor-elect are the right leaders at the right time in the most amazing state in the United States of America."

From my 4 a.m. State Senate update: Democrats appear to be heading toward a supermajority. Hurtado (D) has extended her lead over incumbent Vidak (R) 52-48. Caballero (D) has a 1-point lead over Poythress (R), which would give Dems a 28th seat, one more than needed for 2/3.
Assembly update: Dems appear to be at 57 at the moment, with some races still undecided. If they remain at 57, that would tie the Assembly Dems' highest mark with the 1977-78 session. (Which I was alive for, but too young to remember.)

In the California Senate supermajority watch, Hurtado (D) now has a ~1,000 vote lead over incumbent Vidak (R) in SD14. Poythress (R) leads Caballero (D) in SD12. Dems need one for 27th seat.

"Best Republican budget since Pete Wilson" observation came from former GOP legislator Bob Naylor. #cabudget
Questioner at CalChamber lunch tells Ana Matosantos that Brown #cabudget is "the best Republican budget since Pete Wilson."
@SenDeSaulnier Thanks for participating!
It's believed to be the first time since Gov. Gray Davis in 2001 that a CA governor declared a structurally balanced #cabudget.
HHS advocates say Brown budget "lacks a vision for the future about how we will help the millions of CAs..unemployed or living in poverty."
In statement, UC says it will "explore every opportunity" to keep tuition flat but that "in the end" UC must maintain its high quality.
@willcarless It includes deferrals, which are no longer as large as $10b. Brown projects $5.6b at end of 13-14 and 0 by end of 16-17.
Brown #cabudget director Matosantos confirms that $450m P39 clean energy money is counting toward Prop 98. CTA is not happy with that.
Brown's #cabudget would save $60m from enterprise zone restrictions, including a 1-year limit for employers to claim tax credits.
Governor sees paying down wall of debt as a buffer against revenue downturn, suggesting state could tap borrowing capacity at later date.

LAO: Finance's new accounting method introduces more problems to #cabudget process than it's worth. Could result in $Bs in late adjustments.
Analyst says Brown's Finance Dept. recently found $1.4B thru an accounting change in #cabudget. Deficit would otherwise be higher.
Analyst says could be #cabudget surpluses starting in 14-15 of $1B growing to $9B+ in 17-18. Based on keeping programs at current levels.

@jwenger15 It's campaign season. The time of year when context and nuance goes out the window.
@jwenger15 @aaronmclear Which, by the way, was obvious if you had read the full context of the quotes I used and understand Prop 98.
@jwenger15 @aaronmclear It's a baseline issue for optics purposes. CSBA claims that nothing is new money until P98 reaches nearly $60B.
@jwenger15 @aaronmclear Additional GF does generate more money for schools under Prop98, which is why I said the claim was misleading.
@aaronmclear It'd be like if I got a pay cut three years ago. Then my pay got restored this year, and I said that wasn't new money.
.@aaronmclear Note that the second part of that quote was: "Instead, it bolsters the General Fund with new revenue."
.@aaronmclear CSBA doesn't count any $ as "new money" until K-14 funding gets above where it would've been absent Schwarzenegger's P98 cuts.
@Ryan_Lillis That's like my kid with his Elmo doll. Though he only waited 2 years for that.
@CapitolAlert @journalistnate I'm confident my posts on Prop98 and maintenance factor will push me past a longtime Sacto TV personality.

For UC and CSU to benefit in future years, it will also take actions by "Sacramento politicians."
Clarifying - for UC and CSU to benefit from Prop30 this year, it took previous actions by "Sacramento politicians" in June.
In one ad, Brown bemoans college tuition hikes. But UC and CSU can't benefit from Prop30 w/o budget actions by "Sacramento politicians."
@scottlay It's what some might call too cute by half. Especially since Guv says his is better than P38 b/c it helps rest of GF budget.
Though P30 funds go to schools, they count as GF revs for P98 purposes. Lawmakers can simply redirect other revenues for other purposes.

@johnmyers Regardless, your first point is right - if they're getting more from tax version 2, in theory the K-14 guarantee would be higher.
@johnmyers Undoubtedly worth more than v1, but v1 wouldn't be worth the $6.9b initially claimed under today's revenue picture.
@johnmyers I'm curious how they could stick w/ $9B in tax version 2 if the underlying assumptions used before are now proven too rosy.
The revised $16B deficit would've been even worse if Brown weren't counting on $1.5B from Facebook IPO. http://t.co/6FWtJnpA #cabudget
@munilass Thanks for the recommendation. Monday should be interesting.
Coming up for air. FWIW, $16B is about the same amount of solutions they enacted last year ignoring the happy revenue spikes. #cabudget
@JewettCW Hey, happy birthday! Thanks for the #FF
Under pressure from health advocates, Brown bounces controversial Prop 29 doctor from state board. Also axes 5 others. http://t.co/f67FdFDM
Molly Munger chipped in another $1.1M for her tax initiative, according to a filing posted today. $8.3M total so far. #cabudget
Asked if $1.4B in affordable housing $ will definitely go for #cabudget relief, Steinberg says no, but "certainly a very ripe candidate."
Steinberg says it is "appropriate" to discuss w/ unions cuts to state workers, but "I don't think it should be done unilaterally." #cabudget
Steinberg on Monday #cabudget revise: "We all expect the news to be rough, that's no secret..We know that there will be a significant gap."
@cccbudgetnews Late morning.
Billionaire hedge-fund manager Steyer to cut $20M check today for his corporate tax hike initiative campaign. http://t.co/R8zXun3z #cabudget
@jfdulac Maybe not gangsta. But apparently some ganging up goes on there.
@jfdulac So Cranbrook actually exists in Michigan? I thought Eminem just made that up in 8 Mile.
RT @AnthonyYorkLAT: Dem consultant Ace Smith and SCN campaigns will be the lead consultants on gov's tax measure. Smith ran Brown's 2006 ...
@KPCCjulie Thanks, Julie, but most of the credit should go to @TheStateWorker for today's scoop.
Breaking: Gov. Brown has told state worker unions to brace for compensation cuts up to 10% in May #cabudget. http://t.co/AZOpQWlO
Such loyalty in Newsom's shop. Someone there just spelled out an e-mail address for me saying, "That's 'T' as in Tom and 'G' as in Gavin."
CSU Chancellor Reed says his preference is to keep undergrad tuition low but look at raising masters/professional degree costs. #cabudget
CSU officials tell trustees it is likely the system could face an additional cut and/or trigger cut given #cabudget revenues falling short.
Despite dreary review of Sacramento arena deal, economist Thornberg seems somewhat optimistic about CA economy in latest Controller release.
@RobStutzman I think she was describing a campaign cease-fire, like what Willie described Sunday. She may think hers wins, Brown's loses.
@RobStutzman Not sure whether just some or all of PIT would chapter out. As you could tell, Munger didn't offer many specifics on strategy.
Posted more on UC nonresident admissions that we couldn't fit in today's story. UCSD is worth watching. http://t.co/LGcBN2sq #cabudget
Rating agency Moody's says it likes plan to give UCs more local control because it would let them "better utilize their market potential."
From our story on UC's non-resident growth: Between 2009-11, 1k fewer CAs &amp; 1k more non-CAs made up UCB's frosh class. http://t.co/vlCyUhER

LAO recommends Legislature allow K-12 districts to cut the school year further and relax rules for laying off teachers midyear. #cabudget
LAO says nearly 90% of surveyed K-12 districts not planning to spend the money that Gov. Brown wants them to this fall. #cabudget
Clarification: LAO didn't change PIT/corp tax YTD shortfall of $3.45B. But it says overall GF shortfall $3B b/c sales tax/other is high.
Given revenues falling short, that $1.4B affordable housing money probably at risk. S&amp;P saw it as a possible #cabudget balancer today, too.
LAO revises estimates. Says state likely about $3B behind YTD in PIT and corp revenues (last week it estimated $3.45B). http://t.co/zhnB0vde
