The package of bills does not include the $5 billion Trump wants for the wall on the southern border. Democrats have remained committed to blocking any funding for the wall.
Democrats measure to re-open government. Fund the Department of Homeland Security @ current levels, with $1.3 billion for border security, through February 8th. Fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown. https://t.co/VPqliFSbQ4

Imagine the revolt against the republicans in the 2020 general election! https://t.co/HNwVnLaxox
@AgilePragmatism @thehill B good Johnny!
@AgilePragmatism @thehill The house will bring on impeachment procedure. Even if the senate attempt to cover Trump. The cost of votes against the republicans will be overwhelming in the general. Trump will still be indicted after his term in office.

@Diannedorsey14 @dcexaminer Can we move on Dianne? Trump has violated so many norm to profit. Has so many dual cases filed in both federal and state courts. Who is the crook? Hillary? I think not!
@Thankful4Usa @thehill Most bible thumpers are rude Americans. Some are Judges and rapist.
@DentonAsHeck @senorrinhatch You are lost. Those investigation was back ground check to get the job he currently have. The federal process works a bit different genius. Since he was picked for a supreme court appointment a back ground check is the norm. Please read and understand. It truly helps!

@Thankful4Usa @thehill Should I say thank you now? lol.
@Thankful4Usa @thehill Think it's in accordance with a constitutional right, you think?
@Diannedorsey14 @dcexaminer I'd rather use Graham words sham Republican puppet investigation. This is being conducted by limiting the abilities to have the officers follow all leads to this investigation.
@DentonAsHeck @senorrinhatch To set limitation on and investigation is to impede on a full and fair investigation. And FBI investigation should be conducted to where ever the evidence  and facts takes that officer. You won't understand that I assume.
@Drbankruptcy @Slate No. But to set limits on and investigation is to impede on the totality of a full and fair investigation.
@Thankful4Usa @thehill That's my opinion.
