Hatch: #S1696 wldn't reg abortion it wld regulate what states can &amp; cant pass right? #RepresentativeDemocracyFail #StatesRight #ProtectLife
Northup claims #ProLife laws go thru back door. No we use legal means. They use back door when EMTs fetch wmn after botched procedure #S1696
Really enjoying @GrassleyWorks in the Judiciary Committee hearing today on #S1696. He's out there to #protectlife.
Heaven forbid states pass laws that reflect views &amp; values of the citizens who live in them! Clearly, representative govt is hard for left.
I hate left's line of thinking that poor women MUST have abortion, b/c they think those women shldn't be having babies at all. #ProtectLife
.@CarolTobias1: drafters of #S1696 must think that women should be completely shielded from all the information about abortion. #protectlife
Chu states #prolife ppl want "unlicensed docs" to preform abortions. UH NO Thats YOUR state that allows nurses &amp; non-docs to commit. #S1696
#S1696 is a radical pro-abortion bill, not women's health. Empowers abortionist to perform abortion at ANY point before birth. #protectlife
States' rights mean nothing to the left. States want to #protectlife. #S1696 shows absolute govt intrusion by wanting to supersede states
Hey, Tammy Baldwin, #abortion is not "high quality health care" by any means. Actually, it's not even health care. #S1696 #protectlife
.@GrassleyOffice keeps focus on what will happen if #S1696 is rammed thru: dying women &amp; babies at hands of ppl like #gosnell. #protectlife
