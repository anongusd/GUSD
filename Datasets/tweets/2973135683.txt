Did we know Bernie went to college in Brooklyn in 2016? Did we know he came from a family that was "economically challenged"? 		You know, bc identity politics.
Bernie Sanders is an asshole of epic proportions and I'm too fucking tired to explain why to people who ask. If you have to ask, then you're an asshole too. 		Listen to Black women. 		Pay attention to his record. 		His voice and his antics are as annoying as Trump's.
I just tweeted that the 2020 race is indicative of men not knowing how to get out of a woman's way. And ANY MAN who is running, IMO, does NOT stand for equality for women if they don't think it's time for a woman to be president. 		Don't @ me about identity politics.

@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf With all due respect, this is "All-ism"		I stand with needing to really listen to Black people. And as White women (I'm assuming again) we really need to listen to Black women
@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf Black people don't need to be taught how painful it is to be Black. 		But I understand your lesson and what you got from it. I respect that. Sounds like it gave you some good perspective.
This brings me so much joy, I can barely contain it. IT CAN HAPPEN PEOPLE! https://t.co/TFlvmvQqT8

@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf I have no more patience for doubt anymore, not in today's climate. That's just where I'm at. 		I prefer equity over equality. But yes, we both want a better world. Peace to you.
@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf Often, historical context is left out of current discussions and situations. From this perspective, it may not always be about intent, per se, but one of education and insight. And most importantly, self-reflection and examination.
@ThatAintRight4 @AngryBlackLady Thank you.
@TungstenPoles @AngryBlackLady Thank you.
@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf That's a perspective to have. I disagree. As first lady, she is not independent in her actions as they reflect what her position represents. There's a responsibility to be respected.
@Hulcricket @AngryBlackLady Ok, thanks.
@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf I wasn't accusing you, I was simply asking for clarification. 		And being raised in a white supremacy provides us, as white people (I'm assuming you're white) levels of privilege that lends itself to racist thinking. It's deep and has many layers. Of which, deserve exploration.
@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf But context. Her husband was just called our for blackface. I mean, think it through. How can this be denied that it was offensive and wrong?
@AngryBlackLady What exactly is snitch tagging?
@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf Are you saying you're colorblind?
@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf And knowing how to pick cotton or not doesn't erase the fact that white women need to confront their own racism. 		Facts. If this bothers you, then it might be worthwhile to examine that. If it doesn't bother you, then cool beans.
@MysticMous @Ummismaelsf That's really nice. Thanks for sharing. I didn't say that learning how to pick cotton was racist. I said that it's racist to hand Black kids cotton and ask them to imagine being enslaved people. (she said slaves). Symbolism and connotation matter, dear.

Seriously, what's the point of effortfully trying to get more followers on here? Am I missing something?

@jwheels74 calling out systemic racism and looking at racism in the historical context it deserves. Many WP are completely ignorant to this, not excusing, but everything in our culture is so whitewashed, inc. education.
@jwheels74 I call it conscious living. To be aware, honest, and humble when confronting my own racism as a white person and then calling others out on it when I see it. But one thing worries me, we are so focused on racism being taught, etc and keep it on a micro level and that def neglects

@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell Yes, agreed. I include "teachable" in my personal growth repertoire. A large part of this for me is listening.
@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell No, bc racism in AmeriKKKa involves a power structure. Prejudice and racism are two different things when it comes to their etiology. Historical context is key.
@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell Yup. But I live consciously and do my best to listen, read, and stay open. I work to un-do this daily.
@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell Why "defend" your character. Just be who you are. You'll get called on your shit, then you look at that shit. Be real, right? If you're an asshole, and you strive to change, you will.
@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST!! WP HATE to hear this and get all ugly defensive. Until we admit this, confront this, do the work to undo this, we will continue in the power structure that exists. Which is EXACLY why the ugly defense comes up. WP LOOOOVE their privilege!
@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell If we continue to claim ignorance for our racism, then when do we find the catalyst to change? It falls in the same category as:	-Well, they were young, or	-It was just a joke	All dangerous to accept and it's time to stop.
@wisdomstatement I wholeheartedly support this!!
@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell If one feels the need to state they aren't racist, then they probably are.
@wisdomstatement I would so offer you one if I could. Just so you know that.
@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell Things to consider: Why is it ONLY white people who say this? WHY are they even saying it? The context is usually in defense of their racism in the first place.
@scotticephoto @ZerlinaMaxwell No, it's not. It's code for being racist. It's dismissive of the entire experience and existence of POC. It's crafty wording; much more dangerous than simply imperfect. Racism has ugly tentacles. We need to stop excusing it in every form.

@SiaKordestani As with anything, there is good and bad, what's worked, what hasn't. Ego's, money, notoriety all play roles that cause splintering. The Nation of Islam has done some amazing things within the Black community and within prisons. Are there parts and people of The Nation
@SiaKordestani Thank you for providing the links. I stand with my original sentiment. In summary, EVERYTHING in this country is layered with the very racism that created its capital. Many movements/approaches/activists have come and gone with regards on how to undo this web of oppression.
@SiaKordestani This supports my take that this is all about powerful WOC speaking out against injustice, rather than actual anti-Semitism. Oh, and I'm Jewish btw, FWTW.
@SiaKordestani Other than Alyssa Milano's statements, I'm not aware of any of the other mentions. I welcome links.
@SiaKordestani SPLC partnered with The Women's March in 2017. Did I miss something since then bc I follow them on the reg and didn't see anything condemning Linda or Tamika directly?
@Cakedaddy4ever @T_FisherKing Edgier. LOL.
@brujacontumbao @IBJIYONGI I understand. It was just the way she spoke it. It hit me a certain way. But therein lies my privilege, I get to get HIT with it instead of just "mm-hmm"-ing it. 		Still the same in 2019.

@avarant Well, I'm Jewish and able to see this for what it seems to be. Which is yes, she is being treated differently than if her words came from a white man. I do think gender plays into it as well. All too often, criticism of anything related to Israel is misconstrued as anti-Semitic.

@Tennesseine Aw, that's my favorite age! That's when the play hide and seek and claim they are hiding by closing their eyes.
Thank you for letting me share. I hope this wasn't too triggering for anyone and that my story can shed some light on how very personal medical issues are between women and their healthcare providers. Peace and light.
It's angering, it's hurtful, it's suffocating. Men need to STFU and so do their blind sheep women who claim higher moral ground on situations that are none of their GD business.
The choices we, as mothers, as women, make regarding our bodies IS NO ONE'S BUSINESS BUT OUR OWN. The mere fact that there are legislation and discussion about the incredibly personal trials women go through makes me so angry I want to SCREAM!
I share this in response to the SOTU and trump's falsities regarding "late-term abortion". While, I suffered a stillborn, I was still profoundly triggered by his ignorance and that of many GOP members.
While still my favorite season, Spring has become a bittersweet time of the year. As daffodils push through the warming earth, I am reminded of a deep and primitive loss. It's a dichotomy that fills my heart and breaks it at the same time.
I went home that afternoon, April 3rd, 2006 empty-handed and heartbroken. We came to learn that at some point during that Friday and Sunday, Judah Lee Russell was asphyxiated by an unusually short umbilical cord. We buried his ashes 10 days later in a cruelly small coffin.
I held him to my aching breast, I bathed him in my tears. We dressed him in the outfit we were to take him home in. We gathered around his limp and lifeless body and said a prayer for the passing of his soul.
I used their power and their love, and they labored with me. 15 hours later, I delivered a beautiful 6 lb, 19 in PERFECT baby boy. His hair had tighter curls and his fingers were longer than that of his brothers. I studied every inch of his tiny body.
I called upon the countless mothers who have gone before me. I called upon my female ancestors. I called upon the strength and sweat of the thousands of women before me who have labored out babies from their wombs.
I decided to stay with my baby as long as I possibly could and that I would stay in labor as long as it would naturally take. It was the middle of the night. The mid-wife dimmed the lights. We lit candles.
I was being expected to process information my brain could not comprehend. My heart was in the process of shattering. This was incomprehensible. Literally.
I was then left with the decision of whether I wanted to continue with my labor, or if I wanted to have a C-section. My first thought was, GET THIS OUT OF ME!! GET THIS DEATH OUT OF MY BODY! I was scared. I was SO fucking scared.
I needed them to know that they were going to deliver healthy heart beating babies. I asked the nurse. She confirmed that new admissions were placed on a different part of the unit, farther away from my room.
I remember thinking, are there other mom's laboring near me? Can they hear my wails? Can they hear the possibility that they too, may have a dead baby inside of them?? I needed to know RIGHT THEN, that they were far away from me.
Fast forward thru the shock, the screams, the wails (I had no idea the human body could make the sounds coming out of my mouth), I was left with the realization that at 40 weeks pregnant, I had a dead baby in my womb.
"I'm sorry sis, your baby has died."
After what seemed like decades; after my yelling and questioning what was going on; after feeling my throat close and my heart rate increase, the doctor put his hand on my forehead and looked me directly into my eyes.
I vividly recall that no one provided me with the respect of eye contact as they were frantically trying to find my baby's heartbeat. They called in a doctor. They brought in a new machine. Same story.
It might be the machine, she said. We've been having trouble with this one, she said. I thought that's a polite answer as my gut began speaking to me. She called in another nurse. Same story. My husband (at the time) became frantic. No one would look at me.
She glided it to the side, over to the other side, under the belly. We talked baby names, hopes, dreams. We laughed. She pressed harder. Our tone changed. I asked, "Have you found the heartbeat?". I didn't hear anything. I knew the answer.
Upon arrival, I was greeted with the warmth and smiles typical of the ethos on an L&amp;D unit. After all, this is where life begins. I was checked in and again, the monitor was strapped to my bulging belly. I talked casually with the nurse as she glided the sonogram around.
That night, I went to bed and awoke in excruciating pain. I waited it out. I counted bw contractions. I sweat, cried, rocked back and forth, and came to the conclusion that it was time to return to the hospital. This was Sunday morning.
That Saturday, I sat on my porch. It was sunny that day. I waved at people outside and said, "Come labor with your neighbor". They did. We sat and talked and laughed. My toddler son ran around with other neighbor children.
The contractions were strong, but not consistent. I was advised to take hot showers, stimulate my nipples, and walk. I walked. I waddled and I walked. A few hours passed and I was advised to go home and return when the contractions were 2-3 minutes apart.
I'm going to share a very personal story. (Thread)		In the chill of early Spring, on a rainy Friday in 2006, I went to the hospital ready to deliver my second baby. I was admitted and hooked up to the monitor and quickly heard the rapid pulse of my baby's heartbeat.

@BlerdMommy True. Are we great again yet??? 😢😡😠
As Angela Davis stated, we must pull this shit up by the ROOT. Dig deep and begin an honest discussion of how horribly dangerous and damning #Blackface is. This is a discussion for white people. Black people already know. (10)
This history is VITAL and must be discussed and addressed. Racism weaves its ugly tentacles into every system, and then oozes back out to society fooling us to think it simply exists on a micro level only. Blackface. Hate crimes. Trump supporters. (9)
When we say #BlackLivesMatter, this is one of the many many reasons why. To view these recent happenings as JUST blackface; to watch MSM keep their discussions at resignation or not, we will continue to perpetuate these dangerous disparities. (8)
So when we see a medical student, who has gone on to become an elected official, combined with the racist history of medical institutions and practice, LIE about his own racism, the danger continues. DEATH happens. (7)
When we hear about the modern day, CURRENT, medical disparities, especially among Black women, we can tie it back to the etiology of the medical field. (6)
Early medical theories laid the groundwork that Black people were different species, essentially, allowing for medicine to grow from an ethos of racism. (5)		A great piece on this: https://t.co/NhERxQTM1m
Racial difference was introduced to the medical field in the 1790s, by Benjamin Rush, a medical professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He taught his students that blackness was to be cured. (4)
No anesthesia, no pain meds. EXPERIMENTS. SURGICAL EXPERIMENTS. Slaves were property. Not humans. He is touted as a gynecological HERO (3) https://t.co/skyV0SlE3D
Pain is dismissed, symptoms are dismissed, REALITY is dismissed. This goes back to not seeing Black women (people) as HUMAN. This goes back to Dr. Sims experiments on Black women who were enslaved. (2)
The part that is so damning about #Northam's blackface with re: to the medical field is there is empirical evidence that Black women are dismissed and mistreated by medical Dr's across the board. (1)
@Bukalove04 I don't get it either. I don't think it is of our essence to hate like that, but alas, it gets taught and becomes part of one's fiber. It's always boggled me. Actually, it depresses me. 	(you can stay on that box all you like.)

@ErikVale2929 @Thisizhowwedoit @marclamonthill @IlhanMN We can respectfully agree to disagree! However, the narrative of being anti-Israel being the same as anti-Semitic is dangerous. If I'm misreading your intent, my apologies.
@KevasRobert @mommamia1217 Question since I'm not entirely Twitter savvy: How do I know if someone is a bot or not? Not all assholes are bots.
@ErikVale2929 @marclamonthill @IlhanMN I'm assuming. Just like you. Her reasons for apologizing are irrelevant to the fact that her criticism does not mean she is anti-semitic. This is tiring.
@Thisizhowwedoit @ErikVale2929 @marclamonthill @IlhanMN Apparently. Sigh...
I am seeking admiration and awe for the fact that I got up at 4:30 am in the bitter cold to get my sagging ass to the gym. Thanks in advance.
@ErikVale2929 @marclamonthill @IlhanMN Her "apology" was political and I don't find her statements to be anti-Semitic. She's speaking of human rights violations. Of which, Israel is guilty of.
@michellebhasin What about A Wrinkle in Time?
Speaking against Israel's policies regarding Palestinian's human rights does not make one anti-Semitic. This is a dangerous, divisive, and false narrative. I fully support and respect @IlhanMN https://t.co/pfE2RAfq2P

I am always willing and happy to chat one on one about other women's process with anti-racist work. Feel free to inbox me (WOMEN ONLY) and we can learn and grow together. (16)
Follow amazing WOC on here and LISTEN. I won't tag the women I follow out of respect, but please look at who I follow and who other feminists follow. AND THEN FOLLOW AND LISTEN. (15)
The most emphatic suggestion I can make, the one in which I have grown the most from thruout my years is to LISTEN TO WOC. Listen to their experience, their hurt, their anger, THEIR ANGER. Don't get all sensitive and emotional. Remember, we can fuck off with our tears. (14)
READ. READ. READ. I'll leave a list of books I've personally read that enlightened and inspired me. PLEASE ADD TO MY LIST. I'm stay learning. (13)
Baltimore and Oakland have some great programs. Be willing to travel. MAKE IT WORK. Many programs have sliding fee scales. Local people often host those who travel. MAKE IT WORK. (12)
If you are truly committed to anti-racism and feminism, this is vital work. Take a workshop. There are many. Ask around, do your research. Pay the money. Just shut up and do it. https://t.co/mlvW2MJnTp is a great place to start. Check your localities.(11)
THAT IS NOT THEIR ROLE. SOCIETY HAS MOLDED WOC TO TAKE CARE OF US. Let's have some respect and keep our tears for our therapists. Find a good therapist who is VERSED and EDUCATED on Relational-Cultural Therapy. (10)
DO NOT depend on WOC for information or suggestions. That is not their job. They are not responsible for our tears or our education. Don't even try it. There are 2 responses you will get. 1) WOC will tell us to fuck off or 2) WOC will comfort us. In regard to the latter, (9)
We've got a rough coupla years ahead of us. The more aligned we are the more successful we'll be. Infighting, denial, defensiveness: we ain't got time for this shit. TAKE THIS SHIT TO THERAPY. LISTEN TO PREDECESSORS. GET HUMBLE. RESEARCH. READ. (8)
Find support from other white fems who are already IN this process. We can hold each other accountable and discover ways to be more aligned with the movement, rather than working against it due to our own fragile egos. (7)
We can't fight a system when we don't acknowledge our role in the system. This process can be painful and humbling. I suggest here to NOT tweet about it, NOT talk about it with WOC, but to talk amongst ourselves within OUR OWN community. (6)
I suggest workshops, therapy, reading, LISTENING to WOC, and whatever it takes to look deeply within at our own racism. If you stop here and say, "Well, I'm not racist" then move along, this isn't for you. You are not liberal or progressive. You are a social conservative. Bye.(5)
We will remain a feckless group of annoying chatterboxes that will offend, insult, and perpetuate all that we claim to fight: racism, sexism, misogyny, patriarchy; until we get in touch with OUR OWN internalized shit first. Until we confront this, we will remain feckless. (4)
Instead of coming across as judgy, I hope I can simply provide suggestions and some provocation of thought that allows for some growth, in turn, lending that growth to turn into action beyond keyboard whispers of "resistance" (3)
I've seen a lot of white women who claim to be "woke" (I'm tired of this word as it's been appropriated to the point where it's simply lost meaning). These women are sleeping. Unaware and Unawake. (2)
I've got some things to say FWIW. I will leave references thruout this thread. Anyone is welcome to comment, but I am mostly speaking to WHITE WOMEN who identify as #ResisterSisters, #Liberal, #progressive, #Feminist, or #IntersectionalFeminists. (ESPECIALLY THE LATTER).
@jackjonesbabe I'll say this now. I WILL NOT SURVIVE this again. What the various haters are doing to Kamala right now... The repeat of 2016 bullshit. I will NOT survive the outcome if their antics work again. WE HAVE TO FIGHT THIS!!
You know what depresses me the MOST?? If @HillaryClinton were our JUSTIFIED president right now, how much better our #SOTU would actually be. I mean, just think about it. Then, after thinking, stay away from sharps and shoelaces. 😭😭
@jackjonesbabe This makes me want to simultaneously cry and drink a cup of coffee. 		The injustices are so depressing. 		Just imagine our country if she were our president?? Sometimes, I can't even go there.

Learning of #LaraTrump's existence is like finding another cockroach in the kitchen.
@CB_sings Right. Nothing complicated about White Supremacy and Patriarchy. This flitting around the issue is stale and it's time MSM steps up.
@jennywo21 I didn't even know she lived. It's like finding another cockroach in the kitchen.
@Frenchie1904 I keep getting stuck on the fact that they were brought to DC to protest women's healthcare. It just gets more and more assinine and angering from there.
