I sign this legislation with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families https://t.co/JPyCrsdqcF
By enacting this legislation we take an important step in protecting the unborn, while still providing an exception for life of the mother
Some most precious moments as Governor have been w/ families of children w/ disabilities, especially those raising children w/ Down syndrome
I believe that a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable - the aged, the infirm, the disabled and the unborn.
HEA 1337 is a comprehensive pro-life measure that affirms the value of all human life, which is why I signed it into law
Hoosiers may be assured that my admin will always be vigilant to preserve government accountability and the public’s right to know
Limiting access to police records when private university police depts perform govt function is disservice to public/barrier to transparency
Throughout my public career, I have long believed in the public’s right to know and a free and independent press
Today I vetoed House Enrolled Act 1022, a bill that would limit transparency at private universities https://t.co/KOv23hPBhX
IDEM must have necessary flexibility to take action to protect Hoosiers. Read more about my veto of HEA 1082 here: https://t.co/7P8wv7nit8
W/ veto, we’ll cont. to have necessary discretion/flexibility to create IN solutions at state level, act timely to protect drinking water
House Enrolled Act 1082 restricts IN Dept of Environmental Management’s ability to act, imposes unnecessary delay in its rulemaking process

Today, I vetoed HEA 1082, which may have lessened the ability to maintain clean and safe drinking water

I know our third century will be the greatest Indiana century yet. #INSOTS
God has blessed Indiana, and I believe he will continue to shine his grace on this great state.
But for all our successes and for all our challenges, I truly believe our best days are ahead. #INSOTS
If we confront the challenges before us w/ common sense &amp; craft IN solutions to improve the lives of Hoosiers, we will move forward together
The issues confronting our state are complex, but I believe if we hew to our roots, stand firm on freedoms bequeathed to us by our founders
I will not support any bill that diminishes the religious freedom of Hoosiers.
I will always give careful consideration to any bill #INLegis sends me, but legislation must be consistent with the Indiana Constitution.
Hoosiers also cherish faith and the freedom to live out their faith in their daily lives.
We are an open and welcoming state that respects everyone. And anybody who doesn't know that doesn't know Indiana.
I believe that no one should be harassed or mistreated because of who they are, who they love, or what they believe
I was raised, like most Hoosiers, on the Golden Rule. That you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Hoosiers don't tolerate discrimination against anybody. And Hoosiers cherish faith and the freedoms enshrined in our constitution
We have to make sure families have more options for treatment and somewhere to go when a loved one is caught up in drug addiction

It is clear that by raising education standards in Indiana, we are setting the bar high for Hoosier students
Our student proficiency ratings continue to outpace the national average and IN now ranks well above the national average at every level
This success is testament to world-class teachers in classrooms all across IN, working each &amp; every day to inspire students to be successful
Indiana's kids and teachers have once again outperformed their peers in this year's 'national report card' https://t.co/5KR7a9LVKQ

I'm confident that by removing this financial impediment to hiring, Hoosiers will continue to see economic opportunity all across our state
Removing this tax penalty for employers frees up resources to invest in hiring new employees, growing existing companies, and raising wages
IN has worked hard to ensure opportunity for all and announcements like today's will go a long way to promote economic growth for Hoosiers
This action will continue IN's economic momentum by taking $327 million in new hiring taxes off the table - equating to $126 per employee
I’ve directed that sufficient resources be advanced to @WorkOneWorks to eliminate IN's outstanding unemployment loan balance prior to Nov.10
I’m proud to announce that bc of our prudent fiscal management, IN will eliminate a tax on hiring for employers https://t.co/R2ptSJwaCt

RT @INDOT: 21st Century Crossroads will provide $1 Billion in road and bridge preservation without raising taxes.
As I said here 18 months ago, roads mean jobs. If we are to remain the Crossroads of America, we need the roads and bridges to back it up
This funding will put @INDOT on a path to resurface an addl 1800 miles of state highways &amp; repair 220 addl bridges over the next 4 years

Read my full response to the EPA issuing its final regs limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants: http://t.co/jB5ElFnjhe
IN will cont to vigorously challenge legality of this rule in fed courts. Far too much is at stake for jobs/econ for us to do anything less
My Admin will carefully review the final rule...if the final rule is not significantly improved, Hoosiers can be assured IN will not comply
When it comes to energy policy, this Admin continues to place its environ agenda ahead of interests of Hoosier ratepayers, jobs &amp; the econ.
