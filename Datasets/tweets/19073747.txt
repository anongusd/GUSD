Are you actually awake right now? If so, listen to me co-host #TriviaWeekend with @ovie21 from 5-7am on @kvsc881fm or at www.kvsc.org
One of our #triviaweekend volunteers just askd me when the cheddar bay biscuits are arriving while wiping pizza sauce off his face. Spoiled?
@kylerburgi That's easy. My favorite kind of shot is VanderLeest vodka (pronounced "Van-deer-list")
My job for the next 50 hours: make sure hundreds of #TriviaWeekend volunteers don't starve. Luckily, 40 businesses are donating food!
#TriviaWeekend I'm not on a team but please say something encouraging to me!
RT @KVSCnews: More teams than last year! Spandex everywhere! The planets are aligning for Superheroes of #Trivia! http://bit.ly/hCJmhF
@PeterChristian @rakibird @kevpaz After waking up at noon on a Sunday, "By the time I'm 30, I'll be married with kids" - hungover T-Bone, 28
@PeterChristian HAHA! Precisely. I would need 1,400 characters to tackle that task.
@kvsc881fm Our station's signature event, the 32nd Annual Trivia Weekend, begins tomorrow at 5pm. Tune in to the amazing 50 hour production!
@PeterChristian @kevpaz T-bone update: father of 2 girls, pharmaceutical salesman in Rockford, IL. Still completely full of hot air.
There's one thing about certain sports reporters that really irks me: http://duffysdrivel.wordpress.com/

@eric_wheeler I'm surprised our run isn't one of the top trending topics worldwide.
RT @eric_wheeler: Just completed a 4.43 mi run - Another run with @cmduffy82... F-ing COLD out! . http://rnkpr.com/af6guu #RunKeeper
@PeterChristian @kevpaz I enjoyed reading that exchange. T-Bone is the greatest show on paper. Dierks is the greatest show on stage.
Best 10 seconds of TV ever: John Madden trying to sext while sitting next to George W followed by Cameron Diaz feeding grapes to King A-Rod.
Cheering for the #Packers will be more difficult than I thought. I want their fans to feel what I felt two weeks ago. Is that twisted?

Just finished up a new promotional video for Torborg Builders' Sundance Villa Townhomes in Sartell, MN: http://bit.ly/fCz1Ow
Thank you Grey's Anatomy for teaching me the joys #twitter can bring to my life.
"And now Deep Thoughts... by Chris Duffy." http://duffysdrivel.wordpress.com/
Remember SNL's "Deep Thought's by Jack Handey?" This is the only time I'll ever try to match his wit: http://duffysdrivel.wordpress.com/

RT @artofthemuses: Watching @hockeyhairall perform at open mic. Rocking to an acoustic version of tiny dancer.
@JoMcB: I like Dirty Finger! We also had a suggestion from a crowd member: "Bear with us," a phrase we used more than once during the show!
@mwmicrobrews @_ChopLiver_ Check out my coverage of this weekend's 1st Annual St. Cloud Craft Beer Expo: http://bit.ly/hdJOSg
I'm a #Bears fan, but I'll cheer for the #Packers in the super bowl. Why? Find out in my latest blog! http://duffysdrivel.wordpress.com/
It stings, but I still feel lucky to live in the midwest and be a part of the best 3-way rivalry in all of sports. #Bears #Packers #Vikings
@mattbishop2 Bears 23, Packers 20. How about you?
@mwmicrobrews 2,300+ attended tonight's first annual St. Cloud Craft Beer Expo! That's 1,000 more than anticipated! Expect pics soon!
@_ChopLiver_ Excited for the St. Cloud Craft Beer Festival! I'll be playing music for @kvsc881fm and taking pictures for @mwmicrobrews
Best monologue ever by @HerdOnESPNRadio!  He said if the #Bears win, they will be the "worst super bowl team in the history of the #NFL."
Excited @DierksBentley is coming back to MN! Buying tickets tomorrow!
@AdamAaro I told him I once spent an entire Christmas playing Guitar Hero with you and he immediately asked me to jam the mic in his face.
@kylerburgi HA! Very difficult to get reaction from both sides when most everyone takes the "for" stance with sex offenders.
@mwmicrobrews My business card says "Minnesota Regional Director." It is offensive when my direct superior can't even get my title right.
@ovie21 The conversations we have are my main source of inspiration. This blog is no different.
If you can work a room at a party you can probably conduct a good interview. Read more in my latest blog! http://duffysdrivel.wordpress.com/
This just in: Troy Aikman and Aaron Rodgers have moved in together. They are in love.
The #Bears live to see another week! Can't wait to watch the greatest rivalry in all of sports next Sunday!
@kylerburgi Is that bad that I didn't know you were in CO? You need to update me on your life. Include recent thoughts on love & heartache.
@PeterChristian Luckily it's not Cutler's personality that will be taking the #Bears to the super bowl!
@eric_wheeler I didn't see this until today. Was there something on this site yesterday I should have seen?
This article sums up my thoughts on Jay #Cutler. I want to like him, but it's so difficult! http://es.pn/g2llMk #Bears

Should be cheering for the #Packers but finding it very difficult
@eric_wheeler This is great stuff! Thanks for passing it along. How was the Tweetup?

Thanks to the #Vikings for playing your hearts out and securing a 1st round bye for my #Bears! Is Joe Webb the next franchise quarterback?
@matt_smithWBAY I only miss it during the holidays. It would be nice to get that fat Christmas bonus check once more.
@MikeBennerKGW HA!  How are things in Port-Vegas?
@MikeBennerKGW Getting my master's and KVSC is the campus radio station. It doesn't compare to my "breaking city council now" reports in GB.
@matt_smithWBAY ...and at the end of the story, Biggest Loser contestants jumping on trampolines.
In the last decade, the Somali population in St. Cloud has swelled from virtually 0 to 7,000. Stay tuned for my full-length report on KVSC.

RT @jeremypiven: Please, EVERYONE keep sleeping on the Bears....
@ryanruud Thanks Ryan. Hell has officially frozen over. Do you have a blog?
@AdamAaro You're right. I wish the Bears were 5-9 with no hopes for the playoffs. That's a lot less stressful than WINNING THE DIVISION!!
4 hours from St. Cloud to TCF + 2.5 hours back home = totally worth it! The most fun I've ever had at a football game! #Bears #Vikings
Thanks to @ovie21 for hooking me up with tickets to see the Bears clinch tonight! #Bears #Vikings
@kylerburgi HA! I used to make it rain with $17.5 a year. I love the way he says "dissentary"... and a great use of awkward silences.
I hate the Packers, but I have to give them credit for almost beating the best team in the NFL with a 2nd string QB. #Packers #Patriots
After years of pessimism, I have started a blog. Thanks to @eric_wheeler & @hockeyhairall for the inspiration! http://bit.ly/dRwqhS
RT @KVSCnews: Our goal is to have 200 followers by January 1st. Help us reach our goal!!
Prediction for tomorrow's Vikings Bears game: Bears 76, Vikings 3
Help us out! We're looking for more followers for @KVSCnews
Just went exactly one year without tweeting. That is the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life!
At 325 lbs, DT Refrigerator Perry was considered abnormally huge when he joined the NFL in  '85. Today, he would be just above average.
will not follow Oprah's tweets. Must.... fight.... urge......

@mwmicrobrews Loved reading this one. Great descriptions... especially for the IPA. Suddenly I'm thirsty
@patrickstrother Great article Patrick. Thanks for posting that.
@benheins Ben, this is it! For the first time in my life, the Bears have a quarterback who's name doesn't trigger uncontrollable laughter.
CUTLER TO THE BEARS!!! CUTLER TO THE BEARS!!!
@mwmicrobrews I checked for you. Dane Cook DOES have a twitter account. You're welcome.
put his cell phone through the wash. It is cleaner than ever. But for some reason, it no longer works.
@mwmicrobrews HA!  I tried really hard to give him a chace bc I know he's trying hard. I quit after the second show.
Am I the only person in the world who has never watched an episode of Dancing with the Stars?
It's weird seeing a green upward-pointing arrow next to the dow!
@mwmicrobrews Natural lite? You?!?! I never thought I'd see the day. You must REALLY be sick!
@kylerburgi I have a very loud online presence but am extremely shy in real life. I'm thinking about golf too. When's your inagural round?
@PeterAndersen Thanks for your comment on the blog. That is the most intelligent thing I have ever heard you say.
@mwmicrobrews The media is an easy target because it's always in the spotlight. Someone has to stand up for you guys!
wrote an intelligent blog on my company's website today: http://www.scgpr.com/wordpress/?p=469
I'm going to Myrtle Beach, SC
To answer many questions, I'm not going to the North Pole, Northern Ireland, horseback riding with Dierks, or the red hair convention.

Darren Sharper is considering a move to Chicago. I wonder how many NFL players have played for 3 NFC North teams...
I couldn't do it. I only lasted 45 minutes. I must be addicted to twitter.

has never typed the acronym for "laughing out loud," and damn proud of it.
Universal cell phone chargers are coming soon. Thank GOD! http://tinyurl.com/d4av2g
First Michael Phelps, then A-Rod. It seems there remains only one chemical-free hero: Chuck Norris.
Target was filled to the brim with men buying last second V-day gifts. We're all the same...
Showers with two dials (one for hot, one for cold) degrade my intelligence because I can never figure them out.
Brilliant law school student turned comedian kicks off new show Wed. night on Comedy Central. Check out Demetri Martin's "Important Things."
ran 130 miles in January... my best month since college. Someday when I'm overweight, I'll look back at this with Bill Brasky-like awe.
The Bears just signed yet another sub-mediocre quarterback. They now have enough to occupy a small country.
If you like country music consider buying Dierks Bentley's new album, "Feel That Fire" tomorrow. The man is an amazing songwriter.
Facebook now has more than 150 million users. That's the equivalent of everyone in Canada having 5 facebook accounts!
