.@jasoninthehouse: Both DEA and ATF have told the IG they could not accomplish their missions without confidential informants.
.@jasoninthehouse: Whether paid or unpaid informants are a obviously valuable tool in investigations.

.@jasoninthehouse: But it could also be used by bad actors to harass or stalk individuals.
.@jasoninthehouse: Facial recognition technology is a powerful tool law enforcement can use to protect people and our nation.
.@jasoninthehouse: It would be one thing if facial recognition technology were perfect or near perfect, but it is not.
.@jasoninthehouse: 80% of the photos in the FBI‚Äôs face recognition network are of non-criminal entries, like photos from driver‚Äôs licenses.
.@jasoninthehouse: The FBI used facial recognition technology for 5 years without publishing the required privacy impact assessment.
.@jasoninthehouse: Unfortunately, the FBI failed to fulfill its statutory duty to inform the public of this new next level capability.
.@jasoninthehouse: 	In 2010, the FBI began replacing its fingerprint database with an updated database that incorporates facial recognition.
.@jasoninthehouse: Therefore, oversight of the use of this technology is essential.

.@jasoninthehouse: I am hopeful we can all continue to work together to see postal reform become law.
.@jasoninthehouse: The bill also helps the agency more accurately evaluate its cost structure, and reforms key governance matters.
.@jasoninthehouse: This bill gives the Postal Service the freedom it needs to successfully meet the business realities the agency faces.
.@jasoninthehouse: In an era of partisan politics, this legislation represents a significant bipartisan compromise.
.@jasoninthehouse: Building on our legislation from last Congress, last week we introduced H.R. 756, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2017.
.@jasoninthehouse: USPS cannot fully address its challenges WITHOUT legislative reform.
.@jasoninthehouse: USPS faces $119B in unfunded liabilities, including $52B in liabilities for just retiree health care.
.@jasoninthehouse: Since 2006, the annual volume of mail delivered by the Postal Service has declined by roughly 30 percent.
.@jasoninthehouse: and the taxpayers who will bear the burden if we fail to act.
.@jasoninthehouse: It‚Äôs up to THIS Congress to address the challenges facing USPS, its customers, the businesses that rely on it....

.@jasoninthehouse: Something needs to change fast. We can't turn a blind eye or discourage employees from reporting misconduct.
.@jasoninthehouse: Perhaps most troubling is the Service suffers from failures to maintain ethical standards at its highest levels.
.@jasoninthehouse: We are seeing how a disregard for EEO process leads to a culture that tolerates sexual harassment and retaliation.
.@jasoninthehouse: The Park Service has also poorly managed its equal employment opportunity program.
.@jasoninthehouse: In 2008, the IG determined Mr. Uberuaga unethically profited on the sale of land to a park concessioner who he oversaw.
.@jasoninthehouse: The superintendent of the Grand Canyon himself, David Uberuaga, had a history of inappropriate behavior.
.@jasoninthehouse: When employees suffer harassment, they are discouraged by management from reporting it &amp; sometimes retaliated against.
.@jasoninthehouse: These reports reveal the Park Service is failing to protect employees from sexual harassment.
.@jasoninthehouse: Department of the Interior Inspector General issued numerous reports highlighting how the agency is failing.
.@jasoninthehouse: multiple cases of serious and long-standing employee misconduct issues distract the agency from its mission.
.@jasoninthehouse: But instead of a celebration, we see an agency in crisis.
.@jasoninthehouse: 2016 represents 100 years since the Park Service was founded. This should be a milestone year.

.@HurdOnTheHill: taxpayers deserve a gov't that leverages technology to serve them, not one that deploys unsecure, decades old technology.
.@HurdOnTheHill: I hope to hear concrete steps USDS is taking to ensure they involve agency CIO‚Äôs when working on a project at an agency.
.@HurdOnTheHill: I'm concerned with potential duplication &amp; overlap. We are well aware of the cost associated with duplicative programs.
.@HurdOnTheHill: USDS was formed in the wake of the failure of https://t.co/WFExpr8ZVo to procure outside tech talent needed to run website.
.@HurdOnTheHill: I hope that we can gain a more transparent view of 18F‚Äôs mission and the full scope of their activities.

.@HurdOnTheHill: 18F was launched just over 2 years ago with 15 staff members. Today, they have 185 staff.
.@HurdOnTheHill: It should be much easier for startups and small companies to sell to and work with the federal government.
.@HurdOnTheHill: For real reform to happen, the government needs talented, experienced people to work on IT.

.@jasoninthehouse: @uscensusbureau estimated that its modernization efforts will cost around $548 million.
.@jasoninthehouse: @uscensusbureau is also experiencing problems related to the cost of its modernization effort.
.@jasoninthehouse: I hope one outcome of today‚Äôs hearing is that @uscensusbureau recognizes the need for a plan B.
.@jasoninthehouse: By all accounts, @uscensusbureau does not have a backup plan in place should its modernization efforts not be completed.
.@jasoninthehouse: @uscensusbureau is 0 for 17 in its efforts to execute final versions of the IT products necessary for modernization.
.@jasoninthehouse: However, in the @uscensusbureau's effort to cut the price tag, it may have bitten off more than it could chew.
.@jasoninthehouse: I appreciate @uscensusbureau taking steps to save taxpayer $ with new technologies to increase efficiency &amp; lower costs.
.@jasoninthehouse: Cost estimates for the 2020 census exceed $17 billion.

Enforcement is and must remain essential to combating this epidemic and stopping drugs from entering the U.S. is a federal responsibility.
And not only are illegal immigrants flowing over the Mexican border, but also illegal drugs.
The Obama Administration is sending mixed signals about the use of substances such as marijuana, which serve as gateways to heroin.
This impact is felt in communities throughout our nation.
On average, five people die per hour from a drug-related overdose.  If this hearing lasts two hours, ten Americans will die before it ends.
Today, drugs overdoses are the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S. In 2014, 10,000 Americans died of heroin-related overdoses.

.@jasoninthehouse: The speed at which online casinos operate, coupled w accessibility &amp; anonymity make it clear we need to understand more.
.@jasoninthehouse: Let's also understand that it's impossible to distinguish if it's a 7-year-old or someone of legal age.
.@jasoninthehouse: Congress must realize the implications of this #WireAct reversal.
.@jasoninthehouse: FBI says "many online casinos provide more opportunities for criminals to launder illicit proceeds w increased anonymity"
.@jasoninthehouse: Federal law enforcement has also expressed concerns about online gaming.
.@jasoninthehouse: A bipartisan group of 16 state attorneys general urged Congress to restore the interpretation of the #WireAct.
.@jasoninthehouse: This is a states rights issue. UT &amp; HI have no gaming. That's the purview of the individual state.
.@jasoninthehouse: The internet does not have walls around it.
.@jasoninthehouse: Anything connected to the internet - desktops, tablets, smartphones - no matter your age now can potentially be a casino.
.@jasoninthehouse: This has led to problems.
.@jasoninthehouse: The memo that reversed the wire act in 2011 declared that the wire act applied only to sports betting, not all betting
.@jasoninthehouse: The wire act, which prohibits using wires to gamble, was reversed in 2011
.@jasoninthehouse: For more than 50 years, we had the wire act, prohibiting gambling.

RT @RepBuddyCarter: TUNE IN: @GOPoversight will examine secure credentials issued by the GPO at 10:00 a.m. https://t.co/wc5LHtWLLn
This raises question as to whether Title 44 should be used to circumvent the full and open competition process to acquire secure credentials
GPO says its authorizing statute Title 44 allows it to issue secured creds bc the cards have print on them &amp; printing is a core function
GPO, however, provides secure credentials to an agency through a requisition form process.
Typically an agency seeking to contract with the private sector for a good or service must comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR)
Before GPO entered the RFID field in 2008, the cards were produced by federal contractors.
