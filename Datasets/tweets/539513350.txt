@Ruttiger101 @primalpoly @DanCrenshawTX Do you think, perhaps, that if we spent 28 years of focused research and development on Solar, collection, conversion, and storage, that we might come up with something safer, less damaging to the environment, and more efficient than Nuclear?
@Ruttiger101 @primalpoly @DanCrenshawTX There are roughly 450 extant reactors in the world.  Since Chernobyl there have been 115 serious accidents, and 1 critical accident, Fukushima.
