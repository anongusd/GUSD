@NBCNews What a big loss
Osun Picnic 2018
@IronStache What is the reason?
We used this medium to felicitate with our  Muslim Brothers and Sisters in the State of Indiana  on the auspicious occasion of this year Eid-el- Kabir celebrations. May Allah reward your sacrifice bountifully and preserve all of us to witness many of it. Amen
