And the SCO investigation is not over.   Flynn is still valuable for providing more truth about Trump's Fraudulent Campaign.
Funny - During the #CohenHearing, all the #Republicans are attacking Michael Cohen's credibility.   They are not disputing or calling out #Trump's fraudulent activities, but attacking #Cohen.  Why?  The Republicans are defending the activities surrounding a criminal #POTUS. 🤔
@Queen0fcups @Lazytncajun43 @KamVTV @Jim_Jordan Yeah - I don't see you or any of the Republicans disputing Cohen's testimony concerning Trump's activities.  Funny.

Btw - Trump University is fact. Right?  		Do you really want to know how much sh#t Trump as coming towards him?	https://t.co/nA7HMPccC4
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff Sorry - The only reason he re-opened the Govt was because his friends complained about the slow downs at NY/NJ airports. &lt;-- This is not good faith.   Remember - Trump said - "He'll own the Shutdown" and he still does.
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff Jaime - He didn't have much. The only thing Trump had - was the threat to shutdown the govt.  And, it was a stupid move.  He's a horrible poker player.
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff Jaime - You know about Trump University.  Right?  The trial was going to be in your backyard.  He settled - or caved... and paid $25million to avoid further penalties.  Essentially - Trump got caught stealing.  He's built his entire career on Fraud.
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff If you're a builder - you know how important a plan is.  And Trump didn't have one. He panicked because the Dems were showing up to take over.
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff Bingo - Then you know that's not how you estimate a project.  Trump didn't have any facts. no estimates, and no idea what he really wanted.  He just wanted a stupid Wall. 		He's built buildings in NY &amp; Chicago.  He's knows better.  He was just putting on a show for the his base.
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff Jaime - 89% is from the Union. That's complete BS.  I can tell you've never built or remodeled a home. I'm not saying that walls are bad.  Trump's process to secure funding was to Shutdown the Govt. That's horrible negotiating.  He put the country at risk. He's just a stupid Man.
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff No - that was the second bill w/ $2.9b that Pence tried to ushered through.   Where do you get your 90% figure from?  The Border Patrol Union?  Still - there was no plan on how to spend the Money.  That's completely Stupid. Example - Would you build a house w/out a plan?  No...
@TTJ_pa @TheLastRefuge2 @Techno_Fog OMG - Really - please don't fall for this garage. https://t.co/rW9aeYdehC
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff Not entirely correct. There was a bipartisan bill that passed the GOP held Senate, but Trump wouldn't sign it.  Then he made up a number - $5.7b w/out a plan to spend it. That's one of the reason why the Dems didn't show up. There was no PLAN on how to spend the money - None!
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff You're conflating again &amp; missing the point.  There was no reason to shutdown the Govt. Trump manufactured the crisis &amp; made it worst w/ a partial shutdown.  The only reason he re-opened the Govt was because his friends complained about the slow downs at NY/NJ airports.
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff Trump said he would own the #Shutdown.  Who's was originally going to pay for it?  Mexico - Right? Yes, there's crime in TJ, SD, and LA, but the Shutdown the Govt to fulfill a stupid campaign promise was completely moronic.  It put this country's borders and airports at risk.
@JaimeTaynor @KamVTV @RepAdamSchiff Wait. Your conflating topics. I don't give a rat's ass about tree huggers. Here's the deal: public property was vandalized because a petulant child didn't get his funding for a stupid border wall.  He created this fictitious crisis just to get his way. Trump is completely Stupid!

@MizAmerica3 @VANWHO @Rockprincess818 Doing nothing is a Moron's excuse.  It appears you have no understanding Canadian Gun Laws.		Comparisons?

@plozr10 @xode0000 Agreed - Immigration control is preferred by most Americans.  Not sure why you're bringing China into this.  Highly conflated point.		Go find out why Agnew resigned.  You will see the parallels with Trump.  You do understand that Trump has 17 investigations surrounding him.

@DolfanGary @Vickie627 @iknitsoidontki1 @RealKyleMorris @AlexisinNH They all can be relocated to a museum.   Richmond, Charlottesville, and Nashville have the most Confederate Statues remaining and local laws prevent them from being relocated.  They need to be removed from Public Spaces.  Right?
@DolfanGary @Vickie627 @iknitsoidontki1 @RealKyleMorris @AlexisinNH Virginia was one of the most racial states of the Confederate.  South Carolina and Texas was right up there.
@DolfanGary @Vickie627 @iknitsoidontki1 @RealKyleMorris @AlexisinNH Was Jefferson, Washington, Adams a Confederate?  No... Let's start with all the Confederate Representatives and Generals first.

@DolfanGary @Vickie627 @iknitsoidontki1 @RealKyleMorris @AlexisinNH Right, &amp; it was horrible. Right? Since all those Confederate Statues are an eyesore on American Democracy, it would be a good idea to do some remodeling of our public areas by removing them. However, some local laws prevent the removal,  so they must come down by another means.
@DolfanGary @Vickie627 @iknitsoidontki1 @RealKyleMorris @AlexisinNH Gary - You're completely wrong. The Confederates wanted to preserve property rights and at that time - Slaves were considered property.  		https://t.co/yfJkrTcsO9

@greg_gbag @JannaWilkinso69 No - I'm not a liberal.  I've voted Republican all my life except for the last 3 elections.  The turning point was during the Bush admin and the lies emanating from Cheney.  What sealed the deal to vote for a community organizer was McCain's choice for VP.

@greg_gbag @JannaWilkinso69 Many Many People?  Whom? Fox or Sean Hannity viewers?  Yes, I agree to disagree, but Trump should have kept his pie hole shut.   That's when the controversy was elevated.  Civility - Both sides need to watch the divisiveness and to keep the Russians out.

@MelissaTT2000 @travis_janes @RealKyleMorris Melissa - Worker pay and benefit are increasing.  It's a not all good.  There's a shortage of labor at the moment because of the drop in the unemployment.  If you track those figures - it started with Obama.  The bad aspects are inflationary trends and increase in interest rates.
@greg_gbag @JannaWilkinso69 Greg - Flash point for whom?  So, are you against a quiet protest against Police Brutality?

@JLD38e88 @ta193919632009 @USATrump45 @adjunctprofessr Jennifer - You're missing the point of the pay off.  The pay off was centered around keeping the story out of the media right before the 2016 Election... That's Campaign Fraud!!   Trump has built his entire career on Fraud.  		Prime example - Trump University...
@Bob__Harrison @Jali_Cat @rwhitmmx @POTUS Really - Where are the reports on that?  Lying under oath is pretty serious... I haven't heard anything...  Where did you get your info?
@JLD38e88 @ta193919632009 @USATrump45 @adjunctprofessr Jennifer - You said "I don't see a case of assault" - That's your opinion. All of the assaults have been investigated and Trump was involved with all of them.   		https://t.co/TxlpaJc5hy

Do you think it's Ok for men to assault women?   Let's go back to the Hollywood Access tape... Really? 		The pay off to Stormy and McDougal is under investigation as FRAUD.
@Bob__Harrison @Jali_Cat @rwhitmmx @POTUS Bob - Really, did you know that Clapper, Hayden, Brennan, Comey, and McCabe were all appointed under Republican Presidents first and most of them are Republicans.   Your opinion wasn't based upon any research or facts - is that Right?
