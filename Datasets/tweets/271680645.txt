Taxpayer-funded report on how Murphy team handled Katie Brennan rape allegation clears pretty much everyone https://t.co/wR0rCgRdWp
Responding to a question from Sen. Cunningham, whether Murphy could have hired Alvarez, Haynes says she doesn't know. "That wasn’t a part of the process, having the governor involved, And so, I don’t know. I would just be speculating."
Lawyer overseeing hiring for Murphy provides clues but doesn’t solve mystery over who hired staffer accused of rape https://t.co/Wnz0LfXMeM
Haynes testified that only Jose Lozano, transition chief; Pete Cammarano, chief of staff; or Matt Platkin, chief counsel, could have approved hiring of Al Alvarez. All three have testified they did not hire him. "I don't see another way" Alvarez could have been hired, she said.
Lynn Haynes, personnel director of the transition, told the committee that near the end of the transition, Alvarez told her he was being sent to SDA as chief of staff. Soon after, Jose Lozano, transition chief, confirmed that.
Former Chief of Staff Pete Cammarano has wrapped up his third appearance before the legislative committee investigating how Murphy's administration responded to a official's rape allegation against another staffer. Was generally a retread of his previous testimony.

"It’s almost an embarrassment that we can’t get that answered," Critchley said.
Attorney Michael Critchley, grilling Platkin on who hired Alvarez: "It seems to be a secret," Critchley said. "If it’s a secret, why is it a secret? ... We don't want to find out who brought the concrete slabs to Stonehenge. We want to find out who brought Alvarez to SDA."
"I think given the facts we know now, I would have informed the governor," Platkin said. But he's still unsure if he would have fired Alvarez outright. "I still don’t know the answer to that legally."
RT @SusanKLivio: Murphy’s top lawyer reveals why he kept governor in the dark about ex-staffer accused of rape https://t.co/6lgiZXI5HZ
Platkin is asked why he didn't instruct the chief of staff to fire Alvarez. "It’s something I’ve thought about … at the time we felt the best course was asking him to leave," he said. Alvarez was asked twice to leave but didn't resign until contacted by a reporter months later.
Platkin's testimony he did not hire Alvarez joins that of the chief of staff, head of the transition and Alvarez's boss at the New Jersey Schools Development Authority.
"It doesn’t seem to me anyone knows who hired Mr. Alvarez," said legislative committee co-chairwoman Eliana Pintor-Marin.
Platkin testified he did not hire Alvarez and does not know who did. "I can’t speak for everyone in the administration, but I was not involved in the process for hiring Mr. Alvarez," he said.
"So the requirements of the EEO process were relatively fresh in my mind," he said. "You are required to maintain confidentiality to the fullest extent possible and not share the allegation any wider than permitted by the EEO policy." Platkin said he did not tell the governor.
Matt Platkin, chief counsel, is testifying now about role in administration's response to Katie Brennan's rape allegation against a top staffer. He said he received training on the N.J.'s equal employment opportunity rules just weeks before Brennan told him she was raped.

Braz testified he believed Brennan's allegations against Al Alvarez. "I was shocked and horrified and felt devastated for my friend," he said. "I feel deeply sorry for what my friend has gone through and continues to go through. I admire her for her courage in speaking out.
Braz testified he didn't discuss Brennan's allegation again out of respect for her. "I didn't want to elevate anything without her permission," he said.
Braz has testified he told Raj Parikh, transition counsel, and incoming Chief of Staff Pete Cammarano, his direct supervisor. "They told me they were going to handle" it, he said.

"There are not enough taxes to raise or programs to cut to feed the insatiable beast of employee pensions and platinum-plus health benefits," he said.
Pension crisis can only be solved by making benefits more realistic, Christie said. Here's his plan: https://t.co/1eB1qhoLNL
"They not only didn't fix it," Christie said. "They made it worse each and every year. And then they deposited it in my lap in January 2010 and said it's your fault."
(Christie slashed the assumed rate of return from 7.65 percent to 7 percent in December. Read more here: https://t.co/VjHMX5B090)
Christie blamed former governors for the state's pension ills, scolding them for raising assumed rates of return to conceal the real debt, shorting/skipping contributions and granting benefits without paying for them.
"And together, finally and most importantly, we went from the most punitive death tax in America to no death tax at all," Christie said.
"Look at my Democratic friends. Together, we lowered the sales tax. Together, we exempted $100,000 in retirement income from state income tax for our seniors. Together, we honored our veterans by giving them a significant tax exemption," Christie said.
"Seven days, I’m just another property taxpayer. And as another property taxpayer, I am begging you. Stand up to these interests. Pass the arbitration cap like you’ve done twice before. And do not return the citizens of our state to 7% annual property tax increases." - Christie
Failure to renew the 2% interest arbitration cap on police and firefighter salaries, Christie says in final state of the state, is a "failure of leadership."

NJ is a high-cost place to live and retire, and it'll never be able to reduce taxes enough to compete with low-tax states, Rosen said.
"The fact that we agree doesn’t mean that we’re right," OLS Budget and Finance Officer David Rosen noted.
Sen. Paul Sarlo complimented OLS and treasury for similar revenue estimates: "It’s refreshing… that that’s off the table," he said.
Leg Budget &amp; Finance Officer David Rosen, who testified before the Assembly panel yesterday, is before the Senate Budget Committee this a.m.
If attacking admin on debt, "We really are scraping the bottom of the barrel to come up with something to beat you up about," O'Scanlon said
Assemblyman O'Scanlon criticized Assemblyman Schaer for his attacks on Christie's debt record. Christie has slowed the rate of debt accrual.
Pension fund fees are listed in the State Investment Council's annual report: http://t.co/E7g4pnOLzC
That new reporting should be recognized "as enhanced transparency and not an opportunity to distort facts," the treasurer said.
Treasurer says critics of fees are comparing apples, oranges. NJ reports incentives while many pension funds don't, he said.
The treasurer is defending fees paid last year for outside management of pension fund alternative investments, saying they're competitive.
"I don’t think the impact on the state budget has been anything more than negligible," Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said.
"We’ve done better than our ratings would suggest," the treasurer told the budget committee. "Low interest rates have been our friends."

The differences between estimates, Rosen said, are by "analytically trivial amounts."

OLS revenue estimates for next year's budget are $38.6 million higher than Christie's administration.

All contracts are subject to appropriations, state argues. Why should this one be any different?
Judge notes there are implications for employees who aren't part of the state pension system, whose employers have been making 100% payment.
Judge says state's argument makes it sound like 2011 law was "a hollow commitment."
The state creates a debt whenever future legislatures are required to pay, violating law requiring voters to approve debt, the state argues.
State argues that anything binding future legislatures to make an appropriation runs afoul of debt limitation and appropriations clauses.

Why did Northampton County Council kill Executive John Brown's budget? http://t.co/0p4RxqC8RB
Only Council President Peg Ferraro votes for the budget, which still includes the $20.1 m line of credit the solicitor opined was illegal.
Council opted to kill Brown's budget, which forces him to introduce a revised budget.
Councilman Lamont McClure arguing Brown doesn't have the authority to amend the budget. But council can only amend spending, not revenue.
Council's solicitor released an opinion yesterday that borrowing to finance operations is barred under the charter.
A layperson's reading of the Home Rule Charter suggests deficit financing, like the $20.1 bank line of credit, is prohibited.
Brown defended the line of credit, saying there's precedent, but that he's "not interested in actually debating the legality of it."
He'll offer an amendment to pull $20.1m from the general fund balance in its place, Brown told council.
In response to a legal opinion ruling his budget balancing maneuver illegal, Norco Exec John Brown will remove the $20.1m line of credit.

Commissioner Schware, who championed the cut amounting to $8 for the ave household, has taken offense to those likening it to a happy meal.
Muller could veto part or all of the budget, which includes a $1.25 million tax cut that opponents argue will worsen the structural deficit.

“And now for the rest of the meeting," Dougherty says.
Brace and Mazziotti disagree over whether a budget with a $3 million deficit is effectively a balanced budget.
Opponents say it is foolish to pass a tax increase while there's still a structural deficit (commissioners cut $3.8 of $5.5 million deficit)
6-3 vote in favor of the tax cut. Democrats David Jones and Geoff Brace and Republican Percy Dougherty in the minority.
Commissioners are debating the final amendment, a $1.25 million tax cut, or about $8 per household.
To clarify, that's not a year-over-year cut. It eliminates the increase Executive Tom Muller proposed in his budget.
A couple farmers had to leave before the board took up the cuts. Their day starts in just a few hours.
Several supporters of Penn State Extension, which could lose money, stuck around to defend the programs.
They're just taking up $280,755 in cuts to non-personnel line items.
So far the board has only rejected one amendment. All were introduced by Republicans, who have a supermajority on the 9-member board.
The cut affects only non-union employees, as do three other measures addressing employee compensation.
Commissioners vote 6-3 to cut a bonus that rewards longtme workers, which amounts to a pay cut for those employees.
The Lehigh County Board of Commissioners will take up 23 amendments tonight; all introduced by Republican members.

Lehigh County board revokes Allentown affordable housing grant http://t.co/wYnIqktxPh
The county also pays the zoo $92,500 to care for county-owned animals.
The subsidy peaked at  $595,000 in 2009. The past four years the county has paid $245,000.
Each of those amounts can be reduced further by $35,000 if the zoo's financial picture improves.
The latest Lehigh County Zoo funding proposal calls for a $185,000 subsidy in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and $150,000 for 2017 through 2019.
Commissioner Mike Schware said he wants to see the zoo's 2013 audited financial statements before the county commits to a long-term subsidy.
The five commissioners who voted to postpone inking a six-year deal suggested they will fully fund the zoo's 2014 funding request.
Lehigh County Board votes 5-4 to postpone the vote on a six-year agreement to subsidize the Lehigh County Zoo.
“I would say bring that lawsuit on," Commissioner Vic Mazziotti said.
The Allentown Housing Authority, the recipient of the grant, said it will look into pursuing a fair housing action against the county.
The county board has revoked its $750,000 grant toward the rehabilitation of 70 affordable housing units at Cumberland Gardens in Allentown.

The TIF has been defeated 6-3. Only Creighton, Dougherty and Jones vote in favor. Most were surprised to hear McCarthy vote no.
Commissioner Jones said he will support the TIF because "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
Creighton said he's convinced the development will not happen if the TIF is not approved.
Commissioner Tom Creighton, the board's swing vote, has said he will vote for the Hamilton Crossings/Costco TIF.

"That’s why the sale of this building, that’s why the new building is important," Stoffa says regarding the pending sale of Gov. Wolf.
Norco Exec John Stoffa reports that 18,739  people were served by the various arms of human services in the 2011-12 fiscal year.
Marcus says Premier is best known for reining in costs at Gracedale, but it has done so without sacrificing care or the Medicaid population.
"We’re far from the point where we could bring it back in house," Marcus said of Gracedale nursing home management.
Norco Human Services Director Ross Marcus is recommending the county renew its contract for nursing home management with Premier Healthcare.

County Solicitor made the point that McClure's proposal doesn't fix the problem, which is that the exec and council don't agree on provider.
The legislation addresses the current impasse over a contract for non-emergency ambulance service at Gracedale nursing home.
Lamont McClure, who is absent, has introduced a change to the administrative code barring admin from switching procurement methods midstream
"We’ve already sold part of this property once, I don’t want to wind up with it back again, Cusick said.
