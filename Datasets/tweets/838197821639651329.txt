Guideline delivery system.
4. We the People of the United States of America come now to the US Congress and Demand the creation of a category within the TV Parental Guidelines system identifying news programming compliant with these demands and notifications to viewers be dispersed under the TV Parental
3. We the People of the United States of America come now to the US Congress and Demand the addition of a Truth In Media Clause to Communications act of 1934 that requires all broadcast licensees to present only fact-checked information.
2. We the People of the United States Of America come now to the US Congress and Demand that the legalization of domestic propaganda be reversed in its entirety.
Be it resolved that:		1.We the People of the United States Of America come now to the US Congress and DEMAND that the Fairness Doctrine be reinstated in its entirety.
SCOTUS upheld the constitutionality in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC foreshadowing a decade in which the FCC would view the Fairness Doctrine as a guiding principle calling it ‚Äúthe single most important requirement of operation in the public interest‚Äù (FCC Fairness Report, 74)
Whereas, the Fairness Doctrine was upheld in the highest court of our Law yet partially repealed in 1987 under Regan and fully under Clinton,
[Communications Act of 1934- edited Chapter 315(a) to read: ‚ÄúA broadcast licensee shall afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of conflicting views on matters of public importance.‚Äù https://t.co/Fi7z1XVF5h  ]
Whereas, the Fairness Doctrine was put in place in 1959 to ensure all sides of all issues were covered by all frequency broadcasting companies,
Whereas, the people of the United States have been educated on the definition, use, and danger of large-scale propaganda through the experience of 6 million mostly Jewish people during the Second World War,
Whereas, the people of the United States have been made aware of National Broadcasting company Sinclair News Group forced scripted information to be televised in the form of propaganda, which was legalized for domestic use in the 2012 NDAA,
Whereas, the People of the United States misunderstood that large-scale  news programming-delivered information was being presented as complete and true fact,
