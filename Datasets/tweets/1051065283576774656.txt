There are no constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect.
Excellence, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a mean, relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of practical wisdom would determine it.

A word of encouragement from a teacher to a child can change a life. A word of encouragement from a spouse can save a marriage. A word of encouragement from a leader can inspire a person to reach her potential.
Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.
Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.

In times of great stress or adversity, it's always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
To u wives who are constantly complaining and see only the dark side of life, and feel that u are unloved and unwanted, look into ur own hearts and minds. If there is something wrong, turn about. Put a smile on ur faces. Make urselves more attractive. Brighten ur outlook.
