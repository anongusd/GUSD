These are my #SaturdayThoughts
It is honestly sad to think that there US politicians who are actively seeking to undermine the Constitution because they think it is "unpopular" or "not useful". I encourage everyone to read the Constitution and the Federalist Papers to understand why our government is unique.
@AOC In Federalist Paper 68, Hamilton makes the case for the importance of why the Electoral College is necessary. Instead of making jokes on Twitter, I would invite you to actually read what the Founding Fathers thought about the institution: https://t.co/nqRRumaZFq
@AOC The Electoral College was founded to allow a republic form of government to exist. The Founding Fathers were intent on protecting the rights of each state and individual. The Electoral College helps give each state a voice in electing the President of the United States.
The EU is not a good example of how socialism could work.	1. Most of it's country's have mixed economies, not command.	2. They don't have to worry about military spending because of the US presents in Europe.		Every single command economy is history has failed https://t.co/hSI73psty9
@Braxtonlit @AOC Amazing, I was just curious if you were able to justify killing babies and still claim moral superiority, you can't because you know you are not moral. Its sad that narcissism is so infested on the left. truly a sad day, glad I left that party.
@Braxtonlit @AOC How do I sound mad?
@brianbeutler So Basically you are saying, why aren't you on my side of every argument, you bad awful people? And you wonder why they don't support you?
@Braxtonlit @AOC Personally, well yes I eat only game meat that I hunt myself, so I do not need to support the meat industry. And I guess a MORAL reason would be to push-out a corrupt government forcing immoral ideas on its citizens. Like those immoral red coats.
@DianaKraft7 @NancyDillonNYDN @DLoesch @jschladey No I mean her definition of it not the real one.
@NancyDillonNYDN @DLoesch @jschladey I am curious to what being embedded means?
@Braxtonlit @AOC I am confused, what about guns, are you saying without them their would be no murders and violence? If so I reject your question. I own guns and I haven't shot a person? And I already answered capitol punishment. I am however still waiting on your answer.
@Braxtonlit @AOC How so? I answered your babbling, I do not think we should kill any innocent people. But you still failed to answer why its OK to kill a baby due to convenience, And how that's a moral stance? If you want to deflect to protect your ego that's on you.
@AOC @jacobinmag So Every other report is incorrect, because you found this report online? That isn't really how logic works.
@Braxtonlit @AOC I do standby my pro-life stance, I never said I believe in killing prisoners, you assumed it, so you can deflect and hide from the hypocritical hole you dug yourself into. I gave you the rope, you can either use it to climb out or continue to dig.
@Braxtonlit @AOC So you are trying to paint a moral picture that killing a baby is justified because it commuted a crime being created in the wrong womb. The Baby murdered someone? If so couldn't you take the same stance as criminals and let them do their time? say 9 months?
@bradyjonestweet @JacobAWohl https://t.co/8BNb4T7IN3		Here is what I looked up while you were yelling....
@Braxtonlit @AOC Yes, fighting to not kill children in the womb, due to the inconvenience of making bad choices, seems moral to me.

@nowthisnews @AOC I thought that the government was supposed to prevent poverty from happening, according to socialist ideology, or is that a myth too?
@CNNSitRoom @jamiegangel @SpeakerPelosi "...and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient;" (Article 2, Section 3). In fact, it was Woodrow Wilson back in 1913, who first started the practice of addressing Congress in a joint session.
@CNNSitRoom @jamiegangel Fun fact for @SpeakerPelosi: Trump doesn't need your permission to give a State of the Union. The Constitution states that the president "shall from time to time give to the Congress Information on the State of the Union..."
@CNN Well done Governor for protecting the sanctity of unborn life in Ohio. I only wish the people of New York could say the same.
@AOC Also, the verse in Leviticus is in reference to God's covenant land to the Israelites to preserve a righteous generation to Him. Before you misuse the Holy Bible, I would invite you to read it first.
During the Eisenhower era, the tax rate was 90% but because there was so many write-offs, or what you call "loopholes", that the tax rate was more like 30% https://t.co/Mjrh8WrCsM
The first two verses you listed are before the fall of man. If you are familiar with the Bible, you would understand that the rules changed after that, such as the introduction of death. https://t.co/3hLhkh2NPs

@ILoveAn01304078 @ZeusMGA @realDonaldTrump Yes its part of border security, whats the issue?
@ILoveAn01304078 @ZeusMGA @realDonaldTrump Its also worth pointing out, the Democrats just voted to give Mexico and central America over 10 Billion to help with the border issue? Why is 6 billion for a wall a waste?

@chroniclaziness @steveo6924 @BuzzFeed No I am saying the military shouldn't be on the hook for the cost of them transitioning, making special changing rooms, added cost, that's even more wasted money on a bloated defense budget.
@chroniclaziness @steveo6924 @BuzzFeed How does that even make sense? If the women pass all physical and mental hurdles they can go battle with the men. Its also like not every woman wants to do that.
@chroniclaziness @steveo6924 @BuzzFeed That help run the war machine.
@chroniclaziness @steveo6924 @BuzzFeed what else should it do?
@steveo6924 @chroniclaziness @BuzzFeed Not everyone can serve in the Military, its not there for anything but to serve the US in War, the military shouldn't be paying for transition surgery, Viagra, or CO-ED shower sex-parties. Its to teach you how to serve war and combat.
@steveo6924 @chroniclaziness @BuzzFeed now your shifting the argument, the school is already offered as a way to entice kids into joining. You only say its not an idea because its easier to virtue signal, than to look and break down a cost analysis, and weigh all options.
@steveo6924 @chroniclaziness @BuzzFeed Yes there is NO SEX in the military, and clearly this will help with the rape culture in the military and screw what all those women think, maybe they don't want a man watching them shower, call me old-fashioned. and accommodations, you mean SPEND MORE.
@steveo6924 @chroniclaziness @BuzzFeed 20,000 times 10,000 = 200,000,000. Thats the increase, and that also means anyone looking to transition can just join the military and have us tax payers pay for it, because why not.
@steveo6924 @chroniclaziness @BuzzFeed Don't let your emotion drown out your logic.
@steveo6924 @chroniclaziness @BuzzFeed Hey I served as well that doesn't give you the moral high-ground, and so your saying a non-transistioned transgender woman, can go to Basic and shower with Women if he says he's a woman? That seems logical to you?
@chroniclaziness @steveo6924 @BuzzFeed No women feminists have been fighting for equality, so they have to serve 50/50. For equality.
@chroniclaziness @steveo6924 @BuzzFeed Ok good, so Ban transgenders,  then he military shrinks by about 10k people, and save 20k per person, glad you agree.
@chroniclaziness @steveo6924 @BuzzFeed Pfizer says the current wholesale cost for a 50 milligram or 100 milligram Viagra is $61.54 a pill. 		if we assume that a typical transition might involve bottom surgery and top surgery, you might end up with a cost of approximately $20,000 - $30,000.
