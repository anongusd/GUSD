Thank you, Congress, for passing the #2018FarmBill! We’re eager now for the President to sign this bill so that farm and ranch families have the tools they need to weather the economic storm hitting farm country.
A long-waited-for day as @EPA announced its new Clean Water Rule! We believe this new rule is rooted in common-sense, will protect our nation’s water and allow farmers to farm. Thank you @realDonaldTrump and @EPAAWheeler for giving farmers #CleanWaterClearRules this Christmas!
The Farm Bureau family joins in mourning the passing of a true American hero. President George H.W. Bush modeled the best of American values and patriotism through his life of service and sacrifice. May we all honor his legacy by serving and protecting the great country he loved. https://t.co/AK3MDBLvsj

Thanks to our state Farm Bureaus and #ag supporters for participating in #DitchTheRuleChat. Comment now at https://t.co/NzgwdT9LEn. https://t.co/eeXGswI26I
Farmers &amp; ranchers: It’s critical to share your stories with @EPA ASAP. Comment period ends 9/27 https://t.co/NzgwdT9LEn #DitchTheRuleChat https://t.co/RrUP6bSkVK
A8. For more information about #WOTUS and next steps, please visit https://t.co/Tb59ZnG8oF #DitchTheRuleChat #FBAdvocacy
A7.2. Farmers and ranchers need to submit their comments to the EPA by September 27: https://t.co/NzgwdT9LEn #DitchTheRuleChat #FBAdvocacy
A7. Now, we need farmers &amp; ranchers to submit comments to the @EPA in support of repealing #WOTUS. https://t.co/NzgwdT9LEn #DitchTheRuleChat
A6.4. We need a new rule that provides a clear &amp; reasonable definition of “navigable” within the limits set by Congress. #DitchTheRuleChat
A6.3. We support @EPA &amp; @USACEHQ’s proposal to rescind the rule. #DitchTheRuleChat
A6.2. We’ve been running our #DitchTheRule campaign for 3+ years. The rule is a severe overreach that would cripple #ag. #DitchTheRuleChat
A6.1. Farm Bureau has opposed #WOTUS since it was proposed for public comment in April 2014. #DitchTheRuleChat
A5.4. Farmers &amp; ranchers want to maintain water quality w/o giving the federal gov't regulatory power over farmlands. #DitchTheRuleChat
A5.3. We want clean water for our families &amp; communities too. But #WOTUS created confusion &amp; gave agencies too much power. #DitchRuleTheRule
A5.2 Another misconception is that #ag doesn’t care about clean water &amp; protecting natural resources. We DO care. #DitchTheRuleChat
A5.1 The biggest misconception is that #WOTUS regulates “waters.” @EPA said it wouldn’t cover farmlands. But the rule did. #DitchTheRuleChat
A4.5. It’s important that farmers and ranchers submit comments to support the repeal. https://t.co/NzgwdT9LEn #DitchTheRuleChat
A4.4. @EPA is seeking comments from the public on whether to rescind #WOTUS now through 9/27. https://t.co/NzgwdT9LEn #DitchTheRuleChat
A4.3. The agencies proposed to rescind #WOTUS in June bc it didn't fully consider the role of states in protecting waters. #DitchTheRuleChat
A4.2 In February, President Trump signed an executive order telling @EPA &amp; @USACEHQ to reconsider the flawed #WOTUS rule. #DitchTheRuleChat
A4.1 The #WOTUS rule was blocked by a federal court in 2015. It is not in effect—but that court order is only temporary. #DitchTheRuleChat
@wagfarms Farmers and their conservation practices protect the environment, not overregulation. #DitchTheRuleChat
A3.2. The Sixth Circuit Court quickly blocked #WOTUS nationwide because the court found it was probably illegal. #DitchTheRuleChat
A3.1. No. The flawed 2015 #WOTUS rule was never implemented nationwide. It only briefly went into effect in some states. #DitchTheRuleChat
A2.4. #WOTUS’ vagueness made farmlands regulatory minefields. Harmless, accidental violations could trigger huge fines. #DitchTheRuleChat
@wagfarms Less farming, less food, higher prices. #DitchTheRuleChat
A2.3. #WOTUS’ overreaching &amp; vague terms = Impossible for farmers to know what parts of their land would be regulated. #DitchTheRuleChat
A2.2. Lands regulated by #WOTUS generally cannot be used by farmers, ranchers or others without a federal permit. #DitchTheRuleChat
A2.1. #WOTUS was never about water. It was a federal land grab that infringed on the property rights of farmers. #DitchTheRuleChat
A1.3. It granted @EPA reg. control over lands that only temporarily hold water (ditches, temporary ponds &amp; lowlands). #DitchTheRuleChat
A1.2. #WOTUS expanded the @EPA and @USACEHQ regulatory authority beyond what Congress approved. #DitchTheRuleChat
A1.The 2015 rule significantly expanded the definition of “navigable waters.” #DitchTheRuleChat
Hello, Twitter community. I’m looking forward to today’s discussion. It’s important #ag makes its voice heard on #WOTUS. #DitchTheRuleChat
