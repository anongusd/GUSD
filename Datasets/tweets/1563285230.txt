We are glad to see the #UK join the United States in identifying #Hezbollah for what it really is, and we hope that other European Union countries will follow London‚Äôs example.
Until now, the British government only outlawed Hezbollah‚Äôs external security unit and its military wing. As recently as June 2018, Hezbollah flags were carried in the streets of #London with impunity in the anti-Israel Quds Day rally, with protestors chanting ‚ÄúDeath to #Israel.‚Äù
Hezbollah has also become a key military actor in the violence in #Syria, and plays an integral role in projecting Iranian influence and interests across the Middle East.
This year, the @IDF located and destroyed a new series of terror tunnels constructed by #Hezbollah that extend into Israeli territory ‚Äì an affront to Israeli sovereignty.
The #Iran-backed Shi‚Äôite militant group has a strong and growing presence in #Lebanon‚Äôs government, while also maintaining military control in the Lebanese south.
Today, the United Kingdom finally made the critical decision to recognize #Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization, and to ban all its branches.

By calling (202) 225-4755, we can encourage Rep. Omar to reflect on her problematic stances and hopefully become a better representative for the American people.
The @AJCongress is calling upon Americans, and especially those in Rep. @Ilhan Omar‚Äôs constituency, to contact Rep. Omar‚Äôs office and let her know that statements such as these do not belong in Congress.
.@JackRosenNYC (continued): "Such ignorance on our foreign policy would be troubling for any Member of Congress, let alone one who sits on the @HouseForeign Committee.‚Äù
.@JackRosenNYC (continued): "Not only is this deeply offensive, but it also shows that a U.S. Congresswoman fails to understand the American values, security interests, and many other factors that make the U.S.-Israel relationship so important."
AJCongress President @JackRosenNYC said: ‚ÄúThis latest comment from Congresswoman Omar should disturb us all."
But when she uses these sorts of tropes consistently, it becomes progressively harder to give her the benefit of the doubt. In light of this, we urge her fellow Congressmen and women to reconsider her position on the @HouseForeign Committee.
This is not the first time Omar has employed such a trope; in the past, she tweeted that ‚ÄúIsrael has hypnotized the world,‚Äù for which she recently apologized and claimed she did not understand its implication.
Suggesting that Jews manipulate our government, through monetary means or otherwise, is a classic anti-Semitic trope that has been used to harm Jews for hundreds of years.
As a response to @GOPLeader‚Äôs statement that he will act against her and @RepRashida for their anti-Israel vitriol, Omar suggested that Congressional support for #Israel is ‚Äúall about the Benjamins,‚Äù then clarified that she believes @AIPAC is buying Congress' support for Israel.
This Sunday, she reignited our concerns when she suggested on Twitter that the United States‚Äô support for #Israel is all about Jewish money.
Rep. Omar is often highlighted as one of the first #Muslim women elected into #Congress, which is worthy of celebration. Her history of anti-Semitic rhetoric and anti-Israel political stances, however, should concern the Jewish American community and indeed all Americans.
The American Jewish Congress condemns recently-elected Congresswoman @Ilhan Omar for her anti-Semitic comments.

.@RashidaTlaib and others can pretend that they do not understand the meaning of these words. But whether he fully understood the gravity of his words or not, @marclamonthill's comment was dangerous, and we firmly support @CNN in its decision.
It is also the language used by the terrorist organization #Hamas, which advocates for the violent destruction of #Israel and the genocide of the Jewish people.
So when someone supports a "free Palestine from the river to the sea," it is not an endorsement of a two-state solution or peace deal; it is an explicit call for the destruction or removal of the State of Israel and an implicit call for violence.
"From the river to the sea" refers to the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. That means the entirety of what is now #Israel, the #WestBank, and #Gaza. In other words, it describes a Palestinian state replacing, not coexisting with, Israel.

Our statement on @POTUS Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions on #Iran: https://t.co/gah2WOrjLX
We call upon the international community to join the United States in sanctioning the volatile rogue state of #Iran.
Additionally, the documents uncovered last spring by Israel's #Mossad prove that Iran did pursue an extensive #nuclear program in the past and lied about it repeatedly when negotiating the Deal. The mullahs cannot be trusted.
With #sanctions lifted, Iran continued its hateful rhetoric, established advanced weapons factories for #Hezbollah in Lebanon, and flagrantly violated the restrictions placed upon it for missile testing.
The Nuclear Deal was based on the premise that #Iran would behave better when given concessions; that premise is demonstrably wrong.
Iran's leaders are extreme, aggressive, and bent on regional hegemony. Time and time again, they have antagonized the #USA, threatened #Israel with annihilation, and sponsored #terrorism and violence throughout the Middle East.
The American Jewish Congress supports @POTUS Trump's decision to re-impose sanctions on #Iran. This is a strong next step toward resetting our Iran policy and holding Iran's regime accountable for its actions.

It is clear to us that the true enemy of the Iranian people is their government; what the mullahs fear most is their people seeing the truth.
And when civilians are slaughtered, instead of working to find the perpetrators and prevent future bloodshed, the regime points fingers at Israel and the US, like it does time and time again, so it won't have to take responsibility for itself.
The authoritarian Iranian regime routinely oppresses and silences its people. Instead of providing for its citizens and investing in its economy, #Iran pours its resources into campaigns of terror and aggression throughout the Middle East.
Shamefully, instead of facing the tragedy directly, #Iran's leaders quickly put the blame on the #US and #Israel, without evidence of justification. For the mullahs to turn a tragic loss of life into yet another piece of baseless propaganda is deceitful and sad.

If Mr Abbas values promoting coexistence and mutual understanding, he would be wise to apologize for yet again causing offence and to recommit himself to rejecting isolationism, intolerance and destructiveness that risk torpedoing prospects for peace. #Israel #Holocaust
We call on the international community to condemn his unjustifiable comments. #Israel #Holocaust
Mr Abbas has been sorely misinformed in his inaccurate approximation of history ‚Äì it is his comments and not Israel‚Äôs claims to self-determination that are ‚Äúcompletely unacceptable‚Äù. #Israel #Holocaust
By continuing to incite violence and Holocaust denial and support terrorism and spew anti-Semitism, the Palestinian leadership consistently has shown it is not interested in positioning itself as a legitimate partner for peace or in achieving lasting regional stability. #Israel
With these comments, Mr Abbas has shown his truly colors and, in doing so, can no longer claim to be a true advocate for peace. #Israel #Holocaust
His position that the Holocaust was not motivated by anti-Semitism and that there is no Jewish claim to the State of Israel is historically inaccurate and morally reprehensible. #Israel #Holocaust
Mr. Abbas‚Äôs latest outrageous comments can only be described as out and out anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial, consolidating his long and well-documented history of Holocaust denial. #Israel #Holocaust

The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement is an anti-Israel and anti-Zionist agenda rooted in anti-semitism. For years the BDS movement has targeted Israeli and Jewish students across universities campuses.
Yesterday, Jewish students across the nation have joined together to say they are UNITED against the new form of Anti-Semitism - BDS.
Support our students! 85 years ago, on April 25, 1933, the German government issued a law to dramatically limit the number of Jewish students attending public schools. https://t.co/47aMHTkdjr
We applaud this demonstration and call on the German government to take serious action on this incident.
Today, thousands of Germans of all faiths have donned Jewish kippah caps in nationwide rallies to show solidarity in support of the country's Jewish community amid concerns about growing anti-Semitism.
Last week, an Israeli Arab wore the Jewish cap, or kippah, in Berlin as an experiment. The young man was subjected to verbal abuse by three people and was lashed with a belt by a Syrian Palestinian.

Attacks such as these have become far too frequent in the US and worldwide. 	As a society, we need to fight the hate that breeds such intolerable and indiscriminate violence and ensure that our values of freedom and tolerance prevail.
This was the latest in a series of cowardly acts against innocent students, the deadliest school shooting since 26 people were killed at Connecticut school Sandy Hook in 2012.

In taking a leading role in this process, #America now has the opportunity to unite the international community in building a lasting legacy of stability in the Middle East. Having said that, Iran has already shown itself to be a bad actor in the process. #Iran
In taking a nuanced approach to the Iran issue, @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump has demonstrated a long-term commitment to containing the regime‚Äôs nuclear ambitions, while supporting the Iranian reformists who seek a progressive future for Iran. #Iran
This plan has clearly and demonstrably failed, and the Iranian people have once again taken to the streets in wide scale protest against their authoritarian rulers.  #Iran
The previous administration hoped that by signing a deeply flawed agreement and waiving crippling economic sanctions, it could bring Iran in from the cold and bring stability to the wider region.  #Iran
We welcome the announcement @POTUS will waive sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran in favour of targeted measures which will hold the regime to account over its ballistic missile testing, support for international terrorism and human rights violations.  #Iran

No longer should US tax dollars be used to reward Palestinian terrorists and their families. #PassTFA https://t.co/OyCEiiZlfW
We are glad the bill passed with bi-partisan support; when it comes to rejecting terror &amp; supporting Israel the US transcends party politics
No longer should US tax dollars be used to reward Palestinian terrorists and their families.
We welcome the passing of the Taylor Force Act (S.1697), following a vote by The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today.
We wish Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) every success in securing its passing.due to go up in front of The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today.
We hope the Members do justice, and pass this landmark legislation. We congratulate SC Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) for introducing the motion
We hope the Members do justice to the memory of Taylor Force, the brave USA soldier who was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist in Tel Aviv
No longer should US tax dollars be used to reward Palestinian terrorists and their families.

The American Jewish Congress strongly urges members of Congress to vote in favour of the Taylor Force Act (S.1697),
