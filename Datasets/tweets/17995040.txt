I've said for two years that Trump's sycophancy-for-denuclearization strategy was high-risk, high-reward -- and that if it failed, it was utter foolishness. Supporters of the strategy assured Americans that this was all part of the plan. Obviously, it wasn't.
You don't get points for "effort" when the "effort" involves pretending Otto Warmbier wasn't murdered, and that the US has a "special relationship" with the worst dictator on the planet -- and when that "effort" results in less than nothing.
And don't give me "the alternative was nuclear war"! No, it absolutely was and is not. Face-to-face meetings with gulag-masters without any pre-negotiation are amateur hour. Flattering a man who murders American citizens and his own relatives impunity is unconscionable.
If there had been ANY serious pre-negotiations, none of this happens. And it is absolutely unconscionable for Trump to treat Kim with the kind of warmth he has for the last two years.
Trump should be grateful for Cohen distracting everyone from the massive moral and diplomatic debacle that just unfolded in Vietnam.

So is Cohen's testimony damaging to Trump? In terms of public relations, sure. In terms of impeachment, meh. In terms of legal liability, not really.
On Trump/Russia, testimony mostly falls into "embarrassing" rather than "illegal" bucket. Cohen admits he has no proof of collusion. It's not illegal for Trump to celebrate Wikileaks acting on its own to damage Hillary, nor is it illegal for Trump to pursue Moscow business.
When it comes to bucket (1), there are two topics: Trump and Stormy, and Trump/Russia. On Trump and Stormy, the debate is whether hush money payoffs with no intention to win an election constitute a violation of campaign finance law. That's a somewhat weak case.
Cohen's testimony falls into three buckets for Trump: (1) illegality; (2) embarrassing for Trump; (3) stupid hilarity. There's not much in bucket (1), there's a lot in bucket (2), and there's a fair amount in bucket (3).

@EricRWeinstein I would never equate AIPAC with J Street. AIPAC has routinely shied away from militance (see their non-stance on the Iran deal in terms of forcing a vote), while J Street never misses an opportunity to undercut the survival of Israel.
@EricRWeinstein I know. I was ignoring it because people who generally want to start trouble aren't generally interested in answers. I actually don't think the tweet was supremely vague or non-understandable.
@EricRWeinstein Yup. And boy am I tired of tweet archaeology. It's hard enough to remember what I was writing a month ago in a column let alone nearly a decade ago in a tweet.
@EricRWeinstein 4. J Street would be first on my list here.

@thehowie @allahpundit The truth is that a welfare state stacked atop a free market economy is the Nordic model -- and to a large extent, the post-FDR American model, too. I think there's a strong case to be made against a lot of those welfare programs.
@thehowie @allahpundit Exactly. I think both sides seem to think that a "socialist economy" means a welfare state. That's solid marketing by socialists, since socialism generally calls for abolition of the profit motive and nationalization of industry, which would be wildly unpopular.

So sure, let's retrofit every building in the United States, kill all the farting cows, stop air travel, crush all cars, and shut down all our power plants. But just know that until we get serious about bombing the coal factories in China and India, you're climate deniers.
How much global warming would be averted if the United States cut its emissions to net zero and the sensitivity of the climate is 4.5? 0.062¬∞C by 2050 and 0.173¬∞C by 2100. That's not going to cut it, guys. https://t.co/Qm5Dn2qUi9

Obviously, it's in my political interest to call for all three Democrats to step down. But I think it's rather important to set some realistic and reasonable standards now.
Northam deserves to go not because of the picture alone, which is egregious and racist, but because of his botched response. Herring should not go because a racially insensitive mistake made out of stupidity or ignorance at age 19 should not end a career.
Lt. Gov. Fairfax should become governor of Virginia. Uncorroborated allegations alone should not be enough to destroy a man's career and life. I have the same standards for Fairfax I had for Kavanaugh. Democrats cannot say the same.

@cjane87 Again, this is the exact question -- WHEN HAVE THEY REPENTED? In other words, is public confession a necessary element of repentance (particularly in the decades where a person isn't a public figure), or can repentance be evidenced by action?

@cjane87 Jane, you keep avoiding my broader question (when can we assume someone has repented) in favor of a different question (how bad are the KKK and blackface) -- a question upon which I agree with you!
RT @ABC7Annalysa: A spokesperson for @GovernorVA's office says they do not have a statement at this time.
@cjane87 I'm not saying we should move backward on the opprobrium at all, as you know! I'm overjoyed we are anti-blackface and anti-KKK hoods! That isn't the question.
@cjane87 So your assumption is that if nobody asks you about something nasty or embarrassing you did thirty years ago, and you don't volunteer to the general public that you did it, you agree with the action? That seems like a stretch, and a pretty radical standard.
@cjane87 But is he a removable racist for being ashamed of it and not talking about it, per se, assuming he was ashamed of it?
@cjane87 Agree, of course! So my question remains: what would have sufficed? When would have have brought it forward and apologized? Or would reaction have been enough? What you seem to be implying is no repentance is possible.
@cjane87 That's a vague answer. What would have sufficed here?
@cjane87 Was he ever asked about this? Or was it his duty to unburden himself of a 34-year-old yearbook page publicly so as to satisfy this requirement? Serious question if we're to establish a standard of repentance.

If you or any group of individuals believe that you have the capacity to set a "true" price and seek to impose that "true" price on others, without reference to the free consumption and labor choices of individuals, you are an economic tyrant.
Quick, tell me what an object is worth, without any information on what people are willing to pay for it. Price is, in a nutshell, an aggregation of information including how many such objects exist, what the objects are used for, what the inputs were, etc.
The notion that politicians have some special insight into what products and services are "worth" in a vacuum, absent markets, is utterly nuts.
