The Postscript: The system gave a lot of Calif Dems heartburn this week. But don’t bet on it getting unraveled. Voters in the state like it.
The Finale: Budget problems gone. Though open primary wasn’t really the savior. On political side: GOP losing more seats, and voters lowering the threshold of lawmaker votes needed to pass a budget cost Repubs their most potent tool: the power to torpedo state budgets.
The Collateral Damage: U.S. House and Senate races? They were kind of an afterthought. This was not so much about them. It was about getting Sacramento to function.
The Breaking Point: @Schwarzenegger's austerity, spending limit, antiunion, etc. ballot measures got crushed. He ultimately opted for political reform instead – aiming to bring folks into the legislature who would answer to voters in the middle, not on the extremes.
The Buildup: Year after year, the state blew budget deadline, driving the credit rating further down. When the borrowing binge ended, the cuts were brutal. There were periods when state workers went unpaid. Mass teacher pinkslips. Etc.
The Cast: And yet. Lawmakers were incapable of acting. Repubs who made deals faced certain primary death. They drove @Schwarzenegger more nuts than even big labor-controlled Dems.
The Plot: Calif was on brink of bankruptcy. Partisanship drove its credit into the toilet. “Ungovernable” was the buzzord. A state as broken as big Auto, that had even joined it in seeking a federal bailout. Humiliating moment.
California exhausted and baffled America this week with its open primary.(Branded “super dumb” by @neeratanden https://t.co/UNxurStVcI ).  More Calif being eccentric and contrarian for the sake of it? Nope.  But it is some @Schwarzenegger trying to blow stuff up and flex muscle.

@BermudaTuba @DanRiffle Fair point. Showing my age.

@DanRiffle As the article says, some people in DC who brazenly sell pot get arrested. Most don't. Other cities where recreational sales are banned do not have this kind of very open, very unsubtle activity. Hardly controversial to say. Several folks involved in the trade here say as much.

If @epa succeeds, vindication for @Schwarzenegger + @JerryBrownGov who not long ago were swimming way out in the deep end on energy.
Interesting: @epa invokes Clean Air Act to impose climate rule. The Act was passed in 1970, long before climate change was on the radar.
Rep. Henry Waxman (@WaxmanClimate) on Obama's @epa climate plan: "Industry always exaggerates the impact of clear air regulations."
.@SenatorBoxer on @epa climate plan: "Thank goodness the President refuses to be bullied."
.@EPA plan seems to borrow heavily from what policy-makers did in Calif, where the rules prompted utilities to divest big from fossils.
California is going to love this @EPA plan. West Virginia, not so much.
.@EPA: plan CREATES "climate and health benefits of $48 billion to $82 billion" for economy. .@USChamber: Plan will COST economy $50 bill.

First question at senate grid security hearing: @lisamurkowski asks what regulators are doing to stop leaks to the media.
Worth noting: FERC: did not make big security moves following Calif. attack. Was only after the media made it an issue a YEAR later.
.@FERC chair piles on the media. "Publication of such information about the grid undermines its security."
More @lisamurkowski re: leaked FERC security report. "This revelation with its national security implications I find extremely troubling."
.@lisamurkowski at grid security hearing says media spotlight "served to sensationalize the issue of physical grid security."
