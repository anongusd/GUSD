@VAVetBenefits @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @VAChair @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @forthepeople @JohnMorganESQ @WFLASteveA I had an VA MRI. Chronic White Matter Disease was identified.

@VAVetBenefits @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @VAChair @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @forthepeople @JohnMorganESQ @WFLASteveA VA said, yes, your IBS is now connected. BUTT COMBINED IBS w/ an over 25 year 30% GERD rating. Left rating at 30% after combining IBS ASS ADDITIONAL CONDITION? 2 conditions &amp; body areas. Come out opposite ends of body! How's this decision even logical or justified? #MoreBackedUp
@VAVetBenefits @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @VAChair @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @forthepeople @JohnMorganESQ @WFLASteveA Awaiting VA SOC HBP appeal hearing date. HBP is in well known med literature direct result of chronic, amplified pain. I've had this pain since 1991! VA just connected my artho/fibro as 1 rating but says the pain is btr?! NOT!! DROPPED ME TO 40% RATING FROM 60%. Huh?! HBP date??
@VAVetBenefits @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @VAChair @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @forthepeople @JohnMorganESQ @WFLASteveA I requested a VA Rx offset letter audit. Rx audit should be automatic upon rating decisions - not force vet request! My Rx balance is 0$. VA pharmacy just confirmed. VA business office NOW 30 days to review &amp; 6-8 weeks for decision?

@VAVetBenefits @DeptVetAffairs @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @realDonaldTrump @VAChair @WFLASteveA @JohnMorganESQ It takes years to navigate a veteran's case through the VA. Something so clear cut is so murky &amp; impossible. All on the veteran. To say the least, it is really disheartening. To top it all, I still have no war medals from the DoD or a corrected DD214! YES, THE STRUGGLE IS REAL!
@VAVetBenefits @DeptVetAffairs @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @realDonaldTrump @VAChair @WFLASteveA @JohnMorganESQ Here is another example of hurdles war vets go through w/ VA: Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans. It literally takes an act of Congress: https://t.co/J1hYluvgCV	Shamefully inappropriate &amp; disrespectful to those were in war on your's &amp; our country's behalf.
@VAVetBenefits @DeptVetAffairs @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @realDonaldTrump @VAChair @WFLASteveA @JohnMorganESQ Et al., this is the craziness not only I must deal w/ from the VA, but most veterans. VA reform is sorely needed so all veterans do not have years of this like I have &amp; so many do. You say veterans have great respect &amp; help returning from war? Nope. We struggle &amp; plead w/ VA.
@VAVetBenefits @DeptVetAffairs @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @realDonaldTrump @VAChair @WFLASteveA @JohnMorganESQ I was rated 30% for Leishmaniasis with GERD since 1991 at 30%. IBS was added to it and was left at 30%? Insane.
@VAVetBenefits To: @VAVetBenefits, @DeptVetAffairs Cc: @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @realDonaldTrump @VAChair @WFLASteveA @JohnMorganESQ 	See this chain regarding VA rating decision to leave me at 30% for GERD after adding IBS? The VA feedback is provided. Really? Its this hard??
@VAVetBenefits What were the reviewing doctor's comments to establish the rating criteria? 2 rating doctors reviewed: a VA comp &amp; a VA comp contracted. Both in just 30 minutes say my daily bouts with IBS &amp; GERD are not serious enough? I can assure you the toilet &amp; I are VERY CLOSE BUDS!
@VAVetBenefits Notice of Disagreements (NoDs) have been filed *w/ FDVA assistance*! Also see precedent by appeal in another veteran's case near exact to mine for IBS &amp; GERD combined: https://t.co/D68PXRH8hd.  I am out of work since 11/5/18, was out of work all of last January &amp; have filed SSDI.
Reaching out again. Any interest @ngklimas in my case? Left VM, email, tweeted &amp; called your office leaving message.
@VAVetBenefits @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @VAChair @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @forthepeople @JohnMorganESQ @WFLASteveA Also, 3 weeks ago, rating Notice of Disagreements (NoDs) filed. Still do not show in eBenefits in any fashion. A new Apnea filing longer than that ago does not show in eBenefits! What does it take!!

@VAVetBenefits @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @VAChair @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @forthepeople @JohnMorganESQ @WFLASteveA VA reply coninued, "For this reason Inflammatory arthritis dropped from 60% to 40% on 7/25/2018, the Leishmaniasis with Gerd was 100% from 10/01/1991 until 8/01/1992 when it became rated at 30% until 6/25/2018 and then combined with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome."
@VAVetBenefits @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @VAChair @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @forthepeople @JohnMorganESQ @WFLASteveA VA reply continued, "During the review for your rating decision, the contentions you are service connected for fluctuated due to the severity of the condition."
@VAVetBenefits @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @VAChair @SecWilkie @RepGusBilirakis @forthepeople @JohnMorganESQ @WFLASteveA VA reply to my inquiry: "Your inquiry has been reviewed. Per the Notification letter dated 12/19/2018, you are currently rated overall at 60%. This is due to the contention Leishmaniasis with GERD being combined with Irritable Bowel Syndrome effective 6/25/2018."
@realDonaldTrump, great idea for you. With all respect &amp; sincerity, offer congress &amp; senate to go without pay, same as you (although you donate it) during #GovernmentShutdown. Great political move. Helps families. Pivots legislative inaction into action during wall negotiations.

Waiting to receive the full detail of each dated, combined December 2018 #VA rating decision per my request of #VA. Also waiting for feedback from my opened case with the new #WhiteHouseVeteranHotline.
For 1/1/2019, VA compensated at the VA 40% compensation table married rate, yet, I am rated higher combined rating. I have had diagnoses in all 3 #VA #GulfWarIllness categories since 1991. I have no #VA debt needing paid. Totally confused. Please help @RepGusBilirakis.
I personally have many conditions in all 3 VA defined #GWI categories.
VA defines 3 categories of #GulfWarIllness (#GWI):	1. Undiagnosed illnesses;	2. Medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illnesses	3. Nine specific infectious diseases		VA avoids using term GWI as symptoms vary but is referred to as such by VA clinicians &amp; medical literature. https://t.co/CnBRWYcgOf
@RepGusBilirakis, thank you very much for your time to talk today &amp; better understand the #VA struggles so many #GulfwarVeterans &amp; I have experiecing #GulfWarIllness (#GWI). Issues with #VA service connections, ratings &amp; treatment options are daunting. Thanks for your service.
Received my #FLStateID today after going to @FLHSMV to surrender my #FLDriverLicense .  This is upon advisement of my private nuerologist due to #MildCognitiveImpairment,  #Dementia &amp; blank outs. I want to be responsible &amp; respect the safety of my family, others on the road &amp; me.
I called #VANational &amp; they could not explain the rating decision details. They referred my ask of decisions/combined rating calculations/dates to the regional office via case opened. They included my White House Veteran Hotline case number. I speak with @RepGusBilirakis tomorrow
Received my formal, final #VAratingdecision letter. I was rated 70% then 80% service connected retro from May 2015 until June 2018. In July 2018, I was dropped to 60%. No idea how I drop in service connection combined rating?
Everyone, there is a new White House #VeteransHotline open 24×365 -- yes, even on Christmas Day. I just spoke with them &amp; they assisted me. 		+1-855-948-2311		Thanks @realDonaldTrump for providing #veterans this avenue for #VA assistance.		Merry Christmas!
@Chintzo_o Likewise
Wishing You Happy Holidays https://t.co/2FbWFrsV5V
My 60% rating is now a finalized rating. I will have to file a #VAnoticeofdisagreement due to several errors. Many items in my claim were not service connected &amp; are secondary to primary conditions.  I am now seen by mental health due to depression &amp; PTSD positive screenings.
Still feel the same as above in this thread -- since 1991.

The #VA cannot explain how stress alone could wreak such havoc on #GulfWar #veteran health, or why #GWI #veterans are being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (#ALS) at twice the rate of other groups. War is changing. Soldiers are damaged by weapons other than bullets.
In 2003, EMBO reported nearly half #GWI symptoms treated are suspect linked to exposure to depleted uranium, pesticides, vaccines, particulates &amp; burning oil well gases, biological &amp; chemical weapons &amp; anti-nerve-gas drug pyridostigmine bromide (PB) - https://t.co/LTODzxKToZ

#organophosphates were used in soldier uniforms.
Health effects of #organophosphate poisoning are a result of excess acetylcholine (ACh) present at different nerves &amp; receptors because acetylcholinesterase is blocked. Accumulation of ACh @ motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression @ the neuromuscular junction. https://t.co/ENKEDaZD2z

#VA. #MayoClinic thinks trained #Nuerologists #diagnose #MCI #Dementia.  My private nuerologist spoke w/ wife &amp; I about Dx, seemed shocked we asked, "You mean dementia?" &amp; He said, "Uuuuuum yes?!"		See Diagnosing Alzheimer's: How Alzheimer's is diagnosed - https://t.co/uS6Sg8Ne8C
Spoke to #VASocialWorker.  Expressed my concerns. Explained I was switching to closer clinic for proximity &amp; care. I said my primary care doctor at Bay Pines tried to help. The social worker simply said w/ a smile, good luck in finding what you are looking for. #NothingLaughable
Also, they were unaware of the test the Private Nuerologist performed, Googled it in front of me &amp; said a Nuerologist should not make an #MCI #Dementia Dx - they should. Totally discounted Nuerologist medical opinion with hours of advanced machine testing.
Nonetheless, I told them how I was lost away from home last Friday for 15 minutes not knowing: where I was, how I got there, why I was there &amp; how I could get somewhere I recognized - until I called my wife &amp; she walked me through over the phone where I was, why &amp; how to return.
Conclusion: the VA NeuroPsych doctor said today they can't make a definitive conclusion re: my #MCI #Dementia. They don't have valid test data; I needed more test "oomph"?! YET will post their opinion in my #VA med recs. Said private Nueroligist tests too in-depth???

My hope is to inform everyone transparently my #experience to help all understand what #veterans &amp; their families deal with day-to-day after #war.  Not for sympathy or hand outs; rather #awareness, to help veterans gain #treatment &amp; earned #benefits while trying to cope.
All I used to do to help function &amp; use as tools daily for years no longer helps the same: reminders, writing things, detailed notes, pictures, canes, medications, aids, sleep, visual/audio triggers, triple checking, retracing steps; going room to room. #unworkable #IAmILL Sorry.
Work? I cannot any longer w/ terrible fatigue &amp; debilitating pain This means financial turmoil since NOT #ServiceConnected 100%. Couple stress, depression, physical imbalance, brain fog, cloudiness, dizziness &amp; cognitive impairment. Dementia. Reduced mobility to fully function?
@WFLASteveA, thank you so much for your call yesterday. I contacted you &amp; you returned the contact - all I can ask.👍Please share my story so other #GulfWar vets with #GulfWarIllness can be encouraged there are people who listen &amp; want to take helpful, positive steps to assist.

Anyone hearing my story says OMG. As the #GWI veteran dealing w/ all health issues, seeking help, getting treated/mal/mistreated, struggling to keep up, unfunctional, not service connected, trying to provide for family: it's dauntingly disheartening, stressful, sad &amp; exhausting.
I wrote President Trump to please help me &amp; other #GWI #veterans like me. I received a generic national security letter in return --  nothing to do w/ the #VA or my case.
Only until private doctor diagnoses &amp; their Nexus letters tying diagnoses to the #war has the VA listened re: #VAHealthCare &amp;  #VAServiceConnection.  The VA is still denying service connection for many of my diagnoses.  All symptoms are logged in my Army &amp; NIH records given VA!
Salt to the wound: I have written the @USArmy &amp; provided my war orders to receive my earned #GulfWar medals to no avail.  Only correspondence back: the #Army said I must produce evidence. I have provided war orders, pics, disease Dx &amp; diagnoses contracted in war zone/theater. https://t.co/rzelB4t9p2
I have terrible fatigue. I cannot sleep enough to help or do normal activity without feeling completely wiped out for days afterwards. I can only do a 1/3 of what I used to.  Since 1991, I have been fatigued daily. Debilitating best describes it.
All of my chronic symptoms have been since 1991 and only worsened over time to debilitating, 6-9pain level on meds, 10 level off meds, with severe imbalance, cloudiness, dizziness, cognitive impairment dementia and daily immobility and inability to fully function.
I am not 100% service connected. I was 100% in 1992 but then dropped to 0% by #VA. In fact, my claims are denied or in appeal since.  I am only awarded to 60% service connected as of 7/25/2018 after a 1/4 century.  60% rating still in deferred status &amp; unpaid today. No backpay!

@SecWilkie I was 🤬 told by a #VA 🤒 doctor, I survey moderate/severe #depression &amp; switched my medicine therafter. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) seems 🤔, especially w/ my 😴 study results &amp; all chronic ☠ #GWI, but VA 🧐 can't see tie to #CFS 😭 #Exhausting 🤯 ?! @FoxNews
This #SickGulfWarVet Gulf War Illness (#GWI) feed is now direct linked via https://t.co/uAzUNMCIfs for easier sharing word-of-mouth.
Since 2014, relevant publications by the National Academy of Science &amp; U.S. Department of Defense have used only the term Gulf War illness (GWI).
In a 2014 report contracted by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine recommended using the term Gulf War illness rather than chronic multisymptom illness.
The term chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) was first used following publication of a 1998 study describing chronic unexplained symptoms in Air Force veterans of the 1991 Gulf War.
Before 1998, Gulf War syndrome (GWS), Gulf War illness (GWI), unexplained illness, &amp; undiagnosed illness were used interchangeably todescribe chronic unexplained illnesses in 1991 Gulf War veterans illnesses.

@WFLASteveA @SickGulfWarVet (Sean Patrick) is a #veteranmistreated.		@SecWilkie can you assist?		@marcorubio 	@SenBillNelson	@FLGovScott 	@RepCharlieCrist @RepGusBilirakis 	@realDonaldTrump		Direct Message me for contact &amp; information for proper #VACare &amp; #VAServiceConnection.
@TheEllenShow Thanks @TheEllenShow. Would do it all again. Our country must remain free, safe, an example and provide evidence hopes and dreams can come true no matter how small or large, no matter the challenges and sacrafices.
All #VA 2018 ratings have not been made retroactive.  Connection dates are recent by the VA. My many diagnoses have been made by private doctors after a quarter century of exclusionary tests &amp; meds by VA! I started going to private doctors in 2017 for help outside VA; #BadVACare.
In 2018, the #VA rated me 40% for #UndifferentiatedAtrophySpondolytys with #fibromyalgia. Combined rating was made 60% by the VA.
In 2018, the #VA rated me 10% for tinnitus &amp; 0% for hearing loss. Combined rating was made 40% by the VA.
After contesting the #VA 0% decision, in 1994, VA rated me 30% for GERD.  I have filed many claims &amp; been denied for 25+ years while reporting many all over muscle &amp; joint aches, malaise, migraines, all over body spasms, cramping, &amp; twitching, IBS, vision probs, fog &amp;  bleeds.
The VA rated me 100% for #VisceralTropicLieshmaniasis convalecense after treatment in the Army for 1 year from 1991 to 1992 then dropped me to 0% saying there were no residuals.
My request to switch doctors at the VA was processed for a new #VA #primaryhealthcare location.  This will save stress, time, money, wear on car, while providing more of the care needed; faster &amp; simpler using the Tampa VA Hospital rather than St. Pete VA Bay Pines. #VACare
Requesting to switch doctors at the VA so I do not have to drive 1.5 hours in traffic each way to my current #VA #primaryhealthcare doctor.
On this #Veterans #Day, I go to the #VA #hospital overnight for a #sleepstudy. The purpose is to determine how my #sleep #patterns may be compounding my #demetia and other multiple #Gulf #War #Illness symptoms.
@realDonaldTrump, use my case as a #SickGulfWarVet case study when considering any VA reform vote.  I am still not appropriately VA service connected after disease from the #Gulf #War, multiple #GWI chronic diagnoses &amp; recently diagnosed #dementia. I'm 48.
@TODAYshow &amp; @FoxNews, this Veterans Day, it honors the sacrafice of all serving &amp; who have served.  Read a #SickGulfWarVet story re: VA treatment of veterans with Gulf War Illness (#GWI). It helps bring awareness of veteran needs after welcomed home. Thanks. #TODAY @WillieGeist

In war, there are no unwounded soldiers.
Mitochondria, the energy powerhouses of cells, are highly sensitive to damage caused by toxins.
#Mitochondrial #dysfunction of veterans with #GWI helps explain persistence of illness over 25 years. #Chemical &amp; #environmental #exposures during #deployment may have provided initial harm to #mtDNA &amp; accumulation of damage, noted by researchers.   https://t.co/9DUxkCgymD
@DavidLaneSr3 @realDonaldTrump Sincere thanks.
My small service dog helps with more than most realize:	1 reminds to take meds	2 increases pain tolerance	3 reduces anxiety attacks	4 relieves depression	5 sound sleep	6 assists hearing w/ alerts	7 falling awareness	8 mobility	9 balance	10 social integration	11 peace of mind
@FLGovScott, when you take Senate office (congrats BTW!), pls look into my case as a #SickGulfWarVet when considering any VA reform vote.  I am still not 100% service connected after disease from the #Gulf #War, multiple #GWI chronic diagnoses &amp; recently diagnosed #dementia. #Ill
My service dog - love her! https://t.co/PGo9aNRit4

Fatigue with dementia &amp; its symptoms are tough to understand per many medical articles. People with dementia may: tire very easily, refuse to do even low-key activities or sleep a lot more than they used to.
Depression is estimated in 40% of people diagnosed with dementia. The physical and emotional challenges create a loss of independence &amp; lower self-esteem. Problems concentrating &amp; involuntary lifestyle changes are also factors.
Dementia fatigue is a term used to describe the decreased energy level fairly common with dementia. While people associate memory loss and confusion with the beginning stages of the disease, low energy is an equally challenging symptom to manage.
Poor nutrition - lack of a balanced diet and too many sugary foods can lead to vitamin deficiencies. Being deficient in vitamins D or B can cause fatigue, as can low levels of copper, iron or magnesium.
Sleep Problems - researchers believe the damage from dementia disrupts the body’s natural circadian rhythm creating problems sleeping. Even though physically exhausted, patients may be unable to sleep for extended periods of time.
Chemical-warfare agents detected by Coalition forces during the Gulf War include agents tabun (GA), sarin (GB), and cyclosarin (GF) and the blister agents sulfur-mustard and lewisite.  Aug 2, 1990

Commonly reported problems include fatigue, moodiness, cognitive problems, muscle and joint pain, shortness of breath and rashes.
In 1992, the VA created the Persian Gulf Registry. Original purpose was to database medical &amp; other data on Gulf War veterans &amp; serve as basis for future medical surveillance/research. It became apparent several exposure issues &amp; a host of symptoms needed further investigation.
Following the war, most veterans returned home and resumed their normal activities. Within a relatively short time, however, some began to report health problems they believed were connected to their service in the Gulf.

In 2016, the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded there was sufficient evidence of a positive association between deployment to the 1990-91 Gulf War and Gulf War Illness.
2008 VA GWI report &amp; the Health of Gulf War Vets suggest a link between GWI &amp; chronic, nonspecific inflammation of the central nervous system causing pain, fatigue &amp; memory issues, possibly due to pathologically persistent increases in cytokines suggests further research needed.
This year I realized, I suffer from #PTSD over the decades since #DesertStorm. I have self-doctored to keep stability for everyone else -- at least I thought was the case. This resulted in strife &amp; unintentional ramifications. It is a war within.
The law provides for presumptive service connection for a “qualifying chronic disability.” A qualifying chronic disability means a chronic disability resulting from “an undiagnosed illness” or a MUCMI defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms.
After the 1991 Gulf War, Congress enacted statutory directives at § 38 U.S.C. 1117, which addressed a range of disabilities in veterans who served in Southwest Asia. VA then promulgated its regulations at 38 C.F.R. § 3.3.17.
My passion is to bring awareness to the public, other #GulfWarVeterans and their families.  What #Gulf #War #Veterans may be experiencing as issues both physically and/or mentally has causation to the #GulfWar if they served in theater.
@GomesChantel @LindaMarkss I have been fighting the VA for over a quarter century for war related conditions as a result of it.
The Gulf War, codenamed Operation Desert Shield during buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm in its combat phase, was a war waged by coalition forces from 35 nations led by the US against Iraq due to Iraq's invasion &amp; annexation of Kuwait.

VA has funded millions of dollars for Gulf War Illness #research.
Many reputable colleges like Boston &amp; Georgetown Universities have participated in studies as well as NIH, Walter Reed and the VA.
The changes appear distinct from multiple sclerosis, major depression, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Researchers have discovered veterans who suffer from “Gulf War Illness” have physical changes in their brains and may account for pain from actions as simple as putting on a shirt.
Alterations in cognition, brain structure and exercise-induced symptoms found in the veterans were absent in a control group.
Study groups showed compensatory use of different parts of the brain prior to stress tests, followed by the inability to use those areas after exercise. Such compensatory behavior is a trait often observed in neurodegenerative disorders.
A recent study, using functional MRI, found one group of veterans had atrophy in the brainstem, which regulates heart rate, while another showed atrophy in cortical regions adjacent to pain perception.
A study showed Gulf War veterans had abnormalities in the bundle of nerve fibers connecting the brain areas involved in the processing and perception of pain and fatigue.
Gulf War Illness is  believed to have affected more than 200,000 military personnel who served in the 1990-1991 Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm and were exposed to nerve agents, pesticides and herbicides and other toxic chemicals.
The symptoms – which have not been widely accepted by the public or medical professionals – range from mild to debilitating, and can include widespread pain, fatigue and headache as well as cognitive and gastrointestinal dysfunctions.

This is #MyGulfWarStory.
More than #650K #Service #members #served in #Operation #Desert #Shield &amp; #Desert #Storm from August 2, 1990 to July 31, 1991. It is #documented by several #sources about #onethird - 175,000 to 250,000 in total - have Gulf War #Illness (aka. #GWI). #TrueStory I am one of the 1/3.
I am registered in the #GulfWarRegistry.
Once I gathered all medical records from disparate systems, I had to receive an order from my VA primary care doctor to have those records scanned into the VA system for treatment, diagnoses and claim reference.
My story is meant to provide hope, encouragement &amp; some insight for others to understand the impacts of war on veterans and their loved ones. Veterans must advocate for themselves for ultimately their families and overall well being. The VA must do better &amp; more -- faster.
Meanwhile, I have had to do all research, endure pain, work full time, raise a family and force myself while suffering to work every morning hardly able to move, focus, concentrate or not have all over pain -- all with a smile like nothing was wrong or you're considered troubled.
I had to write the Army, NIH &amp; Bethesda to receive all of my medical records to provide those to the VA; rather than, the VA getting those records on my behalf in support of Gulf war related symptom treatments and claims. I even had to gather SOME VA HOSPITAL evidence!
All my diagnoses are presumptive illnesses associated with Gulf War Illness. Presumptive means I should not have to prove service connection. This means since I was in war theater &amp; filed by deadlines, the VA should service connect these issues and treat &amp; rate them accordingly.
I have electronic formatted all records and documents for ease of reference, delivery &amp; use by anyone using them including the VA. This helps me ensure everyone understands my case clearly.
I have thoroughly documented my case for doctors; even to the point of highlighting notes in my military service medical records. I have also written a summarization of all symptoms,  prescriptions, diagnoses, doctors, hospital ERs and etc. since 1991.
At every turn, I have had to prove my symptoms to the VA and fight VA decisions rather than the VA doing the right thing and treating and rating my symptoms accordingly.
Since 1991, I have had multiple Gulf War related symptoms labeled either "unexplained", "uncharacteristic", "unassociated to visceral leishmaniasis" or "unidentifiable" by the VA.
Congress never undeclared the Middle East a war zone after Desert Storm. This allowed the VA to say things are in a "pending status", "various Gulf War medical symptoms were unratable until additional research was complete" or "they were not authorized to rate these vets".
Desert Storm theater: dangerous pesticides &amp; insecticides were used, nerve agent countering PB pills were administered to troops, we were next to oil refineries, enemy chemical munitions were bombed resulting in significant cloud drifts documented by BBC &amp; burn pits were common.
Desert Storm prep: we received many experimental vaccinations, worked with munition prep, and used paints containing dangerous chemicals now documented to have impacted Gulf War veterans.
Upon leaving the Army, I transitioned straight into the VA system which knew little about visceral leishmaniasis. I had follow-up visits with Walter Reed Army Medical Center &amp; NIH after one year.  At the point of the follow-ups in 1992, I was a civilian in the VA system.
The Army involuntarily extended me to September 30, 1991 to receive treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. I returned from Desert Storm in April 1991 &amp; the disease manifested itself in July 1991. I was to ETS (leave) the Army in August 1991.
In general, most American doctors know very little about visceral leishmaniasis. It is a disease characteristic to areas of the equator &amp; transmitted by sand flies.  The VA could not deny this being war service related.
While treated with pentostam, I had to undergo EKG's every few days since the heart is a muscle.  They had to ensure my heart was functioning properly.
I was treated by Walter Reed Army Medical Center and NIH for #VisceralLeishmaniasis in 1991 using a British protocol drug called pentostam via 30-day, daily interveinous. The drug is based on metal and turns your muscles into the Tin Man; making it difficult &amp; painful to move.
I was diagnosed with #UndifferentiatedAtrophySpondolytys in 2014. It takes years to diagnose after many exclusionary tests &amp; medication trials like prednisone, methotrexate &amp; gabapentin.  I took all with no relief.  Methotrexate worsened my symptoms. I had to wean myself off it.
I was diagnosed #HighBloodPressure in 2010 by Dr. White in Columbus Ohio.  My BMI was 15% at the time and 5 years previously. My painful symptoms began worsening in 2007.  Pain causes blood pressure to raise in response to it. #Fibromyalgia causes all-over body pain.
Early #dementia onset may take years to diagnose after many exclusionary tests.
#Fibromyalgia takes years to diagnose after many exclusionary tests.
Over quarter century, I have researched &amp; questioned my symptoms, gathered records &amp; evidence &amp; pursued doctors inside the VA for them to see, treat &amp; explain symptoms. Result: private doctor visits for unvested, unbiased medical opinions related to military war service disease.
To be diagnosed by the VA for #Fibromyalgia, I first had to have private doctors diagnose it.  The same for #dementia.  Both diagnosed the past year although symptoms have existed years.
I have been responsible for paying all medical insurance premiums, medicines, emergency room visits, private doctor visits, private tests and travel.
My symptoms are documented in my military service, CDC, NIH, Bethesda Navy Hospital and VA medical records.  I have also provided all documentation from private doctors including medical records and Nexus statements. The VA has #denied all symptom claims except GERD and Tinnitus.
Nonetheless, I have suffered multiple symptoms since 1991 after having #VisceralLeishmaniasis.
I am using this feed to document my story for my wife, my kids, my family, other disabled veterans and general public awareness of veteran issues returning from war and entering the VA system.
I was reported to CDC in 1991 for #VisceralLeishmaniasis.
I was treated by #WalterReedArmyMedicalCeneter, #NIH, #BethesdaNavyHospital and #VeteransAdministration.
