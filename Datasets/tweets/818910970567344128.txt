RT @realDonaldTrump: GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!
Another jobs report under @POTUS’ leadership showing STRONG manufacturing growth. In fact, the 284,000 new manufacturing jobs in 2018 are the MOST new manufacturing jobs in a single year since 1997! PROMISES MADE! PROMISES KEPT! https://t.co/22R1DmZ6iA
JOBS! JOBS! JOBS! This morning’s jobs report once again proves @POTUS Trump’s America First agenda is WORKING, creating 312,000 new jobs in December and a total of MORE THAN FIVE MILLION NEW JOBS since the election. GREAT jobs report! https://t.co/xUskIkQWAN
Bottom line – if there’s NO WALL, there’s NO DEAL. https://t.co/Zopic6se0T
Spoke with @TuckerCarlson earlier today at the @WhiteHouse. @POTUS has made it clear we’re here to make a deal, but it’s a deal that’s going to result in achieving real gains on border security.  Watch @FoxNews at 8!
Watch @TuckerCarlson on @FoxNews tonight at 8 PM – I talked with him about the need for BORDER SECURITY. We have a worsening crisis at our border, and the American people deserve better! https://t.co/Or41WrLjON
The American people know that we have a crisis at our southern border. And @POTUS &amp; our entire administration are absolutely committed to continuing to work until we achieve real measurable progress to secure our border. The American people deserve nothing less.
A great honor to participate in swearing-in ceremonies for members of the US Senate. @POTUS and I are looking forward to meeting tomorrow with Republican and Democrat leadership to continue our discussions on border security.

Jon Tester said he’d “work with anybody to cut taxes for Montana families &amp; small businesses.” But when he actually had the opportunity to vote to cut your taxes, Jon Tester voted no. When the time came to cut taxes on MT business owners, farmers, &amp; ranchers, Jon Tester voted no.
We cut taxes for working families—the typical family of 4 in Montana will save $2,200+ on their taxes when the tax cuts take full effect! We cut taxes for businesses large &amp; small so companies here in MT can compete &amp; win &amp; create jobs against any company anywhere in the world.

As I told @BretBaier, Judge Kavanaugh is someone that has the character, background, career &amp; the record that gave @POTUS Trump the confidence to know he would be another constitutional conservative who would faithfully interpret the Constitution as written. https://t.co/S1m0zRbflk
As I told @RushLimbaugh, there’s an @NRO story on Judge Kavanaugh’s remarks about Justice Scalia back in 2016. He describes Justice Scalia as someone who was and remains a hero and role model to him. Read the @NRO story here: https://t.co/gOMB0pDSom https://t.co/IGMdtyr8wZ
As I told @TonyKatz, the question for Hoosiers is: Is @SenDonnelly going to stand with Chuck Schumer and the American left, or is he going to stand up and support the most qualified &amp; the most deserving nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States in Judge Brett Kavanaugh? https://t.co/ZRAkLM9bDi

For almost half a century, Nucor Steel has been a key part of why steel in America is the best steel in the world. Some of the greatest buildings in this country – including One World Trade Center and Yankee stadium in New York City – were built with Nucor steel. https://t.co/YVhPCz3Hgi

Since Ohio voted to elect our President, businesses have created more than 3.4 million jobs – including nearly 100,000 new jobs right here in Ohio in just a year and a half. https://t.co/5wn4exXVdO
And this is just the beginning, because our tax cuts will keep spurring more growth and higher wages – and in the years ahead Ohio workers can expect to see their annual salaries increase by about $4,000.

I want to thank the remarkable families who’ve stepped up in times of great hardship and pain and struggle in their lives to make America a better place for other families. They fought to improve access to the American people to lifesaving medicines and care. #RightToTry
Today, @POTUS Trump delivers on a promise he made to the American people.

Just spoke with @GovLarryHogan about the terrible flooding in Ellicott City and the loss of Eddison Hermond. @FEMA is on site &amp; at @POTUS’ direction, we will continue to provide support for families and businesses throughout the affected area. We are with you.
Saddened to learn of the loss of Maryland’s Eddison Hermond—the brave National Guardsman &amp; Air Force veteran who lost his life rendering assistance to a neighbor. Eddison lived a life of service to his nation. Our condolences &amp; prayers to his family. God bless Eddison Hermond.
For the families of our fallen heroes, every day is Memorial Day. Thank you to these courageous families and to all the families across America who lost loved ones serving in our Armed Forces. We are with you. America honors our fallen heroes and all of you this #MemorialDay https://t.co/asstpvqUHc

Wherever your duties take you, stay true to the inscription on the Quarterdeck of Chase Hall – “Who Lives Here Reveres Honor, Honors Duty.”		Hold fast to those words that you chose as your class motto: “Sacrifice of Self, Service to Others.”
Officers, you have been called to serve. Practice servant leadership in the care, the concern, and the attention that you, as officers, demonstrate to the courageous men and women of the @USCoastGuard who you lead – and you will succeed.
As commissioned officers, you’re called not just to lead, but also to serve those under your watch. And this will be one of the greatest honors of your lives – for the @USCoastGuard is filled with the toughest, bravest, and most dedicated Americans.
At this very moment, the world’s most dangerous terrorist and criminal organizations are working to gain a foothold across the Western Hemisphere, to threaten our people and our very way of life.
As you’ve seen during your summer assignments, security risks that were once confined to far flung corners of the world are now closer to endangering our homeland than ever before – from nuclear proliferation to radical Islamic terrorism, and the rogue regimes that finance both.
As you prepare to assume your duties as officers in the @USCoastGuard, you do so at a time of historic investment in our Armed Forces – as you accept the responsibility to lead Coast Guardsmen and women, I promise you: your Commander-in-Chief will always have your back.
You were called to serve. 		You answered that call by coming here, to this Academy, and dedicating your talents and your energy to saving lives, enforcing our nation’s laws, and securing our homeland in times of peace and in times of war.
It is my great honor to join you today at the 137th commencement ceremony for this exceptional institution – to celebrate the achievements and boundless future ahead of the 208 extraordinary cadets graduating today – the @USCGAcademy Class of 2018! https://t.co/VYnk1S1EUI

Under @POTUS Donald Trump, we will always fight for you – we will always support you – and we will never stop striving to be worthy of your noble service and sacrifice. #PoliceWeek
You are the peace keepers, the shield for the innocent and vulnerable, the guardians standing between us and violence and lawlessness.
The fallen heroes we remember today all answered the same call of duty to protect and serve. And their hearts were filled with the same selfless courage… and love. For “no greater love has a man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.” #PoliceWeek
This year alone, we’ve seen attacks that have claimed the lives of 28 heroes.
But as all of you know – and as this day of remembrance so vividly reminds us – there is much work to be done to ensure the safety and security of our law enforcement. #PoliceWeek
We are with you.		We stand with you.		And we will always give those who serve on the Thin Blue Line of law enforcement the HONOR and RESPECT you earn every single day!

As it has been in the past, so it shall be in the future: America stands with Israel. https://t.co/OI6PbAwXfA
As we look at Israel today, it is extraordinary to behold all the progress she has made, and the example that she sets. Today, the modern State of Israel is not only 70 years old – Israel is 70 years strong. https://t.co/8z1p2dW23f
Israel will go from strength to strength – and her first 70 years will just be a glimpse of what’s to come – and the United States and Israel will meet our glorious future together.
And we stand with Israel because that’s what Americans have always done – for in the story of Israel, we see the power of faith, and the promise of hope.
We stand with Israel because her cause is our cause, her values are our values, and her fight is our fight. 		We stand with Israel because we believe in right over wrong, good over evil, and liberty over tyranny.
And so today, let me assure you all… the United States of America will never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon – that is our solemn promise to Israel and to the world!
As @POTUS said, the Iran deal “didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.” In fact, Iran’s unprecedented missile attacks on Israel last week only confirmed the President’s decision, and this dangerous act of aggression only strengthened our resolve.
By finally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the United States has chosen fact over fiction – and fact is the only true foundation for a just and lasting peace. And as @POTUS Trump made clear this morning, “our greatest hope is for peace.”
Just as President Truman made history then, @POTUS Trump has made history now — thanks to @POTUS’ leadership, almost exactly 70 years to the minute since the rebirth of the Jewish State, the American Embassy officially opened in Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel!
It is my distinct honor to accept this unique recognition, from the State of Israel, for the greatest defender of the Jewish State ever to sit in the Oval Office. I know the President is honored by this expression of the high esteem and great affection from the people of Israel.
It is deeply humbling to stand here with you on this extraordinary day – as we celebrate 70 Years of Israel’s Independence.

It was in Jerusalem that King David consecrated the capital of the Kingdom of Israel. Since its rebirth, the modern State of Israel has called Jerusalem the seat of its government. Today @POTUS &amp; the American people acknowledge this historic truth w the opening of the US Embassy. https://t.co/tTNSJQVftq

To the graduates of @Hillsdale: You are beginning your careers at a time of a growing American economy and restored American stature at home and abroad. Faith in America is rising once again. https://t.co/WK84wMJcWz
Congratulations to the @Hillsdale College Class of 2018. 		Right after WE get done making this nation great again, I know YOUR generation will make America greater than ever before.
The most heroic acts &amp; greatest feats aren’t the stuff of headlines &amp; fame. They’re actually the daily choices that you make &amp; the habits you’ve already begun to form.		Ultimately, whether you renew America comes down to whether you live what you have learned at @Hillsdale.
Your education in the liberal arts has empowered you to conserve the foundations of our freedom… and you are now uniquely suited – and I believe you are uniquely called – to renew the fabric of our national life.
I encourage you to take your deepest-held convictions into every facet of your life – and add your voices, and your values, to this new American awakening.
Faith has always been the wellspring of hope for millions of Americans, and from our Founding, faith has been the foundation of our freedom, and religion essential to our republic.
Religion in America isn’t receding – just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life with every passing day.
The percentage of Americans who live out their religion on a weekly basis – by praying, going to church, and reading and believing in the Bible – has remained remarkably consistent over the decades, even as the population of the United States has grown by leaps and bounds.
We live in a time when traditional values, even religious conviction, are increasingly marginalized by a secular popular culture – a time when it's become acceptable, even fashionable, to malign religious belief. I still believe with all my heart that FAITH in America is rising.
Faith in America is rising again because @POTUS Trump and our entire administration have been advancing the very principles that you learned here in the halls of @Hillsdale College.
Here at home, businesses large and small are growing again – more than 3.1 million new jobs, unemployment at a 17-year low, and the best news of all for you new graduates today, there are more job openings across America than any time in the history of this country.
On the world stage, you’ve seen America embracing our role as leader of the free world – with action just this week regarding Iran, North Korea, and on Monday, America will lead the world again when we open our new Embassy in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel!
The America that awaits your energies and ambitions is experiencing a new era of opportunity and optimism.		You are beginning your careers at a time of a growing American economy and a restored American stature at home and abroad. And faith in America is rising again!
Your education at @Hillsdale has taught you not what to do, but what to be – and today, you will receive a diploma that has been minted in independence and tempered with truth.

The U.S has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Unfortunately, many of our European partners, as well as the United Nations, have thus far failed to forcefully speak out on the growing crisis in Iran. It’s time for them to stand up. 		Read my op-ed here: https://t.co/9aPzsxAGuD
Today, the Iranian people are once again rising up to demand freedom and opportunity, and under @POTUS Trump, the United States is standing with them. This time, we will not be silent. 		Read my op-ed in the @WashingtonPost: https://t.co/9aPzsxAGuD
.@VOANews: "2018 vs 2009: The Trump administration's quick embrace of the Iran demonstrations contrasts with the Obama administration's more muted response to street protests in 2009 that lasted for months before dissipating under a deadly gov't crackdown" https://t.co/TXjjvgli24
.@POTUS Trump made it clear: America will not be bullied, America will not be threatened, and the United States of America has managed to marshal an unprecedented amount of economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. https://t.co/L0kK52AYuY
The United States of America is going to continue to send an unambiguous message that the American people stand with freedom-loving people in Iran and around the world. #IranProtests https://t.co/o5JmgsVzPE
I remember in 2009 people in Iran demonstrating incredible courage for a democratic &amp; free future. We looked to the White House in 2009 for American leadership &amp; there was none. Today the U.S stands w/ Iranians who want a better, more prosperous &amp; freer future. #IranProtests https://t.co/dyYsr5wuaE
Under @POTUS Trump, the people of Iran are not alone. The American people stand with them.  And if they will just continue to show the courage of their convictions and reach out and embrace a free and democratic future, America and the world will be with them. #IranProtests https://t.co/RmtM8QgRlY
Great to catch up with two of my predecessors -- Vice Presidents @JoeBiden &amp; Walter Mondale on Capitol Hill earlier today. Every day I am humbled and honored by the opportunity to hold this office. https://t.co/NeQ4Po8qly
My hope is that the people of Iran understand that the U.S &amp; the people of this country are their natural ally. We want to see them achieve a free and democratic future. We want to see them step away from a regime that continues to menace &amp; threaten the world. #IranProtests
The contrast between the silence and the failure to support freedom in the last administration, and @POTUS Trump's unapologetic willingness to stand w/ the courageous people of Iran - I know it is giving hope to the people on the streets of those cities across Iran. #IranProtests
Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. To see the people of Iran rising up to demand change in their country should hearten every freedom-loving American and people who cherish freedom around the world. #IranProtests
As I told @Greta during our interview for @VOAnews, the clear affirmation &amp; support that @POTUS Trump has provided to protestors rising up in cities across Iran is dramatic &amp; consistent with America's role in the world as a leading champion of freedom. #IranProtests

Deeply humbling for me to stand before so many heroes at Arlington Cemetery this morning. Our nation owes a debt to our veterans, and it is a debt we can never fully repay - but on this Veterans Day, and every day, we will strive to do just that. https://t.co/VJBViW2WyR
Find a veteran and say, thank you for your service. Thank them for their courage. Thank them for your freedom. And thank them for doing their part to preserve this last best hope of Earth, for ourselves, and our posterity. #VeteransDay https://t.co/oeX0tC19H6
This is the land of the free because it’s still the home of the brave. #VeteransDay  https://t.co/qvBTmQphb8
It is deeply humbling for me to stand before so many heroes. #VeteransDay  https://t.co/AxHtlDuYR7
On this Veterans Day, we honor those who served. But as our veterans understand better than most, we also honor their service by ensuring that those serving in our Armed Forces today have the resources &amp; support they need to defend this nation. #VeteransDay https://t.co/0O8LOOvF7N
As @POTUS has said, we will not rest or relent until “all of America’s great veterans receive the care they so richly deserve.” #VeteransDay https://t.co/vF0IthcGac
We are grateful for your service. We are grateful for your sacrifice. And to our veterans, I make this promise - just as you fought for us, we will always fight for you. #VeteransDay
Today is the day when across America in gatherings large &amp; small we pause to remember those who served. #VeteransDay https://t.co/LqnblSwqhi

We need the support of every Hoosier in Congress. I know we'll be able to count on @SenToddYoung, but Indiana also needs to be able to count on @SenDonnelly to VOTE FOR TAX RELIEF for the people of the Hoosier State. https://t.co/wLmXgWTxtv

Words fail when saints and heroes fall. We gathered last night to extend our deepest sympathies to the families of the fallen &amp; injured. The Bible tells us that, “The Lord is close to the broken-hearted" &amp; that will be our prayer for them from this day forward. #SutherlandSprings https://t.co/PA0IJevCps
This weekend I hope places of worship all across America will be filled to overflowing. I hope that Americans of every background &amp; belief will send a chorus of prayers from their hearts into the heart of heaven for these families, for #SutherlandSprings community &amp; for this land https://t.co/n7Z1voJEHb
We come together as one nation and one people to support our fellow Americans in their hour of need. Faith is stronger than evil. No attack, no act of violence will ever break our spirit or diminish the faith of the American people. https://t.co/pCny5hqVkf
Grateful to the faith leaders who joined us last night - thank you for your outpouring of support for your fellow Texans. And thank you to the heroic actions of neighbors, law enforcement &amp; the first responders who saved lives by their swift action on Sunday. #SutherlandSprings https://t.co/c3QDn83Gfr
As @POTUS Trump said, “In dark times like these…we pull together, we join hands, we lock arms, &amp; through the tears &amp; the sadness, we stand strong.” We do this because that’s what Americans always do. We come together as one nation and as one people. #SutherlandSprings https://t.co/0oSCj2Jjfm
As @POTUS often says, when one part of America hurts, we all hurt – when one part of America struggles, we all struggle – &amp; when one part of America cries out for help, we all come together. I know the hearts and prayers of every American are in #SutherlandSprings. https://t.co/hm7zerY09K
We mourn with those who mourn, and we grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope – for our faith, and our heroes, give us hope. #SutherlandSprings https://t.co/uX1uZAhMpj
.@POTUS asked Karen &amp; me to be in Texas to express our deepest sympathies &amp; our resolve. No attack, no act of violence, will ever break our spirit or diminish the faith of the American people. #SutherlandSprings https://t.co/KAWrKSGE1Y
