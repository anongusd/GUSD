@ZoeTillman "there was semen on Jane Doe‚Äôs pants, but investigators couldn‚Äôt pull a DNA profile from the sperm. Other DNA samples retrieved...determined to be Jane Doe...and one other individual who was male" 	So, none of the male DNA came from sperm?
@ZoeTillman I'm confused: "she said she woke up naked in the man‚Äôs bed the next day." Did she claim she was too drunk to leave or that she was drugged? Was she tested for GHB or Rohypnol? 	Also, what does "two sources of DNA were found on Jane Doe" mean? Does she claim more than 1 assailant?
