@PattyMurray When Obama was President and Democrats controlled the House and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate they did nothing on immigration. Will Democrats do nothing again now that @POTUS is courageously leading &amp; offering a bipartisan solution vast majority of Americans support?
@PattyMurray #democrats , #MSM , and the far left are responsible for the division. You take everything @realDonaldTrump says and spin it to fit your narrative to get a hateful reaction from your base. And trust me when I say there's a lot of hate from the left.
@RealJamesWoods @slaukers Just because you don't hear it reported by the #MSM doesn't mean it doesn't exist

@MayorJenny Are you going to be the kind of mayor that just repeats the nonsensical rhetoric of the far left? Did you get elected by bashing Trump. Seattle is in BIG trouble. SAD
