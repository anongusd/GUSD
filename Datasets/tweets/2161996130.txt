@KamalaHarris No I will not, I am not going to band wagon against an atrocious practice of falsely accusing political figures decades after the alleged event just to attempt to force them out of their position. You guys have fun with your corrupt anti-democratic idealism!
@KamalaHarris Ye-No... I oppose this and basically every accusation in the media nowadays. I can almost guarantee that 95% of the "He did this 30~ years ago" accusations are about as true as the moon is made of cheese. Enough of the crap, it is plaguing our school systems and children.
@AP Hasn't Indonesia had enough over the past few days? Earth Quake followed by full scale eruption? Its like kicking a dead horse. Earth: *Quakes* Ooo I killed 1400+ people with that! Earth: Hm... Not good enough. *Erupts* That'll get em' good.
@CNN Boycott New Zealand? A customs practice like this is an abhorrent breaching of personal privacy and personal information of contacts an individual has in their phone. In our generation you can find most of if not all of the information you could want about someone on their phone.
@TuckerCarlson @BrettKavanaugh I am being falsely accused of sexual harassment by someone when their accusation is baseless and basically impossible
@TuckerCarlson Hey @TuckerCarlson, I am facing false accusations that have no evidence at a college here in Cali. Any chance to get this out there too? Cause I am feeling the same burns as @BrettKavanaugh

and it starts here, really it does. #NationalSchoolWalkout
However, regardless of my distaste with the actual movement itself, I urge all individuals not to bash the children. Instead, support them and help them to become active members in the political process.		We as a country have become politically lax, time to change that -
#NationalSchoolWalkout	We are seeing the view point ONLY of students who are against firearms. Why? The answer is obvious and me saying anything against this protest will be ignored. However, I support the mere ideals that are children actually taking part in politics finally.

@AmyMek Now as a note, I don't agree with what they are walking out for, but I do like the fact that they are willing to partake in politics for once...

@ArchKennedy I don't have guns, but I really want guns. I will inherit multiple firearms from rifles to hand guns. I want this country to understand that the gun is not the problem, the people are. We don't need to ban guns, we need to take them from psychos.
@unscriptedmike I wish my generation understood this stuff. I am completely against all this anti-gun stuff and I am part of this high school generation. I will walk out, but not to protest. I want people to participate in politics and shape the country instead of hiding around.
@thebradfordfile Yet "skipping school" has helped bring about equal rights for chicano students back in the day. How is walking out a bad thing? Other than it stunts learning for a day. We as students have a voice and a walkout is one way to make that voice HEARD
@RealSlimSupreme You're not entirely wrong my friend, though I am part of that generation I happen to have more than half a mind to know what is right. I am not joining the walkout for anything other than to push people to voice their opinions and actually take part in politics.
@LadyLtColumbo Yea, I am a High School student, but I honestly don't care of an adult "bullies" me. I know that I am the next generation to take control of this country, and even though I don't agree with shutting firearms down, it is time for the next generation to shape it's future

@guiscaesar @gohexyourself @cnnbrk Sure, we haven't seen a massive amount of bombings, but think of the damage they cause, imagine an entire school classroom blown up by a homemade grenade, 30 dead in bomb. Is that a better situation for you?
@guiscaesar @gohexyourself @cnnbrk and you just go straight to "oh yea, this many people died in the meantime but firearms." The point isn't how many are dieing, its the fact that if you make guns impossible to get then explosives and other items become the new means. EXPLOSIVES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO KILL MORE!
@guiscaesar @gohexyourself @cnnbrk You know what, at this point I am not even going to argue with you, you are shutting out the whole point of what I was talking about. Completely ignoring it in EVERY sense.
@guiscaesar @ProfessorJunkie @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk Look at the Parkland Shooting! He was there for YEARS! Yet the FBI or the CIA did NOTHING to stop him from killing 17 people, is that not a problem to you!?
@guiscaesar @ProfessorJunkie @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk https://t.co/Q7KZfbIdKc killed three, injured over 200 and a lot of them required an amputation. You are telling me that the Las Vegas thing was more devastating? More than quadruple the amount of affected people.
@danksurf @guiscaesar @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk and yet banning them altogether ISN'T the option, if you ban them then only those who are willing to obtain them illegally will have them. Then what can the public do? Put their heads in the sand and hope they don't get shot?
@guiscaesar @gohexyourself @cnnbrk Hell, in Austin Texas there have been five bombings in literally less than three weeks!
@guiscaesar @ProfessorJunkie @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk Have you forgotten the most recent bombings, have you forgotten the Boston Race bombing? "Nothing like that has happened since" are you nuts?
@guiscaesar @ProfessorJunkie @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk Well then allow me to pose this to you, if there are SO many warning signs for a mass shooter. Then why doesn't our law enforcement and homeland security ACTUALLY do anything about them? We know the signs are there but we ignore them and let it happen. Why?
@ProfessorJunkie @guiscaesar @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk It's something that amounts to nothing realistically. If people start mass producing explosives and they kill a hundred people, what are we going to do then? We can't regulate bombs because there are DOZENS of ways to make them. Are we going to require a permit for household chem
@guiscaesar @ProfessorJunkie @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk The world as a whole is filled with people who are capable and WILLING to kill others for popularity, revenge, sport, or even just simply fun. IT doesn't matter if guns are in the equation or not, the method will only change from guns to something else.
@guiscaesar @ProfessorJunkie @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk it wouldn't even really lower the amount of violence, it would simply change the method of which it is carried out. That is the point I am trying to give here.
@ProfessorJunkie @cnnbrk I said Gang like, not gangs, they are individuals who live in poverty (not all but some of them) and they are plenty capable of attack people if they are "fucked with"
@guiscaesar @ProfessorJunkie @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk but knives are not the only problem here, hell I could make an explosive if I REALLY wanted to, not like I will but I fairly easily could with the combination of Chlorine and Brake Fluid which causes an incendiary reaction. There are many ways to kill, and some will kill using it
@ProfessorJunkie @guiscaesar @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk The same could be said for guns, and guns cause a lot of noise. Who is to say people would even notice someone being stabbed immediately?
@RoySayWhatNow @cnnbrk It mainly is psychology, poverty can lead to desperation, emphasis on the CAN. Mental Illness plays a big part, rage can play a part, and there are so many more aspects to this.
@ProfessorJunkie @cnnbrk That also doesn't mean that a majority of them will be the shooters, in fact in a general school I would assume quite a few of them would use it for self defense.
@ProfessorJunkie @cnnbrk Not at all, in fact I would expect quite a few. Especially in my school where I am surrounded by gang like individuals.
@guiscaesar @cnnbrk I beg to differ on the kitchen knives bit, it's pretty easy to conceal. I could very easily if I wanted to but I would have no point to do so. Also, Handguns can be pretty hard to conceal because of their size realistically, not as hard as a rifle but still.
@ProfessorJunkie @guiscaesar @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk This guy was pretty damn close, wouldn't you say? https://t.co/TF2LSDcmP7	It takes balls to kill someone frankly, PTSD is an awful thing to be stuck with so I don't know if they are cowards like you say they are.
@guiscaesar @cnnbrk but tell me honestly, how do you RESTRICT KNIVES? You use it for cooking and survival and all of that, are you just going to say to people who want to buy a new kitchen knife "Hey, do you have a permit for that?" That's nonsense, and a gun is a tool like a knife.
@guiscaesar @cnnbrk That is not true either, consider this. You are a worker at a job and you are completely sane. You get fired from your job and you can't get one after that. You are pissed, you get your gun and you go shoot your boss. Is that not 'snapping' suddenly?
@guiscaesar @cnnbrk The UK is essentially the same concept, are you going to ban knives because children are stabbing each other? Of course not. It is a tool used in the kitchen and whatnot. What is a gun? A tool for self defense AND hunting. It has the capable to kill, so do knives
@guiscaesar @cnnbrk That doesn't work for everyone though, I hope you realize that. You can background check someone all you want but if they never show red flags but have the idea to shoot up a school, how do you depict that? Tell me honestly.
@guiscaesar @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk A majority of these murders however are caused by disturbed children and adults who suffered something in their life that screwed their mind up.
@guiscaesar @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk You have to be able to ACCURATELY find that out though, otherwise it is simply a witch hunt for killers, which you can say there is a problem with that altogether.
@guiscaesar @Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk I said nothing about restricting it or not. I said banning firearms altogether is not an option. However if you can ACCURATELY depict if someone is a lunatic then sure, don't permit him access to firearms. He will just use something else but sure, don't sell him a gun.
@guiscaesar @cnnbrk Not necessarily, in other countries they are abused and neglected but they are often too afraid to retaliate. We are in a country where children have the ability to retaliate in more than one way. Firearms just happens to be the most effective.
@Schneider4House @cnnbrk Albeit, it is true that firearms do promote this kind of tendency, but only because it enables it through a quick and effective method. Though so do knives of any form, explosives which can be fairly simple to make, and many other objects we are surrounded with.
@Schneider4House @cnnbrk I can make the claim because I am thinking of solutions, and I am not saying guns are not part of the problem, but they are not the cause, they are the means. If we take away the means, then they will use another means to destroy. Be it explosives, knives, or anything else.
@Bloodyhellman1 @cnnbrk It helps, but does not define it. If you remove guns, then a killer will use a knife. It's less effective but the goal remains the same.
@cnnbrk In order to fix gun violence, we cannot ban guns. That is simply not a valid option. To fix gun violence, we must improve the situation of our people in order to make people happy. This does not solve the problem, but it would help substantially.
@cnnbrk Now it is to be understood that children are not the only ones using ballistic weapons for murderous intent or to cause terror. That is another ballgame altogether. Psychology plays the largest part in this whole issue, citizens are overworked and live in poverty.
@cnnbrk We must consider what conditions these children are in to determine the cause of these violent tendencies. Be it neglect or abuse, mental illnesses, loneliness, or whatever it may be. That is the real problem here.
@cnnbrk It appears that the United States is suffering an influx of disturbed children willing and capable of causing mayhem through the use of firearms. This is no doubt a problem for the country, but guns are not the problem as some may think. Instead it is the psychology of the child.

@CWC_Berkeley Though I do not aspire (currently) to become a professional author. I am designing a novel as of now. Is there any information I should know regarding such a thing? I have the format correct as well as other aspects, but is there any particular thing to understand?
@ldiotNation @FoxNews @travfed Yea and what can they do about occasional shooters who are lunatics? Nothing realistically, banning guns or making them impossible to obtain essentially is not a sane answer. However, what are Democrats doing? Going after guns
So I am writing a novel currently, a story taking place in Virtual Reality decades into the future. Gruesome tales of murder and insanity await!

@healthysuzi @FoxNews @SHAQ Well I have grown up with responsible gun owners as well, but I understand that a lot of things can go wrong once you introduce a large amount of firearms in one place.

@healthysuzi @FoxNews @SHAQ Their viewpoint is important, but it's unrealistic when considering psychology. They can say they will feel safer all they want but in reality being surrounded by armed guards makes a school feel more like a prison.
@mr_mojo112978 @FoxNews @SHAQ Consider it for yourself. In your workplace you have 5 armed guards looking over you as you work with an automatic rifle in hand. Are you going to be like "I LOVE THIS" or "Holy shit, this feels like a prison."
@mr_mojo112978 @FoxNews @SHAQ I do, I am a student in high school and putting more cops inside of the school makes learning difficult. A school is not a prison, it's a learning environment. So that means that the school should be successful in teaching yea? Not scaring all the students with 50 police around
@FoxNews @SHAQ I say no to this, simply for the reason that putting more guns in school does not make children feel safer. Have more police in the general area but don't stick them in the school.

@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis No, but you are justified to call the police and have him dealt with in that sense. Think about our own law. If someone threatens to shoot up a school nowadays they are dealt with, if someone threatens to build a bomb they are dealt with, so why are we letting North Korea?
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis I dont think they really do, North Korea has been separated for so long they don't even have a good grasp of what is really going on outside of North Korea, everything they see is monitored
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis So allowing for our people to be butchered doesn't say anything? What happens if North Korea nukes us? Are we just going to say, "Who cared about the people who just got slaughtered due to inaction, time to go to war with North Korea!"

@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Using Agent Orange to start crippling the "Perfect Army" wouldn't be the worst thing we've done, not that we should have to but North Korea poses a threat of Nuclear Weapons and they are itching to launch one at us, if we can force a surrender then we can avoid mass homicide
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Though the United States is not Judge Jury and Executioner, it is our job as part of the UN to uphold the humanitarian laws in place, and I understand that us attack Korea first is a war crime but we cannot let a butcher go free, it is better to prevent than to retaliate.
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Kim on the other hand has no leash, he can do what he wants when he wants, if we want to make the world a better place then subduing a country like North Korea is part of that job description. They are a threat not only to use but to Russia, China, Japan, Hawaii, South Korea, etc
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Like I said, @realDonaldTrump has a leash through the Congress and Supreme Court, Kim Jong-Un acts like a god with no limits, there is a severe difference. I get that Donald Trump isn't exactly the best human being but he is limited in what he can do.
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Rocket Boy producing Nuclear Weapons is a crime all in itself
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis What do you want us to do? Slap them on the wrist and call them a bad boy?

@mnobamabot1 @realDonaldTrump I've heard and read otherwise, from what i've seen Trump has wanted these Tariffs regardless of other country's tariffs on us
@CanAmCit @FoxNews @RepDeSantis That's a different ballgame altogether, NASA is trying to get a craft to enter earth's atmosphere without blowing up or getting damaged too badly. A nuclear weapon doesn't need to be intact as long as it is a multiple warhead delivery method, each one has it's own detonation.
@Paul3401745 Thats one thing I am afraid of, Trump has the mental ability to improve our economy and whatnot but he's not exactly a diplomat.
RT @FoxNews: .@RepDeSantis: “There’s no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.” https://t.co/GUYP0mXksd
@CanAmCit I understand that, the technology has been around since the 1940s, so how is it unbelievable to think that North Korea doesn't know how to get a nuclear weapon to actually blow up?
@mnobamabot1 @realDonaldTrump I am not so sure, if he just tariffs everything without establishing steel production in the United States to counteract the loss of steel imports then it will hurt us. So we'll see.
@CanAmCit @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Launching a nuclear weapon from land isn't the only delivery method I hope you know who's to say they won't fix the issue in the next few months or simply throw the rocket onto an aquatic vehicle and send it here?
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis North Korea threatens the US and is testing Ballistic Missiles which goes against the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty. We aren't really doing anything to fulfill that treaty with North Korea now are we? Its time to actually make those treaties mean something.
@JB01202017 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Kim Jong-Un is who I am referring to, Trump could be considered in that category but unlike Rocket Boy over in NK Trump doesn't rule the country, the senate and supreme court keep him in check at least in some instances
@CanAmCit @FoxNews @RepDeSantis The point is not if they can load it right now or not, North Korea is making strides to getting one to work, they can reach our western sea board already with a long range missile, all they need to do now is shove some Uranium/Plutonium in it and they will cause major damage.
@FoxNews @RepDeSantis Honestly we should just start safely producing Agent Orange again and start systematically dumping in on North Korea, and you give them three options. Surrender, Go to War and die, or do nothing and die. It's cruel, but it would work for what we need it to do.
@FoxNews @RepDeSantis There is a lot of danger stemming from North Korea, if you want to simplify things, North Korea is a child who found out how to use daddy's shotgun, and we have to subdue the child. We cannot allow this child to feel like it has the power to control the world.

@LindaLutz12 @MikaelKoda @FoxNews My life is positive (generally speaking) and I have learned to deal with a variety of people. I just get enough of it as it is from my peers.
@GeoDagent @MikaelKoda @FoxNews See, my main reason for saying tasers is because it is a non lethal option that is still ranged (a taser gun that is) while still being able to apprehend an assailant. I suppose if done right small firearms can be used too. IF DONE RIGHT.
@Beerboy85 @VG_Venemous @gamespot Kinda like Aim Assist? That could make it work I guess but still a small screen for a mobile phone just sounds like a bad idea, then again everyone ELSE would have that small screen so maybe it wouldnt be that bad.
@VG_Venemous @gamespot Who knows at this point, maybe the Fortnite devs have an idea to revolutionize the mobile shooter genre and make it good, I doubt it but MAYBE
@LindaLutz12 @MikaelKoda @FoxNews True, a lot of them are good but a lot of them are bad as well, really it just depends on where you are. Here in Cali there are some teachers in my school I REALLY like and a couple I really don't like for one reason or another.
@Cronin3920 @MikaelKoda @FoxNews A high voltage tazer gun is enough to put an assailant on the ground so the firearm can be taken away, are you telling me this is just some stupid idea?
@ToddBaumgartne1 @MikaelKoda @FoxNews I dont want guns outlawed, a tazer gun would work cause it is still ranged and fires like a gun in a sense. I don't see why it is THAT laughable
@GeoDagent @MikaelKoda @FoxNews The fact that they are crazy is what is troubling me, I could deal with them having NRA training and whatnot. I just don't think they should have a live firearm in the first place. That's just me though in this conversation
@paperboipaperb1 @FoxNews Who's to say that DT isn't doing a lot of the same stuff by listening ONLY to the NSA half the time cause of the NSA's political power? I believe in a REAL Bipartisan Government where both sides are heard and a compromise is formed through discussion, not what we are now.
@GeoDagent @MikaelKoda @FoxNews That's kinda why I am saying a non-lethal yet effective option of Stun Guns, anyone that isn't on LSD would drop to the floor from one of those hitting them.
@GeoDagent @MikaelKoda @FoxNews Idk, I think the thought of teachers having a firearm would cause terror and an unsafe learning environment cause everyone is nervous that their teacher will go off. On top of that I think the students NOT knowing would make things even worse. Cause then they'd assume all have 1
@Cronin3920 @MikaelKoda @FoxNews I am a student as well, I don't think a teacher should have a 9mm but I would like them to have SOMETHING to protect themselves and us in that situation
@LindaLutz12 @MikaelKoda @FoxNews Most teachers are protected by tenyear, you can't really get rid of them. A lot of teachers should not be in the classroom but it's hard to get rid of them. At least I think that's what you are talking about...? I honestly don't know

@GeoDagent @MikaelKoda @FoxNews I don't agree with arming ALL teachers, in my current high school that would entail over 100 armed individuals in one half mile by half mile area. That's to put it lightly, OVERKILL
@GeoDagent @MikaelKoda @FoxNews That is a good point, I define arming teachers are giving teachers a test similar to the Concealed Carry test to allow them to have a firearm in the classroom, at least if they want to, or allowing those who already have a concealed carry permit to do so after a mental test.
@MikaelKoda @FoxNews blow your arm off or worse, a significant damage gap, they fire slower but are far more lethal. I am not saying you are wrong and I hope you don't say I am, I am just putting something out for you to think about, I am welcome to you discussing this with me!
@MikaelKoda @FoxNews I understand that these (Assault) Rifles can be fired much faster than a larger caliber hunting rifle, but the point stands that being hit by a small caliber (Assault) weapon is most likely not going to be lethal if you're hit in the arm or something, a Hunting Rifle would -
@MikaelKoda @FoxNews I can also argue that most (Assault) Rifles that have been locked on Semi-Auto are much easier to fire than a hunting rifle because the caliber is smaller whilst being able to fire slightly faster. Most actual hunting rifles are high caliber and have a higher mortality rate.
@MikaelKoda @FoxNews in question in this situation. However it is a good alternative to arming teachers with a 9 mm pistol or worse and banning firearms altogether. I understand one of the arguments is that these rifles are not necessary for sport. However -
@MikaelKoda @FoxNews A Tazer gun can drop essentially any human being to the floor as long as they are not on LSD, it is non-lethal unless they have a bad heart, and it gives the teacher the ability to protect the children they are in charge of. The problem of a teacher's mental ability is still-
@MikaelKoda @FoxNews Granted on the other hand, arming teachers is insanity, most teachers are (sadly) too unstable and stressed to possess live firearms in a classroom. I like to propose this to others on this debate by giving teachers a Tazer Gun to apprehend an assailant. Mostly non-lethal option
@MikaelKoda @FoxNews I am a Republican, I like my guns, and I am a student. Does that instantly label me as a school shooter? Of course not, I like guns for sport and whatnot. Banning them only punishes those like me who haven't committed these atrocities of mass murder.
@MikaelKoda @FoxNews I respect the concept of protecting our children above all else, but banning or arming teachers with firearms isnt the solution. Both sides are proposing bull. Banning firearms only allows those with illegal firearms more power and arming teachers is a whole other problem frankly

@SenFeinstein If you try to get Firearms out of illegal markets. You are going to cause more sorrow than it already causes. You would be sending armed police at armed smugglers or going after military personnel who are looking for more money. I am sorry to say but stopping it is impossible

@ThAlMeArCrEq @AP That's true too, there is a problem with that. It has become a norm with our work environments at this point but if children of that age are going to be left home alone then hire a nanny or something for those days.

@smcmac321 @AP Most of the time during those "Walkouts" the people who do walkout end up going to wendys or taco bell or just simply going home. It's a violation of the very idea of a Walkout. It sickens me which is why I want to buy a megaphone and actually control the crowd for something good
@smcmac321 @AP I am barely 17 and I am being more politically active than some of my teachers. I am actively waiting to turn 18 so I can start voting. I want to motivate this backwash school into actually caring about politics.
@smcmac321 @AP the sad thing is that most of the individuals in the school care not for political events or topics. It is somewhat saddening.
@smcmac321 @AP There is one thing I would like to do regarding the whole arming the teachers subject we were on prior to the current subject. I am currently a high school senior and I would like to take control of the crowd on the 14th of march during the national walkout.
@smcmac321 @AP Background checks are fine the way they are frankly. We need mental cognitive tests and psycho analytic tests to determine whether someone is mentally capable of owning a firearm without going ballistic with it.

@smcmac321 @AP I will also say this, I don't agree with arming teachers because that is a learning environment and a gun in a classroom does nothing good. A Tazer gun would suffice to apprehend an assailant. However, I like my guns, I don't own any because I am too young but I like them for-

@theretheirthere @FoxNews @trish_regan @NancyPelosi Yea I get that, but the tax cut enabled states to do that in the first place. Those changes occurred in 2018 in over 18 states so far.
@theretheirthere @FoxNews @trish_regan @NancyPelosi That is where you are wrong, federally it hasn't but states have been increasing it to over 10 dollars.
@NajaySez @FoxNews In my opinion, citizenship should not cost a fortune and take 14 years, the lottery system should be gone, and it should function in a way that forces the individual to at least have a basic understanding of how the government functions and understand the language at least.
@theretheirthere @FoxNews @trish_regan @NancyPelosi That is what government regulation is for, and we have increased the minimum wage as it is. So some times companies don't really have a choice now do they? They could fire people but that also reduces their productivity.
@theretheirthere @FoxNews @trish_regan @NancyPelosi I am not in the workforce yet so no, others in my generation have since they are in the workforce.
@theretheirthere @FoxNews @trish_regan @NancyPelosi It does help people though, just with varying effect. The thing is if these companies are buying stock and whatnot, that means that they have more money which will eventually lead to global wage increases if things are done correctly.
@theretheirthere @FoxNews @trish_regan @NancyPelosi I am not against the Tax Cuts, in fact it benefits my generation since we are getting to the point of working soon. That means that these changes will immediately benefit the new members of the workforce like myself.
@theretheirthere @FoxNews @trish_regan @NancyPelosi The only thing I am afraid of is if the inflation of prices goes out of control and the tax cuts and bonuses will end up making people bankrupt. I only hope that these changes aren't going to start plummeting us into another Great Depression. Only time will tell.
@theretheirthere @FoxNews @trish_regan @NancyPelosi Well who knows it if will be a one time thing? Some companies could have the heart to boost the end year bonuses to 1000 dollars every year from now on thanks to the tax cuts. The tax cuts improve people's wages until they are changed but who knows with the bonuses

@SamMagoon1 @FoxNews Hand Guns are the meat of the matter if you want to attack firearms. The Hand Gun is the most used. There are statistics and everything on the internet proving that. Not every community has murderers in it either, and most shootings occur in cities, not small towns
@belikemike @cpgoodell @FoxNews Where is your proof in that? Give some credible proof that the main perpetrator is white Americans. Cause I can guarantee you that all races are equally due for blame.
@Trump_Factz @FoxNews Because we can't fix it, those who want to kill with it will hide it and use it anyway. All you are doing is taking it away from the law abiding citizens. Are you physically incapable of perceiving that? The only people who WILL give up their firearms are those who abide the law.
@Trump_Factz @FoxNews No, it wouldn't be, because you CAN'T get rid of them. Those who want to kill with a weapon will hide their AR-15s because you apparently ONLY think tat AR-15s are in gun violence. We can't just get rid of them.

@JD_Uppal @FoxNews @KatiePavlich Well first before I list a source, tell me honestly. What sounds easier? Carrying around an AR-15 in public to go shoot up a school, possibly get stopped cause you are carrying around a medium firearm. Or conceal a pistol in your pocket and take it out when you are ready. Really.
@FoxNews @trish_regan That doesn't mean that they will do the damage will they @trish_regan? If you are complaining about Mentally Ill people getting an AR-15 then don't let people who are mentally ill get an AR-15, simple as that, you don't have to ban everyone from ownership of an AR-15
@FoxNews @KatiePavlich Pistols are very simple to conceal in something as basic as your pocket, Large assault weapons require a lot of planning to move around with without being discovered by an authority beforehand. Therefore a large assault weapon is actually pretty inefficient in the scheme of it.
@FoxNews @KatiePavlich Exactly, I understand that the Democrats are using the recent tragedies to their own benefit in getting heavier gun control and all, but the facts are clear that most mass shootings occur as a result of the use of small firearms. A large assault rifle is hard to conceal

@Kotaku "Blaming Violent Video Games stereotype" News flash the people are already fucked up in the head when they shoot people. Nothing MAKES them fucked up in the head unless they are abused as a child.
@RepStephMurphy @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan Sure people can go insane or just on a rampage with a gun without that little trait, but it would help to cut gun violence down
@RepStephMurphy @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan If you REALLY want to "Stop" this madness though, if you may recall. There was a study a couple years ago that was able to identify a part of the brain that enables a person to have the will to kill people. Just have everyone tested for that section and dont give them firearms.
@RepStephMurphy @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan I am not saying this stuff JUST to spite Democrats or anything, though I don't necessarily like really anything you Democrats say half the time nowadays. I want to make a better country that I can live in as the next generation entering the workforce.
@RepStephMurphy @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan Someone with the intent to kill in that manner usually doesn't plan to survive the ordeal. So who cares if they break the law to get a military grade assault rifle? The shooter sure as hell doesn't.
@RepStephMurphy @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan Also before anyone even says it, banning gun sales in the United States is not an option. All it does is make the danger of gun violence even more terrifying. Consider this, someone who wants to kill with a firearm will get one somehow. Be it legally or illegally.
@RepStephMurphy @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan Sorry to burst your little thought bubble but you don't "Stop" gun violence. It doesn't matter how many facts you have. You don't stop it. The only thing to do is increase security in every nook and cranny, and I can guarantee that no one wants that.
@SenateDems @RonWyden If you guys can manage that, that would be the best thing this country has seen in years. The tax cuts is just phase one because it gives incentives to companies large in small to pay workers more and to stay here without moving over seas. Take this change and run with it
@SenateDems @RonWyden If you democrats REALLY want to help America, try to help the Republicans make a balance that works. Low enough taxation that companies will stay. High enough wages that people can live OUT of poverty (without welfare). and price limits both parties can agree with.
@SenateDems @RonWyden Now don't get me wrong, I understand the whole concept of inflation and whatnot with rising wages, but that is what regulations and policy that limit prices or encourage certain prices are able to be made.
@SenateDems @RonWyden The main reason you DON'T like the tax cuts is because it "cuts" into your agenda of federal aid that can be fixed by giving people the money to receive better services from private companies. Why give people federal health care when you can give them more to get REAL healthcare
@SenateDems @RonWyden and by that same logic, tell me EXACTLY how it is a scam? It is bringing more businesses back because it is more desirable to be here, it allows smaller companies to flourish easier, AND it puts more money into people's pockets...
@SenateDems @RonWyden Okay fine, sure they are doing that but it's not like the businesses have obligations to give their employees multi-dollar raises. But tell me, are people NOT getting raises? Albeit with varying results, but can you HONESTLY tell me people aren't?

@COYOTEPETERSON are you ever going to do the Warrior Wasp? I hear it is more painful than the bullet ant but the venom has a lower duration.

@TreborgYT I am assuming one species of spider matches that description. Huntsman, granted that is all dependent on where you live.
Such is life. https://t.co/Tcwcc7jhei
@Grizz1yBerry @KingRajaGames Nah fam, I am on twitter till 12 in the morning. 9:30 aint shit.
I will say this, I am loving the Vlogs and rants but, it IS getting a little excessive, maybe put out some more TF2? https://t.co/USqmIuOJpz
@RobertSDeleo I have never been stung either, even though one got thrown into my kayak when I used to do that, but I have been bit by a fish
#SaveMarkiplier actually worked! Mark is saved. https://t.co/Nlvn0oYp74
@RobertSDeleo I almost caught a sting ray at one point, I was unlucky enough to be using an old rod and it snapped it in half!

@TeemoTheScienti @KingRajaGames I am a main soldier/demo/medic, if anything, I would be targeted by said pyros and I manage to outplay them.
@TeemoTheScienti @KingRajaGames I am not saying you are wrong, just from my 2000 hours, I have had hardly any issue after the deg nerf
@diegodamohill @KingRajaGames that is why you go ambassador spy, or you go even further into dicketry and go diamond back, like me!
@diegodamohill @KingRajaGames That is true about the pompson but the nerfs done to it make it a pale comparison to what it was.
@TeemoTheScienti @KingRajaGames Idk man... I have never had any problems with Reserve shooter even against good pyros in casual who use it.
@KingRajaGames Also, the Backburner paired with the flare gun and the axtinguisher I have seen to also be strong AF
@KingRajaGames Actually, quite frankly, if you know how to use the combo the Flame Thrower and the Flare gun are really powerful. Need aim!
@KawaiiKrusaders @KingRajaGames too nerfed to be good anymore... Sad to say anyway. I can kill better with the Flame Thrower and flare gun.
@diegodamohill @KingRajaGames pompson go nerfed, brass beast and natasha got nerfed, and the RS is out shined by the shotty, RB is just bad.
@TeemoTheScienti @KingRajaGames The reserve shooter is out shined by the shotgun, so I wouldn't think so to be honest.
@KingRajaGames but if I am going to be honest, the most broken weapon in Team Fortress 2 right now is the... Sydney Sleeper? Due to the buff
@KingRajaGames it's totally the cozy camper

@KingRajaGames you can never be too hard on something that doesn't hear you.
RT @KingRajaGames: Lmao I didn't even get the right @LeafyIsHere, gg.
@Zach_Dyer even so,
@LordMinion777 but sleep is for the weak
@Zach_Dyer of course it is brutal, what? You think valve will make it easy?
RT @RobertSDeleo: And if Suicide Squad sucks I'm just gonna go back to pirating movies or watching Netflix
@KingRajaGames valve never fixes anything raja! Get your mind out of the impossibilities. Not even Shia can make those dreams come true
@KingRajaGames ooh, is that a new brand? Better buy it while it's hot for 4.20 with 0% tax! Guaranteed to bring you a cleaner mouth!
@Zach_Dyer ranked is a bitch huh? That is why I gave up on it other than a 6s team I am going into
@x32oz @KingRajaGames valve actually fixed something for once? What is this magic?
RT @x32oz: @KingRajaGames I like how valve no less then an hour after you posted you last vid just patched that bug in the game... Lol.
