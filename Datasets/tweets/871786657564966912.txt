Judge Kavanaugh is environmentally conscious and economical. Enjoy this thread for some quick facts about some of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs environmental cases. #SCOTUS #ACC 	üëáüëáüëá https://t.co/ECQAppUQSe
Brett Kavanaugh is a Judge of reason, one that is economically conscious, and one that looks at environmental and energy policy with the lens of what is within reason. Throughout his career, he has managed to strike a balance between enterprise and the environment. #SCOTUS
In National Mining Association v. McCarthy, Kavanaugh protected the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, saying that these acts ‚Äústruck a balance between the need for coal on the one hand and the desire to mitigate surface coal mining‚Äôs environmental effects on the other."
Regarding Obama‚Äôs Clean Power Plan, he stated ‚ÄúThe earth is warming. Humans are contributing. I understand the international impact and the problem of the commons‚Ä¶ If Congress does this, they can account for the people who lose their jobs. If we do this, we can‚Äôt.‚Äù
Kavanaugh understands climate risks, but is pragmatic when it comes to solutions. #SCOTUS
In 2012, Kavanaugh deemed the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule too extensive and burdensome on manufacturers &amp; energy producers. In a statement by Kavanaugh on the rule, he said, ‚ÄúEPA‚Äôs uniform cost thresholds have required states to reduce pollutants beyond the point necessary‚Äù
While the nation is trying to get to know Judge Kavanaugh better, we thought we would highlight some of his environmental cases #SCOTUS #ACC

An important thread about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and it‚Äôs positive impact on the energy sector. 	üëáüëáüëá https://t.co/JyvSDB17G2
More technologies, better technologies, more efficient energy usage, investment in facilities, work force expansion, and expedited research are some of many possibilities that can come from newly available capital. 		Happy 6 month HR1, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act https://t.co/EzqU4utNfb
Another great feature of the bill is the 100% write-off feature for energy companies. 		The ability to write off new equipment expenses will provide more capital for energy companies to invest in their practices.
The main reason this legislation is so impactful compared to other proposals is the lower tax rates for corporate entities. 		Lower corporate tax rates = companies have more capital to invest in renewable energy.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has helped bring our energy portfolio to the next level and will help accelerate innovation across the energy sector.		America‚Äôs energy portfolio is shifting in a positive way. It is estimated that energy accounts for $200 billion of the US economy.
Six months ago, Congress passed H.R. 1, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 		Since, unemployment has fallen to 3.8%, the lowest it's been since April of 2000.		The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is good for our energy portfolio, good for the economy, and good for renewable sources of energy.

If this rollback would include necessary protections, all while giving the land back to private owners, we would have a completely different outlook!
The federal government has failed to maintain public lands for far too long. Reducing their influence is part of the equation, but it has to be done right. Incentives for private owners to maintain lands and educating them on the benefits of conservation is important too.
@realDonaldTrump In essence, we believe private ownership can do far more than the federal government can, but there have to be necessary protections to the land. These include incentives to conserve and putting conservation as the #1 priority. The rollback, in its current form, does not do that.

@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie @EPA Private conservation in the public interest is the core of how private working lands are vital to conservation -Reed Watson of @PERCtweets
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie With @AmericanPrairie it all comes down to a willing buyer and a willing seller to promote land and species conservation
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie @EPA Property rights allow wildlife to become an income generating asset. We need to continue to make wildlife a ranch asset and not a liability.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie @EPA ‚ÄúIf you never come out there and meet [the ranchers] you‚Äôll never get it‚Äù Government agency staff need to experience the land first hand.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie @EPA Incentives offer #ranchers flexibility needed to better steward the land. 		We need to move away from the ‚Äúuse it or lose it‚Äù mentality.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie @EPA The @PERCtweets mantra is that ‚Äúyou‚Äôve gotta get the incentives right‚Äù		We couldn‚Äôt agree more ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/G8krYT8MAk

@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie There needs to be enough forage for both wildlife &amp; cattle. Policy makers need more knowledge when it comes to working lands &amp; conservation.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie Stewardship is vital to managing the nutrition needs for a herd vs wildlife. The way forward is focused on community approaches to ranchers
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie Ranchers are stewards‚Äîtheir wealth is in the soil. Protecting private lands and caring for the land is vital to their long-term livelihood.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie Community based conservation levels relationships and trust to promote what‚Äôs best for the community and the soil when it comes to grazing.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn @AmericanPrairie As a public-private partnership @AmericanPrairie works directly with ranchers to promote wildlife habitat &amp; encourage private conservation.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working w/ @AmericanPrairie to set up game cameras to track wildlife‚Äù 		Wildlife is returning; ranchers believe in market incentives.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn Wildlife friendly fencing is not only good for native species but also helps landowners limit their labor and rebuilding costs each year.
@PERCtweets @nobleresinst @sandcountyfdn ‚ÄúPrivate landowners are collaborating with one another and state based government agencies to preserve and recreate habitant for big game‚Äù

@WAPolicyGreen @TPUSA The next generation of smartphone environmentalism is connecting people to the free market resources they need
@WAPolicyGreen @TPUSA Unlike government, the free market has driven change forward. 		In-home energy monitors empower individuals to make smart energy choices https://t.co/ewID054IAy
@WAPolicyGreen @TPUSA Why is this true?		Because the free market uses the *unique knowledge that only you have* to make decisions that empower change.
@WAPolicyGreen Free markets ‚Äúdo more with less‚Äù than any other system in the world.		The same is true for energy and conservation!		 #BigGovSucks @TPUSA
