@EvolvingWar @TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard I think that's a non-sequitur. A better metaphor might be denying a troop body armor because "we go to war with the Army we have." There are times when a leader needs to take steps to protect their people from themselves (or others).

@TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard Maybe we can get it from the privatized housing contractors? Seriously, though, that much is manageable under a new system if we really want to find a better way to provide a parachute for our people. It's still a lot less by far than what would be paid.
@TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard Not to be contrarian (see what I did there, too?), but my point was that the old system was fire and forget. No leader involvement required. Now, we need sound policy and leaders who stay engaged to ensure that financial literacy is built.
@TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard I think we can do better. I know we can, actually. My current system is mandatory and matched to 8.5%, and a guy like me who spends his discretionary income on Lego and comic books is protected by a phalanx of financial geniuses.
@kjmcinnis1 @thirdeyecomics Never look in my home office. It's essentially a shrine to the Marvel Universe. Hell, I even include an MCU case study in my strategy course.
@TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard And, finally, we might want to look at what can be done to bring it closer to the existing system in terms of being able to draw on it. To get there, I think we really need to look at what it would take to get there from here. A good design exercise, I think. (4/4)
@TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard Another piece we need to explore deeper is how we intend to build financial literacy. Anyone who's been in uniform for more that a few days knows that eventually this will fall on the shoulders of someone who just does it because it's an extra duty. We don't want that. (3/4)
@TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard While it's not the "government's" job to protect people from themselves, it is where leadership should step in. We all want this to work, so what do we do as leaders to help make that possible? Under the old system, we didn't have to worry about that. It just happened. (2/4)
@TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard With all due respect (see what I did there?), I think we needed to start at 5% matching and make it mandatory. The basic assumption should be that Joe will go out and buy a mustang at 32% interest and won't be able to match funds unless he has to. So you make it mandatory. (1/4)

@liampclancy1 But, do you like McDonald's cheese fries? I mean, let's get to the important stuff here.
@EINS_Institute As Ike Skelton once told me, it's relatively easy for the Navy to communicate in terms of ships and fleets. The AF can come close to that, but the concept of a brigade or a battalion is not concrete to MOCs.
@kjmcinnis1 @thirdeyecomics Don't tell me you're a comic book nerd? I say this of course, with a copy of "The Amazing Nightcrawler" next to me.
@GoForThree @NYTimesAtWar And... roger. I cringe every time I read a headline like that. I don't blame the writer, though. I suspect this is more of an editorial thing, and it sucks.
@WJCork We gotta stop leading with the bona fides and get to the point.
@Combat_Wounded @LorenRaeDeJ Exactly. Nailed it.
@TheCompanyLDR @SpencerGuard I'd argue that you're both right. The current system wasn't sustainable and we can do better than this system. The assumptions underpinning BRS are flawed at best, ignorantly optimistic at worst. We need a system that protects us from our own financial illiteracy.
@the_sailor_dog Washington is and always has been a Navy town. And the Navy knows that and chooses its communicators better than the other services. By a long shot.
An interesting take on how the services communicate to elected leaders. No one is as good as the Navy, and the AF probably comes in a distant second. After that, it's table scraps. https://t.co/vjDgdtyZ9p

@timmathews I once spent three hours in a room with a group of O-6s trying to define "asymmetric." After 73 games of Solitaire on my phone, I suggested we just look it up in the dictionary. They were not amused. "One does not simply look in the dictionary..."

@UncleRickee @edhollett It's also where people dump their books before PCSing. It's like actually finding something in Al Capone's vault.

As a BCT SPO in the early days of OIF, I committed all of my estimates to a Palm Pilot that never left my side. I maintained them as running estimates, updating them as the situation evolved. When we hit Baghdad, it was split-based ops time. (1/3)

@PatchBrettell No, he didn't. Just typed faster than my mind could keep up.

@CynicsRCool There are ways to "finish this war" that don't necessarily involve "following good money with bad." Or we can just walk away and hand the keys to the Taliban. It's a choice, not a fallacy.

@esnjay @ndkirschmann @MeatballNonner Because it's a benefit, every servicemember is entitled to it in some form. That "free housing" thing? It ain't free. Everybody pays for it somehow. (2/2)
@esnjay @ndkirschmann @MeatballNonner In reality, it should be part of the pay rather than a benefit. The fact that it's a benefit allows Congress to artificially "deflate" compensation and, therefore, retirement pay. (1/2)

@ohickeyj That speaks volumes. I think we're still attracting talent, but how you define it is everything. And how you identify the top and bottom 15% you're going to manage closely... that's going to end up leaving the remaining 70% on their own.

@TCtheTerrible I heard that a few times over the years.
@rich_outlaw The CINC is the CINC. There is no "true" to it. It has nothing to do with military service. Maybe it should, but it doesn't.
@Tailgate4Troops @pptsapper Task and purpose go hand-in-glove. That's fundamental. So do objective and intent. Basic framework stuff.
@brent_maz I have it. A lot of fun to build and comes with both the LEM and the command module. Just don't pack it with firecrackers and pretend it's one of the early unmanned test flights. It's fun, but you'll ruin the Lego.
@hoyawolf Always. It's a fundamental discussion that escapes most in the beltway. "Okay, so what do you really mean when you say 'defeat'?"
@TCtheTerrible I know. I suck.
@NicholasHeurich It isn't compensated for shit, but their interpretation of their own standards is problematic. My back is AFU and it's documented over the course of years: when I appealed the 0% (it should have been 10%), I was denied... and it took 18 months.

@DeliriousDrew84 @esnjay Except for the guy who didn't understand why whistling at women was toxic. And I'm not sure anyone can reach that guy. (2/2)
@DeliriousDrew84 @esnjay Not so much. There were a couple of people who got stupid and a couple more that protested the execution of the campaign more than the theme. But, overall, when you put it in blunt terms -- "don't be an asshole" -- most people get it. (1/2)
@GeoffreyDeWeese I, for one, voted for the "Don't be a dick!" campaign. That's pretty direct and will reach all men.
@arbitrarymike Besides that it's a screwed up situation? Every time I ever posted that we needed to get out of the business of CRs, this kind of mess was looming in the background. Trump may have pushed the button, but the button has been there for a decade. Lose the button, Congress.

@BayernKaiser I think if someone on his staff was handing out 2020 hats to be signed, then there would be an issue, but not one you could or should pin on those in attendance. My two cents.
@Salems_Bot I remember people in uniform doing similar stuff during and after the 2008 campaign with posters -- getting them signed was a big deal to some. But O didn't wave those things around, so it wasn't as much of a symbol in a political sense.

@JWVizzard @RadioFreeTom We were in the midst of that transition when I was in high school. I remember writing a program for a Death Star attack simulator in Basic on a TRS-80. It sucked, but was a lot of fun to write.

@billmcmichael @USNavy When I left Iraq the last time, my officers gave me a framed and embroidered US flag... it was a thing of beauty. Across the bottom it reads, "Don't make me donkey punch you." I hung it in my office and someone filed an IG complaint.
@PatDonahoeArmy Well, we touched on one (working backwards this morning) already, but "Who Moved my Cheese" was on that list. But, to be fair, even bad reading was better than the guy who refused to support any form of professional development.

@canisimpetum @dianecb The successful application of violence and destruction tends to work best when applied with a little innovation and creativity to establish an asymmetric advantage over your opponent. My two cents.
