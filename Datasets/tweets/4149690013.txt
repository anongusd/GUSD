I'm glad to know that when Democrats take back the presidency we don't have to pretend to care about conservative media. Call them out. Call them what they are: lying rats. Escort them out of the building. Good riddance.

Democrats need to hold a meeting with leaders of the party. Decide on a message. Decide on a game plan. Issue this warning: any elected Democrat who criticizes other Democrats or equates our party with the GOP will lose funding &amp; endorsements from Democratic leaders.

No body is more controlled by the American government than the bodies of Native Americans. No other race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation is told where to live, how to act, how to sign paperwork, etc. just to be recognized as a member of their own community.
Agreed. Now can we agree that stripping healthcare and sovereignty away from native people would essentially limit control over their bodies &amp; fundamental rights to self determination?! https://t.co/fDPG0mlRuS
The Trump administration is already eyeing the reclassification of Native people's as a race instead of sovereign nations. That would basically strip access to healthcare away from Native Americans. Could be headed to the Supreme Court very soon.
I'm not saying that to diminish the importance of Roe vs Wade. It's more to draw attention to the entire communities &amp; cultures that are in danger of being devastated while no one is looking.
When Kennedy announced his retirement all attention went to roe vs wade. I was worried about affirmative action &amp; voting rights. Now that Trump announced his nominee, it's all about roe vs wade, again. Little attention is being paid to other major issues like tribal sovereignty.
The President of the United States of America is using his office to hurt Americans. That really should be enough for impeachment.

As much as our society tells women to be quiet about sexual assault, it's even worse for men. Some people don't believe that men can be sexually assaulted. Others believe it shows a lack of masculinity. There's an entire stigma. Those PEOPLE need your support, not your rhetoric.
I support #metoo but people need to understand that men are victims of sexual abuse as well. When you constantly and consistently label all men as predators, you not only disenfranchise a lot of potential supporters, but you also overlook a lot of victims.

We cannot change the past. We can only remember it and learn from it. Learning from the Holocaust and using that experience to create a better world is how we honor the dead, the survivors, and all those who were collaterally impacted like second &amp; third generation survivors.
For folks born 30, 40, 50 years after the fact &amp; in completely different times all this seems abstract &amp; a bit alarmist to be comparing our leaders to Hitler. But survivors WANT us to examine our reality vs what happened. It's the only way to prevent it from ever happening again.
You don't need a historian to see the similarities between Trump's America and Nazi Germany. You just need to listen to the survivor testimonies from the Shoah Foundation.
This tells me that Republicans aren't really concerned with how immigrants might vote. A smart &amp; reasonable Republican could easily sway a large number of minority voters. But the sheer hatred outweighs all else.
The reason I don't believe this to be the case is studies show minority communities are more conservative &amp; religious than their white counterparts. However they feel forced into voting Democratic by a party, which despite their similarities, is hostile to their very existence. https://t.co/ecOGEGKkxk

@Mariyah9458 @InSpiteOfTrump Are you saying Hamas didn't make those threats? Because it's on video. I'm sure I could even find it in writing. It's not like they've been keeping it a secret. Antisemitism is rife throughout the Arab world.
@Mariyah9458 @InSpiteOfTrump It's not ok to cage and kill people. It is ok for Israel to defend itself from supporters of a terrorist regime that threatens genocide &amp; advocates ripping the hearts out of Jews.
So yes, I am devastated by the humanitarian crisis. But I cannot waver on my support for Israel to defend itself. The world has shown too many times that it cannot be trusted to respect, protect &amp; defend Jewish lives.
That's also why Israel must and will protect itself from supporters of an internationally recognized terrorist organization. Historically speaking, when someone threatens to kill Jews, Jews usually end up dead.
That is why Israel is so important. Not because of religion. Not because of Trump. Because it provides safety, opportunity &amp; security for people that have been persecuted and discriminated against in almost every part of the world. And that's just in recent history.
Between 1948-1972 810,000 Jews were forced out of Arab countries. The vast majority ended up in Israel. Most arrived penniless after having everything taken away but the clothes on their backs. They found a home in Israel. They found safety in Israel.
Historically the world has shown its disregard for Jewish lives at every turn. From allowing 40% of the world's Jewish population to be murdered in the Shoah to forcing hundreds of thousands of Jews to flee Arab states after their homes &amp; possessions were confiscated.

They then carry that confidence into their everyday lives and it gives them the courage to try new things or speak out. Cheerleading is all about empowering girls. That's why I'm so incredibly proud to be part of the cheer world.
Through spring I will judge one or two high school and middle school cheerleading tryouts a week. I see girls walk in without confidence and walk out with their heads held high after sticking a landing or exceeding their own expectations.

I spent 12 years of my life as a competitive gymnast. 7 years as a competitive cheerleader. 4 years as a collegiate cheerleader. I have enough experience to confidently say that cheerleading is not sexist. Period. The actions of the NFL in no way reflects the sport. https://t.co/iybmIDYM4F
Agreed. Cheerleaders should be compensated fairly. That's entirely different than arguing that cheerleading itself is sexist. It's not. Cheerleading provides more athletic scholarships to women than any other sport in America. https://t.co/nqVCxtcdOZ
That doesn't make the sport of cheerleading sexist. Cheerleading teaches young girls leadership, teamwork, and to support other women. It's empowering. And the majority of cheerleaders are all star which means they don't actually cheer for a team but compete in their own right. https://t.co/Bl5VUeJo0P
Anyone can lift weights &amp; become a brick wall. It's science. Not everyone can train their body to contort. Not everyone can build the stamina to endure a 3 minute nonstop routine where every movement, facial expression &amp; breathe is painstakingly choreographed. That takes talent.
What's sexist is not recognizing the accomplishments &amp; unbelievable abilities of cheerleaders because of their outfits or because the sport is dominated by women. One of the only sports to be dominated by women.
Cheerleading is not sexist. 	Cheerleading is an incredibly demanding sport that doesn't get the respect it deserves. Cheerleaders put their bodies on line and perform with broken noses, torn ligaments, and other serious injuries to become the best athletes in their sport. https://t.co/0owD3VsAjq

@Izzy_Chubb Would they even recognize Israels right to exist? I doubt it. Right now Israel is an oasis for liberal ideals in the Middle &amp; near east. People have more rights in Israel than anywhere else in the region, including Palestine. My guess is all that would be stripped away.
@Izzy_Chubb Here's a game I like to play: 	What if Israel completely capitulated to Palestine? What if Palestinians received everything they want &amp; nothing less. Do you think Palestinians would have more rights? Would the terrorists controlling Palestine allow Israeli Jews to live in peace?
@Izzy_Chubb Israel has a duty to protect its citizens first. To protect their interests first. Just like all independent countries. America does it. Canada does it. China does it. Palestine does it. Why can't Israel?
@Izzy_Chubb They're not unarmed. They're poisoning the air with mountains of burning tires, hurling rocks, tossing molotov cocktails, abusing animals, and that's ignoring the fact that Palestine has launched thousands of rocket &amp; mortar attacks on Israel.

@AKCHAOS @GudlaugHawkinso When someone accuses Al Franken of child molestation we can discuss him alongside Roy Moore. Until then it's inappropriate &amp; unfair.
That being said..there's a man who has been convincingly accused of molesting *multiple* children and shows no remorse.
For the record I'm not defending Al Franken's behavior. He shouldn't be touching people without permission and he apologized for it.
There's a huge difference between what Al Franken did and what Roy Moore did. Conflating the two issues helps no one.

Maybe Trump should thank the congress that refuses to impeach him even though it's evident that he was not elected by anyone in America.
