@madalenamcneil Well, it is the Deseret News... So I can't argue with you there
@madalenamcneil And I don't think this is an issue that requires the LDS Church coming out in support. There have been many LDS lawmakers who have supported it.
@madalenamcneil That's one argument I've heard against it, but mainly from the Eagle Forum, not many lawmakers. I've mostly heard them making false arguments about how it would place some communities in a "special status," but this shows it can happen to anyone based on community characteristics
@madalenamcneil Any amount of hate crimes against any community is too much. And if this small rise in hate crimes against the LDS community is what could finally push the Utah legislature to adopt a stronger hate crimes law, then we should highlight it as much as we can
