"Maybe that's what love is; the little things." -@houstonkraft
"How do we make kindness, compassion, and love our default setting?" 	-@houstonkraft
"What if we took 5 minutes day to intentional choose love?"-@houstonkraft
"As leaders it is your job to love people even though it might be challenging or inconvenient to you."-@houstonkraft
"A commitment to growth is a commitment to pain.  To get better at anything it requires me to do things that challenge me." -@houstonkraft
"Feelings might change, but truth doesn't." -@houstonkraft
"If we only treat love as a feeling, then we will only love people when it is convenient for us."-@houstonkraft
"I think at the end of the day, your job as a human being, is to get better at loving people." -@houstonkraft
"Love has as many definitions as the people in this room." -@houstonkraft
