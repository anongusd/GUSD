Koch: Why should the Feds be responsible for our nuclear waste? (according to federal law, Feds must dispose of waste)
Koch: opposes the amendment
Doll: amendment places economic safeguards for ratepayers on future construction; ensures waste is leaving MN
Doll is offering an amendment to the bill
Sen. Koch - "I am excited to have this debate" (wait, didn't you say on Tuesday we can't talk about it?)
round 2 of nuclear hearings in Senate about to start
Morse - 1994 session findings warn of the unknowns regarding cost, waste of new nuclear
Morse - MEP shows that a majority of Minnesotans weary of more nuclear in MN, especially at the expense of renewables
Steve Morse, mep, now up
Rolf Westgard, geologist - tridium does not leak from plants like VT Yankee (but it has been found)
Doll - what is the worldwide supply of uranium? Melbey - abundant (and US imports over 80% of this - continues dependence on foreign fuel)
Scott Melbye, Cameco, uranium importers now up
Westinghouse - nuclear is enviromentally friendly (really??? what about all the mining and spent fuel waste)
Westinghouse - nuclear opponents using fear, takes exception (just b/c there have been no accidents in 30 yrs, doesn't make it safe)
Reps from Westinghouse now up - build reactor equipment
Carl Crimmins (pipefitters) - new plant could break ground in 3 yrs - wrong, over 20 projects in NRC queue fighting over loan guarantees
Did Franklin just say that he wants to have the opportunity to oppose a future bill?
Prettner Solon to Franklin - in the past you have wanted to protect ratepayers on other issues.
Franklin - we need to be able to discuss; chamber may oppose if plans are expensive
Mike Franklin from Chamber of Commerce
Prettner Solon - how many jobs will be created by repealing the moratorium? Golnik - i don't know
Ben Golnik of Sensible Energy Solutions now up
Dibble - are we decommissioning expiring plants? NEI - many relicensed for 20 yrs
Rummel - won't reprocessing increase our waste? NEI - it will probably be awhile before we know how to proceed
Anderson - FL are paying increased rates before plants built, is this normal? NEI - is not required, state decision, plants are expensive
Cohen - can't really judge the use of nuclear with moratorium in place (wrong, California has moratorium and utilities are looking at nukes)
Marshall Cohen of Nuclear Energy Institute now up
Dibble - what stops utilities from looking at future nuclear? OES - nothing in the 1st amendment
Anderson - no utilities are planning for more plants that far in the future
Anderson/Prettner Solon - do we really need more baseload?
OES - 2034 an important year, current nuclear plants expire, what do we do? (what about renewables, smart grid, DRG, etc..)
Koch - this is to repeal the moratorium, not to build or prefer nuclear, just want talk about it (current law does not forbid this)
Koch now presenting her bill
Sheran - how many years is Xcel on the hook for waste from decomissioning? PUC - unknown, maybe 60 years?
Vandeveer - aren't we collecting a lot of money for Yucca and doing nothing?
Doll - are waste mothballed sites secure? PUC - those still in operation (what about the others?)
Boyd from PUC now speaking - discussing national waste storage - speaks about Yucca, but not the 8 sites selected in MN as secondary sites
Jungbauer - how long does licensing process take? NRC - not sure (REALLY?)
Doll - can building process be stopped? NRC - not sure
Doll - How many licenses will be approved in next 2 yrs? NRC - 18 applications in, but unknown when these will be granted
Senjem - Is Yucca progressing? NRC - application may be withdrawn .. no waste to Yucca
Olseen to NRC - concerned about personal relationships with NRC inspectors and plant operators
