@tiniebeany It is the most truthful that I’ve seen him look.
@realDonaldTrump This is all coming full circle and is about to overtake you. All the lies you’ve told, the hate, the greed and misdeeds are coming back around. They will envelop you.
@realDonaldTrump You’ve obstructed justice at least 100 times on Twitter and TV alone. If you’re going to commit crimes maybe not doing them publicly would be a smarter strategy moving forward. Just a thought
Jussie Smolett told a lie that caused a National sensation 		Paul and Mike took sides and they told lies that altered the course of a Nation 		We debate their fate and chose opposing sides forgetting that their lies are our salvation
Anyone else watch ABC News? When David Muir said “even if T**** pardons him” with ‘Trump’ being censored. Anyone else hear this?
@BernieSanders Health care is a better issue for us, IMHO
@RepMarkMeadows Well, we know which side of law and order and right and wrong you are. Can’t wait to see what you get indicted for.
@realDonaldTrump I would love to hear you try to explain the subtle differences between the two ideologies while you fielded thoughtful questions.
Two months in with the plug-in hybrid and we’ve saved ~$550 on fuel. Going green was one of the best things we’ve ever done. https://t.co/WAGGqXreNA
@RepMarkMeadows Yeah man, no collusion. Just a secret meeting to talk about using a foreign adversary to gain damaging information illegally and then lying about it to the American people and our institutions charged with investigating the crime. What is your definition of collusion?
@ChuckGrassley 60 minutes was pretty good too
@realDonaldTrump You are your own worst enemy.
Hillary and I have been talking and we both feel like not nearly enough attention was paid to Ivanka’s emails.
If walls are effective, 100% then can someone please break down the effectiveness, by percentage, of planes, ladders, helicopters, tunnels and boats?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Calling them names should help.
@AngelaBelcamino Humility
@JabajoJoan @adishsoup @jlhulsman But they know that the lies will lose to the test of time. They aren’t dumb (for the most part) so they have to be corrupt. This scares me because if they didn’t have a way forward WITH Trump they would have already bailed. What possible way/s forward is the question
In an absolute twist of irony, Ice Cube put out the single “arrest the president” after having made his career off of the single “f the police”		I can’t get around this.
@Ironhorse76 Ok, but I didn’t read the first tweet https://t.co/MEgQ5p26ar
@bubbagump324 The rich and especially the ultra rich have systematically changed the rules to favor themselves. If it doesn’t change back, we the people will be crushed under the Ponzi scheme pyramid that we’ve allowed ourselves to become
@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris What if she did? How would that compare to someone who used influence from a foreign adversary to gain the Presidency?
@MKGenest Yes, it collectively hurts us tremendously to allow ignorance to proliferate unchecked by our failing system of education. We will eventually fail if we don’t address this
@peterdaou It’s just a fancy way of saying “I straddle the fence and do so unapologetically. Both parties will dislike some of my alliances which are all strategically aligned with whatever position will help me personally, the most”.
@MissNyetTrump His very careful word choice outside of the courtroom was a dead giveaway. He’ll stall for as long as he can but there is a zero percent chance that he bites the bullet for Trump. When Mueller starts to really lean on him, he’ll fold like a lawn chair.
@tiniebeany If we can share flight plans for the House Speaker then we can share other information as well
@joshtpm Hewitt’s a half-wit
@siano2020 No, she already lost a head-to-head with the Don of Con. We need a new face. One without the baggage created by 25+ years of nonstop propaganda/brainwashing by the GOP
Just another friendly reminder that Russia has long range bombers parked in Venezuela. It felt like a bigger deal than anyone made of it at the time and it feels like an even bigger concern now that the country is moving closer to a possible revolution.
@mitchellvii If he’s so smart, why are key members of his inner circle indicted, jailed or waiting for the inevitable? If he is so much smarter than everyone else then he should be able to keep his campaign promises and friends and colleagues out of prison, IMHO
@WalshFreedom Then when are we going to move into teepees?
@Ironhorse76 🍄👇🏼🔥🌎👁
@jax_persists Letting you know how guilty he is. His word choice was interesting too.
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer This is a terrible position to put yourself in.
@DeniseW48110148 @adamcbest I read “on it” I figured auto correct
@DavidJollyFL @ChasingOzPhotog Maybe but this is Teflon Don we’re talking about
@Alyssa_Milano The short answer is that it will be legal if the courts allow it. The position that not having a wall on our border constitutes an emergency is ridiculous but the level of integrity of our courts will be the deciding factor.
@WakingLifeDream @ToddDomke That dude needs a hug
Ann Coulter is going to be on Bill Maher tonight. That should be fairly entertaining
@peterdaou They think in the same prose that the GOP used when they brainwashed them.
@adamcbest @DeniseW48110148 The look on his face speaks volumes
I keep hearing that, “it was all for nothing...”		I disagree, many people lost bigly during this shut down. “Nothing” would be an improvement over the “something” that these people have been put through.
@DadHominem Yes, somehow it is even worse now than when it was legal and an entire industry existed to support it.
How is Donald going to explain this to Ann Coulter?
@RepMarkMeadows I’ll bet that anyone contemplating running against you appreciates your assertion of loyalty to the demagogue
The WH releases an official statement in regards to Roger Stone’s arrest -		“Um, we don’t know that guy” SHS		“This arrest doesn’t mean anything because DT is still paying me” Rudy the Collusion Diffuser		“Please remove your things from my office” Nancy Pelosi
@renowels @maydaymindy9 And Hatch and Kennedy
@emrazz Mainly, how the terms themselves are viewed
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz We agree on this too. I am all for thorough screening
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz People who ask for asylum are legal. Building a wall to prevent them from asking is inherently wrong. I support some barriers, more funding for entry points and better equipment at our borders. I don’t support building barriers so that we can ignore humanitarian concerns
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz And we can both agree that that is wrong. In the end these are kids. I wasn’t terribly bright at 16 either but not in my wildest dreams would I have acted out like some in the group were doing. No one person or party is completely to blame or blameless IMO.
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz Not every single kid there was wrong. Not every kid was engaged in behavior that was inappropriate and there were plenty of other people behaving poorly as well.
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz That would be the Native Americans after the kids started shouting “build that wall” which is an appropriate response considering the fact that this land was stolen from them to begin with. If you don’t believe in immigration then I guess we all need to leave.
@minenotyours69 @realDonaldTrump What should she have done? Should she have boarded a plane and forced them to leave?
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz That chop is a little bit insensitive at a Braves game but it’s downright stupid to do it while face to face with a Native American.
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz They’re a much easier group to control. If I were charged with diffusing the situation before it escalated, they would be the group I would target as well.
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz I watched the whole thing &amp; other videos from other perspectives. IMO this started when the teens were harassing young women but I’ll be the first to admit that none of us knows exactly what happened. Except that those kids were being disrespectful by mocking the Native Americans
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz Yup, they were wrong too.
@minenotyours69 @realDonaldTrump She told them to leave and they didn’t. How is that her fault? Congress absolved her of any wrong-doing. Led, by the way, by a bunch of Republicans. So what have you found after the fact that moves criminal liability towards her?
@Sgroberts121657 @tedcruz Please explain, I’d love to hear what areas you disagree with. My stance is anti overtly racist behavior. What is yours?
Thanks to Donald Trump the number of people blindly following the GOP is being slowly reduced. On that front he is doing a good job. On virtually every other he is a colossal failure
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi It’s time we focus on getting idiots and greedy traitors out of office. The SOTU is weak because we left you unattended while you lined your pockets and pretended to run the country for the people. We are paying attention now and it doesn’t look good for the GOP
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump The other 3 of the 10 have only proven that we desperately need to increase funding for our system of education
@minenotyours69 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, really. There were 10 separate inquiries into Ben Ghazi and they all failed to produce anything actionable. Six of those investigations were led by Republicans and those too failed to produce anything. It didn’t stop idiots from using it as their war cry though
@minenotyours69 @realDonaldTrump Ok, school me. I’m dying to know what specifically Hillary Clinton did wrong in regards to Ben Ghazi. Go ahead with your most cogent argument, I’ll wait
@minenotyours69 @realDonaldTrump Well, you obviously don’t know anything about Ben Ghazi
@realDonaldTrump He’s YOUR lawyer idiot. How many indictments is Grandma Pantsuits battling?
@kechjo They don’t need to strike. They should just stop going to work citing the fact that they can no longer pay for gas, food, child care etc.
@thedailybeast @Pseudosaurus Someone should inform this genius that banks don’t loan money to people who are completely broke and who can’t show that they can pay the loan back. After they calmly explain this him maybe slapping the slobber out of his mouth will bring the point home. Just a thought
@marcorubio Thoughts and prayers, cool bro those seem to be working really well. We could move forward with legislation that lessens the frequency of these events but we are still stuck doing nothing because of people like you.
@veterans_i My two pre teen children corrected an adult who said something more than mildly insensitive. That is the way forward IMO. I have never been prouder of my children than I was in that moment.
@realDonaldTrump I look forward to the day when a competent leader delivers the SOTU address and you are just an ugly stain on our history
@crampell @WenWillRun I wonder what it’s like to have so much money that the reality that governs the world no longer applies to you
@Lawrence @USNavyMomPA If you’re waiting on Mitch Mcconnell to do the right thing you will eventually die disappointed
@Alyssa_Milano @jrcinsideout Calling it a Klansman’s hood is a bridge too far for me but it’s at least as bad as flying a Confederate flag. Flying that flag doesn’t automatically make you a racist but pretty much everyone that is flying one is
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi You’re becoming less and less likable every day. You could stand firm on the right side of history but sadly you simply lack the courage to do what is right.
@tedcruz They didn’t look like victims when they were Tomahawk chopping, while mocking the chants and dances. In that moment they look like children in dire need of direction. People like you come along trying to spin it which works to justify their actions. Ppl like you are the problem
@tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Spin it all you like, you’ll never get a majority to back Trump’s play. Something’s about to give and people are going to start turning on you and the rest of the GOP. Both sides know it. Your move....
@tedlieu Cohen is stalling because wherever this is going is about to go down. On Sunday I said that this shut down would boil over within 10 days and I’m sticking to that. We’ve reached the threshold where it’s about to get weird, just my opinion
@MKGenest I think most of what he is doing has been thought out more carefully than any of us wants to believe. The part that has me worried is the GOP standing behind him. It’s as obvious to them as it it to us that he’s dirty but they just don’t care.
@AnnCoulter No court in their right mind would call this a national emergency. Unless we’re talking about the idiot in the WH. That might constitute an emergency but that’s because he’s guilty, cornered and desperate.
@KassandraSeven When did we the people become an afterthought?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump History will remember those that did nothing. It will remember you and your lack of action, lack of leadership, lack of morality, lack of compassion, lack of empathy, lack of courage and lack of patriotism.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So are checks and balances. Where did those go?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You’re setting new lows every day. You Lindsey, are responsible for your part in this. If it weren’t for people like you facilitating the traitor in chief’s actions, he wouldn’t still be getting away with them. No one is going to forget your role &amp; lack of action.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Nah, that low was already set by the GOP holding government employees hostage in an attempt to facilitate keeping an idiotic lie of a campaign promise to a group of people who are afraid of brown people.
The President just accused Nancy Pelosi of being a ‘radical’. I think she’s been in Congress since it started. I believe if she was some kind of radical, someone would have noticed before right now. I wonder how many of Nancy’s friends are under indictment?
@senatemajldr Not before you release the hostages. It’s a DOD thing Mitch, you know the rules. If you would just do your job we wouldn’t be in this situation.
@realDonaldTrump Build a fence at your own expense
@OMGno2trump We shouldn’t forget how he handled Khashoggi’s murder and attempted cover-up
@EndDeportations The fact that he was marginally right on how stupid we all collectively are
@tiniebeany He wants this. As soon as someone goes over the edge and commits an act of violence he will have some fuel to push for martial law which is the only way forward that will keep him out of jail. He will keep pushing until the fabric that binds is has been unraveled, just my opinion
@arkivx @AnnCoulter I watched the video and the videos that led up to it. If you think that those kids weren’t there to cause conflict then please explain how “it’s not rape if you enjoy it” or how mocking Native Americans with a Tomahawk chop and chanting with them is ok.
@MKGenest Where her parents are from isn’t part of the equation. How are people this stupid? We need more money devoted to education
@AnnCoulter Alex Jones is an idiot that does nothing but stir up hate. The kids were there to stir up hate. I love how you guys start the fight and then try to point in every other direction. The hateful side is yours. The side that is afraid of everything. You’re just a bunch of cowards
@JohnCornyn It’s your shut down &amp; it’s an absolute abuse of power, not how you’re supposed to act, &amp; not how our government is supposed to run. You are holding paychecks hostage so your idiotic boss can fulfill an idiotic campaign promise. You and the rest of the GOP will answer in 2020
@Wendy_Tobin @coleyworld It doesn’t fill the gap. It only widens the chasm
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How many people in Hillary’s camp are currently under indictment? Now compare that number to the number from your camp. The one with the highest number is the one everyone knows is crooked.
@realDonaldTrump Watched the whole thing. Those kids were there looking for a conflict &amp; they found what they were looking for. It doesn’t surprise any of us that you would support them. You’re a bully who supports fellow bullies. At least the ones that proudly display your symbol of obedience
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends When are you going to address the humanitarian crisis in Flint Michigan or the crisis affecting the 800k government employees or the humanitarian concerns that have plagued Puerto Rico since you dropped the ball after the hurricane?
@KamalaHarris You are a terrifying opponent for someone like Trump. I look forward to hearing a debate.
@senatemajldr Do your job. Stop licking the boots of the demagogue and take a vote that will end the shut down. This isn’t how the government is supposed to work. Grow a spine and do the right thing. You might actually feel good about yourself for once.
@JohnCornyn @CBP @DHSgov @rgv3307 Most of them think that they’re being used as leverage and that the wall is not the answer to our immigration issues. Most of them can see this for what it is, a political stunt that will crush you in 2020.
@WhiteHouse Except for our farmers, who are struggling to find markets because of your trade wars.
@thistallawkgirl Someone who values money above morality
@Ironhorse76 Don’t know how you feel about smoking so I’ll bring edibles
@AnnCoulter You voted for a liar, a basic con man and you now have a con man that you look to and hope that the bill of goods he sold you is legitimate. It isn’t. He told you what you wanted to hear with no thought or plan on how to accomplish anything and you bought it.
@Kokomothegreat No one is this stupid. It is using your position, your power and influence to attempt to alter the outcome of an investigation. That is obstruction. If he’d threatened someone that would be obstruction AND extortion.
@TomiLahren @DeniseW48110148 You shouldn’t be calling anyone a moron. You’re a vapid wasteland of fake Christianity hidden in a prose that barely even attempts to provide subterfuge for your rampant greed which is the root of your xenophobia. You’re a marionette for corporate America.
@realDonaldTrump We did notice that the SC didn’t exactly say that the story was untrue just that it wasn’t exactly accurate. There’s a pretty big difference between the two.
@realDonaldTrump What progress? He didn’t do anything when President Obama was in charge and he still hasn’t done anything significant. The only progress that you’ve made is successfully holding 800k ppl hostage to distract attention from your criminal actions and obstruction.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You work for you, or Putin but not us. You’re screwing over all of us and our children. Your name is becoming synonymous with lies and failure. Your children will continue to carry that burden after you have gone down as the worst President in our history.
@JohnCornyn A temporary deal to protect ppl who are being attacked by the person who wants a wall to keep them away, all as an effort to distract ppl from the investigation that will likely prove that the person who you’ve decided is your messiah is a traitor. 🍄👇🏼🔥🌎👁&amp; you’re going w/him
@QuancyClayborne It will be		“I’m awesome. Greatest person at everything ever. I know more about all of this than everyone else combined. Some bad stuff is happening, which is the Democrats fault, not mine. The press is bad and I’m the only one you can believe. I didn’t know about the collusion”
@siano2020 How about - 		Pensive Collusion
Cardi B sounds more reasonable than the POTUS. I feel like I’m in an episode of the Twilight Zone. Every day I say aloud-		Am I hearing this right? Isn’t someone supposed to step in? We still have laws, right? At what point will these sycophants just do the right thing?
@WhoisKingAir @wesindyan Minimalism.
@Kris_Sacrebleu The easy answer is to assume he’s on something (he may well be) but stress combined w/lack of sleep will do the same things. I can’t imagine his life is very peaceful or that he’s sleeping well. He’s pretty much created his own personal hell. He’s slowly getting what he deserves
@VP @marklevinshow We’ll do a better job of demanding better in 2020
@siano2020 My favorites are		1. Kamala Harris 	2. Beto O’Rourke 	3. Elizabeth Warren 	4. Stacy Abrams		I think Joe Biden might have the best chance to win
@realDonaldTrump Nobody but you in the WH is an absolutely worst case scenario. You don’t work for us. The WH might as well have Putin in it. You’re a disgrace. Your only merit at this point will be that your personality traits will be referenced as what to look out for in the future.
@SenKamalaHarris Run for President. 		Please and Thank you
@JimCarrey @LindseyGrahamSC He’s worried about his own transgressions. It’s the only logical explanation. He isn’t this stupid. None of them are.
@DogginTrump I think it’s just dirty money but who knows, it could be a lot worse. Whatever it is, it’s bad enough for him to completely sell us out.
@realDonaldTrump Source please, everything that I’ve read from a reputable source disputes this. While we’re at it, what about preexisting conditions and all of the people who are about to lose their health care?
@bad_takes That’s what dictators do. They sweep aside those pesky checks and balances
@realDonaldTrump The only crisis we have is in the WH. As soon as Mueller’s report is finished, so is that crisis but you already know that and so do we. The only question that remains is how many lives are yet to be destroyed by you and how many more political careers ended.
@realDonaldTrump I’ve been there many times and you’re a liar but nothing new there.
@realDonaldTrump Get real, this shut down is all about trying to distract attention from your crimes and slow the efforts of the Democrats to investigate them. You think this is somehow going to go away but you don’t understand how the real world works. You can’t just bully your way through this.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi You created a stalemate when a compromise had already been reached. It is a desperate attempt to divert attention from the real life crisis that is Donald’s BS ‘Presidency’.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No, it is an attempt to bypass our process of government. It will never make it through the legal system and it should be more than obvious to anyone with a brain. You can’t pout, cross your arms, refuse to accept the will of the majority and then call that a national emergency.
@JohnCornyn All of you clowns should be ‘freaking out’. This is easily solved. Your boss just needs to grow up and you need to realize that you’re a coequal branch of government instead of the POTUS’ lap dogs.
@Kokomothegreat It sounds like he finally hired some smarter lawyers. Too bad he waited until he’d already committed the crimes, lied about them, got caught, changed his story, obstructed justice, and then pissed all over the people leading the investigation and infuriated half of the government
@1pissedPolack No way, he’s at least behind both Don and JR
@treasonstickers He’s neither a Trumper or a patriot. He’s just a smaller fish trying desperately to wriggle off the hook.
@DogginTrump That assumes a level of cognitive ability currently and that has yet to be proven
@JohnCornyn Use it to pay for your idiotic wall and leave we the people out of it.
@Kokomothegreat He said “it will pay for itself every few months” so I say we wait a few months and wait for everything to work itself out.		Problem solved
@Puddintane329 His playbook mirrors Hitler’s in enough ways that it’s hard to believe it isn’t deliberate
I’m a Democrat-		I care about crime, especially the ones being committed by the WH		I care about drugs, particularly the ones that Donald must be on		I care about sex crimes, like the ones committed by the President		I care about gangs,such as the GOP, using strong arm tactics
If Donald cared about crimes, he’d stop committing them
@WhiteHouse Bold faced lies
@ChasingOzPhotog Bottom right
@realDonaldTrump We thought you were a master negotiator. Is running away instead of participating in a civil debate the best that you can do? Would you like to discuss collusion instead? Are the meanies from the media getting you down? Thoughts and prayers 🍄👇🏼🔥🌎👁🕐Mueller’s closing in...
@RepMarkMeadows I expect you to do your job &amp; open the government. I don’t support using people as leverage to accomplish a campaign promise that doesn’t serve the needs of Americans. You are destroying your own party but I applaud your efforts in that regard. 🍄(&amp; the rest of the GOP)👇🏼🔥🌎👁
@DearAuntCrabby @Marie_Em91 @realDonaldTrump @funder @tribelaw Yes, he did, &amp; he’s violated a number of other laws via Twitter &amp; by the use of his platform. He’s openly obstructed the Mueller investigation, attacked our institutions &amp; media, attacked court decisions if they sided against him &amp; sided with our enemies. All right in front of us
@tiniebeany Sun Tzu’s art of war says that when your enemy is making a critical tactical error, it is best to allow them to continue
@LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary I’ll bet it will be. Without a few judges beholden to you, you are all in quite a bit of trouble
@DogginTrump I am suspicious but unsure either way. What I do know for sure is that it is not what Trump and co wanted to hear, especially this publicly
@JuliaDavisNews @bluewatch4 This is why I will be campaigning against him.
@senatemajldr @SenThomTillis You’re losing your base. More and more people are seeing you and your coconspirators for what you really are. You’re nothing more than puppets for corporate America. You serve at the pleasure of the greedy while ignoring the needy.
@realDonaldTrump So now you’re telling 39+ million people that you’re going to cut off aid for the disasters created by climate change? You’re trying to provoke a violent response but you picked the wrong side to try this with. You picked the side that resorts to litigation instead
@WhiteHouse We don’t believe anything you say. Especially those of us who have been paying attention to you.
@WhiteHouse Man, you couldn’t be any less convincing
@JohnCornyn Every day I dislike you a little more. I’m not alone. I used to be a Republican
@siano2020 If a “lie” is any communication with intent to deceive then he will be lying non stop minus the ugly scowl of disdain on his repugnant face. The only communication that will be honest is his look that says “you are beneath me”
@tiniebeany They’re unraveling
@JohnCornyn You own all of this. You’re not convincing anyone of anything other than the fact that you and the rest of the GOP are the worst possible answer to the question of “who should lead us?” 🕐🍄👇🏼🔥 and he’s going to take the rest of you with him.
@greatertxford The last Ford that I bought was the worst vehicle I’ve ever owned. It was also the last Ford I will ever own. It’s bow ties or ram’s horns for me here on out.
@MissNyetTrump I believe Trump is a wannabe Autocrat whereas Pence is just another gutless sycophant who is blinded by ambition. So my vote is that Trump is far more dangerous
@senatemajldr Political spite was when you refused to vote for Pres. Obama’s SC nominee. What the Democrats are doing is standing up to a bully who is trying to manipulate simpletons into following him into a false reality. You own all of this and it’s going to hurt you tremendously in 2020🕐
@jenadunn76 I too have lost several friends and am not speaking with some family members over all of this. I don’t understand their logic. They’re following someone who is profiting from the lies he is spreading while ignoring the truth from people that they’ve known for years
@GrassrootsSpeak That seems to be his plan. He’s feeling out the response by addressing us tonight. Very little of what he does can be claimed to be proper execution of office. The legality of his actions are more than questionable, they’re actionable just as soon as Congress finds some courage
@jenadunn76 It’s none of my business but I am curious about how she responded
@Ironhorse76 Yes, it will be another point of reference to point out his blatant lies to the ppl still defending him
@ChasingOzPhotog @KnightBiologist @AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump More likely that he will have moved his family and extended family in
@VP @HallieJackson Maybe it’s important to choose words that more closely align with facts instead of twisting the words around half truths (or less) to justify a position. It isn’t that hard for most ppl to just be truthful but it does take some practice. Right now is a great time to give it a try
@NBCNews @marnie11 No, you shouldn’t air his address. It will be based on outright lies and propaganda and the MSM should take a stand to show the GOP members of Congress what taking a stand on principle looks like.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume The next step for me is Solar panels so I can drive my electric car w/o relying on the grid.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Blame whomever but the guy that’s spending trillions that we don’t have is not helping us in the long run.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume We are already Socialist when it comes to almost everything except taking care of our populace. The only thing preventing that is rampant greed. Our inability to satiate the greed of ppl who already have more than they need is what will eventually sink us
@ProudOkie897 @brithume No, the bulk of the profits are absorbed by the corporate elites. The share holders and the rest of the commoners divvy up what’s left. The gap is so obscene that even the greediest persons should be ashamed of themselves
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Except for the fact that I trade individual stocks and read financial reports from large corporations and the vast majority of them are profitable as hell. The problem is that the top scoops off too much and they’ve become little more than a Ponzi schemes.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Capitalism without socialism is just a simple game of monopoly. We aren’t even all that ‘capitalist’ anymore. Subsidizing corporations through the taxation of the masses is about as socialist as you can get. We’re only capitalist when we’re trying to justify not helping the many
@ProudOkie897 @brithume It hurt everyone, yourself included. We cannot sustain this long term. The problem with deficit spending is the unavoidable fact that the bill eventually comes due. It will eventually crush the middle and lower class.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume That just doesn’t hold water. His tax cuts helped the ultra rich and blew a giant hole in the budget. He is playing chicken with a train. Non of this is sustainable long term.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume There are a lot of back door deals which is why I follow the money. The money tells you a much closer version of the truth than the vast majority of politicians are capable of
@ProudOkie897 @brithume I haven’t read it. I may pick it up the next time I go to the library
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Which is why the Clinton’s were painted as monstrous. Bill dared to balance the budget (vetoed it until it was). Now, instead of hiring HC we chose a grifter, a cheap con man who says whatever he believes will accomplish his agenda
@ProudOkie897 @brithume They aren’t perfect but they say things that can be readily verified as true or false. DT on the other hand says things that are so ridiculous that I’ve stopped checking
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Government registration is the only thing that prevents us from becoming a Plutocracy.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume If you believe that the MSM and DOJ are both complicit in the derailment of our system of gov while DT, the guy who lies every time he opens his mouth is the answer then we’re far enough apart that discussion is pointless
@ProudOkie897 @brithume The rich can be bound by rules just like everyone else. All it takes is having politicians who are not on the take. We haven’t always been a runaway freight train of greed. AOC is a fresh face. One yet to be bought by the machine
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Your argument is hard to follow. Are you suggesting that the party that supports higher taxation for the ultra wealthy and supports benefits for the needy is the party that is guilty of rampant greed? If so, I’d love to hear a logical statement to support that
@ProudOkie897 @brithume And? Some ppl with money actually try to do positive things with their wealth. Bezos and Buffet come to mind whereas the Koch bros just try to manipulate the system and the simpletons into believing that you can only be successful by allowing their greed to remain unchecked
@ProudOkie897 @brithume I could explain all of this to you but it isn’t worth my time. Go to college and take macro economics.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Who was the last President with a balanced budget? Which President created an enormous deficit by giving away taxation dollars to the only people who don’t need it?
@Bmresistence Just tell her that sometimes stupid hurts and it’s that way for a reason. It’s supposed to teach you to not do stupid things. 🙂
@ProudOkie897 @brithume While we’re at it, what about the giant hole in the budget DT created by giving a tax break to the ultra wealthy? If you think that won’t cause problems long term then you don’t understand basic economics. His policies inject short term gains at the expense of long term solvency
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Sure, whatever makes you feel like you’re doing the right thing. AOC has laid out a taxation plan would pay for what she proposes. Billionaires hate it BC it would cost them money which is why they’re trying to vilify her. Why argue for the wants of the rich over your own needs?
@drjoegalati People are overwhelmed by nonstop propaganda that promotes an unhealthy diet. Put simply, people are completely brainwashed. You can’t address the obesity epidemic without first addressing the root cause. Many people have no idea what a healthy diet consists of, IMHO
@realDonaldTrump WTF do you know about honesty?
@realDonaldTrump Take them to court and sue them. I know that your lawyer is not available right now but surely you know a few others. Get Rudy to take the matter up for you. Should be fun. Good luck. 🕐🍄👇🏼🔥🌎👁
@ProudOkie897 @brithume Not at all what I’m saying. I could go for hours citing relevant facts but I’ve read some of your tweets &amp; decided that you’re a complete waste of time. Good luck w/your position moving forward. It’s about to get a lot harder to justify. 🍄👇🏼🔥🌎👁✌️
@ProudOkie897 @Jenn198523 This is a perfect example of why an intelligent person wouldn’t waste their time in a discussion with you.
@ProudOkie897 @brithume I’ve read a few of your tweets and have found no indication of intelligence. Why should I waste my time trying to inform someone who hasn’t put forth any effort to educate themselves?
@brithume He is bilking America out of billions both for himself and his coconspirators. It’s the equivalent of working at a bank for ‘free’ but stealing a wheelbarrow of money every day on your way out.
@KellyO He’s been unable to overcome his greed in order to pay his own bills for the majority of his life. Not really the same thing as not being able to feed, clothe, or house your loved ones. He doesn’t have any idea of the pain he’s causing. He’s never had to worry about privation
@funder Watch him stand trial
@realDonaldTrump We are all listening to the things you say. Most of us have a good enough memory to remember what you have previously stated. Lying about the statements that you’ve already made just gives the MSM more ammunition to use against you. Your base is shrinking and you are sinking.

@AnnCoulter It’s also as if you are profiting from the chaos that you are helping to create
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes You are the enemy of the people. Your policies will have an enormous detrimental impact on us moving forward. You are capitalizing on a ridiculous fiscal policy that maximizes short term returns at the expense of long term solvency.
@Mitumba10 No, many of us see this the same way.
@maydaymindy9 Until it becomes a real time problem for them. As long as big businesses are profiting from his policies then they will remain on his coattails. As soon as the market tanks they will abandon him. It isn’t loyalty. It is simply greed that is keeping them in line.
@UROCKlive1 I say he wouldn’t make it past day one of basic training. Besides, you can’t ascend the military ranks with his debilitating bone spurs.
@VP @POTUS This is all a diversion that very few people are actually fooled by. The answer to our immigration issues is better legislation, not some idiotic Middle Ages type wall.
@MissNyetTrump He wants and thinks he needs a greater crisis at our southern border. He is trying to cause anything that will move the spotlight off of himself with no regard to how his actions may affect the lives of others.
@realDonaldTrump Every time you speak it becomes more evident that you have no idea how anything actually works.
@WalshFreedom What sucks is the fact that it took a desperate situation for him to overcome his fear. Then it sucks that it was all an attempt to use the Soldiers as a political stunt. It also sucks that he blatantly lied and tried to turn a morale visit into a rally.
@susankey_key That divide has gotten deeper and more ignorant in the last two years. There’s no point in it. Just another means of controlling the many by encouraging the few to divide themselves into warring factions.
@tarapalmeri @benyc Good, we’re moving in the wrong direction
@GOPChairwoman @JohnCornyn Another lie from the party that has made lying their core principal
@ChasingOzPhotog I don’t get it. I never have. I’ve never looked at my junk and thought “what I need is a picture of this and then I should send that picture to random people that I don’t know”. That makes absolutely zero sense to me.
RT @brycetache: 2019 will be our year		A year of inclusion	A year of equality	A year of kindness	A year of learning	A year of listening	A y…
@JohnCornyn No, the Mango Mussolini owns it by rejecting the budget he’d already agreed to that you and the rest of the Senate voted unanimously to support. Spin it any way you like, most of us are just not stupid enough to believe you anymore. You have no credibility left
@realDonaldTrump No, this is untrue. We know it and we know that you know it. We have no reason to believe anything you say. The only thing that is truthful about you is the indisputable fact that you are a liar.
@LindseyGrahamSC Says the party with the giant budget deficit during an economic upswing. Also, the party that gave a tax cut to the only people who didn’t need one. This is all going to blow up in your face. So says my good friend math who isn’t going to be swayed by simple lies. It’ll expose U
The combined fuel/electric range of a Chevy Volt is 420. No way that that wasn’t planned. That’s just smart marketing. ✌️❤️
@ProudDemResists Hopefully, a fatal disease
@realDonaldTrump Go ahead and go to Florida. We lose nothing from your absence. Let the grown ups handle things. There is no doubt that all of this would run more smoothly if you left. In fact, just stay home. You won’t be missed
@senorrinhatch BS, you all voted unanimously to approve an agreed upon budget and the President went back on his words (nothing new about that). Instead of cowering before the demagogue, they stood up to him. You might not know what you’re looking at. It’s called courage
@AnnCoulter When the dust settles people will be left to justify their actions and words. In all cases, people will own the words that they’ve spoken. In some cases, those words will own them. In your case, the furthest reaches of your creativity and credibility will be challenged.
@AnnCoulter You answered your own question there, didn’t you
@christophelston IMHO, it depends on the flow of the statement, the speed at which the writer is trying to ‘speak’, if a comma is needed, throw one of those little fellers in there. So, we should definitely use them, but it’s really at the discretion of the writer. Just my too sense 🙂
I wonder how many people are going to make millions with insider knowledge of this shutdown? People who sold prior or shorted are in position to profit immensely. This isn’t about a wall people. It’s all about money. It also explains the obsequious position from our ‘leaders’
@SenatorLankford I am going to campaign tirelessly against you. Whatever it takes, your inaction against this megalomaniac is akin to treason. That wall is not the answer to anything but “what will feed this monster’s ego?”
@ChuckGrassley How about we address real problems, like the tens of thousands of ppl who die in the US from a lack of health care, or attack the root of our drug problem, the ppl who are addicted to them or any # or others that kill our ppl every year?
Ppl keep asking, “what should we do about the Middle East?”		We should-		Clean up the mess we made		Keep our promises to the ppl who aligned with us so they don’t get slaughtered		Be more prudent moving forward RE military actions		Otherwise, we’re just war criminals, aren’t we?
@ValKHeadley @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Clever. The difference between you and I is immense. I could take the time to discuss things with you but looking at you profile I think I’ll pass. Good luck moving forward. Your position is just going to get harder and harder to justify. Your creativity will be tested ✌️❤️
@VP @the_USO @IndyFund @WRBethesda If you want to thank me, you’ll resign and take Orange Marmalard with you
@stucam7771 @DutchessSarcasm We have A LOT more weak, easily influenced people than any of us realized.		I am embarrassed by this but it is a simple matter of fact.
@AnnCoulter You’re complicit in this and when the dust settles people will remember the position you took. If they don’t, I will remind them.
@1pissedPolack I get a couple of hours per night. No need to sleep, we have a live feed of a nightmare playing out right in front of us.
@realDonaldTrump Most of us are former Services Members,  there, President Bonespurs. I’ve had my boots on the ground over there multiple times. You can mock us if you like but we all know the truth. I stand with General Mattis 		🍄👇🏼🔥🌎👁👋
@kaitlancollins Exactly the amount that he has earned
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Because you clowns haven’t done your damn jobs and checked this megalomaniac. What in the hell are you waiting for? Do your job. You work for us. You can talk or DO SOMETHING.  Which do you think will be more effective?
@SenWarren Yes, please, this has all gone far enough. We would almost ALL universally support this
@LindseyGrahamSC If this is done in the manner that’s proposed we’re going to be guilty of facilitating the deaths of our allies at the hands of our enemies. If you clowns allow this, you’re far worse than just inept politicians, IMO you will be complicit in the murder of thousands or ppl
@realDonaldTrump Reagan was a puppet for the greediest among us. Reaganimics is almost as bad as Trumpinomics. How’s that ‘booming’ economy doing? Every reputable economist knows what is coming, you screwed us
@ChuckGrassley Oftentimes you seem downright personable &amp; I strongly support criminal justice reform. I am distrustful of you, and every other Republican because you have enabled the criminal in the WH through your inaction. You’ve cowered when you should have stepped up &amp; checked this nonsense
@LindseyGrahamSC We just know that we don’t align with his values. We implicitly distrust him. We are wary of anything he supports because we believe that his interests are nefarious and are the bidding of our enemies. Since he is a liar &amp; a thief, I will NEVER support him on anything. 👇🏼🔥🌎👁
@MKGenest “The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men”
@mmpadellan Yes, but that is what any normal person might do. I really don’t fully understand this megalomaniac, he doesn’t behave rationally. He seems to be trying to provoke anything that will justify military actions. We need Congress to step up and do their job to end this farce
RT @AngelaBelcamino: LIKE* if it’s time to invoke the 25th amendment. 		RETWEET* if it’s WAY past time to invoke the 25th amendment.
@tedlieu @POTUS No, not if we do it in a haphazard way. We’ll create more problems, aid our enemies, crush our allies and then the problems that we’ve created WILL COME FULL CIRCLE BACK TO US. This is reckless, stupid, and anyone who can’t see that isn’t competent enough to lead. NOT THIS WAY
@Lisamuse @HeidiTimken @tedlieu I agree with that sentiment but we went over there, made promises, made an absolute mess of things, and now we’re abandoning the people who aligned with us. This action is extremely bad for our worldwide credibility, not that that was all that high to begin with IMHO
@tedlieu These are excellent questions. Ones that should have answers before knee jerk reactions are taken. What do you think will happen if we just abandon our post? What expectations do we have that we haven’t created a power vacuum, ripe for exploitation from our enemies?
@MKGenest I would argue that we’re a Socialist Democratic Republic, that no government is really all one thing or another. The important ingredient being a free &amp; fair election process &amp; representation of the many over the few (particularly the elite few) but what do I know
@jaqs_the_ripper It’s going to get worse. He made every bad decision possible. It was almost as if he was acting in the best interests of our adversaries. He used our safeguards during an economic upswing &amp; has screwed us long term. This is going to be an economic downturn of enormous proportions
@tedlieu @POTUS Not in this way. By doing it this way he will cause harm to thousands of ppl. It is reckless. It is irresponsible. It should be criminal. He is sentencing ppl to die.
@Ocasio2018 Your candor is exactly what’s needed. Thanks 4 including us in this process in an honest way. Most politicians pander 2 their base, lying in whichever direction they feel will serve them. You may B the youngest member of the House but you’re setting the example 4 others 2 emulate
@LindseyGrahamSC @JuddApatow The people hired you to be a leader, so start leading. You work for us, not the criminal in the WH. After the smoke clears, the people will remember who stood up in the face of this and who cowered and hid. Surely our are smart enough to see the logical outcome of all this
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump All of them do. At some point we either accept that we’re a dictatorship or, maybe someone can initiate some checks and balances.		I thought we had more patriots in public office than this.
RT @SenJeffMerkley: It was chilling to see children locked up in a desolate, isolated tent prison in the desert. Children belong in homes,…
@leahmcelrath Fear, acculturation, combined with a bit of sexism and some lack of a broader ability to perceive things from multiple perspectives.
@realDonaldTrump We’re against leaving allies to be killed after they aligned with us. We’re against going back on our assurances. We were against going over there to begin with but since we did we are FOR cleaning up the mess we made.
@GotJanie A conscience, compassion and humility
@AnnCoulter If only there was an available brain transplant or at least a moral compass replacement
@davidmweissman Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, Seasons Greetings, Happy Chanukah, Feliz Navidad, Happy Birthday to Jesus or the Pagan, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, or any other faith’s equivalent. No one’s religious ideology offends me. The specific actions from the members of any of them might.
@JamesKosur @harleytime1 @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee Again, the rules in the military are fluid. They’ve changed over the years just like they are proposing to change them now. I don’t agree with this change but it serves as proof that these things do change over time.
@jenadunn76 @realDonaldTrump They’re holding the truth over him. That he’s a complete fraud, propped up by Russian money &amp; influence &amp; they own him. His ego outran his intellect long before he ascended to the Presidency &amp; the truth is coming out. If it was just sex, he and his base would just ignore it
@danie5794 Yes, thoughts and prayers should do the trick. At least she didn’t get tear gassed or left to die by our military.
@ATumblebug His ego outran his ability to think objectively and it happened long before he ever ran for office
@harleytime1 @JamesKosur @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee You’re wrong on one &amp; like most ppl who served, I didn’t get what was promised. Not really all that bitter. I get a check every month and still have my fingers and toes. I’m much luckier than many of my friends &amp; just content to make the best of it. I read those regs for 22yrs.
@harleytime1 @JamesKosur @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee And I’m a DV. I’ll say what I know to be objectively true on the subject.
@harleytime1 @JamesKosur @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee It was supposed to work just as you assert but in reality few fell under what you state and the majority were dirtbags that the units didn’t want. It’s just the reality of how it was used.
@harleytime1 @JamesKosur @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee Obviously it can. Case in point RIGHT NOW.
@harleytime1 @JamesKosur @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee WTUs were in the business of putting ppl out under the guise of helping them. It’s where we sent the people that we didn’t want to deal with. That caused those organizations to become inundated with ppl that needed to be put out. They did just that &amp; bent the rules as they went
@harleytime1 @JamesKosur @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee Regulations change all the time. If you insist on the opposite, it just shows you have no idea of what you’re talking about.
@harleytime1 @JamesKosur @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee You’re just objectively wrong on that statement. Commanders at a Company or Battalion level recommend and then it depends on rank of the Service member who approves/disproves the recommendations. That approval process is based on regulatory guidelines
@JamesKosur @harleytime1 @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee The regulations change constantly. Year to year in many instances. I remember this changing but don’t remember exactly when. For a period of time people were being processed out for HIV, then it changed, now back to processing ppl out.
@harleytime1 @JamesKosur @MilaceMcnair @Alt_FedEmployee The reporter is right (currently) and you are right for the time frame that you served. You have outdated data on this.
@george_capen She’s right. I can’t believe I actually agree with her but I do
@PamKeithFL It’s plausible but that’s also the best case scenario.
@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle You further destabilized it.		There you go. The credit you deserve.
@LindseyGrahamSC How much water are you comfortable with the ship taking on before you people take action?
@marcorubio I hear all about how we think from your side although I never seem to hear the same from our side when we speak amongst ourselves. The most logical answer that I keep coming back to is that the entire Republican Party is completely full of crap. You included
@treasonstickers 👇🏼🔥🌎👁
@jaqs_the_ripper @_BraveJustice @Farmer31548981 @davidmweissman @beccas1434 @Dobieblue Courage &amp; honor have no affiliation w/gender or anything else for that matter. I’ve seen big burly men cry and hide &amp; petite female Soldiers wreak havoc w/crew served weapons. When someone gets the boot via OTH, they weren’t a good Service member, end of story
@jenadunn76 I’m undertaking a similar venture as we speak but it is more primarily focused on the human condition relative to our need to assuage existential angst. The premise of the book that I’m writing focuses on our need to be led over our desire to be ‘free’. I’d love to read your book
@mommamia1217 I know for a fact that Rudy has quite the imagination. So what I imagine is that even he is running out of BS to attempt to cover the lies.
@treasonstickers That’s exactly what I heard him say, loud and clear and I agree with him
@tiniebeany Nothing surprises me anymore
@tiniebeany The President is responsible for this every bit as much as idiots that follow him. She should be held legally accountable and her parents should be held financially accountable.
@ugaswimmerbr1 Wow, there seems to be a LOT more support for an unnamed candidate to run against Senator Collins than this wall. Maybe ‘the people’ aren’t really all that excited about building this wall after all.
@GrassrootsSpeak No, they all need to be held accountable for their actions. The name ‘Trump’ needs to become synonymous with what will happen if you deceive the people of the US. No deals, no exceptions. Everyone is equal under the law, period
@itsJeffTiedrich Now Jeff, what makes you think that he drinks ‘diet’ anything?
@RawStory Yeah man, this is uncharted territory. We’ve never elected a traitor as President before. So sure, new protocols must be established. Because of Trump, we now need a legal mechanism to address treason committed by a sitting President.
@jenadunn76 People in pain should be allowed to alleviate that pain in any reasonable way. The only thing stopping the widespread acceptance of cannabis is our draconian laws that were originally penned as a means to disenfranchise our ‘undesirables’.		The war is over, weed won ✌️❤️
@MsMollyRachael The whole premise of ‘cannot be indicted’ is a legal opinion, one that can be questioned since our Democratic process was usurped. Even if the process hadn’t been circumvented by collusion, it could still be argued based on the merits of the charges brought forward
@ida_skibenes I wouldn’t watch anything ‘Americana’ until we all figure out what it was that dumbed us completely down.		You’re taking a chance. That’s all I’m saying.
@barsoverthere1 They have, it’s just buried by the enormity of the other things going on right now.
@matt_mcneal @Kokomothegreat Reported
@MissNyetTrump They ALL did. Every single one of them.
@billmaher This going to be much worse than a cyclical reset. This one is going to hurt all of us. What’s about to happen will be significant enough that no lie will be able to cover it. All the ingredients are in the pot, Trump stirred it, and we’re all about to be dining on cold gruel
@DaShanneStokes It circles back to a judge that would need to decide what course of action would protect our Nation’s interests. It all comes down to severity of potential risk &amp; right now that risk is plainly evident. I can’t imagine an adjudication that would preclude indictments in this case
@notthelastgirl @thomaskaine5 I think it may come sooner than that but it’s difficult to gauge. IMHO, we are only being held above water by greed. The execs are draining the money as we speak, once people start pulling out in earnest, the whole house of cards is coming down.
@tedlieu I’d like to see an ethics investigation/check for all high ranking government officials before, during (every six years or so), and after office to stop the blatant profiteering from public office.  Something much more thorough than a simple criminal background check.
@thomaskaine5 It’s only going to get worse. The holiday season is not doing much more than softening the blow. Full scale panic is about to set in and when it does we are in real trouble. There will be no lie that will cover what is about to happen.
@ShelbyKStewart It falls under ‘any act’ that undermines an ongoing investigation, so, at a minimum, it’s obstruction. Depending on what vehicle was used, formal deposition for instance, there are other potential crimes. Only a moron would try to argue that lying to the FBI is perfectly legal
@GrassrootsSpeak A minority he couldn’t denigrate		A repugnant ideology he wouldn’t espouse		A traitor he couldn’t befriend		A problem he couldn’t solve incorrectly		A cabinet member he could keep		An ally he wouldn’t throw under the bus
@tribelaw It’s hard to imagine that Trump didn’t have prior knowledge or that the Saudi’s didn’t, at a minimum, have a green light to do what they did. Put simply, I find it more plausible than not that the President knowingly allowed someone who spoke out against him to be murdered
@Sarah_SKG_1983 I like to start the conversation this way-		So you support spending less than we take in on revenue, a balanced budget?		Who was the last President to accomplish that?
@Ironhorse76 👍🏻
@realDonaldTrump You’d think you’d be better at this lying thing by now. The Democrats aren’t perfect but next to you they look downright angelic. 🕐🌎👁🍄👇🏼👮‍♀️🚓
@UROCKlive1 If Rudy was my lawyer, I’d be pretty open to a plea deal.
@BettyBowers At the end of the day it’ll come down to the adjudication of a person who isn’t going to be enamored by Rudy’s creative interpretation o ur Nation’s laws.
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews You might need to get someone from the a Democratic Party to review the case. None of the Republicans seems to know how laws work. My 8yo literally has a better understanding than most of you.
@LilithResists @uniqueliving4U It makes me want to take a similar photo, complete with the outfit and with the same stupid look on my face and then post it as a response.😀		People are ridiculous. I will never understand what they’re thinking.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The only problem with that statement is the fact he hasn’t been involved in the investigative process. Get a clean Mueller report and you can dance naked in the streets.		That’s not going to happen though, is it?		🕐☝🏻👁💪🏽👮🏽‍♂️🖤👺🍄🚓🏢👋
@realDonaldTrump Sure Donald, the whole world is colluding against you. They’ve all joined forces to 🛑 you from spreading sunshine and altruism🙄		I’ll give you some credit. You’re the single most valuable player in exposing the corruption of the GOP &amp; you’re raising tons of $ for the Democrats
@Stop_Trump20 Beautiful, I want this printed on my Christmas cards to send out to my MAGA family members.
@Ironhorse76 @Mitumba10 Trump is inimical, and needs to dethroned 		(Remarks complete)		🕐👮‍♀️🖤👺👮🏽‍♂️🚓
@lisastark351 @Blake35453649 Are these just creepy people or are they bots trying to move strong voices away from Twitter?		I get a barrage of 20yo supermodel types that just want to chat.		It seems like this is all part of a process to manipulate the content on this medium, IMHO
@realDonaldTrump You are using the kids to create fear in people attempting to seek asylum. You are one of the most vile people on this planet. You are being exposed &amp; your greatest fears will come true. We are all going to know the real you by the time this is over.
@KJMacDaddy @surf_snow_climb @davidmweissman Me too
@tgconsolidation @marnie11 @AnaCabrera @MaxBoot @CNN Some of us have been talking about the interconnections of all these issues for some time but like you I am thankful that it is becoming a topic of discussion for the media. Not sure what has taken them so long.
@JoyceWhiteVance Says the guy that was too weak to stand against it. At least he’s patriotic enough to step aside and let the opportunity become available for someone who can put some action behind their words.
@prof_cal Right, &amp; I was suggesting that we try to educate rather than legislate. People are free to think what they like but when they try to force those beliefs on others we have a societal problem. Instead of engaging in conflict, I suggest educating our youth &amp; discouraging via✌️means
@prof_cal Not if they are espousing hatred based on color of skin.		If you look at the original tweet, you will see that that is the reference.		Do you think that people advocating white supremacy may be right?
@prof_cal Conflict- serious disagreement or argument		I am saying to avoid doing that		Older people are more entrenched in their respective beliefs. That’s not an attempt to patronize but simply an objectively true statement		If you want to affect change, a peaceful approach is better
@prof_cal Conflict will be met in kind means that violence and vitriol are always met with the same. To break that cycle you must rise above it.
@prof_cal What that means is -		Older people set in their ways 		Recalcitrant is just referring to people stubbornly opposed to changing a repugnant ideology		I’m asking people to peacefully resist such ignorance and teach our children moving forward instead of engaging in hateful behavior
@DesignationSix @jrcinsideout I hate Trump		(Remarks complete)
@MrDane1982 Patriot, qualified, intelligent, articulate and not guilty of anything other than trying to oppose the GOPs blatant greed. 		Swear her in		Lock him up
@krassenstein He took the money. If they go down, he goes down. 		Application of Occam’s Razor, but we’ll see
@prof_cal Just out of curiosity, what flaw do you find in peacefully protesting white nationalism &amp; educating people that that ideology is inherently wrong?
@jaqs_the_ripper I am falling in love with her. She’s one of the very few that is unfazed by Trump &amp; is not at all shy about calling him out, taking him on, &amp; exposing him for what he is publicly.		President Nancy Pelosi		And she’ll have been placed there by the very people who loathe &amp; fear her
@leeleeb50 I asked my 8yo-		Me- “what would happen if you lied to the FBI?”		Her-“what’s the FBI?”		Me- “they’re like the police for the government”		Her- “I’d be in big, BIG trouble”		Me- “do you think you might go to jail?”		Her- “uh-huh, prolly for a really long time”		Again she’s 8 ppl
@BetteMidler I asked my 8yo-		Me- “what would happen if you lied to the FBI?”		Her-“what’s the FBI?”		Me- “they’re like the police for the government”		Her- “I’d be in big, BIG trouble”		Me- “do you think you might go to jail?”		Her- “uh-huh, prolly for a really long time”		Again she’s 8 ppl
@Dax_x98 Um, yes, yes it is 🙂
@MrDane1982 @eloiseat6 The ideal image of what what unchecked greed produces
@jenadunn76 Same here. I want boring back. I miss those days
@DeFeliceJanette Honestly, I don’t think that that is enough. At this point I believe that we all need to start nibbling on the edges of the lunatic fringe in effort to reach the ones that are still capable of understanding/following a cogent argument.
@Dax_x98 @deejay90192 I asked my 8yo-		Me- “what would happen if you lied to the FBI?”		Her-“what’s the FBI?”		Me- “they’re like the police for the government”		Her- “I’d be in big, BIG trouble”		Me- “do you think you might go to jail?”		Her- “uh-huh, prolly for a really long time”		Again she’s 8 ppl
@essenviews Unfortunately, yes
@jaqs_the_ripper My wife adds “Women are complicit as well, they help proliferate this ideology with the exact same types speech”
@jaqs_the_ripper It isn’t a hatred of women, IMO it all ties back into poor self esteem &amp; self loathing. They’ve been called ‘losers’ their whole lives &amp; bought into it. Instead of trying to elevate their station, they try to drag people down to theirs. White &amp; male is literally all some ppl have
@MrDane1982 One of my personal favorite politicians but I fear he doesn’t connect with enough people to be the best choice moving forward. He’s probably 5th to 8th on my list of people that I believe would have the best chance to win. That being said, he’s got my vote if he secures the nom
@Bornabrit1 Sadly, most of the people in Congress with any ‘balls’ are the persons who did not come equipped with them from the factory. Minus a few outliers from the Dems, most of our elected leaders are acting as if they’ve been neutered and lobotomized.
@TheRynheart @LindseyGrahamSC Just one question Lindsey-		How is this situation different from Bill Clinton’s?
@1pissedPolack Not as dumb as the people who are going to vote for him.		We should REALLY consider some broad scale reforms in education.
@MKGenest Just consider the source. Would you trade realities with them? You occasionally have to interact with them but they have to be them, all the time. Just think about what life would be like if you’d been given a life sentence of stupidity. I almost feel sorry for them, almost ✌️❤️
@realDonaldTrump Why should anyone listen to the most dishonest person in politics?
Am I the only one thinking that the looming government shut down is a ruse? It looks like a desperate attempt to delay the plethora of investigations that are encircling the White House.
Nancy Pelosi, THE 2nd most hated person by the Republicans may very well become the next President of the United States and it will be the Republicans who placed her in the position.		Irony
@realDonaldTrump “For the record”		You’re going to be doing quite a bit of that soon
@tweetmommybop @AmieMcWayne Absolutely nothing. I’ve already done a good bit of it so I’m backing off a little, pacing myself. I don’t want to get done because then I’d have to find something to do.

@veterans_i An exec from google explained why to a Congressional committee. It’s worth a watch.		Very funny and it doesn’t look like they understand the finer nuances of the algorithm that runs these search engines
@jenadunn76 Meh, it happens. Hope you didn’t spend too much time articulating cogent thoughts. The only thing worse is you get a great, sarcastic burn that’s far enough over their head that they don’t understand it and call you stupid.
@wvjoe911 @JackiePressley2 They should make it available on PPV. We could pay down our national debt with the proceeds
@senorrinhatch I for one appreciate the candor. It lets us know exactly where you stand. You follow the party line &amp; don’t care about right &amp;wrong		I’m embarrassed that I once called myself a Republican		I too will be more prudent &amp; get much more involved in the political process moving forward
You remember the first time you got yourself into a tight spot and there was no way out, other than facing the music? Me neither. That’s because most people experience this very early in life. Donald is likely experiencing this for the very first time and on a pretty grand scale.
The GOP is past the point of no return. They’ve robbed the bank, murdered the tellers, and taken hostages, but they failed to plan an exit strategy. They’re still in the bank, surrounded and waiting for the inevitable. They’re scared, screwed, and coming unglued.
@bridget_joy_ Because they’re past the point of no return. They’ve robbed the bank, murdered the tellers, taken hostages, but failed to plan an exit strategy. They’re still in the bank, surrounded and waiting for the inevitable. They’re scared, screwed, and coming unglued
@RealMuckmaker Mueller’s finished
@TheRickyDavila I just asked my 8yo what would happen if she lied to the FBI, her response-		“I would be in big, BIG trouble”		Do you think you might go to jail?		“Uh-huh, probably for a really long time”
@IShallResist @tryinntryin It’s going to get worse
The question that ppl haven’t been asking yet is how involved was Trump &amp; co in the murder of Khashoggi? Putin &amp; MBS look like besties &amp; Trump is clearly in both of their pockets. It’s hard to imagine that he didn’t at least give it the nod.
@LindseyGrahamSC @TeamCavuto @FoxNews Nah, I’ll just wait for your testimony. I have no interest in listening to right wing propaganda.
@realAliTweets The smart ones have laid low. The ones speaking up for Trump are going down with the ship. They have no choice. They’re complicit and all but caught. They will try to get off the hook but they took the bait, hook, line, sinker, bobber and then jumped into the boat. They’re done✌️
@leeleeb50 I believe she is part of the connective tissue that is currently binding us to our enemies. I don’t believe that she is an innocent bystander in all of this but we’ll see.
@jenadunn76 I agree, of all the things to be focusing on, her popularity seems pretty trivial
@HarleyRouda I wonder how long it will take to start hearing from the GOP. It has to be any time now. You guys took longer than I thought you would.
@SenSchumer @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP 44 of you are that deep into the pockets of the MIC? No wonder they’re so afraid of the news. This really needs to stop
@jenadunn76 Short answer, money. Until someone makes a complaint and finds someone that will go up against a University, nothing will change. It won’t get any attention from the ‘system’ until people make enough noise to motivate someone into action via political pressure
@jenadunn76 As a policy, this is a great way  for someone to find themselves in a law suit IMO
@jenadunn76 Any deviation from accepted legal practice opens them up for liability. Put simply, the victim/s in this instance would have a decent case. Once they start ‘doing their own thing’ they step out from under the umbrella of the law
@bolekaja1001 @tryinntryin @PattyArquette @AprilDRyan @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Love it
@essenviews He’s also the Democratic Party’s biggest cheerleader right now.
@essenviews He’s shown us how important education is		He’s gotten a lot more people to pay attention to politics		He is the single most valuable player in exposing the blatant corruption of the GOP
@robreiner Keeping your mouth shut in an attempt to weather the storm is understandable but if you’re still supporting DT you’re a traitor. There’s simply too much to ignore at this point, anyone still behind him is either complicit, too stupid to matter or too afraid to do what’s right
@BetsyGervasi @itsreallyalexb Sad, worried, angry and incredibly disappointed, mostly at our collective gullibility
@Bornabrit1 He’s done. He doesn’t seem to know it yet and his base is too dumb to know the difference but no federal judge is going to buy any of his crap. I am waiting patiently for the fake shock and outrage from the GOP. Should be anytime now.
@maydaymindy9 And the GOP looking for immunity
@AngelaBelcamino Some of my dead weight family members unfriended me. Good riddance, and I won’t be accepting any future friend requests from them. So I’ve got that going for me.
@PassTheSalty Meh, those idiots will probably wind up accidentally shooting them selves and each other.
@jenadunn76 They saw all this and more coming but are confident that we’re dumb enough not to see that reality. They are ~38% correct in that assumption and about 100% wrong.
@itsJeffTiedrich I too own a small corporation and have somehow never accidentally set up a shell corporation and unknowingly used it illegally to pay off someone that I didn’t do anything with.		It’s just a problem that I’ve never had. Lucky me, I guess
@itsJeffTiedrich Not according to a judge.		I really feel like his opinion carries more weight here.		Call me crazy but I thought that that was how this ‘legality’ thing works.
Just a reminder that Russia has parked long range bombers, capable of delivering a nuclear payload onto US soil, ~1.3 hours flight time away.		I feel like this is significant.
@JGreenblattADL Ok, but fighting groups of people is pointless. It is a battle of ideology that should be addressed through properly educating our youth and by PSAs, etc. to try to help our older, more recalcitrant adults. Conflict with the groups themselves will only be met in kind.
@idntlkthsid2 @senorrinhatch @washingtonpost The root of bigotry is fear. We are a binary creature. We either respond w/love, empathy and understanding (positive) or w/fear, hate and bigotry (negative).		Either way it is a conditioned response. Where do you think that divide comes from?
@senorrinhatch @washingtonpost The common ground is decency. It’s not difficult to find, all you have to do is stop hating peoples who are different than you. That only requires that you stop being afraid of them. It only takes a tiny degree of courage to overcome this learned condition.
@LindseyGrahamSC Ok, how about this, explain how that wall would have stopped any of the last three domestic terrorist attacks (mass shootings) and we can talk about the wall. Until then, we’ll just keep talking about gun law reform. Fair?
@girlsreallyrule And she laughs at those followers just like Alex Jones reportedly does. I’d bet money on it.
@KassandraSeven The truth? She won’t be. She’ll end up as collateral damage and be completely forgotten. In a way, she will benefit from the administration’s repulsiveness. When they finally do go down she will be one of the smallest fish, her career ruined, credibility nonexistent &amp; a pariah
@lisastark351 @pato3344 The impeachment process is all but a foregone conclusion IMHO but I worry about the outcome when the Senate gets the vote. This is the same group of schmucks that voted for Brett Kegger
@xDrGirlfriendx @thomaskaine5 Thank you. I’m currently working on a book on this and hope to get it published within the next year or so.
@maydaymindy9 Um, trick question? It’s the Donald.
@senatemajldr @senorrinhatch We’re all eagerly awaiting your retirement as well. It’ll be nice to have people that aren’t obsequious to a demagogue.
@thomaskaine5 @xDrGirlfriendx The individual gets deposited back into the amalgamation of all that is to be redistributed at a later time in another vehicle of life. Possibly immediately or maybe as some part of cosmic reset when the universe begins anew. Eons pass but for the person ‘time’ doesn’t exist
Ok, so we’re terrified of a group of poor people seeking asylum but Russia moving long range bombers into Venezuela is no big deal?		I feel like this is a 🚩
@MKGenest Fellow insomniac, I can empathize. It sucks.
@AuthorKimberley @marnie11 Some men do but I’d be willing to bet that women don’t find men attractive that have a stick up their ass and tell others how to live their lives.
@kallijo68 My dog has whole conversations in his sleep
@CJPatruno And this will quietly go away as more facts and charges come forward. Transparent posturing but I guess we’ll see how it plays out
@RonDufresne @coopies_mom @Boba_Tea_Catan @selectedwisdom I hope so. Right now he has too many supporters to make the inevitable a smooth process. I have seen a slight shift from the moderate right in my family. They still support him but they’ve become more quiet in their support. It is the behavior from the far right that is worrisome
@RonDufresne @coopies_mom @Boba_Tea_Catan @selectedwisdom His approval seems to have stabilized at ~ 38% and I don’t know what information can can forward in addition to what has already been circulating that will cause people to admit that they picked the wrong guy.
@coopies_mom @RonDufresne @Boba_Tea_Catan @selectedwisdom They will continue to ignore reality until it becomes blatantly obvious that further support will harm them more than jumping ship will. We are close IMHO but we’ll see.  I would have never believed it would take this much to force people to put country over party
@RonDufresne @Boba_Tea_Catan @selectedwisdom There’s more than enough to start the impeachment inquiry process. If that process is allowed to reach it’s natural conclusion then he’d likely become just another citizen. One facing a number of felonies.
@SaysHummingbird @kboyhan If this is true it would explain his recalcitrance towards his obligations as they regard to Tiny Handser
@ReneeLibby2 Bigly T
@cammaddox11 @medleylaura4 @kboyhan @gtconway3d Because that is what I was thinking about when I wrote it.
@Kris_Sacrebleu I read “there’s now absolutely no way we can lie our way out of this so we’re going to feign outrage and indignation but will continue to straddle the fence for as long as possible. Then we’ll do as little as possible in an effort to keep our base &amp; hopefully this all goes away”
@leeleeb50 People are wrong. The only thing stopping him from being indicted is an legal opinion. It was originally crafted to prevent partisan attacks through litigation. It was not meant to be all inclusive and it certainly does not elevate the Presidency above the law.
@nancymhet @aprilbaxter Exactly what I was thinking of when I wrote this.
@RBReich Only a person who has benefited from shady campaign finance would argue the point in that way
@ReneeLibby2 Tweety bigly bird
@ReneeLibby2 Snowflaked Disgrace
@TeaPainUSA Why bother with trivial matters such as this? Since we’ve determined that more likely than not he’s a criminal let’s go ahead and impeach him and then indict him. Saves the hassle of even deciding the issue

@EdKrassen @CarolSGardenFly The only thing I might change would be 60 or 67 votes instead of a simple majority. It would limit its use for those instances where the will of the majority is clearly being ignored and should serve to show who does not belong as the majority leader.
@Ocasio2018 @nynurses They’re terrified of someone like you (young, idealistic, candid, Representative of the people). Please make sure that their fears are well founded. Thank you for what you are doing. ✌️❤️
@realDonaldTrump Hey stable genius, you should look around you and mimic the customs and courtesies that the people are participating in. Hand over the heart or you can even brush up on that abysmal salute that I’ve seen you break out on occasion. Try not to embarrass all of us.
@RVAwonk @EricaHill84 @CNN Bold strategy. I bet a federal judge sees it differently but I guess we’ll see
@leeleeb50 I’m already prepared to hear the fake shock and outrage. Faux Infotainment has already started the process of distancing themselves. I look for the GOP to start following suit as early as next week. The smart kids have kept their mouths closed while waiting for the inevitable

@treasonstickers He’s been taught how to sit. If we can get him to stay we’ll be good.
@CCRN_ENGINEER @jimsciutto My wagons are drawn in tight as well. My prediction is that we’ll fluctuate until the first of the year and then this market will go through a series of corrections &amp; the panic will cause a cascade of problems. Unless Mueller drops a bomb before then, in that case it’ll tank then
@MKGenest Just a quiet day
@tara__incognita For once I believe him
The ‘POTUS’ not rendering honors properly as President Bush’s casket was carried by was far more disrespectful to the Nation and Military than the players taking a knee in protest. What makes it even worse is the fact he literally doesn’t know any better.
@notcapnamerica If he does I’m voting for him. If he doesn’t then I’m voting for whoever gets the Nom.  Doesn’t matter if it’s my first choice or not. No pouting, no protesting, just a simple choice
@JamesKosur Columbo technique, ask simple, polite questions until they implode. Personal favorite
@JosephRadmacher @maiamimi @cornell_vickie I don’t get the division. All of our potential candidates are pretty strong. I hope Hillary and Bernie don’t run but because I fear their chances of winning more. That being said no matter who runs, they have my vote

@MissMayVon1 @Marie_Em91 I’m genuinely curious what’s being said &amp; follow both houses, the SC, members of the exec branch, various judges, pundits, news agencies, etc. I do this in effort to get my news in as pure a form as possible &amp; then form my own opinions instead of waiting to be told what to think.
@realDonaldTrump @lopezobrador_ By ‘we’ you must mean us and not you. I don’t see you in office much longer but even if you miraculously complete this term, there’s no way we’re dumb enough to elect you twice.		That’s not a dare America
@ChasingOzPhotog The women in that group almost always fall into the same category. I think it stems from the jealousy of not being able to get laid.
@BobFern78 Overalls and flannels
@DaShanneStokes @GOP It has 2 impact them directly. They don’t care about us. They don’t care about this country. They don’t care about the damage or chaos. They only care about themselves. Their power, fame, wealth&amp;legacy. For them to take action, they have to believe that the action will serve them

@Pseudosaurus @cinders404 @susankey_key @Dangchick1 @Shakti74572 You may be right but almost everyone has at least one person. Even Hitler loved his mom. If he has any loyalty to anyone it will be to her but not to the extent that he would sacrifice himself IMO
@Pseudosaurus @cinders404 @susankey_key @Dangchick1 @Shakti74572 I agree with you. I believe he might actually care about her. In a sick, weird, twisted way but I do think that there might be a real connection emotionally with her. That being said, to protect his own hide I believe he’d drive the bus that he may have to throw all of them under
@h8Wankmaggot45 Anything new and synthesized/lacks instruments or Country music that panders. Give me anything that’s been around for a while or new that has a good beat, well played instruments and well thought out story and I’m in.

@leahmcelrath We all failed one another. They incorrectly thought that HC was going to win big so they ran their most sensational version of everything while trying to look impartial. We failed to listen to what was being said, particularly the things Trump himself said. My two cents

@lisastark351 It’s happened several times throughout our history. It doesn’t happen unless the President has a low enough approval rating that they have very little chance of winning but are too stubborn to step aside. LBJ was in this same position but was smart enough to concede and drop out.
@OMGno2trump @lexthepup Along with ~38% of us.
@BillEaster10 They’ve stopped using sm as a platform to obstruct. They can argue the ‘Infotainment’ angle for the show but it’s a tougher sell to include sm. My guess is that to some degree all of the players around the principal have conceded defeat and fat Nixon knows what’s coming.
@AmandiOnAir Out of morbid curiosity I would be forced to turn on Faux Infotainment to see how they spin it.		One good thing that will come out of this, I doubt they get of this either. I can’t wait to see who gets charged with what.
@treasonstickers Mueller’s net may have snagged an ugly turtle along with all the clown fish
@jenadunn76 The real question is - If they aren’t doing anything wrong, why is all of it ‘classified’. Classified should only cover military ops and sensitive foreign policy. What happens on the hill, for the most part, should be available to we the ppl, IMHO. I’m w/you, let’s see all of it.
@MsMollyRachael I am with you but you can’t change ppl. It’s a lifestyle choice &amp; one w/tremendous benefits but people are so conditioned to eat unhealthy things that they look at healthful foods as something to mock. I wish more ppl would just approach it w/an open mind.
@atDavidHoffman Yes, but not by much. The people who are still behind him are so brainwashed that it really won’t make much difference what he does.
@IndivisibleNet I always struggle with trying to give a thoughtful gift. Maybe put a few dollars on his books at the prison or maybe a book. How about “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie?
@Dangchick1 @realDonaldTrump I’m genuinely worried about that. They have every reason to be angry. Mainstream America forgot about them decades ago. The anger might be justified (somewhat) but their beliefs in this charlatan shows how gullible they are and why they got left behind to begin with
@rieth_damon @DeniseW48110148 Give that power to the House and require a 2/3rds vote. It would limit it to almost none.
@MiltShook Because they dared to spend only as much as we took in on revenue. They cut funding for our obscene MIC. The oligarchs that dictate policy by contribution were unhappy &amp; sullied the name so as to make sure it didn’t happen again. They were successful in convincing the simpletons
@TeaPainUSA Don’t forget Ivanka’s emails.		I hear emails are the worst of all crimes.

@Turnip2020 Well, you can form cogent thoughts. That and a D or I next to your name is enough to get my vote these days.
@stucam7771 Umm, it’s kind of a touchy subject. Those of us with working brains (a much smaller number than many of us realized) are more than a little embarrassed by all this.

@ChasingOzPhotog And not likely to improve any time soon. If I was last at something I might try something new but maybe that’s why I’m typically not last at everything.
@100_Disable_vet You may be doing nothing wrong but might just come across as a ‘guys guy’. For a young man this position can be absolutely terrifying. You may want to help bolster his confidence by taking a greater interest in the things he likes and by trying to bridge the divide he perceives
@100_Disable_vet You probably exude some level of masculinity that your wife and son both fear may lead you to be judgmental. This may not be the way you feel but it might be Important to engage in some conversation that will help to assuage some of those fears. Just a thought
@maydaymindy9 Well, I guess there’s a good reason that they’re last in virtually every measure. We the people are dumb enough to elect Trump. It stands to reason that the dumbest state in the union (collectively) would elect pretty much anything. No danger of them moving up in the world.
@realDonaldTrump No, I can’t believe people are dumb enough to follow you. Your tariffs are costing us jobs and businesses. GM, Harley Davidson, our farmers, Coca-Cola and others are all being hurt. Your lies are starting to catch up to you.
@ReneeLibby2 So, now I have that image in my head. 🙄
@DupeTask @WhiteHouse Who started them? Obama couldn’t clean up everything. All he was handed was two losing wars, an economy in shambles and a crumbling infrastructure. I wonder how long it will take for us to recover from the stable genius.
@OMAHAGEMGIRL @windmillcharger All it takes is a little bit of empathy to put yourself in their shoes. What is absolutely amazing are the number of people who don’t seem to possess this very simple method of reasoning. I have never in my life been more disappointed in my fellow Americans.
@bubbagump324 I’ve been saying this all along. It is the only logical explanation for his behavior. He is scared and scrambling to save his sorry hide. I imagine that Mueller’s net has quite a few fish in it.		Let’s make the hearings public. Personally, I’m dying to hear what Comey has to say.
@WhiteHouse Your thoughts and prayers are worthless. You want to support our Soldiers? Don’t send them into combat based on lies IOT fuel the MIC &amp; justify our deficit spending. We’re creating more problems than we’re solving, just like we did in Iraq &amp; the only logical explanation is greed

@realDonaldTrump I smell absolute desperation 4 a potentially important vote. Not a vote for the American people but a vote to keep you ahead of the myriad of lies &amp; corruption. I don’t see a way out for you. I can’t even imagine a scenario where you’ve outsmarted all the people you’ve denigrated
@realDonaldTrump Except for the ones who kill our journalists
@admiralmpj @DisabledResist @MSNBC It would be illegal if there weren’t probable cause to believe he may have committed a financial crime. There is plenty against Trump and co to get a warrant which is the same standard Congress is supposed to use.
@senatemajldr I’ll bet. A few ‘midnight appointments’ &amp; backdoor deals before people start to hold you accountable. I’m sure whatever you do will serve your corporate masters and screw us over even further. I am so utterly disappointed in all of you that I can’t even fully verbalize my disgust
@VP @POTUS This is complete BS. The VA ‘health care’ system is in shambles. Underfunded, understaffed, archaic, inadequate and over complicated. It absolutely sucks and you and your coconspirators have done nothing to help. Stop trying to take credit for things you haven’t done.
@senorrinhatch An award from the President? I wonder what criteria he used to decide you were so worthy. I’ll bet it has something to do with blind allegiance and turning away from your morals and ethics. Assuming that those are qualities you once possessed.
@LindseyGrahamSC Perhaps we would have been better served by sending emissaries instead of Soldiers to deal with the issue at the border. Soldiers are trained to destroy an enemy. Maybe they aren’t the best tool for humanitarian concerns. Possibly part of the reason why Posse Comitatus exists
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Our economy mirrors that of a drunken Sailor on credit spending binge. Our booming economy will implode once we have to start paying off the debt that you’re irresponsibly racking up. This’s the fastest possible route 2insolvency. It’s almost as if you’re doing this intentionally
@realDonaldTrump The only thing fake is you. Your hair, your tan, your wealth, your ‘vision’, your so called intelligence, your mail order marriage (she doesn’t care about you, she’ll be gone in a heartbeat when you go down), &amp; your Presidency. It’s all built on lies and it’s beginning to crumble
@LindseyGrahamSC @Freedom4all4321 @realDonaldTrump Depends on the lens you’re looking through. Purely from a financial standpoint you’d be right but you’d have to be a pretty shitty person to look at people solely from a financial perspective.
@TheRynheart @real_farmacist @RickSantorum I’d love to sit in on a GOP meeting. My guess is they sit around trying to decide how ridiculous the lie has to be before they start losing their base.
@real_farmacist @2021_free This is why we are supposed to keep idiots from making decisions for us.
@lisastark351 I‘d bet she sucks as a parent. Just a logical deduction since she seems to suck as a human being.
@mkraju Why not public? Who’s hiding what? Comey has been insistent from the onset that this be held publicly for all to see. Lends quite a bit of credence to the notion that he has nothing to hide. Let’s make Trump’s hearing public as well. I bet the ratings would rival the Super Bowl
@1SpiderMan2018 It’s great that they are publicly asking for their money to be returned and all but maybe it would be even better if they vetted people before handing over a campaign contribution. Not even a part of me believes that they genuinely care beyond the optics of it all.
@psychdr100 How the hell is anyone stupid enough to buy this? If I were in the GOP I’d be too embarrassed to even say this crap out loud. The only people dumber than the idiots saying this nonsense are the idiots who believe it.
@Ocasio2018 In no way is this an acceptable response to someone seeking asylum. This is reprehensible. Anyone who thinks otherwise is repugnant and does not represent the values that we as a Nation claim to have.
@Ocasio2018 Please keep doing what you’re doing. If you keep saying things that are factually accurate, people will continue to follow you. We need to get back to a place where we believe in the people charged with leading us. Some of the clowns around you have let us down.
@Ocasio2018 If he’s “not a scientist” WTF is he using as his credentials to refute the hordes of scientists employed by our government charged W/providing factual information?		The greed has to stop. Preferably before we make the planet uninhabitable by humans and the rest of life on Earth
@SenatorCollins The grave mistake is yours. He is what he is. Most of us saw his true colors long before now. If you &amp; your peers in Congress would do the job that we elected you to do, we’d have a check on him &amp; his unconstitutional actions. You’re too busy riding the fence 2 do the right thing
@realDonaldTrump Who cares? Grandma pantsuits is retired. Could it be that they are no longer in the political spotlight? If you gun someone down are you going to cite Burr vs Hamilton as precedent? I would imagine that you would as it’s the most ridiculous possible position that you could take
@realDonaldTrump All of you are woefully deficient in taking care of our vets. You talk a big game and then effectively ignore us, our needs and our health care. Specifically, mental health care is almost non existent which is only slightly better than the abysmal VA so called health care.
@SaysHummingbird You have 2 allow the hate 2 exist. You can minimize its proliferation by telling an honest account of its destructive nature. We don’t like 2 talk about the atrocities of Nazi Germany or our own ugly past but we must teach our children the truth ~these things or they’ll repeat it
@realDonaldTrump How’s it Mexico’s responsibility to address the people seeking asylum in the United States? We may find it inconvenient to process the applications 4 asylum but the right answer isn’t to send an armed response 4 a group of civilians. The right answer is 2 process the applications
@flyaway_k I think 12 days before it is officially a habit.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo You can spin it however you want. You bowed down and let Jamal get murdered on your watch and then did nothing about it. You’re weak &amp; this type of blatant cowardice will put off most people, even some in your base. I don’t know that you didn’t know about it beforehand. U👁guilty
@WhiteHouse Like the hardships endured by our Soldiers for your political posturing at the border?
@realDonaldTrump That’s not how this works. We know what you’re doing. We know what you want to be. This sort of thing doesn’t work in a healthy country. It works when the people are destitute and desperate. Look @ how the other Autocrats took power, see the difference? We won’t let you do this✌️
@realDonaldTrump It is their job to make that determination. We’ll have courts long after you’re gone &amp; we’d prefer to keep our current system of governance W/its’ flaws over your ill advised, undereducated, simpleton gut feelings. The justices seem to be the only check to your idiocy
@AngelaBelcamino He would serve Ramen, he’d forget to add water because it’s very complicated, probably more complex than anyone ever knew. Then he’d tell me how fortunate I am to get such a fine meal and then he’d interject superlatives about himself and talk about things that he knows nothing ~

@SenBobCorker Neither did I. What I absolutely can’t wrap my head around is why Congress hasn’t stepped in to do their jobs &amp; check his unconstitutional actions. He isn’t going to stop or become more manageable. He’s only emboldened by your lack of action. Might be time to hold him accountable

Hey Trumpsters, how important are Hillary’s emails now?
@1pissedPolack Everyone has traits that are less than ideal. However the voice is a large part of how attractive someone is. For me it comes down to an evaluation of the whole person. Since I am far from perfect I don’t expect anyone to meet my ideal of perfection. Tryst-yes, Relationship-maybe

@resist_games It is absolutely the perfect time to act a little childish. Not throw pep rally’s and work people into a frenzy over nonsense childish but we should play the hand that’s been dealt. That means at least a little bit of “lock her up”. We’ve earned that much. Seems fair
@BarbraStreisand Acknowledging climate change would carry with it a responsibility to make changes in policy that would take from the pool of money that he and his cronies are stealing from. I don’t think he is a climate change denier. I think he knows that he’ll be dead and he’s simply greedy.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump I’ve read reports that range from what you assert to they are good for our overall economy. The difference being the ideology of the person writing the opinion. The numbers in the budget don’t lie. We don’t spend that much proportionately according to the budget.
@Brasilmagic I believe that book has a few words about lying and it would be impossible to present a cogent argument that Tweetler hasn’t lied, almost nonstop, the entire time he’s been in office. I don’t even think he can help it.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump I imagine that the person driving the truck is giving a ride to the people and if anyone is supporting him my first thought would be Mexico’s government, to move the caravan along knowing that when they get to our border we’ll just send them back home.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump Immigrants tend to rely on assistance &lt; us. If you look at what we actually spend our money on you’ll find out it’s a small portion of the budget. You want to save money? Vote to reduce spending on the MIC. If we did that, we could provide for the populace, infrastructure, etc
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump That looks like a bunch of poor people piled on a flatbed trailer. I too might be worried but I’ve seen the real thing and it doesn’t look anything like that.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump My guess would be that they believe that America has more opportunities than Mexico. Seems reasonable enough since I believe the same thing.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump Source please
@psychdr100 This is embarrassing. I am ashamed for all of us. This type of behavior should be a confined to the pages of a history book. She is absolutely repugnant.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump Except for the fact that those immigrants that you want to vilify are much more likely to behave themselves than the general populace. Personally, I’d trade the alt-right in for that caravan and take my chances.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump Great, now define the specific criteria that must be met 2 reasonably call a group of people an invasion &amp; not just a group of impoverished people walking towards our border N an effort 2 seek asylum. I’ll give you a hint-they must B backed by a gov or be a well-regulated militia
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump I study constitutional law. What part are you referring to specifically.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump Sure man, we’re being overrun. Better go get your assault rifle and protect our border. Thankfully we have brave patriots such as yourself to protect us from this marching Army. I am too fearful to leave my house. Let me know when it’s safe. May God bless and protect you.
@DanRather The only thing that we should be unsure of is whether or not the POTUS knew about this before it happened.
@floyd_patrick @lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump I’ve been part of an invasion. Specifically OIF 1 (and others) calling them an invasion is both ignorant and disrespectful but you are entitled to your opinion. Even if that opinion is mired in ignorance and uses a questionable interpretation of the English language.
@Rey_Sistance ✋
@maydaymindy9 What are we going to do now? The right insists that email security is the most dire crime that could ever be committed. I guess we need to start a “lock her up” chant of our own.
@WalshFreedom I’m a retired US Army weapons expert (B4 identifier) and I say that the average moron doesn’t need access to an AR style rifle. I don’t believe in an all or nothing approach but would support some sensible legislation in effort to reduce the senseless acts of gun violence.
@Duckin15 @realDonaldTrump 22 years
@michaelschweitz She’s not very bright. She keeps stating that she is concerned about doing the right things but then caves to the pressure of the GOP, making her the focal point for ire from both sides. She’s destroying her political future.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Wow, looks just like Germany circa 1930s
@davidmweissman Nothing says that she can’t be both which is my vote.
@psychdr100 Nah, it’s his lack of courage and self appointed entitlement that keeps him from visiting our Soldiers and honoring our fallen. Might be for the best since Soldiers don’t tend to think much of people who are cowards.
@ChuckGrassley You can wish all you want. The only way this begins to improve is by asserting our checks and balances and holding him accountable for the things he says and does. If you let him continue unchecked he will destroy the GOP from the inside.
@lavery1965 @realDonaldTrump I’ve been a part of an invading force. I’ll bet you haven’t &amp; yet you assert that I’m the one that doesn’t know what I’m talk about. This is what’s wrong with your side, you insist that you’re subject matter experts on things you know nothing about. You look like a bunch of fools
@Orvieto2016 @ChasingOzPhotog @JoeyMinnesota I disagree with you about Nancy Pelosi but that is not a reason to act like a Trump Humper. There are good arguments for &amp; a few against her but we very much need to work together. Most importantly we need to limit the infighting. That’s how the simple side keeps winning.✌️❤️
@ChasingOzPhotog Dude, you really draw the ire from the simple side. I am a little bit jealous.
@AmicaAli Provide for them. It would pay dividends in publicity in addition to being the right thing to do.
@williamlegate @ReneeLibby2 Badly, either for him or all of us.
@BillEaster10 @POTUS I need one of those for my house.
@tinamichelehaze @SenatorCollins For a politician she is very much out of touch with the perception of her actions. The majority of the people are furious with her and she can’t seem to ascertain why. I don’t understand it. How can anyone, especially a politician, be this blind?
@WhiteHouse Might want to save your pardons. One second thought, the turkey is probably more worthy of a pardon than any of your criminal friends and family.
@ChuckGrassley You people finally found the word bipartisan. Where was that word before 6 November? The desperate scrambling by the GOP only shows the fear that you all must feel. If you’d done the right things to begin with you wouldn’t have anything to fear now.
@realDonaldTrump You know, if you hadn’t shirked your duty to serve you’d know the difference between an invasion and a caravan of migrants. As it stands you keep repeating the same lie that anyone who HAS served can see right through. It’s infuriating to those of us who know the difference.
@senorrinhatch Divert, deflect, pander, anything to distract us from the fact that you refuse to do the right things. This is the digital age, we are communicating with one another and you aren’t fooling anyone outside of your brainwashed base.
@SenatorCollins The whole GOP is scrambling to connect with the commoners. Wouldn’t it be more effective to just do the right things from the start instead of trying to do damage control after the fact? You aren’t operating in the dark anymore. More people than ever are paying attention.
@DaveVescio Empathy
@landers_ruby @realDonaldTrump And the House can order the investigations into all of the other allegations
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, we’ll get right on that. As soon as we get protection for Mueller, see your tax returns, and address voter suppression.
@EdanClay @MichaelAvenatti The circumstances sound a bit suspect but I still believe in due process. Even for Trump and his cronies. That is why I believe protecting Mueller is of the utmost importance. Without a clear, impartial rule of law, we have lost all semblance of a Democracy
@RepStephenMeeks @JanieLibrarian8 That is a callous, obtuse statement to make for a variety of different reasons. This just shows that you live in the echelons above reality. You have Marie Antoinette syndrome. All it shows is the distance in the disconnect between yourself and your constituents

@Chinchillazllla Partly true. The choices made by the greedy ensures that the most vulnerable among us remain impoverished.		So it is a choice just not a choice made by the poor but one made by the rich.

@michaelschweitz Well, we could do much better job of managing our federal forestry services if they became a budgetary priority.
@realDonaldTrump Your tone has sure changed. Acting like a decent human when it’s your future in jeopardy only shows us how repugnant you really are.
@cindyhydesmith What an absolutely obtuse statement to make. It is that sort of idiocy that will garner you nationwide support for your opponent.
@atDavidHoffman I think he may have known about it before it happened. I thought that by the way he acted initially. No one, not even him, is that stupid.
@OMGno2trump @TwitOrTweet2 I’m not so sure that his knowledge is limited to after the fact. It pains me to say that but with this President I find it more than just plausible.
@cindyhydesmith The least you could do would be to come up with a new set of lies. These lies are tired and we are tired of hearing them. We spend too much on an obscene MIC, we don’t really have a border problem and punishment no longer has much of a connection with the crime.

@SusanPaRN321 @realDonaldTrump Yes I do. The system is primarily broken due to greed. The most crippling part of the equation is the ridiculous amount of input from the insurance regulations. DRs are boxed into a framework that prevents them from being able order the care that the patient needs.
@DerekCressman @SlappyKeller The GOP is not going to do the right thing. They have no moral compass and I suspect most of them are as corrupt as our stable genius President.
@realDonaldTrump Clever way to say that you’ve cut personnel from the VA. I can guess who they’ve been replaced with, no one. As a veteran I can tell you that the VA health care system is well behind many 3rd world countries. It hasn’t improved in any way since you took office.
@realDonaldTrump The VA is broken. I’ll be dead before I get the care I need. I might as well have no insurance. All of you say that you’re going 2 do something. None of you ever follows through. Once you’ve used us up you put us in a system that doesn’t give us the medical care that we’ve earned
@CajPaLa @FoxNews Everyone who has been acting as a sycophant to the tyrant is about to become ostracized. I think that that reality is starting to seep into the psyche of the party. I believe Mitch and Lindsey are ‘hoping and praying’ for a miracle to cover their own transgressions. They’re dirty

@SenatorCollins We’d have a lot less need for diabetes medication if we were more committed to educating our populace on proper nutrition. Might be better to attack the root cause than to use our resources to mask the symptoms of a largely treatable condition (diabetes II)
@senorrinhatch @timkaine I’ve been waiting for over a year to see a specialist for a problem that I’ve been dealing with for several years. The VA is poorly run and you people have only made it worse.
@JohnCornyn Yeah, not buying it. He’ll say this and use it for political leverage if he needs it later. If he can’t find a way that actions will benefit him then he will never take action. It’s pretty simple really and some of us aren’t so simple that we don’t get it.
@worshipthevoid @Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking The two people on our side that Donald Trump seems to fear most are Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. Why do you think that is?

The morons within our group that are ready to minimize the older people within the group. I realize that the younger you are the more you think that you know but I’m old enough to know that that is objectively untrue
@Cajunwealth I love the exuberance but now is the time for a methodical, measured approach. This is one of the most dangerous times we’ve faced and we need to be extremely careful moving forward. Just the opinion of this old guy.
@rybane_ryenmei @AndreaCarnell @Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Also, I didn’t make this mess. People who refused to work together to accomplish common goals did. I’ve been on the side of the environmental all along but we’ve failed because of statements like the one you’ve made here. Do some math before you decide that you don’t need us
@rybane_ryenmei @AndreaCarnell @Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Hate 2tell you this but you get exactly nothing done without us old folks. We vote. Unlike the vast majority of your generation. Also, some of us R highly educated &amp; experienced in all the areas that you aren’t. Like Nancy Pelosi. The fastest possible way 2fail is 2get rid of us
@kimdallas07 @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Ok, so we divide everyone up on basis of specific issue, the one most important to each of us and then what happens?		We can’t tackle the environment by separating into tiny militant factions. We need to work together and be inclusive of the few Republicans that will work W/us
@It_is_NunyaDB @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking You’re starting to speak in a way that makes sense but two Dem parties equal two 25% ish groups. That a small enough number to be beaten by the GOP
@angryprog @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Why?
@Tindertwig @Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Dividing the troops at this point is what we call a “critical tactical error” which is a very nice way of saying that that method of operation is not very bright. Might want to think about the long game. It’s either that or brush up on your goose step.
@Tindertwig @Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Yeah, the old way was we stayed entrenched ideologically and that divided us into small enough groups for Trump to get himself elected. It wasn’t that long ago. Has everyone forgotten? You need old and young, far left and centrist.
@LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking They’re right. We’re pretty much stupid. We’ve gained a majority in one house and we’ve already decided that we don’t need to work together. Brilliant, what happens when the GOP wins again because we can’t stop infighting for 5 minutes?
@lettucewrangler @AndreaCarnell @rybane_ryenmei @Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking We can do much, but not if we go off half cocked.  Not sure if anyone still uses that expression but it fits
@AndreaCarnell @lettucewrangler @rybane_ryenmei @Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking We have to be able to work together. This will not end well if we don’t.
@lettucewrangler @AndreaCarnell @rybane_ryenmei @Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking The only thing worse than hearing the GOP complain about the Clinton’s is hearing us arguing about them.		There are no Clinton’s in office right now. We do have a Trump in office.		Don’t know about you people but I really think he’s the bigger issue at hand.
@It_is_NunyaDB @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking No, I am on the side of - we’d better pull our heads out of our ass and start working together so that people like Donald Trump and associates don’t continue to beat us and subsequently destroy our way of life and government.

@Saltypatty @LaTortugaHI @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Do you think that the GOP cares? We fight each other and they win. We work with one another and across the aisle as much as we can and we can affect change. Pouting and folding our arms because we don’t like one of our own accomplishes nothing.
@Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking How many die if we just fight each other and continue to allow the GOP free reign?
@SJBSchu @Ocasio2018 @shaunking I get it, here’s the rub, we haven’t even convened and we’re already fighting amongst ourselves. The GOP, if they’re reading our tweets (some are) are probably giddy knowing that we would probably rather fight each other than tackle them.
@It_is_NunyaDB @Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Speech like this doesn’t help. Sometimes I think we are just as dumb as they are. They divide us and then we help them by furthering the divide ourselves. This is why Trump won to begin with. You’d think we could grow up enough to work together for our common interests. 🌎✌️❤️

@Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking This is why we lose. We continuously divide and conquer ourselves. We need to stick together. We have an infantile egomaniac in office that will strip us of our rights and finish raping the planet to increase his own wealth and power. Right now Nancy Pelosi is someone we NEED
@TopherReisner @Ocasio2018 @shaunking Ummm, why?
@Chinchillazllla @Ocasio2018 @shaunking If we divide our efforts, we might lose our voice altogether. 		I get it, and am very much an environmentalist but I’m concerned that the current administration might be the most dangerous thing we are currently facing
@Ocasio2018 @shaunking I appreciate the commitment to the environment but suggest that we present a united front during this tumultuous time. We might be better served by putting aside the differences within the party and amalgamating our efforts to tackle the job at hand.
@Ironhorse76 Get her the bear 🐻 but put a little orange jumpsuit on it.
@SaysHummingbird @IloveFlorida001 He’s a disgrace to facial expressions
@DogginTrump Circling the wagons. Lindsey and McConnell are in the same boat. I’d bet money on it.
@AynRandPaulRyan @bradlsc @realDonaldTrump I guess everyone else’s leadership is more intelligent than ours. They were faced with the same challenging conditions and yet somehow managed to make it to honor the fallen. I’m betting that for them, the priority of doing so was much higher. 		This Vet won’t forget
@Mastermind7864 Nope, prose is way off
@JeffreyGuterman @karin_fluker @SecretService Those helicopters are equipped 2fly in inclement weather. Limited visibility means that the risk of flying is slightly higher. Considering the circumstances, he should’ve taken that slightly elevated risk. Commandant bone spurs couldn’t find the courage 2do the right thing, again
@realDonaldTrump Nah, the market is tumultuous because everyone knows it’s going to nose dive when the indictments hit. People are getting nervous as the impending disaster that is the truth draws near
@GrassrootsSpeak He’s done the following positive things-		Exposed the corruption of the GOP		Exposed our collective lack of understanding of government		Made us start paying attention to both houses of Congress 		Lied to us until we have started researching the truth for ourselves		Made us vote
@Swingvoter44 @StormMela Meh, every 48 years or so we just lose our damn minds and pick a dud we should have seen coming.
@AnnCoulter Why stop at the 14th? We could take a look into whether or not Faux News falls under the umbrella of the 1st or is liable for content detrimental to the country &amp; whether or not the 2nd is relevant at all. Maybe we could reinstate the 18th since you people seem permanently drunk.
@RodneyClaeys @ToddDomke Prose is different. He might have someone doing damage control. He’s pretty desperate if that’s the case.
@NBCNews Speeding it up is altering it.  We aren’t as stupid as your side. We just aren’t. We can think and use reason and logic. What works for your moronic base doesn’t work on the 2/3 of the population that came equipped with a brain.
@realDonaldTrump I would imagine that your life is turning into an absolute living hell. That’s the reality that you’ve created for yourself &amp; it’s the one you deserve to live in. It’s on you. You had the choice of what kind of leader you would be &amp; you’ve proven yourself to be a complete failure
@realDonaldTrump Don’t bother. No spin will erase the comments you have already made. I’m so thoroughly disappointed in you that simple words can’t express it. Pretty incredible considering my expectations 4U were about as low as possible, yet you still fell short. Same way Stormy feels I imagine
@SaysHummingbird He can’t even force his face into a configuration that makes him appear personable. The GOP is starting to smell like my boxer shorts after a week in the field.

@realDonaldTrump No, we the people would rather find out who really won. We know who would have won without voter interference and we suspect shenanigans in some of the other races. You people are pretty bold but you aren’t fooling anyone
@TheUSASingers @senatemajldr @FoxNews Everything that’s been going on is just posturing.
@krassenstein Not true. Plenty of people care. A larger and larger majority of the people care. Strange how long it took some people to start caring. Absolutely blows my mind that some people still don’t
@Palmetto_Joe @SenatorCollins Is your world flat?  Mine is spherical, I think see the problem here.		In all seriousness your argument is not with me it’s with a dictionary. Good luck with that.
@BetoORourke Thank you, more important matter, Cruz cheated. Unless the videos of people voting for you and the machine changing the vote is doctored, you got robbed. No way do I live on a planet where 4 million people would vote for Cruz. It’s mathematically impossible.
@SaysHummingbird He’s worried about his own transgressions. I promise you, this net has a lot more fish in it than most people realize. There is no other logical explanation for how these people are behaving.

@freezenfreeman @SenatorCollins Which state run news source are you referencing?
@Helenhs @IloveFlorida001 Impeach him too. Peacefully protest until they realize we aren’t going to concede. We the people are more powerful than a few corrupt politicians.
@VP @POTUS You had an opportunity to make a payment on that debt yesterday. Is the stable genius billionaire completely, morally bankrupt or is the account just overdrawn?
@ok2bright1 @SenatorCollins I don’t care about your feelings, there snowflake. I live in a world of facts and reality.		She, &amp; the rest of the GOP had ample opportunity to do the right thing and they passed. They paid for it in the midterms and are going to keep paying in 2020. We need leadership &amp; courage.
@Palmetto_Joe @SenatorCollins No, not even close. That’s not how it works. Misogyny is a dislike and prejudice towards her for simply being a woman. I dislike her politics. The fact that you can’t differentiate makes you not very bright. I guess we know who you voted for 🤔🙄✌️
@Palmetto_Joe @SenatorCollins I don’t think you understand what misogyny is. Here, I’ll prove it. Explain how this tweet is misogynistic.		Take your time. I just need a cogent argument using reasoning and logic.
This is leadership. This is what it looks like GOP. This is why we support her and have abandoned you. https://t.co/P0eEk78AqQ

@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Take your time, plenty of sights to see in Europe. It would take at least a couple of years to see them all. You should visit as many as you can and try learning some world history. While you’re at it, if you can break away from lying for a while, maybe you can visit the troops👁

@ChuckGrassley I don’t blame you. Anything except what’s going on, right?
@MaxBoot @GideonNeptune Good thing our troops are smart enough to accomplish their mission whether it’s raining or not. Maybe one of our Service Members can teach the stable genius how to shield himself from the rain.

@amyklobuchar The guy is a sycophant. Of that there should be no doubt. Stop candy coating and call it what it is-a clear and present danger, challenge to our ROL, obstruction, corruption and a desperate attempt to cheat from a man who is in way over his head.
@WalshFreedom You can be both and it’s blatantly obvious that he is.

Don’t let them use your platform to make their voice heard. They’re not relevant, so ignore them so that they stay that way. Let Fox Infotainment implode✌️
@WalshFreedom I couldn’t disagree more. Only words such as the ones that you are using are leading us to be divided. We start choosing our words differently, w/more compassion and unity, we become more unified. It is still ‘we the people’ but the responsibility remains ours to keep it that way
The only reason Trump makes some feel like a winner is the fact he sets the bar so low everyone can believe that they are winning
@JeffFlake We the people are relying on the few of you that we trust enough to put in the position that you hold. You know what course of action must be taken. Just please do the right thing.

@ajmeader @IloveFlorida001 No, I cannot imagine a reality where 4 million people vote for Cruz.
@maydaymindy9 I think that that goes too far. I agree that the term ‘conservatives’ doesn’t fit but words matter. I would offer ‘Radical Revolutionaries’ which honestly depicts what they are and shines a light on what they’re trying to accomplish.
@joncoopertweets @wesley_jordan I’d give him a D &amp; here’s why-he’s a failure as a President &amp; as a human being but, we aren’t at war and he hasn’t successfully taken everything over. As bad as he is it is important to note, he could be worse.
@4YrsToday @amparonakagawa1 You can’t align with Trump and claim to have class. Those two things just don’t go together.
@realDonaldTrump Our embarrassment resides in the White House. Do you know who Thomas Crapper is? Your name is about to take a similar dubious turn. Your legacy will long outlive you. You’ll be remembered as a-		Cheat	Joke	Moron	Liar	Thief	Worst Pres. in our history	Destroyer of the GOP		👁
@britin17k Nope, respect is earned
@marcorubio Is it more or less illegal than the rampant voter suppression?
@krassenstein Trump knows he isn’t winning. This represents his last efforts &amp; he’ll use them to be as spiteful and vindictive as possible. We’re about to see the real Don.

@Bornabrit1 It’s all an act. He wants a spectacle to divert attention from the actual issues. It’s a last ditch effort but he picked the wrong side to try to push towards violence. It’s just not really our sides thing.
@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA No, he didn’t. He ran a biased, unethical farce of an election. Great by your standards maybe but we the people deserve better. I hope you have an exit strategy.
@JohnJHarwood Both were phenomenal, I’d give the edge to Strahan
@th3j35t3r This is a diversion. Eye on the ball people.
@waltshaub @stowns1981 He can’t. There’s no point even talking to him. They have more than enough to bury Lindsey. He proved that at the Kavanaugh hearings
Thomas Crapper was a plumber and inventor who modernized waste management.		He probably isn’t remembered in the light he would have hoped.		I think the Trump name is about to make a similar turn.		I know it will if the Republicans can find their Patriotism.
@HHISisterwill @Rowdygirlinmt @melissakchan @Acosta Plus he just wanted to do it. If he is going down, he’ll act that way to everyone he can. Yes, he really is that petty.

@amyklobuchar He just said that the most important case in our short history set the wrong precedent. He’s either a complete moron or is trying to incite us. I say it’s the latter &amp; some of the former. They want violence so that he can attempt to assert martial law. This joke’s gone far enough

I agree w/Trump on 1 thing. We SHOULD be tough on crime. We can start by completely investigating Kavanaugh and the POTUS &amp; the rest of his cronies.
@Turnip2020 Could be better, could be a lot worse. Was really pulling for Beto and Stacy but at least we took the House. How about some investigations? Let’s kick this off already.
@realDonaldTrump You picked up a couple of seats where you already had the majority and then lost the House. You know, the people in charge of investigations. This is bad for you but I’ll give credit where it’s due, you’re one slippery MF.
@realDonaldTrump Is that “draining the swamp”? I’d bet everything I own that you have more to hide than they do but let’s investigate. I’m betting all kinds of juicy tidbits would be uncovered. I’d also bet that you’re the most scared person in this scenario. We can start with your tax return✌️👁
@TheRickyDavila @BrianKempGA She’s already started the process
@tiniebeany I believe just about any decent candidate could beat Trump. Hillary had too much baggage-most of which was utter BS.

@US395 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I proved it using YOUR paycheck. Since you, and all the people that you know are short of the numbers being used, doesn’t that give you pause? I know how they got the numbers that they’re using and while they aren’t an outright lie they aren’t exactly true either.
@US395 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Well, you could prove that the numbers are correct but (and I’m really confident here) you can’t do that without lying.

@lmroads @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You’re right. I just don’t understand how people fail 2 see the reality of what’s happening. I understand that some will buy the party line no matter what but this has exposed just how little most people know about how all of this works. It’s like trying to reason w/flat Earthers

@tedcruz Voted early, straight blue ticket. Everyone has a least favorite politician, you’re mine. Not for your policies but because of how you responded to Trump’s personal attack on your wife. If you don’t have loyalty to your own wife, I can’t imagine a scenario where you’re loyal 2 us
@HrdlyApathetic @senorrinhatch @senjudiciary No, because I paid attention and side with what I believe is right over party affiliation. An affiliation that until recently, was conservative
@HrdlyApathetic @senorrinhatch @senjudiciary And history shows that we likely got that one wrong too. It isn’t red or blue, for most of us it’s about right and wrong.
@senorrinhatch @senjudiciary So, the “investigation” where you drastically limited the scope and scale and then truncated the process down to a few days and didn’t even interview the principals didn’t turn up anything? Wow, that’s amazing...
Our “economy” isn’t doing well.		Just like your personal finances don’t benefit from a drunken credit card spending binge. We are spending money we don’t have while giving a tax break to our elite. It stimulates our numbers but it is a ruse. It is unsustainable.
@senjudiciary The response is that that statement is absolutely absurd and we know it and know that you know it. This tweet is just a probe, a litmus test to gauge our gullibility.
@realDonaldTrump Except that it’s your side that keeps going to jail. Please explain. Take your time
@realDonaldTrump @MarthaMcSally It HAS border security. I lived close to the border and know first hand that you’re just stoking fear needlessly. We don’t have an immigration problem. What we have is a White House that lies and puts big business before the average American. What can you do about that?
@realDonaldTrump We’re still waiting for the more substantial claims to be investigated. Clear his name and I’ll be the first to apologize. You had the opportunity to do just that. I’m left wondering why you wouldn’t take that opportunity to clear the name of what you claim to be an innocent man
@DogginTrump Already did my part and I live in a Red as hell state where my votes likely won’t make a difference but I voted blue down the line anyway.
@real_farmacist Well, no one has done more to expose the hypocrisy of the people in those groups. So I guess there’s a grain of truth in there.

@senorrinhatch Highest paychecks is a debatable statement. It’s a tough sell too since you’re talking to people who are living in the reality that you are lying about. The truth is, we’re in trouble, especially if we keep going down the incredibly irresponsible path you morons have put us on.
@tedcruz And Trump supports you, which is worse?
@senorrinhatch Even more unfortunate that we didn’t take the time to properly clear his name (if that’s what would have happened). You see Mueller’s response to allegations of misconduct? He demanded a full investigation. THAT’S what innocent people do. What about the women who were assaulted?
@tedcruz You see how Meagan McCain is acting? She is standing up for what she believes is right &amp; honoring her father after Trump was disrespectful towards him. It’s called loyalty. U should look it up. If someone spoke about my wife the way Trump spoke about yours, We wouldn’t be buddies

@nudog71 @OMGno2trump @UniversalSp1r1t As a retired Soldier, I can say W/absolute confidence that that would be an order that I would have refused to comply with &amp; I would assert that no Court in the military would convict a Soldier for violating the order because it’s not lawful to follow it. It’s a crime 2 follow it
@OMGno2trump @TruthBlueIn Unless they’re on American soil when they throw those potential rocks it is an act of war to fire upon them. If they are allowed to access American soil I doubt that they would be anything but grateful.

@DogginTrump @lalden73093 Voted early, straight blue ticket
@SenatorCollins Homelessness dropped because we’ve moved further in time from our last full scale military operation. People are finally getting the help they need (without being replaced by someone else rotating back) so the #s are finally dropping.
Just voted, straight blue ticket minus the 2 independents that were the only NonRepublican option. They said that they had had an unusually high turn out for early voting. I am hopeful that that is a positive sign. It usually means that people are dissatisfied with the status quo
@stucam7771 I believe the correct term is “misappropriation of funds” which is just a polite way of referencing theft. You have pretty much encapsulated what we have allowed to take place. It’s too bad that so many Americans are incapable of thinking through what you have explained so simply

@maydaymindy9 Ted Cruz. Mainly because he sold out and embraced the orange tyrant after he went well below the belt and attacked him personally and his wife. It would be poetic justice if his new alliance were to become his undoing. Plus, I just can’t stand the man personally.
@tedcruz Who cares? How is this relevant to your platform? He doesn’t mindlessly support Israel so we should go with you, someone who doesn’t seem to have a position on much of anything?
@ChuckGrassley My first instinct is to respect the thought that you are celebrating a win for your Alma Mater (or one of your loved ones) but the realist in me wonders your motives for sharing this sentiment. Regardless, even with our current divide, pulling for your team should be nonpartisan.
@ChuckGrassley Another example of oversimplification. 		Some of us actually know what the measure would have addressed.
@SuwayneC @realDonaldTrump I support the Medicare patients that are about to be in trouble.		I support the sexual assault victims.		I support my children’s future.		I support the environment.		What I don’t support is the clown in chief that is juxtaposed to all of the above.
@DogginTrump It’s a good idea. The truth almost always is. If people don’t act appropriately when presented with hard evidence then we have already lost.
@ellievan65 He is only interested in saying things that will motivate his base. Honesty and accuracy are a distant afterthought and the people still listening to him won’t hold him accountable to anything he says anyway. It’s more an indictment of us collectively than him at this point IMO

@realDonaldTrump College educated women hate you. In fact, all people with any common sense find you pretty repulsive. You’re better off exciting your base by insulting people. Still won’t win you the majority but at this point it’s really all that you have left. ✌️✊
@realDonaldTrump Wow, that’s a stretch even for you. Right now you’re 45th out of 45. You’ve surpassed Johnson as least Presidential, Nixon or Garfield for most corrupt and all others combined for most lies. The fact that you still think you can pull this off is the only thing that’s impressive.
@tiniebeany All we can do is vote anyway. If 2016 taught us anything it should have showed us that the polls don’t necessarily reflect the outcome and if we take it for granted then we can be stuck with someone that shouldn’t even be on a school board
@senorrinhatch Ordinarily this would be viewed as a positive but after the Kavanaugh debacle it just makes it look as if you are stacking the courts with sycophants.

Regardless, this will end with your life in ruins or our collective lives in ruins and your legacy will be the most corrupt politician ever🤔

@TheRickyDavila You don’t. All it means is they know that that explanation will work for this administration. What that tells you is that they may have had the green light beforehand. The response so far gives me no reason to give any more credit than that to this administration.
@SenatorCollins Ok, more than a little ridiculous to assert that all those agencies came to your aid in finding the person responsible for writing a threatening letter. The Army? Seriously? That’s not exactly what they do. Lie more believably.

@dinosaurj67 @mstbluee @michael21545351 @AnnaKrukCorbin @windmillcharger I’ve been saying the same things.  We’re doing enough things wrong that this will impact us negatively for years. It is impossible to predict exact outcomes but under no circumstances will the course we are on be positive long term.
@amerika_idiota @KuchenApple @mstbluee @AnnaKrukCorbin @windmillcharger Yes it does
@KuchenApple @mstbluee @AnnaKrukCorbin @windmillcharger Great, and how was that economy at the end of his term?  He got handed a country in a downward spiral, pulled us out of a recession, and is the bad guy? BTW, when you read the article it just states that he sent the bill back for revisions/review.
@KuchenApple @mstbluee @AnnaKrukCorbin @windmillcharger President Obama didn’t foreclose on those homes. If you speaking to the absolutely abhorrent policies being implemented in places like Detroit then you would need to look at those local governments that allowed/participated in those actions.
@mstbluee @michael21545351 @AnnaKrukCorbin @windmillcharger Well, the most basic premise is you should spend less than you make. What we are currently doing is infusing cash, that we don’t have (credit) into the equation to produce short term growth and make it look as if we are ‘winning’ when in reality we are not.
@SenBobCorker @senatornorris Good idea. Start sucking up to the judges before the charges even come down.
@BernieSanders Corruption is the only thing that we can’t afford. Our current level is untenable and it is time that we reassert ourselves into this process.
@AnnaKrukCorbin @windmillcharger Most people who speak about the economy have absolutely no idea how any of it works.

@Turnip2020 @realDonaldTrump I’d take the chance. You couldn’t possibly be any worse
@ABC You’re a disgusting reminder of what happens when we become complacent. You are going to be a footnote in history to remind others of what happens if they stop paying attention. We won’t forget this.
@realDonaldTrump We are, are, are &amp; we are going to rejoice when you’re escorted out of the White House. You’re a traitor &amp; we the majority know it. We will not rest, we won’t stop until you’ve been removed. You’re a repugnant reminder of what happens when we become complacent. You are revolting.
@MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins Spin it anyway you like. You know that you sold out. You’ll never escape your own adjudication. No matter how well you can reason your treacherous behavior to others you still know what you did was wrong. Good luck with your conscience and we the people will hold you accountable.
@krassenstein It’s under the ‘hypocrisy’ addendums
@realDonaldTrump The majority absolutely hates you.
@NBCNews Keep pissing in our faces. Eventually, you’re going to face the music. You’re a liar, a cheat, you use spirituality as a fulcrum and you have no moral fiber. You can’t outrun the truth forever. Historically, your kind doesn’t fare well. Sleep tight. We’re all thinking of you.

@calen1959 @ChuckGrassley Nope, I was a right leaning centrist until the simpletons voted in Hitler. Now he’s got a majority on the Supreme Court, one of the last checks on his executive authority. I am betting that you have no idea of what is happening right now and that hurts all of us.

@southbysouth7 @ChuckGrassley Nah, we just need to vote and take the keys from the people who are obviously too immature to have them.
@ChuckGrassley Nice deflection. No one can possibly have anything negative to say about this post, right? No, you’re a treasonous, corrupt, liar with no morals and we’ll hold your party accountable. We are still the majority. That’s to say the people with a moral compass who place country first
@kindcutesteve @tjbogart33 @voxdotcom I’ve studied Hitler and have been saying the same for the last two years. None of this is original, he is literally using the exact same playbook.

@Calisurf2012 @aaronpalmer @senorrinhatch Do I seem like a hateful person to you? I am on the other side. I am just like you but just view the facts differently. Who do you think that that fact benefits?
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch @MichaelAvenatti Sure man, I am the one taking a narrow view. The one that watched the hearing and then the interpretation of what happened by all of the news agencies including fox.
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch @MichaelAvenatti It’s a waste of time. I can’t even get you to acknowledge basic words and concepts. You haven’t answered a single question so I’ll leave you with this. What does the Bible say about association with known liars, thieves and people of low moral fiber?
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch @MichaelAvenatti If what you say is true then why are the most educated saying something different? Law schools, the bar association, ACLU, former Supreme Court Justice, all major news outlets, etc etc
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch @MichaelAvenatti Sure, sounds like you’ve already done a thorough investigation. I guess I’ll just take your word for it. Good thing we have you. Now we don’t even need due process. I can post answers to all of what you’ve got. That’s kind of the point, we have the process for a reason.
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch @MichaelAvenatti Wrong thread. What does this prove. I don’t like her, here’s why. You still aren’t making a case that the allegations shouldn’t be investigated. If she’s lying, she can be held accountable
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch @MichaelAvenatti And? I don’t remember isn’t exactly exculpatory. Last I checked anyway
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch @MichaelAvenatti You do realize that that was written after the fact? Many more have come forward with a different story. Some things should be done deliberately. This is one of those things
@aaronpalmer @Calisurf2012 @senorrinhatch So, just so we’re clear, full steam ahead. Not one of the corroborating witnesses have even been questioned. Again, is that the standard that you’d  find acceptable if it were your loved one that brought forward allegations? It wouldn’t work for me either. The truth will come out
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch @MichaelAvenatti I was alive &amp; rememberer what those terms mean. I can say that radical references Apple Pie n the vernacular of the day but some things can be proven as objectively true or untrue. Those terms fall under the same objective reality. At least for those that know what the terms mean
@aaronpalmer @Calisurf2012 @senorrinhatch I heard Fox News (Infotainment) day that very thing. That’s not what I saw when I watched the entire thing myself
@aaronpalmer @Calisurf2012 @senorrinhatch I hope your gut feeling is correct. The structure of our government is at stake. Good thing we didn’t take our time. Not like this is important. Due Process? Nah, let’s just take the word of the side we agree with, right? If someone harmed your child would you feel the same way?

@mjp818 @senorrinhatch He said, quite clearly, that he’d never drank to a point that he lost his faculties. Something refuted by his own roommate, friends &amp; acquaintances from the time period		He lied about the sexual innuendos in his yearbook		Also, his own roommate came forward with other allegations
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch He lied by omission, he lied outright about his drinking, he showed clear partisanship (disqualification), he was truculent, childish, evasive &amp; downright histrionic. He didn’t show the composure of a Supreme Court justice. Not just my opinion.  It’s shared by the bar and others.
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch So, it’s the Democrats fault that the GOP blocked Garlands nomination and it’s the Democrats fault that Brett K has been accused of sexual misconduct. Then I suppose it’s the Democrats fault that Brett lied. Got it, thanks for clearing all that up for me.
Fox was selling you fear and hate while Pres. Obama was in office and now they continue to spew the same fear and hate. That’s all they have. The fact that the story is always grounded in fear mongering tells you that they’re not doing anything but playing upon your emotions.
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch Merrick Garland
@Calisurf2012 @aaronpalmer @senorrinhatch No, she brought forward allegations and then there was a halfhearted truncated investigation done. The truth matters here. Some of us would like to know exactly what that truth is. Some seem intent on hurrying the process along. I can imagine why and it doesn’t sit well with most
@mjp818 @senorrinhatch I get that. It still doesn’t make the GOP holier than thou here. The thought that they are the victims in regard to getting the Supreme Court seat is laughable.
@senorrinhatch The hypocrisy is stifling. Remember Merrick Garland? Now you’re indignant? Seriously, you want people to believe that you’re the victim of partisan politics? How stupid do you think we are? Rhetorical question but rest assured that many of us are working to expose you. ✌️✊🏽✊

You can surely agree that the ‘investigation’ should have included testimony from the two principals. It sounds reasonable to me anyway

@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch You’re correct. He would be 1/9 of the highest court in the land. More than enough power that it should be occupied by someone who’s qualified, non partisan, even keeled, of character beyond reproach &amp; deserving of the appointment. Question being, Is he all of these things
@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch I didn’t say that it did. Unlike many I haven’t concluded guilt on anything but what has been proven. This is why we investigate serious allegations fully. If it were your daughters or sister or mother isn’t that what you would want?

@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch Yes, you can. There are literally volumes of books on the matter. Many of which I’ve read. Books on body language, facial expressions, deportment, length of answers, evasiveness and others.  Plus there are the statements from Ks friends that refute his testimony.
@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch That’s the key. I over drank &amp; I will readily admit it. Obama was asked &amp; he answered truthfully. Judge K? Well, not so much. He claimed he was a choirboy. Sometimes it isn’t the deed so much as the cover up. Just ask Bill Clinton. The truth matters, especially for a Judge.
@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch I watched the hearing. He looked as guilty as anyone that I’ve ever seen. Plus he lied about sexual references, his drinking, and refused to answer simple questions. That coupled with clear partisan alignment disqualifies him.
@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch If I was innocent, I would ask for a thorough investigation to clear my name.
@MomAutie @ellievan65 @GOP Keep right on harassing.
@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch No, I believe Kavanaugh’s substantiated histrionics.
@psychdr100 @thedailybeast That’s exactly what it is. Right now he is doing all he can to provoke a violent response from us so he can take reciprocal measures. We need to keep it together for a bit longer. We must continue to exert pressure and protest peacefully but forcefully.

@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch Right, he wanted the hearing before DR Ford could be brought forward. Any chance it was because he knew how damaging her testimony could be?
@NowBoaze @senorrinhatch Great, if she lied put her in jail too. That’s how justice works. Back to Kavanaugh, he lied and there is already plenty that has come forward that excludes him from the position. Not the least of which is partisanship, a clear cut disqualification.
@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch Well, you obviously didn’t watch it. Senator Jeff Flake called for the investigation. He voted Kavanaugh through the committee but let them know he wouldn’t vote to appoint him from the Senate floor.
@TIME Hopefully, we are entering into an age where sexual predators everywhere are scared to death. Perhaps the fear of being exposed will curb their repugnant behaviors. People who treat women with dignity and respect should have nothing to fear. #IBelieveHer ✌️✊✊🏽👁
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump A man with no honesty, no honor, no morality is trying to hide behind ours. We aren’t fooled by what you’re doing. We’ve been paying attention and your shtick has run its course. We don’t believe you or in what you are doing. Americans are not buying it anymore.
@ChuckGrassley Your conduct on the committee was abhorrent. You’ve taken droves of apolitical people &amp; united us against you &amp; what you stand for. We will be silent no longer. This misogyny &amp; bigotry won’t be tolerated. We will come together &amp; vote you all out. You’ve made it clear that we must
@US_Navy_Vet @WhiteHouse Just curious, what does that Bible of yours say about aligning with liars and thieves? Mine says not to. Is yours different? Take your time, go ahead and look that one up. I’ll wait.
@US_Navy_Vet @WhiteHouse If you are educated on matters of the market then you know that it fluctuates. It has been artificially kept from undergoing a market correction for many years. We don’t have any tricks left. What do you think happens next?
@Samarino1776 @WhiteHouse You believe Trump over all media? How does that make any sense to you?
@Samarino1776 @WhiteHouse If 90% of all media is against you that should tell you something.
@tthehuntress @senorrinhatch Sure, he was acting like any other guilty person. An innocent person doesn’t need to dodge questions by answering with filibusters.  An innocent person welcomes a closer look because they have nothing to hide. Guilty people want things to move fast and due diligence truncated 👁
@WhiteHouse This is the exact same propaganda that Hitler used during his rise to power in 1930s Germany. Just like when he did it this is mostly smoke and mirrors. Poverty is on the rise and the new found wealth is only going to a few select hands. We the people have been forgotten ✌️✊👁

@TIME Unfortunately no one is laughing. It might be funny if he weren’t still in the running for the seat that he has clearly shown that he is unqualified for by deportment. The ‘Deep State’ allegations have gotten ridiculous. There’s more proof that BrettK is a liar and a drunk ✌️👁
@real_farmacist @hockeyhoose15 @LindseyGrahamSC Great idea, we the people would love to have a voice in stating what is just and moral. You may have misplaced your moral compass but we’ve found ours. Apolitical people such as myself are furious, becoming involved and WE THE PEOPLE will right the ship since you seem incapable👁
@senorrinhatch A couple of questions, is his demeanor of the caliber that is deserving of a SC seat? What would you do if a Democratic nominee behaved as he did? Right, you’d be on your moral high horse. As it stands, you seem to have misplaced your moral compass. No worries, we’ve found ours👋
@rixxbiz @senorrinhatch I’m here, I just don’t do the back and forth with people who use propaganda slogans as facts. If any one of you would join in and start talking intelligently and citing facts we could enter into a mutually beneficial discussion. As it stands, not one of you has done this yet ✌️
@beaves_dad @senorrinhatch Moral high ground? What about after that child is born? Are you good with raising taxes to make sure those children are adequately cared for? Can we put you down as a potential foster parent for a child born to a family that is simply unable to care for the child?
@rixxbiz @senorrinhatch Decency? By blindly following a liar that has none? What does the Bible say about aligning with liars and thieves? Go ahead and look that up, I’ll wait.
@goshenhawk1 @senorrinhatch Good luck
@NBCNews It’s a trap. He’s trying to deflect by provoking and then pointing to the rebuke. We’ve seen this enough times that we are well aware of what he’s doing. We don’t need to hurl insults. Fortunately the midterms are almost upon us and that should be the catalyst to silence MR Trump
@senorrinhatch This seems like a litmus test for intelligence. How are we doing? If you are wondering whether now is the time to reverse course, it is not. You missed that boat. Now you’re relegated to trying to salvage what you can but further support of BrettK will derail your fragile party

@senorrinhatch Does it not matter that he lied, showed partisanship, was truculent, evasive, childish, and might be a sexual predator? Of course not, you think he will vote the way you want him to. What you’ve done is infuriate people who weren’t part of the political process, we are now 👋
@JonGuffey @ganny_roxx @peterdaou If nothing else these clowns have brought us together. We have a common enemy. Now we just need to vote.

@TIME If people start talking claims of sexual abuse seriously you might want to start worrying about your dad.
@Cocodriegal @RkfromNy @washingtonpost Yes they do, and it’s already coming forward that he lied under oath. An offense worthy of being disbarred. That coupled with his partisan behavior and truculent demeanor are more than enough to disqualify him as a SCOTUS. The lying is what will sink him, just ask Bill Clinton.

@LaxDax77 @RkfromNy @NBCNews @elizabethforma Ok, we can be friends. I like you. You’re super cool.		What is it that you want?
@LaxDax77 @RkfromNy @NBCNews @elizabethforma No, I’m just done with you.		You’re too smart for me.		I am unable to pontificate in a loquacious enough way to assuage your confirmation bias		The fault is mine. I lack a vernacular that includes enough single syllable words to convey a cogent argument to someone like yourself
@realDonaldTrump The people who are telling the truth are going to drown out the voices of the propaganda machine. This routine has worn thin with the masses. I will be supporting anything that is in opposition to the people that think the way you do.
@RkfromNy @BetoORourke I know what you are trying to do. It won’t work.  There are easier marks.
@RkfromNy @LaxDax77 @NBCNews @elizabethforma LOL, yeah, that’s what’s going on, it’s the “bots” and the “deep state” and all your other conspiracies conspiring against you.  I’m a real life verifiable person. I own a business. It takes less than one second to confirm my identity.
@RkfromNy @washingtonpost BTW that information came your buddy Brett, it was thoughtful of him to bring the evidence with him.
@RkfromNy @washingtonpost I actually watched the hearing. 1 July 1982. Facts are my friends, Fox Infotainment, well, that’s not where facts come from
@RkfromNy @realDonaldTrump Some of us sure are.
@RkfromNy Is that the lawyer who is representing the client that your guy slept with,then paid off, then lied about it, then got caught?
@RkfromNy @SenJohnHoeven 22 year veteran. DD 214, I’ll show you mine if you show me yours. 		Your move
@RkfromNy @washingtonpost The judge’s calendar put himself at a party, on 1 July 1982, with the people that DR Ford said were there. The calendar states that they were meeting there to drink. Start paying attention, facts are cool. They help you look smart when you talk to people		#thinkforyourself
@realDonaldTrump You’re the phony and everyone is starting to see it. You wanted to get everyone’s attention? Well, you have it. We’re listening. Closely, you’re not doing well, turn off Fox News.

@SenJohnHoeven I am a 22 year veteran. Stop using us to pander to people who have idea of what patriots are. I wouldn’t expect you to know since you couldn’t be further from one yourself.		A patriot does the right thing.		You’re repugnant		I am going to do everything I can to help the good guys
@Brasilmagic @karin_fluker Of course he wouldn’t. That’s how hypocrisy works. I do what I want and you do what I want. 		It just shows his relationship with greed and he clearly showed his disdain for the truth.		They can’t fool everyone.		Now the smart kids are paying attention.		#VoteNoOnKavanaug
@LaxDax77 I’m done with you. This is a waste of time. You have nothing to offer and don’t speak within the arena of truth. I fear you might actually believe the nonsense you spout. 		Anyway, the last word is yours. Do your best.		#midterms	#voteblue
@LaxDax77 No, this is why I don’t talk to people like you. You don’t use facts. They said they have no recollection. If you don’t understand the difference we don’t have a common understanding of language.
@maydaymindy9 He’ll come forward citing the turmoil for his family and try to spin it so it is the Democratic Party that has lied and he will do his best to play the part of martyr. It will convince some but not anyone who has been paying attention.		Thanks 2 POTUS that is a much &gt;# than usual
@realDonaldTrump Hey stable genius, maybe if you started saying things that were true and you stopped attacking them personally and professionally, they might report stories in a more favorable framework. Just a thought, from a grownup.		#truthmatters
@ChuckGrassley For someone who claims to know the law you take some pretty amazing liberties when talking about it. We aren’t collectively dumb enough for you to dupe. You’ll fool some but the days of playing the public hiding behind ambiguity are behind you. We are more informed than that
@LaxDax77 @NBCNews @elizabethforma Dude, I didn’t want to rude.		I looked at your profile. 		You aren’t someone that is worth talking to.		I linked her for you, what more do you want? I’m just not interested in you.		Someone will fight with you. It’s not my thing. ✌️❤️👋
@LaxDax77 Good luck to you. There’s an entire reality happening around you. Feel free to join in.
@LaxDax77 The fact that he brought a calendar that put him at a party with the other people that she asserted were there is epic.		And kind of helpful for the other side.		It’s nice when the accused is so sure of himself that he helps out the other side. 		#teamplayer
@LaxDax77 @NBCNews @elizabethforma You want to see if I know what I’m talking about?		I don’t have enough ego to care.		If you want to believe the other side is uninformed, based on, presumably, assessment of self, go right ahead.
@LaxDax77 No hate, we’ve all heard enough of that. 		Some women thought Ted Bundy was a swell guy. 		What does that prove?		Some people can’t judge character.		There are at least four women who don’t seem to be a fan, one’s a a Republican.		#sinkingship
@LaxDax77 @NBCNews I have a feeling you don’t know anything about @elizabethforma Elizabeth Warren. 		I don’t have anything to prove.		You want to learn?		Educate yourself, I’m not going to do it for you, stop being lazy. 		#thinkforyourself
@LaxDax77 Except for the calendar that Judge K brought, that put him at the party, with the people she claimed, even though he said he wasn’t there and didn’t drink that much, and all the other lies. It’s those lies that are going to get him. He’ll skate on the rape, sort of anyway
@wvjoe911 @samdu7280 Everybody’s paying attention. This is not good for you. You need to switch to damage control. You’ve overplayed your hand. In fact, any of you play poker?
@NBCNews You would win. It is that simple. Don’t think about it or talk yourself out of it. We need someone that we can believe in. You are that person. Who do you think would do a better job? If the answer is no one, then why not? You’ll have everyone’s vote that will listen to reason
@DanRather A few not so terribly bright people are trying to outsmart all the watching American people using the FBI. I like our chances
Everyone should relax. Trump’s been trying to think of way to outsmart the FBI for the last 48 hours. How do you think that went? Once they start the investigation they are allowed to follow leads. That can’t be truncated. The FBI is probably not their best buddy right now
@rbollinger73 @NatalieHilverda @corvowine @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons @amyklobuchar @FBI Within the investigative process regulations there is latitude built in to allow for following leads created within the scope of the investigation. There are safeguards built into the wording that make sure the job will be done properly. A 302 is as thorough as they want it to be
@ChuckGrassley You’ve exposed yourselves to the American people. There’s no ignoring you now. You might want to start damage control. Brett K’s nomination destroyed any chances you had at midterms. Values matter. People matter. You’re becoming irrelevant and your greed caused it. 		#GoBlue

@RkfromNy @washingtonpost You are absolutely precious. The judge’s own calendar corroborated the timeline and witnesses are coming forward. Stay witless if you wish, this won’t go your way. ✌️❤️👋
@jasperhairless A judge shouldn’t be held accountable for lying under oath?		Who is actually buying this?
@washingtonpost Some of the most damning testimony given was that calendar.		Thanks for bringing that forward Brett.		It’s hard to believe you’re that unaware.		#NoOnKavanaugh
@psychdr100 @Slate For me Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony was at least as compelling as DR Ford’s. Not in ways that were favorable to him. His histrionics solidified my low opinion of him 		He didn’t show a temperament that belongs on a SC seat		He’s his own worst enemy		The choir boy bit will sink him

The polygraph test is ~90% accurate or higher depending on who administers the test.  		There’s a 90% or higher chance that this nominee is guilty of what he’s accused of. 		And he may be voted in tomorrow, with no investigation		Please, think about it, does that make any sense?
@realDonaldTrump Yup, we know exactly why you nominated him. We know because we are more intelligent than you think we are and you are considerably less intelligent than you think you are.
@DanRather Sir, as always you are taking the high road. It reminds me that I should do the same. Many of us aren’t so much celebrating the implosion that is currently underway as we are exultantly relieved that this obvious farce is finally being exposed for what it is.
@ABC How can Sen Graham be this obtuse? Of course they played it this way. You fools set the pins up perfectly for them, handed them the bowling ball and then stood behind the pins with a stupid look on your face. Now you’re upset? Grow up, you made the bed with your lies,		MIDTERMS
After watching the POTUS ramble incoherently for over an hour it should be painfully obvious to anyone that he is unfit from a mental health standpoint to serve the people of the US.  		His behavior is indefensible. 		The loudest voice speaking against Trump is himself.
@MSNBC So, she is concerned about abortion but once the child is born she sees no need to protect them. 		She, and everyone who thinks like her are culpable in creating this toxic reality. 		The fact that her daughter is nodding in agreement tells you all you need to know.
@samstein @reneeriley419 For a judge, he isn’t terribly bright. He’d be better served by not saying things that are easily refuted by his so called friends. Now that some people have come forward, well, have you ever seen penguins line up at the edge of the ice?
@WickedNinja317 @NBCNews It’s actually not that bad. Now teach twittler how to read, write and speak and I’ll be impressed. It always amazes me when people, who seem to know some words, try to stand up for this moron. Then I remember that words alone don’t indicate that you can form complete thoughts✌️
@CNN It would be easy to jump on the bandwagon and say terrible things about this man but it is unnecessary.  He has been adjudicated and will serve out his sentence. My heart goes out to all of his victims and hopefully this will provide some measure of closure.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You want to address a global threat? 		Resign, it is that simple. Only the most easily misled still have an once of faith in you.

@JohnnyF21299213 @realDonaldTrump Awwww, my very first hater. You are ADORABLE sir.
@NBCNews How is it even possible to fit that much stupid in the same vehicle that’s carrying so much hate and fear?  		If you still believe in this simpleton, put on a helmet and start reading books. Seuss will be a good starting point. Not gonna lie, it may be a little painful
@BetoORourke Sir, perhaps the time for pensive civility has passed. It may be time to reciprocate in kind to the actors guilty of having stirred the emotions and accessed the fear and hate from the masses.  It is time that leaders feel the angst that we’ve been carrying for far too long.
@realDonaldTrump How can we forget?  We have mobilized in droves and are eagerly anticipating the election. I am voting for anything blue, blue wave, blue cyclones, blue man group, the blues brothers and straight blue tickets until you are out of a job. Bye Felicia ✊🏽✊✌️
