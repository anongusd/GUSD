Fact checkers are going to be working late into the weekend
He said he has built loads of wall but previously he had they were only allowed to renovate
He said they were restricted to renovating? Is this true - would love to hear from someone who knows the facts
POTUS just started to say how with wall he would need fewer staff on border &amp; then realised “if we had the wall we wouldn’t need all this talent” that he was basically saying he won’t need them - idiot

@soledadobrien So sorry for your loss. I miss my Dad &amp; I wish we had been closer. You are blessed to have such great memories- any Dad who is remembered in the way you remember must have been a great man. Hold those memories close when the pain of your loss overwhelms. I send hugs 🤗
@19lulu78 Oh so true - be best does not apply to spouses
@EyeLuvTiff @MarioFratto I live in the UK. Have our own problems but even I, miles away know your comment about national debt being down is ignorance - why is the question? Won’t read/won’t listen/blinkers on/believe every word you are told?14 year old family member in Houston would know facts like this.
@jemelehill 100%. And I would add to my list I would never say things about people’s bodies. It winds me up when people are mean, about anyone’s body or clothes they wear. Can understand correcting spelling from someone who should know better but bodies - that’s cruel &amp; mean

@smfh691 @muffy9999 @grlacrossstreet @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I hear you but do you know what “state of mind” means? “That you are not the sum of all those messages that your parents and teachers heaped on you (with good, bad, or thoughtless intention) when you were growing up. The use of “woman” is example
I think that the use of the word “woman” in last sentence is eye opening. Have asked @smfh691 if it was a man would she feel better about this https://t.co/b3T5GTgEe7

@davidmweissman 2/ Daniel 2 - 42 “toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. 43 “and  just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay. “
@davidmweissman 1/ came to same conclusion myself &amp; that is why for a few hours I went off Twitter as it was all too much &amp; shared that. I feel sad 😔 because it is becoming more obvious that their hero has clay feet &amp; yet they do not want to see &amp; attacking them will increase this
2/ sane person must realise that at the very least something(s) must be truth. Take off your blinders @realDonaldTrump is NOT God, a saviour- he is selfish to the core, amoral, a liar, racist, chauvinistic, the list goes on - hope you all have, to quote Oprah, light bulb moments
1/1 I have decided, this very minute not to read Twitter feed for a couple of hours. It’s all so sad, makes me so angry.  What really winds me up - headache time as blood pressure goes beserk is that followers just defend, never question- there is SO much out there surely any

@BillKristol @MaxBoot @jonathanchait Much head shaking here - @realDonaldTrump is dangerous because he thinks he knows it all &amp; never listens - I am 65 but learn everyday from others, especially those who know from years of study &amp;/or experience
2/ someone long ago told me if you can do a 24 hour road trip with a lover/friend (just the 2 of you) &amp; still be lovers/friends they are keepers. Realised yesterday that I would not cope if it was POTUS &amp;  I - the constant I AMESOME/WONDERFUL/CLEVER - list goes on - NO!!!!!
1/ Listening again to POTUS at the cabinet meeting yesterday I realised he just loves the sound of his own voice &amp; “talking down” to people to impress them with his knowledge (or lack thereof) @realDonaldTrump

@beakinderhuman @ChrisCuomo Totally agree with your comment- am so over hearing all the nonsense DT speaks but we must not loose sight of the fact that he is POTUS &amp; therefore all aspects of health have to be discussed BUT we need @ChrisCuomo says we need to focus on issues other than that - which first?

@RELBTX @ChrisCuomo Massive not massacre
@RELBTX @ChrisCuomo Nasty comes from the top. Whatever you think has been verified about @ChrisCuomo he is NOT the President of the  USA &amp; nor is he commander in chief whose every tweet can change the world. Being POTUS; CIC &amp; occupying WH means being a massacre cut above others / sad you can’t see
@ChrisCuomo 💕💕💕💕👏👏👏 clever
@seungminkim @LindseyGrahamSC Nothing for wall. $5 million for security &amp; more staff to deal with asylum seekers plus better housing - heck make that $10 million BUT permanent status for dreamers has to be included plus permanent status for illegals who have been &amp; are employed with no criminal record
@FoxNewsSunday @KellyannePolls @SandraSmithFox Don’t hold your breath but I am confident that @NancyPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer know what they are doing unlike @KellyannePolls, @realDonaldTrump &amp; @PressSec so if they do agree to an offer from WH it will be for good reasons not selfish ones

@kaitlancollins Classic - what happened to those “10” who were longing to do this job - slowly his “power” is being eroded. Wonder if he has nightmares of his “base” not wanting him anymore

@seungminkim Ghastly job
@neal_katyal I understand the “law” bit but that does not explain GOP supporting a man they must surely know is morally corrupt (to his core). They could have/should have said “enough” long ago. Where are their ethics/morals. They know he lies, 24/7 but make excuses for him

@donlemon &amp; @ChrisCuomo &amp; @realDonaldTrump  really thought about your discussion last night re funeral. I too would not be able to be nice - sitting next too understand- shaking hands - I could not but then perhaps DT went because 41 asked for him to be there. Hard one
@CBSNews I loved every minute of the eulogy - cried when he said all his Dad wanted to after his Mom died was to hold her hand again &amp; then I broke down when he cried.
I loved that 43 tapped his Dad’s coffin as he walked up to deliver his eulogy- a simple touch that said so much
