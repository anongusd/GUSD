As with all great business owners of today make the money at all costs pay as little Taxes as possible if u ruin the country on they so what
But as we hear all the time what a great business model more profit &amp; keep the shareholders happy bottom line is all that matters.
Walmart buys over in China and then ship back on foreign ships and then  put in there warehouses where works R underpaid with long hrs.
Walmart is the reason everything in our homes is made anywhere but the USA look around other companies had to follow Walmart's lead
Walmart is the  reason we don't make anything N this country any more,their business model put the USA as the country of greed  4 low prices
The Waltons R the Robber Barons of the 21st century They tell us they R the best 4 the economy b/c they have 1.4 million workers no slaves
It use 2 B a retailer took pride &amp; quality in the products it sold,But now we have Walmart take yr chances on what U get.1 law only Greed!!
Our Government broke up slavery we thought a long time ago,then came Walmart they came in towns run the mom&amp;pop stores out of business.
The real shame of it all is they bring in crapy products that last just long enough 2 be out of warranty when they go bad.that is all u get
If all will notice Walmart brought 2 the USA the Chinese way of controlling the masses pay them nothing and still make them work at all cost
Walmart is the 21st century look of corporate slavery,pay just enough to say U R paid but not enough to live on.while the owners live HI !

@maddow So if you are so right in your view of the President put your damn facts out there on your beloved show since you are so sure.
@maddow Your Life style is your business and your right but to denigrate our President for his personal feelings which is His right.
@maddow So u must be to much of a coward to voice your facts that the President said He was against the New York law.Which He didn't say.
@maddow So u are like Sarah Palin only answer your critics on twitter with a statement given by a Press Sec to the President.2B conti.
@maddow You can low ball the President all u want but facts are He has done more 4 gays than any other damn President take that to hell.
