Despite what @POTUS says, his administration is trying to rip away protections for those with #PreExistingConditions. New @OversightDems report shows how the Trump Administration's actions threaten millions of Californians.		Read it here: https://t.co/FEjEAbOgZh. #ProtectOurCare
This @OversightDems report shows, in alarming terms, that thousands of our constituents could lose health coverage and face exorbitant healthcare cost increases because of the Trump Admin's actions on #PreExistingConditions. RT and SHARE: https://t.co/FEjEAbOgZh. #ProtectOurCare
Protecting the popular clauses in the ACA that protects Americans from insurance discrimination seems like a no-brainer. But, for Congressional Republicans and the Trump Administration, their unending efforts to roll back health protections are as heartless as they are senseless.
Protections for those with pre-existing health conditions remains a high priority for our constituents and it‚Äôs shocking that the Trump Administration is unwilling to stand up for families facing costly medical bills because of the whims of insurance companies. #ProtectOurCare
The ACA prevents employer-sponsored health plans from excluding pre-existing health coverage. The Trump Admin‚Äôs decision not to defend this provision means 17,546,000 Californians with employer-sponsored insurance may be at risk of losing protections, including 382,000 in #CA33.
Thousands could lose health coverage and face exorbitant healthcare cost increases because the Trump Admin won‚Äôt defend every American‚Äôs right to affordable, quality coverage. In #CA33, 22,000 constituents with pre-existing health conditions are at risk of coverage denials.
As many as 856,000 older Californians may lose federal protections against coverage denials or premium increases as a result of the Trump Admin‚Äôs actions, including 34,000 in #CA33. Report shows 19,000 older adults in our district would bear the full cost of premium increases too
As a result of the Trump Administration‚Äôs actions, as many as 1,212,000 women in California who currently purchase coverage through the individual market may lose federal protections because of their gender. 26,000 women in #CA33 could bear the full cost of premium increases.
Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can't charge women more based on gender. Right here in #CA33, 47,000 women are at risk of coverage denials or premium increases if President Trump and the GOP have their way and further undermine America‚Äôs health care system.
If President Trump and Republicans succeed in rolling back pre-existing condition protections, 50,000 #CA33 constituents with pre-existing health conditions are at risk of coverage loss or premium increases. #ProtectOurCare
In California, if the Trump Administration is successful in its attempts to roll back Affordable Care Act protections, as many as 1,321,000 people could lose federal protections against coverage denials or premium increases, including as many as 78,000 people in #CA33 alone.
BREAKING: New @OversightDems report shows how Californians could be impacted by the Trump Administration‚Äôs unwillingness to defend people with pre-existing conditions.

DOUBLE DARE moderate Republicans to vote for this ridiculous tax plan.
What we do know is that this tax plan will hurt American families, plain and simple.
We still haven‚Äôt seen Trump‚Äôs tax returns and we still don‚Äôt know how this plan will benefit him personally.
It‚Äôs no surprise that Trump is on board with this but moderate Republicans should know better.
Increasing taxes on the middle class in states like California in order to fund tax breaks for the wealthy is both unfair and irresponsible.
CA is already a donor state to the federal government, meaning we give more in tax dollars to DC than we receive in services &amp; programs.
The GOP tax plan is bad‚Äînixing the state &amp; local tax deduction will lead to a massive tax hike for the middle class in CA, NY, NJ &amp; others. https://t.co/jhtz5hKAuf
