Great article about today's Michael Cohen testimony by my brother Krassenstein for the Independent https://t.co/3pQoQifVWu
Nearly everything that Michael Cohen was caught lying about, was either to protect Trump or was exactly the same things that Trump also lied about.  Yet Republicans refuse to believe anything Cohen says but believe everything that Trump says.  That‚Äôs what I call craziness.

The same Republicans who refuse to believe Michael Cohen‚Äôs testimony are the ones listening to every crazy thing coming out of the mouth of Alex Jones. 		I call that hypocrisy and insanity.
Here's a reminder to all Republicans discrediting Cohen today:		Michael Cohen was the finance chair for the RNC even after everyone knew that he had lied to Congress about the Trump Tower Deal.		You believed him then, so why don't you believe him now?

Looks Like the Apple Doesn‚Äôt Fall Far From the Tree! https://t.co/ZCMrmOhmP7
The only difference between Jim Jordan and Michael Cohen is that Michael Cohen is apologetic for the lies he told to protect a sexual predator in the Oval Office, while Jim Jordan is not apologetic for the lies he told to help protect sexual predators at Ohio State University.
Michael Cohen just confirmed that the Trump Foundation used charitable donations for Trump's personal gains on multiple occasions.		Trump literally was taking money being donated to good causes to benefit himself.  		Not only is this criminal, but it's outright DISGUSTING!
Can AOC please just ask Michael Cohen all of the question for the Democrats?
Michael Cohen just implicated Donald Trump Jr. in an apparent criminal conspiracy.  		Yes, Donald Trump's kids are involved in the crime family!

realDonaldTrump Your rhetoric is getting old.  You keep attacking immigrants for Human Trafficking, while your buddy Jeffrey Epstein was let off on Human Trafficking illegally by your Labor Secretary Alex Acosta.  You haven't said a single word about that yet!
realDonaldTrump Border crossings are down for the past 20 years.  What you are saying would mean that America has never had a "country".
realDonaldTrump Even your Republican allies realize that this is not a "National Emergency".  It's not that they care about America.  They just don't want a precedent set that allows Democrats to declare National Emergencies on Gun Control or Climate Change.

realDonaldTrump The solution to fixing North Korea, isn't giving them money.  The government would just take all of the money for themselves like they do right now.

realDonaldTrump And is that why he refuses to give them up?  Are you really this ignorant?
realDonaldTrump These are evil men, who don't deserve the respect you are giving them.  What ever happened to "being tough?"  You are a coward in the way you lead.
realDonaldTrump No one should have a "great relationship" with a man who is a murderous dictator!  You should be condemning him like you should be condemning Putin!
realDonaldTrump You are stating the obvious.  You are like a kindergartener trying to solve a nuclear weapons crisis.
realDonaldTrump When you say our "favorite president" will be at your celebration, does that mean that Barack Obama will be speaking?
realDonaldTrump And we don't want your "A Salute to America" celebration.  We already have Independence Day.  You are literally a slap in the face to our forefathers.  You are trying to give our independence away to Russia.
realDonaldTrump The only progress that should be deemed "progress" should be an agreement by North Korea to destroy all of their Nuclear Weapons and allow weapons inspectors into the country to make sure they hold this promise.  Anything else is just more rhetoric.
Sorry President Trump, the date of July 4th is already saved to honor our independence as a nation.		Any celebration outside of that is an insult to our forefathers, especially considering the fact that your campaign surrendered our independence to Russia.
realDonaldTrump Here is an idea.  Hold the celebration but let Barack Obama give the address.  He would better represent of our country.
realDonaldTrump Just admit it.  You want to hold a celebration of "DONALD TRUMP."  If you really cared about our military, you would respect men like John McCain and Robert Mueller, who have been military heroes, and you'd do something about all of the homeless veterans.

Congress needs to subpoena Trump's labor secretary Alex Acosta and question him about his illegal deal to let Jeffrey Epstein off the hook for sexually assaulting underaged girls, and find out if that had anything to do with his appointment by Trump.
JimCarrey I hope this case can be reopened and they can investigate all of the ‚ÄúVIPs‚Äù as well, no matter who they are.
realDonaldTrump If you are so insistent that you didn‚Äôt do anything illegal, how about making us all a deal?  If Mueller shows evidence that you broke the law, then you resign!

realDonaldTrump Wait until Mueller releases his report.  See if that‚Äôs still accurate then.  I doubt it.

ANOTHER GOP LOSS!		A North Carolina judge has ruled that an amendment to require a voter ID is "unconstitutional," based on the fact that the state's legislature was "illegally constituted," based on racial gerrymandering!		Thank you North Carolina!
If Trump really cared about sex trafficking, instead of focusing on his stupid wall, he would be focusing on firing Alex Acosta immediately for letting a sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein off the hook, and he would condemn his friend (Epstein) for his heinous actions.
