Today was my last full day as a member of Congress! It has been the honor of my life to work for the people of Northern Colorado. Thank you for the tremendous opportunity you have given me to serve our country these last ten years.
My condolences to the Bush family. President H.W. Bush had a love for the country that extended far beyond his presidency.
Last day in our D.C. office! 🤳 https://t.co/kwl4FD5ZbV

They are a united group who served to defend our freedom. Thank a veteran today on Veterans Day and honor them always.
We all can learn a lot from veterans, especially during divided times. Veterans are diverse- all races, all political affiliations, genders, and generations. But nearly every veteran has a sense of camaraderie and fellowship with other veterans.
Hoping for a speedy recovery for Justice #RBG. We are all thinking of you! We need your wisdom!
Too often, we wake up to the news of yet another mass shooting. When are we going to wake up to the fact that we have a nationwide problem with gun violence? It’s past time for Congress to act on bipartisan proposals that respect the Second Amendment *and* enhance public safety.
Any rollback of protections for people with pre-existing conditions would be devastating. Whether people are on the exchange or getting health care through an employer – nobody should ever be denied because of a pre-existing condition.	https://t.co/KY7WvEbRFS

A special, heartfelt thank you to Karen Mahany, who is committed to making sure that nobody else has to suffer the way she did after she lost her husband, Patrick Mahany, in a Flight for Life crash in Frisco.
It’s about time! Congress finally passed our Helicopter Fuel System Safety legislation, and we expect it to be signed into law. So proud to work alongside @RepPerlmutter to ensure that all new emergency helicopters are equipped with the safest possible fuel systems.
We cannot be complacent in attempting to stop mass shootings. If we come together, we can make a difference.
We can start effecting change by enacting universal background checks and thoroughly studying the causes of gun violence, as well as advancing other bipartisan gun-safety legislation that respects the rights of gun owners and makes us all safer.
A year ago, the world witnessed a horrific shooting in Las Vegas, 58 people murdered, over 800 injured. We all learned of the news with heavy hearts and a determination to effect change. We cannot lose sight of that determination.
“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the best way to reduce climate impact at the parks, the researchers said.” It’s time to listen to the warnings that science and Mother Nature keep giving us and act on climate change. #ProtectOurParks	https://t.co/VLjoGbQLeb
I’m proud to have voted alongside both Democrats and Republicans to take on the special interests and allow pharmacies to alert patients if it would be cheaper for you to get your medicine at regular cost, as opposed to paying your co-pay through insurance.

We need a justice who will defend our right to privacy, and a justice who will provide a check on the executive branch regardless of who is President.
Alongside many of my colleagues, I have urged the Senate to fully investigate the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, and re-stated my opposition to his appointment.
The next U.S. Supreme Court Justice must be unwavering in moral character and a defender of the constitution. Brett Kavanaugh has set off too many red flags.
Shoutout to @frcc, @ColoradoStateU, @CUBoulder &amp; so many students from Colorado for their input and involvement! We did it!

In the years after the flood, Coloradans have proven tenacious. Along with @SenBennetCO, I am doing everything possible to ensure that FEMA follows through on ALL its obligations to our communities.
5 years ago, flood waters washed over 17 Colorado counties. We got over 16 inches in the course of only 5 days.

It wasn’t until the second plane hit that we knew. Never on U.S. soil had innocent civilians been so brutally attacked, and never would we be the same.

We can’t ignore it. Suicide is a growing problem. It’s time to reform the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, giving it a three-digit #, similar to 911. I was proud to vote “yes” on the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act in July.
All students have the right to a safe learning space. It’s why I introduced the bipartisan Student Non-Discrimination Act (SNDA), which would protect students from bullying and discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

We need to stand with our allies and in strong opposition to the rising tide of fascism and extreme nationalism that, historically, always ends with death and suffering.
In one week, President Trump attacked our allies in NATO and cozied up to Putin who funds and provides military support for hostile regimes in Syria and Iran - and represents an imminent threat to the freedom and independence of the Baltic states.
President Trump is at best extremely weak and gullible on the international stage, and at worst is beholden financially, politically, or personally to a hostile foreign power. Having such a weak or even compromised President is a major threat to our national security.

We can and must provide LGBTQ people with abundantly clear protections from discrimination in law. Nobody should have their dignity and basic rights put on trial, just as nobody should have to walk into a store and wonder if they will be denied service because of who they love.
The Supreme Court’s decision in the #MasterpieceCakeshop case is disappointing, but thankfully narrow in scope. Now is the time for Congress to answer definitively by adopting our bipartisan Equality Act into law.
We must close background check loopholes, study causes of gun violence, prohibit accessories used to convert legal guns into illegal automatic weapons, and reinstate the assault weapons ban now.

Congress skipped town before passing a long-term budget or finding a solution for #dreamers who rely on #DACA - or for the children who rely on #CHIP. I thought we all learned in grade school that there’s no recess before finishing our work.

This tax plan is sadly a missed opportunity to boost our economy, grow small businesses, &amp; help middle class families get ahead. It was terrible yesterday, it’s terrible today, &amp; it will be devastating when it is enacted. #GOPTaxScam
Republicans just passed their tax scheme, again; this time sending it to @POTUS for his signature. I voted "no" on the bill. I strongly support simplifying our tax code &amp; reducing rates, but the Republican tax scheme only plunges us deeper into debt &amp; hurts middle class families.
BREAKING: Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a tax scheme that grows the national debt by over $1.5 trillion. It gives handouts to corporations &amp; special interests while plunging our nation deeper in debt &amp; hitting many middle class families w/ tax hikes.

Now, the fight moves to the courts, the states, Congress, &amp; YOU, who can use your wallet to pressure internet providers to continue fair practices &amp; reinstate #NetNeutrality
Knowing exactly how critical the internet is to innovation, I won’t give up on #NetNeutrality, &amp; am sponsoring a congressional-fix.
Against the will of people, the FCC just voted to destroy #NetNeutrality protections, effectively ending the internet as we know it &amp; stifling the free flow of information upon which our economy depends.
Kratom, a cousin of the coffee plant, is a naturally occurring alternative to addictive opioids and should be legally accessible. https://t.co/x6uhQ9SC60
The free flow of information online lets innovation thrive, but @FCC wants to rollback #NetNeutrality. We must protect the internet as we know it, and save #NetNeutrality.
This is not a drill. We cannot destroy the #ArcticRefuge by letting it become an oil field. It’s a national treasure, not a bargaining chip for the #GOPTaxScam

The #GOPTaxScam raises taxes on 82 million middle class families &amp; explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion. We need to put families first, not big businesses.
