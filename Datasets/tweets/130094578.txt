@gramaof41962 @TomFitton @CNN @realDonaldTrump If it hadn't been the #WitchHunt, it would've been something else.		We all knew the war was coming when he secured the @GOP nomination.		Out of the frying pan, into the fire - we all knew that! 		Never a question of if, simply when and in what fashion. https://t.co/P68VZTNwdt
@gramaof41962 @TomFitton @CNN Which, ultimately, has far more to do with ensuring conflict with Russia than shunting @realDonaldTrump's administration, which they would've just done via other dirty tricks.
@gramaof41962 @TomFitton @CNN What's your point?		This does not address him being an enemy puppet they used to handle Trump for years and make sure he didn't come to prominence politically earlier.		Nor his complicity in helping to manufacture the #witchhunt. https://t.co/fzv5VpsxDd

If we had backed out of #ParisAgreement but not agreed to handle mop-up targets like Syria/Iran, THEY would have had us in banker bailout 2.0 by now (the "Weimar" plan under Hillary, to bring us to Socialism via UBI etc.) 		Probably wouldve blown up a few oil derricks too. https://t.co/I3oQcyIfsb
We are doing all the other jobs too (Qatar, Syria, NoKo, Iran, now Venezuela),		We are doing the work.		It's why the economy is allowed to be turned on üòâ (good luck hearing that kind of Gordian Knot-cutting from #fintwit guru hacks trying to sell you something).
Who can blame them?		Weaned on steady diet of NFL football &amp; Fox News, which at last calculation had more closet leftists than actual Trumpists working there (Smith, Rivera, Walrus et al.), surrounded by "gurus" &amp; enemy plants/manufactured avatars who lead them to dead ends. https://t.co/R8AERv5DEQ
We should have peace &amp; commerce with Russia.		But I don't blame @realDonaldTrump for not doing a better job on this front.		He tried, Flynn tried, to get ball rolling early but everything is arrayed against us on this front, most especially geopolitical naivete of our own base!
Basic math:		If all @realDonaldTrump had done was get us out of the horrendous, economy-destroying #ParisAgreement and make it okay to say #MerryChristmas again, that would've been enough to secure my vote.		Me has done Vastly more; more than I ever imagined. https://t.co/b0dHGjD5hb

I swear, I look around sometimes at GOP and I wonder if any of these  people have ever started a business or done anything other than spend their parent's money their entire lives.		So easy to win with a few simple moves!		It's like they don't understand the mind of the people.
I tried my ass off to get people to focus on the marketing.	We could've made 2-3 simple moves and won the house in 2018.		Hell, we could've taken the house just on down-scheduling cannabis at the federal level, which looks like it will be inevitable anyways.
We lost midterms because we failed to market #MAGA to leftists.		Because we were too busy reacting to fake news like the witch hunt, or making fun of people who were brainwashed from birth to self destruct and take western civilization down with them. 	https://t.co/KHt5Tq6DKp

@ChrisRulon Minnesota isn't Minnesota anymore.		Within just 40 years on earth I have watched it completely change, it is unrecognizable as my homeland.		I believe in fighting, but not when it is ineffectual due to underlying logistical realities and ends in erasure of even the vestiges.
@ChrisRulon I want to grab them by the shoulders and shake them.		And tell them to GET OUT, while they still can.		And I want to do the same to conservatives in Minnesota.		Civilizations do not always win such fights, many times a culture is eradicated for various reasons.
@ChrisRulon I am quite grateful, looking at Europe today, that my ancestors fled en masse.		I see a day coming when the vestiges of Palestinian culture too have become destroyed.		Chewed up in the incessant machinery of globalism and its stated objectives.
@ChrisRulon Every state is a fiction.		We humans drew all the lines on every map.		Sometimes you have to let go of square footage in order to have an identity and prosperity.		America exists because of this dynamic.
@ChrisRulon the state of Israel too is a fiction, but it is a more convincing story for onlookers and they have the power and money, so it is hopeless 		the U.S. too is a fiction		I think the Palestinians should form a new homeland and give themselves a few decades of prosperity
@ChrisRulon I'm asking them to look rationally at the underlying logistics and realize that, in order to preserve their civilization and culture, before it is too late, they flee real-estate, and the fiction of a Palestinian state on that land.
@ChrisRulon I would never ask you, of all people, to do that.		Even if I rhetorically ask it, I do not expect you to actually feel that way.		Moreover, I would lose respect for you id you did.
@ChrisRulon I tell you, I have given up in many ways on Minnesota.		But there is nowhere to run if people like me keep walking away.		I wish I could organize a mass exodus of conservatives from Minnesota.
@ChrisRulon The Pleastinian peoples should organize a mass exodus, find a new homeland and rebuild their civilization.		They should become wealthy and Powerful.		And then, one day, they might actually have a chance of regaining what they consider their homeland.
@ChrisRulon a slave should never "accept" the condition of servitude 		but ineffectual attempts to become free are counter-productive		i want actual freedom and not just for myself, but for those who shall come after me
@ChrisRulon The thing is.	We are defeated.		We are quite powerless.	The public is braindead and that is a source of massive leverage for the enemies of freedom. 		I would very much like to free both the Somalis and the Jews.
@ChrisRulon Sometimes I check and I am not even sure why many people still put up with me. 		I imagine it must be impossible for sane people to understand my reasoning.		How can a sound money guy say we should negotiate with the cartel? You cant negotiate with terrorists.
@ChrisRulon Sparring like this is why I trust you.
@ChrisRulon @WayneDupreeShow All I see are two enemy camps, both of whom ultimately mean our Republic harm, one is just more open about it.		The Jews are a captive race man.		Zionism was created to destroy Judaism.
@ChrisRulon @WayneDupreeShow As if I didn't know it?		My commentary is made in complete affirmation of that reality of that fact.		The only question is which represents the greater existential threat and is more easily dealt with!	https://t.co/FXZcCgCGk1
@ChrisRulon @WayneDupreeShow You refuse to admit that the Zionists are a permanent fixture of the geopolitical equation, even though you know how powerful they are. 		They MUST be negotiated with.
@ChrisRulon @WayneDupreeShow Some limp-wristed and ineffectual stance against Israel is nothing, it is not helpful.		In fact, it is dangerous for everyone and does a great deal to offset the meaningful deal-making that has been going on for the last two years.
@ChrisRulon @WayneDupreeShow My reasons are far from ridiculous. 		A low-level puppet spouting palliative catch-phrases that do nothing so she can underwrite the "Death to America" meme, other than conscripting the accolades of the unrealistic, isn't praiseworthy.
@ChrisRulon @WayneDupreeShow I don't know.		Born in 77, grew up under this power configuration, as far as i can see, country has been hijacked my entire life.		Zionists are just one power broker group sitting at the global table of the NWO.
@ChrisRulon @WayneDupreeShow One of my core objectives is the preservation of this Republic.		Now, of course, one will say that any sort of negotiating with the enemy means the Republic has already fallen.
@ChrisRulon @WayneDupreeShow I disagree.		Furthermore I have come to disagree about whether or not we Should play ball with the extremely powerful Zionists, who simply do not go away when we ignore them or "challenge" them.

@timruss2 @startrekcruise Tuvok was the greatest Vulcan portrayal by any actor in the history of Trek, including better than Spock.		Now that sounds crazy to some, I know.

the way of the warrior is in desperateness		that doesn't mean being gullible	it means being ready to die for the right cause	it means being loyal		it means trusting the judgement of a man who has EARNED IT, Numerous times. https://t.co/9aAm7tWpzI

@BreeVandy i think deliberately is an operative word here, because I see people I like and respect caught up in the fog of war, blindly parroting tropes, massaged by their own fears and lack of loyalty.		i mean, climb the bluffs at Normandy loyalty
Did leftists even notice that @realDonaldTrump legalized hemp?		Nope.		Too busy being distracted by #FakeNews to ever admit or realize they are attacking the only guy who cares about them.		And we are just as distracted...		Instead of MARKETING #MAGA TO LEFTISTS. https://t.co/7h1nVnMUDN

@GovMikeSheridan I think this is why, historically, such an emphasis has been (and rightly so) placed on personal responsibility.		The strongest possible philosophy imo contains an appeal to the cultural norm of wanting to get as close to it as possible (even if it is not logistically possible!).
@GovMikeSheridan This...		Quite possibly one of the most interesting subjects in existence today, but most people wouldn't even notice it or look twice if they did.		The vast majority are content to remain within one or the other camp, or just acknowledge the fuzziness of the gradient.
@GovMikeSheridan @JLPtalk You have to give it time, very obscure system, but insanely accurate.		At least I found it to be so...		But you know what?	I gave it time and listened to many shows and gradually came to a very solid understanding of his approach.		It is remarkable.
@GovMikeSheridan @JLPtalk Honestly, they only two good shows in existence right now imo.		The work coming out of JLP (Fallen State, the daily show he does the Sunday church)		And this guy @NickDiPaolo, the funniest and most insightful comic in the business for decades.
As a student of the human mind, i say without hesitation.		I have learned more in two years studying @JLPtalk, than I did in over three decades studying the masters like Plato, Nietzsche, Freud and Jung.		He has an uncanny grasp of the inherent Game Theory that drives human life.

@lisanke instead of realizing just how puny and how desperate our situation is as a space-faring race, we are content to squabble over real estate on this planet while naively believing aliens will save us from ourselves		the real kicker about all this?		i'm right.
@lisanke but the idea of God actually makes more sense than ever due to contemporary high-energy physics 		ironically, the very ppl who attack religion for holding us back scientifically, have constructed their own repressive religion that could be the real end of us all
@lisanke think we are completely alone in the universe &amp; the conditions for organic life are Extremely rare		we fail to appreciate this and is our single greatest vulnerability as a species		everyone is terrified to admit it		they killed the idea of God and so must believe in exobiology
@lisanke i think our heliosynthesis model is primitive, there is a relationship between extreme density/fusion and singularities		and the balance is achieved through subspace (the unified field) over vast distances instantaneously (quantum entanglement is evidence of this)
Warhammer, Over 9k		-	best reality TV show of all time https://t.co/OlHCrLHirZ
@lisanke his analysis here is quite impeccable		and the fudging of the gravitational math being accepted as standard practice is quite telling 		its very important, because the belief has spread its contagion (deliberately) throughout other fields
@lisanke rather than investigating until empirical data shows us something tangible, we speculate in the vector of our desires and hold out hope 		meanwhile, it is more likely a kind of special phenomena peculiar to that system involving naturally-occurring bodies in an orbit
@lisanke i think it is quite telling how animals hopping around on a ball of mud hurtling through space desperately cling to the deus ex machina of exobiology as the go-to explanation, in a universe of such complexity
@lisanke the first clue was how close thermodynamics and electromagnetism are at a fundamental level
@lisanke there is no "higgs boson"		singularities are giant weak-nuclear condensers processing "gravity waves" through subspace out to every point in space simultaneously		Einstein was right, there is just the unified field

@PlatosRealm @lisanke or if the universe is a kind if brane amid a swelling "quantum foam"
@PlatosRealm @lisanke i dont think it is accurate to think of the universe from the standpoint of it being temporally finite, we have no way to examine its externalities, nor any way to determine if this universe (with multiple dimensions) is the only one
@PlatosRealm @lisanke this is what hey feed morons in the fake churches, the false version of Christianity, Catholicism (really paganism/occultism disguised as Christianity) 		i know what you mean
@PlatosRealm @lisanke n is the best case for super-complexity there is 		a dimensionalysis which actually expands while looking at it, thus rendering quantification improbable outside the realm of hypercomputing
@PlatosRealm @lisanke the universe appears to me to be a holographic fractal in n-dimensional, non-euclidean space 		primitive terminology like ambiguous catch-alls, such as "God," are a big part of the problem when it comes to actually discussing any of this
@PlatosRealm @lisanke "has to be created"		is not a construct i even advanced at any point
@PlatosRealm @lisanke a better idea of one aspect of "God" would be the matrix of all matter (mind)		in that all matter is merely just energy (from the underlying unified field or Dirac Sea) vibrating at different frequencies
@PlatosRealm @lisanke "created," in the sense you are using it, suggests a being that is inside the temporal loop of a euclidean space - this is obviously a piece of idiocy that is not even worthy of being taken seriously

I have such a love/hate relationship w/ Dinesh.		On the one hand, he makes films whitewashing civil war &amp; praising tyrants like Lincoln (a globalist/cartel puppet).		On the other hand, he clearly is a savvy, highly intelligent man of considerable taste.	https://t.co/CiUmJkZiiV
Almost no one has the balls to write articles like this.		VERY impressed lately by the yeoman's work from @bigleaguepol  and guys like @pdabrosca.		https://t.co/PSJEmNtbSu
@pdabrosca That wouldn't be a huge problem... 	But procedurally, at the cultural level, it very much is. 		Because the forward vectorization ends up being defined by weak hack frauds who are barely distinguishable from the enemy's own assets.		Indeed, these are #RINO assets.
@pdabrosca I mean, what do we really expect from never-trumper Shapiro minions, but the problem is a serious one.		We have many traitors in our midst, this particular behaviorism seems to be the common factor.		The problem is, they get taken seriously.	They steal limelight from the worthy.
