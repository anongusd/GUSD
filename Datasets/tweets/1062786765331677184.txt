@SpeakerPelosi @BernieSanders just curious, all three @DNC leaders in VA are facing scandals and are being called to resign. I believe a Democrat in #BlackFace is still better for the black community than any #Republicans are you still going to say they all should leave VA?
@tomsegura @ChristinaP is there a #FuckMcdonalds yet?
@JohnKasich @CNN So you're going to primary @realDonaldTrump in #2020election right? Please, please, please. #RussianAssetInTheWhiteHouse
@realDonaldTrump You're a literal piece of human garbage. This is some seriously #racist . #RussianAssetInTheWhiteHouse
@GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Oh wow, latino families fleeing for their lives, how terrifying.... do you all not understand how obviously racist this is? I mean I bet you all call yourselves Christian, take a good goddamn look in the mirror. #TrumpShutdown2019 #RussianAsset #RacistWall #GovernmentShutdown
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump Senator, I have never been more worried about the state of our nation. #BarrConfirmationHearing scared the hell out of me as a gay man, not to mention, the #TrumpShutdown2019 is still going and @realDonaldTrump may actually be a #RussianAssetInTheWhiteHouse , where's the #hope ?
@SenGillibrand I'm not sure if this is the most effective use of your time right now, Senator. Why are you on @colbertlateshow and not screaming at the top of your lungs that @realDonaldTrump the #RussianAsset is trying trying to pull the #US out of #NATO ? Do something for us now, not 2020.
@tedlieu @maddow how are there not immediately impeachment proceedings over this entire day? @realDonaldTrump is literally acting like a #RussianAsset
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi 	Madam Speaker, in the light of @realDonaldTrump discussing the US removal from #NATO what are your plans in your role to protect the #UnitedStates ? It is not going well for this country. #TrumpShutdown2019 is in full swing. It sounds like there is a #RussianAsset

@marcushjohnson Her path is the Hillary path.
@SenKamalaHarris Decent sentiment but what action are you taking to protect the country from the #RussianAsset ?
@SenateDems @SenGillibrand @maziehirono @SenSchumer is there enough anti-trump sentiment around Republican senators for you to actually filibuster the #BarrConfirmation ? How do you intend to protect our nation from the #RussianAsset ? I literally don't understand our country rn.
@VP @marklevinshow What crisis? The one made of whole cloth? #TrumpShutdown2019
@DanRather Preach! #RussianAsset
@charliekirk11 Prove it. Oh that's right, you can't. Also, how much illegal labor saves American companies every year? The answer is hundreds of billions for jobs Americans will not do. These arguments are objectively racist. Stop being stupid about this #RussianAsset #idiots #govermentshutdown
@Jim_Jordan @DonaldJTrumpJr You say leakers, we say Patriots #RussianAsset #TrumpShutdown
@ZachFurr1000 We should have the report by then. I'm pretty confident it won't be great news for the administration.
@ZachFurr1000 Talk to me in March.
@Harry1T6 @Cernovich Idiot.
@Cernovich I suppose if you dont read, you dont know anything. And yes, we would. The ramifications are too severe in this case for your point to be pertinent. #TrumpShutdown2019
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He won't open the government because he @AnnCoulter 's cuck. #TrumpShutdown2019 #RussianAsset #CUCKOLDtrump
@KamalaHarris and @SenSchumer are the dems going to call the special counsel into the AG confirmation? #RussianAssetInTheWhiteHouse
@mikedebonis @Cernovich @GOPLeader What are you going to do about the #RussianAssetInTheWhiteHouse ?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Shut up you insufferable #Traitor 	This #TrumpShutdown2019 is your fault. Stop playing #Conservative bukakki and get your #tinyhands on some on some useful legislation. Prove you're not a #RussianAsset
@SpeakerPelosi keep up your good work. Do you believe @realDonaldTrump is a #RussianAsset ? He certainly is acting like one. He is single handedly shutting down a branch of the military #USCG how is any of this okay?
@VP I am not a fan of yours, but youd be a better president than your boss.I mean he's a literal traitor. What's it going to take for you to invoke the 25th amendment? It would probably faster then him asking you for a pardon and resigning #RussianAssets #TrumpShutdown #Impeach45
@maddow if @realDonaldTrump is an agent of Russia, he's doing a good job sewing chaos. Our government is in the midst of a shut down, hell, a whole branch of the military isn't getting paid #USCG #RussianAsset #TrumpShutdown2019 #Russia #Traitor #TrumpShutdown #Trump #TrumpRussia
@artiequitter Do you have a sponsor?
@SamHarrisOrg @jack Sam, isn't this normal by now? You only get protection is you're the "right kind" of #Liberal 		@jordanbpeterson have any thoughts on this?
@JoeBiden please announce your run for 2020. Democrats need a real leader right now. We are literally desperate and #TeamPelosi is not the exact answer. #Democrat #Dems #Biden
@pattonoswalt @birbigs Are you going to be in Colorado anytime soon?
@JoelOsteen Prove it. #GodFriendedMe #FakeNews
@thekapman The hell is he thinking? #Bears
@comicsexplained I saw in one of your videos that you moved to Colorado.  I also just moved to the northern part of the state from New Mexico. How are you liking it?
@sairasameerarao @FrancislJung @sairasameerarao isn't your generalization of white people blatantly racist? You know that there are conservatives out there of all races, right. Maybe read a book once.
@gage_limbach Are there actually gay Republicans?
@EricRWeinstein Yall blew my mind. Head still hurts a bit from the #physics
Yet more #Packers getting more #bullshitcall ... #GoPackGo
@packers sorry for these refs, guys #bullshitcall #TNFonFOX from a #SteelersNation guy here.
My brain is spinning @jk_rowling #ProtectTheSecrets can you please give us the title of the next movie so we can speculate for another 2 years?
