@RealJacobPerry It's despicable! Criminal Justice reform, prison reform and reducing recidivism rates should be a number one priority. You're right, it's currently a system set up to benefit the wealthy, primarily white, criminals.

@RealJacobPerry Now that's cool! I was touched by the bio and was happy to know more about James Garfield the man. And his circle of influence was amazing! It's sad his life was cut short by medical malpractice. It would have seemed he had great potential. But it is a presidential bio after all.
@RealJacobPerry Definitely one of my favorite historical bios.
@RealJacobPerry have you read the Garfield bio ‚ÄúDestiny of the Republic‚Äù? If not, read it. It‚Äôs an amazing book. It was quite moving in parts as well. Really well done.

@RealJacobPerry I disagree, but I think that depends on perspective. I don't think it's great (avg down, k's up), but (some) players are able to reinvent their careers and, in some cases, prolong them.
@RealJacobPerry Launch angle has saved some careers.
@RealJacobPerry LOL!!! Just looked. It was 178. So yeah, a bit of a free swinger.
@RealJacobPerry I think they were saying that stats-wise they are similar though Taylor tends to be a bit more of a free swinger than Pollack.
@RealJacobPerry Don't they already have a similar player in Chris Taylor? I think that's what MLB Network was saying the other night when discussing a possible Pollack signing.

@RaySteeleRTV6 Didn‚Äôt realize the AB differential was that big. 11 seasons w/ a .400 OBP is ridiculous. Contextually McGriff doesn‚Äôt have ‚ÄúEdgar numbers‚Äù.

@chefbrink Truth
@chefbrink Wow, the Marlins make us look like we could have been World Series contenders.
@chefbrink I guess I'm unfit to be president now.
@chefbrink Yeah, we were pretty ruthless I guess. Pretty cocky for a JV team that won only 2 or 3 games #NoDefense #OrOffenseForThatMatter
@chefbrink He totally had the mullet &amp; the facial hair. That was also the year of Kruk's "surgery" so we bugged him from the bench re: that
@chefbrink Oddly, that same game, my curve had such a wicked break on lefties.  Now my arm is so shot it hurts when the weather changes.
@chefbrink Yep! Funny though, once in a JV game almost got into a bench clearing brawl w/a kid who looked like John Kruk. Lots of Ks &amp; HBBs
@chefbrink Lots of walks too, but I put the fear of God into batters. Always got a rush off of that. Not gonna lie. #NotAHeadHunter #Promise
@chefbrink I was a classic power pitcher w/deceptive movement on my fastball &amp; a nasty curve when I had control. I also hit lots of batters.
LOL! MT @andrewluckshead: In the history of football there has in fact been a triple play. The run, the butt and the fumble by Mark Sanchez.
@chefbrink When I played baseball, I was the picture of why a pitcher should never hit.  #0ForVarsity
@chefbrink In baseball, automatic outs are awesome.  :P
@chefbrink Going to an inferior league helps.
@ohconservatism LOL!!  It's on kid.  #AlreadyLookingForwardToOctober
