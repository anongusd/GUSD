@SecretaryPerry @realDonaldTrump Pass revenue neutral, taxable, direct pay bonds and lower the costs of developing clean energy infrastructure throughout the country.  #AmericanInfrastructureBonds
Somehow, leadership in Congress and the Administration has to fix the problem caused by bad trade decisions made the pst 2 years. Our agribusiness industry has been badly hurt. https://t.co/o4nPYQ9hGV
Seems like unilateral disarmament.  What do you think?   Which states win and which lose if incentives are prohibited? https://t.co/XdeFK8GksR
@JoeNBC With decades of experience interacting with members’ offices, this one overriding truth - you better get the constituent service right first. If not, you will not have a chance at anything else. A veteran’s check trumps overall veteran health policy.
@SteveSchmidtSES where have you been?  Miss your insight on air ....
@JoeNBC Still tear up seeing this clip. We needed this moment so badly for our country.  Still believe in miracles.

@jahimes American Infrastructure Bonds  - revenue neutral, taxable, and direct pay financing for state and local governments.  @RepTerriSewell
American Infrastructure Bonds will make Rebuilding our country less expensive.
@RepRichardNeal @WaysMeansCmte American Infrastructure Bonds. Revenue Neutral, direct pay, taxable bonds for local and state governments.  Like Build America Bonds, but better.  @RepTerriSewell @RepKenMarchant @RepAdrianSmith
@SenatorTimScott Well done, Senator.  Obviously a great staff. Enjoy your new office.

We have to find ways to help our citizens in rural America - the government shutdown isn’t one of them. https://t.co/0PYprkbBQQ
@SteveScalise @PortNOLA Thank you, Congressman. Passage of legislation to create revenue-neutral American Infrastructure Bonds would help local and state governments to improve and expand infrastructure - like this project - at lower costs.  Ways &amp; Means staff has the information.

@SecretarySonny Mr Secretary, what should school systems do to prepare for a shutdown that extends beyond the quarter?  How to best advise ways to help all students?  Thanks.
For friends traveling by air during the government shutdown, please plan an extra several hours for security clearance.  Two hour waits are increasingly the norm right now.  @gbharris2485 https://t.co/0grJwMIIat

@JoyceWhiteVance A bipartisan, VETO-PROOF, vote.
@DougJones Senator, thank you for championing this legislation. Hope it may help bring some justice, peace, and finality to those unsolved cases still haunting families.  Well done.

This is an interesting development, and maybe opportunity, for investment into the Chinese market.  Cautious and complete due diligence - and quality local partnerships - is still advisable. #uschinapartnership https://t.co/m7G0bFqLg0
America is changing in many ways.  The dynamic mixture of urban and rural opportunities is one such way. How we respond with educational opportunities and work force re-development will dictate the face of America in the next generation. https://t.co/040UAfvkmb
This is a significant observation about state legislative power. With single party rule in most state legislatures, there is less incentive to re-draw districts post-census in any manner except to the partisan advantage of the incumbent party. https://t.co/4J50CxmQpF
@AliVelshi thank you for pointing out those companies taking steps to help Americans during the government shutdown. I hope those companies will encourage Congress and the President to end the shutdown while they work on the security issue. The workers are blameless victims.
Word tonight is that in addition to @CoryGardner and @SenatorCollins , @lisamurkowski has publicly called for ending the shut down by passing the Republican spending bill passed by the House last week.  Look for others to join them to end the shutdown w/o resolution on a wall.
Delays in tax refunds could negatively impact the economy. Look for the House to pass individual spending bills for the Treasury and other agencies next week - a belts and suspenders approach - designed to entice the Senate to re-open even portions of the government. https://t.co/WSwiWUjpcI
@SenThomTillis Thank you, Senator.  Great to see a state's delegation come together to help all its citizens.
@RepRichardNeal @WaysMeansCmte @RepTerriSewell Revenue neutral American Infrastructure Bonds will help every public body in the US.  Great kick start for infrastructure financing.
President Trump has been invited to address a joint session of Congress on January 29 to deliver his report on the state of the Union.
@DavidJollyFL @JustMoi32 @realDonaldTrump There is proposed “revenue neutral” legislation for a new type of direct pay bond that would lower costs to finance infrastructure by public entities - American Infrastructure Bonds. Could give some paygo relief.  Hope to see this in the 116th Congress.
The issue is serious, and should be. But now the mere threat of adding a claim to destroy the ability to maintain confidential agreements will impact litigation in California.  Companies with business in CA may want to review existing employment agreements. https://t.co/kWkIGLoPx1
@thehill Building personal relationships across partisan lines would pivot focus to problem solving instead of vilifying opposing parties.  Politically risky with both parties’ extremes. Need an outside group to intervene to teach ways to function. E.g., @ThePacificInst

This is the real danger created by attempting to use “trade wars” as an offensive tactic. An entire industry damaged, perhaps irretrievably.  A lot of Americans have already been hurt, including here in Alabama. https://t.co/EhWYsxOlqR

@RepLauraHallD19 @CBSMoneyWatch Thank you Representative Hall.  This is serious challenge is getting worse.  Recent federal tax law changes were passed at the cost of Trillion Dollar deficits. Tax reductions were used for stock buy backs or other uses besides employee wages.  A reckoning coming for all of us.

This issue will remain a top headline for some time, likely until August recess.  Look for demonstrations in August at congressional town hall meetings demanding Congress do something to rein in POTUS.  At a minimum, regular order issues - appropriations, etc. - will be effected. https://t.co/AtvYkKClLS
@OrrinHatch thank you.  This is more critical today than even yesterday.  Congress must actively oversee actions by POTUS that are misguided by incomprehensible loyalty to America's adversaries, and perhaps himself. #tariffs https://t.co/WRycManhbW
Another reason that greater election security is critical, &amp; we are behind for the coming elections.  State control of election process is important and helpful (no centralized site to hack).  But tough national standards are needed, and funding for implementation. #JohnHMerrill https://t.co/4zyhqKDGlB
This is a start.  Congress has to engage, forcefully, to protect our sovereignty &amp; security.  At a minimum, protections for the Special Counsel, control over trade decisions (tariffs), and active oversight of other international matters is critical. @McConnellPress #SenMajLdr https://t.co/lBIC36yCKC
Homelessness affects or has affected every community and likely someone you know. The costs of homelessness to our society are higher than the costs of providing solutions.  #homelessness https://t.co/iFbYhHKQlQ
