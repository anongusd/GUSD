Trump's "zero tolerance policy" has resulted in the inhumane and barbaric practice of snatching immigrant children away from their families,and new documents show that over the past five years, close to 5,000 kids have reported being victims of sexual abuse. Shame!

These things do not cause the wage gap: industry, education level, job choice. These things do: discrimination and bias. #NativeWomensEqualPay https://t.co/nXXKRdjMep
Reality check: The wage gap cannot be explained away by choices and is especially harmful to women of color. Closing the wage gap is integral to improving the health, well-being and economic security of women and families. #NativeWomensEqualPay #DemandMore https://t.co/nXXKRdjMep https://t.co/ZiNCAhRUcL
Native women make 58 cents on the dollar. Help #DemandMore  — register to vote, and support #equity based legislation to promote #NativeWomensEqualPay. #MyVoiceMyVote #NationalVoterRegistrationDay
Food sovereignty for Native people means that they control their own food &amp; economies instead of relying on food grown many miles away by corporations. Reclamation of traditional food practices will reduce carbon footprints &amp; promote #NativeWomensEqualPay. https://t.co/FFENZaOxoz

4 in 5 Native women experience violence in their lifetime — 70% of which is committed by non-Natives. Only with #equity solutions can we end systemic violence against Native women and girls. #NativeWomensEqualPay
#NativeWomensEqualPay is needed for transwomen &amp; two-spirit people -- a term indigenous LGBT communities have reclaimed in order to honor their heritage. "In 2008, 23% of two-spirit &amp;/or transgender people were living in extreme poverty." @SeahdomEdmo https://t.co/fGsMOOhdsa

Doctor? Cashier? Waitress? Engineer? It doesn’t matter – the #WageGap persists across occupations for Native women &amp; actually widens with higher educational attainment. #NativeWomensEqualPay
Facts: 	-Native women make 58 cents on the dollar.		-More than 4/5 Native women experience violence in their lifetime.		-Native women have the highest poverty rate — 28.1%.		-1/3 of Native women lack healthcare coverage.		TRUTH: Native women are resilient. #NativeWomensEqualPay https://t.co/Olh9uKiktF
If the wage gap were closed, a Native American woman would have enough money for: 		🏡24 months of rent. 		💖20 years of birth control. 		⚕️18 months of health insurance premiums. 		🍎170 weeks of food. 		#NativeWomensEqualPay
If the wage gap closed, a Native American woman would have enough money for approximately more than 1.5 years of tuition and fees for a 4 year public university or the full cost of tuition for a 2 year community college. #NativeWomensEqualPay #DemandMore https://t.co/YXIGFwnzTE https://t.co/6NdRbVADw6

We insist that the diversity of AAPI communities be included and made visible in pay equity research, advocacy, and policy efforts. #AAPIEqualPay #SEAEqualPay https://t.co/SOVsZB0mI9
46% of AAPI immigrant women participate in the labor force and they need #AAPIEqualPay. #NotYourModelMinority #SEAEqualPay
Significant socioeconomic disparities remain to this day -- in part due to the #ModelMinorityMyth, which often renders invisible the issues that Southeast Asian Americans face. Without equal pay, many in these communities will continue to struggle. #SEAEqualPay #AAPIEqualPay https://t.co/hPdWWcfS9O
The #UnionDifference is clear: #AAPI women in unions earn approximately $2.00 more per hour than their non-union counterparts in the same types of jobs. #AAPIEqualPay #SEAEqualPay
How can we close the pay gap? Unionize! Union women earn $231 more than women without a union voice. #AAPIEqualPay #AAPI #SEAEqualPay https://t.co/5gAeoO7mKY
AAPI women comprise 2.4% of the American workforce, but 4.4% of the low-wage workforce. They need #AAPIEqualPay and are #NotYourModelMinority #SEAEqualPay

Since 1975, over a million people arrived to our country as war refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The majority had experienced trauma and arrived impoverished, which depressed their wages and created barriers to career advancement. #SEAEqualPay #AAPIEqualPay
The #ModelMinorityMyth isn’t an accurate representation of life for many #AAPIs. For instance, 18% and 27% of Cambodian and Hmong families live in poverty, respectively -- yet we rarely hear about their stories and experiences. #CloseTheGap #SEAEqualPay #AAPIEqualPay https://t.co/xWl6DVgHQT
#AAPI women make, on average, 85 cents to the white male dollar. But disaggregated data shows that average wages can vary significantly by subgroup. In order to uplift our lived experiences, we need to recognize the diversity within our community. #SEAEqualPay #AAPIEqualPay

#Fairpay is central to economic justice. Economic justice is central to #reprojustice. We must end wage discrimination. #BlackWomensEqualPay #DemandMore
We all suffer as a result of the wage gap. LCLAA stands with your coworkers, friends, neighbors, and family and #DemandMore on #BlackWomensEqualPay Day. https://t.co/7xXoTHF99Q
Black &amp; Latina #LGBTQ women are more likely to be living in poverty &amp; raising kids than their white counterparts. #BlackWomensEqualPay #DemandMore
If there were no #wagegap, a Black woman would have enough money for 22 more	months of rent. https://t.co/ssLImnUDqP #BlackWomensEqualPay #DemandMore https://t.co/p3x4zBALis
People with disabilities experience a #wagegap on top of ableism. Men w/ disabilities are paid 76¢. Women w/ disabilities working full time, year round are typically paid just 73¢ for every $1 that abled bodied men are paid. https://t.co/UVC7Yv6XlL	#BlackWomensEqualPay
Black women must work an additional 8 months to make what white, non-hispanic men make in 12. Let's #DemandMore of ourselves and our elected officials. Close the wage gap! #BlackWomensEqualPay https://t.co/UIvuRvs5nu
Black #Transgender moms need #EqualPay! The transgender nonconforming community experiences poverty @ 4X the rate of general pop. #BlackWomensEqualPay	#DemandMore
Black women working full time, year-round are typically paid only 63 cents for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic men counterparts. #BlackWomensEqualPay	#DemandMore https://t.co/UQeq9r1fEf
#BlackWomensEqualPay doesn’t just represent a gap in pay. It represents a lack of justice. It is time for laws—like the #PaycheckFairness Act and #SalaryHistory bans—that will help secure #EqualPay for equal work!
August 7 is #BlackWomensEqualPay Day, the day Black women's pay catches up with white, non-hispanic men's pay from the previous year. It is time for a change.	#DemandMore #EqualPay https://t.co/E8Wt5Ffs3r
Kavanaugh has sided against workers time and time again making it even harder to workers of color, especially Black women to #DemandMore and get #BlackWomensEqualPay. https://t.co/7agtcSeOpV

Being black + being a woman = a double hit to your paycheck. The #WageGap is an intersectional issue. To achieve #BlackWomensEqualPay, we must address both racial and gender disparities. It’s time to #DemandMore. https://t.co/OZWvEA94Q2

REMINDER: #Paygap is wider for women of color-- We need to move forward on #equalpay for all women: https://t.co/xChUZzC6eT #EqualPayAct
Pay inequity harms women, and the families and children that rely on their income. Tell your members of Congress to support women, families, and all Americans by passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct.
The #EqualPayAct was signed into law on June 10, 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. 55 years later we are still fighting for #EqualPay. Let's get this done! Support the #PaycheckFairnessAct. https://t.co/pdtsFcAohY

SCOTUS ruled in favor of anti-gay baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. LGBT Nation contends that “Today’s ruling chips aways at one of America’s most basic values.. the freedom to expect that a business will serve all customers without discrimination.”
Join us at the White House tomorrow as we call on our nation’s leaders to: respect the basic human dignity of immigrants, give permanent residence for recipients of TPS and DACA, halt deportations and keep all immigrant families intact, and more.  https://t.co/FkxFQMyLqc

On #MomsEqualPay, let's remember that incarcerated moms are cherished family members &amp; friends whose absence &amp; presence counts. The damage of incarceration lasts long after release &amp; its stigma prevents moms from getting #equalpay &amp; fair treatment at work.
Las madres en EE.UU hacen 71 centavos por cada dólar que los padres hacen. No estamos enojados, estamos decepcionados. #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/RddigVjFGc
"Men’s longer work hours are subsidized &amp; facilitated by unpaid labor done by women, contributing to the gender #paygap." We're talking about childcare, meal prep, housecleaning, school pickup/dropoffs, family calendar management &amp; MORE #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/mgyUQnTiGo
It's 2018 and women still experience pregnancy discrimination at work. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would help promote healthy pregnancies and protect the economic security of pregnant women and their families. #PWFA #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/SMnwnVtsq5
Racism and sexism make economic security twice as challenging for women of color to reach. #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/GTRIis3934
Las personas con discapacidades experimentan una #brechasalarial a parte de discriminación. "Las mujeres con discapacidades que trabajan a tiempo completo todo el año reciben 73¢ por cada $1 que se le paga a un hombre sin discapacidades. https://t.co/UVC7Yvoydj #MomsEqualPay
Immigrant moms only make 67¢ to a white dad’s dollar and their ability to work is increasingly threatened by regressive immigration policies. Protecting the legal status of immigrant women is an imp. step toward #MomsEqualPay #DACA #TPS #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/E9xVks6FMF
Why #MomsEqualPay is a criminal &amp; racial justice issue: "Economically disadvantaged Black women have fewer resources to make bail, causing them to wind up behind bars for far too long, even for crimes they’ve only been charged with &amp; often are not found guilty of." @monifabandele
70% of mothers with children under 18 are in the paid labor force, you bet unions matter to moms!! Greater equity, BETTER PAY, #paidsickdays, #paidleave, employer-sponsored health-care and retirement security. #Momsequalpay #UnionMom https://t.co/eyOoaFra8K

@vannessitav @farrellERA BUT this does not give the full picture of the wage gap that exists for people working part time #LatinaEqualPay
@vannessitav @farrellERA Ratio between male &amp; female median earnings for the employees working full time year round- the gap is the difference in the wages
.@vannessitav asks @farrellERA: How is the wage gap calculated?
Our data is limited and doesn't tell us what's happening by the industry in ways that are meaningful @FGossGraves #LatinaEqualPay
Contributing factor to pay gap: Women make up 2/3 of min wage workforce and the minimum wage is really too low @farrellERA
