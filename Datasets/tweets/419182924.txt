@nate45jayjay @foxandfriends So, the bourgeoisie, or multinational businesses, billionaires and governments conspire  to effect trade and the wealth fare of countries and its people.

@nate45jayjay @foxandfriends What I’m trying to say is nationalism can lead to tyranny when unchecked. When the people become complacent with leadership because they think that the leaders are just doing what’s best for the country and don’t question their motives, or have unquestioned devotion.

@BeardedLegend23 @chessiebay @foxandfriends Nationalism was not the cause of of WW1 but it was a contributing factor.
@BeardedLegend23 @chessiebay @foxandfriends Look nationalism isn’t always a bad thing. But when it leads to the, undying devotion to a leader and praise of war and/or the degradation of human rights, then it needs to kept in check.
