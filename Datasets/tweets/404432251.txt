BOB STOVALL: Polis needs to respect rural voters https://t.co/55Pz0RLOms via @ChieftainNews
Club 20 to Polis: No surrogate allowed at debate https://t.co/WoWAGoLbmH via @DailySentinelGJ
@CRobertBuchanan @cleartransition @WalkerStapleton Gunnison County is STILL a C20 member. In fact, our previous Board Chair is a Gunnison County Commissioner. Less than 3% of our total membership revenue comes from the oil and gas industry, the majority of it comes from small business owners. #FACT CHECK #copolitics
C20 is proud to be the non-partisan voice for Western Colorado. In our world, #ColoradoDay is every day.
@JoeStGeorge @PolisForCO @PolisForCO C20 has had our debate dates set for more than a year. We appreciate that Mr. Polis is a member of Congress but so are other participants in our debates and they're attending.  EVERY gubernatorial candidate has participated in C20 debates. # FACT CHECK #copolitics
@PolisForCO says they won't participate in C20 debates b/c they already committed to DS/CMU debate which has NO DATE SET. C20 debate dates have been set for &gt; 1 yr. Hopefully @PolisForCO sees value in mtg w/ citizens of WCO, not just Mesa Cty, &amp; decides 2 participate  #copolitics
After doing some research, C20 has been hosting these debates for more than 30 years and has never had a Gubernatorial Candidate decline to participate. This is a shocking and disappointing first for our 65 year old organization! #copolitics
@etbreck @PolisForCO Thank you Emily! We do hope he reconsiders and if he does we will gladly and openly welcome his participation. We are the "Voice of Western Colorado" and should be heard by all candidates looking to represent our interests.
https://t.co/GEpcD6EexF
Club 20 hopes that Candidate Polis will reconsider his position on this debate and honor the citizens of the Western Slope by attending and discussing the issues impacting Western Colorado on Saturday September 8th. #copolitics
The 22 counties that make up the Club 20 region host two US Congressional seats, eight Colorado House Districts, four Colorado Senate Districts, and more than 580,000 Colorado citizens. #copolitics
“No gubernatorial candidate has skipped this debate in recent memory and it is a slap in the face to all of Western Colorado" said Christian Reece of C20.  #copolitics
Gubernatorial Candidate Jared Polis has declined to participate in the C20 Candidate Debates.“It is a shame that Candidate Polis is unwilling to participate in a non-partisan forum where our voices can be heard,” said Christian Reece, Executive Director. #copolitics
