Still waiting to see what high profile conservative(s) called for Molly JF to be fired? I mean I heard it was a lot but, you know, no evidence abd stuff.
@ian_mckelvey He's too far gone now. Can't get through to him.
You'd think that because I didn't vote for Trump, the people who treat me the worst are those who did vote for him. The reality is the Never Trumpers who turned the movement into a cult treat me the worst: with either contempt or indifference.  That's the truth.

Newsflash for Judd and the DCCC: Dowless is on the hot seat because of what he did, but the Bladen Dem PAC will have to face the music, too. It's out on the open now. Dems can't hide it anymore. And that's a good thing, bc we need to eliminate ALL fraud, right? #ncpol #nc09
For Legum -who DELIBERATELY left out of his reporting the Dem ABM fraud going on in Bladen-  to insinuate a well-respected local journalist here is one-sided is LAUGHABLE. Nick actually reported on BOTH sides doing it. Judd only reported ONE side.  WHO IS THE HACK? #ncpol #nc09
That's what happens here in this state. Democrats here are so used to the media friendlies in the Raleigh journo bubble (I've got stories!), that when journalists *outside* of that bubble actually dare to report on their wrongdoing, they must be targeted and shamed. #ncpol #nc09
Nick &amp; another local journo (Bruno) brought the Dem Bladen County Improvement Assoc. PAC's #Nc09 ABM fraud to light in the midst of their reporting about Dowless. They did what actual investigative journos do in digging for the whole story. Judd &amp; the DCCC don't like that.#ncpol
Let's get this out in the open: @JuddLegum is a shameless partisan hack. During his "in-depth" #nc09 reporting (praised by NC Dems &amp; left-leaning political analysts), he repeatedly ignored instances brought to his attn of Democrats credibly accused of what Dowless was. #ncpol
So the @dccc @JuddLegum are teaming up to attack @NickOchsnerWBTV's #nc09 reporting &amp; his well-earned rep as someone who takes on all sides. I know what this is really about. Nick happened to also report on DEMOCRAT ABM shenanigans in Bladen. And we just can't have that. #ncpol
