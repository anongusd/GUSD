The US must be prepared to do what is necessary to destroy #ISIL. Making them a 'manageable problem' is unacceptable.

We're weary of war, but threats remain. POTUS must acknowledge terrorist threats we face &amp; put policies in place to effectively counter them
Whether it's Iraq, Afghanistan, or other parts of the Middle East Americans have fought &amp; died in the war against al-Qa’ida.
Al-Qa’ida is one of biggest threats to U.S. They're plotting against us &amp; seeking new recruits, esp among our citizens &amp; GITMO detainees
Intel community makes mistakes, but these events, including resurgence of ISIL, aren't intel failures; they're policy &amp; leadership failures
I've been shocked to hear some refer to recent events in the Middle East, including the rise of ISIL in Iraq, as intelligence failures
relying on an ineffective diplomatic strategy that involves few concrete security measures.
The Obama admin has chosen to confront this challenge, which has major implications for U.S. national security, by “leading from behind”
The Middle East over the last three years has been besieged by a resurgence of instability, violence and terrorism.

Read my opening statement at the 2013 #farmbill conference in full here: http://t.co/9KHjYSo6Jw
The reason we're here is to represent those who work the land each day to provide the highest quality agricultural products in the world.
It is vitally important to the farmers &amp; ranchers of Georgia that we uphold the strength of the safety net American agriculture depends on.
I'm confident we can balance the needs and interests between commodities and regions to reach common goal of finishing this #farmbill
Both bills before us attempt to provide producers with options to find what works best for them, and that is a step in the right direction.
While there are different ideas about what safety net is best, I urge my friends to recognize that one program doesn’t work for all crops
With biggest issue facing our country being our debt &amp; deficit, I commend Ag Committees for stepping up and  finding savings in #farmbill
Both bills before us embody reform, streamlining, and consolidation #farmbill

Watch my interview on ABC's #ThisWeek discussing #NSA surveillance and #Egypt here: http://t.co/v55wLYNM9V
To do so would be nothing short of an invitation for Al Qaeda to continue to attack us.
One former detainee was involved in #Benghazi attacks, we can't afford to take that risk w other detainees just to satisfy political promise
w recidivism rate at 28%, no detainee should be transferred unless we're confident he will be monitored and can't renew terrorist ties.
Sending them to countries where Al Qaeda and its affiliates operate and continue to attack our interests is not a solution
People across America are very concerned that WH still has no plan for these hard-core terrorists if efforts to close Gitmo are successful.

Obama will not go forward with #KeystoneXL if it increases greenhouse gases – destroying over 20,000 jobs.
Not sold. President's #climate plan will create a job-crushing national energy tax rather than the pro-growth policies we need.
Until those concerns are addressed I cannot support limiting debate
Including border security, interior enforcement, and the program designed to address our ag labor workforce,
Not rushing to finish the bill before Sen. Reid's artificial deadline. I have serious concerns with several provisions in the bill,
We all know our immigration system is broken and we need to fix it. However, we should be having a full and open debate on solutions
