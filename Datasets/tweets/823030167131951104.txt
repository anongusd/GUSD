@jeffmason1 @Acosta @realDonaldTrump The armed civilian or armed guard comment this morning was 100% on point. I would think everyone would agree. I’m surprised there wasn’t a concealed weapon in the group. Maybe we should have armed guards everywhere there’s large groups. Including every school.  Anyone disagree???
@msmadscientist7 @JamesKosur @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump If u care. You must just scroll through my FB. MY BEST friend was black. He killed himself in 11.  I have tons of black employees and friends. Cmon?? Y r u saying this?  Your silly.

I’m sure the liberals will tear him apart for this one.  The country loved hearing him in this outstanding interview. Outstanding comments!! https://t.co/tXIZBDbbuZ
@CNN @MSNBC cannot report his success and accomplishments all they can do is say bad things it’s a very sad day for journalism. Frankly it’s not journalism it’s like watching the View, opinion hacks. And then when he has a big win they delegitimize. I guess to feel better?? https://t.co/nahMesE4wO

He’ll go down as the greatest 2 term president.
@Health4AllAmer 48-year-old that lives in one of the most liberal states in the country Oregon I’m a very proud Trump supporter and I think the bias news and the attacks and negative press on the president is wrong. Republicans will win the midterms and Trump will serve as successful second term
