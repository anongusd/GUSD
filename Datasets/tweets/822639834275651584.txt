Looking for businesses to open up to homeless during the next two days of torrential downpours. Please, retweet this post to encourage businesses to open for shelter!
Generalizing greater stats, females account for half the workforce, there are more females than males in Kokomo, and they own about half as many small businesses as males. Add gender roles and it becomes increasingly more difficult to understand the discrimination below. https://t.co/pSTqIe5f8U
From the US Census. What's important to note is 20% live in poverty, at 24,000 a year a majority of Kokomo is just one bad away from homelessness. It's time for those in power to wake up to the reality we live. https://t.co/cKxbTtrAJg
@SWhikehart @CoryBooker Please, share some of the awesome  wisdom he shared?
Muncie does this for homeless and has done much to eliminate people living outside, if elected I will push for a similar program.		https://t.co/h536H25u8U
What temperature, specifically, does it have to reach for it to be acceptable for adults and children to live outside?
What is most needed right now is hot food for people in the shelters and warning centers. I have received several messages in the past 24 hours, if you want to help please take food to places like CAM. Specifically, this morning. Thank you so much to all of those who have helped!

@r_a_salvatore Reading comics and Mad Magazine as a kid is why I love to read today, which inspired a lifetime and love of learning, and in turn, defined my love for humanity.
@r_a_salvatore Just read the excerpt, awesome stuff, you never fail to please!
Some photos of a homeless camp I found yesterday during the Point In Time count. People are living in the woods, definite signs of recent habitation. It appears they haven't been here in a few days. https://t.co/ktKmq7FUQl
People showing empathy for the federal workers now forced to use food pantries. I never wish suffering on anybody, but my heart also goes out to the working families who have been there maybe their 100th or 200th time and still have no hope for the future. #444

Abbie Smith is president of the Howard Co United Way, the United Way is the largest nonprofit in the US, in 2017 they took in 3.9 billion. Abbie Smith could have solved homelessness in Howard County but chose not to. #444
The military gender ban is a unique form of  institutionalized hatred because it discriminates against our armed forces.
Symbols are powerful. Taken in or out of context they carry the same meaning. The symbol on the left will always represent peace, where the red hat never will. Let's not kid ourselves on this most memorable day. @r_a_salvatore https://t.co/UKC2MlDDEJ

How does seeing and/or experiencing homelessness make you feel?
Fact: in Kokomo, Indiana there is not a single place someone living on the  streets can get breakfast. Including children.
This is a shelter someone was inhabiting during cold weather. People that talked to the man said he claimed to be a vet. No one was there during this shoot and we will monitor the situation. https://t.co/h6ZvAfy5yF
Anyone who touches their money twice pays for it. If elected I will propose legislation that earmarks for social programs, a percent of any money that is shifted off budget to promote initiatives like apartments. Everyone needs a home #444
Filmed today. People who allow suffering lack empathy. https://t.co/3p0FVzptR8
Instead of tearing down these old homes, we need to be teaching people skills and building them back up for the people who don't have homes.

Under the stairs in the city parking garage, Downtown Kokomo is where people who are forced to sleep outside could find shelter in the winter when we have 8 in of snow, now it's been barred off, kind of symbolic? https://t.co/Yf2MToeokb
"Howard County had 444 public school students identified as homeless in 2016, the seventh-highest total of Indiana’s 92 counties, according to the Indiana Youth Institute’s most recent Kids Count data book." Kokomo Tribune
We need to stop evicting people and families who receive help from places like homeless shelters. Don't kick them out! Cultural beliefs in the form of oppression, a carrort in front of the cart have no place, either.

Where is the empathy in our city leadership? #444 homeless children in Howard County, Kokomo, Indiana.
Kokomo democrats need to focus on the social agenda they so readily claim. Time to focus on suffering. #444

The cultural bias that distorts how the United Way vets it's 3.9 billion is similar to the backward "White Father" paradigm. In Kokomo, powerfully dominate caucasians, culturally European, vetting not even enough cultural capital to end suffering. #wonderwoman @AbLivesUnited
United Way collected 3.9 billion in 2017, yet 2.5 million children are homeless in the US. #444 in Howard Co alone. When do you plan to fix this @unitedwayhoco @AbLivesUnited
