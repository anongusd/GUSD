The 2 most commonly used moving averages are the simple moving avg (#SMA) &amp; the exponential moving average(#EMA)-SMA is the simple avg of a security over a defined number of time periods-EMA gives greater weight to more recent prices #TechnicalAnalysis #Stock
A widely used indicator in technical analysis is the moving average. It is a lagging indicator bc it's based on past prices, but it helps to smooth out the price action bc it filters out random price fluctuations #stocks #markets #TechnicalAnalysis
