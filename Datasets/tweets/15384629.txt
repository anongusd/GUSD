@NikeSupport yup! Because it kept syncing afterwards just didn‚Äôt record the session. Found the session online instead

@amradelamin gotcha, the fitbit w/ BT 4.0 would intermittently connect and update in background - just figuring it out!
@amradelamin probably not I was just wondering if the SE is supposed to be connected to BT 100% of time instead of only when app is open
@amradelamin hey man quick question, do you have the new fuelband se?
@joshuaglenn thanks Josh!
@NikeSupport did a factory reset &amp; it‚Äôs good but still a persistent BT connection unless I kill the app - maybe a bug?
@NikeSupport there‚Äôs a persistent BT connection and the app is slow to load activity - also didn‚Äôt reset to zero after midnight
@NikeSupport Just un/reinstalled app and restarted phone - still nothing :(
@NikeSupport the band started working after I plugged it into my computer but now I have to kill the app to stop BT
@NikeSupport yes, last night my fuelband stopped working/syncing also didn‚Äôt restart to zero - now it keeps BT on all the time
@NikeSupport Should the BT symbol always be activated w/ #fuelbandse - I thought it was BLE? Also it just started doing this today
