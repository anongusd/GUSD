@brianneDMR I disagree. None of those three should run. Two already had their chance and one is too inexperienced. I do not know a single person waiting on one of those three. Have you been to the rallies of the announced candidates? I didn't hear anyone pinning for one on your list.

@JohnsonCountyIA Special Election for Supervisor will be on Dec 18. As the last person appointed to fill a seat, I believe that with 2 yrs left in a term, an election was the best way to go. People deserve the right to vote on their elected representatives, certainly for 2 yrs.

@LoneTreeFox Yes, but a chosen one would receive a gift of money &amp; a year of salary would be wasted on someone that won't run for the seat
@LoneTreeFox That's not actually true John &amp; Mike have both worked hard to learn, attending schools, working w staff, studying It takes work
@LoneTreeFox They can learn on the job, but it takes 1-2 years so wasting a year on a seat filler is really wasting that $. We are managers
@LoneTreeFox I'm always 4 letting people vote &amp; more options in voting, but in this case paying a seat filler for 1 year is a lot more money
@LoneTreeFox You might not know what we do day to day &amp; how much knowledge, research and background it takes. We manage a lot of people &amp; $
@LoneTreeFox With effecient satellites it will probably cost $35-40k for an election and people get to vote on their government.
@LoneTreeFox I studied government for 20 years, went to schools and conferences &amp; bothered staff for about two years with a lot of questions
@LoneTreeFox elections could be done more cheaply, but it would further disenfranchise voters.
@LoneTreeFox Would serve from Jan 20 to Jan 1 &amp; receive the same salary/benefits as anyone else, plus a year of education/training wasted
@LoneTreeFox About $80,000 in salary/benefits wasted on someone that won't run, let alone time training and educating
@LoneTreeFox Sounds like you think people voting on who represents them is a bad thing BTW, seat filler actually costs more than an election
As the last person appointed to fill a year long @JohnsonCountyIA Sup seat, I support a special election so people can have a vote.

Great positive closing @MartinOMalley  #DemDebate
@JimWebbUSA joking about killing a man. #NotCool #DemDebate
@CNN @andersoncooper the only woman has to ask paid leave, black reporter asks #BlackLivesMatter, Latino asks immigration #Lame #DemDebate
@HillaryClinton that China story is boring for #DemDebate We need red meat and policy positions to decide on our candidate
I hope a President @HillaryClinton will finally get bathroom parity for us based on the time it takes both genders. #DemDebate
@DavidRedlawsk Maybe, but recall how the Clinton's chose their last running mate. They double downed.
I'm for medical marijuana and legalization, but @andersoncooper that doesn't mean we all have gotten high. #controlfreak  #DemDebate
I think @MartinOMalley just hand delivered his resume for Vice President. Smart, thoughtful, kind, but not catching fire. #DemDebate
@HillaryClinton needs to close strong here, as she owned it early #DemDebate
@CNN black guy asks #BlackLivesMatter question and Latino asks immigration question #Lame @andersoncooper #DemDebate
RT @iowademocrats: RT if you agree with all the Democrats on stage -- we need comprehensive immigration reform. #DemDebate
@BernieSanders voted against immigration reform in 07 He thinks it is OK cause #TomHarkin did it too Harkin also voted 4 DOMA #DemDebate
"I just arrived to Senate &amp; my Dad had died..." So I should get a pass for voting wrong and not reading the bill. @LincolnChafee #DemDebate
@andersoncooper to @JimWebbUSA "You agreed to the rules and you are wasting time." Webb is certainly wasting my time #DemDebate

"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.... let's talk about the real issues." @BernieSanders #DemDebate
I think the American people are sick of email talk or at least this American sure the heck is. Let's talk about poverty. #DemDebate
That anti-Hillary PAC commercial was tacky and horrible. #DemDebate
I always liked @LincolnChafee but he is not ready for prime time. The big stage is shrinking him. #DemDebate
@MartinOMalley needs to speak up. People might want to hear him as he often makes good sense #DemDebate
"I'm not a pacifist, I supported..." killing people too @BernieSanders #DemDebate
"I'm not a young man today." @BernieSanders #DemDebate
@JimWebbUSA why do I want to go to the Tripoli airport? Why are you on this stage?  #DemDebate
That was a weak foreign policy response @BernieSanders Were you napping? #DemDebate

@LincolnChafee is a block of granite?And they call Hillary a robot? #DemDebate
Careful @andersoncooper when @FoxNews started so hard in debate, Trump grew more popular. #DemDebate
@HillaryClinton @BernieSanders seem to be on tonight. Guess is the loyalists get more loyal and the undecided stay undecided #DemDebate
@BernieSanders handled the Democratic Socialist attack well. "We will first explain what a Democratic Socialist is." #DemDebate

"In the past 5 years, the number of people in our community who live in poverty has increased 33%"@uwjwc
@uwjwc data 40% of households in our community do not have enough income to meet their basic housing, food child care and health care needs
If anyone says Johnson County did not notify cities about the County Minimum Wage Ordinance before it was voted on, they are not truthful.
For the record, not a single member of any City Council has ever consulted me about one of their ordinances. #DoubleStandard
