Cox in the governor's race: Good news for Democrat Newsom; bad news for national Dems who were hoping to keep Republican off statewide ballot.

Villaraigosa notes that 118,000 voters not on the voting rolls when they turned up to vote in LA. . Still, he is now about 290,000 votes behind Cox in race for No. 2. Yes, very little LA vote in so far. But that's a big hole.	https://t.co/TCughw62DM

@mattdpearce I disagree. First the story is not judgemental; it is heavily reported and driven by quotes from LA people. Second, I have traveled across the country for years and there are few (of any) cities quite like LA. And so what? That‚Äôs what makes it great imo.

At 29 minutes (quick first count) that might be a record-long Brown State of the State
Brown says all the major nations agree on climate change "except one. And that is solely because of one man. " It's apparently the only allusion by Brown to Trump.

Brown's remarks about high-speed rail is really aimed at two people sitting with him on the stage: Kevin de Leon and Gavin Newsom, the leading contenders to replace him as governor

Who does Trump dislike more: America media, Lindsey Graham or the CIA?
Suspect that chaotic press conferences like this have the effect of playing into Trump attempts to discredit media.
This sounds more like a political brief than a legal brief.
This isn't designed to cut down on the number of questions that the president-elect is going to take, I assume.
This should have been 2 separate news conferences.1st news conference of President-elect since election (&amp; in 6 ,months) deserves own stage.
This news conference is going to keep the fact-checkers busy for a while.
Stating the obvious: This feels more like a heated campaign press conference than a presidential news conference.
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Putin than Trump would?

Only seven minutes left in the great 2016 presidential debate season. I am missing it already.
Some of these Chris Wallace questions sound like they could have been written two months ago; better to be as on the news as possible.
Chris Wallace seems incredulous that Trump won't pledge to accept the results of the election as legitimate.
Trump just declines to pledge to support the outcome of the election as legitimate; breaking (again) with Pence.
Finally the rigged question.
Is Chris Wallace -- should Chris Wallace -- ask about the sexual harassment charges floating over this campaign? Seems odd not to.
Could someone get Alec Baldwin off the stage please?
Hillary is Putin-baiting Trump. Memorable.
@elizamay @nytimes Just to be clear, definitely NOT.

Clinton would have been smart to hold out for two-hour debates.
This may be a Town Hall debate, but there's a lot less interaction with the audience than I recall from previous presidential debates.
He's giving a more conventional debate performance than last time. That's a good thing.

Win or loose, did Pence do anything tonight to win new votes for Trump (as opposed to raising his own stock in the GOP heading into 2020)?
And that was one where Kaine could have had a better retort: Have you seen Trump's tax returns? How do you know? https://t.co/jqYN30Ob40
Did Pence ever defend any statement Trump made that he was he was confronted with by Kaine?
This is the moment when Pence wishes he could sneak a look at his watch.
Elaine Quijano is interrupting when she shouldn't -- and standing back when she shouldn't. Debate moderating is tough -- but very important.
Watching Pence (and Kaine) is a reminder of just how dramatically unprepared Trump was for his debate.
I am missing Lester Holt as a moderator right now.
Pence does not have an easy job here. Just stating the obvious
Pence just caught up in the who-is-using-the-most-obviously-canned-line fight wiht his "here we go again" moment. Followed by silence.
Trump used the tax code brilliantly." -- A Pence line we will probably hear again, from Democrats.
1 reason 1st debate was so engaging was moderator stepped aside and let them debate. Hope Elaine Quijano  does that; so far, not so much

Trump seems REALLY hot to me. I'm sure he's appealing to his voters. But how is this playing with moderates, suburban women?

Trump is repeatedly and powerfully attacking Clinton on trade. Does he risk coming across as hectoring her?
Trump talking about the past vs Clinton talking about the future. Should be the reverse.
Ironic after these past two weeks is that it sounds like Trump is the one who is under the weather tonight.
I was skeptical of Trump camps claim that he did little debate prep.So far it does seem that way; much of this is campaign stump stuff.
Hillary Clinton looked like she was trying to get under Trump's skin by raising his father. And it seems to have worked.

At this point, don't think Trump has to worry about immigration speech hurting standing w base. Not sure what it does w/ moderate voters.
This is a mellow speech. "You can call it wherever you want, they're gone. They are going out fast."
"They don't know it yet, but they are going to pay for it." Does this mean Trump didn't mention Mexico paying for wall at meeting w prez?
New policy: "NO. 1: We will build a great wal along the southern border. ANd Mexico will pay for the wall"
Trump said at start of speech that he would offer a detailed policy speech on immigration. I assume that's coming.
@PaulBegala One of your better turns of phrase, Begala.
So far, is this Trump speech a real pivot on immigration?  Listing of illegal immigrant crime victims feels like Trump primary speech.

For all the speculation/instant analysis of Clinton speech, it's going to take a week to get an accurate read on how this plays, poll-wise.
Clinton, going 2nd w her convention, gets he closing argument in a debate. Suspect Trump gave little thought to that in writing his speech.
With this speech, it's clear these 2 weeks come down to 1 thing: The contrast between Clinton tonight and Trump last week. A real contrast.
Trump in some ways made this an easier speech for Clinton to write: He really gave her something to pivot off of.
This Clinton delivery seems meant for TV. She is always criticized for speaking to hall (yelling). Feels like she's talking to living room.
https://t.co/tTpTzHmVw9
The key question tonight is, is Clinton performance compared to Obama, or is she compared to Trump. I suspect  Trump. That's the election.
To those who were wondering if Clinton would go after Trump directly in this speech -- well, that took eight minutes.

"And the American dream is something no wall can ever contain." -- That in a nutshell is the Obama v. Trump argument for the fall campaign.
It's as if Obama is running for a third term.
Has any sitting president has ever gone after an opposing candidate running to succeed him -- by name -- the way he goes after Trump? Ever?
I'm not sure I've ever seen Obama disdain an opponent or foe as much as he disdains Trump. Ever.

This is an optimistic, the future is better speech from Obama, contrast to Trump. I think voters want that.
I'm guessing 8 years later, Obama thinks he made right decision on his vice president. Wonder if Trump will think the same in 8 if he wins.

Just in case it wasn't clear; "In this race;for the White House, I am the law and order candidate." --Donald Trump
In the hall, this is a fairly hot speech by Trump. I wonder how it is playing on television, which is all that counts.
This is one of those "honey-send-the-kids-to-bed" speeches.
Trump is painting a REALLY dark portrait of America today. Not sure that view is a majority view among Americans. That may change by Nov. 8

Question: Did Pence just fall out of the lead of the convention story?	Answer: Probably.
Cruz just basically dissed, in a very public way, the Republican nominee for president. Don't forget, Rubio did NOT. He all but endorsed him
Delegates on floor were yelling "KEEP YOUR PLEDGE" to Cruz, referring to pledge to support nominee. Cruz did not.
They are booing Ted Cruz. He might have wore out his welcome with the Trump crowd. He mentioned Trump's name twice.
If Cruz gets the nomination in 2020, look back to tonight as  the moment that started it. Like Obama at Democratic convention in 2004
Think Trump is throwing his shoe at the television screen right now?
Cruz is talking about Trump almost as much as Trump talked about Pence at the VEEP roll-out last Saturday. I.E. not so much.	.
If Trump was hoping for Cruz endorsement,  looks unlikely. Trump had no choice but giving him a spot, or risk a very divided convention.
RT @RuthSherman: @adamnagourney @maggieNYT @nickconfessore @ScottWalker fills TV screen. Not having podium enables him to connect much more‚Ä¶
The way to distinguish GOP speakers: The "vote against Clinton" crowd vs. the "vote FOR Trump" crowd. Ryan/McConnell in 1st. Walker in 2nd.

Best Trump speeches of convention so far: His kids. They are doing what Melania Trump didn't, and needed to: Painting in human side of him.
Do we think that people are going to compare the Pence speech tomorrow with the Christie speech tonight? Not that Christie wants that.
This might be the last high-profile political speech in Chris Christie's career. He's trying to make the most of it.
Would Pence ever give a slash-Clinton speech like the one Christie is giving? Could  he? That's subtext of this speech in Cleveland.
Watch Christie give his "what-might-have-been" lesson to Trump as he gives his convention speech tonight. First up: The case against Clinton
Talking in book language: No blurb quotes from Ryan for Trump to put on his book jacket.
Very skillful Ryan speech, says all he needs about Trump &amp; focuses on Obama-Clinton time-for-a-change. He's okay if Trump loses or wins.
Still stunning to hear Mitch McConnell get booed at the convention. Also there are empty seats on the floor for him.
This is "Make America Work Again" night at the Republican convention; not clear why yet. Talk is guns, Clinton scandals, emails, etc.
Pence is nominated by acclamation as GOP VP candidate. No objections.

Giuliani's speech is the strongest testimony to Trump we've heard tonight. By a mile.
Many empty seats at GOP convention. Is that one of costs of having fewer big name GOPers here? Place would be packed for Bush 43 right?.

Different, but maybe not VERY different, Don't forget how much Sanders spent on TV &amp;  steam he had off NH win.	   https://t.co/XTwncgssP3
Clinton may get extra expectations boost because historically dicey Nevada polls helped set narrative of verytight race that she could lose.
Sanders was relatively late to organize in Nevada, but spent over  $3 million on TV ads &amp; has very experienced crew. https://t.co/XhTrSUjojU
Us political reporter-types tend to look for ways to make a win a loss &amp; a loss a win in early going primaries..	 https://t.co/y9FwGDuYpr
In considering Clinton advantage in Clark County now, also note she is keeping it close in the Big Swing, Washoe County, w  3/4 of vote in:
Plus 1. That Latino story line likely fades if a) she wins by a decent margin today  and b) she crushes in SC. https://t.co/2VOO4YpSuD

@FrankBruni Funny - or sad/cynical!  Scotusblog disagrees. Predictions risky business this yr.
@Applebome Sanders getting the nomination and winning a general is a big if. A Clinton win and a Democratic senate are both very possible.
Completely agree  https://t.co/bwcdRP5ATj
Law of unintended consequences: What if Clinton wins White House and Dems take back Senate? This might look like  GOP miscalculation  w time
Trump better hope that this audience is not representative of the GOP caucus electorate next Saturday.
This is exactly why last debate was so bad for Rubio: it makes people look at everything he says through that prism. https://t.co/d4eMNSGXyz

RT @tackettdc: Rubio was primed for a scripted answer on Scalia. Waiting for the answer on the question
RT @BeschlossDC: LBJ was lame-duck when he named Abe Fortas in 1968.
Kasich wishes we hadn't run so fast into politics so soon after Scalia's death, -- and goes on to call on Obama not to nominate successor.
Does Rubio slip in the prepared joking reference to his last debate debacle in his first response, second, or third?
Big news for Robin Toner political journalism @tonerprgram award dinner: White House just announced this year's speaker is President Obama.
Hey remind me, did Bernie Sanders vote against the Iraq resolution?
Here comes  test on whether Sanders, after last debate, boned up on foreign policy. You get a drink for any Wall Street mention here on out.
After giving a pretty conventional political non-answer on what  government spending he'd cut, Sanders come back to single out the military.
