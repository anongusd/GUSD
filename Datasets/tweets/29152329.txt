11/ ...the most productive, innovative, and charitable healthcare system in the world. https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
10/ Socialists are correct that healthcare is a matter of life and death. And they sure are correct that our current, overly regulated system is flawed. But it could get a lot worse, and it sure would be a shame if we kneecapped... https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
9/ We're the single most charitable nation in the world, with $33 billion going to health organizations and $22 billion going to international affairs. This could not continue if the US adopts to a socialized healthcare system. https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
8/ The federal government collected $1.7 trillion in income taxes for fiscal year 2018, an all-time high. We'd need to collect more than twice that at least ($3.26 trillion per year) to fund a worse healthcare system. https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
7/ Americans also foot the bill of pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world's nations. We only account for a quarter of the world's income, but we pay for up to 78 percent of total pharmaceutical profits, subsidizing the cheap list prices of drugs for every other country. https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
6/ ...with private industry footing the overwhelming majority of the bill. From 2013 through 2016, private industry made up the lion's share of growth in R&amp;D spending, revving up their funding by 25 percent. The federal government increased its spending by half that, https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
5/ The United States comprises 4.4 percent of the world's population, yet we produce 44 percent of the world's medical research and development. Of the $171.8 billion we spend on R&amp;D, the federal government contributes just one-fifth... https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
4/ Physicians would either age out of the market as young people don't see the value in entering the profession, as is occurring in France, or they could physically emigrate, as they are doing in Romania, which has lost half of its physicians in the past decade. https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
3/ Physicians could play hardball with the government and demand more pay, thus blowing out that $32.6 trillion figure.  Or, more realistically, there would be a mass exodus of providers from the market. https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
2/  It assumes that physicians and hospitals would take home a reimbursement rate 40 percent lower than private insurance, which nearly three-quarters of the country currently use. One of two things would happen as a result. https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
1/ The most comprehensive cost analysis of the Medicare for All bill estimated that the legislation would cost $32.6 trillion over its first decade ($3.26 trillion/year). https://t.co/FShGQMCvhK
