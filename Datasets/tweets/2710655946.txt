@TrentDaeschner @GG_LeahVann @TexasTy95 I agree with Trent on this.
The Texas band is doing its ACL show. See, you can come to the game AND catch some ACL music.
Kyle Porter scores his second one-yard TD of the game. Texas is ahead 21-17 with 16 seconds left in the half.
Malcolm Roach sacks Ertz for a 10-yard loss. Big hold for the Texas defense.

The first time in several games where the Texas secondary got burned and gave up a big pass play.
Jesse Ertz found his man across the middle and K State scores the first TD of the game.
The first quarter is over. The Texas defense has held Kansas State so far but the offense has not found anything.

Kyle Porter hurdled his way for a three-yard TD. Texas was to attempt the PAT but the play is under review.
Ehlinger ran for the first down and lowered his shoulder pads on a K State defender.
Ehlinger fumbled and jumped on it before he had his second TO of the game.
A weird look because it appeared Kansas State was going to punt. It was a rushed FG but it was good.
KSU nailed the 54-yard FG. Wildcats ahead 3-0.
Very nice, Kansas State. https://t.co/rQiAuRiLb8
Wow. https://t.co/uA0C5mjgYY

@RIFAN23 @clayaiken The show will be up on iTunes. Just search Domecast from the News and Observer.
Aiken did say he thought Trump was a very nice person. When Aiken decided to run for Congress Trump was one of the first people he called.
Aiken said on election night when Trump came out on stage after he won, the look on the president's face was shock that "oh shit I won."
Decisions were made by producers and they would feed him notes through the Teleprompter on his desk.
Aiken talks about his experience around Donald Trump on The Apprentice. He said Trump did not make decisions.
"Stop saying the sky is falling. The people will see the bill the way it is," Aiken said about Democrats and the healthcare bill.
@clayaiken Aiken said he was disappointed in how the Democratic Party handled the 2016 election. He supported Bernie Sanders during the primary.
@clayaiken Aiken ran in 2014 for a Congressional seat. He lost that election but he said he keeps the political door open.

Strong talks about a walk-on who is an engineering major and told him, "coach I worry about you."
Strong said he has gotten support from people Bret Bielema, former players, and parents.
"This group of guys will win a national championship . . . and I believe in that statement," Strong said he told the team yesterday.
Strong continues by talking about holding these guys to a high academic standard and building the "total person."
As a case to keep his job, Strong talks about how few seniors this team will lose at the end of the season.
"I don't think so and I'd like to think so," Strong said about whether the administration has already made up its mind.
"We just need to get this," Strong said about TCU.
Strong keeps stressing this is all about winning this for the seniors and get to a bowl game.
"They won't boycott this game," Strong said about players saying they will boycott the TCU game.

Orange fighting until the very end. 2.8 seconds remain as they trail by 1.
Osetkowski is a good player for this team in the future.
Osetkowski will have to sit out this year because of the transfer rule. He has 15 points on 6-6 tonight.
Roach, Young and Mack are all in double digits for the orange. Mack with 14, Roach 12 and Young 10.
Jacob Young is a mean player. Deep shots, attacking the rim or being aggressive on defense, he isn't afraid to do anything.
Andrew Jones nails a tough three pointer with a man in his face.
At the half it's ties up, 25-25. Mack has 12 points and is 5-5 from the field. Osetkowski has 10 points and 4 rebounds.
So far the sophomore class of Mack, Roach and Davis look like the real deal for Texas.
Jones finds James Banks for the easy dunk.
Jacob Young hit his first three. This kid does not play with fear.
RT @CallahanGarrett: @SiegelEzra he's not playing tonight. Keeping him out with a left hamstring tweak
Tevin Mack is the leading scorer for the orange team with 10 points. He is 4-4 from the field and 2-2 from deep.
Andrew Jones getting nifty down low with a couple of spin moves.
Roach drives to the basket but he has added a very smooth jump shot.
Forward Dylan Osetkowski, the transfer from Tulane, has been very active down low.
The last fast break Roach led for the Orange team was impressive.
Shaq Cleare's behind the back pass led to a bucket.
Kerwin Roach attacked the basket last year but his first two shot attempts have been from the outside.

Foreman said about the 2014 trip to Kansas State that the team didn't play well but this squad is different.
Foreman has had fumbles in each of the last two games. He admits he carries the ball a little too high and that has to be fixed.
"For one, I've got to hold onto the football," Foreman said about things he needs to work on.
D'Onta Foreman stresses what a good job his offensive line has done and continuing to work with them to get better.
"I don't think anyone can cover me," Duvernay said when asked if his brother could cover him.
Duvernay said he can only think of one time when he lost a track race and that was his junior year of high school.
"They took me in well and guided me along," Duvernay said about the Texas players welcoming him.
Duvernay said he has not talked to anyone at Baylor and he doesn't expect too many emotions when Texas and Baylor play.
"I felt comfortable with Coach Strong and they had a ton of talent," Duvernay said about visiting Texas.
Duvernay says the transition has been good. He says the offense hasn't been too hard to learn to learn so he fits right in.
Freshman WR Devin Duvernay making his first presser.
Gilbert says the Kansas State defense is good. He uses terms of "stingy" and "fundamental" defense like he did last week to describe ISU.
"He is a sharp kid and highly intelligent," Gilbert said about Devin Duvernay learning the offense.
Regarding Devin Duvernay, Gilbert says he has lived up to the potential and they are excited about him.
Regarding the workload of D'Onta Foreman, Gilbert said they are aware of that and keeping an eye on it.
Regarding Lil'Jordan Humphrey, Gilbert says he can be utilized in a lot of ways.

Gilbert did address penalties as being something that slowed Texas down against Cal.

D'Onta Foreman is the second player at the Gilbert presser.
There is pressure on this team to keep the Stillwater win streak going. The last time Texas lost there was 1997.

Evans said there aren't any big changes to make. He said there were some clips that happened at Cal he doesn't want on his resume.

Progress going forward, Nelson said the DL needs to continue putting more pressure on opposing quarterbacks.
"We don't care about the polls" but just keep winning and moving forward, Nelson said.
Nelson said he wasn't worried about the freshman coming in. He said his thought was "yeah we needed them."
