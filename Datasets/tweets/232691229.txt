@janeredhead @WhiteHouse Like I said “autocorrect” my dear lady. Again you assume since I love our president that I don’t have higher degrees or education..
@janeredhead @WhiteHouse See you can’t help yourself trying to get a shot in because of my autocorrect
@AshMcGonigal @WhiteHouse Also did you know that he has had over 500 business. So 6 bankruptcies is pretty darn good odds. I know people who have filed for bankruptcy but it doesn’t make them a failure. They picked up the pieces and continued fighting. I want that person on my side.
@AshMcGonigal @WhiteHouse Look around.. the country is BOOMING! Just don’t get left behind...
@s_carruth @WhiteHouse Luckily that is not true. Wages are rising all around me and our businesses in the southeast. America is booming again
@janeredhead @WhiteHouse See that’s same attitude Hillary had about the deplorable Americans. Just because you don’t agree they’re vote shouldn’t  count. It’s the quiet ones who keep they’re heads down and pay they’re taxes and protect our country who voted to try and make America an even greater country

@Danaiolos @WhiteHouse And??? How high did it go up under Obama?

@dattwell1 @AmyMoor39081778 @SenTedCruz @HoustonChron That’s all well and good but once China and India and all the other second world countries are on board it won’t make a difference. We’ve cut ours nearly 90% since the 70s

@AmyMoor39081778 @SenTedCruz @HoustonChron I don’t think a couple hurricanes counts as proof of climate change please. Subsidence of the land isn’t caused from greenhouse gasses rather the compaction of soils. (Building on wetlands hundreds of years ago)
@SilenceDGTNG @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @HoustonChron Show us something better than cow farts and banning air travel and we can  talk. Let’s have some realistic ideas for the future and include China and India in the equation. Pollution doesn’t stop at our borders
@mags2198 @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @HoustonChron The crazy thing is how much we’ve cut  most air pollutants about 90% even though we have more people more cars etc. it’s nothing like it was when I was a child in the 70s. I remember the smell and haze from cars. Not many practical replacements for gasoline yet
@TrumpBeauWall @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @HoustonChron Don’t worry... we’re getting the wall. His genius is in the fact that everybody is talking about it. He’s orchestrated it for that reason.
