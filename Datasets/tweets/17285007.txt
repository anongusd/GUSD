...I think that the more voters feel like bits in a giant computer, their vote merely the outcome of some deterministic calculation, the less they will care about the issues, about voting at all, and ultimately, about whether they live in a democracy or a dictatorship.
... and victory goes to the party with the best algorithms. One might argue that technology overtook ideas as the primary force in politics long ago and this is merely the next step, but...
... any remaining notion of elections as an exercise in free choice by citizens has become meaningless. Without legal constraints on how data can be used for political purposes, the electorate becomes nothing more than a system of variables to be tweaked and optimized...
The last three US presidential elections have been about successively more intensive uses of data to profile voters and predict and influence their vote. What Bloomberg is reportedly planning represents the (inevitable) continuation of that, towards a point when...

@Kevin_Ashton @mims @dcseifert @zseward Too vague? As in, we want a word that identifies those people with whom we have some sort of relationship, not all people.
@mims @dcseifert @zseward In that case why not call them users? Or anything else? If all dictionary definitions are inadequate, why does it matter? Perhaps you'll tell me that it's because "readers" is traditional, but that argument doesn't hold much water.
@mims @dcseifert @zseward Moreover, whether they're "users", "clients", "audience", "community" or anything else, what counts is how you define your relationship with them. Is your success predicated only on keeping them coming back as much as possible, or on doing something truly valuable *for them*?
@mims @dcseifert @zseward And while it's a good aspiration for journalistic orgs to reframe their "users" as a "community", I'm not sure that's necessarily so for producers of other things. The "spreadsheet community" for Excel? The "publishing community" for WordPress? These aren't communities.
@mims @dcseifert @zseward What would be a better word? It's become the fashion in journalism to talk of the people formerly known as your audience as your "community". The vast majority of outlets pay only lip service to treating them as community, though‚Äîbecause it's hard! (https://t.co/swxwdoncdY)
@mims @dcseifert @zseward On the other hand, @dcseifert's objections to "user" make sense: it reduces a person to a narrow set of interactions and frames them as someone you are trying, basically, to addict to your product.
@mims @dcseifert This is an interesting problem. I (and I think @zseward) have advocated "user" instead of "reader" of journalism, because a "reader" is a passive, one-way, consumer of only text, and no longer describes people who interact with our journalism.

@jayrosen_nyu @KimShoeCrzy Interesting. Well, maybe this is a huge reach, but "storyteller" was once a position of great power and privilege--shamans were as importantly storytellers as magicians or medicine men/women. As agreed sets of facts has lost power, does story regain primacy as a way to "truth"?
@jayrosen_nyu @KimShoeCrzy @DeadRabbitNYC (Though of course, I realize your real question isn't "how did it happen" but "what do we do about it")
@jayrosen_nyu @KimShoeCrzy @DeadRabbitNYC So, Jay, could the answer to your original question‚Äî"how our journalists came to see 'storytelling' as the heart of what they do"‚Äîbe a response to that pressure to make the journalistic "product" stand out, as with food, cocktails, clothes, and so on?
@jayrosen_nyu @KimShoeCrzy @DeadRabbitNYC The more I've gone through life the more I've grasped that to understand the "human condition," whatever that means, we need to understand why story‚Äîbeginning, middle, end, with transformation along the way‚Äîis such a powerful mental model.
@jayrosen_nyu @KimShoeCrzy @DeadRabbitNYC Stories are tremendously important to us; they're how we make sense of ourselves and of the world. ("We tell ourselves stories in order to live"‚ÄîJoan Didion https://t.co/498Rx7ft9y). Narratives have a mental gravitational pull on us. It's a major effort *not* to tell them.
@jayrosen_nyu @KimShoeCrzy @DeadRabbitNYC In fact, that Esquire review of that book is a perfect summation: "Don't make cocktails at home? So what." The original product itself barely matters; it's the story around the product that makes you buy it.
@jayrosen_nyu @KimShoeCrzy My latest favorite example: Someone got me @DeadRabbitNYC's cocktail recipe book for Christmas. Not that the recipes aren't amazing, but it relies heavily on storytelling to make the book memorable https://t.co/vVHMVM75Ow
@jayrosen_nyu @KimShoeCrzy I think this is true generally. As production (of food, gadgets, clothing, whatever) has become more sophisticated and harder to distinguish on grounds of pure quality, story has started to matter more; it's part of the marketing.
@Fredrikkerlund2 @NiemanLab I don't think that's right. First, we already have a place where users can search for a topic and get lots of interpretations‚ÄîGoogle News. Second, as I argue in that Nieman post, a Netflix-style model is likely to be bad for media because it forces prices of content down.
@jayrosen_nyu I *hope* that the answer is that we will be forced, as more paywalls go up, to figure out what provides true value https://t.co/39Dru0xXOs. And *hope* that @jeffjarvis is right that value will come from convening productive conversation in communities https://t.co/HX7eG6WjjK
@jayrosen_nyu As people on your thread have pointed out, Jay, this has to do with the pressure to be "compelling" (as good stories are) to win readers. So what can counter that pressure while still making journalism businesses sustainable?

At any rate, the left has no Obamas-in-waiting, and its angry rabble-rousers (Sanders, Warren) look to me like spent forces. [ends]
I don't know what those extreme measures would be. What's a Democrat's version of "Build the wall" or "Drill, baby, drill"? A decade ago it would have been "Break up the banks" but that ship has sailed.
And it's hard to see a Democratic contender succeeding unless they have either extraordinary Obama-style charisma - the "hope-y change-y thing" - or do for the left what Trump has done for the right, whipping up the anger and promising extreme measures.
It's hard to see a Republican successor to Trump campaigning as a moderate trying to bring the country back together. I wonder if even Mike Pence has the stomach for the kind of red-meat electioneering that Trump is so good at.
The strong turnout on both sides means people still believe in voting, which is good. But it also confirms that 1) the tribal divisions Trump's election uncovered are deep, and 2) Trump's divisive and fear-based campaign style wasn't just a fluke the first time; it works.
This wasn't the worst election outcome I feared, which was that Democratic voters would be so apathetic and disillusioned that they wouldn‚Äôt turn out. That would have meant a loss of faith in the whole idea of democracy, and its eventual decline.

@brianstelter @jswatz @jayrosen_nyu So the danger of "we're not at war, we're at work" is that it can also act as cover for an unthinking continuation of business-as-usual journalism in an era that requires new techniques and hard debates about what purposes different kinds of reporting serve.
@brianstelter @jswatz @jayrosen_nyu FWIW, I think a similar basic change should be to stop treating Trump and his administration as synonyms. It's always been taken for granted that what the president says and does is policy. That isn't the case this time.
@brianstelter @jswatz @jayrosen_nyu A small example: Only recently have media started to recognize that reporting on outrageous false claims can help spread them and give them credibility. That changes how you cover news.
@brianstelter @jswatz @jayrosen_nyu There's another shortcoming to "we're not at war, we're at work": It doesn't acknowledge the possibility that while we may still be at work, the ~nature~ of the work may have changed, i.e., it requires new techniques, as Jay often says.

The only thing Putin needs to "have" on Trump is an understanding of how easy Trump is to manipulate‚Äîwhich, sadly, isn't hard.
He's spent his entire presidency insisting his victory was the greatest ever. It would undermine his entire narrative to acknowledge otherwise. It's *less* plausible that, if he knew Putin had something on him, he would act in a way that made it seem so blatantly obvious.
This is the logic that I don't buy. We've all seen Trump's narcissism and obsession with status, his short-term thinking and inability to grasp complexity. To me those explain how he could sooner exonerate Russia than admit his victory was imperfect. https://t.co/lloKVobUKA

(@jessanne, this thread's for you.)
So if your employer, like mine, has banned you from using toaster ovens in the office, try telling them that statistically, you are far safer using them at work than at home. (And let me know if it works.) /END
To summarize: Annual injuries due to cooking equipment at home: 5,470. Annual injuries due to cooking equipment in offices: Four. /11
Because office fires caused by cooking equipment, while much more frequent, are much less damaging than most other kinds. /10 https://t.co/Mcw6GJwxSB
Yet while cooking equipment caused 29% of office fires, it caused only 9% of civilian injuries. Or in actual numbers, four. Four Americans a year are hurt by office fires involving cooking equipment. /9 https://t.co/RgmTOS19YZ
It will astonish and impress you to learn that the leading cause of office fires is... cooking equipment! Which caused an average of 960 office fires a year in 2007-2011, according to the @NFPA. /8
However! These are the statistics for home fires. What about office fires? I'm so glad you asked. Because the NFPA has a report on that too. https://t.co/g7ehYye9iq /7 https://t.co/X6Ju33Zbt8
The exact proportion of fires and deaths due ~specifically~ to toasters and toaster ovens is not recorded. /6 https://t.co/1gN85fRH3V
Of those fires, around 5%, or 8,500 a year, are caused by ~portable~ cooking equipment, which includes toasters and toaster ovens. These fires cause 6% of the deaths, or around 30 people a year. /5 https://t.co/tEcKkWloFz
Here we learn that cooking equipment causes some 170,000 home fires a year in the US, killing 510 civilians (i.e. not firefighters) and injuring more than 5,000. /4 https://t.co/xRtXAM95VF
Because somebody, of course, has studied how many fires have been caused by toaster ovens. In great detail. This recent US National Fire Protection Association report on "Home Fires Involving Cooking Equipment" runs to 111 pages. https://t.co/WkxNgDDYbg /3
My first reaction was: another typical pointless busybody building management rule. Then I got to wondering: Just how many fires have toaster ovens caused? Well, get ready for a rabbit hole! /2
We are no longer allowed a toaster oven or a kettle in the office because they put us in grave peril of burning the place the down. A toaster, though, is fine, as long as it's unplugged after 5pm. /1 https://t.co/utQFqO1HLD

So, if you happen to know an experienced adrenal surgeon with an interest in challenging cases, please message me (DMs are open). /end
So far, they have spoken to four surgeons and none feels qualified enough to try the procedure. Of course, without it, his days are numbered in any case. He's 43, and he has three kids. /8
In other words, he needs to have a tumor cut out that is touching two major blood vessels, without cutting the blood vessels and without touching the tumor. Tricky. /7
It's also large enough that it's protruding from the adrenal gland and touching the two major blood vessels nearby, the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava. You don't want to damage those. /6
To remove a pheo, you have to start the patient on meds some time before the surgery to counter the effect the adrenaline spikes will have on the body. In his case, the tumor is large enough to limit how effective these meds can be. /5
And his pheo is big. Essentially, it's as if his own adrenal gland had turned into a poison frog perched inside his abdomen, waiting to release deadly toxin if anyone so much as touches it. /4
The rub is that a "pheo", as its sufferers not-so-affectionately call it, is a tumor with a built-in self-defense mechanism: it releases spikes of adrenaline when disturbed. (You can't biopsy it, for that reason.) If the spikes are big enough, they'll kill you. /3
Though most pheochromocytomas aren't malignant, they do produce excess adrenaline, which can cause dangerously high blood pressure. The only treatment is surgery to remove it. But there's a rub. /2
So, my friend's brother is in hospital in Dallas with a benign pheochromocytoma. This is a tumor of the adrenal gland, which makes (duh) adrenaline. With this kind of tumor, however, "benign" is deceptive. /1

@nytimes And sure, a publication doesn't have to take an activist stance on every story. But if it can't do so on a story that directly affects most of its readers in its home city, when can it? /8

@nytimes Millions of New Yorkers are angry with the subways on a near-daily basis. If that anger were usefully directed it might bring about change. It is not being usefully directed. Is that itself not part of the story? /5

@nytimes The standard mantra is that a newspaper's job is to report, not to tell people how to act on its reporting. But what is the reporting for if not to get people to act? /3
@nytimes This unwillingness to admit that in doing accountability journalism you are also engaging in activism is, to me, the most baffling and most counterproductive feature of American journalism. /2

In short, Trump is not trying to be a president. He's just trying to stay president. That's how to explain the logic of what he does.
12/ People have been pointing this out at least since last summer. It's still true. https://t.co/ShZo0dywhj https://t.co/o5dNNH6KrN
11/ Or perhaps a better analogy is that we're the lever and our audiences are pressing us to get the cocaine, which we have to supply.
10/ Mainstream media really need to stop being astonished by how Trump-y Trump is. We're like rats pressing the lever to get the cocaine.
9/ Meanwhile, liberal outrage at the things he says continues to serve Trump by showing his supporters how beleaguered he is.
8/ Of course there's a chance he'll misjudge‚Äîthat at some point such cynicism will turn supporters off him. But seriously I doubt it.
7/ Trump cares only about what his loyal base thinks. They're his leverage with the GOP. If what he says outrages others, it doesn't matter.
6/ This is perfectly in line with the logic of his Phoenix rally, as I outlined in a few days ago. https://t.co/fFwtiADx2b
5/ So what he is admitting is that he wanted more of his supporters (who are also Arpaio supporters) to see that he had pardoned Arpaio.
4/ When anyone says "a lot of people think that..." they mean the people they agree with. Trump is obviously referring to his supporters.
3/ I think the clue is in what he said right before that: "A lot of people think it was the right thing to do." https://t.co/HQ5lVaTLGD
2/ On its face, it makes no sense for Trump to freely admit to using a huge natural disaster for political aims. But there must be a logic.
1/ So I'm trying to make sense of Trump's admission that he timed the Arpaio pardon to #Harvey for the TV ratings https://t.co/HorYZhxiin

RT @dedwards93: Great thread from @glichfield on Trump's use of loyalty for leverage https://t.co/lfVUnt2SEW
And judgments like "this is the moment he became presidential" will hold true just about that long - a moment. /END
So if you assume consistency in his messaging, you're bound to get confused by "pivots" that aren't pivots, just opportunistic tweaks. /8
Like Joe Arpaio, he's worked out that with a loyal minority you can leverage the majority.  https://t.co/w1a7fDqWwY /7
Trump isn't very strategic but he instinctively understands loyalty and leverage. He uses loyalty (his base) for leverage (with the GOP). /6
We make a mistake when we assume every Trump utterance is directed at the same audience just because he's president of the whole country. /5
But at a speech like today's he's talking to America. Doesn't always go well (Charlottesville) but is likelier to be moderate in tone. /4
Trump's rallies are for stoking his base and showing the GOP he still controls his base. The fiery antics aren't accidental. /3
This underlines my point (see previous tweet). Trump hasn't "pivoted." It's that today's speech and yesterday's had different purposes. /2 https://t.co/zfaKApEE7z

@karenthology @mrbowers I‚Äôm hoping that by the time there is one, the press might actually have worked it out to do this
@AddyGYo Hardly could make it any worse than it already is
If he refuses to answer a question from a certain reporter, like, @Acosta, the next reporter shd ask him to take that question. And the next
The goal in normal press conferences is for each outlet to get a quote for itself. The goal w/ Trump is to collectively hold him to account
For future Trump pressers, work as a cohort. Simple, one-part questions. If Trump dodges, next person repeats the question. And the next.
The press treated the Trump press conference like‚Ä¶ well, a press conference. Each reporter tried to ask their own question. It doesn‚Äôt work
RT @Jake_Bernstein: Reporters are going to have to learn to ask Trump qs @ press conferences. 1 q per person others reask if no answer.

10/ A Trump administration will merely turn into deliberate policy what was already reality on the ground in Israel-Palestine.
9/ The peace process was already a sick joke in the industry that had grown up around it
8/ The pace of Israeli settlement building is dictated by housing needs and internal politics, not outside pressure or lack thereof
7/ Unlike some, I don't see Trump's appointing David Friedman as Israel amb. as a major setback. There was nothing to be set back from
6/ Obama admin knew it had no leverage to make Isr-Pal peace happen. It should have been honest about that, and the reasons, from the start
5/ But why then did Kerry give ‚Äúthe most substantive‚Äù speech "ever given by an American at the highest level" 3 weeks before leaving office?
4/ TBF, Obama was up against an increasingly hardline Israel and a fragmented Palestinian Authority that couldn't deliver on agreements
3/... to be remembered as having a principled line on Israel-Palestine, rather than for its failure to do anything about advancing peace
2/ But Remnick is being charitable. Why did the Obama administration need to be heard one last time? Because it wants...

@tomcoates Yes. But what role he plays in the political landscape does count. When a Nazi stands a serious chance of becoming president‚Ä¶
@tomcoates Absolutely they can. And they should. I just think they do themselves a disservice by asking a university to protect them.

@KWalkerTimes Answer: fight to change the law so that it *is* fundamentally different. That‚Äôs my point. Principles are set when you fight.
@KWalkerTimes And if the courts rule it isn‚Äôt fundamentally different? What do we do then?
@KWalkerTimes suppose CALEA were written differently and Apple were included in its remit. It wouldn‚Äôt be able to plant its flag here
@KWalkerTimes hence it is important that tech firms take a stand, in the hope that we can stop that happening f
@kwalkertimes and a law could be changed to render this ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù difference moot
@KWalkerTimes under a slightly different law or tech scenario Apple would not be able to claim this is fundamentally different
@KWalkerTimes For the purposes of this case what is and isn‚Äôt  ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù is contingent on technical details and the wording of a law
@KWalkerTimes I probably shouldn‚Äôt have tried to make my point in 300 words and I certainly can‚Äôt in tweets. But I think you‚Äôre missing it
@KWalkerTimes I disagree. It doesn‚Äôt have it only because it hasn‚Äôt built the tool yet to get at it. That‚Äôs why taking a stand is important

Colleague: Thinking about [writing a] piece on Twitter, eh?		Me: No, just writing a piece on Twitter, on Twitter
15/ So if you put 10k-char tweets into a UI that spent 9 years evolving to serve 140-char tweets, it will not be a happy marriage.
14/ Because Twitter‚Äôs ephemeral nature isn‚Äôt merely a function of tweets being short; it‚Äôs a function of the UI design short tweets led to
13/ (c) will Twitter‚Äôs discovery tools make it as easy to find good stuff to read as on other platforms. I‚Äôm least optimistic about (c)
12/ (b) will it be as easy to post to Facebook and other social media from Twitter as it is on other blogging platforms
11/ And the questions then are, (a) will the writer‚Äôs UI be good enough (at least as good as competing blogging platforms)
10/ And the advantage of writing on Twitter will be one less step to then tweeting what you‚Äôve written
9/ But as a writer, you will now have another choice besides e.g. Medium, tumblr, or your own blog, namely, to write on Twitter
8/ (For instance, no more tweetstorms, for which almost everyone but @pmarca will be truly thankful)
7/ Using Twitter as a *writer*, however, will change a great deal
6/ In fact, to all intents and purposes, using Twitter as a *reader* will not change at all
5/ We will still read Twitter as we do now, and if the first x chars are good, click on "read more"‚Äîmuch as we click on links in tweets now
4/ Or indeed, much like a headline
3/ If there‚Äôs a fade-out/‚Äúread more‚Äù after the first x chars, smart people will choose the first x chars carefully‚Äîmuch like a tweet
2/ What‚Äôs relevant is what the user interface looks like when you post more than x characters (where x is fairly small, e.g., 140)
1/ Thesis: Whether Twitter‚Äôs character limit is 140, 10,000, or 140,000 characters is irrelevant
@gaberivera @pmarca‚Äôs tweetstorms will henceforth be called ‚Äútweets."

@tomcoates If the US delegation were 44% women instead of 22%, the Davos total would be 24% women instead of 17%
@tomcoates Oh, I see. No, I meant if the US had double the share of Davos delegates but with the current % of women
@tomcoates Actually not that dramatically. If US had double the share of participants, the total % of women would only rise to 19%
@tomcoates Swiss not surprising, since it's in Switzerland. US and UK (and India) suggests a bias towards native English speakers
@tomcoates As to variation by year, Davos was 17% female in 2013 and 15% last year, back to 17% this year.
