@YasinAhIsmail Yeah, complete rubbish.
@Barkinka1 Not opposed to the concept but politically it‚Äôs a bit of a non-starter. Also, AMISOM hasn‚Äôt been caught selling weapons into local markets.
@Barkinka1 AS has captured a lot of heavy equipment -- self-propelled guns, APCs, 120mm mortars etc. -- from AMISOM, there's no reason to think they'd have less success with SNA. But agree that the diversion rate would def be lower than small arms.
@Barkinka1 I completely agree that a fully equipped army should be the end goal for the SNA, but it's nowhere near ready for that.
@Barkinka1 If the FGS was allowed to import higher calibre arms, they would be in AS hands within a few months. Then the gov't would be clamouring for even deadlier weaponry.
@Barkinka1 Assuming you've seen the recent ORA by the MoD? Only 70% of SNA soldiers found to possess weapons. FGS had imported 17,500 weapons as of late 2015 (see S/2015/801 para. 136) and thousands since then. Clear evidence of widespread diversion.
@Barkinka1 Partial lift allows the FGS to import guns/ammo up to 12.7mm and mortars up to 82mm (see UNSCR res 2093). But you're missing the point... given wide-scale diversion of AKs there's no reason to think the same wouldn't happen with higher calibre arms.
@PDWilliamsGWU The SEMG's 2015 report (para. 136) gives the figure of 17,500 weapons (most of which were AK-pattern). Don't have the exact number since then but total number is definitely over 20K.
Yup, total nonsense. #FGS has imported well over 20K AK-47s since partial lift of the arms embargo, more than enough for every SNA soldier to have been issued a weapon. https://t.co/yz6NlxeB3B

@samo2beta Yes (see 3rd last tweet). But if all rejected ballots came from one candidate's strongholds, that would also be contentious.
@samo2beta The point of the tweet was to show that rejected ballots are not biased towards one or the other.
.@samo2beta If those votes were rejected bc of problems with the electronic tallying system, it's possible some will be incl during recount.
.@twister2015 Well, the additional aggregate votes would make it harder to achieve 50%+1.
Though there are more rejected ballots in Raila's strongholds, Uhuru's support is much stronger in his. #kenyadecides 2/2

@BenParker140 @GrantBrooke Awesome, a spreadsheet brother! Was just about to start on projections. Data is alrdy out of date though...
#Mudavadi is polling at ~7% in three of @RailaOdinga's strongholds. #kenyadecides #KEelection2013
@kenentrepreneur I think you may have forgotten to consider the "Other" vote.
@RailaOdinga has a small edge in registered votes in his strongholds... about 100K. Question is, is his turnout higher? #kenyadecides
@tamaraleighcfc @rogermid I'm time rich.
Note: the sprdsheet calculates %votes as a function of reg'd voters, NOT votes cast. i.e. doesn't take account of diff regional turnouts.
I think so, yes. King killer if not maker RT @rogermid can we see the difference in strength of stronghold vote as down to Mudavadi?
@kenentrepreneur How not?
89.78% of voters vote for Uhuru in Uhuru's strongholds; 9.35% vote for Raila: #kenyadecides #KEelection2013

@Peter_aminga Please see shared doc in the tweet before last.

@jamesreinl @MikePflanz @rogermid @GabeJoselow Yes but how do you arrive at turnout without knowing how many ballots were cast?
@jamesreinl @MikePflanz @rogermid @GabeJoselow If there's a source for polling stations per county that would also do the trick.
@jamesreinl @MikePflanz @rogermid @GabeJoselow How would they know that 10m votes were cast nationally, then? Am I missing sth?
@jamesreinl @MikePflanz @rogermid @GabeJoselow http://t.co/ZhL5mZEjW0 shows votes counted for each candidate, not total cast per county.

@Deskibel Because the challenge for naval forces is getting within a mile of pirates when they attack, not what weapons to use on them.
