Amid all the talk of #ClimateChange, @JackieTothDC reported on how a majority of Republicans in poll are unconcerned over the issue - despite climate change and U.N.'s jarring report https://t.co/He7L9lKKVb https://t.co/Sgtfp9hEZs
.@EdwardJGraham1 tapped into a smart, underreported story about tech: 6 in 10 Democrats say #netneutrality plays a significant factor in deciding whom to vote for in the midterm elections, but most candidates aren't talking about it at all. https://t.co/0iKaBAFIBU
Per @cameron_easley and @AnnaYukha, seven of the most vulnerable senators ‚Äì #NJSen @MOSen #NVSen #FLSen #WVSen #NDSen + #INSen ‚Äì ended the cycle under water amid millions in campaign ads https://t.co/iMosI7Vp6w https://t.co/BP4fGzjKC8

Republicans leaned hard into security - but it was really about immigration - to energize the GOP base. A Democratic strategist called it "an electric cattle prod to GOP voters to get them to the polls." https://t.co/sdFTnbt2be https://t.co/xHc2Ei9401
Trust in @realDonaldTrump to implement tax changes that benefit Americans dropped a net 14 points since September 2017. But voters are split on who they trust the most ‚Äì Republicans or Democrats in Congress. 		W/ @byclairew: https://t.co/hrHAc3qR6E https://t.co/tzxGz2COdr
Voters continue to trust Democrats on health care ‚Äì despite Republican messaging in #MOSen and other races attempting to pull them back. Per @ymurad__: https://t.co/XMQgWgBVIw https://t.co/vMSbySXCHU
There's been a shift toward Democrats on a number of key issues, as @cameron_easley reported this AM, though they boast leads on two of the top three voting issues: the economy and national security. https://t.co/sGcWiRyJ0T https://t.co/IEgIdPtPIW
This election has been about @realDonaldTrump in the minds of voters. 		Not #Kavanaugh or anyone else: Over half said they were thinking "a lot" about Trump in considering their votes ‚Äì more than all of the top four congressional leaders combined. https://t.co/aLlmLs2OjO https://t.co/kwUKHeDHpI
