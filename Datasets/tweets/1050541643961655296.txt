@SenAlexander Nurses as well. We need these “underperforming” majors because they put into the world a beauty that we can’t deny. We need people who take the world and don’t just make sense of it, but put loveliness into it.
@SenAlexander The arts would die. Teaching, nursing, art, theater, music, gender and social theory, we’d lose so much of that if you did this. “Feminine” jobs earn less, and teachers generally quit within the first five years. Would that mean that colleges stop offering teaching degrees? (2/3)
@SenAlexander Senator, I have only one issue with your proposal - that being that if colleges were to get rid of those majors that end in less gainful employment, we’d end up losing valuable majors due to unforeseen turns in societal ideas of worth. STEM would get more funding. (1/?)

@tommybuck @corvomancer @FixTheCourt When a judge’s politics drift (left or right) in the way of extremes, or they engage in actions that tend towards the optics of extremities, then term limits ARE the correct choice because we can’t say that every decision they make has been colored by these action
@tommybuck @corvomancer @FixTheCourt Tweets aren’t exactly great for this. We can’t prevent it, but we can use oversight and ethics committees to determine if there’s a major influence on a judge’s decision, and if past decisions have overtly gone against accepted judicial norms in relation to an issue.
It’s not impossible to determine if the actions of a politically active spouse/family member has negative effect on the neutrality of a judge - this is what ethics and oversight committees are for. It shouldn’t be left to people who don’t have all the details. We can’t ignore it.
@tommybuck @corvomancer @FixTheCourt We can’t, which is why all judicial positions should have term limits. We can’t prevent these things but we can limit the harm they do.
@tommybuck @FixTheCourt @rjmedwed It’s not about her politics - it’s about how she uses her husband’s position to push her own agenda. Can you name another SC spouse that does the same?
@tommybuck @FixTheCourt @rjmedwed Why are we only looking at Thomas’ wife? Because her political activism is extremely overt and she’s used her husband’s position to bring her own views further into light. Every time she speaks out, it erodes people’s faith in the judiciary. It has to do with her actions.

@tommybuck @FixTheCourt @rjmedwed When someone is as politically active and decisive as she is, and when her beliefs have a truly astounding effect on the rights of American people, we need to take into account how this might effect her husband. So yes.

@AuthorJCHowell @macheels @SandraSBreen You don’t know my personal health history, or that of my family. You can’t decide if I’m low-risk (I’m not) and even if I were, bankruptcy shouldn’t be the answer. I shouldn’t HAVE to lose everything because I get, for example, cancer.
@AuthorJCHowell @macheels @SandraSBreen Not going into medical debt because of an accident, sudden onset of illness, or simple bad luck shouldn’t be impossible.
@AuthorJCHowell @macheels @SandraSBreen First step to me losing my healthcare, actually. The GOP messing with the ACA got my first plan cancelled and the alternative plans he’s offered have jacked up the price of my plan next year by $100 because fewer people are predicted to enroll next year.
@AuthorJCHowell @macheels @SandraSBreen It wasn’t just Obama. Bush did worse to the deficit, and his decisions are why we’re where we are today
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell Asylum means that it’s too dangerous for them to go home, and the issue with putting young ppl to work in the field is multi-fold: they might not live near any ag work (most urban ppl), can’t relocate for only part time work, can’t work for such low wages, or have other duties.
What I think we should look at instead is something that looks at how much business is overseas, how much manufacturing is overseas, how much they pay their lowest wage workers (or how much each worker costs them in benefits + wage), and revenue collected. Maybe? https://t.co/Po3OXquh7U
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell So a flat tax is considered a bad idea by a lot of experts because it doesn’t take into account the incredible variance of each corporation’s revenue; 16% of one company’s revenue is radically different than another’s. (1/2)
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell Of course, but we also need to look at how we generate revenue. How many corporations are hiding billions from the IRS? How much money do we give to these companies? How much does a state spend on useless scrap like stadiums? A budget needs to look at both sides.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell I don’t know enough about the period of time to make an argument for or against that; I can say that it was likely the work of a large team, and that because a consensus was found there was likely work behind the scenes between parties, because that’s usually how it works.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell Because it forced a gov’t shut down. Literally they needed something, anything, to pass through, and partisanship means that major concessions needed to be made for minor progress.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell My stats are pulled from news reports.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell Because it’s not a simple issue: our agriculture relies on immigrants. Agriculture won’t pay more than less than minimum wage. We shouldn’t allow them to do that, and those visas help secure a fair wage and legal conditions until we can fix how our ag system works.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell We could balance the budget if we tried, but the mix of tax increases, code fixes, funding cuts, and the shifting of monetary burdens will never be approved. Bill Clinton managed it, and we had a surplus; the issue is at least partly that we dove into a decade long war.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell The GOP approved a budget and tax cuts that increased the deficit by $1 trillion, and it’s conservative goverment that put in place policies that increased government spending, like forcing dept to use all their funding every year or lose it.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell Conservative politicians regularly want to cut funding for social programs. The people from the caravan intend to seek asylum, have clearly stated so, and are going to go through the whole process to determine if they qualify for it. That’s why there’s little reason to fear them.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell They’re applying for asylum at a port. That’s not illegal.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell Except the government puts that money back into the country; corporations line the pockets of their execs and hide it in offshore accounts.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell Because it’s safer to apply for asylum at the border, which is also perfectly legal, because they feel like they won’t get turned away, because they know people who have done it this way, because it’s easier - there are 100s of reasons why they might choose this.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell Yes. Which is an issue that we should take care of.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell The first wave of the caravan were LGBTQ people, and they’ve just arrived. The second wave is 30% women and children, and third is mostly families. Young men are fleeing Honduras to escape being pressed into gangs or murdered, which seems sensible.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell ... facts. Please use them. Part time work increased after Obamacare, but NOT NEARLY as much as your statement implies. It has always been the case that people work most of the year and still subsist on food stamps.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell We’re using billions of $ to bail out big agro due to tariffs and we still see no concrete benefit from them.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell They’re civilians, for one, not soldiers. Two, half of them are women. Three, there are children in that caravan. Four, because they’re fleeing what amounts to a civil war and are seeking asylum, which is completely legal.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell And most people on food stamps have jobs and work for 2/3 of the year. If these people took jobs in the field (which pay LESS, usually only $12k/yr) they wouldn’t be better off.
@SandraSBreen @macheels @AuthorJCHowell 1, that’s not the type of visa I’m talking about in my tweet. It’s a very specific visa that’s often difficult for employers to get, and that difficulty is why employers will use illegal immigrants instead. 2, that’s not how immigration into the US works
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell We exploit for this work isn’t available because we aren’t willing to extend the specific visas needed to bring them over legally.

@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell To keep prices artificially low. One consequence of lowering immigration numbers is that we currently have a shortage of migrant fieldworkers; the work isn’t suited to most Americans due to low wages, backbreaking work, and lack of year-around work, but the migrant workforce (2)
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell But we need to make sure that our responses don’t dip into extremism. Many of those crossing our southern border are doing it out of desperation and intend to seek asylum; we also have a migrant work force driving our agriculture that is largely illegal and that we rely on (1)
@macheels @AuthorJCHowell @SandraSBreen And China should be held responsible. But we shouldn’t make the mistake of thinking our way or our interests are always the correct ones.

@AuthorJCHowell @macheels @SandraSBreen American Nationalism isn’t better because you put ‘America’ in it. We should always be wary of when our protectionist policies turn downright dangerous or cruel.
@AuthorJCHowell @SandraSBreen That makes literally no sense other than as a way to plug your book. Language can’t crumble unless it is being actively oppressed and it’s speakers forced to assimilate to another culture. We can learn about the history surrounding those historic works just fine.
@SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell @macheels Nazism also grew from hate. They drew direct ideas from American practices at the time.
@SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell The revolutionaries were largely slavers who actively supported the genocide of native Americans. Understanding that the US has made mistakes is an act of more pride and love than the blind obeisance that you proudly profess.
@AuthorJCHowell @SandraSBreen I understand what I am. That’s why we have words for it.
@SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell @POTUS Trump’s administration is trying to create a policy for government agencies that discludes trans people from civil rights protections and consideration, as well as anyone born with questionable genitals, starting with the HHS. Trump VERY CLEARLY sees queer people as ‘other’.
@SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell The ability to describe one’s self gives context and agency to those feelings. Being able to say ‘I’m queer’ doesn’t put me in a box, since the difference is already evident. It allows me to defend my own feelings from those who would say that they don’t exist.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell My dad’s a conservative with three gay kids he loves. It’s not surprising at all.

@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell The Sinema comment is from 2003, and it was clearly not a message of support but rather trying to redirect a conversation thread that was going to push her into making a comment she didn’t want to commit to. The recent election then took it out of context and blew it up.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell I’m queer. I’ve listened to dozens of GOP members lambast people like me for years. Mike Pence supports conversion therapy. There is nothing these women could say that the GOP hasn’t already, including that gays have Satan in us (R. Bachmann).
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell They’re literally defining gender in their policies to disclude trans people. That is a thing that is happening right now that directly effects me and people that I love. That is ONE recent incident of many more, and they espouse other beliefs that they don’t act on.
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell There are issues born from people on each side; the issue is that the GOP’s policies are FAR more likely to kill me than the Dem’s. I like living. I like politicians that don’t insult me because of how I identify and who I love. I’m a liberal bc I don’t want to die like Matt Shep
@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell The GOP is currently working to remove civil rights protections from trans ppl. They’ve driven corporate tax cuts over middle class tax cuts.

@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell Gods above and below, that’s NOT what fascism is. Liberals aren’t even telling you what to believe - most simply want basic decency for ALL people, and for everyone to live well, not just survive. For everyone to be respected, not just some people.

@macheels @SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell Fascism grows from nationalism. This isn’t an opinion; it is accepted fact that fascism builds on extreme nationalism.

@SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell @POTUS Trump isn’t, though. His administration is hostile towards what he considers outgroup associated members - immigrants, queer people, PoC - despite two of those groups containing US citizens. If he were doing this for love of America he would support CR and equality. He doesn’t.
@SandraSBreen @AuthorJCHowell Nationalism is directly related to fascists movements. It’s an in-group/out-group relationship determiner.
