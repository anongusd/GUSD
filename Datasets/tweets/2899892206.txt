@1_newsnet Reparations = repair. Mending a wound. Making amends. Atonement for a crime committed. Repair, what was damaged. Restoration, to make whole what was broken. Redress, to set right, to remedy. Compensate for injury caused. In the form of: Land, resources, dollars. Trillons of them.
@PoINews2 Slavery was an American institution. Systemic racism is an American institution. None who call America home will be exempt from the cost of repair. As all Germans pay taxes to repair Jews, so much all Americans pay to restore #ADOS.

@IndyMama8 I'm about to get on that tip family..tired of explaining. Shit they getting affirmative action, and every other civil right benefit #ADOS had fought and died for...the gravy train is over.

@Grand_Cru1 Makes #ADOS no difference. Change can be difficult, but you will adjust.
@Grand_Cru1 We are defining ourselves, and others will have to deal with that.
@IndyMama8 Sneak attacks by disgruntled Africans screaming death to #ADOS lol
@Grand_Cru1 @Kazlu2 @Folk671 @Tyler11711 @B1Lieutenant @CoonBustersNews #ADOS is the proof. Do you think this is a accident, or something that sprung up overnight. For decades #ADOS has sat back and watched the immigrant take over our neighborhoods, our jobs, ect ect. Some now have the audacity to claim they are us, while segregating themselves.
@Kazlu2 @Folk671 @Tyler11711 @Grand_Cru1 @B1Lieutenant @CoonBustersNews Go tell the South Africcan how we will never be united. If you're not telling them, don't tell us.
@Grand_Cru1 @Kazlu2 @Folk671 @Tyler11711 @B1Lieutenant @CoonBustersNews Your true colors are showing. #ADOS are used to fighting up hill battles remember? We are the reason immigrants are free to choose to come here.
@Grand_Cru1 Why would I sit back and allow natives to be ignored? Why would I allow anyone to benefit off my ancestors toil, who has no connection to chattle slavery? Why would allow a group who's culture is not mine, to appropriate my culture, and not show respect?
@Grand_Cru1 Do not pretend that the native African are the same as the newly arrived. We are different.  America is not Africa. Africa is not Jamaica. Jamaica is not Brazil. Each have a unique history of slavery. This is the home of #ADOS. We are in a fight here. You are either a ally or not

@Jem758 @BreakingBrown Our fight is the same. Of this I have no question. I thank you for taking the time voice your concerns and listen to my own.
@divadanad @RepCummings I hear you. But all must be judged by the content of their character. Are we not striving to be a more perfect union? If so, we must expect, we must demand more from those we choose to lead.
@Jem758 @BreakingBrown For me, all Presidents have been a threat to blacks. We have been under attack from moment the first colonial ship arrived, from the moment the first slave stepped foot on this soil. Our fight is against the system of white supremacy in total.

@divadanad @RepCummings The symbolism of hate must and will be fought against..and all who stand as the face that hate.
@Jem758 @BreakingBrown Why not join the fight to change the order of things. Why not fight to make the black vote stand for something greater than mere symbolism. Why not support the descendant of American chattel slavery in a fight to recieve what is owed. Why not view this as a first step for us all.
@Jem758 @BreakingBrown I see no divide. Just as I see no divide when our people of the Caribbean form an alliance among their own, or those in Jamaica petition for redress of crimes committed against them. I celebrate it, seek to be the best ally I can, but I can not ask to be included in their claim.

@Jem758 @BreakingBrown Blacks here are fighting for our very survival. This should be enough for all who claim African descent to rally behind. Africans the world over are petitioning for reparations, for land and their humanity. I have and will continue to fight for the complete liberation of us all.

@RebelYellin65 I sense the same. Some of these people have been sitting here on Twitter for years, getting nothing accomplished. Engaged in perpetual history debates. But the moment blacks begin to challenge the order of things, they tell us no, you are attempting to stand incorrectly.
