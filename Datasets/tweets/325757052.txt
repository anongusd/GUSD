@Writedancespeak Department officials told us today this was the earliest in recent memory footage was released. And it was an effort to calm things down.
@byldonovan Don't think it's a change in policy, but practice for sure. City policy says release should happen w/i 60 days unless contested - don't think that means they can't release sooner.
Here is partial footage of fatal shooting by Chicago police Saturday. The investigation continues, and this is not all the footage or evidence. But department release of any footage this soon is highly unusual. https://t.co/jSnyD9X1vo

Davis atty closing short; she told judge Davis no longer that 14 yr old,  spoke of 'sea change' in thinking on juvenile justice.
Hearing ends after 11 hours. Judge taking case under advisement. No sentence.
Prosecutor wraps up spirited closing; offers little sympathy for Aldolfo Davis' troubled youth; said others had it worse.
@jmikelyons thanks for following. Judge has not indicated. But I will be here if it happens.
At 915, closings still going at Adolfo Davis hearing at 26th St. I'm still here - and so are about 30 others. Two sleeping.
For anyone still following -Adolfo Davis just addressed the court. "I'm just praying you find it in your heart to give me a second chance."
Prison counselor takes stand as first witness for Davis. He was rehabilitated and expressed regret and remorse, she said.
Davis' alleged prison misdeeds - illegal wine, assaults, passing messages for fellow GDs in 2013. Last one maybe most problematic.
Overall institutional adjustment issues - so says IDOC official on Davis. But witnesses who saw turnaround expected too.
Just brief breaks here at Adolfo Davis sentencing. IDOC official now testifying about Davis behavior behind bars.
But more critical is this witness testimony that Adolfo Davis had a gun. And fired. Davis attorneys dispute this.
Unusual aspect of Davis re-sentencing - victim recalls 20-year old scene. As shots rang out, he ducks for cover.
Davis attorneys counter: age matters; he was follower with a 'desperate need' to belong. 20 years later, he is reformed.
RT @JeremyGorner: City official: The Feds join Cook County prosecutors in the probe of a Chicago cop who killed a teen last year, shooting …

@DavePardo Thanks very much, Dave.
@SIWeather Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it.
#Blago, standing next to composed but saddened Patti: This is a time to be strong, a time to fight through adversity.
#Blago after court: He and Patti will fight through this adversity. For now they want to get home to their girls.
Courtroom floor cleared. Media and onlookers scatter to lobby. Await reaction from both sides.
After sentence: Tearful Patti buried head in #Blago's right shoulder and they embraced.
#Blago scheduled to surrender Feb. 16.
Court is adjourned.
#Blago not likely to report to prison until February.
#Blago: 14 years in prison.
Judge seems to be gathering steam as he says #Blago's crimes eroded public trust and confidence.
Judge: Accepts #Blago apology for turning criminal charges and court fight into contest of personalities between #Blago and the government.
#Blago Judge sympathetic to children of felons who suffer but wonders: "Why did devotion as a father not deter him? ... Now it is too late."
Judge: #Blago made the decisions, not advisers. "He marched them and ruined a few of their careers and more than that in the process."
Judge: #Blago didn't get bad advice from advisers as he has said -- he never asked for legal advice. It would have been "a simple question."
Judge Zagel speaks: Did #Blago accept responsibility? And did he do it too late?
"There’s several things I have to say," Judge Zagel says. He will then sentence #Rod Blagojevich.
Court is in session.
Court is about to resume.
#Blago is softly rubbing Patti's back, touching her cheek and massaging her shoulders as they chat, awaiting Judge's return.
On a short recess from #Blago, who kissed Patti's head after finishing his remarks to Judge Zagel.
#Blago's final words to Judge Zagel: "I would hope you would find some mercy."	Court is in recess.
#Blago pauses after emotionally describing how his children have nowhere to hide from what he has brought upon them.
#Blago: "I have nobody to blame but myself for my stupidity."
#Blago's final apology: To his family.
"This is a dad bragging about his daughter." #Blago tells judge that while not relevant, daughter Amy is No. 2 in her class, an inspiration.
#Blago now talking of explaining guilty verdict to his distraught daughters.
"It turned out my belief was wrong," #Blago said of a promise to his daughter that he would fight the charges.
#Blago is sorry for disrupting his brother's (who was caught up in investigation) "happy quiet life" in Nashville.
#Blago moved by judge's remarks yesterday that #Blago seemed to see this as "duel" with the govt.
Apologies continue: #Blago sorry for fighting the case in the media and challenging the prosecutors.
#Blago apologizes: I am here convicted of crimes. I am accepting of it. I acknowledge it. And I am of course am unbelievably sorry for it.
#Blago is about to speak to Judge Zagel.
Govt pleads for strong sentence: "The people have had enough of this defendant they have had enough of those who are corrupt like him."
As he is labeled manipulative, #Blago shakes his head: No.
Govt: #Blago's corruption was "perverse and unbound." And he has never shown remorse.
Govt says #Blago "amazingly" tried to manipulate jurors: peppered testimony with personal references to their background.
Schar in low voice of #Blago: "He is incredibly manipulative and he knows how to be."
Schar comes out swinging. Says #Blago caused real harm: "The criminal behavior corrupted the decision-making process in Illinois."
Early interruption by Judge Zagel: "The ink in my govt pen has run out." Laughter follows and prosecutor Reid Schar resumes remarks.
Court is in session.
#Blago appears looser today. Joking with press.
#Rod and Patti Blagojevich just walked into courtroom holding hands. She patted him on the back as he walked to the defense table.
Crowds have swelled a bit on Day 2 of #Blago's sentencing. About 50 spectators lined up outside courtroom. Not counting media.
#Blago sentencing to resume in about 40 minutes. We're back with live updates. What happened yesterday: http://t.co/Zi0emKgp
Hearing concludes. Resumes at 10 a.m. Wednesday.
Defense ends by quoting #Patti Blagojevich: Please be merciful. Asks for lowest sentence the law allows.
#Blagojevich's daughter: Her life has been spinning out of control. She needs her father; will need him again when her heart gets broken.
Atty Aaron Goldstein gives personal testimony: #Blago expressed deep concern to Goldstein when his father passed away.
Videotape testimony: Woman thanks #Blago for providing free rides for seniors. "I know that the Lord is going to be with you," she said.
The short snippets highlight how #Blago's confidants were "cheering him on" and encouraging him to see "what he could get," Goldstein said.
Defense attys playing portions of taped calls from trial. They don't absolve him of crimes but shed light and add perspective, they said.
Sorosky: "Mr. Blagojevich was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth ... it gave him a certain drive. It gave him a certain insecurity."
Defense atty Sheldon Sorosky takes over: #Blago maybe used “John Wayne manhood language” but crimes don’t deserve 15 to 20 years in prison.
Update: Once back, Goldstein tells judge that #Blago might have been a shark but he wasn't  swimming with guppies.
Buzzing feedback halts proceedings. Defense attorney Aaron Goldstein: "People texting while I'm talking? I can't believe that, judge."
Judge stops defense to ask what sentence they want: Lowest sentence  possible, they say. (Govt. seeking between 15 and 20 years.)
"Mr. Blagojevich should not be punished for historic corruption. He is an individual," Gurland said, noting state's troubling reputation.
Corrected: Patti Blagojevich looks down as her husband is called a good dad and father. #Blago's head also down, lips pursed.
On reality TV: Defense says couple was paid "handsomely to be made fun of and ridiculed." They "allowed" this to keep home and pay tuition.
On his constant public remarks: #Blago tried to maintain his "honor and strength" in the face of the charges he faced, defense says.
#Blagojevich family is "closer now than ever before,"  constantly together, Gurland tells court.
#Blago atty Carolyn Gurland resumes comments, turning "very important" reason to show him mercy: Long sentence will devastate his family.
#Blago just returned to courtroom, kissed Patti on her cheek and turned to confer with his attorneys. Afternoon session starts any minute.
#Blago hearing pauses for lunch break.
Judge Zagel queries defense on #Blago's assertion "he came from nothing." Says immigrant family was in tact, a reflection of American dream.
"Mr. Blagojevich is a kind and compassionate man." The defense begins to tell the story of #Rod Blagojevich.
#Rod Blagojevich followed the law as he understood it, defense argues. He was seeking campaign donations not "cash in envelopes."
Did #Blago financially harm the state? Did he receive any money? No, his attys argue. This corruption case is "absolutely unique," they say.
Brief testimony from doctor already over -- defense begins what it calls a "powerful argument for leniency."
The defense has called a pediatrician to talk about #Blago's All Kids program, which provides health care to uninsured Illinois children.
Court is back in session.
Zagel corrected quote on #Blago: "Frankly I don't think he was an easy man to stop."
And #Blago hearing is in short recess.
As the judge ruled against #Blago on both key issues -- cash and leadership -- he slumped in his chair, head tilted to right.
Judge Zagel on what he heard from #Blago on tapes: “Frankly I don’t think he was an easy many to stop. His tone of voice was demanding.”
Patti Blagojevich's family sits close to each other, leaning into each other and with arms around her as hearing continues.
Zagel not buying #Blago’s story/testimony on the Lisa Madigan Sen. deal: “I think this is untrue. I thought it was untrue when he said it.”
Judge Zagel on the $1.5 million #Blago sought for a Senate seat appt: "It was a price he put on it. The price he expected to receive."
Judge Zagel now starting his ruling on the guidelines issue alone ...
Judge Zagel and defense atty Carolyn Gurland debating whether #Blago was a leader. Using coffee-order metaphors.
Prosecution on #Blago: He was the leader: "He did decide. He just didn't get what he wanted."
Govt. says evidence "bountiful" and numbers clear as to what #Blago hoped to earn in the scam. It's all over the tapes.
#Blago scribbling notes; Patti Blagojevich eyes judge as defense wraps arguments on cash and leadership role. The prosecution begins ...
Was #Blago a leader of this conspiracy? Defense has moved onto that question, arguing no.
They are talking money first. How much money did #Blago try to gain? Defense arguing zero.
Judge Zagel begins with determining what the federal guidelines are. Defense is beginning now.
Court has started. Gavel just hit three times.
Patti #Blagojevich sits in front row, her brother and sister by her side.
#Blagojevich, dark suit and tie, walked into the ceremonial courtroom, making eye contact with reporters, nodded hello.
Minutes from starting: Rod Blagojevich leans down to his wife, sitting in first row: "I love you."
Low-key arrival? #Blago is rumored to have slipped past shivering and disappointed media ...  no grand entrance as in the past.
Helicopters are hovering at the courthouse. #Blago must be close?
See Trib's take on how things will unfold today from vet federal reporter Jeff Coen. http://t.co/3VdEoMl2
Good morning from the Dirksen building, where some 20 people are lined up for #Blago's sentencing. A few diehards here at 3 a.m.
@cc3140: It will be interesting for sure - stay tuned.
Will do. Always seeking the spirit.
At the last #Blagojevich hearing before sentencing. Judge predicts it will go two days.
Just in ... Blagojevich attorneys weigh in on his upcoming sentencing, calling him a "tragic figure" who deserves a compassionate sentence.
Govt seeks15 to 20 years for Blagojevich's "extended and extremely damaging" behavior. http://t.co/RvfcCyqy
