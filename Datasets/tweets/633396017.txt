@taytayheartsu TAYLOR!!!I miss you too!!! I can't wait to hang out with you (and hopefully Maila too) when I get back! :-)
I haven't had contact with anyone back home in over a week. It gets pretty lonely when you only have two senior citizens to converse with.
Today's the last day of 2012, so sad. So many amazing things happened in 2012, def my favorite year but I hope 2013 can somehow be better.
Making my New Years Resolution List. I'm really excited for 2013, it's either going to be absolutely amazing or completely crap.	#LivingLife
Yes. I bought so much bargain stuff than was necessary. http://t.co/Xx6KnEU
I HATE the morning. You make me get up at 8. I HATE breakfast. We go to breakfast. I HATE the cold. Its cold. Don't expect me to be happy.
Late night deep thinking. I try to lie in bed at least once a month &amp; just think about well everything. Tonight is just one of those nights.

Fact: I haven't spent Christmas in Fort Worth in over 6 years now. I wonder what it's like.	Hmmm, maybe I should change that next Christmas.
@MeBeNicole96 Merry Christmas Nicole! I am having fun in Chicago but I miss home. It's not snowing here but theres still some on the ground.
I'm so happy it's snowing in Fort Worth! Even though I'm not there I can still feel the excitement. "It's a Christmas Murakle."
MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!!!!!	I hope y'all have an amazing time with loved ones and that Santa is generous to you!
How is it Christmas Eve already?!?	How is it almost 2013 already?

Making it out of Texas is always half of every trip. Almost in Ar-Kansas!
Leaving Fort Worth now, nine hours of driving to go until Memphis!	#WinterBreakRoadTripToChicago
I feel pretty bad for leaving home &amp; all my friends to visit my grandparents in Chicago starting tomorrow but I'll be back on January 3rd.
@THE_SWAN_QUEEN CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I'm super proud. UT is a great place &amp; I'd love to see you in Austin! (absolutely no pressure intended)
I planned on going to the school tomorrow, but I heard all the non-Seniors are taking a writing test. Still, maybe I might drop by.
I remember last year when I really couldn't think of anything I wanted for Christmas. But then college hit and my list is overflowing.
Going to the movies for the first time since forever ago... by myself. #ForeverAlone	It feels so nice to be home on break.	#CollegeFree
After driving for 3 hours, No I don't want to come pick you up! Sorry but I'm not your only friend. Stop taking advantage of me, thankskbye.
I'm heading home for my fabulous month-long winter break!
I'm going home tomorrow!!! I'm going home tomorrow!!! I'm so excited to go home!
My last final is over, I'm officially done with my first semester of college. Too many mixed emotions. All I know is I'm ready for break!
Wonderful, I sneezed so loud that one of the neighbors called the cops thinking someone was being beaten. #ExcuseMeOfficerImJustSick........
Scratch that, I've sneezed 87 times today. Being sick makes me tired but I can't go to sleep cause I have to blow my nose every 20 minutes.
Just sneezed for the 50th time today (yes I kept count). Life milestone achieved.	#SickProblems #OfCourseIWouldGetSick #ThisIsWhyIHateWinter
Tomorrow I finish my semester at UT. I've already made a huge reflection Facebook post for once I finish my last final.
ALL I WANT IS TO JUST BE HOME ALREADY. Instead of being sick in Austin with all of my friends having left already.
I'm sick &amp; I have nothing to do today besides wishing I get to go home &amp; start winter break already. UT, why are you 3 hours away from home?
Oh how I've missed being able to use the internet on something other than my phone.
My (current) roommate is the nicest person I've met since I've been here at UT. I honestly don't know how to tell him that I'm moving out.
I never have to do another chemistry problem in my life again ever!	This fact makes me incredibly happy.
@tayloredooo ME TOO! I almost failed the computer science final. :| I'm definitely never doing that shit again.
@tayloredooo Thank You!!! I'll definitely need it. After today I'll never ever ever have to do Chemistry again in my life. IM SO EXCITED.
@MeBeNicole96 I tried to plan on being home for a while during the holidays, I got busy real fast. I'm trying to work something out though.
One hour until my only "real" final for Chemistry which is 3 hours long. I need to make a 85 for an A, that would make my semester.
I'm so disappointed that I won't be able to come home until Tuesday next week! And then I'm only gonna be home for 3 days. Sad holidays :-(
Happy 12/12/12! Enjoy it because it's the last day for 89 years we'll have an all-matching date... that is if we survive 12/21/12 in 9 days.
Horray for finishing an essay at 11:40, having computer problems, trying to send on my phone, &amp; driving to a closed Starbucks to find wifi!
I FINALLY SAW THE ALBINO SQUIRREL!!! Yay, good luck for the rest of the semester even though its only one week.
My roommate messaged me asking if I'm still alive. Hmmm, I guess I haven't seen him in a week. What do I reply? "Umm, yeah I'm alive. Lolz."
Dear girl who left her key in English,	I was trying to be nice &amp; save you $75 so stop bitching at me because I cant meet you at 1AM. Thanks.
Nevermind, I passed with an A but after 8 hours trying to write a code, I think I deserve it for effort.
Just failed my first class, guys.	Computer Programming is the worst class ever, glad I get to take it again next semester.
So my last semester assignment is to make a mix tape CD to exchange in English tomorrow but...
TOMORROW IS THE LAST DAY OF CLASSES!!!!! Whether I like it or not, I'm done with this semester (besides 2 finals) 5PM tomorrow. FINALLY!!!!!
Happy last day of the class I hate the most!
I feel like crawling in a hole and playing possum until tomorrow after 5.	This semester has not been kind to me at all.
Of course you would assign us another paper due next Tuesday even though our last class is Friday. Why am I so surprised?
One hour until the last Chem exam = super mega study cram time. Thermodynamics, of all things, why thermodynamics?
I'm at the word limit for my paper. Can I just stop mid-sentence &amp; write, 	"&lt;---Here's the 1000 words of BS you requested, give me an A"?
@tayloredooo Thank you Taylor! Good luck to you!	We should definitely hang out over break, I need people to help me forget this semester.
Tonight is the last night I'll stress about homework for probably 2 months. This week needs to be over SOON! #endofsemester #winterbreak
The moment when you have to tell your roommate that youre moving out in a few days while trying to make it least awkward as possible. Hmm...
This week continually keeps getting better. Hopefully it will remain that way until Friday.
Texas: The land that winter forgot ... at least this year.
@mmailacaspee I'm glad you liked my truck, you'll see it again. Last night with you &amp; @taytayheartsu was so fun! Cant wait for next weekend!
@THE_SWAN_QUEEN I'm so glad that you enjoyed my surprise and that we fit to sit and talk with @Manduh_Goob I've missed y'all so much!
@mmailacaspee Oh no, I'm soooo sorry my phone died while I was out :((. But my number is 817-899-0666.
@mmailacaspee @mmailacaspee Umm, sort of... well Yeah. Somehow I ended up in Benbrook yesterday because my Monday classes got canceled!
Benbrook Christmas Tree Lighting at Castle Park!!! Excited to surprise some people!
@mmailacaspee Definitely! I'd love to go with y'all.	Haha, at UT when I say I'm from FtWorth people say "I went there to go to Billy Bob's!"
@mmailacaspee I seriously can't wait to come home! I'm so excited to hang out with you and Taylor winter break!!!
Calculus ALWAYS makes me super tired every class. My teacher is geat and the class isn't boring but it always happens for some reason.
I sort of feel bad about sleeping through my Chem class since I haven't gone for the last 4 classes now... but I'll just watch it online.
I'm so bad at meeting and trying to converse with people at UT, especially students. Everyone is either really intimdating or too busy.
I'm so tired in every way possible. This semester needs to be over soon.	#WhyDoIHaveSoMuchWorkLeftToDo?
@mmailacaspee I'm coming back on Saturday the 15th!.	When are you done at UTA??	#SisterFromAnotherMister
@mmailacaspee Yes! I knew I had a twin out there somewhere!	OMG, I LOVE ice skating, especially with amazing people!! Lets do it!!!! :)
Words can't describe the anger I feel towards my programming instructor right now. Thanks for making me waste 2 hours for literally NOTHING.
@mmailacaspee It's so difficult, right? I finally finished though.	Yay, we are totally alike! We have to do something over winter break! :D
I. hate. computer. programming. 4. life.	There's literally no class I've had before that I hate so much.
I'm very bad at editing and finding flaws in others' writing because its always point of view and who am I to tell them they're wrong?
Can someone please tell me why it's 75 degrees in (almost) winter?	#texasprobz
So much homework left to finish............... Thanksgiving break spoiled me.	Getting ready for finals season, it's gonna be a long 2 weeks.
By the way, I made it back to Austin now unless you couldn't tell.
If one more person asks me about my trip back to DALLAS Imma cut somebody. You've known me for 3 months, I LIVE IN FORT WORTH! Get it right.
I'm starting back to Austin now. :-(	But I really needed and enjoyed my Thanksgiving mini-break at home!	See you in a few weeks Benbrook.
@MeBeNicole96 Ummmm, I should be done at church around 12:30 so anytime after that is great, like maybe 1 or 1:30?
@MeBeNicole96 Oh, yes I did. Sorry about that I was busy and forgot to reply.
Last night of break before returning to college for 2 weeks, scary! But spent well with @taytayheartsu @Panchitaaa32 &amp; @lueyvattonbrown .
Luey and I almost just got into a fight with a grown-ass man. #ThugLife
TRAPPED IN THE CLOSET CHAPTERS 24-33!!!!!!!! ERMAHGAWD, I'VE WAITING TOO LONG.
I'm watching Lockup and my grandparents' neighbor comes on and says, "Prison gangs are a lot like college fraternities only more dangerous."
@mmailacaspee LOL! I asked myself the same question (well, UTA fan if I go to UT) before I began at UT and I think so!
Well, it's not such a good day to be a Longhorn from Fort Worth. Oh well, no one knows me at college anyway. Still, go UT!
RT @NICKIMINAJ: Have a happy, safe, and blessed Thanksgiving! Xo
Praise Jesus this school week is over. Even though it's been the shortest, it was definitely the worst too. Now I'm gonna SLEEP!
HAPPY THANKSGIVING! I finally got home, I've missed Benbrook/Fort Worth so much. I never want to leave again, but I have class monday so...
@mmailacaspee Girl, if you love Nicki we'll get along great!	Nicki &amp; I are getting married! Her songs are always in my head. #we'reawesome
@mmailacaspee Haha, Benbreezy is where the white kids at Hills said we're from to sound thug.	No, I haven't slept yet but hopefully soon!
There's something about listening/rapping to Nicki Minaj for 3 hours straight while driving home that diminishes my frustrations. #TheReUp
I'm almost home! I can't wait, Benbreezy, here I come. I'M ALMOST HOME!!!!!
I've beaten my all time record... 48 hours and counting. When I crash, I'm gonna crash hard but got to finish this paper first.
41 Hours awake.... I'm starting to get worried, why am I not tired?!? I think I'll literally sleep ALL Thursday.
@mmailacaspee You're right! College is super challenging but I'm doing okay in most classes. How do you like UTA?
@mmailacaspee I want to so badly! I can't wait to get back home tomorrow, I've been waiting forever to see y'all!
I am so ready to get today over with.	#36HoursAwake #StrangelyNotTired	#IHateWritingPapers	#LetMeGoHomeAlready	#ForcedInsomnia	#GoingInsane
Guys, I haven't slept in 31 hours and I still have another paper to write....	I don't know why I'm not tired at all.
An hour and a half to write about 1000 words. Seems pretty impossible, but let's see how close I can get. Ready, Set, GO!	#TermPaper
@MeBeNicole96 Yay, I'm super excited! If you two want a ride, I'll gladly pick y'all up. Can't wait!
I really don't think I'm going to get this essay done on time... I hate writing meaningless papers.

@MeBeNicole96 Sure! I should be free Friday, Saturday, or Sundayif you're free. I'd love to have lunch with y'all!
You know that one time during the semester when you have two papers due and a midterm within 24 hours, that's me beginning Tuesday. #NoSleep
Me and the UT community aka Asians! (Too bad half of them left, but you still get the point.) http://t.co/XQcO98x
I need Wednesday to be here now so I can just go home and not be here anymore. We haven't had a day of break in over 2 months! #5MoreDays
A hobo just asked me if I could "spare a dollar for some weed". Oh, Austin hobos, at least they're honest.
My Asian friend is making me go with her to an Asian "party" tomorrow. I love Asians but I'll be the only white person there AGAIN #Totesawk
Tomorrow is Friday. This week is almost over! Leading to the worst weekend ever: Two major papers, Prep for Calc Midterm, other homework....
Can I major in YouTube? Is that possible? Because that's what ends up taking all my time. Sorry Mechanical Engineering, sorry Plan II.
Excited to see Laura &amp; Barbara Bush (First Ladies) tomorrow at UT! I'm sure it will be a civil discussion but I'm hoping for a cat fight.
Next Friday. After 4 years. The Story Continues. I'm so ready.	Trapped in the Closet Chapters 24-37 on Black Friday (coincidence?)	#Trapped

Look ho, you can't just come up in this joint and lower the thermostat to 66 without asking no one and leave 2 minutes later. #OhHellsNaw
Jets flew over UT today between classes and everyone stopped to look up in amazement. Please that's everyday life in Fort Worth.
I enjoy going to campus events, but why am I always the only "white" person attending? It's sort of awkward but oh well. #PartyingwithAsians
@GreyWolf09 Good, you know I wouldn't offend you of all people.	Also, can't wait to hopefully see you when I come home for Thanksgiving.
@GreyWolf09 Sorry Will I didn't mean it like that. Military is a type of school, and its much better than my friend literally doing nothing.
Reading a book:	9:45 - Page 41	12:07 - Page 69	Assigned reading does not hold my attention.
I'm glad that friends who aren't going to college or school are bragging about their awesome, carefree life to me. Let's just wait 5 years.
@MeBeNicole96 I'm planning on Tuesday night through Sunday, but it's subject to change.
@MeBeNicole96 Aww, I miss you too. Umm, yeah I'm coming home for Thanksgiving, I've been waiting for this break all semester!
@MeBeNicole96 Haha, youre right! Looking back as a sophomore I was much more awkward than now. And awkwardness is a word, I looked it up. :)
I really try not to be awkward, but that only ends up making me so much more awkward. Story of my social life, especially at college.
Gurl, don't message me at 8:28 and tell me to meet you across campus at 8:30 cause it ain't gonna happen..............................Heffa.
@tayloredooo Oh believe me, girl you're not the only one! It doesn't make any sense at all! I have nightmares about writing programs.
@tayloredooo I feel the same way, COMPUTER SCIENCE is the worst subject ever created I've been doing comp sci all weekend. #Ihatethisshit

@tayloredooo YES, thank bujeezus! I haven't met him yet and I don't know when he's moving in but he seems super awesome!

@tayloredooo Me too! If we thought this election was intense just wait. We'll be 22 and edgumacated college grads. I can't wait!

@MeBeNicole96 Yeah, I heard y'all were heading south for competition this weekend. I'll should get there between 3 and 4 so we'll see.
@MeBeNicole96 For Friday afternoon through Sunday night! I'm going to try and make it for the end of school on Friday to see people.

I think the best friend I've made so far in my time at UT is the very nice Hispanic "lunch lady" at Kinsolving, today she gave me a hug.

It's Sushi Night at our cafeteria! I'm going to be here literally all night. I miss food diversity so much.
Skyping with @taytayheartsu was definintely the highlight of my week so far. I can't wait to see her &amp; everyone else back home in two days!
Today I woke up thinking it was Friday until I realized I had a Calculus class = instantly disappointed.
All I'm looking forward to this week is going back home for homecoming on Friday. I can't wait to see my favorite people in one place again.
About to take my first college test (in Chemistry). I hope those hours of studying will actually make a difference.
Even though I have 5 classes it seems like my world constantly revolves around calculus. 15 hours a week... seems like 200.	#nomegusta
Finally Fort Worth-bound after surviving UT bomb threats. 3 hours of waiting followed by 3 hours of driving. Yay!
@MeBeNicole96 Aww, I miss my Whiz Quiz team SO MUCH!! I hope y'all are getting hyped up for the season. Whose on the team this year?
@MeBeNicole96 Wait, what feels different? I assume you're talking about Whiz Quiz but I could be mistaken.
@Holla1tsKarla Really, I haven't met anyone else. I told one girl I was from Ft Worth &amp; she said "Oh, you mean mini-Dallas". NO, FORT WORTH!
Someone just told me "Happy 9/11".	Ummm no, what's wrong with you?	That's like saying "Happy Hiroshima Day" in Japan.	Learn some respect.
I'm very glad I listen with my ear to the door before I enter my room because something pretty ugly is going on in there right now.
Over 6 hours of calculus today, my brain feels like mush and I still have to read 40 pages of two books for tomorrow.	#collegeprobz
Can't wait until I get to go back to Benbrook on Friday and see Beauty &amp; the Beast again! Hopefully it'll be a enjoyable 2.5 days.
Good news guys, I'm not going to die!
This is how people get killed, abducted, raped, shot, stabbed, drowned, beaten, held captive, robbed, tortured, and/or sold into slavery.
Most awkward situation ever: ditching a party with a friend whose car loses battery in an Austin park ... at 2:00 am.	#CollegeAdventures
I miss interacting with black people, there definitely aren't enough at UT.
Plan II Convocation was tonight, I'm officially a Plan II student. I'm beginning to realize that my college experience is IB on steroids.
I drove 8 hours this weekend from Austin to Benbrook. My calculus professor says thats how long we should spend on his work over weekends.
Wee, that was a huge waste of my time.	Looks like I'm heading to BenBreezy at the crack of dawn tomorrow.
Darn interview, I really wanted to go home this weekend. I miss Benbrook really, really, really badly. Austin's great but home is Benbrook.
Finished my first UT Football game. It's true what they say, you've never been to a real football game until you've been to a UT game.
My first week of college is over, a half-week went by fast. Now to enjoy the only holiday until Thanksgiving, while doing tons of homework.
My roomate and I have been in our room for 4 hours and we've avoided communication for about 3 hours, 58 minutes. Welcome to my new life.
So. Much. Homework. I don't even know where to start. Good thing none of it's due until after the weekend. Thank you, Labor Day!
College Day 1 = Complete	Only about 100 more to go until the end of semester.	4 classes tomorrow....... wonderful.
I seriously cannot believe my first day of classes is tomorrow, it's ridiculous how old I feel.
@Holla1tsKarla Yeah, I'm going to get there around 8:15. We'll definitely get a picture together there!
Apparently I suck at making friends someplace where nobody knows me, I don't know what I'd do without Karla and Sheridan.
I feel like I'm living a similar repeat of my life 4 years ago as a high school freshman, only this time it's worse.
Happy First Day of School to all of my favorite people back home, have fun &amp; enjoy the year! 	Two more days until college here.
The smoke detector in room 420 keeps going off, hahahaha best coincidence I've heard in forever.
I have officially arrived in Austin and moving in in 12 hours.
I'm very excited to see @asimALLday and possibly Beverly at UMHB on my way to Austin tomorrow! I miss high school friends so much already.
I think I'm nearly done packing but I still won't get any sleep trying to think of what else I need to bring. #movingout
Packing, packing, packing, packing, packing, packing, packing, packing, packing, packing, and more packing.
TOMORROW IS MY LAST FULL DAY IN FORT WORTH. I can't believe it; it was great to see my favorite non-graduated friends today though.
Today went well at the school, and I really needed that before another few hours of sadly packing.
@MeBeNicole96 That's okay, I'll be there tomorrow for sure either in the band/theatre hallway or somewhere around the band hall by 4:00. :)
@THE_SWAN_QUEEN YAY!! Okay I'll definitely be there at 3:30 sharp tomorrow, I'm very excited.
@THE_SWAN_QUEEN To my favorite new Senior, I couldn't imagine not seeing you before I leave, I'll find you soon, perhaps tomorrow. Marco ...
@MeBeNicole96 ... I'll come visit you but I don't want to interrupt the band stuff. Either way I'll see you somehow!
@MeBeNicole96 I know! I'm at WHHS all this week helping teachers so I'll either be in the theatre room or English hall. Come visit me or ...
@Holla1tsKarla I can't believe you're leaving tomorrow! College is actually happening, omg. Have fun at orientation and I'll see you there!
Finally going dorm shopping, although I'm still not even sure what to buy.
Why is it that whenever I look through pictures someone took at school I can always tell which teacher's room they're in?
I haven't had a conversation not about college or moving since about 3 weeks ago, it's consuming my life &amp; classes haven't even started yet.
@Panchitaaa32 Megan, I hope everything's going well with your move-in! Luey and I miss you like a ton but have fun &amp; enjoy college! :-)
I desperately wish my life was remotely interesting at this point. It feels like I'm just waiting to leave for college, just waiting around.
7 Days Remaining - A WEEK from now I'll be moving for the first time in with some stranger, there's so much to do and so little time left.
Eight more days - Got my boxes to start packing. By far busiest day of my summer in Texas, I actually have semi-conflicting plans for once.
Ten days left ... ten days left but I know it's going to be here like tomorrow.  Time flies when you don't want it to.
No that's okay, you don't have to come visit me like you said you would, just go and have fun without me. I'll be right here taking my meds.
They said numbness would ware off between 2-8 hours ... and it's been almost 10 and the left side of my mouth is still numb.
Half of my face has regained feeling for an hour and the other half is still numb, what's up with that?
Well, I think everything went well, but I'm still all drugged up to tell.
About to go into my first drugged operation, I guess I'll find out if novocaine really doesn't work on me.
Is it odd that I'm looking at children to adopt? I hope not they all look adorable, maybe in 15 years... or 10.
In 14 hours I'll be getting my wisdom teeth removed. I've never been drugged up before, so it'll definitely be a new experience.
I am often very ignorant of others' ignorance and for that I am truly sorry.
Exactly 2 weeks left before moving. My emotions vary about it but I'm mostly nervous, I've never had to live somewhere else before.
There are no words to accurately describe my hatred of chemistry, it's pointless &amp; nonsensical but I still have to learn it for some reason.
@MeBeNicole96 I miss you too! I'm trying to find a good reason to visit the band kids at school before I leave, so hopefully soon.
You just don't understand how angry I am at the 5 of you. I'll be gone in 16 days and it seems like you couldn't care less, so neither do I.
I'm pretty sure I just accidentally ran over an animal for the first time. Awww, rest in peace poor unfortunate rabbit. :-(
I just slept 15 hours and I still feel extremely tired and groggy.	This will probably be my life for the next 18 days.
@Holla1tsKarla Well, I've certainly missed Texas and most people here AND the heat. It feels nice to be home for the 19 remaining days.
Well, I've arrived in Texas.	It's so early here but so late in Hawaii, I'm caught between time zones &amp; for some reason I can't hardly talk.
Taking off, aloha Hawai'i.
Well it's my last day in Hawaii, I can't wait until I get to come back and live here.	T-minus 4 hours to take off.
Card shopping is always excruciatingly long and rarely successful.
Daily Learned Lesson: Never trust anyone over 50 to do something you ask. Even when you remind &amp; give them 3 chances, they'll still forget.
As of today, my feet, calves, knees, hands, forearms, cheeks, nose, ears, &amp; top of my head are sunburned.	Basically, I look like a tomato.
FACT: 70% of Americans have little to no appreciation of local culture, history, government or environment of the place in which they live.
I really want to watch the Olympics but each time I'm always on vacation where there's a huge time difference making it impossible.
I haven't eaten with silverware since I've been here, paradise.	#Chopsticksrule
Oh it's okay, I only haven't seen you in 8 years but it's okay if you want to back out of our plans it's completely fine, I understand......
Wow, I'm completely shocked...	I got asked to be the best man at my Hanai auntie/Island Mother's wedding on the North Shore, Spring 2014.
So my flight back to Texas leaves here at 5pm and lands at DFW at 5:20...am	#jetlag
Seeing people grow up makes me feel really old. 	Ah 18, 65 same difference.
@Holla1tsKarla You're my favorite too! 	People aggravate me so much, it's ridiculous ... 	But I can't wait until we get to hang out next! :)
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG, NOTHING HAPPENED, IM FINE! So stop asking why I'm sad or upset because I'm not, you're only making me mad by asking.
Hahahaha "YOTEO - you only turn 18 once" - @Holla1tsKarla 	Favorite quote of my birthday!	#YOTEO
Dear Islanders,	Please stop treating me like I'm an ignorant tourist/mainlander/howlie because I'm not.	Much appreciated,	Skyler
Apparently I'm officially an adult ... in Texas. I still have 5 more hours to wait in Hawaii.	#TimeDifferences
Hawaii is pretty much a part of Asia, the same overcrowding, traffic, &amp; Asians. The only American things are the government and the cars.
Being 5 hours behind Texas time makes for one LONG day, but we made great time on the plane. Left at 11, arrived at 2.
After 7 hours on a plane, I am officially back in Hawaii! I've missed it so much, I seriously can't even describe.	#Aloha
Besides getting up at 7, this day is going to be amazing: just voted for the first time, getting on a plane, &amp; going to Hawaii.
RT @AP: Gruesome discovery in Russia as 248 preserved human fetuses found in forest; police suspect hospital dumping: http://t.co/NIkcBt ...
That awkward moment when you texted someone yesterday asking to "hang out tomorrow" &amp; they reply today thinking you mean tomorrow.
I really can't sleep, there's just so much to do tomorrow before I leave on Wednesday - packing, college stuff, almost 18 stuff, &amp; goodbyes.
Definitely awkward seeing two people you know at the DPS. I hate this place with a passion, but it's either this or get stranded in Hawaii.
Umm, sorry to intrude but I still exist at this table, you could at least acknowledge me once every 20 minutes.
I'm officially back in Texas. I've honestly missed the heat alot.
Taking off for the 227th time.	#Homebound
I had a really great time in New Orleans for the week! CMSC went smoothly but I'm looking more forward to next year in San Diego!
Apparently Mark Wahlberg is staying in my hotel and on my last day in New Orleans, great timing.
So much stress compressed in 5 minutes before book registration, waking up at 6, &amp; struggling to decide on taking a tour = massive headache.
I'm pretty sure this is the earliest I've been up all summer and it feels like I'm a zombie.	#NotAMorningPerson
I hate not being able to room with one of my two high school best friends since one is a girl &amp; the other won't be living in the same dorm.
Housing Assignments just came out &amp; apparently my roommate name is:	Alexander Hamilton	My roommate is a 250 year old Secretary of Treasury!
How is me feeling sorry for myself a "personal attack" on you? Get over yourself, please and thank you.	#peoplebecrazy
I was having a really good day until that just happened, wonderful.	#CollegeStress	#OnlyChildIssues
I hate when people talk to me about video games and expect me to know what they're talking about. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES.
I swear I must be the only teenager in this city not here for the Lutheran conference...
Going on a swamp tour!	I've always wanted to explore a swamp, they're so interesting and don't exist in Texas, therefore I'm excited! XD
For some reason they choose to have a convention of 20,000 Lutheran teens in New Orleans, the city of booze, drugs, and crime. Whatever...
I promise I'm not a klepto, I'm just helping clean up.
I just got my final transcript in the mail and it said that I was ranked 2nd in the class... wtf Western Hills, its a bit too late for that.
I just realized that I'm taking college chemistry next year when I absolutely hate chemistry and learned pretty much nothing in high school.
I can't believe I'm going to be an "adult" in 10 days. Growing up is frightening. +_+
Great, 3 sets of girl twins. So now I'm not just the only boy but the only non-twin here. 	I really need my kids to get here ASAP.
Being filmed for an episode of Food Paradise on the Travel Channel! And this is only Day 1 of New Orleans.
Hooray, I've landed in Louisiana!	Flying over the swamplands was incredibly interesting, it looks so peaceful yet biodiverse and very green.
Taking off for New Orleans!	It's only an hour-long flight, probably one of the shortest I've ever flown.	Bye, Texas see ya in a week.
I really should be packing right now, but that means I have to accept that I'm leaving again. 	What does one even bring to New Orleans?
It's my dream one day to visit a doughnut shop, but seeing as I lack the willpower to sleep/wake up at a "reasonable" time 'tis impossible.
Being home has been ... boring except the last part of today &amp; the musical (somewhat). Glad I'm leaving in 2 days, give me something to do.
Waiting for furniture repairers to come "anywhere from 10am to 2pm" and they show up at 9:30 while I'm still sleeping. Really?	#StupidPeople
Okay, so I've really been wanting to get a Twitter since forever ago, but today I just got too pissed off; therefore, here I am.
