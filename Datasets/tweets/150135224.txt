This terrible, inhumane conditions must stop. Most of these families are running away from their country of origin because, as Elena said to me, "she rather make this journey, than see them be killed or drafted by a "mara" (a gang). Children should never suffer the consequences.
"There were no beds in the cell and we were not provided any real blankets, they only gave us an aluminum sheet. I had to try and sleep standing. I gave my place on the concrete floor to another man who was hurt‚Ä¶I did not sleep all night because I was standing."
"It was so cold [in the cell], I had a severe headache and backache ‚Ä¶ The CBP agents took my sweater from me, so all I was wearing was a short sleeve shirt, I tried to curl up on the floor and huddle with some of the other women‚Ä¶but I was not able to get warm..."
"The temperature in the cell was very, very cold‚Ä¶as hard as I tried I could not get warm. I now understand why dogs sleep in a little ball, to keep warm, but I couldn‚Äôt even keep warm by doing that. We did ask the guards to change the temperature but the guards didn‚Äôt change it"
More stories about the hieleras via @NILC_org: "Approximately 50 women and their children in the cell in AZ. There was not enough room for everyone to lie down and some kids had to sleep near the toilet. If you got up, you would not have a space to sit when you came back."
This is Elena's baby. She is 5 months old baby girl. I met her at my house when we hosted several migrant families who were released by CBP. Elena and her spent 10 days in the hielera with no diapers and no clean water. She came out really sick because the cell was freezing cold. https://t.co/39WHWCbxla

Migrants come because they want their children to grow up feeling safe. Because guess what, asking for asylum is legal. Their cases can be processed and given a chance to tell their story to an officer. But the Trump admin won't do it. Instead, they keep hurting children. Enough!
You have NO IDEA what people go through in Central America. Most people seeking asylum know that if they stay back, their children will be forced to join a gang, be raped or killed.

Listening to @SenatorCollins reminded me how much I hate D.C. politics and their political games. They don't care about women. They don't care about immigrants. They don't care about children. They don't care about Americans in general. They care about power. That's all. (1/3)
Turning out those who no one pays attention to because they "don't usually vote".... youth, Latinos, people of color and even the white working class in rural areas who feel abandoned by the Democratic party. We gotta turn s**t around. Enough. (1/2)
Let's keep pushing! These politicians will only listen when they feel their power is threatened. We have a chance in November to send that message loud and clear. No, I'm not talking about just electing Dems. I'm talking about turning people out to vote in record numbers. (1/1)

The urgency was not around the March 5th deadline. The urgency is that we are still in limbo! We don't have permanent protection can be deported at any time. We live under an administration who doesn't want us here, and yes, they control what ICE does. #DreamActNow https://t.co/kmS7suegj6
We have sacrificed SO MUCH. Because we don't have the power to vote, we use our bodies and stories to keep pushing. Here is where you can join the #WalktoStayHome and keep this fight alive until we all have permanent protection: https://t.co/me5i3pViGT.
(4) Dear movement, don't forget about us. The urgency is the same now, as it was a few weeks ago. Dreamers are currently walking, and have been walking for days from NY to DC. The same ones who went to jail for 6 days with me as part of a jail strike. They need our support.
(3) To my community, please don't give up. We are hurting. I am hurting. Not just because they took our DACA, but because our families are still being terrorized by ICE every single day. We have been "resisting" for decades, and today is no different. But we know how to fight...
(2) Dear Congress, please do your job and stop playing political football with our lives. There is no reason why you can't pass a piece of legislation that is supported by 80%+ of the American people. It's been 17 years!!!
(1) Dear young Dreamers who didn't have the required age to apply for DACA (literally children btw). Those of you who, for one reason or the other, were not able to ever apply, WE ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR YOU regardless of the #SCOTUS decision on #DACA. We are far from done....

The WH copycat bill from @ChuckGrassley, @JohnCornyn &amp; other hardliners is not a solution for #Dreamers. It's a MASS DEPORTATION "fix" that goes against America's broad support for Dreamers, family reunification, and the values we hold dear for safe communities. #DreamActNow
