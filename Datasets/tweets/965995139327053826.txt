@pascallopepe @Farberyanki Are you crazy or something?!?!
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming Haha you're some freak who has to get professional help
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming Well it seems like God is taking great care of us, we're slowly kicking out all the Arabs and we will have full control is Israel very very soon
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming What is that supposed to mean?
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming You're congresswoman will be impeached much before Trump is, but Trump is not getting impeached,  your therapist probably tells you that he will to cope with the pain.
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming We tried many times, but the palistinians act barbaric z blowing up buses, shooting up restaurant, stabbing people at bus stops
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming For starters that is a left wing biased news source, I would also like to see a link or proof they said that
@Teejgaming I got into politics when I saw how badly Obama damaged our country, being that I'm very patriotic I want order restored. Mr Trump has been doing that and I'm honored to say that he's our president
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming I don't know where you get your info from because that is false
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming Which rockets the iron done?
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming We're not occupying any land, it's been proven we were the first ones in Israel and we were kicked out many times, we finally got it back in 1948 and we ain't gonna give it up
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming I most definitely don't want the country destroyed, but you're people the palistinians are shooting rockets into the place...
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming No the Jewish people were chosen by God not you
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming Yes we are the chosen one
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming I don't get this...
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming Really?!? How exactly do you plan on doing that, you must be in lala land
@Teejgaming We are trying to maintain order in this country, and he is bringing it back. The Democrats are taking it down and it's quite clear, open your eyes a little bit.
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming And just for the record it's not the palistinians home town, it belongs to the Jewish people
@aliceMlA @Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming Haha good luck, you won't even get near taking him down
@Pug_life_4_Blue @Teejgaming Excuse me, what's happening with the Democrats scare me, and I can't watch this country get destroyed

@DaysofPalestine It's a bout time
@yosoyyo10100127 @DaysofPalestine They weren't unarmed learn the facts...
@Timmyom @ShehabAgencyEn Gaza was given to you in 2004 given my the prime minister Ariel sharon, before that it was a thriving Jewish area also known as Gush Katif. Once it was given to palistinians they turned it into an inhumane place, a sick zoo
@Timmyom @ShehabAgencyEn Other way around be have bibical history there, we've been in Israel for thousands of years our palace the "beit hamikdash" which was destroyed was there, this is all before the state even existed, and as far as the states existince it was established in 1948,
@Timmyom @ShehabAgencyEn 100% it should be peaceful correct? But the palistinians are not being peaceful! Burning tires? Throwing rocks? Molatov cocktails? Firing weapons? How on Earth is that peaceful please explain it to me, perhaps I'll learn a new concept.
@Timmyom @ShehabAgencyEn Please explain yourself
@Omar_Gaza You're watching the violent palistinians get killed, even if you yourself are not armed, convince you're people to stand down, by you guys trying to put up a fight that you have no match will end up with mass casualties
@DaysofPalestine Not there land they don't believe there reffering to the gazans

@freegazaorg They have footage aswell from idf of palistinians shooting at them
@freegazaorg If you would follow the event correctly you would understand what happend, stop being so ignorant. The palistinians crossed the boarder several times, and they made it over quite a few times with guns, they sent kids over the boarder as well it's all on camera so you can't denyit
