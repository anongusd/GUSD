Still no answer on why Chief Cochran was fired... @KasimReed?
Thought we had the freedom of speech, apparently @KasimReed doesn't think so.
.@KasimReed fired Chief Cochran because he was a Christian, so who knows...
I wonder if @KasimReed would fire a Buddhist or Muslim for their religious beliefs...
Shocking that Chief Cochran was fired for his religion... what do you think about @KasimReed's decision?
@KasimReed NO one in this country should be fired for their beliefs.
