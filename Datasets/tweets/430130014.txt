Join us at the March for Life on January 18th, 2019!  The 2019 theme is: #UniqueFromDayOne: pro-life is pro-science.  #whywemarch 		Full video: https://t.co/tcOxUiTy0Y https://t.co/PlPVC8dObp
76%  believe abortion should be restricted to the first 3 m of pregnancy. 		Even a majority (60 %) of those who self-identify as pro-choice favor such restrictions. 		Why isn't this reflected in US law? 		(Source: Marist Polls 2018)
The more science progresses, the more it supports the pro-life cause. 		Science continues to prove the truth that you are fully human from the moment of fertilization.  		Pro-life is pro-science. 		March to build a culture of life on January 18th, 2019. #whywemarch
