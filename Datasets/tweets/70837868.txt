Unlike a Flexible Spending Account (FSA), an #HSA is not “use it or lose it.” Instead, #HSAs are real savings accounts that belong to the consumer and follow an individual throughout their life, through job changes or other life events.
Those who select an #HSA-eligible plan on @HealthCareGov and then open a #HealthSavingsAccount can set aside $ in a tax-preferred HSA to help with future healthcare costs that their plan doesn’t cover, like deductibles and copayments.
