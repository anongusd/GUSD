Gleason said the $3,700 hospital bill won't bankrupt his family: "What it does is wipe out our savings."
Atrium Health defended its care and charges as "appropriate." The hospital said, "The symptoms Mr. Gleason presented with could have been any number of things — some of them fatal."
The hospital’s price, while higher than Medicare rates, wasn’t out of line with guidelines. https://t.co/VVaKeX3Ix7
Health care is imperfect and providers of services have incentives to order more care. https://t.co/sf6zSU34pf
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, Gleason’s insurer, said in a statement, that the hospital, Atrium Health Pineville, "appears to have billed Gleason appropriately."
Gleason zeroed in the ER fee -- $2961 -- and argued he should have paid less because of his relatively mild symptoms and because he spent most of the time waiting around.
Matt Gleason asked the hospital for its list of prices, or chargemaster. He questioned many charges on his bill after the ER visit. https://t.co/Cw1hsovRDK
The hospital bill came to $4,692. After insurance discounts, he owed $3,711, almost his entire annual deductible of $4,000.
He spent 8 hours at a nearby hospital — mostly in the ER waiting area. But he got an EKG, chest X-ray, urine and blood tests. Nothing serious was found, and he was sent home.
Measles Outbreak In Pacific Northwest Alarms Public Health Authorities https://t.co/bMmajLhiji
Gleason fainted 5 min. after getting the shot. Though he came to quickly and had a history of fainting, his colleagues called 911. When the paramedics sat him up, he began vomiting. He agreed to go to the hospital in an ambulance.
After suffering through the flu last winter, Matt Gleason decided to get a flu shot at the office in October. "It was super easy and free," he said. But what happened next changed his mind. https://t.co/6XRgsW03s5

With Ocrevus, Genentech did come up with a price that was slightly less than for rival drugs, but only after MS medicines were already extremely expensive. "We set the price of Ocrevus to reduce price as a barrier to treatment," said @genentech spokeswoman Amanda Fallon.
In 2015 (before Ocrevus was approved), @rrichardh took a look at the steep price increases for MS drugs. https://t.co/eN69939l6E
Even in a world of soaring drug prices, multiple sclerosis medicines stand out. Here's a story from 2017 about Ocrevus: @B_M_Jefferson wondered if she should take it. https://t.co/kCfR3WIlfS
"I have a 9-year-old son and my income is $770 a month," said Hickson. "How am I supposed to support him and then you guys are asking me for $3,000?" https://t.co/zNhRQRwD6A
Hickson researched Ocrevus online. The reviews were glowing. But price? https://t.co/7Q4CyjAaNM
The bill totaled $123,019. @caresource, Hickson's Medicare managed care plan, paid a discounted $28,960. Hickson got a bill for about $3,620, the balance calculated as her share by @ClevelandClinic hospital after the insurance reimbursement.
Shereese Hickson's multiple sclerosis was flaring again. Her doctor prescribed Ocrevus, which was better than an older MS medicine in clinical trials. She got two infusions, two weeks apart.
Latest Bill of the Month collaboration is out. In this edition @jayhancock1 and @marlenetaylor48 report on a surprise involving the MS drug Ocrevus.  https://t.co/1Gl9y9fRw9

Langford developed a serious lung infection that sent him to the ICU and then sepsis	During his four-week stay in the hospital and the rehab that followed, Langford had long spells of delirium. All Langford remembers is a near-death experience.
Richard Langford, a 63-year-old retired minister, had knee surgery 10 years ago "because I was playing tennis with an 85-year-old and he beat my butt. So I wanted fresh knees to help me play better."

Legislation to fund the Federal Aviation Administration could add some consumer protections for medevac services, but a provision was dropped that would have let states regulate air ambulances, including pricing and some billing practices. https://t.co/cmcEfeiiWm
Air ambulances are largely regulated not as health care but as part of the aviation industry. Federal laws prevent states from limiting aviation rates, routes and services.
"The number of helicopters is outrageous for the continental United States," said Dr. Ira Blumen of the University of Chicago said. In the '90s, most helicopters ran more than 500 flights a year, on average. At that rate, the cost per flight today would be less than $6,000.
A spokeswoman for Air Evac Lifeteam said it bills people so much to make up for meager payments from Medicare and Medicaid: "Our real cost per flight is the $10,200 plus the unreimbursed cost on each flight for Medicare, Medicaid and patients without any coverage."
Khan's insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, paid $11,972, after initially refusing altogether. Air Evac Lifeteam balance billed Khan $44,631.
"I thought that this was another piece of that puzzle," he said. "It turns out that this was glaringly different."
Khan said he didn't understand why the helicopter flight, which was an integral part of the emergency medical care he received, was treated differently by insurance from his surgeries, nursing care and physical therapy.
