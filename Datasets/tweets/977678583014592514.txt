@JillWalk_79 @LBC @NickFerrariLBC Well that‚Äôs a very good point as well.
@JillWalk_79 @LBC @NickFerrariLBC Naomi had blonde highlights, but the rest of her hair wasn‚Äôt blonde. I think the cartoonist drastically exaggerated her being blonde.

@KTHopkins People who voted to remain are also decent Brits who love their country. Just because they have a difference of opinion doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt love their country too.
@__Ranen__ This is true. We are lucky (in a sense) to live in an age where photographic and film evidence exists that shows the reality of those atrocities. We don‚Äôt have the excuse of ignorance. The horrors of the past should serve as a warning to ourselves.
And then I think... how have we got here. How have we become so dismissive, so flippant about the most horrific and deadly global conflict in human history...		#Brexit
I think about the 85 million people worldwide who did not survive the war...

I think about the 67,200 British civilians who did not survive the war...

@KTHopkins It happened in the Holocaust, it happened in the Armenian Genocide, it happened in the Irish Famine, it happened in the Rwandan Genocide, it happened in the Bosnian Genocide. When will humanity learn.
@KTHopkins The targeting of a specific group of people, a religion, an ethnicity, a tribe or a nationality as a scapegoat for all the worlds problems has time and time again lead to horrific acts against fellow human beings.

In the #2020Primary instead of being divided and doing the #GOP‚Äôs work for them, we need to make positive cases for our preferred candidates, not destroy our primary competitors. We can‚Äôt be so busy fighting against ourselves that we hold the door open for #Trump.
The reason @TheDemocrats did well in the midterms is because candidates like @AOC, @IlhanMN @sharicedavids @Deb4CongressNM ran positive grassroots campaigns, focussing on the issues that effected their communities. They all made a positive case for change.
For the #2020Primary it is essential that #Democrats run a positive campaign. Whoever your favourite candidate is, make the positive case for them instead of trying to destroy the others.
@tariqnasheed Genuine question, instead of dedicating what seems to be a lot of time and energy to destroying Kamala Harris, couldn‚Äôt you be using that time to make a positive case for a candidate that you actually do believe in?
@LeslieMarshall @tariqnasheed After everything that‚Äôs happened over the last 2 and a half years... you‚Äôre actually talking about Kamala‚Äôs hair and music choices? As if what you‚Äôre suggesting here (if it‚Äôs even true) is remotely comparable to what‚Äôs gone down since the birth of Trumpism?

This is the sick legacy of manifest destiny. It‚Äôs actually one of Britain‚Äôs most successful exports, the idea of British exceptionalism brought by English immigrants/invaders to the Americas.

@JuliaHB1 During the lead up to the referendum  #Brexit campaigners advocated so many different versions of Brexit, a Norway deal, a Norway+ deal, a Canada deal, a Canada+ deal, a bespoke deal etc etc. Now they are insisting that leaving ALWAYS meant #NoDeal. Simply not true. #BrexitLies https://t.co/wdriThmNU5
@JuliaHB1 By the exact same logic, I could say that on my ballot paper it did not say ‚Äúleave with no deal‚Äù or ‚Äúhard brexit‚Äù. It just said ‚Äúleave the E.U‚Äù or ‚Äúremain‚Äù. It‚Äôs not our fault that #Brexiteers couldn‚Äôt reach a consensus on what Brexit actually meant.
@JuliaHB1 @Channel4News @Nigel_Farage This way they consolidate their power, influence and control over our Parliament and our democratic system. All you have to do is look at the financial backers of #Brexit to see this is NOT a working class movement, it‚Äôs a movement of the financial elite: https://t.co/mlFI5LvXZH
@JuliaHB1 @Channel4News @Nigel_Farage It‚Äôs so they can strip away regulation and make it much, much easier for them to lobby MPs like Boris Johnson and Jacob Ress Mogg (their public school buddies) to pass laws that help their companies and corporate interests make millions!üí∞üí∞üí∞...
@JuliaHB1 @Channel4News @Nigel_Farage Why do you think they‚Äôve all plowed ¬£millions into the leave campaign to be ‚Äúfree from E.U regulations‚Äù? Do you really think it‚Äôs to help the average joe, everyday working people like you and me? Is it f*ck!...
@JuliaHB1 @Channel4News @Nigel_Farage The elite ARE Brexit. The idea that #Brexit is somehow a working class movement is totally bogus! Its main advocates/financial donors are massively wealthy multi-millionaire financial elites like Arron Banks, Peter Hargreaves, Jeremy Hosking, Lord Edmiston, Crispin Odey etc...

@thatginamiller @KarlWomack3 We need to stop calling it a 2nd referendum. It‚Äôs a referendum on the final deal. We were sold a myriad of different versions of #Brexit, now 2 1/2 years later we have the reality of what #brexit is. The referendum now is a vote on the final deal. Do people still want it?

@JahansPhillip @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Also during the referendum I remember one of the main reasons for #brexit and ‚Äútaking back control‚Äù was to have parliamentary sovereignty. But I guess that was just a nice soundbyte for the Leave campaign.
@JahansPhillip @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Doing their utmost to block it how? All that‚Äôs been discussed in parliament the last two and a half years has been #Brexit. All the other important issues of the country have fallen by the wayside while parliaments sole focus is on this.
@andynew60 @stedhawk @JuliaHB1 @HopeNotPC Personally, I would not trust the ‚Äúessence‚Äù of a message filled with statements that are blatentely incorrect.

@JahansPhillip @Jacob_Rees_Mogg How‚Äôs that? Hillary Clinton won thhe popular vote by 2.8 million people. Electoral college system put Trump in office. If Brexit had been like that you‚Äôd be outraged.
@JahansPhillip @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Cool, but there was and still is no consensus on what ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù actually meant. It‚Äôs definitely nothing like what was sold to the British people during the referendum. So many different versions of Brexit flying around, no agreement on any of them.
@stedhawk @andynew60 @JuliaHB1 @HopeNotPC I assume you‚Äôre referring to municipalities? Either way, they are not ‚Äúnations‚Äù. And even if they were including those, the figure is still wrong.

@Eleffcee @JGoddard230616 @OwenJones84 What‚Äôs actually happening is the numerous versions of Brexit that were sold during the referendum have been whittled down to just two that are very different from what was originally sold. So it‚Äôs now about which one do you want, and do you still want it at all?
@Eleffcee @JGoddard230616 @OwenJones84 Your democratic vote isn‚Äôt being ignored. It‚Äôs basically the only thing goverment has been focussed on for the last two years while every other issue falls by the wayside. If after the referendum gov had just said ‚Äúnah, we‚Äôre not gonna do Brexit‚Äù then you would have a point.

@at67435 @Anna_Soubry No, it‚Äôs because Brexiteers sold a version of #brexit to the British people that never existed and was never possible.

@KTHopkins Yes, the British goverment is taking their strategic advice from... Katie Hopkins! üòÇü§£. Shit, I was wrong this whole time! You ARE funny!
@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins I don‚Äôt understand what question you‚Äôre asking?
@FawkeEU @max5vet @PlasFron @Anna_Soubry You‚Äôre right, I better back brexit 100% even though it is one of the most stupid things I‚Äôve ever heard of. I‚Äôm fully on the #BrexitBus now! Yay!!! Brexit!!! Whooop!
@FawkeEU @max5vet @PlasFron @Anna_Soubry I would so hate to come across to you as ‚Äúthick‚Äù.
@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins It‚Äôs true that he traveled to to the Middle East in the days before and traveled back, but he was not ‚Äúpicked up by boat‚Äù. He flew back to the U.K on a British passport as he was a British citizen. Under your logic we shouldn‚Äôt let anyone back into the U.K even with a passport!

@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins Again, he was an utter monster to have carried out such an atrocious attack on children. His actions were horrific and indefensible. But facts do matter here, and him being British born is a fact.
@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins Huh?
@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins He was a total and utter depraved monster, I have no disagreement with you on that. But he wasn‚Äôt picked up on a boat, he was born in Manchester. It is cleared recorded in every single news article about him. https://t.co/k5rRxZnJQK
@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins Where would they have fled to? All of western Europe was under Nazi occupation and German U-boards controlled the attlantic ocean.
@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins The Manchester attacker wasn‚Äôt picked up on a boat, he was U.K born, in Manchester. Also the idea that none of the refugees that are are rescued from the channel or land on our shores are vetted is again totally false. They are held for months, sometimes years at detention sites.
@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins No, it actually isn‚Äôt. https://t.co/rqF8ja0vwD
@darrenh1ll @winmor1 @KTHopkins He was British born, not a refugee or asylum seeker. He was born in Manchester in 1994, not picked up from the channel, let alone ‚Äúdays before‚Äù the attack. I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôve got that from but it‚Äôs incorrect.

@angelneptustar @DLockhart @BorisJohnson Therefore, to now say that anything short of a #NoDealBrexit is a ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù of the #BrexitVote is simply not true because there never was any one single version of Brexit that #Brexiteers agreed on. Rather there were countless different versions of #Brexit that no one agreed on.
@angelneptustar @DLockhart @BorisJohnson Boris himself earlier on in the #Brexit campaign talked about a potential #NorwayDeal or #CanadaDeal. Others like Dan Hannan outright said we wouldn‚Äôt leave the single market. So, at best there were directly conflicting opinions on single market/customs union access post #Brexit
@angelneptustar @DLockhart @BorisJohnson The video Angie sent me shows SOME #Brexiteers (Leadsom, Gove , Johnson) a couple weeks before the vote saying that we would leave the single market &amp; customs union. I‚Äôm not disputing that. What I‚Äôm disputing is that was ALWAYS the ONLY version of #Brexit that they promoted...

@angelneptustar @BorisJohnson Macrons governments fuel tax is not E.U policy. Diesel prices have gone up 20% over the last year and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs triggered the rioting.

@BesarmeElCulo @KTHopkins The riots in France have literally nothing to do with the E.U. The riots are a reposnse to heavy fuel taxes specifically on diesel by the French goverment. The point of the tax is to get less people using the heavily polluting diesel.

@angelneptustar Clearly Boris here is extolling the virtues of single market/customs union access, as he has done numerous times during the lead up to the referendum. Now he‚Äôs claiming that single market/customs union access was NEVER part of the #Brexit that was promoted to the British people.

@jamesbayswater @DaveAtherton20 @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry Didn‚Äôt see that part of the video, but yes I‚Äôd tend to agree, that looks like intimidation to me. Tottally unnacatpable and uncalled for. Should be looked into as should all such incidents regardless of protagonist / antagonist.
@jamesbayswater @DaveAtherton20 @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry Violence is unnacptable. This does however look like a one on one, two people shouting at each other, not a mob surrounding and chasing down someone who is walking away.

@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry I asked you a direct question. Have you asked any women their opinion?
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry It‚Äôs not at all a direct comparison. The British colonies in the americas were set up for the sole purpose of sending money and agricultural produce back to the British crown. To compare the two means you know very little about at least one of these if not both.
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry And I wonder, have you for one moment stopped to actually ask a women what she thinks?
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry If it was a large group of men, chasing a women down the street, shouting and aggressively intimidating her, then yes I think they would. I first hand know the reality of class discrimination, but I believe you were using it here to switch track for the issue.
@DaveAtherton20 @pedrotherev @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 Sorry, still waiting for you to tie Nazi ideology back to me? ü§î üï∞
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry No, that‚Äôs totally not true at all. And if you truly believe that you don‚Äôt know what the definition of a ‚Äúcolony‚Äù actually is.
@DaveAtherton20 @pedrotherev @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 Which has what to do with me exactly?
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry She hasn‚Äôt colluded with a foreign goverment, she hasn‚Äôt taken bribes or dark money, she‚Äôs simply following her conscience and has offered to step down as an MP if that doesn‚Äôt align with the wider Tory party policy on brexit.
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry This whole #Brexit debate has unleashed such a level of toxicity in politics in the U.K. Ultimately, Anna Soubry believes she is doing what‚Äôs best in the interests of her country. You can disagree with her, but to label her a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù simply for that is wrong.
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry And I disagree. It was intimidating, he chased her down the street and surrounded her with a mob who shouted her down. In a climate where a pro E.U MP was assassinated by a right wing terrorist I refuse to accept that you don‚Äôt understand how intimidating this would be.
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry Ok. That has literally nothing to do with chasing someone down the street and shouting at them and surrounding them with a load of blokes. Unless you‚Äôre implying that‚Äôs how all working class people behave? If so, that is truly ridiculous!
@funder He only reads the #PutinPapers
@pedrotherev @DaveAtherton20 @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 Also nazi + lefty... let me just address that for a second. Nazism is an extreme right wing ideology so your comment makes literally no sense.
@DaveAtherton20 @jamesbayswater @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry I‚Äôm working class so not exactly sure what your point is there.
@pedrotherev @DaveAtherton20 @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 Oh no I‚Äôm here honey. What‚Äôs up?
@jamesbayswater @DaveAtherton20 @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry Well that‚Äôs stupid and wrong because it came dangerously close to being physical. If you can‚Äôt have an effective debate with words instead of violence then I feel sorry for you.
@DaveAtherton20 @pedrotherev @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 @RepMaxineWaters Well I don‚Äôt support intomdation of any sort. So no I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt support Maxine on that count.
@DaveAtherton20 @pedrotherev @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 Maxine waters did not call for that and I think you know that‚Äôs totally untrue.
@DaveAtherton20 @pedrotherev @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 You wouldn‚Äôt be prosecuted under a constitutional amendment as that‚Äôs not how they work. You‚Äôd potentially be prosecuted under a specific crime statute. However the 1st Amendment does not act as a defence for engaging in targeted harassment if that‚Äôs the question you‚Äôre asking?
@p2sanders20033 @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 Again scrutiny is absolutely fine and necessary in a democracy. Chasing someone who disagrees with you down the street with a gang and surrounding them and aggressively intimidating them is not. And to answer your question, no I‚Äôm afraid I have never done that.
@GhostPutin @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry Again, unacceptable to use violence against Trump and his family. If he has committed high Treason and colluded with Russia (and it certainly looks likely he has) there is a legal route through the courts to remove him from office. Violence should play no part in it.
@p2sanders20033 @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 Challenge them by all means, absolutely. But there is a way to do it and it‚Äôs not this thoroughly Unbritish behaviour. Challenge elected officials of course, as is a fundamental right, but you don‚Äôt have rights to chase someone down the street, shouting and intimidating them.
@GhostPutin @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry It‚Äôs absolutely unacceptable to target Jacob and his family as well, exactly the same. Even though I believe he has lied to the British public, violence against him and his family is equally unnactpable.
@pedrotherev @LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 Well I watched it and thought it was threatening. Either way, it‚Äôs a pathetic way to behave. It doesn‚Äôt make someone look big and hard, it makes them look like a dick.
@keytwistedjoker @LeaveEUOfficial Thanking you for what?

@keytwistedjoker @luke_swinney @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry Using phrases like ‚ÄúTraitor‚Äù is inflammatory nonsense. Just because someone doesn‚Äôt agree with you doesn‚Äôt make them a traitor, and it doesn‚Äôt mean that you get to suspend law and order.

@Centreright16 @LFC_blano It‚Äôs what happens if you use violent, aggressive and threatening intimidation tactics, chase someone down the street, surround them and shout in their face.

@LFC_blano @JGoddard230616 So a couple of police offers knocking on his door and politely questioning him you deem ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù but you‚Äôre totally cool with him getting all up in Anna Soubry‚Äôs face, chasing her down the street, shouting at her and acting aggressive and threatening towards her? ü§î
@JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry Also, you think it‚Äôs ok to chase someone down the street, get all up in their face, shout at them and threaten them but then when a couple of officers knock on your door and politely speak to you, that you call ‚Äúharassment‚Äù? Are you joking?
@luke_swinney @keytwistedjoker @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry So true! Totally unnecessary inflammatory rhetoric. It‚Äôs also just not true!
@keytwistedjoker @luke_swinney @JGoddard230616 @Anna_Soubry You don‚Äôt have the right to use aggression, violence and intimidation.

@SarahBSmithVA @diane_longstaff @quaizer79 @darrengrimes_ Here‚Äôs another one because I guess by your deafening silence you didn‚Äôt see the previous. Another example of the leave campaign promoting a Norway style deal, from their own Facebook page. https://t.co/6lp2ZEHBTg
Absolute shameful fear mongering  tactics that the Leave campaign used during the #Brexit referendum. But they take their cue straight out of the Goebbels playbook: ‚Äúaccuse your opponents of what you yourself are doing‚Äù. #BrexitLies #BrexitScam #BrexitCon #BrexitHypocrites
And the absolute audacity of #Brexiters and those on the leave side shouting ‚ÄúProject Fear‚Äù when people point out the disruption of a #NoDealBrexit would cause, why don‚Äôt you take a look at https://t.co/4xBZDfZQY9‚Äôs Facebook page. It is the very definition of #ProjectFear: https://t.co/k4hSvUuRpn
On https://t.co/4xBZDfZQY9‚Äôs own Facebook page they pitched a Norway style deal! Now claiming they never did! LIES! #BrexitLies #BrexitLiers #BrexitIsALie! They lied to the British people. This #NoDealBrexit is NOT the version of #Brexit they sold to the British people. https://t.co/acFkGub1ub
They continuously promoted Norway Style / Canada Style potential #Brexit deals and access to the single market. Now they are acting as if they never said that and that anything that isn‚Äôt #NoDealBrexit is a ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù. LIES! They continuously pitched Norway/Canada style deals.

@SarahBSmithVA @diane_longstaff @quaizer79 @darrengrimes_ That is simply not true. They absolutely DID propose Norway/Canada and other single market access options. This is from leave .eu‚Äôs own Facebook page! https://t.co/3GMI0jL7Ea

All the way through the run up to the referendum the leave campaign said that we‚Äôd be able to negotiate a deal and remain in the customs union/single market. That‚Äôs why they proposed Norway, Canada etc style deals.
@derekdawkins01 @LawEireann @Jacob_Rees_Mogg We‚Äôve been trying that for the last 2 years. Hasn‚Äôt worked. Brexit is in three months time.

@Jacob_Rees_Mogg Not the end of the world but it is stupid &amp; unnecessarily disruptive.

It‚Äôll be everyday hard working people most effected when there are shortages.
@LawEireann @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @derekdawkins01 If you can show me research or evidence that shows there will not be any disruption following a no deal Brexit I would be more than happy to look at it.
@LawEireann @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @derekdawkins01 Also, the #projectfear tag is stupid and meaningless. The evidence for disruption post no deal Brexit is substantiated by countless sources with detailed facts and figures:  https://t.co/BssHIpuXRU

@derekdawkins01 @LowTaxChloe They don‚Äôt want no deal as an option because it is harmful for the U.K. and as always it‚Äôll be the hard working every day people of the UK that are hardest hit.
@quaizer79 @SarahBSmithVA @darrengrimes_ Because it did not say ‚Äúleave the customs union‚Äù on the ballot paper. It did not say ‚Äúleave the single market‚Äù on the ballot paper. It did not say ‚Äúleave EU with no deal‚Äù on the ballot paper. It did not say ‚Äúhard brexit‚Äù on the ballot paper.
@quaizer79 @SarahBSmithVA @darrengrimes_ The leave campaign continuously pitched a Norway or Canada style deal. That‚Äôs what they sold to the British public. Now they continue to move the goal posts and say anything short of hard brexit isn‚Äôt what people voted for. Well, how do they know what people voted for?
@quaizer79 @SarahBSmithVA @darrengrimes_ Again it‚Äôs just more #BrexitLies because leaving the customs union and the single market was never what was being pitched by the leave campaign in the lead up to the referendum.

@johncardillo That‚Äôs rich considering the current occupant of the Oval Office stole the 2016 election using illicit and illegal practices and did it by colluding with a foreign adversary to do so.
This, the research claims, is because of the dependence on imported products from Europe and the complex supply chains which would be very sensitive to delays.
LSE research commissioned by the dairy industry says dairy products would be particularly hit and ‚Äúsee shortages of products and a sharp rise in prices, turning everyday staples like butter, yoghurts, cheese and infant formula, into occasional luxuries‚Äù.
5) Prices in the shops:The prices of consumer goods would likely increase significantly under a no-deal, particularly for foods like meats and cheese.
There would be disruption abroad too at ports like Rotterdam which process a lot of British goods.
If Britain leaves the single market and customs union the EU says it would have to impose similar border checks anyway, but a transition period would give the UK time to expand its infrastructure to cope.
...after project planning setbacks meant officials had to start from scratch. Instead, the government is planning to close part of a nearby motorway and use it as a massive lorry park.
These thousands of lorries a day have to physically be held somewhere. The Independent reported earlier this year that huge dedicated lorry parks planned for coastal areas in Kent won‚Äôt be ready for in time for a no-deal in March...
Even a high-tech system of checking freight lorries requires them to be held for at least five or 10 minutes ‚Äì longer if something goes wrong, which it sometimes does.
4) Disruption at ports and airports: As well as economic disruption there would almost certainly be significant physical disruption at ports such as Dover because of the need for customs and regulatory checks on goods.
Under the WTO rules scenario, the Treasury‚Äôs modelling expects unemployment to rise by 820,000 in two years, sterling to fall by 15 per cent, and inflation to rise by 2.7 per cent.
HM Treasury forecast ahead of the referendum, whose most pessimistic scenario was predicated on talks collapsing, suggested that such a Brexit would ‚Äúpush the UK into recession and lead to a sharp rise in unemployment‚Äù.
3) Britain‚Äôs wider economy: We don‚Äôt know what precise effect these massive reduction in trade and UK exports would have on the British economy, but it‚Äôs fair to say it would not be good.
Britain would, now outside the EU and without any special opt-out, be on the other side of the fence.
...who would face 30-40 per cent charges for exporting to the EU, effectively making many exports unviable. These tariffs are what Britain, currently a member of the EU, charges countries outside the EU, as a member of the trade area.
A parliamentary report into a no-deal concluded that ‚Äúthis would almost certainly involve the immediate imposition of tariffs across a range of sectors‚Äù. Some tariffs would be more significant than others: the highest would be on British farmers...
This isn‚Äôt something the EU can just opt-out of: the WTO effectively requires countries to charge the same tariffs to countries they don‚Äôt have a trade deal with, a rule called the ‚Äúmost favoured nation‚Äù tariffs. Grant someone a special favour, &amp; you have to do it to all members.
But under WTO rules there would be immediate customs and regulatory checks and the UK and EU would have to pay tariffs on each others‚Äô goods.
2) Trade takes a hit: Under this cliff-edge, the UK would be forced to trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Currently, goods moving between the EU and UK don‚Äôt need to be checked at borders and face no tariffs, &amp;complex supply chains in industries like..
But this transition period is conditional on a withdrawal agreement being signed. If there is no withdrawal agreement, there is no transition period, and the UK economy faces an abrupt cliff-edge.
This ‚Äúimplementation period‚Äù is supposed to allow time for new post-Brexit arrangements to be put into place ‚Äì such as a new trade deal for British goods.
1) No transition period:	Theresa May has negotiated a transition period with the EU, during which the UK would continue to follow EU rules (without any say in what they are) for just under two years after it leaves the EU in March 2019.
What is likely to happen in a no deal scenario... not #ProjectFear but #ProjectFact... #PMQs...

@BBCPolitics If the ‚Äúwill of the people‚Äù is what is most important here than why are #Brexiteers and the #LeaveCampaign so opposed to allowing them to have a say on the final deal? Because @BorisJohnson @michaelgove @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @Nigel_Farage etc never cared about the will of the people

@BBCPolitics Please stop throwing around this ‚Äúwill of the people‚Äù rhetoric. 1) it‚Äôs only the will of 52% of those who voted 2) the entire leave campaign was based on lies &amp; deceit. 3) in 2 years since the vote no one has been able to deliver the #BrexitFantasy that was sold to the people.

That is the result of 30+ years of being the main target of the republican attack machine. If you throw enough mud, eventually some of it will stick whether it‚Äôs justified or not. Her record speaks for itself, they can‚Äôt attack that so they have to attack her personally.
Even on the liberal/democratic side, people have this feeling of ‚Äúwell I feel like I‚Äôm not suppose to like her‚Äù but when you actually ask them to be more specific about why, they often don‚Äôt really have a specific reason. It‚Äôs just a vague feeling.
People (both liberals and conservatives) start to think, ‚Äúwell I keep hearing all these smears against her so there must be something wrong with her‚Äù.
This is sadly very true. When you‚Äôve been a public servant for 30+ years and have been targeted by the republican political attack machine for that whole time, eventually people start to believe there must be something wrong with you. https://t.co/7G4rHru0GB

How can the people saying they want to protect democracy be against having more democracy? If they truly want to defend and support democracy they should welcome a #PeoplesVote

@warrendix3 Wrong. Not what happened. Senator Nikema did nothing of the sort. She was in the Capitol building listening to her constituents. And they arrested her for it.
@warrendix3 It also protects the right of a democratically elected senator to be in her own Capitol building representing the constituents that voted for her
@warrendix3 I agree with you that we are a nation of laws, I live my life by that principle. Which is why law protects voters rights, the democratic election process and the right to peaceful protest.
