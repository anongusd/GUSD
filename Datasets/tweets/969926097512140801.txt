@WhiteHouse We have an invasion of a madman! Holy shit! He‚Äôs insane. Please IMPEACH HIM NOW!! Today was a perfect reason of his insane words to have enough to impeach!!!
Trump supports China with executing all drug dealers. So, a young 18 yr old, desperate, makes a wrong choice, dealt drugs, should be killed?? That‚Äôs pretty fucked up!

@realDonaldTrump DEMS ARE WORKING ON IT BY IMPEACHING YOU!!!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump With him under so many CRIMINAL investigations, he should not be allowed to make ANY decisions until the Mueller report is done!! America can‚Äôt trust you or him.
@gtconway3d @WendyMomofbest3 Worried? Tell @KellyannePolls to get her things in order. She‚Äôs going down with Donald.
@realDonaldTrump More lies. It‚Äôs all you know how to do. PLEASE MUELLER!! Get this dangerous POS OUT OF OUR WHITE HOUSE! #ImpeachDonaldTrump
@ChuckGrassley How‚Äôs that BUZZ FEED??
@senatemajldr @March_for_Life @KentuckyRTL You allowed how many families stripped apart, you are not working towards ending this shutdown putting so many in harms way! You, stand for no one‚Äôs lives but Trumps. #Resign
@senatemajldr Open the Goverment!! You and your core is down to 33%, why are not working for all Americans!! We will remember come next election!

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Dear dear man child, Cohen owns his bad doings. Takes a REAL man to do that. Are you that stupid (many say you are) to think it‚Äôs only Cohen‚Äôs word? Mueller is coming for you and your family! Game over!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Hahaha!!! Soon come...
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse All a distraction from what‚Äôs really going on. His base is down to 33%, and shrinking. I wouldn‚Äôt be too proud of that.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Turn off FAKE @foxandfriends and check out what EVERY news station is covering!!!
@realDonaldTrump @JimInhofe No. It‚Äôs ok. The Dems are willing and ABLE to run our Country after you are gone. Holding Americans hostage for your WEE 33% base is retarded. #ImpeachDonaldTrump #TrumpResign
