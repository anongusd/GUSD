#anxiety Thanks Harold Meyerson for stunning examination of fall of U.S. worker. My tweets don't do justice pls read http://t.co/4Pab94D0bp
#anxiety Americans must transform their anxiety into indignation and direct it to the task of reclaiming their stake in the nation’s future.
#anxiety Amassing the power to secure those remedies will require an extraordinary, sustained, and heroic political mobilization.
#anxiety Many roadblocks to recreating a broadly prosperous U.S. ultimately political creations that are susceptible to political remedy.
#anxiety However, extinction of a large and vibrant American middle class isn’t ordained by the laws of either economics or physics.
#anxiety What has vanished over the past 40 years isn’t just Americans’ rising incomes. It’s their sense of control over their lives.
#anxiety During globalization: Germany's policies: workers power/income intact; in U.S., not so.
#anxiety German companies' funding largely from generating investment internally or borrowing from banks. Role of shareholders insignificant
#anxiety By law, all German companies &gt; 1,000 workers must have equal numbers of worker and management reps on their corporate boards.
#anxiety Germany has national policies that not only bolster manuf thru excellent vocational education but also give workers more power.
#anxiety German industrial workers’ wages and benefits are about one-third higher than Americans’.
#anxiety Unlike American multinationals, Germany's have kept their most remunerative and highest-value-added production jobs at home.
#anxiety Collapse of workers’ power to bargain helps reveal primary paradox of current US econ: why workers don't enjoy productivity gains.
#anxiety  In 1960, 3 largest U.S. employers were high-wage unionized manufacturers or utilities: General Motors, AT&amp;T, and Ford.
#anxiety Today, America’s 3 largest privatesector employers: low-wage retailers WalMart, Yum! (owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC) and McDonalds
#anxiety ... while the share of the nation’s income going to corporate profits is at a record high.
#anxiety Share of U.S. income going to wages, which for decades was more than 50 percent, now at record low of 43%
#anxiety Decimation of manuf in U.S. not because of robots: Econ Rob Scott calcs the U.S. lost 2.4M jobs to China in 8yrs after trade deal.
#anxiety Flight of jobs to low-wage nations accelerated by trade accords, most prominently NAFTA &amp; Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China
#anxiety David Neumark, econ w/ UofC Irvine has shown that 8 yrs after Wal-Mart comes to a county, drives down wages for all workers
#anxiety UofC Irvine research: When a new Wal-Mart opens, it drives out higher-wage competition or compels competition to decrease pay.
#anxiety Days of shared prosperity gone. 1980s: new corporate model: workers, public not as important: stock price, stockholders dominate
#anxiety Post WWII saw broad prosperity, companies paying workers enough that they could afford to buy the goods they mass-produced.
#anxiety Dems as well as GOP responded to the inflation of the late 1970s with policies that significantly reduced workers’ incomes.
#anxiety Since 1974, productivity up 80% but median compensation (wages plus benefits) risen only 11%.
#anxiety 1974 a "fundamental breakpoint" in U.S. econ history. Why? Marks the beginning of a runaway divergence of productivity and wages.
#anxiety One of the single best pieces I've read in some time about the loss of power of American workers: http://t.co/4Pab94D0bp

Anti coal person: climate change under way; sea level rise; impacts evident "This is going on right now today." #coalwa
