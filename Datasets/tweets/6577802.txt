POTUS more interested in temporary fixes than truly reforming health care w/ patient-centered solutions instead of government-centered ones.
POTUS fix is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic: ship is still going down, and a lot of people are getting hurt.
POTUS saying he can fix #Obamacare is making another promise he won’t/can't keep. The law will drive up costs, limit choices, destroy access

We do not need a govt. health care takeover or another #ObamaTaxHike. We need fundamental reform.
With an increasing amt of debt, millions of Americans out of work, POTUS wants $2.6 TRILLION in new taxes on the American people.
NEW TAX HIKES: Pres health care law = $1 trillion, Pres budget = $1.1 trillion, January 2013 = $600billion. #SpendingIsTheProblem
January 2013 - President Obama got his $600 billion in new tax hikes on the American people. #ObamaTaxHike

Financial transaction tax impedes market efficiency, decreases liquidity &amp; raises costs for investors &amp; job creators.
The EU is in Washington this week promoting a global financial transaction tax. Paying taxes to other countries is a bad idea.
It has been almost a month &amp; still no word from Pres @BarackObama	on when he will actually submit his budget. #RequireAPlan
