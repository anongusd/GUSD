In my opinion the guy still has a lot in the tank but it‚Äôs not my place to say what he wants to do with his career. All I can speak for is myself and trying to turn my life around from the depths it was in. God bless and have a great Saturday...
The facts of the matter are the reason he‚Äôs not being signed are non football based. The guy took a team to the Super Bowl and continuously wreaked havoc on the NFC West and the league. Maybe he had a bad year two years ago but he‚Äôs not a bad player and that‚Äôs a fact..
Standing up for people who often don‚Äôt get heard and for a race that continually deals with problem after problem in this country for CENTURIES. This world we live in is absolutely crazy and I believe what he‚Äôs doing has an amazing impact.
This will probably cause an uproar, but I‚Äôm tired of the @Kaepernick7 vs myself comparisons and anger. Kap is doing amazing things right now changing lives and donating millions of dollars. His impact off the field from a societal standpoint is legendary and straight admirable.
