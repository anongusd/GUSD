@plathitude It was a gorgeous stone too. Perfect.
Son says “oh well” we’ll bring our kids back one day and tell them there is treasure to hunt for. ahaha! He’s remarkably calm about it all

@Lost_Sophist No. It seems to be a no body no crime situation. Quite clear from known circumstances what happened. I am beyond frustrated.
Lawyered up from day one. I KNOW that with public pressure, media pressure this would break wide open. So frustrated. So very frustrated.
But what do I do. I do not know what to do.
What do you do. Sitting on this  data. Data…justice. He’s probably going to get away with this unless I do something.
