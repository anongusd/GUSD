@secupp AQ-a media label for any group that carries out terrorist acts against the US.  OBL's AQ has been broken up into rogue pieces
Great article!!  Mike Wallace definitely has far more to worry about than the way Jason Collins was born.
Why come down on Don Young for saying what the rest of the Republicans think about the Hispanic community?
@dailyrundown duke.  Richard nixon:-)
Taliban didn't attack us, Al Qaeda did.Taliban choose illiteracy  and live in the stone ages. But any Arabs will do to Americans it seems.

@NowWithAlex Booker does not know the difference between a Private equity firm and a quick buck chop shop!!
@NowWithAlex Booker thinks it is OK for the unions to profit from Bain at the expense of lost jobs of the workers who make up the union.

@rolandsmartin Strange that Mitt has attacked Obama's foreign policy all season. obama mildly retaliates, and everybody cries. hypocrates!
Thomas Friedman's book is a must read!!
@hardball_chris m blackman said government should not create jobs. why didn't you ask her why obama gets blame for the 9.1 %?  Hypocrisy!!
@CarolCNN Media did not hold Boehner accountable for the outrageous statements the Tea Party has been making since Obama was elected.
@SaveUMFootball Our DC better learn that The U attacks, hell with read n react.  Canes are Thoroughbreds!  we are not PSU Clydesdales.
@SaveUMFootball MD has been practicing that gameplan since Edsall got there.  Stephen didnt know he was playing until last week.  Be fair
@MikeAndMike @NFLCommish Why do you suspend players who get arrested before they have a trial? Guilty until proven innocent?
@MikeAndMike @NFLCommish When did the NFL become the police force 4 the NCAA? Y do u feel YOU should suspend 4 what happened n college?

@MHarrisPerry Great job subbing for Larry
@DesmondHoward You are 1000% correct!!  And he would never coach again!!
@kaybaileyhutch No bus makers here.  Thank your Republican CEOs of bus makers and the tax breaks you give them to go overseas.
@ChuckSchumer please convince Obama to raise the rates on people who make $1m per year. $250k per year is not wealthy. $250k is Clinton era
@kaybaileyhutch I would love to know what you really think about the popularity of Bachmann and Palin; two women who glamorize stupidity.
@hurricanesports the only sane place to be in Coral Gables.  Get busy boys.  The only thing you can control now is what goes on the field.
@JenGranholm Gov, please tell the Pres. to raise tax rate on people who make $1m per year, not $250k. $250k per year is not wealthy anymore.
@DesmondHoward We can now see why AD Kirby Hocut hauled ass after hiring Coach Golden!!  He saw the Tsumani wave!!
@rolandsmartin At least Perry will weed out the craziness in the Reublican party. Conservatism is one thing; craziness is another
@TheFix A Bachmann win=hypocrisy wins.  No medicaid for citizens; her clinic accepted $137k medicaid. No gov. farm aid; Bachmann farm: $245k
@rolandsmartin Why do the tea partiers say they want less government but then blame Obama (government) for the lack of jobs?
@DJSHARAM it's keith from the old state of the union. my friends in romania say you ripped it the other night.  congratulations bro!!
@kaybaileyhutch @donlemmoncnn 6 years of Bush rubber stamping and now Republicans have a new religion that forbids funding high speed rail?
@CharlesMBlow DAMN!!
@kaybaileyhutch @SpeakerBoehner where is the compromise? your rich friends still have their tax cuts at the expense of the middle class.
@politico why is she still talking?  christine, you lost, badly, so go away.  you weaken the republican party.
@politico This does not surprise me.  So Dems now know how to cut spending better than Repubs?  Repubs are a joke!!
@MikeAndMike Will that umpire get at least suspended?
If you pay taxes, you helped send $137,000 in Medicaid funding to Bachmann's "Pray away the gay" clinic.
Family farms, clinics.  This tea party hypocrite loves government money, but not for seniors or the poor.
Why has the Federal government given over $137,000 in Medicaid funds to Bachmann's absurd pray-away-the-gay counseling clinic?
She also received $245,000 in subsidies for her family farm.  Government is her personal piggy bank
Bachmannn's "pray away the gay" counseling clinic has received over $137,000 in federal Medicaid funds.
@AliVelshi @huffingtonpost at the end of the interview, i was wondering if that guy was or wanted to be gay!!  LOL
@GovGranholm @DailyKos Great article Governor!!  Especially for your state.  Old automobile manufacturing plants=Wind turbine plants.
