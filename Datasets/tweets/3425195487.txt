@Amy_Siskind Are you giving up?
@Phil_Lewis_ What is Shinola?
@ProudResister @SpeakerPelosi @JerryNadler @HouseDemocrats Sorry I'm on your side but I'm of us trying to impeach and failing in the senate. It will embolden him and probably galvanize his supporters to elect him again next year
@sarahkendzior @umairh So what are you saying? For us to give up? You're not helping me, you're making like shit and hopeless. What should I do?
@peterdaou They‚Äôre all young, female, proud progressives and not white

@Ronald__Rump @JoshNBCNews @EichbergerUSA @NBCNews You didn't answer my question yesterday. Can you answer my question?
@davidwbrown @DemWrite That's cute
@imfabulous13 No, what they did was wrong regardless of which they're part of. It would be terrible for us to defend Hillary if she did what Trump did
@SenJohnKennedy You're a twat
@imfabulous13 Shut up, I'm tired of hearing your messages in the hashtags.
@leahmcelrath https://t.co/be8usSvSm8
@LWhannell Good luck
@TheRickyDavila @LindseyGrahamSC No, he's choosing to be this way. He's an opportunist who wants a job in the administration.
@mia_nj Sorry but that man is mentally crazy and suffers from schizophrenia. Find another person to follow
@peterdaou Beto
@RepEscobar @daveweigel You sure you talked to every single one of them and asked bluntly "Do you want a wall?"
@Goss30Goss That's what I don't like about this. In a hypothetical situation, if all the other 99 senators, all the Democrats and Republicans support opening up the government. He ALONE can block it. The rules need to changed for the good of the country
@peterdaou @LindseyGrahamSC He's choosing to be way. He's an opportunist who probably wants to be in the administration or just hoping to get reelected next year
@klassylady20069 Take the easy out.
@VoteOjeda2020 Sorry man but I don‚Äôt think you should run for pres. You‚Äôre an undoubtedly great candidate and I donated 2 you last year but I think you should run in 2020 for @SenCapito‚Äôs seat. It‚Äôs a better fit for you

@Graceann319 @sarahkendzior @RukhnamaLives Idiot
@LauraVanVleet @kelli_carvino @LilDocCollins @sarahkendzior @RukhnamaLives Stop getting paranoid you idiot. Do you think everything that goes wrong in your life is Russia‚Äôs fault?
@kelli_carvino @LilDocCollins @sarahkendzior @LauraVanVleet @RukhnamaLives No you tim foil hat twat. Not everything is Russia‚Äôs fault

@InequalityIsBad You‚Äôre a freakin Commie who calls for the deaths of others. What a tolerant fellow you are
@mcspocky This is so sad and pathetic. You guys are so hyperbolic in your unfunny memes. This is not true resistance. All you do is tweet the same stupid may-mays. If Democrats lose this November. It will probably be you guys faults. https://t.co/0JfTCIx1gx

@Amy_Siskind @NY1 Amy, I know the location of the girls is concerning. Nonetheless  I'm proud the media is paying attention to what's going on at the border. This is a story that deserves national attention. I'm hope we'll find out about the girls soon enough
BREAKING: The repeal of #NetNeutrality just went into effect. Your cable company now has even more power to screw you over and censor online content. But Congress can still stop this. Go to https://t.co/qqE6mvn82x to contact your reps now! via @IDLtweets
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov You broke my train of thought. Please leave me while I ponder
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov idk
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov I'm saying that maybe we will solve this predicament through more "forceful" means and making sure this never happens again through those same forceful methods. In this situation, examples could be made. And maybe we'll go to war with Russia I don't know
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov Perhaps, but we don't change regardless. Really how do think everything would be if Obama never became president. Maybe our politics wouldn't have become so partisan and hyperbolic. And people like Trump, Pence and Ryan would've never come to power
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov Maybe this was our preordained fate to fall to autocracy and no one caring. But how it ends in either voting them out, acceptance or a violent overthrow is beyond our predictions. This world just reset itself eventually
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov You know you can end this. Just block me. I'm beyond saving now. I have no plans to kill anyone. But you can't reach me and I can't reach you. We're just shouting at each other to do things we'll never do because of how we are so hooked to our screens.
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov Fuck it. Just put on a bomb vest and blow yourself up in front of the white house man. That will be the strongest message of them all.
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov I just find it hypocritical why you say stop tweeting yet you continue to tweet without at least trying to march yourself. You're acting like a nihilistic sniveling coward
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov Seriously why don't YOU stop tweeting and marching so we can be inspired by one man because that's what we need
@resistfascism1 @RealSlFn @AtlanticCouncil @JohnJHarwood @ODNIgov Why don't you start now? Tell me why don't you march yourself...
@barrenwomb68 @polopaula @greatriverlady Your lying. I'm defending my Democracy. My profile says I'm a #resister and you are just trying to make us less united by attacking others. It's you who's racist. How about you joins the boys at Revcom? They suit you well
@barrenwomb68 @polopaula @greatriverlady Don't worry Boys, this person is a fake resister with a fake profile pic and a fake cause
@barrenwomb68 You're sick, and why haven't you blocked me yet?
@barrenwomb68 Yes Please Block so I can be free of your pathetic sight
@barrenwomb68 lmao you are so sensitive for a machine
@barrenwomb68 You crack me up
@barrenwomb68 Really bitch. Don't diss on me like that. You're trying to divide us with hyper partisan anger and wild conspiracies fitting to Louise Mensch and Claude Taylor. It's you who's using the Putin tricks
@barrenwomb68 Oh really? Why are so hyper aggressive. And why is your profile pic that of some lady from Peru? I can see through your mask.
@barrenwomb68 Stop masquerading. I know you a faker in the resistance. Cease all activity now

@barrenwomb68 You act so childish
@TomthunkitsMind That was 2 months ago. I see you're kinda slow on events
@michaelianblack I think she might be dead. Just guessin'
@TheRickyDavila If you need help understanding. Here's the wookiepedia page https://t.co/ITHMOuzSNg
@TheRickyDavila If Puerto Rico is struck again this season... Will the island basically become uninhabitable, thus sparking a max exodus and Trump turning the island into a resort for his cronies and basically the equivalent of the planet Byss from Star Wars?
@Acosta Nice
@girlsreallyrule Will he say the n word or the other f word next?
@sarahkendzior What if she's dead? Just wondering
@MichaelSchmel11 It's a lie, She had no source linked. She is a bot
No offense but I think the reason Melania has disappeared is because she's dead
@barrenwomb68 No source. Fucking liar just like the child organ harvesting
@TheRickyDavila If another hurricane hits Puerto Rico, will the island become uninhabitable
@TheRickyDavila It is better than an actual war you have to admit

@Amy_Siskind Why doesn't he just try to fire Mueller for real already? He's had so many chances (The first indictments, Nunes Memo, Last week)
@realDonaldTrump Dude, Just fire Mueller already. Why are you waiting so long?
@ChicoCat3 @barrenwomb68 I am questioning if she is legit. Her profile photo comes from a lady in Peru
@barrenwomb68 Pay attention to me and answer my question from earlier dammit!
@barrenwomb68 Tell me please, I need clarification on the source you got
@barrenwomb68 Hey talk to me, why did you say they were harvesting children's organs. Nobody ever said that!
@revclubchi What your calling for is a violent overthrow including us Democrats and replacing it with a Mao-esque system. Sorry but I through your body and you cannot join the resistance with that behavior
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes @TrumpTaxes @kdoright Yo back me up on this one. He seems to be a stubborn toadie
@revclubchi Not respectful, apologize.
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes I am angry at you for being a dick, that's all
@barrenwomb68 The fuck are you taking about lady? They never said anything about organ harvesting
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes Fuck you faggot
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes How about YOU stop tweeting, take a break from the internet start your protest right now
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes No, after you're gone. I will encourage everyone to join me in the streets to fulfill you wishes. Deal?
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes *light the spark
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes Please, do it for us. I have a fight left in me. You must the spark, literally.
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes Okay, You do it. You killing yourself will make a great sacrifice to the gods. Then we'll start the protest
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes You first I insist! Start by setting yourself on fire a la Tunisia
@kdoright @resistfascism1 @TrumpsTaxes Just stare it down until more join I guess. @resistfascism1 Or you could just do the easy option, strap a bomb to your chest and threaten to blow up yourself and the white house unless they resign.	Sorry
@barrenwomb68 You are not a true resister like me.
@resistfascism1 @kdoright @TrumpsTaxes You first if you want it. Go out and stare the White house down
Mr. @DevinNunes What you're doing with meddling in the investigation even though you say the house's work is done is obstruction! Stop it now or face the consequences in November!

@cryborg @Top_Sergeant And Russia Nuking us in California? Have you heard of Mutually assured destruction. Something Russia Has
@cryborg @Top_Sergeant Do you really think Kim Jong un is in cahoots with Trump and Putin? Even Putin doesn't like Kim and sees him as an annoying kid!
@cryborg @Top_Sergeant Sorry, I don't like Trump either but your theories go beyond the realms of reality!

@KellyannePolls You're a lying bitch
@flyinglotus I have a question about your movie back at Sundance. I heard about what it is but was there some secret message to the film?
@the_moviebob Do you want Trump dead?
@realDonaldTrump Do you ever wish all the drama could be over?
@RealAlexJones You sir are an insane conspiracy theorist you is so gullible to anything you hear! Have you been using too much bath salt?
@the_moviebob Yes, a world where the white man is disgraced upon and treated like the Jews were in the holocaust. That's what you want right
@YAppelbaum 'murica.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, you will serve him and call him master
@ObamaMalik You are brilliant man, never change.
@the_moviebob Have you ever watched The Godfather or Citizen Kane?
@ADobsonComics Dobson why is it that you can't accept criticism? It could really help you. Your detractors are your true audience after all.
@Drfool3 It's either stupidity or lack of self awareness. If it's both then I can't do anything for them.
@Drfool3 ... Nothing. And I'm pretty sure Trump's ridiculous claims won't all happen. People can't seem to watch their mouths at all.
It pains me to see that everyone is so hypocritical of themselves, ALL the time. All these SJWs say they're bringing change, yet they do...
@pixelatedboat Goddamn the news, trying to tie everything and anything into politics for no reason.

@_icze4r The crew of the movie signed forums that they would only talk positively of the movie.
@pa8600 I don't even think the original film even warranted at least one sequel.
@pa8600 I did not see that movie. I do not intend to ever see it or it's sequel.

@dennis_imp @cringe_channel @BadMlp @strikerwolf1 So he's gay?
The director (William Brent Bell) made The devil inside, the one with the worst ending ever.
So this horror movie called The boy is coming out soon, looks fine but... Does anyone remember the director's previous work?
@cringe_channel They're no longer attacking us white cis gamers, they are now attacking Eddie Redmayne because "he's a cis acting a trans"

@cringe_channel Ever since seeing Felt, I believe every feminist might want to kill me and cut my dick off
@femfreq Do you want to kill me and rip my penis off?
@cringe_channel I saw a movie where a feminist killed a guy and ripped his penis off. Is that what they wanna do to us?
@cringe_channel Let's call the extreme ones "feminazis"
@Hawksider @cringe_channel Well I never expected it to be that cheaplooking! I hate Planes and The nut job but at least those are made well.
@Hawksider @cringe_channel Norm of the north unfortunately reminds me of Foodfight!
@NormOfNorth @IMDb Did you drug them? Your trailer alone is shit!

@cringe_channel I saw a movie called Felt last Summer, It's like if the SJWs and feminists of Tumblr made a horror movie.
@cringe_channel Why does this feel like that movie about rape that I saw once?
@Gligar13 There's a film coming out about a man who walker across the twin towers on a high wire. How many 9/11 jokes will be spewed?
